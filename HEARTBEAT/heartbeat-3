EDITOR's Comment:
     
     This week we offer the third in our four part Star Trek
series. We also look at ways that we can live and
minimize our environmental footprint.
 
 
 
                     WHAT IS THE HALIFAX ECOCITY PROJECT?
 
                                       
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   The Halifax EcoCity Project is the first detailed design for an
   Ecopolis in Australia, where Ecopolis = ecologically responsible and
   sustainable urban settlement. It contains commercial and community
   facilities as well as housing, with the emphasis on middle and lower
   income accommodation. The project concept and design received a South
   Australian Civic Trust Commendation in November, 1992.
   
   In the mediterranean climate of the Tandanya Bioregion of South
   Australia, the Ecopolis philosophy is being applied in a practical,
   two-pronged program of urban redevelopment and rural renewal. The
   community non-profit organisation Urban Ecology Australia Inc., (UEA)
   has co-initiated the development of the "world's first piece of
   eco-city" in the centre of the city of Adelaide.
   
   People want healthy, balanced environments - functionally,
   financially, socially and culturally. They seek ownership,
   involvement, equity and participation. Cities should belong to their
   citizens. Control of capital is usually in the hands of those who
   build only to make a profit - not to make beautiful and healthy
   cities. But business-as-usual is being challenged by ecological
   development - development with the community in control.
 
   The design proposes a community of 800 - 1,000 people with pedestrian
   streets, squares and courtyards, and energy efficient buildings of 3
   to 5 stories with belvederes rising above them. The buildings use
   stabilised earth, concrete and timber construction to create spaces
   and places responding to the needs and creativity of the inhabitants
   as well as the demands of healthy environmental performance and
   ecological responsibility. The plan and detail design of every
   dwelling is developed through a "barefoot architect" program involving
   architects and urban ecologists in a direct consulting and educational
   role with all members of the incoming community. The educational
   process will go both ways with architects learnIn,HXlSQcommunity and
   both learning about ecology!.
   
   The passive solar cooling and heating of the architecture is designed
   to work with extensive vegetation including permaculture and an
   ecological corridor of native species. This project will demonstrate
   its responsibility for the city's environmental impact in a direct,
   practical way, with at least 1 hectare of rural land revegetated and
   restored to productivity for each person living on the site.
   
   Roof gardens provide places to relax, grow food and nourish
   neighbourliness. Solar power heats the water and generates most of the
   electricity whilst gas is used for cooking and back-up heating and
   power. Stormwater is collected and used, grey water is filtered and
   re-used. There are some composting toilets to ensure that not all the
   nutrient value of human effluent goes down the drain and a local
   bio-gas plant is proposed for the edge of the nearby parklands to
   close the ecological loop, capturing the nutrient value of sewage and
   putting the energy value of methane into the gas pipes for the whole
   city.
   
   More-of-the-same, business-as-usual is being challenged by a community
   driven development and there is nowhere else, to our knowledge, where
   the issues are being addressed as comprehensively as in the Halifax
   EcoCity Project.

Star Trek : Commercialism and product recognition
by Jocelyn J. Paquette
 
 
When does an event or product reach into the social consciousness of every day
life?  Some of us will see a lovely moon and call it a Honeymooners' moon.  Others
can hear a few bars of a jingle and know the product that is being sold, "Its so
nice to have a man around the house".  Alright those are really old examples. 
After all we were much more naive then and too young to know when we were being
conditioned to recognize a theme, an insignia, a product.  After thirty years of
television syndication, 7 motion pictures, hundreds of comics books, novels, toys
STAR TREK has incorporated itself into our understanding of the world around us.
 
You may not have attended one START TREK convention but if you watched television
you were reintroduced to the presence of ST in several sitcoms.  During the past
three decades many have used the popular show for laughs.  "Wayne and Shuster" were
one of the first to have a fun with the characters of Kirk and Spock.  Showing
these two fictional beings in a quandary over some alien attack made them in the
end seem more real than caricatures.  
 
"The Simpsons" open an episode with the bridge of the Enterprise and the white
haired and heavy set Kirk sitting in his captain's chair wondering what the heck he
was doing there.  "Taxi" had the spaced out Jim talk about the cancellation of the
show as a tragic mistake.  All to say that STAR TREK had reached the core of
popular culture.  
 
"Beam me up Scotty!" is not just a command given to the Engineer of the Enterprise
but a drink in many bars.  The Starfleet uniforms, lunch boxes, stickers, posters,
cups, collector plates all indicate the need by consumers to possess some of what
STAR TREK is.  
 
Over the last 30 years ST has broken social and television taboos. The first
interracial kiss, in "Bread and Circuses" (OST 1967) was to be remembered and
celebrated as the boldest attempt to bring about positive change. Equality, 
opportunity and equity were concepts little referred to and much less heard from on
television. 
 
STAR TREK was the first television show to have spin offs running simultaneously as
the syndicated reruns.  The Next Generation, though considered at first to be a
risk proved to be the bridge between the new and old fans around the world.  It was
during their last season that not only did TNG have their new and rerun episodes
running but Deep Space Nine was introduced in the same season.  To recap you could
catch episodes of the original Star Trek, The Next Generation, first run and reruns
and Deep Space Nine somewhere on your television set everyday.  Now that's
entertainment.
 
Star Trek fans have come in every cultural, economic, social group.  Look at the
list of guest stars of The Next Generation and you can see some of the brightest
and best minds in our universe.  Think the BIG BANG THEORY and you have the guest
who appears with Benjamin Franklin and Einstein in the opening scene of "Descent,
Part I" (TNG 1993)  Stephen Hawking recognized as one of the greatest minds in our
world today was a fan and wanted to experience the Enterprise first hand.  Whoopi
Goldberg soon after The next Generation was introduced asked to be a guest only to
become a popular recurring member of the crew.  As the mysterious being who managed
Ten Forward, Guinan was the most interesting bartender anyone had ever known.
 
Finally, recognition is the return of characters you knew and loved.  In the first
episode "Encounter at Farpoint" Admiral Leonard McCoy gives a send off to the
Enterprise 1701 D.  Spock the enigmatic Vulcan creates the same aura of mystery and
excitement in "Unification I and II" (TNG 1991).  And what could the Enterprise do
without an engineer.  Scotty, trapped in a transporter for 75 years saves himself
only to be brought out by the engineer of the Enterprise D. (TNG 1992)  Captain
Montgomery Scott brings home the lesson that life is full of surprises for those
looking to live it.  Jonathan Frakes took on directorial duties while filling the
role of Number One to Jean-Luc Picard's Enterprise.  A regular on The Next
Generation it is in "Defiant" (DSP 1995) that we gain insight into the workings of
Tom Riker, the double to William T. Riker who was created through a malfunction of
the transporter on the planet Nervala IV.  
 
These individual performances bring to the series a unifying integrity seldom
enjoyed in "pin offs".  The STAR TREK universe can be difficult to manage even
appreciate.  Some would say the series have become entities with lives of their
own.  But it is one person who remains and continues to bring the meaning of the
lesson that is STAR TREK.  Tying everything together is Majel Barrett who more than
anyone ties the first four of the five series (OST, OST ANITEDS, TNG, DS9 and
Voyager) of the last thirty years into one coessive whole.  As nurse Chapel, (OST)
Doctor Chapel, (ST: THE MOTION PICTURES) Lwaxana Troi (TNG and DS9) or the voice of
the computer on The Next Generation.  It might be said as Gene Roddenberry's widow
Ms Barrett has held the thread of STAR TREK close at hand since its beginnings.
 
The Great Bird of the Galaxy knew if we could create a universe where people were
invited to create, participate and present a space where "No ONE HAD GONE BEFORE"
television viewers would take it into their homes and share the stories.  And what
stories they have been.
 
NEXT WEEK: STAR TREK and THIRTY YEARS OF STORYTELLING
 
 
 
ACTION PLAN:
 
Exposing Mc Donald's Lies
 
Mc Donald's misleading advertising and ' environmentally friendly ' 
public image disguise the truth about their immoral practices.  Englands 
longest standing libel courtcase ( 2 English people being sued and sueing 
Mc Donalds over the content of a anti-McDonalds pamplet) is uncovering 
the truth about their degredation of the planet, product content, poor 
treatment of workers, misleading adveritising and inhumane treatment of 
animals.
 
Ruining your Health
 
Despite Mc Donalds claims about the healthiness of their food, according 
to Mc Donalds nutrition consultant Verner Wheelock, Mc Donalds products 
are " high in salt, saturated fat and sodium " The damaging effects of 
making Mc Donalds part of your diet are left out of their nutrition 
guides and misleading advertising. When asked to comment on the 
statement " A diet high in fat, sugar, animal products and salt and low 
in fibre, vitamins and minerals is linked with cancer of the breast and 
bowel and heart disease " Mc Donalds expert witness on cancer, Dr Sidney 
Arnott, said  " it was a very reasonable thing to say. " This statement 
had been made in the original Mc Libel pamphlett. ( 
http://www.interlog.com/~tva/mclibel.html#diet ) In countries where Mc 
Donalds is now becoming part of the diet these medical problems are 
developing.
 
Killing the Environment and Starving the 3rd World
 
Methane emitted from cattle reared from the beef industry and 
deforestation are a major cause of the ' global warming ' crisis.  
(http://www.oneworld.org/news/nutshell_greenhouse.html) Every year Mc 
Donald's produce thousands of tonnes of unnneccessary packaging much of 
which ends up littering our streets or dumped in ever growing landfills. 
 
Mc Donalds are greatly contributing to a major ecological catastrophe.  
Over the years they have forced the tribal rainforest people off their 
ancestoral territories and contributed to the hunger of 3rd world 
people.  Half of Brazil's people suffer from hunger because " soya beans 
have not been sold or distributed to the people.  But ... (sic )used for 
export where it will be fed to Mc Donalds cattle, " In the process 
thousands of people are resettled into the amazonas and the rainforest 
land is destroyed.  ( Siegfried Pater, 3rd World Environmental Expert )
 
Mc Donalds are still obtaining some of their grazing land from the lush 
forest of Brazil.  According to Robert Morganti, the director of Mc 
Donalds Brazilian hamburger manufacturers, Braso Ltd, they are still 
obtaining their beef from along the River Araguaia and its tributaries.  
Mc Donalds have been clearing the amazon for more than 20 years.
 
Mc Donalds have said that their beef comes from the countries were it is 
bought, not the rainforest.  However, " North America imports one-third 
of all of the beef in the world according to Howard Lyman, Animal and 
Grain Farmer 1963 - 1983 ) He said " after it ( beef ) clears any border 
inspection it is treated with the samelabel as domestic production and in 
most cases, even the beef handlers couldn't identify where the product 
was produced. "
 
According to Ann Link, paper bleaching expert, dioxins and 
organochlorides, in the 14, 000 tonnes of bleached wood pulp used by Mc 
Donalds, toxins and long lasting organochlorides are produced.  These 
chemicals have been found in people and animals world wide, from the 
Antartic to the Arctic.  The paper bleaching produces know carcinegens 
and mutagens and chemicals which help deplete the ozone layer.  ( Green 
Peace Guide to Paper & Sanitary Protection scandal ) Mc Donalds, will 
only improve their packaging with increased consumer pressure.  " If 
reusable packaging becomes an issue in a community, it would have a major 
impact on the way we do business. " ( Mc Donalds Europe vs. Disposable 
meeting 21st Jan 1991 )
 
Animal Abuse
 
Intensively raised chickens, like those used at Mc Donalds, grow so fast 
that they can not support their own weight.  According to the Agriculture 
and Food Research Council, more than half have developed serious bone 
defects at 6 weeks of age.  
 
According to Journalist James Erlichman ( Consumer Affairs for the 
Guardian ), Mc Donalds London HQ " finally elicited an admission that 
growth promoting antiobiotics are fed to young cattle. "
 
According to Clare Druce, Poultry Welfare Researcher, many of Mc Donalds 
broiler sheds do not fulfill levels required by the law in the Welfare of 
Livestock ( Intensive Units ) Regulation Act 1978.  She refers to them as 
being " dimmly lit, inadequately ventilated, filthy litter (sic) 
overcrowded and impossible to be able to properly inspect. "
 
Howard Lyman, Animal and Grain Farmer 1963 - 1983, said " Animal 
husbandry today is only concerned with economics.  The comfort and 
welfare of the animals is only important if there is the chance that the 
animals will fail to achieve marketibility...I have seen cases where 
large numbers of animals have died from drowning, suffocation, freezing, 
disease and starvation because the ewre restricted the freedom to move to 
shelter... These occurences are never reported to the general public 
becasue they would cause a tremendous backlash against the current 
system. "
 
Innapropriate treatment of Workers
 
Mc Donalds workers recieve low wages.  Mc Donald's do not pay overtime 
reates even when employees work very long hours.  Pressure to keep profit 
high and wage costs lowresults in understaffing, so that staff have to 
work harder and faster and as a consiquence accidents particularly burns 
are common.  Staff turnover at Mc Donalds is high, therefore forming 
unions to fight for better conditions is difficult.
 
Advertising Lies
 
Mc Donalds advertising targets children.  All the gimmicks, routines and 
parties are used to seduce children into eating, unhealthy and overpriced 
food and put pressure on parents.  A Food Commission Survey asked 
eighty-seven eight year olds in 1990, " Who would you like to have take 
you out for a treat ? " ' Tony Tiger and Ronalds McDonald were more 
popular than the childrens fathers, teachers or grandparents, according 
to Sue Gibbs of the Food Commission an independent non-profit consumer 
organisation.
( http://www.mcspotlight.org/people/winesses/advertising/dibb_sue.html)   
 
Mc Donalds advertising in the past has been in breach of the Texas 
Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Mc Donalds advertising which present the 
food as nutritious were labelled deceptive and illegal both as a whole 
and in certain specifics, According to Stephen Gardner, Assistant 
Attorney General, Texas 1984 - Dec 1991.  A Food Commision study found 
that Mc Donalds were the second most highly advertised food product in 1992.
 
We can make Change
 
Our consumer society of which Mc Donalds are a key figure keeps millions 
of people living in poverty. The worlds richest fifth consume 83 % of the 
wealth, the poorest fifth die on 1.5%.  Ironically the media show poverty 
in 3rd World Countries, and follow with Mc Donalds advertisements.  The 
Mc Donalds lifestyle encourages greed and selfishness and keeps the 3rd 
world poor.  Big Bussiness kills variety and puts money in the hands of 
the rich and away from small traders.
 
     Change comes from individuals joinig one by one.  We dont have to 
eat Mc Donalds, or from other chains, who have similiar ethics.  Ethical 
choices prolong the quality of our world.  More information can be found 
on the net, http://www.mcspotlight.org/index2.html  The McLibel 2, have 
insipered many people to think about their choices. A lifetime of 
disscussion is likely to change the lives of millions.
 
 
This was forwarded to me by a Canadian friend, please pass it on,
publish, bill post it , etc.
 
I didn't write it but wish I had. I therefore to not deserve any credit 
for it and would like anonymity.
