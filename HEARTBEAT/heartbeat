My Words:
 
 
               This is the first edition of Heartbeat an examination of our
mediated world both within and without the Net.  Heartbeat seeks
the alternative but not through reaction to the dismal sameness
of the Disnefied, Time-Warner mcWorld that continues to creep
outward.
               We will explore the worlds of television, videos, books,
magazines and movies both mainstream, and alternative trying to
sift the ideas out of the propaganda.
               It is possible that the Internet is one of the last
frontiers we have left and it is slowly being colonized. 
Fortunately, this digital territory can continue to grow without
disrupting the physical ecosystems it inhabits.
               The Internet is not the only frontier. We have not ventured
far inward into our deepest being.  This is a vast and only
marginally explored terrain.
 
 
Straight From The Heart:
               
               Images, images everywhere and not a space to think.  There
are no wild spaces left, spaces where the Machine has not yet
woven its glossy spell. 
               Our culture is a commodity, consumed every minute of every
day both awake and asleep for the soundbytes and photops filter
through your dream world and even shape your fantasies. Do you
long for an unique experience, an experience that you and you
alone direct?  Do you even believe that such an experience is
possible or possibly desirable?
               The digitization of reality has created a global village but
the villagers are only marginally aware that they have shifted
through time and space and now inhabit a place both greater and
smaller than before.
 
 
 
 
    Video Review:  SEVEN.
 
               I'm an avid videophile, I love movies but, primarily,
because movie theatres have shrunk to living-room-sized boxes and
screens have diminished capacity, I prefer to watch them at home,
on my TV via my VCR. I'm not interested in catching this
weekend's boxoffice blast. I'll see it when the video is released
sometime within the next month.
               True, I'll miss the effect of the fx but I'll get an
opportunity to see if the actors can act and if there's a plot or
at least something to keep my interest beside the product
placements and explosions.
               I rented Seven from my corner store, the selection is small
but changes regularly and the owner brings in vids you want to
see,just ask.  Besides it's a single owner operation and not part
of some space gobbling chain.
               To the point, this is a bad movie, no stars, thumbs up ,
down or sideways. Some good acting by Morgan Freeman and Brad
Pitt, a predictable ending, a dull bad guy who has planned the
most outlandish, obscene performance art piece do not a movie
make. This pic is a woman-bashing, lets frighten the folks fest.
I'm not giving away the plot, you can rent it yourself but from
where I sit, it's a waste of good cash.
 
 
                       Thirty Years of STAR TREK and counting.

Gene Roddenberry's vision of a future for humankind would take decades, four
television and one animated series to evolve a universe where  individual diversity
was encouraged and rewarded.  Complex and simplistic in composition but highly fluid
in its intent, The Great Bird of the Galaxy, coined for the creator of Star Trek,
would weave a tapestry of "infinite diversity and infinite complexity" through
storytelling and action oriented hour long episodes.  
 
Trekkies as we call ourselves have dreamed, visited and relished in the place and
time that is the Star Trek universe without concern for viability or certainty.  The
voyages of the starship Enterprise began a journey for millions that would take us
centuries into the future and bring us face to face with our fears and hatreds, our
phobias and our ignorance.  Challenging the mores of the time is a legacy
Roddenberry gave to writers and producers and viewers of '60's television. This
inheritance continues to push the envelop of acceptability for family viewing. 
 
>From the first interracial kiss in "Plato's Children" (TOS 1968) to the notion of
freedom in society to sexual orientation in TNG "The Outcast" (TNG 1992).  We have
moved from childhood to adulthood in the past thirty years. Intimately linked to
these years of growth, experience and LIFE is a relationship that has spanned 30
years.  For the next few weeks, in recognition of our investment with Star Trek, I
will pursue aspects of the social phenomenon that is Star Trek; exploring some of
the diversity and complexity which has entertained and inspired us. The topics I
will cover include, Conflict and Resolution / Commercialism and product
identification / Thirty Years of Storytelling in Star Trek. 
  
 
CONFLICT and RESOLUTION
 
Mirrored with our world the Star Trek universe introduces us to life in outerspace,
a future uncertain and frightening, exciting and mysterious.  Adversity challenges
us to meet challenges or so Captain Kirk liked to say.  Enter the Neutral Zone and
the delicate "Balance of terror" (1966) is struck.  Kirk, about to perform a
marriage ceremony for two members of Enterprise crew, Robert Tomlinson and Angela
Martine is interrupted by a call from the bridge.  Outpost 4 has just been attacked.
 
The Neutral Zone, created to be a buffer between the Federation and the Romulans, is
dangerous territory. For the Federation the source of the danger can only be the
Romulans.  
 
Prejudice and hatred is displayed by Lieutenant Stiles and Kirk responds with zero
tolerance for Stiles' attitudes.  Spock the vulcan officer, who is from an ancient
culture that linked the Romulans and Vulcans, is attacked by Stiles who latter comes
to acknowledge his prejudice and accepts that the feelings  stemmed from his
ignorance and racial hatred.  
 
In "The Day of the Dove" (TOS 1968) Klingons and Federation crews are introduced to
an entity that lives on hatred and emotional excitation.  The fighting causes wounds
and death but it is only temporary.  Soon you rise from fatal injuries and must
carry on the assault to the amusement of the non corporal instigator.  Only together
do the crews defeat their enemy returning to their adversarial relationship with a
new found respect.     
 
But remember we are out in space where infinite diversity and infinite combination
exist.  What happens when you arrive in a alternative universe where lying,
backstabbing and corrupt leaders rule with fear and violence. In "Mirror, Mirror"
(TOS 1967) a transporter accident brings Kirk, Scott, McCoy and Uhura into the
Galactic Empire.  Assassination is the best way to move up the ranks.  Spock-2, the
counter part to our Mr. Spock is the one voice of reason who Kirk can tell of the
"other universe" and what can be accomplished when you replace anarchy with
progress.  It is understood that to arrive at this societal change Spock-2 will have
to eliminate Kirk-2 upon Kirk-2's return to the Galactic Enterprise .  
 
Who is a war criminal and why should we pursue them is a theme in "The Conscience of
the King" (TOS 1966).  We are introduced to a frail old man and his beautiful
charming daughter who dotes on her father.  In managing the Karidian Players theatre
group who perform traditional Shakespearean plays the father daughter travel the
galaxy performing on starbases and outposts.  In order that we not miss the point of
the episode the play they perform for the crew is Macbeth.  Is this broken down old
actor KODOS the Executioner?  Can the past be rewritten and your future redrawn in
order to start a new.  Anton Karidian is about to be arrested for his crimes when
the actor is accidentally killed by his daughter who has been executing people who
could identify him as KODOS. She is mentally ill and is sent to a care facility. 
Justice is to be sought and pursued at all cost.     
 
To boldly go were no one has gone before means we meet an army of soldiers that are
trained to kill and then come home to disdain and fear.  That is how a group of men
are treated when they are ostracized and isolated from their own community. 
Displaced and housed in a colony away from polite society the soldiers attack their
city and demand their rights as human beings "The Hunted" (TNG 1990) reminds us of
our own treatment of soldiers and their place in our own definition of ourselves. 
An embarrassment or a resource?  Do the protectors receive recognition for their
efforts or do we fear them?  Whether it was the Vietnam War or the Gulf War soldiers
experienced alienation and contempt.  Are we facing the reality of the new era in
peacekeeping or warfare?

  WILDFLOWER SEEDS
  LANDLIFE WILDFLOWERS
 
       
      
       In the past 45 years, Britain has lost a great deal of it's
       wildflower heritage. By sowing wildflowers you can help to put
       something back; however habitat creation should never be a
       substitute for preserving the real thing. Use wildflower seeds and
       plants to create new types of habitats, for habitat restoration,
       in derelict land schemes, community woodlands, road schemes and
       country parks.
       
       For the past 15 years Landlife has been sowing wildflowers in
       urban areas. This has served to create nature sites in urban areas
       and preserving native wildflowers. These areas are cropped
       annually and supply the seeds for Landlife's trading arm -
       Landlife Wildflowers.
       
       We supply wildflower seeds all over the UK. Our customers range
       from local authorities, private landscape contractors to
       individuals. All our seeds are native in origin. We are at present
       working on a provenancing scheme for the regional variations in
       species.

ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT or how I found my way in TV and MOVIE LAND
 
On every night Monday to Friday come rain or come shine.  Hosts always smiling with
teeth you could read with in a total eclipse, you've got to love that.  The reality
is that millions of people every night tune in to ET to touch base, be touched or
just to feel plugged into what is happening OUTTHERE.  Okay, so what is it that
excites and titillates the viewers.  First, you start with movie critics that never
critique, everything is great, or interesting, or just plain wonderful. These films
you would not take your favourite demented criminal to endure because there are laws
protecting the criminally insane.  Secondly, you get to peek at the hottest,
strangest, most ornate, outrages rituals Hollywood has to offer and notables like
cigar-chopping Arnold and the former Princess Diana let you be a voyeur.  Actors
tell all books are sold and marketed while you watch.  Anything promoted by actors
from batteries to diets, from clothing for the full figured woman to the latest
Sports Illustrated bathing suit issue are flogged, pumped, hyped and delivered into
your home every night in order that you feel connected to the world.  Not so bad an
exchanged when you consider you only invest one half hour five times a week.  So
what if what you hear is uncritical, non-analytical dialogue justifying the waste,
the excess of what we call product surplus.  Now I'm not saying ET is not doing a
great job.  Forget your troubles and have an intimate conversation with Kim
Bassinger and Alex Baldwin and learn what makes a baby happen.  Kick up your heals
and celebrate the success of Independence Day after all your $8.50 ticket pushed
them over last weekend.  And we all know that those openings like the Planet
Hollywood with Demi and Bruce simply lost your invitation so you can be included in
the activities from the comfort of your own home.
