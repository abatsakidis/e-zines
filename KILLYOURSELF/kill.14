THE LATEST NEWS

Calls are coming into the offices of Gingrich and Dole at a good clip.
However we believe the conferees are now debating the fate of the net.
As the Conference Committee goes home for Thanksgiving recess, we need
to keep the pressure on.

Call Congress now and tell them that parental empowerment not government
censorship is the only effective means to addressing childrens' access
to objectionable content on the Internet.  Don't wait.  The stakes here
are too high.

Please look below at the list of legislators and call the home offices
of the legislators in your state.  Please do not call legislators at
home.  Please do not send email to them (it will not be effective).

ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿

WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

1. Most of the proposals available to the conference committee will
   fundamentally restrict your speech on the Internet and other public
   networks.  Look at the list below and call the legislators in your
   state and ask them not to censor the net.  If none of them are in
   your state, call Gingrich and Dole at their home offices.

   If we cannot convince the conference committee to make the right
   choices at this juncture, we will have lost this campaign.

   If you're at a loss for words, try one of the following:

        Please oppose the unconstitutional proposals in the Telecomm
        Deregulation bill that would censor the Internet.  The only
        effective way to address children's access to objectionable
        material on the Internet is through parental control tools
        not government censorship outlined by the Cox/White/Wyden
        approach.

        May I please have an appointment to come and talk with the legislator
        or someone on staff about these issues?

   or
        As a religious person and a parent, I oppose the unconstitutional
        Internet censorship language currently attached to the Telecomm
        Deregulation bill.  I am the best person to monitor my
        child's access to the Internet using parental control tools
        as outlined in the Cox/White/Wyden approach.

        May I please have an appointment to come and talk with the legislator
        or someone on staff about these issues?
   or
        Although there is information on the Internet that I wouldn't
        allow my children to see, I don't agree with the proposals
        in the Telecomm Deregulation bill that would censor the Internet.
        As a parent, I have parental control tools, such as those
        encouraged in the Cox/White/Wyden approach available to me that
        are far more effective at controlling my children's access to the
        Internet than censorship laws will be.

        May I please have an appointment to come and talk with the legislator
        or someone on staff about these issues?

   Send mail to vtw@vtw.org and let us know how it went.

        $ Mail vtw@vtw.org
        Subject: phoned Congressman XXX

        They thanked me for my opinion and I'll be meeting with a staff
        member on Friday morning, and the legislator may drop in too!

2. If one of the legislators above is yours, please make an appointment
   to see them or one of their staff in the home office as soon as possible
   to express your concerns about this legislation.

   As background information, you should ensure that you read the
   Internet Parental Control FAQ and the Communications Decency Act
   FAQ found at URL:http://www.vtw.org/.  Also, send mail to
   volunteer@vtw.org and a coordinator will phone you before the
   meeting to give you some tips on running an effective meeting with
   a legislator or staff member.

3. If you run any sort of system that allows a welcome message for all
   users, please add the following:

       The Religious Right is attempting to shut down the net by passing
       legislation that would make services like this one liable
       for what you say on the internet now; for more info
       URL:http://www.vtw.org/ or send mail to
       files@vtw.org with "send alert" in the subject line. (11/20/95)

   If you have a Web page that gets a lot of traffic, please add the
   following link:

        <a href="http://www.vtw.org/">
        Stop the Religious Right from shutting down online free
        speech! (11/8/95)</a>

4. Join the online fight by becoming a volunteer for your district!

   If your legislator is in the list above, please send mail to
   volunteer@vtw.org to volunteer to be a representative for your
   district.

5. We can't suggest relaxing at this point.  The stakes are too high, and
   the risk is too great.  Everything now hangs in the balance.

LEGISLATIVE HISTORY

We are near the end of this year's campaign.  Congress has passed four
different bills, all aimed at regulating your communications on the
Internet.  They range from deregulation proposals that empower parents
to control their children's access to the net (HR1978 "Cox/Wyden/White")
to overly-regulatory proposals that "dumb down" the level of all Internet
content to that which is acceptable to children. (the HR1555 Managers
Amendment).  You can see a synopsis of each of these in VTW's BillWatch
#13 at URL:http://www.vtw.org/billwatch/issue.13.html

Were the conference committee to simply throw this all into the kettle
and pass it all, it would be terrible.  However, several groups considered
to be part of the "Religious Right" urged the conference committee to pass
an even more restrictive proposal which would:

-Make internet providers, online services, and libraries criminally liable
 for expression online.
-Create a standard for criminalizing "indecency" online, dumbing down
 every Web page, newsgroups, discussion forum, and chat system.
-Give the FCC jurisdiction over speech in cyberspace and software that
 might be used to filter children's access to the net.

This proposal was signed by representatives from the Christian Coalition,
the Concerned Women of America, the American Family Association, Eagle
Forum, the Traditional Values Coalition, and Morality in Media.

For a full analysis of the Religious Right's proposal, and a copy of their
proposed legislation and their letter to the Conference Committee, see
the alert at URL:http://www.vtw.org/alerts/

Alternatively, representatives from large and small businesses and public
interest organizations recently sent letters to Congress asking them not
censor the Internet.  In addition, a collection of conservative groups
that advocate restricting childrens' access to the Internet through
parental control instead of government censorship recently sent a letter
to Congress as well.  Here's where to find them:

The letter from large industry businesses can be found at:
URL:http://www.cdt.org/policy/freespeech/1109_iwg_ltr.html
The letter from small businesses can be found at:
URL:http://www.vtw.org/cdaletter/
The letter from the conservative groups can be found at:
URL:http://www.cdt.org/policy/freespeech/cons_110795_ltr.html
The letter from the advocacy organizations can be obtained by
sending mail to infoaclu@aclu.org with "organizations opposed
to online censorship" in the subject line of your message.

At this time, the conference committee is still debating the issue.
Advocates of business and free speech are contacting Congress.

I really can't believe more people aren't talking about this... I am on a
mailing list (riot-l) which sends out newswire stories about various
strikes, riots, civil wars, etc. happening around the world.  Well, last
week, I got three stories on the 14-16 about student strikes in France.

Apparently, students had been pretty pissed about the what the rightist
government has been up to (similar to the 'Contract with America') for
over a month since school started, but last week, it flared up.  Each
day, the movement grew, and more and more universities went on strike.
Thousands of students took to the streets, blocking Euro-disney among
other things.  The opposition labor unions have called for a general strike
on the 28th, and it sounds like the students are taking to streets by
the thousand this week.  I haven't heard any specifics since last Thursday,
but I bet things have continued to snowball.

This has the potential of being bigger than '68 when the government was
almost toppled (they failed largely due to the government and the Communists
succeeding in dividing the students and workers, but now the students and
workers are working together).

What needs to be done is for students all around the world to make contact
with the students and workers in France and spread the word, agitating for
student strikes everywhere in solidarity with the French students and against
our own systems.

It seems the 'mainstream' press is aware of the fact that publicizing
student unrest in one country can lead to student unrest in other countries,
because there has been ZERO coverage in the U.S. as far as I can tell.
This story has been blocked even more effectively than the Zapatistas in
Mexico, and it is potentially much more significant.

Well there was talk of expulsion, which I think is extreme, but they decided
not to. How cab you boot someone for their opinion? Educate them first, which
is exactly what they are going to do. A sensitivity course is not such a bad
idea. These aren't even remotely funny. They are simply in bad taste.

                       WHO IS ROBERT W. HOWINGTON?

          I'm a 35-year-old government worker who hopes to win the
          Texas Lotto so that I don't ever have to work at a shitty
          job ever again. In my spare time, I publish DRIVE-BY BOOKS
          and BROADSIDES. There are eight of each and all the
          books, except #8 which is $3, are $2 cash/m.o./trade and $1
          gets you all the b'sides. I've published many underground
          legends, including Charles Bukowski, Lyn Lifshin, Todd
          Moore, Steve Richmond, Kurt Nimmo, Bill Shields, Cheryl A.
          Townsend, Paul Weinman, ron androla, Gerald Locklin, William
          Packard (editor of THE NEW YORK QUARTERLY) and many, many
          more fantastic poets and writers who're all ignored by the
          mainstream publishers.  My wife, Crista C.  Williams,
          publishes the notorious underground litmag HAPPY KITTY.  A
          sample copy of it can be had for $2 cash/m.o. We can both be
          reached at 4405 Bellaire Drive South #220, Fort Worth, TX
          76109-5103, USA, or at robert.howington@chrysalis.org

          As for me I've had a chapbook of poems and two short stories
          translated into German by Ariel-Verlag called K.O. im
          Copyshop. I've had a chapbook of poems, JUST ANOTHER MENACE
          TO SOCIETY (Penny Dreadful Press, Nashville, TN) and
          short stories, SPIKED SLURPEE (Undulating Bedsheets
          Productions, LA, CA), published. I also won the 1994 Charles
          E. Hanna Literary Award, judged by the Texas Christian
          University (Fort Worth, TX) English Chair, with the poem A
          WOMAN I KNOW AT WORK. I've had poems and short stories in
          such mags as THE NEW YORK QUARTERLY, THE WORMWOOD REVIEW,
          ATOM MIND, So it goes... (an e-zine), AH POOK IS HERE
          (England), THE MOWER (Germany), SIVULLINEN (Finland) and
          over 100 others.


          PISS ON THIS.

          Written on the urinal stall in the
          men's room at POOR DAVID'S PUB in
          Dallas and among the crudely drawn
          hard-ons and child-like scribbled
          phone numbers of people offering sex
          to those that have the money to pay
          for it, there was somebody's opinion
          regarding prayer in the schools. I
          read it while relieving myself. It
          stated, "There will always be prayer
          in school if they keep giving math
          tests."


          WE'RE ALL GOING DOWN.

          I just saw an
          anti-smoking ad
          on tv. It said,
          "You smoke. You
          die."

          Excuse me, but
          I think these
          people should
          go back to the
          very beginning
          where it says,
          "You born. You
          die."


          ANOTHER POEM WRITTEN
          ON COMPANY TIME.

          Jesus, the philosopher (I don't
          call him the Son of God, but
          that's another poem), once told
          his fans, "For the wages of sin
          is death."

          I sit here at my desk at work,
          a career paper pusher for Uncle
          Sam, thinking I'd much rather
          plunder, rape, murder, pillage,
          fuck, gamble and consume drugs
          24-7-365 than work 8-to-5 for
          40 years in a boring office,
          plus be a goody two shoes the
          whole time, and fucking die
          anyway.


          THE FIRST TIME I DIED.

          When Julie, my first wife, stood in
          the bedroom's doorway and said she
          didn't love me anymore her words tore
          through me like bullets.

          I  sat on the edge of our bed holding
          myself tight where it hurt, my head
          hung low, tears spilling out of my eyes.

          The pain was so bad I was thinking I
          wished I was dead.

          I didn't know it then but I had already
          died.

          The tears were a rebirth.

        The story that is about to be told is a true story! The names have
been changed to protect the innocent. The main character of the story was
five when it took place and is now the age of fifteen.
        Zowie was born 1980 and lived in Columbus, Ohio. She had a babysitter
who lived down the street. This is where she spent the greater part of each
day. At the age of five Zowie had long blond hair and big blue eyes. She had
a good life, lots of friends, nice parents, and a great older sister who she
looked up to. Though her family was ideal they were all blind to the evil
she put up with every day.
        Now, Zowie can only remember a few incidents, but she knew these were
not the only ones. Zowie's family was the only white family in the 'hood'
and this is the only reason that Zowie could come up with with as to why she
was the only one who was molested by her babysitter's son, Ander.
        Her actual babaysitter was nice and always had sweets for the kids to
eat, yet going there for Zowie was the beginning of a neverending nightmare.
Ander, the molester, was adopted and always had many problems. And because he
was black and Zowie was a young white girl who was extremely vulnerable he
took them out on her.
        She knew subconciously that what he was doing was wrong, but she
didn't have the power to stop him. It came unexpected. When she was taking a
nap he'd come into her room and pull down her pants. In the car he'd force
her to put her hand in his pocket, where he had ever so cleverly cut holes
in his pocket. He'd make her touch, squeeze and stroke anything he wanted her
to, while she sat with tears in her eyes.
        To this day, Zowie remembers these times with unwanted vividness. She
said that what bothers her the most is that she can't remember what happened
before the age of five. When asked what she would do if she ever saw him
again, she said she'd ask him why then punch him in the stomach. She has
never told her parents. She knows they can't change the past. And it would
only put a great deal of guilt upon them. She's telling me because people go
through life without ever realizing that someone you think you know so well
has put up with so much shit.

        What is it that makes a redneck? There are so many different things
that come together to make a redneck, and it's just amazing how easy it is to
spot one. Is it the old beat-up car? Is it the flannel shirt and tight jeans?
Is it the long hair (male OR female)?
        The easiest way to spot a redneck is by the vehicular mode of
transportation. Either it's an old, beat-up rusting hunk of metal with a
tailpipe dragging behind it, or it's a nicely kept old car with a souped-up
442 or something like that. Either car makes a lot of noise, and both are
easy to spot. I don't know why the beat-up cars share that common tri-color
paint scheme, and most of the time it's not paint, it's primer. And the
souped-up cars, why is the rear of the car jacked up? They've always got
these big, fat tires and the wheels will be jacked up about a foot off of the
ground. I've always thought this to be a waste of time since it raises the
car's center of gravity and makes it much more difficult to take corners. I
guess that doesn't matter much since they spend most of their time cruising
up tand down the street looking for some fresh junior-high school 'women' to
pick up on, which brings me to my next point.
        Why it it that there are so many redneck men in their mid-twenties
with girlfriends that are about 16 years old? I've seen that alot in this
little redneck town that I love in. I've heard of 20 year old guys seeing 15
year old junior high girls and stuff. It surprises the hell out of me. I don't
understand it and I can't  figure it out. Is it because these girls remind
them of their sisters? That's the only thing I can think of.
        Another universal redneck fact is that a majority of red necks have
sex in their back seats. Is there something about back seats that I am missing?
I can't stand just sitting in most back seats, but to have sex in the back
seat? I know that there are non-rednecks that have had sex in their back seats,
but the ratio of rednecks having some of that back seat action to other people
doing it is about 25,000:1. Well, I guess if you're that horny and you've got
to do it, any place is comfortable.
        I've also noticed that rednecks seem to share a common bond as far as
clothing goes. The norm is something like a flannel shirt, tight jeans, some
old torn up boots or shoes, and a mesh baseball cap. Did they all get together
and plan this at a Klan rally or something? I'm still amazed at the
similarities in clothing that all of the rednecks share. And their jeans will
have that cool ring on their back pockets where their can of chew has been
for the last 5 years. I don't know, I just don't know about the rednecks.
Don't even mention mobile homes. Don't get me wrong though, I've seen many a
nice mobile home park, and there are some nice people living in a lot of these
places. But I'm talking about those parks where's there's about 5 fet between
each trailer, a dog (or 5) is leashed up to every one of them, all of the kids
are running around either nekkid, or pretty damned close to it. "Hey bitch,
what cha cookin' tonight?" asks a 28 year old voice. "We're having spam and
tuna, honey," replies a 16 year old voice. I'm glad that tornadoes strike
mobile homes so much, I consider it population control for rednecks.
Rednecks really make me sick. I wonder what they think? I know that they are
not on the same train of thought that the rest of the world is. I remember
riding by a truck with one of my punk friends, and all of the sudden I hear
something barking from within the truck. I seriously thought it was dog until
I heard my friend yelling at the truck. As it turns out, it was a couple of
rednecks barking at my friend because he had on a chain around his neck. I
guess that's another universal redneck thing since that was the second time
within a couple of days that rednecks had barked at him.
Something muct be done about rednecks. There must be a Klan out there against
rednecks. They should all be strung up! I think there should be an annual
trailer tipping night or something, that oughta really piss them off!

Write, write, write those letters to congress when you hear about an upcoming

they can get what they feel they deserve and always maintain the highest
