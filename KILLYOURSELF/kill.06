º There are alot of problems within this country, hell this planet. Everyoneº
º knows what they are. But I don't want to hear them in the form of a       º
º complaint. Here, we hope to show the problem in a form of an explanation  º
º and not a complaint. Furthermore, we are doing what we can to provide     º
º solutions to these overwhelming problems. Suggestions, solutions, etc.    º
º are greatly needed. We don't have all the answers. We need solutions from º
º everywhere. We need unity. We need to get off our lint infested couches,  º
º get our fingers out of our asses and maybe, just maybe we can change a    º
º complaint into a suggestion and over time discontinue this zine because   º
º it's purpose will have been served.                                       º

PROBLEM 666 of 999
If drugs are your thing that's cool. But there's a point where you can't turn
back, just look around, there's bound to be that neo-hippie who's so bugged
out he can't think for himself. Or maybe he took some bad acid and never
got off the trip when he took it 6 months ago. I dunno, but how is someone
like that going to make any changes?

SOLUTION 666 of 999
At first I thought of creating something called the "Burnout the Burnouts 
Fund." This was a way of collecting enough money to buy all the burnouts 
hard drugs so they kill themselves off until I realized that, although 
there would be alot of supporters on both sides, I started talking to 
burnouts and realized that many of their opinions agree with mine and they 
do indeed have the power to stand up. Everyone can do it, and if they can't
you could be a good friend and commit them or send them to NA or AA or
whatever. But whatever you do, don't get the cops involved. That will fuck
someone for life and no one deserves that. Besides only rich people do that.

PROBLEM 7777777 of 7777777.7
You have been best friends for years now. You have been practically 
inseperable. Nothing could stand between you. You both started to grow up
so, naturally, you began to try new things. One of these things was pot.
You both started to smoke pot agressively. But then you decided it just 
isn't that fun anymore so you tell your best friend you have quit. Uh-oh.
You guys have always started and finished things together, this was no 
exception. Your friend slowly begins to drift away from you. 

SOLUTION 7777777 of 7777777.7
Jesus, not to say that I have a problem with pot, but in no means should 
drugs come before friends. Without friends what have you got? Sure pot can 
be great fun, but if you're going to smoke I sure as hell wouldn't wanna 
smoke alone, whether the rest of your party is smoking or not. Substances 
are much less important than friends. The more friends, the more ideas, the 
more creations, the more changes. Everyone is entitled to do what they will, 
if you're friend doesn't wanna smoke pot don't try to force it upon them and 
definately don't shun them. Is it that you feel they have gone too mainstream 
for you? Well that's bullshit because smoking pot has become a mainstream 
hobby so don't talk to me about what's trendy.

PROBLEM ^^# of ******
"That movie sucks. This band sucks. Who writes this crap?" So that's what they
say about your creation, your masterpiece, your work of art. You spent day and
night working on your piece but since they say it sucks it's back to the
drawing board - isn't that right?

SOLUTION ^^# of ******
Wrong. Don't give in. Don't take their word into consideration. It's their
opinion versus yours. Be more than glad to accept constructive criticism, but
don't I repeat, don't throw anything away, ever. You will regret it. Your
work of art is a work of art. Sure it sounds silly, but in the case the phrase
"Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder" is very valid.

TO CLOSE:
Sticks and stones hurt. Words hurt more. You can really do some extensive and
possibly terminal damage with verbal abuse. Use it to your advantage, but be
wise and forewarned. Saying the harshest thing just might KILL YOURSELF!
