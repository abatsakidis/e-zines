(Casey Casem calls 'zines the "alternative newspaper." If you have the same
 opinion, you need desparately to read this. In a way he does have a point,
 but most "hip" people see that as an insult, I know I do. We are for every-
 one, we don't focus on one clique or any clique. Everyone needs to be 
 involved. We are not "Rock the Vote," but we are making an attempt to unite
 the future decision makers of the world.)

--=>HEY MAN, WHY DO YOU CALL IT "KILL YOURSELF?" THAT'S OFFENSIVE!
    People suck, plain and simple. I hear it everyday, "oh my god, i have 
    split ends," or "i broke a nail," or "my teacher is giving me a B, what
    will I ever do?," or "he was making fun of me." Sure everyone has feel-
    ings and express them in a different way, but I don't wanna hear your
    bitching and complaining because I don't care. In addition, "why isn't 
    pot legal? that's so dumb," or "jesus, they should get rid of that law." 
    If you want that law to go away, peel your dingleberry ass off the love 
    seat and organize people, do something, anything. If you are that 
    concerned with losing fifty cents KILL YOURSELF!

PROBLEM 1 of 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000:  
  There is an abcense of unity. For example, you go to a punk show, or 
  some burn-out fest for "neo-hippies" who can't cope unless gonja is 
  present, and even though all these people have a common interest, 
  I mean they must because they're most likely there to see a band or 
  some shit, they don't seem to unite. You go to a show, and I do it too, 
  and you just hang out with the people you know, making fun of those who
  are probably really fucking cool. That's a problem. How do we fix it?

SOLUTION 1 of 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000:
  Let's see, I'm not some "god," I could be wrong, and if you don't agree
  with this, you tell me what the answer could be. But here's what I say:
  Next time you rip off the flier for the next big punk rock show and 
  put it up on your wall, prepare yourself for a journey through the 
  unknown, boldy go where no freak has gone before. Do the one thing you
  would never think of doing, just go up and say what's up, if you can do
  it with your chemistry lab partner you could do it with them. And if you're
  the one who this is happening to, don't be a prick or condesending or some
  shit, because you aren't better than them because your both at the same 
  punk rock show. The more friends, the better. You have maybe 10 friends,
  look at Hitler, he had thousands of people under him. I'm not saying that
  you should create a dictatorship, I am saying that the more friends, the
  more protection. If you don't get along with your real family, create an
  alternative.

PROBLEM 0678 of 3897498:
  Trend. Everywhere you look you're bound to find that R.E.M. invoked skin
  tight shirt with a big ugly heart on it. You'll always find that girl 
  who dyed her hair white to impersonate the lead singer of the cranberries. 
  There's always that one "alterna-teen" as they call it, who flips through
  Seventeen, Rolling Stone, Vibe, or any other mainstream teenage magazine
  looking for the latest styles from their favorite Top 20 band. 

SOLUTION 678 of 3897498:
  You don't have to look like a walking advertisement for Gap to be cool.  
  It seems that so many people need to dye their hair or whatever to express
  themselves. Sure it's art, and I like it, hell I have a leather jacket 
  with 400 studs and lots of painting on it. I like expression too, but at
  the same time, people feel that this is the only method of expression but
  it's not. How about writing a book or painting a picture, and if you can't
  do this try speaking to people, bible pushers do it, why can't we? There's
  nothing wrong with looking like a "freak" if you can back yourself up, if 
  you can spread your words of wisdom across this desensitized trash heap 
  called America.

PROBLEM 60 of 26:
  In no other "scene" have I seen a worse example of the following, unless
  you include gangs or some shit, than in the "punk scene." I like punk 
  rock, I like going to shows, I like the look, I'm into it. But I don't
  like "you like the grateful dead? what kinda punk are you?" or "I'm more
  punk because I have more tattoos, records, I've seen more shows, or 
  because I don't listen to that stupid new school shit."  

SOLUTION 60 of 26:
  Punk is punk, plain and simple. You don't have to have a mohawk. If you
  have to ask someone if you're a punker, I've got news for you...

PROBLEM 200 of 6003:
  I don't wash my hair for a few days at a time because it's less fluffy. It  
  bothers me when it's washed everyday. On the other hand, how about your 
  friend who says, "god, I haven't washed my hair or showered for a week" 
  when in reality he washes it once maybe twice a day or he who says, 
  "god I haven't washed my hair or showered for a week" and not because he 
  doesn't like washing his hair or smelling, he just wants to be different.

SOLUTION 200 of 6003:
  Jesus, if you have to be so different as to not wash your hair I think you
  are just way too cool for me. Expression can be conducted in so many more
  productive ways. No one cares if you haven't washed your hair since 1956,
  hell it's a good way to lose friends unless you're having some sort of 
  contest. Use your talents to your advantage, be something, because either
  telling people you haven't showered or simply not showering is no way to 
  get the recognition we all want. It's psychological and we all need it. 
  Don't deny compliments make you feel better inside, because they do no 
  matter how little you shower.

TO CLOSE:
  Greed. Materialism. Garbage. Which word doesn't fit? They all do. Don't be
  selfish. Be glad you've got what you've got because if you take advantage
  of your friends to get things you think you need, you'll end up with shit.
  And if this still doesn't make sense, KILL YOURSELF!
