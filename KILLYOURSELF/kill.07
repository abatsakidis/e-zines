PROBLEM 7899 of 9000
Software pirating is becoming a problem. With the loss of revenue from the
pirated software, some small companies are finding it hard to compete with the
bigger corporations.

SOLUTION 7899 of 9000
Copy Protection.  Copy protection is just plain useless. No copy protection
scheme has been made that can't be cracked.  From hardware locks to multiple
software checks, all it takes is a rerouting around the check and it's over
with. If anyone has any ideas of some foolproof copy protection, i'd like to
hear em. I doubt they exist. Sure, I pirate.  But I don't think it does the
economy any good either. It's hard to turn down a nice software package that
usually costs more than I can possibly afford when it's sittin there right in
front of me ready to be downloaded, but that doesn't make it right. By
pirating, say 3d studio, a program none of us can afford, we no longer find
any reason to purchase a cheaper product that does basically the same thing
(like many of the 3d rendering packages out there these days) and that doesn't
really hurt Autodesk (makers of 3d studio), it hurts those companies who put
out the cheaper, more affordable software.  If we put these smaller companies
out of business, all thats gonna be left are the big guys like microsoft etc...
and we know how much those products can cost...  That leads me back to copy
protection.  Copy protection is the key to keeping software prices down, but
I don't see any method that is actually foolproof. Me and a couple friends
are writing a game, to be put on CD for distribution, and if you have ANY
ideas for copy protection, it would be nice to show those big guys a thing
or 2...

PROBLEM 1200 of 21000
With attacks on affirmative action mounting across the country, the primary
vehicle being the Orwellian-named "Civil Rights" initiative in California,
organizing has begun early to challenge the racism of this new attack.

SOLUTION 1200 of 21000
A new e-mail list has been established to get information out about this
movement and news around the struggle for affirmative action to activists
across the country.  This is a moderated list where messages are checke for
relevancy before being sent to all subscribers in order to keep message volume
at a reasonable level. To subscribe to information about the struggle to
defend affirmative action, send a message to: listserv@cmsa.berkeley.edu

In the body of the message, type:
sub affam-l YourFirstName YourLastName
i.e. sub affam-l Jane Smith
You will be added to the mailing list.

Since the attacks on affirmative action are tied to the rising racism embodied
in immigrant-bashing like Prop 187 and the criminalization of our communities
through measures like Three Strikes, you may also want to join these other
on-line resources.

187pol-l
187pol-l is a discussion list to tie together the strategic issues around a
broad-based struggle for racial and economic justice--how to bring the fight
for immigrant rights together with the fight for affirmative action,
alternatives to 3 strikes, and tying these issues into economic and political
struggles like NAFTA and Chiapas.
To Subcribe, send a message to: listserv@cmsa.berkeley.edu

In the body of the message, type:
sub 187pol-L YourFirstName YourLastName
i.e. sub 187pol-L Jane Smith
You will be added to the mailing list.


187-L
To subscribe to 187-l, the main information list around Prop 187 (a companion
list to affam-l), do the following:

In the body of the message, type:

affam-l), do the following:

These lists are sponsored as a public service to promote education around
these issues by UC-Berkeley's Center for Community Economic Research. You can
find other information of interest to the community at the Center's EDIN web

In addition, the removal of Affirmative Action in California has already
backfired. Bacchi, a white man who complained about not getting a job in
education because a lesser qualified black man was asked of his opinion about
the college having an all white staff. The thing is, the most qualified people
for these positions are Asian Americans, who will, in turn, get the jobs. Heh.

PROBLEM 7777777 of 11111111
I'm sick of people being so old fashioned in this society, in that women are
expected to wait for the man to come to them. If a girl sees a guy why can't
she say, "hey what's up?" Why is that looked upon as a slutty or whorish thing
to do? I enjoy the fact that a girl come to me. It let's me know that I am a
"somebody." I like aggressive women who have the ability to come forth and
say "hey, I like that guy." What's so wrong with that? Maybe women and men
are both too nervous or intimidated to come forth so because of the way things
have always been, women expect to wait for the men who are always the "cocky"
type who are full of themselves and know they've got what women want.

SOLUTION 7777777 of 11111111
I think that people need to start to become more open and take more chances.
That small amount of time, whether you are rejected or not is not going to
affect the rest of your life. These foolish mind games and playing "hard to
get" need to stop. If you like someone that much, why wouldn't you want to
talk to them, what could stop you?

The Problem With Capitalism:

It's a good economic system, but as a way of life:  it sucks.
It's a good economic system, but as a value system:  it sucks.
It's a good economic system, but as a substitute for democracy: it sucks.
It's a good economic system, but it overtook the culture and it is killing
the culture, and we all feel it happening, and we don't know who or what
to blame.
It's a good economic system, but if you dare to monitor it, regulate it,
or even defend yourself against it, you are labeled a Communist and
therefore, an enemy. It's a good economic system, but for too many,
it has become a religion.

TO CLOSE:
With all these things that are wrong, one just begs the question, "so what
isn't wrong?" Well, that's a good one. And I'm not saying you shouldn't have
fun, but if you try to avoid these problems you are as good as dead.
Kill Yourself!
