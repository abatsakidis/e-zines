--=>HEY MAN, WHY DO YOU CALL IT "KILL YOURSELF?" THAT'S OFFENSIVE!
    People suck, plain and simple. I hear it everyday, "oh my god, i have 
    split ends," or "i broke a nail," or "my teacher is giving me a B, what
    will I ever do?," or "he was making fun of me." Sure everyone has feel-
    ings and express them in a different way, but I don't wanna hear your
    bitching and complaining because I don't care. In addition, "why isn't 
    pot legal? that's so dumb," or "jesus, they should get rid of that law." 
    If you want that law to go away, peel your dingleberry ass off the love 
    seat and organize people, do something, anything. If you are that 
    concerned with losing fifty cents KILL YOURSELF!

÷ There are alot of problems within this country, hell this planet. Everyone÷

PROBLEM 378047320749078904372980 of 1
I'm assuming that if you did get this zine off the net you probably live by or
on a college campus as I do. And what comes along with a college campus aside
from bullshit classes, bullshit scheduling and shitty food? How about bible
pushers from every "grassy null" to every students' favorite hang out spot. 
What's the problem with this? Well, they have the right to be there as I have
the right to publish this zine on the net. So at the same time, you have the
choice to download or not to download this zine as you do the fliers, pamph-
lets or "chop-chops" as some call them. But I don't push the zine on anyone
as they so intrudingly do. I can't walk down a sidewalk without getting stop=
ped or getting a pamphlet, or waste of paper in some people's opinion, shoved
in my face.

SOLUTION 378047320749078904372980 of 1
Not everyone is annoyed by this, but those who are are truly annoyed. I know
I am. What I like to do is ask them to explain everything on the pamphlet and
the great thing is that you can shut down everthing they say if you know
enough about the existing contradictions in the bible. This still doesn't 
work, though because the next day guess what gets shoved in your face? What I
suggest is writing a letter to MagiKal Childe Publishing at 35 West 19th 
street, New York, NY 10011 and ask for some satanic propaganda, not that I 
necessarily agree with satanism, or any organized religion for that manner. 
But perhaps if they are givin their own medicine, they'll learn that they are 
an annoyance and must be stopped. And if this still doesn't work ... you know
what to do. And if you still don't, think to yourself the title of this zine.

PROBLEM 67 of 677777777
This society seems to have a problem with any act that is not among christian
thought. If you do something, and these days it could even being something as 
lame as not flushing your toilet, that's just not right you get shunned, al-
most like the whole McCarthy-Nixon red-baiting bulllshit. It seems like you
can't do something you really want to do without having to deal with someone 
who thinks you're the anti-christ.

SOLUTION 67 of 677777777
If someone you know seems to have this type of opinion of you, fuck 'em. You
don't need them anyway. Anyone that narrow-minded is not worth your time 
unless you'd like to make an attempt to try and help them, an act I'm not
exactly sure about going about. Anyone? I say there is someone somewhere who
will appreciate you're "god-hating" act. And that is the kind of person you
want to stick with because they can appreciate you for the fact that what you 
do is what you want and believe as normal behavior.

PROBLEM 21 of -4
I like shock value. I like wearing metal and studs and leather and spikes and
all that crazy shit. I'm a satanist they seem to think. All those chains hang-
ing from my belt and wallet are a sign of satan worship and animal sacrifice 
they say. My combat boots are a sign of my schizophrenic unfaithful dis-
position. Heh.

SOLUTION 21 of -4
Hey, you like it right? You know what you believe, you know better than blind
faith, you don't need to be saved. Fuck 'em.

PROBLEM 75 of 75
"You're going to church, son." And you go. Why? You know you don't like it.
You know nothing they say agrees with you. You know that your weak stomach
can't handle their bullshit. 

PROBLEM 75 of 75
"Mom and Dad, i love you. I respect you but I was never given a choice of 
what to believe. I want that choice. I want the right to tell you that my 
opinions don't agree with yours. I have alternative ways of dealing with 
problems. I have my friends and you, as parents not as god-fearers. I have 
books to read, knowledge to gain. I don't want to spend all sunday morning 
counting contradictions like sheep jumping over a fence when I'm trying to 
sleep at night. I realize that you need something to hold on to because death
is so fightening. I'm frightened by it too, but believeing that there is a 
higher plane that hasn't been proved to exist is too much for me. I have
enough trouble deciding if aliens truly exist. I'm sorry, but my prescence 
at church would only interfere with the things that I truly hold dear in this
life."

TO CLOSE: 
Some say that there's no crime in blind faith if it gets the job done. But
this is the biggest display of naivety I've ever come in contact with. If
you've been raped is it okay because it was gOD's decision? I hope not. 
There is an on-going problem here. That rape occured because some horny 
asshole's daughter's asshole was too tight. If you can't deal with one night
without getting off, if you can't deal with the fact that gOD really doesn't
exist ... KILL YOURSELF!
