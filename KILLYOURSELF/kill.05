CLINTON BOWS TO RELIGIOUS RIGHT

By Shelley Ettinger

In a July 12 speech President Bill Clinton positioned himself to
the right of even his predecessors Ronald Reagan and George Bush
on the issue of religion in the public schools.

The president posed as a defender of a basic civil liberty--the
right to private expression of religious beliefs. But he actually
went much further than that, especially in terms of the broader
message he conveyed.

The president announced that he had instructed the Education
Department to distribute new "guidelines" on religion to the
nation's 15,000 school districts. The guidelines would allow
prayer in schools--just not in class or led by school officials.

The guidelines are yet another capitulation to political
reaction. The implications are disturbing--especially in light of
how right-wing religious groups have used the issue of school
prayer to promote racism and anti-Semitism.

DISCRIMINATION IN EVERY WAY

Because it inevitably stigmatizes, isolates and represses those
in the minority, school prayer has historically been considered
out of place in a democracy, even under capitalism.

No matter its form, any move to encourage religious expression in
the public schools is discriminatory in essence. Even if it is
supposedly designed not to, any such move inherently promotes the
majority religion, which in this country is Christianity, and
suppresses minority expression.

The struggle against school prayer and every court decision
banning it has been based on bourgeois democratic law rejecting
the establishment of religion as discriminatory.

Still, in many public schools around the country, Christian
prayers, songs, symbols and other expressions of the majority
religion are imposed on schoolchildren. Authority figures like
teachers, administrators or athletes generally lead the prayers,
songs, etc.--in classrooms, at school assemblies and graduation
ceremonies, before athletic events, in the cafeteria, and so on.

For those who don't subscribe to these beliefs, this is a
humiliating, intimidating experience.

For Jewish and Muslim children, in particular, it can be even
worse. The weight of religious bigotry can easily be set loose in
the school setting--with anti-Semitic and racist violence the
ultimate result.

Despite the reality, the right wing promotes a strange lie that
Clinton has now embraced: that private, individual expression of
the majority religion is repressed or in peril in the public
schools.

But has there been a single reported case of a teacher
reprimanding a child for silently praying before eating lunch?
Have students been forbidden to wear crucifixes around their
necks?

Of course not. Clinton couldn't even cite any such specific
problem in his speech.

There is no need to protect the right to private religious
expression in the schools.

On the contrary, it's the right to freedom from official or
quasi-official group expression of these beliefs that needs
protecting. Such expression imperils and discriminates against
those who don't subscribe to the beliefs being expressed.

And such expression is precisely what Clinton is promoting, even
if he doesn't admit it. Imagine this scenario, for example:
It's lunchtime in the high school cafeteria. As scores of
students sit down to eat, 40 football players in letter jackets
stand up around a table in the center of the room. A hush falls
over the room as the captain of the football team intones a
solemn prayer to Jesus.

Is this private expression? According to Clinton's guidelines, it
is specifically allowed. It might even strike many as
heart-warming.But this isn't a church. It's a public school. And
to the lone Jew in the room, or the Muslim, or the budding
atheist, it's a scary moment.

New York schoolteacher Sherry Finkelman talked to Workers World
about Clinton's move to impose religion in the schools. "There's
another potentially dangerous aspect," she pointed out. "Last
month the Supreme Court upheld the Ku Klux Klan's right to mount
a cross in a Cincinnati public square, defining the Klanners'
cross as a religious symbol.

"Under Clinton's guidelines, are the activities of a KKK youth
group considered a form of religious expression?" Finkelman
asked.

A NOD TO ANTI-SEMITIC RIGHT

The president's July 12 speech was widely understood as a bow to
the right wing. Every major news report commented that he's
trying to "outflank" the Republicans on the school prayer issue.

Out-demagogue is another way of putting it. Clinton can't go all
the way and endorse the Republicans' constitutional amendment
establishing school prayer as the law of the land--but he can
make it clear that that's where his heart is.

This is particularly shocking since the issue of school prayer
has historically been used in an explicitly anti-Semitic way. By
siding with these forces, Clinton is winking at anti-Semitism.

Yet if he sought to win over the ultra-right and religious
fundamentalist groups, he may be disappointed. His speech seemed
to embolden their leaders, who quickly demanded that he go
further and endorse the constitutional amendment.

At the same time, moderate religious groups and some civil
libertarians, bending under the pressure to discard or distort
the First Amendment ban on establishment of religion, said they
could live with the president's approach.

But it's the young people of the country who will have to live
with it, unless the struggle to keep religion and the state
separate is revived and strengthened now that it's under attack
from the White House.

SOLUTION 5 of 1000
I feel that prayer in school that's private is fine. And the article just 
begged the question, "how private?" Private should be so that the words or
prayers being said must not be heard by others nearby so as not to violate
or discomfort them in any way. Privacy should be seclusion. A school is 
provided to educate. One may argue, "well learning about christian--" 
Now wait a minute. Fine. If you wanna learn about christianity in school, 
then the school should also have to teach the students judaism, muslim, 
satanism, atheism, and every other type of organized religion. Focusing on
the religion that is most popular will discourage those outside the populous.
If the mix of church and state does occur, this is the only solution I see.
ğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğ 
PROBLEM [a google plex] of [infinity]
        Public school and private school are both very different even though 
their overall goals are similar. Public schools tend to center on the 
"name-brand" kids. 
        Micheal Deveraux III walks down the hall on the second to last day of
school drunk off his ass. The teachers pass it off like nothing and casually
slap an "A" with red ink on their paper. Did the teacher even read it? John A.
Student gets in an arguemnet with Micheal and gets to sit in the in-school
suspension room for the rest of the day. Public schools lack the tolerance
Private schools have. The teachers in public schools seem to have much less
care for their students. Whether their student passes or not is irrelevant.
        Private Schools mostly consist of the "name-brand" kids so favortism 
is scarce unlike public school. The teachers will spend much more time with
their students and insure that they pass or at very least understand the 
lesson to the best of their ability. Well this sounds great, right? So what's
the problem? Hmm, most private schools are co-ed, they are often far from 
home, causing home sick, they assume you are much more of an adult then you 
are ready to be, and they are expensive as shit.
The question here is education. Which is better. Which gets the job done more 
adequately and should we have to pay for private education whether our kids 
are present there or not? 

SOLUTION [a google plex] of [infinity]
Public schools, without a doubt, must work on weeding out the favortism and
discrimination. The teachers must give each student a fair opportunity. If
this would happen, we wouldn't need the private schools to do it for us. But 
then again, many people think private schools will trigger a strong 
maturation process. If this is so, why am I more fucked up than I was before
I went? At any rate, private schools must get their own money from alumni 
because the government does not fund them and neither should we, whether we
attend or not. Our tax dollars need to be invested in to public education 
because there is a lack of modern technology in the system. Private schools
have already got that covered. You bitch about giving the public education 
system money, well that's exactly what it needs right now. In addition, 
I noticed one reason teachers at private schools were better was because they
are younger. I'm not saying fire all the old public school teachers, but they
need to attend more work shops and use contemporary teaching methods. Kids 
are getting lazier and lazier and need more fun things to do, while teachers
continue to get more serious. Each side needs to come toward the middle a 
little bit.

PROBLEM 441134 of 552245
"College life blows, man. Only good thing is beer. Everything they tell me
is easier useless or too comlicated. I hate this shit, I try to argue with
my profs cuz I know I'm right and they try to pull this, who's the professor
bullshit with me."

SOLUTION 441134 of 552245
I don't know a soul in the world who hasn't felt like this at one time or
another. But hell, if you made it through high school, which is absolute 
horror, what makes this worse? Sure, you're gonna fuck up alot of times and
have to take a break. But don't take a permanent one. I've had alot of 
friends do that. They decide they want to be "free-spirits" and roam the 
world with an empty wallet and a packed bowl. Sure take a trip, but if you 
don't come back, you're a waste of talent. Don't fall into the crowd, take
whtever you can out of school, because the way things are now, you're truly
helpless without it.
ğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğ
TO CLOSE:
Education would be so much easier if anyone still had motivation left in them.
It's a shame that it comes down to learning things you don't care about and
watching the clock all hour thinking about all the beer you are gonna drink
tonight. We are the future decision makers and I certainly don't want to 
make the wrong decisons. If this doesn't sink in, if you're too good for 
school... KILL YOURSELF!
