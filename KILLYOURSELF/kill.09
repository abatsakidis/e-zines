A woman was near death from a rare form of cancer.  There was one drug
that the doctors thought might save her, a form of radium that a druggist in
the same town had recently discovered.  The druggist was charging $2000--ten
times what it cost to make.  The sick woman's husband went to everyone he knew
to borrow the money, but he could only get about half of what the drug cost.
He told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell the drug
cheaper or to let him pay later.  But the druggist said, "no."  The husband
became desperate and broke into the druggist's store to steal the drug for his
wife.

Right, I haven't got a drop of native american blood in me, apparently I'm
english-french to new-zealander white. So I'm unable to comment on this,
being blinded my my own genes--- oh woe!

But I will blunder on anyway, missing out on all the subtle nuances, that not
being *born* to a race/culture I can never, ever hope to have.

Uh-huh. Ask someone to explain how To Kill a Mockingbird and Huckleberry Finn
are evil, racist books because they use crude, offensive words like 'kike'.
Context makes the meaning.

It's kinda hard to convey to the reader the evilness of a character if
they're only allowed to use p.c. words. What should the bad guys say.
"You intellectualy-challanged dark-pigmented indigenous of Africa
masculine-genderized perchild!" doesn't have the same ring as "you stupid
nigger".

Nor does it tell the reader that the character regards those people
in that negative demeaning way. Bad people use bad words and any
depiction of humanity (I hesitate to call Pocahontas a work of art,
but it deserves the same protection as any expression) has to show
what people actually say and actually think.

The following entry brought to you by Dave (IAMHOLTZ@oak.grove.iup.edu)

Dear D. Edmonds, your first mistake was identifying your inability to comment,
yet decide to respond anyway. Your second was to compare Pocahontas to such
works of fiction such as Huckleberry Finn and To Kill A Mockingbird
to a historical fiction animated movie. Pocahontas, originally based on a true
story, was exploited when Disney got a hold of it. Disney portrays the characters
as much younger and the racism was not nearly as strong as Disney made it out
to be if any existed at all when the story occurred. In addition, the movie,
without a doubt is meant for and focused on children, whereas the books you
mentioned are not. I don't think these are the type of messages a young and
influential child needs, especially when most of it is so very farfetched.

Burma is ruled by the State Law & Order Restoration (SLORC), a
brutal regime that regulates all investment.

PepsiCo is the only major fast food firm in Burma:

* PepsiCo recently sponsored a SLORC trade show;
* Its "private" business Burmese partner is closely tied to SL-ORC.(1)
* It has bottled Pepsi and 7up there since 1991 and now plans Pizza Hut and
  KFC restaurants. SLORC boasts about PepsiCo's highly-visible presence.

Its trade gives money and legitimacy to SLROC's regim of terror: (2)

* imprisoning Nobel Peace Laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, torturing her supporters,
    crushing her party after its landslide election victory in 1990.(3)
* spreading "explosive growth" of AIDS in Asia by luring Burmese women into
  sex slavery in Thailand, (4) exporting 60% of the world's heroin, and
  promoting drug injection.(2)
* enslaving civilians as army porters and mine sweepers. SLORC defends
    "voluntary" labor as a noble act of charity.(5)
* diverting all of its foreign exchange earnings into the military.

BOYCOTT PEPSICO!
Other companies have pulled out of Burma, including Levi Strauss and Co.
which stated in 1992:

"It is not possible to do business in Burma without directly supporting the
military government and its pervasive violations of human rights."

If you think good business needs democracy...

* call 1 - 800 - 433-2652 (COLA) & ask why PepsiCo has stopped taking
  toll-free calls on Burma; request PepsiCo public letter defending its
   presence in Burma. Then, you be the jdge!
* Learn the reasons for the global boycott, aimed at pressuring PepsiCo to
    withdraw from Burma until the democracy is restored.

               The University of New Mexico and PEPSI

        Last year PepsiCo was awarded an exclusive contract which gives it a
monopoly near campus. If UNM corporation students, faculty and staff refuse
to purchase PEPSI, the corporation stands to lose a large investment. The UNM
administration has responded to inquiries concerning the Pepsi and SLORC
connection with typically flippant remarks. President Peck's attitude was
essentially, "Pepsi isn't doing something wrong.. they are just conducting
business like Wringley's or Ford."

              WHAT CAN I DO TO SUPPORT THE PEPSI BOYCOTT?

DON'T BUY PEPSICO PRODUCTS! Pepsi products include: Pepsi Cola, Mountain Dew,
Slice, Lipton Ice Tea, Ocean Spray, Frito-Lay, Ruffles, Doritos, SunChips,
Cheetos, Tositos, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken.

MORE ABOUT BURMA:

The people of Burma have been under the totalitarian rule of a military junta
since 1962. In 1988, millions of people took to the streets to demand
democracy. In response, the military slaughtered over 2,000 Burmese
pro-democracy demonstrators, including school children, Buddhist monks and
students. Due to pressure from the international community, the military
government was forced to hold multi-party legislative elections in May, 1990.

Daw Aung Suu Kyi, one of the prodemocracy movement, formed the National League
for Democracy (NLD). Even though she had been under arrest since 1989 the NLD
won the 1990 elections in a landslide. The NLD won 82% of the seats in the
National Assembly but the military government refused to relinquish power.
Immediate following the elections, SLORC cracked down by arresting elected
NLD officials and building militarybases in every municipality - effectively
turning Burna into a police state; today, there are over 30,000 political
prisoners in Burma.

SLORC will remain vulnerable to foreign divestment. Its brutal and illegal
rule depends on foreign investors for cash, technical aid and the pretense of
"political neutrality"  - without the crutch of foreign assistance, SLORC is
likely to collapse, as did the apartheid regime in South Africa.

"Revenge"
The following entry brought to you by Dave (IAMHOLTZ@oak.grove.iup.edu)
The first thing I wanted to do was put huge gashes in his arms and toss him in
to a pool of lemon juice. But I didn't know where I'd find all that lemon juice.
So then I thought it might be an interesting way of getting revenge if I cut
open his back, tie a bungy cord around his spine, toss him off a cliff, holding
the bungy cord, hoping that when the cord came back up all there would be was
bones. But that would probably get me sick and make me fall off the cliff. So
my last resort was ... well let me tell you what he did to me first...
I thought it would be neat to yell across the classroom how much of a snob he
was, and he really was, is. He wasn't pleased. After class, he got in my face,
like right in my face, practically trying to get a piece. I had notions about
him at this point. he wanted to get his two cents in. He said I wouldn't
amount to anything. Called him a homosexual that day, not that there's
anything wrong with that, not at all. But well, it seemed right. And I know
right from wrong, after all I'm amoral. I like eating dead cow too, but that
doesn't piss me off like he does. So he was all mad, and then he striked me
about the face with the back of his hand. I think they call that a back hand.
Makes sense, it's accurate, precise and all that. I was sucking on a  breath
mint hardcore. He striked me he did. And the mint like flew outta my mouth.
That mint was given to me by this philosopher guy so it had sentimental
value. So then he called me a Jewish, nigger loving, white trash faggot but
that's not what pissed me off. It was the breath mint. I love breath mints,
not that there's anything wrong with that. And I like dead cows so i think
I'll just write big "X's" on my hands.  So what did I finally decide to do to
him? What evil maniacal thing could I possibly think of? What would get him
right where it counts? What absolutely impulsive diabolical act of revenge
could I present him with? Well I'll tell you. You wanna know what I said?
What great thing did I do to get back at his utterly violent action towards me?
Heh. I said, " you know what pal? You rock!"

"Toys And Violence"
The following entry brought to you by Dave (IAMHOLTZ@oak.grove.iup.edu)

Subterranean wombat exterminators from Mars
Whatever happened to simple matchbox cars
Children these days need violence in their lives
Children these days need action figures with knives

You can try if you want to give them Lincoln Logs
But they'll say, "how boring," I'd rather play with dead frogs

Mutant pterodactyls not plastic cubes that rattle
Fire-breathing dragons not prescholastic red wagons
G.I. Joe gun powder action figures not plush toy Tiggers
Radioactive superhumans not weaponless khaki crewmen

Talking dolls that crawl won't suit them at all
They want something with a fearsome arsenal three feet tall

Pretty soon they'll toys with a detachable nuclear device
What ever happened to simply flying a kite?


In Closing:
It's hard to keep up with who is supporting who and who you support. Even if you are, for example,
against killing animals, does this mean you can't support a cooperation that does? Well, this all depends 
on how true you are to your beliefs. If you buy products from a cooperation that kills animals you can't be against it. You can only disagree with it. If you are going to be anti- something or against something you
must be willing to make sacrifices. Don't lie to make yourself seem open minded or accepted. Stand by what
ever you feel is right, but in a way that will hurt no one else. If your opinions jeopardize other people's lives you're the one who should KILL YOURSELF!<P>
