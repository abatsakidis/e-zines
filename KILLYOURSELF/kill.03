(Casey Casem calls 'zines the "alternative newspaper." If you have the same
 opinion, you need desparately to read this. In a way he does have a point,
 but most "hip" people see that as an insult, I know I do. We are for every-
 one, we don't focus on one clique or any clique. Everyone needs to be 
 involved. We are not "Rock the Vote," but we are making an attempt to unite
 the future decision makers of the world.)

--=>HEY MAN, WHY DO YOU CALL IT "KILL YOURSELF?" THAT'S OFFENSIVE!
    People suck, plain and simple. I hear it everyday, "oh my god, i have 
    split ends," or "i broke a nail," or "my teacher is giving me a B, what
    will I ever do?," or "he was making fun of me." Sure everyone has feel-
    ings and express them in a different way, but I don't wanna hear your
    bitching and complaining because I don't care. In addition, "why isn't 
    pot legal? that's so dumb," or "jesus, they should get rid of that law." 
    If you want that law to go away, peel your dingleberry ass off the love 
    seat and organize people, do something, anything. If you are that 
    concerned with losing fifty cents KILL YOURSELF!

PROBLEM 0 of 9
Ever go to your friends house because you'd promise to pick them up by car
and you have to wait in your car for three hours? Sure. And what's their
excuse? "Oh, sorry, I had to brush my hair," or "I had to put concealer on
to hide my one zit" while you sit there with uncombed hair and a pizza face.

SOLUTION 0 of 9
Fuck 'em all. If the person you're trying to impress can't except you for who 
you are rather than how messy you look they can't be all that great to have
around. If you have to change your  appearance for someone you think you like
you're thinking on the wrong side of your brain. Don't do what's expected
or accepted. Look how you want, it's what you say that impresses people. And
if they're not impressed you know what to do.

PROBLEM 12345 of 54321
Hey you sport guy, "jock" as some call you but will not acknowledge that label
but then again what are labels anyway? You see that kid who decided to wear a
dress to school or that girl who wears combat boots and all black and you say
"what a faggot I ought to kick his ass," or "that fucking lesbian weirdo 
bitch." Well that's cool, but how do you think they feel? And do you really 
know them?

SOLUTION 12345 of 54321
See here, you like beer, you like to drink, maybe they do to. I'd like to see
each kind of person, the "fairy" and the "jock" drink together. Under those
intoxicating conditions you just wait and see how well you guys can get along.
Try it some time and end the prejudgemental comments

PROBLEM 23 of 127738342
You're hanging out with your "cool" friends who really know you. So you go to
a public place and you are all hanging out. When all of the sudden you turn 
your head and see alterna-teen looking girl who you actually get along with 
really well, but the older, cooler friends know her too. They say she is dumb
and there is no sense in talking to her because she has nothing to offer in a
friendship. Well how do they know? They don't have the same relationship with
alterna-teen looking girl that you do. Maybe you get along with her just as
well as you get along with them. What to do? Act cool around your older 
friends? That would make you look like what they think of her. No.

SOLUTION 23 of 127738342
C'mon, tell 'em like it is. Tell 'em that she's cooler than they think. They 
have no right to dictate who you hang out with. They talk so much about unity.
Maybe she's not as "hip" as you gusy are but maybe she has the potential. Give
her a chance, include her, give her a place. She may become a very loyal part
of our circle of friends. Don't prejudge. I do it and it's wrong. Appearance
isn't everything. So she does her hair up for fifty minutes. Does that mean
she's "uncool?" Don't judge a book by it's cover because it could mean 
destroying a beautiful friendship that never was.

TO CLOSE:
Sure appearance isn't everything and it doesn't have to be. That's just the 
the only way some people know. Give 'em a try, if it doesn't work at least 
you'll know for sure. Be a pal, someone may need it. And if you think you're
above someone and you justify that by saying "I don't wear Benneton," you've
got a problem. In fact, there's maybe only one solution...KILL YOURSELF!
