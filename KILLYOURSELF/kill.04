 opinion, you need desparately to read this. In a way he does have a point,
 but most "hip" people see that as an insult, I know I do. We are for every-

--=>HEY MAN, WHY DO YOU CALL IT "KILL YOURSELF?" THAT'S OFFENSIVE!
    People suck, plain and simple. I hear it everyday, "oh my god, i have 
    split ends," or "i broke a nail," or "my teacher is giving me a B, what
    will I ever do?," or "he was making fun of me." Sure everyone has feel-
    ings and express them in a different way, but I don't wanna hear your
    bitching and complaining because I don't care. In addition, "why isn't 
    pot legal? that's so dumb," or "jesus, they should get rid of that law." 
    If you want that law to go away, peel your dingleberry ass off the love 
    seat and organize people, do something, anything. If you are that 
    concerned with losing fifty cents KILL YOURSELF!

PROBLEM -1 of -90,000
I don't even think I have to say this but I will because obviously this 
problem has not been solved. Homosexuality. Just like there are blacks, 
hispanics, asians, chinese, japanese, indians, and white people, there are 
gay people. No homosexuality is not a race, but it's an alternative life-
style. One that also is as commom as heterosexuality. Men and men and women
and women and men and women and women and men. Big fucking deal. And when did
God specifically say to you that he "hates fags?" Never because God's dead 
and if you heard him say that you're next. A person isn't gay if they tight
roll their pants. A person is gay if they prefer their own sex over the other.
It's genetics not something just to bother the ignorant populous. 

SOLUTION -1 of -90,000
Stop. Just stop. People are people. How many homosexuals sexually abuse 
anyone? Do you think their existence is a threat to your well being? Well,
I've got news for you. You won't get attacked which means there is no reason
for you to attac them. Think a little. If you don't agree, write me and tell 
me why. I won't shun you, I'll help you see my side. Compromise if need be. 
Wake up. I'm so sick of this subject. Live your own life or end this hell and 
KILL YOURSELF!

PROBLEM 600 of 6000
"You murderer. It's a child not a choice. Think about all the guilt you'll 
have to live with." So you got raped and you got "knocked up" and you got 
pregnant. This happens all too often. How can you live with it how can you 
live without it? You have your right-wing parents to face who will make you 
keep it because if you don't you're killing a fetus! GOD FORBID! So it comes 
down to this. It becomes your fault that you got raped and the father of your 
unborn child is a horny bastard who can't keep it in his pants. His perversion 
is now a problem dropped in your hands. Who the hell van make that sort of 
decision for you? How will you afford the child anyways, a child who has the 
genes of a sick man? By all means, abort. It's your call and it should be. 
But what do you say to mom? How's this?

SOLUTION 600 of 6000
"Mother, you don't realize how much harder it is nowadays. Things were easier
in your time and you didn't even have to consider this type of situation. I'm
sorry things are so hard but it's a man's world and I refuse to let it be 
which is more than I can say for you. I want the choice, as a women, as a 
human being. Who's to say you can afford this child? You can barely afford
all my materialistic needs. I'm not necessarily begging here. I'm telling you
what needs to be done. This is the only way I can live with myself. I'm young,
it's not my time to become a full-fledged adult and I refuse to let it be. 
Please grant me this. You aren't the one living with someone inside you."
To reinforce the issue consider this lyrics by NAKED AGGRESSION:

KILLING FLOOR
There's this group around that calls themselves prolife Well, instead they 
should call themselves pro-death Because by taking away our freedom of choice
They're are going to force many women who don't want to bear children, to the 
back alleyAnd many women are going to die from these back alley abortions! 
But these people don't seem to care Operation rescue, what do you want me to 
do? SHOVE A COAT HANGAR UP MY CUNT? I had an abortion is a back alley I had 
an abortion in a back alley I had an abortion in a back alley I had an 
abortion in a back alley And now I'm bleeding to death on the killing floor

PROBLEM 0 of 0
"Aww, hey man. You're a virgin? What are you a fag? You probably beat off 
alot, don't you?" You're a virgin and you can't bear telling your friends
know. How would they feel. You aren't even an adult yet like them. You can't
live with yourself. It's terrible, you just want to find a man and grab him,
because we all know men will never turn down a chance to get off. Or if you're
a guy you just think of girls 24/7/52/365. So what do you do?

SOLUTION 0 of 0
C'mon, you haven't found the right mate yet. Big fuckin' deal. You're scared,
you don't want to just find a whore you want a real relationship. You want
the first time to mean something. And so it should. Keep your diplomatic
immunity. Be a virgin, or don't. But it doesn't matter either way. You can 
still think for yourself and make your own compitant decisions. Don't lose
that trait, ever.

PROBLEM .349999 of 1.0
Rape. When you hear the word you shudder. and if you don't you're a sadist. 
Why does this word exist? Probably for the same reason men exist. A large
part of man's existence has to do with his thought-to-be uncontrollable sex
drive. Most men see a girl and say, "man I want to fuck that piece of meat" 
and feel that they are then justified to do it because women are just sex 
objects, right? I don't think so. 

SOLUTION .349999 of 1.0
If you want to "fuck that piece of meat," you don't deserve to fuck anything 
but the hole that's been eaten away by your slobbering dog over the years. 
That's all. It's impossible to argue to men, "well how would you feel if
you got raped," because most men would never turn down a chance to get turned 
on. But how about this, what makes men so god damn special. What goves them 
the right to fuck anything they want? Most of it comes from traditional values
and the fact that man has always been the powerful one who takes care of
things. This now becomes the battle of the sexes. It's a toughy. It's also 
not that hard to meet a girl. There are other ways of getting in to bed if
that's your ultimate goal, but at the same time, this isn't a very civilized
or outstanding goal. Security is nice to have, someone to spend time with,
but this doesn't mean you reserve the right to force security or friendship.
Consider the lyrics to this song. They are pretty straight-forward. If
you still don't get the point, go back to preschool:

LEAVE ME ALONE by NAKED AGGRESSION (reprinted without permission)
No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No! I listen to you pateiently as shit flows from
your mouth This feeling grows inside, I want to shut you up I've heard it all
before, don't want to hear it anymore I don't know what I'm going to do, I 
need to get awya from you right now, FUCKING JERK! LEAVE ME ALONE! Poeple try
to fuck with my head every single day So many sexist pigs who should be locked
away I'm not a piece of meat put on this earth so you can fuck me I'm a human
being and I refuse to tolerate your disrespect FUCKING JERK! LEAVE ME ALONE! 
I'm not your goddamn baby I'm not your fucking whore If you don't understand
that Then talking won't work anymore I'm going to get a gun and kill everyone
I demand respect, I won't stand for less And if you don't understand I'll blow 
you away If you won't comprehend, I'll blow you away If you don't respect me, 
I'll blow you away I'm gonna buy a gun and I'll blow you away! No, No, No, No, 
No, No, No, No! I listen to you pateiently as shit flows from your mouth This 
feeling grows inside, I want to shut you up I've heard it all before, don't 
want to hear it anymore I don't know what I'm going to do, I need to get away 
from you right now, FUCKING JERK! LEAVE ME ALONE!

PROBLEM .0000000001 of -3.1
Love is a complicated one. If love existed would there be divorce? 

SOLUTION .0000000001 of -3.1
Some say there is no love, just the absence of hate. What do you think cuz 
I can't get this one.
ğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğğ
TO CLOSE:
So there are a lot of problems with sex alone and most of it is a difference
of opinion and any compromise seems impossible. I'd like to say my opinions
are right, but who's to say? It's just how I was brought up. But a compromise
needs to be made. Everyone thinks they are right. Sometimes Segregation 
doesn't seem so bad, but at the same time, shouldn't we all be working 
together? I simply think the freedom of choice is an important trait that we
are all forgetting about. It needs to make a comeback. Think about Naked 
Aggression's lyrics. Things don't need to be harsh, but because of horny men
and right-wing fundamentalists, those who still believe in freedom of choice 
have been pushed to an aggressive, hostile stance. Learn to accpet choices 
and learn that no one is "just a piece of meat." No one is above anyone. 
This must be understood. If not we might as well ALL KILL OURSELVES!
