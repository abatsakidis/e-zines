PROBLEM 82 of 100
Misconceptions. You see an intimidating young person walking or sitting near
you. On his shoulder or boot is a swastika, crossed out. Most people only see
the swastika on this person and their immediate reaction is to either fear
this person or uncontrollably explode on them. All people see is an offensive
insgnia symbolizing hate, racism and ignorance.
SOLUTION 82 of 100
First of all, the swastika is crossed out. Look for that. That is a strong
message. It means anti-nazi, anti-racism, anti-hate, anti-ignorance. When
you see this your immediate reaction should be "right on." Read on, look into
to things. If you aren't sure. Don't be afraid to ask. Even nazis are willing
to give you their input. If you don't agree with their answer, then you can
explode on them. Then you can educate them. Then you can tell them that they
need help.

PROBLEM 11711 of 77177
The following is taken from the AFA Journal in February, 1995:

"If you are doing business with AT&T, you are helping to promote homosexuality.
It's true. The nation's largest telecommunications company is committed to
using their resources to convice America that homosexuality is a normal
alternative lifestyle. AT&T has a history of promoting homosexuality.
Consider a few examples:

        * AT&T was one of the main financial sponsors of the Gay Games IV and
          Cultural Festival in New York, part of a huge calendar of events in
          June specifically designed to reshape America's moral values.

        * AT&T is directly soliciting homosexual customers through a mail
          campaign which comes in a lavender envelope and a letter from AT&T's
          homosexual employee group.

        * AT&T doesn't seem to care about family values. Concerning a customer
          backlash because of their support for homosexuality, a company
          spokesman told an advertising trade publication, "Anyone with that
          kind of attitude [concern about the homosexual lifestyle] has to lose
          it."

        * AT&T has sponsored the homosexual musical Falsettos

        * AT&T indoctrinates their employees to accept homosexuality using the
          video "On Being Gay" by homosexual activist Brian McNaught.

        * At the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association in 1993, AT&T
          was among companies named as progressive because of support for
          homosexual causes.

The Good News - An Alternative

American Family Association is offering their supporters the opportunity to
quit doing business with AT&T and a switch to a long distance carrier with a
distinctively Christian difference - Lifeline.
With one toll-free phone call, not only have you taken business away from
AT&T, but you are making a stand for morality in America.
Lifeline is a major long distance carrier like AT&T, MCI, Sprint, etc.,
except, like you and me, Lifeline is committed to family values and decency."
The add also has a boycott box which explains why companies or chains which
offer pornographic or offensive materials of some media should be boycotted.

SOLUTION 11711 of 77177
I love this add because it's so easy to tear apart. Where can I possibly
begin? Let's start with the title: Is this a warning? Like homosexuality is
suddenly a threat. Boy oh boy, I don't know if I'll be able to sleep tonight
knowing that. The terminology is incredible. Consider the first paragraph:
"...convince America that homosexuality is a normal alternative lifestyle."
Has it ever been proven that it wasn't a "normal" alternative lifestyle. Why
is it all of the sudden a false prophecy? The first example: So what are
America's "moral values" anyways? The second example: It's uncanny, the
significance of the letter being lavender. The third example: When did our
phone companies suddenly have to maintain or follow "family values?" and why
should there be concern? That's because we've been brainwashed into thinking
gays caused AIDS. Wake up, people, it was the government. The fourth example:
Oh Jesus, not the Falsettos! The fifth example: As if this is a punishment.
This also sounds like a threat towards Brian. The sixth example: How could
Lifeline be progressive when they stick to the same damn morals and values?
In the next paragraph we see, once again, that the religion of our phone
company is somehow significant. In the next paragraph, changing phone
companies has become a moral progression. Following we see that anyone who
reads this add must be, or should be decent and support family values. This
is what they call family values? This is what I call pathetic. This is just
another example of why you should make a switch because of an insignificant
difference. Don't give in to more corporate bullshit. Well, here's the number.
It's a toll-free call. Take advantage of it...

PROBLEM 50 of 51
Many people, including some members of this electronic community, are deeply
offended by Disney's new movie, "Pocahontas".  Children who view this movie
may obtain a distorted image of a living people and their culture.  The
film contains historical inaccuracies and prejudicial lyrics.

The historical truth is that Pocahontas was no more than ten years old and
John Smith was at least 22 when they met.  (Some accounts state he was 42,
others that he was in his sixties.)  An entry in Smith's later memoirs
suggests he may have forced himself upon her.  If there was any "romance"
between John Smith and Pocahontas, he would be considered a child molester
today. Also, the movie doesn't mention the fact that Pocahontas was later
taken prisoner by the English and held for ransom.

The movie contains scenes and lyrics that promote racist and sexist
stereotypes.  The most disturbing of these are the following lyrics, from
the song, "Savages":


"What can you expect from filthy little heathens?
Their whole disgusting race is like a curse.
Their skin's a hellish red.
They're only good when they are dead!"

Regardless of the context of these lyrics, they are just as offensive to
members of this community as "nigger" is to African-Americans and Nazi
propaganda is to the Jewish community.  Worst of all, no child and few
adults
can easily "undo" a catchy, Disney song once it's in their head.

If your child was of Native descent, imagine how you would feel if your
son came home in tears to tell you that his schoolmates sang "Savages" to
him?  Or if your daughter told you she wanted to be like the Disney
Pocahontas, a non-Indian featured Barbie doll wearing barely any clothes,
instead of a member of the culture that you, your parents and
grandparents, worked so hard to preserve? Although some of us were excited
when we first heard that Disney was going to tell the story of Pocahontas,
we now feel betrayed.  Unfortunately, Disney has let us down in a cruel,
irresponsible manner.

Like the real Pocahontas, there have been many people in the past 100 years,
both white and Native, who have worked hard to form a bridge of
communication
and understanding between the cultures.  Please don't threaten their work
by supporting Disney's version of this story.  Please read the following
suggestions instead, choose an alternative and discuss with your child your
reasons for doing so.  (If your child has already viewed the film, please
take the time to discuss his/her reaction to it and consider these
alternatives as a followup activity.)

SOLUTION 50 of 51

WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP:

1. Do NOT purchase any Disney Pocahontas tickets or merchandise.
2. Voice your opinion to Disney at
   http://www.disney.com/BVPM/PressRoom/Pocahontas/Survey.html
3. Encourage your child to learn about other cultures, not as cartoon figures,
   but as real, living people.
4. Inform your child that more than half of Native Americans live off of
   reservations. There is a Native population in every state.
5. Encourage your child to recognize not all Native peoples are alike. Their
   cultures, languages and beliefs vary more than European countries.
6. Encourage your child's school to invite Native speakers from the local
   community.
7. Send copies of this letter to other parents that you know. Feel free to
   distribute it at your child's softball games, at church, at the beach club,
   playground, play groups, etc.
8. Consider donating to a non-profit organization that assists Native children.

An Introduction to Simon's Inevitability

My father conceived me in a blazing laserjetted glyph which is unreprintable
on more recent models.  My mother's vocal insistence that masculinist creation
theories were bad ontology represented the second half of my gene pool. I was
tarred and feathered for arguments made in defense of human free will on my
high school debate team and ever since I've been a loyal predestination
sympathizer. A brief excerpt from the transcript of my hearing before the
House Un-American Activities Committee:

        McCarthy:  The chorus to your heavy metal anthem "Fuck God" goes
"Economic Determinism, Yes/ Opium of the Masses, No!" does it not?
        Simon:  I have two responses to that charge:
                1) I actually got an aged prig of an appellate court judge to say for the
record that "Fuck God" had "redeeming social value."
                2) I've never written such a song, I've never heard such a
song, and I don't like music.

        After serving four life sentences at a minimum security college campus
for faulty methodologies with intent to maim, I was born in a proper sense of
the term.
        I'm convinced that the mere fact that I spent the first seven years of
my life wiane ethnic New York Jewish parents in the backwoods outside
Nashville, Tennessee has rendered me permanently self-contradictory.
My oxymoroneurosis was treated by my family's doctors with hormones up until I
started to experience side effects shortly after the onset of puberty.
Thereafter, a strict regimen of recreational self-medication has only
heightened the condition to the point that I'm now rather protective of it.
        Dad wrote me out the script to a home movie.  Mom tried to talk be out
of it but ended up filming it.  The script describes my character as "the
fragrant blend of several of my favorite Renaissance, Enlightenment, and
Romantic bards." With my knee ever damper in the scenic snowdrifts of the park
near my high school, I'm supposed to seduce the Wood Nymph and all that crap.
My text is no mere declaration of love, it's a thirty-page mathematical proof
that the universe consists of nothing more nor less than our love, my dear
Muse. I improperly cast the Wood Nymph as someone with some self-respect, and
the camera imploded.
        I try to account for the gives and the takes and the natures and the
nurtures that go into the decision to, say, buy a burrito as opposed to a
slice of pizza during a given lunch hour and all I end up with is a stir fry
of words that looks like an ulcer.  SimonStare is maddening to most people who
ask routine questions of me and get no answer except several tense minutes of
my fruitless mute agonizing about the problems of causality.  Do I want to go
out tonight? you ask.  Do I want to go out tonight?  How can I begin to
address this question?
        And so I picked a few of the more disfigured options off the branches
at random and fixed them for you here.

Things you've depended on all your life can turn out to be gimmicks, bullshit,
a waste of your time. Before jumping into that "great deal," before going for
that credit card, before you make any serious decision, financially or not,
look into it and read between the lines. If you jump in to some seemingly
unbeatable deal you could be trapped in the runaround for eternity. Your only
salvation then? Kill Yourself!
