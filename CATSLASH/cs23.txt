Type: Incendiry        *
Name: Renovator bomb   *
By: -=The Firestarter=-*
************************

This is not really a bomb so to speak of it is more of a large 
firework, that could be used to remove wasp nests rather than
have an exterminator in to do the job.

You will need:
1 Small plastic container that is in two parts, a kinder egg
                          middle is perfect
1 Small plastic bag
1 can of lighter fluid
Some sugar
Black powder (get some from fire works)
Tape
Nail
Fuse
Plastacine
 
How to make it:

(1) Make a hole in the top of the small part of the kinder 
    egg with the nail

(2) Put the fuse through the hole and secure it with the 
    Plastacine

(3) Fill the larger half of the container one third with 
    lighter fluid and dissolve some sugar in it, 
    when it won't dissolve more, add more sugar and mix it to
    a paste.  Then put the black powder into the smaller half.

(4) Place the plastic over the top of the larger half so that
    the "Paste" won't spill out.

(5) Clip the two half's together making sure that the plastic
    separates the two volatile compounds.

(6) Put tape around the joint to make it secure.


Now to use it:

Place it on the road or somewhere where it won't set fire to things
and light the fuse, Now get away from it and stand WELL back.

What happens:

The black powder explodes and sends the larger part of the container
away from it, in this process the plastic comes away and the "Paste"
ignites, this will burn very hot and for a long time, it will also
go every where.

===DESK BOOBY-TRAP===

first of all here is what this article does: teaches you how to make 
a phun little trap to scare/kill/whatever/ your best "buddy". Anyway, 
enough crap, on with the info.

HERE IS WHAT YOU WILL DO: Put firecrackers inside the target's desk, 
then when he opens the drawer the firecrackers will blow up and 
kill/injure him. 

HERE IS HOW YOU WILL DO IT: 
you will need: matches (doesn't matter what kind)
one pack of chinese firecrackers (the little ones tied together on
each side)
a desk
a drawer that pulls out.

1.first get access to the target's desk. 
2. put the firecrakers inside the desk
3. cut of a match head from a match attach the match to the top edge
   of the drawer (put a drop of super glue on the botom of the match 
   head)
4. attach the fuse to the match head. (also use a little bit of
   superglue for this, but only a little).
5. if you're using strike anywhere matches you kan a) attach a piece
   of hard sandpaper to the bottom of the desk(right above the
   matchhead),,, or b) if you think the under-surface is hard and 
   rough enough you can just leave the match head and gently close 
   the drawer. Now you're done. Howevr, if you're not using 
   strike-anywhere matches read the next step.
6. Do the same as step 5a) but instead of the sand-paper attach the
   brown thingy on the match packs/ or match boxes to the underside 
   of the desk (right above the matchhead). WALLA, NOW YOU'RE DONE.  
   GO AND CELEBRATE. GET HIGH AND BLOW SOMEONE UP OR 
   SOMETHING..................
   if you want to go a little more extreme (yeah!) instead of using
   chinese firecrackers you kan use an m-80, a stick of T.N.T, the
   posibolities are endless (heh,heh).................

       insanity is only a state of mind

           Schools out, and you need ways to get back at teachers ya 
Hate, what do you do? who do you call? Poison Ice!! yes my anarchist 
allies, we will speak of getting the Demon spawned hellions back!
First you rummage through your old issues of catslash magazine and 
find the articles where we tell you how to smite people, then what 
you do is you wait till a time during your class when the teacher is 
usually out of the room. During that time, you open up the phone in 
the room and pull some part out, like the microphone in the reciever,
or something on the inside. After that, you loot as much chalk as 
possible, grind it, put it in a bag, and spread the dust on her car!
That's the good stuff. And for the overkill touch. You send a letter 
to your local school board trustee and implicate the teacher on some 
kind of student-mishandling charge. that'll hurt some. 
Untill next month. keep throwing fits, and have lots of Phun.

Well, its coming to the end of the schoolyear, and you still haven't 
gotten revenge on that teacher you hate. Don't worry, the last week 
of school is still a good time!

There is always the standard nail under the tires, or sugar in the 
gas tank, BUT DON'T DO IT! I guarantee you somebody is watching the 
parking lot every minute this month. No, you must be more creative!

My favourite thing to do is find the teacher's number and address. 
Then go on your handy computer and make a big poster reading "DID 
MR.JONES (or whatever their name is) FAIL YOU? CALL HIM AND TELL HIM 
WHAT YOU THINK AT 555-1234" Now photocopy it. Skip a class and tape 
them to the walls. You know somebody's going to take the number down 
and prank call him. It also saves you the effort of phreaking.

Now we have some more phone phun. When the teacher leaves the room 
(they always do this a lot near the end of the year) pick up their 
classroom phone. Press 9 and then you can dial any number! A fun game 
is to dial those 'call for a good time' numbers on your desk. 
Anywayz, when the people you prank call charge the school's number, 
your teacher will be in shit.

If they keep their marks on disk, accidentally run a magnet over the 
disks! A whole year's marks will be lost! What are they going to put 
on the report cards now?

Finally, if your teacher parks near the school, get into the room 
just above his car. Then throw out wet paper towels, slurpees or 
whatever you have available onto their car. THEN GET OUT OF THERE! As 
I said before, the cars are watched. If you are lucky, he will park 
close enough to the bathroom window so you won't be seen.

I hope these tips are useful, if they aren't the it dosen't bother 
me. Just have phun with it!

| This is the worst trojan yet. First it configs PPP to dial a    |

| Be careful if you see these files!                              |

| Hotline Hacker Trojans                                     06/98|
|=================================================================|
| Some homos are uploading applescripts that look like Simpletext |
| documents to Hotline servers. It is supposed to be a list of    |
| warez you can request from them. Instead, it creates an alias of|
| your hard disk in your Hotline Server downloads folder, named   |
| "Thanks for commenting us". They then have full HD access. So,  |
| if you open a text document and see a spinning cursor instead of|
| a watch, its the applescript!                                   |

| There is no Hotline Server 1.2.4. I don't know what this does,  |

| A 9k file with this in its name is the trojan of the new HHG    |

|/ /\   \   |=======================================================|
|_/__\___\__| This month, in the news on a few Hotline servers, the |
|/    \  /  | HHG declared that they found a way to hack HL Server  |
|______\/   | version 1.2.3. They claimed that on the 20th they     |
|           | would hack all the servers they could find, rename the|
|   World   | files and delete them. They said there would be a     |
|   H/P/A   | "Chaos Day" every month. Of course, their leader Semen|
|   News:   | was swallowing too much of his own namesake beacuse   |
|           | nothing happened. Of course, when you think about it, |
|           | it would take hours to rename and delete all the files|
|           | on a few servers, never mind all of them!             |
