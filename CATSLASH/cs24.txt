Another issue of CS is here! This month we have two new writers, 
Cocain and MrBumpy to help provide you with amusement. Its a good 
thing they sent in stuff too, because only me and X-con wrote 
anything else. Even Poison skipped out this month.

Oh well, next month our anniversary issue comes out. That'll be two 
years of Catslash! 

Until then, enjoy this...

           ''''''''''''''''''File #2 of 9 ''''''''''''''
                             '''''''''''''

I wouldn't recommend doing this at home...but school or if your in on college
or something like a hostile. 

What items do I need?
---------------------
1. An electrical output (A wall Plug)
2. Something to put into the wall plug like a hairdryer.
   This item will be useless afterwards and it must be something that uses
   electricity.
3. Something that consists of metal but it must be real thin.
   Copper wire will work really good. But if your in school and suddenly
   you got the chance to do it, pencil led works too and is easiest too
   use since it's really thin.(Like the led from a pacer or pushpencil)

What to I do next?
------------------
The plug on the hairdryer or kettle (I'll be using HD from now on, it stands
for hairdryer) should look something like this :
                 
                   PLUG
                   ----
                    __
                   /  \      
                  / {}-\------ M3 (Biggest Metal Thingy)
                 /      \
                /        \
               /          \
  M1 ---------|--{}    {}--|--------M2 (Metalpiece2)
(metalpiece)   ------------
                    | |
                    | |-------------Wire to Electrical wall outlet

Now forget completely about M3. We now need only cocentrate on M1 and M3.
Now if the plug is allready in the wall socket, the switch is off and the
device is unattended, take the piece pencilled and put it between the wall
and the plug that it touches and thus connects M1 and M2. It should look
something like this :

              __  |-----------The Wall
             |  |=|
             |  |=|-----------M3 
             |  | | 
             |  |.|----------- Pencil led lying over and touching both  
  The Plug---|  |=|            M1 and M2 (The point)
             |  |=|-----------M1 and behind it M2.  
              --  | 
                  |

If you couldn't get a time to be alone with the HD while it's in the wall
you could just get it one day while it's lying perhaps on your roommates
bed and take a screwdriver and open the thing open and do something like
this.

                    __
                   /  \      
                  / {}-\------ M3 (Biggest Metal Thingy)
                 /      \
                /        \          The Piece of metal wire lying over M1
               / ________-\--------- and M2.
  M1 ---------|--{}    {}--|--------M2 (Metalpiece2)
(metalpiece)   ------------
                    | |
                    | |-------------Wire to Electrical wall outlet

You could keep the wire in place with some prechewed gum or glue or anything.
Then close the thing up again. Remember, some plugs could just be pulled
right off. The reason you'd have to open the thing up is so that the moron
doesn't see it and take it of before he puts it into the wall socket.

What would happen next?
-----------------------

As soon as the switch on the wall is being switched on, some cool big blue
flames jump right out!!(Happens about 90% of the time). The second thing is,
that the equipment is fucked afterwards, so is the wall plugs and sometimes
the wires from the wall outlet thing should be replaced too! Then off course
the electricity gets tripped, but that doesn't need a genius too repair since
you only have to pull the trip switch up again at the big electrical box
thing. Have Phun!!

           ''''''''''''''''''File #3 of  9 ''''''''''''''
                             '''''''''''''

I'm not too sure if you have read the file by Morbid Angel of "Maim" on
how to make a stung gun using a camera flash, so I have included the 
useful bits of that file with this one.
So your saying now, "why the hell do we need this file"
well, because this is an Idea that I just thought of in bed after 
browsing through my files and reading this one.
well, here is MorBid Angels File. (Well, the important part)

        ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
EQUIPMENT: This is what you'll need:

1 camera flash (rip this out of a cheap camera or buy a seperate one, get the
  flashes that run off of a couple of double A's)
1 hobby box (large enough to fit your disassembled flash in, get one WITHOUT a
  metal base plate! Buy these from Dick Smith, etc.)
2 stainless steel nails
2 1.3 volt AA batteries (for the flash)
1 soldering iron and solder
1 tube of super glue
1 pair of wire cutters

        ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
METHOD:

1. First of all disconnect any batteries from your camera flash.
2. Take apart the camera flash and chuck out all the excess plastic container.
3. Locate the flash tube (the bit that flashes, duh!), and cut the two wire that  
   lead to it.
3. Taking these two wires and solder each one to a seperate nail.
4. Now prepare your hobby box buy cutting two holes large enough to slide the
   point of a nail through (the nails should be about .5 cm apart), and cut a
   whole for the switch that was hooked up to the flash originally. Super glue
   all the parts in place. Carefully connect up your batteries (the battery
   compartment should be still intact if you didn't butcher the camera flash too  
   much when you were taking it apart). Ensure there are no exposed wires
   touching each other. The finished hobby box should look like this:

                      ò€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€À
                      3               3
                 <====3    ††         3
                 <====3               3             <==== - nails
                      3               3             ò€€€À - hobby box
                      Ë€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€ô                †† - switch

5. Screw on the base plate and you're ready to rock.

        ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
USE: To use it just flick on the switch and you should hear a high pitch squeal
starting to get louder. Turn the switch off (the longer you leave it on the
greater the shock will be) and holding the box touch someones skin with the
tips of both the nails. They should be a) in pain for quite a while or b) dead :)
I won't go into the shit you can do with this thing as it is pretty damn
obvious just be very carefull not to shock yourself and not to be busted with it.
If you are busted with this thing in OZ you will be arrested at gun point for
possessing a dangerous weapon. If you get into any trouble with this, deny you
knew it was a stun gun and say that you used it to test circuits by hooking it
up to one end of a circuit and a voltimeter to the other, and say that you need
a large amount of current to get past the powerfull resistors you use or some
bullshit like that. Anyway have phun ;)

        ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
        .\\orbid .\ngel
           =MAIM= Snr

        ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
____________                             __________                ___________

So there you have it. A simple Stungun, I haven't done this, that is why
I am including that file. This is just an Idea. So anyway, on  with the
stun gun glove.

Well, I thought that if instead of connecting the wires from the flash  
to the nails you could join some more wire on and then solder each wire 
to a thumb tack. Then if you had a rubber glove, you could sitck the 
thumb tacks to the glove with tape or something, and have the other bit 
strapped to your arm. You'd have a pretty groovy little weapon.

Well, Like I said, I haven't tried it. So don't come whining to me 
because it didn't work. Its just an Idea I got. (hope it does work, hmm
gotta get me a camera flash)

Oh well, that's my great file over.

                          SIMPLE DEATH TRAP

      >><><>?<?><><<<><><<<<<><<><><<<<<<>>>>>>>><><><><>>

For this little trap all u need is a hammer, a door that opens 
inwards (into the room) and your roommate... I uhh mean a target. Now 
all u have to do is (oh by the way make sure the hammer is metal and 
not a plastic toy one, those just don't work)as I was saying, all u 
have to do is open the door a bit then from the inside place the 
hitting part of the hammer on the top of the door  and the wooden 
(whatever) part of the hammer on the door seal. Then sneak out of the 
room either through a window or squezze thruogh the door. If u want 
ofcourse u kan use two hamers or maybe 3? hell, why stope there just 
blow up the damn house! ha-ha

           ''''''''''''''''''File #5 of 9 ''''''''''''''
                             '''''''''''''

So you're going camping this summer. You get to the campsite and 
discover it is about $10.00 more and you can't afford that. Then, 
later on you want to plug in your CD player or something and your 
fucked. Not if you try this!

You have to remember that in most campsites (except for those in 
nature preserves like Kananaskis), they have bathrooms and lights 
around the road, which ususally have power run to them, you just have 
to tap it.

What to pack to scam power:
===========================
- At least 3 long extension cords (you need a LOT of length)
- A light socket to outlet divider
- Wire Cutters
- A screwdriver set
- A crowbar

Now, the first and most common way is to get the light socket to 
outlet splitter. They look like this:
 
                  <--^-->  <----- Screws into lightbulb socket
                  <----->
               ___|     |
   AC Plug --> || |      \
               ||_|___   / <---- Lightbulb socket
                       \/

Now you unscrew the lightbulb outside/inside the bathroom and screw 
this in. Then you put the bulb into one side and plug your extension 
cords into the other. Run the cords home and you have power.

The second way is the easiest. Some bathrooms have shaver plugs in 
them. Just plug in your extension cord and run it out the window back 
to you.

The final way is if you are desperate. Find the pipe on the side of 
the bathroom or light post that looks like this:
 __
(  ) Now, get your screwdrivers and take out the screws in the round 
 ||  part. The metal cover will come off and you will see four wires
 ||  which are miretted to each other (see below). Take off the 
 ||  mirettes. Now cut off the pronged end of your extension cord.
         __                
        /  \ <-- Mirette  (To take off mirette twist it
       /____\              counter clockwise)
       // \\ <-- Wire
      //   \\
Inside your extension cord will be three wires. The ones that are 
white and black are the ones we want. Inside the pipe you will see a 
white wire and a black wire coming up from the ground. Connect the 
cord wires to these, with the mirette. BE CAREFUL! The wires coming 
from the ground are hot and will give you a good jolt when you touch 
them. The wires should be connected to their own color (ie. black to 
black, white to white). Now run the cord home.

Now you can have free power if you need it. Have fun!

|____/__\___| The police this month raided an apartment in the Mill |
|   /    \  | Woods area and found tons of bomb making chemicals and|
|  /      \ | books. The police said all chemicals were still in an |
|   Local   | inactive form, so everyone was safe. People said that |
|   H/P/A   | he always kept to himself, so the only question I can |
|   News:   | think of is who called in the tip?                    |
