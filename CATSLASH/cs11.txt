Well, this was not a phun month. There was the final exams at school, 
trouble with three writers, and to top it all off: Boom Boom Resigned! 
That's right, he can no longer write for us. However, he promises to 
hand in a really cool last article for the anniversary (August) issue.
So, I guess we'll be short one writer for the time being. 
As for Boom Boom, we thank you for your work in Catslash!

Now onto issue 11!

Here's a way to make a rocket warhead that blows up on contact. This 
was one of my best designs on my wrist rockets, however IT IS VERY 
DANGEROUS TO MAKE. Be careful.

Materials needed:
=================
- A hollow nose cone, cigar tube etc.
- A thumbtack
- A shotgun shell

How to build it:
================
                                        A SHOTGUN SHELL
Take the shotgun shell, and empty         ________
all the powder out of it, the lead       |OOOOOOOO|<- lots of lead 
balls, the fibre crap, EVERYTHING.       |OOOOOOOO|   balls.        
You will notice on the bottom, a         |OOOOOOOO|
little metal cylinder or case.           |/\/\/\/\|<- Fibre weave
This is the primer case. BE              |/\/\/\/\|
EXTREMELY CAREFUL WITH THIS. It          |/\/\/\/\|
explodes very easily.                    |/\/\/\/\|
                                         |********|<- Black Powder
Cut of all the red or beige plastic      |** __***|
in the shell. you now just have the      |**|  | <--- Primer 
metal end. File away the metal end      _|__|__|__|_  Cartridge
so that it fits in your nosecone. If 
you can, file it all the way so that you just have the primer 
cartridge. Be careful to stop every once in a while so you don't 
create too much heat or file into the primer.

Now, shove the primer cartridge into the nosecone. On the other side, 
place a tack with its point through the top of the nosecone and onto 
the top of the primer cartridge (the top is the end that was visible 
on the outside bottom of the shotgun shell) . CAREFULLY place some 
Scotch tape over the tack and the top of the nosecone (if you think 
you will set it off, don't do it, it just makes sure the tack stays 
on the rocket).Here's a diagram:

                          ___ <---------Head of tack
                        __ |__
                       //__|__<--------- Point of tack
                      |||:::::|<-------- Primer Cartridge
                      |||_____|||
                      ||*******<---------- Explosive
                      ||*******||
                      ||*******||

How it works:
=============
When the rocket's nose hits something solid, the tack punches into 
the primer, setting it off. The primer, like in a bullet, sets off 
the explosive. 

This is more reliable than most systems where the third engine stage 
sets off the explosive. Have phun!

Here's a fun classic anarchist game. I have no idea who invented the 
game, but it has become a hit in the anarchist society. The 'Pin the 
Rocket' display at the Anarchon (1995) was a huge hit. Well enough of 
the history...onto the instructions!

Materials:
===========
- 1 1"diameter pipe
 - 1 lighter or a pack of matches (lighter works better)
  - several packs of rocket engines
   - two anarchists who are bored
    - some lamer walking around a field or in a forest etc.
      (if no lamer can be found just fire at anyone you see)

Instructions:
==============

1. Insert a rocket engine, igniter side towards you, into the pipe.
2. Have one anarchist balance it on his shoulder and aim at moron.
3. Other anarchist lights igniter end of engine with lighter. Make 
   sure you pull your hand back FAST!
4. Fwooooossshhhh! Rocket engine fires and flies towards target!

How to win:
===========
If you hit the guy, you get a point. If the quy dodges, he gets a 
point. Of course, winning really dosen't mean anything for him...

Maybe one day an olympic sport will come out of this. Until then... 
have phun!

I bid you all greetings my people, I have the best fun game for all
of the pranksters and pranksters at heart, just sit and read as I 
tell you my game.

        Ok everybody, this is how to play the particular game in 
        question, its called:

                       Election Day Mischeif
                       [[[[[[[[[]]]]]]]]]]]]

Game nescessities: 
at least 2 players but no more than 4 players, Each player requires 
some form of land conveyance unless they are in teams, some accurate 
form of keeping score,and some kind of election happening.

The object of the game is to get as many election signs as possible 
and place them on the lawn of someone you hate, each team in a 
decisive pile, whoever has the most in their pile wins. You can't 
steal signs from the other team, wound the other players, sabotage 
their veichles, or rat them out. This will result in immediate 
disqualification.

Well, I hope you have fun, please don't get busted by the cops. If 
you have any questions concerning the game, please mail either Bungie 
or myself wherever the hell you picked this up. As for me, I say: 
Have a hell of a night! aha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha (I even typed out my 
meniachal laugh).

Recently, a phriend asked me how to get past someon's screen door, 
since the lock looked very hard to pick. The way in, is actually 
quite simple.

For those of you who are wondering, the screen door we are talking 
about is the type of metal door with a small screen in it, that is 
usually in front of their main door. It usually has something you 
push to open it, like a button. It swings back and closes itself. If 
you still can't figure it out, e-mail me at Bethlehem.

Anywayz, the way in is simple. Hit the button or latch really hard 
and pull toward you at the same time. This will jolt the door open, 
allowing you in. See? pretty damn easy...

Have phun!

\                  5 Ways to Ride the Bus for Free!                 /

                             ''''''''''''
Over this past year, I have had to think up many schemes to get my 
phriends on the bus when their car broke and they had no money. 
These were some good ideas:

1. Get on the bus with your bus pass. Move to the back of the bus, 
   and sit on a seat with an open window. Slip your friend the pass 
   through the window.
2. When the bus driver is at a station like Belvedere or Clairview, 
   he will often leave the bus to go smoke or go to the John. Just 
   walk on while he's away.
3. If there are a lot of people getting on the bus at once, just 
   flash your wallet with a card that looks somewhat like a bus pass. 
   Most of them won't even glance at it.
4. Get about 50 cents worth of pennies and nickels. Release them 
   really slowly into the change slot. Chances are, he's not gonna 
   count them all.
5. Place 50 cents worth of cash into the change thing. When he tells 
   you its not enough, demand that he gives it back to you (which of 
   course he can't). He'll probably let you ride just to avoid a 
   scene.

Try these out this summer if your car is broken. After all, they keep
advertising all those changes in Edmonton Transit services...see for
yourself!
