       [ Special SPRING IS HERE WITH A VENGEANCE issue ]
_____________________________________________________________________
Well, its spring again, so you can come outside and do some anarchy! 
We've decided to declare this our special SPRING IS HERE WITH A 
VENGEANCE issue since all of us wrote articles on pyro and vengeance. 

In other news, my alias is changed from Bungie to Reaper now. Due to 
a fuck-up by the Vigilante Corp Anarchy Mail was seized by the 
witchhunters and everybody in the system had to do an alias change. 
It sucks but its better than jail.

Keeping with the changed alias idea, Blackheart is now known as 
Pyrotech, though this is not the VC's fault.

Also, we have two new writers! X-Con has written two articles for 
us, look in files 2 and 8. As well, Firestarter has written an 
acticle in file 3.

In sadder news though, Bethlehem has closed down. R.I.P Bethlehem, 
you were a great disro BBS and an awesome anarchy BBS in general. I 
just hope Lord Mysteriis can find something to do with his time ;-).

Finally, next month will be the April Fool's issue again, it'll all 
be phoney stuff again. Just making sure you don't actually try any of 
it!!!

Well, here we go...enjoy your sweet vengeance...

   Did you know that ink is flameble. Well, if you did then shutup 
and read this article any how. 
  ok, what you do is go to the store and rip off a pack of those 
white cheap bic pens. then go to your usual burning place and get a 
lighter or a match or something. Hold the match up to the tip of the 
pen and wait for the plastic crap to fall down. Then the good stuff 
comes. Ones the ink starts to fizz and crap you can let go of the 
lighter, or whatever and the pen should be able to burn. there you've 
got your little torch, but after a while the ink starts dripping 
down, usually flaming. there, you've down it. If you have any 
questions or comments for me email me at : xcon0@yahoo.com or Reaper 
at catslash@hotmail.com
  AS I ALWAYS SAY: WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG, IT'S  EVERYBODY 
ELSE WHO'S SCRED UP, WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT.

If your loser gets a parking ticket, get it before he sees it. 
Write a message on the back insulting the police and send it in with
no money.

Laxatives slipped into your loser's food do wonders. Try this on his
dog's food too - It'll shit everywhere!

If your flatmates ever steal your milk, put laxatives in it-that'll 
teach 'em! Remember not to drink it yourself of course.

If your loser is about to approach his house or car, place your lighter
under the door handle for a minute or two. Stand back and cover your 
ears! Dog shit or pins placed under the handle works well too.

Spread a little petrol or paint thinner on your loser's car and this 
will make his paint run and fade. Vodka will eat the paint off and so 
will eggs if they sit there long enough.

Old but good: put detergent in your loser's kettle and / or toilet 
cistem. Loads of foam, and a bastard to remove.

A sturdy generic scam for an outdoor party or public place is to 
discretely pour lighter fuel over a dog shit and set it alight. Some 
upstanding member of the community will, on seeing the flames, do the 
right thing and stamp it out. HAHAHAHAH.

For pure mischief: In a shop, pull off one of those security stickers 
on products and put it (sticky side up) on the floor. Watch it until

Pretty nasty, 'if you're in for this sort of thing: If you get two 
blokes totally passed out after a heavy night out drinking, persuade 
someone to undress them and put them in a bed together. For even more 
effect, persuade the person to go further and rub each of their asses
with an old toothbrush; be as hygienic as possible and use a different 
brush for each bloke. The two blokes will wake up naked next to each 
other with sore asses. They'll never touch another drop again!

Take some gelatine pill capsules and empty their contents down the 
sink. Save the capsules and fill them with blue food colouring or 
permanent dye. Open our losers showerhead and place the pills inside. 
You may need to add just a smear of petroleum jelly to prevent the 
pills rattling around. When our loser takes a shower, the hot water 
will dissolve the capsules and release the blue dye. Especially good 
if your loser has fair hair.

If your loser ever goes out drinking and driving, teach him a lesson 
by smearing some pig's blood or ketchup over his bonnet and stick some 
human hairs to it. When he gets up the next day, and before he has seen
his car, chat casually to him about there being an horrific hit-and-run
incident on the news last night.

A nasty trick if you're on holiday or you are a student living in 
halls. Your victim must have a small gap under their door. Acquire an 
old LP cover, Neil Diamond will do fine. Make sure it has some spring 
left in it and does not lie exactly flat. Fill the LP cover with yellow
water paint, the kind you used to use at school. Now place the LP cover
with the opening facing your victim's door and stamp up and down on it 
yelling 'Gas attack, everybody down.'


Forget Pavlov's dogs and start on pigeons. Get some birdseed and spread
it around on your local or school football pitch whilst blowing a 
whistle. Do this a few times until you've got the birds trained. When 
the football season starts the referee or PE teacher will have a 
miniature pitch invasion on his hands.

If you have the misfortune of entertaining your loser at dinner, why 
not get some entertainment yourself by adding some bodily fluids' to 
his food. There's nothing quite like watching your loser eating his 
meal while you know that it is not as pure as your own.

My collegues, It is the month of march, Valentines day is weeks past 
any many couples have broken up, tears have been shed and hearts are 
broken. But the damage is done, now its time for VENGEANCE!!! This 
month we will talk of good ways to get back at your former honey, 
lets get started shall we?

Now a lot of this stuff is only good in a school setting, keep that 
in mind as you plot your actions, and remember, DON'T HURT ANYONE 
PHYSICALLY!!! Get it, got it, good!

But before I get started, I want to address a problem, I've been 
taking a lot of flack lately about the Vengeance Column not being 
"vengeancy" enough. Basically, to those few I say "Go back to Israel
you pansy-assed faggots!" all those who disagree can email me at 
Harrysachz@Mailexcite.com.

Now to work! First you get a bag and some Jello, make the Jello the 
night before to make sure it holds together. Then the next day you go 
to his/her locker, put the Jello in the bag with a little hole in the 
bottom and leave it in his/her locker. The lack of refrigeration will 
cause the Jello to lose it's consistency and it will ooze all over 
the locker's contents. When that's done, you go on the internet, look 
up the personal ads and submit one for him/her in the gay personals 
for whatever city your in, they will get a response. This happened to 
a friend of mine and he was infuriated. A third thing to do would be 
to glue the back of the ex's lock to his/her locker, preventing the 
loser from opening the locker long enough for the Jello to sludge 
over everything. And there you go, three ways to get back at your 
former significant other.

This is a variation on the game "Pin The Rocket on the Moron" detailed in a
previous issue of CATSlash. Since I know some of you can't get the issue and
others are just too fucking lazy, I will reproduce the article IN ITS ENTIRETY
(including the spelling mistakes, so don't think that I cannot spell) here:

                                     ''''''''''''
        Here's a fun classic anarchist game. I have no idea who invented the 
        game, but it has become a hit in the anarchist society. The 'Pin the 
        Rocket' display at the Anarchon (1995) was a huge hit. Well enough of 
        the history...onto the instructions!

        Materials:
        ===========
        - 1 1"diameter pipe
         - 1 lighter or a pack of matches (lighter works better)
          - several packs of rocket engines
           - two anarchists who are bored
            - some lamer walking around a field or in a forest etc.
              (if no lamer can be found just fire at anyone you see)

        Instructions:
        ==============

        1. Insert a rocket engine, igniter side towards you, into the pipe.
        2. Have one anarchist balance it on his shoulder and aim at moron.
        3. Other anarchist lights igniter end of engine with lighter. Make 
           sure you pull your hand back FAST!
        4. Fwooooossshhhh! Rocket engine fires and flies towards target!

        How to win:
        ===========
        If you hit the guy, you get a point. If the quy dodges, he gets a 
        point. Of course, winning really dosen't mean anything for him...

        Maybe one day an olympic sport will come out of this. Until then... 
        have phun!

        (File ends here)

My variant:
Extra requirements:
The rocket engines need to be 'D' size or better.
The igniters from the rocket engines (the thin bent piece of wire with 
phosphorus in the middle)
Some gauze (metal mesh, don't use plastic cause it melts)
Glue (cyanoacrylate or Superglue or something that is heat-resistant.)
Some Corks (I dunno, go get tanked up on wine and use those corks, but do not do
this when wasted)
Stanley Knife Blades. These are used as trimming blades. They look a bit like
this shitty drawing:
           _______ _ ________
          /             U U  \
         /                    \
        /______________________\
        <------2 inches-------->

The 2 U's are notches in the blunt side of the blade.
Before you do anything with this strip about half of the heavy cardboard from
the engine so it is narrower and therefore lighter and therefore faster.
Take the blade and narrow it by cutting it or breaking it in a vice
to about 1/3 to 1/2 of the way up from the sharp bit.
Now you may want to narrow the ends even more to help it fit in the cork and so
it goes more smoothly into someone's head. (I have killed someone with this
while I was going through the final tests even though it was phlukey (flukey)
aim, so do not take this phile lightly and use it for casual phun (well unless
you really want to)).

The obvious bit: the flechette goes into the cork and the cork goes on the
non-burning end of the rocket engine. Insert the igniter in the other end and
close it off with the plug provided.

The gauze is glued over one end of the pipe and the completed rocket is dropped
in igniter end first. The igniter wires should be poking out of the holes in the
gauze.

Now, aim it at the target, and touch the wires to the terminals on the battery.

As in the previous article, FWOOOOOSH!!! The rocket files toward the target and,
hopefully, embeds itself in their head.

        Have phun!!!
        Pyrotech.

                             '''''''''''''

 NOTE: I use "her" as it is a girl i'm talking about. However this    
       doesn't mean that it won't work equally well on guys.There is 
       this bitch who lives near me who nobody likes as she has 
       spread rumours about half the village, so we finally decided 
       all-out WAR wasÿneeded to trash her life. 
 NOTE: this works best on girls but it would be ok on guys too, you 
       might need to alter some of the methods.
 ÿ
 1)Preliminary assault:
   We observed her patterns for a week, where she goes after 
   school,what time she gets home at, etc. After learning this we had 
   some guysfollow her for a whole week and talk loudly about the 
   slag/bitch/lesbian just up ahead of them. She got totally paranoid 
   and was looking around frantically every time she left her house.
 ÿ
 2)Stage 2:
   After this, we had a group of people hang around both ends of her 
   road from straight after school until about 8 or 9 at night every 
   day. If she walked past us we would intimidate her or try to trip 
   her up. HOWEVER, if your victim is the squealer type, these last 
   two stages aren't very effective as you will get in shit from her 
   parents and maybe even the pigs. So, moving onto
 ÿ
 3)Valentines
   It was around valentines week when things really climaxed. We 
   spent the whole week preparing sick cards to send to her
   EXAMPLES:
   cover - Roses are red, violets are blue...
   inside - When I masturbate I think of you (smear toothpaste or 
   shaving foam all over the inside of the card)
   cover - Roses are red, violets are blue...
   inside - Next time I see you I'll rape and murder you
 ÿ
  those are just 2 of the many we sent her...use your imagination!!!
 ÿ
 4)puters
   If your victim has a puter, you are in luck. Make a diskette bomb 
   (see below), or, if you prefer the more subtle approach, write a 
   virus (ATTN: NEVER D'LOAD A VIRUS AND PLOP IT ON A FLOPPY DISK, 
   CHANCES ARE, IT WILL BE FOUND BY A VIRUS SCANNER. A
   HOMEMADE VIRUS WILL BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO SPOT.) When you've 
   done whatever you want to to the disk, put a fancy label
   on it, print out a couple of leaflets about the "program" eg THIS 
   DATABASE WILL REVOLUTIONISE YOUR LIFE or something like that,
   bullshitting about how great the program is. Just so long as they     
   use the bloody disk. Make it look realistic.
 ÿ
 Diskette Bombsÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ by the Jolly Roger
 You need:
 ÿ- A disk
 ÿ- Scissors
 ÿ- White or blue kitchen matches (they MUST be these colors!)
 ÿ- Clear nail polish
 - Carefully open up the diskette (3.5" disks are best for this!)
 - Remove the cotton covering from the inside.
 - Scrape a lot of match powder into a bowl (use a wooden scraper,   
   metal might spark the matchpowder!)
 - After you have a lot, spread it evenly on the disk.
 - Using the nail polish, spread it over the match mixture
 - Let it dry
 - Carefully put the diskette back together and use the nail polish 
   to seal it shut on the inside (where it came apart).
 - When that disk is in a drive, the drive head attempts to read the 
   disk, which causes a small fire (ENOUGH HEAT TO MELT THE DISK  
   DRIVE AND FUCK THE HEAD UP!!). ahahahahaha! Let the fuckhead try 
   and fix THAT!!!ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ -Jolly Roger-
 ÿ
 5)Indimitation
   Now, start hanging around in big groups of maybe ten opposite your 
   victim's house, with a stereo at full blast. Give your victim 
   dirty looks and
   mouth things at them, etc. when they leave the house. This is good 
   because they get freaked, especially if they are the timid type.
 ÿ
 6)Vandalism
   If you can get access to the person's bedroom, this is a great 
   place to phuck them over. Come armed with dead animals, fake 
   blood, fake vomit, fake shit, shaving foam, fake (or real) semen 
   (if you cant get any of this milk of magnesia is good). Now you're 
   ready. This is better if you carry it out over a series of days, 
   but certain bedrooms will be good for planting everything at once. 
   Put the fake semen or whatever into their bed.
   Then if one of their parent's is changing the sheets, if it's a 
   boy they will think he had a wet dream or was wanking, and if it's 
   a girl they will
   think she had a fella in bed with her when they were out. Put the 
   shaving foam in their shoes. Fake blood goes on the really good 
   clothes, fake vomit under the pillow, and fake shit in pockets. 
   You might want to change some of this around to suit the person in  
   question.
 ÿ
 7)Serious terrorism
   OK, you've done all the above, now you wanna go in for the kill.   
   Start sending death threats,ÿ a trickle at first and then loads.  
   NOTE: when you send mail go to a different district so it will be 
   stamped as being from a different postal district. On your death  
   threats sign them something like "The Kill xxxxx Association" or 
   "Death to Fuckheads Anonymous". Something that will frighten them.  
   Then send them a message saying "The end is nigh. We've had our 
   fun, now we want to finish you off. Soon we will kidnap you and 
   torture you, before slowly and painfully murdering you. Don't 
   think mummy and daddy will save you this time........"
   After this, plant spies around your victim's house. When she 
   leaves the house, have them tell some other people - 3 or 4 is the  
   best number, and have them wear masks and surround her on the 
   road. DON'T BEAT HER UP, the last thing you want is to be caught 
   for GBH, because she'll probably have a fair idea of who it is. 
   Ask for money (try to disguise your voice). If she gives it to 
   you, fine, you've made a bit of cash out of this. Then tell her to 
   push off and leave. If she doesn't give it to you, make like 
   you're going to hit her. When she starts to run, chase her until 
   she gets about 50 metres away from her house. Have a change of 
   clothes and some bags to keep the masks in in a bush nearby, then 
   get as far away as possible.
 ÿ
Now you should have well and truly fucked up someone's life. 
Hopefully the pigs won't bust you (they'll use the smallest excuse 
sometimes, funnily enough) and your victim will never bother anyone 
again. If they do, just start the terrorism again.
That's it from me for now, next month: TORTURE!!! THE COMPLETE GUIDE

                             '''''''''''''
Me and DreD drew up this plan to get back at an enemy that lived far 
away. We only wanted a one day strike and this worked out damn well.

Equipment needed:
:::::::::::::::::
- Beige Box (see issue 1)
- Assasin Box (see file ASSASIN.BOX on phreaking web pages)
- Napalm (see issue 3)
- Thermite (see file 10 in the Jolly Roger Cookbook)
- Blowtorch
- Magnesium Ribbon (from your school's chem lab)
- Cement mix (quick dry)
- Oil (1L at least), gas, or WD40 spray can(s)
- Toilet Paper
- Gas
- Old housekey
- spraypaint
- Brake fluid

Got all that? If you can't find some things, don't worry, just make 
sure you have lots of gas! (Its the main thing man!)

Preparation:
::::::::::::
1) Test your Beige box on your lightening arrestor to be sure it 
   works!
2) Build the assasin box and get a battery for it
3) Make the napalm and thermite. Mix the toilet paper with some gas.
   Put the napalm and toilet paper stuff in jars.

ok, we're ready to go...

On the Site
:::::::::::
First you must find them, in whatever way you use. Then you have to 
get there. A car is best but a bike can work too (just cut down on 
supplies). If you use a car splash a bit of mud on the plates, just 
to be sure. Once you're on site:

First you attack the house...
1) Pour oil, gas etc on the lawn. This will kill the grass. Try to 
   spell shit like FUCK YOU, I AM GAY, DEAD GRASS etc. 
2) Break the old key in his deadbolt lock
3) Pour cement around his doorframe, make a speedbump on his 
   sidewalk, or a good idea is to cut a hole in the screen on his 
   screen door and fill the space between doors with cement! When
   he opens it he'll get a big (and heavy) surprise!
4) Spraypaint stuff all over his house, polka dot his doors, write 
   death threats, do whatever you want with the paint!
 
Now the incoming lines...
5) Open his phone box, find his pair (plug in and dial ANI - In 
   Edmonton its 311) and plug in your beige box. Now call Australia, 
   1-900 numbers, Defcon, or anything that will get him a big phone 
   bill! A cool thing is call time in Australia and leave it off the 
   hook for a long time.
6) When that is done plug in the assasin box. This will give him a 
   shock when he picks up the phone. Its like touching an electric 
   fence with every call!
7) Open up his cable box and disconnect his cable. Crazy glue a cable 
   tube (see last issue) to his line. Now crazy glue his line to the 
   cable tube! OOPS! No more cable TV for one or two weeks! They might
   even have to dig up his lawn (with the words!) to put in a new line!
   Wheeeeeeeeeee.... isnÕt this fun?

Now the car!...
8) Cover his windows with the toilet paper and gas, then cram some 
   napalm up his exhaust pipe. These'll dry and phuck up his car
   real good.
9) Pour the brake fluid all over his paint job, this'll eat off his 
   paint. Key in a nice message while youÕre at it

10) Light the thermite on his hood. You'll need the blowtorch to 
    ignite the magnesium. When the magnesium is lit drop it on the 
    thermite. This stuff is very hot and will burn through his hood, 
    air cleaner, block...If you donÕt have thermite, then just use 
    the blowtorch on his car! It can be almost as fun!

Now we go back to the house...
11) Coat his windows with napalm and light them, THEN GET AWAY FAST!   
    This'll shatter his windows and probably send the police running 
    over.Another good alternative is Polish flare fuel (described in
    issue 18). Flare mix will definately shatter it with its hot blue
    flame.


Escape
::::::
When you are done, leave the area so the police don't get a clothing 
match on you. When the dumb fucker gets home he WILL KNOW SOMEBODY 
HATES HIM!!! If he dosen't then you have picked the wrong enemy!

Finally, I just want to remind you to be careful. If you get caught, 
you can be charged for the property damage, phreaking, and bomb 
threat at least. If you get caught he'll have the ultimate vengeance.
So don't get caught.

Anywayz, have phun!

This is really easy to do. First of all phind a house you don't like
then wait until night time. next go out there and t.p. it. now the
PHUN part = Take a lighter or a match andf light one or two or three
ends of the t.p. on fire, then haul as and watch from a safe 
distance.
You should see a house that looks like it's on fire, (it is). For
added effect you can ring the doorbell so the victim will see the
house and if he's really old he might have a heart attack! ha - ha!

         Catslash Magazine Issue #20, March 1998
---------------------------------------------------------------------
|               Catslash Supporters Final Salute                    |
|               To The Many Phriendz of Catslash                    |
|                          By: Reaper                               |
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Recently, Anarchy Online and Sensory Overload have dissapeared, 
leaving only two adds, and now Bethlehem will be gone
too! So this section of the magazine will dissappear.
Its sorta sad to see all the old groups and boards shutting down
that were once listed here...I guess the internet will end up ruling 
us all. That'll suck so bad.

So we include a final salute to all the BBS's and groups that have 
advertised here. Here we go:
__________________________________________________________

                                     &&
H/P/A, Music, Magic              &&&&&&&&&&        Official CS distro
and more...                          &&            since the beginning
                                     &&
You were the best distro BBS... every anarchist in Edmonton knew your
name. Maybe we'll write a tribute issue. Anyways, we'll miss your
presence on the scene, as well as Lord Mysteriis...
