Its October and time for the greatest season of all! Halloween! So 
its also time for our next halloween issue. The skulls go back on and
we have our halloween story in the mag. 

This month Pyrotech has also written in. I'm bringing your notice to 
this because he's also changed his alias again, this time to 
Maladjusted Freak. So don't get confused...

Finally, I just want to point out that we've decided to go back to 
our old style file headers, not like the ones you've seen in the last 
2 issues. Next month they'll be the same as these except with no 
skulls. I'm just announcing this so next month you don't think we're 
screwed in the heads. That's all...

            '''''''''''''''''File #2 of 14''''''''''''''
                             '''''''''''''

You Need:
Toluene (Don't fucking ask me where to get this from. I tried a 
supply house in London called BDL. The number is +44 181 968 6633 if 
you're interested.)

Nitric Acid (This is used in cleaning photographic plates so try a 
(duh!!) photography shop. If you cannot get it, you will have to make 
it. If so, go on to the next article because i don't have the time to 
type the entire recipe here. Bear in mind that for this purpose it 
has to be strong stuff, at least 80% concentrated.)

Sulphuric Acid (This is the easiest to get. Get a car battery and 
pour and filter the liquid contents. Boil the resultant fluid, over 
and over until it fumes. This ensures the strength of the acid.)

Ice (This is also easy, depending on your home country, it is frozen 
water...)

1 Tub (Large) It is a large plastic thing, suitable for the short 
term containment of liquids.
1 Beaker

Background:
TNT stands for Trinitrotoluene. This means that in 1 molecule of TNT 
there are 3 atoms of nitrogen bonded to 1 atom of toluene (fuel). 
(There are other explosives like this, the most notable being TNP or 
trinitrophenol). When a shockwave (say from a blasting cap) passes 
through the TNT, the bonds are broken and the fuel ignites. This also 
accounts for TNT's relative stability.

What to do with this stuff:
1. In the beaker add the sulphuric acid to the toluene and put the 
Ice and some cold water into the tub. This will help slow the 
reaction for the next bit.

2. Pour the mixture into the tub and add the nitric acid.

3. Add some more cold water. Wait for about 1/2 hour and then filter 
the solution.

4. This can be plasticised by the method shown in the next bit , 
Making Potassium Chlorate. 

THE END (of this bit, anyway).



Making Potassium Chlorate
Also by: Malajdusted Freak

You will need:

A heat source (hot plate, stove, etc.)
A battery hydrometer
A large tub (metal)
Potassium chloride (sold as a salt substitute at health and nutrition 
stores)
1 gallon of bleach (must contain sodium hypochlorite)

1. Heat 1 gallon of the bleach in the tub. While doing so, add 63 
grammes of the potassium chloride into it. 

2. All the time you are heating the solution , check it with the 
hydrometer,  and boil until you get a reading of 1.3.  If using a 
battery hydrometer, boil until you read a FULL charge.

Take the solution and allow it to cool in a refrigerator until it is 
below room temperature.  Filter out the crystals that have formed and 
save them.  Boil this solution again and cool as before.  Filter and 
save the crystals.

Take the crystals that have been saved, and mix 56 grams per 100 
milliliters of distilled water.  Heat this solution until it boils 
and allow to cool.  Filter the solution and save the crystals that 
form upon cooling.  This process of purification is called 
"fractional crystalization".  These crystals should be relatively 
pure potassium chlorate.

Powder these to the consistency of face powder, and heat gently to 
drive off all moisture.

Plasticizing the stuff:

Melt five parts Vaseline with five parts wax.  Dissolve this in white 
gasoline (camp stove gasoline), and pour this liquid on 90 parts 
potassium chlorate (the powdered crystals from above) into a plastic 
bowl.  Knead this liquid into the potassium chlorate until intimately 
mixed.  Allow all gasoline to evaporate.


These explosives can be used in my frag bomb file (but if you have 
already read it, then you'll know).

Be CAREFUL what you do with this stuff. I don't want you all to be 
killed or something while doing something I showed you.

        !!!HALLOWEEN MAYHEM !!!
\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
By: X-Con

Here are some phun ideas for you to do this Halloween. 

+ In the middle of the night go to your target's house and spill
gasoline all over his porch. Then move back, toss a brick at the door,
when he comes out toss a match (for maximum efect it should be lit) on
the porch. Now you can laugh at him all you want. Toss stuff at him
too. preferably cotton balls drenched in gasoline.

+ Go to your target's haunted house when nobody is there. Bring a
chainsaw, crowbar, m-80's. Need I say more?

+ Take a near by jack-o-lantern shove some firewroks/m-80's in it,
light the fuse and toss it up on ther street full of trick or treeters.

+ If your target isn't home. Go to his house (make sure you dress
up)and pass out chocolate candy laced with powerful laxatives.

+ Get a bunch of friends to dress up like cops then go to your marks
house, make a fake search warrant. Also before you do this plant some
drugzzz or something in his basement. Heheheh

+ If you see REALLY little and REALLY dumb kids give them a note and
tell them it's for their mommy and daddy. Have the note say something
like:
hello, this is ____________(mark's name) I gave your kids some candy
which had laundry detergent in it. I have the anecdote, bring me
____(amount of $ you desire) or I will kill you all!

+ Sneak up behind little kids and spray paint nazi signs with glowing
paint on their backs. 


Well that's it. Have lots of fun and remember : putting too much ACiD
in your kandy can kill you!

Well, I'm here again, filling in for Poison who'll be back next 
month. Since its our halloween issue, I though I would go with a 
halloween vengeance theme, since I was inspired by some true dorks 
that tried to harass me and my phriends on halloween.

Now halloween is good and bad for vengeance operations. Its good 
because if you wear a mask to hide your identity, it is normal. Its 
bad because most people with half a brain expect people to be out at 
night having a good time wreaking their property. Overall though, 
it's still good for vengeance.

Now this one is just phun. Have you ever seen one of those halloween 
screamer mats at the San Fransisco's store? When you step on them 
they scream. We'll make one better today.

Take a small piece of plywood, about the size of a doormat. You will 
also need a car battery, some wire, a pushbotton switch, a rocket 
igniter, a straw, and a pail full of flare fuel (mix salt peter and 
sugar together).

Go to your victims house. Tape the switch in the middle of his 
doorstep. Place the car battery as far away as you can, like in his 
flowerbed. Run one wire to the switch, and one from the switch to the 
igniter. Then run one long wire from the igniter back to the battery. 
Put the plywood overtop of the switch, BUT MAKE SURE IT DOSEN'T SET 
OFF THE SWITCH. You may want to use something weak like toothpicks to 
support the plywood over the switch. 

Now snuff out his pumpkin that he has outside and TAKE OUT THE 
CANDLE! Make sure you take it out. Run the igniter in through the 
bottom somewhere. Place the straw right overtop of of one prong and 
fill the pumpkin with flare fuel. Here's a diagram:

                                         _||/__
                           Pumpkin --> ( ||****<---- Flare Fuel     
                                       ( *||<------- Straw

     |       ________________________________|
    _%______%_
   |          |<--- Car Battery
   |__________|

Now we get to the phun part. Ring his doorbell and hide somewhere. 
When he steps onto the plywood, his pumpkin bursts into bright red 
flames! His face will be full of the true meaning of 
halloween...fear!

Making A Fragmentation Grenade
By: Maladjusted Freak (the anarchist formerly known as 
Blackheart/Pyrotech!!)

This article shows you how to make a highly effective antipersonnel 
weapon, the nail grenade.

You Need:
1 block of TNT or other explosive (Try Potassium Chlorate. This is 
easy and fun to make, and has many cool uses). This needs to produce 
a big blast when detonated. It is also good if it is impact-sensitive 
(this saves your blasting caps) or plastic.
Lots and lots of nails (the metal kind, fool!!)
Tape/glue
String
A long ribbon. Yes I know it sounds "wussy" but it is necessary. 
Maybe you could paint it black or something.
A blasting cap (I don't know about this one. I only used impact 
sensitive explosive but I'm not going to tell you which as it would 
only spoil the fun of your experimenting on dozens of innocent 
helpless fatcat bastards who are screwing people out of billions 
every day. The Mentor's last words are coming to this mag. Watch this 
space.)

OK, Here's what you do:

1. Get your block. It should have six faces. Leave two of the 
opposite ones alone and tape, tie or glue nails to the other four. 
(You can have them pointing outwards if you want but then how are you 
going to carry it?)

2. Gently place the cap in(on) one of the free sides so that the 
grenade will fall on it and detonate.

3. Tie the ribbon onto the other side in order to make sure that the 
grenade falls onto the capped side.

4. Throw (preferably from a roof). The ribbon will stream out behind 
the grenade, which will explode on impact with the ground, hopefully 
scything the area clean of every living thing (except you if you're 
careful!!).

The articles concerning TNT and potassium Chlorate are in this issue.

Have Phun!! and don't get caught.

Maladjusted Freak.

/o  o\                    The 90# Phone Scam                   /o  o\
\ || /\                     By: Reaper                        /\ || /

            '''''''''''''''''File #6 of 14''''''''''''''
                             '''''''''''''

This is a neat way to make phree long distance calls at somebody 
else's expense. It was used by the people in the prison only last 
week, until they were caught.

To do this you find a payphone. Put your quarter in and call any 
number, preferably an enemies. Now you have to social engineer the 
person on the other end to make them press 90#. A sample conversation 
is like this:

PERSON: Hello?
PHREAK: Hello, this is the Telus Wirecentre. We're fixing a few 
        problems over here and we would like to know what services 
        you have hooked up. Do you have call waiting?
PERSON: Yes...
PHREAK: Do you have call display?
PERSON: No, I don't.
PHREAK: Ok, could you please press nine, zero, and the pound key and 
        tell me if you hear a short beep.
PERSON: Ok (he presses numbers)

When the person hits that combination, his number becomes your 
dialup. All thanks to a hardware flaw in the exchange!

Right now, Telus is trying to fix the problem, but they havent done 
it so far. Luckily, few people know about this either, mainly only 
big businesses. You should tell your phriends about this too, as 
someone might try this on them. I don't know if this works outside of 
Edmonton, or even how much longer it'll work, but you might want to 
try it and see...have phun!

*** QUICK ADDITION: As I am releasing this issue, one channel is 
broadcasting a news report on this topic. More people may already be 
aware now! Just letting you know...

            '''''''''''''''''File #7 of 14''''''''''''''
                             '''''''''''''

As any pirate knows by now, pay per click banners are becoming part 
of everyday life. In most of the sites on Hotline, you have to click 
a banner, view the resulting page and then take one or two words for 
a password+login (or html document name). I'm also seeing this more 
and more on the http side of the net too. I hate banners, so its time 
for a banner bashing article!

First off, I'll explain how these sites work quickly. When you click 
on one of these banners, it takes you to a special site. For example 
when you click on a Superpay(fictional company) banner, it takes you 
to the www address of :www.superpay.com/banner/123&234
When you reach it a counter and javascript tells them where you are 
from and they pay that guy 30 cents or whatever. That 123&234 tells 
the server who's banner it is. If it was 123&235, it would be a 
totally different person. Get it? So if you have to visit a page and 
don't want the prick to get money, you would just go to 
www.superpay.com and look at it, and nobody would get money.


Also, you have to watch for scams. There are many sites where you 
click the banner and you get nothing for it. Here are 3 main scams 
and ways around them:

1) There is one asshole especially on Hotline who changes his site 
name every few days. When you enter it, it tells you in the news to 
visit a web site to see the files you are getting. It forwards you to 
a banner pay site, he laughs, you lose. To avoid this scam don't 
visit his site. You should never have to leave Hotline to view files 
on a Hotline server. It just dosen't make sense.

2) You visit a warez page in you favourite web browser. You come to a 
page with 6 banners. A message says that you must click all of them 
and one is the real entrance to the site. When you move the mouse 
pointer over it, it gives you a message rather than a link, as would 
be expected. Unfortunately most of the time, none of them get you 
into the site. To avoid this you can do two things. The first is 
click on the link. If it gives you a banner type address, hit the 
stop button. You can also place your mouse pointer over a banner and 
hold the mouse button down until a contextual menu appears. Choose 
'Copy link location'. Paste it in your 'Location:' bar. Do this to 
them all and avoid the banner addresses.

3) You visit a Hotline site, and it tells you to click a banner to 
get access to all these great files. You do it and when you use your 
new login, all the files aren't there. This can be avoided in a few 
ways. The first is to see if any other users are on there. If it 
really has such great files, others will usually be there. Also check 
the file sizes. Some have hundreds of great titles but things like 
Quake are only 6MB. This is obviously a fake. If there is anyone else 
on there message them and ask if the pass works. Don't message the 
admin because he'll say yes of course.

Now we get to the phun part. How do we get these scamming assholes to 
lose their banner accounts and scammed money? With time and a little 
creativity...

1. Copy the location of their banner link. We'll use the on above.
2. Get a free page on Tripod, Geocities, Angelfire etc.
3. Fill it out to make it look like the guy is purposely trying to 
   scam a whole group of people and then add his link. For example 
   you could put: "The Christian Information Source...CLICK HERE TO 
   CONTINUE" or: "The Shareware Source: CLICK HERE TO ENTER"
   Make the 'CLICK HERE TO ENTER' his banner link and click it.
4. Now go to the company's main site (ie. www.superpay.com) and find 
   an email address. Email them complaining about how you were 
   tricked into clicking his banner and give the address of the site 
   you made. Get a few phriends to email them with the same  
   complaint.

Most banner companies have no tolerance for people who pull scams 
like that and they will yank his account. Now you can laugh at him.

The final tip I have to offer is for those real sights. I've already 
told you about just visiting the core area of the site to avoid them 
getting money, but loading up your web browser all the time can be a 
pain in the ass. For the popular sites like Cyberthrill, save a copy 
of the page as text or photograph the screen. That way you only have 
to load up a small text or pict viewer to see what the page says, not 
a whole browser.

Well, thats a bit of insight on the crappy world of banners. I hope 
this helps everybody who's having problems with these scams. Have 
phun!

 	Our story begins at C.A.T.S HQ, Garage level. 
 Reaper, (the leader of the group) was with Faceless (local hoodlum and
all around tough guy). They were giving the assault sleigh they picked up
from santa claus last cristmas a weapons upgrade, when Poison Ice (Local
Lebanese warrior) Entered the room and ran to Reaper "Reaper, we got a
problem!" Poison began "So what else is new? In all, We have more problems
than Texas has guns! And most of them are with evil people that suck, so
what's so different about this time?" Reaper asked. "Let me guess" Facless
asked "The backdoor boys are alive and sucking eachother as usual?".
"Compared to this, I wish they had." poison answered. "Ok, Spill it dude,
what's up?" Reaper stammered, " you know those toked out trekkies that
call themselves 'Klingons'? Well they have started their own anarchist
group, and they want a cut of our territory" Poison explained. "Ok, this
sucks, this is what we do, and they want a piece of it? Yeah right!
Faceless, Get intelligence to track where they are. Poison and I will
get the weapons together and think of a plan. Let's move people!" Reaper
ordered. An hour later, they met in the war room, Faceless began to tell
them what he had discovered, "Ok, this is what we know, The klingons have
a compound around 10 Clicks out of town, there has been record of explosions
and aircraft in that area. They seem to recruit through trekkie conventions
and Sci-fi stores. Coincidentally, there is also a klingon language already
in use there". "damn these people are on crack!" Reaper stated. "Ok, here's
the plan, We're sending an undercover man there, he blends in, finds out who's
supplying them, then we go in, kick all their asses, then blow the crap out of
the compound. any questions?" "Who's the sucker with the deathwish?" Faceless
asked. "well if you must know, I am" Poison said. "Why you? I could do it
better and there'd be less risk!" Faceless yelled. "Do you know the klingon
language? No. Do you watch Star Trek? No. Do you know how to use one of those
bladed things they fight with? No. I'm the man with the plan, and that's why
i'm in and you ain't" Poison explained. After they worked out the finer points
of the plan, they decided to wait till the next day. During the night, Poison
had a vision, as he faded out of conciousness, the ghost of 403Ninja appeared
to him, "Beware Poison Ice, this mission holds something very harmful to
you" 403 began. "Which would be?" poison asked, " I cannot say, but know
this, this mision will tax your will to it's very limits, this is an enemy few
can defeat, heed my words, for they come from me, and I am the 403..." he
snapped out of his trance, pondered it's meaning, and went to sleep. The next
day, the klingons were spotted near a sci-fi shop in the southern end of the
C.A.T.S territory. Poison went there disguised as a skater, Faceless and some
of his hoodlum friends went and started a fight there, as it progressed,
Faceless ordered the troops to lose, at the right time, Reaper poped up with
a rocket launcher and layed down cover fire for Faceless' group to escape
while yelling "Eat napalm and die trekkies!". Poison did his job from there,
he went up to the klingon's and said "Woah, your those Klingon guys, like
on star trek! Cool!" "You like klingons man?" one asked. "I sure do man,
klingons rule!" Poison withheld both the urge to laugh out loud and to
barf "Well then man, wanna join our KAG? it means Klingon Anarchy Group, you
can hang with all the klingons if you do" the leader asked him. " Um, ok, do
I get some blood wine if I do?" Poison asked. "Only if you prove worthy to
answer the call of Kayless" The leader answered. The klingons left the scene
taking poison with them. They took him to the compound to meet their commander,
a man calling himself "Barl-ron". Poison was required to tell him his klingon
name, "I am Zak-tor, son of Nay-bor, and I come to answer the call of Kayless!"
poison said. All the while, Abaddon, Angel of death, was watching from the
rafters of the building, she was making her recon report for Reaper, she wrote: 

     Abaddon's recon report. Operation:Trekkie takedown
     
     I'm noting Poison Ice pretending to be a klingon in a most accurate and
frightful manner, how does he do that? Anyway, the complex is moderatley
guarded, a standard square compound, four lighthouse towers, and an electrified
fence 4 metres high with #3 barbed wire. Guards are armed with unusual weapons
of unknown origin. will report more later. 

     Meanwhile, as Poison was being showed around the compound he saw someone,
someone he knew, "Aw man, it can't be... not here! Not now!" He thought as he saw
him, it was his cousin Ahmed, and his cousin knew Poison's secret. "Poison Ice?!?
 Ahmed shouted. Immediatley the guards ran at him with their blades out, there
were 7 of them and one of him, so they were outnumbered in his eyes. "Aw Crap!
Ahmed, what the fuck are you doing with these freaks? By joining these star trek
stoners you have disgraced the family!!" Poison shouted. He lept up and kicked
one of the guards, the other ones sacked him. Meanwhile Abaddon, still in the
rafters of the building, sent the signal to the attack force. Reaper, faceless,
and the C.A.T.S crew begun the attack. "Sir, it's those anarchist pa-tak's! Their
attacking us!" one of the klingons yelled, "Battle alert, Battle alert, All troops
report to battle stations!!" The commander announced over the P.A system. Suddenly,
the main door of the building blew apart, when the smoke cleared, Reaper, Faceless,
Spectre, and three other members were standing with swords in one hand and
miscellaneous weapons in the other. " Ok boys, lets frag 'em!" Reaper yelled.
The Mighty warriors rushed the infidel trekkies, Spectre Started firing his rocket
launcher at various sniper's "Bite me Klingon bastards!" he yelled. Poison
struggled free and ran to reaper, "What took you so long? Do you have it?" Poison
asked. "Air traffic man, it bites! And here's your sword!" Reaper answered. Reaper
threw the mighty scimitar to Poison, Poison leapt up, caught it, and ran to the
three trekkie's closest to him. Faceless, carrying his bigass Celtic broadsword,
was currently engaged with troubles of his own, He Cut one klingon in half, two
more came at him, he leapt up, cut one in half, then kicked the other one in the
back. Reaper blasted open a saftey door, which was sheltering 5 klingons, "Hail
the Reaper boys!" he yelled, raising his Battle axe, he Sliced the wussy klingons
to peices as they ran at him. "Ahmed you're so dead!" Poison yelled as he sliced
through the squad of klingons in front of him while running at his cousin. "Not
today my dear cousin, not today!" Ahmed replied as he ran into a room and closed
the blast door. The trekkies were in retreat, when Spectre noticed the writing on
a nearby crate, "Hey Poison, check this out!" he yelled. Poison decapitated the
klingon in front of him and ran to Spectre, "Read the crate" Spectre said, the
crate read, in english: 'made in Israel by the zionist regime'. "It's official,
next time we hit Israel, We hit their factories, this has gone too far..." Poison
complained. 
 But just when they thought all the guys were gone, a Klingon chick came out of
the shadows with a sword, she ran at Spectre, but before she could hit him,
Abbadon dropped in from the rafters, "My turn!" she said with an evil grin.
She high kicked the klingon with her spiked boot, throwing her off balance,
the klingon tripped her with a foot sweep, Abaddon fell hard. She was disorented,
the klingon was about to stab her, but Abbadon threw a shuriken into her throat!
"Chew on that Bitch!" She yelled as the klingon fell back, she got up, dazed, but
all right. "Ok, the wussie cousin's mine, give me my hardware" poison said, Reaper
gave him his thermite gun and an extra clip, "Good hunting buddy" Reaper said as
Poison ran off. Poison Ran hard, Burned through the blast door with the thermite
shells, and kicked it down, three more klingons began firing on him with mini-rocket
launchers, Poison vaulted out of the way. "Damn it! The Israeli's just had to give
them rocket guns..." Poison bitched. poison rose, fired his thermite shells at the
klingons, and brought the roof down on them. "Wussies" Poison mumbled as he ran
down the hall, he then reached a plane hangar, and saw it, The klingons had built
a jet that looks like a klingon space ship.... "They got too much time on their
hands" Poison thought, he saw his cousin order the craft into the air, "AHMED!!
It is the will of Allah that you die for disgracing our family!" Poison yelled,
"Bring it on, but I have a suprise for you..." Ahmed replied. He pressed a button
on his belt, and from all sides, pop music began playing, bad music. Ahmed laughed
at Poison's pain, Poison was in hell, his ears were in agony from the evil around
him, he began to weaken. "You lose cousin, ahhahahahhaha!" Ahmed yelled, "You
forget Ahmed, I am an Arab, I am a muslim, and I am an Anarchist!! ALLAH HUAKBAR!!!"
Poison yelled, His body began to glow, suddenly, waves of psionic energy began
pulsating from his body, the speakers blew out, the music ended, And Poison rose.
"Die you Pink Preppie Bastard!!" Shouted poison as he fired his thermite gun at
his cousin, the traitor. But the klingon ship was in the air, soaring....BOOM!!!!!
The ship exploded! The C.A.T.S assault sleigh roared through the fire cloud,
firing rockets on the compound. They landed to extract Poison, then they flew
off into the night. Later, as poison was resting, 403 visited him again
"Congratulations Poison Ice, you have succeeded in your goal, and you showed
you had a strong will by resisting the evil, rock on dude!" said 403 as he
vanished. "Dang, his visits are getting shorter..." Poison said as he colapsed
on his bed. Reaper came in the next day, we unmasked the klingons, it turns out
that it was "Chumbawumba, N sync, 5ive, and every other wussy pop band from here
to china, at least we killed most of them eh?" Reaper said. " Cool, 2
Israeli's with one bullet..." Poison retorted. "Dude, your going to offend
someone like that..." Reaper began. "Let them take it up with me, Poison Ice,
Arabian anarchist" Poison interupted. "Uh..yeah, Get some sleep, you need it."
Reaper ordered as he left the room. And so the adventure ended, With our
heroes victorious.

|===================================================================|
| Somebody had the nerve to upload this to my warez server! This    |
| looks like the classic Dark Castle game, but actually tries to    |
| replace the System and Finder files. You can tell its a fake when |
| you open it with Stuffit Deluxe. The Dark Castle app will be only |
| 1k and there will be a System and a Finder file in the archive,   |
| that you can't see once decompressed. Watch out for it!           |

| Graphic Accelerator/Graphic Accelerator+              [D][P] 09/98|
|===================================================================|
| This trojan shocked the world last week. It was distributed on the|
| Infomac servers, and causes serious problems. It opens programs,  |
| and modifies a few resources. The first way to tell if you have it|
| is that all menus (and the Apple menu) turn into garbled text,    |
| which grows longer everytime the app is run. Some apps just stop  |
| working after a while. Worst of all, when you delete the extension|
| any infected programs will detect this and replace it! It can't   |
| be found by any scanner, so the infected apps could be anything.  |
| You can stop it by creating a locked file with the same name as   |
| the extension, or you can get an applescript called Graphics      |
| Innoculator that will do the same thing.                          |

|===================================================================|
| This is a pretty nasty bugger! Norton, Apple and several others   |
| have released documents concerning its deadliness. It looks like a|
| text file, but its really an Applescript. When you open it, it'll |
| delete your System and Finder, then trash important extensions,   |
| (like OT) and finally goes around deleting random files! The only |
| way to stop it is to force quit. It is undetectable and deadly.   |

Not much news this month, only one thing in fact. I think either this 
section is dying or the news is just slow...

|           |                Telus No Longer Telus                  |
|     /\    |=======================================================|
|____/__\___|This month Telus merged with BC Tell or something to   |
|   /    \  |form a new company. I'm not sure about most of the     |
|  /      \ |details, but I wouldn't worry about phreaking. Telus   |
|   Local   |has crummy security and so does BC Tell, so maybe now  |
|   H/P/A   |it'll be REALLY crappy security...                     |

 ******************************************************************* 
 *      Top ten reasons why anarchists don't like star trek        * 
 ******************************************************************* 

 10. There are no more phone lines on earth anymore so there is
     nothing to phreak.
  9. All the computers are smarter than you so you can't hack them
     as easily. 
  8. The windows flaw no longer exists so you can't mess around
     with PC users. 
  7. It's a hell of a lot easier for the authorities to bust you
     thanks to those damned transporters. 
  6. If you mess around with another race, you could start an
     interstellar war. 
  5. It's too hard to make a decent bomb in the future. 
  4. You'd have to find your own planet if you want to hold an
     anarcon. 
  3. There is no room for anarchist technology, so you can't have
     some cool weapon while the dude with the blue skin is packing a  
     phaser rifle. 
  2. Most races are stronger than humans so you can't win a
     drunken brawl as easily. 
  1. There is no Catslash magazine in the 24th century, so you
     can't read about cool stuff.
