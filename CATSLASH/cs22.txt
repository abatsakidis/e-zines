Well, its time to snap back to reality from the April issue, and this
one promises to be just as entertaining.

We have a new writer in our ranks, Electrik Fire, Poison's best phriend
has written an article for us. E-fire and Poison are at peace right now
so we can all get along :-)

Also take note that Buachaill B- is now known as Cilz.

Another interesting thing happened this month. Some Chumbawamba fans
tried to e-mail bomb us this month. The bomb was easily handled but
we've written a special reply.

Also, the next revision of the Catslash web page is in the works.
Bethlehem's gone, and its our main distributor now, so we have to
update and re-arrange it. It may be down at times in the next few
months, but don't worry! We haven't dissappeared!

Thats all...

Well if your ever out in the wilderness and you need to make napalm 
and you have no styrofome or liquid soap.  You could also make this 
if you do alot of hunting, just don't go out and kill your cat just 
to make this.

Here are a few things that you will need:

        1. A few liters of blood.
        2. A big cast iron pot(or a pot you don't mind ruining).
        3. A Thick cotton cloth.
        4. 2 Pails or containers for the blood
        4. Access to a stove or burner.
        5. Gasoline

First off you'll have to clean the blood clots out of the blood.  To 
do this pour the blood through the cloth and into a container.  Take 
the cloth and rinse it out and filter the blood again through the dry 
clean cloth.  

Now boil the blood down into a red powder, take the powder and mix it 
with gasoline like you would styrofome.  Then lite it and have phun!

I doubt you would ever make napalm this way, the blood is more of a 
substitution for styrofome then a new recipe.

                             '''''''''''''

So you want to blow up targets from a distance?  You'll need a 
mortar, here's how to make one:

You will need:
1 Thick plastic pipe
1 End cap for the pipe

(1) Screw the end cap on the pipe,

That's it!!!, that's the easy bit, now for the Mortar shells,

You will need (to make one shell):
1 Pack of rocket engines (A type are cheaper but don't have as much
thrust they cost £3.50 for 4, D Types will lift anything but cost £15
for 3, they will put a CO2 bomb fired at a 45 degree angle about
1/2 mile maybe more,  use 7-3 or something like that, but it MUST 
have a delay)
1 Shotgun cartridge
1 Drawing pin
Clear tape
1 CO2 Cartridge, You can buy a box of 10 for £5.00 from brewers shops.
A knife
A glue gun or epoxy resin

(1) Cut the percussion pin off the shotgun cartridge, save the
    gunpowder.

(2) Let all of the gas out of the CO2 cartridge and knock the 
    centre piece out with a nail and widen the hole slightly.

(3) Cut open one of the rocket engines and grind up the solid 
    fuel (carefully) as much as you can, the finer the better.

(4) Mix the gun powder and rocket engine powder and put it in the
    CO2 cartridge.

(5) Now scrape the clay off the top of one of the engines, so 
    that the black powder shows.

(6) Put glue around the card on top of the rocket engine and 
    stick the CO2 cartridge to it.

Now you should have the cartridge stuck to a rocket engine, with the
nozzle of the cartridge touching the black powder, of the rocket
engine.

(7) Scrape the clay top off the other rocket engine and put a 
    single piece of tape around it to hold it to the other engine.

(8) Sit the drawing pin on a piece of tape and stick it to the 
    percussion pin, so that if you hit the drawing pin the percussion 
    pin would go off.

(9) Using the same method of attaching the rocket engines
    together attach the percussion pin to bottom of the rocket 
    engine, it should look like this: 

PP = Percussion pin
E1 = Engine 1
E2 = Engine 2
WH = War head.

         ___
        /   \
       /     \
       |  WH |
       |     |
       |     |
       |     |
       \     /
        \   /
         |_|
        /___\ <-- Glue
        |   |
        |   |
        |E2 |
        |   |
        |---|
        |___| <-- Tape
        |   |
        |---|
        |E2 |
        |   |
        |   |
        |---|
       _|___|_ <-- Tape
      | |PP | | 
      |_|___|_|
        |_|_|<-- Tape holdin pin in place


Drop it down the tube to fire it. 
WHAT HAPPENS : The percussion pin sets off the rocket engine 
and the engine takes it up, when the delay kicks in the mortar tilts
downwards, then the second engine takes it towards the ground, when 
it hits the ground, the delay should kick in, 3 seconds later it 
explodes sending bits everywhere.

What if it misfires: OK lets assume that you filled the warhead 
with plastic explosive or something to heavy for the engine to lift.
The engine will burn, and stay in the tube, at which point you run 
like hell, because if the tube isn't strong enough it will get blown 
apart, and probably take you with it.

How to tell if it misfire: A lot of smoke comes out of the top of the
mortar, smoke will come out if it hasn't misfired, but it will be in 
a line in the air.

What if the tube is thick enough to withstand the blast: some of the 
shrapnel will get blasted out of the end of the tube, others will 
just stay in the tube which you can just tip out.
Remember: More engines mean a longer distance of launching.

 OK I know i promised a big thingy on torture but just as I had it finished i got a 
virus and the computer got trashed. Then my friend's sister got meningitis and I 
had no time to write the article. So instead I have written this: simple but 
useful!
 Ê
 There is a certain telephone service called Interglobe, what it basically involves 
is buying a little card for £5 (english) and you get a PIN number on the back of 
this card that you enter to get £5 worth of free calls. You dont insert the card 
into the fonebox or anything! Therefore it is really easy to rip off.
 here are the numbers from different countries (freefone)
 UK 0800-018-1920
 Netherlands 0602-28994
 Portugal 0505-88-007
 Spain 900-96-4452
 USA 1800-394-3214
 Italy 1-678-76-945
 France 0800-91-8107
 Republic of Ireland (best country in the world) 1800-551-545
 For other country numbers ring
 +44-171-9720800
 I'm not gonna look up any countries for you cos i couldnt be bothered (note above 
number is not freefone)
 Now after you ring this you will be asked to enter your card number and pin. This 
is a 13-digit number. To start you off here are the first 9 numbers of a code, find 
the rest yourself!
 790100055
 You should enter these numbers SLOWLY!!!
 That's it! This is safer than boxing (i think) but is timeconsuming. It is useful 
in countries such as Ireland where boxing is not possible!

                     HACKING MINESWEEPER
        +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

        Everybody knows the old game called Minesweeper. It's a logic/
        startegy game. Almsot all the windows computers have the game allready
        installed when you buy/steal/"borrow"/ a computer. Both windows 95 and
        Windows 3.X have the game.Well, you ask why the !#%$ would I want to
        hack a stupid game for. Well maybe you can impress your
        girlfriend/boyfriend win a bet with your firend that you can finsih
        the game REALLY fast. 
        Here's whaty my little hack does: You know the menu that says best
        times, well that's what we'll be focusing on. What we'll do is alter
        the time to anything you want and the name for all three levels
        (beginer, intermediate, expert). 
        Finally, here's how to do it: For windows 3.x here are the steps =
        1. "Get" a computer
        2. turn it on.
        3. Go into windows (program manager)
        4. Got to the program group called Main, not Maine but Main
        5. Then go to phile manager.
        6. then search for the phile called winmine.ini
        7. open the phile.
        8. scroll down a bit.
        9. then you will see the best times menu ( it'll just be written in
        plain text in the document) you will see the best times on the right
        and the names on the left.
        10. Now change the names and the times to anything you want.
        11. when you're done exit the phile.
        12. it will ask you: do you want to save changes, click yes.
        13. then go to Minesweeper (the game)and into the best times menu.
        14. examine your work
        15. show it off, don't just sit here.

        For windows 95 users it's even easier. 
        1. reapeat steps 1 &2 
        2. Click on the start bar button.
        3. click on the search phor philes/ pholders option.
        4. Type in winmine.ini
        5. open the phile.
        6. the do steps 8-15 again (repeat steps 8-15)



        The end of this phile.

                             '''''''''''''

This is the device that I promised to help you build a while back, to 
pull out those annoying cable tubes. If you don't know what I'm 
talking about read the file 'More Cable Box Fun' (CS19-07.TXT) in 
issue 19.

Why Use it?
===========
If any of you read my article abd decided to try to get yourself a 
tube, it probably was an 8-10 minute job. This can take out a tube in 
about 2 minutes.

Parts Required:
===============
1. An electric screwdriver (battery powered, and preferably magnetic 
   bits)
2. A small robertson bit for the screwdriver
3. A Cable screw end. They look like this bad drawing:
   _____    
  |__|__| <--- Head 
   |   |<----- Tube
   |___|

To get this, open up a cable box and find an unconnected line that's 
sitting on the bottom of the box. Cut off the end and take out the 
cable wire and copper centre so it is hollow.

How to Make it:
===============
Now cut off most of the bottom tube part. Leave about 2 or 3mm of 
tube. Now put the robertson bit through the hole in the centre of the 
head, and use pliers to compress the tube around the bit. Its all 
done!

How to Use it:
==============
Screw the head onto the tube with the bit still attached. Now attach 
the bit to your screwdriver. Set the screwdriver to reverse, and 
press the trigger. Place pressure towards the box so that its pushing 
down on the bit while its unscrewing. The tube is yours!

555 Timer Circuit.*
*******************
By -=The Firestarter=-

The 555 Timer circuit (I call it the 555) is used
as a basic timer, the diagram shown below will give a delay
from 7 seconds to 2 hours, of all the timer circuits this is
one of the cheapest and most reliable. I learned how to make it
when I lived in the south of England, mine worked so there is no
reason why your one shouldn't.

I guess you're all wondering why I would publish something like this. 
Would I hate a band so much? Actually it is a message for a few 
faggets who tried to email bomb us. After the Christmas issue, we 
received a threat letter telling us not to cut down the poser band 
chumbawamba. Of course, like most threats from ten year old lamers we 
ignored it.

Finally, there came the April Fool's issue for 1998. As you remember 
in Poison's story we started out by beating in chumbawamba's girly 
asses. Well, as you guessed, they email bombed us...or tried to.

You see, it is not very hard to protect your email box from a bomb or 
flame and the 7000 some messages they sent us were deleted in 5 
seconds. It was really not very hard to do at all.

So, our messages to those retards that participated in the bombing:

REAPER: YOU ALL SUCK YOU FAGGETS! Did you actually think we wouldn't 
        be able to deal with something like that? If this is the kind 
        of "anarchy" chumbawamba and their fans practice then the 
        spice girls are probably their anarchy gods! You are pitiful.
        And besides, if you don't like us cutting them down, then
        don't read the magazine. We publish what we want. Oh yes, 
        and one of you left your IP in the bomb, so I would be 
        careful.
        

POISON ICE: BURN HOMOSEXUAL INFIDELS!! The fagotasses who tried to do            
            this were obvously tubthumped by chumbawumba a might        
            harshly. If I ever find you imputant dogs you will burn
            to hell and back! But If I EVER..EVER FIND YOU LITTLE     
            BASTARDS, I'M GONNA CASTRATE YOU WORSE THAN YOU'VE 
            ALREADY BEEN! AND IF YOU EVER TRY THAT EMAIL BOMBING 
            SHIT AGAIN, EVERY FAGGOTASSED CHUMBAWUMBA PAGE ON THE 
            FUCKING NET GOES TO HELL IN A HANDBASKET. AND FOR THOSE 
            OF OUR FANS WHO ARE OF ARABIAN DECENT I'LL CONVEY THIS 
            FOR THEM  "CUSS IMAK!" which means fuck your mama!
