[ thtj.com has arrived! ]
        Ok, after the closing of antionline, i decided that it was time to
move up and get out own domain name. I am still formulating the site, and we
are still waiting for the Majordomo for subscribers to use to get thtj setup,
but by next month, subscribe@thtj.com should be up. Now i just need to set up
a CGI and a form for the webpage.

[ A Note for HBS members ]
        Ok, since the majordomo is not up, and we are never all on IRC, and
im busy as shit working, you all need to e-mail me at scud@thtj.com and tell
me what you want for an e-mail at thtj.com . also tell me if you need web
space on thtj.com.

[Editorial : by Scud-O] The Old School

        During the past month, on #sin, Revelation had a long talk with me
about the old school. Rev is a great person, and with his connections, power,
and skills, i believe that he can help bring back the 'old school'. Right
below this editorial, is Revelation's mission, and i want you all to read it.
His look into the 'underground' is so true. Last month I almost brought to you
all 'state of the underground' editorial, but after the offer from some people,
i felt that it was time to first denounce selling out. i was going to publish
my little state of the underground speech this month, but after Rev gave me
his article on bringing back the underground, well i killed my state of the
underground speech since his covers everything i wanted to talk about, and
more.
        Revelation does provide so many revelations into the underground that
so many people can not, or do not see. Many of the so called hackers,
phreakers, anarchists, warez d00ds that are just so k-R4d 3reet should be
ashamed of themselves. hacking and phreaking are not about messing with
innocent people's lives, it is about helping the system, about telling
sysadmin's about thier's problems, it is about shutting down a child porno
site like Rev talks about. It is until we do things like this that we can
regain respect for ourselves. Until then we will continue to go further and
further down the hole until we can no longer see the light, the light towards
honor, and respect and trust, those things which do not exist in today's
underground. Until we become ethical, we will continue to be arrested in
record numbers. And as for anarchists, well i will not even begin to talk
about them, since i could spend hours rambling about anarchists.
        Hacking and phreaking were started to expand one's mind, and with
the standard of today's hackers and phreakers, we are not expanding our minds,
we are simply following cookbooks with step by step instruction on how to
achieve our ends. Minds ARE being closed, and that is something that can not
happen, for once we close our minds we are done for. closing our minds allows
for people to control us, like Ingsoc and Big Brother ( read 1984 by George
Orwell if you dont know what I am talking about ) , and this can not happen,
for if it does, we are all doomed.
        In closing, i hope i have not depressed to too much, and I would like
to thank Revelation and all of AS for thier goal of bringing back the old
school, and i wish them well, they are a fine bunch of people, and they will
succeed in thier goal. And if they ever need any help from me, or thtj/hbs,
just let us know, we will be glad to help.

Ah, yes...the Old School.  Those of us who have been around for a little
while remember it well.  The time where knowledge gatherer's were respected
because of their hard work and skills.  We weren't dishonered by virii
spreaders and e-mail bombers...we were free...freedom.  Has a nice ring to
it doesn't it?  Well, these days freedom is becoming less important, and
crashing the government is taking priority.  Why?  I'll tell you why...
because of hype, plain and simple.  People are no longer interested in
expanding their minds...they're interested in closing it.  What ever happend
to the belief in Utopia...the freedom that unites us all?  We're losing it...
that's what happend.  We're losing it...the only damn thing that made me get
involved in the Underground is slipping away.  Of course, there will always
be, no matter what, ways to expand your mind.  But why are we letting the one
thing that we all care about get away?  This I cannot I answer...but I can
provide a solution...a means to bring back the old school ethics of non
destruction, Utopia, and freedom.  We still have the power to return the
Underground to what it was originally meant to be...free, ethical, and
informative.

Bringing back the old school ways will be by no means easy.  It will take
long, hard work from each of us...but it will be worth it.  Let's return the
Underground to its' original form, let's bring back the old school.  In this
article I am take one step toward this freedom of the old school ways.  This
step will be AS (Axis Security).  A group of people who want to return the
respect and honesty back to the hacker name.  A group of people who aren't
interested in spreading virri, e-mail bombing, carding, and software piracy.
We simply want to expand our own minds, and the minds of others'...while
bringing about a return to the old school ways of the Underground.
Our organization is made up of 8 members, no more, no less.

These members are:

Revelation    -  revelation@mail.hackers.com
Ed Wilkinson  -  ed.wilkinson@mail.hackers.com
Hyper Viper   -  hv@mail.hackers.com
Phreaked Out  -  phreakedout@mail.hackers.com
Phreak Show   -  phreakshow@mail.hackers.com
Brimstone     -  brimstone@mail.hackers.com
Fallout       -  fallout@mail.hackers.com
Samurai7      -  samurai7@mail.hackers.com

This hand-picked group of hackers will begin the long awaited first step
towards the New School...a return of the Old School.  We propose and
challenge you to follow in our footsteps with ethical hacking.  Be the kind
of hacker that makes people respect you, not be afraid of you.  No more
destructive virri spreading, e-mail bombing, and software piracy.  Begin this
first step with us and follow us.  The New School era has begun...help us
push it forward.  Help us promote ethical hacking, by promoting it yourself.
It is only by your will that we will enter this New School era...no one
person can do it, we all must do it.

Ask yourself what you want to accomplish by being a hacker?  Do you want to
make the "ultimate hack"?  Do you want to hack a government web page?  Well,
try this instead...hack a child pornography page if your going to hack a
web page...notify System Administrator's of their security flaws...write
programs and text files that describe how to protect from attacks, not how to
accomplish the attack.  That is how we are going to expand our minds.  By
fixing current problems and security flaws we bring about new standards, and
with these new standards comes new problems.  It's a neverending circle that
will make us all wiser and more helpful to society, instead of being
destructive to it.  All we ask is for your support...help us bring back the
Old School...welcome to the new era...the era of ethics and greatness among
hackers...welcome to the New School...

In closing I would like to thank The Havoc Technical Journal for publishing
this article...we are now one step closer to our goal because of them.  I
would also like to thank Scud-O for his support of my views and of those of
the Old School.  I would also like to thank the man who made all of this
possible, the man who is the very definition of "true hacker"...Ed Wilkinson.
Without Ed and his aid in the creation of AS, this wave of ethics may never
have taken place.  I would also like to thank Hyper Viper for being of
termendous help and support.  Shoutouts to everyone at AS, L0pht, S.I.N.,
GkOS, THTJ, OTRiCS, Silicon Toad (for all your help and support),
Phreaked Out, VC, Teknopia, Haknet, Stealth, #psychotic, LOA, LOD, Phrack
(for being a terrific magazine), 2600 (for believing in freedom and having
the guts to publish it), and everyone I forgot.

If your leaving this article still believing in the destructiveness that
nearly consumed the Underground...believe what you will...but the Old School
is back, and badder than ever.

                --------------------------------------------
                Information and Pascal (yuck) Code by Scud-O
                --------------------------------------------

I. Introduction

        This article is made to present you, the reader with the beginnings
of cryptology. This is not made to fully describe every aspect of crypto. I
am mainly dealing with very, very basic crypto such as substitution or
transposition. For details on encryption methods such as idea, des, blowfish,
etc. look for it in other future articles.
        I plan for at least 2-3 articles on basic crypto, this month covering
beginning crypto such as substitution or transposition, next month to cover
bit manipulation ( NOT, AND, OR, XOR, etc) and after that, maybe get into
blowfish, idea, and other algorithms.

II. Types of Ciphers

        First off, there are about a million different forms of ciphers and
encryption methods that can be made, but for this month, the 2 methods i will
discuss are substitution and tranpositition. substitution ciphers replace one
character with another character, but leaves the message in the same order.
However, transposition ciphers scramble the characters of a message according
to some rule. These types of ciphers can be used at whatever level you feel
like, and can also be intermixed. Another technique, which will be covered
next month is bit manipulation, which has become popular with the use of
computers.
        All three of these methods use a key. The key, of course is used to
'unlock' the message that is encrypted.

III. Words to remember

        ciphertext : the encrypted text, for example: MJQQT, YMNX NX F YJXY.

        plaintext : the decrypted text, ie: HELLO, THIS IS A TEST.

end.


input: hello, this is a test. i hope it works.
output: MJQQT, YMNX NX F YJXY. N MTUJ NY BTWPX. 
output2: HELLO, THIS IS A TEST. I HOPE IT WORKS.   


        Now while this may fool the casual reader, it would not fool anyone
with some knowledge of crypto, and this code would be broken in a few minutes.
One problem with this cipher is that it leaves the spaces in place. To make
this more 'secure' we should include the space. ( We should also include all
punctuation and numbers, as well as uppercase letters, but i am going to leave
that to you do to if you want to. )

        For example, take the alphabet:

                abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz<space>

        and change it to:

                qazwsxedcrfvtgbyhnujm ikolp


        Now while this may not seem to make this cipher more secure, it does
since now there are 27 factoral ( 27! ) instead of only 26! ways for this
cipher to use. In case you did not know, 6! would be 6*5*4*3*2*1 which equals
720, therefore, 26! is a larger number, and 27! is an even greater number.

        example:
                meet me at sunset

      would become
                tssjptspqjpumgusj

      now, would you like to have to break that code? i dont think so.

                        write(outfile, ch);
                end;
                Writeln('File decoded');
                close(infile);
                close(outfile);
end; { decode }
                
begin {main }
        alphabet := 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ ';
        sub      := 'QAZWSXEDCRFVTGBYHNUJM IKOLP'; 
        write('enter input file: ');
        readln(inf);
        write('enter output file: ');
        readln(outf);
        write('code or decode (C or D) ');
        readln(ch);
        if upcase(ch)='C' then code(inf,outf,start)
        else if upcase(ch)='D' then decode(inf,outf,start);
end.

        Now, while this is a harder code to break, this is still easily
breakable by a frequency table of the english language. Looking for the most
common letter in the ciphertext will show you which letter is 'e' , since e
is the most common letter in the alphabet.
        To make this just a little bit more confusion, lets throw in another
round of subsititution. If you are really bored you can take this to the next
step, and keep adding more and more levels of subsitution, but if you do end
up doing that, there is seriously something wrong with you!

-------------------subs3.pas
program subs3;

                        if isalpha(ch) then
                            begin
                                if change then
                                 ch := alphabet[find(sub, ch)];
                                 { replace with real alphabet again }
                                else
                                 ch := alphabet[find(sub2, ch)];
                                 { second sub }

        alphabet := 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ ';
        sub      := 'QAZWSXEDCRFVTGBYHNUJM IKOLP';
        sub2     := 'POI UYTREWQASDFGHJKLMNBVCXZ';
        write('enter input file: ');
        readln(inf);
        write('enter output file: ');
        readln(outf);
        write('code or decode (C or D) ');
        readln(ch);
        if upcase(ch)='C' then code(inf,outf,start)
        else if upcase(ch)='D' then decode(inf,outf,start);
end.

        Ok, so before i go, this multi-encryption makes it much harder since
        at each space, the sub is changed, making frequency tables somewhat
        useless. I hope you enjoyed this article, and tune in next month for
        transpostion ciphers and bit-manipulation. cya.

-[ Meridian Mail : by grinchz ]-----------------------------------------------

- Forew0rd -

	After a few weeks of searching for any info on phreaking the Meridian
        Mail system I realized there was basiclly none to be found. So
        natuarlly I went to work on my skoolz system and discovered what tha
        menus where and some other lil' neeto tid bits of info on what tha
        system it self is. ( i stole a little bit of the menuing system info
        and info on hacking it from some lil' thing i happened to find on da
        web )

- About The Merdian Mail System -

	Meridian Mail is not just a stand alone system. Its actually and add
        on for Meridian  switches made by Northern Telecom and also from
        British Telecom (UK Only). Tha system is very expensive averaging
        2000 UK Pounds for a low end model.


- Spoting a Meridian Mail System -

	Well spoting an MM is kinda hard but not to hard. The easiest to spot
        is the mail collection setup. This is when you dial the system and a
        digitized womens voice sez, " Welcome To Meridian Mail". And then
        followed by "Mail Box #?" and  of course "Password?". The second setup
        is sounds just like an answering machine. When called it picks up and
        plays a msg for u. To get out  of the recording simply hit "*" then
        press "#" and u will get a list of all options. To get to the login
        prompts press  "81". Next is call routing which basiclly gives you a
        menu like "Press 1 For Butt sex" , "Press 2 For Sex w/ Muppets" , etc.
        Some these are pains in tha ass and u have to wait for the msg to end
        before u can get into tha fun but others will let u hit "*" and then
        press "#" to get the options and "81" to get to tha Login prompt. The
        last type of system is outgoing msg only. They Really Suck Stay Away
        From Them! U cannot use anything on them.... (probably cuz someone else
        already got to it :P).


- The Guess 'n' Check -

	So u found an MM somewhere and u wanna get into it? Well here are a few
        things I learned while fucking around with my skoolz setup:

+there is no set mail box #
 but is usually 4 digits

+default passwd is the msg #
 also try mail box # backwards

+passwd's are 4-16 digits in length

+if u get in its kewl :P

Breaking Into the BCTel Van - By eclipse.

	Ok, I'm sure you all heard about the first time cind3r and I broke
        into a Bctel Van, but I don't know if you heard about the time I did
        just a week ago. It's pretty lame, but its 1:30 am, and I can't get to
        sleep. Well, here's the story.

        So, It was about, 11 at night, and my friends had just gone home, and
my other 2 friends were at a party. So, I went to the fence, which had
some shitty aluminum linking from the last time it got victimized. In
about 5 minutes, it was completely gone, and there was a hole in the
fence from top to bottom. It was about 11:30 now, and I knew my friends
would be out of the party at about 12. I decided to wait outside for
them to pass my house, and they did. They wanted to help me with the van,
but they had to go home, so me, trying to be all 31337 in front my my
friends, got some porcelin and tried to break the window. That didn't
work, so before they left, I got my crowbar. One hit, and *Bang*, a
second, and *smash*. The window was broke, and I bolted across the street,
and back to my house. I laid low for an hour or so, and then went back. It
was all dark and quiet, so I figured it was safe. I looked in... one
lineman's, one cb radio, and a box with assorted little goodies. I took the
linemans and dumped it off at my house. Then, I went back and grabbed the
box. It had 10 dollars in quarters in it, some BCTel stickers, and some phone
boxes and shit. I sat under the lights of the store across the street from my
house and looked over my findings, putting them in a bag. Then, knowing it was
quality, and not quantity that I wanted, I went back for one more thing: the
cb radio. I ripped it out of the van and was on my way out of the van when
another linemans caught my eye. It was in the back of the van, so I had to
reach across the van, with all that broken glass, and open the sliding door.
I went back, and got the linemans, along with a nice, new telephone. I went
home and went to sleep.


Get away - By Eclipse.

	Tonight, while trying to start up a conf, I got a little more exercise
than I had expected and wanted. I had already been there before: the store
with 10 phone lines, 4 rural (8 city) blocks away from my house. I had
unsuccessfully tried to start a conf, and not wanting to end the night without
one, I decided I would go back. So, I got back, just as the sun had gone down
over the mountains. It was fairly dark out, and I was safe with my linemans.
I had JUST hooked it up, and called cind3r, expecting to start my 3,4,5,6,
and eventually 10 way call. About 5 seconds (literally) into the call, a car
pulls up, high beams on and everything. A male driver and a female passenger.
"What are ya doin?" he asks. "Nothing" i say to him as i swear at cind3r and
hang up on him. Paniked, I yanked my phone cord, and stuck it in my bag. "Oh,
 I know what you're doing, you little shit!" he yells, as i take off on my
rollerblades, probably faster than I have ever gone in my life. I look back,
and see him chasing after me on foot, but he was still a good 20 feet back,
so I kept on going full tilt. I saw him run back to his car, and I knew I had
some time to hide, but, bah, I was on a stretch with all houses. No bush. I
saw him creep up behind me, following back in his car, about 5 feet behind me.
He picked up a cell, he called the police, I would imagine. I turned down a
street to get onto the slower street that wasn't on the highway. He was
following me, close enough he could have probably reached out of his window
and grabbed me. I was going fairly slow now, very out of breath from booting
it 4 blocks already. I was one block away from my house, but I was at the
other end of the street. I saw a car trying to turn onto the road, and I went
in front of it, which turned down the road, giving me just a few seconds, but
at the same time, a long time to get ahead of the guy. So I blade up the road,
and turn off down the dirt and rock path. It was about 20 feet long, running
the whole way on rollerblades. I almost fell a couple times. I looked back
behind me, and saw the guy chasing after me. I laughed at him, and kept going.
I was only 1 house away from my house. I got around the corner, and I saw him
turn around and head back to his car. I was safe. I ran into my house and down
the stairs, hot, sweaty and out of breath, while trying to explain why "i had
 to come home from James's house." Thats my story, the closest I have ever
gotten to getting caught for phreaking. Thank god I didnt. I had more then
enough shit with me for a possible stay in Juvy :). Including the linemans I
had stole a week earlier from BCTel.

Nokia Cellular Programming Info - Brought to you by Keystroke

FOR AUTHORIZED DEALER USE ONLY

NOKIA 2160 SERIES CELLULAR TELEPHONE NAM PROGRAMMING INSTRUCTIONS

The Nokia 2160 Series handportable CMT uses an EEPROM NAM that can be programmed directally from the standard keypad.  In order to
access the NAM, you must enter the special access code currently programmed into the phone.  Once the programming mode is accessed, NAM
parameters are loaded by entering them into the display and "storing" them to selected memory locations.  Be sure to obtain all parameters before
proceeding.

EASY NAM PROGRAMMING
1.	Turn the phone on.
2.	Enter the NAM access code. Access code is: *#639#
3.	Verify the display now reads "Cellular number" and enter the 10 digit MIN for the phone.
4.	Press the softkey under the word "OK" in the display.  If less then 10 digits are entered an error message will prompt you to reenter
	the number
5.	Verfit the display reads "Enter code" and enter the five digit SID followed by four zeros. (Example 001750000 is a SID of 175 followed
	by four zeros.)  An error message will display if an incorrect entry is made.  Do not add more than four zeros to the code.
NOTE:	   Change the Lock code by adding a pound sign and new lock code after the code.  (example: 001750000#7788.  Lock code=7788)
	   Change the Language by adding a pound sign and new language code after the code (example: 001750000#2. Language = 2)
		   Language code: 0 (default) = English, 1 = French, 2 = Spanish, 3 = Portuguse
	   Change the Lock code and Language code by seperating each set of numbers by a pound sign. (example: 001750000#7788#2) The
	   SID =00175, Lock code = 7788, Language = 2 (Spanish)
6.	Press the softkey under the word "OK" in the display.
7.	The display will tell you that the activation was OK and instruct you to power off, then on again.  When the phone powers back
	up, it will automatically select the correct system (A or B)

ACCESS NAM PROGRAMMING MODE:
1.	Turn the phone on.
2.	Enter the NAM access code.  Factory default is:  * 3 0 0 1 # 1 2 3 4 5
3.	Enter the softkey [Menu]
4.	If this screen appears,  -----------------   you have entered the access code correctly.
			         |   Field Test |
			         |  > NAM 1   |
	 		         |     NAM 2   |
			         -----------------
SELECTION FROM THE MAIN LEVEL MENU (FIRST LEVEL OF NAM MENU):
5.	Press the scroll key up or down repeatedly until the desired main menu selection is displayed.  Select from:

	NAM 1		NAM 2		NAM 3		Security Code		Emergency Number		SW version
	Serial No.	Programmed	Field Test

6.	Press softkey [Select] to access the level menu for the your main selection.                {Note from Key: They made that typo :P!}

PROGRAMMING NAM'S 1 THROUGH 3 (SECOND LEVEL NAM MENU):
7.	Press the key up or down to scroll through the selected NAM information list.  Select from:

		HOME SYSTEM		OWN NUMBER		PSID/RSID LISTS (Note 1)		CHANGE DEFAULTS
						CHANGE DEFAULTS"
NAM STATUS			ACCESS METHOD		LOCAL OPTION			PRIMARY PAGING CH
SECONDARY PAGING CH	DEDICATED CCH A		DEDICATED CCH A NBR		DEDICATED CCH B
DEDICATED CCH B NBR		OVERLOAD CLASS		GROUP ID			REAMING STATUS
A-KEY

8.	If the value is incorrect, press the softkey [Select] and use the numeric keypad or key to make any needed changed.
9.	Enter softkey [OK] to save the value.
10.	Repeat steps 7 through 9 for the remaining NAM info items to be viewed and/or changed.
11.	To program NAMs, press [Quit] to return to the Main Menu list.  Select NAM 2 or NAM 3.  Once the Home System ID and Own
	number are programmed, the phone will automatically set the NAM Status to enabled.

PROGRAMMING THE SECURITY CODE:
12.	From Main Level Menu use the key to select the "Security" menu, press [Secect] and the current 5-digit security code will appear in the
	display.  Default is 12345
13.	If you wish to change the Security code at this time, use the numeric keys to change the value.
14.	Press the softkey [OK] to store changes.

PROGRAMMING EMERGENCY NUMBERS:
15.	From Main Level Menu use the scroll key to select the "Emergency" menu, press the softkey [Select] to enter the emergency numbers.
	EMERGENCY NUMBER 1 (911)	EMERGENCY NUMBER 2 (*911)	EMERGENCY NUMBER 3 (None)
16.	If you wish to change the displayed value, use the numeric keys to make
	changes.  Use the scroll key to select the emergency number you wish to
	change and press [Select].
17.	To change the value, press softkey [OK].
18.	Press [QUIT] to exit the menu.

<OTHER SIDE OF PAGE>

2160 Programming Continued:
SW VERSION:
19.      From the Main Level Menu use the scroll key to display the "SW version" menu, press [Select] to view software version, date, and product
           type.
20.      Press [Quit] to exit the menu.

SERIAL NUMBER (ESN):
21.      From the Main Level Menu, use the key to display the "Programmed" menu.
24.      Press [Select] and enter a four digit number that corrispondes to the month and year the phone is sold.  Example (mmyy)
           0197 = January 1997, 0996 = September 1996.
NOTE: This menu location can be programmed only one time.  Once that date had been entered it cannot be changed,  Any attempt to enter the
              menu once it had been programmed will receive a short beep and the message "DATE ALREADY STORED".

EXIT NAM PROGRAMMING:
25.      To exit the NAM programming mode, turn off the phone and leave it off for five seconds.

FIELD TEST:
26.      The FIELD TEST MODE is used to investigate how the phone is reacting to the cellular system.  The FIELD TEST
            information covers signal strength, battery changing status, cellular state and encryption status.  The information is organized
            to display information relating to Analog Control Channels, Digital Control Channels, Analog Voice Channels, and Digital

30.       To disable the FIELD TEST mode.  Return to NAM programming and disable the function under the FIELD TEST menu.


PROGRAMMING PSIDS AND RSIDS:
The Nokia 2160 provides the option to program Private (PSIDs) and Residential (RSIDs) System ID's as perscribed by IS-136.
The PSID/RSID list is programmed to support selection/reselection processes, system selection and SID display functions.  Programming the
PSID/RSID list is part of the NAM programming menu.  All three NAMs have their own PSID/RSID list.  Follow these instructions to program
the PSID/RSID lists.

1.         Enter the NAM programming menu and select NAM 1 (or the desired NAM). (Note: PSID/RSID is currently only avilable in the NAM 1
            location.  PSID/RSID is included in NAM 2 and 3 for future use.)
2.         Use the scroll key to display "PSID/RSID LISTS" and press [SELECT].
3.         Use the scroll key to select the P/RSID 1 or the desired P/RSID (1 through 5).  Press the [SELECT] softkey.
4.         Each list contains:
            System type		Select Private or Residential system type.
            PSID/RSID			System ID for the Private or Residential system.  Indicates which PSID/RSID the mobile will respond to.
            System ID			Connected System ID.  The SID the PSID/RSID is connected to.
            Alpha Tag			The name of the Private or Residential SID.
            Operator Code (SOC)	This is the System Operator Code.  (US-McCaw Cellular = 001 (dec),  Canada - Rogers Cantel Inc. = 002 (dec),
				and McCaw Cellular Communications (for international) = 2049 (dec).
            Country Code		Enter the country code of the PSID/RSID.

*Little Crypting System* memor [HBS]
************************ ***********

1 / Why that little cryptography system
***************************************

Well a few years ago, i was studying cryptography systems (Hill, Rabbin,
Rsa ,Des, Vigenere..) and i thought it was funny to make my own "little"
and easy crypting system in that country nammed France where the encoding
systems are forbidden when the key and method you use for it arent given
to the french governement.. i called it Random Routines, because its a 
stupide system using a random string as key to crypt.

2 / How it werks?
*****************

It only uses that key composed for instances of 26 caracters:
AZERTYUIOPQSDFGHJKLMWX CVBN

caracters with a cursor position:

AZERTYUIOPQSDFGHJKLMWX VBN
1   5    1    1    2     2
         0    5    0     6

for making that caracters string that is as long as you want it can
go from 26bytes to .. hm (the longest i did was 32kbytes).

a little programm using C++ random functions or basics rnd can do it
i guess that one can work (i didnt tryed it)

        #include <stdio.h> /* for presentation shit */
        #include <time.h> /* for a Borland C++ random command use */

        void makekey()
        {
        printf("Making da key\n");  
        unsigned char key[32000];
                for(int i=0;i<32000;i++)
                        key[i]=random(255);
        printf("Key made\n");  
        }
                
the second thing to have is of course the original text to crypt:

the string to crypt here will be for instance "HELLO"

using a rotating method on the key i'll first crypt the H:

AZERTYUIOPQSDFGHJKLMWX VBN
1   5    1    1    2     2
         0    5    0     6
               
               1
               6

H is the pos 16.. the first crypted thing will be the number 16
after from that H, i'll crypt the e (pos will move and the pos1 will start
on the H)

AZERTYUIOPQSDFGHJKLMWX VBN /* note that its a rotating position at the
1  1    2     21   5    11    string end, it continues on the string
2  5    0     6         01    begining */

from the H, i'll go to the E .. i'll get pos 14.. 
the begin of the "brute" crypted thing is 16,14..
i'll continue to crypt now from the E to the L

AZERTYUIOPQSDFGHJKLMWX VBN
221   5    1    1    2   2
56         0    5    0   4

from the E, i'll go to the L .. i'll get pos 17.. 
the begin of the "brute" crypted thing is 16,14,17..
i'll continue to crypt now from the L to the L

AZERTYUIOPQSDFGHJKLMWX VBN
9  1  1    2    221   5  8
   2  5    0    56


from the L, i'll go to the L .. i'll get pos 1.. 
the begin of the "brute" crypted thing is 16,14,17,1..
i'll continue to crypt now from the L to the O

AZERTYUIOPQSDFGHJKLMWX VBN
9  1  1    2    221   5  8
   2  5    0    56


from the L, i'll go to the L .. i'll get pos 17.. 
the begin of the "brute" crypted thing is 16,14,17,1,17..
i'll continue to crypt now from the L to the O

well finally, the crypted "numerous" string will be
16,14,17,1,17

well next step is to use only a little "decalage" crypting system from
"hidding" like +1,+1,+1,+2 on all the numbers we get 

16,14,17,1,17
+  +  +  + +
1  1  2  2 1
-------------
17,15,19,3,18

the next step will be to crypt thoses numbers in letters will a 2nd
key like.. hmm..

ABCDE FGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXXZ0123456789
1   5    1    1    2    2    3    3 3
         0    5    0    5    0    5 7

16 will be O
15 will be N
19 will be R
3 will be C
18 will be Q

so the finally crypted string will be "ONRCQ"

now tell me how to found without knowing that crypting method that
"HELLO" == "ONRCQ" ?
and the keys are of course easy to find when they are of 26 30 bytes, but
imagine that the key are 32000bytes.. i guess its a bit harder to find
the right key and the good crypting method..

for 32000 bytes.. hmm .. lucks are 1/(255^32000) == really little!

crypting ratio is 1:1.. for 1 uncrypted byte, you get 1 crypted byte. 
but of course you need 2 keys.

3 / Making that system a bit more complex :
*******************************************

well i will include in it the Source coming and the destination , thoses
are in 2 caracters that the spies will choice..

Kevin who is sending the crypted message "HELLO" to Oscar choose the "name"
KN .. he knows Oscar name which is "FK".

for that, i'll separate the crypted text with RN caracters.
it will be RNxRNxRNxRNxRNxRNxRN <- x are the crypted bytes.
so the crypted "HELLO" will be now RNORNNRNRRNCRNQRN

we will put the first letter of Kevin "name" before the first RN , it 
will gives:

KRNORNNRNRRNCRNQRN

we will now put the second letter of Oscar "name" just after that one,
it will gives :

KKRNORNNRNRRNCRNQRN

we will put the first letter of Oscar "name" just after the last RN , we 
will get 

KKRNORNNRNRRNCRNQRNF

and we will put finnaly the 2nd letter of Kevin name just at the end of 
the string, we will finnaly have :

"KKRNORNNRNRRNCRNQRNFN" is the final crypted string.

that RN and name thing will be like a checksum, because if you
receive a msg without crypted letters under RN and with a bad source and
destination name, i guess that the crypted text is not for you and that
your keys wont work for decrypting it.

another little checksum will be the 1st key string lenght at the end of 
the crypted text. Our 1st key is 26 bytes long.   

2nd key :

ABCDE FGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXXZ0123456789
1   5    1    1    2    2    3    3 3
         0    5    0    5    0    5 7

2 is the B and 6 is the space.. so now the crypted string will be:

"KKRNORNNRNRRNCRNQRNFNRNB " 

4 / so now, for a spy how to guess that "KKRNORNNRNRRNCRNQRNFNRNB " 
*******************************************************************
== "HELLO" ?
************

well i'll use that thing nammed "Crypt-Analysis"

"KKRNORNNRNRRNCRNQRNFNRNB " 
 --**x**x**x**x**x**--**--

 i'll see that "RN" are repeated.. especially in the middle string,
 so i'll know that the letter upper to the x will be crypted letters.

 i'll think probably that the letters uppers to the -- will be some
 checksum thing or key making shit..

 so i wont be really advanced, i'll only know that:

 "KKFNB " <- its checksum or keymaking shit.. maybe KK are checksum and
 "FNB " are key making shit, or "KK" key making and "FNB " checksum , or 
 no checksum and only key making, or checksum without key making... i'll
 be damn LOST!

 i'll know that ONRCQ will be some crypted text with a key, maybe 2 keys,
 maybe 3 keys??! here too, i'll be totally lost.

 the only thing i'll really know is that RN are only here for separating
 the crypted thing parts... but how all that thing works? LOST LOST LOST!

 well i made that cryptography system for fun, if u have any question,
 i coded it a few years ago on AtariSt systems with 256 bytes key , 
 it was nammed rndrt.lzh if u have C coding questions too.. 
 mail me in memor@mygale.org

§§§-Slacking and not getting caught-§§§ 
 
	I'm going to murder all of you. Now that I got that out of the way on
with the article. Are you like me, do you go to a high school (or any school)
that has computer lab using Novell netware and some windows companion like
"USERNET"?. If you do then good, but if you don't here is what USERNET, or
other similar Novell windows companion's are about. The idea behind "USERNET"
is that once the user is logged in he/she can not execute any other program
besides those that are available (ones that have icons). But if your like me
and are tired of hearing the instructor telling you run Microsoft windows tour
or make a Pascal program that adds integer's then I have got a great way of
slacking and not being caught. First off, all the things I'm going to tell
you are good for doing what you want on a "USERNET" system, but is no
substitute for just hacking the admin, or booting up without "USERNET" into
DOS prompt, but both of these ways run the risk of you being caught slacking.
So here we go. You have logged into "USERNET" and are doing whatever pathetic
thing the instructor told you to do, now most school's have courses in HTML
or just have web access, so Netscape navigator is available to run. RUN IT.
Now once your in, go to options/general preferences and then to the APPS
section. Once there look for a dialog box called "Telnet Application".
Obviously this box is used to point to the external Telnet program the
Netscape calls on when it is requested by the user. Now put any executional
that you want into the box and it can be run simply by exiting options(OK)
and typing "telnet://" then Enter in the URL box of Netscape. This tells
Netscape to run the Telnet program, or in this case any program you have put
into that dialog box. Now I know your saying "THAT IS THE DUMBEST THING I
HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY INTIRE LIFE YOU FUCKHEAD", but it works and more you can
easly switch between whatever program you ran, back to whatever your suppose
to be doing (ALT+TAB) in a second and avoid being caught. My suggestions of
program's to run are "C:\WINDOWS\DOSPROMT.PIF" or FileManager. If you
thought this article was a waste of time and taught you nothing new then you
should not have read it!
 
So have fun, slack and take it easy.

A Story, by discore
-------------------------

listen kiddies!
i have a story of mass porportions
a garbling gaggle of great somethings
hi! discore speaking, i got a great story to tell cause its time to piss
some ppl off, and thats what i do best.
it all started in a land far far away (salt lake city) about 2 months ago
when my friend who we will call jeff started getting a slight drug
problem. he ended up getting busted every week or so when he stole bottles
of alchohol from his parents or something like that. then he was downtown
at a crackhouse on like... the 15th of june, and he had a gun on him, and
of course the crackhouse got raided, him being caught with the gun and in
a shitnitz of trouble. so right after he was fingerprinted, all his infoz
pulled etc he went immdiatly to my house to find me tiffany and shaun
taking down this tent we were playing with. and he totally 100% freaks out
at my house all starts crying and shaking. then his mom came and picked
him up. the stupid slut that she is let him go and do what he wants the
next day, so he is fucking durnk out of his mind and has a go kart
(something you dont want jeff to have). so anyways, later in the day his
mom offers me to stay up at his house that night, something that doesnt
happen very often, of course i take the offer and me and jeff do something
that night. in the morning im awakend by his clueless dad and 4 ppl from a
detox program. they take jeff away that morning, on his best friends
birthday (june 20th).
so now the story is his m0m thinks i have a gun here, so tells my mom that
and of course she shits a brick, i tell her to fuck off and to get out of
my room. now heres the fun part
the detox program that jeff is in tapped my phone line for unknown
reasons. i cant name anything cause i plan on sue'ing the living shit out
of this detox facility.
the point of my story is to realize this isnt a free world anymore. you
are owned by your law enforcement and your government. the have the power
to kill you for no reason or lock you up in jail for the rest of your
life. and i dont fucking like it, so you know what i say? i say fuck the
system be yourself and listen to the doors instead of going to church!
                  
                   AND A BIG FUCK YOU TO JEFF'S MOM

discore!
btw... although nothing illegal is here dont rage anarchy because of this
article, its not my fucking fault if you get shot im simb0lia or something
because of this!

***Phreaking for some europeans   *** memor [HBS]
*****************************************

French and european people, all thoses barbars want to phone without paying their call,
but they HAVE NO skills in electronics , so they always, mostly ask lame questions.. so their
is some methods that doesnt needs thoses "electronician" skills.

Well the first method if u dont want to pay yer bills is blueboxing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Remember thoses two mf frequencies 1st:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
they are composed of two basics frequencies (its do the mf) ,a lenght of that frequencie playing and
a little delay before playing the next frequencie.

	Frequencie n°1:
	--------------------------
	frequencie a:usually 2600 Hertz
	frequencie b:usually 2400 Hertz
	lenght : 150ms (random lenght)
	delay : 10ms

	Frequencie n°2:
	--------------------------
	frequencie a:usually 2400 Hertz
	frequencie b:usually 2400 Hertz
	lenght : 300ms (random lenght)
	delay : 10ms

Some goodies for frenchz now:
--------------------------------------------------

anyways, their is for the french phreakers that old coloumbia local bluebox.. (only call drugs sellers in bogotta and
others doodz in columbia ONLY)

	Number :
	---------------
	0800909000 (old 05909000)

	Frequencie n°1:
	--------------------------
	frequencie a:usually 2650 Hertz
	frequencie b:usually 2350 Hertz
	lenght : 170ms 
	delay : 10ms

	Frequencie n°2:
	--------------------------
	frequencie a:usually 2450 Hertz
	frequencie b:usually 2350 Hertz
	lenght : 320ms 
	delay : 10ms

	interest
	------------	
	 well find a friend or a local provider in columbia, really clean line.. its an inexistant number in
	columbia (el numero no es blahblah..)
	
and well there is another local one if u want to call a little dude in malaysia in normal 2600 2400 for the first
frequencie.

	Number :
	---------------
	0800909140 (old 05909040)

	Frequencie n°1:
	--------------------------
	frequencie a:usually 2600 Hertz
	frequencie b:usually 2400 Hertz
	lenght : 170ms 
	delay : 10ms

	Frequencie n°2:
	--------------------------
	frequencie a:usually 2450 Hertz
	frequencie b:usually 2350 Hertz
	lenght : 320ms 
	delay : 10ms

	interest
	------------	
	 well find a friend or a local provider in columbia, clean line.. operator answers.

Warning:
---------------

Don't bluebox too much , remember NHP/HI (great dude) in besançon city who got busted for month agos for
blueboxing and carding.(for french : but well anyways if u want to bluebox, scan 0800906000 to 0800909999 number,
its like a bunch of foreign lame countries operators, nonexistant , busy , carding, vmb numbers.) , beforer thoses ones,
its "industrialized countries" like USA , Britain or others..


Well another method is the use of PBX :
-----------------------------------------------------------------

It is the thing i use mostly now, bluebox is not really secure i think and i really prefer using thoses little lame thing
(in france) with only a little 4 digits password.
like that one 0800901234 (easy to remember eh?) , a foreign country PBX with only 4 digits.. only 10 000 attempts and
u'll find it.. it doesnt have fake tones or shit.. protection level : 0.
scanning method..well easy as HELL:

	ATDT 0800901234,,,0000,,3336431515 to ATDT 0800901234,,,9999,,3336431515
	          --------------------    -------   --------------------                                      --------
	                        \           \                      \                                                  \
	        PBX number	 Scan is         french number                         end of 
			begining        to call and to see                    scanning
				      if the passwd works

ATDT is the Dial Tone prefix for compatible Hayes modems.
well easy to script or to programm is u have some skills of course.. i YOU don't have any skill .. well 
	OR learn programming , lame scripting
	OR use ure favorite fone and dial 0800901234 , wait 6 seconds, dial 0000 wait 4 seconds, dial 3336431515
				TO
				dial 0800901234 , wait 6 seconds, dial 9999 wait 4 seconds, dial 3336431515

Well another method is the use of Calling Card (YUCK):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uhm.. if you use windows95, if you use Compudaze or AoHell.. i guess u have the correct iq (25) to use that method
calling card.. well i dont have to talk a lot about that.. its easy as hell..
1st step: go in a WAREZ channel and ask for it (dont go in #phreak because you will get banned)
2nd step: dial your favorite ATT or France Telecom operator
3rd step: a) get an american voice if u are french and say:
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	"Hello i would like an international call"
		- Card Number Please?
	Dial on your phone pad or tell it "My card number is blahblahblah"
		- Phone number to call?
	"i want to call 33 36431515" and then prepare your modem with an ATD to connect the french teletel
	network and prepare to play on ure favorite lame game servers on it (mud in 1200 bauds, imagines yuck).
	(Dangerous, if u are suspected on the server you are to fraud, the system operator will call 
	0800361415 and tells that someone is frauding on his server your id on his server )

	b) you use a France telecom paster card.
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	its only a device, dial your card digits and the number to call without the 33 if its in France cause u are damn
	calling local in france (Really dangerous, get busted if you dont do it from a Payfone)


Well for easy use, only that method for you lazy people,next time i'll talk about some methods for experienced people
i guess.. write me and ask me questions in memor@mygale.org

memor [HBS]

-----=====[ C Tutorials: Introduction to C ]=====----------------------------

	Well here it is. My Attempt to help people learn programming in C.
Thanks to Scud-O I will be releaseing a new tutorial in each issue of THTJ.
If you already know C then this first tutorial will not be much help to you,
I plan on starting off with the very basics and I assume the reader has no
current knowledge of the C language.
	
	First some basic things. You need to understand that you are not 
going to be able to write Windows programs by reading this, and there is
no quick way to it. Windows programming is not easy and you will *not* find
a quick guide to it. All the applications you learn to write thru this will
be text-mode. Depending on how long I keep releaseing tutorials thru THTJ
things will pick up the pace. You also need to know that what I tell you here
is no different then what you would find in a beginners guide to C book. What
is the main differnce then? Well from me it is free and if you want to go
buy a book it about 50 dollars. Also you can communicate with me. Any 
questions you have you can always e-mail me and I will help you out.
	
	Also if I refer to certain compiler I will be refering to Microsoft
Visual C++, because this is the compiler I use. It really doesn't matter tho
because I have used Borland C++ and there is basically no differnce accept
for certain options.

	When you write a program it always starts out with the source. You
open up your editor and write the source for the program. The source is what
tells your program what you want it to do. The traditional first c program
is usually hello.c, well here is my version of it... fuckyou.c

#include <stdio.h>

void main()
{
	printf("Fuck you, world!@!\n");
}


Now what does all that do? I will explain that in a moment. First off just
write that in you editor. And go to build and you should see the following:

--------------------Configuration: fuckyou - Win32 Debug--------------------
Compiling...
fuckyou.c
Linking...
fuckyou.exe - 0 error(s), 0 warning(s)

Pretty easy huh? Now on to the next step. Compiling the program. Go to compile
and you will see the following:

--------------------Configuration: fuckyou - Win32 Debug--------------------
Compiling...
fuckyou.c
fuckyou.obj - 0 error(s), 0 warning(s)

Now you have done it. Your first program. All this program does is it will
open up a DOS window and print the words "Fuck you, world!@!" If you didn't
get this then you most likely messed up the source somewhere. That is no
problem tho. Suppose you left out the ; after \n"). Then you would get
this as the result of compiling:

--------------------Configuration: fuckyou - Win32 Debug--------------------
Compiling...
fuckyou.c
C:\Windows\Desktop\fuckyou.c(6) : error C2143: syntax error : missing ';' before '}'
Error executing cl.exe.
fuckyou.obj - 1 error(s), 0 warning(s)

The compiler tells you where the error is. [C:\Windows\Desktop\fuckyou.c(6)]
The (6) tells you that the error occured on line 6 of the program. And it tells
you what the error is, missing ';' before '}'. So all you do is go back to
the source and insert ; where it belongs in the source and try again. This time
it should work.

So now back to the original source..

#include <stdio.h>

void main()
{
	printf("Fuck you, world!@!\n");
}

What does all this mean? Well I am just gonna put what each part means in the
order they occur:

#include - This is what tells the compiler to include another file along with
your source.

<stdio.h> - This is the included file with the program you just wrote. The
file stdio.h has standard input/output commands that most programs need.

void main - This has two parts. Void identified the type of function and what
it produces. This would be main, and since main does not produce anything in
this program you have void.

() - Right now this doesn't matter. Just know that you do it. You occasionaly
may have something in them but not now.

You then have {. Everything between the first { bracket and the last } bracket
is a function. The {} show that everything between them is a function of main().

printf - This tells the program what to do. This is also one of the reasons
you need to include stdio.h with this program. With out it the compiler does
not understand printf. 

After printf you have a string (the text you wrote) include in parentheses.
When you want to print words on the screen you will use the following:
(" Blah blah blah \n") The \n is just showing its the end of the string and
that you start a new line after that. 

The whole line ends with ; which tells the compiler that the statement ends.
Then you finish the whole thing off with the last } bracket.

	So there you have it. Like I said this first one was going to be very
basic but in following issues of THTJ I plan to move along faster and not
get very technical with things you don't really need to know. But this is 
it for now.

         comedy@fatboy.geog.unsw.edu.au


The rules listed below apply to the calling of Shotgun (the passenger seat) in
an automobile. These rules are definitive and binding.

Section I
The Basic Rules

1. In order to call Shotgun, the caller must pronounce the word "Shotgun" in a
clear voice. This call must be heard and acknowledged by the driver. The other
occupants of the vehicle need not hear the call as long as the driver verifies
the call.

2. Shotgun may only be called if all occupants of the vehicle are outside and
on the way to said vehicle.

3. Early calls are strictly prohibited. Shotgun may only be called while
walking toward the vehicle and only applies to the drive immediately
forthcoming. Shotgun can never be called while inside a vehicle or
stilltechnically on the way to the first location. For example, one can not get
out of a vehicle and call Shotgun for the return journey.

4. The driver has final say in all ties and disputes. The driver has the right
to suspend or remove all shotgun privileges from one or more persons.


Section II
Special Cases

These special exceptions to the rules above should be considered in the order
presented; the case listed first will take precedence over any of the cases
beneath it, when applicable.

1. In the instance that the normal driver of a vehicle is drunk or otherwise
unable to perform their duties as driver, then he/she is automatically given
Shotgun.

2. If the instance that the person who actually owns the vehicle is not
driving, then he/she is automatically given Shotgun, unless they decline.

3. In the instance the the driver's spouse, lover, partner, or hired prostitute
for the evening is going to accompany the group, he/she is automatically given
Shotgun, unless they decline.

4. In the instance that one of the passengers may become so ill during the
course of the journey that the other occupants feel he/she will toss their
cookies, then the ill person should be given Shotgun to make appropriate use of
the window.

5. In the instance that only one person knows how to get to a given location
and this person is not the driver, then as the designated navigator for the
group they automatically get Shotgun, unless they decline.

6. In the instance that one of the occupants is too wide or tall to fit
comfortably in the back seat, then the driver may show mercy and award Shotgun
to the genetic misfit. Alternatively, the driver and other passengers may
continually taunt the poor fellow as they make a three hour trip with him
crammed in the back.


Section III
The Survival of the Fittest Rule

1. If the driver so wishes, he/she may institute the Survival of the Fittest
Rule on the process of calling Shotgun. In this case all rules, excepting I-4,
are suspended and the passenger seat is occupied by whoever can take it by
force.

2. The driver must announce the institution of the Survival of the Fittest Rule
with reasonable warning to all passengers. This clause reduces the amount of
blood lost by passengers and the damage done to the vehicle.

Please follow the above rules to the best of your ability. If there are any
arguments or exceptions not covered in these rules, please refer to rule I-4.

 Bellcore signs MOU with World Communication Group to explore wireless local 
 loop opportunities in China    
 June 9, 1997

 SINGAPORE -- Bellcore International and World Communication Group announced 
 today that they signed a Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) to explore the 
 possibilities of deploying wireless local loop and mobility networks 
 throughout China. The two companies announced this during Asia Telecom 1997. 
 
Under the terms of the memorandum, WCG would serve as system integrator and 
general contractor. Bellcore would provide consulting services to WCG on a 
variety of issues, including planning and engineering, integration testing 
and training. Bellcore would also supply software products such as mobility 
and network management products. 

"We have every expectation that Wireless Local Loop (WLL) service and 
technology will help meet unmet demand for telephone services throughout 
China," said Peter Wang, WCG's president and CEO. This MOU with Bellcore, a 
world-class provider of communications software with in-depth network 
knowledge, is a very important first step. Now we look forward to increasing 
the number of signed agreements with hardware suppliers and winning numerous 
new deployment contracts. 

At the basis of the memorandum is Personal Access Communications System, or 
PACS, an outgrowth of Bellcore Technologies. PACS services are a low-cost, 
wireline-quality alternative to conventional wireless services. They are 
particularly well-suited to densely populated areas, such as urban and 
suburban environments. 

"We believe our MOU with WCG marks a great beginning," said Kevin Connolly, 
president of Bellcore International. "Our wireless telecommunications 
software and consulting expertise is complemented by WCG's system integration 
strengths, on the ground sales, service and engineering staff, and track 
record in China. We're excited about working with them to make PACS WLL and 
mobility services available in China, arguably the world's largest potential 
telecom market." 

Bellcore International is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bellcore. Bellcore, 
based in Morristown, New Jersey, USA, is a leading provider of communications 
software, engineering and consulting services based on world-class research. 
Bellcore provides business solutions that help information technology work 
for telecommunications carriers, businesses and governments worldwide. On 
November 21, 1996 SAIC (Science Applications International Corporation) 
announced it had agreed to purchase Bellcore when the requisite regulatory 
approvals had been obtained. More information about Bellcore is available on 
the Web at www.bellcore.com. 

WCG is a fast growing wireless telecommunication company headquartered in 
Hazlet, New Jersey. It is a leading distributor of wireless telephony (fixed 
wireless) equipment and also a major service provider in China. The majority 
of its products and services focus on wireless local loop technology and 
wireless payphones.

 AT&T CEO to argue merits of Baby Bell tie-up    
 June 9, 1997
 By Eric Auchard

 NEW YORK (Reuter) - AT&T Corp Chairman Robert Allen plans to defend a 
 possible merger between AT&T and a Baby Bell local phone carrier in a 
 luncheon speech Tuesday before an exeuctive group in Boston, the company 
 said.

An AT&T spokeswoman said Allen's comments on such a potential merger will be 
"hypothetical" and that he will not comment on recent media reports that AT&T 
is in talks to merge with SBC Communications Inc., a leading U.S. Baby Bell.

Sources familiar with those talks have confirmed that the two companies have 
been holding substantive talks in recent months on a combination that could 
be valued at more than $50 billion, in what would be the largest merger in 
history.

Both companies have declined to comment on the reports.

A union of SBC and AT&T would combine a mighty provider of local phone 
services with the nation's leading long-distance powerhouse in the first such 
merger since the 1982 federal order breaking apart the Bell phone system 
monopoly.

Allen is set to deliver the speech before the Chief Executives Club at the 
Boston Harbor Hotel.

He will discuss the pros and cons that a merger with a regional local phone 
operator might give AT&T, the spokeswoman said.

Among the questions he will address are whether there is any way in which a 
merger could be in keeping with the spirit of recent efforts to deregulate 
the phone industry, and the U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996 in 
particular, she said.

He will confront widespread antitrust concerns such a mega-merger might raise 
by arguing that a combination with a regional Bell company could actually act 
to spur greater competition in U.S. telecommunication markets, she said.

"Is such a hypothetical merger that unthinkable? Is there any way in which 
it could actually function to spur local competition?" the spokeswoman said, 
referring to topics to be raised by Allen in his speech.

"The main thing will be to firmly reiterate our commitment to competition 
and set the record staight on that," she said. "He certainly is going to 
address how significant we consider entry into the local service market."

Jeffrey Kagan, an industry analyst based in Atlanta, speculated, "Tomorrow 
will probably be an effort to soften the criticism that reports of AT&T's 
merger talks with SBC have inspired."

Critics have argued an AT&T merger would delay the advent of increased 
competition in local U.S. phone markets and note that SBC retains 
near-monopoly status in seven states in the Southern, central and Western 
United States, including the region served by SBC's recently acquired Pacific 
Telesis Group unit.

"Everybody is thinking of every reason why it can't happen," Kagan said of 
the initial public reaction to AT&T's reported merger talks. "Allen will 
argue everything that could possibly go right with such a merger."

He said Allen may sketch a potential plan to open up local phone markets to 
competition by splitting Baby Bell operators into separate wholesale and 
retail operations.

The wholesale unit would then sell its services to both competitors and to a 
combined AT&T-Baby Bell local service retail operation, Kagan said.

The plan would be designed to answer U.S. regulators' concerns that the 
market be "irreversibly open" to competition before Baby Bells are allowed 
into the U.S. long-distance phone market, he said.

 U S West pulls high-speed, low-cost service, angers ISPs, according to 
 'Inter@ctive Week'    
 June 6, 1997 

 GARDEN CITY, N.Y. -- U S West Communications, the $13 billion communications 
 giant, is discontinuing a service that allows competing telephone companies 
 and Internet service providers to offer high-speed services at low prices, 
 according to a story posted on the Website of Inter@ctive Week. 

The move is drawing the ire of the Internet community. 

U S West, which does business in 14 Great Plains and Pacific Northwest 
states, has stoped leasing "dry copper" lines in seven or eight of its 
states, and is working to pull the plug in its remaining service areas, 
according to the Inter@ctive Week report. 

Dry copper lines -- also known as Local Area Data Service, or LADS -- are 
standard twisted pair copper lines that are in place but aren't hooked up to 
provide telephone service. The lines, which use a low-powered signal are used 
for such things as security alarms and are relatively cheap to lease from U S 
West -- as low as $20 per month. 

In recent months, however, Internet service providers, or ISPs, and 
competitive local exchange carriers, or CLECs, have bought dry copper lines 
to resell to business customers equipped with Digital Subscriber Line, or 
xDSL, modems, devices that allow for fast Internet access. 

By cutting off the low-cost resale of dry copper lines, however, U S West 
effectively cuts off competitive provision of xDSL service at prices below 
what the telephone company wants to charge. U S West's Interprise Networking 
Services group, meanwhile, is slated to offer its own xDSL service this 
summer. 

Ray Guadia, director of AZAP Inc., a Las Vegas-based company that specializes 
in secure store and forward data transfers sees the move as an effort by U S 
West to protect artificially high prices for other services, such as its T-1 
service at 1.5 Mbps. 

"It is not in the telcos' advantage to allow that wide bandwidth access under 
the 1996 telecommunications law because customers who are currently leasing 
(dedicated) T-1 for $2,000 can lease (dry copper) T-1 lines for under $100 a 
month, literally hundreds of millions of profits can switch from the telcos 
to the business community at large," Guadia told Inter@ctive Week. 

U S West said, however, that it's concerned about network degradation because 
these dry copper connections weren't intended to support high-speed services. 

XDSL signals can disrupt other services, when wires carrying both sets of 
service are bundled together within the telephone network. 

"The (dry copper connections) were intended to be just a signaling channel, 
like burglar alarm companies use," said Jeremy Story, spokesman for the U S 
West Interprise Networking Services group. "Essentially ISPs have latched on 
to this to create their own circuits and are providing (lots of) bandwidth 
across them. What that's doing is messing up the network," he said. 

Having high-bandwidth connections ruining in two directions within a central 
switching office results in what is known as cross-talk, said Joe Glynn, 
director of product marketing for megabit services, including xDSL services, 
at Interprise. 

Cross talk is caused by electromagnetic fields surrounding xDSL circuits that 
causes degradation on nearby cable bundles, he said. 

U S West is grandfathering in existing companies that are using the copper 
connections for high-bandwidth services. But that's a very limited group at 
this time, Story said. 

Inter@ctive Week, with a circulation of 100,000 is the leading publication 
for the Internet-involved business professional. Inter@ctive Week is 
published by Inter@ctive Enterprises LLC.

 AOL "Snoops On Members' Privacy" 
 06/09/97
 By David Braun, TechInvestor

 WASHINGTON  America Online snoops into its subscribers incomes and details 
 of their children, selling the information aggressively through a broker to 
 third parties, a consumer watchdog group charged Monday.

At a press conference to coincide with this weeks hearings by the Federal 
Trade Commission on online privacy issues, the editor of Privacy Times, Evan 
Hendricks, said he had spoken to at least 10 members of AOL, "and not one of 
them was aware this could be happening to them."

While AOL users may be in the dark, the company has made it quite clear to 
investors that it expects to market its members. And AOL shares have surged 
recently on stronger-than-expected earnings and speculation that the company 
would be announcing more marketing deals to profit from its members. 

Hendricks published a front-page article in the latest edition of Privacy 
Times which said Reston, Va.-based AOL had turned to traditional direct 
marketing techniques to learn about its 8 million subscribers incomes, 
length of residence, age and children.

"Then it aggressively sells its subscriber list through a broker, which can 
break it out into various segments."

Consequently, Hendricks added, AOL members increasingly are targeted by junk 
mailers. "The practices raise questions about the adequacy of notice that AOL 
provides its members about marketing practices."

Privacy Times quoted AOL spokesperson Tricia Primrose saying the online 
service provider was not willing to give details of how much money the 
company made selling members lists.

Hendricks said AOL recently put on the market a specialized list of 1.4 
million AOL members who purchase books, CD Roms, software games, AOL apparel 
from the AOL Store, direct mail and marketing. "The vast majority of AOL 
members on this specialized list are married with children living at home, 
are between the ages of 35-54, own their home, have income over $55,000, are 
at their home addresses and are credit worthy  over 90 percent pay by credit 
card," he said.

The lists, which are said to be selling well, go for $110 per thousand names. 
They are marketed through a company called List Services Corp.

Primrose said Monday she would comment later on Hendricks allegations.

AOL members interested in learning about the companys list practices are 
told to enter "marketing preferences" into a key-word search. The company 
tells members it "occasionally makes our membership list available to select, 
reputable companies whose products and services may be of interest to you AOL 
carefully screens all offers to its mailing list to ensure they are 
appropriate." Members are invited to list hobbies and interests they can 
check-off so they can receive information about those interests. According to 
Hendricks, none of the lists sold by List Services Corp. referenced the 15 
hobbies and interests on AOLs marketing preferences screen.

Hendricks said personal details, such as income levels and information about 
children, are added to AOLs profiles by means of marketing research.

AOL members are given the option to check a box on the marketing preferences 
screen to request that they do not receive any junk mail.

 Netscape bug illustrates risky world of Net security   
 June 15, 1997
 BY DAVID L. WILSON
 Mercury News Staff Writer  

 Fifteen-year-old Tim Howe of Milpitas did millions of Internet users a favor 
 in March when he identified a security hole in Microsoft's Internet Explorer 
 Web browser, a flaw that might have let outsiders view data on someone 
 else's computer. He says he had trouble getting the software giant to take 
 him seriously, but eventually Microsoft agreed there was a problem.

"I was hoping for maybe a thank you," the 10th grader said, laughing, "but 
at least they fixed it, and that was the point."

It's the point for a legion of Internet bug finders these days. They range 
from self-taught youngsters to computer science professionals. Howe worked 
solo, and didn't spend a great deal of time looking for the bug. Others work 
in teams, sometimes knowing teammates only by code names, and devote many of 
their waking hours to the task. And among the teams, some have malevolent 
aims.

The bug finders' work matters because your electronic privacy matters, as was 
made clear again last week with the discovery of a bug in the Netscape 
browser. Computer security is a growing issue as more and more of our 
computers become connected via networks. Bugs that leave security holes in 
Internet software can be a threat to data on all kinds of computers, 
including the ones at home.

Competitive pressures, meanwhile, have led software developers to push their 
products out the door sooner than ever. There have always been bugs in 
software, but the rush to market has made them more common, experts say. In 
addition, today's programs are much larger, with more capabilities, and are 
therefore more likely to conflict with each other in ways that cause 
problems.

 Like many bug finders, Howe went immediately to the company with his 
 findings. But some bug-hunting teams first share their findings via the Net, 
 banding together to explore the severity of the problem and to cobble 
 together a solution. They are hackers in the original sense of the word, 
 exploring and testing new systems just for fun. Some people, including 
 Eugene H. Spafford, associate professor of computer science at Purdue 
 University, call those who work to repair computer security holes the 
 "White Hats."

Also looking for bugs -- but in ways that Spafford and other experts find 
alarming -- are more malevolent hackers, known as "crackers" or "Black 
Hats." They don't want to plug the security holes, however. They want to use 
those bugs to snoop, spy, steal and often harass. (The precise definition of 
"hacker" or "cracker" depends largely on who's using the terms; many 
crackers insist they're hackers.)


Formality shunned

 In keeping with the anarchic nature of the Net itself, the White Hats have 
 no formal organization. They shun the semi-official Internet security system 
 that revolves about the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination 
 Center, based at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.

The White Hats and security teams are often in direct conflict, with the 
official teams trying to keep a lid on knowledge about bugs until a fix is 
available. At the same time, the White Hats publicly pool their knowledge, 
racing to stay ahead of the Black Hats who, they assume, have as much 
information as they do.

Black Hats and White Hats -- the crackers and the hackers -- both win status 
points from peers for solving tough problems, and enjoy the intellectual 
challenges presented by computer security. But White Hats work on security 
problems to make the Net a little safer for everyone, including themselves.

White Hats and Black Hats rarely engage in the work for direct monetary 
profit, however, and that's one of the things that made last week's incident 
with Netscape Communications Corp. so unusual. In that case, a man who 
appears to represent a Danish computer consulting company called Cabocomm 
told Netscape that he wanted a large payment or else he would distribute the 
information publicly, with obvious risks to the company's stock price.


Question of reward

 The consultant said Netscape's $1,000 bounty for significant bugs wasn't 
 close to what the information was worth; most other companies provide 
 something like a T-shirt for such information.

Netscape announced last week that it had developed a patch for the problem 
itself.

Offering money for bug discoveries has drawn contempt from some hackers.

 "We had a standing offer of $10,000 to anybody who could break into our 
 site, but we stopped offering money when people in the community told us it 
 was insulting," said Brett Nelson, firewalls product marketing manager for 
 Secure Computing Corp., a computer security company with headquarters in 
 Roseville, Minn. "Now we just offer things like nice leather jackets."

Nelson said no one has successfully broken into the site, and he calls the 
Netscape incident unusual.

"To a certain degree, what happened with Netscape -- you pay me what I want, 
or I hurt you -- is extortion, and right now it's not extremely common," he 
said. "But if somebody like Netscape caved in, I think it could become 
common."

Already common are concerted efforts to test security systems by hackers and 
crackers alike. At any time, on any computer system, the odds are good that 
software written by the "intruder community," as law enforcement calls it, 
is probing for unplugged holes.

If a vulnerable computer is found, word quickly spreads throughout the Black 
Hat community, whose members then rifle through files for anything useful. 
They sometimes use the machine to hide data, but nearly always use it as a 
jumping-off point to stage more attacks and better conceal their identities.


Shared solutions

 The White Hats also constantly run such software through the paces, and 
 whenever anybody finds something troubling, they post it to one of many 
 electronic mailing lists or bulletin boards that deal with the topic. Other 
 list members study the bug and try to re-create it on different systems. 
 Then they proffer temporary solutions while working on more permanent fixes.
 
One of the most respected security mailing lists is BUGTRAQ, administered by 
a man whose nom de guerre is Aleph One. He says his real name is Elias Levy, 
and that he is a computer security expert employed by a major Silicon Valley 
company. (Levy agreed to an interview on condition that his company remain 
unnamed.)

Levy doesn't get paid for administering the list, which can suck up free time 
the way a black hole sucks in light. "If we didn't do this, you'd never see 
fixes for problems, because only the bad guys would know about them," he 
said.

Levy and others deride the concept of not telling people about bugs until 
you've got a fix for them -- a policy they call "security through 
obscurity." It doesn't work because the intruder community already knows 
about the flaws, they insist.

Many members of the teams that don't announce bugs before fixes acknowledge 
the system's potential flaws. "I can see both sides to it," said William J. 
Orvis, a member of the U.S. Energy Department's Computer Incident Advisory 
Capability, which, along with the other nearly 60 members of the 
international Forum of Incident Security Response Teams, keeps its lips 
zipped about problems until finding a solution.


`A hard call'

 "I would love to involve everybody in the process, on the assumption that 
 the bad guys already know about it, but the wannabes might not know about 
 it," he said. "This is a hard call to make, but we don't put out a 
 bulletin until we have a fix."

A member of another security team, commenting on condition of anonymity, said 
this policy has won reasonably good cooperation from some major software 
vendors who know that their product lines won't be damaged by a public 
announcement of a security problem with no solution.

"But some of these companies have had significant problems with their 
products for years, and have made no attempt to patch them," said the team 
member. "Oftentimes, the only way to get these guys to act is when something 
gets publicized."

In that sense, the official security community and the unofficial White Hat 
community work with each other. Often, the mailing lists identify a problem, 
and the security teams -- members read the lists religiously -- squeeze the 
software vendor to build a patch. And many corporate computer security 
administrators wait for an official release from a security team before using 
a fix the White Hats have created.

There's not likely to be any lack of work for members of either group any 
time soon.

 "The bad guys are just looking for a machine to break into," said Orvis. 
 "They don't care what's in the machine. If you've got 1,000 computers 
 connected to the Internet, it's a good bet that somebody is banging on your 
 door daily."

 Netscape fixes flaw, foils blackmail threat   
 June 14, 1997
 BY TOM QUINLAN
 Mercury News Staff Writer  

 A trans-Atlantic cyber scandal reached a rapid resolution Friday as Netscape 
 Communications Corp. said it had fixed a serious security problem in its 
 widely used Internet browser products, thus ending the get-rich-quick scheme 
 of the Danish computer consultant who had notified Netscape of the problem 
 and sought a reward.

The Mountain View company plans to post early next week the solution for the 
browser bug -- which in rare cases would let a Web site operator grab files 
stored on a personal computer.

The company said that, after testing the solution, it will first post to its 
Web site the fix for Netscape Communicator, its newest browser. Software 
fixes for Netscape Navigator's 2.0 and 3.0 series, which represent the 
overwhelming majority of current Netscape users, will be posted "shortly 
thereafter," a spokeswoman said, although no specific time frame was given.

The bug affects all systems supported by Netscape's browsers, including 
computers running the Windows, Macintosh and Unix operating systems. 

Although software glitches are common, the Netscape bug drew attention 
because of the way it unfolded late Thursday, with Netscape characterizing 
the Danish company as behaving outrageously in its efforts to extract a big 
payment rather than cooperate in fixing the flaw.

In e-mail correspondence, the consulting company told Netscape, using 
increasingly threatening tones, that it would publicly reveal the flaw's 
existence if Netscape didn't pay more than its standard $1,000 bounty to bug 
finders.

The Danish outfit -- identified as Cabocomm and represented by Christian 
Orellana in e-mail exchanges obtained Friday from Netscape -- did indeed 
arrange for media coverage Thursday, at the time Netscape was holding its 
developer conference in San Jose and was preparing for the imminent shipment 
of Communicator.

The messages to Netscape began several days ago, with Orellana at first 
seeming exasperated that he hadn't received a response and then asking for 
unspecified but significant amounts of money. Early on, providing only a 
bare-bones description of the flaw, Orellana asked that Netscape respond by 
the time of the developers' conference.

"I think the person most suited for handling this is somebody in charge of 
the company checkbook," Orellana wrote.

In later messages, Orellana informed Netscape that he was prepared to release 
the information to news organizations if the two companies could not reach an 
agreement.

After detailing the effects of the bug, "...I think all pre-Communicator 
versions of Navigator... would be pretty worthless," Orellana said. "I'll 
leave it to you to estimate what impact that would have on Netscape stocks."

Cable News Network's vehicle for financial news, CNNfn, and PC Magazine both 
reported the problem Thursday, and Netscape's stock dropped Friday, by $1.06 
to $32.25.

During the week, senior engineers and programmers at Netscape talked to 
Cabocomm engineers in an effort to determine exactly what the problem was, 
said company spokeswoman Jennifer O'Mahony. "(Cabocomm) wasn't very 
forthcoming," she said. "They felt if they said too much, they'd be giving 
everything away."

While Netscape was talking with Cabocomm, a separate Netscape team of 
programmers tried to track down the problem independently.

Although Netscape wouldn't identify details of the glitch Friday, or where in 
the program it resided, "in the end Cabocomm wasn't any help," O'Mahony 
said. "We ended up knowing a lot more about it than they did."

Efforts by the Mercury News to contact Orellana by telephone Friday were 
unsuccessful.

 Netscape said Friday it was determining whether it would seek legal action 
 against the Danish firm.

Although the idea of threatening to go public with the information could be 
seen as a form of extortion under California's criminal code, extortion could 
be a very difficult point to prove, said Alan Ruby, a San Jose attorney who 
is a criminal law specialist.

"It's a fine line, sometimes," Ruby said. "Things that corporations say 
everyday in the course of normal business dealings sometimes come close. It 
really depends on how something is said, and the context it's said in." 

An increasing number of security breaches have come to light in recent 
months, even as the Internet takes shape as a key global medium for business 
and personal communications. Financial transactions and other sensitive 
information frequently travel across the Net.

In the case of the Netscape browser flaw, a person who was aware of it could 
develop a Web site that could read files directly off a user's hard drive. 
The Web site would have to know the exact name of the files it wanted to 
read, as well as the location on the user's hard disk.

That's not as hard as it might appear because file names share a lot of 
similar characteristics. Someone seeking to read those files would probably 
be able to successfully guess file names, at least occasionally.

Netscape downplayed the seriousness of the flaw, pointing out that apparently 
only one Web site had been created that took advantage of the bug, even 
though the problem has been in Netscape's products for at least 17 months. 
And Netscape was able to fix the problem in a matter of days after it learned 
of it.

Microsoft Corp. recently acknowledged that Web-based applications written 
with the two most popular Internet software development environments -- known 
as Java and ActiveX -- can be written to damage or change information stored 
on a user's computer, something that Java users had been told would be 
impossible. Microsoft has said that all known problems in its Web browsing 
software have been fixed.

Also, special software can read e-mail messages or determine what someone is 
looking at on the Web if the data are flowing through certain cable modems, 
which are expected to be one of the most commonly used ways for consumers to 
surf the Internet.

 McNealy Injects Java With $150 Million          
 06/13/97
 By Malcolm Maclachlan, TechWire

 SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy is not known for 
 holding back his opinions. True to form, McNealy delivered some zingers 
 Friday on why Java is better than Windows.

Delivering the final keynote at the Netscape Developer Conference here, 
McNealy attacked Microsoft on areas such as scalability and compatibility. He 
also outlined a vision of the future in which Java is embedded in computers 
from the mainframe down to the smart card.

"When you hear the word `thin client,' you may think of this," he said, 
pulling a smart card out of his wallet. "See how thin this is? Now can you 
imagine any Windows technology on a smart card? If you wanted to put it in 
your wallet, you'd have to redesign every pair of trousers on the planet."

The tools exist today, he said, to embed Java in everyday items such as wrist 
watches, which could then communicate the information to the level of 
mainframes. The result, he said, could be a world in which a watch, with an 
antennae in the hand, could act as a debit card, car key and airplane 
boarding pass.

This is the kind of scalability Microsoft is still trying to reach, he said, 
with its multiple versions of Windows, ranging from the handheld version, Win 
CE, up to the server software, Win NT.

Sun is investing $150 million in R&D in Java in the next year, McNealy said. 
Among these projects: a default Java user interface for NCs, PCs and other 
devices; new chips that will make Java run faster; the new Java Developer Kit 
1.2 Security Manager; and an Active X "bridge" for encapsulating Active X 
code into a Java-type bean.

McNealy pointed to his company's close relationship with Netscape 
Communications, in Mountain View, Calif. Most of Netscape's Web hosting and 
databases run on SunSoft's Solaris, he said, and the company uses 700 Sun 
Stations. Sun, in the meantime, hosts numerous Netscape engineers working on 
joint development.

This meeting of Netscape and the Solaris development offers the greatest hope 
for open standards for Internet development, he said, and for continued 
opportunities for small developers.

"When is the last time you heard of a Windows start-up?," he asked. "Do a 
Windows business plan, submit it to a venture capitalist and see if you get a 
call back."

 NTT Gets Carved Up Into Three Carriers 
 06/13/97
 By Douglas Hayward, TechWire

 TOKYO -- Japan's expensive and heavily regulated telecommunications market 
 came closer to U.S.-style competition Friday, when the Japanese parliament 
 passed legislation restructuring the country's dominant carrier, Nippon 
 Telegraph and Telephone.

The upper house of Japan's legislature gave final approval to a government 
provision that will divide NTT into three carriers -- two regional companies 
and an international carrier -- controlled by a single holding company. NTT, 
which has sales of 8 trillion yen ($70 billion), will also be allowed to 
compete in the international market for the first time.

Friday's passage of the law will put the company into direct competition with 
KDD, Japan's dominant international carrier, in both international and 
domestic markets. In return for NTT being allowed to compete in the 
international market, KDD will be allowed to compete with the former 
state-owned NTT when the law goes into effect, probably in late 1999.

KDD is said to be talking to regional Japanese utilities about plans to 
establish a second national telecom infrastructure.

Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications said the reforms will 
increase the competitiveness -- and reduce the costs -- of Japan's huge but 
expensive telecom industry. The Japanese government said it is committed to 
letting foreign telecom carriers -- such as AT&T -- enter the domestic 
market, though legislation deregulating the Japanese market has not yet been 
passed.

The new law and the planned deregulation measures would create "a new era of 
competition" in the Japanese telecom market, said Hisao Horinouchi, the 
minister for posts and telecommunications.

 Spy Agency Wants To Sell Advice 
 06/11/97
 By Douglas Hayward, TechWire

 LONDON -- The computer services arm of Britain's largest spy agency wants to 
 sell security advice to private utility companies facing hacking attacks 
 from terrorist organizations.

But utilities fearing imminent attacks from terrorist hackers will have to 
wait for advice -- the British government has been pondering the proposal for 
more than two years and has yet to give a date for any decision.

The Communications Electronic Security Group said it wants British government 
officials to grant it the right to advise utilities -- such as electricity, 
gas and telephone companies -- on defense against so-called "information 
warfare" attacks by terrorist groups.

Information warfare involves crippling military and civil information 
networks in pursuit of political and military objectives. The group has the 
right only to sell advice to government organizations.

"Government systems are potential targets for information warfare attacks -- 
that is clear, and it's in our charter," said Tim Webb, head of policy in the 
group, which is part of the giant Government Communications Headquarters 
communications interception organization. Webb's public appearance Wednesday 
at the "Delivering Security To The Desktop" seminar here was one of the first 
by an officer of the spy agency.

But, Webb added, the vulnerability of a nation does not lie in just 
government systems. "Recently the Irish Republican Army was attempting to 
blow up all the [electricity] power sub-stations in London with explosives," 
he said. "Another way to stop the power supply is to hack into the 
appropriate computers and bring the whole lot down."

The computer group of the spy agency is responsible for the security of 
British government networks. As part of its mission, it develops security 
hardware and software, including encryption algorithms.

The Cabinet Office, the government unit that controls the civil service, is 
considering whether to apply some of the group's knowledge about information 
security to protect the national infrastructure, Webb said.

The desire to break into the utilities consulting market stems from reforms 
introduced by the free-market Conservative government of John Major, under 
which the agency was forced for the first time to sell its services to 
government departments to generate operating revenues.

 Hacker Vows 'Terror' for Child Pornographers
 by Steve Silberman 

 2:32pm 13.Jun.97.PDT -- After 17 years in the hacker underground, Christian 
 Valor - well known among old-school hackers and phone phreaks as "Se7en" - 
 was convinced that most of what gets written in the papers about computers 
 and hacking is sensationalistic jive. For years, Valor says, he sneered at 
 reports of the incidence of child pornography on the Net as 
 "exaggerated/over-hyped/fearmongered/bullshit." 

Now making his living as a lecturer on computer security, Se7en claims he 
combed the Net for child pornography for eight weeks last year without 
finding a single image. 

That changed a couple of weeks ago, he says, when a JPEG mailed by an 
anonymous prankster sent him on an odyssey through a different kind of 
underground: IRC chat rooms with names like #littlegirlsex, ftp directories 
crammed with filenames like 6yoanal.jpg and 8&dad.jpg, and newsgroups like 
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.pre-teen. The anonymous file, he says, 
contained a "very graphic" image of a girl "no older than 4 years old." 

On 8 June, Se7en vowed on a hacker's mailing list to deliver a dose of 
"genuine hacker terror" to those who upload and distribute such images on the 
Net. The debate over his methods has stirred up tough questions among his 
peers about civil liberties, property rights, and the ethics of vigilante 
justice. 

A declaration of war 

What Se7en tapped into, he says, was a "very paranoid" network of traders of 
preteen erotica. In his declaration of "public war" - posted to a mailing 
list devoted to an annual hacker's convention called DefCon - Se7en explains 
that the protocol on most child-porn servers is to upload selections from 
your own stash, in exchange for credits for more images. 

What he saw on those servers made him physically sick, he says. "For someone 
who took a virtual tour of the kiddie-porn world for only one day," he 
writes, "I had the opportunity to fully max out an Iomega 100-MB Zip disc." 

Se7en's plan to "eradicate" child-porn traders from the Net is "advocating 
malicious, destructive hacking against these people." He has enlisted the 
expertise of two fellow hackers for the first wave of attacks, which are 
under way. 

Se7en feels confident that legal authorities will look the other way when the 
victims of hacks are child pornographers - and he claims that a Secret 
Service agent told him so explicitly. Referring to a command to wipe out a 
hard drive by remote access, Se7en boasted, "Who are they going to run to? 
The police? 'They hacked my kiddie-porn server and rm -rf'd my computer!' 
Right." 

Se7en claims to have already "taken down" a "major player" - an employee of 
Southwestern Bell who Se7en says was "posting ads all over the place." Se7en 
told Wired News that he covertly watched the man's activities for days, 
gathering evidence that he emailed to the president of Southwestern Bell. 
Pseudonymous remailers like hotmail.com and juno.com, Se7en insists, provide 
no security blanket for traders against hackers uncovering their true 
identities by cracking server logs. Se7en admits the process of gaining 
access to the logs is time consuming, however. Even with three hackers on the 
case, it "can take two or three days. We don't want to hit the wrong person." 

A couple of days after submitting message headers and logs to the president 
and network administrators of Southwestern Bell, Se7en says, he got a letter 
saying the employee was "no longer on the payroll." 

The hacker search for acceptance 

Se7en's declaration of war received support on the original mailing list. "I 
am all for freedom of speech/expression," wrote one poster, "but there are 
some things that are just wrong.... I feel a certain moral obligation to the 
human race to do my part in cleaning up the evil." 

Federal crackdowns targeting child pornographers are ineffective, many 
argued. In April, FBI director Louis Freeh testified to the Senate that the 
bureau operation dubbed "Innocent Images" had gathered the names of nearly 
4,000 suspected child-porn traffickers into its database. Freeh admitted, 
however, that only 83 of those cases resulted in convictions. (The Washington 
Times reports that there have also been two suicides.) 

The director's plan? Ask for more federal money to fight the "dark side of 
the Internet" - US$10 million. 

Pitching in to assist the Feds just isn't the hacker way. As one poster to 
the DefCon list put it, "The government can't enforce laws on the Internet. 
We all know that. We can enforce laws on the Internet. We all know that too." 

The DefCon list was not a unanimous chorus of praise for Se7en's plan to give 
the pornographers a taste of hacker terror, however. The most vocal dissenter 
has been Declan McCullagh, Washington correspondent for the Netly News. 
McCullagh is an outspoken champion of constitutional rights, and a former 
hacker himself. He says he was disturbed by hackers on the list affirming the 
validity of laws against child porn that he condemns as blatantly 
unconstitutional. 

"Few people seem to realize that the long-standing federal child-porn law 
outlawed pictures of dancing girls wearing leotards," McCullagh wrote - 
alluding to the conviction of Stephen Knox, a graduate student sentenced to 
five years in prison for possession of three videotapes of young girls in 
bathing suits. The camera, the US attorney general pointed out, lingered on 
the girls' genitals, though they remained clothed. "The sexual implications 
of certain modes of dress, posture, or movement may readily put the genitals 
on exhibition in a lascivious manner, without revealing them in a nude 
display," the Feds argued - and won. 

It's decisions like Knox v. US, and a law criminalizing completely synthetic 
digital images "presented as" child porn, McCullagh says, that are making the 
definition of child pornography unacceptably broad: a "thought crime." 

The menace of child porn is being exploited by "censor-happy" legislators to 
"rein in this unruly cyberspace," McCullagh says. The rush to revile child 
porn on the DefCon list, McCullagh told Wired News, reminded him of the 
"loyalty oaths" of the McCarthy era. 

"These are hackers in need of social acceptance," he says. "They've been 
marginalized for so long, they want to be embraced for stamping out a social 
evil." McCullagh knows his position is a difficult one to put across to an 
audience of hackers. In arguing that hackers respect the property rights of 
pornographers, and ponder the constitutionality of the laws they're 
affirming, McCullagh says, "I'm trying to convince hackers to respect the 
rule of law, when hacking systems is the opposite of that." 

But McCullagh is not alone. As the debate over Se7en's declaration spread to 
the cypherpunks mailing list and alt.cypherpunks - frequented by an older 
crowd than the DefCon list - others expressed similar reservations over 
Se7en's plan. 

"Basically, we're talking about a Dirty Harry attitude," one network 
technician/cypherpunk told Wired News. Though he senses "real feeling" behind 
Se7en's battle cry, he feels that the best way to deal with pornographers is 
to "turn the police loose on them." Another participant in the discussion 
says that while he condemns child porn as "terrible, intrinsically a crime 
against innocence," he questions the effectiveness of Se7en's strategy. 

"Killing their computer isn't going to do anything," he says, cautioning that 
the vigilante approach could be taken up by others. "What happens if you have 
somebody who doesn't like abortion? At what point are you supposed to be 
enforcing your personal beliefs?" 

Raising the paranoia level 

Se7en's loathing for aficionados of newsgroups like alt.sex.pedophilia.swaps 
runs deeper than "belief." "I myself was abused when I was a kid," Se7en told 
Wired News. "Luckily, I wasn't a victim of child pornography, but I know what 
these kids are going through." 

With just a few hackers working independently to crack server logs, sniff IP 
addresses, and sound the alarm to network administrators, he says, "We can 
take out one or two people a week ... and get the paranoia level up," so that 
"casual traders" will be frightened away from IRC rooms like 
"#100%preteensexfuckpics." 

It's not JPEGs of clothed ballerinas that raise his ire, Se7en says. It's 
"the 4-year-olds being raped, the 6-year-old forced to have oral sex with cum 
running down themselves." Such images, Se7en admits, are very rare - even in 
online spaces dedicated to trading sexual imagery of children. 

"I know what I'm doing is wrong. I'm trampling on the rights of these guys," 
he says. "But somewhere in the chain, someone is putting these images on 
paper before they get uploaded. Your freedom ends when you start hurting 
other people."

 The Ultimate Caller ID
 by David J. Wallace 

 9:07am 13.Jun.97.PDT -- Move over, GPS. British astronomer Peter 
 Duffett-Smith has invented a technology that can pinpoint a digital cellular 
 phone's location within a few hundred feet. The system, called Cursor, 
 tracks a handset by radio triangulation - a method similar to the use of 
 radio telescopes to chart distant galaxies. 

Using a ping-and-reply system, a transmitter network relays the handset's 
location on the same 900-MHz phone frequencies. When the technology becomes 
commercially available in 1998, marketer Cambridge Positioning Systems 
envisions GPS-like uses such as regional mapping and enhanced 911 tracking. 

Privacy advocates have another take on it. "This is likely to be used by law 
enforcement to trace signals," says Marc Rotenberg, director of the 
Electronic Privacy Information Center. Under current law, telcos don't reveal 
call locations. But the FBI is petitioning to change this. "In the old days," 
notes Rotenberg, "the phone didn't move."

 Poll: U.S. hiding knowledge of aliens 
 
 (CNN) -- Nearly 50 years since an alleged UFO was sighted at Roswell, New 
 Mexico, a new CNN/Time poll released Sunday shows that 80 percent of 
 Americans think the government is hiding knowledge of the existence of 
 extraterrestrial life forms.   

While nearly three-quarters of the 1,024 adults questioned for the poll said 
they had never seen or known anyone who saw a UFO, 54 percent believe 
intelligent life exists outside Earth.  

Sixty-four percent of the respondents said that aliens have contacted humans, 
half said they've abducted humans, and 37 percent said they have contacted 
the U.S. government. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points.  

But only 9 percent said they believed there were any aliens near the 
Hale-Bopp comet, which recently passed close enough to Earth to be seen with 
the naked eye.  

Some "ufologists" believed a spacecraft was hidden near the comet, and 
members of the Heaven's Gate cult committed suicide, believing that they 
would be taken aboard the craft and returned "home."  

What happened in Roswell?  

As for the Roswell incident, nearly two-thirds of the respondents to the poll 
said they believed that a UFO crash-landed in a field outside the New Mexico 
town 50 years ago next month.  

In one of the most famous UFO "sightings" in U.S. history, Roswell residents 
in 1947 saw lights in the night sky, followed by a loud explosion. A rancher 
found the "crash site" and removed a large piece of debris, storing it in his 
shed.  

A few days later, Air Force officials from nearby Roswell Air Force Base 
inspected the site and the debris, and issued a press release announcing the 
recovery of a "flying disc." The Air Force quickly retracted that statement, 
and claimed the debris was from a weather balloon.  

But countless statements -- some from military personnel -- appeared to 
contradict the Air Force's revised position. And several "witnesses" claimed 
to have seen bodies of dead aliens whisked away by the military.  

Roswell today capitalizes on its fame as a UFO crash site -- whether or not 
it actually happened -- and is hosting a 50th anniversary celebration the 
first week of July.  Friend or foe? 

Most people -- 91 percent -- told the pollsters that they had never had 
contact with aliens or known anyone who had. A similar number -- 93 percent 
-- said they had never been abducted or known anyone whisked away by beings 
from another planet.  

But if they do meet someone from a galaxy far, far away, 44 percent said they 
expect to be treated as friends, while 26 percent think they'll be treated as 
enemies.  

Thirty-nine percent don't expect aliens to appear very humanoid, although 35 
percent said they probably look "somewhat" human.

 Computer group unites to break computer code But it took 4 months  
 June 19, 1997
 
 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Using the Internet to harness the combined power of 
 their machines, thousands of computer users broke a government-endorsed code 
 that protects electronic money transfers.  

The group, organized by programmer Rocke Verser, took four months to read a 
message that had been scrambled using the code, known as the Data Encryption 
Standard. The code was finally broken Tuesday.  

The national standard, or DES, was considered almost unbreakable when 
introduced in 1977. It is required in most federal agencies but not the 
military, and is also widely used in the private sector.  

Critical information in computers is protected by the national standard and 
other encryption programs that use very large numbers to scramble 
information. Only the correct "key" can unlock the encrypted information. The 
longer the key, the harder it is to crack.  

Given the fact that it took four months to break through the standard code, 
experts say the nation's financial institutes are hardly at risk. Most of 
them use what it known as dynamic key exchange, which changes the keys almost 
constantly during a transaction. Taking months to crack the code wouldn't do 
thieves much good.  

Verser and his group were responding to a $10,000 challenge offered in 
January by RSA Data Security Inc., a Redwood City, California, company that 
sells encryption programs.  

The actual attack on the code was quite simple. Verser wrote a program that 
ran through every possible combination that might unlock the coded message -- 
72 quadrillion of them in all.  

Then he put a copy of the program on his Web site and invited others to work 
on cracking it. Anyone could download the program, which would then run in 
the background as they went about their work.  

The project began with 20 computers and ended with 14,000 working on the 
problem. All told, they used 10 million hours of computer time. Had they 
started with 14,000 computers it would have taken about 30 days, Verser said 
from his Loveland, Colorado, home.  

While the code-cracking doesn't have much practical uses, it's a harbinger of 
things to come, said David Weisman, director of money and technology 
strategies for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Forrester Research.  

"It's not something to cause a panic. But people have known that as computing 
power increases, key lengths have to increase," he said.  

The incident is likely to prompt more calls for relaxing U.S. laws that 
restrict the export of longer codes.

 Senate Votes to Outlaw Bomb-Making Info
 by Rebecca Vesely 

 12:09pm 20.Jun.97.PDT -- The Senate has voted 94-0 to tack onto a Defense 
 Department spending bill an amendment that would prohibit the distribution 
 of bomb-making instructions in the United States. 

Although the word "Internet" is not mentioned in the four-page amendment, the 
legislation would outlaw Web sites, newspapers, zines, and books that publish 
instructions on how to make a bomb - such as The Anarchist's Cookbook and The 
Terrorist Handbook. Violators would face fines and prison sentences of up to 
20 years. 

Sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-California), who has been trying to 
get the legislation on the books since 1995, the amendment passed Thursday is 
narrowly written to include only the distribution of material that has an 
"intent to harm." 

In April, the Justice Department released a study that found there indeed is 
a connection between the availability of bomb-making instructions and the 
actual making of bombs. It also concluded that legislation criminalizing the 
publication of such information, if narrowly written, would not be a 
violation of the First Amendment. The Justice Department determined that the 
distribution of such materials is not a basic free-speech right, but an 
obstruction of justice. 

The Senate will vote on the defense bill early next week. The bill - and the 
amendment - will then go to a House conference committee.

 AT&T, Baby Bell Knot "Unthinkable" 
 06/19/97
 By David Braun, TechInvestor

  WASHINGTON -- Any combination between No. 1 long-distance company AT&T and 
  a Baby Bell would be "unthinkable," Federal Communications Commission 
  chairman Reed Hundt said Thursday. 

In a speech to the Brookings Institution in Washington, Hundt, who recently 
announced his intention to resign as FCC chief, attempted to put a spoke in 
the wheels of the merger being negotiated between AT&T and SBC 
Communications.

The deal, which if approved will be the largest corporate marriage in US 
history, is expected to be announced formally within weeks. It will have to 
be cleared by federal regulators, including the FCC.

"We are at a watershed point in the evolution of the telecommunications 
industry. Whether we have competitive or monopolized markets depends on the 
interactive and complex decisions of private firms, investors, Congress, 
agencies and courts. At stake is the possibility of billions of dollars of 
economic growth and astounding feats of innovation only achievable through 
competition," Hundt said in his speech.

Combining the long distance market share of AT&T in any RBOC (regional bell 
operating company) region, even as it may be reduced by RBOC entry, with the 
long distance market share that reasonably can be imputed to the RBOC would 
yield a resulting concentration that was unthinkable, the FCC chief said.

AT&T slapped back Thursday, saying all the FCC needed to do was to evaluate 
any merger proposal, "when and if it is made," on whether or not it 
accelerates competition in all local markets.

"AT&T and the other long distance companies have documented the RBOC's 
foot-dragging with enough paper to fill an FCC hearing room," said Mark 
Rosenblum, AT&T vice president -- law and federal government affairs. "All we 
have suggested is that partnership transactions should not be an unthinkable 
way of breaking the logjam and accelerating the process of bringing real 
competition to local markets.

"If a partnership between a long distance company and a local RBOC can be 
structured to increase competition both in the RBOC's home territory and in 
the states it does not currently serve, then it ought to be considered.

"The chairman of the FCC said that if a merger between a long distance 
company and an RBOC is presented in the future, he will judge it on the law 
and the specific facts that are placed on the record. That's exactly what the 
FCC should do."

Hundt had said that in analyzing an AT&T-RBOC hypothetical merger in terms of 
the local market, "Every RBOC is, in its region, by far the dominant firm in 
the provision of in-region local exchange service. Only a tiny fraction of 
customers choose any other local service provider."

One of the best positioned entrants in the local exchange market was AT&T, 
Hundt said. "It is the largest telecommunications company in the country. It 
already has a business relationship with presumably about half the customers 
in any given Bell region. It has extensive network assets, a powerful brand, 
customer information, and sales force expertise. AT&T has already publicly 
set the goal of taking one-third market share in Bell markets.

"Indeed, it's difficult to imagine that any other firm will be a more 
effective broad-based local entrant than AT&T as long as the market-opening 
provisions of the Telecom Act are fully implemented and enforced. It seems 
unreasonable to assert that AT&T cannot obtain at least some meaningful entry 
in Bell markets if it seeks to enforce all the rights of entry given to it 
under the new law and our rules.

"Imputing to AT&T even a modest percentage of market share taken from the 
existing Bell incumbent in that Bell's region, as we must do under our 
potential or precluded competitor doctrine, then under conventional and 
serviceable antitrust analysis, a merger between it and the Bell incumbent is 
unthinkable. It would be exactly the type of horizontal combination that 
antitrust law frowns upon," he said.

Hundt said the concerns created by an AT&T-RBOC merger were not confined to 
in-region combinations. Many of the RBOCs have expressed intentions to 
compete out-of-region in long distance and, eventually, local markets. They 
could be formidable competitors of AT&T, among others, in all out-of-region 
markets. This would be particularly true if the RBOCs supported and used the 
pro-competitive rules written by the FCC.

Hundt stressed that because the Bell Atlantic-NYNEX merger was currently 
before the FCC, "I cannot and will not comment on that merger or how I think 
it should be categorized. Nothing in this speech should be read as any kind 
of communication on the topic of that merger."

Meanwhile, Lehman Brothers lowered its rating Thursday on a range of 
telephone concerns to hold from outperform: U S West Communications, SBC 
Communications, GTE, BellSouth, Bell Atlantic, and Ameritech.

The brokerage said it expected slower revenue growth in the sector.

Earlier this week, A. G. Edwards lowered its ratings on Sprint, Ameritech, 
Nynex, SBC, and U S West, due to valuation.

At market close Thursday, most of the RBOCs shares were down. Nynex [NYN] 
was off 3/8 to 58 3/8; Bell Atlantic [BEL] was down 1/2 to 76 5/8; SBC [SBC] 
added 3/8 to 60 5/8; U S West [USW] was up 3/8 to 37 5/8; Ameritech [AIT] 
slipped 5/8 to 70 3/4; and BellSouth [BLS] retreated 3/8 to 46 1/ 4.

AT&T [T] was up 3/8 to 37 7/8. Other long-distance companies were mixed. MCI 
International [MCIC] was up 1 to 39 5/8. Sprint [FON] was off 3/4 to 51 1/8.

 Hackers' Dark Side Gets Even Darker 
 06/19/97
 By Douglas Hayward, TechWire

  LONDON -- The hacker community is splitting into a series of distinct 
  cultural groups -- some of which are becoming dangerous to businesses and a 
  potential threat to national security, an official of Europe's largest 
  defense research agency warned Thursday. 

New types of malicious hackers are evolving who use other hackers to do their 
dirty work, said Alan Hood, a research scientist in the information warfare 
unit of Britain's Defense Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA). 

Two of the most dangerous types of malicious hackers are information brokers 
and meta-hackers, said Hood, whose agency develops security systems for the 
British military. Information brokers commission and pay hackers to steal 
information, then resell the information to foreign governments or business 
rivals of the target organizations.

Meta-hackers are sophisticated hackers who monitor other hackers without 
being noticed, and then exploit the vulnerabilities identified by these 
hackers they are monitoring. A sophisticate meta-hacker effectively uses 
other hackers as tools to attack networks. "Meta-hackers are one of the most 
sinister things I have run into," Hood said. "They scare the hell out of me." 

DERA is also concerned that terrorist and criminal gangs are preparing to use 
hacking techniques to neutralize military, police and security services, Hood 
said. 

Other cultural groups evolving within the hacker community include gangs 
known as elites, who form closed clubs and look down on those ordinary 
hackers who employ commonly used attack tools, Hood said. "These guys 
[elites] develop their own tools," Hood said. "They get a camaraderie and an 
appreciation of their prowess from their peers."

Another group -- known as "darksiders" -- use hacking techniques for 
financial gain or to create malicious destruction. They reject the classic 
motivation for hackers, which is to gain a feeling of achievement and 
authority, Hood said. "Hackers don't see electronic trespass as wrong per se, 
but the important thing about darksiders is that they cross the line [drawn 
by hackers] and start to be bad guys," he said. "That generally means they do 
it for gain or to cause harm." 

Users should stop believing they can build security systems capable of 
repelling any attack from hackers, Hood added. Instead, organizations should 
concentrate on minimizing the damage caused by attacks, and on deterring 
hackers.

"I don't believe you can stop every hacker forever," Hood said. "All they 
need is one new technique you haven't heard about. But what you can do is 
minimize the target, by using knowledge and resources." 

According to DERA, users should divide their anti-hacker strategies into 
deterrence, protection, detection and reaction.

Deterrence means making it so difficult for hackers that most give up and try 
another target, Hood said. Protection means more than installing firewalls 
and security software and procedures; it also means getting to know your 
system and removing all but essential content. "Everything you have on your 
system is at risk -- you should strip out anything you don't need," Hood 
said. 

"Make sure your system does what you want it to do -- no more and no less -- 
and make sure you have procedural policies to stop social engineering. If 
someone rings up and says they have forgotten their password, the person at 
the other end of the phone shouldn't automatically say OK and give them a new 
one," Hood said. Social engineering is the term used by hackers to describe 
how they obtain passwords, confidential information and credit by deception.

Users should install monitoring software, preferably with the ability to 
detect attacks in real time, and should react to everything that looks out of 
place. DERA employs 14,00 staff and has a budget of $1.5 billion. Hood's 
division, the command and information systems division, is responsible for 
secure communications and information warfare and employs more than 500 
scientists and engineers.
