  Subject: Converting strings to integers
  MIME-Version: 1.0

  When inputting values, it is easy to make a mistake and type a character
  when an integer value is expected. This happens to any data entry person.
  If the variable is an integer type, entering a non-integer value will be
  a fatal flaw.

  In most computer languages, a built-in function should take care of this.
  In turing, strint doesn't. This makes error handling very difficult, so I
  wrote a function to take care of this.

  In the true Saskatchewan tradition of socialism, solidarity of the
  workers, and general collegiality, I would like to share my function with
  you. It is attached. My only request (actually requirement) is to give
  credit where credit is due, and for no one else to attempt to make any
  financial gain on this gesture of good-will.

  convint takes an input string, and starting at the leftmost character,
  converts it into an integer until it comes across a non-digit character.
  But you can read all about it in the function header.

  I hope this makes your day.
