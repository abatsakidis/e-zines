  DEBBIE? About that night I cracked up your new BMW over a concrete
  traffic barrier on Lake Shore Drive, I'm really sorry.  What a horrible
  accident.  When I crawled out the window you were still unconscious.  I
  tried to pull you through, but your foot was stuck in the glove
  compartment.  So I went to get help.  I was less than 50 feet away when
  the gas tank exploded. Wow-Wee!  Talk about explosions!  I ran back and
  put out the fire with a wet beach blanket.  THEN YOU WERE GONE!  No
  Debbie!  Where did you go?  Are you okay?  How's your foot?  Did they
  find your left arm?  Look, I know you're a little upset.  I can
  understand that.  You have every right to be a little upset.  I can
  understand that.  But I don't think we should blow this thing up all out
  of proportion.  In fact, I don't want to see anything blow up for a long,
  long time.  So, give me a call, or drop me a line.  Let's be freinds.
  Come over and we can play records and bang on my drums.  Tell your Mom I
  said Hi.
