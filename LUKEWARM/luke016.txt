                                   Sniper
                                  --------
                        a short screenplay by Sputum




       EXT. CITY STREET -- DAY.

       A long establishing shot zooms down into a crowded downtown
       thoroughfare. Taxi cabs and buses and all ages of family sedans
       languidly sift their ways through congested traffic.
       Pedestrians of every size and color struggle through the crowds
       that line the streets. Shouts and horns and music and the
       ubiquitous hum of purring motors ricochet through the heavy
       air.

       Close-up tracking shot of a scraggly-looking woman carrying
       shopping bags.

       Turn and zoom on an old man talking to himself, slowing foot
       traffic, like a pebble in a stream.

       Back-out and track along the crowd as they make their
       individual ways as one. Crossing, dodging, walking, ignoring.

       Then suddenly something breaks the pattern. Something clatters
       onto the sidewalk, borne invisibly from some point high above
       the street. Pedestrians stop, hesitate, and stare at the
       object. It is a rifle.

       A voice rings out from high above, clearly coherent above the
       tumult.

                                SNIPER (OS)
                           Son of a BITCH!

       A few people slowly realize that the object is a gun, and,
       rather unnecessarily, panic and begin to run away. Run away
       from the gun, into other people, into the street. Screams are
       heard. The panic multiplies exponentially and suddenly the
       entire crowd is cringing away from the rifle.

       Again, heard coming from high above, comes a cry.

                                SNIPER (OS)
                           Fuck! I can't BELIEVE this
                           shit!

       A man comes forward from the crowd and emerges into the
       clearing, whose center is the mysteriously sky-fallen rifle.
       Most people have stopped screaming and now turn to look at him.
       He looks up to the sky. The sniper cannot be seen, but heard
       faintly.

                                SNIPER (OS)
                           Shit!

       The man picks up the gun, walks a few feet, and drops it into a
       garbage can. He looks around--the crowd stares back.

                                MAN
                           What!?

       The man walks away, merging with the throng. Some semblance of
       order is gradually resumed.
