                                The Fishermen

                              Once upon a time,
                         in a small town on the edge
              of a forest, there were 175 out-of-work fishermen.
                  They were out of work because there wasn't
            a body of water nearby. Then, one day, a pond appeared
          in the middle of a tree in the center of the town. But the
       only fish in the pond were poisonous. So the fishermen had work,
     but they also had many lawsuits (they were poisoning the people with
      the fish.). They all were exiled from the small town and asked to
       pay 35 cents in damages. They had barely enough to cover this as
          fish are very cheap. They all contributed what they could
           which left them only the clothes on their backs. As you
              can see, the fishermen are a collective, but they
             do not try to assimilate others into it. Five years
             later, while watching Star Trek: The Next Generation
                 they thought that assimilating would be fun,
                  so they tried it. Pretty soon, everyone in
                   the known universe were fishermen. They
                          were all out of work, too.

              The moral of this story is: Don't sue fishermen.
