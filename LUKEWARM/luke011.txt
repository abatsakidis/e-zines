  Yes, I know, most people here don't pay any attention to me... Fuck it.
  I still want to rant.  Mostly because when I'm sober, I'm never honest
  with myself.

  Yes, I'm pissed off.  My gf broke up with me today.  Of course, she's
  currently pregnant, by me.  Yay.  Fucking wonderful life.

  That's not particularly what's got me upset... Although it's the
  immediate cause, it's not the ultimate cause... I mean, seriously, how
  many times do people have to say things like "You've treated me like an
  absolute goddess, but..." and "If I were single, I'd go for you in a
  second, but..." and "You seem like exactly the type of guy I *should* go
  for, but..." and and and and... Fuck.  I'm really getting fed up with
  this.  I can't be a complete asshole, because everyone's careful to be
  really nice to me.  But it still hurts.  And with every gentle rejection,
  it hurts more.  There's no fucking reason I should be single.  There's no
  fucking reason I should be depressed.  There's no fucking reason I should
  be wandering around desperately searching for ways to avoid dealing with
  the real world.  But it all happens anyways.  I'm still single.  I'm
  still depressed.  I'm still trying to avoid real life, because it's too
  god damned much for me.  Every time I wander into what I consider the
  real world, I get burned.

  Fuck, I hate this.  The universe, as usual, is making up for a big loss
  with a bunch of small niceties... things like all the traffic lights
  going my way... None of the cars spraying me with slush... Friends
  willing (for a change) to lend me enough to get pissed... People I don't
  know being nice to me... Fuck it.  I don't want the little things.  I
  want something that matters for a fucking change.  Something that'll make
  a fucking difference in my life.  Something that'll at least make me
  think I'm worth someone's time.

  That's what it's all about, isn't it?  There's no self-validation... at
  least not for me.  I depend on other people.  And other people are
  willing to be my friend, but never anything more.  Of course.  Hell, I'm
  surprised I have friends... the universe must be slipping.  I spent gr 6
  to gr 12 without any, I don't see why it's letting me have any now.  But,
  of course, I've been a fucking idiot and told them that I'm about to post
  here.  So they're going to see this and realise what a complete imbecile
  I am, and tell me to fuck off.

  But strangely, I think that'd be nice... It'd send me into a deep enough
  apathy that nothing would matter... Someone could come up and beat the
  shit out of me, and I wouldn't care... That's what I need now.  At least
  an hour of that state of mind.  Caring hurts.  It's caused me nothing but
  pain, damnit.  The good times are outweighed so heavily I don't think I
  can think about it without crying... but I can't even cry anymore.  As a
  survival mechanism, I lost that ability years ago.  Right now, I'm
  thinking about all the pain... and all I can think is how nice it would
  be to just stop caring... to just *not* *worry* any more.  No more
  suffering, at least for me... no more pain... no more people telling me
  how wonderful I am as they're telling me they don't want to be close to
  me... No more wondering why I'm alone when everyone I know seems to be
  able to find someone without too much trouble... no more wondering how
  long it's going to take before I don't care... Sleep doesn't even help,
  because I can't sleep properly.  No matter when I go to bed, I have to
  lie awake for at least an hour before I can sleep... And in that hour, I
  have to think.  Fucking brain won't shut off.  So I think about what's
  happened in my life.  Nothing horrifying, of course, no, that'd be easy.
  Instead, just lots of little things... Nothing to break me, just lots of
  shit to grind me down.  If I could just stop caring, it wouldn't matter
  any more... I wouldn't worry about whether or not my friends were about
  to disappear... I wouldn't have to be upset that no-one cares for me
  particulary... Fuck.  Anything, now, I'd consider, if it'd just give me
  that hour of not caring. Alcohol gives me a very short time.  I need
  more.  I need at *least* an hour of not giving a shit.

  But then again, for all my ranting, no-one here cares.  In the home of
  all angst, no-one cares that I'm feeling like shit.  As usual.  You're
  all going to ignore this, as usual, and I'm going to be left feeling like
  no-one cares, because no-one does, and until I get that through my thick
  skull, I'm always going to be like this.

  All I've ever wanted is for someone to care about *me*... I can't even do
  that anymore, I have to make sure everyone else is feeling as good as I
  can help them feel.  Even if it makes me want to throw up, like today.
  Cat breaks up with me, and I tell her "Hey, you told me from the start
  that you'd look after yourself first." so she'd feel better... And here I
  am, with people only offering me sympathy niceness... Crap like I said
  above, the shit like "You've treated me like an absolute goddess, but..."
  I don't care.  Fuck it.  It's not worth it.  I don't want to deal with
  the world.  It scares me, and hurts me every chance it gets.  I'm a firm
  believer in Fate, and Fate fucking *hates* me.  The bitch.

  Shit, I've ranted too long.  Good night to all but Fate.  To Fate, FUCK
  YOU!!!!

  There comes a point in time in your life, when you get fed up and
  won't take it anymore...because it is always the same song and dance.
  What is going on, do you want to "fix" yourself for them?  What fixing
  needs to be done?  When  there are no answers, just apologies, all
  apologies and "I never meant to hurt you"....so on and so forth.

  You have to continue on...and until you really look at it, decide that
  you have had quite enough of it  you will continue along the same path
  as always, waiting for the slim chance that TheOne(tm) will come
  along, because it is like everyone else says, you are a nice guy,
  right?

  She won't.  I assure you.  Mebbe after many years of this rigamaroll
  you will settle for somebody who isn't right for you but who Loves you
  and Needs you , and mebbe it will be enough to sustain you.

  After a few drunken conversations, hearing testimony after
  testimony,from others, TheOne seems to come when you are completely
  averse to any dealings with the opposite sex.  They took the time to
  spoil themselves, have fun, not worry about what was wrong with
  themselves anymore.

  Even guys who seem to have everything absolutely everything going for
  them have experienced this, and women of course too.

  Right now you have the opportunity to develop  power, turn self pity
  into anger, get bloody angry.  Feed off of the anger and  turn it into
  power.

  Decide right now that you are going to do everything it takes to make
  *yourself* happy, you are going to spoil yourself.

   Instead of doing all those wonderful things for the women, do it for
  yourself, you treat women like Goddesses?  Why not treat yourself like
  a God?  Where would that take you?

  Decide right now that you are not going to fix yourself for anyone but
  you.  Its your world that you are living in, not theirs, live solely
  for yourself.  On your deathbed you will never be able to get into the
  heads and minds of others so start creating and collecting moments
  that make *you* joyous.

  Decide right now that you will not get involved in a relationship for
  a good while...because if you have any power or passion in you they
  will recognize it and suck it out of you and use it to go on further
  for themselves. You are too vulnerable right now.  You need to build
  and develop a muscle, a very particular muscle so that you don't give
  over to other people anymore the very essence of you.

  You need time.  You need to incubate and go slowly and develop and
  practice power.

  I remember hearing of all  things" You made me feel like a God, I
  never felt so much power and confidence"...and then he offered his
  apologies for going after the woman he had been dreaming of for
  several years....heh...I gave him the confidence for that.  seems I
  gave a lot of me to a lot of people, how nice, how very nice.

  I decided hey I gotta stop giving it away,I want a piece of that
  action for myself.  And did.

  Funny thing when you do this, everyone wants a piece of you, there is
  some elusive quality about you they want.  Power.  They want it, they
  want to be like you, they want something from you.  And it takes
  discipline not to give it away, I nearly crumbled, but then went into
  isolation again for awhile.

  Now finally, I am strong enough to be in a relationship and to give
  back to the world because I keep my reserve for myself.  I can
  actually give more now than ever before.  And I spoil myself
  throroughly.

  Chances are nobody is ever going to spell it out for you in these
  terms, it probably sounds absurd.  This is Usenet and I am anonymous,
  this is the face behind the face, and consider yourself lucky that you
  get me in  an honest moment.  Few people will get this honest.

  Power?  Yes power.  Ever see someone with power, true power?  Admire
  them?  I did.  How do you get power?  Do you get it when everything is
  going right?  Never.  You can only develop power in adversity, you
  only develop strength when the need arises. And even after that you
  need to work at maintaining it.

  Just remember its not supposed to be fun, it *is* work. Sometimes it
  is right boring.  Sometimes the only thing that kept me going is
  looking at all the slack-jawed masses --their features dissolving into
  a lazy mass of flesh without muscle.  Ugly now, after years of boredom
  and complicity etched onto their faces.  Don't believe me?  Take a
  look around at the world---they are everywhere.  Fat and heavy now
  from feeding off of others .  And lost.

  Then after awhile it gets fun, its a game matching wits against your
  most able opponent ----yourself.


  You might not like it, at least it is an honest account.

  I hope you give it a try---sooner than later.
