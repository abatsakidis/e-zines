                                    Worry
                                  --------
                                 by chlorine



       Everyone was concerned about Cylinder.

       It was a simple sub-procedure installed at the Implant, and the
  coders called it Worry. It ensured that people worried about their
  associates whenever one of them seemed to be deviating from the mean--
  whenever someone seemed a little out of sorts--whenever someone operated
  outside of acceptable parameters.

       It was very alien to them--new and undocumented. Most people that
  knew Cylinder had never before had reason to initiate an Emotion sub
  before, and likely never would again. But they did not fear it, and they
  did not feel distressed in the least. It was natural, said their
  programming.

       Slowly, as Worry kicked in, all of the people who knew Cylinder well
  enough to give a shit began approaching the super-users, (in complete
  privacy and confidentiality, of course) and expressed their concern.

       "Cylinder is acting up."

       "I think there may be something wrong with Cylinder."

       "He's been acting strange."

       "I'd hate to think his Implant might be corroding--but he has seemed
  kind of buggy, lately."

       The super-users thanked each of them and assured them that this
  problem (which was probably nothing, just a false alarm) would be looked
  into and resolved as soon as possible. Briefly put, they had no reason to
  worry about Cylinder at all.

       Assuaged, they returned to their duties and their lives. Sub-
  procedure Relief kicked in. Cylinder would be fine. They were sure of it.



       Cylinder awoke (at 08:00:00 exactly, according to his internal
  clock) with the sick feeling that his Implant was, indeed, corroding.

       First, and worst, he remembered his dreams.

       He didn't recognize them as dreams, of course: didn't know what a
  dream was in practice or theory. But latent images, cold and foreign,
  flickered and faded inside his mind. He was remembering things,
  _experiences_, that he could not remember, and certainly could not place
  into the time-line that was his life. He had the overwhelming sensation
  that he had just _been_ somewhere, but now he had returned, and could
  never go back, no matter how hard he tried.
       But the vestiges of this spurious memory quickly faltered and
  disintegrated, and he gradually calmed down.

       He ate breakfast quickly, meanwhile running self-diagnostic checks
  in the background. Everything seemed fine. He retreated to his terminal
  room and dialed-up to work without incident.

       His body fell limp against the wall as his mind interfaced
  seamlessly with imperceptible telephone networks and traversed vast
  fountains and interstices of raw data.

       Work procedures took over; calculations interlaced through his
  brain; numbers were crunched; he produced.

       But slowly, insidiously, ever slowly, thoughts coalesced in the
  background.

       This was not programmed.

       He began to feel . . . he _felt_ . . . bored.

       He disconnected quickly, too quickly: his supervisors would have
  questions. _Where did you go? What was wrong?_

       He couldn't care, not now. Something _was_ wrong. He was processing
  information that he couldn't account for, that he couldn't explain. He
  was _feeling_: feeling dissatisfied, feeling frightened, feeling
  disoriented. Although he didn't have words for any of these sensations,
  just as he had been unable to recognize the dream for what it was.

       And now the dream was coming back to him.

       Pictures, memories, sleek and unfocused, and Deborah had been there
  . . .

       He stood up, almost jumped up, and headed for the door leading out
  of his habitation cubicle.

       This was not programmed.



       He rode the elevator down seventeen floors of silence. Everyone in
  this habitation complex had the same task, the same employment, the same
  wage, the same schedule. Everyone, right now, was logged in and working.

       He got off on Deborah's floor anyway.

       She came to the door after a full minute. She looked at him,
  confused, processing all the variables, trying to discern what her next
  function-call would be, and as she looked at him . . .

       It was coming back, whatever it was. Cold, hot, hard feeling,
  accompanied by a dull pain in his stomach not unlike when he was
  processing a virus. He looked in her eyes, and at her face, and she
  looked back at him, and all he wanted to do was be near her, to touch
  her, and yet he was dreadfully frightened to do just that.

       "Cylinder, is there something . . ."

       He wasn't supposed to be feeling like this, not at all, and yet . .
  . at the same time, it was oddly exhilarating.

       " . . . Something the matter?"
       Yes. There was something the matter. But he had no words to
  explicate. She'd never understand.

       "I'm sorry, Deborah," he said, the words feeling dry and barren as
  they crawled out of his throat. "I forgot you were working."

       And he turned and left, back the way he came. Feeling stupid, inept.

       And Deborah thought: _Forgot_?



       Deborah re-interfaced, interrupting her work-stream and contacting
  her local domain's super-user immediately. Faceless, yet every face at
  once, the amorphous representation of black data (the densest kind)
  loomed abruptly in her field of vision. The voice, resonant, deep and
  dolorous, swam slowly into her aural consciousness.

       _Is there something the matter, Deborah?_

       "Yes, actually, I'm afraid there is. I'm concerned for Cylinder--his
  address is 403.24.14--"

       _We know of whom you speak. What is your concern?_

       "Just that he has been acting strangely. I wouldn't want to hazard a
  guess--perhaps such as possible minor corrosion with his Implant--but
  I--"

       _His diagnostic-checks don't indicate any problems with his
  Implant._

       "But isn't it true that when the Implant begins to corrode,
  sometimes it reports the diags incorrectly?"

       _No. Also, you should know that corrosion is a very rare occurrence
  indeed. Usually other--much more insignificant--maladies are the cause of
  any abnormal behavior._

       "Will he be . . . all right, then?"



       Cylinder looked out the window-panel, out into the city. Raspberry
  lipstick-hued clouds skimmed somnolently across the darkening horizon.
  Diminishing rays of soft orange sunlight reflected off tall photocopy-
  like depths of skyscrapers. Structures of immense height; repeating
  identical structures extending as far as vision itself; tremendous
  structures of iron and glass reproduced as if by mold.

       Habitation complexes like the one he stood in right now, stretching
  out to infinity.

       Innumerable subtle replicas trapped in cubicles of metal and
  wallpaper, enslaved by television, bi-weekly paychecks, and the tiny
  circuits implanted in their cerebrums.

       He was bordering on comprehension, complete, horrid cognizance. And
  yet his body betrayed him once more, flooding him with fear, disgust,
  disbelief, confusion.

       But fear, mostly fear. He jacked back into work before it was too
  late.
       _He'll be fine. Your associate Cylinder is quite fortunate, in fact.
  We've been monitoring him lately, and have already determined the cause
  of his problem._

       "What . . . what is it?"

       _A minor programming bug, where certain hormones are not being
  regulated properly. All we have to do now, of course, is remedy the
  situation._

       "You don't mean . . . you don't mean disposal?"

       Why did this thought bother her so? What was . . . what was wrong
  with _her_?

       _Not at all. It's simply a matter of a reformat. He'll be like new._

       They would completely erase his internal data storage. They'd delete
  everything that made him _him_--Of _course_ he'd be like new.

       "Thank you," she said, and the super-user faded away once again into
  the background, melting into the coarse mountains of crude data.

       She logged out slowly, deliberately.

       Something almost like nausea spread through her stomach. Like maybe
  she was processing a virus . . . but not quite.

       Cylinder. Reformatted. She felt . . . she _felt_ . . .

       But then a circuit in her Implant closed down, quickly, mercifully,
  and she was fine once again.

       Best to get back to work, she thought sensibly.



       Cylinder worked through a sick stomach, trying to concentrate, to
  _produce_.

       The super-users had asked him a few questions, but they were gone
  now, seemingly reassured.

       Unrecognizable colors were slowly surfacing at the edges of his
  vision. Sharp, vivid colors, encroaching . . .

       But then they were gone. And with them, the memory of the raspberry
  pink clouds he had seen not thirty seconds ago outside of his own window.
