CONTEST 
Attackers may be able to change the NetworkDoc Inc. site, but the only way 
they'll get their hands on the cash prize is if they can defeat the company's 
"anti-hacking" software and keep any changes made on the page until the end 
of a 36-hour period. It's offering to pay them 1 million yen in cash if they can do it.

http://net-security.org/text/bugs 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


[TRUSTIX SECURE LINUX] PERL AND MAILX 
We have now made availible updated perl and mailx packages that fix a local 
security hole. The hole is the same as announced by Red Hat and others earlier. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/966786899,47817,.shtml 


SOMETHING FOR WINDOWS NT/2000 ADMINISTRATORS 
While this is not WindowsNT only related list, following relates to any of us, 
because ignorancy of some webmasters running IIS (Internet Information Server) 
4.0/5.0 is somehow exceeding acceptable level. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/966786981,97960,.shtml 


RAPIDSTREAM VPN APPLIANCES ROOT COMPROMISE 
RapidStream has hard-coded the 'rsadmin' account into the sshd binary in the 
appliance OS. The account has been given a 'null' password in which password 
assignment and authentication was expected to be handled by the RapidStream 
software itself. The vendor failed to realize that arbitrary commands could be 
appended to the ssh string when connecting to the SSH server on the remote vpn. 
This in effect could lead to many things, including the ability to spawn a remote 
root shell on the vpn. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/966787075,91011,.shtml 


IRIX TELNETD VULNERABILITY 
We've found a very severe vulnerability in the IRIX telnetd service that upon 
successful exploitation can give remote root access to any IRIX 6.2-6.5.8[m,f] 
system. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/966787254,79791,.shtml 


HOTMAIL/MS INSTANT MESSENGER ISSUE 
If you use a Hotmail account to log in to Instant Messenger, and your Hotmail 
account gets cancelled, your contact (or 'buddy') list does not get cleaned. If 
another person creates a Hotmail account using that name, they will have access 
to your contact list, and will show up on any contact list you're a part of. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/966787305,704,.shtml 


[MICROSOFT] "SPECIALIZED HEADER" VULNERABILITY 
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in 
Internet Information Server that ships with Microsoft Windows 2000. Under 
certain conditions, the vulnerability could cause a web server to send the 
source code of certain types of web files to a visiting user. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/966787401,47490,.shtml 


WATCHGUARD FIREBOX AUTHENTICATION DOS 
Tested on the newest version of the Watchguard Firebox II (that was on the 
22nd of June), but it is very likely that this bug exists in all prior versions that 
include the authentication service (TCP port 4100).

OS/2 WARP 4.5 FTP SERVER DOS

by a malicious connection attempt.

A STATEFUL INSPECTION OF FIREWALL-1 
At the Black Hat Briefings 2000, we presented an analysis of Check Point 
FireWall-1 vulnerabilities resulting from protocol design flaws, problems in 
stateful inspection, common or default misconfigurations, and minor 
implementation errors discovered over the past few months in the lab, and 
verified in real-world penetration tests.

THE ART OF INFORMATION WARFARE: INSIGHT INTO THE KNOWLEDGE 
WARRIOR PHILOSOPHY 

Information is a two edged sword that can both help and hinder modern society. 
The Art of Information Warfare is the first common-sense primer on the subject 
written for those interested in or requiring a practical orientation to the threats 
and issues associated with today's Information Society from military, corporate, 
and technical perspectives. Unlike many other publications and reports on the 
subject, The Art of Information Warfare is written in plain, simple English and 
avoids sensationalizing an already "hot" topic in the media today by accurately 
presenting the facts and issues that affect everyone... not just the technoratti 
or power users.

DATABASE: PRINCIPLES, PROGRAMMING, AND PERFORMANCE, SECOND EDITION 

A standard text for database designers and programmers, Database: Principles, 
Programming, and Performance is out in a new edition. This latest version of the 
detailed work of the O'Neils includes a new chapter on Object-Relational SQL 
and its implementations in Oracle and Informix products. On top of that, the 
authors have revised their chapters on basic and advanced SQL, and added 
product-specific details (particularly having to do with Oracle, Informix, and I 
BM DB2 database products) to most areas of their coverage. As a result of 
these revisions, this book does a great job of balancing academic material 
with practical examples.

WINDOWS 2000 ACTIVE DIRECTORY 

A typical section has to do with Replication Monitor, a diagnostic and observation 
program that's part of the Windows 2000 Resource Kit. In this section, the 
author first provides a quick statement of where Replication Monitor is and what 
it does, then gives steps for using it. The author then goes through options - 
synchronizing with a replication partner, checking Update Sequence Number 
(USN), and so on - before listing a replication log and commenting a bit on it. 
He repeats the strategy for scores of other features, capabilities, and utilities, 
the result being a detailed document that assumes little on the part of the 
reader. Topics covered: An overview of Active Directory's purpose and 
architecture, followed by detailed guides to each of its features and capabilities. 
Coverage deals with replication, security, users and groups, and systems 
administration issues, such as installation.

WINDOWS 2000 MAC SUPPORT LITTLE BLACK BOOK 

When Windows people write about networking their computers, they often 
forget the Macintosh entirely or relegate Mac connectivity to an afterthought 
chapter. Not only is Windows 2000 Mac Support Little Black Book dedicated to 
the issue of interoperability between Windows and the Mac, but it addresses 
the connectivity problem from both ends of the wire. Gene Steinberg and Pieter 
Paulson go into detail on what needs to be done to your Macs, as well as your 
Windows NT 4 and Windows 2000 boxes, in order to bring about file sharing, 
printer sharing, cross-platform database access, and application sharing. It's a 
complete and carefully researched statement of configuration strategies, and 
perfect for advertising houses, Web development shops, and other environments 
in which large parts of the staff use the Mac.

WINDOWS NT/2000 THIN CLIENT SOLUTIONS: IMPLEMENTING TERMINAL 
SERVICES AND CITRIX METAFRAME 

Windows NT, Terminal Server Edition is an extension to NT Server that allows 
applications to run one centralized location while being presented on multiple 
client devices. Designed to decrease total cost of ownership, when used in 
conjunction with Citrix's MetaFrame product. TSE has also resulted in dramatic 
(500% or more) performance increase in standard NT administration tools and 
some database applications. A new edition is necessary to document this new 
functionality, and also the challenges that system architects will have to address 
as they design their W2K networks and then transition from Windows NT to W2K. 
This edition follows the organization of the previous edition, but includes changes 
to discussions affected by W2K's release, including coverage of scalability and 
security.
