NMAPNT FROM EEYE DIGITAL SECURITY 
"nmap has various options to perform stealth scans, ping scans, UDP 
scans, as well as a whole handful of other scan types. nmap also has 
the ability to remotely fingerprint an IP address. Basically what that 
means is by sending various queries to a remote IP address, and reading 
the responses, nmap can determine if the remote IP address is running 
a certain operating system or maybe it is a router or network printer. 
Infact, nmap's datebase of fingerprints has over 500 unique finger prints 
in it."

Security issues 
--------------- 

All vulnerabilities are located at: 
http://net-security.org/text/bugs 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

EXCEL 2000 VULNERABILITY - EXECUTING PROGRAMS 
Excel 2000/Windows 98 (suppose other versions are also vulnerable, have not 
tested) allows executing programs when opening an Excel Workbook (.xls file). 
This may be also be exploited thru IE or Outlook. This may lead to taking full 
control over user's computer. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/963357077,83705,.shtml 


APACHE::ASP HOLE FIXED 
Apache::ASP had a security hole in its ./site/eg/source.asp distribution 
examples file, allowing a malicious hacker to potentially write to files in the 
directory local to the source.asp example script. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/963357248,90975,.shtml 


BIG BROTHER VULNERABILITY 
The problem exists in the code where $HOSTSVC does not do authenticity 
checking for its assigned variable. All files could be snatched just with a browser. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/963357356,65475,.shtml 


NETSCAPE ADMINISTRATION SERVER PASSWORD DISCLOSURE 
The administration server is installed when you first install SuiteSpot server. 
For remote logon, it authenticates by validating the password prompt input 
with the administration server password file. This password file is kept in 
a local directory within the SuiteSpot server. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/963135822,65666,.shtml 


FEARTECH FTP BROWSER PROBLEM 
FTP Browser allows you to display a html enhanced directory listing, which 
is great for managing your ftp files. FTP Browser can also be used for 
downloading password files. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/963578519,23215,.shtml 


"ABSENT DIRECTORY BROWSER ARGUMENT" PROBLEM PATCHED 
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates two security vulnerabilities 
in Microsoft Internet Information Server. In sum, the vulnerabilities could 
allow a malicious user to stop the web server from providing useful service, 
or to extract certain types of information from it. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/963664473,69872,.shtml 


"THE IE SCRIPT" VULNERABILITY PATCHED 
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability 
in Microsoft Office 2000 (Excel and PowerPoint) and in PowerPoint 97. 
Microsoft has also documented a workaround that prevents the use of 
Microsoft Access to exploit a vulnerability in Internet Explorer. A patch 
for the latter vulnerability will be available soon and we will have an 
update to this bulletin. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/963664619,71371,.shtml 


[MANDRAKE] CVSWEB UPDATE 
Cvsweb contains a hole that provides attackers who have write access 
to a cvs repository with shell access. Thus, attackers who have write 
access to a cvs repository but not shell access can obtain a shell. In 
addition, anyone with write access to a cvs repository that is viewable 
with cvsweb can get access to whatever user the cvsweb cgi script 
runs as (typically nobody or www-data, etc.). This update closes all 
of these possibly exploited pipe-opens.

computer networks across geographic space. The book focuses on the OSI 
reference model, the TCP/IP stack, the basics of using Cisco IOS, and the 
details of implementing various network and routing protocols in the Cisco 
environment. It also addresses the Inter-Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP)

LINUX NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE 

Olaf Kirch wrote Linux Network Administrator's Guide as part of the Linux 
Documentation Project to cover just such information. Although you can 
download the book for free, the O'Reilly version of the book looks (better layout 
and graphics) and feels better than the online version and has a superlative 
index. This book details the tasks associated with e-mail setup and maintenance, 
news group setup, and essential network applications such as rcp and rlogin. In 
some cases you may find the level of detail not sufficient to complete the task. 
In those cases, Kirch tells you where to find more detailed information on the 
Internet. This methodology has kept the book to a very handy size, which makes 
it an easy-to-use, versatile resource for anyone managing a Linux network.

security measures, configure mail services, troubleshoot, and perform other vital 
administrative tasks.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

RED HAT LINUX NETWORK MANAGEMENT TOOLS 

The book looks at the considerable networking capabilities of Linux 2.2.x from 
the perspective of a network administrator responsible for fitting the operating 
system into a large, heterogeneous computer network. Despite the title of the 
book, it doesn't limit itself to Red Hat Linux. The book is also careful to explain 
key networking technologies such as the TCP/IP protocol stack and Simple 
Network Management Protocol. The book approaches network-management 
matters one at a time with Linux tools. In explaining Ethernet monitoring, for 
example, the text introduces the tcpdump and ethereal tools, and then 
explains their functions.

programs, are covered in this thick volume. Each one is given the same highly 
effective treatment of illustrative screen shots and commands, which should

tips about specific functions and utilities, such as the which and whereis that 
are used to help located commands and files, throughout the chapters. For 
greater detail on specific utilities, the book includes a massive section devoted 
exclusively to the utilities within Solaris.
