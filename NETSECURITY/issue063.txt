E-COMMERCE FIRMS FACING MORE ONLINE SECURITY RISKS
Online security can pose a threat to the IT industry world over. According to 
the managing director of Safe Acript Atul Saran, the industry suffered losses 
to the tune of $10 billion during the last two years. Speaking at a seminar - 
Consilience-2000 - organised by the National Law School of India University 
here on Sunday, he said the companies could cut down on problems by 
taking precautionary measures.

A CRITIQUE OF MEDIA REPORTAGE OF VIRUSES
In this article, George Smith takes a critical look at the way the media reports 
viruses. Specifically, he critiques the shortcomings of the 'crisis' mode used by 
the media to report virus threats and virus-writing competitions and examines 
the effects of that school of reportage on the public's reaction to viruses.

HACKERS DENIED ACCESS
Access Research, a security firm founded earlier this year, has unveiled its 
security products to protect corporate data. Access Denied is a strong 
authentication system, preventing unauthorised users from connecting to 
company servers. It protects firms from hackers' spoofing, denial of service 
and Trojan attacks at the IP level, safeguarding Web servers and clients, the 
company said. The technology scans traffic at the TCP/IP connection level, 
alongside other security features, such as firewalls, and controls communication 
channels between Web servers and clients.

NT SERVICE PACK 7: D.O.A.
SP7 is now officially dead. This is unfortunate, since it makes fixing all the 
security holes present on an NT system more difficult. For day-to-day 
operations, the lack of service packs won't make a huge difference. In the 
last few years, Microsoft has only released six service packs for NT (not 
counting multiple releases of Service Pack 6 that were broken to various 
degrees). Administrators typically apply Microsoft's hotfixes as they become 
available; otherwise, it is trivial in most cases for attackers to break into 
unpatched systems.

WORMS COME UNDER ATTACK
When the ILoveYou virus swept through corporate networks around the 
world last May, it took everyone by surprise - especially anti-virus software 
developers. As the one-year anniversary of the Love Bug's attack passed 
last week, McAfee Corp., Trend Micro Inc. and other anti-virus vendors 
were working on new technologies and strategies that they hope will 
reduce the likelihood of another outbreak of that scale.

NEO-NAZIS ATTACK LIBRARY'S WEB SITE 
The State Library of NSW was inundated with calls after an attacker replaced 
its Web site with images of Hitler and a Nazi swastika across an Australian flag 
in an unprecedented racially motivated attack.

EXODUS CUSTOMER SECURITY SITE HACKED
Internet hosting company Exodus Communications suffered an embarrassing 
break-in of one of its security-related Web sites Friday night. Hackers left a 
message bragging that they had access to the company’s network and posted 
personal information about a company employee on www.security.exodus.net. 
Exodus, which co-hosts big-name Web sites like Yahoo.com and eBay.com, 
confirmed the break-in. But company officials say the attackers were only 
able to access arcane Web server log files for a few Exodus customers.

THE NEW SECURITY PRO
"The really bad security breaches that would make the hair on the back of 
your neck stand up are not being reported [in the media]," says David Foote, 
a managing partner at Foote Partners LLC, a New Canaan, Conn.-based 
research and consulting firm specializing in the IT workforce. "But companies 
know about them, and they're scared." As companies place an increased 
emphasis on security, says Foote, the role of the security professional is 
changing from a strictly back-office IT support role to one that's strategically 
tied in with the entire company.

2600 CLUBS
The Washington Post's Ariana Eunjung Cha did an article on 2600 clubs 
around the states. "Club members still draw the attention of authorities. 
But the perception that their meetings are solely a place where hackers 
exchange trade secrets and plot electronic break-ins is exaggerated, or 
at least outdated".

HACKERS BREAK INTO INFOSYS’ BANKING SITE
Hackers reached IT major Infosys, with unidentified miscreants breaking in into 
the company’s banking division website. According to an Infosys spokesperson, 
the company’s technical personnel were attempting to rectify the damage and 
restore the site. "Work is on at present and the site should be up soon," the 
spokesperson said. The hackers changed the content of the site though it is 
not clear how and why the break in occurred.

STREAMER.MICROSOFT.COM HACKED
According to Alldas.de, a Web server located within Microsoft's .com domain at 
streamer.microsoft.com was cracked and defaced in the early hours of Tuesday 
morning by a computer crackers calling themselves Prime Suspectz. Just last 
Friday, the same group, which claims to be based in Brazil, vandalised three 
international Microsoft Web sites, Microsoft UK, Mexico and Saudi Arabia.

HACKER ATTACKS UTV SITE
UTV are investigating how an attacker managed to link the front page of their 
web site to a commemoration site for hunger-striker Bobby Sands last weekend. 
According to UTV, the attacker changed a link early Saturday morning, May 5th. 
The problem was rectified within hours of being spotted.

IIS ATTACKING WORM OUT THERE
CERT issued an advisory on a new piece of self-propagating malicious code. 
Based on preliminary analysis, the sadmind/IIS worm exploits a vulnerability in 
Solaris systems and subsequently installs software to attack Microsoft IIS web 
servers. In addition, it includes a component to propagate itself automatically 
to other vulnerable Solaris systems. It will add "+ +" to the .rhosts file in the 
root user's home directory. Finally, it will modify the index.html on the host 
Solaris system after compromising 2,000 IIS systems.

WHY OPENBSD WILL NEVER BE AS SECURE AS LINUX
OpenBSD fans everywhere simultaneously draw their flame guns and set them 
to "well done". OpenBSD claims to be "secure by default", and has undergone 
an extensive code audit -- so the question is this: has Kurt been hit in the 
head with a blunt object, or what? Wait! Before you hit the send button and 
put me out of my ignorance-induced misery, please read the whole article. 
Your thoughts will probably be addressed.

WHITEHAT HACKER MADE FBI PATSY
American federal officials used threats and a false promise of leniency to lure 
computer security researcher and admitted cyber intruder Max Butler into 
becoming an undercover FBI informant, according to a defense motion filed 
in the case Tuesday. It was only when Butler balked at covertly recording a 
friend and colleague, and instead sought advice from an attorney, that the 
government threw the book at him, the motion charges. "The government as 
much as promised him he would receive consideration," says defense attorney 
Jennifer Granick. "At least until he hired an attorney."

AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT HIT BY VBSWG.X
VBSWG.X has hit the Australian parliament's e-mail system opening a selection 
of pornographic websites on its victims' screens. International research company
Trend Micro says the virus was first detected in the US and has spread to more
than 50 Australian businesses. At least 2,500 cases of the virus have also been 
recorded in New Zealand.

AN INTRODUCTION TO NESSUS
"There are a number of security scanners out there. Most of them are vendor 
specific, and each boasts a number of vulnerability checks to determine what 
is secure on your system and what is not. So what if you are a hardcore open 
source paranoid like myself who wouldn't think to spend a dime on the latest 
commercial security scanner from CyberSlueths or CrackerCops? Well there is 
a superior alternative that is regularly updated, free, and open source. It's 
called Nessus, and it is by far the best scanner available."

BALTIMORE WILL FIRE 10% OF STAFF?
Baltimore Technologies Plc, a security software maker that issued two lowered 
profit forecasts this year, may fire as many as 120 workers or about 10 percent 
of its staff, the Irish Independent newspaper said, citing analysts.

VBSWG.X UPDATE
A spokesman for the antiviral software company Sophos said that 80 companies 
have reported being hit by the virus, and several said that they have each sent 
out up to 100,000 infected e-mails. Another antiviral firm, MessageLabs, reports 
similar statistics, adding that its data indicates Homepage is spreading faster 
than the Kournikova virus.

DUMMY INTERNET FIRM USED TO SNAG RUSSIAN HACKERS
Invita Security Corp. looked like a typical Internet company: It had offices, 
computers, employees, even a secure computer system. The only thing 
missing was the customers. Far from a failed start-up, the aptly named 
Invita turned out to be a bogus company set up by the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation to ensnare a pair of young Russian hackers accused of 
breaking into U.S. Internet companies' computers, stealing financial and 
other sensitive data and demanding extortion payments. Authorities say 
Alexey Ivanov, 21, and Vasily Gorshkov, 25, both of Chelyabinsk, fell for 
the bait. Arrested and jailed on 20 criminal counts including conspiracy 
and wire fraud, they are set to go on trial May 29 in federal court in Seattle.

WINDOWS VS. LINUX - TAKING SECURITY SERIOUSLY
Network security cannot be left to chance these days. It is incumbent on 
businesses, given the throng of Internet connections across the globe, that 
their systems - no matter what types of operating systems or servers involved, 
are patched, hardened and secure. Then again, if it is up to individual 
organisations to protect what they have, perhaps the role of OS vendors is to 
strengthen the security features they offer. Just which vendor does this better
is difficult to establish. While proponents of Linux systems maintain that the 
many security vulnerabilities and attacks coming to the fore are due to 
Microsoft's dominance in the market and its inherent vulnerabilities, others 
believe that Bill Gates' behemoth company is beginning to hold its own in 
acknowledging and addressing security issues. With fame, however, 
misfortune can follow.

USING SENDMAIL AND AMAVIS TO HALT VIRUS DISTRIBUTION
Unlike days past where viruses were primarily spread through sneaker-net 
distribution of floppy disks, most modern viruses are spread via e-mail. 
Advanced scripting languages for the Windows platform coupled with the 
relative insecurity of certain Windows mail clients have increased the ranks 
of the virus, worm, and other mal-ware authors. Fortunately, most Unix 
servers and mail systems can halt the spread of such mal-ware. This tutorial 
will focus on integrating the AMaViS (0.2.1) anti-virus cleanser with Sendmail 
8.9.1b, the default mail server shipped with Solaris 7. However, the setup and 
configuration procedures are very similar on Linux and xBSD.

SECURING LINUX WITH AIDE
It is often difficult to assess damage from an intrusion through syslogs and good 
old-fashioned sysadmin work alone. Host-based intrusion detection systems can 
assist in these efforts. One such host-based IDS for Unix operating systems is 
AIDE. AIDE is a valuable, configurable tool that takes a snapshot of a system 
in its original state in order to track subsequent changes in the system. This 
article will discuss various aspects of using AIDE on Linux systems, including: 
configuring and using AIDE, troubleshooting your configuration, reviewing logs 
and cleaning up rulesets.

MAC: RIPE FOR A HACK?
"Think Different" has been an Apple rallying cry for the last few years. And 
recently, many Mac fans have begun to think different(ly) - about computer 
security. Macs have rarely been the target of hack attacks or viruses, due 
in part to the fact that many malicious hackers are unfamiliar with the Mac 
operating system. But Apple's new operating system, OS X, is built around 
an open-source, Unix-based core - an operating system that many hackers 
are already very familiar with.

INFOSYS TRACKING ATTACKERS
India's top software firm Infosys Technologies said Tuesday it has tracked down 
the origin of computer hackers who targeted its website on Monday. "The attack

GATEWAY UK TURNS PERSONAL INFO PUBLIC
A security gaffe by Gateway 2000 has resulted in the exposure of sensitive

Excel spreadsheet containing order details, customer contacts and phone 
numbers.

DMZS FOR DUMMIES
You've ordered a new firewall, and you want to get it running on your network 
ASAP. Your first reaction is probably to put every client and server behind it. 
That's fine for a small company, but a larger company should consider creating 
a perimeter security network called a demilitarized zone (DMZ) that separates 
the internal network from the outside world.

ANOTHER HOTMAIL SCAM
"You're one of 100 hotmail winners!" reads the title from an email apparently

a "max@relay.1c.kiev.ua" and over html code directly links to http://193.125.79.67/,

PROTOCOL TO SECURE DATA FOR WLANS
Industry experts are tipping Kerberos to become the accepted security standard 
for roaming between access points in the growing wireless local area network 
(WLAN) market. Concerns about the rival Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP) 
security protocol used in the 802.11b WLAN standard have surfaced recently, 
putting IT managers off adopting the technology, due to fears about the 
security of connections and the verification of users as they 'roam' from 
one access point to another.
