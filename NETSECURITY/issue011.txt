Net-Sec mini letter 
Issue 11 - 05.05.2000 
http://net-security.org 


Yes, yet one update on the Love Letter situation... This time Slider contributes that Scottish Power (UK based) has shut down SMTP and internet access, the House of commons in London, England has been hit, and a few other companies are closing SMTP Gateways, and stepping up alerts. 

We got lot of e-mails about how to delete Love Letter virus. As all AV vendors are HTTP 1.1/ too busy, the article sent by Curt Bryson from Computer Forensics/Internet Investigations Consultant (http://www.forensics-intl.com) is valuable as pure gold :) Thanks to Curt and all the people from the HNSmailing list for contributing.
