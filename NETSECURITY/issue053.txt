ONE-STOP SECURITY?
IT managers looking for one-stop security shopping may soon have more 
superstores to visit. But whether that will mean a more secure enterprise 
is uncertain. The one-stop security shop is not a new strategy, nor a 
proven one. Network Associates Inc. went on a vigorous two-year acquisition 
spree to offer customers soup-to-nuts security only to scrap the plan last year. 
This time, Vigilinx Inc., a New York-based security consultancy, is giving it a try. 
Last week, it acquired its second company of this year, LogiKeep Inc., for its 
security assessment software. Last month, the company acquired IF SEC, 
another security consulting company, and it has at least one more acquisition 
pending, officials said.

MR LEGOLAND WINDSOR BANGED UP
An Internet fraudster was jailed for a year today after wangling credit card 
details out of surfers by starting bogus sites under the names of famous 
companies. Craig Cottrell, also known by the name of Legoland Windsor, 
received the sentence after Marks & Spencer took matters into its own 
hands and marched him to the High Court.

INFORMATION DISCOVERY BASICS AND PLANNING
This is the seventh installment in SecurityFocus.com's Field Guide for 
Investigating Computer Crime. The previous installment in this series, 
"Search and Seizure, Evidence Retrieval and Processing", concluded the 
overview of search and seizure with a discussion of the retrieval and 
processing of computer crime scene evidence. In this installment, we 
will begin our discussion of information discovery, the process of viewing 
log files, databases, and other data sources on un-seized equipment, in 
order to find and analyze information that may be of importance to a 
computer crime investigation.

GOVERNMENT E-SECURITY MEASURES INADEQUATE
The Government's attempt to fight hackers through the latest anti-terrorism 
legislation is flawed, according to legal and network security experts. Critics 
claim that the legislation covers attacks on utilities and hospitals, but has no 
provision for the prosecution of a cyber terrorist who attacks a bank or business.

IS HACKER CULTURE A HELP OR HINDRANCE?
Everyone knows there's a hacker culture among Linux users. On the whole it's a 
good thing. However, there are times when it is counterproductive. While many 
Linux users get by without ever writing a line of code, it's fair to say that, 
compared with other operating systems, programming plays a much more 
important role. Before going further, let's be absolutely clear about definitions. 
Hackers are the clever, possibly mad, yet strangely dedicated people who stay 
up all night stringing bits of code together. Hacking is about getting noughts 
and ones to dance and sing. Hacking should not be confused with digital 
vandalism or other illegal acts - that's something else altogether. Linux 
could not exist without hackers."

SPACE-SEEKING HACKER TAKES FILES
A Web surfer in Sweden got into an unprotected Indiana University computer, 
removing more than 3,000 student names and identification numbers while 
leaving behind a cache of downloaded music files. University officials believe 
the student data was taken by accident, since the person was looking for 
computer space to store the MP3 files.

A SHOT IN THE ARM FOR NET VIRUS FIGHTERS
The scientists analyzed the statistical incidence of more than 800 computer 
viruses and found that they lived much longer than current theories predicted 
- in some cases up to three years. Because "vaccines" for most viruses are 
usually available within hours or days, the network theoretically should be 
totally protected within weeks. But that's not what actually happens. PC 
viruses continue to infect a small but persistent percentage of computers.

MAGIC NUMBERS AND RSA DON'T MIX!
A recent item on the Bugtraq mailing list, which advises people of security flaws 
in popular software, has warned of a flaw in the way earlier versions of the SSH 
protocol use RSA for encryption.

SRP: PART DEUX
"It's been over a year since I spoke to Tom Wu about SRP. In that time it would 
appear he's been hard at work, like a beaver on crystal meth, and it's starting 
to pay off. SRP still has a long trip ahead of it, however. For a protocol to gain 
wide acceptance there need to be many implementations and available software 
packages that support it. Of course that usually doesn't happen until it's widely 
accepted. Hopefully in the near future we'll see more vendors shipping SRP 
support in telnet and so on."

TREK 2000 THUMBDRIVE SECURE REVIEW
Radeonic has posted a review of the aptly named Trek 2000 Thumbdrive Secure
storage device which is pretty tiny and can store anywhere from 8 to 512MB 
with USB connectivity.

ACTIVISTS TARGET BANK'S WEB SITE
Hacktivists have targeted the Web site of a US investment bank which saved 
a controversial drug testing company from liquidation with an attack designed 
to make its site unavailable. The Web site of investment bank Stephens, which 
provides finance for Huntingdon Life Sciences, was yesterday subject to an 
attempted "virtual sit-in" by cyberactivists using a tool called Floodnet.

TOO MUCH SECURITY IS HOLDING BACK ECOMMERCE
Evidian, a subsidiary of Groupe Bull, has completed a survey of 40 blue chip 
companies and found that two in five of them think complicated security is 
"the most irritating aspect of conducting business online". Multiple password 
entry and excessive authorisation procedures were recorded as particular 
irritants to respondents to Evidian's survey, ahead in annoyance of factors 
like downtime and poor customer service in doing business online.

VIRUS PROTECTION FOR SMALL ENTERPRISES
With the recent proliferation of .VBS exploits, virus protection for small 
enterprises has become increasingly important. After a recent outbreak of the 
VBS.plan virus at his company, SecurityFocus writer Chris Jackson conducted 
a review of his organization's procedures in order to assess their network's 
security against viruses. This article represents an analysis of a virus outbreak 
at the firm, including a breakdown of how the outbreak occurred, what 
conditions facilitated the outbreak, and what could have been done to protect 
the firm against outbreak. It is hoped that this analysis will provide some insight 
into what other small to medium sized enterprises can do to avoid a similar 
incident.

ANTICRYPTOGRAPHY
Ever since Mosaic, the computer industry has been obsessed with cryptography. 
The crusade to put strong encryption technology in the hands of ordinary 
computer users is a noble and important cause. Yet in our obsession with 
encryption and electronic anonymity, we've overlooked something equally 
important, the idea of creating complex messages that decode themselves. 
Anticryptography is based on the idea of making a message that decodes 
itself. The goal in anticryptography is to create a message that can be easily 
deciphered, even by somebody (or something) who has no prior knowledge of 
how the message is composed or what information it contains.

UPDATING A BSD/OS SYSTEM WITH MODS
BSDi's BSD/OS has an easy-to-use system for updating a system with important 
fixes. It is especially useful for administrators who do not want to (or can not) 
compile the entire system. In addition, the BSD/OS patches are able to back 
out to undo changes.

NETWORK MONITORING, ACCESS CONTROL, AND BOOBY TRAPS
TCP Wrappers is one of the most common methods of access control on your 
Unix box. A wrapper program 'wraps' around existing daemons and interfaces 
between clients and the server. Good access control and logging are strong 
points. In this first part, we introduce you to the concept behind TCP 
Wrappers.

ZEN AND THE ART OF BREAKING SECURITY - PART I
Designing a secure solution, be it a protocol, algorithm or enterprise architecture, 
is far from trivial. Apart from the technical or scientific difficulties to overcome, 
there is a mental trap easy to fall into: looking at the picture through the eyes 
of the designer. The designer often works with concepts, not with the real thing. 
We look at an algorithm's specifications and we mistake it for its implementation 
in a particular program. We read several RFCs and we say, this is TCP/IP.

NETWORK MANAGERS RAPPED OVER LAX SECURITY
Network managers have been ignoring warnings to download a Microsoft security 
patch and have been hammered by attackers over the last few weeks as a result. 
Intel, Hewlett Packard, Compaq, Gateway and the New York Times were all 
attacked because they used unpatched versions of Netscape Enterprise 
Server or Microsoft IIS.

PRIVACY AT WORK? BE SERIOUS
If you feel your privacy at work has been eroding lately, it's probably more than 
just your imagination. Experts say companies are under increasing pressure to 
monitor employees electronically, and workers should assume they are being 
watched. Concerns about liability in harassment suits, skyrocketing losses from 
employee theft, and productivity losses from employees shopping or peeping at 
porn from their cubicles have led to an explosion in the number of companies 
conducting some form of electronic monitoring on their employees.

SAN SECURITY ARCHITECTURES
Security within the monitoring and management of storage and storage area 
network devices is still evolving and still somewhat limited. Progress is being 
made and it would be advantageous to emulate current security practices 
incorporated within the LAN/WAN arenas. Until then, storage managers 
should use every and any available method to carefully defend their devices.

SEC ATTACKS ONLINE SCAMMERS
Federal securities regulators have taken action against con artists who used 
Internet and e-mail campaigns to perpetrate some rather old-fashioned 
investment scams. On Thursday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
filed charges against 23 companies and individuals who used spam e-mails, 
phony Internet press releases, fallacious message board postings and other 
online means to pump up stock prices and defraud investors.

TRUSTIX SECURE LINUX 1.2 [REVIEW]
Trustix Secure Linux is a distribution that has one focus and one focus only - 
to provide a server distribution that is secure. There are no frills with this 
distribution. When you install Trustix, you very quickly realize that you are 
on the business end of the server. There is no GUI, nor are there any real 
configuration tools. What you get is very close to a traditional UNIX server.

ARE U.S. AGENCIES HACKER-PROOF?
A congressional subcommittee asked 15 federal agencies Friday to report how 
they've been testing and securing their computer systems from outside attack. 
Under a federal law passed last year, agencies have to do their own security 
testing and hire an outside auditor to do "penetration testing," in which hackers 
are paid to try to break into a network. Its passage came amid a flurry of 
reports that federal computers were open to devastating attacks.

STUDY: DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM SECURITY STILL LAX
Companies rushed to upgrade Domain Name System software after warnings 
were issued in late January about a flaw in widely used DNS software. In the 
past weeks, however, upgrading has come to a halt, concludes the Iceland 
DNS consultancy and software firm Men & Mice. Men & Mice tested the DNS 
systems for the Web sites of Fortune 1000 companies and random, .com 
domains at set dates after the alerts were released. The results were made 
public on the company's site. The CERT at Carnegie Mellon University, 
meanwhile, said this week that it has begun receiving reports of Berkeley 
Internet Name Domain (BIND) holes being successfully exploited.

12 KEYS FOR LOCKING UP TIGHT
In a perfect world, a bit of common sense and a dash of due diligence would 
protect us from hackers, saboteurs and the common cold. Well, the world isn't 
perfect, and we know we can never be completely secure. There is a measure 
of safety to be gained by following a formula of threat education, security 
breach prevention and risk mitigation. "There's no single answer," says Bruce 
Schneier, CTO of security consultancy Counterpane Internet Security. "I can't 
say, 'Do these seven steps and you'll be magically secure.'" Although every 
organization's security infrastructure must be unique to be effective, Schneier 
and other experts point to the following essential ingredients. Pay close 
attention to these basic security issues.

MICROSOFT MAY DISABLE UPGRADED PCS
Users who upgrade their PCs may find they will not work when switched back 
on, under the software giant's plan to use an artificial intelligence engine to 
deactivate illegal copies of Windows XP. Microsoft's Windows XP will control 
how many times users can reinstall the operating system by using an artificial 
intelligence engine, similar to those used to monitor credit card transactions, 
it emerged this week.

LINUX MANDRAKE - ZOPE UPDATE
A new Hotfix for Zope has been released that fixes a very important 
security issue that affects all versions of Zope prior to and including 
2.3.1b1. Users can use through-the-web scripting capabilities on a 
Zope site to view and assign class attributes to ZClasses, possibly 
allowing them to make inappropriate changes to ZClass instances. As 
well, perceived security problems with the ObjectManager, Property
Manager and PropertySheet classes have been fixed as well. It is 
highly recommended that all Linux-Mandrake users using Zope 
upgrade to these new packages immediately.

ORANGE WEB SERVER V2.1 DOS
Orange Web Server v2.1 is vulnerable to a very simple Denial of Service attack 
where its possible to cause the server to shut down at once and cause a 
invalid page fault.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/983368813,42791,.shtml


A1 SERVER V1.0A HTTPD VULNERABILITIES
A1 Server v1.0a is vulnerable to a nasty Denial of Service attack where it can 
be flooded with useless junk until the server crashes promptly. Once it has 
been crashed it needs to be restarted again for it to work properly. All 
windows versions apear to be affected.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/983368906,39469,.shtml


JOE'S OWN EDITOR FILE HANDLING ERROR
joe looks for its configuration file in ./.joerc (CWD), $HOME/.joerc, and 
/usr/local/lib/joerc in that order. Users could be tricked into execute 
commands if they open/edit a file with joe in a directory where other 
users can write.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/983410681,78639,.shtml


SLACKWARE HAS UPDATED IMAPD
A remote exploit exists for the previously included version of imapd, so all sites 
running imapd are urged to upgrade to the new version immediately. Note that 
imapd has been installed to run by default in previous versions of Slackware, 
including 7.1.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/983411116,25599,.shtml


SURGEFTP DENIAL OF SERVICE
Due to a design issue in the SurgeFTP server a denial of service condition 
exists in it which could allow any user with local or shell access to the host 
to crash the server. The problem resides in the local handling of the directory 
listing command, which after first being successfully initialized will die if 
followed by a "malformed" request.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/983590606,62264,.shtml


VULNERABILITY IN TYPSOFT FTP SERVER
A vulnerability exists which allows a remote attacker to break out of the ftp 
root using relative paths (ie: '...').

VULNERABILITY IN FTPXQ SERVER
A vulnerability exists which allows an attacker to download files outside 
the ftp root.

VULNERABILITY IN SLIMSERVE FTPD
A vulnerability exists which allows an attacker to break out of the ftp root using 
relative paths (ie: '...').
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/983590732,23207,.shtml


CALDERA - BUFFER OVERFLOW IN /BIN/MAIL
There is a buffer overflow in /bin/mail which allows a local attacker to read, 
modify and delete mails of other users on the system.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/983591002,3815,.shtml


RED HAT LINUX - UPDATED JOE PACKAGES
When starting, joe looks for a configuration file in the current working directory, 
the user's home directory, and /etc/joe. A malicious user could create a .joerc 
file in a world writable directory such as /tmp and make users running joe inside 
that directory using a .joerc file that is customized to execute commands with 
their own userids. The current working directory has been removed from the list 
of possible directories with the .joerc configuration file.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/983591090,68864,.shtml


WINZIP32 ZIPANDEMAIL BUFFER OVERFLOW
The /zipandemail option in winzip contains a buffer overflow flaw when handling 
very long filenames. The EIP is overwritten and a carefully crafted filename 
could allow for execution of arbitrary code. The probability of this happening 
"in the wild" is very low, as the overflow only triggers if winzip is used with 
this option. Theoretically, this could occur when a .jpg with a malformed 
filename is 'zipped and emailed'. Alternatively if an attacker managed to place 
a malicious file in the log directory on an automated logging system´ then the 
automated zipping and emailing of the log would trigger the overflow.

SSH, THE SECURE SHELL: THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE

Secure your computer network with SSH! With transparent, strong encryption, 
reliable public-key authentication, and a highly configurable client/server 
architecture, SSH (Secure Shell) is a popular, robust, TCP/IP-based solution 
to many network security and privacy concerns. It supports secure remote 
logins, secure file transfer between computers, and a unique "tunneling" 
capability that adds encryption to otherwise insecure network applications. 
Best of all, SSH is free, with feature-filled commercial versions available as 
well. "Our book is written for all SSH users, from technically-inclined beginners 
up to experienced sysadmins. We begin with the basics for Unix (SSH, SSH2, 
OpenSSH, F-Secure) as well as Windows and the Mac. Then we go far beyond 
the SSH man pages, providing in-depth coverage of advanced topics."

CISCO SWITCHING: BLACK BOOK

A practical in-depth guide to configuring, operating, and managing Cisco LAN 
switches. Covers basic to advanced ISL, spanning tree, switch configuration, 
and switch technologies featuring Cisco's line of Catalyst switches. It's also 
an excellent guide for Cisco WAN and ATM switches. No other book thoroughly 
covers the advanced topics required to achieve this level of comprehensive 
Cisco knowledge or certification in the new CCNP and CCIE curricula.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SATELLITE ENCRYPTION

The book explains the need for secure satellite communications, including ways 
of implementing them, and discusses their implications (in business, government, 
and warfare). Author John Vacca focuses on United States satellite encryption 
policies. This is far more than a networking or government-policy text, though 
its contents have bearing upon wide area network (WAN) designers and 
legislators alike. Vacca explains the physics involved in getting a satellite into 
the most desirable orbit, the computing techniques used for cracking keys, and 
various key-escrow strategies (including Clipper). In addition, there's a lot of 
background information on national security topics other than satellite encryption, 
including missile-defense satellites and the purchase of dangerous military surplus 
by terrorist groups. There's a somewhat breathless warning of year 2000 mayhem, 
but Vacca's approach is generally very deliberate and informative. Topics covered: 
The importance of secure satellite communications, government encryption policies, 
implementation of satellite encryption, information-theft techniques, use and abuse 
of key-escrow schemes, and the role of satellite encryption in the future of 
business and government.

choose your own message to display if anyone attempts to run one of your 
locked programs. Includes password protection so only you can unlock the

unknown and unpublished attacks or any other form of malicious use of the 
monitored application. Created for Linux systems but works on almost every 
UNIX flavor by watching strace outputs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

MACWASHER V2.1

MacWasher is a powerful tool for covering your Internet tracks. Every time you 
use the Net, you're sending information about yourself and your online activities 
to people in the form of cookies. You are also leaving a potential gold mine of 
information about yourself on your Mac in places like e-mail cache files, history 
logs, etc. You are even leaving evidence of applications you recently used, etc. 
MacWasher "washes" all of these tracks away, including the ability to securely 
delete files using the approved techniques of the National Security Agency. 
While the interface is a little garish, such minor flaws are offset by the power 
and versatility of the program. A great tool for people concerned about security 
on the Net, or who want to make sure that they aren't leaving potentially 
damaging (or just embarrassing) evidence on their Mac.
