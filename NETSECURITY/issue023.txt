Security issues 
--------------- 

All vulnerabilities are located at: 
http://net-security.org/text/bugs 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ROXEN SECURITY ALERT 
Roxen 2.0 up to version 2.0.68 has a vulnerability where using URLs containing null 
characters can gain the browser access to information he is not authorized to. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/964399028,33871,.shtml 


[MANDRAKE] INN UPDATE 
A vulnerability exists when verifycancels is enabled in /etc/news/inn.conf. This 
vulnerability could be used to gain root access on any system with inn installed. 
This new version also does not install inews as setgid news or rnews as setuid 
root. Many other security paranoia fixes have been made as well. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/964398854,44315,.shtml 


"PERSISTENT MAIL-BROWSER LINK" VULNERABILITY 
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability affecting 
Microsoft Outlook Express. The vulnerability could allow a malicious user to send 
an email that would "read over the shoulder" of the recipient as he previews 
subsequent emails in Outlook Express 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/964176207,44621,.shtml 


UPDATED PATCH FOR FOR "MALFORMED E-MAIL HEADER" PROBLEM 
On July 18, 2000, Microsoft released the original version of this bulletin, to 
advise customers of the issue and recommend that they install either of the 
two service packs that will eliminate the vulnerability. On July 20, 2000, the 
bulletin was updated to announce the availability of patches that eliminate 
the vulnerability. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/964176103,14653,.shtml 


O'REILLY WEBSITE PROFESSIONAL OVERFLOW 
The indexing utility webfind.exe distributed with O'Reilly WebSite Professional 
contains an unchecked buffer allowing for the remote execution of arbitrary 
code on vulnerable hosts. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/964141648,97231,.shtml 


[@STAKE] IKEY 1000 PROBLEMS 
Rainbow Technologies' iKey 1000 (http://ikey.rainbow.com) is a portable USB 
(Universal Serial Bus) smartcard-like device providing authentication and digital 
storage of passwords, cryptographic keys, credentials, or other data. Using 
the legitimate user's PIN number and the physical USB key, access to the 
public and private data within the key will be granted. The iKey also allows 
administrator access using the MKEY (Master Key) password. Administrator 
access to the iKey, normally used for initialization and configuration, will 
allow all private information stored on the key to be accessed. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/964141537,67366,.shtml 


HP JETDIRECT - INVALID FTP COMMAND DOS 
If you connect to the ftp service on your HP printer and send it the 
following string: quote AAAAAAAAAAA < cr> The printer crashes. It may 
require that you turn the power off and on again to get the printer to work 
again. The display will show an error message similar to this: 86:0003 (the 
bit after the colon seems to vary a bit, we've also gotten :0004, :000B). 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/964103346,59356,.shtml 


REMOTELY EXPLOITABLE BUFFER OVERFLOW IN OUTLOOK 
The vulnerability could enable a malicious sender of an e-mail message with 
a malformed header to cause and exploit a buffer overrun on a user's machine. 
The buffer overrun could crash Outlook Express, Outlook e-mail client, or 
cause arbitrary code to run on the user's machine.
