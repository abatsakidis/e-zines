VIRUS ALERTS GIVE OPTIONS FOR DELIVERY
F-Secure, a Finnish security software vendor, has developed an alert system
that notifies users of new types of virus and denial-of-service attacks by 
sending SMS messages to mobile phones. Offerings, such as Grisoft's AVG 
Virus Alert Network and Dr Solomon's virus alert service, automatically send 
out emails to subscribers.

BIND NEWS AND DNS ALTERNATIVES
Lately, there's been a lot of news about BIND. First of all, a new bug was found
in BIND 8. Basically, a problem in the transaction signature handling code could
allow a buffer overflow which allowed code to be executed as the user running
the nameserver. Then secondly, remote attackers can get information about
the running bind process from environment variables and the stack. So what
are the alternatives?

HOME COMPUTER SECURITY
Computer security firms are turning their attention to emerging market for
protecting home computers from intensifying cyber attacks. "A migration is
taking place as demand is growing in the relatively untapped home security
market," said an official of AhnLab Inc., Korea's leading security software
and service firm.

HEAD AGENCY TECHNICIANS KEEP WARY EYE ON SECURITY
Robert A. Flores, CTO of the CIA, and Jeffrey D. Pound Sr., CTO of the Air Force
Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, said their time is
consumed by security and bandwidth issues. "Every day something is bigger and
more complicated than the day before," Flores said. "We're basically competing
with CNN [for intelligence], but we don't get to charge for our services." Pound
said he worries a lot about "professional hackers, not just kids," because the Air
Force lab is "one of the top U.S. targets." He likes the security of virtual private
networking, but existing firewalls and VPN software cannot handle the gigabit-
level throughput of Air Force networks now being planned, he said. Flores said
the CIA "spends a lot of time trying to break other people's networks. We try 
to hack ourselves to death" to find vulnerabilities. Encryption is not the answer,
he said. If all transmissions and even stored data were encrypted against
intruders, the encryption would prevent indexing and searching of files and 
video streams.

PROTECTING YOUR WORKPLACE
Despite all the advances in anti-virus technology, malicious code remains a 
constant threat. In the chain of computer security, human error continues 
to be the weakest link. Regardless of how well developed security technologies 
may become, they are only as effective as the people operating them allow 
them to be. User behaviour is thus the most important consideration of security. 
With that in mind, this article by Denis Zenkin will set out ten fundamental rules
that will allow users to minimize the threat that viruses, worms and Trojan may
pose.

FAULT IN ANTIVIRUS TOOL
Antivirus vendor Trend Micro last week admitted that its enterprise OfficeScan
software suffers from a product limitation that stops it from detecting particular
viruses until they have infected a system.

WAIT! DON'T FORWARD THAT E-MAIL
A simple JavaScript could make millions of e-mail accounts vulnerable to what
basically amounts to illegal wiretapping, a privacy group reported Monday. The
code enables e-mail to be traced and read by embedding a 20-line script into
JavaScript/HTML-enabled messages. "It's a security flaw inherent in the design,"
said Stephen Keating, executive director of the Privacy Foundation. "It's hard to
know how widely it's been used. But history shows that Web bugs like this are
quickly incorporated into surveillance techniques."

FIRST BOSNIAN TO FACE HACKING CHARGES
35-year-old Bosnian may be the first person in the country to be tried for
hacking after he allegedly broke into the system of an American company
operating locally and destroyed its main database.

AND THE FLOPPIES SPOKE FOR THE VICTIM
Visiting Websites of various governmental computer labs can offer the computer
crime investigator rich background information on how computer forensics gets
done. Perhaps the most interesting feature of the DOD's Computer Forensics 
Laboratory Website, of interest to private sector investigators, is its instructions 
on how to submit evidence to the lab. A detailed request format explains all the 
needed supporting documentation to accompany media offered for examination. 
These instructions describe how to do the backups, how to label the evidence, 
and how to explain the evidence's context. Computer crime investigators will do 
well to study the CFL Request Format in detail and download a copy from the 
site. It serves as an excellent checklist for submitting computer evidence to 
private labs and forensic service firms.

THE INTERNET: IT'S FULL OF HOLES
Computer crackers can read your e-mail, collect your credit card data, intercept
the information you send wirelessly or pry into your private files. The Internet is 
riddled with security holes. And those holes are multiplying as quickly as 
supposedly impenetrable security programs are being written by people and 
firms with a vested interest in the safety of the Internet. Just Monday, three 
reports detailing new and major flaws in wireless security, secure Internet 
transaction protocols and e-mail were released.

FLAW IN NSA/NIST E-SECURITY TECHNOLOGY
A cryptologist with Lucent Technologies' Bell Labs has developed an enhanced
e-commerce security technology, following his discovery of a "significant flaw
that would have threatened the integrity of online transactions." The firm said
that Daniel Bleichenbacher, a member of its Bell Labs' Information Sciences
Research Center, recently discovered a significant flaw in the random number
generation technique used with the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), a
mainstay of most current e-commerce security systems. Bleichenbacher
said that the vulnerability of DSA, which is part of the Digital Signature
Standard, does not pose an immediate threat because of the computing
power required to launch an attack.

SECURITY HOLE EARLY-WARNING SYSTEM
The company that distributes the most ubiquitous breed of Internet server
software is launching an online forum that will alert paying participants to 
potential security holes discovered in the software. The Internet Software 
Consortium - which develops and disseminates the Berkeley Internet Name 
Domain, or "BIND" software - alerted its customers last week to the creation 
of the BIND-Members Forum, according to ISC officials.

SURVEY: LOVE LETTER REMAINS SEDUCTIVE
Computer users haven't learned any lessons from the spread of the Love Bug
virus last year. According to research published by IDC this week, more than
a third (37 percent) of business email users would still open the attachment
of an email titled 'ILOVEYOU' - the same message used in emails infected with
the Love Bug.

THE GREATEST HACKS OF ALL TIME
The recent spate of security breaches and e-mail invasions including Monday's
news trilogy - the World Economic Forum hack, the JavaScript email wiretapping
scare, and the hole discovered in the protocol that is supposed to secure data 
transmitted wirelessly - recalls some of the most infamous exploits of the past.
Here, then, is one observer's list of The Greatest Hacks of All Time.

802.11 WIRELESS SECURITY
Wireless networks are becoming de rigeur, something you must have if you want
to keep up with the Joneses. You can now surf the Web and pick up email while
sitting in an airplane lounge, have your laptop in a conference room with no
unsightly cables, or read email while in bed. The cost of these networks has
plummeted. Base stations like the Apple AirPort can be had for $300, and the
cards are around $100 (both support 11 megabit/sec operation). However, like
all network technologies, they both solve problems (like where to run cable)
and create a lot of new ones (like how to communicate securely). Unfortunately,
most sites seem to have implemented 802.11 wireless networks without much
(if any) thought for security.

MS USERS MAY EXPERIENCE PAIN
Microsoft wants you to "experience" its next-generation software, but it doesn't
want the software to experience too many trips to the CD-ROM drive. The 
company has put strong anti-piracy protection into its next generation of 
software that requires registering the software and reduces the number of 
times it can be installed. But securing the software could cause belated 
headaches for customers if the software becomes unusable.

BIN LADEN: STEGANOGRAPHY MASTER?
If there's one thing the FBI hates more than Osama bin Laden, it's when Osama
bin Laden starts using the Internet. So it should be no surprise that the feds
are getting unusually jittery about what they claim is evidence that bin Laden
and his terrorist allies are using message-scrambling techniques to evade law
enforcement. The technique, known as steganography, is the practice of
embedding secret messages in other messages - in a way that prevents an
observer from learning that anything unusual is taking place.

BOOK REVIEW
"According to its preface "The FreeBSD Corporate Networker's Guide" is written
for beginning FreeBSD administrators who want to use FreeBSD on a network
that also contains Microsoft systems. The book is meant to introduce FreeBSD
to a person who has only worked on Microsoft products and help them determine
which functions to switch over to FreeBSD (e.g. file and web servers, routing)
and which to keep on Microsoft servers."

HUNTING THE WILD HACKER
Work should be play, says a new book that sets forth the emerging ethical code
of free-software programmers. With a foreword by Torvalds and an afterword by
Manuel Castells, Pekka Himanen's "The Hacker Ethic" is a slender volume of
musings on the value system of that new info-age breed of worker - the
code hacker.

YOUR OPINION: "MOST SECURE OS"
 
Recently we held a promotion for "The FreeBSD Corporate Networker's Guide"
and it was the perfect oportunity to ask our visitors to share some thoughts,
and, receive a free copy of the book. The question we asked was: "Whick OS
do you think is the most secure and why?" We didn't even imagine the
overwhelming response. We received 344 opinions, and it was hard to
pick the top five. The conclusion of the survey is pretty interesting.

INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT HANDBOOK 2001
 
The runaway growth of computer viruses and worms and the ongoing 
nuisance posed by malicious hackers and employees who exploit the 
security vulnerabilities of open network protocols make the tightness 
of an organization's security systeman issue of prime importance. And 
information systems technology is advancing at a frenetic pace. Against 
this background, the challenges facing information security professionals 
are increasing rapidly. This book is an essential reference for anyone 
involved in the security of information systems.

THE PRACTICAL INTRUSION DETECTION HANDBOOK
 
No matter how good your computer security measures, something is likely to
happen. The last six months have seen a lot of front page news focusing on
computer security failures: denial of service attacks, viruses, etc. And how 
many companies have been intruded, but can't make the intrusion public? How 
many employees do damage to systems from within the company? My point is 
that computer security breaches are common. The point isn't so much what 
to do to prevent them-although that is, certainly, important-but what to do 
to detect them quickly and fix them-or fix the damage that occurs quickly. 
This is what Paul Proctor's book focuses on. Paul is a pioneer of the intrusion 
detection field, and a foremost leader in the field. Paul has developed numerous 
commercial technologies, has worked for the US President's National Security 
Telecommunications Advisory Committee and other agencies, and has been 
personally involved in several of the world's most significant intruder "take-
downs". Paul's book is designed to walk you through the issues that you need 
to consider and the practical steps you can take to come up with a workable 
and implementable plan for your company's or government agency's needs.

disk image files, but unless the disk image is mounted, WormScanner will not be
able to look inside. This version of WormScanner uses the Symantec published
file sizes of the AutoStart Worm variants to distinguish one from another,
provides a worm's creation date and file size within its transcript, and
attempts to find worms that have been deactivated by the benign D variant.
