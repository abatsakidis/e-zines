INTERVIEW WITH WIETSE VENEMA
This week brings us something a bit different, an interview with Wietse Venema,
author of TCP_Wrappers and Postfix.

CHASING THE WIND, EPISODE FOUR
SecurityFocus.com presents the fourth installation in the highly popular "Chasing
the Wind" series, entitled "Through a Glass, Darkly". In this episode, while Jake,
the exhausted system administrator, is sleeping obliviously at home, our ambitious 
script-kiddie and aspiring hacker, Ian, successfully defaces the Acme Ailerons site, 
hoping to impress his heartthrob, if not the vaunted Br04dB4ndits. Meanwhile, Bob 
travels to the high-security Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and 
Intelligence (C4I) center for a very high-level, very secretive meeting...

HEARING ON ECHELON IN DUTCH PARLIAMENT
Monday the Dutch Parliament held a public hearing on Echelon. Last Friday, the
Dutch government confirmed the existence of Echelon. Duncan Campbell told the
members of parliament of recent developments in his research into the global
spying system Echelon. He has just finished a report for the temporary committee
on Echelon of the European Parliament, in which more evidence of economical
spying is revealed.

SENATOR PROPOSES SPYWARE SECURITY BILL
John Edwards, a Democrat from North Carolina, refiled the legislation that would
uncloak so-called spyware programs that use encrypted codes to monitor users'
online activity and later share that usage information with advertisers,
telemarketers or other businesses, according to a statement. Edwards
initially filed the Spyware Control and Privacy Protection Act bill in Oct. 
2000, but Congress failed to take action on it.

COMPUTER SYSTEMS AT RISK
Computer systems at more than 60 agencies in the District of Columbia remain
at risk because of shoddy computer security practices at the DC Department 
of Public Works, the General Accounting Office (GAO) said today. In a 
comprehensive audit of security practices at the department released today, 
the GAO found that the District had not adequately limited computer access 
granted to employees. The report also said the District had improperly managed 
the majority of its employees' user IDs and passwords, and failed to maintain 
software controls or sufficiently protect its networks and other computer 
systems from unauthorized use.

INSTALLING TRIPWIRE
In the first part of this series we had a laid the ground work that took us a step 
further towards understanding the necessity of a full fledged Intrusion Detection 
system. A good policy is to mix and match the best to form a security grid that 
should be difficult enough even for the expert cracker to penetrate. The various
IDS systems of interest to us throughout this series will be purely Tripwire and 
Snort.

CRYPTO REGS STILL TRICKY
Over a year after the US government first announced the liberalization of 
encryption export rules, a tangle of vestigial regulations might still trip up 
unwary developers, experts say. "Never work under the belief that encryption 
is not controlled," said Susan Kotila, project manager with Apple's export license 
department. "I've run into a lot of developers where I've had to tell them, I've 
got the name of a good lawyer, but you're in violation right now."

INTERNET HYGIENE
If you surf the Web and read email, you must be brave enough to connect your 
computer to the Internet. But are you aware of the threats out there, and have 
you guarded yourself against losing your files and your privacy?

NETWORK ASSOCIATES WEATHERS DOS ATTACK
Security firm Network Associates was subject to a denial of service attack last 
night after crackers posted a Trojan horse on security mailing list, BugTraq. An 
anonymous posting to the full-disclosure security mailing list, which has 85 000 
readers, that appeared to be an exploit of recently discovered vulnerability in 
BIND name server program, was in fact cleverly disguised malicious code that 
attacked Network Associates' web site, Nai.com.

NSA LOOKS TO LINUX FOR VIRTUAL SECURITY
Software emulation firm VMware announced it has teamed up with researchers 
at the National Security Agency to create a nearly crack-proof computer that 
can place sensitive data in virtual vaults inside the PC. The concept, assuming 
it works, would streamline the methods intelligence agencies use to manage 
data. At present, the NSA - the military surveillance arm of the United States 
intelligence community - physically separates networks carrying data of a 
particular classification. For example, top-secret data might be kept on a 
different computer than data classified merely as sensitive material. Sometimes, 
for workers to have access to the information they need, up to six different 
computers can be on a single desk.

MEDIUM RISK PASSWORD GRABBER
Software security firm McAfee.com Corp. said the worm, which it said spreads 
through e-mail and installs itself on users systems, posed a medium-risk for 
AOL users, and cautioned them to be careful with attachments to e-mails.

EBAY FIGHTING SPAMMERS
Online auction portal eBay has announced it will soon begin masking its users'
e-mail addresses in an effort to stop spammers from harvesting them.

EXTREME SECURITY FOR WEB SERVERS
To enter the vaults inside the windowless bunker-like compound requires
punching in key codes and slipping your fingers into a series of scanners
similar to those used at the U.S. Navy's nuclear facilities. The scanners
leave little to chance. Their sensitive glass touch pads read thumbprints
and detect body heat and pulse. "So if someone cuts your thumb off, they
can't use it to get in," Patrick Sweeney said. Welcome to ServerVault.
Sweeney, its founder, hopes the Dulles facility he opened in January will
be a standout among the increasingly crowded field of Web-hosting centers.
Such centers were built to provide the pipes, power and space needed to
house computers that manage Web sites. But their proliferation during the
past few years has left many of them competing for a niche market. The
security paranoid seems to be the target of choice in the scramble for
customers.

FORMER SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR SENTENCED
A former network administrator for the US District Court in Alaska has been
sentenced for launching a series of denial-of-service attacks against a New
York District Court Web site. According to information released today by the
FBI, Anchorage resident Scott Dennis was sentenced Jan. 19 to three months
in jail for launching three denial-of-service attacks against the US District
Court for the Eastern District of New York.

VIGILANCE IS KEY TO SECURITY, EXPERTS SAY
Companies hiring services to protect their corporate data from hackers may not
be doing enough to protect themselves, say security professionals. Businesses 
must be vigilant in continually evaluating their security, representatives of five 
leading security companies said at the ComNet Expo in Washington, D.C. this 
week. Denial of service attacks, website vandalism, identity theft, loss of 
customer information, and theft of credit card numbers are now everyday 
occurrences. It seems as soon as one kind of attack is thwarted, another 
crops up.

JUNO'S SUPERCOMPUTER PROVOKES PRIVACY GUARDS
Juno Online Service's jump into the supercomputing business has alarmed 
consumer and privacy advocates, who fear the move could open subscribers' 
computers to vulnerabilities - including snooping by third parties such as the 
government.

cases of 2001. BTW, Granick is now defending Jerome Heckenkamp, the 21
year-old Los Alamos National Laboratory employee accused of breaking into 
eBay's computer systems.

Security issues
---------------

All vulnerabilities are located at:
http://net-security.org/text/bugs


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUSE SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT - BIND8
bind-8.x in all versions of the SuSE distributions contain a bug in the transaction 
signature handling code that can allow to remotely over-flow a buffer and 
thereby execute arbitrary code as the user running the nameserver (this is user 
named by default on SuSE systems). In addition to this bug, another problem 
allows for a remote attacker to collect information about the running bind 
process (this has been found by Claudio Musmarra).
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/980911660,3523,.shtml


DOS VULNERABILITY IN SLIMSERVE HTTPD
If an extraoridinarily long string of 'A's is sent to the server in a GET request,
the server crashes.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/980911767,20695,.shtml


IMMUNIX OS SECURITY ADVISORY - BIND
The people at COVERT Labs have discovered a number of security problems 
with all previous versions of Bind. Packages have been created and released 
for Immunix 6.2 and 7.0-beta to fix these problems.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/980911850,52686,.shtml


FINGERPRINTING BIND 9.1.0
The BIND 9.1.0beta releases and now BIND 9.1.0 include another hard coded 
chaos record called "authors". So now even if an admin changes or suppresses 
their version reply string, a remote user can still determine whether the server 
is running BIND 9.x. With the recent discovery of the tsig bug in BIND there will 
probably be a huge rise in version queries. Some attackers may remove ambiguity 
by skipping servers that reply to authors.bind (inferring that it's bind 9.1.0 and 
not vulnerable).
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/980911986,49684,.shtml


HYPERSEEK 2000 SEARCH ENGINE VULNERABILITY
Standart perl problem is in the statistic module - file: hsx.cgi, script does not 
filter ../ and %00. Through this bug, you can remotely read any file and make 
listing of directory. ../ - directory up, %00 hex symbol, that means end of line.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/980912263,68944,.shtml


LINUX MANDRAKE - XEMACS SECURITY UPDATE
Previous versions of XEmacs had a problem with the gnuserv application.
Versions prior to 21.1.14 could allow arbitrary code to be executed by 
overrunning the magic cookie buffer, as well as accepting the prefix of 
valid magic cookies (i.e. "12" is accepted if the cookie is "12345678").
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/981062616,18583,.shtml


GOAHEAD WEBSERVER VULNERABILITY
An Attacker can get any file from the drive where the web-server was installed.
Try the following request:
http://www.somehost.com/..\..\..\..\..\..\autoexec.bat
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/981258388,21071,.shtml


NETSCAPE E.S. WEB PUBLISHER ACL VULNERABILITIES
Vulnerability Briefing: A very wide problem with ACL settings and default settings 
with Netscape Enterprise Server (Publisher). Here are descriptors which provides
a criteria of what should be considered vulnerable: 
-The default Enterprise Server index is public
-http://www.poorperms.null/publisher is publicly available
-Proper and more secure ACL selections
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/981258483,27716,.shtml


WEBSPHERE - MINOR CSS ISSUE
"Something i came across while testing some of our WebSphere installations 
(these have been fixed in the current versions of vanilla Apache, so i assume 
these are just an inherited problem from the old Apache codebase.. Makes 
you wonder what else there is?"

LOMAC v.1.0.2

LOMAC is a security enhancement for Linux that uses Low Water-Mark 
Mandatory Access Control to protect the integrity of processes and data 
from viruses, Trojan horses, malicious remote users, and compromised root 
daemons. LOMAC is implemented as a loadable kernel module - no kernel 
recompilations or changes to existing applications are required. Although 
not all the planned features are currently implemented, it presently 
provides sufficient protection to thwart script-kiddies, and is stable 
enough for everyday use.

SUB 7 STOP! 0.1.07

This is a sub7 fake server that listens to the default port (27374) of the Trojan 
horse waiting for connections. If someone tries to connect, the program will 
accept the connection and will send to the sub7 client a fake message. This 
program does not have any of the real sub7 server functions, it is totally secure. 
The program does not give any protection to infected PCs, the main idea is to 
confuse the attacker. Note: This version is in Spanish; an English version will 
be available soon.

NETVIEW SCANNER SUITE 1.0.0.6

NetView is a suite of three security applications that allows Webmasters and 
system administrators to audit a site for security vulnerabilities. NetView scans 
a range of IP addresses for shared resources that have been shared via 
Microsoft File and Printer Sharing, to see what types of resources are shared 
on a network and to warn the computer users if any unsecured resources are 
displayed. PortScan scans for listening TCP ports, allowing system administrators 
to determine what types of services are running on computers under their care. 
WebBrute attempts a brute-force user ID and password attack on an HTTP 
Authenticated Web site that is using "Basic Authentication," so a webmaster 
can verify that no security-compromising user ID and password combinations 
are in use on a site.

Enterprise, which enables any organization to send its email safely and 
confidential through the Internet. The benefits of the MGE solutions we

SHIFT KEY SUITE 1.0.4

Shift Key Suite is a collection of applications intended to extend the functionality 
of password-protection systems for Macintosh computers. Many of the password
protection systems for the Mac function as extensions or control panels that can 
be bypassed by holding down the Shift key during start-up. Shift Key Suite gives 
you the option of disabling the Shift key for the duration of start-up. If you 
frequently experience start-up crashes from incompatible extensions and control 
panels, this software is probably not something you would want on your computer. 
However, if your system is running smoothly, Shift Key Suite may be just what 
you need to protect your computer's privacy.
