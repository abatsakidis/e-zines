HACKERS AS CRIMINALS

Security issues 
--------------- 

All vulnerabilities are located at: 
http://net-security.org/text/bugs 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

REMOTE DOS ATTACK IN REAL NETWORKS REAL SERVER 
The Ussr Labs team has recently discovered a memory problem in the RealServer 
7 Server (patched and non-patched). What happens is, by performing an attack 
sending specially-malformed information to the RealServer HTTP Port(default is 
8080), the process containing the services will stop responding. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/962751695,46694,.shtml 


ORACLE WEB LISTENER FOR AIX DOS 
By issuing a malformed URL (variations on "..") it is possible to cause a Denial of 
Service situation where the Oracle_Web_Listener will no longer accept HTTP 
requests and the service needs to be restarted. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/962846668,98024,.shtml 


VULNERABILITY IN POLL_IT CGI V2.0 
Because the CGI initializes it's internal variables before parsing any form data, 
and the method it uses to parse form data overwrites internal variables (in this 
case, $data_dir), it is possible to retrieve any files readable by the webserver. 
http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/962976911,43476,.shtml 


PATCHING "STORED PROCEDURE PERMISSIONS" VULNERABILITY 
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in 
Microsoft SQL Server 7.0. The vulnerability could allow a malicious user to run 
a database stored procedure without proper permissions. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/963135822,65666,.shtml 


COBALT LINUX PROBLEMS 
There are two major problems with Cobalt Linux, used to drive the Cobalt RaQ 
series of hardware (used by thousands of ISPs). Both problems were tested 
against a Cobalt RaQ 3 with OS Update 3.0, which was released on the 15th 
of June. No updates have been released. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/963135955,96589,.shtml 


FLOWERFIRE SAWMILL VULNERABILITIES PATCH 
"We have just shipped a new version of Flowerfire Sawmill (5.0.22) which 
corrects both of the vulnerabilities mentioned on your web site (Flowerfire 
Sawmill File Access Vulnerability and Flowerfire Sawmill Weak Password 
Encryption Vulnerability). The update is free. " 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/963136068,19952,.shtml 


NOVELL BORDER MANGER PROBLEM 
To provide SSO-like capabilities for customers using BorderManger proxy server 
and the NetWare client, Novell uses a small program, ClientTrust, typically run 
from the user's login script. Once run, ClientTrust listens indefinitely on port 
3024 for requests. Upon a user's initial attempt to access the web through 
BorderManager, BorderManager sends a "request" to the user's box in the 
form of UDP packets on port 3024. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/963136348,87288,.shtml 


[MANDRAKE] BITCHX UPDATE 
A denial of service vulnerability exists in BitchX. Improper handling of incoming 
invitation messages can crash the client. Any user on IRC can send the client 
an invitation message that causes BitchX to segfault. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/963228702,20509,.shtml

COMMON SYSTEM INTRUSION METHODS by Craig H. Rowland

SECURITY FOR THE HOME NETWORK - by JC Pollman and Bill Mote 

"Security for the home network is your responsibility. With all the tools available 
to the crackers and script kiddies, it is not a matter of IF but rather WHEN you 
will be probed and possibly attacked. I have personally been connected via 
modem for less than 5 minutes and been port scanned! Your ISP really does not 
care if you are being attacked by "x" because if they shut down "x", tomorrow it 
will be "y" attacking you. Fortunately there are several things you can do to 
greatly increase the security of your network."
