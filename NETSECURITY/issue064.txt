ARIZONA GOVERNOR VETOES CYBER-SECURITY BILL
Arizona Gov. Jane Hull, R, vetoed legislation approved by the state legislature 
that would have established a critical infrastructure protection plan for the 
state. Although the legislature approved the bill, a veto appeared all but 
certain once state Chief Information Officer Rick Zelznak signaled his 
opposition last week.

ROLLING BLACKOUTS ROLL INTO A PROVIDER NEAR YOU
On May 8th, 2001, the hosting service provider Exodus was temporarily 
knocked offline by an explosion in a generating electric company, underneath 
the provider's building. No one intended for this to happen, and by all accounts 
it was an "accident" due to the problems that the state is currently facing with 
its power supply. Was this to be considered a Denial of Service? Many would 
argue that since this was more an "Act of God" than a malicious attack, then 
No, it shouldn't be something for security professionals to concern themselves 
with. There are, however, some inherent risks that are compounded when 
something unfortunate happens such as this.

DEFENSE IN DEPTH: CRON
A few days ago an exploit was released for crontab that allows local users 
to get root access. Of course almost every Linux (and for that matter UNIX) 
system comes with crontab installed and enabled, so for the vendors affected 
virtually every installed machine is vulnerable. Some vendors have already 
started to issue updates, but of course this does nothing for the people 
already exploited or the people who's vendors have not yet issued updates. 
This is where defense in depth comes in.

SOUTH KOREA FALLS VICTIM TO THE ATTACKS
A South Korean government computer security agency said 164 cases of 
hacking of sites run by universities, companies, research and private groups 
had been blamed on the China-US cyber war since May 4. According to the 
posts to Incidents mailing list, the number of penetrated Korean hosts is 
much bigger, because literally there isn't a system administrator that wasn't 
probed by someone on .kr domain.

WORM TURNS ON CHEGGERS SITE
Keith Chegwin's latest project, cheggersbedroom.com, a live webcast show 
straight from the bedroom of the man himself, has fallen foul of the site
defacing worm sadmind/IIS. But white hat hackers have pointed out that the 
site still has more holes than a sieve. Any of the 4,000,000 users the site 
claims to have logging on this morning would have been greeted by the 
message "Fuck USA Government, Fuck Poizonbox", the trademark message 
of the worm.

FBI LAUNCHES COMPUTER SECURITY REVIEW
The FBI is conducting an overview of its computer security policies and 
practices in the wake of spying accusations against Robert Hanssen, 
according to a senior FBI information technology official.

MOB PHREAKERS RULE VEGAS PHONE NETWORK
Do hackers control sin city? Adult entertainment operators, private eyes, a 
bail bondsman and his bounty hunter all say they've felt the pinch from a 
shady cyberpunk syndicate. Now the state has launched an investigation,

HOT 100: SECURITY
In these uncertain economic times, security has maintained its strong popularity 
as a viable investment area for venture capitalists. A host of managed security 
service providers (MSSPs) and companies addressing the notorious distributed 
denial-of-service attacks are among the most recent to receive substantial 
venture funding.

STUDYING NORMAL TRAFFIC, PART THREE: TCP HEADERS
This is the final article in Karen Frederick's three-part series devoted to studying 
normal traffic. The first two articles in this series showed how to capture packets 
using WinDump and reviewed some of the basics of normal TCP/IP traffic. In this 
article, we will be looking at two other aspects of normal TCP traffic: the structure 
of TCP packets and the use of TCP options.

USERS MOLD SECURITY BENCHMARK
The problem with IT security benchmarks is that the reference point is a 
constantly shifting target as new technologies and threats emerge. And 
that's an especially difficult problem to overcome, said corporate security 
systems managers. They are examining the fruits of a relatively new 
cooperative effort that this week will yield the near-final version of a 
systems security benchmark for Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Solaris. But 
despite concern about the benchmark's continued usefulness, end-user 
members of the Center for Internet Security said the organization's 
technical benchmark for securing Solaris systems will be key to their 
security efforts.

MS GETS PRIVACY-HAPPY WITH NEW IE
Microsoft's Internet Explorer 6, due to roll out this fall with the Windows XP 
operating system, will provide users with new tools to protect their privacy. 
Using a new standard protocol called the Platform for Privacy Preferences 
(P3P), the browser will automatically be able to read the privacy policies 
associated with cookies, which will be blocked or allowed through settings 
that users select.

E-MAIL WORM PRETENDS TO BE FRIENDLY VIRUS WARNING
Symantec has issued a real warning about a fake virus alert that looks like an 
e-mail bulletin from the Cupertino, Calif., company. The big problem with the 
bogus e-mail, Symantec says, is that it comes with a new Internet worm 
attached. The worm, written as a Microsoft Visual Basic script, is designed 
to probe the address book of recipients who use the Outlook Express e-mail 
application and send copies of itself to the contacts it finds there.

SECURE VPNs
Seems everyone who has deployed a virtual private network has a war story to 
tell. The gateway is difficult to configure correctly. Or, conflicts between NAT 
and IPSec cause legitimate packets to be refused or dropped. Or, there's no 
way to efficiently manage the security of a remote client. Bottom line: VPNs 
solve some security problems, but in doing so they often introduce others. 
Here's one real-life war story from a network analyst at a Midwest-based 
insurance company. The analyst--we'll call him Bill--agreed to speak to 
Information Security about his firm's VPN problems on condition of anonymity.

BREAKING INTO INFOSEC
Information security, as a discipline, is replete with quirky ironies. "Trusted" 
internal users pose a greater threat than external malicious users. Virus alerts 
and vulnerability warnings help black hats refine their attacks. Considering 
these ironies, it should come as no surprise that the rise in "hacking" has 
also increased the interest in infosec as a professional career.

IIS BACKDOOR, YAHOO AND THE REG
Eric S. Raymond (via LinuxToday): "Today, Yahoo is carrying the news that 
Microsoft has admitted the existence of a backdoor in its IIS webserver that 
could affect hundreds of thousands of websites worldwide". The Register 
promptly answered with article titled "Yahoo buys ancient WSJ FrontPage 
'backdoor' report". Article on the Yahoo Business News site was pulled off...


ISSUE #17 OF HACK IN THE BOX'S E-ZINE IS OUT

CHEESE WORM
System administrators worldwide reported signs Wednesday that another 
worm had started to infect Linux systems. This worm appears to be different, 
however: Dubbed the Cheese worm (it was found in /tmp/.cheese/), the 
program is basically a self-spreading patch. It enters servers that have 
already have been compromised by 1i0n worm and closes the back door 
behind it.

ECHELON FLOODING WORM
VBS/LoveLet-CL is a variant of the Love Letter worm. The worm makes two 
copies of itself, using the filenames command.vbs and WinVXD.vbs. These 
files are executed each time the computer boots up. The worm's code 
contains a list of almost 300 terms that could trigger surveillance systems--
such as the much-theorized Echelon system--that scan for e-mails whose 
content could affect national security. Words such as toxin, detonator, 
conspiracy, uzi, grenades and assassination all appear in the body of the 
virus.

IT CONSULTANT DENIES L25M WEB SITE BLACKMAIL
IT consultant Graham Browne is to be tried at the Old Bailey in September for 
attempting to blackmail an unidentified financial institution for L25 million over 
weak security, Private Eye reports. Browne denies an alleged threat to 
compromise the security of Barclays' Barclaycard operation. The blackmail 
demands were made between March and September last year. Barclays' 
online banking service - the largest in Britain - was cracked in July last 
year and collapsed again in February this year.

CRACKING E-SECURITY
If the governments of the world are to be believed, Public Key Infrastructure 
(PKI) is playing straight into the hands of the criminal underworld. According 
to some, it is just too strong, which means that Big Brother finds it very 
difficult to keep his beady eyes locked onto our every movement. This may 
well be true, but whether that is a valid enough reason for certain government 
departments to want access to private keys - as was once mooted - is 
debatable. The fact is that PKI does a job and does it very well.

SOLARIS AND IP FILTER
IP Filter is not only an excellent perimeter defense mechanism for networks, it 
is also a great way for the security-minded to teach themselves firewalling and 
NAT concepts. This article will examine the ways in which IP Filter can be used 
for Network Address Translation on a Solaris system. Specifically, it will discuss 
NAT functionality in IP Filter, Configuring IP Filter for NAT, and some advantages 
and disadvantages of using IP Filter for NAT.

HACKERS CASH IN ON E-COMMERCE BUG
In April, a devastating bug was found in shopping cart software called "PDG" that 
exposed all customer records on about 4,000 Web sites. The FBI issued a public 
warning directed at the software's customers, but a small e-commerce Web site 
named SawyerDesign.com didn't notice.

E-MAIL SECURITY
For more than 10 years, secure e-mail has been a standard topic of discussion 
in the corporate IT and computer security community. Subscribe to any IT, 
networking or security magazine, and you're bound to read an article on the 
subject every few issues. Browse through the brochure of any infosecurity 
conference, and you'll almost always come across at least one session or 
workshop on the topic. Surf the Web sites of the industry's prominent vendors, 
and you're sure to come across a white paper or product related to this ever
present consumer and corporate need. Despite this preponderance of information, 
advice and technology solutions, only a fraction of corporate and consumer 
'Netizens actually use some type of e-mail security. Problems with protocol 
and product interoperability, scalability and usability have left many users 
wondering if protecting their e-mail is really worth the headache. That's the 
bad news.

LINUX SECURITY ADVICE: SUID PROGRAMS
This is not going to be another article on inetd.conf, or even firewalling your 
Linux box. Those are both great security measures, but they've been done to 
death. Instead, I'm going to talk about protecting your box from your own 
users. Here's the scenario. You've got a Linux server, and of course you've: 
gotten rid of unneeded services, you only installed the packages you needed, 
and you've patched them to the most current version. For whatever reason, 
you have users on your system, with shell access. But you want to make 
sure they can't do anything more than what you allow them to.

ASP SECURITY AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION GUIDELINES RELEASED
New global procedures for improved security and efficient dispute resolution for 
application service providers (ASP) were announced today to help solidify the 
future of the emerging industry. After a year's work, the Wakefield, Mass.

HACKERS CRACK A&B SITE
Internet shoppers surfing A&B Sound's online store early Friday were surprised 
to find customer names, credit-card numbers and expiry dates on the Web site 
before the company discovered the security breach and shut it down. The 
breach affected only shoppers with outstanding orders at the online store. A&B 
Sound was contacting those customers Friday, warning them to contact their 
credit-card issuer. Customers at the company's regular retail outlets were not 
affected.

RED HAT 7.0 - MAN LOCAL GID 15 (MAN) EXPLOIT
Due to a slight error in a length check, the -S option to man can cause a buffer 
overflow on the heap, allowing redirection of execution into user supplied code.

INCREDIMAIL FILE OVERWRITE VULNERABILITY
Users can specify the filename of the skin, notifyer, animation etc This is 
specified in a text file called Content.ini, which is found in the compressed 
skin or animation. By appending the traditional dot dot to the filename, 
malicious users can easily over write any files on the same partition as 
Incredimail is intalled to. The file is automatically downloaded and copied 
to the client machine when it accesses a site or e-mail which starts a 
download for the Incredimail file. If the file already exists it tries to over 
write it.

LINUX-MANDRAKE: VIXIE-CRON UPDATE
A recent security fix to cron introduced a new problem with giving up
privileges before invoking the editor. A malicious local user could 
exploit this to gain root acces.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/989877174,36057,.shtml


LINUX-MANDRAKE: ZOPE ZCLASSES PROBLEM
Another problem was discovered in Zope that fixes a problem with
ZClasses. Any user can visit a ZClass declaration and change the
ZClass permission mappings for methods and other objects defined within
the ZClass, possibly allowing for unauthorized access within the Zope
instance. The Zope Hotfix 2001-05-01 corrects this problem.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/989877224,94704,.shtml


LINUX-MANDRAKE: CUPS UPDATE
The version of cups shipped with Linux-Mandrake 8.0 has a problem where 
when a user prints a multi-page PostScript file with embedded pictures, the 
pages following the first with the picture are all printed on the same page, 
one on top of the other. From multi-page Abiword files (only text) only the 
last page is printed. This update resolves this bug. As well, the upstream 
1.1.7 release of cups fixes some security issues.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/989877293,61690,.shtml


CARELLO E-COMMERCE VULNERABILITY
A malicious user can execute arbitrary commands on the E-Commerce server
with the privileges of the web server.

BECKY! 2.00.05 BUFFER OVERFLOW
If the message includes over 65536 bytes without new line characters, the 
buffer will be overflowed. Buffer overflow also occurs when attempt to reply 
or forward to the message included over 8188 bytes without new line 
characters. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow remote 
attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

NETPROWLER 3.5.X PASSWORD RESTRICTIONS NOTES
The latest version of the NetProwler intrusion detection product comes as a 
three-tiered architecture, consisting of agents, a management component, 
and a console. Access between the components is achieved via channels 
that are protected by passwords, which have several weak defaults and 
unnecessary restrictions.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/989925134,98857,.shtml


NETPROWLER 3.5.X DATABASE CONFIG. VULNERABILITY
The latest version of the NetProwler intrusion detection product comes as a 
three-tiered architecture, consisting of agents, a management component, 
and a console. Both configuration and auditing information is stored within a 
MySQL database hosted locally on the management tier of the product. This 
database is exposed unnecessarily to potential network scrutiny due to being 
configured by default to listen to all local IP addresses.

MICROSOFT IIS CGI FILENAME DECODE ERROR
NSFOCUS Security Team has found a vulnerability in filename processing of CGI 
program in MS IIS4.0/5.0. CGI filename is decoded twice by error. Exploitation 
of this vulnerability, intruder may run arbitrary system command.

PERSONAL WEB SHARING REMOTE STOP (MACOS 9)
Personal Web Sharing extension, which ships with MacOS 9, can\'t handle a 
request longer than 6000 characters. A request, which contains 6000 or more 
characters seems to stop the file sharing, probably to avoid a system freeze. 
Web sharing can easily be started up again in seconds.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/989936069,71661,.shtml


3COM OFFICECONNECT DSL ROUTER VULNERATIBILITIES
Yesterday night I discovered a vulnerabilty. The router is a 3COM OfficeConnect 
812 and the vulnerability is on the HTTP server, on port 80. When you enter 
with a browser on one of this router, you are asked for user/password, if you 
fail, you can see a web page telling you that is a protected object, but you 
have a .GIF file you have access to and you don't need to put the .GIF.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/989966143,41364,.shtml


NETSCAPE ENTERPRISE WEB PUBLISHER BUFFER OVERFLOW
The Web Publisher feature in Netscape Enterprise 4.1 is vulnerable to a buffer 
overflow. By sending a large buffer containing executable code and a new 
Instruction Pointer, an attacker is able to gain remote system shell access 
to the vulnerable server.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/990042393,45546,.shtml


OMNIHTTPD PRO DENIAL OF SERVICE VULNERABILITY
The OmniHTTPd Pro web server is susceptible to a DoS through a lengthy POST 
request. If such a request is made to the server which exceeds 4111 bytes in 
size the server process will die. Neither the request or the crash are recorded 
in the server logfiles.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/990042411,72473,.shtml


SUSE SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT: CRON-3.0
The crontab program is running setuser-id root and invokes the editor
specified in the EDITOR environment variable, usually vi. If crontab discovers 
that the format of the edited file is incorrect, it executes the editor again but 
fails to drop its root privileges before. Therefore it is possible to execute 
arbitrary commands as root. Sebastian Krahmer has found the bug. It has 
been fixed by properly dropping the privileges before executing the editor.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/990042461,46055,.shtml


DCFORUM PASSWORD FILE MANIPULATION VULNERABILITY
It is vulnerable to an attack which will grant a remote attacker the status of 
DCForum administrator, which can then be used to execute arbitrary commands 
on the server.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/990042478,65100,.shtml


RUMPUS FTP DENIAL OF SERVICE
If you try to make a directory which name is 65 characters long, the Rumpus 
FTP service and the computer freezes. You can try to force Rumpus to quit, 
but it never worked for me(always crashed when I pressed the \'Force quit\' 
button). Also, the passwords are stored in plain text(in prefs folder, a file 
called \'Rumpus User Database\'), as in most macintosh programs, Maxum 
Support said to think about encrypting passwords in newer versions.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/990042495,76360,.shtml


IRIX REMOTE BUFFER OVERFLOW VULNERABILITY
There is a buffer overflow in “rpc.espd” that may allow remote attackers to 
execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable host. A local account is not 
required to exploit this vulnerability.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/990042512,9954,.shtml


CABLE-ROUTER AR220E PORTMAPPER FLAW
Device: Allied Telesyn AT-AR220e, Firmware 1.08a RC14, combined DSL/Cable
Router, NAT, Firewall, HTML-Config. This Device is equipped with the function 
'Virtual Server', which is a portmapper WAN -> LAN. The 'Virtual Server'
functionality can be disabled completely and single portmappings can be 
disabled each, too.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/990042530,55641,.shtml


REMOTE DESKTOP 3.0 DENIAL OF SERVICE
Remote desktop agent listens on ports 5044 and 5045. 5044 is to send data 
and 5045 is to receive data. After a session is started a 3rd system can be 
used to send data to port 5045 of the agent and crash the session. The 
agent will then not respond for roughly a minute, and in some cases not 
respond until restarted.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/990106221,70037,.shtml


SNIFFING LOGITECH WIRELESS DEVICES
The receiver waits for 30 minutes after initialising a connect for new devices to 
sync on them. An attacker is able to sniff the connect-sequence of a victim's 
device from far and to lock-in to the pair of frequencies / codes of the victim's 
devices or to take control of a victim's devices.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/990106300,21851,.shtml


LINUX-MANDRAKE: PINE UPDATE
Versions of the Pine email client prior to 4.33 have various temporary
file creation problems, as does the pico editor. These issues allow
any user with local system access to cause any files owned by any
other user, including root, to potentially be overwritten if the
conditions were right.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/990106798,20612,.shtml


RED HAT LINUX: UPDATED GNUPG PACKAGES
Updated gnupg packages are now available for Red Hat Linux 6.2, 7, and 7.1.
These updates address a potential vulnerability which could allow an
attacker to compute a user's secret key.
