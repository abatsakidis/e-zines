COMPANIES SEND EMPLOYEES TO 'HACKER' WORKSHOPS
The best way to keep a hacker from breaking into a computer system from the 
outside may just be to have a hacker on the inside. That's what John Brozycki 
and Darien Ford's company figured when it paid $7,000 so they could learn to 
think like a computer interloper. "Ultimate Hacking: Hands On," a four-day 
course in Manhattan, gives them a legitimate opportunity to hack their way 
into computer systems. When they return to their regular jobs, keeping the 
network secure at a credit union in upstate New York, they'll be much better 
equipped. "You feel more confident, seeing how many of the exploits are 
done," Brozycki says, surrounded by fellow techies in a hotel conference 
room. "Once you see how they're done, you know how to prevent them."

UNCOVERING THE SECRETS OF SE LINUX: PART 2
In an uncharacteristic move, the U.S. National Security Agency recently 
released a security-enhanced version of Linux - code and all - to the open 
source community. Part 2 of this developerWorks exclusive delves deeper 
into the code, dissecting how the security_av is computed and examining 
how other SE Linux security features are invoked.

FIREWALLS GO GIGABIT
In an attempt to put load-balancing vendors out of business, both Cisco and 
CyberGuard Corp. have upped the bandwidth ante by building mind-numbing 
throughput and performance into new enterprise-level firewalls. Engineered 
to handle the new wave of high-speed links, both products rise to the task 
with multiple Ethernet, Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, 
preventing you from using "the firewall is my bottleneck" as an excuse. 
Both rack-mountable firewalls come with fail-safe features and various 
fault-tolerance levels. While they share many of the same capabilities, 
they differ in ease of configuration, management and performance.

MACNN REVIEW: NORTON PERSONAL FIREWALL
In an effort to boost its already strong standing in the field of Macintosh 
utilities, Symantec last year licensed Open Door Networks' DoorStop software 
firewall utility, resulting in the creation of Norton Personal Firewall. With the 
number of broadband Internet connections (which are typically more susceptible 
to hacking than dial-up connections) increasing daily, as well as the number of 
intrusions into networks, Symantec is positioning Norton Personal Firewall as the 
utility of choice for Mac users looking for increased security with their Internet 
connection, and in doing so is going head-to-head with Intego's already 
established NetBarrier.

LION VIRUS: HOW TO DETECT AND PREVENT
William Stearns, of the Institute for Security Technology Studies, has written 
a script called Lionfind to detect Lion. There is no removal program as yet. As 
prevention, users of BIND 4.9.8 and 8.2.3 distributions should download the 
latest patch from ISC. Users of the BIND 9.1 distribution should download 
this update.

'UNIVERSAL' KEY CLAIMED TO DISABLE MS OFFICE XP SECURITY
"Microsoft's vaunted Product Activation protection technology may not have 
been fully implemented in Office XP after all. Product keys claimed to be 
"universal" have been circulating on the Web for some weeks now, and a 
WinXP beta tester's newsgroup posting forwarded to The Register suggests 
that use of one of these keys circumvents the activation process. It is not 
at the moment possible to verify this completely. Warez copies of code 
claimed to Office XP "final" reportedly run without requiring activation if 
one of the keys is used, but those keys can't be said to be definitely 
universal until such time as they can be tested on production copies 
of Office XP sold at retail."

UN TO DEVISE STRATEGY FOR GLOBAL E-SECURITY
Delegates from the United Nations' 189 member countries this week will meet 
with representatives from the U.S. high-tech industry to devise new strategies 
for dealing with Internet crime and global e-commerce security requirements. 
However, to ensure a coherent global strategy, world leaders must be better 
educated about the need for global security standards and the threat that 
cybercrime poses to the global economy, said Percy Mangoaela, the UN 
ambassador from Lesotho.

PRIVACY GROUP CRITICIZES TIVO FOR COLLECTING INFO
The leading TV recording service has collected information about viewers - 
programs watched or recorded, remote control buttons pushed - without 
adequately informing them, a research group says. The Privacy Foundation 
was warning about the practice in a report Monday on the personalized TV 
system, which makes it easier for consumers to record and watch their 
favorite programs. Analysts expect 14 million people to be using such 
video recorders by 2004.

LESSONS IN LAPTOP SECURITY
The laptop is not only a teleworker's power tool. It's a thief magnet. Securing 
confidential or proprietary data when you're on the road or you work beyond 
the enterprise is a pressing issue. Think this is someone else's problem? Think 
again. In the U.S. in 1999, 319,000 notebook computers and 27,000 desktop 
computers valued at close to $1 billion were stolen, according to Safeware, 
the Columbus, Ohio computer insurance agency.

COMPARISON OF CLIENT METHODS TO BLOCK SPAM
"How do people deal with spam? While there are methods to address UCE at 
the server, legal, and mail client levels, the individual has only one way to 
deal with spam: through their mail client software. In this article, I will 
introduce various means of combatting junk email."

SAMBA NT DOMAIN CONTROLLER
Currently, Samba can go beyond merely emulating Windows shares to actually 
acting as the Primary Domain Controller for your Windows network. Of course, 
Samba can also become a NT domain member. In this article we shall look at 
both these options.

ENCRYPTING AN ACCESS DATABASE
You might feel discouraged and ask yourself, "Why bother with security?" Do 
not despair! Fortunately, Access enables you to encrypt a database. The 
encryption process renders the data in the database indecipherable from data 
in word processors, disk utilities, and other products capable of reading text. 
When a database is encrypted, no one can decipher any of its data.

REMOTE USERS NEED FIREWALLS TOO
Last December, a bank in Southern California received a call from an online 
customer asking why one of the bank's computers was trying to hack into 
his system. It turned out that the machine doing the hacking belonged to 
the bank's president and had been remotely commandeered by an employee. 
The president called Conqwest Inc., an IT security services firm, which is 
now rolling out firewall software across the bank's 125 internal desktop, 
laptop and remote computers. Until recently, companies thought antivirus 
and VPN technologies would keep remote worker connections safe. But as 
more workers have been accessing the Internet through broadband services 
such as cable modems, exposure to hacking attacks through those machines 
has increased.

EMAIL FILTERING: THE REAL DEAL
"Email is probably my favorite Internet related service. It's also the one that 
causes me the most problems, with regard to security. People cannot live 
without email anymore. Email is probably the most convenient form of 
communication for most of us. It's an easy way to figure out whether the 
person you want to phone in Australia is awake or not. Email also allows us 
to easily send files, from simple text documents to spreadsheets - images 
to video clips. There are extremely few companies and organizations in the 
world that have an Internet connection but do not use email. Because of 
this, most Internet spam is now delivered by email, and more importantly, 
most viruses are now spread via email."

A VIRUS THAT LEAPS PLATFORMS
A security company has identified what is believed to be the first virus with 
cross-platform abilities - it can infect both Windows and Linux operating 
systems. W32.Winux is not affecting many computers, nor is it apt to 
spread quickly, as people do not tend to share executable programs 
between machines running Linux operating systems and machines running 
Windows operating systems. Also called "Linux.Winux," W32.Winux is a non
memory resident virus. It can replicate under Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000
and Linux operating systems and it infects EXE (Windows executable) and 
ELF files (Linux executable). The infection method is not sophisticated. The 
virus overwrites the ". reloc" section of Windows executable files. If the 
.reloc section size is not large enough to hold the virus body, the file is 
not infected. It does not destroy data but can impact an infected 
machine's performance due to the background activity of the virus.

SECURITY BREACHES IN IT DIVISIONS
More than 35% of IT departments have experienced unauthorised access to 
computer systems, with half of the incidents made up of internal breaches, 
a survey has found.

SECURITY SOLUTIONS IN THE REAL WORLD
The most secure computer system is the one that's unplugged and buried 10 
feet underground, according to security expert Paul Raines. But there are 
specific steps a company can take to reduce security threats to their live 
systems - whether from external hackers or disgruntled IT workers. Raines, 
head of global information risk management for Barclays Capital, laid out 
those steps to security professionals here at the eSecurity Conference & 
Exposition in his session entitled, "Security In the Real World."

EXPERTS DEBATE SEVERITY OF 'WINUX' VIRUSS
Even though there have been no reported cases of infection by the virus - 
which is incapable of spreading itself via the Internet or e-mail - some anti-
virus vendors hailed the program, known variously as "Winux" and "Lindose," 
as marking the beginning of a new era of virus writing. "It's only interesting 
in the sense that it shows virus writers are becoming more interested in 
Linux," said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos Inc., 
a British anti-virus vendor with U.S. headquarters in Wakefield, Mass. "It's 
very simple and not likely to spread on any big scale. Its real effect is 
wasting people's time."

CHECK POINT FIREWALL-1 ON LINUX, PART THREE
This is the third and final article in a series devoted to the exploration of 
Check Point Firewall-1 for Linux. In the first article we discussed single 
and multisystem installation and post-installation tasks. The second article 
explored Firewall-1 concepts such as network objects, firewall rules, address 
translation rules, and NAT, as well as features and limitations of Firewall-1. In 
this installment, we will go over aspects of Firewall-1 such as file and directory 
layout, rulesets, migrating existing Firewall-1 installations to Linux, and backup 
and standby configurations.

WELSH HACKER FACES JAIL SENTENCE
A hacker who was tracked down to his home in a tiny village in Wales has 
admitted to hacking into websites between February and March last year 
for his own gain and may now face a jail sentence. In a pre-trial hearing 
in court yesterday, 19-year-old computer science student Raphael Gray 
admitted hacking into the websites of companies such as nettrading, 
salesgate, feelgoodfalls, mostorefront, albionsmo and the American 
Society of Clinical Pathologists. He also admitted to stealing credit 
card information from the exploited sites, using the details for his 
own gain and offering to supply them to other criminals.

DEVELOPING A SUCCESSFUL INFORMATION SECURITY PROCESS
Part of any organization's information security program for protecting

WAR DRIVING - THE LATEST HACKER FAD
The introduction of wireless networking has spawned a fresh sub-culture in the 
digital underground. It has brought script kiddies out of their bedrooms and onto 
the roads. War dialling, the hacking practice of phoning up every extension of a 
corporate phone network until the number associated with a firm's modem bank 
is hit upon, has been replaced by war driving with the introduction of wireless 
LANS. Our source tell us that war driving, which is apparently particular popular 
in Silicon Valley, involves motoring between likely target firms with a PC fitted 
with a LAN card and trying to break into their networks. Giving the flakey state 
of wireless security models this is normally childishly simple with even basic 
cracking tools.

CEBIT - HACKERS GIVE SIEMENS NET FILTER MOCK 'AWARD'
The German hackers' group Chaos Computer Club (CCC) has presented its 
annual satiric Chaos CeBIT Award, at the CeBIT 2001 trade show, to Siemens

Siemens's "special services" in the area of "Internet censorship and obstacles 
to communication." SmartFilter is a Web filtering tool based on a "control list" 
of Web site categories and blocked sites. The software is implemented on 
Siemens's internal servers, and is also available for sale to external customers.

HACKERS WORSE THAN TERRORISTS - ROBIN COOK
Hackers are a greater threat than terrorists, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook

made the claims in a debate on the work of the intelligence services. But 
where have we heard these claims before? Ah, yes the US National Security 
Agency, whose director Air Force General Michael Hayden said last November: 
"The virtual battlefield has "taken on a dimension within which we will conduct

OPENHACK: DID HE WIN OR NOT?
A hacker is claming that he has won Argus' ballyhooed OpenHack III 
competition by cracking its much-vaunted PitBull security system. Argus 
concedes the crack, but isn't awarding the promised big cash prize. The 
same challenge was offered at the European technology conference CeBit 
this week. This time, one person says he was able to crack the system. 
But he evidently missed the deadline. A hacker calling himself Bladez won't 
receive the $4,250 prize offered by Argus because he says he misunderstood 
what time the competition ended and was under the impression that he had 
a few hours left to work. Bladez said that he is worried that Argus Systems 
will hail the CeBit competition as another success or "will simply stay quiet 
and thrive off their OpenHack coverage. In fact, an Argus Systems 
employee told me there would probably be no press release, though 
it wasn't clear if this was because of my hack or not."

ELRON IM PRODUCTS VULNERABILITY
At least two products of the Elron Internet Manager family of tools contain 
directory traversal vulnerabilities. The problem exists in the following 
products:
- IM Message Inspector
- IM Anti-Virus
Elron Internet Manager products that are not vulnerable are:
- IM Firewall
If the IM Web Inspector comes with Elron Software's proprietary web server 
as well, it is undoubtedly vulnerable as well.

The Raptor firewall is vulnerability for forwarding http request on other port 
numbers than 80, if a rule allows http traffic.Redirect rules does not affect 
this problem. When an extern or internal client, configures itself to use the 
nearest interface as proxy, it's possible to access other ports that 80 on 
the target host.

BEA WEBLOGIC UNICODE DIRECTORY BROWSING
By requesting a URL and ending it with one of the following unicode 
representations: %00, %2e, %2f or %5c, it is possible to bypass the 
listing of the default document (eg. index.html) and browse the content 
of the web folders.

PROBLEMS WITH WEBLOGIC 4.5.1 AND 5.1
It is interesting to note that similar (in fact, worse) behaviour is exhibited in 
both Weblogic 4.5.1 and 5.1. Appending a '%00' to the end of a .jsp request 
retrieves the source of the jsp.

LINUX MANDRAKE - OPENSSH UPDATE
There are several weaknesses in various implementations of the SSH protocols. 
When exploited, they let the attacker obtain sensitive information by passively 
monitoring encrypted SSH sessions. The information can later be used to speed 
up brute-force attacks on passwords, including the initial login password and 
other passwords appearing in interactive SSH sessions, such as those used 
with su. Versions of OpenSSH 2.5.2 and later have been fixed to reduce the 
impact of these traffic analysis problems, and as such all Linux- Mandrake 
users are encouraged to upgrade their version of openssh immediately.

ANACONDA CLIPPER VULNERABILITY
Comment: '..' and '/' are not filtered while processing user input, so it is 
possible to enter arbitrary values to retreive files from remote sever, 
which should not be accessible normally (for ex., /etc/passwd).
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/985727518,50822,.shtml


SOLARIS /USR/BIN/TIP VULNERABILITY
The tip program is installed setuid uucp by default in Solaris, it contains a 
vulnerability in handling data from enviroment variables, if this variable 
exceeds predefined lenght an exploitable stack overflow can occur. 
Through exploiting this vulnerability an attacker can gain effective 
uid uucp and through that root.

IMMUNIX OS SECURITY ADVISORY: KERNEL
The 2.2.19 kernel release fixes numerous security problems including the 
ptrace/execve race condition bug that was reported by Wojciech Purczynski.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/985781896,12557,.shtml


CONECTIVA LINUX - LICQ UPDATE
"licq" is a very popular ICQ graphical client. Previous versions have two 
vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a remote attacker to execute 
arbitrary commands on the client host. The first vulnerability is a buffer 
overflow in a log function. The second vulnerability consists in the use 
of the system() function to invoke an external browser when an URL is 
received. This function will expand and interpret shell characters and 
this could be used to execute commands on behalf of the user running licq.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/985781950,25662,.shtml


LINUX MANDRAKE - VIM UPDATE
Users could embed malicious VIM control codes into a file, and as soon as 
any user opened that file in vim-enhanced or vim-X11 with the status line 
option enabled in .vimrc, the commands would be executed as that user.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/985781974,91775,.shtml


SONICWALL IKE PRE-SHARED KEY LENGTH BUG
The limitation of using only a 48 byte key as opposed to using a full 128 
byte key degrades the overall security of the firewall.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/985782130,58962,.shtml


SYMANTEC RESPONSE REGARDING RAPTOR BUG
The first point we would like to make is that although we do agree with the 
authors as it relates to the security implication of the described HTTP 
functionality we do not accept the assertion that this is a product related 
issue with the Raptor Firewall (HTTP proxy). Rather, our Raptor Firewall HTTP 
proxy is RFC-compliant, and as such it is behaving consistently with the 
specification as described in RFC 2616. From a pure protocol perspective, 
this is a valid HTTP connection and thus the traffic is being allowed through 
the firewall with a proper rule. However, recognizing the security impact of 
this configuration, the Raptor Firewall provides you with the capability to 
shut down this functionality by setting a configuration option (http.noproxy) 
through our configuration files or the RMC.

PROBLEMS WITH DCOM VB T-SQL DEBUGGER
Microsoft Developer Studio version 6 installs a world-launchable DCOM object, 
known as the VB T-SQL Debugger, which contains an exploitable buffer overflow.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/985782436,4158,.shtml


MYSQL 3.23.36 FIXES SECURITY HOLES
This release should fix the final bugs we accidently got into 3.23.34 and a long 
security bug that has been in MySQL a long time! The main fixed bugs are that 
UPDATE didn't always use keys when updating on something not based on a 
primary key and that 'affected rows' wasn't returned to the client if the mysqld 
server wasn't compiled with support for transactions.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/985782554,94105,.shtml


VPN3000 CONCENTRATOR TELNET VULNERABILITY
Sending a flood of data to the SSL or regular telnet port can cause the Cisco
VPN 3000 series concentrators to reboot. After rebooting, the equipment would 
function normally until the flood of data is sent again. To remove the vulnerability, 
Cisco is offering free software upgrades to revision 3.0.00 for all affected 
platforms. The defect is described in DDTS record CSCds90807.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/985819001,59759,.shtml


INFRAMAIL DENIAL OF SERVICE VULNERABILITY
There exists a paring problem in the handling of 302 pages by the server 
serving both the webpages and the administration interface for the 
members of the Inframail product family. This allows for a DoS against the 
system through a malformed POST request consisting of a space followed 
by a long string (276 bytes or more) of characters. The running services will 
freeze and the program will need to be restarted to regain full functionality.

COMPUTER WORMS: FLASHBACK TO EARLY 90S? - [28.03.2001]

With more than two thousand new computer viruses rearing their ugly heads 
each month, it's the worms among them that keep "hacker trackers" up at 
night. Unlike simple viruses, which spread from file to file in one computer, 
worms live short but spectacular lives, inflicting major damage quickly 
because they use the network to spread from computer to computer. 
Now that network operating systems have been available for some time, 
there is mounting concern among Internet security experts that the ever
increasing availability of information on the "guts" of network operating 
systems gives hackers clues to break in and compromise a network's security.

FORENSICS EXPLORERS INTRODUCES NETINFORMANT - [30.03.2001]

Forensics Explorers introduces NetInformant, a suite of products that go far 
beyond other network security systems and solves problems most network 
security software cannot even detect. In addition, NetInformant is the only 
network security system that can guard against the most dangerous and 
difficult to detect threats: threats from an organizations trusted employees, 
clients and strategic partners, the people who operate behind the firewall.
While most network security software merely tracks network activity and 
compares it to a list of known security risks, or calculates whether specific 
activity is statistically unusual, NetInformant audits and evaluates all 
network activity, flags network security management when potential 
client-specified issues arise, and produces action items which can be 
implemented immediately.

LIONFIND 0.1

Lion is a new worm, that is very similar to the Ramen worm. However, this worm 
is much more dangerous and should be taken seriously. It infects Linux machines 
with the BIND DNS server running. It is known to infect BIND version(s) 8.2, 
8.2-P1, 8.2.1, 8.2.2-Px. BIND 8.2.3-REL and BIND 9 are not vulnerable. The BIND 
vulnerability is the TSIG vulnerability that was reported back on January 29, 2001. 
SANS developed a utility called Lionfind that will detect the Lion files on an 
infected system. Simply download it, uncompress it, and run lionfind. It will list 
which of the suspect files is on the system.
