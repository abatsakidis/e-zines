 “shallow breathing”

 these are the screams that echo in the most crowded of halls.  they bounce 
 off all the walls, the ceiling, the floor.  spinning, dancing around your 
 head.  running straight through your cranium.  a blue shot of pain.  mental 
 shutdown.  crumbling, embracing everything and nothing.  he wants to run up 
 to you and smell and taste you.  he cant touch you.  he sure as hell cant 
 touch you.  his eyes bore holes, though.  into the faces of every beautiful 
 girl.  into the chests of every handsome young man.  his eyes bore holes 
 through countless feet of solid steel.

 “I abstain”

 relatively nothing can go wrong while you’re asleep.  unless you’re a 
 sleepwalker.  then you could urinate in the refrigerator or fall out the 
 window or something like that.  but, otherwise, you’re pretty safe when 
 you’re asleep.  if you fortunate enough, you wont even remember your 
 nightmares.  even though you actually control your nightmares, you never 
 really think about that while they’re going on.  you just sorta go along 
 with it, like its a movie or something.  when that evil clown is chasing you 
 through your attic, you just don’t say, hey, what the hell is this?  I’m not 
 afraid of clowns. and then you just pop his nose and he dies.  you don’t 
 think of that.  you just fucking run around until you wake up, which 
 generally happens just as the evil clown is about to finally catch you.  so, 
 in conclusion, look both ways before crossing the road.

 “fact leaves its ghost”

 he stands in front of the diner with his ski mask on and his gun drawn.  
 this will be easy.  he walks in the door and shoots the first child you sees 
 right in the face.  people start screaming.  some jump under the tables.  
 some are crying.  “empty your fucking pockets... NOW!”  they all empty their 
 pockets.  he has one of the employees empty the cash register, then he walks 
 out the front door.
