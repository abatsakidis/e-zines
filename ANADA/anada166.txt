 Can't think of a Title

 I live in a world of cloning
 a sea of madness all around
 the fakeness swallows me whole
 and I die as I see your soul...

 my life is always chaotic
 insanity hiding the truth
 the tension I hide inside
 is beginning to seep through...

 I cry out when I see reality
 nonsense surrounding us all
 I try to laugh at the shallowness
 but I'm always going to know...


 Human Flesh

 You stick yourself 
 to the face
 of what human remains
 
 you kill yourself
 with a devils grin
 a pleading cry
 for this shame

 insects crawl through your skull
 the light is growing dim
 a gunshot fires and misses us all
 except for one

 he holds the truth



 Happiness is fake.  
 Sadness is hidden.  
 Forever's a lie.  
 And Love is forbidden.

 My life is a game.
 My friends are a shame.
 I've reached my destiny.
 But I don't know where to begin.

 Everything is superficial.
 The people have become so shallow.
 I am drowning in other's lies.
 The truth has become a sin.

 I begin to love someone.
 But their feelings are untrue.
 We hold back what we feel.
 Until someone will listen.
