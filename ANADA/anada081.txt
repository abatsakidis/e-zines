 The acid that's been sitting has eaten through.
 I expected it to, just not so soon.
 I feel enlightenment with these little red worlds,
 each one contributing to a universal scale.
 If I'm the one that questions the conviction,
 that makes you the one that puts me in this prison.
 I can't help but blame myself, if I was the one
 to ask for the experience.
 I can sense your discouragment and your wonder
 at how I can seek out this poison
 how can I scream these words
 Everything is numb when I'm flying with birds
 
 I put my hero into a song
 And I heard the soft melodies echoing
 the other time that felt so wrong
 The details are secondary
 It's whats on the list that counts
 and with the peaks and the valleys
 I have hope in that nothing will save me
 We'll all skim by on what we know
 and save the rest for later
 When time is time again
 and I'm not just wasting it
