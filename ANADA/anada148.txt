        there once was a ferret named frank.  he was a ferret that lived out
 in the wild so he wasn't descented.  so he stunk.  he was part skunk and
 part mink, like all ferrets are.  but all the other ferrets would make fun
 of him because he smelled worse than any of the other ferrets.

        one day, frank the ferret was listening to his atom and his package
 cd and the song "avenger" gave him a great idea.  he'd go around the forest
 and collect pieces of wood and build a giant crane out of these pieces of
 wood.  then, whenever any of the other ferrets gave him any guff, he'd use
 his crane to pick them up and throw them in the ocean, just like in the atom
 and his package song.

        it took frank like 5 weeks, 3 days, 16 hours, 43 minutes and 2
 seconds to make his crane.

        a few days after he had finished making his crane, this mean ferret
 named bruce came up to frank the ferret and said, "hey stinky, you're really
 stinky!  ha ha ha ha ha!"

        frank the ferret responed, "i may be stinky, but you totally reek of
 heinousity!"

        then frank got behind the controls of his crane, picked up bruce the
 mean ferret and threw him into the ocean.  then, frank the ferret went back
 to his house to drink cherry coke and eat a cheeseburger.
