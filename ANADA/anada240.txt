 It was cold outside, but I wasn't cold...
 Vodka has a way of warming you up so that the frosty numbness of winter 
 disappears and your body is full of an inner radiance, cursing through your 
 veins.
 I wasn't cold at all.

 Sometimes when you stand up too fast it takes your eyes a minute to catch up
 For three hours my eyes didn't catch up.
 "Dude, this is awesome!  My eyes are...slow..."

 My eyes were slow and the tears made them blurry...
 I was crying, can't tell you why because reason escapes me
 Why have reason, good old rational reason, when you could have vodka 
 instead?

 A word of advice: avoid being in cars after you've been drinking--motion 
 sickness is awful.

 Bile rising in my throat,
 Clamped hand over my mouth
 "We've got a situation here"
 Alcoholic stomach acid forced through my hands
 I had to throw away my gloves....
 I miss my gloves.
