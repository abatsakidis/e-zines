 My fingers touch the glass.  Mirror.  Reflection.  Bang.  Fist punches
 through it, shards make blood.  The whole mirror world, and my reflection
 lives there.  It hasn't been around as long as me... how come it can live
 there and I can't?  I was here first.  The world behind the glass is mine, I
 discovered it.  I'm nauseous.  My hand is bloody.  The shards of the
 wonderful world I've shattered look up at me.  I can see all your faces.
 Blood drips from my hand onto the pieces of the mirror.  You're all crying
 now.  My reflection is broken.  The stronger I become, the faster I'm
 killing myself.  Why can't I look away?
