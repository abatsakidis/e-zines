 Females, as I said before,
 never quite state their intentions
 especially not to poor
 me, and I am left to my guesses and predictions;
 I only wait for someone to shut the door
 and stop the inevitable from happening?
 It's scary how much like you I am.
 Or vice versa. I was here first though,
 so therefore, I can
 claim the title.
 But would I want it?
 Perhaps not.
 Or maybe I will pull a fit
 and cause chaos and destruction
 to compliment every bit
 of me.
 And so the age-old question falls
 to yet another unsuspecting victim;
 but wait, is she aware of what calls
 and beckons her? Probably, but
 ignoring it, or pushing it aside
 is easier. Terribly easier.
 Maybe, if time passes faster
 things will fall into place
 that will ensure more and more
 fun and happiness to reign
 but then again, luckiness is feigned
 by me, never affects me.
 What could I possibly do for someone
 such as her? Although, in baseball,
 inter-league play is now permitted;
 Minor League is not to play Major League; is it?
 Personalities, appearances and facades.
