        Religious people have a way of knowing what kind of things the devil
 digs.  Ironic, that, since as holy rollers they should be so far removed
 from evil as to not have any clue what Satan does in his spare time.  Rock
 music, they say, is the devil's work.  Idle hands and idle minds are the
 devil's playthings.  Those are the most common ones, but the list is kind of
 incomplete.  I'll take this moment just to ensure that any uninformed
 religious people out there are fully informed by what the Devil is up to
 these days.  On with the list.

        Eggplant is the Devil's vegetable. 

        The Dallas Cowboys are the Devil's football team. 

        The Sound of Music is the Devil's movie. 

        New Jersey is the Devil's state. 

        Saltines are the Devil's crackers. 

        Pintos are the Devil's cars. 

        Microsoft is the Devil's computer company. 

        Crest is the Devil's toothpaste. 

        Argon is the Devil's gas. 

        Croquet is the Devil's sport. 

        Greg Harrison is the Devil's neighbor. 

        Doggy style is the Devils preferred sexual position. 

        Good Housekeeping is the Devil's Magazine. 

        Walker Texas Ranger is the Devil's TV show. 

        10 is the Devil's shoe size. 

        Tuesday is the Devil's day. 

        The left upper bicuspid is the Devil's tooth. 

        The gerbil is the Devil's pet. 

        Vanilla Ice is the Devil's rapper. 

        An idle weiner is the Devil's sex organ. 

        Billy Graham is the Devil's golf partner. 

        My Ex-Girlfriend-Turned-Evil-Backstabbing-Ho is the Devil's bitch
 (but I'm not bitter!)

        I hope that this helps you to live a more pious life.
