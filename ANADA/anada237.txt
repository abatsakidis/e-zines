        Goddamn, Crissy was so annoying.  I wish she would just shut up so we
 could go to sleep.  I'd been nodding off for the last goddamnknowshowlong
 but instead of letting me sleep, the dumb bitch keeps waking me up!  Fuck,
 I'm tired and cranky and PLEASE LET ME GO TO SLEEP.

        Fantastic, she's worn herself out and it's time for us to go to bed.
 Finally.  I am welcoming sleep with open arms and oh the sweet thoughts of
 it enveloping me and carrying away from this monstrosity of a sleepover and
 into the sweet bliss off dreamlan...

        CHRIST, I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANYBODY SNORE SO LOUD IN MY LIFE.  OH MY
 GOD I WILL NEVER SLEEP.  That's okay, I'll sleep through it, I'm really
 fucking tired.  Close eyes.  Ignore the 90 decibels rattling my brain.  I'm
 counting sheep, I'm envisioning peaceful pastures of posies, I'm half-
 meditating.  My eyes pop open.  I stare at the clock.

        2:30... 4... 5:45...

        I will never stay over at Crissy's house again.

        Heidi's house is so creaky.  Her dad is this big logger-looking guy
 and has two pornos in his top dresser drawer: "Debbie does Delta Airlines"
 and "For Your Thighs Only."  There are dead animals stuffed and hung on
 so many walls.  This isn't much different from my Grandma's house, really.

        I wake up from my sound sleep at 2am to the sound of crazy-sounding
 smoke alarms.  But nobody else is waking up?  Sure, the smoke alarms sound
 REALLY QUIET but SOMEONE ELSE MUST HEAR THEM, right?  I get up and start
 walking around the house, trying to find the smoke alarm that is letting off
 that sickening WEEEA-WEEEA-WEEEA-WEEEA.

        This is scary.  Heidi's house could be burning down!  Where the fuck
 is that smoke alarm... and where is the smoke?  Where is the fire?  I cross
 back into the bedroom and the noise gets louder.  Ohmygod... panic.  It
 seems to be coming from over there by the closet.  I tiptoe closer... the
 noise gets louder... but not from the closet.  NEXT to the closet.  I look
 down at the source of the awful wailing to see two guinea pigs doing god
 knows what and making that excruciating WEEEA-WEEEA-WEEEA noise while doing
 it.  I grumble and go back to bed.

        I spend every weekend at Jen's house.  Her family is rich, mine is
 poor.  She is easily bored and irritated by the closeness of my family and
 much prefers her house, where we are free to do god knows what in the
 basement and to sneak out easily in the middle of the night.  Plus, she has
 all of the New Kids On The Block dolls--with both outfits even.

        She lives with her dad now with the basement all to herself.  Her
 uncle lives there too, he's in a wheelchair and missing a leg and stuff, but
 he's hilarious and awesome.  She's got a couple of cats, Jezus and Acid.

        We go to sleep in that gigantic waterbed of hers.  It's always turned
 up way too warm and makes me sweat to death unless I sleep hanging off of it
 somehow.  This makes it kinda tricky for me to fall asleep... along with all
 that noise upstairs.

        I hear some moaning and banging around and my heart nearly stops.  Is
 her uncle okay?  There've been plenty of close calls before.  I hear a lot
 of running around and voices.  Am I going to be spending the night when her
 uncle passes on?  Will Jen break down?  Will I actually be forced to be a
 real friend for the first time in three years and see some real emotion?

        The noises subside.  Who knows what went on up there, but apparently
 everything is fine now.  Maybe someday, something will happen and Jen and I
 will have to be real people with each other.
