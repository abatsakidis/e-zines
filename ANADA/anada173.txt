        Y'know how your supposed to learn something every day?  Well I
 don't... but I go through phases when I do.  I just learned the prime reason
 why the Holocaust was so easy to kindle in the tarnished hearts of the
 German people.  Shit.  And Jews.

        For many, many centuries in Germany the Jew has been portrayed as
 being so low as to eat pig shit.  In fact, they draw from the Kosher laws
 that they actually worship the pig and the shit it produces!  It's a symptom
 of the German obsession with shit.  They equate money to shit.  So they
 equate the caricature of greedy Jews as Jews loving shit.  If you think
 about it you can hear the still used phrases that correlate with feces.
 "Rolling in it," "He's got piles of it," "Filthy rich" are all born of Anti-
 Semitism and the Germanic disgust of waste matter.

        It may sound far fetched but there are still sculptures on public
 buildings and monuments clearly depicting hook-nosed Jews gaping hungrily as
 over-sized hogs shit into their mouths.  So all Hitler had to do was
 reignite the gut-felt disgust the Germans had of this Jewish legend and re-
 enforce it by showing "Jews" living in filthy houses "despite being very
 rich" and Bob's your Uncle, 6 million dead.  "6 million waste products
 disposed of."  Fucking hell, they even killed them in showers!  The
 deliberate symbolism and irony is crippling!

        It just makes it that bit easier to see how soldiers found it mind-
 bendingly unmoving to throw fully-conscious little Jewish kids into
 incinerators where their parents' bodies were already disintegrating.

        Now the inevitable question about the cause of this shit/Jew myth
 trundles up behind us and bellows into our ear, "WHY?  WHAT THE HELL IS
 THEIR PROBLEM?!!?"  Fuck knows.

        We all have our national obsessions that we can trace throughout
 history.  The British obsession is obviously sex and sexuality, galvanized
 with particular vigour during the Victorian era, the French obsession is
 with aesthetics, the Italian obsession is with respect/pride, the US
 obsession is with the US, the Spanish obsession is dancing and the Japanese
 obsession is with etiquette.  Well I'm not going to mention every fucking
 country but you know what I mean.  I also know that they are caricatures in
 themselves but _you_ try describing a national personality/trait and not
 employ caricatures.

        They are all, because they're obsessions, destructive or negative
 (except for the Spanish and dancing) but few are so outright dangerous as
 viewing, in all seriousness, millions of people who share a particular
 religion as sub-human, literally shit-eating scum.  Why Germans?

        It's not as if they've HAD a recognised country as such for more than
 about 200 years.  Germany was for the majority of the A.D. years a bunch of
 principalities (much like Italy also was) that, although they traded with
 each other, had no tangible political link.  I'm not quite sure when or how
 they amalgamated into one country but my guess is it was something to do
 with a royal bloodline bottleneck which meant that all the baronies or
 territories came under one fella's rule.  Either that or some war made them
 all band together and they stuck.  They were largely known as Prussians and
 before then Goths so they do have historical kindred links.  Obviously
 Austria and, to some extent, Switzerland have mainly Germanic genealogy but,
 as far as I'm aware, it was in what is now Germany that the Jew/shit
 correlation was most visibly expressed.

        I mean how can you attach a moral framework to shit?  It involves an
 act that we ALL do, OK it contributed to the death of Elvis (he should have
 known that eating 12 hamburgers in a sitting causes constipation), but it's,
 like, you can't have an evil shit.  An evil-smelling one, but not a
 spiritually flawed, hell-bound, evil stool.  The end result can't be morally
 ranked!  Mother Theresa had shits, and they stunk too, almost as bad as SHE
 will by now (well it's been 3 years).

        There is one level of shitting that is emotionally attached and
 that's fear.  You're dead nervous before some event and you get the shits or
 you're about to be hung, drawn and quarter by some close relatives and you
 shit yourself.  You PISS yourself laughing, that's positive, but you shit
 yourself with fear.  May be that's got something to do with it.

        Still you don't generally see the connection between a negative
 connotation to a bodily function and genocide.

        The only thing that'll get me obsessed with shit is if I had a white
 one like some dogs have.  Now that would change my life!
