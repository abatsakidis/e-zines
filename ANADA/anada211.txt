        and keep your face on as long as you want or until you can walk into
 a room and look for that person first or maybe not.  not sure that would
 even constitute a showing, but maybe.

        j.d. salinger must die and not even because of holden.  only the
 glasses; especially seymour. 

        can't everyone get along and not worry about what one another is
 thinking so much?  sounds irrational from here.  everyone that self-
 conscious though?  think so, or would like to think so.  it would make
 everything more human and comfortable.

        used to have a comment for everything, remember?  well, still do, but
 relearned the fine art of repression.  pushing things so far down that they 
 are right below the surface just as a reminder of having nothing to say.  so 
 much of nothing to say.  sometimes miss it.  more than anyone will ever
 know.  and why not? so  much changed. 

        to whom this is aimed to concern.  or want this too concern.  the 
 reader/decider if that makes sense.  tell me you don't want anymore, please. 
 at least when its not good because honesty eases everything.  and failure 
 eases everything more.  dont know why.  just do.  or contradiction maybe. 
 whatever makes more sense.

        and not crazy.  just awkward.  a series of awkward moments; thats
 life.  not complaining though.  sometimes they're amazing.  most of the
 time.  even when they dont seem so at the time.  looking back on just
 sitting there with people.  silently.  worring about thoughts.  but again
 contention.  contention to be awkward is almost perfect.
