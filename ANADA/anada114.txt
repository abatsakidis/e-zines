        this is a story for anada.  it starts here.

        see it begins in a little room or a large room depending on your
 standards and experience if you lived in a gigantic mansion all your life we
 would be quite compressed here in this room, by your standards.

        in this room there are sounds like tv news and oldies on the radiio
 and click clack computer keyboard keys.  the little orange car found its way
 in beside the business card and the telephone and declared itself home.

        but soon the business card moved back to where it should be, beneith
 computer screen, resting on the 'curtis command center'.  other wise known
 as CCC he had quite a temper and funny curly hair that expanded.

        soon the pencil decided it did not fit in among these things.  they
 did not under stand it, and it did not understand them and it wanted to move
 the neat keyboard upstairs so it could watch dark ages all day long.

        but it could not make it to heaven or the promise land and so it died
 a homeless pencil.  with pink stripes.  unsharpened. and with a broken
 eraser.

        the end.
