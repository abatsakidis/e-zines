 Fortress of silence, walls of nothing constructed around me.
 I wore the armor of obscurity, held the sword of insanity.
 There I stood sentinel, wary of the incursion of alien emotions.
 Worldly matters crashed like waves against the buttress of my indifference.
 I was closed off, locked away from caring.
 My castle moved with me through the toils of life.

 There you were, buffeted by tides of media-programmed zombies.
 Multitudes of deathless creatures attacked with banalities.
 You found refuge in my solid nonexistence.
 Clinging to my barriers, you shouted your resolve.
 I heard your voice and it harmonized with my solitude.
 I breached the walls and allowed you inside.

 Here we are in our fortress of silence.
 Blending our identities into one whole.
 We are becoming a unit, reinforcing ourselves.
 Guarding the walls, expanding our space.
 Preparing for the day we need depart this place,
 and lay claim to the world outside.
