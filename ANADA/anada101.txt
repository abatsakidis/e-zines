        her love was so sweet, so pure, so real.  she cared for me like any
 best friend would.  she made me smile, made me laugh, made me truly happy.
 she took care of my problems, fixed my mistakes.  she allowed me to hide
 under her shield.  she helped me when i was down.  made me high once again.
 she cured my sadness, my pain, and my sorrow.  she killed my misery.  she
 made me feel so good.  

        Mary Jane was my own goddess.  

        She loved me more than anyone could.

        She was my perfect drug.

        but then she changed and so i changed.  she became posessive as she
 began to control me.  as she began to "take care of my problems" I was
 actually avoiding my problems.  she put things in my mind and ate right
 through it.  she told me to betray my real friends for her.  she told me to
 put anything and everything aside just for her.  what made me hate her
 entirely is when my one true friend used her as an excuse for the things she
 said.  My best friend told me how ugly I was, how poor I was, how fat I was,
 and basically how worthless of a human being I was.  she told me this and
 then blamed it on Mary Jane.  If she had the common courtesy to apologize
 then I think she knew exactly what she was saying to me.  

        Mary Jane began to kill me.  

        She began to hate me.

        She became my worst drug.
