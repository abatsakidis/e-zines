        I’ve been asked by a couple of friends why the hell I used that
 photograph for my staff page.  In case you haven’t seen it go there now
 before reading the rest.  It ain’t me, by the way.  This was a fella I found
 completely by chance and was most amused to see he was a scientist of all
 things.  I’m not gonna name him obviously or I’d imagine I’d  have to take
 up prostitution to pay off the legal fees but yes, he’s a scientist.

        Not only that but I’m pretty pissed off I can’t tell you his name as
 that’s hilarious as well when you read it out loud and look at the picture 
 simultaneously.  You’d think he was called something like Naseem, or Dimitri 
 or Carlos, and I’m sure he wishes he was too, but fortunately for my 
 laughing muscles he’s called something very different.  If you want to you 
 can email me with guesses for what you think he’s called and I’ll reply with 
 the answer (I think that’s legal).

        Why did I choose it?  It’s fucking hilarious.  I just love his
 expression; a kind of smug, swashbuckling look with that quite phenomenal
 hair and the magnificent porn star moustache.  But it’s juxtaposed with
 those utterly square clothes.  And he’s wearing them completely without
 irony.  It just kills me.  If you can, try to blow the photo up as when you
 look away and look back you almost involuntarily find a smile appear on your
 face.  The bigger, the better.

        I generally try not to take the piss out of people as I’ve got
 nothing to be proud of and, to be honest, I’m not really taking the piss out
 him either.  I kind of admire his obvious obliviousness to his absurdity.
 He quite definitely loves looking like that.  His hair isn’t an accident,
 nor his moustache and his expression certainly isn’t.  He chooses his own
 clothes and he chose to be photographed in those clothes and he’s damned
 comfortable with those decisions thank you very much.  Fantastic.

        I want to know what his girlfriend/wife (/boyfriend?) looks like.
 Equally bizarre?  I’d like to think she’s a cross between Lara Croft (Tomb
 Raider) and Paul from The Wonder Years.  Or maybe she’s a hideous mix of the
 black female presenter on Sesame Street and Ralf Malf from Happy Days.
 Imagine that!  Better still, imagine the kids!!!
