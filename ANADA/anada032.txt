 Subject: Congratulations! You've been selected to party!


 Hey:

        If you're receiving this letter, that means you've been selected from
 a database of 52 billion people to come to a kegger that's being held at
 BILLS HOUSE on Saturday, April 29th!  That's right!  Kegger!  Bill's house!!
 YEAH

        Our dear friend Nick, some of you may or may not know him, is joining
 the Navy :0(  But that means we get to throw a huge bash for him before he
 goes ahead and commits his entire life to a unsympathetic war machine that
 will cause the destruction of the world as we know it!!  CAN I GET A WHOOP
 WHOOP!?!?

        Some of you knew about this, some of you are thinkin "cool, free
 beer", and some of you are gonna delete this email, and yet again some of
 you are gonna fwd it to your friends, and their FRIENDS FRIENDS, which I
 advise you DO!  But last but not least, some of you are gonna show up at
 this party, and get TRASHED!  Which I also advise you do!  There will be
 food, music, entertainment, and free beer!  I'm also gonna get Nick so
 wasted, that maybe he'll strip in front of everyone, then go jump in the ice
 cold river behind my house!

        So go ahead, and reply to this letter, tell me if you're gonna come,
 and tell me who you're also inviting.  I just want to know who's gonna come,
 whether you know Nick or not, try and make it.  Cuz really, he's such a
 great guy, I'm sure you'll miss him.  I know I will!

        PS: only invite cool people who don't suck

       PPS: This event is already funded, but any donation would do wonders
            in freeing up the pockets of the people who are buying the beer
            and *coughcough* other forms of entertainment :D

      PPPS: Please please please reply and tell me who's all comin, cuz I
            have to know how much beer to buy and if you need directions or
            not!  One or TWO KEGS???

     PPPPS: Be prepared to crash at said house, unless you have a DD
            (designated driver), cuz I wont be responsible for your ass dyin
            on the long twisty road to my pad.
