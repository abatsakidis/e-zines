 I think you should constantly reevaluate your beliefs. It is my firm
 belief that people shouldn't hold firm beliefs. The pope should become
 an atheist for a day. Like our beliefs, reality can potentially be more
 fluid than we typically allow.

 white girl,
 black glasses,
 light blond hair,
 green shirt,
 blue jeans,
 and a lot of silver
 writing with a green pen -- almost matching her shirt
 finding it hard to pay attention
 (as am i)
 tedious note-taking
 neat penmanship
 perfect
 probably a psych major -- they're like that
 they're deep like a puddle
 and buy into too much too quickly
 theorytheorytheory
 she must be cold
 shifty and a bit restless
 hunched over her perfect notebook
 she'll marry young
 (but not too young)
 and have a secure future
 with a fashionable amount of children
 she's a psych-major
 but i'm a major-psychic
 she's boring
 and i'm bored
 we should date.

 breezy, cool on the skin, euphoric wind, soft crystal spirits
 refreshing day, not crushed by weight today (bad poetry can't describe this)
 clean air making everything pure, dissolve into white
 (kill me quick because this is love exploding and I want it forever)
 newborn world
 like you once were.
 
 baggy pants computer clown
 playing bad rusty harmonica
 to a dark room
 always soliciting a response
 from a creative graveyard
 chalk stained hands that don't know that class is over
    "here lies bad taste
     good riddance, we love you"
  he killed it with community standards
  and the politician masses
  pocket protectors, intolerance
  and a pair of cracked glasses.
 
 arguments for the existence of god abuse rules of logic and clever
 linguistics to produce surface-level magic tricks. Abracadabra, god
 exists (and the philosopher pulls god out of a hat). These arguments
 seem to serve as play-things for philosophers (albeit interesting play-
 things)
 Atheist and theists aren't made by logical arguments. If god's existence
 could be proved religion and faith would come to an end
 and you will have ultimately committed deicide.

 god, i love her
 perhaps i fall in love too easily
 but she made it too easy for me
 here we go again
 mind's stuck on her
 playing the dreamer
 she's my inevitable alarm clock
 she'll wake me with her silence
 that's the only signal i understand
 how tragic or funny
 that the joke's still on me
