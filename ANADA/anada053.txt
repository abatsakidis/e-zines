        I'm forming a secret society and I think you'd fit right in.  It's
 for people who like geeky stuff but are forced due to the stone cold geeks
 (people who wear Magic and Star Trek tees publicly etc.) to keep their
 geekiness in the closet.  I for one am sick and tired of these smelly swine
 ruining the fact that I follow Voyager and Star Wars stuff as well as keep
 upon news from TSR and White Wolf.

        The Secret Geeks are not just dedicated to 'In the closet geek'
 information exchange but also to eradicating the big sour-milk-smelling
 geeks.  Why just last night I caught a man who could use a bath at the bus
 stop.  He was wearing navy sweatpants and a Xena shirt that was only to be
 held together by the filth that will only collect on a fat-ass nerd boy.

        "Hey...."  I said causually.

        "Hey."  He offered nervously, shifting his weight.

        "So..."  I asked,  "....What was Obi-One Kenobi's rank in the Clone
 Wars?"

        He looked back at me without missing a beat and answered 'General.'
 I was forced to curb stomp right there, and added his teeth to the
 polyhedron dice tube that also held those of the pencil-neck geek Poke' punk
 I gave a boot enema earlier that day.

        Eradicating these human suppositories is not only beneficial to
 society, but profitable.  I took the fat-ass geek's duffel bag which had a
 very rare Poke' something something which I gave to this chinese woman in
 exchange for her only daughter.  You can see pictures of her on
 www.thehun.com about every other day.
