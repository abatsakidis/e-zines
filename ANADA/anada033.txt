        Today in Algebra class the teacher was being particularly draining of
 everyone's energy.  Everyone yawned and were bored.  I myself was also.  The
 red head ahead of me said to me, "Man, I'm tired."  I told her, "nah, he's
 just being drainy", and she nodded.  So I started burning up and grounding
 out his negative source from which he was draining us.  After I located it
 and began, the drainage slowly chilled down.  I realized that everything he
 was saying while teacher the class algebra also pertained to me trying to
 burn up other people's bad energies.  I was fruiting out in class.  It was
 uncanny.  He'd talk about how you have to break the problem down into parts,
 and when it's less comples it's easier to deal with.  "You can take notes if
 you like"- I took it to meant maybe I should write down the spiritual half.
 "some of you know what I'm talking about".  What the fuck?  It was like he
 was teaching two entirely different classes.  Either mathematics is a divine
 language, or I'm going crazy, or I'm starting to see the nature of god.  He
 spoke of the "test" in which we'd have much more problems like that.  I
 imagined myself being tested on trying to burn up people's bad vibes by some
 higher authority without my knowing it.

        After I burned a lot of his energy, I bit off my toenail in class.
 No one saw or cared, except one chick, Amy Potter, who I had a crush on in
 kindergarden.  She fruited out hardcore.  She couldn't tell anyone because I
 was well composed and she'd seem like a fruit.  I felt like telling her,
 "now you know what it feels like to know somthing that you can't tell."

        I went to my car and found a quarter there that definitely wasn't
 there before.  I needed gas money real bad.

        I went to work to check out my employment status.  I stopped before
 Hot Sam's.  I didn't care what happened as long as it was the best for me --
 but I didn't want her decision to be based on anger --
    
   ---= The reason she was angry was that on Sunday I woke up late, then
 called and told Melissa I wasn't coming to work.  Mindy, me, Gnash, Katie,
 and Sarah all planned to meditate together for some time now, and this was
 looking like the first time we were actually going to be able to make it
 happen.  I went to Mindy's, and her mother guided us through a Shamanic
 journey to meet our animal spirits.  There I met a Giraffe, Bear, and Ape.
 The Giraffe was my uniqueness.  I thought the bear was real power -- but
 Peggy seemed to think it was gentle and caringness.  The Ape was my apelike
 primal self that I was trying to get into touch with.  The bear gave me a
 heart, which I take to symbolize my development and getting in touch with
 emotions.  The giraffe gave me my own spunk, and the Ape gave me all of the
 qualities of an Ape.

        Mindy and I discussed Plato's Cave theory, and read the play.  I want
 to re-do the play and put it on TV.

        Then Gnash showed up and we decided to start meditating to get one up
 on Katie and Sarah before they came.  They wanted to tone and beat on drums.
 Boy, their style sure did differ from mine.  We toned, which is hooting or
 chanting a reasonably steady tone with everyone else in attempt to reasonate
 and grounding out negative energies.  Beautiful.  Some times during
 resonance, one's voice poured an blasted power and volume with little
 effort.

        I wanted to try my hall of mirrors effect with more than one person.
 I explained to them that a person is said to be illuminated when they learn
 to reflect all sorts of light -- and, if people keep reflecting light
 around, it goes like a hall of mirrors all the way down forever.  We tried
 it with some success, but with three people it didn't resonate all of the
 way down.

        Sarah and Katie showed.  They burned Sage around everyone, one at a
 time, to cleanse everyone's aura.  Style definitely differed.  Gnash spoke
 of burning cow shit in an upside pyramid as a meditation tool.  I had to
 laugh.  I was very serious and self-controlled, because everyone else was
 free.  I loosened up a lot about sharing real stuff with people and being
 positive.

        The girls were singing and drumming, and Gnash was half-passed out.
 For a second I thought in the future we should divide into male and female.
 I got Gnash up to meditate hall of mirrors style.  I told everyone I didn't
 mean to disclude them, but hall of mirrors only works with two.  Katie
 slipped in anyway, and I smirked.  Gnash felt my crazy look resonate, but
 didn't know what it was.  How would we solve this?  Then I thought about how
 to illuminate somone.  We all focused and blasted vibes at everyone -- with
 wonderful results.  We all talked about the different changes in people's
 faces and things that they think they might need to work on or spirit
 animals or whatever.  I felt we were all fast on the path to illumination.
 But I also realized how cold, abstract, and scientific I was about my
 spiritual truths.  I kept thinking about the external mercabra, and
 wondering if that was the path I'm on. =----

        So I suppose she had a right to be angry.  I did leave on the busiest
 day without giving a reason.  I was having mixed attitudes of feeling ultra
 badass and feeling like a little bitch crawling back to my boss.  I stopped
 before Hot Sam's.  I must be getting more attuned because I "looked" for the
 vibe in the place without even seeing anyone working.  I picked up on the
 anger and starting dispelling it.  Across from me was the optic center,
 where my boss's daughter worked.  If I could get her to come over, I could
 ask what my boss's attitude was, and perhaps she also know my employment
 status.

        She was about to look over when my boss yelled for her to come over.
 I kept an eye out, and popped up to the counter.  The boss was heading down
 the hall, and her daughter was very shocked to see me come out of nowhere.
 This hiding in shadow effect made me feel smooth.  I got the low down.  She
 might like me.  The boss came back and I found out that I had been written
 up.  Ooooh.  But she could not give me Sundays off.  Fuck.  I must decide
 what to do about this job.

        When I got back to my car, I noticed that the magic quarter on my
 dash became a dime.  Man.  I looked around doubtfully and found no quarter.
 Fuckin madness.  I thought about how it might be some sort of message.  I
 thought, "Yeah it's there", moved something, and immediately saw the
 quarter.

        Fruity world.
