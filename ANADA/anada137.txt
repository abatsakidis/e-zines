 Can't think of a Title

 I live in a world of cloning
 a sea of madness all around
 the fakeness swallows me whole
 and I die as I see your soul...

 my life is always chaotic
 insanity hiding the truth
 the tension I hide inside
 is beginning to seep through...

 I cry out when I see reality
 nonsense surrounding us all
 I try to laugh at the shallowness
 but I'm always going to know...

 . . . . .


 Human Flesh

 You stick yourself 
 to the face
 of what human remains
 
 you kill yourself
 with a devils grin
 a pleading cry
 for this shame
 
 insects crawl through your skull
 the light is growing dim
 a gunshot fires and misses us all
 except for one
 
 he holds the truth
 
 . . . . .


 Happiness is fake.  
 Sadness is hidden.  
 Forever's a lie.  
 And Love is forbidden.

 My life is a game.
 My friends are a shame.
 I've reached my destiny.
 But I don't know where to begin.

 Everything is superficial.
 The people have become so shallow.
 I am drowning in other's lies.
 The truth has become a sin.

 I begin to love someone.
 But their feelings are untrue.
 We hold back what we feel.
 Until someone will listen.

 . . . . .


 The beauty that falls nonchalantly from your tongue.
 As you once again are blinded by something that's so real.
 I never knew how much I loved you until today.
 I never really wanted it this way.

 It's gonna be awhile...
 Until I step outside myself...
 And realize...
 You cannot be mine...
 
 I'm just a little girl...
 Full of lies...
 Just a girl...
 A voodoo in disguise...

 If you open up your eyes you will see me smiling.
 The tears are now washed away.
 And you're moving on
 But I'm still aching for you this very day.

 It's gonna be a while...
 Until I step outside myself...
 And realize...
 You cannot be mine...

 It's gonna be a while...
 Until I step outside myself...
 And realize...
 You cannot be mine...
