        I am a writer without the pen.  A poet without the words.  The seeker
 who's never looking, and the dreamer who doesn't remember her dreams.  I am
 the bitch that crushed your poor heart, and the exgirlfriend that lends you
 a hand when falling out of love.  I am the perfect cheater.  I am the honest 
 liar.  The sane psychotic.  The healthy drug abuser.  I am the diverse 
 racist.  I am the killer that saved your life.  The god who damned you to 
 hell.  I am the demonic angel.  I am the whore that thinks adultery is
 wrong.

        My life is so chaotic.  I am a walking contradiction.  I know of no
 hypocrite greater than myself.  I've searched for my true self and found 
 nothing.  I am the narcissistic conceited bitch who lies in questioning of 
 everything she does.  I threw away my sense of humor but yet you still
 laugh.  I'm the sociable antisocial.  I'm the one who loves society but
 hates people.  I am the romantic who doesn't believe in love.  I live
 dangerously but am afraid of death.  I'm the attention striving whore who
 hates to be noticed.  I'm the judgemental bitch who hates prejudice.  I see
 no point to life but think there is a purpose.  I'm the best friend who'll
 stab you in the back.  I am good and evil, love and fear, heaven and hell.

        I need people but I don't trust anyone.  I hate to see you cry, but
 love to watch you scream.  I am your worst fantasy and your best reality.
 I'm so confused as to who I am.
