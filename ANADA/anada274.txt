	First of all, this has probably all been said before.  I Don't Care.

	Most of you can probably remember when the Internet didn't suck.
 Back in the day the Internet was about knowledge.  Sadly, like so many other
 things in life, it has become a tool for the media to make more money.  It's
 almost like watching T.V., which is sad, because I can't stand T.V.

        How has this atrocity come to pass?  I’ll tell you--DUMB PEOPLE.  Ten
 years ago the Internet wasn’t worth companies’ time because the few amount
 of people on the Internet were smart.  How many of you people actually click
 the ads that run on every single damned web page?  Most of you probably
 answered "NO", or some form of "NO" involving the word "FUCK"--
 congratulations, you are (probably) not dumb.  (Notice the lack of ads on
 the Anada page.)

	What has changed since then to allow these idiots out into our once
 beloved Internet?  I’ll tell you--User Friendliness.  Years past, you had to
 actually know something to be able to use the Internet.  No sponge-minion
 (read: MORON) that didn’t know the difference between a CD-ROM and a fucking
 coffee cup holder could get on.  Today, since these computers are made for
 the average person, (translation: DUMB) you buy a computer, and WHAMO!
 You’re on the Internet, clicking merrily away, making the suits more money,
 surfing to every single web address you see, whether it be on a cereal box,
 an ad in the paper, or the back of a detergent bottle.  And, of course,
 sending your DAMNED chain letters to every person you have met in your
 miserable existence.  Oh by the way, just in case one of you happens to be
 read this, no matter how many poor saps you send an email to, you WILL NOT
 see cool movies, get 1,000,000 dollars from Bill gates for helping him test
 his email tracing program, have good luck, score more dates, and no little
 girls with cancer/AIDS will get pennies/nickels/dimes.  TRUST ME.

	So, these companies say, “Hey, we can get more advertising now that
 there are more dumb people on the Internet!”  “Quick lets buy any domain
 name that has anything remotely to do with our product.”  Then they populate
 web sites with flashy ads and cool slogans.  Why the hell a company needs a
 site with Java, Macromedia Flash, and a host of other bandwidth-hogging shit
 just to advertise some fucking laundry detergent is beyond me.

	Thanks to all of you people who continue to not be dumb.  Our numbers
 are dwindling fast; so we must do what we can to propagate smart people.
 Who will have sex with me?  Yes, it is that drastic.
