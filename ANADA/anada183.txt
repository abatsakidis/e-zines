 *artists rendering of me*

 he has bottled water and he drinks it slowly.  it is warm now so he goes and
 puts it in the refrigerator so it will be cold again.  wait, if he puts it
 in the freezer for an hour or so, it will be even colder than if he put it
 in the refigerator.  so thats what he does he does this because he is smart.


 *emptiness found*

 he bought records.  mostly stuff youve havent heard of like jeromes dream,
 moment, combatwoundedveteran, orchid, charles bronson, soilent green, oh and 
 johnny cash.


 *sewn mouth secrets*

 when eyes kick brains and faces are just as twisted as rotini in a pesto and
 basil sauce, night will change into mourning and black will become grey once 
 again.  this i know this i know this i know

 *rollins*

 a bio on rollins is on the desk.  when rollins was first in black flag, if
 people started shit with him, hed fucking punch them and not think twice 
 about it.  but, then, this kind of behaviour was becoming more prevelent at 
 the shows, so greg ginn and chuck dukowski told rollins not to bother 
 retaliating any more because it only feeds the crowds fire.  so, rollins 
 stopped fighting back.  he endured all their abuse.  being punched in the 
 balls, being spit at, having his bare feet pounded on, being punched in the 
 face, etc. until at one show, when more people than usual were fucking with 
 him, he ended up crawling off stage and hiding being the amps curled up in 
 the fetal position, crying.  black flag's drummer, bill stevenson, managed 
 to pull rollins into the stairwell and he just stayed there with him for 
 about an hour the time it took rollins to recover from his breakdown.  after
 that night, rollins and stevenson started lifting weights and working out 
 regularly and after that whenever anyone fucked with rollins at shows they 
 got fucked up.


 *gg allin*

 gg allin died in 1993.  when he preformed he would often stab himself in the
 head with glass and shred his flesh with a beer cans.  he would also shit 
 onstage.  sometimes, he would eat it and sometimes he would throw it at the 
 audience.  he would also masterbate and urinate on stage frequently.  he 
 would often run into the crowd and assult random people for nothing.  one 
 time, there was this guy standing up in front of the stage and gg pulled his 
 glasses off his face and just fucking smashed them.  at many shows he when 
 he would run into the audience half or all of the audience would run out of 
 the club.  he would do any drug you put in front of him and liked to be 
 pissed and shit on by female fans.  whenever a female would do this for him 
 he'd keep their panties as a souvenir.  gg allin died of a herion overdose 
 after a concert in new york in 1993.  at his wake various people stuck drugs 
 in his mouth and hands and a few took out his penis and played with it.  he
 was buried in a leather jacket and a jock strap that had "EAT ME" written on 
 the front by his side was a bottle of jack daniels.
