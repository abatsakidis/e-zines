        "Braaaaadddd..." Brad winced.  "...how come we never talk anymore?"
 Brad winced harder.

        "Aaaah... I don't wanna talk about this now... I'm drunk..."

        "Braaaaadddd... it's okay... i just wanna talk to you... I'm drunk
 too... it's okay..."

        "...Okay, baby, what d'ya wanna talk about then?"

        "Well... uh... how come we never talk anymore, sweetie?"

        The couple were both heavy-hearted, bored, miserable, and guilty.
 Brad had no balls.  He was a miserable waste of time.  Kelly was a manic-
 depressive, obsessive-compulsive, passive-agressive, alcoholic mess.

        "Put on a pot of coffee, baby.  We should talk."

        Brad and Kelly talked all night, and by morning, they had settled
 all of their differences.  The love between those two is cement.

        Two weeks later, they were married.  Now they've got a 2-year old kid
 and another one due in a couple of weeks.

        In the town where they raise their children, the bars are packed
 every night with old friends who they don't talk to anymore.

        "Glen... Glen!  Spot me a beer... come on... I get paid tomorrow!"

        "Fuck you.  You're a goddamned parasite, Pauly.  I'm trying to
 raise a fucking family here and you never do shit for me.  Don't ask me for
 a fucking drink... fucking lowlife..."

        "Hahahaha!  A family?  That overweight slut and that little brat of
 hers?  Glen, you're pathetic."

        "You piece of shit... Pauly... you haven't gotten laid since you
 stopped dealing last year.  Now look at you, you're pathetic!  You will
 never be anything to anyone, ever again.  Poor slob, your life is over!"

        "Yeah... yeah... like I have a choice... I'm on fucking probation,
 asshole... I'm still making money... just been rough times..."

        "Yeah... yeah, fuck you, go take some drugs... fucking dumb ass
 drug addict."

        Glen and Pauly took it outside fought hand-to-hand until they were
 blind, bloody, hardly walking... afterwards they laughed their asses off
 and exchanged high fives.

        Two years later, Glen is married and has his own house.  Pauly lives
 in their basement and is working on getting his Ph.D..  He still eats and
 gets drunk at Glen's expense.
