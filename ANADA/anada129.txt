 relations of words to real life:

 are you going to be... DISTURBED?

 when
         you
                 see

 the coffee cup i tapped so endlessly
 the fake nails painted so dark
 the roof moonlight supposedly dances on
 the abandonment of dillusional dreams
 
         (could you relate
         and not portray it
         like i could?
         that's only because
         you saw beauty
         in my feeble
         attempt at honesty)
 
 blind, like every cliched lyric and line;
 somebody should've told me the truth long ago.
 the truth of the reality of all those hours of words
 and the dispassionate, fake motivation behind it...
 
         B (burdening)
          U (useless)
           L (loving)
            L (lifeless)         <--all my
             S (stupid)             words.
              H (haunted)
               I (ignorant)
                T (tedious)
 
 taking pseudo-medicine
 singing bar anthems
 lying on black grass
 too many harmless addictions
 
 can i hate the world that tried to save me
 for dining on an empty platter of eloquence
 the dull vacancy behind the pristine prose
 scattered words crushed beneath shuffling feet
 
                 painting all the stifled feelings
                 with an animate circle of surroundings
 
                         (how god damn MODERN)
 
         fucked it up again
         in the summer of 2000
         don't sit there
         and nod your fucking head
 
         i refuse to be
 
                 i'll no longer be
 
                         a word whore.
