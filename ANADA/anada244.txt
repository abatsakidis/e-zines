 If ignorance is bliss then what beauty is THIS?
 When he holds you close
 When he sheds a tear is it all that you needed to hear?
 he brings you down he shits on you
 what more can he possibly DO.

 discover a new life discover who the fuck you really are
 dont you feel like such a star?
 go smoke some more drugs go ask for another hug
 oh god he touched you not that!
 get over it you stupid whore its really become a bore
 please shut up for all of us.

 why dont you face the facts and pay the price
 we all warned you not to take another slice
 but you dont listen because you dont care
 were you even ever there?
 when he bruised your face and slit your wrist
 and you claimed it was only a phase. you're so dumb
 so disgustingly blind now do you feel a bit numb?

 aww that's too bad i am almost sad
 do you want another piece of candy dear?
 here you go how 'bout that do you have to be so shallow?
 im sick of it and im sick of you what you thought were lies were only true.  he fuckin hates you 
 ha ha ha oh boo hoo hoo.
 do you like to be this pathetic
 does it make you feel real good?

 you dont even like him you dont even talk to him
 so why does he constantly occupy your mind?
 why do you shrivel up and die in front of his feet
 although you forgot his name?
 why do you continue to try to hold some form of a friendship with him
 still is this nothing but a game?
 it's obvious that he isn't going to respond to your childish ways.

 stop locking yourself in this prison when he has chosen not to listen.
 maybe some day he'll realize you were the only one who ever cared
 that you were you the only one who was ever really there.
 maybe he'll see how conceited they really are.
 how narcissistic and shallow they aren't any stars.
 maybe then he'll come back and beg to be your friend...
 will you put yourself through it all over again?
