 you forgot
 my scales
 my everything

 just this
 anomaly
 life tastes
 acrid
 insecticides spread

 swallowed me whole
 fight for
 my ambivolence
 i remain
 agoraphobic...

 you sit there and you fucking go on and on talking about who fucking knows 
 what.  you were sent here by some very evil men to torture me.  you suck.

 i make my thumb and index finger into a gun.  i begin shooting at you, "BANG 
 BANG!!!  BANG BANG!!!" you shut up and leave.

 another asshole sits down.


 [*****]

 stare at me from across the table.  tell about today's happenings.  i REALLY 
 care.  talk and talk i will nod and smile.  all the while the leave it to
 beaver theme song plays continuously in my head.

 she was sitting on the couch watching some stupid shit.  it was probably 
 some lame show on the WB.  her father was in the recliner getting fucking
 wasted.  she knew he was going to fuck with her later.  he has that look in
 his eyes.  she took her gun out from under the couch cushion and blew his
 black brains all over the walls.  she put the gun in her mouth and pulled
 the trigger.  her blood and brains and skull all over the walls also.

 her note:
 "dear mom...
    sorry you have to clean up the mess."

 there was this shitty car parked in the far left corner of the parking lot 
 behind the crappy diner.  shawn and i ripped off the door and then put it
 through the sunroof.  we jumped on the roof until it collapsed and we fell
 right through.  we ripped out the drivers seat and put it through the
 windshield.  i swear the fucking car was made of cardboard.
