 We rant and we rave on the streets, on the page,
 And you call us depraved 'cos you think you sound sage,
 And everyone knows you've got a past you won't share,
 Those countless cheap ho's. What, do you think we don't care? 
 
 What is your problem, don't you know we're not dumb,
 You can't just bomb them then say you used guns,
 If lives are at stake why don't you try to use tact,
 Instead my head aches as you fuck with the facts 
 
 Getting backhanders fucks you up in the end,
 You think you've canned us but you will find, my friend,
 That no one can cheat, lie and especially tax,
 'Cos you'll lose your seat and then you'll get whacked
 
 A-fuckin'-men!
