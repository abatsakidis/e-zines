        I put, I put a gash in my leg.  I put it there to stay, to stay.  And
 if I smile at you, will you look at it, at it?  Or will you, will you, have
 to turn your eyes away?

        It's there, it's there, I want you to see it.  I did this to myself,
 myself, goddamn it, look at me.  You should know, know, know, so why do you
 ask?  This is not, is not, not what you believe it to be.  Please smile at
 me, at me, at me.

        And if I twist myself around, around, will you be my friend?  Will
 you give a piece of you to me, to me?  Can you, can you, wrap yourself tight
 up in my madness?  Do you want to feel, to feel?  I can, I can.

        And it's all spinning, spinning, and it feels so nice.  You can, you
 can, be a part of it if you think about it really hard.  I do want you to be
 a part of this, of this.  You must know, know, know how to drown.  Please
 drown with me, with me.  And watch me, watch me, as I erupt.  I'll take you,
 take you, along.

        I need, I need, just a little of your help here.  You see, you see,
 it's all getting a little bit out of control.  I can't stop it, stop it,
 anymore.  I don't know what to do, to do.  It's all, all, all, all, all,
 all, all coming to an end now.  You feel it, feel it?  Sinking, sinking.  I
 do, I do.

        Cata-cata-cata-cataclysm, cataclysm, clysm, clys...m.

        You won't regret this.  Thank you.
