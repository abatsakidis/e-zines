        I was thinking about some important things.  Life... death...
 everything in between.  Most of us fear death.  It is a frightening thing to
 think about, to think that there is an end to everything, including
 ourselves.

        But instead of worrying about this our whole lives, we should just
 realize that we all die sometime.  Instead of taking so many precautions so
 that we don't get hurt, I think, just fuck it.  If you enjoy doing something
 that is dangerous, oh well, because people who are so afraid to face their
 end usually are going to just grow old and worthless and die unhappy in a
 nursing home.  So my idea is that we should all live dangerously.  Enjoy
 life... and  die having fun.

        But hey, some people are looking forward to being old 90 years old.
 Some keep on working and play a good part in our lives.  But then there are
 those who just keep on living... but they do absolutely nothing.  They sit
 at home watching soap operas and calling their kids up to take them
 everywhere because they don't have a job.  I know that's really rude of me
 to say but it's true.  I love my grandmother to death but she does this.

        So be happy, have fun, and enjoy life while you can.  Otherwise
 you'll end up being so careful in what you do that you won't be having fun
 anymore.  And what's the point of that?

        I'm not saying that we should just break all of the rules and do
 anything.  If you lived like that, we would all be dead.  But just don't
 worry so much.  Don't fear so many things.  Live in the now.  We shouldn't
 sit there and lay down in the middle of the street because we feel like it.
 We shouldn't drink and drive... that kills others.  Just have fun in what
 you're doing and stay in control of yourself, use common sense.  Because
 we're not here forever and one day you will be gone too.
