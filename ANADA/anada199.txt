 "Get Back In The Car, Jewels"

 so the dish was empty and jewels was starved!
 and the monk was petting!
 no the bag was empty and the meows were carved!
 crying out every second!

 forget what you fed your cat!!!
 forget what you fed your cat!!!
 forget what you fed your cat!!!
 yeah i saw the way you talk to the catnip!

 forget what you fed your cat!!!
 forget what you fed your cat!!!
 forget what you fed your cat!!!
 then i thought about the cats with the shotgun!

 so jewels held a shotgun up to the monk!
 ate him on the hood with the headlights on!
 radio was playing that darn cat songs!
 
 later on she ate a dead duckling!
 realized she never ate anything!
 now she eats with her headlights off!

 forget what you fed your cat!!!
 forget what you fed your cat!!!
 forget what you fed your cat!!!
 yeah i saw the way you climbed out of the litter box!

 forget what you fed your cat!!!
 forget what you fed your cat!!!
 forget what you fed your cat!!!
 and now you never grow your own catnip!@$!#%!@!


 "Cat Orange Small"

 fly anna fly
 broken the teeth i see you
 old covered claws
 wet nose
 there she goes

 silent but drools
 cat orange small i see you
 trash can is home
 go alone
 and alone

 fly jewels fly
 fatter than anna i feel you
 lard covered pounds
 white paws
 no claws

 heard jewels fall
 far from them all i feel you
 huge fat behind
 over your head
 anna said

 sooner or later jewels gets up off the floor
 when no one wants to drag her anymore
 someday she's gonna get up off the floor
 'cause no one wants to hear her shit

 cry orange cats cry
 over the fat & trash i see you
 old declawed claws
 wet nose
 there she goes
 dead mice you fling
 meows you sing i hear you
 litter box is home
 go alone
 till you're done
