        What the fuck is it with fans of pop stars?  Why the hell do they
 think that the words they sing mean ANYTHING to them?

        On MTV there was a First Listen program about Britney Spears' album
 and all the fans were asking shit like "When you say in one song, 'bibble,
 bibble' and then in another, 'babble, babble' were you, like, saying,
 'bibble, bobble?'" Or "What similarities are there in your life to the words
 in 'Lucky?'"

        And she was saying, "Oh, well, when I first heard 'Baby One More
 Fuck' I thought the same as you and I could really relate to that."  SHE
 DIDN'T WRITE THOSE SONGS!!!!!!!

        Why why why why do fans insist on attempting to bring anything deep
 out of a fucking Britney Spears song?  It's pop, it's not supposed to be
 deep!  Christ, Ring-a-rosy is deeper than fucking Nshyt! (It's about the
 Black Death in the middle ages.)

        The sad thing is that these fans are displaying all the symptoms of
 wanting to be fans of real songwriters and artists who actually give a fuck
 what they release and want to genuinely express themselves.  And they fool
 themselves, for whatever reason, that these mind-crushingly tedious, shallow
 groups are one of those.  They want shallow pop AND deeply felt, from-the-
 heart songs.  The last time pure pop and talent shared the same
 neighbourhood was when the Beatles started growing facial hair.  You simply
 ain't gonna get that mix these days.

        Even when pop groups do write their own stuff, like the Spice Girls,
 they consciously write generic, depthless lyrics.  Why?  Because that's what
 people buy.  Shallow sells, deep is "confusing and indulgent."  No, for deep
 read meaningful.

        On the rock side Oasis were huge for a few years in the 90's because
 their music was simple and their lyrics were complete nonsense.  The lyrics
 were put to their music solely so that Liam didn't have to just sing la la
 la la all the time.  REM are the exception though, Michael Stipe does try
 with his words and, although at times they can be impenetrable, they are
 frequently personal and of undeniable quality.  They sell truckloads.  Well,
 there has to be an exception to every rule.

        All I want to say to these pop obsessed morons is either go and
 listen to Pearl Jam or shut up and accept that people like Miss Spears are
 singing the songs of white, middle-aged men she has never met and when she
 does occasionally add the odd syllable to a song it's just so she can grab a
 slightly bigger slice of the royalties.  Live with it!
