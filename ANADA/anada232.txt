        one day, frank the stinky ferret was tending to his garden when this
 goofy ferret from up the road named smitty came over to make fun of frank
 the stinky ferret.

        "sooooooo, frank.... what do you have in your lusciously, silky
 smooth, opaque garden?" asked smitty.

        "what in the hell did you just say?  where you even trying to make
 sense?" frank the stinky ferret inquired.

        "ahahahaha, man you stink!" ejaculated smitty.  "so, whats in your
 fucking garden already?"

        "well, this year i have some arugala, turnips, spinach, corn, and
 finally, my most favouritest of all, MY CHEESEBURGER TREE!" announced frank
 the stinky ferret as he hopped about excitedly.

        "dude, why the hell is there a fence and barbed wire around that
 tree?" asked smitty the FOOLISH fucking cunt ferret.

        "what are you, some kind of foolish fucking cunt?" asked frank the
 stinky ferret.  "its to protect my vivacious cheeseburger tree from the
 hamburglar.  if i catch that motherfucker anywhere near my cheeseburger tree
 one more time, i'll shoot off his kneecaps, pick up his lame ass with my
 crane (see frank the stinky ferret #1) and drop his ass in the most vile of
 all places in the world!  MUAHAHAhahahahahahahahaha!!!"

        "canada?" asked smitty.

        "close, but no."  *dramatic pause*  "NEW JERSEY!"

        "no!  not new jersey!  frank, i knew you were one stinky, messed up
 little fucker, but i never thought you were that diabolical.  i do not think
 i can associate with you any longer, you sick, sad, stinky ferret.  now i
 must return to my barn/spaceship to listen to my raffi records.  good day,
 sir."  with that said, smitty turned and scurried off.

        after finishing his gardening, frank the stinky ferret picked the two
 nicest, ripest cheeseburgers from his cheeseburger tree.  he then went
 inside his house to eat his cheeseburgers, drink cherry coke, and listen to
 atom and his package.  and then he went poop.
