        Last time, I didn't do the dishes.

        This time, I spend too much time on the computer.

        Last time, I drank orange juice after brushing.

        This time, it's my wisdom teeth coming in.

        Last time, I was a whore.

        This time, I'm coy.

        Last time, I was stable and unhappy.

        This time, I am confused and curious.

        Last time, I had a big fluffy pillow.

        This time, I sleep on my hands.

        Last time, I dominated all conversation.

        This time, I listen carefully to silence.

        Last time, I didn't receive any bills.

        This time, I didn't pay any bills.

        Last time, status-quo was good enough.

        This time, my dreams have taken over.

        Last time, my walls held me back.

        This time, the gates are open.

        Last time, I smoked a FAT BOWL.

        This time, I sip a screwdriver.

        Last time, I was afraid.

        This time, I am still afraid.

        That will change with time.
