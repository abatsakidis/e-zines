        Another night out on the town.  And how fulfilling it was.  I savored
 every moment as I observed the Dubuque, Iowa life.  What was it that I did 
 again?  Oh yes.  I'll go into great detail about something with no
 importance to anyone.  

        Ah.  School was typical.  I can't even recall what happened there
 except for Gina crying about how Travis bought her soul from Colton.  And
 having to sit by a stench invested freak in one of my classes.  And having
 to put up with my pedophile driver's ed teacher.  But good thing I'm not a
 blonde cheerleader.  Lucky me.

        I went to the wonderous mall after school with Gina.  I stalked some
 skater kid until I finally got a chance to chat with him.  (It's one of the 
 few times you'll see me become sociable with strangers.)  What?!  I can't 
 help it if it seems as though the men come out of their caves only in the 
 fall and winter time so therefor I become especially horny.  Sigh.

        Yeah so that was grand.  Then we bought 100 dollars worth of candy.
 Did you hear that?  ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS of CANDY.  Did I mention I'm crazy?
 That's going to be one hell of a halloween party she's throwing there.

        So then I met up with my bud Allison.  And we ventured back to the
 mall for only a few more endless hours.  Where I ran into Craig and had the 
 opportunity to be with a thief.  What a thrill.    

        Oh what next.  Yes.  Perkins.  It's become a necessity to fulfill my
 Friday nights.  So I go in there THREE times.  Not once.  Not even twice.  
 But THREE times tonight.  Fuck.  It's almost embarassing.  

        The first time I'm with Gina and Allison.  We stay awhile and notice
 no decent people except for Jim.  So we decided to go to Target and let our 
 immaturity out on some amazing miniature scooter things.  I felt like a kid 
 all over again.  So that was that and we went to wait for Gina's mom to come 
 bitch at her.

        Me and Allison went back to Perkins for awhile.  Ran into Jon and his
 bitches.  Tim (jesus).  Beth and Carrie.  Owen and Martha... but no Rob.  :(  
 So me allison and Martha went over to Take 5 where we met up with our mortal 
 enemy.  I was convinced that she was going to make our coffee and spill it 
 all over our bodies and laugh as we burnt to a crisp.  And instead we 
 received the most disturbing thing witnessed in a long time.  The 4 of us
 had a civilized half hour conversation about shit and she doesn't hate us at
 all.  What the fuck?  I was speechless.  I'm still baffled by the
 experience.

        So we waddled back over to Perkins for a THIRD time.  And discovered
 more interesting people.  Now I had the joy of seeing some ignorant
 worthless jocks from West Dubuque who liked to laugh after each syllable
 they let out.  Some other people who appeared to be hardcore "goth" or
 hardcore "punk" when in all reality they were just a bunch of average kids
 putting on a big act like a bunch of fuckin posers.  But hey... I guess
 that'd be me too then right?  Then Mike and Cole showed up who were
 spreading their diseases on me by coughing on my belongings which made me
 become highly paranoid.  I got to chat with Elysia and Nick for awhile and
 discovered that one of my managers is probably gay.  And last but not least
 I got to chat with Bill, Colton, and Emily.  Well... I really only talked to
 Bill.

        Dubuque's a real humorous place to be.  The whole scene is
 fascinating. I think all tourists should definitely make a pitstop here in
 our city.  We be jammin yo.  Whatever.
