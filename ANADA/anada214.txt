        I realize that I have accepted a job at a yuppie company.  The kind
 of company that leaves out the important details that would have prevented
 you from accepting the position.   For example, telling you that you will
 have to answer the phones during lunch hours (which is fine) but not telling
 you that there would be a class kid (Retard) walking down the hall, and
 grabbing his crotch every time you answer the phone.  Of course you can't be
 improper on the phone therefore you can't laugh.  This is the cruelest form
 of torture!  The companies that tell you that you can wear whatever you want
 because there's no dress code.  But when you come in with your baggy pants
 and band T-shirt they pick on you until you feel so self conscious that you
 scurry around to find a sweater to put on over it.  The company that went to
 every college and took the kewl Kakhi wearing kids and said hey, you wanna
 work?  Everyday I have the urge to ask everyone how their shot for the gap
 commercial went this morning, and waiting for them to start singing and
 dancing!  The kind of company that you just want to stick your ass in
 someone's office and fart, just because it would totally wreak of
 awesomeness.  Grrrrrrrrr, being an adult sucks!
