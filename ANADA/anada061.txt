 SHOES

 Another pair of shoes today.
 Same as the last pair,
 loafers.

 Fifth pair of them I'd say,
 though not as comfortable a wear.
 Figures.

 Steps through life, I think.
 Tight-walking through time,
 the rope.

 Each pair another measure, a blink.
 These are my prime
 I hope.
 
 Can't remember how many shoes
 or count the steps.
 Should I?

 Another pair to wear, misuse
 'till they lie forsaken
 replaced by...

 Another pair of shoes today...
 

 PICKING UP THE PIECES

 Put the light upon my face
 let the fires dance on my disgrace
 roses flutter in the wind
 never will be coming back again
 turn it up and let the feelings run
 put the past out behind the sun
 don't know why I ever played this game
 dropped my life now it's just not the same
 
 picking up the pieces
 dusting off the ashes
 getting tired of the same old days
 I never said forever
 it's time the ties are severed
 I'm back to my old ways

 I could have stayed just a little bit longer
 if only the ties were just a little bit stronger
 but time stays put for no one else
 I couldn't stand to be here by myself
 so I put me on an open road
 dropped the walls and let the feelings show
 I'll put it all behind me

 picking up the pieces
 dusting off the ashes
 getting tired of the same old days
 I never said forever
 it's time the ties are severed
 I'm back to my old ways
 

 SLEEPING

 Sleeping you. Your curled form
 captures my heart, makes it warm.
 
 I want you, your sweet soul
 should join me, make me whole.
 
 Timer matters. We have a lifetime
 but no less. Hear the clock chime?
