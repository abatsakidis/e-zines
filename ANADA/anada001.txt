	So many things to do...

	So little time to do it all...

	Whine whine whine.

	I have more dreams than I could possibly IMAGINE trying to live out.
 And that's fine.  I think everyone needs something like that... an
 unattainable goal, a land of make-believe, a place to feel utterly miserable
 within onesself.  There's nothing wrong with being a miserable failure; I'm
 an apt student, and I've learned well.

	So little originality is left for us, such a tiny amount of true
 innovation left.  It's all been done, so we've been told, and we've believed
 it all along.  They are probably right.  What can we do?  Hell, reduce,
 reuse, recycle, I suppose.  We could always just toss everything we already
 have and know away and pretend it never happened.  Stress relief.  Big
 smiles for all, right?  No more plaigarism--won't let them fill me with
 fatalistic remedies.  Yeah, that's what I thought.

	Of course, we've got this whole reality thing going on, this whole
 Life Experience bullshit we're supposed to know, love, whatever.  Look!
 Things happen every day, we're supposed to be INSPIRED, yo.  Hahahaha,
 funny.  Never mind that if you're feeling pissed off, someone has already
 been pissed off first.  Someone else has already written the angsty rant.
 Someone else has already been looked upon as the Grand Master of Emotions,
 Inc., and everything you think makes you a wanna-be, a "scenester", a tired
 cliche of days gone by.  Okay, fuck, it's true.  So now what.  So now what.

 *** Now that I've established the traditional "cynical outlook", I       ***
 *** will now attempt the flipside.  Please watch for keywords, such as   ***
 *** "hope", "happiness", and other uppity, proactive bullshit            ***
 *** motivational speaking that will attempt to bring some twisted change ***
 *** of heart.  And given that innovation is completely out of the        ***
 *** question, be prepared to wallow in the muck that just sounds like    ***
 *** Something I've Read Before.  Of course.                              ***

	"Maybe I'll die, maybe I'll learn how to fly."

	Explanation.  What's so crazy about that?  Definition, words of
 character, blah blah de freakin blah.  I suppose we could run around and
 grab the Brittanica off the shelf and accomplish the same thing (or, for
 those of us who can't comprehend anyway, a World Book would do).  But look
 up "emotion".  Look up "compassion".  Look up "feeling like shit and
 wanting to shoot myself in the head".  Yeah, that's right.  That's the
 dictionary's job, and that doesn't explain a goddamn bit of good, either.

	Where do we go, now?  Depending on who you ask, you could end up
 spending hours staring at a giant white field, splattered with red and
 orange paint, or you could read some Kerouac or Vonnegut, or possibly even
 sit with a pen in your hand yourself.  I have decided, in my infinite quest
 to resolve this problem, to narrow down the search a little bit and see if
 I can't help anyone else lost in this predicament.

	Art in any form is inspiring.  But one does not nead to be create to
 be creative, one does not need to define to be definitive.  I have always
 found myself turned back to music, in all of its many forms and
 incarnations.  Such an artistic state so completely devoid of innovation
 and inspiration; such a cash machine full of waste and image in so many
 aspects.  One can only imagine from where my philosophies stem.  However,
 once every so often, something can sting and bite back right in the cyncial
 keister.

	"Words falling into my life what should I write?"

	Have you ever woken up?  Not as "in the morning" woken up, of course.
 Have you ever found your raison d'etre without trying, only to have it slap
 you in the face?  Have you ever sat in an empty void, pondering your
 existence, your reason for life, your complexity of emotions?  Have you ever
 explained yourself to someone in one fleeting thought?  Has anyone ever
 spent their time explaining their thoughts and emotions, only for you to
 discover that they just defined YOU, all that you are, and everything you've
 always hoped you would become?

	"Last night I just stayed at home alone
	I was tearing out the pages from my diary
	When a bird flew past my head
	So I put them back again 'cause I know
	It's alright to like the way I feel."

	And now I'm just crying at the thought of it all.  There's more than
 any words could ever explain... there's this chunk of the universe dubbed My
 Life, and it's all mine to share with whom I please.  But someone discovered
 me... someone has taken care of me and kept me with them, without either of
 our knowledge.  Something in this universe joined us together.  Then I found
 out.  Then, I woke up.

	How can words, how can music say so much?  How can the complete
 absence of true innovation--simply the presence of an abstract explanation--
 fill the void I've felt ever since I can remember?  It's the sheer
 hauntingness of it, the raw power and emotion, the helpless feeling that
 someone else knows you much more intimately than you've ever been honest
 enough with yourself to realize on your own.

	"There's no one to take my blame
	If they wanted to
	There's no one to keep me sane
	And it's all the same to you
	There's nowhere to set my aim
	So I'm everywhere
	Never come near me again
	Do you really think I need you?
	And I'll smile and I'll learn to pretend
	And I'll never be open again
	And I'll have no more dreams to defend
	And I'll never be open again."

	Fuck me, fuck... Damn you to hell, Kevin Moore, for writing these
 words, for forcing my mind to become obsessed to epic proportions.  Damn you
 for making me face my life.  Damn you for seeing who I am.  Damn you
 everywhere, because I love you, and I don't know where I'd be without your
 explanation, your insight, your understanding of night and day and all that
 is inbetween.  You read me.  You see me.  You don't know me, I don't know
 you, and that's the way it has to stay.  There really only needs to be one
 of us, but I'm struggling to be my own voice, too.  Maybe I'll just repeat
 everything you say.  There's no more explanations needed, are there?

	I really can't help but give credit where credit is due.  And with
 that, I have to dedicate this existence, this emotion, this life, to
 explanation.  I'm continuing the exploration here, Kevin, I'm going my own
 way now.  I'll still listen to what you have to say, but I'm me again, don't
 you see?  I am another night and day alliance.  I am slowly discovering
 these things that you've already spelled out for me.

	Screw innovation.  There's no such thing.  I can't wait to explain it
 to everyone.
