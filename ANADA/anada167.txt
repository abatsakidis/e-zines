 From:    Genie Davis <gdavis@EXD.CCS.UA.EDU>

        Since the U.S. presidential race is realistically a two-man race, I
 wholeheartedly believe that a vote for Nader would be equivalent to a vote
 for Bush, which weighs heavy on my conscience.  Also weighing on my
 conscience, however, is the belief that I should cast my vote for the person
 whom I consider to have the best policies, regardless of electability.

        For me, a couple of factors have weighted my decision (reluctantly)
 toward Gore:  #1.  I do NOT want GWB to appoint the next 3 or 4 Supreme
 Court justices.  Gore's choices would at least tend toward the moderate, if
 not liberal.  #2.  Gore may be a bore, but I'm looking for someone to lead
 the country, not entertain me.  And when I listen to Gore, I hear more
 substance coming from him than from Dubbya.  (Surprise.)  Gore's too
 centrist for my tastes, but I think he'll be a better environmental and
 social issues president than Dubbya.  (Surprise.)  #3.  Though I admire
 Nader's work, I am not sure if he's sufficiently strong as a presidential
 candidate to throw my wholehearted support behind his campaign.  I admit
 that a third-party candidate with political experience at the national level
 (as well as an outlook that I generally agree with, of course) would
 probably have me seriously considering trying to pull a "Ventura Victory,"
 but I don't see that happening with Nader.  (Ventura, to non-US people, is
 the current Minnesota governor, who ran as a Reform Party candidate and
 didn't have a snowball's chance in hell of winning.  But he did win.
 Whether this is good or bad depends on who you talk to.)  #4.  Gore does
 have the experience to back him up.  He has the advantage of working at the
 national level (and working with international concerns) for many years.

        Those are my reasons, summed up.  Ultimately, though, you have to go
 with your conscience.  If you feel strongly enough about voting for your
 preferred candidate (Nader) that you are willing to accept a Bushy victory,
 then vote accordingly.  If the prospect of a Bush victory is unthinkable to
 you, then vote accordingly. ;-)
