 I was blind to my hatred.

 I was blind to my emotions.

 The world in which I had any understanding was shrinking,
 The people I spoke to were not hearing what I thought I was saying,
 Everyday my fists were reddened, as were my eyes,
 Everyday my brain felt like a cube in my throbbing head,
 Its sharp edges scraping my skull.

 I had taken leave of my senses,
 Everyday I had to get home before someone who could incarcerate me got in my
 way,
 Everyday I was knocking things out of people's hands and quite obviously
 scaring all observers.
 
 Everyday I arrived home and slammed the door shut,
 And everyday I immediately dropped to my knees.
 
 The time was rapidly approaching.
