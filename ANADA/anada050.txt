 "The Rain Song"
 by Led Zeppelin

 This is the springtime of my loving-
 the second season I am to know
 You are the sunlight in my growing-
 so little warmth I felt before.
 It isn't hard to feel me glowing-
 I watched the fire that grew so low.
 It is the summer of my smiles-
 flee from me Keepers of the Gloom.
 Speak to me only with your eyes
 it is to you I give this tune.
 It isn't hard to recognise-
 these things are clear to all from time to time.

 Talk Talk-
 I felt the coldness of my winter
 I never thought it would ever go
 I cursed the gloom that set upon us
 but I know that I love you so
 but I know that I love you so.

 These are the seasons of emotion
 And like the winds they rise and fall
 This is the wonder of devotion-
 I see the torch we all must hold.
 This is the mystery of the quotient-
 Upon us all a little rain must fall.


 "Walking In My Shoes"
 by Depeche Mode

 I would tell you about the things they put me through
 The pain I've been subjected to
 But the Lord himself would blush
 The countless feasts laid at my feet
 Forbidden fruits for me to eat
 But I think your pulse would start to rush

 Now I'm not looking for absolution
 Forgiveness for the things I do
 But before you come to any conclusions
 Try walking in my shoes
 Try walking in my shoes

 You'll stumble in my footsteps
 Keep the same appointments I kept
 If you try walking in my shoes
 If you try walking in my shoes

 Morality would frown upon
 Decency look down upon
 The scapegoat fate's made of me
 But I promise now, my judge and jurors
 My intentions couldn't have been purer
 My case is easy to see

 I'm not looking for a clearer conscience
 Peace of mind after what I've been through
 And before we talk of any repentance
 Try walking in my shoes
 Try walking in my shoes

 You'll stumble in my footsteps
 Keep the same appointments I kept
 If you try walking in my shoes
 If you try walking in my shoes
 Try walking in my shoes

 Now I'm not looking for absolution
 Forgiveness for the things I do
 But before you come to any conclusions
 Try walking in my shoes
 Try walking in my shoes

 You'll stumble in my footsteps
 Keep the same appointments I kept
 If you try walking in my shoes
 You'll stumble in my footsteps
 Keep the same appointments I kept
 If you try walking in my shoes
 Try walking in my shoes
 If you try walking in my shoes
 Try walking in my shoes


 "In the Ghetto"
 by Elvis Presley

 As the snow flies
 On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
 A poor little baby child is born
 In the ghetto
 And his mama cries
 'cause if there's one thing that she don't need
 it's another hungry mouth to feed
 In the ghetto
 People, don't you understand
 the child needs a helping hand
 or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
 Take a look at you and me,
 are we too blind to see,
 do we simply turn our heads
 and look the other way
 Well the world turns
 and a hungry little boy with a runny nose
 plays in the street as the cold wind blows
 In the ghetto
 And his hunger burns
 so he starts to roam the streets at night
 and he learns how to steal
 and he learns how to fight
 In the ghetto
 Then one night in desperation
 a young man breaks away
 He buys a gun, steals a car,
 tries to run, but he don't get far
 And his mama cries
 As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
 face down on the street with a gun in his hand
 In the ghetto
 As her young man dies,
 on a cold and gray Chicago mornin',
 another little baby child is born
 In the ghetto


 "Killer's Lullaby"
 by Faithless

 I'm sittin at a coffee table
 unable to see straight
 Watchin parallel lines unwind and undulate
 Behind the main street window pane the scene's bleak;
 another train leavin' home,
 conceding defeat with a low moan.

 Hangin' in a sky made of stone
 Everybody's leavin' home
 I called my man Jerome
 To come meet me in the Twilight Zone
 Leave your mobile phone at home
 and come alone.

 I bought him coffee and a snack
 settled back,
 started speakin';
 he was tweakin'
 with the peak of his cap
 while I'm seekin'
 to discover what it takes
 to stay sober
 not cover my mistakes
 try to maybe make sense
 of the evidence,
 it's over.
 She's gone for good.
 Why should I lie?
 Singin' a killer's lullaby.
 Identified by the dying ring of her goodbye;
 the last thing ya hear
 before ya life disappear.

 "Is it better when you see her?"

 Nah, it just gets worse.
 Like my stomach'll burst
 Feel like I been cursed
 With seven centuries of bitter memories;
 Inadequacies
 of previous he's and she's
 I'm movin' round this old house for the last time
 Singin' my past crimes
 Been here for lifetimes
 Hearin' the chimes of the old clock
 we used to mock
 we got eternity for takin' stock;
 This place is like a padlock.
 You look shocked;
 Trust me.
 Nothin' ever moves but the dust
 There's just us
 And I'm here to torment and tease
 and that's how it was for centuries
 Me and my memories
 til you bought the keys,
 took a couple Saturdays
 An' moved in, runnin' from tragedies and boozin'
 Seven hundred years since I came here
 You appear, same hair, same quizzical stare

 I couldn't get near
 And the sheer frustration was more than I could bear.
 I was really cursed
 Thought I'd been through the worst part
 That was just the first part
 Just the start
 Every night, I'd been sittin' with drink
 Prickin' my heart
 In case the man she'd been chasin'
 Gets to first base'n
 I just can't escape
 I'm in bad shape
 You makin' love to someone else is more than I can take
 And so I make all the movement I can, to no avail
 Scream and yell
 Sinkin' deeper into my personal hell.

 I'm gettin' heated, I'm sorry.
 Have another coffee--
 I needed to release my sparrow chest
 from just a piece of this pressure
 Unless an escape route is found
 I'm goin' down underground
 Into lifetimes of pain, it's absurd;
 The heaviest chain is contained in the sound of one word.
 So I'm referred back to hell.
 Just as well; I hate needles and get twinges
 at the thought of syringes.

 J, I'm goin' insane with shame
 I dream I watch her makin' love over and over again
 With what I call a farmer's swine:
 Unintelligent, Pea-brained retard,
 whose dick is always hard
 Oh god.
 Of course I'm jealous,
 fella's oversexed,
 flexin' his pecs
 Jesus, what's he gonna make her do next?
 I'm mad vexed.
 The way she gently scratches his chest.
 Used to do that to me,
 back in 1253.
 Pity me, while you lie with your lover.
 I stare and suffer in despair
 While you ruffle his hair
 Unaware of who else is there.

 I move quick, I'm gonna try my trick one last time
 You know it's possible to vaguely define
 my outline
 When dust move in the sunshine.
 So I'm tryin' to change;
 vibrate myself to near human pitch
 Which remind me how I used to come unstitched
 And switch round the house in a blind rage
 It took years
 and an ocean of tears
 to find the key to this cage
 advance another stage
 into a new age
 (huh.) it's difficult to gauge
 but I know that I'll see you again,
 on that you may depend.
 I just don't know how or when.

 She's gone, my lost lover.

 Jerome took me home under steel skies
 Knowing I'm prone to dramatize
 But unknown for telling lies
 And what I verbalize,
 he can see behind my eyes.
 But why oh why do I
 identify killer lullabies
 and he surmised.

 No surprise, couldn't hear that
 close my eyes as he steers
 that old black BM(W?) home again,
 not knowin' how or not knowin' when.


 "Synchronicity II"
 by The Police

 Another suburban family morning
 Grandmother screaming at the wall

 We have to shout above the din of our Rice Crispies
 We can't hear anything at all
 Mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration
 But we know all her suicides are fake,

 Daddy only stares into the distance
 There's only so much more that he can take
 Many miles away something crawls from the slime at the
 Bottom of a dark Scottish lake

 Another industrial ugly morning
 The factory belches filth into the sky
 He walks unhindered through the picket lines today,
 He doesn't think to wonder why
 The secretaries pout and preen like cheap tarts in a red light street,
 But all he ever thinks to do is watch,
 And every single meeting with his so-called superior
 Is a humiliating kick in the crotch
 Many miles away something crawls to the surface of a dark Scottish lake

 Another working day has ended
 Only the rush hour hell to face
 Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes
 Contestants in a suicidal race
 Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance
 He knows that something somewhere has to break
 He sees the family home now looming in the headlights
 The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache
 Many miles away there's a shadow on the door of a cottage on the
 Shore of a dark Scottish lake

 Many miles away...
 Many miles away...


 "Institutionalized"
 by Suicidal Tendencies

 Sometimes I try to do things, and it just doesn't work out the way i want it
     to
 and I get real frustrated, and like, I try hard to do it and I take my time
 and it just doesn't work out the way I want it to, it's like I concentrate
     on it real hard,
 and it just doesn't work out,
 and everything I do and everything I try
 it never turns out, it's like I need time to figure these things out,
 there's always someone there going, hey mike, you know,
 we been noticing you've been having a lot of problems lately,
 you know, maybe get away, and like, maybe you should talk about it, you'd
     feel a lot better,
 I go no, it's ok, you know, I'll figure it out, just leave me alone
     I'll figure it out, you know, I'll just work it out myself, and they go,
 well you know, if you wanna talk about it I'll be here you know,
 and you'll probably feel a lot better if you talk about it,
 so why don't you talk about it,
 I go, no, I don't want to, I'm ok,
 I'll figure it out myself,
 but they just keep bugging me and they just keep bugging me,
 and it builds up inside,

 So you're gonna be institutionalized
 You'll come out brainwashed with bloodshot eyes
 You won't have any say
 They'll brainwash you until you see their way

 I'm not crazy - institutionalized
 You're the one who's crazy - institutionalized
 You're driving me crazy - institutionalized
 They stuck me in an institution
 Said it was the only solution
 To give me the needed professional help
 To protect me from the enemy, myself

 I was in my room and I was like just staring at the wall thinking about
     everything
 but then again I was thinking about nothing,
 and then my mom comes in and I didn't even know she was there
 and she calls my name and I didn't hear her
 and then she started screaming, MIKE, MIKE,
 and I go what, what's the matter,
 and she goes what's the matter with you?
 I go there's nothing wrong mom,
 and she goes don't give me that, you're on drugs,
 I go no mom, I'm not on drugs, I'm ok, I'm just thinking, why don't you get
     me a Pepsi?
 She goes, no, you're on drugs,
 I go mom, I'm okay, I'm just thinking,
 she goes no, you're not thinking, you're on drugs, normal people don't act
     that way.
 I go mom, just get me a Pepsi please, all I want is a Pepsi,
 and she wouldn't give it to me,
 all I wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi,
 and she wouldn't give it to me, just a Pepsi.

 They give you a white shirt with long sleeves
 Tied around you're back, you're treated like thieves
 Drug you up because they're lazy
 It's too much work to help a crazy

 I'm not crazy - institutionalized
 You're the one who's crazy - institutionalized
 You're driving me crazy - institutionalized
 They stuck me in an institution
 Said it was the only solution
 To give me the needed professional help
 To protect me from the enemy, myself

 I was sitting in my room and my mom and my dad came in
 and they pulled up a chair and they sat down,
 they go, mike, we need to talk to you, I go okay, what's the matter?
 They go me and your mom, we been noticing lately you've been having a lot of
     problems,
 and you've been going out for no reason,
 and we're afraid that you're going to hurt somebody,
 and we're afraid you're gonna hurt yourself,
 so we decided that it would be in your best interest
 if we put you somewhere where you could get the help that you need,
 and I go, wait, what are you talking about,
 we decided? my best interest?
 How do you know what MY best interest is?
 How can you say what MY best interest is?
 What are you trying to say? That I'm crazy?
 When I went to your schools, I went to your churches,
 I went to your institutional learning facilities.
 So how can you say I'm crazy?

 They say they're gonna fix my brain
 Alleviate my suffering and my pain
 But by the time they fix my head
 Mentally I'll be dead

 I'm not crazy - institutionalized
 You're the one who's crazy - institutionalized
 You're driving me crazy - institutionalized
 They stuck me in an institution
 Said it was the only solution
 To give me the needed professional help
 To protect me from the enemy, myself

 It doesn't matter, I'll probably get hit by a car anyway.


 "The Stars of Track and Field"
 by Belle and Sebastian

 make a new cult every day to suit your affairs
 kissing girls in english at the back of the stairs
 you're a honey, with a following of innocent boys
 they never know it
 because you never show it
 you always get your way
 they never know it
 because you enver know it
 you always get your way
 
 have you and her been taking pictures of your obsessions?
 because i met a kid who went through one of your sessions
 in his blue velour and silk
 you liberated
 a boy i never rated
 and now he's throwing discus
 for Liverpool and Widnes
 you liberated
 a boy i never rated
 and now he's doing business

 the stars of track and field, you are
 the stars of track and field, you are
 the stars of track and field are beautiful people
 
 could i write a piece about you now that you've made it?
 about the hours spent, the emptiness in your training
 you only did it so that you could wear
 your terry underwear
 and feel the city air
 run past your body

 could i write a requiem for you when you're dead?
 "she had the moves, she had the speed, it went to her head"
 she never needed anyone to get her round the track
 but when she's on her back
 she had the knowledge
 to get her into college


 "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"
 by Elton John

 When are you gonna come down
 When are you going to land
 I should have stayed on the farm
 I should have listened to my old man
 You know you can't hold me forever
 I didn't sign up with you
 I'm not a present for your friends to open
 This boy's too young to be singing the blues

 So goodbye yellow brick road
 Where the dogs of society howl
 You can't plant me in your penthouse
 I'm going back to my plough
 Back to the howling old owl in the woods
 Hunting the horny black toad
 Oh I've finally decided my future lies
 Beyond the yellow brick road

 What do you think you'll do then
 I bet that'll shoot down your plane
 It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
 To set you on your feet again
 Maybe you'll get a replacement
 There's plenty like me to be found
 Mongrels who ain't got a penny
 Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground


 "Truth?"
 by Def Leppard

 I've been burning and dousing the flames
 I feel the whiplash of the backlash on my face
 I melt to sleep at night but I wake to trip the day
 Never for you, never for me
 Would I kiss your feet of clay

 I'm still alive and so should I
 Soak up the wave of compromise
 Am I the victim of youth
 Is this the truth
 Why don't you tell me
 Why don't you tell me

 There's no conscience in charity or shame
 The voice deceives me but believe me, it's the same
 I see the black and white and the colour in the grey
 Better for me, better for you
 Gonna bleach it all away

 I'm still alive and so should I
 Soak up the wave of compromise
 Am I the victim of youth
 Is this the truth
 Why don't you tell me
 Why don't you tell me

 The left hand gives
 And the right hand takes away
 
 Why don't you tell me
 Why don't you tell me
 
 I'm still alive and so should I
 Soak up the wave of compromise
 I see the scars, I hear the lies
 So what's the truth
 Why don't you tell me


"You Should Be Dancing"
 by The Bee Gees

 My baby moves at midnight

 My woman takes me higher
 my woman keeps me warm
 
 What you doin' on your back aah
 What you doin'on your back aah?
 You should be dancing, yeah

 She's juicy and she's trouble
 She gets it to me good
 My woman gives me power
 Goes right down to my blood

 What you doin' on your back aah
 What you doin'on your back aah?
 You should be dancing, yeah
 dancing, yeah

 My baby moves at midnight
 goes right on till the dawn
 My woman takes me higher

 What you doin' on your back aah
 What you doin'on your back aah?
 You should be dancing, yeah

 "I Want Action"
 by Poison

 I want action tonight
 Satisfaction all night

 I grab my hat and I
 grab my shoes
 Tonight I'm gonna hit
 the streets and cruise

 Down the main strip and
 check it out
 With those schoolgirls
 a hangin' around

 Now I'm a sucker for a pretty face
 I don't care if she's in leather or lace
 cause I'm just lookin' for a little kiss

 Chorus:
 I want action tonight
 satisfaction all night
 You've got the love I need tonight

 Long legs and short skirts
 These girls hit me where it hurts

 I can't wait to get my hands on them
 I won't give up until they give in

 Now I'm not lookin' for a love that lasts
 I need a shot and I need it fast
 If I can't have her, I'll take her and make her

 Chorus, solo

 Hey, sweetheart, slide on in here
 No, not in the front, jump in the back
 Why?
 Cause there's something back there I want to show ya
 I want action tonight
 Satisfaction all night
 Ah, come on honey, I wasn't that bad!
 Oh, well

 Chorus out

 
 "Riot"
 by Spiderbait

 Body one
 Body two
 Skin and bone
 Me and you

 All the heat
 From the street
 In a heap
 Get a seat
 
 Take it out to see the riot
 Take it out to see the riot
 Take it out to see the riot
 You can go right out and buy it

 Get away
 Here to say
 Gotta say
 What a day
 
 What a love
 Make me cross
 (something)
 Let me die

 Take it out to see the riot
 Take it out to see the riot
 Take it out to see the riot
 You can go right out and buy it

 Take it out
 Take it out
 Take it out
 Take it out
 Take it out
 Take it out
 Take it out
 Take it out

 Take it out to see the riot
 Take it out to see the riot
 Take it out to see the riot
 You can go right out and buy it


 "Peace Sells"
 by Megadeth

 What do you mean, "I don't believe in God"?
 I talk to him every day.
 What do you mean, "I don't support your system"?
 I go to court when I have to.
 What do you mean, "I can't get to work on time"?
 I got nothing better to do
 And, what do you mean, "I don't pay my bills"?
 Why do you think I'm broke?
 Huh?

 Chorus
 If there's a new way,
 I'll be the first in line.
 But, it better work this time.

 What do you mean, "I hurt your feelings"?
 I didn't know you had any feelings.
 What do you mean, "I ain't kind"?
 I'm just not your kind.
 What do you mean, "I couldn't be president,
 of the United States of America"?
 Tell me something, it's still "We the people", right?

 Chorus (repeat)
 If there's a new way
 I'll be the first in line,
 But, it better work this time.

 Can you put a price on peace?
 Peace, Peace sells...,
 Peace, Peace sells...,
 Peace sells...,but who's buying?
 Peace sells...,but who's buying?
 Peace sells...,but who's buying?
 Peace sells...,but who's buying?
 No, peace sells...


 "Rhiannon"
 by Fleetwood Mac

 Rhiannon rings like a bell thru the night
 And wouldn't you love to love her
 She rules her life like a bird in flight
 And who will be her lover...
 And who will be her lover...

 All your life you've never seen
 A woman - taken by the wind
 Would you stay if she promised you heaven
 Will you ever win...

 She is like a cat in the dark
 And then she is the darkness
 She rules her life like a fine skylark-
 And when the sky is starless-

 All your life you've never seen-
 A woman - taken by the wind
 Would you stay if she promised you heaven
 Will you ever win...

 Dreams unwind. Love's a state of mind.


 "Ride"
 by Cathedral

 Lack-lustre vacuum magnetizes the land,
 scopeless material in ruthless demand,
 concrete spectacle superficially grand,
 divine animation buried in sand.

 Chorus:
 We'll rise from the ashes of stagnation,
 crystal warriors of damnation.

 Nullified grafters manufactured from the womb,
 out of the repro-clinic into household tomb.
 Drag the nothing tiring through coal-dark underground,
 drive the wheels of iron round and round.

 Chorus:
 We'll rise from the ashes of stagnation,
 crystal warriors of damnation.
 
 Scouring eyes
 sear through that book of lies,
 and to the truth,
 well our search is dignified.
 Whilst the yawny drone
 of physical machinery
 march in robot mode to terminal destiny.

 Microscopic observance, forsaken innerland,
 spiritual inertia, absorbed in bland,
 well our significance shan't sink in their charade,
 'cos through their drab pantomime I say we're gonna ride!
 
 Chorus:
 We'll rise from the ashes of stagnation,
 crystal warriors of damnation.

 "True Revolutionaries"
 by Dan Bern

 look ma'
 they're gonna fry tim mcveigh
 she said 'you mean that nice guy
 who was on the cover of all of those magazines?
 why would they want to go and do a think like that?'
 i said, 'well he killed all those people in
 oklahoma city'
 she said, 'nonsense, people don't kill people
 car bombs kill people'
 and i said, 'well yeah mom, but they have to do something with him'
 she said 'why don't they get mike tyson to bite off both his ears?'
 
 and i say, 'true revolutionaries never bomb buildings
 true revolutionareis never bomb buildings
 it attracts too much attention
 they never bomb buildings'
 
 a little girl down my block
 was born with silicon in her breasts
 turned out her grandmother and her mother
 had both had the inplants done
 and evolution took care of it this time
 and i started wondering why so many
 women with big breasts look so sad
 and i thought well maybe it has to do with
 the weight, the burden, they're asked to carry
 in the world
 defeated to be the objects of its desires
 and i wonder what burdens the rest of us are asked to carry
 
 and i said, 'true revolutionaries never bomb buildings
 true revolutionareis never bomb buildings
 it attracts too much attention
 they never bomb buildings'
 
 i decided i'd go out for a walk
 and do nothing except
 look everybody i see in the eyes
 and not be the first to avert my eyes,
 no matter what!
 i was planning to go out for ten or fifteen minutes
 but things started happening and i didn't return for two years
 by which time i was the heavyweight champion of the world
 and the expecting father of 16 children
 by 13 different women
 and while walking down 14th street between 7th and 8th avenues
 in new york city on my way to the subway to see the yankees
 i suddenly realized that you were my best friend in the world
 and i didn't stop grinning 'till the bottom of the seventh inning
 
 i was in a fishing village in coastal Spain
 it was our lady of abortion sunday
 all the pregnant ladies in their first trimester
 went before the priest to recieve the blessing of,
 'try again sometime, try again'
 the old barber had died his hair green for the occasion
 and pierced his nipple and was riding his skateboard to the
 statue of conan o'brien
 and he did backflips for the little kids
 who threw coins given to them by their parents
 a visiting lecturer, achingly handsome
 had just given a 'how to build bombs in your basement'
 seminar in the park
 and all the young girls put their notebooks away dreamily
 and put dandelions in their hair
 the chimpanzee who had managed to type out hamlet three years before
 was sitting in the third floor office of the driver's license building
 typing out zoning ordinances
 typing out learner's permits
 peewee herman was sitting in the central square in the grass
 naked and masturbating
 while all the townspeople moved to him slowly
 and kissed him slowly and sung lullabyes in the grass
 princess diana was driving through paris in an open car all by herself
 she waved, everybody waved back
 she went to the zoo and spent the rest of the afternoon
 feeding peanuts to the gorillas
 meanwhile, in berkeley and in grenwich village and in paris
 noone sits around coffee shops anymore
 talking revolution
 no, they get a coffee to go at starbucks
 they go back to their basektball games
 where they see who can jam
 who can take it to the rack and jump higher
 and they all wear baseball caps
 'cept they don't say 'yankees' or 'dodgers' or 'cardinals' anymore
 they say 'nike' 'reebock' and 'adidas'
 because the pro players don't play for teams anymore
 they play for shoe companies
 and the kids aren't fooled
 they're just biding their time
 waiting for the millenium
 when all the computers will crash
 because the best scientists in the world
 forgot to make them read zero
 
 oh, true revolutionaries never bomb buildings
 true revolutionareis never bomb buildings
 it attracts too much attention
 they never bomb buildings

 and i had a handful of dark thoughts
 and suddenly everything cleared
 and i realized that the only purpose really to revolution
 is to be able to love who you want
 how you want, when you want, where you want
 so i took off all my clothes
 stole a phone
 rowed out to the middle of a lake
 jumped in, looked back at you and said
 'come on! why don't ya get wet!'
 
 they never bomb buildings
 it attracts too much attention
 they never bomb buildings
 they never bomb buildings
 

 "Bad Girl"
 by Madonna

 Something's missing and I don't know why 
 I always feel the need to hide my feelings from you 
 Is it me or you that I'm afraid of 
 I tell myself I'll show you what I'm made of 
 Can't bring myself to let you go 

 Bridge (first time without first "I"):
 I don't want to cause you any pain 
 But I love you just the same 
 And you'll always be my baby 
 In my heart I know we've come apart 
 And I don't know where to start 
 What can I do, I don't wanna feel blue 

 Chorus1:
 Bad girl drunk by six 
 Kissing someone else's lips 
 Smoked too many cigarettes today 
 I'm not happy when I act this way 

 Chorus2:
 Bad girl drunk by six 
 Kissing some kind stranger's lips 
 Smoked too many cigarettes today 
 I'm not happy, I'm not happy 

 Something's happened and I can't go back
 I fall apart every time you hand your heart out to me 
 What happens now, I know I don't deserve you 
 I wonder how I'm ever gonna hurt you 
 Can't bring myself to let you go 

 (bridge)
 (chorus1) 
 (chorus2) 
 This way 

 (bridge)
 (chorus1, repeat) 
 I'm not happy this way 
 (chorus1) 
 (chorus2, substituting "someone else's" for "some kind stranger's") 
 This way 
 I'm not happy this way 
 Kissing some kind stranger's lips 


 "Home of the Brave"
 by Spiritualized

 I don't even feel it but lord how I need it
 When I'm not with her I'm not all myself
 Sometimes have my breakfast right off of a mirror
 And sometimes I'll have it right out of a bottle, Come on

 I'm gonna rip it up, tear it out, gotta get it off of my soul
 
 I don't even miss you but that's 'cos I'm fucked up
 I'm sure when it wears off that I will be hurting
 Just 'cos the sun shines when your out at night-time
 And just 'cos I feel bad and feelgood's a fineline, Come on
 
 I'm gonna rip it up, tear it up, gotta get you off of my soul
 

 "Halo"
 by Depeche Mode

 You wear guilt like shackles on your feet.  Like a halo in reverse.  I can
 feel the discomfort in your seat.  And in your head it's worse.  There's a
 pain.  A famine in your heart.  An aching to be free.  Can't you see?  All
 love's luxuries are here for you and me.  When our worlds, they fall apart.
 When the walls come tumbling in.  Though we may deserve it.  It will be
 worth it.  Bring your chains.  Your lips of tragedy.  And fall into my arms.
 And when our worlds, they fall apart. When the walls come tumbling in.
 Though we may deserve it.  It will be worth it.


 Album: We Can't Play
 by 10-97


 "All That I Know"

 Static hissing on the inside - Supposed to make sense,
 but it never does - Whirling images make my thoughts slow - And I can only
 wonder what it was - Now it's darker, moving in strobe - Broken visions
 of my graceful flight - When I return back to my mind - I feel sort of
 strange, and all that I know is it ain't right

 Going places that I've never been - Then returning to
 find that it's all the same - Asking questions, getting no reply - I decide
 that it's a crying shame - Pictures flashing, makes no sense at all - And
 I think my world's been thrown askew - What is normal? How can I really
 say? - I feel sort of different, and all that I know is I don't know what
 else I can do

 Tell me, when will I realize what life is all about? -
 Are there grand designs or are we on our own? - Reach out, talk, speak,
 shout, yell, share your wisdom with me - What? You say you don't do that
 kind of thing? I should have known... - F.I.O.Y. is the way, I guess, that
 it has to be - If life is a game, then it ought to be against the rules
 to quit - So yeah, I hear static hissing on the inside - It don't make
 a bit of sense, but all that I know is that it don't matter - A bit!


 "Another Day"
 
 I see a time when things weren't black, or white, or red,
 or green, but when they were always grey...I sit here and think about all
 the times that have been, and all the lost causes, and I wonder if any
 of it was ever worth it, and these insights haunt my mind...As I try to
 think back to the good times, and the times when all things were good,
 and there was no hate of frustration in the world...I try to think back...I
 try...but I can't remember...I just can't remember....

 I can only remember now, and now is the time for all good
 men to come to the aid of their enemies...they should pick up guns and
 kill innocent people to show their loyalty to the red, white, and blue...and
 every blessed child shall wave a flag to let the world know their confusion,
 and when they grow up their lives should end each time they pop a pill
 to forget their latest problem...and soon the nation's children will be
 grievers of Death and Ruin...and we shall live long and prosper...and father
 children who have no mothers...and they shall rock soulless babies to
     sleep...and
 fate will cut their threads away...and I shall find the magic that will
 take me away from all this pain...and I will remain forever in a place
 not far from here, and in this new existence I will live...and the little
 boxes will come together and gather into one giant, big box, and I'll be
 in it...and the lid will clamp down...and I will suffocate...and it will
 be my coffin...forever...and ever...and ever...amen....

 Another day begins for me and I don't know what to expect
 - I resist the forces that are pulling at me, all I want to do is disconnect
 (myself) - Step away and view my situation as an outsider looking in -
 If I could gain perspective, then soon, insight would follow, but my
     patience
 is wearing thin - Little by little, I have discovered that my life's a
 catch-22 - Sometimes it seems that I make the wrong decisions, no matter
 what I do - I used to think that you were on my side, I really thought
 you were my friend - But I'm afraid that was another mistake, and I hope
 things equal out in the end

 I can feel the raindrops falling from the leaden clouds
 - I think I can hear you calling, but I'm not sure you're around....
 
 I used to think that I could make a difference, I was
 important in the skein of things - But now I know better, and I've
 begun to feel the sorrow that deception brings - I watched the things that
 I had given value slowly slipping through my hands - So now I'll toss my
 fate in the air, and only time will tell where it lands

 I can feel my whole world shatter, there's nothing I can
 do - I know that it doesn't matter, cause it's all the same to you - I
 can feel my lifeblood seeping upon the ground divine - I think I can hear
 you weeping, but I can't be sure this time....

 When they said I could repent, that I could save my soul,
 tell me, were they only lies? - And why does it seem that everything I
 think is right is wrong, in Your eyes? - The fuel that feeds my fire will
 make me burn with a nether flame - I think I feel my funeral pyre, and
 my demons are chanting my name

 I can feel my soul escaping into the sea unknown - I know
 not the course it's taking, I just know that I'm alone - I can feel the
 fires, a sample, of how, when dead, I'll burn - I think I could be an
     example,
 but I'm not sure that you'll learn....(can anyone hear me? can anyone hear?
 i need help - oh god....)

 Evil is borne from me - Thy will be done, it is set free
 - I must not sleep, no chance to dream - And all that I can do is scream...


 "Body And Soul"

 Stop emotion for an instant as the doors seal closed from
 behind - She's still alone in the distance, I can hardly focus my eyes
 - Open your arms for possession of my memories of the place and time -
 Releasing all of my aggression, well, then she began to shine - I search
 myself and then I release to my body and my soul - I pick up the pieces
 and then I release to my body and my soul

 She should have mercy in my time of need - Uplifting me
 with just her love - I shed my tears that make up the sea - While her spirit
 flew on wings of a dove - I search myself and then I release to my body
 and my soul - I pick up the pieces and then I release to my body and my soul

 Your picture is that of perfection, in every delicate
 shape and curve - You were everything I'd ever wanted, yet so much more
 than I deserved - I can still feel your tremendous hold on my body and
     soul...

 She waved goodbye with a smile - And a gaze so cold and
 complete - Our thoughts connected for a while - Then her foot stepped on
 the golden street - I search myself and then I release to my body and my
 soul - I pick up the pieces and then I release to my body and my soul


 "Don't Shut Me Out"

 Somewhere, somewhere - You're all alone - You think I
 betrayed you, oh, no - Listen, listen - They're telling lies - If you don't
 believe me, then look in my eyes - Please don't shut me out - Until you
 know what it's all about - Please don't shut me out - Riding the storm of
     doubt

 Think back, think back - To our loving days - Remember
 your feelings, don't be afraid - Reach out, reach out - From your heart
 - So what if deception's gonna tear us apart? - Please don't shut me out
 - Until you know what it's all about - Please don't shut me out - Riding
 the storm of doubt


 "Dragons Of Aragon"

 Sleeping peacefully under a blanket of night, the Dragons
 of Aragon lie in eternal darkness - Their only desire: to sleep until the
 end of time - The lifetime of a man is but an instant to these mighty beasts
 - Supernatural boundaries have allowed no disturbances for centuries -
 But suddenly, without warning, they arise!

 One by one, they fly into the night, their majestic frames
 exuding an aura of unbridled power for which all other creatures yearn
 - Both irresistable and immovable, the might Dragons of Aragon search the
 world for that which has awakened them from their slumber.
 
 At once, their goal is in sight - A vicious battle ensues,
 but it is certain that whosoever feels the wrath of the Dragons of Aragon
 will die!

 "We are the Dragons of Aragon. Why have you disturbed
 us? Feel our talons...Feel our power...Feel our anger...Feel our fire!"
 
 (fly, fly away...fly, oh, fly!)


 "Good Life"

 You know it ain't right, but you do it anyway - You say
 that tomorrow is just like today - You're pulling me down, but you're
     getting
 higher - Everything you want, you're gonna take by fire - We've got it
 made, but times have changed for the good life - The good life

 Watch out, boys, she'll take you for a ride - She gets
 in your way and lets it slide, slide, slide - Too late, now, she threatens
 to kill - She'll take everything until she gets her fill - She's got it
 made, but times have changed for the good life - The good life


 "Insane"

 I can't believe we're still together, all that time we
 spent alone - We took our chances on now or never instead of being in love
 - I've got a piece of you inside me, calling to me in my dreams - Telling
 me your deepest fantasies - You're making me insane....

 We're casting shadows against the walls, nightmares in
 my eyes - We're going against all of the odds, baby, you and I - Love
     reaches
 higher and higher, thought we'd never come down - Now my heart is burning
 in fire, when you're not around - Insane....

 They said our love would never be, so we never gave it
 - You shouldn't believe everything you see, until you've seen with it -
 I've got a piece of you inside me, calling to me in my dreams - Telling
 me your deepest fantasies - You're making me insane....


 "The Mirror's Dead"

 Stopping all space and time, she left with a wink and
 a smile - Somehow, she's learned to cry without a tear in her eye - In
 the mirror's reflection emotion shines true - Nothing left for me, nothing
 left for you - And I can't understand why the mirror's so scared - Is this
 a vision, or is it just my head? The mirror's dead....

 Another moment in time brings another scream, but in her
 eyes you can see - A joyful expression and the pain that she feels - It
 slipped my mind along the way - I don't know the words for what I'm trying
 to say - And I can't understand why the mirror's so scared - Is this a
 vision, or is it just my head? The mirror's dead...

 Looking through the shattered glass to find the man I
 used to be - I look down at my bloody hands, and I wish the blood had come
 from me - It slipped my mind along the way - I don't know the words for
 what I'm trying to say - And I can't understand why the mirror's so scared
 - Is this a vision, or is it just my head? The mirror's dead....


 "My World"

 You can't begin to understand the wasteland of my mind
 - And if you searched across the land, you'd find no others of my kind
 - To know me is to hate me, to love me is a sin - Don't try to come inside,
 'cause I'll never let you in - This is my world

 You cannot come to know me or understand m ways - I see
 the world through a crystal lens, you see me through a haze - To know me
 is to hate me, to love me is a sin - Don't try to come inside, 'cause I'll
 never let you in - This is my world

 I am like the box that Pandora came to prize - And if
 you looked inside my head you wouldn't believe your eyes - You shouldn't
 call me crazy, that's not the thing to say - I see the same things that
 you see, i just see them a different way

 I know that I seem bitter, but how can I be pure when
 all my thoughts are poison and I do not know the cure? This is my world
 

 "Never Going To Let You Down"

 Giving all you got, one more shot - Tastes so bittersweet
 from her head to her feet - Don't be so alone, come to my arms - You can
 trust me, darling, can't you see? - I'm never going to let you down, no,
 never going to let you down

 You're in good hands, I'm not going to miss - Everything
 you want, honey, that's what I want - You come down hard on me, that's
 what I like to see - Break out of these ropes and chains, then I'll be
 free again - I'm never going to let you down, no, never going to let you
     down


 "Tribulation"

 Can you see me? Can you hear me? Can you reach me? Don't ignore me

 As I look toward the nighttime sky - I chase the stars,
 but they pass me by - I'm aiming high, but I'm landing low - And soon I'll
 crumble as did Jericho

 Would you know me? Would you show me? Would you hurt me?
 Don't desert me
 
 I need your light when the darkness surrounds - I once
 was lost, still I'm not found - Because when I hear the wise man preach
 - I fear the promised land is out of reach

 Can you see me? Would you want to be me? Stop your crying...Everyone is
     dying

 As I look toward the nighttime sky - I know that
 none are more or less than I - I call it faith because I have no proof
 - But still, this, I believe, is truth - You have saved me - You must love
 me


 "The Way It Goes"

 Trust - What does trust have to do with anything? Between
 the best of lovers the pendulum swings - In any case, there's bound to
 be an accident - Thing will always occur when you're full of confidence
 - If you want to be somebody - If you want to be on top of things - You've
 got to walk with the big dogs - That's just the way it goes

 With every single blow you turn to dust - And then you
 try to forget it, like most of us - Better save your soul for something
 as pure - But then you feel the urge, and you're not sure - If you want
 to be somebody - If you want to be on top of things - You've got to walk
 with the big dogs - That's just the way, the way it goes

 Well, I'm eager to please, but I don't want to sacrifice
 - If you can't accept me, then I don't have to tell you twice - Still,
 I know that the cold war rages on - Don't worry about me, 'cause I'm already
 too far gone

 Unfortunately, I see the night is coming - I close my
 eyes, I hear the voices calling - The tears that I weep are so hollow
 sounding
 - Love injured me, and it feels like I'm drowning - Lay me down to sleep,
 and let the earth cover me - And my final rest will be the ultimate test

 Well, I'm eager to please, but I do things my way - If
 you want to leave, then I can't make you stay - Still I know that the cold
 war rages on, inside me - The ropes that bound me are going to get me free
 - Lay me down to sleep, and let the earth cover me - And my final rest
 will be the ultimate test

 These heartache memories of mine - Do you think it's time?
 To lay things to rest - I've given it all my best - Lay me down to sleep,
 and let the earth cover me - And my final rest will be the ultimate test


 "Circumstances"
 by Rush
 
 A boy alone, so far from home,
 Endless rooftops from my window.
 I felt the gloom of empty rooms
 On rainy afternoons.
 Sometimes in confusion,
 I felt so lost and disillusioned,
 Innocence gave me confidence
 To go up against reality.

 Chorus
 All the same we take our chances,
 Laughed at by time,
 Tricked by circumstances.
 Plus ça change,
 Plus c'est la meme chose
 The more that things change,
 The more they stay the same.
 
 Now I've gained some understanding
 Of the only world that we see.
 Things that I once dreamed of
 Have become reality.
 These walls that still surround me
 Still contain the same old me,
 Just one more who's searching for
 A world that ought to be.
 
 Chorus


 "The P is Free"
 by Boogie Down Productions
 
 Yes, Scott LaRock you know you rule hip-hop
 Yes, Mr. Lee you can rule hip-hop
 And, B-57 you can rule hip-hop
 But, KRS-One rule it non-stop
 When I'm in Brooklyn, yes, we rulin hip-hop
 When I'm in Manhattan, we rulin hip-hop
 When I'm in Queens, we rulin hip-hop
 And when in Staten Island we rulin hip-hop
 But in the Bronx, we rulin y'all tonight
 But in the Bronx, we rulin y'all tonight
 We come to rock you whether you're Black or you're white
 Cos KRS-One you know I'm never ?frank?
 Come catch a star

 The girlies are free
 Cos the crack costs money
 Oh yeah
 I say the girlies are free
 Cos the crack costs money
 Oh yeah
 
 Ridin one day on my freestyle fix
 Jammin to a tape Scott LaRock had mixed
 I said to myself "This tape sound funky"
 Ridin past the 116th Street junkie
 Thought I saw Denise but I was only assumin
 Took another look and that butt was boomin
 Did a little trick on my freestyle fix
 And I was right beside the girl, she was all on the tip
 She said "Hi, DJ KRS"
 She kissed me on my neck so I gave her a peck
 She said "I'm really in a hurry so I cannot wait
 If you give me a life while we ride to the ?bait?"
 She jumped on my bike, I said "Huh, what's your stop?"
 She said "Right around the corner to the crack spot
 If you buy me a crack I'll know how to act
 But if you don't, you might as well step back"
 I said "Now how the hell we jump off to this?
 I'm doin you a favor, I'm givin you a lift"
 She said "KRS, you know it goes"
 I said "Yeah, you little.....it seems that you're a hoe"
 I did a little trick on my freestyle fix
 And she was right on the ground lookin after it
 Because...

 A girl tried to take my out one day
 For a play, not your everyday ?trey?
 We walked to the spot, she says she want a rock
 I looked in my pocket, didn't have a lot
 I said "You better get yourself a job"
 She tried to tell me that times were hard
 I told the hoe, I said "Yo, that's not my fault
 You need a vault", I'm out to assault
 Any girl I find who try to take my for mine
 I'm gonna have to ?pin? it just another time
 But...


 "Oh Comely"
 by Neutral Milk Hotel

 Oh comely
 I will be with you when you lose your breath
 Chasing the only meaningful memory you thought you had left
 With some pretty bright and bubbly terrible scene
 That was doing her thing on your chest
 But oh comely
 It isn't as pretty as you'd like to guess
 Oh comely
 All of your friends are letting you blow
 Bristling and ugly
 Bursting with fruits falling out from the holes
 Of some pretty bright and bubbly friend
 You could need to say comforting things in your ear
 But oh comely
 There isn't such one friend that you could find here
 Standing next to me
 He's only my enemy
 I'll crush him with everything I own
 
 Your father made fetuses
 With flesh licking ladies
 While you and your mother
 Were asleep in the trailer park
 Thunderous sparks from the dark of the stadiums
 The music and medicine you needed for comforting
 So make all your fat fleshy fingers to moving
 And pluck all your silly strings
 And bend all your notes for me
 Soft silly music is meaningful magical
 The movements were beautiful
 All in your ovaries
 All of them milking with green fleshy flowers
 While powerful pistons were sugary sweet machines
 Smelling of semen all under the garden
 Was all you were needing when you still believed in me
 
 And I know they buried her body with others
 Her sister and mother and 500 families
 And will she remember me 50 years later
 I wished I could save her in some sort of time machine
 Know all your enemies
 We know who are enemies are
 
 Goldaline my dear
 We will fold and freeze together
 Far away from here
 There is sun and spring and green forever
 But now we move to feel
 For ourselves inside some stranger's stomach
 Place your body here
 Let your skin begin to blend itself with mine


 "Dope Hat"
 by Marilyn Manson

 I peek into the hole, I struggle for control
 The children love the show, but they fail to see the anguish in my eyes
 Fail to see the anguish in my eyes

 I scratch around the brim, I let my mind give in
 The crowd begins to grin, but they seem to scream when darkness fills my
     eyes
 Seem to scream when darkness fills my eyes, it's no surprise

 Fail to see the tragic, turn it into magic
 My big top tricks will always make you happy, but we all know the hat is
     wearing me

 My bag is in the hat, it's filled with this and that
 My vision's getting fat, the rabbit's just a monkey in disguise
 Stars and pills and needles dance before our eyes
 They will bite the hand if it is slower than the quickness of their
     scrutinizing eyes

 Fail to see the tragic, turn it into magic
 My big top tricks will always make you happy, but we all know the hat is
     wearing me
 Chicanery will always make you happy, but we all know the hat is wearing me

 Spanish galleon
 Rising from the Finley plain
 Got my horse and gun
 I'm riding from the sun

 "THAT DARN CAT"
 by Richard Kendall Gibbs

 (THAT DARN CAT)
 SOMETIMES LIFE IS JUST THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
 SOMETIMES EVERYTHING GOES TO THE DOGS
 PEOPLE CALLING OUT HIS NAME LIKE HE'S SUPPOSED TO CARE
 THEY CALL HIM THAT DARN CAT

 (THAT DARN CAT)
 CALL HIM TILL YOU'RE BLUE BUT DON'T EXPECT HIM TO RESPOND
 (THAT DARN CAT)
 EVEN THOUGH IT'S YOU HE'S STILL A CAT
 (THAT DARN CAT)
 WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE HIM DO, GO CHASE A STICK DOWN ON THE LAWN?
 (THAT DARN CAT)
 IF YOU WANT YOUR SHOES GO GET A LAB
 (THAT DARN CAT)
 CATCH HIM IF YOU CAN, YOU KNOW YOU'RE JUST A MAN
 THAT IS THAT DARN CAT

 (THAT DARN CAT)
 IF YOU ARE A MOUSE YOU BETTER RUN BACK TO YOUR HOLE
 (THAT DARN CAT)
 IF YOU ARE A DOG YOU'D BETTER HIDE
 (THAT DARN CAT)
 HE'S GOT SHARPER CLAWS THAN TEETH AND TONS OF SELF-CONTROL
 MOST OF ALL THE CAT HAS GOT HIS PRIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!

 HE'LL NEVER LEAVE YOUR SIDE OR POUT OR WORK FOR FOOD
 FOR THAT'S NOT THAT DARN CAT

 YOU CAN YELL OUT ALL YOU WANT, SAY, "HERE KITTY!!!!!!!!!!"
 JUST BE SURE YOU'VE GOT SOME TUNAFISH
 LIVES THE LIFE HE LIKES, HE LETS YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE THE MAN
 BUT YOU KNOW HE'S THAT DARN CAT
 (THAT DARN CAT)
 THAT IS THAT DARN CAT
 (THAT DARN CAT)
 OH WELL TO THAT DARN CAT
 (THAT DARN CAT)
 SO LONG TO THAT DARN CAT
 (THAT DARN CAT)
 SO LONG


 "Blue Dress"
 by Depeche Mode

 Put it on
 And don't say a word
 Put it on
 The one that I prefer
 Put it on
 And stand before my eyes
 Put it on
 Please don't question why
 Can you believe
 Something so simple
 Something so trivial
 Makes me a happy man
 Can't you understand
 Say you believe
 Just how easy
 It is to please me
 Because when you learn
 You'll know what makes the world turn

 Put it on
 I can feel so much
 Put it on
 I don't need to touch
 Put it on
 Here before my eyes
 Put it on
 Because you realise
 And you believe
 Something so worthless
 Serves a purpose
 It makes me a happy man
 Can't you understand
 Say you believe
 Just how easy
 It is to please me
 Because when you learn
 You'll know what makes the world turn


 "Up All Night"
 by Slaughter

 When evenin' comes
 I am alive
 I love to prowl around
 In the streets
 It's the moonlight
 That controls my mind
 Now I've got the power to speak

 Awake from dusk to dawn
 Watchin' the city lights
 Stars are shinin' down
 They'll be shinin' down
 On you and I
 And when the mornin' comes
 And I'll hold you
 'Til the mornin' light

 Everybody sing it now
 Up all night, sleep all day
 Up all night, sleep all day

 Drivin' down the boulevard
 All alone
 The neon signs
 Are callin' your name
 Find me in the corner
 Havin' the time of my life
 You'd think you'd wanna do the same

 Up all night, sleep all day
 Up all night, sleep all day
 Maybe we can just stay up
 Twenty four hours a day

 Up all night, sleep all day
 Up all night, sleep all day


 "This Charming Man"
 by The Smiths

 punctured bicycle
 on a hillside desolate
 will Nature make a man of me yet?

 then in this charming car
 this charming man

 why pamper life's complexities
 when the leather runs smooth
 on the passenger seat?

 i would go out tonight
 but i haven't got a stitch to wear
 the man said "it's gruesome
 that someone so handsome should care"

 a jumped-up pantry boy
 who never knew his place
 he said "return the ring"
 (he knows so much about these things)

 this charming man


 "Angel"
 by Aerosmith

 I'm alone, yeah, I don't know if I can face the night
 I'm in tears, and the cryin' that I do is for you

 I want your love, let's break the walls between us
 Don't make it tough, I'll put away my pride
 Enough's enough, I've suffered and I've seen the light

 Baby,
 (Chorus)
 You're my Angel, come and save me tonight
 You're my Angel, come and make it alright
 You're my Angel, come and save me tonight

 Don't know what I'm gonna do about this feelin' inside
 Yes, it's true, loneliness took me for a ride
 Without your love, I'm nothing but a beggar
 Without your love, a dog without a bone
 What can I do, I'm sleepin' in this bed alone

 Baby,
 (Chorus)

 You're the reason I live
 You're the reason I die
 You're the reason I give
 When I break down and cry
 Don't need no reason why

 Baby, baby, baby
 (Repeat Chorus)


 "The Butcher"
 by Leonard Cohen

 I came upon a butcher,
 he was slaughtering a lamb,
 I accused him there
 with his tortured lamb.
 He said, "Listen to me, child,
 I am what I am
 and you, you are my only son."

 Well, I found a silver needle,
 I put it into my arm.
 It did some good,
 did some harm.
 But the nights were cold
 and it almost kept me warm,
 how come the night is long?

 I saw some flowers growing up
 where that lamb fell down;
 was I supposed to praise my Lord,
 make some kind of joyful sound?
 He said, "Listen, listen to me now,
 I go round and round
 and you, you are my only child."

 Do not leave me now,
 do not leave me now,
 I'm broken down
 from a recent fall.
 Blood upon my body
 and ice upon my soul,
 lead on, my son, it is your world
 

 "A Day In The Life"
 by The Beatles

 I read the news today oh boy
 About a lucky man who made the grade
 And though the news was rather sad
 Well I just had to laugh
 I saw the photograph.

 He blew his mind out in a car
 He didn't notice that the lights had changed
 A crowd of people stood and stared
 They'd seen his face before
 Nobody was really sure If he was from the House of Lords.

 I saw a film today oh boy
 The English Army had just won the war
 A crowd of people turned away
 but I just had to look
 Having read the book.

 I'd love to turn you on

 Woke up, fell out of bed,
 Dragged a comb across my head
 Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
 And looking up I noticed I was late.

 Found my coat and grabbed my hat
 Made the bus in seconds flat
 Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
 Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

 I read the news today oh boy
 Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
 And though the holes were rather small
 They had to count them all
 Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

 I'd love to turn you on


 "Piano Man"
 by Billy Joel

 It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
 The regular crowd shuffles in
 There's an old man sitting next to me
 Makin' love to his tonic and gin
 He says, "Son, can you play me a melody?
 I'm not really sure how it goes
 But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
 When I wore a younger man's clothes"

 La la la, de de da
 La la, de de da da da

 Chorus:
 Sing us a song, you're the piano man
 Sing us a song tonight
 Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
 And you've got us feelin' alright

 Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
 He gets me my drinks for free
 And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
 But there's someplace that he'd rather be
 He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me."
 As the smile ran away from his face
 "Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
 If I could get out of this place"

 Oh, la la la, de de da
 La la, de de da da da

 Now Paul is a real estate novelist
 Who never had time for a wife
 And he's talkin' with Davy who's still in the navy
 And probably will be for life
 And the waitress is practicing politics
 As the businessmen slowly get stoned
 Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
 But it's better than drinkin' alone

 Chorus

 It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
 And the manager gives me a smile
 'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
 To forget about life for a while
 And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
 And the microphone smells like a beer
 And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
 And say, "Man, what are you doin' here?"

 Oh, la la la, de de da
 La la, de de da da da

 Chorus


 "I Remember You"
 by Skid Row

 Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
 The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
 And all the tears you cried, that called my name
 And when you needed me I came through

 I paint a picture of the days gone by
 When love went blind and you would make me see
 I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes
 So that I knew you were there for me
 Time after time you were there for me

 Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
 Love letters in the sand - I remember you
 Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
 I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you

 We spend the summer with the top rolled down
 Wished ever after would be like this
 You said I love you babe, without a sound
 I said I'd give my life for just one kiss
 I'd live for your smile and die for your kiss

 Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
 Love letters in the sand - I remember you
 Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
 I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you

 We've had our share of hard times
 But that's the price we paid
 And through it all we kept the promise that we made
 I swear you'll never be lonely

 Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
 Washed away a dream of you
 But nothing else could ever take you away
 'Cause you'll always be my dream come true
 Oh my darling, I love you

 Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
 Love letters in the sand - I remember you
 Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
 I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you

 Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
 Love letters in the sand - I remember you
 Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
 I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you


 "Three Little Pigs"
 by Green Jello/y

 Why don't you sit right back and I, I may tell you a tale
 A tale of three little pigs and a BIG BAD wolf

 Well, the first little piggy well, he was kind of a hippy
 spent most of his day just dreaming on the city
 and then one day he bought a guitar
 he moved to Hollywood to become a star
 living on the farm he knew nothing of the city
 built his house on straw - what a pity
 then one day jamming on some chords
 along came the wolf knocking on his door

 Little pig, little pig, let me in.
 not by the hair of my chinny chin chin
 Little pig, little pig, let me in.
 not by the hair of my chinny chin chin
 Well I'm huffing, I'm puffing I'll blow your house in
 Huffing, Puffing, blow your house in
 Huffing and I'm puffing, and I'll blow your house in

 Well the second little piggy well, he was kind of stocky
 spent most of his day just ganja smoking
 huffing and a phuffing down the venice beach
 getting paid money for religious speech
 built his shelter from many garbage picks
 mostly made up of cans and sticks
 then one day he was cracking off a Marley
 along came the wolf on his big bad Harley

 Little pig, Little pig, let me in
 not by the hair of my chinny chin chin
 Little pig, Little pig, let me in
 not by the hair of my chinny chin chin
 Well I'm huffing, I'm puffing I'll blow your house in
 Huffing, Puffing, blow your house in
 Huffing and I'm puffing I'll blow your house in

 Well the third little piggy the straight A student
 his daddy was a rock-star named Pig Nugent
 earned his masters degree from Harvard college
 built his house from his architect knowledge
 a tri-level mansion hollywood hills
 daddy's rock stardom paid for the bills
 then one day came the old house smasher
 the big bad wolf, the little piggy slasher

 Little pig, little pig, let me in
 not by the hair of my chinny chin chin
 Little pig, Little pig, let me in
 not by the hair of my chinny chin chin
 Well I'm huffing, I'm puffing I'll blow your house in
 Huffing, Puffing, blow your house in
 Well i'm huffing, i'm puffing I'll blow your house in
 Huffing , Puffing , blow your house in Huffing and I'm puffing, and I'll blow your house in

 Well the big bad wolf well he huffed and he puffed all that he could
 and lo and behold the little piggy house stood
 "It's made out of concrete" the little piggy shouted
 the wolf just frowned as he pouted
 so they called nine eleven like any piggy would
 they sent out rambo just as fast as they could

 Yo! Wolf-face, I'm your worst nightmare
 Your ass is mine

 Well the wolf fell dead as you can plainly see
 And thats the end of the story for you and me
 it still gives a lesson, you just may
 hear the big wolf the little piggies say:
 Little pig, Little pig, let me in
 not by the hair of my chinny chin chin
 Little pig, Little pig, let me in
 not by the hair of my chinny chin chin
 Well I'm huffing, I'm puffing I'll blow your house in
 Huffing, Puffing, blow your house in
 Huffing and I'm puffing, and I'll blow your house in

 And the moral of this story is that bands with no talent
 can easily amuse idiots with a stupid puppet-show


 "R.E.A.L.I.T.Y."
 by KRS-One

 Reality, ain't always the truth
 Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth

 "These are the streets!
  Shit is real out here!
  This ain't no fuckin joke!"

 I lived in a spot called Millbrooke Projects
 The original Criminal Minded rap topic
 With twenty cents in my pocket I saw the light
 If you're young gifted and black, you got no rights
 Your only true right, is a right to a fight
 and not a fair fight, I wake up wonderin who died last night
 Everyone and everything is at war
 Makin my poetic expression hardcore
 I ain't afraid to say it, and many can't get with it
 At times in my life, I was a welfare recipient
 I ate the free cheese, while the church said believe
 and went to school everyday, like a god damn fool
 Well anyway, here I am, chillin at the party
 Brothers lookin at me like they wanna kill somebody
 A cypher manifested in the center of the jam
 I got to show these wack rappers really who I am
 It's me against them, so I clear the phlegm
 and wage the war, hardcore to the end
 For someone lookin inside, yeah from the out
 it seems like disrespect is what rap is all about
 But hip-hop as a culture, is really what we give it
 But sometimes the culture contradicts how we live it
 Cause every black kid lives two and three lives
 The city's a jungle, only the strong will survive
 
 Reality, ain't always the truth
 Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
 Reality, ain't always the truth
 Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
 
 Every single day I hear lie after lie
 Like "Black people don't die, we multiply"
 So when I kick a rhyme I represent how I feel
 The sacred street art of keepin it real
 Why I gotta listen, to somebody else?
 How they got wealth, let me talk about myself
 But all I really got is hip-hop and a glock
 The results are obvious, if I'm confined to my block
 Occasionally, in the city I'm released
 to meet other beasts, lookin for the feast
 We grunt and growl, on the prowl, as the air gets thinner
 "Yo yo there he go, him," there's the dinner
 White meat, carryin a bag of some sort
 Life is short, white meat is quickly caught
 A scuffle a muffle yet none of us hesitated
 Like Mother Africa, white meat is violated
 We quickly dissapear, like Santa's little elves
 And go into a area to fight amongst ourselves
 We say, "peace/piece" cause that's what we really want
 A piece of the pie that America flaunts
 
 Reality, ain't always the truth
 Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
 Reality, ain't always the truth
 Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
 
 "Oh shit!"

 The truth is that police must serve and protect
 REALITY is black youth is shown no respect
 The truth is government has a war against drugs
 REALITY is government is ruled by thugs
 With all this technology, above and under
 Humanity still hunts down one another
 Rappers display artistic cannibalism
 through lyricism, we fight each other over rhythm
 Through basic animal instincts, we think
 So the battle for mental territory is glory, end of story

 Reality, ain't always the truth
 Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
 Reality, ain't always the truth
 Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
 Yeah
 
 "These are the streets!
  Shit is real out here!
  This ain't no fuckin joke!"


 "Jesus"
 by Spiderbait

 I ride the highway with Jesus
 He drives the bus when I sleep
 We're taking two of his creatures
 And dropping them off down the street

 Heeyyyyy-eyy-eyy-eyy-eyyyyyyy-eyy-eyyyyy!
 I think we're lost Mr Jesus
 I think we're lost without a trace
 He said 'Don't worry little lady,
 My old man helped build this place'

 Heeyyyyy-eyy-eyy-eyy-eyyyyyyy-eyy-eyyyyy!
 My mum and dad love you Jesus
 
 My mum and dad say you're dead
 
 They say they'll love you forever
 
 They've got you tattooed to their heads
 
 hey..


 "Gaslighting Abbie"
 by Steely Dan

 One plush summer you come to me ripe and ready
 And bad through and through
 With that deep mystical soul synergy pumping steady
 Between me and you
 Lovin' all the beautiful work we've done, cara mia
 And it's barely July
 If we keep on boppin' until Labor Day
 Li'l miz Abbie - bye bye
 What will it be - some soothing herb tea?
 That might be just the thing
 Let's say we spike it with Deludin
 Or else - maybe tonight a hand of solitaire
 
 Flame is the game
 The game we call gaslighting Abbie
 It's a luscious invention for three
 One summer by the sea

 With the long weekend that's comin' up fast
 Let's get busy
 There's just too much to do
 That black mini looks just like the one she's been missin'
 Feels good on you
 There's a few items we need in town - allez-vous girl
 There's no time to waste
 Such as fresh cable and fifteen watt bulbs
 Couple dozen - it's a big old place
 Let's keep it light - we'll do a fright night
 With blood and everything
 Some punky laughter from the kitchen
 And then - a nice relaxing hand of solitaire

 Flame is the game
 The game we call gaslighting Abbie
 It's a luscious invention for three
 One summer by the sea

 You can choose the music
 I'll set up my gear
 Later on we'll chill and watch the fireworks from here
 How can you knock this mighty spitelock
 Check out the work itself
 A mix of elegance and function
 That's right - a tweak or two and then she's out of here
 

 "Rocket Man (I Think It's Going To Be A Long Long Time)"
 by Elton John

 She packed my bags last night pre-flight
 Zero hour nine a.m.
 And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
 I miss the earth so much I miss my wife
 It's lonely out in space
 On such a timeless flight

 And I think it's gonna be a long long time
 Till touch down brings me round again
 to find I'm not the man they think I am at home
 Oh no no no
 I'm a rocket man
 Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone

 Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
 In fact it's cold as hell
 And there's no one there to raise them if you did
 And all this science I don't understand
 It's just my job five days a week

 A rocket man, a rocket man
 And I think it's gonna be a long long time...


 "...Sadistic"
 by Stereolab

 I cannot believe what I do not understand
 (It's just impossible to believe what I don't understand)
 Understanding and belief should be connected
 (understanding is the prime condition to faith)
 Those who don't get it yet believe are hypocrites
 (those who do not understand yet say they believe are hypocrites,
 anything which is beyond the limits of human reason is illusion, illusion,
 illusion)

 You have done me no service no you have not helped me
 (all you did was confuse but not enlighten my mind)
 Therefore I owe you not gratitude but hatred
 (nature is vice as much as it is virtue, maybe everything derives from one
 first cause Or:a trillion times as much as it might mean to you, ...
 in which there is neither reason nor wisdom, nor wisdom)

 It is amusing to see to what extravagant length
 (man has taken fanaticism and imbecility to)
 Excesses so unspeakable, unbearable
 (the catalog of aberrations is invariably fascinating to contemplate, all we
 need from morality is contained in those words; make others happy as you
 yourself would be, and serve them in the way that you would yourself be
 served, the sole requirement is a good heart, a good heart, a good heart)...


 "Sacred"
 by Depeche Mode

 Sacred
 Holy
 To put it in words
 To write it down
 That is walking on hollowed ground
 But it's my duty
 I'm a missionary

 So here is my confesion
 It's an obsession
 I'm a firm believer
 And a warm receiver
 And I've made my decision
 This is religion
 There's no doubt
 I'm one of the devout
 Trying to sell the story
 Of love's eternal glory

 Spreading the news around the world
 Taking the word to boys and girls
 I'm a firm believer
 And a warm receiver
 And I will go down on my knees
 When I see beauty
 There's no doubt
 I'm one of the devout
 Trying to sell the story
 Of love's eternal glory

 Sacred
 Holy
 To put it in words
 To write it down
 That is walking on hollowed ground

 "Johnny Sunshine"

 He took the car, it was my favorite one
 Little white Dart and drove it to Idaho
 You took the rug
 Red and white checkerboard
 Rolled it right up and took it to Idaho

 You left me nothing
 You left me nothing
 Johnny Sunshine

 You took the horse
 It was a thoroughbred
 Saddled it up out on the interstate
 You took my kid, it was my only one
 Smart little bitch, and drove her to Idaho

 You left me nothing
 You left me nothing
 Johnny Sunshine

 You left me nothing
 You left me nothing
 Johnny Sunshine

 You took the house
 I went and changed the locks
 Now I am stuck living out of a box
 You took my car, it was my favorite one
 Little white Dart and drove it to Idaho

 You left me nothing
 You left me nothing
 Johnny Sunshine


 "Elvis Be True"

 Everyone's talking 'bout Elvis
 Cause it seems like the thing that we do
 Elvis is walking round listlessly
 Seems he can't even die if he wanted to
 It's a bad business to be in
 You don't get thanked and you don't get paid
 It's a hard world to be in with
 And to end with and to think about leaving behind

 Finding the body in Memphis
 Waiting five hours to get into Graceland
 Is this anybody's idea of a good time or a good joke
 Airport biographies are usually true
 Fame and fortune took it's toll
 He's not the king or rock and roll anymore
 He's just a junkie redneck

 Threw a sheet over your head
 Fold your arms across your chest
 Lie back in bed,  you can call folks constantly tomorrow
 Oh, everyone's talking 'bout Elvis
 Cause it seems like a thing that we do
 Elvis is living too fat and slow now
 To care what we say about him
 Picking up hitchhiking Elvises
 Christening babies at the foot of his grave
 He watching tv and laughing to himself
 Just had to tell someone how he did it

 Elvis be good to me
 Elvis be true
 Elvis I love you
 Elvis be true
 Elvis be near me
 Elvis be mine
 Elvis come back to me
 Please Elvis be kind
 Everything's coming up roses
 Everything's coming up Elvis
 Everything's coming up roses
 Everything's coming up Elvis
 Elvis
 Elvis
 Elvis be true

 And do it do it do it till you're bone dry
 Do it till you're all worn out
 Just do it do it do it till your bone dry
 Do it there is no doubt
 Do it there is no doubt

 I'm gonna give you head even if it kills you
 I'm gonna give you head even if you die
 I'm gonna give you head, better get used to it
 There's no use in fighting because it's do it or die
 Fuck or die

 Every time I see your face I get all wet between my legs
 Every time you pass me by I heave a sigh of pain

 (Over voice)
 Every time I see your face I think of things not pure and chaste
 I want to fuck you like a dog
 I'll take you home and make you like it
 Everything you ever wanted
 Everything you ever thought of
 Is everything I'll do to you
 I'll fuck you and your girlfriend, too
 Your face reminds me of a flower
 Kind of like you're underwater
 Hair's too long and in your eyes
 Your lips a perfect "suck me" size
 You act like you're fourteen years old
 Everything you say is so obnoxious, funny, rude and mean
 I want to be your blowjob queen
 You're probably shy and introspective
 That's not part of my objective
 I just want your fresh, young jimmy
 Jamming, slamming, ramming in me
 Everytime I see you face I think of things not pure and chaste
 I want to fuck you like a dog
 I'll take you home and make you like it
 Everything you ever wanted
 Everything you ever thought of
 Is everything I'll do to you
 I'll fuck you till your dick is blue
 Everytime


 "Beg Me"

 Take one more step and it's over
 Back up slowly inside
 Breathe too loud and I'll kill you
 Get down on your knees and beg me
 Beg me, beg
 Beg me, beg me, beg

 Take off all of your clothes
 Lie face down on the bed
 Move one inch and I'll shoot you
 Make like a woman and beg me
 Beg me, beg
 I said beg me, beg me, beg

 Every night on tv
 I see things that should make me blush
 Looks like it's gonna be another open season
 Open season on us
 Open season, open season on us
 It's the first hot day of the summer
 Looks like it's gonna be thunder
 I've been sitting here all afternoon
 Watching the clouds go by
 It seems like from my window
 I can see the wind and smell the rain
 And I don't see what difference it makes
 If I'm a man or a woman


 "Whip-Smart"

 I'm gonna tell my son to grow up pretty as the grass is green
 And whip-smart as the English Channel's wide
 And I'm gonna tell my son to keep his money in his mattress
 And his watch on any hand between his thighs
 And I'm gonna lock my son up in a tower till I write my whole
 life's story
 On the back of his big brown eyes

 When they do the double dutch, they stand tensies
 When they do the double dutch, they stand tensies

 And I'm gonna tell my son to join the circus so that death is
 cheap
 And games are just another way of life
 And I'm gonna tell my son to be a prophet of mistakes
 Because for every truth there are half a million lies
 And I'm gonna lock my son up in a tower till
 He learns his hair down far enough to climb outside

 When they do the double dutch, they stand tensies
 When they do the double dutch, they stand tensies


 "Go, Speed Racer"

 Don't give me that sucker fish shit
 Any love life ain't that hurting
 And you always seemed to get what you wanted without flirting
 You're not the only one who's used to playing dirty
 And all I ever wanted from you was to leave me alone

 So don't give me that sucker fish shit
 Cause I'm not that strong a swimmer
 But I'm not afraid to be moving in a slower river
 You're not the only one who used to watch Speed Racer
 The very first car in a race around the world
 Is somewhere in the middle of a race around the circle
 And the very first car in a race around the world
 Has got to wipeout somewhere
 Well, that somewhere isn't me

 So don't give me that sucker fish shit
 Cause I'm not getting younger
 And I'm not a floatable to keep you from going under
 You're not the only one who used to watch Speed Racer
 And the very first car in a race around the world
 Is somewhere in the middle of a race around the circle
 And the very first car in a race around the world
 Has got to wipeout somewhere
 Well, that somewhere isn't me


 "California
 aka Why I Left California or I Tried Before To Tell You."

 Okay, this guy walks into a bar
 No, I'm just fucking with you, I'm just kidding
 No, there's there's this young bull and he's standing on top of a
 hill

 And I tried to tell you before
 And that's why I left California

 So they're standing on top of this hill and they're looking out
 over a pasture full of cows
 Big fucking pasture
 And the young bull turns to the old bull, and he goes
 I got this really good idea
 And they old bulls' like yeah?

 And I tried to tell you before
 And that's why I left California

 Yeah, and he's like yeah I got this really good idea
 Let's run down that hill and fuck one of them cows
 And the old bull just looks at him, you know he's just looking at
 him
 He's like, look I got a better idea
 And the young bull is like, oh yeah?
 What's your fucking brilliant idea
 And the old bull goes

 And I tried to tell you before
 That that's why I left California

 And the old bull goes, let's walk down that hill
 And fuck all of those cows, dig?
 You know, like he ain't been in town long or something, I dunno

 And I tried to tell you before
 That that's why I left California


 "South Dakota"

 For a mean baby, well, I like your pants
 Born in South Dakota
 For a mean baby, well, I like your hips
 Born in South Dakota
 I was born in South Dakota

 Man I feel lucky tonight
 I'm gonna get stoned and run around
 Born in South Dakota
 Hey we're going to a rodeo town
 I'm gonna get drunk and fuck some cows
 Born in South Dakota

 I was  born in South Dakota
 Hey all you city fucks, it's a prarieman's world

 "Stratford-On-Guy"

 I said look...
 I was flying into Chicago at night
 Watching the lake turn the sky into blue-green smoke
 The sun was setting to the left of the plane
 And the cabin was filled with an unearthly glow
 In 27-D, I was behind the wing
 Watching the landscape roll out like credits on a screen

 And I said, look, look to your left passengers
 Look, look to your right
 You can pretend that you're from outerspace
 And this, this is your very first sight

 The earth looked like it was lit from within
 Like a big, man-made electrical ball as we moved
 Out of the farmlands and into the grid
 The plan of a city was all that you saw
 And all of these people sitting totally still
 As the ground raised beneath them, 30,000 feet down

 And I said, look, look to your left passengers
 Look, look to your right
 You can pretend that you're here from the fifth century
 And this, this is your very first flight

 And I was pretending that I was in
 A Galaxie 500 video
 The stewardess came back and checked on my drink
 And I swear that she looked just like Bridgette Bardot
 I had on my walkman and I had on those eyes
 That's what you get when your circumstance is movie-size

 And I said, look, look to you left passengers
 Look, look to your right
 You can pretend that the plane's gonna crash in five minutes
 And this, this is your very last sight
 You better look, look to your left passengers
 Look, look to your right
 Cause I'm gonna take this plane out in less than five minutes
 And this, this is your very last sight


 "Shane"

 I know that it was the night that the war broke out
 Because you and I were driving around
 You were doing a story
 About if people understood what had happened to their world
 Tonight in bed sleeping our world in bed tonight asleep
 You said that you were in touch with the draft resistors
 In case the big boys called you up
 You're gonna have to let them dick you around
 But don't let them make you do what you can't live with
 Tonight, in bed with me sleeping you looked like you were just a
 little kid
 Shane, I said, you got to watch your ass
 You gotta have fear in your heart
 You gotta have fear in your heart
 You gotta have fear in your heart
 I came here with a friend
 Who was saying to me
 You got a thing about men
 You're gonna like it when they throw you around
 But don't let them make a fool out of you
 Tonight, in bed with me sleeping the world in bed tonight asleep
 Shane, I said, you got to watch your ass
 You gotta have fear in your heart
 You gotta have fear in your heart
 You gotta have fear in your heart


 "Give Me My Boyfriend Back
 aka Willie The Six Dick Pimp"

 The six dick pimp is just doing his job
 Making sure that business isn't going under
 He's got the studs lined up in their stalls
 Put a couple of bills in, see six minutes of balls

 Justine's got a plastic baggie on her dick
 Jerry's got a couple Prince Albert's through her prick
 And nobody's in number four and number six
 Put a couple bills in, man, you really shouldn't miss it

 I don't care how much time it takes
 I don't care what kind of money he makes
 I just want my honey back
 I'll be on my way
 Gimme my boyfriend back

 Thought you were smart
 Thought I wouldn't leave home
 Rented a car, now you're halfway to Idaho
 Thought you were smart
 Thought I'd leave you alone
 But you have no idea what kind of hell is coming down on you

 I don't care how much time it takes
 I don't care what kind of money he makes
 I just want my honey back
 I'll be on my way
 You're gonna gimme my boyfriend back
 You're gonna gimme my boyfriend back

 Six dick pimp is just doing his job
 Making sure that business isn't going under
 He's got the studs lined up in their stalls
 Put a couple bills in, man, you really shouldn't miss it


 "Divorce Song"

 And when I asked for a separate  room
 It was late at night, and we'd been driving since noon
 But if I'd known how that would sound to you
 I would have stayed in your bed
 For the rest of my life just to prove I was right
 That it's harder to be friends than lovers
 And you shouldn't try to mix the two
 Cause if you do it and you're still unhappy
 Then you know that the problem is you
 And it's true that I stole your lighter
 And it's also true that I lost the map
 But when you said that I wasn't worth talking to
 Well, I'd also take your word on that
 But if you had known how that would sound to me
 You would have taken it back
 And boxed it up and buried it in the ground
 Boxed it up and buried it in the ground
 Cause you've never been a waste of my time
 It's never been a drag
 So take a deep breath and count back from ten and maybe you'll be
 alright
 You put in my hand a loaded gun
 And then told me not to fire it
 When you did the things you said were up to me
 And then accused me of trying to fuck it up
 But you've never been a waste of my time
 It's never been a drag
 So take a deep breath and count back from ten
 And maybe you'll be alright
 And the license said you had to stick around until I was dead
 But if you're tired of looking at my face I guess I already am
 I guess I already am
 But you've never been a waste of my time
 It's never been a drag
 So take a deep breath and count back from ten
 And maybe you'll be alright


 "Go West"

 Safe on the interstate
 New York is three thousand miles away
 And I'm not forward to following you
 But it's better than always running back into you
 I've got to tear my life apart
 And go west young man

 Take off the parking brake
 Go coasting into a different state
 And it feels like I got something to prove
 But in some ways it's just something to do
 I closed my eyes and my bank account and gone west young man

 And I'm not looking forward to missing you
 But I must have something better to do
 My friend turned me around and said
 You go west, young man

 Stepping down off my platform shoes
 69 in the afternoon
 And I'm waiting for someone in the know
 Like Perner tells me on the radio
 Says take it from someone who's been there before
 You go west, young man

 And I'm looking for somebody to do my thinking for me
 Till I come through
 The state-line highway signs says you have gone west, young man

 And it feel like I got something to prove
 But in some ways it's just something to do
 The state-line highway sign says you have gone west, young man


 "If I Ever Pay You Back"

 I don't know what it takes to stay with you
 Undertaking is not what I've planned
 But anyway, you know by and large anywhere I go
 I won't find anyone who loves me enough
 To make you look bad

 All the cars on the road are driving away from you
 But I'm still looking under my nose to see who I am
 But anywhere I go standing on the card I show
 I won't find anyone who'll tell me what I need to know
 That's not how it's done

 But anyway, you know by and large anywhere I go
 I won't find anyone who loves me enough
 If I ever pay you back
 If my money and wallet's intact
 I'll probably be in a box lying down loosely suited in black

 If I ever pay you back
 If my money and wallet's intact
 I'll probably be in a box lying down loosely suited in black...


 "In Love With Yourself"

 He came over my house
 Didn't even knock, he just walked inside
 And when I didn't want to talk
 He said, "Oh God, what a load of bullshit."

 Don't be so in love with yourself
 Don't be so in love with yourself
 Don't be so in love with yourself cause I'm not
 Don't you know I'm not

 And I said, "You've got a lot of nerve coming here after all the
 times
 that you tried to pull the wool over my eyes and my ears and nose
 and
 mouth and..."

 Don't be so in love with yourself
 Don't be so in love with yourself
 Don't be so in love with yourself cause I'm not
 Don't you know I'm not

 And he said, "You've got a lot of nerve painting me like I'm the
 villain.
 What about all of those words, like 'he's just a friend'? Oh God,
 what a load of bullshit..."

 Don't be so in love with yourself
 Don't be so in love with yourself
 Don't be so in love with yourself cause I'm not
 Don't you know I'm not

 And we took off all out clothes
 Had a lot of sex and then fell asleep
 And when I finally awoke
 I held him close and I whispered in his ear,
 "Don't be so in love with yourself
 Don't be so in love with yourself
 Don't be so in love with yourself cause I'm not
 Don't you know I'm not?"

 And he said, "I know, don't you think I know?"


 "Hello, Sailor"

 Hello, sailor, buy you a drink?
 Hello, sailor, tell me what do you think?
 How was the big beach, how was the sand?
 Did you fly an aeroplane?
 Did you get a tan?
 How does it feel to be back on American soil, hearing no blood
 for oil?

 Hello, sailor, tell me what do you think?
 Hello, sailor, will we get him next week?
 How does it feel to be hated and loved back home?
 You should have known
 That I'm a little despot, short and stout
 Here is my handgun, here is my crowd control
 When you tick me off then the bullets fly out
 Because free love is a whole lot of bullshit
 Free love is a whole lot of bullshit

 Hello, sailor
 Hello, sailor, buy you a smoke?
 Hello, sailor, can I tell you a joke?
 Knock knock, who's there?
 No, I'm just happy to see you
 It'll be a hundred if you come
 Hello, sailor, tell me how does it feel
 Hello, sailor, to be fighting for real?
 Sailor, they got you coming and going
 Sailor, look out cause your pussy is showing
 How does it feel to be back on American soil. hearing no blood
 for oil?

 I'm a little prostitute, I put out and sell
 Here come the market monkeys with their little fontainelles
 When they tip me over, they better tip me well
 Because free love is a whole lot of bullshit
 Free love is a whole lot of bullshit

 Hello, sailor, buy you a fuck?
 Hello, sailor, you had much more than luck
 You had the US of army on your side
 And that red, white and pride

 Hello, sailor, I mean women and men
 Hello, sailor, you gonna be up for it again?
 How does it feel to make shooting stars in the sky?
 Was it a rush to almost die?

 Hello, sailor
 I said hello, sailor
 How does it feel to be back on American soil, hearing no blood
 for oil?

 I'm a little liberal, I'm stupid in doubt
 Here is my platform, here is my holy-roller
 When you snow me under, I rock 'n' roll you out
 Because free love is a whole lot of bullshit
 Free love is a whole lot of bullshit
 Free love is a whole lot of bullshit


 "Wild Thing"

 Wild thing
 You made the boys spring
 You made everything expensive
 Spend it spend it, wild thing
 There's hardly a man left around that you haven't sought out
 There's hardly a dress shop in town you haven't bought out
 In case you're wondering why the hair salon wouldn't take you
 There's hardly a woman left in any state that doesn't hate you
 Wild thing
 You made the boys spring
 You made everything expensive
 Spend it spend it, wild thing
 It's truly awesome
 When she was younger she thought her mother had missed her
 calling
 And she, in turn, thought that her daughter's conduct was
 appalling
 After each date she had the boys, went home and dreamed of
 spiders
 She never fell for any man who wasn't rich as Midas
 Wild thing
 You made the boys spring
 You made everything expensive
 Spend it spend it, wild thing
 It's truly awesome
 If there's a lesson to be learned then I'm sure I don't know it
 We've all been waiting twenty years to finally see her blow it
 But as far as I can tell she's happy, rich, and worry free and
 That's a hell of a lot more than I can say for me and
 Wild thing
 You made the boys spring
 You made everything expensive
 Spend it spend it wild thing
 Wild thing
 You made your heart sing
 You bought everything you wanted
 Spend it spend it, wild thing
 It was truly awesome
 That's my girl!
 Go baby!


 "Fuck And Run"

 I woke up alarmed
 I didn't know where I was at first
 Just that I woke up in your arms
 And almost immediately I felt sorry
 Cause I didn't think this would happen again
 No matter what I could do or say
 Just that I didn't think this would happen again
 With or without my best intentions
 And whatever happened to a boyfriend?
 The kind of guy who tries to win you over
 And whatever happened to a boyfriend
 The kind of guy who makes love cause he's in it
 And I want a boyfriend
 I want a boyfriend
 I was all that boring old shit like letters and sodas
 Like letters
 You got up
 You said you had
 But I heard arrest in your head
 And almost immediately I felt sorry
 Cause I didn't think this would happen again
 No matter what I could do or say

 With or without my best intentions

 Letters and sodas

 And I can feel it in my bones

 Fuck and run
 Fuck and run
 Even when I was 17
 Fuck and run
 Fuck and run
 Even when I was 12

 You almost felt bad
 You said that I should call you up but
 I knew much better than that
 And almost immediately you felt sorry cause
 You didn't think this would happen again
 No matter what you could do or say
 Just that you didn't think this could happen again
 Without or without your best intentions
 And whatever happened to a girlfriend
 The kind of chick who tries to win you over

 The kind of chick who makes love cause she's in it and
 You want a girlfriend

 Letters and sodas


 "Can't Get Out Of What I'm Into"

 The things they say are getting harder to take
 But I can't get out of what I'm into
 And the jokes they tell are meant to wish me well
 But I can't get out of what I'm into
 Cause it's a steady job
 And it's the only thing that makes me money
 And it gives me something to laugh about
 Cause my real life ain't fucking funny
 Cause my real life ain't fucking funny

 The looks they give starting to make me sick
 But I can't get out of what I'm into
 And the lines they try might as well be from a guy
 But I can't get out of what I'm into
 Cause it's a steady job
 And it's the only thing that makes me money
 And it gives me something to cry about
 Cause my real life ain't fucking funny
 Cause my real life ain't fucking funny

 Ooooh Lord, why have you forsaken me?
 Ooooh Lord, why have you forsaken me?

 The things I have to do would make a slut blush blue
 But I can't get out of what I'm into
 I figure two more years then I'll go back to queers
 But I can't get out of what I'm into
 Cause it's a steady job
 And it's the only thing that makes me money
 And it gives me something to laugh about
 Cause my real life ain't fucking funny

 Ooooh Lord, why have you forsaken me?
 Ooooh Lord, why have you forsaken me?
 Ooooh Lord
 Ooooh Lord
 Ooooh Lord, why have you forsaken me?


 "Fire Up The Batmobile"

 Fire up the batmobile cause I gotta get outta here
 I don't speak the language
 And you gave me no real choice
 You gave me no real choice
 You made me see that my behavior was an opinion

 So fire up the batmobile cause I gotta get outta here
 It's the mouth of the gift horse, I know
 But I gave it my best shot
 I gave it my best shot
 I gave you the performance of a lifetime

 So I hope you all will see
 There just isn't a place here for me
 I look around and feel like somebody must be fucking with me
 I just can't take any of you seriously
 And I can't keep keeping myself company

 Fire up the batmobile cause I gotta get outta here
 Big shoulders block the view
 You can't get your money back
 You can't get your money back
 You can't pretend that "isolation" is the same as "privilege"

 So I hope you all will see
 There just isn't a place here for me
 I look around and feel like somebody must be fucking with me
 I just can't take any of you seriously
 And I can't keep keeping myself company


 "What Makes You A Slave"

 I can't remember the last time that I felt good for more than a
 week
 I mean really good for more than a month

 Makes you wanna feel
 Makes you wanna cry
 Makes you wanna tear the stars from the sky
 And you're halfway there, but you're halfway down
 And you just can't get your ass out of town
 And you can't back up cause you're against the wall
 And it's the same goddamn thing I told you
 Baby it's alright
 Sometimes a dream is what makes you a slave
 Baby it's alright

 And I think that's what's happened to me
 Cause I'm walking almost everyday blind
 And I'm searching through my past

 Makes you wanna feel
 Makes you wanna cry
 Makes you wanna tear the stars from the sky
 And you're halfway there, but you're halfway down
 And you just can't get your ass out of town
 And you can't back up cause you're against the wall
 And it's the same goddamn thing I told you
 Baby it's alright
 Sometimes a dream is what makes you a slave
 Baby it's alright

 Look around
 Do you see anyone for themselves, like you see yourself?
 So why do you still feel so all alone?

 Bubblegum, bubblegum in a dish
 Bubblegum, bubblegum in a dish
 How many pieces do you wish?
 Bubblegum, bubblegum in a dish
 How many pieces do you wish?
 My mother told me to pick the very best one
 And you're it


 "It's Not That Easy"

 I think you're trying to scare me
 So that I will stop thinking about you
 I think you're trying to scare me
 So that I will stop trying to be you
 It's not that easy
 It's not that easy

 I laughed when I heard you dies
 Cause I didn't know what else I was gonna do
 Now I laugh when I see you alive
 Cause I think you're just pulling my leg
 It's not that easy
 It's not that easy

 Well it must have taken a whole lot of anger
 And it must have taken a whole lot of time
 And I can't believe that you found me after all these years
 I guess you must have something heavy on your mind
 And I can't believe that you thought I'd be happy
 To see you up and around like it's any warning
 You look like shit, and the smell is even better
 And I feel like shit, and I want to go back to bed

 You can walk through walls
 You can make the head of a doll spin around
 And you can haunt the halls
 But you can't ask me to make you feel at home
 It's not that easy
 It's not that easy


 "Chopsticks"

 I met him at a party and he told me how to drive him home
 He said he liked to do it backwards
 And I said that's just fine with me
 That way we can fuck and watch tv
 It was 4 am and the light was gray
 Like it always is in paperbacks
 He asked if I like playing jacks
 I told him I was good till sixes
 But all hell broke loose after that
 I told him that I knew Julia Roberts when I was 12 at summer camp
 We didn't say anything after that
 I dropped him off and I drove on home
 Cause secretly, I'm timid


 "Do You Love Me?"

 The last time we made love you said my name just to make me come
 But it was just a speaking offer
 It mean nothing without your love
 Means nothing without your love
 Means nothing without your love

 I can wake up any day
 See a million things that I could say
 But then you're just an easy target
 It means nothing without your love
 Means nothing without your love
 Means nothing
 And nothing means nothing

 Each time the world turns 'round
 It doesn't make a fucking sound
 It doesn't mean that we don't feel it
 It means nothing without your love
 Means nothing without your love
 Means nothing
 And nothing means nothing

 So if you want to know if I love you so
 If you want to know if I love you so
 If you want to know if I love you so
 It's in my kiss- that's where it is
 It's in my kiss- that's where it is

 Do you love me cause I am in the mood?
 Do you love me for a funky groove?
 Do you love me cause I can mash potato?
 Do you love me cause I'm an alligator?
 Singing oooh, whoa, whoa...
 Do you love me cause I can walk on water?
 Do you love me cause I'm the President's daughter?
 Do you love me cause I am queen of England?
 Do you love me just cause I'm sitting here singing?
 Oooh, whoa, whoa...

 So if you want to know if I love you so
 If you want to know if I love you so
 If you want to know if I love you so
 It's in my kiss- that's where it is
 It's in my kiss- that's where it is

 So the next time we make love
 Drop the words, just do the stuff
 Speak softly and use that big stick
 It means nothing without your love
 Means nothing without your love
 Means nothing
 And nothing means nothing to me


 "Soap Star Joe"

 He's just a hero in a long line of heroes
 Looking for something attractive to save
 They say he rode in on the back of a pickup
 And he won't leave town till you remember his name

 He's just a hero in a long line of heroes
 Looking for some lonely billboard to grace
 They say he sprung from the skull of Athena
 Think about your own head and the headache he gave

 He's just a hero in a long line of heroes
 Looking for action in a price he can pay
 They say he's famous, but no one can prove it
 Make him an offer just to see what he'll say

 Check out the dashboard lights
 Glowing all green and white
 He feels safe in the dark
 He wears his bluejeans tight

 Check out the thinning hair
 Check out the aftershave
 Check out America
 You're looking at it, babe

 He's just a hero in a long line of heroes
 Looking for something attractive to save
 They say he rode in on the back of a pickup
 And he won't leave town till you remember his name
 Make him an offer just to see what he'll say


 "I Know It's Not Easy"

 Call me when you think the coast is clear
 I've been hiding out almost a year
 Is there something wrong?
 What's taking you so long?
 And yeah, I know it's not easy

 You said if I waited it'd pay off
 But my eyes are growing wild and my body's gone soft
 Is there something wrong?
 What's taking you so long?
 And yeah, I know it's not easy

 You said I should let go of your hand
 But I don't even know if I can
 You're the only one
 You are the very sun to me
 And you know it's not easy

 You'd tell me, wouldn't you, if we needed to talk?
 And you'd tell me, wouldn't you, if I had pissed you off?
 Is there something wrong?
 What's taking you so long?
 And yeah, I know it's not easy

 Well I look at the stars and I know you're under them
 I look at the cars and I know you insure them
 I look at the books and things people are reading
 I know that you've written them, too
 But then I look at my life and I know you've forgotten the
 promise you made to me
 I think that's rotten
 I'm hopelessly lost and there's hardly a sound anymore
 Coming through that can show me around
 Cause I'm endlessly, endlessly searching the crowd
 Looking for something from you
 Just one fucking measly clue
 Any shitty little tip-off would do
 But I'm just an ant in Alaska to you

 Well I look at the stars and I know you're under them
 I look at the cars and I know you insure them
 I look at the books and the things people are reading
 I know that you've written them, too
 But then I look at my life and I know you've forgotten the
 promise you made to me
 I think that's rotten
 I'm hopelessly lost and there's hardly a sound anymore
 Coming through that can show me around
 Cause I'm endlessly, endlessly searching the crowd
 Looking for something from you
 Just one fucking measly clue
 Any shitty little tip-off would do
 But I'm just and ant in Alaska to you
 I'm just an ant in Alaska
 An ant in Alaska
 An ant in Alaska to you


 "Miss Lucy"

 Miss Lucy had a steamboat
 Miss Lucy had a steamboat
 Miss Lucy had a steamboat
 The steamboat had a bell
 Miss Lucy went to heaven
 And her steamboat went to hell

 ?
 Can't know my number
 And don't disconnect me
 I'll cut off the cord

 My refrigerator, there was a piece of glass
 Miss Lucy fell upon it
 And she cut off the last piece of ?
 ?
 The boys in the parlor
 ?
 I'm in the meadows
 The birds in their pockets

 And the boys and the girls, they are fucking
 And the girls and the girls, they are fucking
 And the girls and the boys, they are fucking


 "Dead Shark"

 Don't be so rude
 I was only trying to make conversation
 Hey don't go down, this is not going anywhere
 Got a dead shark on our hands
 Got a dead shark on our hands
 Got a dead shark on our hands

 I'm just trying to get a handle on this
 I'm just trying to be rubber stamped
 I'm just trying
 So sue me for trying

 Do I just have problems, or did you also think that this was hot?

 I really hate talking on the telephone
 Can't we just work it out
 That you come on over here
 Can't we just work it out
 That you stay here tonight
 I'm not looking over my shoulder
 I'm not gazing up at the stars
 I'm not thinking about painting a picture
 I'm just wondering where you'll sleep tonight

 Do I just have problems, or did you also think that this was hot?

 I'm not looking over my shoulder
 I'm not gazing up at the stars
 I'm not thinking about painting your picture
 I'm just wondering where you'll spend the night


 "One Less Thing"

 I took my dog to the vet today
 He gave her a shot and put her away
 And when I got home and got ready for be I realized what I'd done
 And that's one less thing on my mind

 I left the man I'm in love with behind
 I moved to Chicago and told him I'd write
 But now when I wake and I see the wrong face I realize what I've
 done
 And that's one less thing on my mind

 Did you think that I knew what I was doing when I said that I had
 to grow up on my own for a while?
 Now I'm dog-less and love-less and cold in a midwestern winter
 If I'd known what I was doing I sure as fuck wouldn't be here
 Now I like to think that I like to learn from mistakes
 But I've made that error in judgment one too many times
 And I'm not the wiser and sure not the wealthier
 I wish to God that I had've been healthier mentally
 When I decided to make up my own mind
 But that's one less thing takes up my time

 I'm lining up six or seven good jobs
 My hair's looking great and my friends are all snobs
 But I don't have my man and I don't have my dog
 And I don't have very much fun
 And that's one less thing on my mind


 "Money"

 Elvis's car is probably 30 years old
 He looks like a Saab in '45
 Cliff says he's got a headache
 Looks like shit and it feels like America
 Looks like shit and it feels like America

 Take them people back inside
 Just can't thin of something else to take over
 But you just stand it up and warning
 Looks like shit and it feels like America
 Looks like shit and it feels like America

 Why fly when you can walk?
 Why sing when you can talk?
 Why hit the wall when you've just punched the clock?
 Oh why sing when you can talk?

 Jeremy's talking about the bombs
 He thinks it's probably a bad place to be
 It's gonna be worse than Manhattan
 Looks like shit and it feels like America
 Looks like shit and it feels like America

 Take the train on up to the zoo
 Don't look back on what you've been through
 Cause everyone's got a Monday
 Looks like shit and it feels like America
 Looks like shit and it feels like America

 It's nice to be liked, but it's better by far to get paid
 I know that most of the friends that I have don't really see it
 that way
 But if you could give 'em each one wish
 They'd wish success for themselves and their friends
 And that would include lots of money
 That would surely include lots of money

 So if there are any on you little green elves sitting out there
 today
 Step right up, wish me old Irish luck
 But I also need shitloads of money
 And if there are any of you dirty rich old men sitting out there
 today
 Step right up, I'm your lucky fuck
 But I'm gonna need shitloads of money
 I'm gonna need shitloads of money
 I got to have shitloads of money


 "Sweetest Perfection"
 by Depeche Mode

 The sweetest perfection
 To call my own
 The slightest correction
 Couldn't finely hone
 The sweetest infection
 Of body and mind
 Sweetest injection
 Of any kind

 I stop and I stare too much
 Afraid that I care too much
 And I hardly dare to touch
 For fear that the spell may be broken
 When I need a drug in me
 And it brings out the thug in me
 Feel something tugging me
 Then I want the real thing not tokens

 Things you'd expect to be
 Having effect on me
 Pass undetectedly
 But everyone knows what has got me
 Takes me completely
 Touches me sweetly
 Reaches so deeply
 I know that nothing can stop me

 Sweetest perfection
 An offer was made
 An assorted collection
 But I wouldn't trade

 Takes me completely
 Touches so sweetly
 Reaches so deeply
 Nothing can stop me


 "Yeah O Yeah"
 by Spiderbait

 Yeah o yeah
 I really wanna curl my hair
 I thought I had a lot to say
 But I think I wanna waste away

 Don't pretend
 You all wanna have a new friend
 You're okay
 But you always get your own way

 Hear you say
 I really wanna say what I'm thinking
 See them play
 But I never heard a word they say
 I never heard a word they say
 I never heard a word they say
 I never heard a word they say
 
 Hey okay
 I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it
 Yeah
 O yeah
 O yeah

 Yeah o yeah
 Yeah o yeah
 Yeah o yeah
 

 "How I Miss You"
 by Foo Fighters

 How I miss you
 How I miss you
 How I miss you
 I should not recall
 How I hope that you still miss me

 Did I lose you
 Did I lose you
 Did I lose you
 Somewhere down the line
 Hide and seek's alright if I find

 Do you miss me
 Like I miss you
 If you miss me
 Never go away
 Hopefully you'll come and stay someday

 If you're leaving
 Come back soon
 That's not easy to say

 I will wait here
 Dream of you
 All alone as I await

 Did I lose you
 Did I lose you
 Did I lose you
 Somewhere down the line
 Hide and seek's alright if I find

 Do you miss me
 Like I miss you
 If you miss me
 Never go away
 Hopefully you'll come and stay someday

 If you're leaving 
 Come back soon
 That's not easy to say

 I will wait here
 Dream of you
 All alone as I await

 How I miss you
 How I miss you 
 How I miss you
 I should not recall
 How I hope that you still miss me 


 "The Funny Bird"
 by Mercury Rev

 well goodbye southern spy
 i've come to love you in the light
 always staring at the void
 have your eyes all been destroyed
 all these digging little hands
 of all the stones that never land
 you're the only one i know..
 
 and farewell golden ring
 oh you hollow little thing
 like a wave along the coast
 i've come to love the highs and lows
 when in the end you're just a band
 a funny bird that never lands
 and you're the only one i know...
 
 farewell golden sound
 no one wants to hear you now
 and of all the happy ends
 i wouldnt wish this on a friend
 but you're the only one i know..


 "Borderline"
 by Madonna

 Something in the way you love me wont' let me be 
 I don't want to be your prisoner, so baby, won't you set me free 
 Stop playing with my heart 
 Finish what you start 
 When you make my love come down 
 If you want me, let me know 
 Baby, let it show 
 Honey, don't you fool around 

 Just try to understand, I've given all I can
 'Cause you got the best of me 

 Chorus:
 Borderline, feels like I'm going to lose my mind 
 You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline 

 (repeat chorus)

 Keep on pushing me, baby
 Don't you know you drive me crazy 
 You just keep on pushing my love 
 Over the borderline 

 Something in your eyes is makin' such a fool of me
 When you hold me in your arms, you love me 'til I just can't see 
 But then you let me down, when I look around 
 Baby, you just can't be found 
 Stop driving me away, I just wanna stay 
 There's something I just got to say 

 Just try to understand, I've given all I can
 'Cause you got the best of me 

 Chorus

 Keep on pushing me baby
 Don't you know you drive me crazy 
 You just keep on pushing my love 
 Over the borderline 

 Look what your love has done to me
 Come on baby, set me free 
 You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline 

 You cause me so much pain, I think I'm going insane
 What does it take to make you see 
 You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline


 "Tiger Woods"
 by Dan Bern

 i got big balls
 big ole balls
 big as grapefruits
 big as pumpkins
 yes sir yes sir
 and on my really good days
 they swell to the size of small dogs
 my balls are as big as small dogs
 well it ain't braggin' if it's true
 yes sir yes sir
 it ain't braggin' if it's true
 mohammed ali said that
 back when he was a young man
 back when he was cassius clay
 before he fought too many fights
 and left his brain inside the ring
 
 sometimes i wish i was tiger woods
 tiger woods tiger woods
 sometimes i wish i was tiger woods
 tiger woods tiger woods
 
 i got a friend whose goal in life
 was to one day go down on madonna
 that's all he wanted
 that was all
 to one day go down on madonna
 and when my friend was 34
 he got his wish in rome one night
 he got to go down on madonna
 in rome one night in some hotel
 and ever since he's been depressed
 'cause life is shit from here on in
 and all our friends just shake their heads
 and say 'too soon too soon too soon'
 he went down on madonna too soon
 too young too young too soon too soon
 and it ain't braggin' if it's true
 yes sir yes sir
 it ain't braggin' if it's true
 mohammed ali said that
 back when he was casius clay
 before he fought too many fights
 and left his brain inside the ring
 sometimes i wish i was tiger woods tiger woods
 sometimes i wish i was tiger woods tiger woods
 
 if certain girls don't look at you
 it means that they like you a lot
 if other girls don't look at you
 it just means they're ignoring you
 how can you know, how can you know?
 which is which, who's doing what?
 i guess that you can ask 'em
 which one are you baby?
 i guess that's all you have to do
 do you like me or are you ignoring me?
 do you like me or are you ignoring me?
 and all you need to do that
 is one good pair of big balls
 balls as big as grapefruits
 balls as big as pumpkins
 balls as big as mine
 but even though my balls are big
 sometimes i wish they were bigger
 even bigger
 big as the wheels on tractors
 big as the golden arches
 big as the golden gate bridge
 big as mars and jupiter
 big as the swing of tiger woods
 tiger woods
 tiger woods


 "Crazy Train"
 by Ozzy Osbourne

 Crazy,but that's how it goes
 Millions of people living as foOLS
 Maybe it's not too late
 To learn how to love
 And forget how to hate
 Mental wounds not healing
 Life's a bitter shame
 I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
 I've listened to preachers
 I've listened to fools
 I've watched all the dropouts
 Who make their own rules
 One person conditioned to rule and control
 The media sells it and you live the role
 Mental wounds still screaming
 Driving me insane
 I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
 I know that things are going wrong for me
 You gotta listen to my words
 Yeh-h
 Heirs of a cold war
 That's what we've become
 Inheriting troubles I'm mentally numb
 Crazy, I just cannot bear
 I'm living with something that just isn't fair
 Mental wounds not healing
 Who and what's to blame
 I'm going off the rails on a crazy train


 "Closer To The Heart"
 by Rush

 And the men who hold high places
 Must be the ones who start
 To mold a new reality
 Closer to the heart
 Closer to the heart
 The blacksmith and the artist
 Reflect it in their art
 They forge their creativity
 Closer to the heart
 Closer to the heart
 
 Philosophers and ploughmen
 Each must know his part
 To sow a new mentality
 Closer to the heart
 Closer to the heart
 You can be the captain
 I will draw the chart
 Sailing into destiny
 Closer to the heart
 

 "That Day"
 by Poe

 Tomorrow's coming 'round a hairpin curve in the road
 She's got a run in her stocking and she's missing the heel of her shoe
 Got up this morning rolled out of bed
 I spilled a diet coke called my mother said "hi"
 What I meant to say was "Why is your life a joke?"
 Then I went down to that ugly bar and I clicked by heels 3 times just like
     you said and I climbed the road to your empty house
 The anticipation was a turn on
 But you let me down
 'cause I stood on that empty stoop alone
 I said "I'm ready for my close up now Mr. Demille"
 I waited for the light but it never shone
 Well I wonder what you'll do with that expensive piece of land
 That over looks a billion years of history
 I have a sneaking suspicion you will never understand
 Hey maybe I'll see you down by the Rocky & Bullwinkle
 And we can talk to that Charlatan Psychic
 And she can paint a prettier picture of your future

 'Cause that day
 In my life
 That day
 In my life

 I dreamt tomorrow had a prettier face
 And, I dreamt tomorrow would have better things to say than,
 "you look like shit, what's your problem bitch
 your legs feel like sandpaper you can't do anything right"
 Well that day
 Never should have taken place
 'Cause this day in my life still cannot
 Explain
 Why I listened in the first place
 To you

 Oh Ya... Something else

 I hope one day you call up your father
 And have the guts to tell him how he hurt you
 And made you hurt another
 'Cause it makes me sad


 "God's Mistake"
 by Tears For Fears

 have a friend, calls me up
 says hello .. then hangs up
 he must've read my mind
 these are the days of a different paradigm
 maybe once, or even twice
 you said "God does not play dice"
 yet if he's everywhere
 he's in casinos with aces to spare
 ours is not to reason why
 as we fall from way up high
 into the water
 like a lamb to the slaughter
 even now, God's mistake
 sets us up for one more heartbreak
 God you look mighty fine
 dressed as the devil in a cosmic pantomime


 "Help!"
 by The Beatles

 Help, I need somebody,
 Help, not just anybody,
 Help, you know I need someone, help.

 When I was younger, so much younger than today,
 I never needed anybody's help in any way.
 But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured,
 Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors.

 Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
 And I do appreciate you being round.
 Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
 Won't you please, please help me.

 And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
 My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
 But every now and then I feel so insecure,
 I know that I just need you like I've never done before.

 Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
 And I do appreciate you being round.
 Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
 Won't you please, please help me.

 When I was younger, so much younger than today,
 I never needed anybody's help in any way.
 But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured,
 Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors.
 Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
 And I do appreciate you being round.
 Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
 Won't you please, please help me, help me, help me, oh.


 "Holland, 1945"
 by Neutral Milk Hotel

 The only girl I've ever loved
 Was born with roses in her eyes
 But then they buried her alive
 One evening 1945
 With just her sister at her side
 And only weeks before the guns
 All came and rained on everyone
 Now she's a little boy in Spain
 Playing pianos filled with flames
 On empty rings around the sun
 All sing to say my dream has come

 But now we must pick up every piece
 Of the life we used to love
 Just to keep ourselves
 At least enough to carry on
 
 And now we ride the circus wheel
 With your dark brother wrapped in white
 Says it was good to be alive
 But now he rides a comet's flame
 And won't be coming back again
 The Earth looks better from a star
 That's right above from where you are
 He didn't mean to make you cry
 With sparks that ring and bullets fly
 On empty rings around your heart
 The world just screams and falls apart

 But now we must pick up every piece
 Of the life we used to love
 Just to keep ourselves
 At least enough to carry on
 
 And here's where your mother sleeps
 And here is the room where your brothers were born
 Indentions in the sheets
 Where their bodies once moved but don't move anymore
 And it's so sad to see the world agree
 That they'd rather see their faces fill with flies
 All when I'd want to keep white roses in their eyes


 "Ooga Booga"
 by Spiderbait

 They know
 On the top of my head
 And they know
 Just the way that I go

 And they know
 Now my feeling is slow
 And they know
 Now I got my feeling

 Don't you want my feeling?
 Don't you want my feeling?
 Now I know
 There's a place for my gun
 And I am sure
 You and me all alone
 And let's-a-go

 To a place that I know
 And I might stay on
 Stay gone
 Come on and let me go home
 Won't you let me go home
 Take my bad gone feeling!
 
 Take my bad gone feeling
 
 Take my bad gone feeling
 

 "Never Is A Promise"
 by Fiona Apple

 You'll never see the courage I know
 Its colors' richness won't appear within your view
 I'll never glow - the way that you glow
 Your presence dominates the judgements made on you
 But as the scenery grows, I see in different lights
 The shades and shadows undulate in my perception
 My feelings swell and stretch; I see from greater heights
 I understand what I am still too proud to mention - to you

 You'll say you understand, but
 You don't understand
 You'll say you'd never give up seeing eye to eye
 But never is a promise, and you can't afford to lie

 You'll never touch - these things that I hold
 The skin of my emotions lies beneath my own
 You'll never feel the heat of this soul
 My fever burns me deeper than I've ever shown - to you

 You'll say, Don't fear your dreams, it's easier than it seems
 You'll say you'd never let me fall from hopes so high
 But never is a promise and you can't afford to lie

 You'll never live the life that I live
 I'll never live the life that wakes me in the night
 You'll never hear the message I give
 You'll say it links as though I might give up this fight
 But as the scenery grows, I see in different lights
 The shades and shadows undulate in my perception
 My feelings swell and stretch, I see from greater heights
 I realize what I am now too smart to mention - to you

 You'll say you understand, you'll never understand
 I'll say I'll never wake up knowing how or why
 I don't know what to believe in, you don't know who I am
 You'll say I need appeasing when I start to cry
 But never is a promise and I'll never need a lie


 "The Wanderer"
 by U2

 I went out walking
 Through streets paved with gold
 Lifted some stones, saw the skin and bones
 Of a city without a soul
 I went out walking
 Under an atomic sky
 Where the ground won't turn, and the rain it burns
 Like the tears when I said goodbye
 Yeah I went with nothing
 Nothing but the thought of you
 I went wandering...
 
 I went drifting
 Through the capitals of tin
 Where men can't walk, or freely talk
 And sons turn their fathers in
 I stopped inside a church house
 Where the citizens like to sit
 They say they want the kingdom
 But they don't want God in it
 I went out riding
 Down that old eight lane
 I passed by a thousand signs
 Looking for my own name
 I went with nothing
 But the thought you'd be there too
 Looking for you...
 
 I went out there
 In search of experience
 To taste and to touch, and to feel as much
 As a man can before he repents
 I went out searching
 Looking for one good man
 A spirit who would not bend or break
 Who would sit at his father's right hand
 I went out walking
 With a bible and a gun
 The word of God lay heavy on my heart
 I was sure I was the one
 Now Jesus, don't you wait up
 Jesus, I'll be home soon
 Yeah I went out for the papers
 Told her I'd be back by noon
 Yeah I left with nothing
 But the thought you'd be there too
 Looking for you
 Yeah I left with nothing
 Nothing but the thought of you
 I went wandering...


 "Life in a Northern Town"
 by Dream Academy

 A Salvation Army band played
 And the children drank lemonade
 And the morning lasted all day,
 All day
 And through an open window came
 Like Sinatra in a younger day,
 Pushing the town away
 Ah--
 (Chant)
 Ah hey ma ma ma
 Life in a northern Town.
 They sat on the stoney ground
 And he took a cigarette out
 And everyone else came down
 To listen.
 He said in "in winter 1963
 It felt like the world would freeze
 With John F. Kennedy
 And The Beatles."
 (Chant)
 Ah hey ma ma ma
 Life in a northern Town.
 Ah hey ma ma ma
 All the work shut down.
 The evening had turned to rain
 Watch the water roll down the drain,
 As we follow him down
 To the station
 And though he never would wave goodbye,
 You could see it written in his eyes
 As the train rolled out of sight
 Bye-bye.
 (Chant)
 Ah hey ma ma ma
 Life in a northern town.
 Ah hey ma ma ma
 Life in a northern town


 "Kung Fu"
 by Ash

 Kung Fu do what you do to me
 I haven't been the same since my teenage lobotomy
 Full on, I moved to Hong Kong
 With Bruce Lee's brother and Johnny Wong

 I think it's strange
 He's friends with Fu Manchu
 And he thinks he knows you
 Uh uh uh uh uh oh
 Oh Daniel San made in Taiwan
 Come on Jackie Chan
 Uh uh uh uh uh oh

 Last night Jackie Chan came around
 I played pool with him and we hung out
 Mr. Miagi and the X-men
 Called in for a while as well

 I think it's strange
 He's friends with Fu Manchu
 And he thinks he knows you
 Uh uh uh uh uh oh
 Oh Daniel San made in Taiwan
 Come on Jackie Chan
 Uh uh uh uh uh oh

 Kung Fu do what you do to me
 I can't live without my Kung Fu movies
 'Shanghai Killers' and 'Deadly Road'
 My life was ruined when the Green Dragon closed

 Oh I think it's strange
 He's friends with Fu Manchu
 And he thinks he knows you
 Uh uh uh uh uh oh
 Oh Daniel San made in Taiwan
 Come on Jackie Chan
 Uh uh uh uh uh oh

 I think it's strange
 He's friends with Fu Manchu
 And he's in love with you
 Uh uh uh uh uh oh Oh Daniel San made in Taiwan
 Come on Jackie Chan
 Uh uh uh uh uh oh


 "High 5 (Rock The Catskills)"
 by Beck

 High 5, high 5
 High 5, high 5

 "C'mon on, 8, everybody, c'mon, 7, c'mon, now, 6, 5
 Aw, yeah, I like that shit"

 When I rock it's like a high 5
 Want a slap in the face I love the taste
 All my days with my wheelchair ways
 Watch me die in my suicide high
 I don't mean it 'cause I only come on to you
 When I step to the room with a powerful motion
 Leopard skin let the records spin
 'Round and round with the speed of sound
 
 High 5, more dead than alive
 Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills
 High 5, more dead than alive
 Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills

 Rocky mountain low we gotta go
 Put that gadget in the random mode
 Cripple candy rocking the candy
 Rhumba, brickshot, doing the foxtrot
 In my car sweating like a dog
 Beers and chairs no frontiers
 On my way from the 'Frisco Bay
 Dixieland, soda-pop man

 High 5, more dead than alive
 Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills
 High 5, more dead than alive
 Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills

 Yeah, put that machine in random mode
 Talking about popping jugger
 Like the last century
 
 "Turn that shit off, man, what's wrong with you?
 Man, get the other record, damn"
 
 High 5, more dead than alive
 Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills
 High 5, more dead than alive
 Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills
 High 5, more dead than alive
 Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills
 High 5, more dead than alive
 Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills

 "Ok, now, do like designer jeans
 Everybody, designer jeans, say, say, say, say, say: ooh, la la, sasoon
 C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
 Everybody
 One more time, let me hear you say: ooh, la la, sasoon
 Just do it everybody, c'mon
 Now I want the ladies
 All the ladies, say: Sergio Valente, sing it, girl
 Let me hear you say: Sergio Valente
 Say Jordache"

 It doesnt scare me at all

 An-bithelafter-mer

 And play a joyous tune and

 But this is enlightenment

 The less room you give me
 The more space I've got
 It doesnt scare me at all

 Free the A-human race
 From suffering

 by Ol' Dirty Bastard

 You can't imitate me on this fuckin tape
 You ain't ringing the bell I'm ready when you are
 
 [You ain't ringing the bell
 You ain't busting the grape
 You ain't imitating me on this fuckin tape] (x10)

 I'm tellin you bitch ass niggas

 "Crazy For You"
 by Madonna

 Swaying room as the music starts 
 Strangers making the most of the dark 
 Two by two their bodies become one 
 I see you through the smoky air 
 Can't you feel the weight of my stare 
 You're so close but still a world away 
 What I'm dying to say is that 

 I'm crazy for you
 Touch me once and you'll know it's true 
 I never wanted anyone like this 
 It's all brand new you'll feel it in my kiss 
 I'm crazy for you crazy for you 

 Trying hard to control my heart
 I walk over to where you are 
 Eye to eye we meet no word at all 
 Slowly now we begin to move 
 Every breath I'm deeper into you 
 Send me to a standing still in time 
 If you read my mind you'll see 

 I'm crazy for you
 Touch me once and you'll know it's true 
 I never wanted anyone like this 
 It's all brand new you'll feel it in my kiss 
 You'll feel it in my kiss because 

 I'm crazy for you
 Touch me once and you'll know it's true 
 I never wanted anyone like this 
 It's all brand new you'll feel it in my kiss 
 I'm crazy for you 

 Crazy for you
 It's all brand new I'm crazy for you 
 And you know it's true 
 I'm crazy crazy for you 
 It's all brand new I'm crazy for you 
 And you know it's true 
 I'm crazy crazy for you 


 "The Golden Calf"
 by Prefab Sprout

 once upon a time i stalked the streets on raining evenings
 when the distant sea blended with the sky
 past coliseums filled with brass on pavements carved with toasted glass
 i carried in my heart a word or two

 your dashing horseman all gone away
 left you the stable bill to pay
 and now the golden calf has turned to clay
 all my feelings dressed in gloves
 couldn't touch your windswept harbour love
 white and open-necked you would still play

 i'd resort to sleepwalking to catch the mood that fills the sails
 with harvest nets and tides don't ever bring
 but every night was halloween, and every friend fell in between
 and how capricious nature ruled my mind

 your dashing horseman all gone away
 left you the stable bill to pay
 and now the golden calf has turned to clay
 all my feelings dressed in gloves
 couldn't touch your windswept harbour love
 white and open-necked you would still play
 
 Once upon a time i stalked the streets on raining evenings
 when the distant sea blended with the sky
 my mouth was full of cigarettes, my head was full of long term bets
 but you would always make me see today

 i sound so different these days, i barely can believe i'm me
 if i didn't know better, I would swear I was someone else
 Lord I can't believe, I don't believe I'm me
 But who on earth could I be?

 your dashing horseman all gone away
 left you the stable bill to pay
 and now the golden calf has turned to clay
 all my feelings dressed in gloves
 couldn't touch your windswept harbour love
 white and open-necked you would still play


 "I Won't Forget You"
 by Poison

 Late at night I close my eyes
 And think of how things could have been
 And when I look back
 I remember some words you had said to me

 It's better to have lost at love
 Then never to have loved at all

 Chorus
 I won't forget you baby
 (I won't forget you)
 Even though I should
 I won't forget you baby
 (I won't forget you)
 Even though I should, yeah

 Sometimes in my head
 I can still see pictures of you
 And I laugh to myself
 When I think of all those crazy things that we used to do

 Although miles come between us
 Just between you and me

 Chorus

 I should let you fade away
 But that just wouldn't be me
 Oh, baby

 Solo

 Although miles come between us
 Just between you and me

 I won't forget you baby
 (I won't forget you)
 Memories slowly fade
 I won't forget you baby
 (I won't forget you)
 And all the plans we made

 I won't forget you baby


 "Bugs"
 by Pearl Jam

 I got bugs
 I got bugs in my room
 Bugs in my bed
 Bugs in my ears
 Their eggs in my head
 Bugs in my pockets
 Bugs in my shoes
 Bugs in the way I feel about you

 Bugs on my window
 Trying to get in
 They don't go nowhere
 Waiting, waiting...
 Bugs on my ceiling
 Crowded the floor
 Standing, sitting, kneeling...
 A few block the door

 And now the questions:
 Do I kill them?
 Become their friend?
 Do I eat them?
 Raw or well done?
 Do I trick them?
 I don't think they're dumb
 Do I join them?
 Looks like that's the one

 I got bugs on my skin
 Tickle my nauseau
 I let it happen again
 They're always takin' over
 I see they surround me,
 I see... See them deciding my fate
 Oh, that which was once...was once up to me...
 Now it's too late

 I got bugs in my room...one on one
 That's when I had a chance I'll just stop now
 I'll become naked
 And let the...all become one


 "No Direction"
 by Bad Religion

 A sullen figure walks along a dusty road
 his life was holy and he couldn't bear the load
 he left his people and a simple life behind
 he raised his torso and he looked into the sky
 shouting his questions
 looking for directions
 "what do I do now?"
 now a confused school girl stares at the TV tray
 the stresses of maturing compound every day
 she glances up to see her favorite video
 and gets ideas from Madonna's nasty clothes
 in need of affection
 she craves affection
 her heroes offer her
 everyone is looking for something
 and they assume somebody else knows what it is
 no one can live with the decisions of their own it seems
 so they look to someone else
 to tell 'em what to be
 tell 'em what to wear
 tell 'em what to say
 tell 'em how to act and think and compel others compulsively
 until the world is all like them
 a righteous student came and asked me to reflect
 he judged my lifestyle ws politically incorrect
 I don't belive in self important folks who preach
 no Bad Religion song can make your life complete
 you'll get no direction from me
 you'll get no direction from me
 

 "Untitled"
 by Spiderbait

 "There are many fixed traditional compositions
 that have been handed down
 from teacher to student and then from his student
 to his student over the
 past many hundred years of tupta(?? some Indian word..)
 tradition. And these fixed compositions have special names like
 cut(?), barrun(?), toora(?), dehine(?), chucarta), bechucarta(?) and
 there are many types of cuts(?) and barruns(?) that are first recited
 or sung to give their beauty and then they are played on the tabla.

 "I should have brought my (something) so I could turn
 it off!" BANG!


 "Run to the Hills"
 by Iron Maiden

 White man came across the sea
 Brought us pain and misery
 Killed our tribes killed our creed
 Took our game for his own need

 We fought him hard we fought him well
 Out on the plains we gave him hell
 But many came too much for Cree
 Oh will we ever be set free?

 Riding through dustclouds and barren wastes
 Galloping hard on the plains
 Chasing the redskins back to their holes
 Fighting them at their own game
 Murder for freedom a stab in the back
 Women and children and cowards attack

 Run to the hills run for your lives
 Run to the hills run for your lives

 Soldier blue on the barren wastes
 Hunting and killing their game
 Raping the women and wasting the men
 The only good Indians are tame
 Selling them whisky and taking their gold
 Enslaving the young and destroying the old

 Run to the hills run for your lives
 (repeat to end)


 "Down in the Bottom"
 by Walter Becker

 in case you're wondering it's alive and well
 that little habit that you left with me
 here in the suburbs where it's hard to tell
 if i got the bear or the bear got me

 how did you know that it would take me down
 down to the bottom of the wine dark sea
 where you were waiting there to bring me 'round
 where you knew all the dopest cuts to be

 drowned at the bottom of your mystery
 down in the bottom of the wine dark sea
 
 saw your old lady in the park today
 the legendary smile is wearing thin
 behind that guessing game you make her play
 now that she knows that she could never win

 i guess you're never gonna take her down
 down to the bottom of your little black heart
 lay with her naked on the cool hard ground
 to watch the sun rise in the dopest part

 down in the bottom where your lifeline shows
 down in the bottom where nobody goes
 
 did you lose your way, find another?
 did you make your play or just run for cover?
 is it safe to say you got burned today?
 
 i like the feathers and i love the hat
 i like that little gypsy tune you're humming
 i guess i'm happy now we've had this chat
 oh yeah i'm really glad i saw you coming

 there in the corner of the eastern sky
 the tortured angel of your rising sign
 darkens the evening with his one good eye
 an evil omen of the dopest kind

 down in the bottom where your demons fly
 down in the bottom of the eastern sky
 down in the bottom where your lifeline shows
 down in the bottom where nobody goes
 drowned in the bottom of your mystery
 down in the bottom of the wine dark sea


 Album: When Dream and Day Unite
 by Dream Theater


 "A Fortune In Lies"

    I can remember when,
    In the unity of our five-day sessions
    Not even once did we hear the siren song
    What kind of imagination
    Asleep in some lyrical coma
    Who's vain futile memory
    Could have been so wrong?

       You can make a fortune in lies
       You can keep a giant alive
       You can ride the red
       Until everybody smiles

    A trifling euphoria
    was such an untimely religion
    maybe your life can explain
    the reason for my indecision
    Here is a poor man
    the heart of this monster creation
    He said we both will be heroes
    and I was led into temptation

       You can make a fortune in lies
       You can keep a giant alive
       You can ride the red
       Until everybody smiles

    Can you show me your gold
    and your silver?
    A hero in frozen water

   "For the first time in a long time...
    everything was right in my world...   [Sample from a television prison  ]
    and then I woke up..."                [documentary.                     ]
    
       Now you've made a fortune in lies
       and you kept a giant alive
       You rode the red
       You rode the red

  
 "Status Seeker"

    Heart sick at the sight of the
    Status Seeker
    In a sense I'm not beyond reproach
    the aspiration to drop a name
    When any rose might smell the same
    Maybe you'll figure it out someday
    'I want to know you now...
    You know I've always believed in you.'

    Nothing is sacred...
       You draw the bottom line
       with a dollar sign
    Change of opinion...
       At the drop of a dime
    Graceless intrusion...
       Are you sanctified in your judgment of me?
       All that I deserve is what you were unable to see

    In a garden where the seeds were spilled
    I favored the few that stood strong in the sun
    As I reached for the profit of my prize
    I found I had trampled the forgotten ones.

    Nothing is sacred...
       You draw the bottom line
       with a dollar sign
    Change of opinion...
       At the drop of a dime
    Graceless intrusion...
       Are you sanctified in your judgment of me?
       All that I deserve is what you were unable to see

    You're running in circles
    And I'm turning away
    You refused to believe
    Now I'm turning away

    Nothing is sacred...
       You draw the bottom line
       with a dollar sign
    Change of opinion...
       At the drop of a dime
    Graceless intrusion...
       Are you sanctified in your judgment of me?
       All that I deserve is what you were unable to see

    You're running in circles
    And I'm turning away
    You refused to believe
    Now I'm turning away

  
 "The Killing Hand"

    I.  The Observance
    An Angel's kiss now fallen
    Descending scarlet cuts the sky
    Faded names left on the wall
    Honor the fighting leave life to die
    Remembered is the sacrifice but
    No praisal of blood still flowing
    Who were the leaders?
    what controlled the Killing Hand
    that caused this mourning?
           Crossing over...

    II.  Ancient Renewal
    Lowered deep into the sea
    Being awaits to cleanse his soul
    senses weakening time is still
    Motionless by stiffening cold

    The wheels race back and
    Scorch his mind
    Traveling all to find the land
    Revelation warms a touch
    And now, he will begin to
    Understand

    III.  The Stray Seed
    Extended a view to yesterday
    Manifestation for none the same
    Walking amidst a frightening still
    No sound, no smoke, no scorching
    Flames
           He is risen...

    Sipping his poison the raven sings
    Yet another to add more bodies fallen
    King from below
    this one controls
    the Killing Hand that caused this mourning.
           Is it all over?
           Is it all over?

    IV.  Thorns
    Evil genius this secret plan
    Mercy dealt with the losing hand
    Will he ever fall?
    Can he end it all?
    Our savior must make his stand.

    Only a Prophet of years to come
    Wanting mortality I'm all alone
    He heard my voice
    It was my choice
    I've stopped the Killing Hand.

    V.  Exodus
    When I go back again
    Will it be the same?
    I've stopped the cries
    But now they know my name

    The sea is calling me
    my spirit must return
    As I get closer,
    was it really worth
    what I have learned?

    I'm in the valley
    And the saddened chimes I hear
    Race toward the wall to find
    one more name appears.

    No one is left now
    my one and only land
    I laugh at what I've done
    I am the Killing Hand.

  
 "Light Fuse and Get Away"

       Would you like to sit and talk to me
    about the way things change so
       suddenly
    when your senses come and the feeling goes?
       can you remember feeling much too close?

       Stop your hands from shaking
          Look at me
       Are your senses racing endlessly
          tracing
    past impressions?  So were mine
    Have you ever been used
    or will this be the first time?

       It's come so clear to me
       Light fuse and get away
          No gain, no pain
       It's a fatal game
       and the true lose everything

       I can see
       what trust and loyalty have done for me
       falling miles from the mark
       with a thirst for revenge
       and a dangerous heart

       I've tried to wash from memory
    feelings of betrayal and the incidents
    that plague me since I lost my sense
    of innocence

       A history of changes now I'm loving
    now I'm losing keeps me constantly
    in fear of hearing "I can't see where
    this is going"

       You lie alone with the memory
    feeling the ceiling and walls closing
       in on
          Your Conscience -- my ally
          the guilt -- your affliction
    from preying on praise as you fed
    an attention addiction

       Someone told me
    Light fuse and get away
       No gain, no pain
    and when it's lust to dust you can
    crawl from the wreckage

    I can see
    what trust and loyalty have done for me
    lying bleeding in the dark
    with a thirst for revenge
    and a dangerous heart

    It's come so clear to me
    Light fuse and get away
       No gain, no pain
    It's a fatal game
    and the true lose everything
    I can see
    what trust and loyalty have done for me
    falling miles from the mark
    with a thirst for revenge
    and a dangerous heart

  
 "Afterlife"

    I touched with one
    who made me run
    away from my own soul...
    In this world with its
    many illusions
    We are moving like mice through a maze

    And now I find
    what's left behind
    has served to make me whole
    full of doubt, deception, and delusion
    seeking purpose to all earthly days

    I search within
    beneath a skin
    that bears both pleasure and pain
    In a world full of constant confusion
    I will not be a par to the craze

       In the Afterlife
       will dark be bright?
       will cold be warm?
       will the day have no night?
       In the Afterlife?
       will the blind have sight?
       In the Afterlife.

    Behind closed eyes
    some comfort lies
    In knowing the truth never spoken
    Through this world with its
    hidden conclusion
    we'll keep moving like mice through a maze

       In the Afterlife
       will dark be bright?
       will cold be warm?
       will the day have no night?
       In the Afterlife?
       will the blind have sight?
       In the Afterlife.

       In the Afterlife
       will dark be bright?
       will cold be warm?
          will the day have no night?
       In the Afterlife?
       will the blind have sight?
       In the Afterlife.

  
 "The Ones Who Help To Set The Sun"

    Watching my window I was led like a child
    As the roadway lamplights
    misguided my mind through the night
    a shadow of limits
    We were racing the rain
    my hands held the wheel
    My eyes tried to hold their place

       there must have been a time
       when I thought that you were watching
       It had to be when my senses lost control
       I thought I'd slipped away
       I thought I could still feel us moving
       It must have been a cloud
       no bigger than a man's hand

    Every reason I risk my life
    To come back to you
    Is locked behind your door
    You're my immunity
    Outside I watched you burn
    Heavy hearts were bleeding
    A cry for help, a familiar voice
    My melting hands streaked the glass

       As I walked away
       I wondered what had really happened
       had I run out of time
       did I push myself too far
       As my last step fell
       I felt my hands upon the wheel
       had I come back to life
       or did I ever leave at all
       In higher lives
       We seem to be
       always a moment too late
       We're past the time
       when we looked on
       Now we're
       THE ONES WHO HELP TO SET THE SUN
       this time for real
       I locked the door behind me
       My mind was still a wreck
       from what I saw
       For when my hands are still
       I'll recognize the message
       never again will my senses lose control
       In higher lives
       We seem to be
       Always a moment too late
       We're past the time
       when we looked on
       Now we're
       THE ONES WHO HELP TO SET THE SUN

  
 "Only A Matter Of Time"

    A suited man smiled said:
    'It's just a matter of time
    You can have the world at your feet by tomorrow
    just sign on this line.'
    Hold tight... limelight!
    Approaching the paramount
    with the sun in our eyes
    fearing family ties, legalies, compromise

    In a dimly lit room with a stool as his stage
    a dream-stricken prince of a pauper's descent
    haunts the eavesdropping silence
    that presses his window
    as he sweats a performance
    to an audience that ticks on the walls

    To the practical observer
    It's just a matter of time
       'You can deviate from the commonplace
       only to fall back in line.'
    I understand mine's a risky plan
    and your system can't miss
    But is security after all a cause
    or symptom of happiness?

    Brave, yet afraid, his eyes on horizon
    in a steady-set gaze
    a mariner soon from an open cocoon
    takes a moment to summon his courage
    to stifle his grave apprehension and
    trembling, approaches the surf
    A father's benediction as his hopeful son departs
    to brave the sea of rage and conquer at all costs

    lingers in his memory
    and visions still surviving in a logic-proof shell
    that should have been held sacred, safe and hidden well
    are compromised in usury
    with every rising sun that yields no sight of land
    the hesitation cultivates within the tired man
    and rumors spread of mutiny
    and though the time will come when dream and day unite
    tonight the only consolation causing him to fight
    is fearless faith in destiny

    Even when plan fall to pieces
    I can still find the courage
    with promise I've found in my faith

    Likely or not, it's a dream that we keep
    and at odds with our senses we'll climb
    But if faith is the answer, we've already reached it
    And if spirit's a sign
      then it's only a matter of time
      only a matter of time

 I'm everyone - I feel used,

 "Independent"
 by Sacred Reich

 Read my lips I don't care what you say
 I might listen but I'll do it my own way
 don't you see it don't mean nothing to me
 when all's said and done I'll stand on my two feet

 Let me be I live by my own rules
 independent, independence
 can't you see it's my right to choose
 independence, independent

 Once they tried to teach teach me all their rules
 I had my own ideas didn't fit in, in their schools
 don't they see that we all have a brain
 there to learn not to be whipped and tamed

 Let me be I live by my own rules
 independent, independence
 can't you see it's my right to choose
 independence, independent

 Read my lips I don't care what you say
 I might listen but I'll do it my own way
 don't you see it don't mean nothing to me
 when all's said and done I'll stand on my two feet

 Let me be I live by my own rules
 independent, independence
 can't you see it's my right to choose
 independence, independent

 And my mentality is, money orientated
 I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
 cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as five percenters
 But somethin must of got in us cause all of us turned to sinners
 Now some, restin in peace and some are sittin in San Quentin
 Others such as myself are tryin to carry on tradition
 Keepin the schwepervesence street ghetto essence inside us
 Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
 Even though, we know somehow we all gotta go
 but as long as we leavin thievin we'll be leavin with some kind of dough
 so, and to that day we expire and turn to vapors
 me and my capers-ll be somewhere stackin plenty papers
 Keepin it real, packin steel, gettin high
 Cause life's a bitch and then you die
 
 Chorus: AZ the Visualiza
 
 Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high
 Cause you never know when you're gonna go
 Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye
 Cause you never know when you're gonna go
 Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high
 Cause you never know when you're gonna go
 Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye
                 --> chorus #1 echoes at the end
 
 Cause you never know when you're gonna go
 Life's a bitch and then you die
                 --> chorus #2 includes these lines, echoes at the end
 
 Verse Two: Nas
 
 I woke up early on my born day, I'm twenty years of blessing
 The essence of adolescent leaves my body now I'm fresh in
 My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it
 One quarter through life some God-ly like thing created
 Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
 Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from
 my skull cause it's pain in my brain vein money maintain
 Don't go against the grain simple and plain
 When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
 Droppin foreigners take they wallets they jewels and rip they green cards
 Dipped to the projects flashin my quick cash
 and got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash
 Now it's all about cash in abundance, niggaz I used to run with
 is rich or doin years in the hundreds
 I switched my motto -- instead of sayin fuck tommorrow
 That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
 Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
 I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
 Time is Illmatic keep static like wool fabric
 Pack a four-matic that crack your whole cavity
 
 
 "Word I Said"
 by Spiderbait

 "There once was a time, before television, before motion pictures, before
 radio, before books... The greatest part of human existence was spent in
 such a time. And then..."
 "Do you have anything to say about this before I launch it?"
 "I do think it's both elegant and very beautiful"
 "I wouldn't touch it with a plastic one"

 My best friend has gone away
 From hearing all the things I say
 You want me to be your friend
 It depends how much you wanna spend

 And I can't remember a word I said
 Can't remember a word I said
 Can't remember a word I said
 Can't remember a word I said

 I'm so dull I bore myself
 Power is my only wealth
 You think i'm a big tough boy
 You're prepared to be a toy

 And I can't remember a word you said
 Can't remember a word you said
 Can't remember a word you said
 Can't remember a word you said

 No! Yeah! No! Yeah! No! Yeah!
 No! Yeah! No! Yeah! No! Yeah!
 No! Yeah! No! Yeah! No! Yeah!
 No! Yeah! No! Yeah! No! Yeah!
 No! Yeah! No! Yeah! No! Yeah!
 No! Yeah! No! Yeah! No! Yeah!
 No! Yeah! No! Yeah! No! Yeah!
 No! Yeah! No! Yeah! No! Yeah!
 No! Yeah! No! Yeah! No! Yeah!
 No! No?! No! No?! No! No?!
 No! No!? Yeeeeeaaaahhh NO!!!!
 
 (something) died right by my side
 I'll take you out for a ride
 Two things you can share with me
 Sex and insecurity
 
 And I can't remember a word I said
 Can't remember a word I said
 Can't remember a word I said
 Can't remember a word I said



 "Fly To The Angels"
 by Slaughter

 Pictures of you
 They're still on my mind
 You had the smile
 That could light up the world
 Now it rains
 It seems the sun never shines

 And I'll drive down
 This lonely lonely road
 Ooh I got this feelin'
 Girl, I gotta let you go

 'Cause now you've got to fly
 Fly to the angels
 Heavens awaits your heart
 And flowers bloom in your name
 You've got to fly
 Fly to the angels
 All the stars in the night
 Shine in your name

 You know it hurts me
 Way deep inside
 When I turn and look
 And find that you're not there
 I try to convince myself
 That the pain, the pain
 It's still not gone.


 "One Thing Real"
 by Dan Bern

 i come down the steps
 i slip on the ice
 santa claus been looking
 who's been naughty
 who's been nice
 i'm looking for one thing real tonight
 
 and jesus he comes up to me
 jesus he sits down
 says 'take this cross off my back
 i'm going downtown'
 i said 'oh but ain't that your uniform?'
 he offers me a toke
 he says 'two thousand years is long enough
 for this particular joke'
 he says 'i'm lookin' for one thing real tonight'

 and i sit here singing
 these songs every night
 sometimes i want to just make 'em up
 on the spot
 maybe they wouldn't rhyme too good
 and they might not make sense
 but then at least i wouldn't be repeating myself
 i'm looking for one thing real tonight
 
 and you're the one i've chosen
 and i guess you've chosen me
 let's turn off the commercials
 let's turn off the tv
 how well can we get to know
 each other in an hour?
 we can fight the daylight
 we have that power
 i'm looking for one thing real tonight
 
 and van gogh sits next to me
 with a bucket full of pastes
 he rips off my ear and says
 glue this to my face
 i'd like to leave america
 for someplace where they would
 not know a word of english
 and i might be understood
 i'm looking for one thing real tonight
 

 "The Fox in the Snow"
 by Belle & Sebastian

 fox in the snow, where do you go
 to find something you can eat?
 cause the word out on the street is you are starving
 don't let yourself grow hungry now
 don't let yourself grow cold
 fox in the snow

 girl in the snow, where will you go
 to find someone that will do?
 to tell someone all teh truth before it kills you
 they listen to your crazy laugh
 before you hang a right
 and disappear from sight
 what do they know anyway?
 you'll read it in a book
 what do they know anyway?
 you'll read it in a book tonight

 boy on the bike, what are you like
 as you cycle round the town?
 you're going up, you're going down
 you're going nowhere
 it's not as if they're paying you
 it's not as if it's fun
 at least not anymore
 when your legs are black and blue
 its time to take a break
 when your legs are black and blue
 it's time to take a holiday

 kid in the snow, way to go
 it only happens once a year
 it only happens once a lifetime
 make the most of it
 second just to being born
 second to dying too
 what else could you do?


 "Comedown"
 by Bush

 Love and hate get it wrong 
 She cut me right back down to size 
 Sleep the day let it fade 
 Who was there to take your place 
 No one knows never will 
 Mostly me but mostly you 
 What do you say do you do 
 When it all comes down 

 I don't want to come back down from this cloud
 Taken me all this time to find out what I need 
 And I'm doing fine now

 There is no blame only shame
 When you beg you just complain 
 More I come more I try 
 All police are paranoid 
 So am I - so's the future 
 So are you - be a creature 
 What do you say do you do when it all comes down 
 

 "Isobel"
 by Bjork

 In a forest pitch-dark
 Glowed the tiniest spark
 It burst into flame
 Like me, like me

 My name isobel
 Married to myself
 My love isobel
 Living by herself

 In a heart full of dust
 Lives a creature called lust
 It surprises and scares
 Like me, like me

 My name isobel
 Married to myself
 My love isobel
 Living by herself

 When she does it she means to
 Moth delivers her message
 Unexplained on your collar
 Crawling in silence
 A simple excuse

 Nana na nana, nana na nana
 Nana na nana, nana na nana

 In a tower of steel
 Nature forges a deal
 To raise wonderful hell
 Like me, like me

 My name isobel
 Married to myself
 My love isobel
 Living by herself

 When she does it she means to

 Moth delivers her message
 Unexplained on your collar
 Crawling in silence
 A simple excuse

 Nana na nana, nana na nana X6


 "Fly By Night"
 by Rush

 Why try? I know why
 The feeling inside me says it's time I was gone
 Clear head, new life ahead
 I want to be king now not just one more pawn

 Chorus
 Fly by night, away from here
 Change my life again
 Fly by night, goodbye my dear
 My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend

 Moon rise, thoughtful eyes
 Staring back at me from the window beside
 No fright or hindsight
 Leaving behind that empty feeling inside

 Chorus

 Start a new chapter
 Find what I'm after
 It's changing every day
 The change of a season
 Is enough of a reason
 To want to get away
 Quiet and pensive
 My thoughts apprehensive
 The hours drift away
 Leaving my homeland
 Playing a lone hand
 My life begins today

 Chorus


 "Higher Love"
 by Depeche Mode

 I can taste more than feel
 This burning inside is so real
 I can almost lay my hands upon
 The warm glow that lingers on

 Moved, lifted higher
 Moved, my soul's on fire
 Moved, by a higher love

 I surrender all control
 To the desire that consumes me whole

 And leads me by the hand to infinity
 That lies in wait at the heart of me

 Moved, lifted higher
 Moved, my soul's on fire
 Moved, by a higher love

 Heaven bound on the wings of love
 There's so much that you can rise above

 Moved, lifted higher
 Moved, moved, by a higher love
 By a higher love

 I surrender heart and soul
 Sacrificed to a higher goal

 Moved, moved by a higher love
 By a higher love


 "Milk (Ode to Billy)"
 by Anthrax

 Verse 1
 I woke up, can't wait to eat
 Got my cereal, boy was I beat
 Opened the fridge, and to my dismay
 There was no milk, my mother will pay

 Chorus
 I want some milk!
 My coffee grows cold
 I want  some milk!
 I should've been told

 Bridge

 I wish I had some goddamn milk
 My Cheerios just ain't the same
 I wish I had some goddamn milk
 Too bad the milkman never came

 Verse 2
 I can't  go, out to the store
 I'll just wait 'till Mommy buys more
 I'll just have, wheat thins and beer
 If I get sick the toilet is near

 Chorus

 Bridge

 Chorus


 "Everglade"
 by L7

 Glade told her ma, "Home scene's lame"
 "I gotta go head into town, blow some steam at the rock show"
 Sneak through the back door and head for the pit
 Then some drunk, stupid loser started giving her shit

 Redneck's on parade
 Don't cross my line
 Says Everglade
 Everglade

 He was whipping through the pit
 Knocked her into the stage
 She said, "Have your fun,
 But stop being so lame."
 This guy was drunk, stupid
 And he must have weighed a ton
 Said, "Get out of here girly,
 I'm just trying to have some fun."

 So you wanna have some fun
 Well, break out the big guns
 Redneck's on parade
 Don't cross my line
 Says Everglade
 Everglade

 He kept it up, his fists started flying
 They dodged each punch, as he kept trying
 Tripped on his own feet and hit the floor
 Glade got to pushing and rolled him out the door
 So you wanna have some fun?
 Well break out the big guns
 Rednecks on parade
 Don't cross my line
 Says Everglade
     

 "Too Much"
 by Spiderbait

 Too much you see
 Too much you know
 Too much you think
 Too much you show
 Too much you hate
 Too much you're late
 Too much you buy
 Too much (something)
 Too much for one
 Too much for two
 Too much believing
 I got so much to do
 Too much you pay
 Too much you play
 Too much you lay
 Down to get your way
 
 Too much to take
 Too much to break
 Too much you lie
 Too much you fake
 Too smart for you
 Me and my brew
 I got my broken hand
 Know that I'm a man!
 Touch you on the floor
 Touch you all alone
 Take away your pride
 Touch you from inside
 Now you've seen the show
 'Cos you want (something)
 I've got to slap my thigh
 'Cos I know that you will buy
 
 Too much you bleed
 Too much you need
 I can feel the power
 Of the words I read
 Too much you die
 Too much you lie
 There's no solution
 Fill me up (something)
 Take away the T-shirt
 (something) like oppression
 Got nothing to hide
 Just need your attention
 Too much to make
 Too much to stake
 Finger's in the lake
 Just like Sir Francis Drake


 "Tom's Diner"
 by Suzanne Vega

 I am sitting
 In the morning
 At the diner
 On the corner

 I am waiting
 At the counter
 For the man
 To pur the coffee

 And he fills it
 Only halfway
 And before
 I even argue

 He is looking
 Out the window
 At somebody
 Coming in

 "It is always
 Nice to see you"
 Says the man
 Behind the counter

 To the woman
 Who has come in
 She is shaking
 Her umbrella

 And I look
 The other way
 As they are kissing
 Their hellos

 I'm pretending
 Not to see them
 Instead
 I pour the milk

 I open
 Up the paper
 There's a story
 Of an actor

 Who had died
 While he was drinking
 It was no one
 I had heard of

 And I'm turning
 To the horoscope
 And looking
 For the funnies

 When I'm feeling
 Someone watching me
 And so
 I raise my head

 There's a woman
 On the outside
 Looking inside
 Does she see me?

 No she does not
 Really see me
 Cause she sees
 Her own reflection

 And I'm trying
 Not to notice
 That she's hitching
 Up her skirt

 And while she's
 Straightening her stocking
 Her hair
 Has gotten wet

 Oh, this rain
 It will continue
 Through the morning
 As I'm listening

 To the bells
 Of the cathedral
 I am thinking
 Of your voice...

 And of the midnight picnic
 Once upon a time
 Before the rain began...

 I finish up my coffee
 It's time to catch the train


 "Root Down"
 by Beastie Boys

 I Kick My Root Down
 I Put My Root Down

 It's Not A Put Down
 I Put My Foot Down
 And Then I Make Some Love, I Put My Root Down
 Like Sweetie Pie By The Stone Alliance
 Everbody Knows I'm Known For Dropping Science
 I'm Electric Like Dick Hyman
 I Guess You'd Expect To Catch The Crew Rhymin'
 Never Let You Down With The Stereo Sound
 So Mike, Get On The Mic And Turn It Out
 We're Talking Root Down, I Put My Root Down
 And If You Want To Battle Me, You're Putting Loot Down
 I Said Root Down, It's Time To Scoot Down
 I'm A Step Up To The Mic In My Goose Down
 Come Up Representing From The Upper West
 Money Makin' Putting Me To The Test
 Sometimes I Feel As Though I've Been Blessed
 Because I'm Doing What I Want So I Never Rest
 Well, I'm Not Coming Out Goofy Like The Fruit Of The Loom Guys
 Just Strutting Like The Meters With The Look-ka Py Py
 'Cause Downtown Brooklyn Is Where I Was Born
 but When The Snow Is Falling, Then I'm Gone
 You Might Think That I'm A Fanatic
 A Phone Call From Utah And I'm Throwing A Panic
 But We Kick It From The Root When We Break It On Down
 Jimmy Smith Is My Man, I Want To Give Him A Pound

 (Chorus)

 Ad Rock Don't Stop, Get On The Mic With The Tic And The Toc
 I'll Fill You With The Fuckin' Rim Like Brim
 I'm Walking Down Your Block And You Say That's Him
 There Goes The Guy With The Funky Sound
 The Beastie Boys You Know We Come To Get Down
 Because I've Got The Flow Where I Grab My Dick
 And Say Oh My God, That's The Funky Shit
 So I'm Going To Pass The Mic And Cause A Panic
 The Original Nasal Kid Is Doing Damage
 Every Morning I Took The Train To High Street Station
 Doing Homework On The Train, What A Fucked Up situation
 On The Way Back Up Hearing Battle Tapes
 Through The Underground, Underneath The Sky Scrapes
 Like Harlem World Battles On The Zulu Beat Show
 It's Kool Moe D Vs. Busy Bee There's One You Should Know
 Enough Of That, I Just Want To Give Some Respect Due
 M.C.A. Grab The Mic And The Ma Bell Will Connect You
 Bob Marley Was A Prophet For The Freedom Fight
 "If Dancin' Prays To The Lord Then I Shall Feel Alright"
 It Feels To Play A Little Music
 Tears Running Down My Face 'Cause I Love To Do It
 And No One Can Stop This Flow From Flowing On
 A Flow Master In Disaster With A Sound That's Gone
 I'll Give A Little Shout Out To My Dad And Mom
 For Bringing Me Into This World And So On

 (Chorus)


 "Fish Heads"
 by Barnes & Barnes

 chorus:
 fish heads, fish heads, rolly-polly fish heads
 fish heads, fish heads, eat them up YUM!
 in the morning laughing happy fish heads
 in the evening floating in the soup

 (chorus)

 ask a fish head anything you want to
 they won't answer, they can't talk

 (chorus)

 I took a fish head out to see a movie
 didn't have to pay to get it in

 (chorus)

 they can't play baseball
 they don't wear sweaters
 they're not good dancers
 they don't play drums

 (chorus)

 rolly-polly fish heads
 are never seen drinking cappuccino
 in italian restaurants
 with oriental women
 YEAH!

 (chorus) X4

 Yeah....


 "Bruise Violet"
 by Babes in Toyland

 You got this thing that really makes me hot
 You got a lot and more when you get caught
 You got this thing that follows me around
 You fucking bitch I hope your insides rot

 Liar liar liar

 You see the stars through eyes lit up with lies
 You got your stories all twisted up in mine
 You were born with glue instead of spine
 Of thee I sing tied to a string

 Bruise violet


 "Black Celebration"
 by Depeche Mode

 Let's have a black celebration
 Black celebration
 Tonight

 To celebrate the fact
 That we've seen the back
 Of another black day

 I look to you
 How you carry on
 When all hope is gone
 Can't you see

 Your optimistic eyes
 Seem like paradise
 To someone like
 Me

 I want to take you
 In my arms
 Forgetting all I couldn't do today

 Black celebration
 Black celebration
 Tonight

 To celebrate the fact
 That we've seen the back
 Of another black day

 I look to you
 And your strong belief
 Me, I want relief
 Tonight

 Consolation
 I want so much
 Want to feel your touch
 Tonight

 Take me in your arms
 Forgetting all you couldn't do today

 Black celebration
 I'll drink to that
 Black celebration
 Tonight


 "Worlds Collide"
 by Def Leppard

 Never gonna die now
 Crawling from a wrecked jam, I'm laughing out loud
 Angel on my shoulder
 Living at the speed of sound
 Heavenly distraction
 I'm hanging on the edge and spinning out of control
 Choose your medication
 It's a generation overload

 I can see it falling from the sky
 Can you feel me
 I can hear you calling when you cry
 Can you see me
 Pain and suffering, your knees are tied
 Will you hear me
 Everchanging as your worlds collide
 
 Running going nowhere
 Take it to the limit then it's payback time
 Nothing but a heartache
 Waiting at the end of the line
 Take a look around, babe
 You're looking down the barrel of a loaded mind
 Generation landslide
 Crawling through the enemy lines
 
 I will be the one your justify
 Will you hear me
 I will kiss you with a last goodbye
 
 I thought I was the one who could survive
 Does anyone get outta here alive
 I gotta find the courage, gotta make a change
 And start all over again
 Taken for a ride against my will
 And taking it is always such a bitter pill
 Shaken for the sake of it, no more
 Gotta get away cause I don't know what I'm doing it for
 
 I can see it falling from the sky
 Can you feel me
 I can hear you calling when you cry
 Can you see me
 I will be there when you close your eyes
 Will you hear me
 Everchanging as your worlds collide 
 

 "Family Functions"
 by that dog.

 Now that you are my most special one,
 And you know we've already gone to the prom,
 Won't you come with me to family functions?
 Won't you be the one that I've got on my arm?
 It's not every boy who brings me broken arrows.
 It's not every boy who brings me bottled rain.
 Won't you come with me to family functions?
 You will see then that I'm not really to blame.
 
 Grandpa Earl runs his own kosher fish store,
 Uncle Max was in the Mob.
 Cousin Lester married a shiksa,
 Crazy Aunt Ingas can't find a job.
 Ingas, oh pingas, you're my favorite.
 Great Grandpa Joey choked on a prune.
 Cute little Bunny, all in her party dress.
 Uncle Tony, she's a bride in June.

 "He's a nice Jewish boy," they will say,
 But the truth is that I knew it all along.
 Won't you come with me to family functions?
 You had better, 'cause I wrote you this damn song.


 "Almost Gothic"
 by Steely Dan

 I'm working on gospel time these days
 (The summer - this could be the cool part of the summer)
 The sloe-eyed creature in the reckless room she's so severe
 A wise child walks right out of here
 I'm so excited I can barely cope
 I'm sizzling like an isotope
 I'm on fire so cut me some slack
 
 First she's way gone then she comes back
 She's all business then she's ready to play
 She's almost gothic in a natural way
 
 This house of desire is built foursquare
 (The city - the cleanest kitten in the city)
 When she speaks it's like the slickest song I ever heard
 I'm hanging on her every word
 As if I'm not already blazed enough
 She hits me with the cryptic stuff
 That's her style - to jerk me around
 
 First she's all feel then she cools down
 She's pure science with a splash of black cat
 She's almost gothic and I like it like that
 
 This dark place so thrilling and new
 It's kind of like the opposite of an aerial view
 Unless I'm totally wrong
 I hear her rap and brother it's strong
 I'm pretty sure that what she's telling me is mostly lies
 But I just stand there hypnotized
 I'll just have to make it work somehow
 I'm in the amen corner now
 It's called love - I spell L -U- V
 
 First she's all buzz then she's noise-free
 She's bubbling over then there's nothing to say
 She's almost gothic in a natural way
 
 She's old school then she's like young
 Little Eva meets the Bleecker Street brat
 She's almost gothic but it's better than that


 "Eraser"
 by Nine Inch Nails

 need you
 dream you                 
 find you
 taste you
 fuck you
 use you
 scar you
 break you
 lose me
 hate me
 smash me
 erase me
 <+ kill me [8x]>


 "Another Brick in the Wall Part 2"
 by Pink Floyd

 We don't need no education 
 We dont need no thought control
 No dark sarcasm in the classroom
 Teachers leave them kids alone
 Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!
 All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
 All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
 
 We don't need no education
 We dont need no thought control
 No dark sarcasm in the classroom
 Teachers leave them kids alone
 Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!
 All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
 All in all you're just another brick in the wall.

 "Wrong, Do it again!"
 "If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding. How can you
     have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?"
 "You! Yes, you behind the bikesheds, stand still laddy!"


 "Deepfreeze"
 by Lillian Axe

 Time and time again
 I need reminding of where I've been
 Helplessly scared, left so alone,
 This time I'll make the journey on my own
 Don't stop me now, as this begins
 I feel a brave and new awakening

 Yet life goes on
 But I'll be gone
 A brand new life awaits me
 The setting sun
 Time has begun
 I've settled down, so take my

 Chorus:
 Mind, Slipping in a deepfreeze
 Blind, Living with an uneased mind,
 Doing what I damn please time and again
 Sin, looking at the shit that I'm in,
 Smiling wiht a Cheshire cat grin,
 Floating in a deepfreeze

 Upon your lap I rest my head,
 I thank my lucky stars that I'm not dead yet,
 The fields of green, the mountainsides,
 I fly beyond them and there's a sea of sorrow,
 Guide me to my rest
 And in my deepfreeze I am possessed.

 But life goes on,
 Embrace the dawn
 A brand new song awaits you
 Control your fear
 But keep it near
 I'm melting down so take my

 Chorus:
 Mind, Slipping in a deepfreeze
 Blin, Living with an uneased min,
 Doing what I damn please time and again
 Sin, Looking at the shit that I'm in,
 Smiling with a Cheshire cat grin
 Ashamed of the places I've seen and been,
 Mind, Slipping in a deepfreeze
 Blind, Living in a deepfreeze

 Time to go away
 Escape confusion and disarray,
 I found a peace, tranquility,
 My newborn love, my secret mystery,
 My soul lives on, beyond the skies,
 My questions answered I say good-bye.

 But life goes on
 Embrace the dawn
 A brand new song awaits your mind

 Chorus


 "Wait For You"
 by Bonham

 Come tomorrow
 One day closer to your heart
 Lost around me
 It's time and I'm sad when you're near
 Take your time
 I'll show you the love I've for you
 You're too young
 Too know what it is that I feel

 All that I can do
 Is wait for you
 Just wait for you
 All that I can do
 Is wait for you
 Just wait for you

 Full of sorrow
 Your eyes are to wide and too new
 Though I know
 These feelings I get when you're near
 Deep in fright (???)
 I can't give you love without fear
 You're too young
 I don't know what's keeping me here

 All that I can do
 Is wait for you
 Just wait for you
 All that I can do
 Is wait for you
 Just wait for you

 All that I can do...


 Album: Darkest Days
 by Stabbing Westward


 "Darkest Days"

 there are times
 when I'm just a shell
 when I do not feel anything for anyone
 all I feel is hollow and bruised
 used up and misused
 forced to be someone I don't
 want to be
 have I failed somehow or some way?
 will the weight of today
 finally pull me down to drown
 in the depths of despair
 where I am alone
 except for my rage?
 MY RAGE...MY PAIN
 I HATE my darkest days.
 MY RAGE...MY PAIN
 I HATE my darkest days
 MY RAGE...MY PAIN
 I HATE my darkest days
 MY RAGE...MY PAIN
 I HATE my darkest days
 my darkest days


 "Everything I Touch"

 the more I feel
 the more I die
 nothing to give
 nothing inside
 everything I touch I break (I want to break you)
 everything I touch I break (I want to break you)
 everything I touch I break (I want to break you down)
 I scratch and tear
 until it bleeds
 I do not want
 I only need
 I only need
 I only need...
 everything I touch I break (I want to break you)
 everything I touch I break (I want to break you)
 everything I touch I break (I want to break you down)
 (I want to touch you)
 everything I touch I break (I want to break you)
 (I want to touch you)
 everything I touch I break (I want to break you)
 (I want to touch you)
 everything I touch I break (I want to break you down)


 "How Can I Hold On"

 Back when you were my life,
 you gave me something
 that I could live for.
 Now everything's changed and you're gone
 but I'm still here waiting.
 How can I hold on
 with nothing to hold on to...
 Why should I hold on
 when there's nothing to hold on to
 Sex made me feel alive but now I'm
 so bored with mindless passion
 Drugs were somewhere to hide but
 they left me feeling cold and empty
 How can I hold on
 with nothing to hold on to...
 Why should I hold on
 when there's nothing to hold on to
 I thought you were my friend that you
 were someone that I could turn to
 Now I realize that you were a
 friend when you needed something
 How can I hold on
 with nothing to hold on to...
 Why should I hold on
 when there's nothing to hold on to


 "Drugstore"

 you seduced me, lonely in your hell.
 naked, hungry, I'd crawl into your cell...
 a virtual drugstore is piled on the bed.
 I can't resist with your tongue inside my head...
 how can everything be justified by you?
 (by you,by you, by you)
 how can everything be justified by you?
 (by you, by you, by you, by you)

 you get off on watching me bleed.
 you get off on feeding my disease.
 this time will be perfect you explain.
 your tongue is deadly as a needle through my vein.

 how can everything be justified by you?
 (by you, by you, by you)
 how can my demise be justified by you?
 (by you, by you, by you)

 I'm so tired of living for your touch.
 I'm so tired of needing you so much.
 how can everything be justified by you?
 how can everything be justified by you?
 how can everything be justified by you?
 (by you, by you, by you, by you)

 how can my demise be justified by you?
 (by you, by you, by you)
 when did I decide to be crucified by you?
 (by you, by you, by you)
 how can everything be justified by you?
 (by you, by you, by you, by you)


 "You Complete Me"

 I am lost in the darkness
 between two worlds and here
 I'm struggling...
 You're the light that I've been seeking
 'cause my whole life there's been something missing...
 Only you
 can make me whole.
 Just one touch and
 you complete me.
 Only you
 can make me whole.
 Just one touch and
 you complete me.
 Rescue me from this black hole.
 That's sucked me in and left me dying.
 You're the truth that I've been seeking
 'cause my whole life I've been lying.
 Only you
 can make me whole.
 Just one touch and
 you complete me.
 Only you
 can make me whole.
 Just one touch and
 you complete me.
 God I pray you find me worthy
 of the right to stand beside you.
 And of your truth, and of your passion,
 And of the right to sleep beside you.
 Only you
 can make me whole.
 Just one touch
 and you complete me.
 Only you
 can make me whole.
 Just one touch
 and you complete me.
 Just one touch
 and you complete me.
 Just one touch
 and you complete me.
 Just one touch


 "Save Yourself"

 I know your life is empty
 And you hate to face this world alone
 So you're searching for an angel
 Someone who can make you whole
 I cannot save you; I can't even save myself.
 So just save yourself (save yourself)

 I know that you've been damaged
 your soul has suffered such abuse
 but I am not your savior
 I am just as fucked as you
 (I am just as fucked as you)

 I can not save you; I can't even save myself.
 So just save yourself.

 Please don't take pity on me.
 Please don't take pity on me.
 Please don't take pity on me.
 Please don't take pity on me.
 Please don't take pity on me.

 my life has been a nightmare.
 my soul is fractured to the bone
 so if I must be lonely
 I think I'd rather be alone...
 (I think I'd rather be alone)

 you cannot save me
 you can't even save yourself.
 I cannot save you...I can't even save myself.
 Save yourself
 So just save yourself.


 "Haunting Me"

 Everywhere I go I see your face
 And every sound I hear is the sound of your voice
 Why are you haunting me?
 Why are you hauntingme?
 Why can't I let you go? (GO GO)
 Why are you haunting me?
 Why are you haunting me?
 Why are you haunting me?
 Why are you haunting me?
 Everything about me is a lie
 At least it feels that way
 When I look in your eyes now
 The truth scares the shit out of me
 Whoever said love is blind or love is real
 Has never felt the way that I feel
 What does it matter?
 What's done is done and I should
 Get on with my life
 Why are you haunting me?
 Why are you haunting me?
 Why are you haunting me?
 Why are you haunting me?
 I don't know what it is
 But I can't seem to make myself forget
 Was it something that you said?
 Or is it all the guilt inside my head?
 Why are you haunting me?
 Why are you haunting me?
 Why are you haunting me?
 Why are you haunting me?
 Why are you haunting me?
 Why are you haunting me?


 "Torn Apart"

 I know I should have told you
 but I was so afraid you'd leave
 And now there's nothing left to say,
 well nothing that you'd believe
 I never meant to hurt you with
 the things I couldn't say
 I'd promised you tomorrow while
 denying you today
 These lies have torn my world apart
 These lies have torn my world apart
 These lies have torn my world apart

 A darkness grows inside me in fading shades of grey
 All the colors of the world are slowly sucked away
 I'm sinking ever deeper to a place that's cold and black
 I can't believe I've lost you and you're never coming back

 These lies have torn my world apart
 These lies have torn my world apart
 These lies have torn my world apart
 Torn my world apart

 Soon the night will take me and save me from my pain.
 Cloak me in cold darkness and help me lose your name...

 These lies have torn my world apart
 These lies have torn my world apart
 These lies have torn my world apart
 Torn my world apart
 Torn my world apart
 Torn my world apart


 "Sometimes It Hurts"

 Six o'clock in the morning
 my head is ready to explode
 I can't believe I made it home alive
 I don't remember where I went
 or what I was drinking
 I know it made me sick
 and I'm not denying
 that I get this way
 when I try to get over you
 I get this way
 when I try to get over you
 Sometimes it hurts so much
 to lose the one you love
 Sometimes it hurts so much
 to lose the one you love
 I tried so hard to hate you
 but it only makes things worse
 I only end up hating myself
 And as my hatred grows
 so do the lies
 it's hard to face the truth sometimes
 god I feel so useless
 god I hate myself
 when I try to get over you
 I hate myself will I ever get over you?
 Sometimes it hurts so much to lose the one you love
 Sometimes it hurts so much to lose the one you love
 and after all this time you'd think I'd understand the way you feel, but no
 I only think about myself     and it's driving you away
 I always knew it would one day
 Sometimes it hurts so much to lose
 the one you love
 Sometimes it hurts so much to lose
 the one you love
 Sometimes it hurts so much to lose
 the one you love
 Sometimes it hurts so much to lose
 the one you love


 "Drowning"

 I'm drowning in nothing
 nothing real
 nothing left...nothing
 I'm losing myself
 sinking deeper down
 Silently
 leaving this behind
 nothing left but me
 I'm hating myself
 h  a  t  i  n  g
 everyone hates me now

 everyone has changed
 everything has changed
 everyone has changed
 b  u  t     m  e


 "Desperate Now"

 I keep breaking all the promises
 that I keep making to myself
 you'd think by now that I'd be over this
 instead I'm feeling sorry for myself
 So why does everything seem desperate now
 I should be feeling so alive
 but it feels like something's missing
 something's wrong somehow
 it feels like something
 deep inside has died
 So why do I feel desperate now?
 Why do I feel like dying?
 Why do I feel desperate now?
 Why do I feel desperate now?
 I keep breaking all the promises
 that I keep making to myself
 but promises mean nothing to me anymore
 Circling the drain
 Spiraling to hell
 So why do I feel desperate now?
 Why do I feel like dying?
 Why do I feel desperate now?
 Why do I feel desperate now?


 "Goodbye"

 So this is where I say goodbye
 this is where my story ends
 and if there's one thing that I've
 learned from life
 it's that it gets you in the end
 So goodbye my friend
 G o o d b y e
 Goodbye my friend
 G  o  o  d  b  y  e


 "When I'm Dead"

 I know the tears you're crying in your bed at night alone
 I've cried those tears a thousand times
 but those shallow empty songs about suicide are patronizing
 you've got to learn to face your fears
 do you think I'll feel less lonely when I'm dead?
 It can't silence all the voices in my head
 I close my eyes but I can't make it go away...
 do you think I'll feel less lonely
 God I pray I'm less lonely when I'm dead
 When I'm dead...when I'm dead
 When I'm dead...when I'm dead
 When I'm dead I won't feel any pain
 'cause when I'm dead I won't feel any thing
 When I'm dead...when I'm dead
 When I'm dead...when I'm dead

 I know the songs your singing, saying nothing loud and clear
 I've heard that song a thousand times
 but your noble empty lies about suicide are patronizing
 you can never understand what I feel

 do you think I'll feel less lonely when I'm dead?
 It can't silence all the voices in my head
 I close my eyes but I can't make it go away
 do you think I'll feel less lonely?
 God I pray I'm less lonely when I'm dead
 When I'm dead...when I'm dead
 When I'm dead...when I'm dead
 When I'm dead


 "The Thing I Hate"

 Lost in a world of doubt and insecurity.
 nothing that you hold sacred nothing you believe.
 Your life is a contradiction
 while you thrive on manipulation.
 I fight to just hold on to what I believe.
 I won't become the thing I hate
 I won't become the thing I hate
 I won't become the thing I hate
 I won't become y  o  u

 You've treated me like I'm a worthless piece of shit.
 You think you're in control but you make me sick.
 I want to watch you suffer
 the way that you made me suffer.
 I want to fuck up everything you've ever loved.

 I won't become the thing I hate
 I won't become the thing I hate
 I won't become the thing I hate
 I won't become  y  o  u

 I won't become the thing I hate
 I won't become the thing I hate

 I won't become the thing I hate
 I won't become the thing I hate
 I won't become the thing I hate
 I won't become    y   o   u


 "On Your Way Down"

 I hope I see you on your way down
 I hope you break every bone
 I hope it kills you on your way down
 And I hope you die alone
 All of your hate and all of your lies
 will it be worth it?
 When all of your friends refuse to be alibis...
 will it be worth it?
 I'll see you on your way down
 I'll see you on your way down
 I'll see you on your way down
 It's kind of sad to watch you break down
 you greedy fuck, you pissed it all away
 so who will catch you on your way down?
 you've only got yourself to blame
 When all your worst fears materialize
 w i l l     i t     b e     w o r t h    i t ?
 there's nobody left who cares you're alive
 was it worth it?
 I'll see you on your way down
 I'll see you on your way down
 I'll see you on your way down
 Way down...way down
 I'll see you on your way down
 I'll see you on your way down
 I'll see you on your way down


 "Waking Up Beside You"

 I've been so alone for so long
 forgotten by the world, forgotten to myself
 your effervescent eyes have awakened me
 and brushed the dust away...
 but I knew you'd never stay
 so I memorized the color of your eyes
 as I lost myself inside you
 and I memorized the way our legs entwined
 as I drifted off beside you
 I miss
 God I miss waking up beside you...

 at night I cling to you I'm so afraid
 afraid the day will come
 and I'll wake and find you gone
 but you promise that you'd
 not abandon me
 and kissed my fears away...
 but I woke up to that day...
 but I had memorized the way our eyes would meet
 reflected in the bathroom mirror
 and I memorized your naked silhouette
 as you slowly brushed your hair...
 I miss
 God I miss waking up beside you

 I've been so alone for so long...
 I forgot how much it hurts to wake up so alone...
 but I'd memorized how warm your body felt as you lay
 half-asleep beside me.
 and I memorized the way the sunlight filled the
 room and played upon your body...
 I miss
 God I miss waking up beside you...


 "Duvet"
 by Boa

 And you don't seem to understand
 A shame you seemed an honest man
 And all the fears you hold so dear
 Will turn to whisper in your ear
 And you know what they say might hurt you
 And you know that it means so much
 And you don't even feel a thing

 I am falling, I am fading,
 I have lost it all
 
 And you don't seem the lying kind
 A shame that I can read your mind
 And all the things that I read there
 Candle-lit smile that we both share
 And you know I don't mean to hurt you
 But you know that it means so much
 And you don't even feel a thing

 I am falling, I am fading, I am drowning,
 Help me to breathe
 I am hurting, I have lost it all
 I am losing
 Help me to breathe

 I am falling, I am fading, I am drowning,
 Help me to breathe
 I am hurting, I have lost it all
 I am losing,
 Help me to breathe... ho

 I am falling, I am fading, I am drowning,
 Help me to breathe
 I am hurting, I have lost it all
 I am losing,
 Help me to breathe


 "Anybody Listening?"
 by Queensryche

 You and I long to live like wind upon the water
 If we close our eyes we'll maybe realize
 There's more to life than what we have known
 And I can't believe I've spent so long
 Living lies I knew were wrong inside
 I've just begun to see the light

 Long ago there was a dream, had to make a choice or two
 Leaving all I loved behind for what nobody knew
 Stepped out on the stage
 A life under lights and judging eyes
 Now the applause has died and I can dream again...

 Is there anybody listening?
 Is there anyone that sees what's going on?
 Read between the lines, criticize the words they're selling
 Think for yourself and feel the walls Become sand beneath your feet

 Feel the breeze?
 Time's so near you can almost taste the freedom
 There's a warm wind from the south
 Hoist the sail and we'll be gone
 By morning, this will all seem like a dream
 And if I don't return to sing the song, maybe just as well
 I've seen the news and there's not much I can do... alone

 Is there anybody listening?
 Is there anyone who smiles without a mask?
 What's behind the words-images
 They know will please us?
 I'll take what's real
 Bring up the lights

 Is there anybody listening?
 Is there anyone that sees what's going on?
 Read between the lines
 Criticize the words they're selling
 Think for yourself and feel the walls
 Become sand beneath your feet.


 "Every Breath You Take"
 by The Police

 Every breath you take
 Every move you make
 Every bond you break
 Every step you take

 I'll be watching you

 Every single day
 Every word you say
 Every game you play
 Every night you stay

 I'll be watching you

 Oh can't you see
 You belong to me
 How my poor heart aches with every step you take

 Every move you make
 Every vow you break
 Every smile you fake
 Every claim you stake

 I'll be watching you

 Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace
 I dream at night I can only see your face
 I look around but it's you I can't replace
 I keep crying baby please

 Every move you make
 Every vow you break
 Every smile you fake
 Every claim you stake

 I'll be watching you


 "The Dancer"
 by PJ Harvey

 He came riding fast like a phoenix out of fire flames
 He came dressed in black with a cross bearing my name
 He came bathed in light and splendor and glory
 I can't believe what the lord has finally sent me
 He said dance for me fanciulla gentil
 He said laugh a while, I can make your heart feel
 He said fly with me, touch the face of the true god
 And then cry with joy at the depth of my love
 Cause I've prayed days, I've prayed nights
 For the lord just to send me home some sign
 I've looked long, I've looked far
 To bring peace to my black and empty heart
 My love will stay till the river bed run dry
 And my love lasts long as the sunshine blue sky
 I love him longer as each damn day goes
 The man is gone and heaven only knows
 Cause I've cried days, I've cried nights
 For the lord just to send me up some sign
 Is he near? Is he far?
 Bring peace to my black and empty heart
 So long day, so long night
 Good lord, be near me tonight
 Is he near? Is he far?
 Bring peace to my black and empty heart.


 "The Lovecats"
 by The Cure

 We move like cagey tigers
 We couldn't get closer than this
 The way we walk
 The way we talk
 The way we stalk
 The way we kiss
 We slip through the streets
 While everyone sleeps
 Getting bigger and sleeker
 And wider and brighter
 We bite and scratch and scream all night
 Let's go and throw
 All the songs we know...

 Into the sea
 You and me
 All these years and no one heard
 I'll show you in spring
 It's a treacherous thing
 We missed you hissed the lovecats

 We're so wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully
 Wonderfully pretty!
 Oh you know that I'd do anything for you...
 We should have each other to tea huh?
 We should have each other with cream
 Then curl up by the fire
 And sleep for awhile
 It's the grooviest thing
 It's the perfect dream

 Into the sea
 You and me
 All these years and no one heard
 I'll show you in spring
 It's a treacherous thing
 We missed you hissed the lovecats

 We're so wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully
 Wonderfully pretty!
 Oh you know that I'd do anything for you...
 We should have each other to dinner huh?
 We should have each other with cream
 Then curl up in the fire
 Get up for awhile
 It's the grooviest thing
 It's the perfect dream

 Hand in hand
 Is the only way to land
 And always the right way round
 Not broken in pieces
 Like hated little meeces...
 How could we miss
 Someone as dumb as this?

 I love you... let's go...
 Oh... solid gone...
 How could we miss
 Someone as dumb as this?


 "Close My Eyes Forever"
 by Lita Ford and Ozzy Osbourne

 Baby, I get so scared inside
 And I don't really understand
 Is it love that's on my mind
 Or is it fantasy?
 Heaven is in the palm of my hand
 And it's waiting here for you
 What am I supposed to do
 In a childhood tragedy?
 If I close my eyes forever,
 Will it all remain unchanged?
 If I close my eyes forever,
 Will it all remain the same?
 Sometimes it's hard to hold on,
 So hard to hold onto my dreams
 It isn't always what it seems
 When you're face to face with me
 And like a dagger, you stick me in the heart
 And taste the blood from the blade
 And when we sleep would you shelter me
 In your warm and darkened grave?
 If I close my eyes forever,
 Will it all remain unchanged?
 If I close my eyes forever,
 Will it all remain the same?
 I know I've been so hard on you
 I know I've told you lies
 If I could have just one more wish
 I'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes
 If I close my eyes forever
 Will it all remain unchanged?
 If I close my eyes forever
 Will it all remain the same?
 Close your eyes, close your eyes
 You've gotta close your eyes for me.


 "Smash"
 by The Offspring

 Head over heels
 I've fit in before
 Now I don't wanna do it no more
 I held it all in
 With blood on my face
 Built it up man
 So bad you can taste
 I don't slag no one
 I don't even judge
 Don't give me shit
 'Cause I'm not gonna budge
 I just want to be
 Who I want to be
 Guess that's hard for others to see
 I'm not a trendy asshole
 I do what I want
 I do what I feel like
 I'm not a trendy asshole
 I don't give a fuck
 If it's good enough for you
 'Cause I'm alive
 Smash is the way you feel all alone
 Like an outcast
 You're out on your own
 Smash is the way you deal with your life
 Like an outcast
 You're smashing your strife
 Head over heels
 I've fit in before
 Now I don't wanna do it no more
 I just wanna be who I wanna be
 Guess that's hard for others to see
 I'm not a trendy asshole
 I do what I want
 I do what I feel like
 I'm not a trendy asshole
 I don't give a fuck
 If it's good enough for you
 'Cause I'm alive
 I'm alive
 I'm alive


 "Careless Whisper"
 by Wham

 Time can never mend
 The careless whispers of a good friend
 To the heart and mind
 Ignorance is kind
 There's no comfort in the truth
 Pain is all you find

 Should have known better, yeah

 I feel so unsure
 As I take your hand
 And lead you to the dance floor
 As the music dies
 Something in your eyes
 Calls to mind a silver screen
 And all its sad goodbyes

 I'm never gonna dance again
 Guilty feet have got no rhythm
 Though it's easy to pretend
 I know you're not a fool
 I should have known better than to cheat a friend
 And waste a chance that I've been given
 So I'm never gonna dance again
 The way I danced with you

 Time can never mend
 The careless whispers of a good friend
 To the heart and mind
 Ignorance is kind
 There's no comfort in the truth
 Pain is all you find

 I'm never gonna dance again
 Guilty feet have got no rhyhthm
 Though it's easy to pretend
 I know you're not a fool
 I should have known better than to cheat a friend
 (Should have known better, yeah)
 And waste a chance that I've been given
 So I'm never gonna dance again
 The way I danced with you

 (Never without you)

 Tonight the music seems so loud
 I wish that we could lose this crowd
 Maybe it's better this way
 We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
 We could have been so good together
 We could have lived this dance forever
 But now who's gonna dance with me
 Please stay

 And I'm never gonna dance again
 Guilty feet have got no rhythm
 Though it's easy to pretend
 I know you're not a fool
 I should have known better than to cheat a friend
 And waste a chance that I've been given
 So I'm never gonna dance again
 The way I danced with you

 Now that you're gone
 Now that you're gone
 Now that you're gone
 Was what I did so wrong
 So wrong that you had to leave me alone


 "Our Father"
 by Extreme

 Oh Daddy please,
 take me with you
 where you going
 Oh Daddy please,
 come find the time,
 come watch us growing
 Oh Daddy please,
 don't leave there's so
 much that we want to
 know, before you go 

 I'm in need of someone
 to tie my shoe
 or take hold of my hand
 when I become afraid
 And whose footsteps
 will I follow into,
 Daddy please,
 don't run away 

 Our father
 Far father
 Well let me tell you 'bout
 Our father
 Far farther away... 

 Oh Daddy please,
 I pry every night
 the doors will open
 Oh Daddy please,
 this house is just
 a broken home,
 left all alone. 
 

 "I Remember That"
 by Prefab Sprout

 name me one little thing, you'll be wanting to keep
 as you give up the ghost, as you sink into sleep
 maybe her face in the morning, maybe his in the evening
 maybe words never spoken, aren't they the ones worth hearing?
 say i remember that

 nothing sounds as good as 'i remember that'
 like a bolt out from the blue, did you feel it too? - i remember that

 cuz that's all we can have, yes it's all we can trust
 it's a hell of a ride but a journey to dust
 and there's nothing pathetic listing clothes she'd wear
 if it proves that i had you, if it proves i was there
 say i remember that

 nothing sounds as good as 'i remember that'
 like a bolt out from the blue, did you feel it too? - i remember that


 "Like A Virgin"
 by Madonna

 I made it through the wilderness 
 Somehow I made it through 
 Didn't know how lost I was 
 Until I found you 
 I was beat incomplete 
 I'd been had, I was sad and blue 
 But you made me feel 
 Yeah, you made me feel 
 Shiny and new 

 Chorus:
 Like a virgin 
 Touched for the very first time 
 Like a virgin 
 When your heart beats (after first time, "With your heartbeat") 
 Next to mine 

 Gonna give you all my love, boy
 My fear is fading fast 
 Been saving it all for you 
 'Cause only love can last 
 You're so fine and you're mine 
 Make me strong, yeah you make me bold 
 Oh your love thawed out 
 Yeah, your love thawed out 
 What was scared and cold 

 (chorus)

 Oooh, oooh, oooh
 You're so fine and you're mine 
 I'll be yours 'till the end of time 
 'Cause you made me feel 
 Yeah, you made me feel 
 I've nothing to hide 

 (chorus)

 Like a virgin, ooh, ooh
 Like a virgin 
 Feels so good inside 
 When you hold me, and your heart beats, and you love me 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Ooh, baby 
 Can't you hear my heart beat 
 For the very first time? 


 "A Baby For Pree"
 by Neutral Milk Hotel

 Blistering Pree, all smiling and swollen
 Makes babies to breathe
 With their hearts hanging open all over the sheets
 As soft as beets in some brown dresser drawer
 And with bees in her breath and the rest of her ringing
 They'll sting through her chest with a force hard and beating
 Till wonderfully wet she will get
 Until she's soaked inside her clothes
 And there is no sorry to be sorry for
 For a roll around the floor some afternoon so sound and soft
 It made her swallow all her sweat
 With every bit of breath she coughs
 And when the day it came to pour all her babies
 All across the bathroom floor
 She will be swimming in them all forever more

 
 "Who Are The Freemasons"
 by Spiderbait

 I don't know where I'll go now
 I don't know where I'll go now
 I don't know where I'll go now
 I don't know someone tell me now

 Cut my hair
 Make me swear
 It's nowhere
 Touch me there

 Come on yeah
 Come on yeah
 Come on yeah
 Bam bam bam b bam b bow

 I don't know where I'll go now
 I don't know where I'll go now
 I don't know where I'll go now
 I don't know where I'll go now

 Come on around
 Beat it down
 Broken down
 Can't get around
 
 Come on yeah
 Come on yeah
 Come on yeah
 Bam bam bam b bam b bow


 "Wading Through the Darkness"
 by Flotsam and Jetsam

 Put a gun to my head
 The storm's too deep outlook dead
 Handing down that anger
 Nothing good ever lasts
 Moody violence
 Now a fool in my eyes
 What's the answer, I'll search till I die
 Try a little harder I hear myself say
 Make it last before it's taken away

 Wading through the darkness
  My head held in my hands
 Wading through the darkness

 Forced to forget this anguish
 I'm half of what I used to be
 Erase my memory
 Now gone forever goodbye
 But I know my memories won't die

 Wading through the darkness
  My head held in my hands
 Wading through the darkness

 Dead inside with a heart that bleeds
 Relax my tension needs
 Tightness suffocates
 Too dense to focus
 I'll see it through the day
 No longer churning inside
 Rotted memories inhabit my mind
 My rage destroys the calm
 Destroys the calm

 Wading through the darkness
  My head held in my hands
 Wading through the darkness


 "Mr. Jones"
 by Counting Crows

 I was down at the New Amsterdam staring at this yellow-haired girl 
 Mr. Jones srikes up a coversation with this black-haired flamenco dancer
 She dances while his father plays guitar 
 She's suddenly beautiful 
 We all want something beautiful 
 I wish I was beautiful 

 So come dance this silence down through the morning 
 
 Cut up, Maria! 
 Show me some of them Spanish dances 
 Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones 
 Believe in me 
 Help me believe in anything 
 Cause I want to be someone who believes 
 
 Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales 
 Stare at the beautiful women 
 "She's looking at you. Ah no, no, she's looking at me." 
 Smiling in the bright lights 
 Coming through in stereo 
 When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely 
 
 I will paint my picture 
 Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray 
 All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful 
 Gray is my favorite color 
 I felt so symbolic, yesterday 
 If I knew Picasso 
 I would buy myself a gray guitar and play 
 
 Mr. Jones and me look into the future 
 Stare at the beautiful women 
 "She's looking at you. Uh, I don't think so. She's looking at me." 
 Standing in the spotlight 
 I bought myself a gray guitar 
 When everybody loves me I will never be lonely 
 I will never be lonely 
 Said I never gonna be..lonely 
 
 I wanna to be a lion 
 Everybody wants to pass as cats 
 We all want to be big, big stars, but we got different reasons for that 
 Believe in me, because I don't believe in anything 
 And I want to be someone to believe, to believe 
 
 Mr. Jones and me stumbling through the barrio 
 Yeah we stare at the beautiful women 
 "She's perfect for you, man, there's got to be somebody for me." 
 I want to be Bob Dylan 
 Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky 
 When everybody loves you, son, that's just about as funky as you can be 
 
 Mr. Jones and me staring at the video 
 When I look at the televison I want to see me staring right back at me 
 We all want to be big stars, but we don't know why and we don't know how 
 But when everybody loves me 
 I'm going to be just about as happy as I can be 
 Mr. Jones and me: we're gonna be big stars... 


 "Jerusalem"
 by Dan Bern

 When I tell you that I love you
 Don't test my love
 Accept my love don't test my love
 Cause maybe I don't love you all that much
 
 Don't ask what kind of music I'm gonna play tonight
 just stay awhile hear for yourself awhile
 and if you must put me in a box
 make sure it's a big box
 with lots of windows
 and a door to walk through
 and a nice high chimney
 So we can burn burn burn
 Everything that we don't like
 And watch the ashes fly up to Heaven
 Maybe all the way to India
 I'd like that
 
 All the ancient kings came to my door
 They said do you want to be an ancient king too
 I said oh yes very much
 But I think my timings wrong
 They said time is relative
 Or did you misread Einstien
 I said do you really mean it
 They said what do you think we come hee for
 Our g**damn health or something
 
 Everybody's waiting for the messiah
 The Jews are waiting
 The Chrisdtians are waiting
 Oh so are the Muslims
 It's like everybody's waiting
 They been waiting a long time
 I know how I hate to wait
 Like even for a bus or something
 An important phone call
 So I can imagine how darned impatient
 Everyone must be getting
 
 So I thnk it's time now
 Time to reveal myself
 I am the Messiah
 I am the Messiah
 
 Yes I think you heard me right
 I am the Messiah
 I was gonna wait till next year
 Build up the suspense a little
 Make it a really big surprise
 But I could not resist
 It's like when you got a really big secret
 You're just bursting to tell someone
 It was kinda like that with this
 And now that I've told you
 I feel this great weight lifted
 Dr. Nusbaum was right
 He's my therapist
 He said get it out in the open
 
 I spent ten whole days in Jerusalem
 Mmmm Jerusalem sweet Jerusalem
 And all I ate was olives
 Nothing but olives
 Mountains of olives
 It was a good ten days
 I like olives
 I like you too
 
 So When I tell you that I love you
 Don't test my love
 Accept my love don't test my love
 Cause maybe I don't love you all that much


 "Vote With a Bullet"
 by Corrosion of Conformity

 The number in nations
 The god in their hearts
 The justice in swine
 The devil in God

 VOTE

 This long hand that breaks our backs
 Still casting shadows on all that we see
 Unjustified...mercy killing is just a feeling
 To keep our numbers from being free

 (Chorus)
 Prison for praise is not worth thinking
 Sin is still in and our ballots are shrinking
 So unleash the dogs - the only solution
 Forgive and forget, fuck no
 I'm talking about a revolution

 The prophet man's got a needle in his hand
 Draws his dreams from your soul - bleeding
   minds into sand
 The year of the fear has arrived decades too late
 And our right to stand and fight is now
   solely sealed in fate

 (Repeat first chorus)

 One last chance mission with a vision
 'cos our lives are just cards i their stack
 Our time is short but theirs is shorter
 How much longer can they hold us back

 (Chorus)
 Prison for praise - the obvious answer
 Once had power mad - living disaster
 Don't fuck with me 'cos I'm on a freedom train
 That bears no name - this time
 I'm voting with a bullet

 This view they once knew made our nooses too tight
 This justice in swine
 This devil in god

 So God bless my soul - I've got total control
 And the crosshairs lined up dead in my sight

 I'm voting with a bullet


 "Strangelove"
 by Depeche Mode

 There'll be times
 When my crimes
 Will seem almost unforgivable
 I give in to sin
 Because you have to make this life livable
 But when you think I've had enough
 >From your sea of love
 I'll take more than another riverful
 And I'll make it all worthwhile
 I'll make your heart smile

 Strangelove
 Strange highs and strange lows
 Strangelove
 That's how my love goes
 Strangelove
 Will you give it to me
 Will you take the pain
 I will give to you
 Again and again
 And will you return it

 There'll be days
 When I stray
 I may appear to be
 Constantly out of reach
 I give in to sin
 Because I like to practice what I preach
 I'm not trying to say
 I'll have it all my way
 I'm always willing to learn
 When you've got something to teach
 And I'll make it all worthwhile
 I'll make your heart smile

 Pain will you return it
 I'll say it again - pain
 Pain will you return it
 I won't say it again

 I give in
 Again and again
 I give in
 Will you give it to be
 I give in
 I'll say it again
 I give in

 I give in
 Again and again
 I give in
 That's how my love goes
 I give in
 I'll say it again
 I give in


 "Smells Like Teen Spirit"
 by Nirvana

 Load up on guns and bring your friends
 It's fun to lose and to pretend
 She's over bored and self assured
 Oh no, I know a dirty word
 
 Hello, hello, hello, how low?
 
 I'm worse at what I do best
 And for this gift I feel blessed
 Our little group has always been      (tribe)
 And always will until the end
 
 Hello, hello, hello, how low?
 
 And I forget just why I taste
 Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
 I found it hard, it was hard to find
 Oh well, whatever, nevermind
 
 hello, hello, hello, how low?
 
 With the lights out it's less dangerous
 Here we are now, entertain us
 I feel stupid and contagious
 A mulatto
 An albino
 A mosquito
 My Libido
 Yay, a denial


 "Scavenger Type"
 by NOFX

 Gigin alone at the bottom of the hill
 Our protagonist named Bill
 Sets his sights on an anchor steam pint
 All he needs is thirteen quarters
 Congregated in his hat

 A crow, a scavenger type
 California redemption provides him with his rent
 Room and board inside a fifth of comfort

 As the wind penetrates his bones
 His mind keeps focused
 Tidal waves of sound catapulted
 From his horn wail like lovers

 The coins don't drop consistent as does the mercury
 His meter slows realizing a zenith
 He's reached perfection
 No one did see him die


 "Junkie Girl"
 by Walter Becker

 in the good old bad part of this college town
 men in business suits they run you down
 you take their money just like you take mine
 you send it bubbling down the thin blue line
 it doesn't matter how it got this way
 cause we could make it through this thing together
 i know you're laughing but I got to say
 now i still want you maybe more than ever

 no foolin, its a fucked up world
 so be cool my little junkie girl

 the cops are out to shut the district down
 i comb the ruins of your stomping grounds
 stanyan street looking like that third world war
 you come up blazing like an open sore
 now i believe you but i got to know
 how come the right side of your brain is hurtin?
 so take me with you when you go
 through to the white side of your china curtain

 no foolin, its a fucked up world
 so be cool my little junkie girl

 in the good old bad part of this college town
 men in grey limousines will drive you down
 you take their money just like you take mine
 where does it get you on that thin blue line
 now i can hardly hear you anymore
 your eyes are empty and your voice is hollow
 i see you waving from a distant shore
 and where you're going i don't dare to follow

 no foolin, that's another world
 good luck, my little junkie girl

 ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER
  
   
 "There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
 "There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
 Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
 None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
 
 "No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
 "There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
 But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate,
 So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."

 All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
 While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.
 Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
 Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
   

 ABANDONED LOVE
                                          
 I can hear the turning of the key
 I've been deceived by the clown inside of me.
 I thought that he was righteous but he's vain
 Oh, something's a-telling me I wear the ball and chain.

 My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost
 He's always off somewhere when I need him most.
 The Spanish moon is rising on the hill
 But my heart is a-tellin' me I love ya still.
 
 I come back to the town from the flaming moon
 I see you in the streets, I begin to swoon.
 I love to see you dress before the mirror
 Won't you let me in your room one time 'fore I finally disappear?

 Everybody's wearing a disguise
 To hide what they've got left behind their eyes.
 But me, I can't cover what I am
 Wherever the children go I'll follow them.

 I march in the parade of liberty
 But as long as I love you I'm not free.
 How long must I suffer such abuse
 Won't you let me see you smile one time before I turn you loose?

 I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
 The pot of gold is only make-believe.
 The treasure can't be found by men who search
 Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.

 We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
 I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list.
 My head tells me it's time to make a change
 But my heart is telling me I love ya but you're strange.

 One more time at midnight, near the wall
 Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
 Won't you descend from the throne, from where you sit?
 Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.


 ABSOLUTELY SWEET MARIE
                                       
 Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it
 Sometimes it gets so hard, you see
 I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
 With all these promises you left for me
 But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

 Well, I waited for you when I was half sick
 Yes, I waited for you when you hated me
 Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
 When you knew I had some other place to be
 Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

 Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously
 But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately.
 
 Well, six white horses that you did promise
 Were fin'lly delivered down to the penitentiary
 But to live outside the law, you must be honest
 I know you always say that you agree
 But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
 
 Well, I don't know how it happened
 But the river-boat captain, he knows my fate
 But ev'rybody else, even yourself
 They're just gonna have to wait.
 
 Well, I got the fever down in my pockets
 The Persian drunkard, he follows me
 Yes, I can take him to your house but I can't unlock it
 You see, you forgot to leave me with the key
 Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
 
 Now, I been in jail when all my mail showed
 That a man can't give his address out to bad company
 And now I stand here lookin' at your yellow railroad
 In the ruins of your balcony
 Wond'ring where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
   

 AIN'T A-GONNA GRIEVE
   
 Well, I ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more
 Ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more
 Ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more
 And ain't a-gonna grieve no more.

 Come on brother, join the band,
 Come on sisters, clap your hands,
 Tell everybody that's in the land,
 You ain't a-gonna grieve no more.

 Well, I ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more
 Ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more
 Ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more
 And ain't a-gonna grieve no more.

 Brown and blue and white and black,
 All one color on the one-way track,
 We got this far and ain't a-goin' back
 And ain't a-gonna grieve no more.

 Well, I ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more
 Ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more
 Ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more
 I ain't a-gonna grieve no more.

 We're gonna notify your next of kin,
 You're gonna raise the roof until the house falls in.
 If you get knocked down get up again,
 We ain't a-gonna grieve no more.

 Well, I ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more
 Ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more
 Ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more
 I ain't a-gonna grieve no more.

 We'll sing this song all night long,
 Sing it to my baby from midnight on.
 She'll sing it to you when I'm dead and gone,
 Ain't a-gonna grieve no more.

 Well, I ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more
 Ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more
 Ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more
 I ain't a-gonna grieve no more.
   

 AIN'T NO MAN RIGHTEOUS
 (No Not One)
                                       
 When a man he serves the Lord, it makes his life worthwhile.
 It don't matter 'bout his position, it don't matter 'bout his lifestyle.
 Talk about perfection, I ain't never seen none
 And there ain't no man righteous, no not one.

 Sometimes the devil likes to drive you from the neighborhood.
 He'll even work his ways through those whose intentions are good.
 Some like to worship on the moon, others are worshipping the sun
 And there ain't no man righteous, no not one.

 Look around, ya see so many social hypocrites
 Like to make rules for others while they do just the opposite.
 
 You can't get to glory by the raising and the lowering of no flag.
 Put your goodness next to God's and it comes out like a filthy rag.
 In a city of darkness there's no need of the sun
 And there ain't no man righteous, no not one.
 
 Done so many evil things in the name of love, it's a crying shame
 I never did see no fire that could put out a flame.
 
 Pull your hat down, baby, pull the wool down over your eyes,
 Keep a-talking, baby, 'til you run right out of alibis.
 Someday you'll account for all the deeds that you done.
 Well, there ain't no man righteous, no not one.

 God got the power, man has got his vanity,
 Man gotta choose before God can set him free.
 Don't you know there's nothing new that's under the sun?
 Well, there ain't no man righteous, no not one.
 
 When I'm gone don't wonder where I be.
 Just say that I trusted in God and that Christ was in me.
 Say He defeated the devil, He was God's chosen Son
 And that there ain't no man righteous, no not one.
   

 ALBERTA
                                       
 Alberta let your hair hang low
 Alberta let your hair hang low
 I'll give you more gold
 Than your apron can hold
 If you'd only let your hair hand low

 Alberta what's on your mind
 Alberta what's on your mind
 You keep me worried and bothered
 All of the time
 Alberta what's on your mind

 Alberta don't you treat me unkind
 Alberta don't you treat me unkind
 Oh my heart is so sad
 Cause I want you so bad
 Alberta don't you treat me unkind

 Alberta let your hair hang low
 Alberta let your hair hang low
 I'll give you more gold
 Than your apron can hold
 If you'll only let your hair hand low
   

 ALL I REALLY WANT TO DO
                                       
 I ain't lookin' to compete with you,
 Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
 Simplify you, classify you,
 Deny, defy or crucify you.
 All I really want to do
 Is, baby, be friends with you.

 No, and I ain't lookin' to fight with you,
 Frighten you or tighten you,
 Drag you down or drain you down,
 Chain you down or bring you down.
 All I really want to do
 Is, baby, be friends with you.

 I ain't lookin' to block you up
 Shock or knock or lock you up,
 Analyze you, categorize you,
 Finalize you or advertise you.
 All I really want to do
 Is, baby, be friends with you.
 
 I don't want to straight-face you,
 Race or chase you, track or trace you,
 Or disgrace you or displace you,
 Or define you or confine you.
 All I really want to do
 Is, baby, be friends with you.

 I don't want to meet your kin,
 Make you spin or do you in,
 Or select you or dissect you,
 Or inspect you or reject you.
 All I really want to do
 Is, baby, be friends with you.

 I don't want to fake you out,
 Take or shake or forsake you out,
 I ain't lookin' for you to feel like me,
 See like me or be like me.
 All I really want to do
 Is, baby, be friends with you.
   

 ALL OVER YOU
                                       
 Well, if I had to do it all over again,
 Babe, I'd do it all over you.
 And if I had to wait for ten thousand years,
 Babe, I'd even do that too.
 Well, a dog's got his bone in the alley,
 A cat, she's got nine lives,
 A millionaire's got a million dollars,
 King Saud's got four hundred wives.
 Well, ev'rybody's got somethin'
 That they're lookin' forward to.
 I'm lookin' forward to when I can do it all again
 And babe, I'll do it all over you.
 
 Well, if I had my way tomorrow or today,
 Babe, I'd run circles all around.
 I'd jump up in the wind, do a somersault and spin,
 I'd even dance a jig on the ground.
 Well, everybody gets their hour,
 Everybody gets their time,
 Little David when he picked up his pebbles,
 Even Sampson after he went blind.
 Well, everybody gets the chance
 To do what they want to do.
 When my time arrives you better run for your life
 'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you.
 
 Well, I don't need no money, I just need a day that's sunny,
 Baby, and my days are gonna come.
 And I grab me a pint, you know that I'm a giant
 When you hear me yellin', "Fee-fi-fo-fum."
 Well, you cut me like a jigsaw puzzle,
 You made me to a walkin' wreck,
 Then you pushed my heart through my backbone,
 Then you knocked off my head from my neck.
 Well, if I'm ever standin' steady
 A-doin' what I want to do,
 Well, I tell you little lover that you better run for cover
 'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you.

 I'm just restin' at your gate so that I won't be late
 And, momma, I'm a-just sittin' on the shelf.
 Look out your window fair and you'll see me squattin' there
 Just a-fumblin' and a-mumblin' to myself.
 Well, after my cigarette's been smoked up,
 After all my liquor's been drunk,
 After my dreams are dreamed out,
 After all my thoughts have been thunk,
 Well, after I do some of these things,
 I'm gonna do what I have to do.
 And I tell you on the side, that you better run and hide
 'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you.
   

 ALL THE TIRED HORSES
                                       
 All the tired horses in the sun
 How'm I supposed to get any ridin' done? Hmm.
   

 ANGELINA
                                       
 Well, it's always been my nature to take chances
 My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances
 Where the current is strong and the monkey dances
 To the tune of a concertina
 
 Blood dryin' in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore
 I know what it is that has drawn me to your door
 But whatever it could be, makes you think you've seen me before
 Angelina
 
 Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina
 
 His eyes were two slits that would make a snake proud
 With a  face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
 Worshipping a god with the body of a woman well endowed
 And the head of a hyena
 
 Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
 If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
 No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek
 Angelina
 
 Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina
 
 In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode
 The peaches they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed
 I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road
 With your subpoena

 When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
 I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game
 Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same
 Angelina

 Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina
 
 There's a black Mercedes rollin' through the combat zone
 Your servants are half dead; you're down to the bone
 Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown
 Maybe down in Jerusalem or Argentina?
 
 She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old
 Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold
 He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearin' a blindfold
 And so are you, Angelina
 
 Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina
 
 I see pieces of men marching; trying to take heaven by force
 I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse
 In God's truth tell me what you want, and you'll have it of course
 Just step into the arena

 Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases
 Pass the tree of smoke, pass the angel with four faces
 Begging God for mercy and weepin' in unholy places
 Angelina

 Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina
   

 APPLE SUCKLING TREE
                                       
 Old man sailin' in a dinghy boat
 Down there
 Old man down is baitin' a hook
 On there
 Gonna pull man down on a suckling hook
 Gonna pull man into the suckling brook
 Oh yeah!
 
 Now, he's underneath that apple suckling tree
 Oh yeah!
 Under that apple suckling tree
 Oh yeah!
 That's underneath that tree
 There's gonna be just you and me
 Underneath that apple suckling tree
 Oh yeah!

 I push him back and I stand in line
 Oh yeah!
 Then I hush my Sadie and stand in line
 Oh yeah!
 Then I hush my Sadie and stand in line
 I get on board in two-eyed time
 Oh yeah!
 
 Under that apple suckling tree
 Oh yeah!
 Under that apple suckling tree
 Oh yeah!
 Underneath that tree
 There's just gonna be you and me
 Underneath that apple suckling tree
 Oh yeah!
 
 Now, who's on the table. who's to tell me?
 Oh yeah!
 Who's on the table, who's to tell me?
 Oh yeah!
 Who should I tell, oh, who should I tell?
 The forty-nine of you like bats out of hell
 Oh underneath that old apple suckling tree
   

 ARE YOU READY?
                                       
 Are you ready, are you ready?
 Are you ready, are you ready?
 
 Are you ready to meet Jesus?
 Are you where you ought to be?
 Will He know you when He sees you
 Or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
 
 Are you ready, hope you're ready.
 Am I ready, am I ready?
 Am I ready, am I ready?
 
 Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren
 And to take up my cross?
 Have I surrendered to the will of God
 Or am I still acting like the boss?
 
 Am I ready, hope I'm ready.
 
 When destruction cometh swiftly
 And there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
 Have you decided whether you want to be
 In heaven or in hell?
 
 Are you ready, are you ready?
 
 Have you got some unfinished business?
 Is there something holding you back?
 Are you thinking for yourself
 Or are you following the pack?
 
 Are you ready, hope you're ready.
 Are you ready?
 
 Are you ready for the judgment?
 Are you ready for that terrible swift sword?
 Are you ready for Armageddon?
 Are you ready for the day of the Lord?

 Are you ready, I hope you're ready.
   

 AS I WENT OUT ONE MORNING
                                       
 As I went out one morning
 To breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
 I spied the fairest damsel
 That ever did walk in chains.
 I offer'd her my hand,
 She took me by the arm.
 I knew that very instant,
 She meant to do me harm.
 
 "Depart from me this moment,"
 I told her with my voice.
 Said she, "But I don't wish to,"
 Said I, "But you have no choice."
 "I beg you, sir," she pleaded
 From the corners of her mouth,
 "I will secretly accept you
 And together we'll fly south."
 
 Just then Tom Paine, himself,
 Came running from across the field,
 Shouting at this lovely girl
 And commanding her to yield.
 And as she was letting go her grip,
 Up Tom Paine did run,
 "I'm sorry, sir," he said to me,
 "I'm sorry for what she's done."
   

 ARTHUR MCBRIDE
                                       
 Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
 As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside,
 Mark now what followed and what did betide,
 For it bein' on Christmas mornin'.
 Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp,
 And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
 And a little wee drummer intending to camp,
 For the day bein' pleasant and charmin'.
 
 "Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant he cried.
 "And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
 Intending no harm but meant to pass by,
 For it bein' on Christmas mornin'.
 "But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
 Ten guineas in gold I'll stick to your fist,
 And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust,
 And drink the king's health in the morning.
 
 "For a soldier, he leads a very fine life,
 And he always is blessed with a charming young wife,
 And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife,
 And he always lives pleasant and charmin',
 And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
 In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen.
 While other poor fellows go dirty and mean,
 And sup on thin gruel in the morning."
 
 "But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes,
 For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose,
 But you dare not change them one night, for you know
 If you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
 And although that we're single and free,
 We take great delight in our own company.
 We have no desire strange places to see,
 Although that your offers are charming.
 
 "And we have no desire to take your advance,
 All hazards and dangers we barter on chance,
 For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France,
 Where we would get shot without warning."
 "Oh no," says the Sergeant.  "I'll have no such chat,
 And neither will I take it from snappy young brats,
 For if you insult me with one other word,
 I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
 
 And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
 And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
 When a trusty shillelagh came over their head
 And bid them take that as fair warning.
 And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
 We flung them as far as we could in the tide,
 "Now take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride,
 "And temper their edge in the mornin'!"
 
 And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow,
 And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
 Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll,
 And bade it a tedious returning,
 And we havin' no money, paid them off in cracks.
 We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
 And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks,
 And left them for dead in the morning.
 
 And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
 We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits,
 For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts
 And bid them look sharp in the mornin'.
 
 Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
 As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside,
 Mark now what followed and what did betide,
 For it bein' on Christmas mornin'.
   

 BABY, I'M IN THE MOOD FOR YOU
                                       
 Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home

 And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit the highway road
 But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said

 But then again, I said again, I said again, I said
 Oh babe, I'm in the mood for you.

 Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna sleep in my pony's stall
 Sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothin' at all
 Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna fly like a cannon ball
 But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said
 Oh babe, I'm in the mood for you.

 Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna back up against the wall
 Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna run till I have to crawl
 Sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothin' at all
 But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said
 Oh babe, I'm in the mood for you.

 Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change my house around
 Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna make a change in this here town
 Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna change the world around
 But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said
 Oh babe, I'm in the mood for you.

 BALLAD FOR A FRIEND
                                       
 Sad I'm sittin' on the railroad track,
 Watchin' that old smokestack.
 Train is a-leavin' bit it won't be back.

 Years ago we hung around,
 Watchin' trains roll through the town.
 Now that train is a-graveyard bound.
 
 Where we go up in that North Country,
 Lakes and streams and mines so free,
 I had no better friend than he.
 
 Something happened to him that day,
 I thought I heard a stranger say,
 I hung my head and stole away.
 
 A diesel truck was rollin' slow,
 Pullin' down a heavy load.
 It left him on a Utah road.

 They carried him back to his home town,
 His mother cried, his sister moaned,
 Listin' to them church bells tone.
   

 BALLAD IN PLAIN D
                                       
 I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze.
 With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
 I courted her proudly but now she is gone,
 Gone as the season she's taken.
 
 Through young summer's breeze, I stole her away
 From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
 Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
 With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
 
 Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
 With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
 The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
 By the jealousy of others around her.

 For her parasite sister, I had no respect,
 Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect.
 Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
 As a crutch for her scenes and her society.

 Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused,
 The changes I was going through can't even be used,
 For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose
 The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.

 With unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip
 A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
 Noticing not that I'd already slipped
 To a sin of love's false security.

 From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
 Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies,
 Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, "Please,
 What's wrong and what's exactly the matter?"

 And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
 The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
 At the peak of the night, the king and the queen
 Tumbled all down into pieces.

 "The tragic figure!" her sister did shout,
 "Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!"
 And I in my armor, turning about
 And nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness.

 Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound
 Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
 And she in between, the victim of sound,
 Soon shattered as a child 'neath her shadows.

 All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight.
 I gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight.
 My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night
 Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.

 The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet.
 The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet.
 I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
 Will be fully aware of how precious she is.

 Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
 "How good, how good does it feel to be free?"
 And I answer them most mysteriously,
 "Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?"
   

 BALLAD OF HOLLIS BROWN
                                       
 Hollis Brown
 He lived on the outside of town
 Hollis Brown
 He lived on the outside of town
 With his wife and five children
 And his cabin fallin' down

 You looked for work and money
 And you walked a rugged mile
 You looked for work and money
 And you walked a rugged mile
 Your children are so hungry
 That they don't know how to smile

 Your baby's eyes look crazy
 They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
 Your baby's eyes look crazy
 They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
 You walk the floor and wonder why
 With every breath you breathe

 The rats have got your flour
 Bad blood it got your mare
 The rats have got your flour
 Bad blood it got your mare
 If there's anyone that knows
 Is there anyone that cares?
 
 You prayed to the Lord above
 Oh please send you a friend
 You prayed to the Lord above
 Oh please send you a friend
 Your empty pockets tell yuh
 That you ain't a-got no friend

 Your babies are crying louder
 It's pounding on your brain
 Your babies are crying louder now
 It's pounding on your brain
 Your wife's screams are stabbin' you
 Like the dirty drivin' rain
 
 Your grass it is turning black
 There's no water in your well
 Your grass is turning black
 There's no water in your well
 You spent your last lone dollar
 On seven shotgun shells
 
 Way out in the wilderness
 A cold coyote calls
 Way out in the wilderness
 A cold coyote calls
 Your eyes fix on the shotgun
 That's hangin' on the wall

 Your brain is a-bleedin'
 And your legs can't seem to stand
 Your brain is a-bleedin'
 And your legs can't seem to stand
 Your eyes fix on the shotgun
 That you're holdin' in your hand

 There's seven breezes a-blowin'
 All around the cabin door
 There's seven breezes a-blowin'
 All around the cabin door
 Seven shots ring out
 Like the ocean's pounding roar

 There's seven people dead
 On a South Dakota farm
 There's seven people dead
 On a South Dakota farm
 Somewhere in the distance
 There's seven new people born
   

 BALLAD OF DONALD WHITE
                                       
 My name is Donald White, you see,
 I stand before you all.
 I was judged by you a murderer
 And the hangman's knot must fall.
 I will die upon the gallows pole
 When the moon is shining clear,
 And these are my final words
 That you will ever hear.
 
 I left my home in Kansas
 When I was very young,
 I landed in the old Northwest,
 Seattle, Washington
 Although I'd a-traveled many miles,
 I never made a friend,
 For I could never get along in life
 With people that I met.
 
 If I had some education
 To give me a decent start,
 I might have been a doctor or
 A master in the arts.
 But I used my hands for stealing
 When I was very young,
 And they locked me down in jailhouse cells,
 That's how my life begun.
 
 Oh, the inmates and the prisoners,
 I found they were my kind,
 And it was there inside the bars
 I found my peace of mind.
 But the jails they were too crowded,
 Institutions overflowed,
 So they turned me loose to walk upon
 Life's hurried tangled road.
 
 And there's danger on the ocean
 Where the salt sea waves split high,
 And there's danger on the battlefield
 Where the shells of bullets fly,
 And there's danger in this open world
 Where men strive to be free,
 And for me the greatest danger
 Was in society.
 
 So I asked them to send me back
 To the institution home.
 But they said they were too crowded,
 For me they had no room.
 I got down on my knees and begged,
 "Oh, please put me away,"
 But they would not listen to my plea
 Or nothing I would say.
 
 And so it was on Christmas eve
 In the year of '59,
 It was on that night I killed a man,
 I did not try to hide,
 The jury found me guilty
 And I won't disagree,
 For I knew that it would happen
 If I wasn't put away.
 
 And I'm glad I've had no parents
 To care for me or cry,
 For now they will never know
 The horrible death I die.
 And I'm also glad I've had no friends
 To see me in disgrace,
 For they'll never see that hangman's hood
 Wrap around my face.
 
 Farewell unto the old north woods
 Of which I used to roam,
 Farewell unto the crowded bars
 Of which've been my home,
 Farewell to all you people
 Who think the worst of me,
 I guess you'll feel much better when
 I'm on that hanging tree.
 
 But there's just one question
 Before they kill me dead,
 I'm wondering just how much
 To you I really said
 Concerning all the boys that come
 Down a road like me,
 Are they enemies or victims
 Of your society?
   

 THE BALLAD OF FRANKIE LEE AND JUDAS PRIEST
                                       
 Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest,
 They were the best of friends.
 So when Frankie Lee needed money one day,
 Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
 And placed them on a footstool
 Just above the plotted plain,
 Sayin', "Take your pick, Frankie Boy,
 My loss will be your gain."
 
 Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down
 And put his fingers to his chin,
 But with the cold eyes of Judas on him,
 His head began to spin.
 "Would ya please not stare at me like that," he said,
 "It's just my foolish pride,
 But sometimes a man must be alone
 And this is no place to hide."
 
 Well, Judas, he just winked and said,
 "All right, I'll leave you here,
 But you'd better hurry up and choose
 Which of those bills you want,
 Before they all disappear."
 "I'm gonna start my pickin' right now,
 Just tell me where you'll be."
 
 Judas pointed down the road
 And said, "Eternity!"
 "Eternity?" said Frankie Lee,
 With a voice as cold as ice.
 "That's right," said Judas Priest, "Eternity,
 Though you might call it 'Paradise.'"
 
 "I don't call it anything,"
 Said Frankie Lee with a smile.
 "All right," said Judas Priest,
 "I'll see you after a while."
 
 Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down,
 Feelin' low and mean,
 When just then a passing stranger
 Burst upon the scene,
 Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler,
 Whose father is deceased?
 Well, if you are,
 There's a fellow callin' you down the road
 And they say his name is Priest."
 
 "Oh, yes, he is my friend,"
 Said Frankie Lee in fright,
 "I do recall him very well,
 In fact, he just left my sight."
 "Yes, that's the one," said the stranger,
 As quiet as a mouse,
 "Well, my message is, he's down the road,
 Stranded in a house."
 
 Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked,
 He dropped ev'rything and ran
 Until he came up to the spot
 Where Judas Priest did stand.
 "What kind of house is this," he said,
 "Where I have come to roam?"
 "It's not a house," said Judas Priest,
 "It's not a house . . . it's a home."
 
 Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled,
 He soon lost all control
 Over ev'rything which he had made
 While the mission bells did toll.
 He just stood there staring
 At that big house as bright as any sun,
 With four and twenty windows
 And a woman's face in ev'ry one.
 
 Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee
 With a soulful, bounding leap,
 And, foaming at the mouth,
 He began to make his midnight creep.
 For sixteen nights and days he raved,
 But on the seventeenth he burst
 Into the arms of Judas Priest,
 Which is where he died of thirst.
 
 No one tried to say a thing
 When they took him out in jest,
 Except, of course, the little neighbor boy
 Who carried him to rest.
 And he just walked along, alone,
 With his guilt so well concealed,
 And muttered underneath his breath,
 "Nothing is revealed."
 
 Well, the moral of the story,
 The moral of this song,
 Is simply that one should never be
 Where one does not belong.
 So when you see your neighbor carryin' somethin',
 Help him with his load,
 And don't go mistaking Paradise
 For that home across the road.
   

 BALLAD OF A THIN MAN
                                       
 You walk into the room
 With your pencil in your hand
 You see somebody naked
 And you say, "Who is that man?"
 You try so hard
 But you don't understand
 Just what you'll say
 When you get home
 
 Because something is happening here
 But you don't know what it is
 Do you, Mister Jones?
 
 You raise up your head
 And you ask, "Is this where it is?"
 And somebody points to you and says
 "It's his"
 And you say, "What's mine?"
 And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
 And you say, "Oh my God
 Am I here all alone?"
 
 Because something is happening here
 But you don't know what it is
 Do you, Mister Jones?
 
 You hand in your ticket
 And you go watch the geek
 Who immediately walks up to you
 When he hears you speak
 And says, "How does it feel
 To be such a freak?"
 And you say, "Impossible"
 As he hands you a bone
 
 Because something is happening here
 But you don't know what it is
 Do you, Mister Jones?
 
 You have many contacts
 Among the lumberjacks
 To get you facts
 When someone attacks your imagination
 But nobody has any respect
 Anyway they already expect you
 To just give a check
 To tax-deductible charity organizations
 
 You've been with the professors
 And they've all liked your looks
 With great lawyers you have
 Discussed lepers and crooks
 You've been through all of
 F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
 You're very well read
 It's well known
 
 Because something is happening here
 But you don't know what it is
 Do you, Mister Jones?
 
 Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you
 And then he kneels
 He crosses himself
 And then he clicks his high heels
 And without further notice
 He asks you how it feels
 And he says, "Here is your throat back
 Thanks for the loan"
 
 Because something is happening here
 But you don't know what it is
 Do you, Mister Jones?
 
 Now you see this one-eyed midget
 Shouting the word "NOW"
 And you say, "For what reason?"
 And he says, "How?"
 And you say, "What does this mean?"
 And he screams back, "You're a cow
 Give me some milk
 Or else go home"
 
 Because something is happening here
 But you don't know what it is
 Do you, Mister Jones?
 
 Well, you walk into the room
 Like a camel and then you frown
 You put your eyes in your pocket
 And your nose on the ground
 There ought to be a law
 Against you comin' around
 You should be made
 To wear earphones
 
 Because something is happening here
 But you don't know what it is
 Do you, Mister Jones?

 One evenin' for pleasure
 I rappled with you
 In the fair fields all alone
 Down by the banks of Loche Erin
 Where the beauty and pleasure were known
 I spied a fair maiden and her neighbor
 Which caused me to stay for awhile
 And I thooght of her goddes of beauty
 Bloomin' bright star of Brighte Isle
 
 l humbled myself to her beauty
 Fair maiden where do you belong
 Are you from heaven descended
 Abiding cupid's bare throne
 Young man I will teII you a secret
 It's true l'm a maid that's poor
 And to part from my vows and my promise
 'Tis more than my heert can endure
 Therefore I remain at my service
 And go through with my hardship and toil
 And wait for the lad that has left me
 All alone on the banks of Belle Isle
 
 Young maiden I wish not to banter
 'Tis true I come here in disguise
 l came here to fulfill my last promise
 And hope to give you a surprise
 l know you're a maid I Iove dearly
 And you've been in my heart all the while
 For me there is no other damsell

 BILLY
                                       
 There's guns across the river aimin' at ya
 Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch ya
 Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get ya
 Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
 
 Campin' out all night on the veranda
 Dealin' cards 'til dawn in the hacienda
 Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send ya
 Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
 
 Playin' around with some sweet seorita
 Into her dark hallway she will lead ya
 In some lonesome shadows she will greet ya
 Billy, you're so far away from home.

 There's eyes behind the mirrors in empty places
 Bullet holes and scars between the spaces
 There's always one more notch and ten more paces
 Billy, and you're walkin' all alone.

 They say that Pat Garrett's got your number
 So sleep with one eye open when you slumber
 Every little sound just might be thunder
 Thunder from the barrel of his gun.

 Guitars will play your grand finale
 Down in some Tularosa alley,
 Maybe in the Rio Pecos valley
 Billy, you're so far away from home.

 There's always some new stranger sneakin' glances
 Some trigger-happy fool willin' to take chances
 And some old whore from San Pedro to make advances
 Advances on your spirit and your soul.

 The businessmen from Taos want you to go down
 They've hired Pat Garrett to force a showdown.
 Billy, don't it make ya feel so low-down
 To be shot down by the man who was your friend?

 Hang on to your woman if you got one
 Remember in El Paso, once, you shot one.
 She may have been a whore, but she was a hot one
 Billy, you been runnin' for so long.
 
 Guitars will play your grand finale
 Down in some Tularosa alley
 Maybe in the Rio Pecos valley
 Billy, you're so far away from home.

 Listenin' to the billboard knock.
 Standin' at the side road

 Well, my wrist was empty
 But my nerves were kickin',
 Tickin' like a clock.

 If I got anything you need, babe,
 Let me tell you in front.
 If I got anything you need, babe,
 Let me tell you in front.
 You can come to me sometime,
 Night time, day time,
 Any time you want.

 Sometimes I'm thinkin'

 Though it's funny, honey,
 I just don't feel much like a

 BLACK DIAMOND BAY
                                       
 Up on the white veranda
 She wears a necktie and a Panama hat.
 Her passport shows a face
 From another time and place
 She looks nothin' like that.
 And all the remnants of her recent past
 Are scattered in the wild wind.
 She walks across the marble floor
 Where a voice from the gambling room is callin' her to come on in.
 She smiles, walks the other way
 As the last ship sails and the moon fades away
 From Black Diamond Bay.

 As the mornin' light breaks open, the Greek comes down
 And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write.
 "Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says,
 Carefully removes his fez,
 "Am I hearin' you right?"
 And as the yellow fog is liftin'
 The Greek is quickly headin' for the second floor.
 She passes him on the spiral staircase
 Thinkin' he's the Soviet Ambassador,
 She starts to speak, but he walks away
 As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway
 On Black Diamond Bay.
 
 A soldier sits beneath the fan
 Doin' business with a tiny man who sells him a ring.
 Lightning strikes, the lights blow out.
 The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout,
 "Can you see anything?"
 Then the Greek appears on the second floor
 In his bare feet with a rope around his neck,
 While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle,
 Says, "Open up another deck."
 But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plalt,''
 As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
 From Black Diamond Bay.
 
 The desk clerk heard the woman laugh
 As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough.
 He tried to grab the woman's hand,
 Said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand."
 She said, "That ain't enough."
 Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags
 While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb.
 She passed the door that the Greek had locked,
 Where a handwritten sign read, "Do Not Disturb."
 She knocked upon it anyway
 As the sun went down and the music did play
 On Black Diamond Bay.
 
 "I've got to talk to someone quick!"
 But the Greek said, "Go away," and he kicked the chair to the floor.
 He hung there from the chandelier.
 She cried, "Help, there's danger near
 Please open up the door!"
 Then the volcano erupted
 And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above.
 The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner
 Thinking of forbidden love.
 But the desk clerk said, "It happens every day,"
 As the stars fell down and the fields burned away
 On Black Diamond Bay.
 
 As the island slowly sank
 The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
 The dealer said, "It's too late now.
 You can take your money, but I don't know how
 You'll spend it in the tomb."
 The tiny man bit the soldier's ear
 As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
 While she's out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her,
 "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
 She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
 As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
 From Black Diamond Bay.

 I was sittin' home alone one night in L.A.,
 Watchin' old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news.
 It seems there was an earthquake that
 Left nothin' but a Panama hat
 And a pair of old Greek shoes.
 Didn't seem like much was happenin',
 So I turned it off and went to grab another beer.
 Seems like every time you turn around
 There's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
 And there's really nothin' anyone can say
 And I never did plan to go anyway
 To Black Diamond Bay.
   

 BLACKJACK DAVEY
                                       
 Blackjack Davey come a-ridin' on back,
 A-whistlin' loud and merry.
 Made the woods around him ring,
 And he charmed the heart of a lady,
 Charmed the heart of a lady.

 "How old are you, my pretty little miss,
 How old are you, my honey?"
 She answered to him with a lovin' smile
 "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
 Be sixteen come Sunday."

 "Come and go with me, my pretty little miss,
 Come and go with me, my honey.
 Take you where the grass grows green,
 You never will want for money,
 You never will want for money.
 
 "Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes
 All made of Spanish leather.
 Get behind me on my horse
 And we'll ride off together,
 We'll both go off together."
 
 Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes
 Made of Spanish leather.
 Got behind him on his horse
 And they rode off together,
 They both rode off together.
 
 At night the boss came home
 Inquiring about his lady.
 His servant spoke before she thought,
 "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
 Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
 
 "Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud,
 He's speedier than the gray.
 I rode all day and I'll ride all night,
 And I'll overtake my lady,
 I'll bring back my lady."
 
 Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight,
 Till he came to a river ragin',
 And there he spied his darlin' bride
 In the arms of Blackjack Davey,
 Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
 
 "Pull off, pull off them long blue gloves
 All made of the finest leather.
 Give to me your lily-white hand
 And we'll both go home together,
 We'll both go home together."
 
 Well, she pulled off them long blue gloves
 All made of the finest leather,
 Gave to him her lily-white hand
 And said good-bye forever.
 Bid farewell forever.
 
 "Would you forsake your house and home,
 Would you forsake your baby?
 Would you forsake your husband, too,
 To go with Blackjack Davey,
 Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"

 "Well, I'll forsake my house and home,
 And I'll forsake my baby.
 I'll forsake my husband, too,
 For the love of Blackjack Davey,
 Love my Blackjack Davey."

 "Last night I slept in a feather bed
 Between my husband and baby.
 Tonight I lay on the river banks
 In the arms of Blackjack Davey,
 Love my Blackjack Davey."
   

 BLIND WILLIE MCTELL
                                       
 Seen the arrow on the doorpost
 Saying, "This land is condemned
 All the way from New Orleans
 To Jerusalem."
 I traveled through East Texas
 Where many martyrs fell
 And I know no one can sing the blues
 Like Blind Willie McTell

 Well, I heard the hoot owl singing
 As they were taking down the tents
 The stars above the barren trees
 Were his only audience
 Them charcoal gypsy maidens
 Can strut their feathers well
 But nobody can sing the blues
 Like Blind Willie McTell
 
 See them big plantations burning
 Hear the cracking of the whips
 Smell that sweet magnolia blooming
 (And) see the ghosts of slavery ships
 I can hear them tribes a-moaning
 (I can) hear the undertaker's bell
 (Yeah), nobody can sing the blues
 Like Blind Willie McTell
 
 There's a woman by the river
 With some fine young handsome man
 He's dressed up like a squire
 Bootlegged whiskey in his hand
 There's a chain gang on the highway
 I can hear them rebels yell
 And I know no one can sing the blues
 Like Blind Willie McTell

 Well, God is in heaven
 And we all want what's his
 But power and greed and corruptible seed
 Seem to be all that there is
 I'm gazing out the window
 Of the St. James Hotel
 And I know no one can sing the blues
 Like Blind Willie McTell
   

 BLOOD IN MY EYES
                                       
 Woke up this morning, feeling blue,
 Seen a good-lookin' girl, can I make love with you?
 Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
 Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you.
 I got blood in my eyes for you, babe,
 I don't care what in the world you do.
 
 I went back home, put on my tie,
 Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
 Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
 Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you.
 I got blood in my eyes for you, babe,
 I don't care what in the world you do.
 
 She looked at me, begin to smile,
 Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
 No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you.
 No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you.
 Got blood in my eyes for you, babe,
 I don't care what in the world you do.

 No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
 You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
 Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
 Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you.
 I got blood in my eyes for you, babe,
 I don't care what in the world you do.
 
 I tell you something, tell you the facts,
 You don't want me, give my money back.
 Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
 Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you.
 I got blood in my eyes for you, babe,
 I don't care what in the world you do.
   

 BLOWIN' IN THE WIND
                                       
 How many roads must a man walk down
 Before you call him a man?
 Yes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail
 Before she sleeps in the sand?
 Yes, 'n' how many times must the cannon balls fly
 Before they're forever banned?
 The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,
 The answer is blowin' in the wind.
 
 How many times must a man look up
 Before he can see the sky?
 Yes, 'n' how many ears must one man have
 Before he can hear people cry?
 Yes, 'n' how many deaths will it take till he knows
 That too many people have died?
 The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,
 The answer is blowin' in the wind.
 
 How many years can a mountain exist
 Before it's washed to the sea?
 Yes, 'n' how many years can some people exist
 Before they're allowed to be free?
 Yes, 'n' how many times can a man turn his head,
 Pretending he just doesn't see?
 The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,
 The answer is blowin' in the wind.
   

 BOB DYLAN'S 115TH DREAM
                                       
 I was riding on the Mayflower
 When I thought I spied some land
 I yelled for Captain Arab
 I have yuh understand
 Who came running to the deck
 Said, "Boys, forget the whale
 Look on over yonder
 Cut the engines
 Change the sail
 Haul on the bowline"
 We sang that melody
 Like all tough sailors do
 When they are far away at sea
 
 "I think I'll call it America"
 I said as we hit land
 I took a deep breath
 I fell down, I could not stand
 Captain Arab he started
 Writing up some deeds
 He said, "Let's set up a fort
 And start buying the place with beads"
 Just then this cop comes down the street
 Crazy as a loon
 He throw us all in jail
 For carryin' harpoons
 
 Ah me I busted out
 Don't even ask me how
 I went to get some help
 I walked by a Guernsey cow
 Who directed me down
 To the Bowery slums
 Where people carried signs around
 Saying, "Ban the bums"
 I jumped right into line
 Sayin', "I hope that I'm not late"
 When I realized I hadn't eaten
 For five days straight
 
 I went into a restaurant
 Lookin' for the cook
 I told them I was the editor
 Of a famous etiquette book
 The waitress he was handsome
 He wore a powder blue cape
 I ordered some suzette, I said
 "Could you please make that crepe"
 Just then the whole kitchen exploded
 From boilin' fat
 Food was flying everywhere
 And I left without my hat
 
 Now, I didn't mean to be nosy
 But I went into a bank
 To get some bail for Arab
 And all the boys back in the tank
 They asked me for some collateral
 And I pulled down my pants
 They threw me in the alley
 When up comes this girl from France
 Who invited me to her house
 I went, but she had a friend
 Who knocked me out
 And robbed my boots
 And I was on the street again
 
 Well, I rapped upon a house
 With the U.S. flag upon display
 I said, "Could you help me out
 I got some friends down the way"
 The man says, "Get out of here
 I'll tear you limb from limb"
 I said, "You know they refused Jesus, too"
 He said, "You're not Him
 Get out of here before I break your bones
 I ain't your pop"
 I decided to have him arrested
 And I went looking for a cop
 
 I ran right outside
 And I hopped inside a cab
 I went out the other door
 This Englishman said, "Fab"
 As he saw me leap a hot dog stand
 And a chariot that stood
 Parked across from a building
 Advertising brotherhood
 I ran right through the front door
 Like a hobo sailor does
 But it was just a funeral parlor
 And the man asked me who I was
 
 I repeated that my friends
 Were all in jail, with a sigh
 He gave me his card
 He said, "Call me if they die"
 I shook his hand and said goodbye
 Ran out to the street
 When a bowling ball came down the road
 And knocked me off my feet
 A pay phone was ringing
 It just about blew my mind
 When I picked it up and said hello
 This foot came through the line
 
 Well, by this time I was fed up
 At tryin' to make a stab
 At bringin' back any help
 For my friends and Captain Arab
 I decided to flip a coin
 Like either heads or tails
 Would let me know if I should go
 Back to ship or back to jail
 So I hocked my sailor suit
 And I got a coin to flip
 It came up tails
 It rhymed with sails
 So I made it back to the ship
 
 Well, I got back and took
 The parkin' ticket off the mast
 I was ripping it to shreds
 When this coastguard boat went past
 They asked me my name
 And I said, "Captain Kidd"
 They believed me but
 They wanted to know
 What exactly that I did
 I said for the Pope of Eruke
 I was employed
 They let me go right away
 They were very paranoid
 
 Well, the last I heard of Arab
 He was stuck on a whale
 That was married to the deputy
 Sheriff of the jail
 But the funniest thing was
 When I was leavin' the bay
 I saw three ships a-sailin'
 They were all heading my way
 I asked the captain what his name was
 And how come he didn't drive a truck
 He said his name was Columbus
 I just said, "Good luck."
   

 BOB DYLAN'S BLUES
                                       
 Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto
 They are ridin' down the line
 Fixin' ev'rybody's troubles
 Ev'rybody's 'cept mine
 Somebody musta tol' 'em
 That I was doin' fine
 
 Oh you five and ten cent women
 With nothin' in your heads
 I got a real gal I'm lovin'
 And Lord I'll love her till I'm dead
 Go away from my door and my window too
 Right now
 
 Lord, I ain't goin' down to no race track
 See no sports car run
 I don't have no sports car
 And I don't even care to have one
 I can walk anytime around the block
 
 Well, the wind keeps a-blowin' me
 Up and down the street
 With my hat in my hand
 And my boots on my feet
 Watch out so you don't step on me
 
 Well, lookit here buddy
 You want to be like me
 Pull out your six-shooter
 And rob every bank you can see
 Tell the judge I said it was all right
 Yes!


 BOB DYLAN'S DREAM
                                       
 While riding on a train goin' west,
 I fell asleep for to take my rest.
 I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
 Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.

 With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
 Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
 Where we together weathered many a storm,
 Laughin' and singin' till the early hours of the morn.

 By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
 Our words were told, our songs were sung,
 Where we longed for nothin' and were quite satisfied
 Talkin' and a-jokin' about the world outside.

 With haunted hearts through the heat and cold,
 We never thought we could ever get old.
 We thought we could sit forever in fun
 But our chances really was a million to one.

 As easy it was to tell black from white,
 It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
 And our choices were few and the thought never hit
 That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.

 How many a year has passed and gone,
 And many a gamble has been lost and won,
 And many a road taken by many a friend,
 And each one I've never seen again.

 I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,
 That we could sit simply in that room again.
 Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
 I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.


 BOB DYLAN'S NEW ORLEANS RAG
                                       
 I was sittin' on a stump
 Down in New Orleans,
 I was feelin' kinda low down,
 Dirty and mean.
 Along came a fella
 And he didn't even ask.
 He says, "I know of a woman
 That can fix you up fast."
 I didn't think twice,
 I said like I should,
 "Let's go find this lady
 That can do me some good."
 We walked across the river
 On a sailin' spree
 And we came to a door
 Called one-oh-three.
 
 I was just about ready
 To give it a little knock
 When out comes a fella
 Who couldn't even walk.
 He's linkin' and a-slinkin',
 Couldn't stand on his feet,
 And he moaned and he groaned
 And he shuffled down the street.
 Well, out of the door
 There comes another man.
 He wiggled and he wobbled,
 He couldn't hardly stand.
 He had this frightened
 Look in his eyes,
 Like he just fought a bear,
 He was ready to die.
 
 Well, I peeked through the key crack,
 Comin' down the hall
 Was a long-legged man
 Who couldn't hardly crawl.
 He muttered and he uttered
 In broken French,
 And he looked like he'd been through
 A monkey wrench.
 
 Well, by this time
 I was a-scared to knock,
 I was a-scared to move,
 I's in a state of shock.
 I hummed a little tune
 And I shuffled my feet
 And I started walkin' backwards
 Down that broad street.
 Well, I got to the corner,
 I tried my best to smile.
 I turned around the corner
 And I ran a bloody mile.
 Man, I wasn't runnin'
 'Cause I was sick,
 I was just a-runnin'
 To get out of there quick.
 
 Well, I tripped right along
 And I'm a-wheezin' in my chest.
 I musta run a mile
 In a minute or less.
 I walked on a log
 And I tripped on a stump,
 I caught a fast freight
 With a one-arm jump.
 So, if you're travelin' down
 Louisiana way,
 And you feel kinda lonesome
 And you need a place to stay,
 Man, you're better off
 In your misery
 Than to tackle that lady
 At one-oh-three.
   

 BOOTS OF SPANISH LEATHER
                                       
 Oh, I'm sailin' away my own true love,
 I'm sailin' away in the morning.
 Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
 From the place that I'll be landing?
 
 No, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love,
 There's nothin' I wish to be ownin'.
 Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled,
 From across that lonesome ocean.

 Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine
 Made of silver or of golden,
 Either from the mountains of Madrid
 Or from the coast of Barcelona.
 
 Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night
 And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
 I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss,
 For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin'.
 
 That I might be gone a long time
 And it's only that I'm askin',
 Is there something I can send you to remember me by,
 To make your time more easy passin'.
 
 Oh, how can, how can you ask me again,
 It only brings me sorrow.
 The same thing I want from you today,
 I would want again tomorrow.
 
 I got a letter on a lonesome day,
 It was from her ship a-sailin',
 Saying I don't know when I'll be comin' back again,
 It depends on how I'm a-feelin'.

 Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way,
 I'm sure your mind is roamin'.
 I'm sure your heart is not with me,
 But with the country to where you're goin'.

 So take heed, take heed of the western wind,
 Take heed of the stormy weather.
 And yes, there's something you can send back to me,
 Spanish boots of Spanish leather.
   

 BORN IN TIME
                                       
 In the lonely night
 In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light
 You're comin' thru to me in black and white
 When we were made of dreams.

 You're blowing down the shaky street,
 You're hearing my heart beat
 In the record breaking heat
 Where we were born in time.

 Not one more night, not one more kiss,
 Not this time baby, no more of this.
 Takes too much skill, takes too much will.
 It's revealing.
 You came, you saw, just like the law
 You married young, just like your ma,
 You tried and tried, you made me slide
 You left me reelin' with this feelin'.

 On the rising curve
 Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
 You won't get anything you don't deserve
 Where we were born in time.
 
 You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
 You hang the flame, you'll pay the price.
 Oh babe, that fire
 Is still smokin'.
 You were snow, you were rain
 You were striped, you were plain,
 Oh babe, truer words
 Have not been spoken or broken.

 In the hills of mystery,
 In the foggy web of destiny,
 You can have what's left of me,
 Where we were born in time.
   

 BROKE DOWN ENGINE
                                       
 Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drivin' wheel,
 Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drivin' wheel.
 You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.

 Been shooting craps and gambling, momma, and I done got broke,
 Been shooting craps and gambling, momma, and I done got broke.
 I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been sold.

 Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lord,
 Lordy, Lord.
 
 I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knees,
 I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knees.
 I ain't cryin' for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.

 If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
 Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more.
 Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.

 Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lord,
 Lordy, Lord.
 
 Can't you hear me, baby, rappin' on your door?
 Can't you hear me, baby, rappin' on your door?
 Now you hear me tappin', tappin' across your floor.

 Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
 Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all.
 What make me love my woman, she can really do the Georgia Crawl.

 Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
 Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell.
 If you're a real hot momma, come take away Daddy's weeping spell.
   

 BROWNSVILLE GIRL
                                       
 Well, there was this movie I seen one time,
 About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
 He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
 The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.

 Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
 as the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath.
 Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square,
 I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death.

 Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
 And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
 You know I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart.
 The memory of you keeps callin' after me like a rollin' train.

 I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert
 In your busted down Ford and your platform heels
 I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet
 Ah, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.

 Well, we drove that car all nigh into San Anton'
 And we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and soft.
 Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
 I would have gone on after you but I didn't feel like letting my head get
     blown off.

 Well, we're drivin' this car and the sun is comin' up over the Rockies,
 Now I know she ain't you but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in
     her soul.
 But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore to remember the
     times when I was your only man
 And she don't want to remind me.  She knows this car would go out of
     control.

 Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like
     the moon above
 Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my
     honey love.

 Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo
 We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live.  He owned a wreckin' lot
     outside of town about a mile.
 Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back.
     She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
 She said, "Henry ain't here but you can come on in, he'll be back in a
     little while."

 Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin' of
     bummin' a ride back to where she started.
 But ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up.
 She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead."  You could tell she was
     so broken-hearted.
 She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."

 "How far are y'all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
 "We're going all the way 'til the wheels fall off and burn,
 'Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin
     dies."
 Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."

 Something about that movie though, well I just can't get it out of my head
 But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
 All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved
 And a lot of them seemed to be lookin' my way.

 Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like
     the moon above
 Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my
     honey love.

 Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour.
 I was crossin' the street when shots rang out.
 I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
 "We got him cornered in the churchyard," I heard somebody shout.

 Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune.  Underneath it, it
     said, "A man with no alibi."
 You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
 Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
 It was the best acting I saw anybody do.

 Now I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass but
     sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
 Oh if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now.
 You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't sayin' much.  I could feel a
     whole lot better,
 If you were just here by my side to show me how.

 Well, I'm standin' in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
 Yeah, but you know it's not the one that I had in mind.
 He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about
 But I'll see him in anything so I'll stand in line.

 Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like
     the moon above
 Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my
     honey love.

 You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
 The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name wasn't
     Henry Porter.
 And you know there was somethin' about you baby that I liked that was always
     too good for this world
 Just like you always said there was something about me you liked that I left
     behind in the French Quarter.

 Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people
     who are most content.
 I don't have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
 You always said people don't do what they believe in, they just do what's
     most convenient, then they repent.
 And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays
     on."

 There was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice.
 I don't remember who I was or where I was bound.
 All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun and he
     was shot in the back.
 Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.

 Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like
     the moon above
 Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my
     honey love.
   

 BUCKETS OF RAIN
                                       
 Buckets of rain
 Buckets of tears
 Got all them buckets comin' out of my ears.
 Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
 I got all the love, honey baby,
 You can stand.
 
 I been meek
 And hard like an oak
 I seen pretty people disappear like smoke.
 Friends will arrive, friends will disappear,
 If you want me, honey baby,
 I'll be here.

 Like your smile
 And your fingertips
 Like the way that you move your lips.
 I like the cool way you look at me,
 Everything about you is bringing me
 Misery.

 Little red wagon
 Little red bike
 I ain't no monkey but I know what I like.
 I like the way you love me strong and slow,
 I'm takin' you with me, honey baby,
 When I go.

 Life is sad
 Life is a bust
 All ya can do is do what you must.
 You do what you must do and ya do it well,
 I'll do it for you, honey baby,
 Can't you tell?
   

 CALIFORNIA
                                       
 I'm goin' down south,
 'Neath the borderline.
 I'm goin' down south,
 'Neath the borderline.
 Some fat momma
 Kissed my mouth one time.

 Well, I needed it this morning
 Without a shadow of doubt.
 My suitcase is packed,
 My clothes are hangin' out.

 San Francisco's fine,
 You sure get lots of sun.
 San Francisco is fine.
 You sure get lots of sun.
 But I'm used to four seasons,
 California's got but one.

 Well, I got my dark sunglasses,
 I got for good luck my black tooth.
 I got my dark sunglasses,
 And for good luck I got my black tooth.
 Don't ask me nothin' about nothin',
 I just might tell you the truth.
   

 CALL LETTER BLUES
                                       
 Well, I walked all night long
 Listenin' to them church bells tone
 Yes, I walked all night long
 Listenin' to them church bells tone
 Either someone needing mercy
 Or maybe something I've done wrong

 Well, your friends come by for you
 I don't know what to say
 Well, your friends come by for you
 I don't know what to say
 I just can't face up to tell Ôem
 Honey, you just went away
 
 Well, children cry for mother
 I tell them, "Mother took a trip"
 Well, children cry for mother
 I tell them, "Mother took a trip"
 Well, I walk on pins and needles
 I hope my tongue don't slip
 
 Well, I gaze at passing strangers
 In case I might see you
 Yes,  I gaze at passing strangers
 In case I might see you
 But the sun goes around the heavens
 And another day just drives on through

 Way out in the distance
 I know you're with some other man
 Way out in the distance
 I know you're with some other man
 But that's alright, baby
 You know I always understand

 Call girls in the doorway
 All giving me the eye
 Call girls in the doorway
 All giving me the eye
 But my heart's just not in it
 I might as well pass right on by
 
 My ears are ringin'
 Ringin' like empty shells
 My ears are ringin'
 Ringin' like empty shells
 Well, it can't be no guitar player
 It must be convent bells
   

 CANADEE-I-O
                                       
 Well, it's all of  fair and handsome girl,
 She's all in her tender years.
 She fell in love with a sailor boy,
 It's true she loved him well.
 For to go off to sea with him
 Like she did not know how,
 She longed to see that seaport town
 Of Canadee-i-o.

 So she bargained with the sailor boy,
 All for a piece of gold,
 Straightaway then he led her
 Down into the hold,
 Sayin', "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes,
 Your jacket shall be blue.
 You'll see that seaport town
 Of Canadee-i-o.Ó
 
 Now, when the other sailors heard the news,
 Well, they fell into a rage,
 And with all the ship's company
 They were willing to engage,
 Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys,
 Overboard we'll throw her.
 She'll never see that seaport town
 Called Canadee-i-o.

 Now, when the captain he heard the news,
 Well, he too fell in a rage,
 And with the whole ship's company
 He was willing to engage,
 Sayin', "She'll stay in sailor's clothes,
 Her color shall be blue,
 She'll see that seaport town
 Call Canadee-i-o.
 
 Now, when they come down to Canada,
 Scarcely 'bout half a year,
 She's married this bold captain
 Who called her his dear.
 She's dressed in silks and satins now,
 She cuts a gallant show,
 Finest of the ladies
 Down Canadee-i-o.
 
 Come, all you fair and tender girls,
 Wheresoever you may be,
 I'd have you to follow your own true love
 Whene'er he goes to sea.
 For if the sailors prove false to you,
 Well, the captain, he might prove true.
 You'll see the honor I have gained
 By the wearing of the blue.
   

 CAN'T WAIT

 I can't wait
 Wait for you to change my mind
 It's late
 I'm tryin' to walk the line
 Well it's way past midnight
 And there's some people all around
 Some on their way up
 Some on their way down
 The air burns and I'm tryin to think straight
 And I don't know how much longer I can wait
 
 I'm your man
 I've tried to recover the sweet love that we knew
 You understand
 That my heart can't go on beating without you
 Well your loveliness has wounded me
 I'm reeling from the blow
 I wish I knew what it was that keeps me loving you so
 I'm breathin' hard standin' at the gate
 And I don't know how much longer I can wait

 Skies are gray
 I'm looking for anything that will bring a happy glow
 Night or day
 It doesn't matter where I go anymore I just go
 If I ever saw you comin' I don't know what I might do
 I'd like to think I could control myself
 But it isn't true
 That's how it is
 When things disintegrate
 And I don't know how much longer I can wait

 I'm doomed to love you
 I been rollin' through stormy weather
 I'm thinkin' of you
 And all the places we could roam together
 It's mighty funny
 The end of time has just begun
 Oh honey, after all these years you're still the one
 Well I'm strollin' through the lonely graveyard of my mind
 I left my life with you
 Somewhere back there along the line
 I thought somehow that I would be spared this day
 I don't know how much longer I can wait
   

 CARIBBEAN WIND
                                       
 She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost
 From the city of seven hills near the place of the cross.
 I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
 Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
 She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
 By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
 
 Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
 Did we snap at the bait, did we follow a star
 Through the hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
 Could I been used and played as a pawn?
 It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
 When men bathed in perfume and practiced the hoax of free speech.

 And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
 Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
 And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
 Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
 
 Sea breeze blowin', there's a hellhound loose,
 Arabian men who have escaped from the noose,
 Preaching faith and salvation, waiting for the night to arise.
 He was well connected but her heart was a snare
 And she had left him to die in there,
 He was goin' down slow, just barely staying alive.

 The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
 Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
 Street band playing "Nearer My God to Thee."
 We met at the steeple where the mission bells ring,
 She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
 You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."

 And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
 Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
 And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
 Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.

 Atlantic City by the cold grey sea
 I hear a voice crying "Daddy," I always think it's for me,
 But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
 Every new messenger brings evil report
 'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
 And famines and earthquakes and train wrecks and the tearin' down of the
     walls.

 Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
 Did you ever meet your accusers face to face in the rain?
 She had lone brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
 I see the screws breaking loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
 I see a house in the country being torn from within.
 I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.

 And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
 Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
 And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
 Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
   

 CATFISH
                                       
 Lazy stadium night
 Catfish on the mound.
 "Strike three," the umpire said,
 Batter have to go back and sit down.

 Catfish, million-dollar-man,
 Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
 
 Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm
 But the old man wouldn't pay
 So he packed his glove and took his arm
 An' one day he just ran away.
  
 Catfish, million-dollar-man,
 Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
 
 Come up where the Yankees are,
 Dress up in a pinstripe suit,
 Smoke a custom-made cigar,
 Wear an alligator boot.

 Catfish, million-dollar-man,
 Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
 
 Carolina born and bred,
 Love to hunt the little quail.
 Got a hundred-acre spread,
 Got some huntin' dogs for sale.

 Catfish, million-dollar-man,
 Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
 
 Reggie Jackson at the plate
 Seein' nothin' but the curve,
 Swing too early or too late
 Got to eat what Catfish serve.

 Catfish, million-dollar-man,
 Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
 
 Even Billy Martin grins
 When the Fish is in the game.
 Every season twenty wins
 Gonna make the Hall of Fame.

 Catfish, million-dollar-man,
 Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
   

 CAT'S IN THE WELL
                                       
 The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down.
 The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down.
 He got his big bushy tail dragging all over the ground.

 The cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep.
 Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep.
 She ain't hearing a thing, the silence is a-stickin' her deep.

 The cat's in the well and grief is showing its face
 The world's being slaughtered and it's such a bloody disgrace.
 
 The cat's in the well, the horse is going bumpety bump.
 The cat's in the well, and the horse is going bumpety bump.
 Back alley Sally is doing the American jump.

 The cat's in the well, and pappa is reading the news.
 His hairÕs falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
 
 The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull
 The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull
 The night is so long and the table is oh, so full

 The cat's in the well and the servant is at the door.
 The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
 
 The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall
 The cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall
 Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
   

 CAN YOU PLEASE CRAWL OUT YOUR WINDOW?
                                       
 He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks
 Preoccupied with his vengeance
 Cursing the dead that can't answer him back
 I'm sure that he has no intentions
 Of looking your way, unless it's to say
 That he needs you to test his inventions.

 Can you please crawl out your window?
 Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
 How can you say he will haunt you?
 You can go back to him any time you want to.

 He looks so truthful, is this how he feels
 Trying to peel the moon and expose it
 With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
 If he needs a third eye he just grows it
 He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
 Or pick it up after he throws it.

 Can you please crawl out your window?
 Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
 How can you say he will haunt you?
 You can go back to him any time you want to.
 
 Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
 Are you frightened of the box you keep him in
 While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
 Their religion of the little ten women
 That backs up their views but your face is so bruised
 Come on out the dark is beginning.

 Can you please crawl out your window?
 Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
 How can you say he will haunt you?
 You can go back to him any time you want to.
   

 COVER DOWN, BREAK THROUGH
                                       
 You heard about Pharaoh's army
 Tramplin' through the mud
 You heard about the Hebrew children
 Redeemed by blood
 Same spirit dwellin' in you
 That raised Christ from the dead
 You can quicken your mortal body
 Then let it run to your head

 You've got to cover down, cover down, break through
 Cover down, (cover down, break through)
 
 May need protection
 By the armour of the Lord
 The sword of God is sharper
 Than any double sided sword
 (He's the hammer of salvation)
 (The blade of righteousness)
 (Genesis to revelation)
 (Repent and confess)
 
 Cover down, cover down, break through
 Cover down, (cover down, break through)
 
 Well, you wake up early in the mornin'
 Turnin' from a-side to side
 Somethin' givin' you a warning
 You can run but you can't hide
 Demands are laid upon you
 And burdens a-you can't bear
 Sins you can't even remember
 I waited to meet you there
 
 You've got to cover down, cover down, break through
 Cover down, cover down, break through
 
 You've got an image of yourself
 You've built by yourself alone
 But it will come a-tumblin' down
 Just like the walls are made of stone
 You will be separated
 From everything you seem to be
 You think you'll be liberated
 Yeah, but the grave won't set you free
 
 You've got to cover down, cover down, break through
 Cover down, cover down, break through
 
 (Cover down, cover down, break through)
 (Cover down, cover down, break through)

 (Cover down, break through)
 (Cover down, oh Lord, cover down, break through)
   

 CHANGING OF THE GUARDS
                                       
 Sixteen years,
 Sixteen banners united over the field
 Where the good shepherd grieves.
 Desperate men, desperate women divided,
 Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves.

 Fortune calls.
 I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace,
 Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down.
 She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born,
 On midsummer's eve, near the tower.

 The cold-blooded moon.
 The captain waits above the celebration
 Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid
 Whose ebony face is beyond communication.
 The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.

 They shaved her head.
 She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo.
 A messenger arrived with a black nightingale.
 I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow,
 Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.

 I stumbled to my feet.
 I rode past destruction in the ditches
 With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo.
 Renegade priests and treacherous young witches
 Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
 
 The palace of mirrors
 Where dog soldiers are reflected,
 The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
 The empty rooms where her memory is protected,
 Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.

 She wakes him up
 Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
 Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks.
 She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking.
 He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks.
 
 Gentlemen, he said,
 I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes,
 I've moved your mountains and marked your cards
 But Eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination
 Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.

 Peace will come
 With tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire
 But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall
 And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating
 Between the King and the Queen of Swords.
   

 CHIMES OF FREEDOM
                                       
 Far between sundown's finish an' midnight's broken toll
 We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing
 As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
 Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing
 Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
 Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
 An' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night
 An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
 
 In the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
 With faces hidden while the walls were tightening
 As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain
 Dissolved into the bells of the lightning
 Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake
 Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsaked
 Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake
 An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

 Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
 The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder
 That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
 Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder
 Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
 Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
 An' the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful time
 An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

 Through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
 For the disrobed faceless forms of no position
 Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
 All down in taken-for-granted situations
 Tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute
 Tolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute
 For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an' cheated by pursuit
 An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

 Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flashed
 An' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
 Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
 Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
 Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
 For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
 An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
 An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

 Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught
 Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
 As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look
 Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended
 Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed
 For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse
 An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
 An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
   

 CLEAN-CUT KID
                                       
 Everybody wants to know why he couldn't adjust
 Adjust to what, a dream that bust?
 
 He was a clean-cut kid
 But they made a killer out of him,
 That's what they did
 
 They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is
 They put ideas in his head he thought were his
 
 He was a clean-cut kid
 But they made a killer out of him,
 That's what they did
 
 He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band
 When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand
 
 He was a clean-cut kid
 But they made a killer out of him,
 That's what they did
 
 He went to church on Sunday, he was a Boy Scout
 For his friends he would turn his pockets inside out
 
 He was a clean-cut kid
 But they made a killer out of him,
 That's what they did
 
 They said, "Listen boy, you're just a pup"
 They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up
 
 They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
 A jeep to drive, blood to spill
 
 They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes"
 They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes
 
 He was a clean-cut kid
 But they made a killer out of him,
 That's what they did

 He bought the American dream but it put him in debt
 The only game he could play was Russian roulette
 
 He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
 Ate Burger Kings, he was well fed
 
 He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole
 He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool
 
 They took a clean-cut kid
 And they made a killer out of him,
 That's what they did
 
 He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar
 Could've been an accountant or a tennis star
 
 He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day
 Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay

 His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans
 They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own
 
 They took a clean-cut kid
 And they made a killer out of him,
 That's what they did
 
 Well, everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust
 All he ever wanted was somebody to trust
 
 They took his head and turned it inside out
 He never did know what it was all about

 He had a steady job, he joined the choir
 He never did plan to walk the high wire

 They took a clean-cut kid
 And they made a killer out of him,
 That's what they did
   

 CLOTHES LINE SAGA
                                       
 After a while we took in the clothes,
 Nobody said very much.
 Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants
 Which nobody really wanted to touch.
 Mama come in and picked up a book
 An' Papa asked her what it was.
 Someone else asked, "What do you care?"
 Papa said, "Well, just because."
 Then they started to take back their clothes,
 Hang 'em on the line.
 It was January the thirtieth
 And everybody was feelin' fine.
 
 The next day everybody got up
 Seein' if the clothes were dry.
 The dogs were barking, a neighbor passed,
 Mama, of course, she said, "Hi!"
 "Have you heard the news?" he said, with a grin,
 "The Vice-President's gone mad!"
 "Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night."
 "Hmm, say, that's too bad!"
 "Well, there's nothin' we can do about it," said the neighbor,
 "It's just somethin' we're gonna have to forget."
 "Yes, I guess so," said Ma,
 Then she asked me if the clothes was still wet.
 
 I reached up, touched my shirt,
 And the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
 I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em."
 He said, "Ya always help out around here with the chores?"
 I said, "Sometime, not all the time."
 Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
 Just as papa yelled outside,
 "Mama wants you t' come back in the house and bring them clothes."
 Well, I just do what I'm told,
 So, I did it, of course.
 I went back in the house and Mama met me
 And then I shut all the doors.
   

 COLD IRONS BOUND
                                       
 I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around
 Now I'm all used up and the fields have turned brown
 I went to church on Sunday and she passed by
 And my love for her is taking such a long time to die
 God I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist
 It's almost like, almost like I don't exist
 I'm 20 miles out of town, Cold Irons bound
 
 There's a wall of pride high and wide,
 Can't see over to the other side
 It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
 It's sadder still to feel your heart turn away
 One look at you and I'm out of control
 like the universe has swallowed me whole
 I'm 20 miles out of town and Cold Irons bound
 
 There's too many people, too many to recall
 I thought some of 'em were friends of mine
 I was wrong about 'em all
 Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud
 Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood
 I found my own, I found my one in you
 But your love just hasn't proved true
 I'm 20 miles out of town, Cold Irons bound
 20 miles out of town, Cold Irons bound
 
 Now the winds in Chicago have turned me to shreds
 The RT has always had too many heads
 Some things last longer than you think they will
 Some kind of things you can never kill
 It's you and you only I'm thinking about
 But you can't see in, and it's hard looking out
 I'm 20 miles out of town, Cold Irons bound
 
 Well the fat's in the fire, and the water's in the tank
 And the whiskey's in the jar, and the money's in the bank
 I tried to love and protect you because I cared
 I'm gonna remember forever the joy we've shared
 But looking at you and I'm on my bended knee
 You have no idea what you do to me
 I'm 20 miles out of town Cold Irons bound
 20 miles out of town, Cold Irons bound
   

 COMING FROM THE HEART
 (The Road Is Long)
                                       
 We have got to come together
 How long can we stay apart?
 You may get it maybe never
 But it's coming from the heart.

 Your life is full of indecision
 You can't make up your mind.
 We must get it in position
 And move it on down the line.

 'Cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb
 I been on that road too long of a time
 Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds
 When I think of the love that I left behind.
 
 Make me up a bed of roses
 And hang them down from the vine
 Of all my loves you've been the closest
 That's ever been on my mind.

 Please don't talk about tomorrow
 I'm really not one to care
 This world is filled with too much sorrow
 That nobody's heart should bear.

 'Cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb
 I been on that road too long of a time
 Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds
 When I think of the love that I left behind.

 Please, please give me indication
 Stop and talk to me
 Like a river that is flowing
 My love will never cease to be.

 You will always be my honey
 No one could take your part
 Our love can't be bought with money
 'Cause it's coming from the heart.

 'Cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb
 I been on that road too long of a time
 Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds
 When I think of the love that I left behind.
   

 CORRINA, CORRINA
                                       
 Corrina, Corrina,
 Gal, where you been so long?
 Corrina, Corrina,
 Gal, where you been so long?
 I been worr'in' 'bout you, baby,
 Baby, please come home.

 I got a bird that whistles,
 I got a bird that sings.
 I got a bird that whistles,
 I got a bird that sings.
 But I ain' a-got Corrina,
 Life don't mean a thing.

 Corrina, Corrina,
 Gal, you're on my mind.
 Corrina, Corrina,
 Gal, you're on my mind.
 I'm a-thinkin' 'bout you, baby,
 I just can't keep from crying.
   

 COUNTRY PIE
                                       
 Just like old Saxophone Joe
 When he's got the hogshead up on his toe
 Oh me, oh my
 Love that country pie

 Listen to the fiddler play
 When he's playin' 'til the break of day
 Oh me, oh my
 Love that country pie

 Raspberry, strawberry, lemon and lime
 What do I care?
 Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin and plum
 Call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there

 Saddle me up my big white goose
 Tie me on 'er and turn her loose
 Oh me, oh my
 Love that country pie

 I don't need much and that ain't no lie
 Ain't runnin' any race
 Give to me my country pie
 I won't throw it up in anybody's face

 Shake me up that old peach tree
 Little Jack Horner's got nothin' on me
 Oh me, oh my
 Love that country pie
   

 COVENANT WOMAN
                                       
 Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
 Way up yonder, great will be her reward.
 Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
 I know I can trust you to stay where you are.

 And I just got to tell you
 I do intend
 To stay closer than any friend.
 I just got to thank you
 Once again
 For making your prayers known
 Unto heaven for me
 And to you, always, so grateful
 I will forever be.

 I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup.
 I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up
 And I know He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
 He must have loved me so much to send me someone as fine as you.
 
 And I just got to tell you
 I do intend
 To stay closer than any friend.
 I just got to thank you
 Once again
 For making your prayers known
 Unto heaven for me
 And to you, always, so grateful
 I will forever be.

 Covenant woman, intimate little girl
 Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world.
 You know we are strangers in a land we're passing through.
 I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant too.
 
 And I just got to tell you
 I do intend
 To stay closer than any friend.
 I just got to thank you
 Once again
 For making your prayers known
 Unto heaven for me
 And to you, always, so grateful
 I will forever be.
   

 DARK EYES
                                       
 Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside,
 They're drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide.
 I live in another world where life and death are memorized,
 Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls and all I see are dark eyes.

 A cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer,
 Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere.
 But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise,
 Whom nature's beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes.

 They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes,
 They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I'm sure it is.
 But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized,
 All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes.

 Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel,
 Hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel.
 Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that
     flies,
 A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes.
   

 DAY OF THE LOCUSTS
                                       
 Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
 The birdies were flying from tree to tree.
 There was little to say, there was no conversation
 As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree.
 And the locusts sang off in the distance,
 Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.
 Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
 Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
 
 I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
 Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
 I was ready to leave, I was already walkin',
 But the next time I looked there was light in the room.
 And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
 Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.
 Oh, the locusts sang their high whining trill,
 Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
 
 Outside of the gates the trucks were unloadin',
 The weather was hot, a-nearly 90 degrees.
 The man standin' next to me, his head was exploding,
 Well, I was prayin' the pieces wouldn't fall on me.
 Yeah, the locusts sang off in the distance,
 Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.
 Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
 And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.

 I put down my robe, picked up my diploma,
 Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive,
 Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota,
 Sure was glad to get out of there alive.
 And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
 Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.
 And the locusts sang with a high whinin' trill,
 Yeah, the locusts sang and they was singing for me,
 Singing for me, well, singing for me.
   

 DEAD MAN, DEAD MAN
                                       
 Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
 Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
 Never bein' able to separate the good from the bad,
 Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
 It's makin' me feel so sad.

 Dead man, dead man,
 When will you arise?
 Cobwebs in your mind,
 Dust upon your eyes.

 Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
 Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
 The way that you hold your head, cursin' God with every move,
 Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
 What are you tryin' to prove?

 Dead man, dead man,
 When will you arise?
 Cobwebs in your mind,
 Dust upon your eyes.
 
 The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
 The ghetto that you build for me is the one you end up in,
 The race of the engine that overrules your heart,
 Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
 Pretending that you're so smart.

 Dead man, dead man,
 When will you arise?
 Cobwebs in your mind,
 Dust upon your eyes.
 
 What are you tryin' to overpower me with, the doctrine or the gun?
 My back is already to the wall, where can I run?
 The tuxedo that you're wearin', the flower in your lapel,
 Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
 You wanna take me down to hell.
 
 Dead man, dead man,
 When will you arise?
 Cobwebs in your mind,
 Dust upon your eyes.
   

 DEAR LANDLORD
                                       
 Dear landlord,
 Please don't put a price on my soul.
 My burden is heavy,
 My dreams are beyond control.
 When that steamboat whistle blows,
 I'm gonna give you all I got to give,
 And I do hope you receive it well,
 Dependin' on the way you feel that you live.
 
 Dear landlord,
 Please heed these words that I speak.
 I know you've suffered much,
 But in this you are not so unique.
 All of us, at times, we might work too hard
 To have it too fast and too much,
 And anyone can fill his life up
 With things he can see but he just cannot touch.
 
 Dear landlord,
 Please don't dismiss my case.
 I'm not about to argue,
 I'm not about to move to no other place.
 Now, each of us has his own special gift
 And you know this was meant to be true,
 And if you don't underestimate me,
 I won't underestimate you.
   

 THE DEATH OF EMMETT TILL
                                       
 "Twas down in Mississippi no so long ago,
 When a young boy from Chicago town stepped through a Southern door.
 This boy's dreadful tragedy I can still remember well,
 The color of his skin was black and his name was Emmett Till.

 Some men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up.
 They said they had a reason, but I can't remember what.
 They tortured him and did some evil things too evil to repeat.
 There was screaming sounds inside the barn, there was laughing sounds out on
     the street.

 Then they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a bloody red rain
 And they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain.
 The reason that they killed him there, and I'm sure it ain't no lie,
 Was just for the fun of killin' him and to watch him slowly die.

 And then to stop the United States of yelling for a trial,
 Two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor Emmett Till.
 But on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this awful
     crime,
 And so this trial was a mockery, but nobody seemed to mind.

 I saw the morning papers but I could not bear to see
 The smiling brothers walkin' down the courthouse stairs.
 For the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free,
 While Emmett's body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern sea.

 If you can't speak out against this kind of thing, a crime that's so unjust,
 Your eyes are filled with dead men's dirt, your mind is filled with dust.
 Your arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains, and your blood it
     must refuse to flow,
 For you let this human race fall down so God-awful low!

 This song is just a reminder to remind your fellow man
 That this kind of thing still lives today in that ghost-robed Ku Klux Klan.
 But if all of us folks that thinks alike, if we gave all we could give,
 We could make this great land of ours a greater place to live.
   

 DEATH IS NOT THE END
                                       
 When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend
 Just remember that death is not the end
 And all that you've held sacred, falls down and does not mend
 Just remember that death is no the end
 Not the end, not the end
 Just remember that death is not the end

 When you're standing at the crossroads that you cannot comprehend
 Just remember that death is not the end
 And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend
 Just remember that death is not the end
 Not the end, not the end
 Just remember that death is not the end

 When the storm clouds gather 'round you, and heavy rains descend
 Just remember that death is not the end
 And there's no one there to comfort you, with a helpin' hand to lend
 Just remember that death is not the end
 Not the end, not the end
 Just remember that death is not the end
 
 Oh, the tree of life is growing
 Where the spirit never dies
 And the bright light of salvation shines
 In dark and empty skies

 When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men
 Just remember that death is not the end
 And you search in vain to find just one law abiding citizen
 Just remember that death is not the end
 Not the end, not the end
 Just remember that death is not the end
   

 DELIA
                                       
 Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
 Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
 All the friends I ever had are gone.

 Delia's dear ol' mother took a trip out West.
 When she returned, little Delia gone to rest.
 All the friends I ever had are gone.

 Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's momma moaned.
 Wouldn't have been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
 All the friends I ever had are gone.

 Curtis' looking high, Curtis' looking low.
 He shot poor Delia down with a cruel forty-four.
 All the friends I ever had are gone.

 High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
 Looking for them rounders, looking out for me.
 All the friends I ever had are gone.

 Men in Atlanta, tryin' to pass for white,
 Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet out of sight.
 All the friends I ever had are gone.

 Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
 "All about them rounders, Judge, tryin' to cut me out."
 All the friends I ever had are gone.

 Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
 Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
 All the friends I ever had are gone.

 Curtis' in the jail house, drinking from an old tin cup.
 Delia's in the graveyard, she ain't gettin' up.
 All the friends I ever had are gone.

 Delia, oh Delia, how can it be?
 You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
 All the friends I ever had are gone.

 Delia, oh Delia, how can it be?
 You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
 All the friends I ever had are gone.
   

 DENISE
                                       
 Denise, Denise,
 Gal, what's on your mind?
 Denise, Denise,
 Gal, what's on your mind?
 You got your eyes closed,
 Heaven knows that you ain't blind.
 
 Well, I can see you smiling,
 But oh your mouth is inside out.
 I can see you smiling,
 But you're smiling inside out.
 Well, I know you're laughin'
 But what are you laughin' about.
 
 Well, if you're tryin' to throw me,
 Babe, I've already been tossed.
 If you're tryin' to throw me,
 Babe, I've already been tossed.
 Babe, you're tryin' to lose me.
 Babe, I'm already lost.
 
 Well, what are you doing,
 Are you flying or have you flipped?
 Oh, what are you doing,
 Are you flying or have you flipped?
 Well, you call my name
 And then say your tongue just slipped.
 
 Denise, Denise,
 You're concealed here on the shelf.
 Denise, Denise,
 You're concealed here on the shelf.
 I'm looking deep in your eyes, babe,
 And all I can see is myself.
   

 DESOLATION ROW
                                       
 They're selling postcards of the hanging
 They're painting the passports brown
 The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
 The circus is in town
 Here comes the blind commissioner
 They've got him in a trance
 One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
 The other is in his pants
 And the riot squad they're restless
 They need somewhere to go
 As Lady and I look out tonight
 From Desolation Row
 
 Cinderella, she seems so easy
 "It takes one to know one," she smiles
 And puts her hands in her back pockets
 Bette Davis style
 And in comes Romeo, he's moaning
 "You Belong to Me I Believe"
 And someone says," You're in the wrong place, my friend
 You better leave"
 And the only sound that's left
 After the ambulances go
 Is Cinderella sweeping up
 On Desolation Row
 
 Now the moon is almost hidden
 The stars are beginning to hide
 The fortunetelling lady
 Has even taken all her things inside
 All except for Cain and Abel
 And the hunchback of Notre Dame
 Everybody is making love
 Or else expecting rain
 And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing
 He's getting ready for the show
 He's going to the carnival tonight
 On Desolation Row
  
 Now Ophelia, she's 'neath the window
 For her I feel so afraid
 On her twenty-second birthday
 She already is an old maid
 
 To her, death is quite romantic
 She wears an iron vest
 Her profession's her religion
 Her sin is her lifelessness
 And though her eyes are fixed upon
 Noah's great rainbow
 She spends her time peeking
 Into Desolation Row
 
 Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
 With his memories in a trunk
 Passed this way an hour ago
 With his friend, a jealous monk
 He looked so immaculately frightful
 As he bummed a cigarette
 Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
 And reciting the alphabet
 Now you would not think to look at him
 But he was famous long ago
 For playing the electric violin
 On Desolation Row
 
 Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
 Inside of a leather cup
 But all his sexless patients
 They're trying to blow it up
 Now his nurse, some local loser
 She's in charge of the cyanide hole
 And she also keeps the cards that read
 "Have Mercy on His Soul"
 They all play on penny whistles
 You can hear them blow
 If you lean your head out far enough
 From Desolation Row
 
 Across the street they've nailed the curtains
 They're getting ready for the feast
 The Phantom of the Opera
 A perfect image of a priest
 They're spoonfeeding Casanova
 To get him to feel more assured
 Then they'll kill him with self-confidence
 After poisoning him with words
 
 And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls
 "Get Outa Here If You Don't Know
 Casanova is just being punished for going
 To Desolation Row"
 
 Now at midnight all the agents
 And the superhuman crew
 Come out and round up everyone
 That knows more than they do
 Then they bring them to the factory
 Where the heart-attack machine
 Is strapped across their shoulders
 And then the kerosene
 Is brought down from the castles
 By insurance men who go
 Check to see that nobody is escaping
 To Desolation Row
 
 Praise be to Nero's Neptune
 The Titanic sails at dawn
 And everybody's shouting
 "Which Side Are You On?"
 And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
 Fighting in the captain's tower
 While calypso singers laugh at them
 And fishermen hold flowers
 Between the windows of the sea
 Where lovely mermaids flow
 And nobody has to think too much
 About Desolation Row
 
 Yes, I received your letter yesterday
 (About the time the door knob broke)
 When you asked how I was doing
 Was that some kind of joke?
 All these people that you mention
 Yes, I know them, they're quite lame
 I had to rearrange their faces
 And give them all another name
 Right now I can't read too good
 Don't send me no more letters no
 Not unless you mail them
 From Desolation Row
   

 DIAMOND JOE
                                       
 Now there's a man you'll hear about
 Most anywhere you go,
 And his holdings are in Texas
 And his name is Diamond Joe.

 And he carries all his money
 In a diamond-studded jar.
 He never took much trouble
 With the process of the law.

 I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys,
 Did offer him my hand.
 He gave a string of horses
 So old they could not stand.
 
 And I nearly starved to death, boys,
 He did mistreat me so.
 And I never saved a dollar
 In the pay of Diamond Joe.
  
 Now his bread it was corn dodger
 And his meat you couldn't chaw.
 Nearly drove me crazy
 With the waggin' of his jaw.

 And the tellin' of his story,
 Mean to let you know
 That there never was a rounder
 That could lie like Diamond Joe.

 Now, I tried three times to quit him
 But he did argue so.
 I'm still punchin' cattle
 In the pay of Diamond Joe.

 And when I'm called up yonder
 And it's my time to go,
 Give my blankets to my buddies
 Give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
   

 DIGNITY
   
 Fat man lookin' in a blade of steel
 Thin man lookin' at his last meal
 Hollow man lookin' in a cottonfield
 For dignity
 
 Wise man lookin' in a blade of grass
 Young man lookin' in the shadows that pass
 Poor man lookin' through painted glass
 For dignity
 
 Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve
 Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
 I went into the city, went into the town
 Went into the land of the midnight sun
 
 Searchin' high, searchin' low
 Searchin' everywhere I know
 Askin' the cops wherever I go
 Have you seen dignity?
 
 Blind man breakin' out of a trance
 Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
 Hopin' to find one circumstance
 Of dignity
 
 I went to the wedding of Mary-lou
 She said "I don't want nobody see me talkin' to you"
 Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
 About dignity
 
 I went down where the vultures feed
 I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need
 Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
 Wasn't any difference to me
 
 Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
 House on fire, debts unpaid
 Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid
 Have you seen dignity?
 
 Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears
 In a crowded room full of covered up mirrors
 Lookin' into the lost forgotten years
 For dignity
 
 Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
 Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used
 He wanted money up front, said he was abused
 By dignity
 
 Footprints runnin' cross the silver sand
 Steps goin' down into tattoo land
 I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
 In the bordertowns of despair
 
 Got no place to fade, got no coat
 I'm on the rollin' river in a jerkin' boat
 Tryin' to read a note somebody wrote
 About dignity
 
 Sick man lookin' for the doctor's cure
 Lookin' at his hands for the lines that were
 And into every masterpiece of literature
 for dignity
 
 Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
 Combin' his hair back, his future looks thin
 Bites the bullet and he looks within
 For dignity
 
 Someone showed me  a picture and I just laughed
 Dignity never been photographed
 I went into the red, went into the black
 Into the valley of dry bone dreams
 
 So many roads, so much at stake
 So many dead ends, I'm at the edge of the lake
 Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take
 To find dignity
   

 DIRGE
                                      
 I hate myself for lovin' you and the weakness that it showed
 You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
 The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
 I hate myself for lovin' you and I'm glad the curtain fell.

 I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
 And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?
 I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
 That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.

 Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped,
 Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped.
 Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten 'til he's tame,
 All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.

 There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them,
 In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
 The crystal ball up on the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
 I've paid the price of solitude, but at last I'm out of debt.

 Can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
 'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees.
 We stared into each other's eyes 'til one of us would break,
 No use to apologize, what diff'rence would it make?

 So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine,
 The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
 Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
 I hate myself for lovin' you, but I should get over that.
   

 DIRT ROAD BLUES
                                       
 Gonna walk down that dirt road 'Til someone will let me ride
 Gonna walk down that dirt road 'Til someone will let me ride
 If I can't find my baby I'm gonna run away and hide

 Well, I been pacing round the room, hoping maybe she come back
 pacing round the room, hoping maybe she come back
 Well, I been praying for salvation
 Laying round in a one-room country shack

 Gonna walk down that dirt road, until my eyes begin to bleed
 Gonna walk down that dirt road, until my eyes begin to bleed
 'Til there's nothing left to see
 'Til the chains have been shattered and I been freed

 But I'm looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above
 looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above
 Rolling through the rain and hail
 Looking for the sunny side of love

 Gonna walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same
 Gonna walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same
 I keep on walking 'til I hear her holler out my name
   

 DISEASE OF CONCEIT
                                       
 There's a whole lot of people suffering tonight
 From the disease of conceit.
 Whole lot of people struggling tonight
 From the disease of conceit.
 Comes right down the highway,
 Straight down the line,
 Rips into your senses
 Through your body and your mind.
 Nothing about it that's sweet,
 The disease of conceit.
 
 There's a whole lot of hearts breaking tonight
 From the disease of conceit.
 Whole lot of hearts shaking tonight
 From the disease of conceit.
 Steps into your room,
 Eats your soul,
 Over your senses
 You have no control.
 Ain't nothing too discreet
 About of disease of conceit.
 
 There's a whole lot of people dying tonight
 From the disease of conceit.
 Whole lot of people crying tonight
 From the disease of conceit.
 Comes right out of nowhere,
 And you're down for the count
 From the outside world,
 The pressure will mount,
 Turn you into a piece of meat,
 The disease of conceit.

 Conceit is a disease
 That the doctors got no cure
 They've done a lot of research on it,
 But what it is, they're still not sure
 
 There's a whole lot of people in trouble tonight
 From the disease of conceit.
 Whole lot of people seeing double tonight
 From the disease of conceit.
 Give ya delusions of grandeur
 And a evil eye,
 Give you idea that
 You're too good to die,
 Then they bury you from your head to your feet
 From the disease of conceit.
   

 DON'T FALL APART ON ME TONIGHT
                                       
 Just a minute before you leave, girl,
 Just a minute before you touch the door.
 What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
 Do you think we can talk about it some more?
 You know, the streets are filled with vipers
 Who've lost all ray of hope,
 You know, it ain't even safe no more
 In the palace of the Pope.
 
 Don't fall apart on me tonight,
 I just don't think that I could handle it.
 Don't fall apart on me tonight,
 Yesterday's just a memory,
 Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be
 And I need you, yeah.

 Come over here from over there, girl,
 Sit down here. You can have my chair.
 I can't see us goin' anywhere, girl.
 The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
 I wish I'd have been a doctor,
 Maybe I'd have saved some life that had been lost,
 Maybe I'd have done some good in the world
 'Stead of burning every bridge I crossed.

 Don't fall apart on me tonight,
 I just don't think that I could handle it.
 Don't fall apart on me tonight,
 Yesterday's just a memory,
 Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be
 And I need you, oh, yeah.
 
 I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
 So you might not know exactly how I feel,
 But if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain top, girl,
 And build you a house made out of stainless steel.
 But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
 That's hanging in the Louvre,
 My throat start to tickle and my nose itches
 But I know that I can't move.

 Don't fall apart on me tonight,
 I just don't think that I could handle it.
 Don't fall apart on me tonight,
 Yesterday's gone but the past lives on,
 Tomorrow's just one step beyond
 And I need you, oh, yeah.

 Who are these people who are walking towards you?
 Do you know them or will there be a fight?
 With their humorless smiles so easy to see through,
 Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
 
 Do you remember St. James Street
 Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
 You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
 And laid his life on the line.
 
 Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
 No more booby traps and bombs,
 No more decadence and charm,
 No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
 No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms.
 What about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants?
 He looked so baffled and so bewildered
 When he played and we didn't dance.

 Don't fall apart on me tonight,
 I just don't think that I could handle it.
 Don't fall apart on me tonight,
 Yesterday's just a memory,
 Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be
 And I need you, yeah.
   

 DON'T THINK TWICE, IT'S ALL RIGHT
                                       
 It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
 It don't matter, anyhow
 An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
 If you don't know by now
 When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
 Look out your window and I'll be gone
 You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
 Don't think twice, it's all right
 
 It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
 That light I never knowed
 An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
 I'm on the dark side of the road
 Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
 To try and make me change my mind and stay
 We never did too much talkin' anyway
 So don't think twice, it's all right

 It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
 Like you never did before
 It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
 I can't hear you any more
 I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' all the way down the road
 I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
 I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
 But don't think twice, it's all right

 I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe
 Where I'm bound, I can't tell
 But goodbye's too good a word, gal
 So I'll just say fare thee well
 I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
 You could have done better but I don't mind
 You just kinda wasted my precious time
 But don't think twice, it's all right
   

 DON'T YA TELL HENRY
                                       
 Don't ya tell Henry,
 Apple's got your fly.

 I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
 A-lookin' around just to see who's born.
 I found a little chicken down on his knees,
 I went up and yelled to him,
 "Please, please, please!"
 He said, "Don't ya tell Henry,
 Don't ya tell Henry,
 Don't ya tell Henry,
 Apple's got your fly."

 I went down to the corner at a-half past ten,
 I's lookin' around, I wouldn't say when.
 I looked down low, I looked above,
 And who did I see but the one I love.
 She said, "Don't ya tell Henry,
 Don't ya tell Henry,
 Don't ya tell Henry,
 Apple's got your fly."

 Now, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
 A-lookin' around just to see myself.
 I spotted a horse and a donkey, too,
 I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
 They said, "Don't ya tell Henry,
 Don't ya tell Henry,
 Don't ya tell Henry,
 Apple's got your fly."

 Now, I went down to the pumphouse the other night,
 A-lookin' around, it was outa sight.
 I looked high and low for that big ol' tree,
 I did go upstairs but I didn't see nobody but me.
 I said, "Don't ya tell Henry,
 Don't ya tell Henry,
 Don't ya tell Henry,
 Apple's got your fly."

 DOWN THE HIGHWAY
                                       
 Well, I'm walkin' down the highway
 With my suitcase in my hand.
 Yes, I'm walkin' down the highway
 With my suitcase in my hand.
 Lord, I really miss my baby,
 She's in some far-off land.

 Well, your streets are gettin' empty,
 Lord, your highway's gettin' filled.
 And your streets are gettin' empty
 And your highway's gettin' filled.
 Well, the way I love that woman,
 I swear it's bound to get me killed.

 Well, I been gamblin' so long,
 Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
 Yes, I been gamblin' so long,
 Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
 Right now I'm havin' trouble,
 Please don't take away my highway shoes.

 Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
 Or I'm bound to die tryin'.
 Yes, I'm a-bound to get lucky, baby,
 Lord, Lord I'm a-bound to die tryin'.
 Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
 And we'll leave this ol' highway behind.

 Well, the ocean took my baby,
 My baby stole my heart from me.
 Yes, the ocean took my baby,
 My baby took my heart from me.
 She packed it all up in a suitcase,
 Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.

 So, I'm a-walkin' down your highway
 Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
 Yes, I'm a-walkin' down your highway
 Just as far as my eyes can see.
 From the Golden Gate Bridge
 All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
   

 DOWN ALONG THE COVE
                                       
 Down along the cove,
 I spied my true love comin' my way.
 Down along the cove,
 I spied my true love comin' my way.
 I say, "Lord, have mercy, mama,
 It sure is good to see you comin' today."
 
 Down along the cove,
 I spied my little bundle of joy.
 Down along the cove,
 I spied my little bundle of joy.
 She said, "Lord, have mercy, honey,
 I'm so glad you're my boy!"

 Down along the cove,
 We walked together hand in hand.
 Down along the cove,
 We walked together hand in hand.
 Ev'rybody watchin' us go by
 Knows we're in love, yes, and they understand.
   

 DOWN IN THE FLOOD
                                       
 Crash on the levee, mama,
 Water's gonna overflow,
 Swamp's gonna rise,
 No boat's gonna row.
 Now, you can train on down
 To Williams Point,
 You can bust your feet,
 You can rock this joint.
 But oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
 You're gonna have to find yourself
 Another best friend, somehow.
 
 Now, don't you try an' move me,
 You're just gonna lose.
 There's a crash on the levee
 And, mama, you've been refused.
 Well, it's sugar for sugar
 And salt for salt,
 If you go down in the flood,
 It's gonna be your own fault.
 Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
 You're gonna have to find yourself
 Another best friend, somehow.
 
 Well, that high tide's risin',
 Mama, don't you let me down.
 Pack up your suitcase,
 Mama, don't you make a sound.
 Now, it's king for king,
 Queen for queen,
 It's gonna be the meanest flood
 That anybody's seen.
 Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
 Yes, you're gonna have to find yourself
 Another best friend, somehow.
   

 DRIFTIN' TOO FAR FROM SHORE
                                       
 I didn't know that you'd be leavin'
 Or who you thought you were talkin' to.
 I figure maybe we're even
 Or maybe I'm one up on you.

 I send you all my money
 Just like I did before.
 I tried to reach you honey,
 But you're driftin' too far from shore.

 Driftin' too far from shore
 Driftin' too far from shore
 Driftin' too far from shore
 Driftin' too far from shore

 I ain't gonna get lost in this current,
 I don't like playing cat and mouse.
 No gentleman likes making love to a servant.
 Especially when he's in his father's house.

 I never could guess your weight, baby,
 Never needed to call you my whore.
 I always thought you were straight, baby,
 But you're driftin' too far from shore.

 Driftin' too far from shore
 Driftin' too far from shore
 Driftin' too far from shore
 Driftin' too far from shore

 Well these times and these tunnels are haunted,
 The bottom of the barrel is too.
 I waited years sometimes for what I wanted.
 Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
 
 Never no more do I wonder,
 Why you don't never play with me any more.
 At any moment you could go under,
 Cause you're driftin' too far from shore.
 
 Driftin' too far from shore
 Driftin' too far from shore
 Driftin' too far from shore
 Driftin' too far from shore
 
 You and me we had completeness,
 I give you all of what I could provide
 We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
 We were the wrong side.

 I've already ripped out the phones, honey.
 You can't walk the streets in a war.
 I can finish this alone, honey,
 You're driftin' too far from shore.
   

 DRIFTER'S ESCAPE
                                       
 "Oh, help me in my weakness,"
 I heard the drifter say,
 As they carried him from the courtroom
 And were taking him away.
 "My trip hasn't been a pleasant one
 And my time it isn't long,
 And I still do not know
 What it was that I've done wrong."
 
 Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside,
 A tear came to his eye,
 "You fail to understand," he said,
 "Why must you even try?"
 Outside, the crowd was stirring,
 You could hear it from the door.
 Inside, the judge was stepping down,
 While the jury cried for more.
 
 "Oh, stop that cursed jury,"
 Cried the attendant and the nurse,
 "The trial was bad enough,
 But this is ten times worse."
 Just then a bolt of lightning
 Struck the courthouse out of shape,
 And while ev'rybody knelt to pray
 The drifter did escape
    

 DUSTY OLD FAIRGROUNDS
                                       
 Well, it's all up from Florida at the start of the spring,
 The trucks and the trailers will be winding
 Like a bullet we'll shoot for the carnival route.
 We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.

 From the Michigan mud past the Wisconsin sun
 'Cross that Minnesota border, keep 'em scrambling
 Through the clear county lakes and the lumberjack lands,
 We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.

 Hit Fargo on the jump and down to Aberdeen
 'Cross them old Black Hills, keep 'em rolling
 Through the cow country towns and the sands of old Montana.
 We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.

 As the white line on the highway sails under your wheels,
 I've gazed from the trailer window laughing.
 Oh, our clothes they was torn but the colors they was bright.
 Following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.

 It's a-many a friend that follows the bend,
 The jugglers, the hustlers, the gamblers.
 Well, I've spent my time with the fortune-telling kind
 Following them fairgrounds a-calling.
 
 Oh, it's pound down the rails and it's tie down the tents,
 Get that canvas flag a-flying.
 Well, let the caterpillars spin, let the ferris wheel wind
 Following them fairgrounds a-calling.

 Well, it's roll into town straight to the fairgrounds
 Just behind the posters that are hanging
 And it's fill up every space with a different kind of face
 Following them fairgrounds a-calling.

 Get the dancing girls in front, get the gambling show behind,
 Hear that old music box a-banging.
 Hear them kids, faces, smiles, up and down the midway aisles
 We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.

 It's a-drag it on down by the deadline in the town,
 Hit the old highway by the morning
 And it's ride yourself blind for the next town on time
 Following them fairgrounds a-calling.

 As the harmonicas whined in the lonesome nighttime
 Drinking red wine as we're rolling,
 Many a turnin' I turn, many a lesson I learn
 From following them fairgrounds a-calling.

 And it's roll back down to St. Petersburg
 Tie down the trailers and camp 'em
 And the money that we made will pay for the space
 From following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.
   

 EMOTIONALLY YOURS
                                       
 Come baby, find me, come baby, remind me of where I once begun.
 Come baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
 I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors.
 But I will always be emotionally yours.

 Come baby, rock me, come baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart.
 Come baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start.
 I could be dreaming but I keep believing you're the one I'm livin' for.
 And I will always be emotionally yours.

 It's like my whole life never happened,
 When I see you, it's as if I never had a thought.
 I know this dream, it might be crazy,
 But it's the only one I've got.

 Come baby, shake me, come baby, take me, I would be satisfied.
 Come baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
 I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores.
 But I will always be emotionally yours.
   

 ETERNAL CIRCLE
                                       
 I sang the song slowly
 As she stood in the shadows
 She stepped to the light
 As my silver strings spun
 She called with her eyes
 To the tune I's a-playin'
 But the song it was long
 And I'd only begun
 
 Through a bullet of light
 Her face was reflectin'
 The fast fading words
 That rolled from my tongue
 With a long-distance look
 Her eyes was on fire
 But the song it was long
 And there was more to be sung.

 My eyes danced a circle
 Across her clear outline
 With her head tilted sideways
 She called me again
 As the tune drifted out
 She breathed hard through the echo
 But the song it was long
 And it was far to the end
 
 I glanced at my guitar
 And played it pretendin'
 That of all the eyes out there
 I could see none
 As her thoughts pounded hard
 Like the pierce of an arrow
 But the song it was long
 And it had to get done
 
 As the tune finally folded
 I laid down the guitar
 Then looked for the girl
 Who'd stayed for so long
 But her shadow was missin'
 For all of my searchin'
 So I picked up my guitar
 And began the next song
   

 EVERYTHING IS BROKEN
                                       
 Broken lines, broken strings,
 Broken threads, broken springs,
 Broken idols, broken heads,
 People sleeping in broken beds.
 Ain't no use jiving
 Ain't no use joking
 Everything is broken.
 
 Broken bottles, broken plates,
 Broken switches, broken gates,
 Broken dishes, broken parts,
 Streets are filled with broken hearts.
 Broken words never meant to be spoken,
 Everything is broken.
 
 Seem like every time you stop and turn around
 Something else just hit the ground
 
 Broken cutters, broken saws,
 Broken buckles, broken laws,
 Broken bodies, broken bones,
 Broken voices on broken phones.
 Take a deep breath, feel like you're chokin',
 Everything is broken.
 
 Every time you leave and go off someplace
 Things fall to pieces in my face
 
 Broken hands on broken ploughs,
 Broken treaties, broken vows,
 Broken pipes, broken tools,
 People bending broken rules.
 Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
 Everything is broken.
   

 EVERY GRAIN OF SAND
                                       
 In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need
 When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed
 There's a dyin' voice within me reaching out somewhere,
 Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.

 Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
 Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
 In the fury of the moment I can see the Master's hand
 In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.

 Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
 Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer.
 The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
 To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.

 I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
 And every time I pass that way I always hear my name.
 Then onward in my journey I come to understand
 That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.

 I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
 In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
 In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
 In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.

 I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
 Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
 I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
 Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
   

 FAREWELL
                                       
 Oh it's fare thee well my darlin' true,
 I'm leavin' in the first hour of the morn.
 I'm bound off for the bay of Mexico
 Or maybe the coast of Californ.
 So it's fare thee well my own true love,
 We'll meet another day, another time.
 It ain't the leavin'
 That's a-grievin' me
 But my true love who's bound to stay behind.

 Oh the weather is against me and the wind blows hard
 And the rain she's a-turnin' into hail.
 I still might strike it lucky on a highway goin' west,
 Though I'm travelin' on a path beaten trail.
 So it's fare thee well my own true love,
 We'll meet another day, another time.
 It ain't the leavin'
 That's a-grievin' me
 But my true love who's bound to stay behind.

 I will write you a letter from time to time,
 As I'm ramblin' you can travel with me too.
 With my head, my heart and my hands, my love,
 I will send what I learn back home to you.
 So it's fare thee well my own true love,
 We'll meet another day, another time.
 It ain't the leavin'
 That's a-grievin' me
 But my true love who's bound to stay behind.

 I will tell you of the laughter and of troubles,
 Be them somebody else's or my own.
 With my hands in my pockets and my coat collar high,
 I will travel unnoticed and unknown.
 So it's fare thee well my own true love,
 We'll meet another day, another time.
 It ain't the leavin'
 That's a-grievin' me
 But my true love who's bound to stay behind.
 
 I've heard tell of a town where I might as well be bound,
 It's down around the old Mexican plains.
 They say that the people are all friendly there
 And all they ask of you is your name.
 So it's fare thee well my own true love,
 We'll meet another day, another time.
 It ain't the leavin'
 That's a-grievin' me
 But my true love who's bound to stay behind.
   

 FAREWELL ANGELINA
                                       
 Farewell Angelina
 The bells of the crown
 Are being stolen by bandits
 I must follow the sound
 The triangle tingles
 And the trumpet play slow
 Farewell Angelina
 The sky is on fire
 And I must go.
 
 There's no need for anger
 There's no need for blame
 There's nothing to prove
 Ev'rything's still the same
 Just a table standing empty
 By the edge of the sea
 Farewell Angelina
 The sky is trembling
 And I must leave.
 
 The jacks and queens
 Have forsaked the courtyard
 Fifty-two gypsies
 Now file past the guards
 In the space where the deuce
 And the ace once ran wild
 Farewell Angelina
 The sky is folding
 I'll see you in a while.
 
 See the cross-eyed pirates sitting
 Perched in the sun
 Shooting tin cans
 With a sawed-off shotgun
 And the neighbors they clap
 And they cheer with each blast
 Farewell Angelina
 The sky's changing color
 And I must leave fast.
 
 King Kong, little elves
 On the rooftoops they dance
 Valentino-type tangos
 While the make-up man's hands
 Shut the eyes of the dead
 Not to embarrass anyone
 Farewell Angelina
 The sky is embarrassed
 And I must be gone.
 
 The machine guns are roaring
 The puppets heave rocks
 The fiends nail time bombs
 To the hands of the clocks
 Call me any name you like
 I will never deny it
 Farewell Angelina
 The sky is erupting
 I must go where it's quiet.
   

 FATHER OF NIGHT
                                       
 Father of night, Father of day,
 Father, who taketh the darkness away,
 Father, who teacheth the bird to fly,
 Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
 Father of loneliness and pain,
 Father of love and Father of rain.
 
 Father of day, Father of night,
 Father of black, Father of white,
 Father, who build the mountain so high,
 Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
 Father of time, Father of dreams,
 Father, who turneth the rivers and streams.
 
 Father of grain, Father of wheat,
 Father of cold and Father of heat,
 Father of air and Father of trees,
 Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
 Father of minutes, Father of days,
 Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
   

 FOOT OF PRIDE
                                       
 Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man
 So can a woman who passes herself off as a male
 They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer
 Preacher talking Ôbout Christ betrayed
 It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up
 He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground
 You know what they say  about bein' nice to the right people on the way up
 Sooner or later you gonna meet them comin' down

 Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
 Ain't no goin' back
 
 Hear ya got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names
 Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed
 He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine
 But he drinks, and drinks can be fixed
 Sing me one more song, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger
 And your fall by the sword love affair with Erroll Flynn
 in these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion
 Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.

 Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
 Ain't no goin' back
 
 There's a retired businessman named Red, cast down from heaven and he's out
     of his head
 He feeds off of everyone that he can touch
 He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash
 He's not somebody that you play around with much
 Miss Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is
 She'll do wondrous works with your fate
 Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in your bed
 If you don't mind sleepin' with your head face down in a grave.

 Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
 Ain't no goin' back
 
 Well they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight
 You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors
 How to enter into the gates of paradise
 No, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours
 Yeah, from the stage they'll be tryin' to get water outta rocks
 A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks
 They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study
     in
 Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks

 Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
 Ain't no goin' back

 They got some beautiful people out there, man
 They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue
 They got mystery written all over their forehead
 They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
 They don't believe in mercy
 Judgment on them is something that you'll never see
 They can exalt you up or bring you down main route
 Turn you into anything that they want you to be

 Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
 Ain't no goin' back
 
 Yes, I guess I loved him too
 I can still see him in my mind climbin' that hill
 Did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped
 Struck down by the strength of the will
 Ain't nothin' left here partner, just the dust of a plague that has left
     this whole town afraid
 From now on, this'll be where you're from
 Let the dead bury the dead. Your time will come
 Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade

 Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
 Ain't no goin' back
   

 FOREVER YOUNG                                       
   
 May God bless and keep you always,
 May your wishes all come true,
 May you always do for others
 And let others do for you.
 May you build a ladder to the stars
 And climb on every rung,
 May you stay forever young,
 Forever young, forever young,
 May you stay forever young.

 May you grow up to be righteous,
 May you grow up to be true,
 May you always know the truth
 And see the lights surrounding you.
 May you always be courageous,
 Stand upright and be strong,
 May you stay forever young,
 Forever young, forever young,
 May you stay forever young.
 
 May your hands always be busy,
 May your feet always be swift,
 May you have a strong foundation
 When the winds of changes shift.
 May your heart always be joyful,
 May your song always be sung,
 May you stay forever young,
 Forever young, forever young,
 May you stay forever young.
   

 FOURTH TIME AROUND
                                      
 When she said,
 "Don't waste your words, they're just lies,"
 I cried she was deaf.
 And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes,
 Then said, "What else you got left?"
 It was then that I got up to leave
 But she said, "Don't forget,
 Everybody must give something back
 For something they get."
 
 I stood there and hummed,
 I tapped on her drum and asked her how come.
 And she buttoned her boot,
 And straightened her suit,
 Then she said, "Don't get cute."
 So I forced my hands in my pockets
 And felt with my thumbs,
 And gallantly handed her
 My very last piece of gum.
 
 She threw me outside,
 I stood in the dirt where ev'ryone walked.
 And after finding I'd
 Forgotten my shirt,
 I went back and knocked.
 I waited in the hallway, she went to get it,
 And I tried to make sense
 Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
 That leaned up against . . .

 Her Jamaican rum
 And when she did come, I asked her for some.
 She said, "No, dear."
 I said, "Your words aren't clear,
 You'd better spit out your gum."
 She screamed till her face got so red,
  Then she fell on the floor,
 And I covered her up and then
 Thought I'd go look through her drawer.
 
 And when I was through,
 I filled up my shoe, and brought it to you.
 And you, you took me in,
 You loved me then,
 You never wasted time.
 And I, I never took much,
 I never asked for your crutch,
 Now don't ask for mine.

 FRANKIE & ALBERT
                                       
 Frankie was a good girl.
 Everybody knows.
 Paid one hundred dollars
 For Albert's new suit of clothes.
 He was her man but he done her wrong.

 Albert said, "I'm leaving you.
 Won't be gone for long.
 Don't wait up for me.
 A-worry about me when I'm gone."
 He was her man but he done her wrong.

 Frankie went down to the corner saloon.
 Get a bucket of beer.
 Said to the bartender.
 "Has my lovin' man been here?"
 He was her man but he done her wrong.

 "Well, I ain't gonna tell you no stories.
 I ain't gonna tell you no lies.
 I saw Albert an hour ago
 With a gal named Alice Bly."
 He was her man but he done her wrong.

 Frankie went down to 12th Street,
 Lookin' up through the window high.
 She saw her Albert there,
 Lovin' up Alice Bly.
 He was her man but he done her wrong.

 Frankie pulled out a pistol,
 Pulled out a forty-four.
 Gun went off a rootie-toot-toot
 And Albert fell on the floor.
 He was her man but he done her wrong.

 Frankie got down upon her knees,
 Took Albert into her lap.
 Started to hug and kiss him,
 But there was no bringin' him back.
 He was her man but he done her wrong.
 
 "Gimme a thousand policemen,
 Throw me into a cell.
 I shot my Albert dead,
 And now I'm goin' to hell.
 He was my man but he done me wrong."

 Judge said to the jury,
 "Plain as a thing can be,
 A woman shot her lover down,
 Murder in the second degree."
 He was her man but he done her wrong.

 Frankie went to the scaffold,
 Calm as a girl could be,
 Turned her eyes up towards the heavens,
 Said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
 He was her man but he done her wrong.
   

 FREIGHT TRAIN BLUES
                                       
 I was born in dixie in a boomer's shack,
 Just a little shanty by the railroad track
 Freight train was comin' I had to cry,
 Hummin all the drivers with my lullaby
 I've got the freight train blues (hee, hee, hoo)
 Oh, lawdy mama got 'em on the bottom of my ramblin' shoes

 And when the whistle blows, I gotta go
 Baby don't you know
 It looks like I'm never gonna lose
 The freight train blues.
 
 Well, my daddy was a fireman in a house out here
 She was the only daughter of the engineer
 Sweetheart of the brakeman, that ain't no joke
 It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
 I got the freight train blues (hee, hee, hoo)
 Oh, lawdy I got 'em in the bottom of my ramblin' shoes
 
 And when the whistle blows, I gotta go
 Oh mama don't you know
 It looks like I'm never gonna lose
 The freight train blues.
 
 Well, the only thing that makes you laugh again
 Is a south bound whistle on a south bound train
 Ev'ry place I want to go
 I never go because you know
 Because I got the freight train blues (hee, hee, hoo)
 Oh, lawdy mama, got 'em on the bottom of my ramblin' shoes
   

 FROM A BUICK 6
                                       
 I got this graveyard woman, you know she keeps my kid
 But my soulful mama, you know she keeps me hid
 She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread
 Well, if I go down dyin', you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.

 Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge
 I'm cracked up on the highway and on the water's edge
 She comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with thread
 Well, if I go down dyin', you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.

 Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much
 She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch
 She keeps this four-ten all loaded with lead
 Well, if I go down dyin', you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.

 Well, you know I need a steam shovel mama to keep away the dead
 I need a dump truck mama to unload my head
 She brings me everything and more, and just like I said
 Well, if I go down dyin', you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
   

 GATES OF EDEN
                                       
 Of war and peace the truth just twists
 Its curfew gull just glides
 Upon four-legged forest clouds
 The cowboy angel rides
 With his candle lit into the sun
 Though its glow is waxed in black
 All except when 'neath the trees of Eden

 The lamppost stands with folded arms
 Its iron claws attached
 To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail
 Though it shadows metal badge
 All and all can only fall
 With a crashing but meaningless blow
 No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden

 The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
 And then complains
 Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf
 But still remains
 Upon the beach where hound dogs bay
 At ships with tattooed sails
 Heading for the Gates of Eden

 With a time-rusted compass blade
 Aladdin and his lamp
 Sits with Utopian hermit monks
 Side saddle on the Golden Calf
 And on their promises of paradise
 You will not hear a laugh
 All except inside the Gates of Eden

 Relationships of ownership
 They whisper in the wings
 To those condemned to act accordingly
 And wait for succeeding kings
 And I try to harmonize with songs
 The lonesome sparrow sings
 There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden
 
 The motorcycle black madonna
 Two-wheeled gypsy queen
 And her silver-studded phantom cause
 The gray flannel dwarf to scream
 As he weeps to wicked birds of prey
 Who pick up on his bread crumb sins
 And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden
 
 The kingdoms of Experience
 In the precious wind they rot
 While paupers change possessions
 Each one wishing for what the other has got
 And the princess and the prince
 Discuss what's real and what is not
 It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden
 
 The foreign sun, it squints upon
 A bed that is never mine
 As friends and other strangers
 From their fates try to resign
 Leaving men wholly, totally free
 To do anything they wish to do but die
 And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden
 
 At dawn my lover comes to me
 And tells me of her dreams
 With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
 Into the ditch of what each one means
 At times I think there are no words
 But these to tell what's true
 And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden
   

 GEORGE JACKSON
                                       
 I woke up this mornin',
 There were tears in my bed.
 They killed a man I really loved
 Shot him through the head.
 Lord, Lord,
 They cut George Jackson down.
 Lord, Lord,
 They laid him in the ground.
 
 Sent him off to prison
 For a seventy-dollar robbery.
 Closed the door behind him
 And they threw away the key.
 Lord, Lord,
 They cut George Jackson down.
 Lord, Lord,
 They laid him in the ground.

 He wouldn't take shit from no one
 He wouldn't bow down or kneel.
 Authorities, they hated him
 Because he was just too real.
 Lord, Lord,
 They cut George Jackson down.
 Lord, Lord,
 They laid him in the ground.
 
 Prison guards, they cursed him
 As they watched him from above
 But they were frightened of his power
 They were scared of his love.
 Lord, Lord,
 So they cut George Jackson down.
 Lord, Lord,
 They laid him in the ground.
 
 Sometimes I think this whole world
 Is one big prison yard.
 Some of us are prisoners
 The rest of us are guards.
 Lord, Lord,
 They cut George Jackson down.
 Lord, Lord,
 They laid him in the ground.
   

 GET YOUR ROCKS OFF!
                                       
 You know, there's two ol' maids layin' in the bed,
 One picked herself up an' the other one, she said:
 "Get your rocks off!
 Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)
 Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)
 Get your rocks off-a me! (Get 'em off!)"
 
 Well, you know, there late one night up on Blueberry Hill,
 One man turned to the other man and said, with a blood-curdlin' chill, he
     said:
 "Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)
 Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)
 Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)
 Get your rocks off-a me! (Get 'em off!)"
 
 Well, you know, we was layin' down around Mink Muscle Creek,
 One man said to the other man, he began to speak, he said:
 "Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)
 Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)
 Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)
 Get your rocks off-a me! (Get 'em off!)"

 Well, you know, we was cruisin' down the highway in a Greyhound bus.
 All kinds-a children in the side road, they was hollerin' at us, sayin':
 "Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)
 Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)
 Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)
 Get your rocks off-a me!"


 GIRL OF THE NORTH COUNTRY
                                       
 Well, if you're travelin' in the north country fair,
 Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
 Remember me to one who lives there.
 She once was a true love of mine.

 Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm,
 When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
 Please see if she's wearing a coat so warm,
 To keep her from the howlin' winds.

 Please see for me if her hair hangs long,
 If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
 Please see for me if her hair hangs long,
 That's the way I remember her best.

 I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all.
 Many times I've often prayed
 In the darkness of my night,
 In the brightness of my day.

 So if you're travelin' in the north country fair,
 Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
 Remember me to one who lives there.
 She once was a true love of mine.
   

 GOD KNOWS
                                       
 God knows you ain't pretty,
 God knows it's true.
 God knows there ain't anybody
 Ever gonna take the place of you.

 God knows it's a struggle,
 God knows it's a crime,
 God knows there's gonna be no more water
 But fire next time.

 God donÕt call it treason,
 God donÕt call it wrong.
 It was supposed to last a season
 But it's been so strong for so long.

 God knows it's fragile,
 God knows everything,
 God knows it could snap apart right now
 Just like putting scissors to a string.
 
 God knows it's terrifying,
 God sees it all unfold,
 There's a million reasons for you to be crying
 You been so bold and so cold.
 
 God knows that when you see it,
 God knows you've got to weep,
 God knows the secrets of your heart,
 He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.

 God knows there's a river,
 God knows how to make it flow,
 God knows you ain't gonna be taking
 Nothing with you when you go.

 God knows there's a purpose,
 God knows there's a chance,
 God knows you can rise above the darkest hour
 Of any circumstance.

 God knows there's a heaven,
 God knows it's out of sight,
 God knows we can get all the way from here to there
 Even if we've got to walk a million miles by candlelight.
   

 GOIN' TO ACAPULCO
                                       
 I'm going down to Rose Marie's
 She never does me wrong.
 She puts it to me plain as day
 And gives it to me for a song.

 It's a wicked life but what the hell
 The stars ain't falling down.
 I'm standing outside the Taj Mahal
 I don't see no one around.

 Goin' to Acapulco
 Goin' on the run.
 Goin' down to see fat gut
 Goin' to have some fun.
 Yeah
 Goin' to have some fun.

 Now, whenever I get up
 And I ain't got what I see
 I just make it down to Rose Marie's
 'Bout a quarter after three.

 There are worse ways of getting there
 And I ain't complainin' none.
 If the clouds don't drop and the train don't stop
 I'm bound to meet the sun.

 Goin' to Acapulco
 Goin' on the run.
 Goin' down to see some girl
 Goin' to have some fun.
 Yeah
 Goin' to have some fun.

 Now, if someone offers me a joke
 I just say no thanks.
 I try to tell it like it is
 And keep away from pranks.
 
 Well, sometime you know when the well breaks down
 I just go pump on it some.
 Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
 And just set there waitin' for me to come.
 
 Goin' to Acapulco
 Goin' on the run.
 Goin' down to see some girl
 Goin' to have some fun.
 Yeah
 Goin' to have some fun.
   

 GOING, GOING, GONE
                                       
 I've just reached a place
 Where the willow don't bend.
 There's not much more to be said
 It's the top of the end.
 I'm going,
 I'm going,
 I'm gone.
 
 I'm closin' the book
 On the pages and the text
 And I don't really care
 What happens next.
 I'm just going,
 I'm going,
 I'm gone.
 
 I been hangin' on threads,
 I been playin' it straight,
 Now, I've just got to cut loose
 Before it gets late.
 So I'm going,
 I'm going,
 I'm gone.
 
 Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
 And you'll be fine at the end of the line.
 All that's gold isn't meant to shine.
 Don't you and your one true love ever part."
 
 I been walkin' the road,
 I been livin' on the edge,
 Now, I've just got to go
 Before I get to the ledge.
 So I'm going,
 I'm just going,
 I'm gone.
   

 GOLDEN LOOM
                                       
 Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
 I see the sailin' boats across the bay go by.
 Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
 And then I turn my head, for you're approachin' me.
 Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter, floatin' in to my room
 With a golden loom.

 First we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
 And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
 I see the hungry clouds up above your face
 And then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste.
 And then you drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
 With your golden loom.

 I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
 Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night.
 I see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail
 And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
 But you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
 And your golden loom.
   

 GONNA CHANGE MY WAY OF THINKING
                                       
 Gonna change my way of thinking,
 Make myself a different set of rules.
 Gonna change my way of thinking,
 Make myself a different set of rules.
 Gonna put my good foot forward,
 And stop being influenced by fools.
 
 So much oppression,
 Can't keep track of it no more.
 So much oppression,
 Can't keep track of it no more.
 Sons becoming husbands to their mothers,
 And old men turning young daughters into whores.
 
 Stripes on your shoulders,
 Stripes on your back and on your hands.
 Stripes on your shoulders,
 Stripes on your back and on your hands.
 Swords piercing your side,
 Blood and water flowing through the land.

 Well don't know which one is worse,
 Doing your own thing or just being cool.
 Well don't know which one is worse,
 Doing your own thing or just being cool.
 You remember only about the brass ring,
 You forget all about the golden rule.
 
 You can mislead a man,
 You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes.
 You can mislead a man,
 You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes.
 But there's only one authority,
 And that's the authority on high.
 
 I got a God-fearing woman,
 One I can easily afford.
 I got a God-fearing woman,
 One I can easily afford.
 She can do the Georgia crawl,
 She can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
 
 Jesus said, "Be ready,
 For you know not the hour in which I come."
 Jesus said, "Be ready,
 For you know not the hour in which I come."
 He said, "He who is not for Me is against Me,"
 Just so you know where He's coming from.
 
 There's a kingdom called Heaven,
 A place where there is no pain of birth.
 There's a kingdom called Heaven,
 A place where there is no pain of birth.
 Well the Lord created it, mister,
 About the same time He made the earth.
   

 GOSPEL PLOW

 There's nothin' you can say or do
 To make me think I'm wrong.

 Well, I'm goin' off to Libya,
 There's a guy I gotta see.
 He's been living there three years now,
 In an oil refinery.
 I've got my mind made up.
 Oh, I Ôve got my mind made up.

 Tell her her baby's on the line.
 Tell her not to worry
 Everything is gonna be fine.

 Look the other way.

 You may be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-sized bed
 
 But you're gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed
 You're gonna have to serve somebody,
 Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord
 But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
 
 You may call me Terry, you may call me Timmy,
 You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy,
 You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
 You may call me anything but no matter what you say
 
 You're gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed
 You're gonna have to serve somebody.
 Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord
 But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
   

 GO 'WAY LITTLE BOY
                                       
 Go 'way little boy
 I'm not for you
 Go back to her
 Where you'll be more secure
 She knows you better than I do
 Go 'way little boy
 I'm not for you
 
 Go 'way little boy
 You're making me sad
 I don't wanna to see you bleed
 She's the one that you need
 You'll never miss what you ain't never had
 Go 'way little boy
 You're making me sad
 
 Go 'way little boy
 It's much too late
 Walk back out the door
 Don't wanna see you here no more
 You're making it hard for me to concentrate
 Go 'way little boy
 It's much too late

 Can't you hear your mama callin'
 Don't you recognize her voice
 I think you'd better heed her warning
 While you still have the choice
 
 Go 'way little boy
 You're much too late
 Your future's lookin' bright
 Don't throw it away tonight
 It's getting hard for me to look you in the eye
 Go 'way little boy
 Can't you see that you're makin' me cry
   

 THE GROOM'S STILL WAITING AT THE ALTAR
                                       
 Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
 Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent
 Felt around for the light switch, became nauseated.
 She was walking down the hallway while the walls deteriorated.

 East of the Jordan, hard as the Rock of Gibraltar,
 I see the burning of the page,
 Curtain risin' on a new age,
 See the groom still waitin' at the altar.
 
 Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
 Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your shyness for snobbery,
 Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
 About the madness of becomin' what one was never meant to be.
 
 West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
 I see the burning of the stage,
 Curtain risin' on a new age,
 See the groom still waitin' at the altar.
 
 Don't know what I can say about Claudette that wouldn't come back to haunt
     me,
 Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she began to want me.
 But I know God has mercy on them who are slandered and humiliated.
 I'd a-done anything for that woman if she didn't make me feel so obligated.
 
 West of the Jordan, west of the Rock of Gibraltar,
 I see the burning of the cage,
 Curtain risin' on a new stage,
 See the groom still waitin' at the altar.
 
 Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
 I see people who are supposed to know better standin' around like furniture.
 There's a wall between you and what you want and you got to leap it,
 Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to
     keep it.

 West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
 I see the burning of the stage,
 Curtain risin' on a new age,
 See the groom still waitin' at the altar.
 
 Cities on fire, phones out of order,
 They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
 What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January,
 She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
 
 West of the Jordan, west of the Rock of Gibraltar,
 I see the burning of the stage,
 Curtain risin' on a new age,
 See the groom still waitin' at the altar.
   

 GUESS I'M DOIN' FINE
                                       
 Well, I ain't got my childhood
 Or friends I once did know.
 No, I ain't got my childhood
 Or friends I once did know.
 But I still got my voice left,
 I can take it anywhere I go.
 Hey, hey, so I guess I'm doin' fine.
 
 And I've never had much money
 But I'm still around somehow.
 No, I've never had much money
 But I'm still around somehow.
 Many times I've bended
 But I ain't never yet bowed.
 Hey, hey, so I guess I'm doin' fine.
 
 Trouble, oh trouble,
 I've trouble on my mind
 Trouble, oh trouble,
 Trouble on my mind.
 But the trouble in the world, Lord,
 Is much more bigger than mine.
 Hey, hey, so I guess I'm doin' fine.
 
 And I never had no armies
 To jump at my command.
 No, I ain't got no armies
 To jump at my command.
 But I don't need no armies,
 I got me one good friend.
 Hey, hey, so I guess I'm doin' fine.
 
 I been kicked and whipped and trampled on,
 I been shot at just like you.
 I been kicked and whipped and trampled on,
 I been shot at just like you.
 But as long as the world keeps a-turnin',
 I just keep a-turnin' too.
 Hey, hey, so I guess I'm doin' fine.

 Well, my road might be rocky,
 The stones might cut my face.
 My road it might be rocky,
 The stones might cut my face.
 But as some folks ain't got no road at all,
 They gotta stand in the same old place.
 Hey, hey, so I guess I'm doin' fine.
   

 GYPSY LOU
                                       
 If you getcha one girl, better get two

 She left one too many a boy behind
 He committed suicide.

 Gypsy Lou's gone again
   

 HAD A DREAM ABOUT YOU, BABY
                                       
 I got to see you baby, I don't care
 It may be someplace, baby, you say where.

 I had a dream about you, baby
 Had a dream about you, baby
 Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind
 
 You got the crazy rhythm when you walk
 You make me nervous when you start to talk
 
 I had a dream about you, baby
 Had a dream about you, baby
 Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind
 
 Standin' on the highway, you flag me down
 Said, take me daddy, to the nearest town
 
 I had a dream about you, baby
 Had a dream about you, baby
 Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind
 
 The joint is jumpin'
 It's really somethin'
 The beat is pumpin'
 My heart is thumpin'
 Spent my money on you honey
 My limbs are shakin'
 My heart is breakin'
 
 You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop
 You make me nervous, you gotta stop
 
 I had a dream about you, baby
 Had a dream about you, baby
 Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind
 
 You got a rag wrapped around your head
 Wearing a long dress fire engine red
 
 I had a dream about you, baby
 Had a dream about you, baby
 Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind
    

 HANDY DANDY
                                       
 Handy Dandy, controversy surrounds him
 He been around the world and back again
 Something in the moonlight still hounds him
 Handy Dandy, just like sugar and candy

 Handy Dandy, if every bone in his body was broken he would never admit it
 He got an all girl orchestra and when he says
 "Strike up the band", they hit it
 Handy Dandy, Handy Dandy

 You say, "What are ya made of?"
 He says, "Can you repeat what you said?"
 You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
 He'll say, "Nothin' neither 'live nor dead."

 Handy Dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money
 He says, "Darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
 She says, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
 Handy Dandy, Handy Dandy

 He's got that clear crystal fountain
 He's got that soft silky skin
 He's got that fortress on the mountain
 With no doors, no windows, no thieves can break in

 Handy Dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feelin' kind of
     lazy
 He says, "Ya want a gun?  I'll give you one."  She says, "Boy, you talking
     crazy."
 Handy Dandy, just like sugar and candy
 Handy Dandy, pour him another brandy
 
 Handy Dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full or sorrow
 He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table he says,
 "Okay, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
 Handy Dandy, Handy Dandy, just like sugar and candy
 Handy Dandy, just like sugar and candy
   

 A HARD RAIN'S A-GONNA FALL
                                       
 Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
 Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
 I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
 I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
 I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
 I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
 I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
 And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
 And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
 
 Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
 Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
 I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
 I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
 I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin',
 I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin',
 I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
 I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
 I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
 And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
 And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
 
 And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
 And what did you hear, my darling young one?
 I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin',
 Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
 Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin',
 Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin',
 Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin',
 Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
 Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
 And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
 And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
 
 Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
 Who did you meet, my darling young one?
 I met a young child beside a dead pony,
 I met a white man who walked a black dog,
 I met a young woman whose body was burning,
 I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow,
 I met one man who was wounded in love,
 I met another man who was wounded with hatred,
 And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
 It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
 
 Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
 Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?
 I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin',
 I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest,
 Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
 Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
 Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison,
 Where the executioner's face is always well hidden,
 Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten,
 Where black is the color, where none is the number,
 And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it,
 And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it,
 Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin',
 But I'll know my song well before I start singin',
 And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
 It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
   

 HARD TIMES
                                       
 Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
 While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
 There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
 Oh, hard times, come again no more.
 'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.
 Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
 Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.
 Oh, hard times, come again no more.
 
 While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay.
 There are frail forms fainting at the door.
 Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
 Oh, hard times, come again no more.
 'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.
 Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
 Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.
 Oh, hard times, come again no more.

 There's a pale drooping maiden who foils her life away
 With a worn out heart, whose better days are o'er.
 Though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
 Oh, hard times, come again no more.
 'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.
 Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
 Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.
 Oh, hard times, come again no more.
 
 'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.
 Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
 Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.
 Oh, hard times, come again no more.
   

 HARD TIMES IN NEW YORK TOWN
                                       
 Come you ladies and you gentlemen, a-listen to my song.
 Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong.
 Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
 "Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
 It's hard times in the city,
 Livin' down in New York town.
 
 Old New York City is a friendly old town,
 From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
 There's a-mighty many people all millin' all around,
 They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
 It's hard times in the city,
 Livin' down in New York town.
 
 It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
 To Rockefeller Plaza n' the Empire State.
 Mister Rockefeller sets up as high as a bird,
 Old Mister Empire never says a word.
 It's hard times from the country,
 Livin' down in New York town.
 
 Well, it's up in the mornin' tryin' to fins a job of work.
 Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
 If you go a lot o' money you can make yourself merry,
 If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
 And it's hard times in the city,
 Livin' down in New York town.
 
 Mister Hudson come a-sailin' down the stream
 And old Mister Minuet paid for his dream.
 Bought your city on a one-way track,
 'F I had my way I'd sell it right back.
 And it's hard times in the city,
 Livin' down in New York town.
 
 I'll take all the smog in Cal-i-for-ne-ay,
 ÔN' every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains,
 ÔN' the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines.
 It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
 And it's hard times in the city,
 Livin' down in New York town.
 
 So all you newsy people, spread the news around,
 You c'n listen to m' story, listen to m' song.
 You c'n step on my name, you c'n try 'n' get me beat,
 When I leave New York, I'll be standin' on my feet.
 And it's hard times in the city,
 Livin' down in New York town.
   

 HAZEL
                                       
 Hazel, dirty-blonde hair
 I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere.
 You got something I want plenty of
 Ooh, a little touch of your love.

 Hazel, stardust in your eye
 You're goin' somewhere and so am I.
 I'd give you the sky high above
 Ooh, for a little touch of your love.

 Oh no, I don't need any reminder
 To know how much I really care
 But it's just making me blinder and blinder
 Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
 
 Hazel, you called and I came,
 Now don't make me play this waiting game.
 You've got something I want plenty of
 Ooh, a little touch of your love.
   

 HEARTLAND
                                       
 There's a home place under fire tonight in the Heartland
 And the bankers are takin' my home and my land from me
 There's a big achin' hole in my chest now where my heart was
 And a hole in the sky where God used to be

 There's a home place under fire tonight in the Heartland
 There's a well with water so bitter nobody can drink
 Ain't no way to get high and my mouth is so dry that I can't speak
 Don't they know that I'm dyin', Why nobody cryin' for me?

 My American dream
 Fell apart at the seams.
 You tell me what it means,
 You tell me what it means.

 My American dream
 Fell apart at the seams.
 You tell me what it means,
 You tell me what it means.
   

 HEART OF MINE
                                       
 Heart of mine be still,
 You can play with fire but you'll get the bill.
 Don't let her know
 Don't let her know that you love her.
 Don't be a fool, don't be blind
 Heart of mine.
 
 Heart of mine go back home,
 You got no reason to wander, you got no reason to roam.
 Don't let her see
 Don't let her see that you need her.
 Don't put yourself over the line
 Heart of mine.
 
 Heart of mine go back where you been,
 It'll only be trouble for you if you let her in.
 Don't let her hear
 Don't let her hear you want her.
 Don't let her know she's so fine
 Heart of mine.
 
 Heart of mine you know that she'll never be true,
 She'll only give to others the love that she's gotten from you.
 Don't let her know
 Don't let her know where you're going.
 Don't untie the ties that bind
 Heart of mine.
 
 Heart of mine so malicious and so full of guile,
 Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
 Don't let yourself fall.
 Don't let yourself stumble.
 If you can't do the time, don't do the crime
 Heart of mine.
   

 YEA! HEAVY AND A BOTTLE OF BREAD
                                       
 Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus.
 The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
 On the very next day, with a nose full of pus.
 Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
 Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
 Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
 
 It's a one-track town, just brown, and a breeze, too,
 Pack up the meat, sweet, we're headin' out
 For Wichita in a pile of fruit.
 Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout
 Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout
 Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout
 
 Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle.
 Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it.
 Slap that drummer with a pie that smells.
 Take me down to California, baby
 Take me down to California, baby
 Take me down to California, baby
 
 Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus.
 The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
 On the very next day, with a nose full of pus.
 Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
 Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
 Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
   

 HERO BLUES
                                       
 Yes, the gal I got
 I swear she's the screaming end
 She wants me to be a hero
 So she can tell all her friends
 
 Well, she begged, she cried
 She pleaded with me all last night
 Well, she begged, she cried
 She pleaded with me all last night
 She wants me to go out
 And find somebody to fight
 
 She reads too many books
 She got new movies inside her head
 She reads too many books
 She got movies inside her head
 She wants me to walk out running
 She wants me to crawl back dead
 
 You need a different kinda man, babe
 One that can grab and hold your heart
 Need a different kind of man, babe
 One that can hold and grab your heart
 You need a different kind of man, babe
 You need Napoleon Boneeparte
 
 Well, when I'm dead
 No more good times will I crave
 When I'm dead
 No more good times will I crave
 You can stand and shout hero
 All over my lonesome grave
   

 HIGHLANDS
                                       
 Well my heart's in The Highlands, gentle and fair
 Honeysuckle blooming in the wildwood air
 Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow
 Well my heart's in The Highlands
 I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go

 Windows were shaking all night in my dreams
 Everything was exactly the way that it seems
 Woke up this mornin' and I looked at the same old page
 Same old rat race, life in the same old cage

 I don't want nothin' from anyone, ain't that much to take
 Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake
 Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery
 I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me

 Well my heart's in The Highlands wherever I roam
 That's where I'll be when I get called home
 The wind it whispers to the buckeye trees of rhyme
 Well my heart's in The Highlands
 I can only get there one step at a time

 I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound
 Someone's always yellin' "Turn it down"
 Feel like I'm driftin', driftin' from scene to scene
 I'm wonderin' what in the devil could it all possibly mean
 
 Insanity is smashin' up against my soul
 You could say I was on anything but a roll
 If I had a conscience, well I just might blow my top
 What would I do with it anyway, maybe take it to the pawn shop
 
 My heart's in The Highlands at the break of dawn
 By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan
 Big white clouds like chariots that swing down low
 Well my heart's in The Highlands only place left to go
 
 I'm in Boston town in some restaurant
 I got no idea what I want
 Or maybe I do but I'm just really not sure
 Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her

 Well it must be a holiday, there's nobody around
 She studies me closely as I sit down
 She got a pretty face and long white shiny legs
 I said "Tell me what I want"
 She say "You probably want hard boiled eggs"
 
 I said "That's right, bring me some"
 She says "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come"
 Then she says "I know you're an artist, draw a picture of me"
 I said "I would if I could but
 I don't do sketches from memory"

 Well she's?? near she says "I'm right here in front of you or haven't you
     looked"
 I say "All right I know but I don't have my drawin' book"
 She gives me a napkin, she say "You can do it on that"
 I say "Yes I could but I don't know where my pencil is at"
 
 She pulls one out from behind her ear
 She says "Alright now go ahead draw me I'm stayin' right here"
 I make a few lines and I show it for her to see
 Well she takes the napkin and throws it back and says
 "That don't look a thing like me"
 
 I said "Oh kind miss, it most certainly does"
 She say "You must be joking", I said "I wish I was"
 She says "You don't read women authors do ya?"
 At least that's what I think I hear her say
 Well I say "How would you know, and what would it matter anyway"
 
 Well she says "Ya just don't seem like ya do", I said "You're way wrong"
 She says "Which ones have you read then?", I say "Read Erica Jong"
 She goes away for a minute, and I slide out, out of my chair
 I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's goin' anywhere

 Well my heart's in The Highlands with the horses and hounds
 Way up in the border country far from the towns
 With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow
 My heart's in The Highlands, can't see any other way to go

 Every day is the same thing, out the door
 Feel further away than ever before
 Some things in life it just gets too late to learn
 Well I'm lost somewhere, I must have made a few bad turns

 I see people in the park, forgettin' their troubles and woes
 They're drinkin' and dancin', wearin' bright colored clothes
 All the young men with the young women lookin' so good
 Well I'd trade places with any of 'em, in a minute if I could

 I'm crossin' the street to get away from a mangy dog
 Talkin' to myself in a monologue
 I think what I need might be a full length leather coat
 Somebody just asked me if I'm registered to vote

 The sun is beginnin' to shine on me
 But it's not like the sun that used to be
 The party's over and there's less and less to say
 I got new eyes, everything looks far away

 Well my heart's in The Highlands at the break of day
 Over the hills and far away
 There's a way to get there, and I'll figure it out somehow
 Well I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now
   

 HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED
                                       
 Oh God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son"
 Abe says, "Man, you must be puttin' me on"
 God say, "No." Abe say, "What?"
 God say, "You can do what you want Abe, but
 The next time you see me comin' you better run"
 Well Abe says, "Where do you want this killin' done?"
 God says, "Out on Highway 61."
 
 Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose
 Welfare Department they wouldn't give him no clothes
 He asked poor Howard where can I go
 Howard said there's only one place I know
 Sam said tell me quick man I got to run
 0l' Howard just pointed with his gun
 And said that way down on Highway 61.
 
 Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
 I got forty red white and blue shoe strings
 And a thousand telephones that don't ring
 Do you know where I can get rid of these things
 And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son
 And he said yes I think it can be easily done
 Just take everything down to Highway 61.
 
 Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
 Told the first father that things weren't right
 My complexion she said is much too white
 He said come here and step into the light he says hmm you're right
 Let me tell the second mother this has been done
 But the second mother was with the seventh son
 And they were both out on Highway 61.
 
 Now the rovin' gambler he was very bored
 He was tryin' to create a next world war
 He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
 He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before
 But yes I think it can be very easily done
 We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
 And have it on Highway 61.
   

 HOUSE CARPENTER
                                       
 Well met, well met, my own true love
 Well met, well met, cried she
 I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
 And it's all for the love of thee

 I could have married a King's daughter there
 She would have married me
 But I have forsaken my King's daughter there
 It's all for the love of thee
 
 Well, if you could have married a King's daughter there
 I'm sure you're the one to blame
 For I am married to a house carpenter
 And I'm sure he's a fine young man
 
 Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
 And come away with me
 I'll take you where the green grass grows
 On the shores of sunny Italy
 
 So up she picked her babies three
 And gave them kisses, one, two, three
 Saying "take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
 And keep him good company."
 
 Well, they were sailin' about two weeks
 I'm sure it was not three
 When the younger of the girls, she came on deck
 Sayin' she wants company
 
 "Well, are you weepin' for your house and home?
 Or are you weepin' for your babies three?"
 "Well, I'm not weepin' for my house carpenter
 I'm weepin' for my babies three."
 
 Oh what are those hills yonder, my love
 They look as white as snow
 Those are the hill of heaven, my love
 You and I'll never know
 
 Oh what are those hills yonder, my love
 They look as dark as night
 Those are the hills of hell-fire my love
 Where you and I will unite
 
 Oh twice around went the gallant ship
 I'm sure it was not three
 When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
 And it drifted to the bottom of the sea
   

 HOUSE OF THE RISIN' SUN
                                       
 There is a house down in New Orleans
 They call the risin' sun.
 It's been the ruin of many a poor girl
 And me, oh God, I'm one.

 My mother was a tailor
 She sewed these new blue jeans
 My sweetheart was a gambler
 Down in New Orleans.

 Now the only thing a gambler needs
 Is a suitcase and a trunk
 And the only time he's satisfied
 Is when he's on a drunk.
 
 He'll fill his glasses up to the brim
 And he'll  pass the cards around
 And the only pleasure he gets out of life
 Is ramblin' from town to town.
 
 Oh tell my baby sister
 Not to do what I have done
 But shun that house in New Orleans
 They call the risin' sun.
 
 And it's one foot on the platform
 And the other foot on the train
 I'm goin' back to New Orleans
 To wear my ball and chain.
 
 I'm going back to New Orleans
 My race is almost run
 I'm goin' back to end my life
 Down in the risin' sun.
 
 There is a house in New Orleans
 They call the risin' sun.
 It's been the ruin of many a poor girl
 And me, oh God, I'm one.
   

 HURRICANE
                                       
 Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
 Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall.
 She sees the bartender in a pool of blood,
 Cries out, "My God, they killed them all!"
 Here comes the story of the Hurricane,
 The man the authorities came to blame
 For somethin' that he never done.
 Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
 The champion of the world.
 
 Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
 And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously.
 "I didn't do it," he says, and he throws up his hands
 "I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand.
 I saw them leavin'," he says, and he stops
 "One of us had better call up the cops."
 And so Patty calls the cops
 And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
 In the hot New Jersey night.
 
 Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
 Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around.
 Number one contender for the middleweight crown
 Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
 When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
 Just like the time before and the time before that.
 In Paterson that's just the way things go.
 If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
 'Less you wanna draw the heat.
 
 Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops.
 Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
 He said, "I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights
 They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
 And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head.
 Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead"
 So they took him to the infirmary
 And though this man could hardly see
 They told him that he could identify the guilty men.
 
 Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in,
 Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs.
 The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
 Says, "Wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!"
 Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane,
 The man the authorities came to blame
 For somethin' that he never done.
 Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
 The champion of the world.
 
 Four months later, the ghettos are in flame,
 Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name
 While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
 And the cops are puttin' the screws to him, lookin' for somebody to blame.
 "Remember that murder that happened in a bar?"
 "Remember you said you saw the getaway car?"
 "You think you'd like to play ball with the law?"
 "Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night?"
 "Don't forget that you are white."
 
 Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
 Cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break
 We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello
 Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
 You'll be doin' society a favor.
 That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver.
 We want to put his ass in stir
 We want to pin this triple murder on him
 He ain't no Gentleman Jim."
 
 Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
 But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
 It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay
 And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
 Up to some paradise
 Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
 And ride a horse along a trail.
 But then they took him to the jail house
 Where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
 
 All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
 The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance.
 The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
 To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
 And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger.
 No one doubted that he pulled the trigger.
 And though they could not produce the gun,
 The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
 And the all-white jury agreed.
 
 Rubin Carter was falsely tried.
 The crime was murder "one," guess who testified?
 Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
 And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
 How can the life of such a man
 Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
 To see him obviously framed
 Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
 Where justice is a game.
 
 Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
 Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
 While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
 An innocent man in a living hell.
 That's the story of the Hurricane,
 But it won't be over till they clear his name
 And give him back the time he's done.
 Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
 The champion of the world.
    

 I AM A LONESOME HOBO
                                       
 I am a lonesome hobo
 Without family or friends,
 Where another man's life might begin,
 That's exactly where mine ends.
 I have tried my hand at bribery,
 Blackmail and deceit,
 And I've served time for ev'rything
 'Cept beggin' on the street.
 
 Well, once I was rather prosperous,
 There was nothing I did lack.
 I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth
 And silk upon my back.
 But I did not trust my brother,
 I carried him to blame,
 Which led me to my fatal doom,
 To wander off in shame.
 
 Kind ladies and kind gentlemen,
 Soon I will be gone,
 But let me just warn you all,
 Before I do pass on;
 Stay free from petty jealousies,
 Live by no man's code,
 And hold your judgment for yourself
 Lest you wind up on this road.
 

 I BELIEVE IN YOU
                                       
 They ask me how I feel
 And if my love is real
 And how I know I'll make it through.
 And they, they look at me and frown,
 They'd like to drive me from this town,
 They don't want me around
 'Cause I believe in you.
 
 They show me to the door,
 They say don't come back no more
 'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to,
 And I walk out on my own
 A thousand miles from home
 But I don't feel alone
 'Cause I believe in you.
 
 I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
 I believe in you even though we be apart.
 I believe in you even on the morning after.
 Oh, when the dawn is nearing
 Oh, when the night is disappearing
 Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart.
 
 Don't let me drift too far,
 Keep me where you are
 Where I will always be renewed.
 And that which you've given me today
 Is worth more than I could pay
 And no matter what they say
 I believe in you.
 
 I believe in you when winter turn to summer,
 I believe in you when white turn to black,
 I believe in you even though I be outnumbered.
 Oh, though the earth may shake me
 Oh, though my friends forsake me
 Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
 
 Don't let me change my heart,
 Keep me set apart
 From all the plans they do pursue.
 And I, I don't mind the pain
 Don't mind the driving rain
 I know I will sustain
 'Cause I believe in you.
   

 IDIOT WIND
   
 Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press
 Whoever it is I wish they'd cut it out but when they will I can only guess.
 They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
 She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me.
 I can't help it if I'm lucky.

 People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act
 Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts.
 Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at,
 I couldn't believe after all these years, you didn't know me better than
     that
 Sweet lady.

 Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth,
 Blowing down the backroads headin' south.
 Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,
 You're an idiot, babe.
 It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
 
 I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might
     strike
 I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
 There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin' out of a boxcar door,
 You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he
     won the wars
 After losin' every battle.

 I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are
 Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin' me see
     stars.
 You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies.
 One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzin' around your eyes,
 Blood on your saddle.
 
 Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
 Blowing through the curtains in your room.
 Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,
 You're an idiot, babe.
 It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
 
 It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart
 You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my heart.
 Now everything's a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have
     stopped,
 What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the
     top
 You're on the bottom.

 I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
 I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't
     look into mine.
 The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the
     building burned.
 I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the
     springtime turned slowly into autumn.

 Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull,
 From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol.
 Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,
 You're an idiot, babe.
 It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.

 I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read
 Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin' I was somebody else
     instead.
 Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
 I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
 And all your ragin' glory.

 I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
 I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you
     from me.
 You'll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above,
 And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love,
 And it makes me feel so sorry.

 Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats,
 Blowing through the letters that we wrote.
 Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
 We're idiots, babe.
 It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
   

 I DON'T BELIEVE YOU
                                       
 I can't understand,
 She let go of my hand
 An' left me here facing the wall.
 I'd sure like t' know
 Why she did go,
 But I can't get close t' her at all.
 Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime,
 She said she would never forget.
 But now mornin's clear,
 It's like I ain't here,
 She just acts like we never have met.
 
 It's all new t' me,
 Like some mystery,
 It could even be like a myth.
 Yet it's hard t' think on,
 That she's the same one
 That last night I was with.
 From darkness, dreams're deserted,
 Am I still dreamin' yet?
 I wish she'd unlock
 Her voice once an' talk,
 'Stead of acting like we never have met.
 
 If she ain't feelin' well,
 Then why don't she tell
 'Stead of turnin' her back t' my face?
 Without any doubt,
 She seems too far out
 For me t' return t' her chase.
 Though the night ran swirling an' whirling,
 I remember her whispering yet.
 But evidently she don't
 An' evidently she won't,
 She just acts like we never have met.
 
 If I didn't have t' guess,
 I'd gladly confess
 T' anything I might've tried.
 If I was with 'er too long
 Or have done something wrong,
 I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run an' hide.
 Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played,
 Her mouth was watery and wet.
 But now something has changed
 For she ain't the same,
 She just acts like we never have met.
 
 I'm leavin' today,
 I'll be on my way
 Of this I can't say very much.
 But if you want me to,
 I can be just like you
 An' pretend that we never have touched.
 An' if anybody asks me, "Is it easy to forget?"
 I'll say, "It's easily done,
 You just pick anyone,
 An' pretend that you never have met!"
   

 I DREAMED I SAW ST. AUGUSTINE
                                       
 I dreamed I saw St. Augustine,
 Alive as you or me,
 Tearing through these quarters
 In the utmost misery,
 With a blanket underneath his arm
 And a coat of solid gold,
 Searching for the very souls
 Whom already have been sold.
 
 "Arise, arise," he cried so loud,
 In a voice without restraint,
 "Come out, ye gifted kings and queens
 And hear my sad complaint.
 No martyr is among ye now
 Whom you can call your own,
 So go on your way accordingly
 But know you're not alone."
 
 I dreamed I saw St. Augustine,
 Alive with fiery breath,
 And I dreamed I was amongst the ones
 That put him out to death.
 Oh, I awoke in anger,
 So alone and terrified,
 I put my fingers against the glass
 And bowed my head and cried.
   

 IF DOGS RUN FREE
                                       
 If dogs run free, then why not we
 Across the swooping plain?
 My ears hear a symphony
 Of two mules, trains and rain.
 The best is always yet to come,
 That's what they explain to me.
 Just do your thing, you'll be king,
 If dogs run free.
 
 If dogs run free, why not me
 Across the swamp of time?
 My mind weaves a symphony
 And tapestry of rhyme.
 Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee
 So it may flow and be,
 To each his own, it's all unknown,
 If dogs run free.

 If dogs run free, then what must be,
 Must be, and that is all.
 True love can make a blade of grass
 Stand up straight and tall.
 In harmony with the cosmic sea,
 True love needs no company,
 It can cure the soul, it can make it whole,
 If dogs run free.
   

 IF I DON'T BE THERE BY MORNING
                                       
 Blue sky upon the horizon,
 Private eye on my trail,
 And if I don't be there by morning
 She'll know that I must've spent the night in jail.

 I been runnin' from Memphis to L.A.,
 Had an appointment set sometime for today
 And if I don't be there by morning
 She'll know that I must have gone the other way.

 Finding my way home to you, girl, lonely and blue, mistreated too,
 Sometimes I think about you, girl, is it true that you think of me too?
 
 I got a woman living in L.A.,
 I got a woman waiting for my pay,
 And if I don't be there by morning
 Pack my clothes, get down on your knees and pray.

 I left my woman with a twenty-dollar bill,
 Left her waiting, hope she's waiting for me still.
 But if I don't be there by morning
 I guess that I never will.

 Finding my way home to you, girl, lonely and blue, mistreated too,
 Sometimes I think about you, girl, is it true that you think of me too?
 
 I left my woman with a twenty-dollar bill,
 Left her waiting, hope she's waiting for me still.
 Well, if I don't be there by morning
 I guess that I never will.
   

 IF NOT FOR YOU
                                       
 If not for you,
 Babe, I couldn't find the door,
 Couldn't even see the floor,
 I'd be sad and blue,
 If not for you.

 If not for you,
 Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
 Wait for the mornin' light
 To shine in through,
 But it would not be new,
 If not for you.

 If not for you
 My sky would fall,
 Rain would gather too.
 Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
 I'd be lost if not for you,
 And you know it's true.

 If not for you
 My sky would fall,
 Rain would gather too.
 Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
 Oh! what would I do
 If not for you.

 If not for you,
 Winter would have no spring,
 Couldn't hear the robin sing,
 I just wouldn't have a clue,
 Anyway it wouldn't ring true,
 If not for you.
   

 IF YOU SEE HER, SAY HELLO
                                       
 If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier
 She left here last early spring, is livin' there, I hear
 Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow
 She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so.

 We had a falling-out, like lovers often will
 And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
 And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart
 She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.

 If you get close to her, kiss her once for me
 I always have respected her for busting out and gettin' free
 Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
 Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her
     stay.

 I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
 And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
 And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off
 Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft.

 Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past
 I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast
 If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find
 Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
   

 IF YOU GOTTA GO, GO NOW
 (Or Else You Gotta Stay All Night)
   
 Listen to me, baby,
 There's something you must see.
 I want to be with you, gal,
 If you want to be with me.

 But if you got to go,
 It's all right.
 But if you got to go, go now,
 Or else you gotta stay all night.

 It ain't that I'm questionin' you.
 To take part in any quiz.
 It's just that I ain't got no watch
 An' you keep askin' me what time it is.

 But if you got to go,
 It's all right.
 But if you got to go, go now,
 Or else you gotta stay all night.

 I am just a poor boy, baby,
 Lookin' to connect.
 But I certainly don't want you thinkin'
 That I ain't got any respect.

 But if you got to go,
 It's all right.
 But if you got to go, go now,
 Or else you gotta stay all night.

 You know I'd have nightmares
 And a guilty conscience, too,
 If I kept you from anything
 That you really wanted to do.

 But if you got to go,
 It's all right.
 But if you got to go, go now,
 Or else you gotta stay all night.

 It ain't that I'm wantin'
 Anything you never gave before.
 It's just that I'll be sleepin' soon,
 It'll be too dark for you to find the door.

 But if you got to go,
 It's all right.
 But if you got to go, go now,
 Or else you gotta stay all night.
   

 I'D HATE TO BE YOU ON THAT DREADFUL DAY
                                       
 Well, your clock is gonna stop
 At Saint Peter's gate.
 Ya gonna ask him what time it is,
 He's gonna say, "It's too late."
 Hey, hey!
 I'd sure hate to be you
 On that dreadful day.
 
 You're gonna start to sweat
 And you ain't gonna stop.
 You're gonna have a nightmare
 And never wake up.
 Hey, hey, hey!
 I'd sure hate to be you
 On that dreadful day.

 You're gonna cry for pills
 And your head's gonna be in a knot,
 But the pills are gonna cost more
 Than what you've got.
 Hey, hey!
 I'd sure hate to be you
 On that dreadful day.
 
 You're gonna have to walk naked,
 Can't ride in no car.
 You're gonna let ev'rybody see
 Just what you are.
 Hey, hey!
 I'd sure hate to be you
 On that dreadful day.
 
 Well, the good wine's a-flowin'
 For five cents a quart.
 You're gonna look in your moneybags
 And find you're one cent short.
 Hey, hey, hey!
 I'd sure hate to be you
 On that dreadful day.
 
 You're gonna yell and scream,
 "Don't anybody care?"
 You're gonna hear out a voice say,
 "Shoulda listened when you heard the word down there."
 Hey, hey!
 I'd sure hate to be you
 On that dreadful day.
   

 I'D HAVE YOU ANY TIME
                                       
 Let me in here, I know I've been here,
 Let me into your heart.
 Let me know you, let me show you,
 Let me roll it to you.
 All I have is yours,
 All you see is mine
 And I'm glad to have you in my arms,
 I'd have you any time.
 
 Let me say it, let me play it,
 Let me lay it on you.
 Let me know you, let me show you,
 Let me grow it on you.
 All I have is yours,
 All you see is mine
 And I'm glad to have you in my arms,
 I'd have you any time.
 
 Let me in here, I know I've been here,
 Let me into your heart.
 Let me know you, let me show you,
 Let me roll it to you.
 All I have is yours,
 All you see is mine
 And I'm glad to have you in my arms,
 I'd have you any time.
   

 I AND I
                                       
 Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
 Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
 In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed
 To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
 
 I and I
 In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives.
 I and I
 One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives.
 
 Think I'll go out and go for a walk,
 Not much happenin' here, nothin' ever does.
 Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk
 I got nothin' to say, 'specially about whatever was.
 
 I and I
 In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives.
 I and I
 One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives.
 
 Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don't win the race,
 It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
 Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice's beautiful face
 And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
 
 I and I
 In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives.
 I and I
 One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives.
 
 Outside of two men on a train platform there's nobody in sight,
 They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
 The world could come to an end tonight, but that's all right.
 She should still be there sleepin' when I get back.
 
 I and I
 In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives.
 I and I
 One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives.
 
 Noontime, and I'm still pushin' myself along the road, the darkest part,
 Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
 Someone else is speakin' with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
 I've made shoes for everyone, even you, while I still go barefoot.
 
 I and I
 In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives.
 I and I
 One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives.
   

 I'LL KEEP IT WITH MINE
                                       
 You will search, babe,
 At any cost.
 But how long, babe,
 Can you search for what's not lost?
 Ev'rybody will help you,
 Some people are very kind.
 But if I can save you any time,
 Come on, give it to me,
 I'll keep it with mine.
 
 I can't help it
 If you might think I'm odd,
 If I say I'm not loving you for what you are
 But for what you're not.
 Everybody will help you
 Discover what you set out to find.
 But if I can save you any time,
 Come on, give it to me,
 I'll keep it with mine.

 The train leaves
 At half past ten,
 But it'll be back tomorrow,
 Same time again.
 The conductor he's weary,
 He's still stuck on the line.
 But if I can save you any time,
 Come on, give it to me,
 I'll keep it with mine.
   

 I'LL BE YOUR BABY TONIGHT
                                       
 Close your eyes, close the door,
 You don't have to worry any more.
 I'll be your baby tonight.

 Shut the light, shut the shade,
 You don't have to be afraid.
 I'll be your baby tonight.
 
 Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away,
 We're gonna forget it.
 That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon,
 But we're gonna let it,
 You won't regret it.

 Kick your shoes off, do not fear,
 Bring that bottle over here.
 I'll be your baby tonight.
   

 IN THE GARDEN
                                       
 When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
 When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
 Did they know He was the Son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
 Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
 When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
 When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
 
 When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
 When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
 Nicodemus came at night so he wouldn't be seen by men
 Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
 When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
 When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
 
 When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
 When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
 When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk, why must you criticize?
 Same thing My Father do, I can do likewise."
 When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
 When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
 
 Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
 Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
 The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head
 Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
 Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
 Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
 
 When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
 When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
 He said, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth."
 Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
 When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
 When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
 
 When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
 When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
 He said, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth."
 Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
 When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
 When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
   

 IN SEARCH OF LITTLE SADIE
                                       
 Went out last night to take a little round.
 I met my little Sadie and I brought her down.
 I ran right home and I went to bed
 With a forty-four smokeless under my head.
 
 I began to think what a deed I'd done.
 I grabbed my hat and I began to run.
 I made a god run but I ran too slow;
 They overtook me down in Jericho
 
 Standing on a corner a ringin' my bell,
 Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville.
 He said "Young man is you name Brown?
 Remember you blowed Sadie down."
 
 "Oh yes sir, my name is Lee.
 I murdered little Sadie in the first degree.
 First degree and second degree.
 If you've got any papers will you serve them to me?"
 
 Well they took me down town  and they dressed me in black,
 They put me on a train and they sent me back.
 I had no one to go my bail;
 They crammed me back into the county jail.
 
 Oh, yes they did.
 The judge and the jury they took their stand.
 The judge had the papers in his right hand.
 
 Forty-one days, forty-one nights;
 Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes;
 Oh, no!
 
 Went out last night to take a little round.
 I met little Sadie and I blowed her down.
 I ran right home and I went to bed,
 A forty-four smokeless under my head.
   

 IN THE SUMMERTIME
                                       
 I was in your presence for an hour or so
 Or was it a day? I truly don't know.
 Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low
 By that soft and shining sea.
 Did you respect me for what I did
 Or for what I didn't do, or for keeping it hid?
 Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
 Of everything you see?
 
 In the summertime, ah in the summertime,
 In the summertime when you were with me.
 
 I got the heart and you got the blood,
 We cut through iron and we cut through mud.
 Then came the warnin' that was before the flood
 That set everybody free.
 Fools they made a mock of sin,
 Our loyalty they tried to win
 But you were closer to me than my next of kin
 When they didn't want to know or see.
 
 In the summertime, ah in the summertime,
 In the summertime when you were with me.
 
 Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
 Poverty and shame was theirs.
 But all that sufferin' was not to be compared
 With the glory that is to be.
 And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
 It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
 It'll be with me unto the grave
 And then unto eternity.
 
 In the summertime, ah in the summertime,
 In the summertime when you were with me.
    

 I PITY THE POOR IMMIGRANT
                                       
 I pity the poor immigrant
 Who wishes he would've stayed home,
 Who uses all his power to do evil
 But in the end is always left so alone.
 That man whom with his fingers cheats
 And who lies with ev'ry breath,
 Who passionately hates his life
 And likewise, fears his death.
 
 I pity the poor immigrant
 Whose strength is spent in vain,
 Whose heaven is like Ironsides,
 Whose tears are like rain,
 Who eats but is not satisfied,
 Who hears but does not see,
 Who falls in love with wealth itself
 And turns his back on me.
 
 I pity the poor immigrant
 Who tramples through the mud,
 Who fills his mouth with laughing
 And who builds his town with blood,
 Whose visions in the final end
 Must shatter like the glass.
 I pity the poor immigrant
 When his gladness comes to pass.
   

 I'LL REMEMBER YOU
                                       
 I'll remember you
 When I've forgotten all the rest,
 You to me were true,
 You to me were the best.
 When there is no more,
 You cut to the core
 Quicker than anyone I knew.
 When I'm all alone
 In the great unknown,
 I'll remember you.
 
 I'll remember you
 At the end of the trail,
 I had so much left to do,
 I had so little time to fail.
 There's some people that
 You don't forget,
 Even though you've only seen'm
 One time or two.
 When the roses fade
 And I'm in the shade,
 I'll remember you.
 
 Didn't I, didn't I try to love you?
 Didn't I, didn't I try to care?
 Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
 With the rain blowing in your hair?
 
 I'll remember you
 When the wind blows through the piney wood.
 It was you who came right through,
 It was you who understood.
 Though I'd never say
 That I done it the way
 That you'd have liked me to.
 In the end,
 My dear sweet friend,
 I'll remember you.
   

 I SHALL BE FREE
                                       
 Well, I took me a woman late last night,
 I's three-fourths drunk, she looked uptight.
 She took off her wheel, took off her bell,
 Took off her wig, said, "How do I smell?"
 I hot-footed it . . . bare-naked . . .
 Out the window!

 Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
 Walk like a duck and stomp like a skunk.
 Don't hurt me none, don't hurt my pride
 'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
 (Right there
 Proud as can be)

 I's out there paintin' on the old woodshed
 When a can a black paint it fell on my head.
 I went down to scrub and rub
 But I had to sit in back of the tub.
 (Cost a quarter
 And I had to get out quick . . .
 Someone wanted to come in and take a sauna)

 Well, my telephone rang it would not stop,
 It's President Kennedy callin' me up.
 He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
 I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
 Anita Ekberg,
 Sophia Loren."
 (Put 'em all in the same room with Ernest Borgnine!)
 
 Well, I got a woman sleeps on a cot,
 She yells and hollers and squeals a lot.
 Licks my face and tickles my ear,
 Bends me over and buys me beer.
 (She's a honeymooner
 A June crooner
 A spoon feeder
 And a natural leader)
 
 Oh, there ain't no use in me workin' so heavy,
 I got a woman who works on the levee.
 Pumping that water up to her neck,
 Every week she sends me a monthly check.
 (She's a humdinger
 Folk singer
 Dead ringer
 For a thing-a-muh jigger)
 
 Late one day in the middle of the week,
 Eyes were closed I was half asleep.
 I chased me a woman up the hill,
 Right in the middle of an air raid drill.
 It was Little Bo Peep!
 (I jumped a fallout shelter
 I jumped a bean stalk
 I jumped a ferris wheel)
 
 Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote,
 He's a-runnin' for office on the ballot note.
 He's out there preachin' in front of the steeple,
 Tellin' me he loves all kinds-a people.
 (He's eatin' bagels
 He's eatin' pizza
 He's eatin' chitlins
 He's eatin' bullshit!)
 
 Oh, set me down on a television floor,
 I'll flip the channel to number four.
 Out of the shower comes a grown-up man
 With a bottle of hair oil in his hand.
 (It's that greasy kid stuff.
 What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is
 What do you do about Willy Mays and Yul Brynner,
 Charles de Gaulle
 And Robert Louis Stevenson?)
 
 Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
 Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
 She takes about fifteen baths a day,
 Wants me to grow a cigar on my face.
 (She's a little bit heavy!)
 
 Well, ask me why I'm drunk alla time,
 It levels my head and eases my mind.
 I just walk along and stroll and sing,
 I see better days and I do better things.
 (I catch dinosaurs
 I make love to Elizabeth Taylor . . .
 Catch hell from Richard Burton!)
   

 I SHALL BE FREE NO. 10
                                       
 I'm just average, common too
 I'm just like him, the same as you
 I'm everybody's brother and son
 I ain't different from anyone
 It ain't no use a-talking to me
 It's just the same as talking to you.
 
 I was shadow-boxing earlier in the day
 I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay
 I said "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come
 26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine
 Five, four, three, two, one, Cassius Clay you'd better run
 99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you
 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen."
 
 Well, I don't know, but I've been told
 The streets in heaven are lined with gold
 I ask you how things could get much worse
 If the Russians happen to get up there first.
 Wowee! pretty scary!
 
 Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree
 I want ev'rybody to be free
 But if you think that I'll let Barry Goldwater
 Move in next door and marry my daughter
 You must think I'm crazy!
 I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
 
 Well, I set my monkey on the log
 And ordered him to do the Dog
 He wagged his tail and shook his head
 And he went and did the Cat instead
 He's a weird monkey, very funky.
 
 I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on
 Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun
 I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
 And my wig-hat was falling in my face
 But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
 
 I gotta woman, she's so mean
 She sticks my boots in the washing machine
 Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude
 Puts bubblegum in my food
 She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey."
 
 Now I gotta friend who spends his life
 Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife
 Dreams of strangling me with a scarf
 When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
 I've got a million friends!
 
 Now they asked me to read a poem
 At the sorority sister's home
 I got knocked down and my head was swimmin'
 I wound up with the Dean of Women
 Yippee! I'm a poet, and I know it.
 Hope I don't blow it.
 
 I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
 So I look like a walking mountain range
 And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse
 Out to the country club and the golf course.
 Carry the New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
 
 Now you're probably wondering by now
 Just what this song is all about
 What's probably got you baffled more
 Is what this thing here is for.
 It's nothing
 It's something I learned over in England.
   

 I SHALL BE RELEASED
                                       
 They say ev'rything can be replaced,
 Yet ev'ry distance is not near.
 So I remember ev'ry face
 Of ev'ry man who put me here.
 I see my light come shining
 From the west unto the east.
 Any day now, any day now,
 I shall be released.
 
 They say ev'ry man needs protection,
 They say ev'ry man must fall.
 Yet I swear I see my reflection
 Some place so high above this wall.
 I see my light come shining
 From the west unto the east.
 Any day now, any day now,
 I shall be released.
 
 Standing next to me in this lonely crowd,
 Is a man who swears he's not to blame.
 All day long I hear him shout so loud,
 Crying out that he was framed.
 I see my light come shining
 From the west unto the east.
 Any day now, any day now,
 I shall be released.
   

 ISIS
                                       
 I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
 But I could not hold on to her very long.
 So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
 For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong.
 
 I came to a high place of darkness and light.
 The dividing line ran through the center of town.
 I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
 Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
 
 A man in the corner approached me for a match.
 I knew right away he was not ordinary.
 He said, "Are you lookin' for somethin' easy to catch?"
 I said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
 
 We set out that night for the cold in the North.
 I gave him my blanket, he gave me his word.
 I said, "Where are we goin'?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
 I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
 
 I was thinkin' about turquoise, I was thinkin' about gold,
 I was thinkin' about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace.
 As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
 I was thinkin' about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
 
 How she told me that one day we would meet up again,
 And things would be different the next time we wed,
 If I only could hang on and just be her friend.
 I still can't remember all the best things she said.
 
 We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice.
 He said, "There's a body I'm tryin' to find.
 If I carry it out it'll bring a good price."
 'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
 
 The wind it was howlin' and the snow was outrageous.
 We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
 When he died I was hopin' that it wasn't contagious,
 But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
 
 I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
 There was no jewels, no nothin', I felt I'd been had.
 When I saw that my partner was just bein' friendly,
 When I took up his offer I must-a been mad.
 
 I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
 Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
 I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied.
 Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
 
 She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise.
 Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed,
 I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes.
 I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead.
 
 She said, "Where ya been?" I said, "No place special."
 She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, not quite."
 She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
 She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "Yeah, I jes might."
 
 Isis, oh, Isis, you mystical child.
 What drives me to you is what drives me insane.
 I still can remember the way that you smiled
 On the fifth day of May in the drizzlin' rain.
   

 IS YOUR LOVE IN VAIN?
                                       
 Do you love me, or are you just extending goodwill?
 Do you need me half as bad as you say, or are you just feeling guilt?
 I've been burned before and I know the score
 So you won't hear me complain.
 Will I be able to count on you
 Or is your love in vain?

 Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
 When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
 Do you know my world, do you know my kind
 Or must I explain?
 Will you let me be myself
 Or is your love in vain?

 Well I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
 I've been in and out of happiness.
 I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings
 And I've never been too impressed.
 
 All right, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you
 If I'm a fool you can have the night, you can have the morning too.
 Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow,
 Do you understand my pain?
 Are you willing to risk it all
 Or is your love in vain?
   

 IT AIN'T ME, BABE
                                       
 Go 'way from my window,
 Leave at your own chosen speed.
 I'm not the one you want, babe,
 I'm not the one you need.
 You say you're lookin' for someone
 Never weak but always strong,
 To protect you an' defend you
 Whether you are right or wrong,
 Someone to open each and every door,
 But it ain't me, babe,
 No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
 It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.
 
 Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
 Go lightly on the ground.
 I'm not the one you want, babe,
 I will only let you down.
 You say you're lookin' for someone
 Who will promise never to part,
 Someone to close his eyes for you,
 Someone to close his heart,
 Someone who will die for you an' more,
 But it ain't me, babe,
 No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
 It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.

 Go melt back into the night, babe,
 Everything inside is made of stone.
 There's nothing in here moving
 An' anyway I'm not alone.
 You say you're looking for someone
 Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
 To gather flowers constantly
 An' to come each time you call,
 A lover for your life an' nothing more,
 But it ain't me, babe,
 No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
 It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.


 IT HURTS ME TOO
                                       
 So run here baby
 Put your little hands in mine
 I've got something to tell you
 I know you're gonna change your mind
 
 When things go wrong
 So wrong with you
 I hurts me too
 
 I want you baby
 Just to understand
 I don't want to be your boss, babe
 I just want to be your man
 
 Now when you go home
 You don't have to get along
 Come back to me baby
 Well it's where you belong
 
 I love you baby
 And you know that it's true
 I won't mistreat you baby
 Nothin' in this world is like you
 
 So run here baby
 Put your little hands in mine
 I've got something to tell you
 I know you're gonna change your mind
   

 IT'S ALL OVER NOW, BABY BLUE
                                       
 You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last.
 But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast.
 Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
 Crying like a fire in the sun.
 Look out the saints are comin' through
 And it's all over now, Baby Blue.

 The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense.
 Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
 The empty-handed painter from your streets
 Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets.
 This sky, too, is folding under you
 And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
 
 All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home.
 All your reindeer armies, are all going home.
 The lover who just walked out your door
 Has taken all his blankets from the floor.
 The carpet, too, is moving under you
 And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
 
 Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you.
 Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you.
 The vagabond who's rapping at your door
 Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
 Strike another match, go start anew
 And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
   

 IT'S ALRIGHT, MA
 (I'm Only Bleeding)
                                       
 Darkness at the break of noon
 Shadows even the silver spoon
 The handmade blade, the child's balloon
 Eclipses both the sun and moon
 To understand you know too soon
 There is no sense in trying.

 Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
 Suicide remarks are torn
 From the fool's gold mouthpiece
 The hollow horn plays wasted words
 Proves to warn
 That he not busy being born
 Is busy dying.
 
 Temptation's page flies out the door
 You follow, find yourself at war
 Watch waterfalls of pity roar
 You feel to moan but unlike before
 You discover
 That you'd just be
 One more person crying.
 
 So don't fear if you hear
 A foreign sound to your ear
 It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing.
 
 As some warn victory, some downfall
 Private reasons great or small
 Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
 To make all that should be killed to crawl
 While others say don't hate nothing at all
 Except hatred.

 Disillusioned words like bullets bark
 As human gods aim for their mark
 Made everything from toy guns that spark
 To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
 It's easy to see without looking too far
 That not much
 Is really sacred.
 
 While preachers preach of evil fates
 Teachers teach that knowledge waits
 Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
 Goodness hides behind its gates
 But even the president of the United States
 Sometimes must have
 To stand naked.
 
 An' though the rules of the road have been lodged
 It's only people's games that you got to dodge
 And it's alright, Ma, I can make it.
 
 Advertising signs that con you
 Into thinking you're the one
 That can do what's never been done
 That can win what's never been won
 Meantime life outside goes on
 All around you.
 
 You lose yourself, you reappear
 You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
 Alone you stand with nobody near
 When a trembling distant voice, unclear
 Startles your sleeping ears to hear
 That somebody thinks
 They really found you.
 
 A question in your nerves is lit
 Yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy
 Insure you not to quit
 To keep it in your mind and not fergit
 That it is not he or she or them or it
 That you belong to.
 
 Although the masters make the rules
 For the wise men and the fools
 I got nothing, Ma, to live up to.
 
 For them that must obey authority
 That they do not respect in any degree
 Who despise their jobs, their destinies
 Speak jealously of them that are free
 Cultivate their flowers to be
 Nothing more than something
 They invest in.
 
 While some on principles baptized
 To strict party platform ties
 Social clubs in drag disguise
 Outsiders they can freely criticize
 Tell nothing except who to idolize
 And then say God bless him.
 
 While one who sings with his tongue on fire
 Gargles in the rat race choir
 Bent out of shape from society's pliers
 Cares not to come up any higher
 But rather get you down in the hole
 That he's in.
 
 But I mean no harm nor put fault
 On anyone that lives in a vault
 But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him.
 
 Old lady judges watch people in pairs
 Limited in sex, they dare
 To push fake morals, insult and stare
 While money doesn't talk, it swears
 Obscenity, who really cares
 Propaganda, all is phony.
 
 While them that defend what they cannot see
 With a killer's pride, security
 It blows the minds most bitterly
 For them that think death's honesty
 Won't fall upon them naturally
 Life sometimes
 Must get lonely.
 
 My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards
 False gods, I scuff
 At pettiness which plays so rough
 Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
 Kick my legs to crash it off
 Say okay, I have had enough
 What else can you show me?
 
 And if my thought-dreams could be seen
 They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
 But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only.
   

 IT TAKES A LOT TO LAUGH, IT TAKES A TRAIN TO CRY
                                       
 Well, I ride on a mailtrain, baby,
 Can't buy a thrill.
 Well, I've been up all night, baby,
 Leanin' on the window sill.
 Well, if I die
 On top of the hill
 And if I don't make it,
 You know my baby will.
 
 Don't the moon look good, mama,
 Shinin' through the trees?
 Don't the brakeman look good, mama,
 Flagging down the "Double E"?
 Don't the sun look good
 Goin' down over the sea?
 Don't my gal look fine
 When she's comin' after me?
 
 Now the wintertime is coming,
 The windows are filled with frost.
 I went to tell everybody,
 But I could not get across.
 Well, I wanna be your lover, baby,
 I don't wanna be your boss.
 Don't say I never warned you
 When your train gets lost.
   

 I WANNA BE YOUR LOVER
                                       
 Well, the rainman comes with his magic wand
 And the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
 And the walls collide, Mona cries,
 And the rainman leaves in the wolfman's disguise.
 
 I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man.
 I wanna be your lover, baby,
 I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours.
 
 Well, the undertaker in his midnight suit
 Says to the masked man, "Ain't you cute!"
 Well, the mask man he gets up on the shelf
 And he says, "You ain't so bad yourself."
 
 I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man.
 I wanna be your lover, baby,
 I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours.
 
 Well, jumpin' Judy can't go no higher.
 She had bullets in her eyes, and they fire.
 Rasputin he's so dignified,
 He touched the back of her head an' he died.
 
 I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man.
 I wanna be your lover, baby,
 I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours.
 
 Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
 Stretchin' out upon the grass.
 She gets all messed up and she faintsÑ
 That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't.
 
 I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man.
 I wanna be your lover, baby,
 I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours.
    

 I WANT YOU
                                       
 The guilty undertaker sighs,
 The lonesome organ grinder cries,
 The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
 The cracked bells and washed-out horns
 Blow into my face with scorn,
 But it's not that way,
 I wasn't born to lose you.
 I want you, I want you,
 I want you so bad,
 Honey, I want you.
 
 The drunken politician leaps
 Upon the street where mothers weep
 And the saviors who are fast asleep,
 They wait for you.
 And I wait for them to interrupt
 Me drinkin' from my broken cup
 And ask me to
 Open up the gate for you.
 I want you, I want you,
 I want you so bad,
 Honey, I want you.
 
 Now all my fathers, they've gone down
 True love they've been without it.
 But all their daughters put me down
 'Cause I don't think about it.
 
 Well, I return to the Queen of Spades
 And talk with my chambermaid.
 She knows that I'm not afraid
 To look at her.
 She is good to me
 And there's nothing she doesn't see.
 She knows where I'd like to be
 But it doesn't matter.
 I want you, I want you,
 I want you so bad,
 Honey, I want you.
 
 Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit,
 He spoke to me, I took his flute.
 No, I wasn't very cute to him,
 Was I?
 But I did it, though, because he lied
 Because he took you for a ride
 And because time was on his side
 And because I . . .
 I want you, I want you,
 I want you so bad,
 Honey, I want you.
   

 JACK-A-ROE
                                       
 Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell.
 He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
 Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.

 She had sweethearts a-plenty and men of high degree.
 There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
 Oh, her true love e'er to be.

 "Oh daughter, oh daughter, you body I will confine.
 If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
 Oh, would ever suit your mind."

 "This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
 There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
 Oh, would have this heart of mine.

 Now Jackie's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind,
 To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
 Oh, his darling girl behind.

 She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
 Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
 Oh, convey herself away.

 "Before you step onboard, sir, your name I'd like to know."
 She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
 Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."

 "Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
 Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
 Oh, to face the cannonball.

 "I know my waist is slender and my fingers they are small,
 But they would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
 Oh, to see ten thousand fall."

 The war soon being over, they hunted all around.
 Among the dead and dying her darling love she found,
 Oh, her darling love she found.

 She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town,
 And sent for her physician to quickly heal his wounds,
 Oh, to quickly heal his wounds.

 This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
 This couple they got married, so why not you and me,
 Oh, so why not you and me.
   

 JET PILOT
                                       
 Well, she's got Jet Pilot eyes from her hips on down.
 All the bombardiers are trying to force her out of town.
 She's five feet nine and she carries a monkey wrench.
 She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
 She got all the downtown boys, all at her command
 But you've got to watch her closely Ôcause she ain't no woman
 She's a man.
    

 JIM JONES
                                       
 Come and listen for a moment, lads,
 And hear me tell my tale.
 How across the sea from England
 I was condemned to sail.
 Now the jury found me guilty,
 Then says the judge, says he,
 "Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you
 Across the stormy sea.
 But take a tip before you ship
 To join the iron gang.
 Don't get too gay in Botany Bay,
 Or else you'll surely hang.
 Or else you'll surely hang," says he.
 "And after that, Jim Jones,
 It's high above on the gallows tree
 The crows will pick your bones."
 
 And our ship was high upon the sea
 Then pirates came along,
 But the soldiers on our convict ship
 Were full five hundred strong.
 For they opened fire and somehow drove
 That pirate ship away.
 But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship
 Tan gone to Botany Bay.
 With the storms ragin' round us,
 And the winds a-blowin' gale,
 I'd rather have drowned in misery
 Than gone to New South Wales.
 
 Now it's day and night and the irons clang,
 And like poor galley slaves
 We toil and toil, and when we die
 Must fill dishonored graves,
 And it's by and by I'll slip my chains,
 Well, into the bush I'll go
 And I'll join the bravest rankers there,
 Jack Donohue and co.
 And some dark night, when everything
 Is silent in the town
 I'll shoot those tyrants one and all,
 I'll gun the flogger down.
 Oh, I'll give the land a little shock,
 Remember what I say,
 And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones
 In chains to Botany Bay.
   

 JOEY
                                       
 Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when
 Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion
 Always on the outside of whatever side there was
 When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just
     because."

 Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last.
 They called Joe "Crazy," the baby they called "Kid Blast."
 Some say they lived off gambling and runnin' numbers too.
 It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
 
 Joey, Joey,
 King of the streets, child of clay.
 Joey, Joey,
 What made them want to come and blow you away?
 
 There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that
 No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
 When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof.
 He went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin' he was bulletproof.
 
 The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets
 Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
 Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners.
 They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs.
 
 The hostages were tremblin' when they heard a man exclaim,
 "Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
 But Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, "We're not those kind of men.
 It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
 
 Joey, Joey,
 King of the streets, child of clay.
 Joey, Joey,
 What made them want to come and blow you away?

 The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith
 They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with.
 "What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met
 "Five to ten," said Joey. The judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
 
 He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich
 They threw him in the hole one time for tryin' to stop a strike.
 His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
 What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.

 When they let him out in '71 he'd lost a little weight
 But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
 He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind
 To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."

 Joey, Joey,
 King of the streets, child of clay.
 Joey, Joey,
 Why did they have to come and blow you away?

 It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun
 "I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
 Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe,
 Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."

 One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York
 He could see it comin' through the door as he lifted up his fork.
 He pushed the table over to protect his family
 Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.

 Joey, Joey,
 King of the streets, child of clay.
 Joey, Joey,
 What made them want to come and blow you away?

 Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep.
 I heard his best friend Frankie say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep."
 Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave
 I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.

 The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned
 They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
 And someday if God's in heaven overlookin' His preserve
 I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.

 Joey, Joey,
 King of the streets, child of clay.
 Joey, Joey,
 What made them want to come and blow you away?
   

 JOHN BROWN
                                       
 John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore.
 His mama sure was proud of him!
 He stood straight and tall in his uniform and all.
 His mama's face broke out all in a grin.
 
 "Oh son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
 You make me proud to know you hold a gun.
 Do what the captain says, lots of medals you will get,
 And we'll put them on the wall when you come home."
 
 As that old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
 Tellin' ev'ryone in the neighborhood:
 "That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know."
 She made well sure her neighbors understood.
 
 She got a letter once in a while and her face broke into a smile
 As she showed them to the people from next door.
 And she bragged about her son with his uniform and gun,
 And these things you called a good old-fashioned war.
 
 Oh! Good old-fashioned war!
 
 Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come.
 They ceased to come for about ten months or more.
 Then a letter finally came saying, "Go down and meet the train.
 Your son's a-coming home from the war."
 
 She smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere around
 But she could not see her soldier son in sight.
 But as all the people passed, she saw her son at last,
 When she did she could hardly believe her eyes.
 
 Oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off
 And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
 He whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not know,
 While she couldn't even recognize his face!
 
 Oh! Lord! Not even recognize his face.
 
 "Oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what they done.
 How is it you come to be this way?"
 He tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move
 And the mother had to turn her face away.
 
 "Don't you remember, Ma, when I went off to war
 You thought it was the best thing I could do?
 I was on the battleground, you were home . . . acting proud.
 You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
 
 "Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am I doing here?
 I'm a-tryin' to kill somebody or die tryin'.
 But the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close
 And I saw that his face looked just like mine."
 
 Oh! Lord! Just like mine!
 
 "And I couldn't help but think, through the thunder rolling and stink,
 That I was just a puppet in a play.
 And through the roar and smoke, this string is finally broke,
 And a cannon ball blew my eyes away."

 As he turned away to walk, his Ma was still in shock
 At seein' the metal brace that helped him stand.
 But as he turned to go, he called his mother close
    
 
 JOHN WESLEY HARDING
                                       
 John Wesley Harding
 Was a friend to the poor,
 He trav'led with a gun in ev'ry hand.
 All along this countryside,
 He opened a many a door,
 But he was never known
 To hurt a honest man.
 
 'Twas down in Chaynee County,
 A time they talk about,
 With his lady by his side
 He took a stand.
 And soon the situation there
 Was all but straightened out,
 For he was always known
 To lend a helping hand.
 
 All across the telegraph
 His name it did resound,
 But no charge held against him
 Could they prove.
 And there was no man around
 Who could track or chain him down,
 He was never known
 To make a foolish move.
 And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
   

 JOKERMAN
                                       
 Standing on the waters casting your bread
 While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
 Distant ships sailing into the mist,
 You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was
     blowing.
 Freedom just around the corner for you
 But with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
 
 Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
 Bird fly high by the light of the moon,
 Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
 
 So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
 You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
 Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
 Both of their futures, so full of dread, you don't show one.
 Shedding off one more layer of skin,
 Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within.
 
 Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
 Bird fly high by the light of the moon,
 Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
 
 You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
 Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister.
 You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah
 But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister.
 Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
 You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
 
 Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
 Bird fly high by the light of the moon,
 Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
 
 Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
 The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
 In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed,
 Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
 Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
 Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face.
 
 Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
 Bird fly high by the light of the moon,
 Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
 
 Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
 Preacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain.
 Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
 Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain,
 False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
 Only a matter of time 'til night comes steppin' in.
 
 Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
 Bird fly high by the light of the moon,
 Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
 
 It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
 A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
 He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
 Take the motherless children off the street
 And place them at the feet of a harlot.
 Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
 Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
 
 Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
 Bird fly high by the light of the moon,
 Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
 

 JUST LIKE A WOMAN
                                        
 Nobody feels any pain
 Tonight as I stand inside the rain
 Ev'rybody knows
 That Baby's got new clothes
 But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
 Have fallen from her curls.
 She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
 She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
 And she aches just like a woman
 But she breaks just like a little girl.
 
 Queen Mary, she's my friend
 Yes, I believe I'll go see her again
 Nobody has to guess
 That Baby can't be blessed
 Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest
 With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls.
 She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
 She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
 And she aches just like a woman
 But she breaks just like a little girl.
 
 It was raining from the first
 And I was dying there of thirst
 So I came in here
 And your long-time curse hurts
 But what's worse
 Is this pain in here
 I can't stay in here
 Ain't it clear thatÑ
 
 I just can't fit
 Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
 When we meet again
 Introduced as friends
 Please don't let on that you knew me when
 I was hungry and it was your world.
 Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do
 You make love just like a woman, yes, you do
 Then you ache just like a woman
 But you break just like a little girl.
   

 JUST LIKE TOM THUMB'S BLUES
                                       
 When you're lost in the rain in Juarez
 And it's Eastertime too
 And your gravity fails
 And negativity don't pull you through
 Don't put on any airs
 When you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
 They got some hungry women there
 And they really make a mess outa you
 
 Now if you see Saint Annie
 Please tell her thanks a lot
 I cannot move
 My fingers are all in a knot
 I don't have the strength
 To get up and take another shot
 And my best friend, my doctor
 Won't even say what it is I've got
 
 Sweet Melinda
 The peasants call her the goddess of gloom
 She speaks good English
 And she invites you up into her room
 And you're so kind
 And careful not to go to her too soon
 And she takes your voice
 And leaves you howling at the moon
 
 Up on Housing Project Hill
 It's either fortune or fame
 You must pick up one or the other
 Though neither of them are to be what they claim
 If you're lookin' to get silly
 You better go back to from where you came
 Because the cops don't need you
 And man they expect the same
 
 Now all the authorities
 They just stand around and boast
 How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
 Into leaving his post
 And picking up Angel who
 Just arrived here from the coast
 Who looked so fine at first
 But left looking just like a ghost
 
 I started out on burgundy
 But soon hit the harder stuff
 Everybody said they'd stand behind me
 When the game got rough
 But the joke was on me
 There was nobody even there to call my bluff
 I'm going back to New York City
 I do believe I've had enough
   

 JUST ALLOW ME ONE MORE CHANCE
                                       
 Honey, just allow me one more chance
 To get along with you.
 Honey, just allow me one more chance,
 Ah'll do anything with you.
 Well, I'm a-walkin' down the road
 With my head in my hand,
 I'm lookin' for a woman
 Needs a worried man.
 Just-a one kind favor I ask you,
 'Low me just-a one more chance.
 
 Honey, just allow me one more chance
 To ride your aeroplane.
 Honey, just allow me one more chance
 To ride your passenger train.
 Well, I've been lookin' all over
 For a gal like you,
 I can't find nobody
 So you'll have to do.
 Just-a one kind favor I ask you,
 'Low me just-a one more chance.
 
 Honey, just allow me one more chance
 To get along with you.
 Honey, just allow me one more chance,
 Ah'll do anything with you.
 Well, lookin' for a woman
 That ain't got no man,
 Is just lookin' for a needle
 That is lost in the sand.
 Just-a one kind favor I ask you,
 'Low me just-a one more chance.
   

 KINGSPORT TOWN
                                       
 The wind the wing is blowing strong
 My hands they got no gloves
 I wish to my soul that I could see
 The girl I'm a-thinking of

 Don't you remember me babe
 I remembre you quite well
 You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town
 With a high sheriff on my trail

 High sheriff on my trail, boys
 High sheriff on my trail
 All because I'm falling for
 A curly-headed dark-eyed girl
 
 Who's a-gonna stroke your cold black hair
 And sandy colored skin
 Who's a-gonna kiss your Menphis lips
 When I'm out in the wind
 When I'm out in the wind, babe
 When I'm out in the wind
 Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth
 When I'm out in the wind
 Who's a-gonna walk you side by side
 And tell you everything's alright
 Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long
 And not just in the night
 Who's a-gonna walk you side by side
 Who's a-gonna be your man
 Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye
 And hold your bad luck hand

 Hold your bad luck hand, babe
 Hold your bad luck hand
 Who's a-gonna hold your hard luck hand
 And who's a-gonna be your man
 The wind the wind is blowing strong
 My hands they got no gloves
 I wish to my song I could see
 The girl I'm a-thinking of
   

 KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S DOOR
                                       
 Mama, take this badge off of me
 I can't use it anymore.
 It's gettin' dark, too dark for me to see
 I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.
 
 Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
 Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
 Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
 Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
 
 Mama, put my guns in the ground
 I can't shoot them anymore.
 That long black cloud is comin' down
 I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.
 
 Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
 Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
 Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
 Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
    

 LIKE A ROLLING STONE
                                       
 Once upon a time you dressed so fine
 You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
 People'd call, say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
 You thought they were all kiddin' you
 You used to laugh about
 Everybody that was hangin' out
 Now you don't talk so loud
 Now you don't seem so proud
 About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
 
 How does it feel
 How does it feel
 To be without a home
 Like a complete unknown
 Like a rolling stone?
 
 You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
 But you know you only used to get juiced in it
 And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
 And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it
 You said you'd never compromise
 With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
 He's not selling any alibis
 As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
 And ask him do you want to make a deal?
 
 How does it feel
 How does it feel
 To be on your own
 With no direction home
 Like a complete unknown
 Like a rolling stone?
 
 You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
 When they all come down and did tricks for you
 You never understood that it ain't no good
 You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
 You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
 Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
 Ain't it hard when you discover that
 He really wasn't where it's at
 After he took from you everything he could steal.
 
 How does it feel
 How does it feel
 To be on your own
 With no direction home
 Like a complete unknown
 Like a rolling stone?
 
 Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
 They're drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
 Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things
 But you'd better lift your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe
 You used to be so amused
 At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
 Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
 When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
 You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
 
 How does it feel
 How does it feel
 To be on your own
 With no direction home
 Like a complete unknown
 Like a rolling stone?
   

 LAST THOUGHTS ON WOODY GUTHRIE
                                       
 When yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb
 When you think you're too old, too young, too smart or too dumb
 When yer laggin' behind an' losin' yer pace
 In a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race
 No matter what yer doing if you start givin' up
 If the wine don't come to the top of yer cup
 If the wind's got you sideways with with one hand holdin' on
 And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone
 And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it
 And the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it
 And yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long
 And you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong
 And lonesome comes up as down goes the day
 And tomorrow's mornin' seems so far away
 And you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'
 And yer rope is a-slidin' 'cause yer hands are a-drippin'
 And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
 Turn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys
 And yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'
 And the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'
 And the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'
 And yer whole world's a-slammin' and bangin'
 And yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm
 And to yourself you sometimes say
 "I never knew it was gonna be this way
 Why didn't they tell me the day I was born"
 And you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat
 And you're lookin' for somethin' you ain't quite found yet
 And yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air
 And the whole world's a-watchin' with a window peek stare
 And yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying
 And yer heart feels sick like fish when they're fryin'
 And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet
 And you need it badly but it lays on the street
 And yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beat
 And you think yer ears might a been hurt
 Or yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blindin' dirt
 And you figured you failed in yesterdays rush
 When you were faked out an' fooled white facing a four flush
 And all the time you were holdin' three queens
 And it's makin you mad, it's makin' you mean
 Like in the middle of Life magazine
 
 Bouncin' around a pinball machine
 And there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying
 That somebody someplace oughta be hearin'
 But it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head
 And it bothers you badly when your layin' in bed
 And no matter how you try you just can't say it
 And yer scared to yer soul  you just might forget it
 And yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head
 And yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead
 And the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth
 And his jaws start closin with you underneath
 And yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind
 And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign
 And you say to yourself just what am I doin'
 On this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'
 On this curve I'm hanging
 On this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm talking
 In this air I'm inhaling
 Am I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard
 Why am I walking, where am I running
 What am  I saying, what am I knowing
 On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'
 On this mandolin I'm strummin', in the song I'm singin'
 In the tune I'm hummin', in the words I'm writin'
 In the words that I'm thinkin'
 In this ocean of hours I'm  all the time drinkin'
 Who am I helping, what am I breaking
 What am I giving, what am I taking
 But you try with your whole soul best
 Never to think these thoughts and never to let
 Them kind of thoughts gain ground
 Or make yer heart pound
 But then again you know why they're around
 Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
 "Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping
 And you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping
 And you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'
 And you can't remember for the best of yer thinking
 If that was you in the dream that was screaming
 And you know that it's something special you're needin'
 And you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'
 And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding
 
 And you need something special
 Yeah, you need something special all right
 You need a fast flyin' train on a tornado track
 To shoot you someplace and shoot you back
 You need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler
 That's been banging and booming and blowing forever
 That knows yer troubles a hundred times over
 You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race
 That won't laugh at yer looks
 Your voice or your face
 And by any number of bets in the book
 Will be rollin' long after the bubblegum craze
 You need something to open up a new door
 To show you something you seen before
 But overlooked a hundred times or more
 You need something to open your eyes
 You need something to make it known
 That it's you and no one else that owns
 That spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting
 That the world ain't got you beat
 That it ain't got you licked
 It can't get you crazy no matter how many
 Times you might get kicked
 You need something special all right
 You need something special to give you hope
 But hope's just a word
 That maybe you said or maybe you heard
 On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve
 
 But that's what you need man, and you need it bad
 And yer trouble is you know it too good
 "Cause you look an' you start getting the chills
 
 "Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill
 And it ain't on Macy's window sill
 And it ain't on no rich kid's road map
 And it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity house
 And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ
 And it ain't on that dimlit stage
 With that half-wit comedian on it
 Ranting and raving and taking yer money
 And you thinks it's funny
 No you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club
 
 And it ain't in the seats of a supper club
 And sure as hell you're bound to tell
 That no matter how hard you rub
 You just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub
 No, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you
 And it ain't in the pimple-lotion people are sellin' you
 And it ain't in no cardboard-box house
 Or down any movie star's blouse
 And you can't find it on the golf course
 And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus
 And it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes
 And it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons
 And it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices
 That come knockin' and tappin' in Christmas wrappin'
 Sayin' ain't I pretty and ain't I cute and look at my skin
 Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow
 Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry
 When you can't even sense if they got any insides
 These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows
 No you'll not now or no other day
 Find it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache«
 And inside it the people made of molasses
 That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses
 And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies
 Who'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny
 Who breathe and burp and bend and crack
 And before you can count from one to ten
 Do it all over again but this time behind yer back
 My friend
 The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl
 And play games with each other in their sand-box world
 And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
 That run around gallant
 And make all rules for the ones that got talent
 And it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
 And think they're foolin' you
 The ones who jump on the wagon
 Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
 To get their kicks, get out of it quick
 And make all kinds of rnoney and chicks
 And you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat
 Sayin', "Christ do I gotta be like that
 
 Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at
 Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel
 Good God Almighty

 THAT STUFF AINÕT REAL"
 
 No but that ain't yer game, it ain't even yer race
 You can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face
 You gotta look some other place
 And where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'
 Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'
 Where do you look for this oil well gushin'
 Where do you look for this candle that's glowin'
 Where do you look for this hope that you know is there
 And out there somewhere
 And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads
 Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows
 Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways
 You can touch and twist
 And turn two kinds of doorknobs
 
 You can either go to the church of your choice
 Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital
 You'll find God in the church of your choice
 You'll find Woody Guthrie in the Brooklyn State Hospital
 
 And though it's only my opinion
 I may be right or wrong
 You'll find them both
 In the Grand Canyon
 At sundown
   

 LAY DOWN YOUR WEARY TUNE
                                       
 Lay down your weary tune, lay down,
 Lay down the song you strum,
 And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
 No voice can hope to hum.
 
 Struck by the sounds before the sun,
 I knew the night had gone.
 The morning breeze like a bugle blew
 Against the drums of dawn.
 Lay down your weary tune, lay down,
 Lay down the song you strum,
 And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
 No voice can hope to hum.
 
 The ocean wild like an organ played,
 The seaweed's wove its strands.
 The crashin' waves like cymbals clashed
 Against the rocks and sands.
 Lay down your weary tune, lay down,
 Lay down the song you strum,
 And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
 No voice can hope to hum.
 
 I stood unwound beneath the skies
 And clouds unbound by laws.
 The cryin' rain like a trumpet sang
 And asked for no applause.
 Lay down your weary tune, lay down,
 Lay down the song you strum,
 And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
 No voice can hope to hum.
 
 The last of leaves fell from the trees
 And clung to a new love's breast.
 The branches bare like a banjo played
 To the winds that listened best.
 
 I gazed down in the river's mirror
 And watched its winding strum.
 The water smooth ran like a hymn
 And like a harp did hum.
 Lay down your weary tune, lay down,
 Lay down the song you strum,
 And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
 No voice can hope to hum.
    

 LAY, LADY, LAY
                                       
 Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
 Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
 Whatever colors you have in your mind
 I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine
 
 Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
 Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
 Until the break of day, let me see you make him smile
 His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean
 And you're the best thing that he's ever seen
 
 Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
 Why wait any longer for the world to begin
 You can have your cake and eat it too
 Why wait any longer for the one you love
 When he's standing in front of you
 
 Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
 Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead
 I long to see you in the morning light
 I long to reach for you in the night
 Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead
    

 LEGIONNAIRE'S DISEASE
                                       
 Some say it was radiation, some say there was acid on the microphone,
 Some say a combination that turned their hearts to stone,
 But whatever it was, it drove them to their knees.
 Oh, Legionnaire's disease.

 I wish I had a dollar for everyone that died within that year,
 Got 'em hot by the collar, plenty an old maid shed a tear,
 Now within my heart, it sure put on a squeeze.
 Oh, that Legionnaire's disease.

 Granddad fought in a revolutionary war, father in the War of 1812,
 Uncle fought in Vietnam and then he fought a war all by himself,
 But whatever it was, it came out of the trees.
 Oh, that Legionnaire's disease.
   

 LENNY BRUCE
                                       
 Lenny Bruce is dead but his ghost lives on and on
 Never did get any Golden Globe award, never made it to Synanon.
 He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
 More of an outlaw than you ever were.
 Lenny Bruce is gone but his spirit's livin' on and on.
 
 Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out
 But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was
     talkin' about.
 Never robbed any churches nor cut off any babies' heads,
 He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
 He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
 
 Lenny Bruce is dead but he didn't commit any crime
 He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
 I rode with him in a taxi once, only for a mile and a half,
 Seemed like it took a couple of months.
 Lenny Bruce moved on and like the ones that killed him, gone.
 
 They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules
 He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
 They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
 He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
 Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
   

 LEOPARD-SKIN PILL-BOX HAT
                                       
 Well, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
 Yes, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
 Well, you must tell me, baby
 How your head feels under somethin' like that
 Under your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat

 Well, you look so pretty in it
 Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
 Yes, I just wanna see
 If it's really that expensive kind
 You know it balances on your head
 Just like a mattress balances
 On a bottle of wine
 Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
 
 Well, if you wanna see the sun rise
 Honey, I know where
 We'll go out and see it sometime
 We'll both just sit there and stare
 Me with my belt
 Wrapped around my head
 And you just sittin' there
 In your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
 
 Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you
 It's bad for your health, he said
 Yes, I disobeyed his orders
 I came to see you
 But I found him there instead
 You know, I don't mind him cheatin' on me
 But I sure wish he'd take that off his head
 Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
 
 Well, I see you got a new boyfriend
 You know, I never seen him before
 Well, I saw him
 Makin' love to you
 You forgot to close the garage door
 You might think he loves you for your money
 But I know what he really loves you for
 It's your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
   

 LET'S KEEP IT BETWEEN US
                                       
 Let's keep it between us.
 These people meddlin' in our affairs, they're not our friends.
 Let's keep it between us
 Before doors close and our togetherness comes to an end.
 They'll turn you against me and me against you 'til we don't know who to
     trust.
 Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?

 Let's keep it between us.
 We've been through too much tough times that they never shared.
 They've had nothing to say to us before,
 Now all of a sudden it's as if they've always cared.
 All we need is honesty, a little humility and trust.
 Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
 
 I know we're not perfect
 Then again, neither are they
 They act like we got to live for them as if there just ain't no other way
 And it's makin' me kind of tired.
 
 Can we just lay back for a moment
 Before we wake up and find ourselves in a daze that's got us out of our
     minds?
 There must be something we're overlooking here,
 We better drop down now and get back behind the lines.
 There's some things not fit for human ears, some things don't need to be
     discussed.
 Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?

 They'll tell you one thing and me another
 'Til we don't know who to trust.
 Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
 
 Let's keep it between us
 Before it all snaps and goes too far.
 If we can't deal with this by ourselves,
 Tell me we ain't worse off than they think we are.
 Backseat drivers don't know the feel of the wheel, but they sure know how
     to make a fuss.
 Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
 Can we keep it between us?
   

 LET ME DIE IN MY FOOTSTEPS
                                       
 I will not go down under the ground
 "Cause somebody tells me that death's comin' 'round
 An' I will not carry myself down to die
 When I go to my grave my head will be high,
 Let me die in my footsteps
 Before I go down under the ground.

 There's been rumors of war and wars that have been
 The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind
 And some people thinkin' that the end is close by
 "Stead of learnin' to live they are learning to die.
 Let me die in my footsteps
 Before I go down under the ground.
 
 I don't know if I'm smart but I think I can see
 When someone is pullin' the wool over me
 And if this war comes and death's all around
 Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
 Let me die in my footsteps
 Before I go down under the ground.
 
 There's always been people that have to cause fear
 They've been talking of the war now for many long years
 I have read all their statements and I've not said a word
 But now Lawd God, let my poor voice be heard.
 Let me die in my footsteps
 Before I go down under the ground.
 
 If I had rubies and riches and crowns
 I'd buy the whole world and change things around
 I'd throw all the guns and the tanks in the sea
 For they are mistakes of a past history.
 Let me die in my footsteps
 Before I go down under the ground.
 
 Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood
 Let me smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood
 Let me sleep in your meadows with the green grassy leaves
 Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace.
 Let me die in my footsteps
 Before I go down under the ground.
 
 Go out in your country where the land meets the sun
 See the craters and the canyons where the waterfalls run
 Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho
 Let every state in this union seep in your souls.
 And you'll die in your footsteps
 Before you go down under the ground.
   

 LICENSE TO KILL
                                       
 Man thinks 'cause he rules the earth he can do with it as he please
 And if things don't change soon, he will.
 Oh, man has invented his doom,
 First step was touching the moon.

 Now, there's a woman on my block,
 She just sit there as the night grows still.
 She say who gonna take away his license to kill?
 
 Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
 And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill,
 Then they bury him with stars,
 Sell his body like they do used cars.
 
 Now, there's a woman on my block,
 She just sit there facin' the hill.
 She say who gonna take away his license to kill?
 
 Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused,
 And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
 All he believes are his eyes
 And his eyes, they just tell him lies.
 
 But there's a woman on my block,
 Sitting there in a cold chill.
 She say who gonna take away his license to kill?
 
 Ya may be a noisemaker, spirit maker,
 Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
 Leave no stone unturned.
 May be an actor in a plot,
 That might be all that you got
 'Til your error you clearly learn.
 
 Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
 And when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
 Oh, man is opposed to fair play,
 He wants it all and he wants it his way.
 
 Now, there's a woman on my block,
 She just sit there as the night grows still.
 She say who gonna take away his license to kill?
    

 LILY, ROSEMARY AND THE JACK OF HEARTS
                                       
 The festival was over, the boys were all plannin' for a fall,
 The cabaret was quiet except for the drillin' in the wall.
 The curfew had been lifted and the gamblin' wheel shut down,
 Anyone with any sense had already left town.
 He was standin' in the doorway lookin' like the Jack of Hearts.

 He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
 Then everyone commenced to do what they were doin' before he turned their
     heads.
 Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
 "Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
 Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts.
 
 Backstage the girls were playin' five-card stud by the stairs,
 Lily had two queens, she was hopin' for a third to match her pair.
 Outside the streets were fillin' up, the window was open wide,
 A gentle breeze was blowin', you could feel it from inside.
 Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts.
 
 Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
 He made his usual entrance lookin' so dandy and so fine.
 With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
 He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste.
 But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts.
 
 Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
 She slipped in through the side door lookin' like a queen without a crown.
 She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
 "Sorry, darlin', that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear.
 He was starin' into space over at the Jack of Hearts.
 
 "I know I've seen that face before," Big Jim was thinkin' to himself,
 "Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody's shelf."
 But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim
 And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
 Starin' at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts.
 
 Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
 She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she
     smiled.
 She'd come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
 With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere.
 But she'd never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts.
 
 The hangin' judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
 The drillin' in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
 It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
 And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king.
 No, nothin' ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts.
 
 Rosemary started drinkin' hard and seein' her reflection in the knife,
 She was tired of the attention, tired of playin' the role of Big Jim's wife.
 She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
 Was lookin' to do just one good deed before she died.
 She was gazin' to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts.
 
 Lily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away.
 "Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you must
     have known it would someday.
 Be careful not to touch the wall, there's a brand-new coat of paint,
 I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're lookin' like a saint."
 Down the hallway footsteps were comin' for the Jack of Hearts.
 
 The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair.
 "There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the
     air."
 He went to get the hangin' judge, but the hangin' judge was drunk,
 As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk.
 There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts.
 
 Lily's arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch,
 She forgot all about the man she couldn't stand who hounded her so much.
 "I've missed you so," she said to him, and he felt she was sincere,
 But just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear.
 Just another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts.
 
 No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick,
 The door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked.
 And Big Jim was standin' there, ya couldn't say surprised,
 Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes.
 She was with Big Jim but she was leanin' to the Jack of Hearts.
 
 Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
 And cleaned out the bank safe, it's said that they got off with quite a
     haul.
 In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
 For one more member who had business back in town.
 But they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts.
 
 The next day was hangin' day, the sky was overcast and black,
 Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back.
 And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
 The hangin' judge was sober, he hadn't had a drink.
 The only person on the scene missin' was the Jack of Hearts.
 
 The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, "Closed for repair,"
 Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
 She was thinkin' 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
 Thinkin' 'bout Rosemary and thinkin' about the law.
 But, most of all she was thinkin' 'bout the Jack of Hearts.
   

 LITTLE SADIE
                                       
 Went out last night to take a little round.
 I met my little Sadie and I brought her down.
 I ran right home and I went to bed
 With a forty-four smokeless under my head.

 I began to think what a deed I'd done,
 I grabbed my hat and I began to run.
 I made a god run but I ran too slow;
 They overtook me down in Jericho

 Standing on a corner ringin' my bell,
 Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville.
 He said "Young man is you name Brown?
 Remember the night you blowed Little Sadie down."

 "Oh, yes sir, my name is Lee.
 I murdered little Sadie in the first degree.
 First degree and second degree,
 If you've got any papers will you serve them to me?"

 Well they took me down town and they dressed me in black.
 They put me on a train and they brought me back.
 I had no one for to go my bail;
 They crammed me back into the county jail.
 
 The judge and the jury they took their stand.
 The judge had the papers in his right hand.
 Forty-one days, forty-one nights;
 Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
   

 LITTLE MAGGIE
                                       
 Oh, where is little Maggie?
 Over yonder she stands.
 Rifle on her shoulder,
 Six-shooter in her hand.

 How can I ever stand it,
 Just to see them two blue eyes,
 Shinin' like some diamonds,
 Like some diamonds in the sky.

 Rather be in some lonely hollow
 Where the sun don't ever shine,
 Than to see you be another man's darling,
 And to know that you'll never be mine.

 Well, it's march me away to the station
 With my suitcase in my hand.
 Yes, march me away to the station,
 I'm off to some far-distant land.

 Sometimes I have a nickel,
 And sometimes I have a dime.
 Sometimes I have ten dollars,
 Just to pay for little Maggie's wine.

 Pretty flowers are made for blooming,
 Pretty stars are made to shine.
 Pretty girls are made for boy's love,
 Little Maggie was made for mine.

 Well, yonder stands little Maggie
 With a dram glass in her hand,
 She's a drinkin' down her troubles
 Over courtin' some other man.
   

 LIVING THE BLUES
                                       
 Since you've been gone,
 I've been walking around
 With my head bowed down to my shoes.
 I've been living the blues
 Ev'ry night without you.

 I don't have to go far
 To know where you are,
 Strangers all give me the news.
 I've been living the blues
 Ev'ry night without you.

 I think that it's best,
 I soon get some rest
 And forget my pride.
 But I can't deny
 This feeling that I
 Carry for you deep down inside.

 If you see me this way,
 You'd come back and you'd stay,
 Oh, how could you refuse.
 I've been living the blues
 Ev'ry night without you.
   

 LORD PROTECT MY CHILD
                                       
 For his age, he's wise
 He's got his mother's eyes
 There's gladness in his heart
 He's young and he's wild
 My only prayer is, if I can't be there,
 Lord, protect my child
 
 As his youth now unfolds
 He is centuries old
 Just to see him at play makes me smile
 No matter what happens to me
 No matter what my destiny
 Lord, protect my child
 
 While the world is asleep
 You can look at it and weep
 Few things you find are worthwhile
 And though I don't ask for much
 No material things to touch
 Lord, protect my child
 
 He's young and on fire
 Full of hope and desire
 In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled
 If I fall along the way
 And can't see another day
 Lord, protect my child
 
 There'll be a time I hear tell
 When all will be well
 When God and man will be reconciled
 But until men lose their chains
 And righteousness reigns
 Lord, protect my child
   

 LO AND BEHOLD!
                                       
 I pulled out for San Anton',
 I never felt so good.
 My woman said she'd meet me there
 And of course, I knew she would.
 The coachman, he hit me for my hook
 And he asked me my name.
 I give it to him right away,
 Then I hung my head in shame.
 Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
 Lookin' for my lo and behold,
 Get me outa here, my dear man!
 
 I come into Pittsburgh
 At six-thirty flat.
 I found myself a vacant seat
 An' I put down my hat.
 "What's the matter, Molly, dear,
 What's the matter with your mound?"
 "What's it to ya, Moby Dick?
 This is chicken town!"
 Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
 Lookin' for my lo and behold,
 Get me outa here, my dear man!
 
 I bought my girl
 A herd of moose,
 One she could call her own.
 Well, she came out the very next day
 To see where they had flown.
 I'm goin' down to Tennessee,
 Get me a truck 'r somethin'.
 Gonna save my money and rip it up!
 Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
 Lookin' for my lo and behold,
 Get me outa here, my dear man!
 
 Now, I come in on a ferris wheel
 An' boys, I sure was slick.
 I come in like a ton of bricks,
 Laid a few tricks on 'em.
 Goin' back to Pittsburgh,
 Count up to thirty,
 Round that horn and ride that herd,
 Gonna thread up!
 Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
 Lookin' for my lo and behold,
 Get me outa here, my dear man!
   

 LONG AGO, FAR AWAY
                                       
 To preach of peace and brotherhood,
 Oh, what might be the cost!
 A man he did it long ago
 And they hung him on a cross.
 Long ago, far away;
 These things don't happen
 No more, nowadays.
 
 The chains of slaves
 They dragged the ground
 With heads and hearts hung low.
 But it was during Lincoln's time
 And it was long ago.
 Long ago, far away;
 Things like that donÕt happen
 No more, nowadays.
 
 The war guns they went off wild,
 The whole world bled its blood.
 Men's bodies floated on the edge
 Of oceans made of mud.
 Long ago, far away;
 Those kind of things don't happen
 No more, nowadays.
 
 One man had much money,
 One man had not enough to eat,
 One man lived just like a king,
 The other man begged on the street.
 Long ago, far away;
 These things donÕt happen
 No more, nowadays.
 
 One man died of a knife so sharp,
 One man died from the bullet of a gun,
 One man died of a broken heart
 To see the lynchin' of his son.
 Long ago, far away;
 Things like that donÕt happen
 No more, nowadays.
 
 Gladiators killed themselves,
 It was during the Roman times.
 People cheered with bloodshot grins
 As eye and minds went blind.
 Long ago, far away;
 Things like that donÕt happen
 No more, nowadays.

 And to talk of peace and brotherhood,
 Oh, what might be the cost!
 A man he did it long ago
 And they hung him on a cross.
 Long ago, far away;
 Things like that donÕt happen
 No more, nowadays, do they?
   

 THE LONESOME DEATH OF HATTIE CARROLL
                                       
 William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
 With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
 At a Baltimore hotel society gath'rin'.
 And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
 As they rode him in custody down to the station
 And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
 But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
 Take the rag away from your face.
 Now ain't the time for your tears.
 
 William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
 Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
 With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
 And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
 Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
 And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was snarling,
 In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking.
 But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
 Take the rag away from your face.
 Now ain't the time for your tears.
 
 Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen.
 She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
 Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
 And never sat once at the head of the table
 And didn't even talk to the people at the table
 Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
 And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
 Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
 That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
 Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle.
 And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
 But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
 Take the rag away from your face.
 Now ain't the time for your tears.
 
 In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
 To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
 And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
 And that even the nobles get properly handled
 Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
 And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
 Stared at the person who killed for no reason
 Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'.
 And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
 And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance,
 William Zantzinger with a six-month sentence.
 Oh, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
 Bury the rag deep in your face
 For now's the time for your tears.


 LONE PILGRIM
   
 I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay,
 And patiently stood by his tomb,
 When in a low whisper I heard something say:
 How sweetly I sleep here alone.

 The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
 And gathering storms may arise,
 But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
 The tears are all wiped from my eyes.

 The call of my master compelled me from home,
 No kindred or relative nigh.
 I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
 My soul flew to mansions on high.

 Go tell my companion and children most dear
 To weep not for me now I'm gone.
 The same hand that led me through seas most severe
 Has kindly assisted me home.
   

 LONG-DISTANCE OPERATOR
                                       
 Long-distance operator,
 Place this call, it's not for fun.
 Long-distance operator,
 Please, place this call, you know it's not for fun.
 I gotta get a message to my baby,
 You know, she's not just anyone.

 There are thousands in the phone booth,
 Thousands at the gate.
 There are thousands in the phone booth,
 Thousands at the gate.
 Ev'rybody wants to make a long-distance call
 But you know they're just gonna have to wait.

 If a call comes from Louisiana,
 Please, let it ride.
 If a call comes from Louisiana,
 Please, let it ride.
 This phone booth's on fire,
 It's getting hot inside.

 Ev'rybody wants to be my friend,
 But nobody wants to get higher.
 Ev'rybody wants to be my friend,
 But nobody wants to get higher.
 Long-distance operator,
 I believe I'm stranglin' on this telephone wire.
   

 LONG TIME GONE
                                       
 My parents raised me tenderly,
 I was their only son.
 My mind got mixed with ramblin'
 When I was all so young,
 And I left my home the first time
 When I was twelve and one.
 I'm a long time a-comin', Maw,
 An' I'll be a long time gone.
 
 On the western side of Texas,
 On the Texas plains,
 I tried to find a job o'work
 But they said I's young of age.
 My eyes they burned when I heard,
 "Go home where you belong!"
 I'm a long time a-comin',
 An' I'll be a long time gone.

 I remember when I's ramblin'
 Around with the carnival trains,
 Different towns, different people,
 Somehow they're all the same.
 I remember children's faces best,
 I remember travelin' on.
 I'm a long time a-comin',
 I'll be a long time gone.
 
 I once loved a fair young maid
 An' I ain't too big to tell,
 If she broke my heart a single time,
 She broke it ten or twelve.
 I walked and talked all by myself,
 I did not tell no one.
 I'm a long time a-comin', babe,
 An' I'll be a long time gone.

 Many times by the highwayside,
 I tried to flag a ride.
 With bloodshot eyes and gritting teeth,
 I'd watch the cars roll by.
 The empty air hung in my head
 I's thinkin' all day long.
 I'm a long time a-comin',
 An' I'll be a long time gone.
 
 You might see me on your crossroads
 When I'm a-passin' through.
 Remember me how you wished to
 As I'm a-driftin' from your view.
 I ain't got the time to think about it,
 I got too much to get done.
 Well, I'm a long time comin'
 An' I'll be a long time gone.
 
 If I can't help somebody
 With a word or song,
 If I can't show somebody
 They are travelin' wrong.
 But I know I ain't no prophet
 An' I ain't no prophet's son.
 I'm just a long time a-comin'
 An' I'll be a long time gone.
 
 So you can have your beauty,
 It's skin deep and it only lies.
 And you can have your youth,
 It'll rot before your eyes.
 Just give to me my gravestone
 With it clearly carved upon:
 "I's a long time a-comin',
 An' I'll be a long time gone."
   

 LOVE MINUS ZERO/NO LIMIT
                                       
 My love she speaks like silence,
 Without ideals or violence,
 She doesn't have to say she's faithful,
 Yet she's true, like ice, like fire.
 People carry roses,
 Make promises by the hours,
 My love she laughs like the flowers,
 Valentines can't buy her.
 
 In the dime stores and bus stations,
 People talk of situations,
 Read books, repeat quotations,
 Draw conclusions on the wall.
 Some speak of the future,
 My love she speaks softly,
 She knows there's no success like failure
 And that failure's no success at all.
 
 The cloak and dagger dangles,
 Madams light the candles.
 In ceremonies of the horsemen,
 Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
 Statues made of match sticks,
 Crumble into one another,
 My love winks, she does not bother,
 She knows too much to argue or to judge.
 
 The bridge at midnight trembles,
 The country doctor rambles,
 Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
 Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
 The wind howls like a hammer,
 The night blows cold and rainy,
 My love she's like some raven
 At my window with a broken wing.
   

 LOVE IS JUST A FOUR-LETTER WORD
                                       
 Seems like only yesterday
 I left my mind behind
 Down in the Gypsy Cafe«
 With a friend of a friend of mine
 She sat with a baby heavy on her knee
 Yet spoke of life most free from slavery
 With eyes that showed no trace of misery
 A phrase in connection first with she I heard
 That love is just a four-letter word
 
 Outside a rambling store-front window
 Cats meowed to the break of day
 Me, I kept my mouth shut, too
 To you I had no words to say
 My experience was limited and underfed
 You were talking while I hid
 To the one who was the father of your kid
 You probably didn't think I did, but I heard
 You say that love is just a four-letter word

 I said goodbye unnoticed
 Pushed towards things in my own games
 Drifting in and out of lifetimes
 Unmentionable by name
 Searching for my double, looking for
 Complete evaporation to the core
 Though I tried and failed at finding any door
 I must have thought that there was nothing more
 Absurd than that love is just a four-letter word

 Though I never knew just what you meant
 When you were speaking to your man
 I can only think in terms of me
 And now I understand
 After waking enough times to think I see
 The Holy Kiss that's supposed to last eternity
 Blow up in smoke, its destiny
 Falls on strangers, travels free
 Yes, I know now, traps are only set by me
 And I do not really need to be
 Assured that love is just a four-letter word
   

 LOVE SICK
                                       
 I'm walking,
 Through streets that are dead
 Walking,
 Walking with you in my head

 My feet are so tired
 My brain is so wired
 And the clouds are weeping
 
 Did I,
 Hear someone tell a lie
 Did I,
 Hear someone's distant cry

 I spoke like a child
 You destroyed me with a smile
 While I was sleeping
 
 I'm sick of love
 That I'm in the thick of it
 This kind of love
 I'm so sick of it
 
 I see,
 I see lovers in the meadow
 I see,
 I see silhouettes in the window

 I watch them 'til they're gone
 And they leave me hangin' on
 To a shadow
 
 I'm sick of love
 I hear the clock tick
 This kind of love
 I'm lovesick

 Sometimes
 The silence can be like thunder
 Sometimes
 I wanna take to the road of plunder

 Could you ever be true?
 I think of you and I wonder

 I'm sick of love
 I wish I'd never met you
 I'm sick of love
 I'm tryin' to forget you

 Just don't know what to do
 I'd give anything to be with you
   

 LOVE HENRY
                                       
 "Get down, get down, Love Henry," she cried,
 "And stay all night with me.
 I have gold chains, and the finest I have
 I'll apply them all to thee."
 
 "I can't get down and I shan't get down,
 Or stay all night with thee.
 Some pretty little girl in Cornersville
 I love far better than thee."
 
 He layed his head on a pillow of down.
 Kisses she gave him three.
 With a penny knife that she held in her hand
 She murdered mortal he.

 "Get well, get well, Love Henry, " She cried,
 "Get well, get well," said she.
 "Oh don't you see my own heart's blood
 Come flowin' down so free?"

 She took him by his long yellow hair,
 And also by his feet.
 She plunged him into well water, where
 It runs both cold and deep.

 "Lie there, lie there, Love Henry," she cried,
 "ÔTil the flesh rots off your bones.
 Some pretty little girl in Cornersville
 Will mourn for your return."

 ÒHush up, hush up, my parrot,Ó she cried,
 ÒDonÕt tell no news on me,
 Or these costly beads around my neck,
 IÕll apply them all to thee.

 "Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
 "And light on my right knee.
 The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
 And hung on a willow tree."

 "I won't fly down, I can't fly down
 And light on your right knee.
 A girl who would murder her own true love
 Would kill a little birdlike me."
   

 MAGGIE'S FARM
                                       
 I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
 No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
 Well, I wake in the morning,
 Fold my hands and pray for rain.
 I got a head full of ideas
 That are drivin' me insane.
 It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
 I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
 
 I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
 No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
 Well, he hands you a nickel,
 He hands you a dime,
 He asks you with a grin
 If you're havin' a good time,
 Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
 I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
 
 I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
 No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
 Well, he puts his cigar
 Out in your face just for kicks.
 His bedroom window
 It is made out of bricks.
 The National Guard stands around his door.
 Ah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
 
 I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
 No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
 Well, she talks to all the servants
 About man and God and law.
 Everybody says
 She's the brains behind pa.
 She's sixty-eight, but she says she's twenty-four.
 I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
 
 I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
 No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
 Well, I try my best
 To be just like I am,
 But everybody wants you
 To be just like them.
 They sing while you slave and I just get bored.
 I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
   

 MAN IN THE LONG BLACK COAT
   
 Crickets are chirpin', the water is high,
 There's a soft cotton dress on the line hangin' dry,
 Window wide open, African trees
 Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
 Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
 She gone with the man
 In the long black coat.
 
 Somebody seem him hanging around
 At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
 He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
 If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
 Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote
 There was dust on the man
 In the long black coat.
 
 Preacher was a talkin', there's a sermon he gave,
 He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
 You cannot depend on it to be your guide
 When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
 It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
 She gave her heart to the man
 In the long black coat.
 
 There are no mistakes in life some people say
 It is true sometimes you can see it that way.
 But people don't live or die, people just float.
 She went with the man
 In the long black coat.
 
 There's smoke on the water, it's been there since June,
 Tree trunks uprooted, 'neath the high crescent moon
 Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force
 Somebody is out there beating a dead horse.
 She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
 She gone with the man
 In the long black coat.
    

 MAN OF CONSTANT SORROW
                                       
 Man of Constant Sorrow,
 I've seen trouble all my days.
 I'll say goodbye to Colorado
 Where I was born and partly raised.

 Your mother says I'm a stranger;
 My face you'll never see no more.
 But there's one promise, darling,
 I'll see you on God's golden shore.

 Through this open world I'm about to ramble,
 Through ice and snows, sleet and rain,
 I'm about to ride that mornin' railroad,
 P'raps I'll die on that train.

 I'm going back to Colorado,
 The place I started from.
 If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
 Honey I never would have come.

 Honey, if you don't think I love you
 Just look what a fool I been.
 And if you don't think I'm sinkin'
 Honey, look what a hole I'm in.

 It's a hard, hard road to travel
 When you can't be satisfied.
 I've got a rope that's hanging o'er me
 And the devil's at my side.
    

 MAN GAVE NAMES TO ALL THE ANIMALS
                                       
 Man gave names to all the animals
 In the beginning, in the beginning.
 Man gave names to all the animals
 In the beginning, long time ago.

 He saw an animal that liked to growl,
 Big furry paws and he liked to howl,
 Great big furry back and furry hair.
 "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."

 Man gave names to all the animals
 In the beginning, in the beginning.
 Man gave names to all the animals
 In the beginning, long time ago.

 He saw an animal up on a hill
 Chewing up so much grass until she was filled.
 He saw milk comin' out but he didn't know how.
 "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."

 Man gave names to all the animals
 In the beginning, in the beginning.
 Man gave names to all the animals
 In the beginning, long time ago.

 He saw an animal that liked to snort,
 Horns on his head and they weren't too short.
 It looked like there wasn't nothin' that he couldn't pull.
 "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."

 Man gave names to all the animals
 In the beginning, in the beginning.
 Man gave names to all the animals
 In the beginning, long time ago.

 Real dirty face and a curly tail.

 "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."

 Man gave names to all the animals
 In the beginning, in the beginning.
 Man gave names to all the animals
 In the beginning, long time ago.

 Next animal that he did meet
 Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
 Eating grass on a mountainside so steep.
 "Ah, think I'll call it a sheep."

 Man gave names to all the animals
 In the beginning, in the beginning.
 Man gave names to all the animals
 In the beginning, long time ago.

 He saw an animal as smooth as glass
 Slithering his way through the grass.
 Saw him disappear by a tree near a lake . . .
   

 THE MAN IN ME
                                       
 The man in me will do nearly any task,
 And as for compensation, there's little he would ask.
 Take a woman like you
 To get through to the man in me.

 Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
 I think to myself I might not take it any more.
 Take a woman like your kind
 To find the man in me.
 
 But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
 Just to know that you are near,
 Sets my a heart a-reeling
 From my toes up to my ears.

 The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein' seen,
 But that's just because he doesn't want to turn into some machine.
 Took a woman like you
 To get through to the man in me.
   

 MAN ON THE STREET
                                       
 I'll sing you a song, ain't very long,
 ÔBout an old man who never done wrong.
 How he died nobody can say,
 They found him dead in the street one day.

 Well, the crowd, they gathered one fine morn,
 At the man whose clothes 'n' shoes were torn.
 There on the sidewalk he did lay,
 They stopped 'n' stared 'n' walked their way.

 Well, the p'liceman come and he looked around,
 "Get up, old man, or I'm a-takin' you down."
 He jabbed him once with his billy club
 And the old man then rolled off the curb.

 Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
 "Call the wagon; this man is dead."
 The wagon come, they loaded him in,
 I never saw the man again.

 I've sung you my song, it ain't very long,
 ÔBout an old man who never done wrong.
 How he died no one can say,
 They found him dead in the street one day.
   

 MAN OF PEACE
                                       
 Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch,
 The band is playing "Dixie," a man got his hand outstretched.
 Could be the Fuhrer
 Could be the local priest.
 You know sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.

 He got a sweet gift of gab, he got a harmonious tongue,
 He knows every song of love that ever has been sung.
 Good intentions can be evil,
 Both hands can be full of grease.
 You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.

 Well, first he's in the background, then he's in the front,
 Both eyes are looking like they're on a rabbit hunt.
 Nobody can see through him,
 No, not even the Chief of Police.
 You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.
 
 Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
 Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
 He could be standing next to you,
 The person that you'd notice least.
 I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.

 Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
 He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
 I can smell something cooking,
 I can tell there's going to be a feast.
 You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.

 He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
 He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
 He'll put both his arms around you,
 You can feel the tender touch of the beast.
 You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.

 Well, the howling wolf will howl tonight, the king snake will crawl,
 Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
 Wanna get married? Do it now,
 Tomorrow all activity will cease.
 You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.

 Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
 She's holding them little white shoes and that little broken toy
 And he's following a star,
 The same one them three men followed from the East.
 I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.
   

 MASTERS OF WAR
                                       
 Come you masters of war
 You that build all the guns
 You that build the death planes
 You that build the big bombs
 You that hide behind walls
 You that hide behind desks
 I just want you to know
 I can see through your masks
 
 You that never done nothin'
 But build to destroy
 You play with my world
 Like it's your little toy
 You put a gun in my hand
 And you hide from my eyes
 And you turn and run farther
 When the fast bullets fly
 
 Like Judas of old
 You lie and deceive
 A world war can be won
 You want me to believe
 But I see through your eyes
 And I see through your brain
 Like I see through the water
 That runs down my drain
 
 You fasten the triggers
 For the others to fire
 Then you set back and watch
 When the death count gets higher
 You hide in your mansion
 As young people's blood
 Flows out of their bodies
 And is buried in the mud
 
 You've thrown the worst fear
 That can ever be hurled
 Fear to bring children
 Into the world
 For threatening my baby
 Unborn and unnamed
 You ain't worth the blood
 That runs in your veins
 
 How much do I know
 To talk out of turn
 You might say that I'm young
 You might say I'm unlearned
 But there's one thing I know
 Though I'm younger than you
 Even Jesus would never
 Forgive what you do
 
 Let me ask you one question
 Is your money that good
 Will it buy you forgiveness
 Do you think that it could
 I think you will find
 When your death takes its toll
 All the money you made
 Will never buy back your soul
 
 And I hope that you die
 And your death'll come soon
 I will follow your casket
 In the pale afternoon
 And I'll watch while you're lowered
 Down to your deathbed
 And I'll stand o'er your grave
 'Til I'm sure that you're dead
   

 MAYBE SOMEDAY
                                       
 Maybe someday you'll be satisfied
 When you've lost everything you'll have nothing left to hide.
 When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the
     tracks,
 Maybe you'll beg me to take you back.
 Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
 Maybe then you'll realize what it would have taken to keep me cool.
 Maybe someday when you're by yourself alone
 You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
 
 Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
 You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned.
 You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
 And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
 Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
 Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
 Maybe someday, you will understand
 That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
 
 Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
 When there was blood on the moon in the cotton belt.
 When both of us, baby, were going though some sort of a test
 Neither one of us could do what we do best.
 I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff.
 I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
 Maybe someday, you'll believe me when I say
 That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
 
 Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high
 Sayin' "For whose sake did you live, for whose sake did you die?"
 Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do
 For not breakin' down no bedroom door to get at you.
 Always was a sucker for the right cross.
 Never wanted to go home 'til the last cent was lost.
 Maybe someday you will look back and see
 That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
 
 Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell.
 I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
 Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike.
 There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
 You said you were going' to Frisco, stay a couple of months.
 I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
 Maybe someday you'll see that it's true
 There was no greater love than what I had for you.
    

 MAMA, YOU BEEN ON MY MIND
                                       
 Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
 An' cov'rin' the crossroads I'm standing at,
 Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
 But mama, you been on my mind.
 
 I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
 I am not pleadin' or sayin', "I can't forget."
 I do not walk the floor bowed down an' bent, but yet,
 Mama, you been on my mind.

 Even though my mind is hazy an' my thoughts they might be narrow,
 Where you been don't bother me nor bring me down in sorrow.
 It don't even matter to me where you're wakin' up tomorrow,
 But mama, you're just on my mind.

 I am not askin' you to say words like "yes" or "no,"
 Please understand me, I got no place for you t' go.
 I'm just breathin' to myself, pretendin' not that I don't know,
 Mama, you been on my mind.

 When you wake up in the mornin', baby, look inside your mirror.
 You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near.
 I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
 As someone who has had you on his mind.
    

 MEET ME IN THE MORNING
                                       
 Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha
 Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha
 Honey, we could be in Kansas
 By time the snow begins to thaw.

 They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
 They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
 But you wouldn't know it by me
 Every day's been darkness since you been gone.

 Little rooster crowin', there must be something on his mind
 Little rooster crowin', there must be something on his mind
 Well, I feel just like that rooster
 Honey, ya treat me so unkind.

 The birds are flyin' low babe, honey I feel so exposed
 Well, the birds are flyin' low babe, honey I feel so exposed
 Well now, I ain't got any matches
 And the station doors are closed.

 Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above
 Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above
 Well, you know I even outran the hound dogs
 Honey, you know I've earned your love.

 Look at the sun sinkin' like a ship
 Look at the sun sinkin' like a ship
 Ain't that just like my heart, babe
 When you kissed my lips?


 MILLION DOLLAR BASH
                                       
 Well, that big dumb blonde
 With her wheel in the gorge
 And Turtle, that friend of theirs
 With his checks all forged
 And his cheeks in a chunk
 With his cheese in the cash
 They're all gonna be there
 At that million dollar bash
 Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
 Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
 It's that million dollar bash

 Ev'rybody from right now
 To over there and back
 The louder they come
 The harder they crack
 Come now, sweet cream
 Don't forget to flash
 We're all gonna meet
 At that million dollar bash
 Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
 Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
 It's that million dollar bash
 
 Well, I took my counselor
 Out to the barn
 Silly Nelly was there
 She told him a yarn
 Then along came Jones
 Emptied the trash
 Ev'rybody went down
 To that million dollar bash
 Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
 Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
 It's that million dollar bash
  
 Well, I'm hittin' it too hard
 My stones won't take
 I get up in the mornin'
 But it's too early to wake
 First it's hello, goodbye
 Then push and then crash
 But we're all gonna make it
 At that million dollar bash
 Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
 Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
 It's that million dollar bash
 
 Well, I looked at my watch
 I looked at my wrist
 Punched myself in the face
 With my fist
 I took my potatoes
 Down to be mashed
 Then I made it over
 To that million dollar bash
 Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
 Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
 It's that million dollar bash
   

 MILLION MILES
   
 You took a part of me that I really miss
 I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this
 You told yourself a lie
 Thats alright mama I told myself one too
 I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you
 
 You took the silver, you took the gold
 You left me standing out in the cold
 People asked about you, I didn't tell them everything I knew
 Well I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you
 
 I'm driftin' in and out of dreamless sleep
 Somehow my memory's in a ditch so deep
 Did so many things I never did intend to do
 And I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you
 
 I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low
 I need every bit of it for the places that I go
 Sometimes I wonder, tell us just what its all coming to
 Well I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you

 Well I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink
 Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think
 Feel like talking to somebody but I just don't know who
 Well I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you

 Yes the last thing you said before you hit the street
 Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet
 I said thats alright mama you, you do what you gotta do
 Well I try to get closer I'm still a million miles from you

 Rock me pretty baby rock me all at once, rock me for a little while
 Rock me for a couple of months
 And I'll rock you too
 I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you

 Well there's voices in the night trying to be heard
 I'm sittin' here listenin' to every mind-pollutin' word
 I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two
 Yes I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you


 MINSTREL BOY
                                       
 Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
 Who's gonna let it roll?
 Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
 Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?

 Oh, Lucky's been drivin' a long, long time
 And now he's stuck on top of the hill.
 With twelve forward gears, it's been a long hard climb,
 And with all of them ladies, though, he's lonely still.

 Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
 Who's gonna let it roll?
 Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
 Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
 
 Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
 Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load.
 Beneath his bound'ries, what more can I tell,
 With all of his trav'lin', but I'm still on that road.
 
 Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
 Who's gonna let it roll?
 Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
 Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
   

 MIXED UP CONFUSION
                                       
 I got mixed up confusion
 Man, it's a-killin' me
 
 Well, there's too many people
 And they're all too hard to please

 Well, my hat's in my hand
 Babe, I'm walkin' down the line

 An' I'm lookin' for a woman
 Whose head's mixed up like mine

 Well, my head's full of questions
 My temp'rature's risin' fast
 
 Well, I'm lookin' for some answers
 But I don't know who to ask
 
 But I'm walkin' and wonderin'
 And my poor feet don't ever stop
 
 Seein' my reflection
 I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
   

 MOST LIKELY YOU GO YOUR WAY
 (And I'll Go Mine)
                                       
 You say you love me
 And you're thinkin' of me,
 But you know you could be wrong.
 You say you told me
 That you wanna hold me,
 But you know you're not that strong.
 I just can't do what I done before,
 I just can't beg you any more.
 I'm gonna let you pass
 And I'll go last.
 Then time will tell just who fell
 And who's been left behind,
 When you go your way and I go mine.

 You say you disturb me
 And you don't deserve me,
 But you know sometimes you lie.
 You say you're shakin'
 And you're always achin',
 But you know how hard you try.
 Sometimes it gets so hard to care,
 It can't be this way ev'rywhere.
 And I'm gonna let you pass,
 Yes, and I'll go last.
 Then time will tell just who fell
 And who's been left behind,
 When you go your way and I go mine.
 
 The judge, he holds a grudge,
 He's gonna call on you.
 But he's badly built
 And he walks on stilts,
 Watch out he don't fall on you.
 
 You say you're sorry
 For tellin' stories
 That you know I believe are true.
 You say ya got some
 Other kinda lover
 And yes, I believe you do.
 You say my kisses are not like his,
 But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
 I'm just gonna let you pass,
 Yes, and I'll go last.
 Then time will tell who fell
 And who's been left behind,
 When you go your way and I go mine.
   

 MONEY BLUES
                                       
 Sittin' here thinkin'
 Where does the money go
 Sittin' here thinkin'
 Where does the money go
 Well, I give it to my woman
 She ain't got it no more
 
 Went out last night
 Bought two eggs and a slice of ham
 Went out last night
 Bought two eggs and a slice of ham
 Bill came to three dollars and ten cents
 And I didn't even get no jam
 
 Man came around
 Askin' for the rent
 Man came around
 Askin' for the rent
 Well, I looked into the drawer
 But the money's all been spent

 Well, well
 Ain't got no bank account
 Went down to start one
 But I didn't have the right amount
 
 Everything's inflated
 Like a tire on a car
 Everything's inflated
 Like a tire on a car
 Well, the man came and took my Chevy back
 I'm glad I hid my old guitar
 
 Come to me, mama
 Ease my money crisis now
 Come to me, mama
 Ease my money crisis now
 I need something to support me.
   

 MOONSHINER
                                       
 I've been a moonshiner
 For seventeen long years
 I've spent all my money
 On whiskey and beer
 
 I'll go to some hollow
 And set up my still
 And if whiskey don't kill
 Then I don't know what will
 
 I'll go to some bar room
 And drink with my friends
 Where the women can't follow
 And see what I spend
 
 God bless them pretty women
 I wish they were mine
 Their breath is as sweet as
 The dew on the vine
 
 Let me eat when I'm  hungry
 Let me drink when I'm dry
 Dollars when I'm hard up
 Religion when I die
 
 The whole world's a bottle
 And life's but a dram
 When a bottle gets empty
 It sure ain't worth a damm
   

 MOST OF THE TIME
                                       
 Most of the time
 I'm clear focused all around,
 Most of the time
 I can keep both feet on the ground,
 I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
 Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
 I can handle whatever I stumble upon.
 I don't even notice she's gone,
 Most of the time.
 
 Most of the time
 It's well understood,
 Most of the time
 I wouldn't change it if I could,
 I can't make it all match up, I can hold my own,
 I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
 I can survive, I can endure
 And I don't even think about her
 Most of the time.

 Most of the time
 My head is on straight,
 Most of the time
 I'm strong enough not to hate.
 I don't build up illusion 'til it makes me sick,
 I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick.
 I can smile in the face of mankind.
 Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
 Most of the time.

 Most of the time
 She ain't even in my mind,
 I wouldn't know her if I saw her,
 She's that far behind.
 Most of the time
 I can't even be sure
 If she was ever with me
 Or if I was with her.
 
 Most of the time
 I'm halfway content,
 Most of the time
 I know exactly where it went,
 I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
 Hide from the feelings that are buried inside.
 I don't compromised and I don't pretend,
 I don't even care if I ever see her again
 Most of the time.
   

 MOTORPSYCHO NIGHTMARE
                                       
 I pounded on a farmhouse
 Lookin' for a place to stay.
 I was mighty, mighty tired,
 I had gone a long, long way.
 I said, "Hey, hey, in there,
 Is there anybody home?"
 I was standin' on the steps
 Feelin' most alone.
 Well, out comes a farmer,
 He must have thought that I was nuts.
 He immediately looked at me
 And stuck a gun into my guts.
 
 I fell down
 To my bended knees,
 Saying, "I dig farmers,
 Don't shoot me, please!"
 He cocked his rifle
 And began to shout,
 "You're that travelin' salesman
 That I have heard about."
 I said, "No! No! No!
 I'm a doctor and it's true,
 I'm a clean-cut kid
 And I been to college, too."
 
 Then in comes his daughter
 Whose name was Rita.
 She looked like she stepped out of
 La Dolce Vita.
 I immediately tried to cool it
 With her dad,
 And told him what a
 Nice, pretty farm he had.
 He said, "What do doctors
 Know about farms, pray tell?"
 I said, "I was born
 At the bottom of a wishing well."
 
 Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails
 I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
 "I guess you're tired,"
 He said, kinda sly.
 I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles
 Today I drove."
 He said, "I got a bed for you
 Underneath the stove.
 Just one condition
 And you go to sleep right now,
 That you don't touch my daughter
 And in the morning, milk the cow."
 
 I was sleepin' like a rat
 When I heard something jerkin'.
 There stood Rita
 Lookin' just like Tony Perkins.
 She said, "Would you like to take a shower?
 I'll show you up to the door."
 I said, "Oh, no! no!
 I've been through this before."
 I knew I had to split
 But I didn't know how,
 When she said,
 "Would you like to take that shower, now?"
 
 Well, I couldn't leave
 Unless the old man chased me out,
 'Cause I'd already promised
 That I'd milk his cows.
 I had to say something
 To strike him very weird,
 So I yelled out,
 "I like Fidel Castro and his beard."
 Rita looked offended
 But she got out of the way,
 As he came charging down the stairs
 Sayin', "What's that I heard you say?"
 
 I said, "I like Fidel Castro,
 I think you heard me right,"
 And ducked as he swung
 At me with all his might.
 Rita mumbled something
 'Bout her mother on the hill,
 As his fist hit the icebox,
 He said he's going to kill me
 If I don't get out the door
 In two seconds flat,
 "You unpatriotic,
 Rotten doctor Commie rat."
 
 Well, he threw a Reader's Digest
 At my head and I did run,
 I did a somersault
 As I seen him get his gun
 And crashed through the window
 At a hundred miles an hour,
 And landed fully blast
 In his garden flowers.
 Rita said, "Come back!"
 As he started to load
 The sun was comin' up
 And I was runnin' down the road.
 
 Well, I don't figure I'll be back
 There for a spell,
 Even though Rita moved away
 And got a job in a motel.
 He still waits for me,
 Constant, on the sly.
 He wants to turn me in
 To the F.B.I.
 Me, I romp and stomp,
 Thankful as I romp,
 Without freedom of speech,
 I might be in the swamp.
   

 MOZAMBIQUE
                                       
 I like to spend some time in Mozambique
 The sunny sky is aqua blue
 And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek.
 It's very nice to stay a week or two.

 There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
 And plenty time for good romance
 And everybody likes to stop and speak
 To give the special one you seek a chance
 Or maybe say hello with just a glance.

 Lying next to her by the ocean
 Reaching out and touching her hand,
 Whispering your secret emotion
 Magic in a magical land.

 And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
 To say goodbye to sand and sea,
 You turn around to take a final peek
 And you see why it's so unique to be
 Among the lovely people living free
 Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
   

 MR. TAMBOURINE MAN
                                       
 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
 I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
 In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.

 Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into sand,
 Vanished from my hand,
 Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.
 My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
 I have no one to meet
 And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.

 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
 I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
 In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.
 
 Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship,
 My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,
 My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
 To be wanderin'.
 I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
 Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,
 I promise to go under it.
 
 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
 I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
 In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.
 
 Though you might hear laughin', spinnin', swingin' madly across the sun,
 It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run
 And but for the sky there are no fences facin'.
 And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
 To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind,
 I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're
 Seein' that he's chasing.

 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
 I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
 In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.

 Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind,
 Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
 The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
 Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
 Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
 Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
 With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
 Let me forget about today until tomorrow.

 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
 I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
 In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.
   

 MY BACK PAGES
                                       
 Crimson flames tied through my ears
 Rollin' high and mighty traps
 Pounced with fire on flaming roads
 Using ideas as my maps
 "We'll meet on edges, soon," said I
 Proud 'neath heated brow.
 Ah, but I was so much older then,
 I'm younger than that now.
 
 Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
 "Rip down all hate," I screamed
 Lies that life is black and white
 Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
 Romantic facts of musketeers
 Foundationed deep, somehow.
 Ah, but I was so much older then,
 I'm younger than that now.
 
 Girls' faces formed the forward path
 From phony jealousy
 To memorizing politics
 Of ancient history
 Flung down by corpse evangelists
 Unthought of, though, somehow.
 Ah, but I was so much older then,
 I'm younger than that now.
 
 A self-ordained professor's tongue
 Too serious to fool
 Spouted out that liberty
 Is just equality in school
 "Equality," I spoke the word
 As if a wedding vow.
 Ah, but I was so much older then,
 I'm younger than that now.
 
 In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
 At the mongrel dogs who teach
 Fearing not that I'd become my enemy
 In the instant that I preach
 My pathway led by confusion boats
 Mutiny from stern to bow.
 Ah, but I was so much older then,
 I'm younger than that now.
 
 Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
 Too noble to neglect
 Deceived me into thinking
 I had something to protect
 Good and bad, I define these terms
 Quite clear, no doubt, somehow.
 Ah, but I was so much older then,
 I'm younger than that now.
   

 MAKE YOU FEEL MY LOVE
                                       
 When the rain is blowing in your face
 And the whole world is on your case
 I could offer a warm embrace
 To make you feel my love

 When evening shadows and the stars appear
 And there is no one there to dry your tears
 I could hold you for a million years
 To make you feel my love

 I know you haven't made your mind up yet
 But I would never do you wrong
 I've known it from the moment that we met
 No doubt in my mind where you belong
  
 I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
 I'd go crawling down the avenue
 Oh there's nothing that I wouldn't do
 To make you feel my love
 
 The storms are raging on the rolling sea
 And on the highway of regret
 The winds of change are blowing wild and free
 You ain't seen nothing like me yet

 I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
 Nothing that I wouldn't do
 Go to the ends of the earth for you
 To make you feel my love
   

 NEED A WOMAN
                                       
 It's been raining in the trenches all day long, dripping down to my clothes,
 My patience is wearing thin, got a fire inside my nose.
 Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
 The truth is I might drown before I find it.

 Well I need a woman, yes I do
 Need a woman, yes I do.
 Someone who can see me as I am,
 Somebody who just don't give a damn.
 And I want you to be that woman every night,
 Be that woman.

 I've had my eyes on you baby for about five long years,
 You probably don't know me at all, but I have seen your laughter and tears.
 Now you don't frighten me, my heart is jumping
 And you look like it wouldn't hurt you none to have a man who could give ya
     something.

 Well I need a woman, oh don't I
 Need a woman, bring it home safe at last.
 Seen you turn the corner, seen your bootheels spark,
 Seen you in the daylight, and watched you in the dark.
 And I want you to be that woman, all right
 Be that woman every night.

 Well, if you believe in something long enough you just naturally come to
     think it's true.
 There ain't no wall you can't cross over, ain't no fire you can't walk
     through.
 Well, believing is all right, just don't let the wrong people know what it's
     all about.
 They might put the evil eye on you, use their hidden powers to try to turn
     you out.

 Well I need a woman, just to be my queen.
 Need a woman, know what I mean?
   

 NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY
                                       
 Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
 His enemies say he's on their land.
 They got him outnumbered about a million to one,
 He got no place to escape to, no place to run.
 He's the neighborhood bully.

 The neighborhood bully just lives to survive,
 He's criticized and condemned for being alive.
 He's not supposed to fight back, he's supposed to have thick skin,
 He's supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
 He's the neighborhood bully.

 The neighborhood bully been driven out of every land,
 He's wandered the earth an exiled man.
 Seen his family scattered, his people hounded and torn,
 He's always on trial for just being born.
 He's the neighborhood bully.

 Well, he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
 Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
 Then he destroyed a bomb factory, nobody was glad.
 The bombs were meant for him. He was supposed to feel bad.
 He's the neighborhood bully.

 Well, the chances are against it and the odds are slim
 That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him,
 'Cause there's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
 And a license to kill him is given out to every maniac.
 He's the neighborhood bully.

 He got no allies to really speak of.
 What he gets he must pay for, he don't get it out of love.
 He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied
 But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
 He's the neighborhood bully.

 Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
 They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed must cease.
 Now, they wouldn't hurt a fly. To hurt one they would weep.
 They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
 He's the neighborhood bully.

 Every empire that's enslaved him is gone,
 Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
 He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
 In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
 He's the neighborhood bully.

 Now his holiest books have been trampled upon,
 No contract he signed was worth what it was written on.
 He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
 Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
 He's the neighborhood bully.

 What's anybody indebted to him for?
 Nothin', they say. He just likes to cause war.
 Pride and prejudice and superstition indeed,
 They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
 He's the neighborhood bully.

 What has he done to wear so many scars?
 Does he change the course of rivers? Does he pollute the moon and stars?
 Neighborhood bully, standing on the hill,
 Running out the clock, time standing still,
 Neighborhood bully
   

 NEVER GONNA BE THE SAME AGAIN
                                       
 Now you're here beside me, baby,
 You're a living dream.
 And every time you get this close
 It makes me want to scream.
 You touched me and you knew
 That I was warm for you and then,
 I ain't never gonna be the same again.

 Sorry if I hurt you, baby,
 Sorry if I did.
 Sorry if I touched the place
 Where your secrets are hid.
 But you meant more than everything,
 And I could not pretend,
 I ain't never gonna be the same again.

 You give me something to think about, baby,
 Every time I see ya.
 Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving,
 I'd just like it to be my idea.
 
 You taught me how to love you, baby,
 You taught me, oh, so well.
 Now, I can't go back to what was, baby,
 I can't unring the bell.
 You took my reality
 And cast it to the wind
 And I ain't never gonna be the same again.


 NEVER SAY GOODBYE
                                       
 Twilight on the frozen lake
 North wind about to break
 On footprints in the snow
 Silence down below.

 You're beautiful beyond words
 You're beautiful to me
 You can make me cry
 Never say goodbye.

 Time is all I have to give
 You can have it if you choose
 With me you can live
 Never say goodbye.

 My dreams are made of iron and steel
 With a big bouquet
 Of roses hanging down
 From the heavens to the ground.

 The crashing waves roll over me
 As I stand upon the sand
 Wait for you to come
 And grab hold of my hand.
 
 Oh, baby, baby, baby blue
 You'll change your last name, too
 You've turned your hair to brown
 Love to see it hangin' down.
   

 NEW MORNING
                                       
 Can't you hear that rooster crowin'?
 Rabbit runnin' down across the road
 Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through
 So happy just to see you smile
 Underneath the sky of blue
 On this new morning, new morning
 On this new morning with you.

 Can't you hear that motor turnin'?
 Automobile comin' into style
 Comin' down the road for a country mile or two
 So happy just to see you smile
 Underneath the sky of blue
 On this new morning, new morning
 On this new morning with you.

 The night passed away so quickly
 It always does when you're with me.
 
 Can't you feel that sun a-shinin'?
 Ground hog runnin' by the country stream
 This must be the day that all of my dreams come true
 So happy just to be alive
 Underneath the sky of blue
 On this new morning, new morning
 On this new morning with you.

 So happy just to be alive
 Underneath the sky of blue
 On this new morning, new morning
 On this new morning with you.
 New morning . . .
   

 NEW PONY
                                       
 Once I had a pony, her name was Lucifer
 I had a pony, her name was Lucifer
 She broke her leg and she needed shooting
 I swear it hurt me more than it could ever have hurted her

 Sometimes I wonder what's going on in the mind of Miss X
 Sometimes I wonder what's going on in the mind of Miss X
 You know she got such a sweet disposition
 I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next

 I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace
 Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace
 She got great big hind legs
 And long black shaggy hair above her face

 Well now, it was early in the mornin', I seen your shadow in the door
 It was early in the mornin', I seen your shadow in the door
 Now, I don't have to ask nobody
 I know what you come here for

 They say you're usin' voodoo, your feet walk by themselves
 They say you're usin' voodoo, I seen your feet walk by themselves
 Oh, baby, that god you been prayin' to
 Is gonna give ya back what you're wishin' on someone else

 Come over here pony, I, I wanna climb up one time on you
 Come over here pony, I, I wanna climb up one time on you
 Well, you're so bad and nasty
 But I love you, yes I do
   

 NIGHT AFTER NIGHT
                                       
 Night after night you wander the streets of my mind.
 Night after night don't know what you think you will find.
 No place to go, nowhere to turn,
 Everything around you seems to burn, burn, burn.
 And there's never any mercy night after night.

 Night after night
 Night after night

 Night after night some new plan to blow up the world.
 Night after night another old man kissing some young girl.
 You look for salvation, you find none.
 Just another broken heart, another barrel of a gun,
 Just another stick of dynamite night after night.

 Night after night
 Night after night

 Night after night you drop dead in your bed,
 Night after night another bottle finds a head.
 Night after night I think about cutting you loose
 But I just can't do it, what would be the use?
 So I just keep a holding you tight night after night.

 Night after night
 Night after night
 
 Night after night
 Night after night
   

 NOBODY 'CEPT YOU
                                       
 There's nothing 'round here I believe in
 'Cept you, yeah you
 And there's nothing to me that's sacred
 'Cept you, yeah you

 You're the one that reaches me
 You're the one that I admire
 Every time we meet together
 My soul feels like it's on fire
 Nothing matters to me
 And there's nothing I desire
 'Cept you, yeah you

 Nothing 'round here I care to try for
 'Cept you, yeah you
 Got nothing left to live or die for
 'Cept you, yeah you
 
 There's a hymn I used to hear
 In the churches all the time
 Make me feel so good inside
 So peaceful, so sublime
 And there's nothing to remind me of that
 Old familiar chime
 'Cept you, uh huh you

 Used to play in the cemetery
 Dance and sing and run when I was a child
 Never seemed strange
 But now I just pass mournfully by
 That place where the bones of life are piled
 I know somethin' has changed
 I'm a stranger here and no one sees me
 'Cept you, yeah you

 Nothing much matters or seems to please me
 'Cept you, yeah you
 Nothing hypnotizes me
 Or holds me in a spell
 Everything runs by me
 Just like water from a well
 Everybody wants my attention
 Ev'rybody's got something to sell
 'Cept you, yeah you
   

 NO MORE AUCTION BLOCK
                                       
 No more auction block for me
 No more, no more
 No more auction block for me
 Many thousands gone

 No more driver's lash for me
 No more, no more
 No more driver's lash for me
 Many thousands gone
 
 No more whip lash for me
 No more, no more
 No more pint of salt for me
 Many thousands gone

 No more auction block for me
 No more, no more
 No more auction block for me
 Many thousands gone
   

 NORTH COUNTRY BLUES
                                       
 Come gather 'round friends
 And I'll tell you a tale
 Of when the red iron pits ran plenty.
 But the cardboard filled windows
 And old men on the benches
 Tell you now that the whole town is empty.

 In the north end of town,
 My own children are grown
 But I was raised on the other.
 In the wee hours of youth,
 My mother took sick
 And I was brought up by my brother.

 The iron ore poured
 As the years passed the door,
 The drag lines an' the shovels they was a-humming.
 'Til one day my brother
 Failed to come home
 The same as my father before him.

 Well a long winter's wait,
 From the window I watched.
 My friends they couldn't have been kinder.
 And my schooling was cut
 As I quit in the spring
 To marry John Thomas, a miner.

 Oh the years passed again
 And the givin' was good,
 With the lunch bucket filled every season.
 What with three babies born,
 The work was cut down
 To a half a day's shift with no reason.

 Then the shaft was soon shut
 And more work was cut,
 And the fire in the air, it felt frozen.
 'Til a man come to speak
 And he said in one week
 That number eleven was closin'.
 
 They complained in the East,
 They are paying too high.
 They say that your ore ain't worth digging.
 That it's much cheaper down
 In the South American towns
 Where the miners work almost for nothing.
 
 So the mining gates locked
 And the red iron rotted
 And the room smelled heavy from drinking.
 Where the sad, silent song
 Made the hour twice as long
 As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
 
 I lived by the window
 As he talked to himself,
 This silence of tongues it was building.
 Then one morning's wake,
 The bed it was bare,
 And I's left alone with three children.
 
 The summer is gone,
 The ground's turning cold,
 The stores one by one they're a-foldin'.
 My children will go
 As soon as they grow.
 Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
   

 NOT DARK YET
                                       
 Shadows are falling and I been here all day
 It's too hot to sleep and time is running away
 Feel like my soul has turned into steel
 I've still got the scars that the sun didn'tW heal
 There's not even room enough to be anywhere
 It's not dark yet, but it's getting there

 Well my sense of humanity is going down the drain
 Behind every beautiful thing, there's been some kind of pain
 She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind
 She put down in writin' what was in her mind
 I just don't see why I should even care
 It's not dark yet, but it's getting there

 Well I been to London and I been to gay Paris
 I followed the river and I got to the sea
 I've been down to the bottom of a whirlpool of lies
 I ain't lookin' for nothin' in anyone's eyes
 Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear
 It's not dark yet, but it's getting there
 
 I was born here and I'll die here, against my will
 I know it looks like I'm movin' but I'm standin' still
 Every nerve in my body is so naked and numb
 I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from
 Don't even hear the murmur of a prayer
 It's not dark yet, but it's getting there
   

 NOTHING WAS DELIVERED
                                       
 Nothing was delivered
 And I tell this truth to you,
 Not out of spite or anger
 But simply because it's true.
 Now, I hope you won't object to this,
 Giving back all of what you owe,
 The fewer words you have to waste on this,
 The sooner you can go.
 
 Nothing is better, nothing is best,
 Take heed of this and get plenty of rest.

 Nothing was delivered
 But I can't say I sympathize
 With what your fate is going to be,
 Yes, for telling all those lies.
 Now you must provide some answers
 For what you sell has not been received,
 And the sooner you come up with them,
 The sooner you can leave.
 
 Nothing is better, nothing is best,
 Take heed of this and get plenty rest.
 
 (Now you know)
 Nothing was delivered
 And it's up to you to say
 Just what you had in mind
 When you made ev'rybody pay.
 No, nothing was delivered,
 Yes, 'n' someone must explain
 That as long as it takes to do this
 Then that's how long that you'll remain.
 
 Nothing is better, nothing is best,
 Take heed of this and get plenty rest.
    

 NO TIME TO THINK
                                       
 In death, you face life with a child and a wife
 Who sleep-walks through your dreams into walls.
 You're a soldier of mercy, you're cold and you curse,
 "He who cannot be trusted must fall."

 Loneliness, tenderness, high society, notoriety.
 You fight for the throne and you travel alone
 Unknown as you slowly sink
 And there's no time to think.

 In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity,
 In secret, for pieces of change.
 The empress attracts you but oppression distracts you
 And it makes you feel violent and strange.

 Memory, ecstasy, tyranny, hypocrisy
 Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss
 In the valley of the missing link
 And you have no time to think.

 Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you
 Her worst is better than best.
 I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes
 And I feel so depressed.

 China doll, alcohol, duality, mortality.
 Mercury rules you and destiny fools you
 Like the plague, with a dangerous wink
 And there's no time to think.

 Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you
 Where the lion lies down with the lamb.
 I'd have paid off the traitor and killed him much later
 But that's just the way that I am.

 Paradise, sacrifice, mortality, reality.
 But the magician is quicker and his game
 Is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
 And there's no time to think.

 Anger and jealousy's all that he sells us,
 He's content when you're under his thumb.
 Madmen oppose him, but your kindness throws him
 To survive it you play deaf and dumb.

 Equality, liberty, humility, simplicity.
 You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear
 At the back of your head as you drink
 And there's no time to think.

 Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow
 Will offer their heads for a prayer.
 You can't find no salvation, you have no expectations
 Anytime, anyplace, anywhere.

 Mercury, gravity, nobility, humility.
 You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper
 That is leading you onto the brink
 But there's no time to think.

 You've murdered your vanity, buried your sanity
 For pleasure you must now resist.
 Lovers obey you but they cannot sway you
 They're not even sure you exist.

 Socialism, hypnotism, patriotism, materialism.
 Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws
 And the sound of the keys as they clink
 But there's no time to think.

 The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl
 With the rose in her hair.
 Starlight in the East and you're finally released
 You're stranded but with nothing to share.

 Loyalty, unity, epitome, rigidity.
 You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille
 'Neath the moon shinin' bloody and pink
 And there's no time to think.

 Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you
 But no, you will not be deceived.
 Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt,
 You can give but you cannot receive.

 No time to choose when the truth must die,
 No time to lose or say goodbye,
 No time to prepare for the victim that's there,
 No time to suffer or blink
 And no time to think.
   

 OBVIOUSLY FIVE BELIEVERS
                                       
 Early in the mornin'
 Early in the mornin'
 I'm callin' you to
 I'm callin' you to
 Please come home
 Yes, I guess I could make it without you
 If I just didn't feel so all alone

 Don't let me down
 Don't let me down
 I won't let you down
 I won't let you down
 No I won't
 You know I can if you can, honey
 But, honey, please don't

 I got my black dog barkin'
 Black dog barkin'
 Yes it is now
 Yes it is now
 Outside my yard
 Yes, I could tell you what he means
 If I just didn't have to try so hard

 Your mama's workin'
 Your mama's moanin'
 She's cryin' you know
 She's tryin' you know
 You better go now
 Well, I'd tell you what she wants
 But I just don't know how

 Fifteen jugglers
 Fifteen jugglers
 Five believers
 Five believers
 All dressed like men
 Tell yo' mama not to worry because
 They're just my friends
 
 Early in the mornin'
 Early in the mornin'
 I'm callin' you to
 I'm callin' you to
 Please come home
 Yes, I could make it without you
 If I just did not feel so all alone


 ODDS AND ENDS
                                       
 I plan it all and I take my place
 You break your promise all over the place
 You promised to love me, but what do I see
 Just you comin' and spillin' juice over me
 Odds and ends, odds and ends
 Lost time is not found again
 
 Now, you take your file and you bend my head
 I never can remember anything that you said
 You promised to love me, but what do I know
 You're always spillin' juice on me like you got someplace to go
 Odds and ends, odds and ends
 Lost time is not found again
 
 Now, I've had enough, my box is clean
 You know what I'm sayin' and you know what I mean
 From now on you'd best get on someone else
 While you're doin' it, keep that juice to yourself
 Odds and ends, odds and ends
 Lost time is not found again
   

 OH, SISTER
                                       
 Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms
 You should not treat me like a stranger.
 Our Father would not like the way that you act
 And you must realize the danger.

 Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you
 And one deserving of affection?
 And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
 To love and follow His direction?

 We grew up together
 From the cradle to the grave
 We died and were reborn
 And then mysteriously saved.

 Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
 Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
 Time is an ocean but it ends at the shore
 You may not see me tomorrow.


 ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS
                                       
 On a night like this
 So glad you came around,
 Hold on to me so tight
 And heat up some coffee grounds.
 We got much to talk about
 And much to reminisce,
 It sure is right
 On a night like this.
 
 On a night like this
 So glad you've come to stay
 Hold on to me, pretty miss
 Say you'll never go away to stray.
 Run your fingers down my spine
 Bring me a touch of bliss
 It sure feels right
 On a night like this.
 
 On a night like this
 I can't get any sleep,
 The air is so cold outside
 And the snow's so deep.
 Build a fire, throw on logs
 And listen to it hiss
 And let it burn, burn, burn, burn
 On a night like this.
 
 Put your body next to mine
 And keep me company,
 There is plenty a room for all,
 So please don't elbow me.
 
 Let the four winds blow
 Around this old cabin door,
 If I'm not too far off I think we did this once before.
 There's more frost on the window glass
 With each new tender kiss,
 But it sure feels right
 On a night like this.
   

 ONE MORE CUP OF COFFEE
 (Valley Below)
                                       
 Your breath is sweet
 Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky.
 Your back is straight, your hair is smooth
 On the pillow where you lie.
 But I don't sense affection
 No gratitude or love
 Your loyalty is not to me
 But to the stars above.
 
 One more cup of coffee for the road,
 One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
 To the valley below.
 
 Your daddy he's an outlaw
 And a wanderer by trade
 He'll teach you how to pick and choose
 And how to throw the blade.
 He oversees his kingdom
 So no stranger does intrude
 His voice it trembles as he calls out
 For another plate of food.
 
 One more cup of coffee for the road,
 One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
 To the valley below.
 
 Your sister sees the future
 Like your mama and yourself.
 You've never learned to read or write
 There's no books upon your shelf.
 And your pleasure knows no limits
 Your voice is like a meadowlark
 But your heart is like an ocean
 Mysterious and dark.
 
 One more cup of coffee for the road,
 One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
 To the valley below.
   

 ONE MORE NIGHT
                                       
 One more night, the stars are in sight
 But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
 Oh, the moon is shinin' bright,
 Lighting ev'rything in sight,
 But tonight no light will shine on me.

 Oh, it's shameful and it's sad,
 I lost the only pal I had,
 I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
 I will turn my head up high
 To that dark and rolling sky,
 For tonight no light will shine on me.

 I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true,
 I had no idea what a woman in love would do!
 
 One more night, I will wait for the light
 While the wind blows high above the tree.
 Oh, I miss my darling so,
 I didn't mean to see her go,
 But tonight no light will shine on me.

 One more night, the moon is shinin' bright
 And the wind blows high above the tree.
 Oh, I miss that woman so,
 I didn't mean to see her go,
 But tonight no light will shine on me.


 ONE MORE WEEKEND
 
 Slippin' and slidin' like a weasel on the run,
 I'm lookin' good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun.
 One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
 One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
 
 Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
 We'll fly over the ocean just like you suspect.
 One more weekend, one more weekend with you.
 One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
 
 We'll fly the night away,
 Hang out the whole next day,
 Things will be okay,
 You wait and see.
 We'll go someplace unknown,
 Leave all the children home,
 Honey, why not go alone
 Just you and me.
 
 Comin' and goin' like a rabbit in the wood,
 I'm happy just to see you, yeah, lookin' so good.
 One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
 One more weekend, one more weekend'll do (yes, you will!).
 
 Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
 You're the sweetest gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get.
 One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
 One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.


 ONE TOO MANY MORNINGS
 
 Down the street the dogs are barkin'
 And the day is a-gettin' dark.
 As the night comes in a-fallin',
 The dogs 'll lose their bark.
 An' the silent night will shatter
 From the sounds inside my mind,
 For I'm one too many mornings
 And a thousand miles behind.
 
 From the crossroads of my doorstep,
 My eyes they start to fade,
 As I turn my head back to the room
 Where my love and I have laid.
 An' I gaze back to the street,
 The sidewalk and the sign,
 And I'm one too many mornings
 An' a thousand miles behind.
 
 It's a restless hungry feeling
 That don't mean no one no good,
 When ev'rything I'm a-sayin'
 You can say it just as good.
 You're right from your side,
 I'm right from mine.
 We're both just too many mornings
 An' a thousand miles behind.


 ONLY A HOBO
                                       
 As I was out walking on a corner one day,
 I spied an old hobo, in a doorway he lay.
 His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
 And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.

 Only a hobo, but one more is gone
 Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song
 Leavin' nobody to carry him home
 Only a hobo, but one more is gone

 A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
 As the curb was his pillow, the street was his bed.
 One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
 And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.

 Only a hobo, but one more is gone
 Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song
 Leavin' nobody to carry him home
 Only a hobo, but one more is gone

 Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
 To look up on the world from a hole in the ground,
 To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
 To lie in the gutter and die with no name?

 Only a hobo, but one more is gone
 Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song
 Leavin' nobody to carry him home
 Only a hobo, but one more is gone
   

 ONLY A PAWN IN THEIR GAME
                                       
 A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers' blood.
 A finger fired the trigger to his name.
 A handle hid out in the dark
 A hand set the spark
 Two eyes took the aim
 Behind a man's brain
 But he can't be blamed
 He's only a pawn in their game.
 
 A South politician preaches to the poor white man,
 "You got more than the blacks, don't complain.
 You're better than them, you been born with white skin," they explain.
 And the Negro's name
 Is used it is plain
 For the politician's gain
 As he rises to fame
 And the poor white remains
 On the caboose of the train
 But it ain't him to blame
 He's only a pawn in their game.
 
 The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
 And the marshals and cops get the same,
 But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
 He's taught in his school
 From the start by the rule
 That the laws are with him
 To protect his white skin
 To keep up his hate
 So he never thinks straight
 'Bout the shape that he's in
 But it ain't him to blame
 He's only a pawn in their game.

 From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks,
 And the hoof beats pound in his brain.
 And he's taught how to walk in a pack
 Shoot in the back
 With his fist in a clinch
 To hang and to lynch
 To hide 'neath the hood
 To kill with no pain
 Like a dog on a chain
 He ain't got no name
 But it ain't him to blame
 He's only a pawn in their game.
 
 Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
 They lowered him down as a king.
 But when the shadowy sun sets on the one
 That fired the gun
 He'll see by his grave
 On the stone that remains
 Carved next to his name
 His epitaph plain:
 Only a pawn in their game.
   

 ON THE ROAD AGAIN
                                       
 Well, I woke up in the morning
 There's frogs inside my socks
 Your mama, she's a-hidin'
 Inside the icebox
 Your daddy walks in wearin'
 A Napoleon Bonaparte mask
 Then you ask why I don't live here
 Honey, do you have to ask?
 
 Well, I go to pet your monkey
 I get a face full of claws
 I ask who's in the fireplace
 And you tell me Santa Claus
 The milkman comes in
 He's wearing a derby hat
 Then you ask why I don't live here
 Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
 
 Well, I asked for something to eat
 I'm hungry as a hog
 So I get brown rice, seaweed
 And a dirty hot dog
 I've got a hole
 Where my stomach disappeared
 Then you ask why I don't live here
 Honey, I gotta think you're really weird.
 
 Your grandpa's cane
 It turns into a sword
 Your grandma prays to pictures
 That are pasted on a board
 Everything inside my pockets
 Your uncle steals
 Then you ask why I don't live here
 Honey, I can't believe that you're for real.
 
 Well, there's fist fights in the kitchen
 They're enough to make me cry
 The mailman comes in
 Even he's gotta take a side
 Even the butler
 He's got something to prove
 Then you ask why I don't live here
 Honey, how come you don't move?
   

 OPEN THE DOOR, HOMER
                                       
 Now, there's a certain thing
 That I learned from Jim
 That he'd always make sure I'd understand
 And that is that there's a certain way
 That a man must swim
 If he expects to live off
 Of the fat of the land.
 Open the door, Homer,
 I've heard it said before.
 Open the door, Homer,
 I've heard it said before
 But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
 
 Now, there's a certain thing
 That I learned from my friend, Mouse
 A fella who always blushes
 And that is that ev'ryone
 Must always flush out his house
 If he don't expect to be
 Goin' 'round housing flushes.
 Open the door, Homer,
 I've heard it said before.
 Open the door, Homer,
 I've heard it said before
 But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
 
 "Take care of all your memories"
 Said my friend, Mick
 "For you cannot relive them
 And remember when you're out there
 Tryin' to heal the sick
 That you must always
 First forgive them."
 Open the door, Homer,
 I've heard it said before.
 Open the door, Homer,
 I've heard it said before
 But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
   

 OUTLAW BLUES
                                       
 Ain't it hard to stumble
 And land in some funny lagoon?
 Ain't it hard to stumble
 And land in some muddy lagoon?
 Especially when it's nine below zero
 And three o'clock in the afternoon.

 Ain't gonna hang no picture,
 Ain't gonna hang no picture frame.
 Ain't gonna hang no picture,
 Ain't gonna hang no picture frame.
 Well, I might look like Robert Ford
 But I feel just like a Jesse James.

 Well, I wish I was on some
 Australian mountain range.
 Oh, I wish I was on some
 Australian mountain range.
 I got no reason to be there, but I
 Imagine it would be some kind of change.

 I got my dark sunglasses,
 I got for good luck my black tooth.
 I got my dark sunglasses,
 I'm carryin' for good luck my black tooth.
 Don't ask me nothin' about nothin',
 I just might tell you the truth.
 
 I got a woman in Jackson,
 I ain't gonna say her name.
 I got a woman in Jackson,
 I ain't gonna say her name.
 She's a brown-skin woman,
 But I Love her just the same.
   

 OXFORD TOWN
                                       
 Oxford Town, Oxford Town
 Ev'rybody's got their heads bowed down
 The sun don't shine above the ground
 Ain't a-goin' down to Oxford Town

 He went down to Oxford Town
 Guns and clubs followed him down
 All because his face was brown
 Better get away from Oxford Town

 Oxford Town around the bend
 He come in to the door, he couldn't get in
 All because of the color of his skin
 What do you think about that, my frien'?

 Me and my gal, my gal's son
 We got met with a tear gas bomb
 I don't even know why we come
 Goin' back where we come from

 Oxford Town in the afternoon
 Ev'rybody singin' a sorrowful tune
 Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon
 Somebody better investigate soon

 Oxford Town, Oxford Town
 Ev'rybody's got their heads bowed down
 The sun don't shine above the ground
 Ain't a-goin' down to Oxford Town
   

 PATHS OF VICTORY
                                       
 Trails of troubles,
 Roads of battles,
 Paths of victory,
 I shall walk.

 The trail is dusty
 And my road it might be rough,
 But the better roads are waiting
 And boys it ain't far off.

 Trails of troubles,
 Roads of battles,
 Paths of victory,
 We shall walk.
 
 I walked down by the river,
 I turned my head up high.
 I saw that silver linin'
 That was hangin' in the sky.
 
 Trails of troubles,
 Roads of battles,
 Paths of victory,
 We shall walk.
 
 The evenin' dusk was rollin',
 I was walking down the track.
 There was a one-way wind a-blowin'
 And it was blowin' at my back.

 Trails of troubles,
 Roads of battles,
 Paths of victory,
 We shall walk.

 The gravel road is bumpy,
 It's a hard road to ride,
 But there's a clearer road a-waitin'
 With the cinders on the side.

 Trails of troubles,
 Roads of battles,
 Paths of victory,
 We shall walk.

 That evening train was rollin',
 The hummin' of its wheels,
 My eyes they saw a better day
 As I looked across the fields.

 Trails of troubles,
 Roads of battles,
 Paths of victory,
 We shall walk.

 The trail is dusty,
 The road it might be rough,
 But the good road is a-waitin'
 And boys it ain't far off.

 Trails of troubles,
 Roads of battles,
 Paths of victory,
 We shall walk.
   

 PEGGY DAY
                                       
 Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
 By golly, what more can I say,
 Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
 
 Peggy night makes my future look so bright,
 Man, that girl is out of sight,
 Love to spend the day with Peggy night.
 
 Well, you know that even before I learned her name,
 You know I loved her just the same.
 An' I tell 'em all, wherever I may go,
 Just so they'll know, that she's my little lady
 And I love her so.
 
 Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
 Turned my skies to blue from gray,
 Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
 
 Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
 By golly, what more can I say,
 Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
 Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
   

 PERCY'S SONG
                                       
 Bad news, bad news,
 Come to me where I sleep,
 Turn, turn, turn again.
 Sayin' one of your friends
 Is in trouble deep,
 Turn, turn to the rain
 And the wind.
 
 Tell me the trouble,
 Tell once to my ear,
 Turn, turn, turn again.
 Joliet prison
 And ninety-nine years,
 Turn, turn to the rain
 And the wind.
 
 Oh what's the charge
 Of how this came to be,
 Turn, turn, turn again.
 Manslaughter
 In the highest of degree,
 Turn, turn to the rain
 And the wind.
 
 I sat down and wrote
 The best words I could write,
 Turn, turn, turn again.
 Explaining to the judge
 I'd be there on Wednesday night,
 Turn, turn to the rain
 And the wind.
 
 Without a reply,
 I left by the moon,
 Turn, turn, turn again.
 And was in his chambers
 By the next afternoon,
 Turn, turn to the rain
 And the wind.
 
 Could ya tell me the facts?
 I said without fear,
 Turn, turn, turn again.
 That a friend of mine
 Would get ninety-nine years,
 Turn, turn to the rain
 And the wind.
 
 A crash on the highway
 Flew the car to a field,
 Turn, turn, turn again.
 There was four persons killed
 And he was at the wheel,
 Turn, turn to the rain
 And the wind.
 
 But I knew him as good
 As I'm knowin' myself,
 Turn, turn, turn again.
 And he wouldn't harm a life
 That belonged to someone else,
 Turn, turn to the rain
 And the wind.
 
 The judge spoke
 Out of the side of his mouth,
 Turn, turn, turn again.
 Sayin', "The witness who saw,
 He left little doubt,"
 Turn, turn to the rain
 And the wind.
 
 That may be true,
 He's got a sentence to serve,
 Turn, turn, turn again.
 But ninety-nine years,
 He just don't deserve,
 Turn, turn to the rain
 And the wind.

 Too late, too late,
 For his case it is sealed,
 Turn, turn, turn again.
 His sentence is passed
 And it cannot be repealed,
 Turn, turn to the rain
 And the wind.

 But he ain't no criminal
 And his crime it is none,
 Turn, turn, turn again.
 What happened to him
 Could happen to anyone,
 Turn, turn to the rain
 And the wind.
 
 And at that the judge jerked forward
 And his face it did freeze,
 Turn, turn, turn again.
 Sayin', "Could you kindly leave
 My office now, please,"
 Turn, turn to the rain
 And the wind.
 
 Well his eyes looked funny
 And I stood up so slow,
 Turn, turn, turn again.
 With no other choice
 Except for to go,
 Turn, turn to the rain
 And the wind.
 
 I walked down the hallway
 And I heard his door slam,
 Turn, turn, turn again.
 I walked down the courthouse stairs
 And I did not understand,
 Turn, turn to the rain
 And the wind.

 And I played my guitar
 Through the night to the day,
 Turn, turn, turn again.
 And the only tune
 My guitar could play
 Was, "Oh the Cruel Rain
 And the Wind."

 PLEASE, MRS. HENRY
                                       
 Well, I've already had two beers
 I'm ready for the broom
 Please, Missus Henry, won't you
 Take me to my room?
 I'm a good ol' boy
 But I've been sniffin' too many eggs
 Talkin' to too many people
 Drinkin' too many kegs
 Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
 Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
 I'm down on my knees
 An' I ain't got a dime
 
 Well, I'm groanin' in a hallway
 Pretty soon I'll be mad
 Please, Missus Henry, won't you
 Take me to your dad?
 I can drink like a fish
 I can crawl like a snake
 I can bite like a turkey
 I can slam like a drake
 Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
 Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
 I'm down on my knees
 An' I ain't got a dime
 
 Now, don't crowd me, lady
 Or I'll fill up your shoe
 I'm a sweet bourbon daddy
 An' tonight I am blue
 I'm a thousand years old
 And I'm a generous bomb
 I'm T-boned and punctured
 But I'm known to be calm
 Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
 Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
 I'm down on my knees
 An' I ain't got a dime
  
 Now, I'm startin' to drain
 My stool's gonna squeak
 If I walk too much farther
 My crane's gonna leak
 Look, Missus Henry
 There's only so much I can do
 Why don't you look my way
 An' pump me a few?
 Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
 Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
 I'm down on my knees
 An' I ain't got a dime
   

 PLEDGING MY TIME
                                       
 Well, early in the mornin'
 'Til late at night,
 I got a poison headache,
 But I feel all right.
 I'm pledging my time to you,
 Hopin' you'll come through, too.
 
 Well, the hobo jumped up,
 He came down natur'lly.
 After he stole my baby,
 Then he wanted to steal me.
 But I'm pledging my time to you,
 Hopin' you'll come through, too.
 
 Won't you come with me, baby?
 I'll take you where you wanna go.
 And if it don't work out,
 You'll be the first to know.
 I'm pledging my time to you,
 Hopin' you'll come through, too.
 
 Well, the room is so stuffy,
 I can hardly breathe.
 Ev'rybody's gone but me and you
 And I can't be the last to leave.
 I'm pledging my time to you,
 Hopin' you'll come through, too.
 
 Well, they sent for the ambulance
 And one was sent.
 Somebody got lucky
 But it was an accident.
 Now I'm pledging my time to you,
 Hopin' you'll come through, too.
   

 POLITICAL WORLD
                                       
 We live in a political world,
 Love don't have any place.
 We're living in times where men commit crimes,
 And crime don't have a face.

 We live in a political world,
 Icicles hanging down,
 Wedding bells ring and angels sing,
 clouds cover up the ground.

 We live in a political world,
 Wisdom is thrown into jail,
 It rots in a cell, is misguided as hell,
 Leaving no one to pick up a trail.

 We live in a political world
 Where mercy walks the plank,
 Life is in mirrors, death disappears
 Up the steps into the nearest bank.

 We live in a political world
 Where courage is a thing of the past,
 Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
 The next day could be your last.
 
 We live in a political world,
 The one we can see and can feel,
 But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
 We all know for sure that it's real.

 We live in a political world,
 In the cities of lonesome fear,
 Little by little you turn in the middle
 But you're never sure why you're here.

 We live in a political world,
 Under the microscope,
 You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
 You always got more than enough rope.

 We live in a political world,
 Turning and a-thrashing about,
 As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take,
 What looks like the easy way out.

 We live in a political world,
 Where peace is not welcome at all,
 It's turned away from the door to wander some more,
 Or put up against the wall.

 We live in a political world,
 Everything is hers or his,
 Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
 But you're never sure what it is.
   

 POOR BOY BLUES

 POSITIVELY 4TH STREET
                                       
 You got a lotta nerve
 To say you are my friend
 When I was down
 You just stood there grinning

 You got a lotta nerve
 To say you gota helping hand to lend
 You just want to be on
 The side that's winning

 You say I let you down
 You know it's not like that
 If you're so hurt
 Why then don't you show it
 
 You say you lost your faith
 But that's not where it's at
 You had no faith to lose
 And you know it
 
 I know the reason
 That you talk behind my back
 I used to be among the crowd
 You're in with
 
 Do you take me for such a fool
 To think I'd make contact
 With the one who tries to hide
 What he don't know to begin with
 
 You see me on the street
 You always act surprised
 You say, "How are you?" "Good luck"
 But you don't mean it

 When you know as well as me
 You'd rather see me paralyzed
 Why don't you just come out once
 And scream it

 No, I do not feel that good
 When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
 If I was a master thief
 Perhaps I'd rob them
 
 And now I know you're dissatisfied
 With your position and your place
 Don't you understand
 It's not my problem

 I wish that for just one time
 You could stand inside my shoes
 And just for that one moment
 I could be you
 
 Yes, I wish that for just one time
 You could stand inside my shoes
 You'd know what a drag it is
 To see you
   

 PRECIOUS ANGEL
                                       
 Precious angel, under the sun,
 How was I to know you'd be the one
 To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone
 How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?

 Now there's spiritual warfare and flesh and blood breaking down.
 Ya either got faith or ya got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
 The enemy is subtle, how be it we are so deceived
 When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?

 Shine your light, shine your light on me
 Shine your light, shine your light on me
 Shine your light, shine your light on me
 Ya know I just couldn't make it by myself.
 I'm a little too blind to see.

 My so-called friends have fallen under a spell.
 They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "All is well."
 Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
 When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?

 Sister, lemme tell you about a vision I saw.
 You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law.
 You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him about Mohammed in
     the same breath.
 You never mentioned one time the Man who came and died a criminal's death.

 Shine your light, shine your light on me
 Shine your light, shine your light on me
 Shine your light, shine your light on me
 Ya know I just couldn't make it by myself.
 I'm a little too blind to see.

 Precious angel, you believe me when I say
 What God has given to us no man can take away.
 We are covered in blood, girl, you know our forefathers were slaves.
 Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
 
 You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
 You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you touch up the night.
 But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
 On the way out of Egypt, through Ethiopia, to the judgment hall of Christ.

 Shine your light, shine your light on me
 Shine your light, shine your light on me
 Shine your light, shine your light on me
 Ya know I just couldn't make it by myself.
 I'm a little too blind to see.
   

 PRECIOUS MEMORIES
                                       
 As I travel down life's pathway,
 Know not what the years may hold.
 As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
 Precious memories flood my soul

 Precious father, loving mother,
 Glide across the lonely years.
 And old homes scenes of my childhood
 In fond memory appears.

 Precious memories, how they linger
 How they ever flood my soul.
 In the stillness of the midnight,
 Precious sacred scenes unfold.
   

 PRESSING ON
                                       
 Well I'm pressing on
 Yes, I'm pressing on
 Well I'm pressing on
 To the higher calling of my Lord.

 Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
 Say, "Prove to me that He is Lord, show me a sign."
 What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
 When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?

 Well I'm pressing on
 Yes, I'm pressing on
 Well I'm pressing on
 To the higher calling of my Lord.

 Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back.
 Nothing now can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
 Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
 Because he sinned I got no choice, it run in my vein.

 Well I'm pressing on
 Yes, I'm pressing on
 Well I'm pressing on
 To the higher calling of my Lord.
   

 PROPERTY OF JESUS
                                       
 Go ahead and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
 Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without.
 Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
 Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walkin' through.

 He's the property of Jesus
 Resent him to the bone
 You got something better
 You've got a heart of stone

 Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
 Hope he falls upon himself, oh, won't that be sweet
 Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore
 Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.

 He's the property of Jesus
 Resent him to the bone
 You got something better
 You've got a heart of stone

 When the whip that's keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
 Say he's hard-of-hearin', say that he's a chump.
 Say he's out of step with reality as you try to test his nerve
 Because he doesn't pay no tribute to the king that you serve.

 He's the property of Jesus
 Resent him to the bone
 You got something better
 You've got a heart of stone'cause

 Say that he's a loser Ôcause he got no common sense
 Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense.
 Because he's not afraid of trying, 'cause he don't look at you and smile,
 'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes or fairy tales, say he's got no style.

 He's the property of Jesus
 Resent him to the bone
 You got something better
 You've got a heart of stone

 You can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
 You think that when you rest at last you'll go back from where you came.
 But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb.
 What happened to the real you, you've been captured but by whom?

 He's the property of Jesus
 Resent him to the bone
 You got something better
 You've got a heart of stone
   

 QUEEN JANE APPROXIMATELY
                                       
 When your mother sends back all your invitations
 And your father to your sister he explains
 That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations
 Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
 Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

 Now when all of the flower ladies want back what they have lent you
 And the smell of their roses does not remain
 And all of your children start to resent you
 Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
 Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

 Now when all the clowns that you have commissioned
 Have died in battle or in vain
 And you're sick of all this repetition
 Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
 Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

 When all of your advisers heave their plastic
 At your feet to convince you of your pain
 Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic
 Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
 Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

 Now when all the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
 All lay down their bandanas and complain
 And you want somebody you don't have to speak to
 Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
 Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

 QUINN, THE ESKIMO
                                       
 Ev'rybody's building the big ships and the boats,
 Some are building monuments,
 Others, jotting down notes,
 Ev'rybody's in despair,
 Ev'ry girl and boy
 But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
 Ev'rybody's gonna jump for joy.
 Come all without, come all within,
 You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn.
 
 I like to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
 But guarding fumes and making haste,
 It ain't my cup of meat.
 Ev'rybody's 'neath the trees,
 Feeding pigeons on a limb
 But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
 All the pigeons gonna run to him.
 Come all without, come all within,
 You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn.
 
 A cat's meow and a cow's moo, I can recite 'em all,
 Just tell me where it hurts yuh, honey,
 And I'll tell you who to call.
 Nobody can get no sleep,
 There's someone on ev'ryone's toes
 But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
 Ev'rybody's gonna wanna doze.
 Come all without, come all within,
 You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn.
   

 RAGGED & DIRTY
                                       
 Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
 Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too.
 If I clean up, sweet momma, can I stay all night with you?
 
 Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
 Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds.
 Heard my best friend a-comin' and I thought I heard my baby cry.
 
 Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
 If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door.
 And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
 
 How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
 How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
 Well, that woman I got, man, she does just what she feels.
 
 Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
 Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild.
 You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
 
 'Cause I'm leaving in the morning, if I have to ride the blinds,
 Leaving in the morning, if I have to ride the blinds.
 Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dyin'.
   

 RAMBLING, GAMBLING WILLIE
                                       
 Come around you rovin' gamblers and a story I will tell
 About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
 His name was Will O' Conley and he gambled all his life,
 He had twenty-seven children, yet he never had a wife.
 And it's ride, Willie, ride,
 Roll, Willie, roll,
 Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.
 
 He gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
 Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
 He had a reputation as the gamblin'est man around,
 Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
 And it's ride, Willie, ride,
 Roll, Willie, roll,
 Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.

 Sailin' down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
 They're still talkin' about their card game on that Jackson River Queen.
 "I've come to win some money," Gamblin' Willie says,
 When the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his.
 And it's ride, Willie, ride,
 Roll, Willie, roll,
 Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.
 
 Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
 There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
 Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
 When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town.
 And it's ride, Willie, ride,
 Roll, Willie, roll,
 Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.
 
 But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
 He supported all his children, and all their mothers too.
 He wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore,
 He spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and the poor.
 And it's ride, Willie, ride,
 Roll, Willie, roll,
 Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.

 When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
 Whether he was bluffin' or whether he was true.
 He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair.
 The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
 And it's ride, Willie, ride,
 Roll, Willie, roll,
 Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.

 It was late one evenin' during a poker game,
 A man lost all his money, he said Willie was to blame.
 He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
 When Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
 And it's ride, Willie, ride,
 Roll, Willie, roll,
 Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.

 So all you rovin' gamblers, wherever you might be,
 The moral of this story is very plain to see.
 Make your money while you can, before you have to stop,
 For when you pull that dead man's hand, your gamblin' days are up.
 And it's ride, Willie, ride,
 Roll, Willie, roll,
 Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.
   

 RESTLESS FAREWELL
                                       
 Oh all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
 Be it mine right or wrongfully,
 I let it slip gladly past the hands of my friends
 To tie up the time most forcefully.
 But the bottles are done,
 We've killed each one
 And the table's full and overflowed.
 And the corner sign
 Says it's closing time,
 So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
 
 Oh ev'ry girl that ever l've touched,
 I did not do it harmfully.
 And ev'ry girl that ever I've hurt,
 I did not do it knowin'ly.
 But to remain as friends and make amends
 You need the time and stay behind.
 And since my feet are now fast
 And point away from the past,
 I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
 
 Oh ev'ry foe that ever I faced,
 The cause was there before we came.
 And ev'ry cause that ever I fought,
 I fought it full without regret or shame.
 But the dark does die
 As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
 Must meet the dawn.
 And if I see the day
 I'd only have to stay,
 So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
 
 Oh, ev'ry thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
 I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung.
 But it's not to stand naked under unknowin' eyes,
 It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
 But the time ain't tall,
 Yet on time you depend and no word is possessed
 By no special friend.
 And though the line is cut,
 It ain't quite the end,
 I'll just bill farewell till we meet again.
 
 Oh a false clock tries to tick out my time
 To disgrace, distract, and bother me.
 And the dirt of gossip blows into my face,
 And the dust of rumors covers me.
 But if the arrow is straight
 And the point is slick,
 It can pierce through dust no matter how thick.
 So I'll make my stand
 And remain as I am
 And bid farewell and not give a damn.
   

 RING THEM BELLS
                                       
 Ring them bells, ye heathen
 From the city that dreams,
 Ring them bells from the sanctuaries
 Cross the valleys and streams,
 For they're deep and they're wide
 And the world's on its side
 And time is running backwards
 And so is the bride.

 Ring them bells St. Peter
 Where the four winds blow,
 Ring them bells with an iron hand
 So the people will know.
 Oh it's rush hour now
 On the wheel and the plow
 And the sun is going down
 Upon the sacred cow.

 Ring them bells Sweet Martha,
 For the poor man's son,
 Ring them bells so the world will know
 That God is one.
 Oh the shepherd is asleep
 Where the willows weep
 And the mountains are filled
 With lost sheep.

 Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
 Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
 Ring them bells for the chosen few
 Who will judge the many when the game is through.
 Ring them bells, for the time that flies,
 For the child that cries
 When innocence dies.
 
 Ring them bells St. Catherine
 From the top of the room,
 Ring them from the fortress
 For the lilies that bloom.
 Oh the lines are long
 And the fighting is strong
 And they're breaking down the distance
 Between right and wrong.
   

 RITA MAY
                                       
 Rita May, Rita May,
 You got your body in the way.
 You're so damn nonchalant
 But it's your mind that I want.
 You got me huffin' and a-puffin',
 Next to you I feel like nothin',
 Rita May.
 
 Rita May, Rita May,
 How'd you ever get that way?
 When do you ever see the light?
 Don't you ever feel a fright?
 You got me burnin' and I'm turnin'
 But I know I must be learnin',
 Rita May.

 All my friends have told me
 If I hang around with you
 That I'll go blind
 But I know that when you hold me
 That there really must be somethin'
 On your mind.

 Rita May, Rita May,
 Laying in a stack of hay,
 Do you remember where you been?
 What's that crazy place you're in?
 I'm gonna have to go to college
 'Cause you are the book of knowledge,
 Rita May.
   

 ROCKS AND GRAVEL
 (Solid Road)
                                       
 Takes rocks and gravel, baby, make a solid road,
 Make a solid road.
 Takes rocks and gravel, baby, make a solid road,
 Make a solid road.

 Takes a good woman mama,
 To satisfy my weary soul.

 Have you ever been down on that Mobil and K. C. line,
 Have you ever been down on that Mobil and K. C. line?
 
 Well I just wanna ask you,
 If you seen that gal of mine,
 Don't the clouds look lonesome shining across the sea,
 Don't the clouds look lonesome shining across the sea,
 Don't my gal look good,
 When she's comin' after me?
   

 ROMANCE IN DURANGO
                                       
 Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun
 Dust on my face and my cape,
 Me and Magdalena on the run
 I think this time we shall escape.

 Sold my guitar to the baker's son
 For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
 But I can get another one
 And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.

 No llores, mi querida
 Dios nos vigila
 Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
 Agarrame, mi vida
 Soon the desert will be gone
 Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

 Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people
 Hoofbeats like castanets on stone.
 At night I dream of bells in the village steeple
 Then I see the bloody face of Ramon.

 Was it me that shot him down in the cantina
 Was it my hand that held the gun?
 Come, let us fly, my Magdalena
 The dogs are barking and what's done is done.

 No llores, mi querida
 Dios nos vigila
 Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
 Agarrame, mi vida
 Soon the desert will be gone
 Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

 At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
 And watch the young torero stand alone.
 We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
 When they rode with Villa into Torre6n.

 Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
 In the little church this side of town.
 I will wear new boots and an earring of gold
 You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.

 The way is long but the end is near
 Already the fiesta has begun.
 The face of God will appear
 With His serpent eyes of obsidian.

 No llores, mi querida
 Dios nos vigila
 Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
 Agarrame, mi vida
 Soon the desert will be gone
 Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

 Was that the thunder that I heard?
 My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain
 Come sit by me, don't say a word
 Oh, can it be that I am slain?
 
 Quick, Magdalena, take my gun
 Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
 Aim well my little one
 We may not make it through the night.

 No llores, mi querida
 Dios nos vigila
 Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
 Agarrame, mi vida
 Soon the desert will be gone
 Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
   

 SAD EYED LADY OF THE LOWLANDS
                                       
 With your mercury mouth in the missionary times,
 And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes,
 And your silver cross, and your voice like chimes,
 Oh, who among them do they think could bury you?
 With your pockets well protected at last,
 And your streetcar visions which you place on the grass,
 And your flesh like silk, and your face like glass,
 Who among them do they think could carry you?

 Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
 Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
 My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
 Should I leave them by your gate,
 Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

 With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace,
 And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace,
 And your basement clothes and your hollow face,
 Who among them can think he could outguess you?
 With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
 Into your eyes where the moonlight swims,
 And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
 Who among them would try to impress you?

 Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
 Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
 My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
 Should I leave them by your gate,
 Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

 The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
 Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss,
 And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
 But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
 With your childhood flames on your midnight rug,
 And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs,
 And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs,
 Who among them do you think could resist you?
 
 Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
 Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
 My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
 Should I leave them by your gate,
 Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

 Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
 To show you the dead angels that they used to hide.
 But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
 Oh, how could they ever mistake you?
 They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
 But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm,
 And with the child of a hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
 How could they ever, ever persuade you?

 Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
 Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
 My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
 Should I leave them by your gate,
 Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

 With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row,
 And your magazine-husband who one day just had to go,
 And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
 Who among them do you think would employ you?
 Now you stand with your thief, you're on his parole
 With your holy medallion which your fingertips fold,
 And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
 Oh, who among them do you think could destroy you?

 Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
 Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
 My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
 Should I leave them by your gate,
 Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
   

 SANTA-FE
                                       
 Santa-Fe,
 Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa-Fe,
 My woman needs it ev'ryday,
 She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
 She's rollin' up a lotta bread
 To toss away.
 She's in Santa-Fe,
 Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa-Fe
 Now she's opened up an old maid's home,
 She's proud, but she needs to roam,
 She's gonna write herself a roadside poem,
 About Santa-Fe.

 Santa-Fe,
 Dear, dear, dear, dear Santa-Fe.
 Since I'm never gonna cease to roam,
 I'm never, ever far from home,
 But I'll build a geodesic dome
 And sail away.
 Don't feel bad.
 No, no, no, no, don't feel bad
 It's the best food I've ever had.
 Makes me feel so glad
 That she's cooking in a home-made pad
 She never caught a cold so bad
 When I'm away.

 Santa-Fe,
 Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa-Fe.
 My shrimp boat's in the bay
 I won't have my nature this way,
 And I'm leanin' on the wheel each day
 To drift away
 From Santa-Fe,
 Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa-Fe.
 My sister looks good at home,
 She's lickin' on an ice cream cone,
 She's packin' her big white comb,
 What does it weigh?
   

 SARA
                                       
 I laid on a dune, I looked at the sky,
 When the children were babies and played on the beach.
 You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
 You were always so close and still within reach.

 Sara, Sara,
 Whatever made you want to change your mind?
 Sara, Sara,
 So easy to look at, so hard to define.

 I can still see them playin' with their pails in the sand,
 They run to the water their buckets to fill.
 I can still see the shells fallin' out of their hands
 As they follow each other back up the hill.

 Sara, Sara,
 Sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
 Sara, Sara,
 Radiant jewel, mystical wife.

 Sleepin' in the woods by a fire in the night,
 Drinkin' white rum in a Portugal bar,
 Them playin' leapfrog and hearin' about Snow White,
 You in the marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.

 Sara, Sara,
 It's all so clear, I could never forget,
 Sara, Sara,
 Lovin' you is the one thing I'll never regret.

 I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells,
 I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
 Stayin' up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
 Writin' "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.

 Sara, Sara,
 Wherever we travel we're never apart.
 Sara, oh Sara,
 Beautiful lady, so dear to my heart.

 How did I meet you? I don't know.
 A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
 You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow
 And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.

 Sara, oh Sara,
 Scorpio Sphinx  in a calico dress,
 Sara, Sara,
 You must forgive me my unworthiness.

 Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp
 And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore.
 You always responded when I needed your help,
 You gimme a map and a key to your door.
 
 Sara, oh Sara,
 Glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
 Sara, oh Sara,
 Don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
   

 SARAH JANE
                                       
 I've got a wife and five little children
 I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan
 With Sarah Jane (Sarah Jane)
 Sarah Jane (Sarah Jane)
 Ain't nothin' to do
 But to set down and sing
 And rock about my Sarah Jane

 Whistle done blows and the fiddler squalls
 Captain gone through hole-in-the-wall
 Oh Sarah Jane (Sarah Jane)
 Sarah Jane (Sarah Jane)
 Ain't nothin' to do
 But to set down and sing
 And rock about my Sarah Jane

 Yankee built boats to shoot them Rebels
 My gun's steady gonna hold it level
 Sarah Jane (Sarah Jane)
 Sarah Jane (Sarah Jane)
 Ain't nothin' to do
 But to set down and sing
 And rock about my Sarah Jane

 I've got a wife and five little children
 I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan
 Sarah Jane (Sarah Jane)
 Sarah Jane (Sarah Jane)
 Ain't nothin' to do
 But to set down and sing
 And rock about my Sarah Jane
   

 SAVED
                                       
 I was blinded by the devil,
 Born already ruined,
 Stone-cold dead
 As I stepped out of the womb.
 By His grace I have been touched,
 By His word I have been healed,
 By His hand I've been delivered,
 By His spirit I've been sealed.

 I've been saved
 By the blood of the lamb,
 Saved
 By the blood of the lamb,
 Saved,
 Saved,
 And I'm so glad.
 Yes, I'm so glad,
 I'm so glad,
 So glad,
 I want to thank You, Lord,
 I just want to thank You, Lord,
 Thank You, Lord.

 By His truth I can be upright,
 By His strength I do endure,
 By His power I've been lifted,
 In His love I am secure.
 He bought me with a price,
 Freed me from the pit,
 Full of emptiness and wrath
 And the fire that burns in it.
 
 I've been saved
 By the blood of the lamb,
 Saved
 By the blood of the lamb,
 Saved,
 Saved,
 And I'm so glad.
 Yes, I'm so glad,
 I'm so glad,
 So glad,
 I want to thank You, Lord,
 I just want to thank You, Lord,
 Thank You, Lord.
 
 Nobody to rescue me,
 Nobody would dare,
 I was going down for the last time,
 But by His mercy I've been spared.
 Not by works,
 But by faith in Him who called,
 For so long I've been hindered,
 For so long I've been stalled.
 
 I've been saved
 By the blood of the lamb,
 Saved
 By the blood of the lamb,
 Saved,
 Saved,
 And I'm so glad.
 Yes, I'm so glad,
 I'm so glad,
 So glad,
 I want to thank You, Lord,
 I just want to thank You, Lord,
 Thank You, Lord.
   

 SAVING GRACE
                                       
 If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
 Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
 I've escaped death so many times, I know I'm only living
 By the saving grace that's over me.
 
 By this time I'd-a thought I would be sleeping
 In a pine box for all eternity.
 My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
 For the saving grace that's over me.

 Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection,
 Wherever I am welcome is where I'll be.
 I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
 Is the saving grace that's over me.

 Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
 But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
 As I look around this world all that I'm finding
 Is the saving grace that's over me.

 The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
 There's only one road and it leads to Calvary.
 It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
 By the saving grace that's over me.
   

 SENOR
 (Tales of Yankee Power)
                                       
 Senor, senor, do you know where we're headin'?
 Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
 Seems like I been down this way before.
 Is there any truth in that, senor?
 
 Senor, senor, do you know where she is hidin'?
 How long are we gonna be ridin'?
 How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
 Will there be any comfort there, senor?

 There's a wicked wind still blowin' on that upper deck,
 There's an iron cross still hanging down from around her neck.
 There's a marchin' band still playin' in that vacant lot
 Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."

 Senor, senor, I can see that painted wagon,
 I can smell the tail of the dragon.
 Can't stand the suspense anymore.
 Can you tell me who to contact here, senor?

 Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
 Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field.
 A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring
 Said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."

 Senor, senor, you know their hearts is as hard as leather.
 Well, give me a minute, let me get it together.
 I just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
 I'm ready when you are, senor.

 Senor, senor, let's disconnect these cables,
 Overturn these tables.
 This place don't make sense to me no more.
 Can you tell me what we're waiting for, senor?
   

 SERIES OF DREAMS
                                       
 I was thinking of a series of dreams
 Where nothing comes up to the top
 Everything stays down where it's wounded
 And comes to a permanent stop
 Wasn't thinking of anything specific
 Like in a dream, when someone wakes up and screams
 Nothing too very scientific
 Just thinking of a series of dreams

 Thinking of a series of dreams
 Where the time and the tempo fly
 And there's no exit in any direction
 ÔCept the one that you can't see with your eyes
 Wasn't making any great connection
 Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme
 Nothing that would pass inspection
 Just thinking of a series of dreams

 Dreams where the umbrella is folded
 Into the path you are hurled
 And the cards are no good that you're holding
 Unless they're from another world
 
 In one, numbers were burning
 In another, I witnessed a crime
 In one, I was running, and in another
 All I seemed to be doing was climb
 Wasn't looking for any special assistance
 Not going to any great extremes
 I'd already gone the distance
 Just thinking of a series of dreams
   

 SEVEN CURSES
                                       
 Old Reilly stole a stallion
 But they caught him and they brought him back
 And they laid him down on the jailhouse ground
 With an iron chain around his neck.

 Old Reilly's daughter got a message
 That her father was goin' to hang.
 She rode by night and came by morning
 With gold and silver in her hand.

 When the judge he saw Reilly's daughter
 His old eyes deepened in his head,
 Sayin', "Gold will never free your father,
 The price, my dear, is you instead."

 "Oh I'm as good as dead," cried Reilly,
 "It's only you that he does crave
 And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all.
 Get on your horse and ride away."

 "Oh father you will surely die
 If I don't take the chance to try
 And pay the price and not take your advice.
 For that reason I will have to stay."

 The gallows shadows shook the evening,
 In the night a hound dog bayed,
 In the night the grounds were groanin',
 In the night the price was paid.

 The next mornin' she had awoken
 To know that the judge had never spoken.
 She saw that hangin' branch a-bendin',
 She saw her father's body broken.

 These be seven curses on a judge so cruel:
 That one doctor will not save him,
 That two healers will not heal him,
 That three eyes will not see him.

 That four ears will not hear him,
 That five walls will not hide him,
 That six diggers will not bury him
 And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
   

 SEVEN DAYS
                                       
 Seven days, seven more days she'll be comin'
 I'll be waiting at the station for her to arrive
 Seven more days, all I gotta do is survive.

 She been gone ever since I been a child
 Ever since I seen her smile, I ain't forgotten her eyes.
 She had a face that could outshine the sun in the skies.
 
 I been good, I been good while I been waitin'
 Maybe guilty of hesitatin', I just been holdin' on
 Seven more days, all that'll be gone.

 There's kissing in the valley,
 Thieving in the alley,
 Fighting every inch of the way.
 Trying to be tender
 With somebody I remember
 In a night that's always brighter'n the day.

 Seven days, seven more days that are connected
 Just like I expected, she'll be comin' on forth,
 My beautiful comrade from the north.

 There's kissing in the valley,
 Thieving in the alley,
 Fighting every inch of the way.
 Trying to be tender
 With somebody I remember
 In a night that's always brighter'n the day.
   

 SEEING THE REAL YOU AT LAST
                                       
 Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down
 But it looks like it don't.
 I'd like to get you to change your mind
 But it looks like you won't.

 From now on I'll be busy,
 Ain't goin' nowhere fast.
 I'm just glad it's over
 And I'm seeing the real you at last.

 Well, didn't I risk my neck for you,
 Didn't I take chances?
 Didn't I rise above it all for you,
 The most unfortunate circumstances?

 Well, I have had some rotten nights,
 Didn't think that they would pass.
 I'm just thankful and grateful
 To be seeing the real you at last.
 
 I'm hungry and I'm irritable
 And I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
 At one time there was nothing wrong with me
 That you could not fix.

 Well, I sailed through the storm
 Strapped to the mast,
 But the time has come
 And I'm seeing the real you at last.

 When I met you, baby,
 You didn't show no visible scars.
 You could ride like Annie Oakley,
 You could shoot like Belle Starr.
 
 Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble,
 Trouble always comes to pass
 But all I care about now
 Is that I'm seeing the real you at last.

 Well, I'm gonna quit this baby talk now,
 I guess I should have known.
 I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles,
 I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
 
 Whatever you gonna do,
 Please do it fast.
 I'm still trying to get used to
 Seeing the real you at last.
   

 SHE BELONGS TO ME
                                       
 She's got everything she needs,
 She's an artist, she don't look back.
 She's got everything she needs,
 She's an artist, she don't look back.
 She can take the dark out of the nighttime
 And paint the daytime black.

 You will start out standing
 Proud to steal her anything she sees.
 You will start out standing
 Proud to steal her anything she sees.
 But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole
 Down upon your knees.

 She never stumbles,
 She's got no place to fall.
 She never stumbles,
 She's got no place to fall.
 She's nobody's child,
 The Law can't touch her at all.

 She wears an Egyptian ring
 That sparkles before she speaks.
 She wears an Egyptian ring
 That sparkles before she speaks.
 She's a hypnotist collector,
 You are a walking antique.

 Bow down to her on Sunday,
 Salute her when her birthday comes.
 Bow down to her on Sunday,
 Salute her when her birthday comes.
 For Halloween give her a trumpet
 And for Christmas, buy her a drum.
   

 SHELTER FROM THE STORM
                                       
 'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood
 When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud
 I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form.
 "Come in," she said,
 "I'll give you shelter from the storm."

 And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured
 I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word
 In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm.
 "Come in," she said,
 "I'll give you shelter from the storm."

 Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved
 Everything up to that point had been left unresolved.
 Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm.
 "Come in," she said,
 "I'll give you shelter from the storm."

 I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
 Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail,
 Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn.
 "Come in," she said,
 "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
 
 Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there
 With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair.
 She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns.
 "Come in," she said,
 "I'll give you shelter from the storm."

 Now there's a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost
 I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed.
 Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn.
 "Come in," she said,
 "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
 
 Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
 But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
 And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn.
 "Come in," she said,
 "I'll give you shelter from the storm."

 I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove
 And old men with broken teeth stranded without love.
 Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
 "Come in," she said,
 "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
 
 In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
 I bargained for salvation an' they gave me a lethal dose.
 I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn.
 "Come in," she said,
 "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
 
 Well, I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
 Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine.
 If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born.
 "Come in," she said,
 "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
   

 SHENANDOAH
                                       
 Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
 Look away, you rollin' river
 Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
 Look away.  We're bound away
 Across the wide Missouri

 Now the Missouri is a mighty river
 Look away, you rollin' river.
 Indians camp along her border
 Look away.  We're bound away
 Across the wide Missouri

 Well a white man loved an Indian maiden
 Look away, you rollin' river
 With notions his canoe was laden
 Look away, we're bound away
 Across the wide Missouri
 
 Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter
 Look away, you rollin' river
 It was for her  I'd cross the water.
 Look away, we're bound away
 Across the wide Missouri
 
 For seven long years I courted Sally
 Look away, you rollin' river
 Seven more years I longed to have her
 Look away, we're bound away
 Across the wide Missouri

 Well, it's fare-thee-well, my dear,
 I'm bound to leave you
 Look away you rollin' river
 Shenandoah, I will not deceive you
 Look away, we're bound away
 Across the wide Missouri
   

 SHE'S YOUR LOVER NOW
                                       
 The pawnbroker roared
 Also, so, so did the landlord
 The scene was so crazy, wasn't it?
 Both were so glad
 To watch me destroy what I had
 Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
 Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
 Why'd you have to treat me so bad?
 Did it have to be that way?
 Now you stand here expectin' me to remember somethin' you forgot to say
 Yes, and you, I see you're still with her, well
 That's fine 'cause she's comin' on so strange, can't you tell?
 Somebody had better explain
 She's got her iron chain
 I'd do it, but I, I just can't remember how
 You talk to her
 She's your lover now.
 
 I already assumed
 That we're in the felony room
 But I ain't a judge, you don't have to be nice to me
 But please tell that
 To your friend in the cowboy hat
 You know he keeps on sayin' ev'rythin' twice to me
 You know I was straight with you
 You know I've never tried to change you in any way
 You know if you didn't want to be with me
 That you could . . . didn't have to stay.
 Now you stand here sayin' you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
 Yes, you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays, can't you reach?
 I see you kiss her on the cheek ev'rytime she gives a speech
 With her picture books of the pyramid
 And her postcards of Billy the Kid
 (Why must everybody bow?)
 You better talk to her 'bout it
 You're her lover now.
 
 Oh, ev'rybody that cares
 Is goin' up the castle stairs
 But I'm not up in your castle, honey
 It's true, I just can't recall
 San Francisco at all
 I can't even remember El Paso, uh, honey
 You never had to be faithful
 I didn't want you to grieve
 Oh, why was it so hard for you
 If you didn't want to be with me, just to leave?
 Now you stand here while your finger's goin' up my sleeve
 An' you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothin' you can say?
 She'll be standin' on the bar soon
 With a fish head an' a harpoon
 An' a fake beard plastered on her brow
 You'd better do somethin' quick
 She's your lover now.
   

 SHOOTING STAR
                                       
 Seen a shooting star tonight
 And I thought of you.
 You were trying to break into another world
 A world I never knew.
 I always kind of wondered
 If you ever made it through.
 Seen a shooting star tonight
 And I thought of you.
 
 Seen a shooting star tonight
 And I thought of me.
 If I was still the same
 If I ever became what you wanted me to be
 Did I miss the mark or
 Over-step the line
 That only you could see?
 Seen a shooting star tonight
 And I thought of me.

 Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
 As the last fire truck from hell
 Goes rolling by, all good people are praying,
 It's the last temptation
 The last account
 The last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
 The last radio is playing.
 
 Seen a shooting star tonight
 Slip Away.
 Tomorrow will be another day.
 Guess it's too late to say the things to you
 That you needed to hear me say.
 Seen a shooting star tonight
 Slip away.
   

 SHOT OF LOVE
                                       
 I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love.
 
 Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
 Don't need a shot of turpentine, only bring me to my knees,
 Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
 Don't need a shot of whiskey, help me be president.
 
 I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love.
 
 Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid.
 I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's makin' me feel afraid.
 What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
 Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
 
 I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love.
 
 I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you.
 I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em too.
 Don't show me no picture show or give me no book to read,
 It don't satisfy the hurt inside nor the habit that it feeds.
 
 I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love.
 
 Why would I want to take your life?
 You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
 Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
 Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
 
 I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love.
 
 Don't wanna be with nobody tonight.
 Veronica not around nowhere, Mavis just ain't right.
 There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth and near,
 Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
 
 I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love.
 
 What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
 Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't actin' right.
 Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away.
 My conscience is beginning to bother me today.
 
 I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love.
 
 I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love.
 If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
   

 SIGN ON THE CROSS
                                       
 Now, I try, oh for so awf'ly long
 And I just try to be.
 And now, oh it's a gold mine
 But it's so fine.
 Yes, but I know in my head
 That we're all so misled,
 And it's that ol' sign on the cross
 That worries me.
 
 Now, when I was just a bawlin' child,
 I saw what I wanted to be,
 And it's all for the sake
 Of that picture I should see.
 But I was lost on the moon
 As I heard that front door slam,
 And that old sign on the cross
 Still worries me.

 Well, it's that old sign on the cross,
 Well, it's that old key to the kingdom,
 Well, it's that old sign on the cross
 Like you used to be.
 
 But, when I hold my head so high
 As I see my ol' friends go by,
 And it's still that sign on the cross
 That worries me.
 
 Well, it seems to be the sign on the cross. Ev'ry day,
 ev'ry night, see the sign on the cross just layin' up
 on top of the hill. Yes, we thought it might have
 disappeared long ago, but I'm here to tell you, friends,
 that I'm afraid it's lyin' there still. Yes, just a
 little time is all you need, you might say, but I don't
 know 'bout that any more, because the bird is here and
 you might want to enter it, but, of course, the door might
 be closed. But I just would like to tell you one time,
 if I don't see you again, that the thing is, that the sign
 on the cross is the thing you might need the most.
 
 Yes, the sign on the cross
 Is just a sign on the cross.
 Well, there is some on every chisel
 And there is some in the championship, too.
 Oh, when your, when your days are numbered
 And your nights are long,
 You might think you're weak
 But I mean to say you're strong.
 Yes you are, if that sign on the cross,
 If it begins to worry you.
 Well, that's all right because sing a song
 And all your troubles will pass right on through.
   

 SIGN LANGUAGE
                                       
 You speak to me
 In sign language
 As I'm eating a sandwich
 In a small cafe
 At a quarter to three
 But I can't respond
 To your sign language.
 You're taking advantage,
 Bringing me down.
 Can't you make any sound?

 'Twas there by the bakery
 Surrounded by fakery
 Tell her my story
 Still I'm still there.
 Does she know I still care?
 
 Link Wray was playin'
 On a jukebox I was payin'
 For the words I was sayin'
 So misunderstood
 He didn't do me no good.
 
 You speak to me
 In sign language
 As I'm eating a sandwich
 In a small cafe
 At a quarter to three
 But I can't respond
 To your sign language.
 You're taking advantage,
 Bringing me down.
 Can't you make any sound?
   

 SIGN ON THE WINDOW
                                       
 Sign on the window says "Lonely,"
 Sign on the door said "No Company Allowed,"
 Sign on the street says "Y' Don't Own Me,"
 Sign on the porch says "Three's A Crowd,"
 Sign on the porch says "Three's A Crowd."

 Her and her boyfriend went to California,
 Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
 My best friend said, "Now didn' I warn ya,
 Brighton girls are like the moon,
 Brighton girls are like the moon."
 
 Looks like a-nothing but rain . . .
 Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street . . .
 Hope that it don't sleet.
 
 Build me a cabin in Utah,
 Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
 Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa,"
 That must be what it's all about,
 That must be what it's all about.
   

 SILENT WEEKEND
                                       
 Silent weekend,
 My baby she gave it to me
 Silent weekend,
 My baby she gave it to me.
 She's actin' tough and hardy
 She says it ain't my party
 And she's leavin' me in misery.
 
 Silent weekend,
 My baby she took me by surprise.
 Silent weekend,
 My baby she took me by surprise.
 She's rockin' and a-reelin'
 Head up to ceiling
 An' swinging with some other guys.

 Silent weekend,
 Oh Lord, I wish Monday would come.
 Silent weekend,
 Oh Lord, I sure wish Monday would come.
 She's uppity, she's rollin',
 She's in the groove, she's strolling
 Over to the jukebox playin' deaf and dumb.

 Well, I done a whole lotta thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of cheatin',
 And I, maybe I did some just to please.
 But I just walloped a lotta pizza after makin' our peace,
 Puts ya down on bended knees.
 
 Silent weekend,
 Man alive, I'm burnin' up on my brain.
 Silent weekend,
 Man alive, I'm burnin' up on my brain.
 She knows when I'm just teasin'
 But it's not likely in the season
 To open up a passenger train.
   

 SILVIO
                                       
 Stake my future on a hell of a past
 Looks like tomorrow is coming on fast
 Ain't complaining 'bout what I got
 Seen better times, but who has not?

 Silvio
 Silver and gold
 Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
 Silvio
 I gotta go
 Find out something only dead men know

 Honest as the next jade rolling that stone
 When I come knocking don't throw me no bone
 I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
 If you don't like it you can leave me alone
 
 I can snap my fingers and require the rain
 From a clear blue sky and turn it off again
 I can stroke your body and relieve your pain
 And charm the whistle off an evening train
 
 I give what I got until I got no more
 I take what I get until I even the score
 You know I love you and furthermore
 When it's time to go you got an  open door

 I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain
 You give something up for everything you gain
 Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain
 Pay for your ticket and don't complain

 One of these days and it won't be long
 Going down in the valley and sing my song
 I will sing it loud and sing it strong
 Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong

 Silvio
 Silver and gold
 Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
 Silvio
 I gotta go
 Find out something only dead men know
   

 SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE
                                       
 They sat together in the park
 As the evening sky grew dark,
 She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones.
 'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
 And watched out for a simple twist of fate.

 They walked along by the old canal
 A little confused, I remember well
 And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin' bright.
 He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
 Moving with a simple twist of fate.

 A saxophone someplace far off played
 As she was walkin' by the arcade.
 As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin' up,
 She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
 And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
 
 He woke up, the room was bare
 He didn't see her anywhere.
 He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
 Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
 Brought on by a simple twist of fate.

 He hears the ticking of the clocks
 And walks along with a parrot that talks,
 Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailers all come in.
 Maybe she'll pick him out again, how long must he wait
 Once more for a simple twist of fate.

 People tell me it's a sin
 To know and feel too much within.
 I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring.
 She was born in spring, but I was born too late
 Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
   

 SITTING ON A BARBED WIRE FENCE
                                       
 I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents
 I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents
 See my hound dog bite a rabbit
 And my football's sittin' on a barbed-wire fence

 Well, my temperature rises and my feet don't walk so fast
 Yes, my temperature rises and my feet don't walk so fast
 Well, this Arabian doctor came in, gave me a shot
 But wouldn't tell me if what I had would last

 Well, this woman I've got, she's filling me with her drive
 Yes, this woman I've got, she's thrillin' me with her hive
 She's calling me Stan
 Or else she calls me Mister Clive

 Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff
 I know you're gonna think this song is a cliff
 Unless you've been inside a tunnel
 And fell down 69, 70 feet over a barbed-wire fence

 All night!
    

 SITTIN' ON TOP OF THE WORLD
                                       
 Was in the summer,
 One early fall,
 Just tryin' to find my
 Little all and all
 Now she's gone,
 An' I don't worry.
 Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.

 Was in the spring,
 One summer's day,
 Just when she left me,
 She gone to stay.
 Now she's gone,
 An' I don't worry.
 Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.

 Now don't come runnin'
 Holdin' up your hand,
 Can get me a woman
 Quick as you can get a man.
 Now she's gone,
 An' I don't worry.
 Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.
 
 Happen for days,
 Didn't know your name,
 Oh, why should I worry
 Or crave you in vain?
 Now she's gone,
 An' I don't worry.
 Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.

 Went to the station,
 Down in the yard,
 Gonna get me a freight train,
 Work's done got hard.
 Now she's gone,
 An' I don't worry.
 Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.

 The lonesome days,
 They have gone by,
 Why should I beg you?
 You said good-bye.
 Now she's gone,
 An' I don't worry.
 Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.
   

 SLOW TRAIN
                                       
 Sometimes I feel so low-down and disgusted
 Can't help but wonder what's happenin' to my companions,
 Are they lost or are they found, have they counted the cost it'll take to
     bring down
 All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
 There's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.
 
 I had a woman down in Alabama,
 She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
 She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
 You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
 There's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.
 
 All that foreign oil controlling American soil,
 Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed.
 Sheiks walkin' around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose rings,
 Deciding America's future from Amsterdam and to Paris
 And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.

 Man's ego is inflated, his laws are outdated, they don't apply no more,
 You can't rely no more to be standin' around waitin'
 In the home of the brave, Jefferson turnin' over in his grave,
 Fools glorifying themselves, trying to manipulate Satan
 And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.

 Big-time negotiators, false healers and woman haters,
 Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition
 But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
 All non-believers and men stealers talkin' in the name of religion
 And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.

 People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting
 Oh, you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it.
 They say lose your inhibitions, follow your own ambitions,
 They talk about a life of brotherly love, show me someone who knows how to
     live it.
 There's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.

 Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talkin' boy she could destroy
 A real suicide case, but there was nothin' I could do to stop it,
 I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy
 But it sure do bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets,
 There's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.
   

 SOLID ROCK
                                       
 Well, I'm hangin' on to a solid rock
 Made before the foundation of the world
 And I won't let go, and I can't let go, won't let go
 And I can't let go, won't let go, and I can't let go no more.

 For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
 For me he was rejected by a world that He created.
 Nations are angry, cursed are some,
 People are expecting a false peace to come.

 Well, I'm hangin' on to a solid rock
 Made before the foundation of the world
 And I won't let go, and I can't let go, won't let go
 And I can't let go, won't let go, and I can't let go no more.

 It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit
 Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it
 Using all the devices under the sun.
 And He never give up 'til the battle's lost or won.

 Well, I'm hangin' on to a solid rock
 Made before the foundation of the world
 And I won't let go, and I can't let go, won't let go
 And I can't let go, won't let go, and I can't let go no more.
   

 SOMETHING'S BURNING, BABY
                                       
 Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
 Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair
 Are you still my friend, baby, show me a sign
 Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?

 You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while
 The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file
 What's your position, baby, what's going on?
 Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?

 I know everything about this place, or so it seems
 Am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
 Well, it is so obvious that something has changed
 What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?

 Something is burning, baby, here's what I say
 Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today
 I see the shadow of a man, baby, makin' you blue
 Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?

 We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins
 Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins
 But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
 Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?

 I can feel it in the night when I think of you
 I can feel it in the light and it's got to be true
 You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied
 You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied

 Got to start someplace, baby, can you explain?
 Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train
 Answer me, baby, a casual look will do
 Just what in the world has come over you?

 I can feel it in the wind and it's upside down
 I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town
 I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve
 I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need but it ain't what you
     deserve

 Something is burning, baby, something's in flames
 There's a man going 'round calling names
 Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you
 I believe in the impossible, you know that I do
   

 SOMETHING THERE IS ABOUT YOU
                                       
 Something there is about you that strikes a match in me
 Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
 Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be
 Somethin' that crossed over from another century?

 Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth
 Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walkin' the hills of old Duluth.
 There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black night and then there was Ruth
 Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.

 Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings
 Don't have to look no further, you're the soul of many things.
 I could say that I'd be faithful, I could say it in one sweet, easy breath
 But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.

 Something there is about you that moves with style and grace
 I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place.
 My hand's on the sabre and you've picked up the baton
 Somethin' there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
   

 SOMEONE'S GOT A HOLD OF MY HEART
                                       
 They say "Drink and be merry,
 Take the bull by the horns."
 I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns
 Everything looks a little far away to me

 Gettin' harder and harder to recognize the trap
 Too much information about nothin'
 Too much educated rap
 It's just like you told me, just like you said it would be

 The moon rising like wildfire
 I feel the breath of a skunk
 Something I got to do tonight
 You go inside and stay warm

 Someone's got a hold of my heart
 Someone's got a hold of my heart
 Someone's got a hold of my heart
 You-
 Yeah, you got a hold of my heart

 Just got back from a city of powder blue skies
 Everybody thinks with their stomach
 There's plenty of spies
 Every street is crooked, they just wind around till they disappear

 Madame Butterfly, she lulls me to sleep
 Like an ancient river
 So wide and deep
 She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothin' worth stealin' here"

 You're the one I've been waitin' for
 You're the one I desire
 But you must first realize
 I'm not another man for hire

 Someone's got a hold of my heart
 Someone's got a hold of my heart
 Someone's got a hold of my heart
 You, you, you, you
 Yeah, you got a hold of my heart

 I hear the hot-blooded singer
 On the bandstand croon
 September song, Memphis in June
 While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a flaming red wig

 I been to Babylon
 I gotta confess
 I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness
 What looks large from a distance, close up is never that big
 Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine
 Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.

 Someone's got a hold of my heart
 Someone's got a hold of my heart
 Someone's got a hold of my heart
 You-
 Yeah, you got a hold of my heart
   

 SONG TO WOODY
                                       
 I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
 Walkin' a road other men have gone down.
 I'm seein' your world of people and things,
 Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.

 Hey, hey Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
 'Bout a funny ol' world that's a-comin' along.
 Seems sick an' it's hungry, it's tired an' it's torn,
 It looks like it's a-dyin' an' it's hardly been born.

 Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
 All the things that I'm a-sayin' an' a-many times more.
 I'm a-singin' you the song, but I can't sing enough,
 'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
 
 Here's to Cisco an' Sonny an' Leadbelly too,
 An' to all the good people that traveled with you.
 Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
 That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.

 I'm a-leaving' tomorrow, but I could leave today,
 Somewhere down the road someday.
 The very last thing that I'd want to do
 Is to say I've been hittin' some hard travelin' too.
   

 ONE OF US MUST KNOW
 (Sooner or Later)
                                       
 I didn't mean to treat you so bad
 You shouldn't take it so personal
 I didn't mean to make you so sad
 You just happened to be there, that's all
 When I saw you say "goodbye" to your friend and smile
 I thought that it was well understood
 That you'd be comin' back in a little while
 I didn't know that you were sayin' "goodbye" for good

 But, sooner or later, one of us must know
 You just did what you're supposed to do
 Sooner or later, one of us must know
 That I really did try to get close to you
 
 I couldn't see what you could show me
 Your scarf had kept your mouth well hid
 I couldn't see how you could know me
 But you said you knew me and I believed you did
 When you whispered in my ear
 And asked me if I was leavin' with you or her
 I didn't realize just what I did hear
 I didn't realize how young you were
 
 But, sooner or later, one of us must know
 You just did what you're supposed to do
 Sooner or later, one of us must know
 That I really did try to get close to you
 
 I couldn't see when it started snowin'
 Your voice was all that I heard
 I couldn't see where we were goin'
 But you said you knew an' I took your word
 And then you told me later, as I apologized
 That you were just kiddin' me, you weren't really from the farm
 An' I told you, as you clawed out my eyes
 That I never really meant to do you any harm
 
 But, sooner or later, one of us must know
 You just did what you're supposed to do
 Sooner or later, one of us must know
 That I really did try to get close to you
   

 SPANISH HARLEM INCIDENT
                                       
 Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
 Cannot hold you to its heat.
 Your temperature's too hot for taming,
 Your flaming feet burn up the street.
 I am homeless, come and take me
 Into reach of your rattling drums.
 Let me know, babe, about my fortune
 Down along my restless palms.
 
 Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
 I have fallen far beneath
 Your pearly eyes, so fast an' slashing,
 An' your flashing diamond teeth.
 The night is pitch black, come an' make my
 Pale face fit into place, ah, please!
 Let me know, babe, I got to know, babe,
 If it's you my lifelines trace.

 I been wond'rin' all about me
 Ever since I seen you there.
 On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding,
 I know I'm 'round you but I don't know where.
 You have slayed me, you have made me,
 I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
 I got to know, babe, will I be touching you
 So I can tell if I'm really real.
    

 SPANISH IS THE LOVING TONGUE
                                       
 Broke her heart, lost my own
 Adios, Mi corazon

 Spanish is the loving tongue
 Soft as music, light as spray
 'Twas a girl I learned it from
 Living down Sonora way
 I don't look much like a lover
 Still I say her loved words over
 Mostly when I'm all alone!
 Mi amor, Mi corazon

 Haven't seen her since that night
 I can't cross the line you know
 Wanted for a gambling fight
 Like as not it's better so
 Still I've always kind of missed her
 Since that last sad night I kissed her
 Broke her heart, lost my own
 Adios, Mi corazon

 Broke her heart, lost my own
 Adios, Mi corazon
 Adios, Mi corazon
   

 STACK A LEE
                                       
 Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
 Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
 All about that John B. Stetson hat.

 Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room, and he called for a glass of beer,
 Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doin' here?"
 "Waitin' for a train, please bring my woman home.

 "Stack-A-Lee, oh Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
 Got three little children and a-weepin', lovin' wife.
 You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
 
 "God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife.
 You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
 All about that John B. Stetson hat.
 
 Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
 Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
 All about that John B. Stetson hat.
 
 Sent for the doctor, well the doctor he did come,
 Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?"
 You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
 
 Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack,
 Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
 All about that John B. Stetson hat.
 
 Hawlin Alley, thought I heard the bulldogs bark.
 It must have been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
 He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
 
 High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep.
 High police catched Stack-A-Lee, and he jumped forty feet.
 He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
 
 Well they got old Stack-A-Lee and they laid him right back in jail.
 Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A-Lee's bail
 All about that John B. Stetson hat.
 
 Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep.
 'Round my bedside Billy Lyons began to creep."
 All about that John B. Stetson hat.
   

 STANDING ON THE HIGHWAY
                                       
 Well, I'm standin' on the highway
 Tryin' to bum a ride, tryin' to bum a ride,
 Tryin' to bum a ride.
 Well, I'm standin' on the highway
 Tryin' to bum a ride, tryin' to bum a ride,
 Tryin' to bum a ride.
 Nobody seem to know me,
 Everybody pass me by.

 Well, I'm standin' on the highway
 Tryin' to hold up, tryin' to hold up,
 Tryin to hold up and be brave.
 Well, I'm standin' on the highway
 Tryin' to hold up, tryin to hold up and be brave.
 One roads goin' to the bright lights,
 The others goin' down to my grave.

 Well, I'm lookin' down at two card,
 They seem to be handmade.
 Well, I'm lookin' down at two card,
 They seem to be handmade.
 One looks like it's the ace of diamonds,
 The other looks like it is the ace of spades.
 
 Well, I'm standin' on the highway
 Watchin' my life roll by.
 Well, I'm standin' on the highway
 Watchin' my life roll by.
 Well, I'm standin' on the highway
 Tryin' to bum a ride.
 
 Well, I'm standin' on the highway
 Wonderin' where everybody went, wonderin' where everybody went,
 Wonderin' where everybody went.
 Well, I'm standin' on the highway
 Wonderin' where everybody went, wonderin' where everybody went,
 Wonderin' where everybody went.
 Please mister, pick me up,
 I swear I ain't gonna kill nobody's kids.
 
 I wonder if my good gal,
 I wonder if she knows I'm here,
 Nobody else seems to know I'm here.
 I wonder if my good gal,
 I wonder if she knows I'm here,
 Nobody else seems to know I'm here.
 If she knows I'm here, Lawd,
 I wonder if she said a prayer.
   

 STANDING IN THE DOORWAY
                                       
 I'm walkin' through the summer nights
 The jukebox playing low
 Yesterday everything was goin' too fast
 Today it's movin' too slow

 I got no place left to turn
 I got nothin' left to burn
 
 Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you
 It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow
 You left me standing in the doorway cryin'
 I got nothin' to go back to now.
 
 The light in this place is so bad
 Makin' me sick in the head
 All the laughter is just makin' me sad
 The stars have turned cherry red
 
 I'm strummin' on my gay guitar
 Smokin' a cheap cigar
 
 The ghost of our old love has not gone away
 Don't look it like it will anytime soon
 You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
 Under the midnight moon.
 
 Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't
 But not tonight and it won't be here
 There are things I could say, but I don't
 I know the mercy of God must be near
 
 I been ridin a midnight train
 Got ice water in my veins
 
 I would be crazy if I took you back
 It would go up against every rule
 You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
 Sufferin' like a fool.

 When the last rays of daylight go down
 Buddy you're old no more
 I can hear the church bells ringin' in the yard
 I wonder who they're ringin' for

 I know I can't win
 But my heart just won't give in
 
 Last night I danced with a stranger
 But she just reminded me you were the one
 You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
 In the dark land of the sun.

 I eat when I'm hungry drink when I'm dry
 And live my life on the square
 And even if the flesh falls off of my face
 I know someone will be there to care

 It always means so much
 Even the softest touch
 
 I see nothing to be gained by any explanation
 There's no words that need to be said
 You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
 Blues wrapped around my head
   

 STEEL BARS
                                       
 In the night I hear you speak
 Turn around, you're in my sleep
 Feel your hands inside your soul
 You're holding on and won't let go

 I've tried running but there's no escape
 Can't bend them, and (I know) I just can't break these...
 
 Steel bars, wrapped all around me
 I've been your prisoner since the day you found me
 I'm bound forever, till the end of time
 Steel bars wrapped around this heart of mine

 Trying hard to recognize
 See the face behind the eyes
 Feel your haunting ways like chains
 'Round my heart they still remain

 I'm still running, but there's nowhere to hide
 My love for you has got me locked up inside these...
 
 Steel bars, wrapped all around me
 I've been your prisoner since the day you found me
 I'm bound forever, till the end of time
 Steel bars wrapped around this heart of mine

 And with every step I take
 Every desperate move I make
 It's clear to me
 What can all my living mean
 When time itself is so obscene
 When time itself don't mean a thing
 I'm still loving you
 
 Steel bars, wrapped all around me
 I've been your prisoner since the day you found me
 I'm bound forever, till the end of time
 Steel bars wrapped around this heart of mine
   

 STEP IT UP AND GO
                                       
 Got a little girl, little and low,
 She used to love me but she don't no more.
 She gotta step it up and go-Yeah, go,
 Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.

 Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
 Make a livin' by puttin' on airs.
 Gotta step it up and go-Yeah, man,
 Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.

 Front door shut, back door too,
 Blinds pulled down, what'cha gonna do?
 Gotta step it up and go-Yeah, go,
 Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.

 Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
 Give a little bit, she took it all.
 I said step it up and go-Yeah, man,
 Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.

 Me an' my baby walkin' down the street,
 Tellin' everybody 'bout the chief of police.
 Gotta step it up and go-Yeah, go.
 Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.

 Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
 Ain't no lovin' since she been gone.
 Gotta step it up and go-Yeah, go.
 Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.

 Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more,
 Hear my gal call me and I got to go.
 Step it up and go-Yeah, man.
 Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.

 
 STUCK INSIDE OF MOBILE WITH THE MEMPHIS BLUES AGAIN
                                       
 Oh, the ragman draws circles
 Up and down the block.
 I'd ask him what the matter was
 But I know that he don't talk.
 And the ladies treat me kindly
 And furnish me with tape,
 But deep inside my heart
 I know I can't escape.
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end,
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 With the Memphis blues again.

 Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley
 With his pointed shoes and his bells,
 Speaking to some French girl,
 Who says she knows me well.
 And I would send a message
 To find out if she's talked,
 But the post office has been stolen
 And the mailbox is locked.
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end,
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 With the Memphis blues again.

 Mona tried to tell me
 To stay away from the train line.
 She said that all the railroad men
 Just drink up your blood like wine.
 An' I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
 But then again, there's only one I've met
 An' he just smoked my eyelids
 An' punched my cigarette."
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end,
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 With the Memphis blues again.

 Grandpa died last week
 And now he's buried in the rocks,
 But everybody still talks about
 How badly they were shocked.
 But me, I expected it to happen,
 I knew he'd lost control
 When he built a fire on Main Street
 And shot it full of holes.
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end,
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 With the Memphis blues again.
 
 Now the senator came down here
 Showing ev'ryone his gun,
 Handing out free tickets
 To the wedding of his son.
 An' me, I nearly got busted
 An' wouldn't it be my luck
 To get caught without a ticket
 And be discovered beneath a truck.
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end,
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 With the Memphis blues again.

 Now the preacher looked so baffled
 When I asked him why he dressed
 With twenty pounds of headlines
 Stapled to his chest.
 But he cursed me when I proved it to him,
 Then I whispered, "Not even you can hide.
 You see, you're just like me,
 I hope you're satisfied."
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end,
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 With the Memphis blues again.
 
 Now the rainman gave me two cures,
 Then he said, "Jump right in."
 The one was Texas medicine,
 The other was just railroad gin.
 An' like a fool I mixed them
 An' it strangled up my mind,
 An' now people just get uglier
 An' I have no sense of time.
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end,
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 With the Memphis blues again.

 When Ruthie says come see her
 In her honky-tonk lagoon,
 Where I can watch her waltz for free
 'Neath her Panamanian moon.
 An' I say, "Aw come on now,
 You must know about my debutante."
 An' she says, "Your debutante just knows what you need
 But I know what you want."
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end,
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 With the Memphis blues again.
 
 Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
 Where the neon madmen climb.
 They all fall there so perfectly,
 It all seems so well timed.
 An' here I sit so patiently
 Waiting to find out what price
 You have to pay to get out of
 Going through all these things twice.
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end,
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 With the Memphis blues again.


 SUBTERRANEAN HOMESICK BLUES
   
 Johnny's in the basement
 Mixing up the medicine
 I'm on the pavement
 Thinking about the government
 The man in the trench coat
 Badge out, laid off
 Says he's got a bad cough
 Wants to get it paid off
 Look out kid
 It's somethin' you did
 God knows when
 But you're doin' it again
 You better duck down the alley way
 Lookin' for a new friend
 The man in the coon-skin cap
 In the big pen
 Wants eleven dollar bills
 You only got ten

 Maggie comes fleet foot
 Face full of black soot
 Talkin' that the heat put
 Plants in the bed but
 The phone's tapped anyway
 Maggie says that many say
 They must bust in early May
 Orders from the D. A.
 Look out kid
 Don't matter what you did
 Walk on your tip toes
 Don't try "No Doz"
 Better stay away from those
 That carry around a fire hose
 Keep a clean nose
 Watch the plain clothes
 You don't need a weather man
 To know which way the wind blows
 
 Get sick, get well
 Hang around a ink well
 Ring bell, hard to tell
 If anything is goin' to sell
 Try hard, get barred
 Get back, write braille
 Get jailed, jump bail
 Join the army, if you fail
 Look out kid
 You're gonna get hit
 But users, cheaters
 Six-time losers
 Hang around the theaters
 Girl by the whirlpool
 Lookin' for a new fool
 Don't follow leaders
 Watch the parkin' meters
 
 Ah get born, keep warm
 Short pants, romance, learn to dance
 Get dressed, get blessed
 Try to be a success
 Please her, please him, buy gifts
 Don't steal, don't lift
 Twenty years of schoolin'
 And they put you on the day shift
 Look out kid
 They keep it all hid
 Better jump down a manhole
 Light yourself a candle
 Don't wear sandals
 Try to avoid the scandals
 Don't wanna be a bum
 You better chew gum
 The pump don't work
 'Cause the vandals took the handles
   

 SWEETHEART LIKE YOU
                                             
 Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here,
 He gone North, he ain't around,
 They say that vanity got the best of him
 But he sure left here after sundown.
 By the way, that's a cute hat,
 And that smile's so hard to resist
 But what's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?

 You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
 She wanted a whole man, not just a half,
 She used to call me sweet daddy when I was only a child,
 You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
 In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear,
 It's done with a flick of the wrist.
 What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?
 
 You know, a woman like you should be at home,
 That's where you belong,
 Watching out for someone who loves you true
 Who would never do you wrong.
 Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
 Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
 What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?
 
 You know you can make a name for yourself,
 You can hear them tires squeal,
 You can be known as the most beautiful woman
 Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
 
 You know, news of you has come down the line
 Even before ya came in the door.
 They say in your father's house, there's many mansions
 Each one of them got a fireproof floor.
 Snap out of it, baby, people are jealous of you,
 They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
 What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?
 
 Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
 Got to have done some evil deed,
 Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
 Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
 
 They say that patriotism is the last refuge
 To which a scoundrel clings.
 Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
 Steal a lot and they make you king.
 There's only one step down from here, baby,
 It's called the land of permanent bliss.
 What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?
   

 TALKIN' HAVA NEGEILAH BLUES
                                       
 Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah-
 Ha-va-ne-gei-lah
 O-de-ley-e-e-oo-
   

 TALKING NEW YORK BLUES
                                       
 Ramblin' outa the wild West,
 Leavin' the towns I love the best.
 Thought I'd seen some ups and down,
 Til I come into New York town.
 People goin' down to the ground,
 Buildings goin' up to the sky.

 Wintertime in New York town,
 The wind blowin' snow around.
 Walk around with nowhere to go,
 Somebody could freeze right to the bone.
 I froze right to the bone.
 New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years;
 I didn't feel so cold then.

 I swung on to my old guitar,
 Grabbed hold of a subway car,
 And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride,
 I landed up on the downtown side;
 Greenwich Village.
 
 I walked down there and ended up
 In one of them coffee-houses on the block.
 Got on the stage to sing and play,
 Man there said, "Come back some other day,
 You sound like a hillbilly;
 We want folk singers here."

 Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
 Blowin' my lungs out for a dollar a day.
 I blowed inside out and upside down.
 The man there said he loved m' sound,
 He was ravin' about how he loved m' sound;
 Dollar a day's worth.
 
 And after weeks and weeks of hangin' around,
 I finally got a job in New York town,
 In a bigger place, bigger money too,
 Even joined the union and paid m' dues.
 
 Now, a very great man once said
 That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
 It didn't take too long to find out
 Just what he was talkin' about.
 A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
 But they got a lot of forks Ôn' knives,
 And they gotta cut somethin'.
 
 So one mornin' when the sun was warm,
 I rambled out of New York town.
 Pulled my cap down over my eyes
 And headed out for the western skies.
 So long, New York.
 Howdy, East Orange.
   

 TALKIN' JOHN BIRCH PARANOID BLUES
                                       
 Well, I was feelin' sad and feelin' blue,
 I didn't know what in the world I was gonna do,
 Them Communists they wus comin' around,
 They wus in the air,
 They wus on the ground.
 They wouldn't gimme no peace. . .

 So I run down most hurriedly
 And joined up with the John Birch Society,
 I got me a secret membership card
 And started off a-walkin' down the road.
 Yee-hoo, I'm a real John Bircher now!
 Look out you Commies!

 Now we all agree with Hitlers' views,
 Although he killed six million Jews.
 It don't matter too much that he was a Fascist,
 At least you can't say he was a Communist!
 That's to say like if you got a cold you take a shot of malaria.
 
 Well, I wus lookin' everywhere for them gol-darned Reds.
 I got up in the mornin' 'n' looked under my bed,
 Looked in the sink, behind the door,
 Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
 Couldn't find 'em . . .
 
 I wus lookin' high an' low for them Reds everywhere,
 I wus lookin' in the sink an' underneath the chair.
 I looked way up my chimney hole,
 I even looked deep inside my toilet bowl.
 They got away . . .
 
 Well, I wus sittin' home alone an' started to sweat,
 Figured they wus in my T.V. set.
 Peeked behind the picture frame,
 Got a shock from my feet, hittin' right up in the brain.
 Them Reds caused it!
 I know they did . . . them hard-core ones.
 
 Well, I quit my job so I could work alone,
 Then I changed my name to Sherlock Holmes.
 Followed some clues from my detective bag
 And discovered they wus red stripes on the American flag!
 That ol' Betty Ross . . .
 
 Well, I investigated all the books in the library,
 Ninety percent of 'em gotta be burned away.
 I investigated all the people that I knowed,
 Ninety-eight percent of them gotta go.
 The other two percent are fellow Birchers . . . just like me.
 
 Now Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
 Lincoln, Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
 To my knowledge there's just one man
 That's really a true American:  George Lincoln Rockwell.
 I know for a fact he hates Commies cus he picketed the movie Exodus.
 
 Well, I fin'ly started thinkin' straight
 When I run outa things to investigate.
 Couldn't imagine doin' anything else,
 So now I'm sittin' home investigatin' myself!
 Hope I don't find out anything . . . hmm, great God!
   

 TALKIN' BEAR MOUNTAIN PICNIC MASSACRE BLUES
                                       
 I saw it advertised one day,
 Bear Mountain picnic was comin' my way.
 "Come along 'n' take a trip,
 We'll bring you up there on a ship.
 Bring the wife and kids
 Bring the whole family."
 Yippee!
 
 Well, I run right down 'n' bought a ticket
 To this Bear Mountain Picnic.
 But little did I realize
 I was in for a picnic surprise.
 Had nothin' to do with mountains.
 I didn't even come close to a bear.
 
 Took the wife 'n' kids down to the pier,
 Six thousand people there,
 Everybody had ticket for the trip.
 "Oh well." I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
 Besides, anyway, the more the merrier."
 
 Well, we all got on 'n' what d'ya think,
 That big old boat started t' sink
 More people kept a-pilin' on,
 That old ship was  a-slowly goin' down.
 Funny way t' start a picnic.
 
 Well, I soon lost track of m' kids 'n' wife,
 So many people there I never saw in m' life
 That old ship sinkin' down in the water,
 Six thousand people tryin' t' kill each other,
 Dogs a-barkin', cats a-meowin',
 Women screamin', fists a-flyin', babies cryin',
 Cops a-comin', me a-runnin'.
 Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
 
 I got shoved down 'n' pushed around,
 All I could hear there was a screamin' sound,
 Don't remember one thing more,
 Just remember walkin' up on a little shore,
 Head busted, stomach cracked,
 Feet splintered, I was bald, naked. . .
 Quite lucky to be alive though.
 
 Feelin' like I climbed outa m' casket,
 I grabbed back hold of m' picnic basket.
 Took the wife 'n' kids 'n' started home,
 Wishin' I'd never got up that morn.
 
 Now, I don't care just what you do,
 If you wanta have a picnic, that's up t' you.
 But don't tell me about it, I don't wanta hear it,
 ÔCause, see, I just lost all m' picnic spirit.
 Stay in m' kitchen, have m' own picnic. . .
 In the bathroom.
 
 Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
 What some people are gonna do f'r money.
 There's a bran' new gimmick every day
 Just t' take somebody's money away.
 I think we oughta take some o' these people
 And put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain . . .
 For a picnic.
   

 TALKIN' WORLD WAR III BLUES
                                       
 Some time ago a crazy dream came to me,
 I dreamt I was walkin' into World War Three,
 I went to the doctor the very next day
 To see what kinda words he could say.
 He said it was a bad dream.
 I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though,
 They were my own dreams and they're only in my head.
 
 I said, "Hold it, Doc, a World War passed through my brain."
 He said, "Nurse, get your pad, this boy's insane,"
 He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
 As I landed on the psychiatric couch,
 He said, "Tell me about it."
 
 Well, the whole thing started at 3 o'clock fast,
 It was all over by quarter past.
 I was down in the sewer with some little lover
 When I peeked out from a manhole cover
 Wondering who turned the lights on.
 
 Well, I got up and walked around
 And up and down the lonesome town.
 I stood a-wondering which way to go,
 I lit a cigarette on a parking meter
 And walked on down the road.
 It was a normal day.
 
 Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
 And I leaned my head and I gave a yell,
 "Give me a string bean, I'm a hungry man."
 A shotgun fired and away I ran.
 I don't blame them too much though,
 I know I look funny.
 
 Down at the corner by a hot-dog stand
 I seen a man, I said, "Howdy friend,
 I guess there's just us two."
 He screamed a bit and away he flew.
 Thought I was a Communist.
 
 Well, I spied a girl and before she could leave,
 "Let's go and play Adam and Eve."
 I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin'
 When she said, "Hey man, you crazy or sumpin',
 You see what happened last time they started."
 
 Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown
 And there was nobody aroun',
 I got into the driver's seat
 And I drove down 42nd Street
 In my Cadillac.
 Good car to drive after a war.
 
 Well, I remember seein' some ad,
 So I turned on my Conelrad.
 But I didn't pay my Con Ed bill,
 So the radio didn't work so well.
 Turned on my record playerÑ
 It was Rock-A-Day, Johnny singin',
 "Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa,
 Our Loves Are Gonna Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah."
 
 I was feelin' kinda lonesome and blue,
 I needed somebody to talk to.
 So I called up the operator of time
 Just to hear a voice of some kind.
 "When you hear the beep
 It will be three o'clock,"
 She said that for over an hour
 And I hung it up.
 
 Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
 Sayin, "Hey I've been havin' the same old dreams,
 But mine was a little different you see.
 I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me.
 I didn't see you around."
 
 Well, now time passed and now it seems
 Everybody's having them dreams.
 Everybody sees themselves walkin' around with no one else.
 Half of the people can be  part right all of the time,
 Some of the people can be all right part of the time.
 But all of the people canÕt be right all of the time.
 I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
 "I'll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours,"
 I said that.
   

 TANGLED UP IN BLUE
                                       
 Early one mornin' the sun was shinin',
 I was layin' in bed
 Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all
 If her hair was still red.
 Her folks they said our lives together
 Sure was gonna be rough
 They never did like Mama's homemade dress
 Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
 And I was standin' on the side of the road
 Rain fallin' on my shoes
 Heading out for the East Coast
 Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through,
 Tangled up in blue.

 She was married when we first met
 Soon to be divorced
 I helped her out of a jam, I guess,
 But I used a little too much force.
 We drove that car as far as we could
 Abandoned it out West
 Split up on a dark sad night
 Both agreeing it was best.
 She turned around to look at me
 As I was walkin' away
 I heard her say over my shoulder,
 "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,"
 Tangled up in blue.

 I had a job in the great north woods
 Working as a cook for a spell
 But I never did like it all that much
 And one day the ax just fell.
 So I drifted down to New Orleans
 Where I happened to be employed
 Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat
 Right outside of Delacroix.
 But all the while I was alone
 The past was close behind,
 I seen a lot of women
 But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
 Tangled up in blue.

 She was workin' in a topless place
 And I stopped in for a beer,
 I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
 In the spotlight so clear.
 And later on as the crowd thinned out
 I's just about to do the same,
 She was standing there in back of my chair
 Said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
 I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,
 She studied the lines on my face.
 I must admit I felt a little uneasy
 When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
 Tangled up in blue.
 
 She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
 "I thought you'd never say hello," she said
 "You look like the silent type."
 Then she opened up a book of poems
 And handed it to me
 Written by an Italian poet
 From the thirteenth century.
 And every one of them words rang true
 And glowed like burnin' coal
 Pourin' off of every page
 Like it was written in my soul from me to you,
 Tangled up in blue.
 
 I lived with them on Montague Street
 In a basement down the stairs,
 There was music in the cafes at night
 And revolution in the air.
 Then he started into dealing with slaves
 And something inside of him died.
 She had to sell everything she owned
 And froze up inside.
 And when finally the bottom fell out
 I became withdrawn,
 The only thing I knew how to do
 Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,
 Tangled up in blue.
 
 So now I'm goin' back again,
 I got to get to her somehow.
 All the people we used to know
 They're an illusion to me now.
 Some are mathematicians
 Some are carpenter's wives.
 Don't know how it all got started,
 I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.
 But me, I'm still on the road
 Headin' for another joint
 We always did feel the same,
 We just saw it from a different point of view,
 Tangled up in blue.
   

 TEARS OF RAGE
                                       
 We carried you in our arms
 On Independence Day,
 And now you'd throw us all aside
 And put us on our way.
 Oh what dear daughter 'neath the sun
 Would treat a father so,
 To wait upon him hand and foot
 And always tell him, "No"?
 Tears of rage, tears of grief,
 Why must I always be the thief?
 Come to me now, you know
 We're so alone
 And life is brief.
 
 We pointed out the way to go
 And scratched your name in sand,
 Though you just thought it was nothing more
 Than a place for you to stand.
 Now, I want you to know that while we watched,
 You discover there was no one true.
 Most ev'rybody really thought
 It was a childish thing to do.
 Tears of rage, tears of grief,
 Must I always be the thief?
 Come to me now, you know
 We're so low
 And life is brief.
 
 It was all very painless
 When you went out to receive
 All that false instruction
 Which we never could believe.
 And now the heart is filled with gold
 As if it was a purse.
 But, oh, what kind of love is this
 Which goes from bad to worse?
 Tears of rage, tears of grief,
 Must I always be the thief?
 Come to me now, you know
 We're so low
 And life is brief.
   

 TELL ME
                                       
 Tell me, I've got to know.
 Tell me, tell me before I go.
 Does that flame still burn? Does that fire still glow?
 Or has it died out and melted like the snow.
 Tell me.
 Tell me.
 
 Tell me, what are you focused upon?
 Tell me what I'll know better when you're gone.
 Tell me quick with a glance on the side.
 Shall I hold you close?
 Or Shall I let you go by?
 Tell me.
 Tell me.

 Are you looking at me and thinking of somebody else?
 Can you feel the heat and the beat of my pulse?
 Do you have any secrets that will come out in time?
 Do you lie in bed and stare at the stars?
 Is your main friend an acquaintance of ours?
 Tell me.
 Tell me.
 
 Tell me, do those neon lights blind your eyes?
 Tell me, behind what door your treasure lies.
 Ever gone broke in a big way?
 Ever gone the opposite of what the experts say?
 Tell me.
 Tell me.
 
 Is it some kind of game that you're playin' with me.
 Am I imagining something that never can be?
 Do you have any morals?
 Do you have any point of view?
 Do you long to ride on that old ship of Zion?
 What means more to you, a lap dog or a dead lion?
 Tell me.
 Tell me.

 Tell me, is my name in your book?
 Tell me, should I come back and take another look?
 Tell me the truth, tell me no lies.
 Are you someone, anyone?
 Tell me.
 Tell me.
   

 TELL ME, MOMMA
                                       
 0l' black Bascom, don't break no mirrors
 Cold black water dog, make no tears
 You say you love me with what may be love
 Don't you remember makin' baby love?
 Got your steam drill built and you're lookin' for some kid
 To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did
 But I know that you know that I know that you show
 Something is tearing up your mind.
 
 Tell me, momma,
 Tell me, momma,
 Tell me, momma, what is it?
 What's wrong with you this time?
 
 Hey, John, come and get me some candy goods
 Shucks, it sure feels like it's in the woods
 Spend some time on your January trips
 You got tombstone moose up and your brave-yard whips
 If you're anxious to find out when your friendship's gonna end
 Come on, baby, I'm your friend!
 And I know that you know that I know that you show
 Something is tearing up your mind.
 
 Tell me, momma,
 Tell me, momma,
 Tell me, momma, what is it?
 What's wrong with you this time?
 
 Ohh, we bone the editor, can't get read
 But his painted sled, instead it's a bed
 Yes, I see you on your window ledge
 But I can't tell just how far away you are from the edge
 And, anyway, you're just gonna make people jump and roar
 Whatcha wanna go and do that for?
 For I know that you know that I know that you know
 Something is tearing up your mind.
 
 Ah, tell me, momma,
 Tell me, momma,
 Tell me, momma, what is it?
 What's wrong with you this time?
   

 TELL ME THAT IT ISN'T TRUE
                                       
 I have heard rumors all over town,
 They say that you're planning to put me down.
 All I would like you to do,
 Is tell me that it isn't true.

 They say that you've been seen with some other man,
 That he's tall, dark and handsome, and you're holding his hand.
 Darlin', I'm a-countin' on you,
 Tell me that it isn't true.
 
 To know that some other man is holdin' you tight,
 It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
 
 All of those awful things that I have heard,
 I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
 So darlin', you better come through,
 Tell me that it isn't true.

 All of those awful things that I have heard,
 I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
 So darlin', I'm countin' on you,
 Tell me that it isn't true.
   

 THIS WHEEL'S ON FIRE
                                       
 If your mem'ry serves you well,
 We were goin' to meet again and wait,
 So I'm goin' to unpack all my things
 And sit before it gets too late.
 No man alive will come to you
 With another tale to tell,
 But you know that we shall meet again
 If your mem'ry serves you well.
 This wheel's on fire,
 Rolling down the road,
 Best notify my next of kin,
 This wheel shall explode!
 
 If your mem'ry serves you well,
 I was goin' to confiscate your lace,
 And wrap it up in a sailor's knot
 And hide it in your case.
 If I knew for sure that it was yours . . .
 But it was oh so hard to tell.
 But you knew that we would meet again,
 If your mem'ry serves you well.
 This wheel's on fire,
 Rolling down the road,
 Best notify my next of kin,
 This wheel shall explode!
 
 If your mem'ry serves you well,
 You'll remember you're the one
 That called on me to call on them
 To get you your favors done.
 And after ev'ry plan had failed
 And there was nothing more to tell,
 You knew that we would meet again,
 If your mem'ry served you well.
 This wheel's on fire,
 Rolling down the road,
 Best notify my next of kin,
 This wheel shall explode!


 THREE ANGELS
                                       
 Three angels up above the street,
 Each one playing a horn,
 Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
 They've been there since Christmas morn.
 The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
 Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
 One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
 The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
 The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
 A man with a badge skips by,
 Three fellas crawlin' on their way back to work,
 Nobody stops to ask why.
 The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
 Where the angels stand high on their poles,
 The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
 In this concrete world full of souls.
 The angels play on their horns all day,
 The whole earth in progression seems to pass by.
 But does anyone hear the music they play,
 Does anyone even try?
   

 'TIL I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU
                                       
 Well my nerves are exploding
 And my body is tense
 I feel like the whole world
 Got me pinned up against the fence
 I been hit too hard
 Seen too much
 Nothing can heal me now
 But your touch
 I just don't know what I'm gonna do
 I was allright 'til I fell in love with you
 
 Well my house is on fire
 Burnin' to the sky
 Well I thought it would rain
 But the clouds passed by
 I feel like I'm comin'
 To the end of my way
 But I know God is my shield
 And he won't lead me astray
 Still I don't know what I'm gonna do
 I was allright 'til I fell in love with you
 
 Boys in the street
 Beginnin' to play
 Girls like birds
 Flyin' away
 When I'm gone
 You will remember my name
 I'm gonna win my way
 To wealth and fame
 Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do
 I was allright 'til I fell in love with you
 
 Well junk's pilin' up
 Takin' up space
 My eyes feel
 Like they're fallin' off my face
 Sweat fallin' down
 I'm starin' at the floor
 I'm thinkin' about that girl
 Who won't be back no more
 I just don't know what to do
 I was allright 'til I fell in love with you
 
 Well I'm tired of talkin'
 I'm tired of tryin' to explain
 My attempts to please you
 They were all in vain
 Tomorrow night
 Before the sun goes down
 If I'm still among the livin'
 I'll be Dixie bound
 Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do
 I was allright 'til I fell in love with you
   

 TIGHT CONNECTION TO MY HEART
 (Has Anybody Seen My Love)
                                       
 Well, I had to move fast
 And I couldn't with you around my neck.
 I said I'd send for you and I did
 What did you expect?
 My hands are sweating
 And we haven't even started yet.
 I'll go along with the charade
 Until I can think my way out.
 I know it was all a big joke
 Whatever it was about.
 Someday maybe
 I'll remember to forget.
 
 I'm gonna get my coat,
 I feel the breath of a storm.
 There's something I've got to do tonight,
 You go inside and stay warm.
 
 Has anybody seen my love,
 Has anybody seen my love,
 Has anybody seen my love.
 I don't know,
 Has anybody seen my love?

 You want to talk to me,
 Go ahead and talk.
 Whatever you got to say to me
 Won't come as any shock.
 I must be guilty of something,
 You just whisper it into my ear.
 Madame Butterfly
 She lulled me to sleep,
 In a town without pity
 Where the water runs deep.
 She said, "Be easy, baby,
 There ain't nothin' worth stealin' in here."

 You're the one I've been looking for,
 You're the one that's got the key.
 But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you
 Or you're too good for me.
 
 Has anybody seen my love,
 Has anybody seen my love,
 Has anybody seen my love.
 I don't know,
 Has anybody seen my love?
 
 Well, they're not showing any lights tonight
 And there's no moon.
 There's just a hot-blooded singer
 Singing "Memphis in June,"
 While they're beatin' the devil out of a guy
 Who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
 Later he'll be shot
 For resisting arrest,
 I can still hear his voice crying
 In the wilderness.
 What looks large from a distance,
 Close up ain't never that big.

 Never could learn to drink that blood
 And call it wine,
 Never could learn to hold you, love,
 And call you mine.
   

 THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN'
                                       
 Come gather 'round people
 Wherever you roam
 And admit that the waters
 Around you have grown
 And accept it that soon
 You'll be drenched to the bone.
 If your time to you
 Is worth savin'
 Then you better start swimmin'
 Or you'll sink like a stone
 For the times they are a-changin'.
 
 Come writers and critics
 Who prophesize with your pen
 And keep your eyes wide
 The chance won't come again
 And don't speak too soon
 For the wheel's still in spin
 And there's no tellin' who
 That it's namin'.
 For the loser now
 Will be later to win
 For the times they are a-changin'.
 
 Come senators, congressmen
 Please heed the call
 Don't stand in the doorway
 Don't block up the hall
 For he that gets hurt
 Will be he who has stalled
 There's a battle outside
 And it is ragin'.
 It'll soon shake your windows
 And rattle your walls
 For the times they are a-changin'.
 
 Come mothers and fathers
 Throughout the land
 And don't criticize
 What you can't understand
 Your sons and your daughters
 Are beyond your command
 Your old road is
 Rapidly agin'.
 Please get out of the new one
 If you can't lend your hand
 For the times they are a-changin'.

 The line it is drawn
 The curse it is cast
 The slow one now
 Will later be fast
 As the present now
 Will later be past
 The order is
 Rapidly fadin'.
 And the first one now
 Will later be last
 For the times they are a-changin'.
   

 TIME PASSES SLOWLY
                                       
 Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
 We sit beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
 Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream,
 Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
 
 Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-lookin',
 We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cookin',
 Stared out the window to the stars high above,
 Time passes slowly when you're searchin' for love.

 Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
 Ain't no reason to go to the fair.
 Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
 Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
 
 Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
 We stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right,
 Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day,
 Time passes slowly and fades away.
   

 TINY MONTGOMERY
                                       
 Well you can tell ev'rybody
 Down in ol' Frisco
 Tell 'em
 Tiny Montgomery says hello

 Now ev'ry boy and girl's
 Gonna get their bang
 'Cause Tiny Montgomery's
 Gonna shake that thing
 Tell ev'rybody
 Down in ol' Frisco
 That Tiny Montgomery's comin'
 Down to say hello

 Skinny Moo and
 Half-track Frank
 They're gonna both be gettin'
 Outa the tank
 One bird book
 And a buzzard and a crow
 Tell 'em all
 That Tiny's gonna say hello
 
 Scratch your dad
 Do that bird
 Suck that pig
 And bring it on home
 Pick that drip
 And bake that dough
 Tell 'em all
 That Tiny says hello
 
 Now he's king of the drunks
 An' he squeezes, too
 Watch out, Lester
 Take it, Lou
 Join the monks
 The C.I.O.
 Tell 'em all
 That Tiny Montgomery says hello
 
 Now grease that pig
 And sing praise
 Go on out
 And gas that dog
 Trick on in
 Honk that stink
 Take it on down
 And watch it grow
 Play it low
 And pick it up
 Take it on in
 In a plucking cup
 Three-legged man
 And a hot-lipped hoe
 Tell 'em all
 Montgomery says hello
 
 Well you can tell ev'rybody
 Down in ol' Frisco
 Tell 'em all
 Montgomery says hello
   

 TEMPORARY LIKE ACHILLES
                                       
 Standing on your window, honey,
 Yes, I've been here before.
 Feeling so harmless,
 I'm looking at your second door.
 How come you don't send me no regards?
 You know I want your lovin',
 Honey, why are you so hard?
 
 Kneeling 'neath your ceiling,
 Yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
 I'm tryin' to read your portrait, but,
 I'm helpless, like a rich man's child.
 How come you send someone out to have me barred?
 You know I want your lovin',
 Honey, why are you so hard?
 
 Like a poor fool in his prime,
 Yes, I know you can hear me walk,
 But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime,
 Or is it just solid rock?
 
 Well, I rush into your hallway,
 Lean against your velvet door.
 I watch upon your scorpion
 Who crawls across your circus floor.
 Just what do you think you have to guard?
 You know I want your lovin',
 Honey, but you're so hard.
 
 Achilles is in your alleyway,
 He don't want me here,
 He does brag.
 He's pointing to the sky
 And he's hungry, like a man in drag.
 How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
 You know I want your lovin',
 Honey. but you're so hard.
   

 TO BE ALONE WITH YOU
                                       
 To be alone with you
 Just you and me
 Now won't you tell me true
 Ain't that the way it oughta be?
 To hold each other tight
 The whole night through
 Ev'rything is always right
 When I'm alone with you.
 
 To be alone with you
 At the close of the day
 With only you in view
 While evening slips away
 It only goes to show
 That while life's pleasures be few
 The only one I know
 Is when I'm alone with you.
 
 They say that nighttime is the right time
 To be with the one you love
 Too many thoughts get in the way in the day
 But you're always what I'm thinkin' of
 I wish the night were here
 Bringin' me all of your charms
 When only you are near
 To hold me in your arms.
 
 I'll always thank the Lord
 When my working day's through
 I get my sweet reward
 To be alone with you.
   

 TOMBSTONE BLUES
                                       
 The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course
 The city fathers they're trying to endorse
 The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse
 But the town has no need to be nervous

 The ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits
 To Jezebel the nun she violently knits
 A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
 At the head of the chamber of commerce

 Mama's in the fact'ry
 She ain't got no shoes
 Daddy's in the alley
 He's lookin' for the fuse
 I'm in the streets
 With the tombstone blues

 The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
 Screaming she moans, "I've just been made"
 Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
 Says, "My advice is to not let the boys in"
 
 Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
 He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
 "Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
 You will not die, it's not poison"
 
 Mama's in the fact'ry
 She ain't got no shoes
 Daddy's in the alley
 He's lookin' for the fuse
 I'm in the streets
 With the tombstone blues
 
 Well, John the Baptist after torturing a thief
 Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief
 Saying, "Tell me great hero, but please make it brief
 Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
 
 The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
 Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry"
 And dropping a bar bell he points to the sky
 Saving, "The sun's not yellow it's chicken"
 
 Mama's in the fact'ry
 She ain't got no shoes
 Daddy's in the alley
 He's lookin' for the fuse
 I'm in the streets
 With the tombstone blues
 
 The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
 Put jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
 Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
 Then sends them out to the jungle

 Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
 With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
 With a fantastic collection of stamps
 To win friends and influence his uncle
 
 Mama's in the fact'ry
 She ain't got no shoes
 Daddy's in the alley
 He's lookin' for the fuse
 I'm in the streets
 With the tombstone blues

 The geometry of innocence flesh on the bone
 Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
 At Delilah who sits worthlessly alone
 But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter
 
 Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
 I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
 Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
 He could die happily ever after

 Mama's in the fact'ry
 She ain't got no shoes
 Daddy's in the alley
 He's lookin' for the fuse
 I'm in the streets
 With the tombstone blues

 Where Ma Raney and Beethoven once unwrapped their bed roll
 Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
 And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
 To the old folks home and the college

 Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
 That could hold you dear lady from going insane
 That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
 Of your useless and pointless knowledge

 Mama's in the fact'ry
 She ain't got no shoes
 Daddy's in the alley
 He's lookin' for the fuse
 I'm in the streets
 With the tombstone blues
   

 TOMORROW IS A LONG TIME
                                       
 If today was not an endless highway,
 If tonight was not a crooked trail,
 If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
 Then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all.
 Yes, and only if my own true love was waitin',
 Yes, and if I could hear her heart a-softly poundin',
 Only if she was lyin' by me,
 Then I'd lie in my bed once again.

 I can't see my reflection in the waters,
 I can't speak the sounds that show no pain,
 I can't hear the echo of my footsteps,
 Or can't remember the sound of my own name.
 Yes, and only if my own true love was waitin',
 Yes, and if I could hear her heart a-softly poundin',
 Only if she was lyin' by me,
 Then I'd lie in my bed once again.

 There's beauty in the silver, singin' river,
 There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky,
 But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
 That I remember in my true love's eyes.
 Yes, and only if my own true love was waitin',
 Yes, and if I could hear her heart a-softly poundin',
 Only if she was lyin' by me,
 Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
   

 TONIGHT I'LL BE STAYING HERE WITH YOU
                                       
 Throw my ticket out the window,
 Throw my suitcase out there, too,
 Throw my troubles out the door,
 I don't need them any more
 'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.

 I should have left this town this morning
 But it was more than I could do.
 Oh, your love comes on so strong
 And I've waited all day long
 For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.

 Is it really any wonder
 The love that a stranger might receive.
 You cast your spell and I went under,
 I find it so difficult to leave.
 
 I can hear that whistle blowin',
 I see that stationmaster, too,
 If there's a poor boy on the street,
 Then let him have my seat
 'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.

 Throw my ticket out the window,
 Throw my suitcase out there, too,
 Throw my troubles out the door,
 I don't need them any more
 'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
   

 TOO MUCH OF NOTHING
                                       
 Now, too much of nothing
 Can make a man feel ill at ease.
 One man's temper might rise
 While another man's temper might freeze.
 In the day of confession
 We cannot mock a soul.
 Oh, when there's too much of nothing,
 No one has control.

 Say hello to Valerie
 Say hello to Vivian
 Send them all my salary
 On the waters of oblivion
 
 Too much of nothing
 Can make a man abuse a king.
 He can walk the streets and boast like most
 But he wouldn't know a thing.
 Now, it's all been done before,
 It's all been written in the book,
 But when there's too much of nothing,
 Nobody should look.

 Say hello to Valerie
 Say hello to Vivian
 Send them all my salary
 On the waters of oblivion
 
 Too much of nothing
 Can turn a man into a liar,
 It can cause one man to sleep on nails
 And another man to eat fire.
 Ev'rybody's doin' somethin',
 I heard it in a dream,
 But when there's too much of nothing,
 It just makes a fella mean.

 Say hello to Valerie
 Say hello to Vivian
 Send them all my salary
 On the waters of oblivion
   

 TO RAMONA
                                       
 Ramona, come closer,
 Shut softly your watery eyes.
 The pangs of your sadness
 Shall pass as your senses will rise.
 The flowers of the city
 Though breathlike, get deathlike at times.
 And there's no use in tryin'
 T' deal with the dyin',
 Though I cannot explain that in lines.
 
 Your cracked country lips,
 I still wish to kiss,
 As to be under the strength of your skin.
 Your magnetic movements
 Still capture the minutes I'm in.
 But it grieves my heart, love,
 To see you tryin' to be a part of
 A world that just don't exist.
 It's all just a dream, babe,
 A vacuum, a scheme, babe,
 That sucks you into feelin' like this.
 
 I can see that your head
 Has been twisted and fed
 By worthless foam from the mouth.
 I can tell you are torn
 Between stayin' and returnin'
 On back to the South.
 You've been fooled into thinking
 That the finishin' end is at hand.
 Yet there's no one to beat you,
 No one t' defeat you,
 'Cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
 
 I've heard you say many times
 That you're better 'n no one
 And no one is better 'n you.
 If you really believe that,
 You know you got
 Nothing to win and nothing to lose.
 From fixtures and forces and friends,
 Your sorrow does stem,
 That hype you and type you,
 Making you feel
 That you must be exactly like them.

 I'd forever talk to you,
 But soon my words,
 They would turn into a meaningless ring.
 For deep in my heart
 I know there is no help I can bring.
 Everything passes,
 Everything changes,
 Just do what you think you should do.
 And someday maybe,
 Who knows, baby,
 I'll come and be cryin' to you.
   

 TOUGH MAMA
                                       
 Tough Mama
 Meat shakin' on your bones
 I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stones.
 Sister's on the highway with that steel-drivin' crew,
 Papa's in the big house, his workin' days are through.
 Tough Mama
 Can I blow a little smoke on you?
 
 Dark Beauty
 Won't you move it on over and make some room?
 It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
 Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
 You came through it all the way, flyin' through the skies.
 Dark Beauty
 With that long night's journey in your eyes.
 
 Sweet Goddess
 Born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
 Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you've been.
 Jack the Cowboy went up north
 He's buried in your past.
 The Lone Wolf went out drinking
 That was over pretty fast.
 Sweet Goddess
 Your perfect stranger's comin' in at last.
 
 Silver Angel
 With the badge of the lonesome road sewed in your sleeve,
 I'd be grateful if this golden ring you would receive.
 Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
 I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch.
 Sweet Goddess
 It must be time to carve another notch.
 
 I'm crestfallen
 The world of illusion is at my door,
 I ain't a-haulin' any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
 The prison walls are crumblin', there is no end in sight,
 I've gained some recognition but I lost my appetite.
 Dark Beauty
 Meet me at the border late tonight.
   

 TRAIN A-TRAVELIN'
                                       
 There's an iron train a-travelin' that's been a-rollin' through the years,
 With a firebox of hatred and a furnace full of fears.
 If you ever heard its sound or seen its blood-red broken frame,
 Then you heard my voice a-singin' and you know my name.

 Did you ever stop to wonder 'bout the hatred that it holds?
 Did you ever see its passengers, its crazy mixed-up souls?
 Did you ever start a-thinkin' that you gotta stop that train?
 Then you heard my voice a-singin' and you know my name.

 Do you ever get tired of the preachin' sounds of fear
 When they're hammered at your head and pounded in your ear?
 Have you ever asked about it and not been answered plain?
 Then you heard my voice a-singin' and you know my name.

 I'm a-wonderin' if the leaders of the nations understand
 This murder-minded world that they're leavin' in my hands.
 Have you ever laid awake at night and wondered 'bout the same?
 Then you heard my voice a-singin' and you know my name.

 Have you ever had it on your lips or said it in your head
 That the person standin' next to you just might be misled?
 Does the raving of the maniacs make your insides go insane?
 Then you've heard my voice a-singin' and you know my name.

 Do the kill-crazy bandits and the haters get you down?
 Does the preachin' and the politics spin your head around?
 Does the burning of the buses give your heart a pain?
 Then you heard my voice a-singin' and you know my name.
   

 TROUBLE
                                       
 Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
 You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm.
 But they can't help you none when there's trouble.

 Trouble,
 Trouble, trouble, trouble,
 Nothin' but trouble.
 
 Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
 Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there.
 Revolution even ain't no solution for trouble.
 
 Trouble,
 Trouble, trouble, trouble,
 Nothin' but trouble.
 
 Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
 Persecution, execution, governments out of control.
 You can see the writing on the wall inviting trouble.
 
 Trouble,
 Trouble, trouble, trouble,
 Nothin' but trouble.
 
 Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
 You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
 Since the beginning of the universe man's been cursed by trouble.
 
 Trouble,
 Trouble, trouble, trouble,
 Nothin' but trouble.
 
 Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
 Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed.
 Look into infinity, all you see is trouble.

 Trouble,
 Trouble, trouble, trouble,
 Nothin' but trouble.
   

 TROUBLE IN MIND
                                       
 I got to know, Lord, when to pull back on the reins,
 Death can be the result of the most underrated pain.
 Satan whispers to ya, "Well, I don't want to bore ya,
 But when ya get tired of the Miss So-and-so I got another woman for ya."

 Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind,
 Lord, take away this trouble in mind.
 
 When the deeds that you do don't add up to zero,
 It's what's inside that counts, ask any war hero.
 You think you can hide but you're never alone,
 Ask Lot what he thought when his wife turned to stone.

 Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind,
 Lord, take away this trouble in mind.
 
 Here comes Satan, prince of the power of the air,
 He's gonna make you a law unto yourself, gonna build a bird's nest in your
     hair.
 He's gonna deaden your conscience Ôtil you worship the work of your own
     hands,
 You'll be serving strangers in a strange, forsaken land.

 Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind,
 Lord, take away this trouble in mind.
 
 Well, your true love has caught you where you don't belong,
 You say, "Baby, everybody's doing it so I guess it can't be wrong."
 The truth is far from you, so you know you got to lie,
 Then you're all the time defending what you can never justify.
 
 Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind,
 Lord, take away this trouble in mind.
 
 So many of my brothers, they still want to be the boss,
 They can't relate to the Lord's kingdom, they can't relate to the cross.
 They self-inflict punishment on their own broken lives,
 Put their faith in their possessions, in their jobs or their wives.
 
 Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind,
 Lord, take away this trouble in mind.
 
 When my life is over, it'll be like a puff of smoke,
 How long must I suffer, Lord, how long must I be provoked?
 Satan will give you a little taste, then he'll move in with rapid speed,
 Lord keep my blind side covered and see that I don't bleed.
   

 TRUE LOVE TENDS TO FORGET
                                       
 I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes
 When she's near me she's so hard to recognize.
 I finally realize there's no room for regret,
 True love, true love, true love tends to forget.

 Hold me, baby be near,
 You told me that you'd be sincere.
 Every day of the year's like playin' Russian roulette,
 True love, true love, true love tends to forget.

 I was lyin' down in the reeds without any oxygen
 I saw you in the wilderness among the men.
 Saw you drift into infinity and come back again
 All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.

 You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
 You're a hard worker, baby, and I know you well.
 But this weekend in hell is making me sweat,
 True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
 True love, true love, true love tends to forget.

 I was lyin' down in the reeds without any oxygen
 I saw you in the wilderness among the men.
 Saw you drift into infinity and come back again
 All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.

 You belong to me, baby, without any doubt,
 Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out.
 Don't keep me knockin' about from Mexico to Tibet,
 True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
    

 TRUST YOURSELF
                                       
 Trust yourself,
 Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
 Trust yourself,
 Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
 Don't trust me to show you beauty
 When beauty may only turn to rust.
 If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
 
 Trust yourself,
 Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
 Trust yourself,
 Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
 Don't trust me to show you the truth
 When the truth may only be ashes and dust.
 If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.

 Well, you're on your own, you always were,
 In a land of wolves and thieves.
 Don't put your hope in ungodly man
 Or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
 
 Trust yourself
 And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
 Trust yourself
 And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
 Don't trust me to show you love
 When my love may be only lust.
 If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
   

 TRYIN' TO GET TO HEAVEN
                                       
 The air is gettin' hotter, there's a rumblin' in the skies.
 I've been wadin' through the high muddy waters,
 But the heat riseth in my eyes.
 Everyday your memory goes dimmer,
 It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
 I've been walkin' through the middle of nowhere,
 Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door.
 
 When I was in Missouri, they would not let me be.
 I had to leave there in a hurry, I only saw what they let me see.
 You broke a heart that loved you,
 Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
 I've been walkin' that lonesome valley,
 Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door.
 
 People on the platforms, waitin' for the trains.
 I can hear their hearts a-beatin', like pendulum swingin' on chains.
 When you think that you've lost everything,
 You find out you can always lose a little more.
 I'm just going down the road feelin' bad,
 Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door.

 I'm goin' down the river, down to New Orleans.
 They tell me everything is gonna be all right,
 But I don't know what all right even means.
 I was ridin' in a buggy with Miss Mary Jane,
 Miss Mary Jane got a house in Baltimore.
 I've been all around the world boys,
 I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door.

 Gotta sleep down in the parlor, and relive my dreams.
 I close my eyes and I wonder, if everything is as hollow as it seems.
 Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
 No midnight/midlife? ramblers like they did before.
 I've been to Sugartown, I shook the sugar down,
 Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door
   

 T.V. TALKIN' SONG
   
 One time in London I'd gone out for a walk,
 Past a place called Hyde park where people talk
 'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view
 To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
 
 There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
 About the T.V. god and all the pain that it invokes.
 "It's too bright a light", he said, "For anybody's eyes,
 If you've never seen one it's a blessing in disguise."
 
 I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
 Two men in front of me were coming to blows
 The man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
 Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
 
 "The news of the day is on all the time,
 All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme,
 Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
 Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."

 "Pray for peace!". he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
 My thoughts began to wander.  His voice was ringing loud,
 "It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone
 No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."

 "It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
 Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
 It will scramble up your head and drag your brain about,
 Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."

 "It's all been designed", he said, "To make you lose your mind,
 And when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find."
 "Everytime you look at it, your situation's worse,
 If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."

 The crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
 There was pushing, there was shoving and everybody ran.
 The T.V. crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me,
 Later on that evening, I watched it on T.V..
   

 TWO SOLDIERS
   
 He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
 His voice was low with pain.
 "I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
 If I ride back again.
 But if you ride back and I am left,
 You'll do as much for me.
 Mother, you know, must hear the news,
 So write to her tenderly.
 
 "She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
 Her fond face pale with woe.
 Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
 I'll see her soon, I know."
 Just then the order came to charge,
 For an instant hand touched hand.
 They said, "Aye," and away they rode,
 That brave and devoted band.
 
 Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
 The rebels they shot and shelled,
 Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks,
 And guarded them as they fell.
 There soon came a horrible dying yell
 From heights that they could not gain,
 And those whom doom and death had spared
 Rode slowly back again.
 
 But among the dead that were left on the hill
 Was the boy with the curly hair.
 The tall dark man who rode by his side
 Lay dead beside him there.
 There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
 The words that her lover had said.
 Momma, you know, awaits the news,
 And she'll only know he's dead.


 UGLIEST GIRL IN THE WORLD
                                       
 The woman that I love she got a hook in her nose
 her eyebrows meet, she wears second hand clothes
 She speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop
 I don't know why I love her but I just can't stop

 You know I love her
 Yeah I love her
 I'm in love with the Ugliest Girl in the World
 
 If I ever lose her I will go insane
 I go half crazy when she calls my name
 When she says babababababy I l-l-love you
 There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do

 You know I love her
 Yeah I love her
 I'm in love with the Ugliest Girl in the World
 
 The woman that I love she got two flat feet
 Her knees knock together walking down the street
 She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed
 She ain't much to look at but like I said

 You know I love her
 Yeah I love her
 I'm in love with the Ugliest Girl in the World

 I don't mean to say that she got nothing goin'
 She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own
 When I get low she sets me on my feet
 Got a five inch smile but her breath is sweet

 You know I love her
 Yeah I love her
 I'm in love with the Ugliest Girl in the World

 The woman that I love she a got a prizefighter nose
 Cauliflower ears and a run in her hose
 She speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop
 I don't know why I love her but I just can't stop
   

 UNBELIEVABLE
                                       
 It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
 It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
 You go north and you go south
 Just like bait in the fish's mouth.
 Ya must be livin' in the shadow of some kind of evil star.
 It's unbelievable it would get this far.

 It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
 It's indescribable it can drive you to drink.
 They said it was the land of milk and honey,
 Now they say it's the land of money.
 Who ever thought they could ever make that stick.
 It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.

 Every head is so dignified, every moon is so sanctified,
 Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
 All the silver, all the gold, all the sweethearts you can hold
 That don't come back with stories untold, are hanging on a tree.
 
 It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
 It's so impossible to even learn the tune.
 Kill that beast and feed that swine,
 Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
 Feed that horse and saddle up the drum.
 It's unbelievable, the day would finally come.

 Once there was a man who had no eyes,
 Every lady in the land told him lies,
 He stood beneath the silver skies
 And his heart began to bleed.
 Every brain is civilized,
 Every nerve is analyzed,
 Everything is criticized when you are in need.

 It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
 So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
 Turn your back, wash your hands,
 There's always someone who understands
 It don't matter no more what you got to say
 It's unbelievable it would go down this way.
   

 UNDER YOUR SPELL
                                       
 Something about you that I can't shake,
 Don't know how much of this I can take,
 Baby I'm under your spell.

 I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night.
 When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
 Baby, oh what a story I could tell.

 It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book
 If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look.
 Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.

 I'd like to help  you but I'm in a bit of a jam,
 I'll  call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am.
 Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
 
 But I will be back, I will survive,
 You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive.
 Baby, can't you tell.

 Well it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
 I'm starin' at your picture, I'm hearin' your words.
 Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.

 Everywhere you go it's enough to break hearts
 Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
 You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow.
 I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.

 Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
 Don't think I 'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
 Baby, is there anything left to tell?

 I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
 Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
 Baby, what more can I tell?

 Well the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
 Pray that I don't die of thirst,
 Baby, two feet from the well.
   

 UNION SUNDOWN
                                       
 Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
 My flashlight's from Taiwan,
 My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
 My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
 You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
 And the car I drive is a Chevrolet,
 It was put together down in Argentina
 By a guy makin' thirty cents a day.
 
 Well, it's sundown on the union
 And what's made in the U.S.A.
 Sure was a good idea
 'Til greed got in the way.
 
 Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
 And the pearls are from Japan.
 Well, the dog collar's from India
 And the flower pot's from Pakistan.
 All the furniture, it says "Made in Brazil"
 Where a woman, she slaved for sure
 Bringin' home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve,
 You know, that's a lot of money to her.
 
 Well, it's sundown on the union
 And what's made in the U.S.A.
 Sure was a good idea
 'Til greed got in the way.
 
 Well, you know, lots of people complainin' that there is no work.
 I say, "Why you say that for
 When nothin' you got is U.S.-made?"
 They don't make nothin' here no more,
 You know, capitalism is above the law.
 It say, "It don't count 'less it sells."
 When it costs too much to build it at home
 You just build it cheaper someplace else.

 Well, it's sundown on the union
 And what's made in the U.S.A.
 Sure was a good idea
 'Til greed got in the way.
 
 Well, the job that you used to have,
 They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
 The unions are big business, friend,
 And they're goin' out like a dinosaur.
 They used to grow food in Kansas
 Now they want to grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
 I can see the day coming when even your home garden
 Is gonna be against the law.

 Well, it's sundown on the union
 And what's made in the U.S.A.
 Sure was a good idea
 'Til greed got in the way.
 
 Democracy don't rule the world,
 You'd better get that in your head.
 This world is ruled by violence
 But I guess that's better left unsaid.
 From Broadway to the Milky Way,
 That's a lot of territory indeed
 And a man's gonna do what he has to do
 When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.

 Well, it's sundown on the union
 And what's made in the U.S.A.
 Sure was a good idea
 'Til greed got in the way.
   

 UNDER THE RED SKY
                                       
 There was a little boy and there was a little girl
 And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
 There was a little boy and there was a little girl
 And they lived in an alley under the red sky.

 There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
 One summer's day he came passing by.
 There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
 And one day he came passing by.

 Someday little girl, everything for you is gonna be new
 Someday little girl you'll have a diamond as big as your shoe
 
 Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high.
 One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie.
 Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high.
 One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie.

 This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town
 This is the blind horse that leads you around
 
 Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
 One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
 Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
 The man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
   

 UP TO ME
                                       
 Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
 Death kept followin', trackin' us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
 Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy,
 I know you're long gone,
 I guess it must be up to me.

 If I'd thought about it I never would've done it, I guess I would've let it
     slide,
 If I'd lived my life by what others were thinkin', the heart inside me
     would've died.
 I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity,
 Someone had to reach for the risin' star,
 I guess it was up to me.

 Oh, the Union Central is pullin' out and the orchids are in bloom,
 I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
 In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously,
 Somebody's got to find your trail,
 I guess it must be up to me.

 It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
 I'd just about convinced myself that nothin' had changed that much.
 The old Rounder in the iron mask slipped me the master key,
 Somebody had to unlock your heart,
 He said it was up to me.

 Well, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
 I would've followed you in the door but I didn't have a ticket stub.
 So I waited all night 'til the break of day, hopin' one of us could get
     free,
 When the dawn came over the river bridge,
 I knew it was up to me.

 Oh, the only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
 Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to
     work.
 Was I a fool or not to try to protect your identity?
 You looked a little burned out, my friend,
 I thought it might be up to me.

 Well, I met somebody face to face and I had to remove my hat,
 She's everything I need and love but I can't be swayed by that.
 It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
 But she ain't a-gonna make me move,
 I guess it must be up to me.

 We heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
 It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
 When you bite off more than you can chew you pay the penalty,
 Somebody's got to tell the tale,
 I guess it must be up to me.

 Well, Dupree came in pimpin' tonight to the Thunderbird Cafe,
 Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
 Well, I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company,
 But you ain't a-gonna cross the line,
 I guess it must be up to me.

 There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle,
 She's the one you been wond'rin' about, but there's really nothin' much to
     tell.
 We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is history,
 Somebody's got to cry some tears,
 I guess it must be up to me.
 
 So go on, boys, and play your hands, life is a pantomime,
 The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time.
 And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property,
 One of us has got to hit the road,
 I guess it must be up to me.

 And if we never meet again, baby, remember me,
 How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody.
 And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you, free,
 No one else could play that tune,
 You know it was up to me.
   

 VISIONS OF JOHANNA
                                       
 Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're tryin' to be so
     quiet?
 We sit here stranded, though we're all doin' our best to deny it
 And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin' you to defy it
 Lights flicker from the opposite loft
 In this room the heat pipes just cough
 The country music station plays soft
 But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
 Just Louise and her lover so entwined
 And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind

 In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key chain
 And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the "D" train
 We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
 Ask himself if it's him or them that's really insane
 Louise, she's all right, she's just near
 She's delicate and seems like the mirror
 But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
 That Johanna's not here
 The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
 Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place
 
 Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
 He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
 And when bringing her name up
 He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
 He's sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all
 Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall
 How can I explain?
 Oh, it's so hard to get on
 And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn
 
 Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial
 Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
 But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
 You can tell by the way she smiles
 See the primitive wallflower freeze
 When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
 Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeeze
 I can't find my knees"
 Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
 But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel
 
 The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him
 Sayin', "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a
     prayer for him"
 But like Louise always says
 "Ya can't look at much, can ya man?"
 As she, herself, prepares for him
 And Madonna, she still has not showed
 We see this empty cage now corrode
 Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
 The fiddler, he now steps to the road
 He writes ev'rything's been returned which was owed
 On the back of the fish truck that loads
 While my conscience explodes
 The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
 And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain
   

 WALKIN' DOWN THE LINE
                                       
 Well, I'm walkin' down the line,
 I'm walkin' down the line
 An' I'm walkin' down the line.
 My feet'll be a-flyin'
 To tell about my troubled mind.

 I got a heavy-headed gal
 I got a heavy-headed gal
 I got a heavy-headed gal
 She ain't feelin' well
 When she's better only time will tell
 
 Well, I'm walkin' down the line,
 I'm walkin' down the line
 An' I'm walkin' down the line.
 My feet'll be a-flyin'
 To tell about my troubled mind.
 
 My money comes and goes
 My money comes and goes
 My money comes and goes
 And rolls and flows and rolls and flows
 Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes
 
 Well, I'm walkin' down the line,
 I'm walkin' down the line
 An' I'm walkin' down the line.
 My feet'll be a-flyin'
 To tell about my troubled mind.

 I see the morning light
 I see the morning light
 Well it's not because
 I'm an early riser
 I didn't go to sleep last night

 Well, I'm walkin' down the line,
 I'm walkin' down the line
 An' I'm walkin' down the line.
 My feet'll be a-flyin'
 To tell about my troubled mind.

 I got my walkin' shoes
 I got my walkin' shoes
 I got my walkin' shoes
 An' I ain't a-gonna lose
 I believe I got the walkin' blues

 Well, I'm walkin' down the line,
 I'm walkin' down the line
 An' I'm walkin' down the line.
 My feet'll be a-flyin'
 To tell about my troubled mind.
   

 WALK OUT IN THE RAIN
                                       
 Walk out if it doesn't feel right,
 I can tell you're only lying.
 If you got something better tonight,
 Don't mess up my mind with your crying.

 Walk out in the rain,
 Walk out with your dreams,
 Walk out of my life
 If it doesn't feel right
 And catch the next train.
 Oh, darling, walk out in the rain.

 I have come from so far away
 Just to put a ring on your finger.
 You've said all that you've got to say,
 So please don't feel the need to linger.
 
 Walk out in the rain,
 Walk out with your dreams,
 Walk out of my life
 If it doesn't feel right
 And catch the next train.
 Oh, darling, walk out in the rain.
 
 It's rainin' inside of the city,
 My poor feet have walked 'til they're sore.
 If you don't want my love, it's a pity,
 I guess I can't see you no more.
 
 Walk out in the rain,
 Walk out with your dreams,
 Walk out of my life
 If it doesn't feel right
 And catch the next train.
 Oh, darling, walk out in the rain.
   

 WALLFLOWER
                                       
 Wallflower, wallflower
 Won't you dance with me?
 I'm sad and lonely too.
 Wallflower, wallflower
 Won't you dance with me?
 I'm fallin' in love with you.
 
 Just like you I'm wondrin' what I'm doin' here.
 Just like you I'm wondrin' what's goin' on.
 
 Wallflower, wallflower
 Won't you dance with me?
 The night will soon be gone.
 
 I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
 And I know that you're gonna be mine one of these days,
 Mine alone.
 
 Wallflower, wallflower
 Take a chance on me.
 Please let me ride you home.
   

 WALLS OF RED WING
   
 Oh, the age of the inmates
 I remember quite freely:
 No younger than twelve,
 No older 'n seventeen.
 Thrown in like bandits
 And cast off like criminals,
 Inside the walls,
 The walls of Red Wing.
 
 From the dirty old mess hall
 You march to the brick wall,
 Too weary to talk
 And too tired to sing.
 Oh, it's all afternoon
 You remember your home town,
 Inside the walls,
 The walls of Red Wing.
 
 Oh, the gates are cast iron
 And the walls are barbed wire.
 Stay far from the fence
 With the 'lectricity sting.
 And it's keep down your head
 And stay in your number,
 Inside the walls,
 The walls of Red Wing.
 
 Oh, it's fare thee well
 To the deep hollow dungeon,
 Farewell to the boardwalk
 That takes you to the screen.
 And farewell to the minutes
 They threaten you with it,
 Inside the walls,
 The walls of Red Wing.
 
 It's many a guard
 That stands around smilin',
 Holdin' his club
 Like he was a king.
 Hopin' to get you
 Behind a wood pilin',
 Inside the walls,
 The walls of Red Wing.
 
 The night aimed shadows
 Through the crossbar windows,
 And the wind punched hard
 To make the wall-siding sing.
 It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleepin',
 Inside the walls,
 The walls of Red Wing.
 
 As the rain rattled heavy
 On the bunk-house shingles,
 And the sounds in the night,
 They made my ears ring.
 'Til the keys of the guards
 Clicked the tune of the morning,
 Inside the walls,
 The walls of Red Wing.

 Oh, some of us'll end up
 In St. Cloud Prison,
 And some of us'll wind up
 To be lawyers and things,
 And some of us'll stand up
 To meet you on your crossroads,
 From inside the walls,
 The walls of Red Wing.
   

 THE WANDERING KIND
                                       
 She's like sweet water that runs down my face,
 I keep her posted in diamonds and lace.
 I give her freedom and what else I can find,
 But I know she's restless in her mind
 And the wandering kind.

 Way down in Texas  many years ago,
 She traveled with me to ease my heavy load.
 Some big shot saw her Ôcause she looked so fine,
 How was he to know she was restless in her mind
 And the wandering kind.

 A strange bedfellow wandered in her room
 She was more unfaithful than I ever could assume
 She took his money and slayed him from behind
 ÔCause she knew she was restless in her mind
 She's the wander kind.

 Down at the border with new plans of my own
 Don't need no woman I'll go it alone
 I miss my baby and I can't keep from cryin'
 ÔCause I know she's restless in her mind
 And the wandering kind.

 I should have known better than to get mixed up with her
 I guess I'll never know for sure
 For better or worse the situation now is reversed
 And I'm broke Ôcause she is no longer first in my heart.
 
 I wrote this letter before leaving the hotel
 To where she's staying in that dark adobe cell
 I tried to help her but she knows I'm not blind
 And because I'm not restless in my mind
 I'm the wandering kind.
   

 WANTED MAN
                                       
 Wanted man in California, wanted man in Buffalo,
 Wanted man in Kansas City, wanted man in Ohio,
 Wanted man in Mississippi, wanted man in old Cheyenne,
 Wherever you might look tonight, you might see this wanted man.

 I might be in Colorado or Georgia by the sea,
 Working for some man who may not know at all who I might be.
 If you ever see me comin' and if you know who I am,
 Don't you breathe it to nobody 'cause you know I'm on the lam.

 Wanted man by Lucy Watson, wanted man by Jeannie Brown,
 Wanted man by Nellie Johnson, wanted man in this next town.
 But I've had all that I've wanted of a lot of things I had
 And a lot more than I needed of some things that turned out bad.

 I got sidetracked in El Paso, stopped to get myself a map
 Went the wrong way into Juarez with Juanita on my lap.
 Then I went to sleep in Shreveport, woke up in Abilene
 Wonderin' why the hell I'm wanted at some town halfway between.

 Wanted man in Albuquerque, wanted man in Syracuse,
 Wanted man in Tallahassee, wanted man in Baton Rouge,
 There's somebody set to grab me anywhere that I might be
 And wherever you might look tonight, you might get a glimpse of me.

 Wanted man in California, wanted man in Buffalo,
 Wanted man in Kansas City, wanted man in Ohio,
 Wanted man in Mississippi, wanted man in old Cheyenne,
 Wherever you might look tonight, you might see this wanted man.
   

 WATCHING THE RIVER FLOW
                                       
 What's the matter with me,
 I don't have much to say,
 Daylight sneakin' through the window
 And I'm still in this all-night caf.
 Walkin' to and fro beneath the moon
 Out to where the trucks are rollin' slow,
 To sit down on this bank of sand
 And watch the river flow.

 Wish I was back in the city
 Instead of this old bank of sand,
 With the sun beating down over the chimney tops
 And the one I love so close at hand.
 If I had wings and I could fly,
 I know where I would go.
 But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly
 And watch the river flow.

 People disagreeing on all just about everything, yeah,
 Makes you stop and all wonder why.
 Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
 Who just couldn't help but cry.
 Oh, this ol' river keeps on rollin', though,
 No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow,
 And as long as it does I'll just sit here
 And watch the river flow.

 People disagreeing everywhere you look,
 Makes you wanna stop and read a book.
 Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
 That was really shook.
 But this ol' river keeps on rollin', though,
 No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow,
 And as long as it does I'll just sit here
 And watch the river flow.

 Watch the river flow,
 Watchin' the river flow,
 Watchin' the river flow,
 But I'll sit down on this bank of sand
 And watch the river flow.
   

 WATERED-DOWN LOVE
                                       
 Love that's pure hopes all things,
 Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
 Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark and handsome,
 Capture your heart and hold it for ransom.

 You don't want a love that's pure
 You wanna drown love
 You want a watered-down love
 
 Love that's pure, it don't make no claims,
 Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
 Will not deceive you or lead you to transgression,
 Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
 
 You don't want a love that's pure
 You wanna drown love
 You want a watered-down love
 
 Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
 Won't hold you back, won't mess up your day,
 Won't pervert you, corrupt you with stupid wishes,
 It don't make you envious, it don't make you suspicious.

 You don't want a love that's pure
 You wanna drown love
 You want a watered-down love
 
 Love that's pure ain't no accident,
 Always on time, is always content,
 An eternal flame, quietly burning,
 Never needs to be proud, restlessly yearning.

 You don't want a love that's pure
 You wanna drown love
 You want a watered-down love
   

 WE BETTER TALK THIS OVER
                                       
 I think we better talk this over
 Maybe when we both get sober
 You'll understand I'm only a man
 Doin' the best that I can.
 
 This situation can only get rougher.
 Why should we needlessly suffer?
 Let's call it a day, go our own different ways
 Before we decay.

 You don't have to be afraid of looking into my face,
 We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
 
 I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling
 You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
 I took a chance, got caught in the trance
 Of a downhill dance.
 
 Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
 I'm exiled, you can't convert me.
 I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways
 With both eyes glazed.
 
 You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
 Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
 
 I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
 If I have to beg, steal or borrow.
 It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half
 Look at each other and laugh.
 
 But I don't think it's liable to happen
 Like the sound of one hand clappin'.
 The vows that we kept are now broken and swept
 'Neath the bed where we slept.
 
 Don't think of me and fantasize on what we never had,
 Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
 
 Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
 Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
 
 Oh, babe, time for a new transition
 I wish I was a magician.
 I would wave a wand and tie back the bond
 That we've both gone beyond.
   

 WEDDING SONG
                                       
 I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
 I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
 Love you more than madness, more than waves upon the sea,
 Love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.

 Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
 I've said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
 To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun,
 I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.

 You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
 When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give,
 Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole,
 Quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul.

 You gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life,
 Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
 My thoughts of you don't ever rest, they'd kill me if I lie,
 I'd sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die.

 The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
 We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth,
 What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
 But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.

 It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
 Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge,
 'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend,
 And if there is eternity I'd love you there again.

 Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
 And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride,
 You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece
 And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.

 You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
 Just bein' next to you is a natural thing for me
 And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
 'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
   

 WENT TO SEE THE GYPSY
                                       
 Went to see the gypsy,
 Stayin' in a big hotel.
 He smiled when he saw me coming,
 And he said, "Well, well, well."
 His room was dark and crowded,
 Lights were low and dim.
 "How are you?" he said to me,
 I said it back to him.
 
 I went down to the lobby
 To make a small call out.
 A pretty dancing girl was there,
 And she began to shout,
 "Go on back to see the gypsy.
 He can move you from the rear,
 Drive you from your fear,
 Bring you through the mirror.
 He did it in Las Vegas,
 And he can do it here."
 
 Outside the lights were shining
 On the river of tears,
 I watched them from the distance
 With music in my ears.
 
 I went back to see the gypsy,
 It was nearly early dawn.
 The gypsy's door was open wide
 But the gypsy was gone,
 And that pretty dancing girl,
 She could not be found.
 So I watched that sun come rising
 From that little Minnesota town.
   

 WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?
                                       
 You have given everything to me.
 What can I do for You?
 You have given me eyes to see.
 What can I do for You?

 Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
 Filled up a hunger that had always been denied,
 Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide
 And You've chosen me to be among the few.
 What can I do for You?

 You have laid down Your life for me.
 What can I do for You?
 You have explained every mystery.
 What can I do for You?

 Soon as a man is born, you know the sparks begin to fly,
 He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
 Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
 Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do.
 What can I do for You?

 You have given all there is to give.
 What can I do for You?
 You have given me life to live.
 How can I live for You?

 I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
 I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
 Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart.
 Well, I don't deserve it but I sure did make it through.
 What can I do for You?
   

 WHATCHA GONNA DO?
                                       
 Tell me what you're gonna do
 When the shadow comes under your door.
 Tell me what you're gonna do
 When the shadow comes under your door.
 Tell me what you're gonna do
 When the shadow comes under your door.
 O Lord, O Lord,
 What shall you do?

 Tell me what you're gonna do
 When the devil calls your cards.
 Tell me what you're gonna do
 When the devil calls your cards.
 Tell me what you're gonna do
 When the devil calls your cards.
 O Lord, O Lord,
 What shall you do?

 Tell me what you're gonna do
 When your water turns to wine.
 Tell me what you're gonna do
 When your water turns to wine.
 Tell me what you're gonna do
 When your water turns to wine.
 O Lord, O Lord,
 What should you do?

 Tell me what you're gonna do
 When you can't play God no more.
 Tell me what you're gonna do
 When you can't play God no more.
 Tell me what you're gonna do
 When you can't play God no more.
 O Lord, O Lord,
 What shall you do?

 Tell me what you're gonna do
 When the shadow comes creepin' in your room.
 Tell me what you're gonna do
 When the shadow comes creepin' in your room.
 Tell me what you're gonna do
 When the shadow comes creepin' in your room.
 O Lord, O Lord,
 What should you do?
   

 WHAT GOOD AM I?
                                       
 What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
 If I just turn away, when I see how you're dressed,
 If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
 What good am I?
 
 What good am I if I know and don't do,
 I If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
 If I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin' sky,
 What good am I?

 What good am I while you softly weep
 And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep,
 And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
 What good am I?

 What good am I then to others and me
 If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see
 If my hands are tied must I not wonder within
 Who tied them and why and where must I have been

 What good am I if I say foolish things
 And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
 And I just turn my back while you silently die,
 What good am I?
   

 WHAT WAS IT YOU WANTED?
                                       
 What was it you wanted?
 Tell me again so I'll know.
 What's happening in there,
 What's going on in your show.
 What was it you wanted,
 Could you say it again?
 I'll be back in a minute
 You can get it together by then.

 What was it you wanted
 You can tell me, I'm back,
 We can start it all over
 Get it back on the track,
 You got my attention,
 Go ahead, speak.
 What was it you wanted
 When you were kissing my cheek?

 Was there somebody looking
 When you give me that kiss
 Someone there in the shadows
 Someone that I might have missed?
 Is there something you needed,
 Something I don't understand.
 What was it you wanted,
 Do I have it here in my hand?
 
 Whatever you wanted
 Slipped out of my mind,
 Would you remind me again
 If you'd be so kind.
 Has the record been breaking,
 Did the needle just skip,
 Is there somebody waitin',
 Was there a slip of the lip?

 What was it you wanted
 I ain't keepin' score
 Are you the same person
 That was here before?
 Is it something important?
 Maybe not.
 What was it you wanted?
 Tell me again I forgot.

 Whatever you wanted
 What could it be
 Did somebody tell you
 That you could get it from me,
 Is it something that comes natural
 Is it easy to say,
 Why do you want it,
 Who are you anyway?

 Is the scenery changing,
 Am I getting it wrong,
 Is the whole thing going backwards,
 Are they playing our song?
 Where were you when it started
 Do you want it for free
 What was it you wanted
 Are you talking to me?
   

 WHEN HE RETURNS
                                       
 The iron hand it ain't no match for the iron rod,
 The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty God.
 For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears
 It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
 Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn
 For like a thief in the night, He'll replace wrong with right
 When He returns.

 Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
 He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
 How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
 How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
 Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
 Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease
 Until He returns?

 Surrender your crown on this blood-stained ground, take off your mask,
 He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
 How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
 How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
 Of every earthly plan that be known to man, He is unconcerned,
 He's got plans of His own to set up His throne
 When He returns.

 
 WHEN I PAINT MY MASTERPIECE
                                       
 Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
 Ancient footprints are everywhere.
 You can almost think that you're seein' double
 On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
 Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
 Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece.
 She promised that she'd be right there with me
 When I paint my masterpiece.
 
 Oh, the hours I've spent inside the Coliseum,
 Dodging lions and wastin' time.
 Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em,
 Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
 Train wheels runnin' through the back of my memory,
 When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese.
 Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
 When I paint my masterpiece.
 
 Sailin' 'round the world in a dirty gondola.
 Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola!
 
 I left Rome and landed in Brussels,
 On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried.
 Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin' muscles,
 Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside.
 Newspapermen eating candy
 Had to be held down by big police.
 Someday, everything is gonna be diff'rent
 When I paint my masterpiece.
    

 WHEN THE NIGHT COMES FALLING FROM THE SKY
                                       
 Look out across the fields, see me returning,
 Smoke is in your eye, you draw a smile.
 From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
 You've had time to think about it for a while.
 
 Well, I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
 It's the end of the chase and the moon is high.
 It won't matter who loves who,
 You'll love me or I'll love you
 When the night comes falling from the sky.

 I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
 Sorrow covers you up like a cape.
 Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
 With disaster that you managed to escape.

 I can't provide for you no easy answers,
 Who are you that I should have to lie?
 You'll know all about it, love,
 It'll fit you like a glove
 When the night comes falling from the sky.

 I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
 You must have been protecting someone last time I called.
 I've never asked you for nothing you couldn't deliver,
 I've never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.

 I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
 For the love of a lousy buck, I've watched them die.
 Stick around, baby, we're not through,
 Don't look for me, I'll see you
 When the night comes falling from the sky.

 In your teardrops, I can see my own reflection,
 It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line.
 I don't want to be a fool starving for affection,
 I don't want to drown in someone else's wine.
  
 For all eternity I think I will remember
 That icy wind that's howling in your eye.
 You will seek me and you'll find me In the wasteland of your mind
 When the night comes falling from the sky.

 Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter
 But you were gambling for support.
 This time tomorrow I'll know you better
 When my memory is not so short.
 
 This time I'm asking for freedom,
 Freedom from a world which you deny.
 And you'll give it to me now,
 I'll take it anyhow
 When the night comes falling from the sky.
   

 WHEN THE SHIP COMES IN
                                       
 Oh the time will come up
 When the winds will stop
 And the breeze will cease to be breathin'.
 Like the stillness in the wind
 'Fore the hurricane begins,
 The hour when the ship comes in.

 Oh the seas will split
 And the ship will hit
 And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking.
 Then the tide will sound
 And the wind will pound
 And the morning will be breaking.
 
 Oh the fishes will laugh
 As they swim out of the path
 And the seagulls they'll be smiling.
 And the rocks on the sand
 Will proudly stand,
 The hour that the ship comes in.
 
 And the words that are used
 For to get the ship confused
 Will not be understood as they're spoken.
 For the chains of the sea
 Will have busted in the night
 And will be buried at the bottom of the ocean.

 A song will lift
 As the mainsail shifts
 And the boat drifts on to the shoreline.
 And the sun will respect
 Every face on the deck,
 The hour that the ship comes in.

 Then the sands will roll
 Out a carpet of gold
 For your weary toes to be a-touchin'.
 And the ship's wise men
 Will remind you once again
 That the whole wide world is watchin'.

 Oh the foes will rise
 With the sleep still in their eyes
 And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'.
 But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
 And know that it's for real,
 The hour when the ship comes in.

 Then they'll raise their hands,
 Sayin' we'll meet all your demands,
 But we'll shout from the bow your days are numbered.
 And like Pharaoh's tribe,
 They'll be drownded in the tide,
 And like Goliath, they'll be conquered.
   

 WHEN YOU GONNA WAKE UP?
                                       
 God don't make no promises that He don't keep.
 You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be
     asleep.

 When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
 When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
 
 Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts.
 Karl Marx has got ya by the throat, Henry Kissinger's got you tied up in
     knots.
 
 When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
 When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
 
 You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
 You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never cure your ills.
 
 When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
 When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
 
 You got men who can't hold their peace and women who can't control their
     tongues.
 The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
 
 When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
 When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
 
 Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
 You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
 
 When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
 When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
 
 Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
 Instant inner peace and every step you take has got to be approved.
 
 When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
 When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

 Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
 You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires.

 When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
 When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

 You can't take it with you and you know that it's too worthless to be sold,
 They tell you, "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.

 When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
 When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

 There's a Man up on a cross and He's been crucified.
 Do you have any idea why or for who He died?

 When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
 When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
   

 WHERE ARE YOU TONIGHT?
 (Journey Through Dark Heat)
                                       
 There's a long-distance train rolling through the rain, tears on the letter
     I write.
 There's a woman I long to touch and I miss her so much but she's drifting
     like a satellite.
 There's a neon light ablaze in this green smoky haze, laughter down on
     Elizabeth Street.
 And a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone where she bathed in a
     stream of pure heat.
 Her father would emphasize you got to be more than street-wise but he
     practiced what he preached from the heart.
 A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted to me the time and the place that the
     trouble would start.

 There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
 And a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage
 And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page
 Of a book that no one can write.
 Oh, where are you tonight?
 
 The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure, to live it you have to
     explode.
 In that last hour of need, we entirely agreed, sacrifice was the code of
     the road.
 I left town at dawn, with Marcel and St. John, strong men belittled by
     doubt.
 I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were but she had some way of
     finding them out.
 He took dead-center aim but he missed just the same, she was waiting,
     putting flowers on the shelf.
 She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair and discovered her
     invisible self.

 There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
 There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped,
 As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape,
 I won't, but then again, maybe I might.
 Oh, if I could just find you tonight.

 I fought with my twin, that enemy within, 'til both of us fell by the way.
 Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees while the law looks the other
     way.
 Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes, the guy you were
     lovin' couldn't stay clean.
 It felt outa place, my foot in his face, but he should-a stayed where his
     money was green.
 I bit into the root of forbidden fruit with the juice running down my leg.
 Then I dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss and who always was
     too proud to beg.
 There's a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room and a pathway
     that leads up to the stars.
 If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise, remind me to
     show you the scars.

 There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived.
 If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived.
 I can't believe it, I can't believe I'm alive,
 But without you it just doesn't seem right.
 Oh, where are you tonight?
   

 WHERE TEARDROPS FALL
                                       
 Far Away where the soft winds blow,
 Far away from it all,
 There is a place you go
 Where teardrops fall.

 Far away in the stormy night,
 Far away and over the wall,
 You are there in the flickering light
 Where teardrops fall.

 We banged the drum slowly
 And played the fife lowly,
 You know the song in my heart.
 In the turning of twilight,
 In the shadows of moonlight,
 You can show me a new place to start.

 I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
 Strippin' away at it all,
 Thinking of you when the sun comes up
 Where teardrops fall.

 By rivers of blindness,
 In love and with kindness
 We could hold up a toast if we meet.
 To the cuttin' of fences,
 To sharpen the senses
 That linger in the fireball heat.

 Roses are red, violets are blue,
 And time is beginning to crawl,
 I just might have to come see you
 Where teardrops fall.
   

 WHO KILLED DAVEY MOORE?
                                       
 Who killed Davey Moore,
 Why an' what's the reason for?

 "Not I," says the referee,
 "Don't point your finger at me.
 I could've stopped it in the eighth
 An' maybe kept him from his fate,
 But the crowd would've booed, I'm sure,
 At not gettin' their money's worth.
 It's too bad he had to go,
 But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
 It wasn't me that made him fall.
 No, you can't blame me at all."

 Who killed Davey Moore,
 Why an' what's the reason for?
 
 "Not us," says the angry crowd,
 Whose screams filled the arena loud.
 "It's too bad he died that night
 But we just like to see a fight.
 We didn't mean for him t' meet his death,
 We just meant to see some sweat,
 There ain't nothing wrong in that.
 It wasn't us that made him fall.
 No, you can't blame us at all."

 Who killed Davey Moore,
 Why an' what's the reason for?
 
 "Not me," says his manager,
 Puffing on a big cigar.
 "It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
 I always thought that he was well.
 It's too bad for his wife an' kids he's dead,
 But if he was sick, he should've said.
 It wasn't me that made him fall.
 No, you can't blame me at all."
 
 Who killed Davey Moore,
 Why an' what's the reason for?
 
 "Not me," says the gambling man,
 With his ticket stub still in his hand.
 "It wasn't me that knocked him down,
 My hands never touched him none.
 I didn't commit no ugly sin,
 Anyway, I put money on him to win.
 It wasn't me that made him fall.
 No, you can't blame me at all."
 
 Who killed Davey Moore,
 Why an' what's the reason for?
 
 "Not me," says the boxing writer,
 Pounding print on his old typewriter,
 Sayin', "Boxing ain't to blame,
 There's just as much danger in a football game."
 Sayin', "Fist fighting is here to stay,
 It's just the old American way.
 It wasn't me that made him fall.
 No, you can't blame me at all."
 
 Who killed Davey Moore,
 Why an' what's the reason for?
 
 "Not me," says the man whose fists
 Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
 Who came here from Cuba's door
 Where boxing ain't allowed no more.
 "I hit him, yes, it's true,
 But that's what I am paid to do.
 Don't say 'murder,' don't say 'kill.'
 It was destiny, it was God's will."

 Who killed Davey Moore,
 Why an' what's the reason for?
   

 THE WICKED MESSENGER
                                       
 There was a wicked messenger
 From Eli he did come,
 With a mind that multiplied
 The smallest matter.
 When questioned who had sent for him,
 He answered with his thumb,
 For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter.
 
 He stayed behind the assembly hall,
 It was there he made his bed,
 Oftentimes he could be seen returning.
 Until one day he just appeared
 With a note in his hand which read,
 "The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
 
 Oh, the leaves began to fallin'
 And the seas began to part,
 And the people that confronted him were many.
 And he was told but these few words,
 Which opened up his heart,
 "If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
   

 WIGGLE WIGGLE
                                       
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 'til the moon is blue,
 Wiggle 'til the moon sees you.

 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, like a swarm of bees,
 Wiggle on your hands and knees.

 Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
 Wiggle 'til you wiggle right out of here,
 Wiggle 'til it opens, wiggle 'til it shuts,
 Wiggle 'til it bites, wiggle 'til it cuts.

 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
 Wiggle - you can raise the dead.

 Wiggle 'til you're high, wiggle 'til you're higher,
 Wiggle 'til you vomit fire,
 Wiggle 'til it whispers, wiggle 'til it hums,
 Wiggle 'til it answers, wiggle 'til it comes.

 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
 Wiggle like a big fat snake.
   

 WINTERLUDE
                                       
 Winterlude, Winterlude, oh darlin',
 Winterlude by the road tonight.
 Tonight there will be no quarrelin',
 Ev'rything is gonna be all right.
 Oh, I see by the angel beside me
 That love has a reason to shine.
 You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more,
 Then Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.

 Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
 Winterlude by the corn in the field,
 Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
 Then come back and cook up a meal.
 Well, come out when the skating rink glistens
 By the sun, near the old crossroads sign.
 The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold,
 Winterlude, don't be rude, please be mine.

 Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
 Winterlude by the telephone wire,
 Winterlude, it's makin' me lazy,
 Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
 The moonlight reflects from the window
 Where the snowflakes, they cover the sand.
 Come out tonight, ev'rything will be tight,
 Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
   

 WITH GOD ON OUR SIDE
                                       
 Oh my name it is nothin'
 My age it means less
 The country I come from
 Is called the Midwest
 I's taught and brought up there
 The laws to abide
 And that land that I live in
 Has God on its side.
 
 Oh the history books tell it
 They tell it so well
 The cavalries charged
 The Indians fell
 The cavalries charged
 The Indians died
 Oh the country was young
 With God on its side.
 
 Oh the Spanish-American
 War had its day
 And the Civil War too
 Was soon laid away
 And the names of the heroes
 I's made to memorize
 With guns in their hands
 And God on their side.
 
 Oh the First World War, boys
 It closed out its fate
 The reason for fighting
 I never got straight
 But I learned to accept it
 Accept it with pride
 For you don't count the dead
 When God's on your side.
 
 When the Second World War
 Came to an end
 We forgave the Germans
 And we were friends
 Though they murdered six million
 In the ovens they fried
 The Germans now too
 Have God on their side.
 
 I've learned to hate Russians
 All through my whole life
 If another war starts
 It's them we must fight
 To hate them and fear them
 To run and to hide
 And accept it all bravely
 With God on my side.
 
 But now we got weapons
 Of the chemical dust
 If fire them we're forced to
 Then fire them we must
 One push of the button
 And a shot the world wide
 And you never ask questions
 When God's on your side.
 
 In a many dark hour
 I've been thinkin' about this
 That Jesus Christ
 Was betrayed by a kiss
 But I can't think for you
 You'll have to decide
 Whether Judas Iscariot
 Had God on his side.
 
 So now as I'm leavin'
 I'm weary as Hell
 The confusion I'm feelin'
 Ain't no tongue can tell
 The words fill my head
 And fall to the floor
 If God's on our side
 He'll stop the next war.
   

 WORLD GONE WRONG
                                       
 Strange things have happened, like never before.
 My baby told me I would have to go.
 I can't be good no more, once like I did before.
 I can't be good, baby,
 Honey, because the world's gone wrong.

 Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home.
 No use in worrying, 'cause the world gone wrong.
 I can't be good no more, once like I did before.
 I can't be good, baby,
 Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
 
 I told you, baby, right to your head,
 If I didn't leave you I would have to kill you dead.
 I can't be good no more, once like I did before.
 I can't be good, baby,
 Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
 
 I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
 But it seems like you never right, you got no loyal mind.
 I can't be good no more, once like I did before.
 I can't be good, baby,
 Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
 
 If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
 Praise the Good Lord to get her out of your mind.
 I can't be good no more, once like I did before.
 I can't be good, baby,
 Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
 
 Said, when you been good now, can't do no more,
 Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
 I can't be good no more, once like I did before.
 I can't be good, baby,
 Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
 
 Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
 No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
 I can't be good no more, once like I did before.
 I can't be good, baby,
 Honey, because the world's gone wrong.

 YE SHALL BE CHANGED
                                       
 You harbor resentment
 You know there ain't too much of a thrill
 You wish for contentment
 But you got an emptiness that can't be filled
 You've had enough hatred
 Your bones are breaking (and you) can't find nothing sacred, (but)
 
 Ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed
 In a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows
 The dead will arise and burst out of your cloths
 And ye shall be changed
 
 Everything you've gotten
 You've gotten by sweat, blood and muscle
 From early in the morning Ôtil way past dark
 All you ever do is hustle
 All your loved ones have walked out the door
 You're not even sure Ôbout your wife and kids no more, but
 
 Ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed
 In a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows
 The dead will arise and burst out of your cloths
 And ye shall be changed
 
 (Now) the past don't control you
 But the future's like a roulette wheel spinning
 (And) deep down inside
 You know you need a whole new beginning
 Don't have to  go to Russia or Iran
 Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand, and
 
 Ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed
 In a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows
 The dead will arise and burst out of your cloths
 And ye shall be changed
 
 You drink bitter water
 And you been eating the bread of sorrow
 You can't live for today
 When all you're ever thinking of is tomorrow
 The path you've endured has been rough
 And when you've decided that you've had enough, then
 
 Ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed
 In a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows
 The dead will arise and burst out of your cloths
 And ye shall be changed
   

 YOU'RE GONNA QUIT ME
                                       
 You're gonna quit me, baby,
 Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd.
 Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd.
 Good as I been to you.

 Give you my money, honey,
 Buy you shoes and clothes, Lawd, Lawd.
 
 You're gonna quit me, baby,
 Put me outta doors, Lawd, Lawd.
 
 Six months on the chain gang,
 Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lawd, Lawd.
 
 Day you quit me, baby,
 That's the day you die, Lawd, Lawd.
 
 Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
 Believe me, ain't no lie, Lawd, Lawd.
 
 Day you quit me, baby,
 That's the day you die, Lawd, Lawd.


 YOU AIN'T GOIN' NOWHERE
                                       
 Clouds so swift
 Rain won't lift
 Gate won't close
 Railings froze
 Get your mind off wintertime
 You ain't goin' nowhere
 Whoo-ee! Ride me high
 Tomorrow's the day
 My bride's gonna come
 Oh, oh, are we gonna fly
 Down in the easy chair!

 I don't care
 How many letters they sent
 Morning came and morning went
 Pick up your money
 And pack up your tent
 You ain't goin' nowhere
 Whoo-ee! Ride me high
 Tomorrow's the day
 My bride's gonna come
 Oh, oh, are we gonna fly
 Down in the easy chair!

 Buy me a flute
 And a gun that shoots
 Tailgates and substitutes
 Strap yourself
 To the tree with roots
 You ain't goin' nowhere
 Whoo-ee! Ride me high
 Tomorrow's the day
 My bride's gonna come
 Oh, oh, are we gonna fly
 Down in the easy chair!
 
 Genghis Khan
 He could not keep
 All his kings
 Supplied with sleep
 We'll climb that hill no matter how steep
 When we get up to it
 Whoo-ee! Ride me high
 Tomorrow's the day
 My bride's gonna come
 Oh, oh, are we gonna fly
 Down in the easy chair!
 

 YOU ANGEL YOU
                                       
 You angel you
 You got me under your wing.
 The way you walk and the way you talk
 I feel I could almost sing.

 You angel you
 You're as fine as anything's fine.
 The way you walk and the way you talk
 It sure plays on my mind.

 You know I can't sleep at night for trying,
 Never did feel this way before.
 I get up at night and walk the floor.
 If this is love then gimme more
 And more and more and more and more.

 You angel you
 You're as fine as can be.
 The way you smile like a sweet baby child,
 It just falls all over me.
 
 You know I can't sleep at night for trying
 Never did feel this way before,
 Never did get up and walk the floor.
 If this is love then gimme more
 And more and more and more.
 
 You angel you
 You got me under your wing.
 The way you walk and the way you talk
 It says everything.
   

 YOU'RE A BIG GIRL NOW
                                       
 Our conversation was short and sweet
 It nearly swept me off-a my feet.
 And I'm back in the rain, oh, oh,
 And you are on dry land.
 You made it there somehow
 You're a big girl now.

 Bird on the horizon, sittin' on a fence,
 He's singin' his song for me at his own expense.
 And I'm just like that bird, oh, oh,
 Singin' just for you.
 I hope that you can hear,
 Hear me singin' through these tears.

 Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
 Oh, but what a shame if all we've shared can't last.
 I can change, I swear, oh, oh,
 See what you can do.
 I can make it through,
 You can make it too.

 Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
 You've known it all the time, I'm learnin' it these days.
 Oh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh,
 In somebody's room.
 It's a price I have to pay
 You're a big girl all the way.
 
 A change in the weather is known to be extreme
 But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
 I'm going out of my mind, oh, oh,
 With a pain that stops and starts
 Like a corkscrew to my heart
 Ever since we've been apart.
   

 YOU CHANGED MY LIFE
                                       
 You changed my life
 Came along in a time of strife
 In hunger and need
 You made my heart bleed
 You changed my life
 You changed my life
 
 Now the nature of man
 Is to beg and to steal
 I'd do it myself
 It's not so unreal
 The call of the wild's
 Forever at my door
 Want me to fly like an eagle
 Being chained to the floor, but

 You changed my life
 Came along in a time of strife
 In hunger and need
 You made my heart bleed
 You changed my life
 You changed my life
 
 Eating with the pigs
 Off a fancy tray
 I was bold, I was looking good
 And to have a nice day
 It all seemed so proper
 And so elite
 Eating absolute garbage
 While being so discreet.

 You changed my life
 Came along in a time of strife
 In hunger and need
 You made my heart bleed
 You changed my life
 You changed my life

 You were glowing in the light
 Being peaceably calm
 Well, how often does a man dance
 To the beat of the balm?
 Your eyes were on fire
 Your feet were of brass
 In a world that you made
 You were an outcast

 You changed my life
 Came along in a time of strife
 In hunger and need
 You made my heart bleed
 You changed my life
 You changed my life
 
 Truce makers and partakers
 Of every selfish whim
 Her running to meet me running to her
 And you running back to him
 Their destruction of my confidence
 Was like a sharpness of the tongue
 I said: Make my faith greater
 But I was a little high strung
 
 You changed my life
 Came along in a time of strife
 In hunger and need
 You made my heart bleed
 You changed my life
 You changed my life
   

 YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME LONESOME WHEN YOU GO
                                       
 I've seen love go by my door
 It's never been this close before
 Never been so easy or so slow.
 Been shooting in the dark too long
 When somethin's not right it's wrong
 Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.
 
 Dragon clouds so high above
 I've only known careless love,
 It's always hit me from below.
 This time around it's more correct
 Right on target, so direct,
 Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.
 
 Purple clover, Queen Anne lace,
 Crimson hair across your face,
 You could make me cry if you don't know.
 Can't remember what I was thinkin' of
 You might be spoilin' me too much, love,
 Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.
 
 Flowers on the hillside, bloomin' crazy,
 Crickets talkin' back and forth in rhyme,
 Blue river runnin' slow and lazy,
 I could stay with you forever
 And never realize the time.
 
 Situations have ended sad,
 Relationships have all been bad.
 Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud.
 But there's no way I can compare
 All those scenes to this affair,
 Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.
 
 Yer gonna make me wonder what I'm doin',
 Stayin' far behind without you.
 Yer gonna make me wonder what I'm sayin',
 Yer gonna make me give myself a good talkin' to.
 
 I'll look for you in old Honolulu,
 San Francisco, Ashtabula,
 Yer gonna have to leave me now, I know.
 But I'll see you in the sky above,
 In the tall grass, in the ones I love,
 Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.

 "World Full of Nothing"
 by Depeche Mode

 Close
 Naked
 Skin on skin
 Tears are falling
 Tears of joy
 Her first boy
 His first girl
 Makes a change

 In a world full of nothing
 Though it's not love
 It means something

 She's lonely
 And he says
 It's for her only
 That he lusts
 She doesn't trust him
 Nothing is true
 But he will do

 In a world full of nothing
 Though it's not love
 It means something

 It's easy to slip away
 And believe it all

 Though it's not love
 It means something


 "The Beautiful People"
 by Marilyn Manson

 I don't want you and I don't need you
 don't bother to resist, I'll beat you
 It's not your fault that you're always wrong
 the weak ones are there to justify the strong

 the beautiful people, the beautiful people
 it's all relative to the size of your steeple
 you can't see the forest for the trees
 you can't smell
 your own shit on your knees

 Hey you, what do you see?
 something beautiful, something free?
 hey you, are you trying to be mean?
 if you live with apes man, it's hard to be clean

 there's no time to discriminate,
 hate every motherfucker
 that's in your way
 the worms will live in every host
 it's hard to pick which one they eat most

 the horrible people, the horrible people
 it's as anatomic as the size of your steeple
 capitalism has made it this way,
 old-fashioned fascism
 will take it away
 (chorus)


 "It's a Small World"
 A classic song from Disney

  It's a world of laughter, a world of tears
  It's a world of hopes and a world of fears   
  There's so much that we share that its time we're aware
  It's a small world after all
  It's a small world after all
  It's a small world after all
  It's a small world after all
  It's a small, small world
  
  There is just one moon and one golden sun   
  And a smile means friendship for everyone
  Though the mountains divide and the oceans are wide   
  It's a small world after all   
  It's a small world after all   
  It's a small world after all   
  It's a small world after all
  It's a small, small world

 "Testosterone"
 by Bush

 I'm a man 
 I'm real proud of my manhood 
 I like to smoke 
 Ten thousands of cigarillos 
 Eight ball 
 I could climb any fountain 
 I never cry 
 I only bawl when I'm losing 
 And I've never been wrong 
 Never been wrong 
 I'm looking so good 
 Looking so good 

 Got a big gold gun 
 Got a big gold bullet 
 And I guess you could say 
 I'm real full of it 
 I'm real full of it 
 
 I'm real straight 
 You wanna see my peccadillos 
 Hot dog 7:30 every morning 
 And I'm big into war 
 Big into war 
 Big into war
 I am a whore 
 I am a whore 
 
 Got a big gold gun 
 
 I shave with Gillette 
 Shave with Gillette 
 And I'm patting my back 
 Patting my back 
 Got a big gold bullet 


 "Youth Gone Wild"
 by Skid Row

 Since I was born they couldn't hold me down
 Another misfit kid, another burned-out town

 Never played by the rules I never really cared
 My nasty reputation takes me everywhere

 I look and see it's not only me
 So many others have stood where I stand
 We are the young so raise your hands

 They call us problem child
 We spend our lives on trial
 We walk an endless mile
 We are the youth gone wild
 We stand and we won't fall
 We're the one and one for all
 The writing's on the wall
 We are the youth gone wild

 Boss screamin' in my ear about who I'm supposed to be
 Getcha a 3-piece Wall Street smile and son you'll look just like me

 I said "Hey man, there's something that you oughta know.
 I tell ya Park Avenue leads to Skid Row."

 I look and see it's not only me
 We're standin' tall ain't never a doubt
 We are the young, so shout it out

 They call us problem child
 We spend our lives on trial
 We walk an endless mile
 We are the youth gone wild
 We stand and we won't fall
 We're the one and one for all
 The writing's on the wall
 We are the youth gone wild

 They call us problem child
 We spend our lives on trial
 We walk an endless mile
 We are the youth gone wild
 We stand and we won't fall
 We're the one and one for all
 The writing's on the wall
 We are the youth gone wild
 We are the youth gone wild


 "Mary Jane"
 by Megadeth

 Forgive me father for I have sinned
 I'm a child of the air, I'm a witch of the wind
 And I'm still awake... Mary Jane

 From the earth, up through the trees
 I can hear her calling me
 Her voice rides on the breeze
 Oh, it's haunting me

 No, I can't get away
 No, there's no escape
 If I know I'm going crazy
 I must not be insane

 Chorus
 Beware my friends, as you pass by
 As you are now so once was I
 As I am now so you must be
 Prepare my friends to follow me

 Forgive me father for I have sinned
 I'm a child of the air, I'm a witch of the wind
 Fingers gripped around my brain
 No control, my mind is lame
 I'm in the astral plane, and I'll never be the same
 Never, never, never, never, never, never
 Never, never, never

 Repeat chorus

 It hurts so bad I can't breathe
 Prepare to follow me


 Album: Wither Blister Burn + Peel
 by Stabbing Westward


 "I DON'T BELIEVE"

 I'm such an asshole
 god I'm such a stain.
 I just keep fucking up
 again and again

 You crawled inside my mind when you crawled into my bed
 Said everything I've ever longed to hear
 So perfect so alive
 once inside you sucked me dry
 Used me up and left me here for dead
 I crave it desperately a cancer eating me
 An addiction to intense to be denied
 Worthless I'm a whore crawling back for more
 Pathetic how I feed off this abuse

 You told me that you love me
 I believed that you loved me
 You swore that you loved me
 And I believed now I know it was a lie

 I don't believe
 I could be so stupid so naive
 I don't believe
 That there is nothing
 nothing left for me


 "SHAME"

 I only see myself reflected in your eyes
 So all that I believe I am essentially are lies
 So everything I hoped to be or ever thought I was
 Died with your belief in me so who the hell am I
 I don't know if I am real without you
 What is left of me without you
 I don't know what's real without you
 How can I exist without you?
 I'm wandering round confused, wondering why I try
 The more that you deny my pain, the more it intesifies
 I pray for someone to ache for me the way I ache for you
 If you ignore that I'm alive I have nothing to cling to
 I don't know if I am real without you
 What is left of me without you
 I don't know what's real without you
 How can I exist without you?
 I stare into this mirror so tired of this life
 If only you would speak to me or care if I'm alive
 Once I swore I would die for you but I never meant like this
 I never meant like this, no I never meant like this.
 I don't know if I am real without you
 What is left of me without you?
 I don't know what's real without you
 How can I exist without you?
 How can I exist without you?
 How can I exist without you?


 "WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO"

 You make it hard to breath
 it's as if i'm suffocating
 And when you're next to me
 I can feel your heartbeat through my skin
 It makes me sad to think
 this could all be for nothing
 I wish there was a way
 a way for you to see inside me
 I've never felt this way
 About anyone or anything
 Tell me--

 What do I have to do
 to make you happy
 What do I have to do
 to make you understand
 What do I have to do
 to make you want me
 And if I can't make you want me
 what to I have to do?

 I know exactly what you're thinking
 But I swear this time I will not let you down
 I'm not as selfish as I used to be
 That was a part of me that never made me proud
 Right now I think I would try anything
 Anything at all to keep you satisfied
 God I hope you see what losing you will do to me
 All I want is one more chance so tell me

 What do I have to do
 to make you love me
 What do I have to do to forget about you?


 "WHY"

 I am not here
 I think I've never been here at all
 or ever will be
 I feel like a place
 where no one goes any more

 Why can't you see that everythings broken
 Why does it seem this lifes turned gray
 I can't believe in anything sacred
 when I don't believe I am real

 I need someone to break the silence
 Screaming in my head
 And in my soul

 It seems so bizarre
 but none of this matters
 Thoughts disappear, hope has died
 Now I am safe
 nothing can hurt me here

 Why can't you see my need for forgiveness
 The truth and the lies so confused as one
 I can't believe in anything sacred
 When I don't believe in anything

 I need someone to break the silence
 Screaming in my head
 And in my soul

 I am alone locked in my memories
 There's nowhere left for me to hide
 But I am not real
 I've made all I am with lies

 Why does it seem that everythings different
 Why does it seem that only you are real
 I don't believe in anything sacred
 So why do I feel so damn alone

 I need someone to break the silence
 Thats screaming in my head
 And in my soul


 "INSIDE YOU"

 I feel your lips
 I taste your skin
 I need to know
 I need to feel you from within
 As your blood burns through my skin
 I feel complete
 I breath you in
 Its where you end and I begin
 If only I could stay here forever
 So much to tell you
 So much to show you
 So much to confide
 Now that I'm inside you
 We are flesh
 We are one
 So why do I feel so much guilt for what I've done
 As your blood burns through my skin
 I feel release
 I breath you in
 It's where you end and I begin
 If only I could stay here forever
 So much to tell you
 So much to give you
 So much to confide
 now that I'm inside
 Inside you


 "FALLS APART"

 I'm tangled and broken
 Left scattered on the floor
 Its useless now
 these pieces
 they can never make me whole
 You wither
 You blister
 I watch you burn and peel
 Its not like you can save me
 it's not like you even care
 I'm finding it so hard to hold on

 This is where it falls apart
 I feel helpless as my everything
 comes crashing down on me
 This is where it falls apart
 I feel helpless as my fucking world
 comes crashing down
 Crashing down on me


 "SO WRONG"

 Waste thoughts of you
 wasted prayers to you
 Give me back my mind
 I'm empty inside
 What have I become
 Everythings undone
 A candle burns in your honor
 My soul a shrine I've built for you
 I've got nothing left inside me
 there's nothing left but you
 Can't seem to pretend
 This night has to end
 I can't fill this hole
 You are all I know

 It's so wrong that I need you
 It's so wrong that I need abuse
 It's so wrong that I need you
 so wrong that I'm scared I'll die alone


 "CRUSHING ME"

 I'm feeling the weight of the world and it's crushing me
 I'm feeling the weight of everyday life and it's crushing me

 How much more will it take
 How much more until it breaks me
 This world is crushing me

 I'm feeling the hate of the world and it's crushing me
 I'm feeling the hate of everyday life and it's crushing me

 I swallow the hate, betrayal and lies
 Swallow it whole and shove it deep down inside of me
 I'm feeling the weight of the world and it's crushing me
 How much more will it take
 How much more until it breaks me
 This world is crushing me


 "SLEEP"

 She's been here so many times before
 She can't remember when she last felt anything at all
 but this fear and anger
 She stares intently at the door
 listens for his footsteps
 She knows exactly whats in store
 and the knowing makes it worse
 When he calls her daddy's litle girl
 she doesn't hear him
 When he crushes her he can't feel
 Her screams are silent
 Hides in the corner of her mind
 where she plays contently
 She leaves this nightmare far behind
 escapes inside her dreams
 Floating high above her bed
 staring at her fathers head
 Wishing one of them was dead
 so this hell could finally end


 "SLIPPING AWAY"

 I feel it slipping away
 I gave it all and no one cared
 I feel it slipping away
 No more pain no more fear
 I feel it slipping away
 I just can't learn to forget
 Now I'm choking on the memories
 choking on regret
 I tried but I can't find a way
 to untangle all the pieces
 after they've been thrown away
 I will not suffer this loss of you
 again and again and again
 I refuse to continue to live
 in this perpetual nightmare
 I decide it ends right here
 I feel it slipping away
 Everythings slipping away


 "Monosyllabic Girl"
 by NOFX

 I take her to the aquarium, she says shark 
 I take her to the planetarium, she says dark 
 I take her to the seaside 
 where she likes to spin and twirl 
 she says sure and cool and yeah 
 she's my monosyllabic girl 
 I take her to the university, she says huh 
 I take her to out anniversary, she says one 
 I take her to the jewelry store 
 I say diamonds, she says pearl 
 oh everyone knows I'm in love 
 with a monosyllabic girl 
 

 "Talk Dirty to Me"
 by Poison

 You know I never
 I never seen you look so good
 You never act the way you should
 But I like it
 And I know you like it too
 The way that I want you
 I gotta have you
 Oh yes, I do

 You know I never
 I never ever stay out late
 You know that I can hardly wait
 Just to see you
 And I know you cannot wait
 Wait to see me too
 I gotta touch you

 Chorus:
 Cause baby we'll be
 At the drive-in
 In the old man's Ford
 behind the bushes
 till I'm screamin' for more
 Down the basement
 lock the cellar door
 And baby
 Talk dirty to me

 You know I call you
 I call you on the telephone
 I'm only hoping that you're home
 So I can hear you
 When you say those words to me
 And whisper so softly
 I gotta hear you

 Chorus

 C.C. pick up that guitar and talk to me

 Solo, Chorus out


 "If I Were A Killer"
 by Galactic Cowboys

 This is just a hypothetical story
 Of someone let's just say it's me

 I'd gain acceptance for my murderous ways
 By stalking a defenseless prey

 Chorus:
 If I were a Killer,
 I'd smile just like the boy next door
 If I were a Killer,
 I'd say I'd do it for the poor
 If I were a Killer,
 You'd bring me victims more and more
 If I were a Killer

 Supreme Court would agree to hear my case
 And find me innocent of crime

 Holding public rallies to incite sympathy
 Creative actuality

 Chorus:
 If I were a Killer
 I'd hide behind a doctor's door
 If I were a Killer
 I'd scrape you off my office floor


 "Two-Headed Boy"
 by Neutral Milk Hotel

 Two headed boy
 All floating in glass
 The sun it has passed
 Now it's blacker than black
 I can hear as you tap on your jar
 I am listening to hear where you are
 I am listening to hear where you are
 
 Two headed boy
 Put on sunday shoes
 And dance round the room to accordion keys
 With the needle that sings in your heart
 Catching signals that sound in the dark
 Catching signals that sound in the dark
 We will take off our clothes
 And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
 
 Two headed boy
 With pulleys and weights
 Creating a radio played just for two
 In the parlor witha moon across her face
 And through the music he sweetly displays
 Silver speakers that sparkle all day
 Made for his lover who's floating and choking with her hands across her face
 And in the dark we will take off our clothes
 And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
 
 Two headed boy
 There is no reason to grieve
 The world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves
 Left beneath Christmas trees in the snow
 And I will take you and leave you alone
 Watching spirals of white softly flow
 Over your eyelids and all you did
 Will wait until the point when you let go

 "Monty"
 by Spiderbait

 I've got a toy that'll cut right through ya
 You don't think that I am lying to ya
 I'll get away and I'll say I'm a legend
 Taking all the things from your friends that I mentioned
 
 Get up now it's a new fear
 I bought you so why don't you love me
 Gotta lotta guts but you know I'm lazy
 Such a fine line it's easy fans easy
 
 I run for the picket
 And I'm sticking to my story
 Got your blessing for some glory
 They've got the scene and your queen looks good and
 They try to rage if it gets too dirty
 President fun with the hotels misses
 Such a fine time thinking oh now is he


 "California Uber Alles"
 by Jello Biafra / Dead Kennedys

 I am governor Jerry Brown
 My aura smiles and never frowns
 Soon I will be president...
 Carter power will soon go away
 I will be Fuhrer one day
 I will command all of you
 Your kids will meditate in school
 
 California Uber alles
 California Uber alles
 Uber alles California
 Uber alles California
 
 Zen fascists will control you
 Hundred percent natural
 You will jog for the master race
 And always wear the happy face
 
 Close your eyes, can't happen here
 Big Bro' on white horse is near
 The hippies won't come back you say
 Mellow out or you will pay
 
 California Uber alles
 California Uber alles
 Uber alles California
 Uber alles California

 Now It Is 1984
 Knock knock at your front door
 It's the suede denim secret police
 They have come for your uncool niece

 Come quietly to the camp
 You'd look nice as a drawstring lamp
 Don't you worry, it's only a shower
 For your clothes here's a pretty flower
 
 Die on organic poison gas
 Serpent's egg's already hatched
 You will croak, you little clown
 When you mess with President Brown
 
 California Uber alles
 Uber alles California


 "Crucified"
 by Lillian Axe

 Come a little closer with your thoughts of an insurrection,
 A little black mark in the book of your life could bring a change of your
     affection
 Got a one track mind, it's the sign of the times, find a whole new
     revelation,
 Prime time, any time, pay the bailiff for your crime,
 Don't lose your concentration

 No, No, No, I don't wanna be crucified

 Got a heavy cross to bear when there's salt in your lacerations,
 At least when I die I can look 'em in the eye, see them off to eternal
     damnation
 See the bloodstained curtains in the temple of love
 Where the truth is a state of your mind
 Kneel down, kiss the ground, better never make a sound
 How can they see when they're so damn blind?

 Chorus:
 Can you believe in something
 Not fit for their consumption?
 Hold on strong to the end
 Use the force in the back of your mind
 I can't accept what they say
 I choose to go my own way
 I don't want to be crucified

 Flying high, sanctify, living a lie, by the hand of intoxication,
 Under attack, see the scars on my back, think it's time for a needed
     vacation

 No, No, No, I don't want to be crucified

 Chorus


 "Television, The Drug of the Nation"
 by Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy
 
 One Nation
 under God
 has turned into
 One Nation under the influence
 of one drug
 
 Television, the drug of the Nation
 Breeding ignorance and feeding radiation
 
 T.V., it
 satellite links
 our United States of unconciousness
 Apathetic therapeutic and extremely addictive
 the methadone metronome pumping out
 150 channels 24 hours a day
 you can flip through all of them
 and still there's nothing worth watching
 T.V. is the reason why less than ten percent of our
 Nation reads books daily
 Why most people think Central America
 means Kansas
 Socialism means unamerican
 and Apartheid is a new headache remedy
 absorbed in its world it's so hard to find us
 It shapes our minds the most
 maybe the mother of our Nation
 should remind us
 that we're sitting to close to. . .
 
 Television, the drug of the Nation
 Breeding ignorance and feeding radiation
 
 T.V. is
 the stomping ground for political candidates
 Where bears in the woods
 are chased by Grecian Formula'd
 bald eagles
 T.V. is mechanized politic's
 remote control over the masses
 co-sponsered by environmentally safe gases
 watch for the PBS special
 It's the perpetuation of the two party system
 where image takes precedence over wisdom
 Where sound bite politics are served to
 the fastfood culture
 Where straight teeth in your mouth
 are more important than the words
 that come out of it
 Race baiting is the way to get selected
 Willie Horton or
 Will he not get elected on . . .
 
 Television, the drug of the Nation
 Breeding ignorance and feeding radiation
 
 T.V. is it the reflector or the director?
 Does it imitate us
 or do we imitate it
 Because a child watches 1500 murders before he's
 twelve years old and we wonder how we've created
 a Jason generation that learns to laugh
 rather than abhor the horror
 T.V. is the place where
 armchair generals and quarterbacks can
 experience first hand
 the excitement of video warfare
 as the theme song is sung in the background
 Sugar sweet sitcoms
 that leave us with a bad actor taste while
 pop stars metamorphosize into soda pop stars
 You saw the video
 You heard the soundtrack
 Well now go buy the soft drink
 Well, the only cola that I support
 would be a union C.O.L.A. (Cost of Living Allowance)
 On Television.
 
 Television, the drug of the Nation
 Breeding ignorance and feeding radiation
 
 Back again, "New and Improved",
 we return to our irregularly programmed schedule
 hidden cleverly between heavy breasted
 beer and car commericals
 CNNESPNABCTNT but mostly B.S.
 Where oxymoronic language like
 "virtually spotless" "fresh frozen"
 "light yet filling" and "military intelligence"
 have become standard
 T.V. is the place where phrases are redefined
 like "recession" to "necessary downturn"
 "crude oil" on a beach to "mousse"
 "Civilian death" to "collateral damages"
 and being killed by your own Army
 is now called "friendly fire"
 T.V. is the place where the pursuit
 of happiness has become the pursuit of
 trivia
 Where toothpaste and cars have become
 sex objects
 Where imagination is sucked out of children
 by a cathode ray nipple
 T.V. is
 the only wet nurse
 that would create a cripple
 
 Television, the drug of the Nation
 Breeding ignorance and feeding radiation
 
 On Television ...
 
 
 "Black Tornado"
 by Dan Bern

 I've been speaking later and later in the day
 Most days I don't talk 'till maybe 8 o'clock at night
 It keeps me whole, keeps me holy
 Keeps me way up in the mountains even when I'm on the road
 Keeps me coming up for air
 Keeps me airing out some cum
 Keeps me cool

 And every place I go is one less place I could call home
 And every girl I kiss, well I just cross her off my list
 I don't go far, I just go crazy
 I buried all of my old clothes out in some field in West Des Moines
 And if you judge me tonight, judge me by the songs I write
 That's who I am to you

 And there's a black tornado, black tornado
 Spinning around in my body and sometimes
 Black tornado, black tornado
 Spinning around in my body sometime
 
 Yeah I could do tonight with someone soft and warm and furry
 But that ain't likely to occur in south central Missouri
 It's a day off, it's an off day
 It's a Budweiser, budget tel, Bukowski kind of night
 I only got what's on my back, guitar and a back pack
 My soul is intact
 
 And there's a black tornado, black tornado
 Spinning around in my body and sometimes
 Black tornado, black tornado
 Spinning around in my body sometime
 
 Things are changing faster than I can describe
 All I really know to do is grab the wheel and drive
 I look for love, and some adventure
 And I try not to let my own breathing scare me off the road
 There's a tombstone of my father I visit sometimes
 There's a tombstone of my father I visit sometimes
 There is a tombstone of my dad I go sit by sometimes
 Tell him what's been going on

 And there's a black tornado, black tornado
 Spinning around in my body and sometimes
 Black tornado, black tornado
 Spinning around in my body and sometimes
 A red tornado, sometimes red tornado
 Spinning around in my body and sometimes
 Black tornado, black tornado
 Spinning around in my body sometimes


 "Mad About You"
 by Slaughter

 Don't you know, know, know
 What you're doin' to me
 Only you drive me wild
 You're my ecstasy

 Can't you tell
 By the look in my eyes
 That I love you
 I've gotta show ya
 What I feel in my heart
 Cause I knew it
 Right from the start

 That I'm mad about you
 I go crazy with
 All of the things that you do
 I'm mad about you
 I'm so angry inside
 And it's all over you
 I'm mad about you

 Don't ya go, go, go
 Too f-far away
 I need you close by my side
 Always here to stay

 It's been a long time baby
 Ooh I keep this brewin' inside
 I can't take anymore
 Oh girl I'm made about you

 I'm mad about you
 Can't you tell
 When I look in your eyes
 I'm mad about you


 "Political Science"
 by Randy Newman

 No one likes us-I don't know why
 We may not be perfect, but heaven knows we try
 But all around even our old friends put us down
 Let's drop the big one and see what happens
 We give them money-But are they grateful?
 No they're spiteful and they're hateful
 They don't respect us-so let's surprise them
 We'll drop the big one and pulverize them
 
 Asia's crowded and Europe's too old
 Africa is far too hot
 And Canada's too cold
 And South America stole our name
 Let's drop the big one
 There'll be no one left to blame us
 We'll save Australia
 Don't wanna hurt no kangaroo
 We'll built an All American amusement park there
 They got surfin too
 
 Boom goes London and boom Paree
 More room for you and more room for me
 And every city the whole world round
 Will just be another American town
 Oh how peaceful it will be
 We'll set everybody free
 You'll wear a Japanese kimono
 And there'll be Italian shoes for me
 They'll hate us anyhow
 So let's drop the big one now
 Let's drop the big one now
 

 "No More Tears"
 by Ozzy Osbourne

 The light in the window is a crack in the sky
 A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
 A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back
 The man in the dark will bring another attack

 our momma told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers
 Look in the mirror tell me do you uthink your life's in danger here, yeah

 CHORUS
 No more tears

 Another day passes as the night closes in
 The red light goes on to say it's time to begin

 I see the man around the corner waiting, does he see me?
 I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here

 CHORUS

 So now that it's over can't we just say goodbye?
 I'd like to move on and make the most of the night
 Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way
 Your lips are so cold I don't know what else to say

 I never wanted it to end this way my love my darling
 Believe me when I say to you in love I think I'm falling here

 CHORUS


 "Everything You Know Is Wrong"
 by "Weird Al" Yankovic

 I was driving on the freeway in the fast lane
 with a rabid wolverine in my underwear
 when suddenly a guy behind me in the back seat
 popped right up and cupped his hands across my eyes
 I guessed, "Is it Uncle Frank or Cousin Louie?
 Is it Bob or Joe or Walter?
 Could it be Bill or Jim or Ed or Bernie or Steve?"
 I probably would have kept on guessing
 but about that time we crashed into the truck
 And as I'm laying bleeding there on the asphalt
 finally I recognize the face of my hibachi dealer
 who takes off his prosthetic lips and tells me
 
 Everything you know is wrong
 Black is white, up is down and short is long
 And everything you thought was just so
 important doesn't matter
 Everything you know is wrong
 Just forget the words and sing along
 All you need to understand is
 Everything you know is wrong
 
 I was walkin' to the kitchen
   for some Golden Grahams
 when I accidentally stepped
   into an alternate dimension
 and soon I was abducted by
   some aliens from space
 who kinda looked like Jamie Farr
 They sucked out my internal organs
 and they took some polaroids and said I was
   a darn good sport
 and as a way of saying thank you
 they offered to transport me back to any
   point in history that I would care to go
 And so I had them send me back to last
   Thursday night
 so I could pay my phone bill on time
 Just then the floating disembodied head of
   Colonel Sanders started yelling
 
 Everything you know is wrong
 Black is white, up is down and short is long
 And everything you thought was just so
   important doesn't matter
 Everything you know is wrong
 Just forget the words and sing along
 All you need to understand is
 Everything you know is wrong
 
 I was just about to mail a letter to my evil twin
 when I got a nasty papercut
 and, well, to make a long story short
 it got infected and I died
 so now I'm up in heaven with St. Peter by
 the pearly gates
 and it's obvious he doesn't like the
   Nehru jacket that I'm wearing
 He tells me that they've got a dress code
 Well, he lets me into heaven anyway
 but I get the room next to the noisy ice machine
 for all eternity
 and every day he runs by screaming
 
 Everything you know is wrong
 Black is white, up is down and short is long
 And everything you used to think was so important
 Doesn't really matter anymore because the
   simple fact remains that
 Everything you know is wrong
 Just forget the words and sing along
 All you need to understand is
 Everything you know is wrong
 Everything you know is wrong
 

 "What's the ugliest part of your body?"
 by Frank Zappa
 
 What's the ugliest
 Part of your body?
 What's the ugliest
 Part of your body?
 
 Some say your nose
 Some say your toes
 (I think it's your mind)
 But I think it's
 YOUR MIND
 (Your mind)
 I think it's your mind
 
 ALL YOUR CHILDREN ARE
 POOR UNFORTUNATE VICTIMS
 OF SYSTEMS BEYOND THEIR CONTROL
 A PLAGUE UPON YOUR IGNORANCE
 FOR THE GRAY DESPAIR
 OF YOUR UGLY LIFE
 
 Where did Annie go
 When she went to town?
 Who are all those creeps
 That she brings around?
 
 ALL YOUR CHILDREN ARE
 POOR UNFORTUNATE VICTIMS
 OF LIES YOU BELIEVE
 A PLAGUE UPON YOUR IGNORANCE
 THAT KEEPS THE YOUNG FROM
 THE TRUTH THEY DESERVE...


 "Get Your Gunn"
 by Marilyn Manson

 Goddamn your righteous hand

 I eat innocent meat
 The housewife I will beat
 The prolife I will kill
 What you won't do I will
 I bash myself to sleep
 What you sow I will reap
 I scar myself you see
 I wish I wasn't me
 I am the little stick
 You stir me into shit
 I hate therefore I am
 Goddamn your righteous hand
 Goddamn, Goddamn Goddamn, Goddamn

 Pseudo-morals work real well on the talk shows for the week
 But your selective judgements and goodguy badges don't mean to fuck to me

 I am the VHS
 Record me with your fist
 Want me to save the world
 I'm just a little girl

 Get your gunn, get your gunn Get your gunn, get your gunn


 "Welcome Home (Sanitarium)"
 by Metallica

 Welcome to where time stands still no one leaves and no one will
 Moon is full, never seems to change just labeled mentally deranged
 Dream the same thing every night I see our freedom in my sight
 No locked doors,
 No windows barred
 No things to make my brain seem scarred
 Sleep my friend and you will see that dream is my reality
 They keep me locked up in this cage can't they see it's why my brain says
 Rage

 Sanitarium, leave me be
 Sanitarium, just leave me alone

 Build my fear of what's out there and cannot breathe the open air
 Whisper things into my brain assuring me that I'm insane
 They think our heads are in their hands but violent use brings violent plans
 Keep him tied, it makes him well he's getting better, can't you tell?
 No more can they keep us in
 Listen, damn it, we will win
 They see it right, they see it well
 but they think this saves us from our Hell

 Sanitarium, leave me be
 Sanitarium, just leave me alone
 Sanitarium, just leave me alone

 Fear of living on natives getting restless now
 Mutiny in the air got some death to do
 Mirror stares back hard
 Kill, it's such a friendly word seems the only way for reaching out again.
 

 "Freewill"
 by Rush

 There are those who think that life has nothing left to chance,
 A host of holy horrors to direct our aimless dance.
 
 A planet of playthings,
 We dance on the strings
 Of powers we cannot perceive
 "The stars aren't aligned,
 Or the gods are malign..."
 Blame is better to give than receive.

 Chorus
 You can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice.
 If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.
 You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill;
 I will choose a path that's clear
 I will choose freewill.

 There are those who think that they were dealt a losing hand,
 The cards were stacked against them; they weren't born in Lotusland.

 All preordained
 A prisoner in chains
 A victim of venomous fate.
 Kicked in the face,
 You can't pray for a place
 In heaven's unearthly estate.

 Chorus

 Each of us
 A cell of awareness
 Imperfect and incomplete.
 Genetic blends
 With uncertain ends
 On a fortune hunt that's far too fleet.

 Chorus


 "Home"
 by Depeche Mode

 Here is a song from the wrong side of town
 Where I'm bound to the ground by the loneliest sound
 And it pounds from within and is pinning me down

 Here is a page from the emptiest stage
 A cage or the heaviest cross ever made
 A gauge of the deadliest trap ever laid

 And I thank you for bringing me here
 For showing me home
 For singing these tears
 Finally I've found that I belong here

 The heat and the sickliest sweet smelling sheets
 That cling to the backs of my knees and my feet
 Well I'm drowning in time to a desperate beat
 
 And I thank you for bringing me here
 For showing me home
 For singing these tears
 Finally I've found that I belong

 Feels like home
 I should have known
 From my first breath

 God send the only true friend I call mine
 Pretend that I'll make amends the next time
 Befriend the glorious end of the line

 And I thank you for bringing me here
 For showing me home
 For singing these tears
 Finally I've found that I belong here


 "7 ZARK 7"
 by Spiderbait

 Take away the pain
 Take away the pain
 Take away the pain
 Take away the pain I suffer every day

 Give me everything
 I want everything
 Give me everything
 I want everything that I'm supposed to hate

 Feed it 'till it cracks
 Smash it through the bridge
 Bust it up and (something)
 
 Take me to the edge
 And I will take you back
 Crack it up
 And try to crack it down but I am just about too late


 Album: Falling Into Infinity
 by Dream Theater


 "New Millennium"

    A single star behind me
    A red sky burns ahead
    A lonely light below me
    Awake among the dead
    An overwhelming feeling
    Leaves me numb and strange
    A sense of new beginning
    I sense a wind of change

    Out with the old useless
    People so cold ruthless
    Welcome in a new millennium
    How many times must I
    Live out this nightmare I
    Can't wait until a new millennium

    I've got this feeling
    The tide is turning now baby
    Funny feeling
    Everything's gonna be alright now

    Living out a constant deja vu
    Keep your head up
    Please be patient we will get to you
    Keep your head up
    Just have some faith and you can see it through
    Keep your head up
    But faith don't pay the rent that's overdue
    Keep your head up
    All that's glittering is turning blue
    Keep your head up
    What they want from me ain't gotta clue
    Keep your head up
    Swallow pride before it swallows you
    Keep your head up
    Don't dare bite the hand that's starving you
    Keep your head up

    How can you keep your head
    And not go insane
    When the only light at the end
    Of the tunnel is another train

    Lies ten feet tall
    Have broken my fall
    Welcome you all new millennium
    It's well overdue
    And I can't wait to
    Welcome in a new millennium

    I've got this feeling                   [This section is repeated 3
    The tide is turning now baby             times.]
    Funny feeling
    Everything's gonna be alright now

  
 "You Not Me"
 by Dream Theater

    Being round you is driving me crazy
    Watching you run is making me lazy
    You're trying to buy a place in my head
    Telling me lines I've already read
    Speaking my name to try to confuse me
    Say it again you're starting to lose me

    That's alright I'm okay
    It happens every single day
    It's all the same
    But I'm not blind

    It's all about you not me
    It's all about the things
    That you're expecting me to be
    There's not enough time to live
    And all that you're expecting me to give

    It's all about you not me
    It's all about you not me

    You're building my prison brick by brick
    Eating your words is making me sick
    You get what you want
    Cause nothing is sacred
    You're reading my mind
    And leaving me naked
    You say I gotta give before I receive it
    One of these days I'll believe it.

    It's all about you not me
    It's all about the things
    That you're expecting me to be
    There's not enough time to live
    And all that you're expecting me to give

    It's all about you not me
    It's all about you not me

    That's alright I'm okay
    It happens every single day
    It's all the same
    But I'm not blind

    It's all about you not me
    It's all about the things
    That you're expecting me to be
    There's not enough time to live
    And all that you're expecting me to give

    It's all about you not me
    It's all about you not me
    It's all about you not me

 "Peruvian Skies"

    There, there it is
    I swear he's gonna murder that poor kid
    Wait, I hear it again
    Don't turn on the lights until we
    Hear the way it ends

    Under Peruvian skies
    Vanessa regretfully waits
    The story unfolds in her eyes
    Where midnight hysteria's
    No big surprise
    Battered and bruised
    Always confusing
    The love that she's losing for hate
    Poor Vanessa
    Poor, poor Vanessa

    Hey, I hope you know
    I'm taking all of this with me when I go
    Shame, you're not to blame
    I'm the monster you created
    In your daddy's name

    Under Peruvian skies
    Vanessa regretfully waits
    The story unfolds in her eyes
    Where midnight hysteria's
    No big surprise
    Battered and bruised
    Always confusing
    The love that she's losing for hate
    Poor Vanessa
    Poor Vanessa

    Terror by night
    Liar by day
    Telling her secrets
    Won't take them away

    Under Peruvian skies
    Vanessa regretfully waits
    The story unfolds in her eyes
    Where midnight hysteria's
    No big surprise
    Battered and bruised
    Always confusing
    The love that she's losing for hate

  
 "Hollow Years"

    He's just the kind of man
    You hear about
    Who leaves his family for
    An easy out
    They never saw the signs
    He never said a word
    He couldn't take another day

    Carry me to the shoreline
    Bury me in the sand
    Walk me across the water
    And maybe you'll understand

    Once the stone
    You're crawling under
    Is lifted off your shoulders
    Once the cloud that's raining
    Over your head disappears
    The noise that you'll hear
    Is the crashing down of hollow years

    She's not the kind of girl
    You hear about
    She'll never want another
    She'll never be without
    She'll give you all the signs
    She'll tell you everything
    Then turn around and walk away

    Carry me to the shoreline
    Bury me in the sand
      (Into the waves)
    Walk me across the water
    And maybe you'll understand

    Once the stone
    You're crawling under
      (Once the stone)
    Is lifted off your shoulders
    Once the cloud that's raining
    Over your head disappears
    The noise that you'll hear
    Is the crashing down of hollow years

    Carry me to the shoreline
    Bury me in the sand
      (Into the waves)
    Walk me across the water
    And maybe you'll understand

    Once the stone
    You're crawling under
    Is lifted off your shoulders
    Once the cloud that's raining
    Over your head disappears
    The noise that you'll hear
    Is the crashing down of hollow years

    Once the stone
    You're crawling under
    Once the stone
    You're crawling under
      (The sound you'll hear,)
    Once the stone
      (the crashing)
    You're crawling under
      (down of hollow years)
    Once the stone
    You're crawling under
    Once the stone
    You're crawling under
    Once the stone
    You're crawling under
      (The sound you'll hear, the crashing down of hollow years)

  
 "Burning My Soul"

    [The voice box repeats of the phrase 'Burning my soul' are done by ]
    [Mike Portnoy (whispering) and John Petrucci and Derek Sherinian on]
    [voice boxes.                                                      ]

   "Pawn is in the womb???"                 [Sample from ???]
      (Burning my soul)

    A thorn in my side, a chip on my shoulder
    A lump in my throat, the size of a boulder
    The chill up my spine, can't get any colder
    And you wonder why I can't smile

    A knot in my gut, an ape on my back
    In the heat of the moment
    I'm knocked off the track
    You drop the ball, I pick up the slack
    And you ask me why my hair's gray

    Twisting, turning
    Losing all sense of yearning
    Living and learning
    The pressure keeps on burning my soul
    Burning my soul
    Burning my soul

    I say it's green and then you tell me it's red
    Keep your thoughts and ideas
    Locked inside of your head
    We've got someone
    Who can think for you instead
    And he sounds just like the last one

    Twisting, turning
    Losing all sense of yearning
    Living and learning
    The pressure keeps on burning my soul
    Burning my soul
    Burning my soul
    Burning my soul
    Burning my soul

    Responsible thinkers
    Throw caution to the wind
    But I find myself
    Speaking from within
    I can't live my life
    Walking on eggshells
    To stay on your good side

    Using your words
    Controlling my life
    Can't you see it's my words
    That gives you your life
    So I hurt your feelings
    Well I'm really sorry
    But I don't give a shit, no...

    Twisting, turning
    Losing all sense of yearning
    Living and learning

    The pressure keeps on burning my soul
    Burning my soul
    Burning my soul
    Burning my soul
    Burning my soul
    Burning my soul
    Burning my soul, yeah
 
  
 "Lines In The Sand"

    Sometimes, for a moment of bliss
    And the passion, we're craving
    There's a message we miss
    Sometimes when, the spirits left alone
    We must believe in something
    To find if we've grown

    Tragic reflex, shattered calm
    Static progress, senses gone
    Numb awareness, final psalm

    Swept away with the tide
      (Swept away with the tide)
    Through the holes in my hands
      (Through the holes in my hands)
    Crown of thorns at my side
      (Crown of thorns at my side, yeah, yeah, yeah)
    Drawing lines in the sand

    Sometimes, if you're perfectly still
    You can hear the virgin weeping
    For the savior of your will
    Sometimes, your castles in the air
    And the fantasies you're seeking
    Are the crosses you bear

    Sacred conflict, blessed prize
    Weeping crosses, stainless eyes
    Desperate addict, faith disguised 

    Swept away with the tide
      (Swept away with the tide)
    Through the holes in my hands
      (Through the holes in my hands, yeah)
    Crown of thorns at my side
      (Crown of thorns at my side)
    Drawing lines in the sand

    We fabricate our demons
    Invite them into our homes
    Have supper with the aliens
    And fight the war alone
    We conjure up our skeletons
    Enlist the den of thieves
    Frightened from our closets
    Then sewn upon our sleeves

    In the stream of consciousness
    There is a river crying
    Living comes much easier
    Once we admit
    We're dying

    Sometimes, in the wreckage of our wake
    There's a bitterness we harbor
    And hate for hatred's sake
    Sometimes we dig an early grave
    And crucify our instincts
    For the hope we couldn't save

    Sometimes a view from sinless eyes
    Centers our perspective
    And pacifies our cries
    Sometimes the anguish we survive
    And the mysteries we nurture
    Are the fabrics of our lives

    Swept away with the tide
      (Swept away with the tide, yeah)
    Through the holes in my hands
      (Through the holes, holes in my hands)
    Crown of thorns at my side
      (Crown of thorns in my side)
    Drawing lines in the sand

  
 "Take Away My Pain"

    I was sitting on the edge of his bed
    Staring at the headlines on the paper
    He said, 'Look at poor Gene Kelly
    I guess he won't be singing in the rain.'
    You can take away my heroes
    Can you take away my pain

    Take away my pain
    Leave the cold outside
    Please don't let it rain
    Don't stumble on my pride
    Take away my pain
    I'm not frightened anymore
    Just stay with me tonight
    I'm tired of this fight
    Soon I'll be knocking at your door

    She was standing by the edge of his bed
    Staring at the message on their faces
    He said, 'What else can you do, babe?
    I guess I won't be coming home again.'
    They just took away all my promises
    Make them take away my pain

    Take away my pain
    Leave the cold outside
    Please don't let it rain
    Don't stumble on my pride
    Take away my pain
    I'm not frightened anymore
    Just stay with me tonight
    I'm tired of this fight
    Soon I'll be knocking at your door

    His final scene
    The actor bows
    And all those years
    Are gone somehow
    The crowd applauds
    The curtain falls

    I was standing by the edge of the water
    I noticed my reflection in the waves
    Then I saw you looking back at me
    And I knew that for a moment
    You were calling out my name
    You took away my hero
    Will you take away my pain

    Take away my pain
    Let the cold inside
    It's time to let it rain
    There's nothing left to hide
    Take away my pain
    I'm not frightened anymore
    I'm learning to survive
    Without you in my life
    Til you come knocking at my door...

  
 "Just Let Me Breathe"

    Open your eyes
    And turn off your mind
    Step right up folks
      "Step right up folks"                 [Spoken by Mike Portnoy]
    and you will find
    A growing trend
    An epidemic
    Spread with zen
    And hypodermics, yeah
    Yeah

    Just close your mind
    You can find all you need with your eyes

    The big machines take care of you
    Until you kill yourself
    And then the sales go through the roof
    Calculated, formulated
    Feed my head with simple thoughts
    And let me breathe instead of being taught
    All bottled up and tearing at the seams
    I'm bored
    Just let me breathe

    A daily dose of eMpTyV
    Will flush your mind right down the drain
    Shannon Hoon and Kurt Cobain,
    Make yourself a household name, yeah-yeah
    Yeah

    Just close your mind
    You can find all you need with your eyes

    The big machines take care of you
    Until you kill yourself
    And then the sales go through the roof
    Calculated, formulated
    Feed my head with simple thoughts
    And let me breathe instead of being taught
    All bottled up and tearing at the seams
    I'm bored
    Just let me breathe

    Strike up your best angst ridden posture, whoa
    Manufactured anger
    Let's not forget my legacy
    All my heroes have failed me
    Now they're dead and buried, yeah

    Just close your mind
    You can find all you need with your eyes

    The big machines will take care of you
    Until the fashion fades
    And the checks go through
    My bankroll's red
    And my face is blue
    And still they'll turn their backs on me for someone new

    Feed my head
    With some real thoughts
    And let me think instead
    Of being taught
    I'll say things
    You won't believe
    Just stand back 
    Just let me breathe...

  
 "Anna Lee"

    Helpless child
    They invite your hands to fill their needs
    Will you be the same
    Shameless smile
    To steal from you the innocence that bleeds
    Will they feel your pain

    Trying to believe
    The scars unseen
    The tears wash clean
    You don't wanna breathe the air you breathe
    You don't know how you'll live a life alone

    She keeps holding on
    Holding on to you
    Let her breathe the air
    Don't wanna be alone
    Where do you belong
    Anna Lee

    Behind those eyes
    A vivid scene
    A lucid dream within
    Questioned secrets are revealed
    And every time
    You can't deny
    The lines that trace your skin
    Wounds that never heal

    Trying to believe
    The scars unseen
    The tears wash clean
    You don't wanna breathe the air you breathe
    You don't know how you'll live a life alone

    She keeps holding on
    Holding on to you
    Let her breathe the air
    Don't wanna be alone
    Where do you belong
    Anna Lee

    And now she's calling out a name
    Can't keep on hiding all her pain
    You feel the rain move in
    As you begin
    To turn and answer the call

    Trying to believe
    The scars unseen
    The tears wash clean
    You don't wanna breathe the air you breathe
    You don't know how you'll live a life alone

    She keeps holding on
    Holding on to you
    Let her breathe the air
    Don't wanna be alone
    Where do you belong
    Anna Lee

 
 "Trial Of Tears"

    i. It's Raining
    Under the sun, there is nothing to hide
    Under the moon, a stranger waits inside
    People disappear
    The music fades away
    Splashing through the rain
    I'll dream with them one day

    It's raining, raining,
    On the streets of New York City
    It's raining, raining, raining, deep in heaven

    I may have wasted all those years
    They're not worth their time in tears
    I may have spent too long in darkness
    In the warmth of my fears

    Take a look at yourself
    Not at anyone else
    And tell me what you see
    I know the air is cold
    I know the streets are cruel
    But I'll enjoy the ride today

    It's raining, raining,
    On the streets of New York City
    It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven
    Raining deep in heaven

    I may have wasted all those years
    They're not worth their time in tears
    I may have spent too long in darkness
    In the warmth of my fears

    As I walk through all my myths
    Rising and sinking like the waves
    With my thoughts wrapped around me
    Through a trial of tears

    Hidden by disguise, stumbling in a world
    Feeling uninspired, he gets into his car
    Not within his eyes to see, open up, open up
    Not much better than the man you hate

    ii. Deep In Heaven (instrumental)

    iii. The Wasteland
    Still awake
    I continue to move along
    Cultivating my own nonsense
    Welcome to the wasteland
    Where you'll find ashes, nothing but ashes
    Still awake
    Bringing change, bringing movement, bringing life
    A silent prayer thrown away,
    Disappearing in the air
    Rising, sinking, raining deep inside me
    Nowhere to turn,
    I look for a way back home

    It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven
    It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven
    It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven
    It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven


 "To This Day"
 by K's Choice

 I'm waiting for the bus to come
 I'm lying on a bench
 Thinking of a book I read
 And wondering what it meant
 I hear footsteps coming closer
 It's an ordinary man
 He comes up to me, shakes my hand
 And asks me who I am
 I am paralysed, I can't talk or move
 What could I say
 And before I have the chance to think
 I tell this man my name
 I tell this man my name

 He smiles and looks away
 But I still don't know the answer to this day
 To this day
 To this day
 To this day...
 To this day
 To this day
 To this day...
 (I don't know the answer...)


 "Clean My Wounds"
 by Corrosion of Conformity

 I see the world thru blood shot eyes
 Streets filled with blood from distant lies
 The dogs of war never comprise,
 No time for rearranging

 Help me Jesus, help me clean my wounds
 He said he cannot heal that kind
 Bleeding soul becomes a bitter mind
 He said it happens every time...

 That's how the story goes
 In the land of a 1000 no's
 I'm all over you
 In time my mind is changing

 Knock it down

 Black on black gives me a heart attack
 And the silence makes it deadly
 Some choose to kill with a simple will
 I've seen them fall fast and steady

 Help me Jesus help me clean my wounds
 He said he cannot heal that kind
 Bleeding soul bitter mind
 He said it happens every time...

 Knock it down

 That's how the story goes
 In the land of a 1000 no's
 I'm all over you
 In time my mind is changing

 Twist of fate won't give me a break
 And myself I'm slow and tired
 I've got to rise with these blood shot eyes
 But I keep falling when I'm higher...

 Help me Jesus help me clean my wounds
 He said he cannot heal that kind
 Bleeding soul bitter mind
 He said it happens every time...

 Knock it down

 That's how the story goes
 In the land of a 1000 no's
 We are bleeding sins but our
 Sins are always fading

 Fading
 Fading

 Knock it down
 Knock it down


 "Don't Kill Nipper"
 by Spiderbait

 It's all over don't you know
 There's nothing left for me and you

 It's been a long time coming!
 No point running!

 What will you do when everything burns up
 And you want to travel back in your head
 And your dead

 Everybody wants to be someone
 But if your dead it won't be fun

 It's been a long time coming!
 No point running!

 You thought the sun shone out of your buttcheeks
 And all around your head
 Illuminated

 Sit right back and find a friend
 It won't be long until the end

 It's been a long time coming!
 No point running!

 I can't wait to see the look on your face
 When you realise I'm not talking shit
 And that's it
 

 "Get Me Away From Here I'm Dying"
 by Belle & Sebastian

 ooh, get me away from here i'm dying
 play me a song to set me free
 nobody writes them like they used to
 so it may as well be me
 here on my own now after hours
 here on my own now on a bus
 think of it this way
 you could either be successful or be us
 with our winning smiles, and us
 with our catchy tunes, and us
 now we're photogenic
 you know, we don't stand a chance

 oh, i'll settle down with some old story
 about a boy who's just like me
 thought there was love in everything and everyone
 you're so naive!
 after a while they always get it
 they always reach a sorry end
 still it was worth it as i turned the pages solemnly, and then
 with a winning smile, the boy
 with naivety succeeds
 at the final moment, i cried
 i always cry at endings

 oh, that wasnt what i meant to say at all
 from where i'm sitting, rain
 washing against the lonely tenement
 has set my mind to wander
 into the windows of my lovers
 they never know unless i write
 "this is no declaration, i just thought i'd let you know goodbye"
 said the hero in the story
 "it is mightier than swords
 i could kill you sure
 but i could only make you cry with these words"


 "Short People"
 by Randy Newman

 Short People got no reason
 Short People got no reason
 Short People got no reason
 To live

 They got little hands
 And little eyes
 And they walk around
 Tellin' great big lies

 They got little noses
 And tiny little teeth
 They wear platform shoes
 On their nasty little feet

 Well, I don't want no Short People
 Don't want no Short People
 Don't want no Short People
 Round here

 Short People are just the same
 As you and I
 (A Fool Such As I)
 All men are brothers
 Until the day they die
 (It's A Wonderful World)

 Short People got nobody
 Short People got nobody
 Short People got nobody
 To love

 They got little baby legs
 And they stand so low
 You got to pick 'em up
 Just to say hello

 They got little cars
 That got beep, beep, beep
 They got little voices
 Goin' peep, peep, peep

 They got grubby little fingers
 And dirty little minds
 They're gonna get you every time
 
 Well, I don't want no Short People
 Don't want no Short People
 Don't want no Short People
 'Round here


 "To Have and To Hold"
 by Depeche Mode

 I need to be cleansed.  It's time to make amends.  For all of the fun. The
 damage is done.  And I feel diseased.  I'm down on my knees.  And I need
 forgiveness.  Someone to bear witness.  To the goodness within.  Beneath the
 sin.  Although I may flirt with all kinds of dirt.  To the point of disease.
 Now I want release from all this decay.  Take it away.  And somehwere
 there's someone who cares.  With a heart of gold. To have and to hold.



 "Everybody Knows"
 by Leonard Cohen
 
 Everybody knows that the dice are loaded
 Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
 Everybody knows that the war is over
 Everybody knows the good guys lost
 Everybody knows the fight was fixed
 The poor stay poor, the rich get rich
 That's how it goes
 Everybody knows
 
 Everybody knows that the boat is leaking
 Everybody knows that the captain lied
 Everybody got this broken feeling
 Like their father or their dog just died

 Everybody talking to their pockets
 Everybody wants a box of chocolates
 And a long stem rose
 Everybody knows

 Everybody knows that you love me baby
 Everybody knows that you really do
 Everybody knows that you've been faithful
 Ah give or take a night or two
 Everybody knows you've been discreet
 But there were so many people you just had to meet
 Without your clothes
 And everybody knows

 Everybody knows, everybody knows
 That's how it goes
 Everybody knows
 
 Everybody knows, everybody knows
 That's how it goes
 Everybody knows
 
 And everybody knows that it's now or never
 Everybody knows that it's me or you
 And everybody knows that you live forever
 Ah when you've done a line or two
 Everybody knows the deal is rotten
 Old Black Joe's still pickin' cotton
 For your ribbons and bows
 And everybody knows

 And everybody knows that the Plague is coming
 Everybody knows that it's moving fast
 Everybody knows that the naked man and woman
 Are just a shining artifact of the past
 Everybody knows the scene is dead
 But there's gonna be a meter on your bed
 That will disclose
 What everybody knows

 And everybody knows that you're in trouble
 Everybody knows what you've been through
 From the bloody cross on top of Calvary
 To the beach of Malibu
 Everybody knows it's coming apart
 Take one last look at this Sacred Heart
 Before it blows
 And everybody knows

 Everybody knows, everybody knows
 That's how it goes
 Everybody knows
 
 Oh everybody knows, everybody knows
 That's how it goes
 Everybody knows
 
 Everybody knows
 

 "Run"
 by Spiderbait

 Ooo Ooo, whatta you do?
 Come-a-running after you
 Gonna chase you 'till your hair turns blue
 Up the hill and around the bend
 Gonna get you in the end
 Better look out baby when I do

 Run! Run! Run!
 Coming to get you
 Run! Run! Run!
 I'm running

 Oh Oh, Don't go slow
 Ain't about to let you go
 Gonna chase you 'till your hair turns grey
 Up the hill and around the bend
 Gonna get you in the end
 Never gonna let you get away

 Run! Run! Run!
 Coming to get you
 Run! Run! Run!
 I'm running
 
 Ooo Ooo, whatta you do?
 Come-a-running after you
 Gonna chase you 'till your hair turns blue
 
 Up the hill and around the bend
 Gonna get you in the end
 Better look out baby when I do
 
 Run! Run! Run!
 Coming to get you
 Run! Run! Run!


 "February Stars"
 by Foo Fighters

 I'm hanging on
 Here until I'm gone
 I'm right where I belong
 Just hanging on
 Even though I watched you come and go
 How was I to know, you'd steal the show?

 One day i'll have enough gamble
 I'll wait to hear your final call
 And bet it all

 I'm hanging on
 Here until I'm gone
 I'm right where I belong
 Just hanging on
 Even though I pass this time alone
 Somewhere so unknown
 It heals the soul

 You ask for walls
 I'll build them higher
 We'll lie shadows of them all
 I'd stand but they're much too tall
 And I fall

 February Stars
 Floating in the dark
 Temporary scars
 February Stars


 "Everlong"
 by Foo Fighters

 Hello I've waited here for you
 Everlong
 Tonight I throw myself into
 And out of the red
 Out of her head she sang

 Come down
 And waste away with me
 Down with me
 Slow how
 You wanted it to be
 I'd over head
 Out of her head she sang

 And I wonder
 When I sing along with you
 If everything could ever feel this real forever
 If anything could ever be
 Be this good again
 The only thing I'll ever ask of you
 You've got to promise not to stop when I say when

 Breathe out so I can breathe you in
 Hold you in
 And now I know
 You've always been out of your head
 Out of my head I sang


 Album: Nighttime Birds
 by The Gathering


 "On Most Surfaces (Inuït)"

 The frost hits me in the eye
 and wakes me
 these are blury winters
 and I cannot see

 I walk into the white light of the snow
 when the sun comes
 I break it with my shadow
 which tells me where I go

 The frost hits me in the eye
 and wakes me

 I am the snow falling down on you
 I tear up your face with my frost
 And make you run to somewhere warm
 When I come I see you get away
 I burst out about your emptyness

 The frost hits me in the eye
 and wakes me
 These are blury winters
 and I cannot see


 "Confusion"

 False eyes are staring
 disrespectfull and untrue
 the burden that we are carrying
 is way too much for me and you

 Sometimes it is better to lay
 don't you think?

 I'm evaporating
 a veil of smoke is what I am
 your thoughts will take on their way
 to grow old and to be certain

 Sometimes it is better to lay
 don't you think?


 "The May Song"

 I'm waiting for your hands
 to fold around my wrist
 I'm mellowing in warm grass
 and the scent of you I've missed

 And blue is representing
 the draft in my heart
 I'm wandering through thin skies
 and the transparent air I've missed

 Pale is my face
 you might want to colour
 while I breathe

 I'm following large drops of rain
 with my eyes on the sight of you I've missed

 Pale is my face
 you might want to colour
 while I breathe


 "The Earth Is My Witness"

 Mother earth looks at her closely
 she looks at her baby and she sighs
 the slight breathing pause that she takes it builds her and
 makes her strong

 She refuses to give her up
 and we close our eyes

 Her hands touch the round stomach
 and feel the kick
 The eyes that have seen so much cry
 with the water she starts to rinse her face

 And refuses to give her up
 And we close our eyes
 And you close your eyes


 "New Moon, Different Day"

 I'm at the waterside
 my cold feet are numb
 I want to cross
 I want to get inside

 The clouds make a circle
 on the soil that I'm on
 and I trust what surrounds me
 I want to cross

 I break the storm through the clouds

 I'm at the other side
 I watch time pass
 and I see, I have to go along
 with the water that will lead the way
 and I feel, the rain on my head
 and the drops hit me one by one

 I break the storm through the clouds


 "Third Charm"

 Fear and sweat, my muscles ache
 I smile, but it's just a fake
 I fade away
 it troubles me, what you're gonna say
 just a day away
 and you will be here to stay

 I wait and I wait
 and what I really hate
 is the panic that stops me from breathing
 my knees hit the floor
 and I panic more
 until you open my door


 "Kevin's Telescope"

 His hands hide inside a sleeve
 and little feet play with the ground beneath him while
 up in the sky is where he wants to be

 Time will fly
 and the wind plays with him
 the night will give him its charm

 While he walks home
 his head's up in a cloud
 he feels his pores fill up with fresh air
 and there is no doubt
 that one day he will be
 where the eye of his telescope has already been

 Night will pass
 but he's a lot faster
 no one can do him any harm


 "Nighttime Birds"

 Their ways are open
 they spread as their wings
 they want to be certain
 of a warm surrounding

 When they fly
 through the night as beautiful
 nighttime birds

 The warm winds pick them up

 When they fly
 through the night as beautiful
 nighttime birds


 "Shrink"

 To feel this great urge
 to hold and embrace you
 I slowly dry out

 I shrink and shrink
 until I'm gone
 nothing to make out of me
 oh what the hell went wrong
 my heart gets pulled out
 into your direction
 it's no use
 you have forsaken me


 "Where You'll Find Me Now"
 by Neutral Milk Hotel

 All I perceive is wasted and broken
 Silvery streams, sacred when spoken
 Slam into me and into the ditch of debris
 And you smoke in the park and sleep in the greenery
 Everyone barks and they are all still believing
 To tear out your heart would send all your secrets to me

 But I let you down
 And swollen and small is where you'll find me now
 With that silver stripping off
 From my tongue you're tearing out
 And you'll never hear me talk

 Your teeth believe that teeth are for tearing
 Tear into me and the scent of you sweating smells good to me
 And out in the dark the world is still rolling
 Kids in their cars, cigarette smoking
 And all that they are just reeks with the sweetest belief
 
 But I let you down
 And swollen and small is where you'll find me now
 With that silver stripping off
 From my tongue you're tearing out
 And you'll never hear me talk
 
 All I could want is silver and spinning
 Out from your arms and into the pretty pit of your heart
 So simply and softly we'd flow
 
 But I let you down
 And swollen and small is where you'll find me now
 With that silver stripping off
 From my tongue you're tearing out
 And you'll never hear me talk

 Into you I will glow


 "Hangar 18"
 by Megadeth

 Welcome to our fortress tall
 Take some time to show you around
 Impossible to break these walls
 For you see the steel is much too strong
 Computer banks to rule the world
 Instruments to sight the stars

 Possibly I've seen to much
 Hangar 18
 I know too much

 Foreign life forms inventory
 Suspended state of cryogenics
 Selective amnesia's the story
 Believed foretold but who'd suspect
 The military Intelligence
 Two words combined that can't make sense

 Possibly I've seen to much
 Hangar 18
 I know too much


 "Pop That Pussy"
 by 2 Live Crew

 FKI = Fresh Kid Ice
 BM = Brother Marquis

 Blowfly:
 "Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-od-DAMN!!  Shee-yee-YIT!!  Look at the ass
 on that bitch!  Look at the titties!"

 (Mixx scratches "Aw hit me!" and "Hold your legs up on easy.")
 
 Verse 1
 [FKI]  There's only one place where we can go
        To see freaky hoes doin' shows
        Doin' tricks to make us holler
        On a giving night, all for a dollar
        Silicone breasts, all on their chests
        Nothin' like others, but above the rest
        They'll do anything to turn us on
        Them hoes got it goin' on!!
 [BM]   I like big booty and big ol' titties
        Bitch, you know you've been fucked by many
        So come and be my private dancer
        I got some money if that's the answer
        I really wanna be with you;
        I get hard after seeing you
        How hard?  Hard like a rock,
        When you make that pussy pop!
 
 Chorus(2x):  Luke
 Pop that pussy!  Heyyy!  Pop that pussy, baby!
 Pop that pussy!  Pop, pop that pussy, baby!
 
 Verse 2
 [FKI]  Freaky bitches with plenty of ass
        Rollin' to the music and shakin' real fast
        Bend over backwards, make me shout
        And work that pussy, in and out
        Movin' their body with plenty of action
        Bringin' to the men more satisfaction
        Doin' what they feel to turn us out
        Just work that pussy all the way out!
 [BM]   Shake it!  Don't break it!
        It took your momma nine months to make it
        Bend over and spread 'em, girl
        Show-w-w me those pussy pearls
        Rub that ass and play with that clit
        You know I like that freaky shit
        Girl, you know you look so cute
        Throwin' that pussy the way you do!
 
 Chorus
 
 Verse 3
 [FKI]  Poppin' that pussy's a dance for the ladies
        Straight from the South, into the 90's
        Freaky bitches are the ones I like
        In G-strings in the middle of the night
        Smoke-filled stages, bitches in cages
        Guards at the door, armed with gauges
        As they dance and I get hot,
        Keep throwin' that pussy!  Don't stop!
 [BM]   I like the way you lick the champagne glass
        It makes me wanna stick my dick in your ass
        So come on, baby, and pop it quick
        I fall in love when you suck my dick
        Bitch, you don't know?  You ain't heard?
        Fuckin' with me, you're gonna get served
        See, none of my bitches, they never complain
        So come on, baby, and pop that thang!
 
 Luke:
 Janet J, pop, that pus-sy!
 Bu-bles, pop, that pus-sy!
 Sandra P, pop, that pus-sy!
 Ma-donna, pop that stinky smelly pussy, baby!
 
 (Mixx scratches "Work this motherfucker!"  "Shit, this good!"  "Woo hoo!")
 
 Luke: BREAKDOWN!!
 
 
 "You've Got To Hide Your Love Away"
 by The Beatles

 Here I stand head in hand
 Turn my face to the wall
 If she's gone I can't go on
 Feelin' two-foot small
 Everywhere people stare
 Each and every day I can see them laugh at me
 And I hear them say

 Hey you've got to hide your love away
 Hey you've got to hide your love away

 How can I even try I can never win
 Hearing them, seeing them
 In the state I'm in
 How could she say to me
 Love will find a way
 Gather round all you clowns
 Let me hear you say

 Hey you've got to hide your love away
 Hey you've got to hide your love away


 "Me, Myself & I"
 by De La Soul

 DOVE: Mirror, mirror on the wall
 Tell me, mirror, what is wrong?
 Can it be my De La clothes
 Or is it just my De La song?
 What I do ain't make-believe
 People say I sit and try
 But when it comes to being De La
 It's just me myself and I

 It's just me myself and I (x 3)

 POS: Now you tease my Plug One style
 And my Plug One spectacles
 You say Plug One and Two are hippies
 No, we're not, that's pure Plug bull
 Always pushing that we've formed an image
 There's no need to lie
 When it comes to being Plug One
 It's just me myself and I

 It's just me myself and I (x3)

 DOVE: Proud, I'm proud of what I am
 Poems I speak are Plug Two type
 Please oh please let Plug Two be
 Himself, not what you read or write
 Right is wrong when hype is written
 On the Soul, De La that is,

 Style is surely our own thing
 Not the false disguise of showbiz
 De La Soul is from the soul
 And this fact I can't deny
 Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie
 And from me myself and I

 It's just me myself and I (x3)

 POS: Glory, glory hallelu
 Glory for Plugs One and Two
 But that glory's been denied
 By kizids and dookie eyes
 People think they dis my person
 By stating I'm darkly pack
 I know this so I point at Q-Tip
 And he states, 'Black is Black'
 Mirror mirror on the wall,
 Shovel chestnuts in my path
 Please keep on up with the nuts
 So I don't get in aftermath
 But if I do I'll calmly punch them
 In the fourth day of July
 'Cause they tried to mess with Third degree,
 that's me myself and I

 It's just me myself and I (x4)


 "Icicle"
 by Tori Amos
 
 Icicle, Icicle, where are you going?
 I have a hiding place when spring marches in
 will you keep watch for me, I hear them calling
 gonna lay down gonna lay down

 greeting the monster in our Easter dresses
 Father says bow your head like the Good Book says
 well I think the Good Book is missing some pages 
 gonna lay down gonna lay down

 and when my hand touches myself I can finally rest my head
 and when they say 'take of his body' I think I'll take from mine instead
 Getting Off, Getting Off
 while they're all downstairs
 singing prayers, sing away
 he's in my pumpkin p.j's
 lay your book on my chest
 feel the word feel the word feel the word feel it
 I could have, I should have, I could have flown
 you know I could have I should have I didn't so


 "Cars"
 by Gary Numan

 Here in my car
 I feel safest of all
 I can lock all my doors
 It's the only way to live
 In cars
 Here in my car I
 can only receive
 I can listen to you
 It keeps me stable for days
 In cars
 Here in my car
 The image breaks down
 Will you visit me please
 If I open my door
 In cars
 Here in my car
 I know I've started to think
 About leaving tonight
 Although nothing seems right
 In cars
 I know I've started to think
 I know I've started to think


 "Ramshackle"
 by Beck

 You've been so long
 Your blind eyes are gone
 Your old bones are on their own

 So take off your coat
 Put a song in your throat
 Let the dead-beats pound all around

 We will go
 Nowhere we know
 We don't have to talk at all
 Hand me downs
 Flypaper towns
 Stuck together
 One and all

 The bargains you drive
 Buckets and bags
 And all your belongings
 
 Your train's in the sand
 Ramshackle land
 Let the rats watch the races
 
 We will go
 Nowhere we know
 'Til we find our one and all
 Hand me downs
 Flypaper towns
 Stuck together
 One and all

 Praises get spent
 Your trick face is bent
 Pigsties and prizes
 
 'Cause there's no kind of 'well'
 You're suiting yourself
 You leave yourself behind
 
 We will go
 Nowhere we know
 'Til we find our one and all
 Your hand me downs
 Flypaper towns
 Stuck together
 One and all


 "Bring the Noise"
 by Anthrax and Public Enemy

 Verse 1
 Basss!
 How low can you go?
 Death row, what a brother knows
 Once again back is the incredible
 The rhyme animal
 The incredible D, Public Enemy, number one
 "Five-O" said, "Freeze!" and I got numb
 Can I tell 'em that I really never had a gun
 But it's the wax that the terminator x spun
 Now they got me in a cell 'cause my records, they sell
 Cause a brother like me said, "Well...
 ...Farrakahn's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
 what he can say to you, what you ought to do"
 Follow for now, power of the people, say,
 "Make a miracle, D, pump the lyrical"
 Black is back, all in, we're gonna win
 Check it out, yeah y'all c'mon, here we go again

 Chorus
 Turn it up!  Bring the noise

 Verse 2
 Never badder than bad 'cause the brother is madder than mad
 At the fact that's corrupt as a senaotor
 Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope
 Caus the beats in the lines are so dope
 Listen for lessons I'm saying inside music
 That the critics are blasting me for
 They'll never care for the brothers and sisters now across
 The country has us up for the war
 We got to demonstrate, come on now, they're gonna have to wait,
 'till we get it right
 Radio stations I question their blackness
 They call themselves black, but we'll see if they'll play this

 Chorus

 Verse 3
 Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me
 My deejay is warm, he's x, I call him Norm ya know
 He can cut a record from side to side
 So what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide
 Soul control, beat is the father of your rock 'n' roll
 Music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band man
 Makin' a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know
 You call'em demos, but we ride limos too
 Whatcha gonna do?  Rap is not afraid of you
 Beat is for Sonny Bono, beat is for Yoko Ono
 Run-DMC first said a deejay could be a band
 Stand on it's own feet, get you out your seat
 Beat is for Eric B and L L as well, hell
 Wax is for Anthrax, still I can rock bells ever forever,
 Universal it will sell
 Time for me to exit, terminator x-it

 Chorus

 Verse 4
 From coast to coast, so you stop being like a comatose
 Stand my man?  The beat's the same with a boost-toast
 Rock with some pizzazz, it will last, why you ask?
 Roll with the rock stats, you'll never get accepted as
 We got to plead the fifth, we can investigate
 Don't need to wait, get the record straight
 Hey, posse's in effect, got flavor, terminator
 X to sign checks, play to get paid
 We got to check it out down on the avenue
 A magazine or tow is dissing me and dissing you
 Yeah, I'm telling you...


 "Hey You"
 by Pink Floyd

 Hey you, out there in the cold
 Getting lonely, getting old 
 Can you feel me?
 Hey you, standing in the aisles
 With itchy feet and fading smiles 
 Can you feel me?
 Hey you, dont help them to bury the light
 Don't give in without a fight.

 Hey you, out there on your own
 Sitting naked by the phone 
 Would you touch me?
 Hey you, with you ear against the wall
 Waiting for someone to call out 
 Would you touch me?
 Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?
 Open your heart, I'm coming home.
 
 But it was only fantasy.
 The wall was too high, 
 As you can see.
 No matter how he tried, 
 He could not break free.
 And the worms ate into his brain.
 
 Hey you, standing in the road
 always doing what you're told, 
 Can you help me?
 Hey you, out there beyond the wall,
 Breaking bottles in the hall, 
 Can you help me?
 Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all
 Together we stand, divided we fall.

 [Click of TV being turned on]
 "Well, only got an hour of daylight left. Better get started"
 "Isnt it unsafe to travel at night?"
 "It'll be a lot less safe to stay here. You're father's gunna pick up our
     trail before long"
 "Can Loca ride?"
 "Yeah, I can ride... Magaret, time to go! Maigret, thank you for everything"
 "Goodbye Chenga"
 "Goodbye miss ..."
 "I'll be back"


 "Tainted Love"
 by Soft Cell

 Sometimes I feel I've got to
 Run away I've got to
 Get away
 From the pain that you drive into the heart of me
 The love we share
 Seems to go nowhere
 And I've lost my light
 For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night

 Chorus
 Once I ran to you (I ran)
 Now I'll run from you
 This tainted love you've given
 I give you all a boy could give you
 Take my tears and that's not nearly all
 Oh...tainted love
 Tainted love

 Now I know I've got to
 Run away I've got to
 Get away
 You don't really want any more from me
 To make things right
 You need someone to hold you tight
 And you think love is to pray
 But I'm sorry I don't pray that way

 Repeat chorus

 Don't touch me please
 I cannot stand the way you tease
 I love you though you hurt me so
 Now I'm going to pack my things and go
 Tainted love, tainted love (x2)
 Touch me baby, tainted love (x2)
 Tainted love (x3)


 "Live To Tell"
 by Madonna

 I have a tale to tell
 Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well 
 I was not ready for the fall 
 Too blind to see the writing on the wall 

 A man can tell a thousand lies
 I've learned my lesson well 
 Hope I live to tell 
 The secret I have learned 'till then 
 It will burn inside of me 

 I know where beauty lives
 I've seen it once I know the warmth she gives 
 The light that you could never see 
 It shines inside you can't take that from me 

 A man can tell a thousand lies
 I've learned my lesson well 
 Hope I live to tell 
 The secret I have learned 'till then 
 It will burn inside of me

 The truth is never far behind
 You kept it hidden well 
 If I live to tell 
 The secret I knew then 
 Will I ever have the chance again 

 If I ran away
 I'd never have the strength 
 To go very far 
 How would they hear 
 The beating of my heart 
 Will it grow cold 
 The secret that I hide 
 Will I grow old 
 How will they hear 
 When will they learn 
 How will they know 

 A man can tell a thousand lies
 I've learned my lesson well 
 Hope I live to tell 
 The secret I have learned 'till then 
 It will burn inside of me 

 The truth is never far behind
 You kept it hidden well 
 If I live to tell 
 The secret I knew then 
 Will I ever have the chance again 


 "Black Sunshine"
 by White Zombie

 (Gripping the wheel, his knuckles went white with desire!
 The wheels of his Mustang exploding on the highway like a slug from a .45.
 True death: 400 horsepower of maximum performance piercing the night...
 This is black sunshine.)

 Yeah! Move me in the silence baltic motorway
 hang me on the edge before I fall away
 Apocalypse is dawnin' action on the mile.
 A "can-do" revolution
 Earth to the river [nile]

 Sweet'n the ride - Black Sunshine
 Sweet'n the ride - Yeah
 Sweet'n the ride - Black Sunshine
 Sweet'n the ride - Yeah!

 Cry a river "cosmic"
 Moon in Scorpio,
 feel her body "breathe"
 Acid radio
 Tell me that you like it
 when I'm going down!
 Tell me that you like it
 Move to the speed of [sound]

 Sweet'n the ride - Black Sunshine
 Sweet'n the ride - Yeah
 Sweet'n the ride - Black Sunshine
 Sweet'n the ride - Yeah! Go!

 Slide into
 I said "44"
 cool heart can
 A hypnotize
 dream into infinity
 I turned the love to lies
 crawl across the water
 wave and sink into the sea
 Reflect'n onto everything
 that you can never be
 "Check-out" Yeah!

 To the devil a daughter comes
 2000 worlds away Yeah
 Born to lose the love you choose
 Destroy another day
 check out!!

 Sweet'n the ride - Black Sunshine
 Sweet'n the ride Yeah!
 Sweet'n the ride - Black Sunshine
 Sweet'n the ride

 Stare into the T.V.
 kiss off the pain!
 Wonderland is falling
 no sing
 no rain
 Momentary
 damage into the high drift me to the circuit sky

 (Finally nothing moves. High noon
 Blacktop rolling below the asphalt drive
 A concrete fascination scraping the edge of nothing
 This is blacksunshine.)


 "Jack of Speed"
 by Steely Dan

 Teddy's rolling now most every night
 Skatin' backwards at the speed of light
 He's changed - in a thousand little ways
 He's changed - yes indeed
 You know he's movin' on metal, yes he's
 Hanging tight with the Jack of Speed
 
 Sheena's party - there's a case in point
 That right-wing hooey sure stunk up the joint
 He's gone - he walks through the old routines
 But he's gone - guaranteed
 He may be sittin' in the kitchen, but he's
 Steppin' out with the Jack of Speed

 You maybe got lucky for a few good years
 But there's no way back from there to here
 He's a one way rider
 On the shriek express
 And his new best friend is at the throttle more or less
 
 He can't hear you honey - that's alright
 Pack some things and head up into the light
 Don't stop - he'll be callin' out your name
 But don't stop when you hear him plead
 You better move now little darlin' or you'll be
 Trading fours with the Jack of Speed

 "Anesthesia"
 by Bad Religion

 everybody is talking about the girl who went and killed the delivery man,
 but she looks so kind and gentle, it just doesn't stand to reason,
 I saw her right there just the other night as stately as a slot machine,
 but when she looked my way something mad as hell came over me,

 anesthesia, mona lisa,
 I've got a little gun, here comes oblivion,
 I never loved you, how did you find me?
 the cops will never prove complicity now, anna......

 all good children go to heaven!
 I remember your face that august night when we lied about the beautiful time
     to come
 and that crazy old man who came much to late and caused a chain reaction,
 I've been hanging out there for eleven long years like a church mouse where
 the cat has gone,
 and looking at you now is driving me to distraction


 "Give it Away"
 by Red Hot Chili Peppers

 what i've got you've got to give it to your mamma

 what i've got you've got to give it to your mamma
 what i've got you've got to give it to your pappa
 what i've got you've got to give it to your daughter
 you do a little dance and then you drink a little water

 what i've got you've got to get it put it in you
 what i've got you've got to get it put it in you
 what i've got you've got to get it put it in you
 reeling with the feeling don't stop continue

 realize i don't want to be a miser
 confide wisely you'll be the wiser
 young blood is the lovin' upriser
 how come everybody wanna keep it like the kaiser

 give it away give it away give it away now
 give it away give it away give it away now
 give it away give it away give it away now
 give it away give it away give it away now

 give it away now...


 "The Day I Met You"
 by Lillian Axe

 Do you remember when our lives were so complete?
 Long, cold Decembers, so bittersweet.
 
 But if I could set aside one day,
 That I could hold forever
 I would save the day that I met you.

 Is it still magic although we've grown worlds apart?
 It seems so tragic, so frail the heart.
 
 But if I was blessed with just one wish
 To take me through my lonely life
 I'd wish to go back to the day that I met you
 
 And when you feel you're on your own
 Well just believe you're not alone
 And you'll feel the warmth
 That we shared years ago
 Don't be blue

 One painful morning, I stared straight into the sun,
 It overwhelmed me, I came undone
 
 So, if you can find it in your heart
 To be forgiving to a broken man
 We'll go back to the day that I met you. 


 "King of Pain"
 by The Police

 There's a little black spot on the sun today
 That's my soul up there
 It's the same old thing as yesterday
 That's my soul up there
 There's a black hat caught in a high tree top
 That's my soul up there
 There's a flag pole rag and the wind won't stop
 That's my soul up there

 I have stood here before in the pouring rain
 With the world turning circles running 'round my brain
 I guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign
 But it's my destiny to be the king of pain

 There's a fossil that's trapped in a high cliff wall
 There's a dead salmon frozen in a waterfall
 There's a blue whale beached by a springtide's ebb
 There's a butterfly trapped in a spider's web

 There's a king on a throne with his eyes torn out
 There's a blind man looking for a shadow of doubt
 There's a rich man sleeping on a golden bed
 There's a skeleton choking on a crust of bread

 There's a red fox torn by a huntsman's pack
 There's a black winged gull with a broken back
 There's a little black spot on the sun today
 It's the same old thing as yesterday

 I have stood here before in the pouring rain
 With the world turning circles running 'round my brain
 I guess I always thought you could end this reign
 But it's my destiny to be the king of pain......

 I'll always be king of pain..............


 "Hey Ladies"
 by Beastie Boys

 Hey ladies in the place I'm callin' out to ya
 There never was a city kid truer and bluer
 There's more to me than you'll ever know
 And I've got more hits than Sadaharu Oh
 Ton Thumb Tom Cushman or Tom Foolery
 Date women on T.V. with the help of Chuck Woolery
 Words are flowing out just like the Grand Canyon
 And I'm always out looking for a female companion
 I threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib
 I took off her moccasins and put on my bib
 I'm wheelin' and dealin' I make a little bit of stealing
 I'll bring you back to the place and your dress I'm peeling
 Your body's on time and your mind is appealing
 Staring at the cracks up there upon the ceiling
 Some such nonsense is the bass that I'm throwing
 Talking to a girl telling her I'm all knowing
 She's talking to the kid to the who
 I'm telling here every lie that you know that I never did
 Me in the corner with a good looking daughter
 I dropped my drawers and it was welcome back Kotter
 We were cutting up the rug she started cutting up the carpet
 In my apartment I begged her please stop it
 The gift of gab is the gift that I have
 And that girl ain't nothing but the blue plate crab
 Special at Woodman's in Essex Mass
 Educated no stupid yes
 And when I say stupid I mean stupid fresh
 I'm not James at 15 or Chachi in charge
 I'm Adam and I'm adamant about living large
 With the white sassoons and the looks that kill
 Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville
 I met a little cutie she was all hopped up on zootie
 I liked the little cutie but I kicked her in the bootie
 Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around
 You be listening to my records' a number one sound
 Step to the rhythm step step to the ride
 I've got an open mind so why don't you all get inside
 Tune in tune on to my tune that's live
 Ladies flock like fish to my line

 She's got a gold tooth you know she's hardcore
 She'll show you a good time then she'll show you the door
 Break up with your girl it ended in tears
 Vincent Van Gogh and mail that ear
 I call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinking
 The phone booth on the corner is damp and it's stinking
 She said come on over it was me that she missed
 I threw that trash can through her window cause you know I got dissed
 Your old lady left you and you went girls (x3) insane
 You blew yourself up in the back of the 6 train
 Take my advice at any price a gorilla like your mother is mighty weak
 Sucking down pints till I didn't know
 Woke up in the morning at the Won Ton Ho
 Cause I announce I like girls that bounce
 With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce
 Girls with curls and big long locks
 And beatnik chicks just wearing their smocks
 Walking high and mighty like she's #1 and
 *She thinks she's the passionate one*


 "Bergerac"
 by Spiderbait

 Bergerac I think he's coming my way
 Bergerac I think he's coming my way
 Bergerac he's gonna get you some day
 Bergerac he's gonna get you some...
 He's gonna get you some day!

 Bergerac I think he's coming my way
 Bergerac he's gonna get me some day

 Bergerac I think he's comin' to stay
 Bergerac I think he's comin' my way
 Look out! Bergerac I think he's coming my
 I think he's coming my way!


 "Handsome & Gretel"
 by Babes in Toyland

 Gretel said I know what's in your head
 I vacuumed out my head
 I know you're feeling bad
 You fucking bitch you cunthole bitch
 I thought she meant it yeah
 She really jacked my head
 She went and done it

 Handsome Gretel

 My name is Gretel yeah
 I've got a crotch that talks
 It talks to all the cocks
 It's been 12 city blocks you fuckin bitch
 Gretel said "Oh you feel so bad
 I know you feel so bad"
 I thought she meant it

 I vacuumed out my head
 Jumping from bed to bed
 My name is Gretel
 A soul of metal
 My name is Gretel
 I've got a sloppy slot

 Say violets hang around with toilets and look smack at us and symbolize
 everything that is disgust and mistrust
 Licorice eyes pin me down thighs

 Asphixid
 My thighs are vices
 He is a stupid man
 I love him all I can you fucking bitch
 Addle girl
 She pulls out all her curls
 She is a stupid crotch
 That spans 12 city blocks


 "Hammering In My Head"
 by Garbage

 I'm stressed but you're freestyle
 I'm overworked but I'm undersexed
 I must be made of concrete
 I sign my name across your chest
 Give out the same old answers
 I trot them out for the relatives
 Company tried and tested
 I use the ones that I love the best

 Like an animal you're moving over me
 Like an animal you're moving over me

 When did I get perverted
 I can't remember your name
 I'm growing introverted
 You touch my hand but it's not the same
 This was so unexpected
 I never thought I'd get caught
 Play boomerang with your demons
 Shoot to kill and you'll pop them off BANG! BANG!

 Like an animal you're moving over me
 Like an animal you're moving over me

 You should be sleeping my lover
 Tell me what you're dreaming of (rpt. 4 times)

 I knew you were mine for the taking
 I knew you were mine for the taking
 I knew you were mine taking
 When I walked in the room
 I knew you were mine for the taking
 I knew you were mine for the taking
 Your eyes light up
 When I walk in the room

 A hammering in my head don't stop
 From the bullet train
 From Tokyo to Los Angeles
 I'm leaving you behind
 A flash in the pan
 A storm in a teacup
 A needle in a haystack
 A prize for the winning
 A dead for the raising
 A catch for the chasing
 A jewel for the choosing
 A man for the making in this blistering heat

 Sweat it all out
 Sweat it all out
 With your bedroom eyes and your baby pouts
 Sweat it all out
 In our electric storms and our shifting sands
 Our candy jars and our sticky hands
 Sweat it all out (rpt. 6 times)

 Don't forget what I wrote you then
 And don't forget what I told you then
 And don't forget I that meant to win
 And don't forget your ventoline
 So a hammering in my head don't stop
 In the bullet train from Tokyo to Los Angeles


 "Wasteland"
 by Dan Bern

 I saw the best of my generation playing pinball
 Maked up and caked up and looking like some kind of china doll
 With all of Adolph Hitler's moves down cold as they stood up in front of a
     rock n roll band
 And always moving upward and every upward to this gentle, golden promised
     land
 With the smartest of them all moonlighting as a word processor
 And the strongest of them all checking out these outside saloons
 And the prettiest of them all taking off her clothes in front of men whose
     eyes looked like they were in some little
 Hick town near Omaha watching the police chief run his car off the side of a
     bridge

 I saw men with dreams like the once I'd had beg quarters outside the Seven
 Eleven 'til it got so they didn't affect me
 Any more than the mail boxes I'd pass 'cept sometimes I'd put something in
     the mailbox

 I've had the wind at my back
 Now I feel it cold in my face
 And for an awful long time
 You were the only one who ever called me late at night
 And I never really noticed until after you stopped calling
 And the emptiness, silence got so heavy

 Broken up in the wasteland
 Broken up in the promised land
 Broken up in Disneyland
 Broken up in the plastic land
 Broken up in the wasteland
 Broken up in the wasteland
 Broken up in the wasteland

 And I saw dead Marilyn Monroe strung up on every street corner in Hollywood
     like some two-bit whore offering a discount rate and I wonder how Joe
     Dimaggio felt
 And I saw dead James Dean's ghost wandering the sidewalk looking troubled
     and I wondered how his mama felt

 I saw signs that said headshots done for cheap
 And signs that said extras wanted, top dollars paid
 And signs for haircuts
 And signs for manicures
 And signs for tanning salon
 And signs for wardrobe specialists
 And signs for cosmetic surgery
 And signs for assertiveness training
 And I stopped to read them all

 And every single block
 Looked like every single block
 Looked like every single block
 Looked like every single block
 But you kept driving
 Because everyone else kept driving
 Because gridlock is evil
 And not knowing your way is evil

 And those who had money looked good but weren't too happy
 And those who didn't have money didn't look so good and weren't so happy
     either
 And in a city of two million, 958 thousand, 984, everyone was lonely

 And I watched as everyone I knew spent their lives trying to be watched on a
     stage watched in a film or listened to on record and they thought maybe
     that way I could get a little love out of this life

 And I watched as the best of my generation abandoned their dreams and
     settled for making a little money
 And I watched tv and read the papers and listened to the radio and made all
     the fancy scenes and said all the right
 Words and wore all the right clothes and knew the names of the hip people
 But I still felt out of touch so I stopped watching tv and reading the
     papers and listening to the radio and making the fancy scenes and saying
     the right words and wearing the right clothes and knowing the names of
     the hip people and
 I felt more out of touch than ever, but I didn't care anymore

 And I felt you slipping away
 And I felt myself slipping from you
 And I wanted more than anything else for it to rain for one whole day like
     it used to but all there ever was sun, relentless sun, hot beating sun
     and everyone wore their sunglasses and walked around like flies under a
     magnifying glass with their eyes removed


 "Why I Like The Robins"
 by Hum

 The distance outside of view comes into focus, collapses away lovingly 
 and hands to the glass and eyes to sky and glued to the south she waits to
     see
 She's looking for birds she met last fall, 
 Who said they would come back different than all 
 She's waiting for six who know about sound, 
 Who'd promised to come back upside down 
 and i like your raindrop collector, 
 Splash in my eyes and makes everything else look like you 
 So hand me the glasses and teach me to use them, 
 Show me the window, i want to look too 
 I'll take the glasses and cover for you, 
 You get some sleep and i'll stay til two. 
 I'm looking for six who know about sound, 
 Who promised to come back upside down 
 She's got colors to spare and i don't care what they choose 
 and i've got nothing to do and nothing like you left to lose 
 

 "I'd Like Your Hair Long"
  by Hum

 I'd like your hair long and ladeled to the ground 
 You'd prefer an astronaut 
 Someone to relate to and someone to command 
 and i would be a simple man 
 I could hardly wait for my stars to fall in line 
 and synchronize and shine 
 a wasted string of years, and a wasted string of lies 
 It's still the same to me 
 It's a waste of a song 
 You're a waste of my lungs 
 It's a waste of a song 
 I'd like your face gone and in its place the sun 
 and i would be an astronaut 
 For i have come to surface to catch some light and feed 
 and i have everything i need 
 and i could hardly wait for my stars to fall in line 
 and synchronize and shine 
 a wasted string of years, and a wasted string of lies 
 You're still the same to me 
 You're a waste of a song 
 You're a waste of my lung 
 It's a waste of a song 
 

 "I Hate It Too"
 by Hum

 Morning gray ignites a twisted mess of foreign shapes and sounds 
 I wish the ceiling was the ground 
 I'll send you flowers made of silent tiny pieces of the sun 
 to help me make up for this one 
 While you send me tidal waves of love when you're alone 
 and i can't remember what you do 
 to find a way to turn the signal back to heaven sounding blue 
 and bring me faithful back to you 
 and she don't hold me right, she's never going to get me there 
 not tonight 
 If we break off gently in slow motion, spinning outward into space 
 My hand always floating gently at the wheel while you sweetly hold my face 
 and i need you to give it meaning, i need you to share the view 
 or it becomes a time for me to love myself like every other thing i do 
 

 "Songs of Farewell and Departure"
 by Hum

 Before we steam and descend, steady to the sun 
 A simple tale of woe, your hearts won't be undone 
 A love song to everyone i know 
 Arms wide open, here we go 
 She weaves a trail of petals through the embryonic ice 
 Her hair was warm to the touch and flowers twice as nice 
 and if he stands on the moon he can barely catch her eyes 
 Always open to the sky 
 and so we land only to find we never left the ground 
 Please leave the walls and the floors exactly as you found 
 A love song to everyone i know 
 Arms wide open, here we go 
 

 Album: Exile In Guyville
 by Liz Phair


 "6' 1""

 I bet you fall in bed too easily
 With the beautiful girls who are shyly brave
 And you sell yourself as a man to save
 But all the money in the world is not enough
 
 I bet you've long since passed understanding 
 What it takes to be satisfied
 You're like a vine that keeps climbing higher
 But all the money in the world is not enough
 And all the bridges blown away keep floating up
 
 Its cold
 And rough
 And I kept standing 6'1" 
 Instead of 5'2"
 And I loved my life
 And I hated you

 Its cold, out there
 And rough
 And I kept standing 6'1" 
 Instead of 5'2"
 And I loved my life
 And I hated you


 "Help Me, Mary"

 Help me Mary please.
 I've lost my home to your thieves
 They bully the stereo and drink
 They leave suspicious things in the sink
 
 They make rude remarks about me
 They wonder just how wild I would be
 As they egg me on and keep me mad
 They play me like a pit bull in a basement, and for that

 I lock my door at night
 I keep my mouth shut tight
 I practice all my moves
 I memorize their stupid rules
 
 I make myself their friend
 I show them just how far I can bend
 As they egg me on and keep me mad
 They play me like a pit bull in a basement, and for that
 
 I'm asking, will you, Mary, please
 Temper my hatred with peace
 Weave my disgust into fame
 And watch how fast they run to the flame
 

 "Glory"

 He's got a really big tongue
 It rolls way out
 Snaking around in the club
 It slicks you down
 Scratching his face like a bum
 He pulls you back
 Circa nineteen eighty-one
 He pulls you back
 
 You are, you are, shining some glory 
 You are, you are, shining some glory 
 On me, on me
 You are, you are, shining some glory 
 You are, you are, shining some glory on me
 

 "Dance Of The Seven Veils"

 Johnny my love, get out of the business
 It makes me wanna rough you up so badly
 Makes me wanna roll you up in plastic
 Toss you up and pump you full of lead
 
 Johnny my love, get out of the business
 The odds are getting fatter by the minute
 That I have got a bright and shiny platter
 And I am gonna get your heavy head

 I only ask because I'm a real cunt in spring
 You can rent me by the hour
 I know all about the ugly pilgrim thing
 Entertainers bring May flowers

 So Johnny my love
 We got us a witness
 Now all we gotta do is get a preacher
 He can probably skip the "until death" part
 'Cause Johnny my love you're already dead

 I only ask because I'm a real cunt in spring
 You can rent me by the hour
 I know all about the ugly pilgrim thing
 Entertainers bring May flowers

 May flowers, May flowers, (To You)


 "Never Said"

 (yeah)
 
 I never said nothing
 I never said nothing
 I never said nothing
 I never said nothing

 I don't know where you heard it
 Don't know who's spreadin' it 'round
 All I know is I'm clean as a whistle baby
 I didn't utter a sound

 I never said nothing
 I never said nothing
 I never said nothing
 I never said nothing

 I don't know what they told you
 Don't even care what about
 All I know is I'm clean as a whistle baby
 I didn't let the cat out

 So don't look at me sideways
 Don't even look me straight on
 And don't worry I've got my hands in my pockets, baby
 I ain't done anything wrong

 I never said nothing
 No baby, I never said nothing
 I never said nothing
 I never said nothing
 I never said nothing
 No, not to anyone
 I never said nothing
 I never said nothing
 I never said nothing


 "Soap Star Joe"

 He's just a hero
 In a long line of heroes
 Looking for something attractive to save
 They say he rode in
 On the back of a pickup
 And he won't leave town 
 'til you remember his name

 He's just a hero
 In a long line of heroes
 Looking for some lonely billboard to grace
 They say he sprung from the skull of Athena
 Think about your own head
 And the headache he gave

 He's just a hero
 In a long line of heroes
 Looking for action at a price he can pay
 They say he's famous
 But no one can prove it
 Make him an offer just to see what he'll say

 Check out the dashboard lights
 Glowing all green and white
 He feels safe in the dark
 He wears his bluejeans tight

 He's just a hero
 In a long line of heroes
 Looking for something attractive to save
 They say he rode in
 On the back of a pickup
 And he won't leave town 
 'Til you remember his name

 Check out the thinning hair
 Check out the aftershave
 Check out America
 You're looking at it babe


 "Explain It To Me"

 Head underwater
 Keeps getting hotter
 Give 'em your medicine
 Fame injection
 Tell them to jump higher
 Tell 'em to run farther
 Make 'em measure up
 Decades longer than you
 
 Piece it together
 It's like weather
 Watch him travel
 Kiss the gravel
 Tell him to jump higher
 Tell him to run farther
 Make him measure up
 Ten times longer than you
 Ever should, you never could 
 Explain them to me, explain them to me


 "Canary"

 I learn my name
 I write with a number two pencil
 I work up to my potential
 I earn my meat
 I come when called
 I jump when you circle the cherry
 I sing like a good canary
 I come when called
 I come, that's all
 
 Send it up on fire
 Death before dawn
 Send it up on fire
 Death before dawn

 I clean the house
 I put all your books in an order
 I make up a colorful border
 I clean my mouth
 'Cause froth comes out
 
 Send it up on fire
 Death before dawn
 Send it up on fire
 Death before dawn


 "Mesmerizing"

 You said things I wouldn't say
 Straight to my face, boy
 You tossed the egg up 
 And I found my hands in place, boy
 After backing up as far as you could get
 Don't you know nobody parts two rivers met
 Don't you know I'm very happy
 You know me well
 I'm even happier 
 I like it
 I like it

 With all of the time in the world to spend it
 Wild and unwise
 I wanna be mesmerizing too
 Mesmerizing too
 Mesmerizing to you
 
 With all of the time in the world to spend it
 Wild and unwise
 I wanna be mesmerizing too
 Mesmerizing too
 Mesmerizing to you
 

 "Fuck and Run"

 I woke up alarmed
 I didn't know where I was at first
 Just that I woke up in your arms
 And almost immediately I felt sorry
 'Cause I didn't think this would happen again
 No matter what I could do or say
 Just that I didn't think this would happen again
 With or without my best intentions, and
 What ever happened to a boyfriend
 The kind of guy who tries to win you over, and
 What ever happened to a boyfriend
 The kind of guy who makes love cause he's in it, and
 
 I want a boyfriend
 I want a boyfriend
 I want all that stupid old shit
 Like letters and sodas
 Letters and sodas

 You got up out of bed
 You said you had a lot of work to do
 But I heard the rest in your head
 And almost immediately I felt sorry
 'Cause I didn't think this would happen again
 No matter what I could do or say
 Just that I didn't think this would happen again
 With or without my best intentions, and
 
 I want a boyfriend
 I want a boyfriend
 I want all that stupid old shit
 Like letters and sodas
 Letters and sodas
 
 I can feel it in my bones
 I'm gonna spend another year alone
 It's fuck and run
 Fuck and run
 Even when I was seventeen
 Fuck and run
 Fuck and run
 Even when I was twelve

 You almost felt bad
 You said that I should call you up but
 I knew much better than that
 And almost immediately I felt sorry
 'Cause I didn't think this would happen again
 No matter what I could do or say
 Just that I didn't think this would happen again
 With or without my best intentions
 
 And I can feel it in my bones
 I'm gonna spend my whole life alone
 It's fuck and run
 Fuck and run
 Even when I was seventeen
 Fuck and run
 Fuck and run
 Even when I was twelve


 "Girls! Girls! Girls!"

 You been around enough to know
 That if I want to leave you better let me go
 Because I take full advantage
 Of every man I meet
 I get away almost every day
 With what the girls call
 What the girls call
 What the girls call
 The girls call murder

 You been around enough to see
 That if you think you're it 
 You better check with me
 Because I take full advantage
 Of every man I meet
 I get away almost every day
 With what the girls call
 What the girls call
 What the girls call . . . the girls call murder


 "Divorce Song"

 And when I asked for a separate room
 It was late at night
 And we'd been driving since noon
 But if I'd known
 How that would sound to you
 I would have stayed in your bed
 For the rest of my life
 Just to prove I was right
 That it's harder to be friends than lovers
 And you shouldn't try to mix the two
 Cause if you do it and you're still unhappy
 Then you know that the problem is you
 
 And it's true that I stole your lighter
 And it's also true that I lost the map
 But when you said that I wasn't worth talking to
 I had to take your word on that
 But if you'd known
 How that would sound to me
 You would have taken it back
 And boxed it up and buried it in the ground
 Boxed it up and buried it in the ground
 Boxed it up and buried it in the ground
 Burned it up and thrown it away
 
 You put in my hands a loaded gun
 And then told me not to fire it
 When you did the things you said were up to me
 And then accused me of trying to fuck it up
 But you've never been a waste of my time
 It's never been a drag
 So take a deep breath and count back from ten
 And maybe you'll be alright
 
 And the license said
 You had to stick around until I was dead
 But if you're tired of looking at my face I guess I already am
 But you've never been a waste of my time
 It's never been a drag
 So take a deep breath and count back from ten
 And maybe you'll be alright
 

 "Shatter"

 I know that I don't always realize 
 How sleazy it is
 Messing with these guys
 But something about just being with you
 Slapped me right in the face
 Nearly broke me in two
 It's a mark
 I've taken hard
 And I know I will carry with me for a long long time

 I don't know if I could drive a car
 Fast enough to get to where you are
 or wild enough not to miss the boat completely
 Honey, I'm thinking maybe
 You know just maybe
 
 I don't know if I could fly a plane
 Well enough to tail spin out your name
 Or high enough to lose control completely
 Honey, I'm thinking maybe
 You know just maybe, maybe
 

 "Flower"

 [high part:]
 
 Every time I see your face
 I get all wet between my legs
 Every time you pass me by
 I heave a sigh of pain
 
 [low part:]
 
 Every time I see your face
 I think of things unpure unchaste
 I want to fuck you like a dog
 I'll take you home and make you like it
 
 Everything you ever wanted  
 Everything you ever thought of is
 Everything I'll do to you
 I'll fuck you and your minions too
 
 Your face reminds me of a flower
 Kind of like you're underwater
 Hair's too long and in your eyes
 Your lips a perfect suck me size
 
 You act like you're fourteen years old
 Everything you say is so
 Obnoxious, funny, true and mean
 I want to be your blowjob queen
 
 You're probably shy and introspective
 That's not part of my objective
 I just want your fresh young jimmy
 Cramming slamming ramming in me
 
 Every time I see your face
 I think of things unpure unchaste
 I want to fuck you like a dog
 I'll take you home and make you like it

 Everything you ever wanted
 Everything you ever thought of is
 Everything I'll do to you
 I'll fuck you 'til your dick is blue


 "Johnny Sunshine"

 You took the car
 It was my favorite one
 Little white Dart
 And drove it to Idaho
 You took the horse
 It was a thoroughbred
 Saddled it up
 Out on the interstate
 You killed the cat
 Put it in antifreeze
 Dumped in the trunk
 With the rest of the cattlefeed
 You took the house
 You went and changed the locks
 Now I am stuck
 Living out of a box

 I think I've been taken
 For everything I own
 I've been hurt so badly
 I'm alone, baby, I'm alone
 
 You left me nothing
 You left me nothing
 Johnny Sunshine
 You left me nothing
 You left me nothing
 Johnny Sunshine
 You left me nothing
 You left me nothing
 Johnny Sunshine
 You left me nothing
 You left me nothing


 "Gunshy"

 Rifle in hand and two in the bush
 Three count delay, I may need a little push
 Take out the garbage on Tuesday nights
 Seems like the small things
 Are the only things I'll fight
 Seems like the small things
 Are the only things I'll fight
 
 Gunshy, Gunshy, Gunshy, Gunshy
 
 Sea monkeys, do monkeys
 Story of my life
 Send three bucks to a comic book
 Get a house, car and wife
 Send three bucks to a comic book
 Get a house, car and wife

 "Stratford-On-Guy"

 I was flying into Chicago at night
 Watching the lake turn the sky into blue-green smoke
 The sun was setting to the left of the plane
 And the cabin was filled with an unearthly glow
 In 27-D I was behind the wing
 Watching landscape roll out
 Like credits on a screen
 The earth looked like it was lit from within
 Like a poorly assembled electrical ball as we moved
 Out of the farmlands into the grid
 The plan of the city was all that you saw
 And all of these people sitting totally still
 As the ground raced beneath them thirty thousand feet down
 
 It took an hour, maybe a day
 But once I really listened, the noise
 Just went away

 And I was pretending that I was in a Galaxie 500 video
 The stewardess came back and checked on my drink
 In the last strings of sunlight, a Bridgette Bardot
 There's a hat on my headphones
 Along with those eyes that you get
 When your circumstance is movie size
 
 It took an hour, maybe a day
 But once I really listened, the noise
 Just went away

 It took an hour, maybe a day
 But once I really listened, the noise
 Just went away


 "Strange Loop"

 The fire you like so much in me
 Is the mark of someone adamantly free
 But you can't stop yourself from wanting worse
 'Cause nothing feeds a hunger like a thirst
 
 Baby I'm tired of fighting
 I always wanted you
 I broke up at the roadhouse
 I wouldn't know you were alive
 You haven't seen me for weeks now
 It wouldn't shock you if
 I drove right out through the back of your eyes
 I can't be trusted 
 They're saying I can't be true
 But I only wanted more than I knew

 Baby I'm tired of fighting
 I always wanted you
 I only wanted more than I knew


 "Silent Lucidity"
 by Queensryche

 Hush now don't cry
 Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
 You're lying safe in bed
 It was all a bad dream
 Spinning in your head
 Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
 Of someone close to you leaving the game of life
 So here it is, another chance
 Wide awake you face the day
 Your dream is over...or has it just begun?

 There's a place I like to hide
 A doorway that I run to in the night
 Relax child, you were there
 But only didn't realize it and you were scared
 It's a place where you will learn
 To face your fears, retrace the tears
 And ride the whims of your mind
 Commanding in another world
 Suddenly, you hear and see
 This magic new dimension

 CHORUS
 I-will be watching over you
 I-am gonna help you see it through
 I-will protect you in the night
 I-am smiling next to you...in silent lucidity

 If you open your mind for me
 You won't rely on open eyes to see
 The walls you built within
 Come tumblng down, and a new world will begin
 Living twice at once you learn
 You're safe from pain in the dream domain
 A soul set free to fly
 A round trip journey in your head
 Master of illusion, can you realize
 Your dream's alive, you can be the guide but...

 CHORUS


 "Not an Addict"
 by K's Choice

 Breathe it in and breathe it out
 And pass it on, it's almost out
 We're so creative, so much more
 We're high above but on the floor

 It's not a habit, it's cool, I feel alive
 If you don't have it you're on the other side

 The deeper you stick it in your vein
 The deeper the thoughts, there's no more pain
 I'm in heaven, I'm a god
 I'm everywhere, I feel so hot

 It's not a habit, it's cool, I feel alive
 If you don't have it you're on the other side
 I'm not an addict (maybe that's a lie)

 It's over now, I'm cold, alone
 I'm just a person on my own
 Nothing means a thing to me
 (Nothing means a thing to me)

 It's not a habit, it's cool, I feel alive
 If you don't have it you're on the other side
 I'm not an addict (maybe that's a lie)

 Free me, leave me
 Watch me as I'm going down
 Free me, see me
 Look at me, I'm falling and I'm falling.

 It is not a habit, it is cool I feel alive I feel...
 It is not a habit, it is cool I feel alive

 It's not a habit, it's cool, I feel alive
 If you don't have it you're on the other side
 I'm not an addict (maybe that's a lie)
 I'm not an addict...


 "New World Man"
 by Rush

 He's a rebel and a runner
 He's a signal turning green
 He's a restless young romantic
 Wants to run the big machine

 He's got a problem with his poisons
 But you know he'll find a cure
 He's cleaning up his systems
 To keep his nature pure

 Learning to match the beat of the Old World Man
 Learning to catch the heat of the Third World Man
 
 He's got to make his own mistakes
 And learn to mend the mess he makes
 He's old enough to know what's right
 But young enough not to choose it
 He's noble enough to win the world
 But weak enough to lose it
 He's a New World Man...

 He's a radio receiver
 Tuned to factories and farms
 He's a writer and arranger
 And a young boy bearing arms

 He's got a problem with his power
 With weapons on patrol
 He's got to walk a fine line
 And keep his self-control

 Trying to save the day for the Old World Man
 Trying to pave the way for the Third World Man
 
 He's not concerned with yesterday
 He knows constant change is here today
 He's noble enough to know what's right
 But weak enough not to choose it
 He's wise enough to win the world
 But fool enough to lose it
 He's a New World Man...


 "Conjunctivitis"
 by Spiderbait

 You make my eyes glow
 Conjunctivitus!
 What ever it is
 Feels like bliss
 
 You make my heart burn
 Appendicitis!
 What ever it is
 Feels like bliss
 
 You'll never know I adore you
 I get this pain in my head
 Then comes the time when I'm near you
 I nearly fall on my
 Head spins
 Meningitis!
 What ever it is
 Feels like bliss

 You're making my teeth shine
 Gingivitis!
 What ever it is
 Feels like bliss
 
 You'll never know I adore you
 I get this pain in my head
 Then comes the time when I'm near you
 I nearly fall on an
 Angel
 Down from the sky
 You give me your halo
 You say with a sigh

 You tell me it's time now
 To make a new start
 You wanted my kidneys
 I gave you my heart
 
 You make me sick when I see you
 I get this pain in my head
 Then comes the time when I'm near you
 I think I'm already dead
 Already dead
 Already dead
 Already dead
 Already dead
 Already dead
 Already dead
 Already dead
 Already dead


 "Selling the Drama"
 by Live

 And to love a god 
 And to fear a flame 
 And to burn a crowd that has a name 

 And to right or wrong 
 And to meek or strong 
 It is known, just scream it from the wall 

 I've willed, I've walked, I've read 
 I've talked, I know, I know 
 I've been here before 

 Hey, now we won't be raped 
 Hey, now we won't be scarred like that 
 Hey, now we won't be raped 
 Hey, now we won't be scarred like that 

 It's the sun that burns 
 It's the wheel that turns 
 It's the way we sing that makes 'em dream 

 And to christ a cross 
 And to me a chair 
 I will sit and earn the ransom from up here 
 
 I've willed, I've walked, I've read 
 I've talked, I know, I know 
 I've been here before 

 Hey, now we won't be raped 
 Hey, now we won't be scarred like that 
 Hey, now we won't be raped 
 Hey, now we won't be scarred like that 

 And to love a god 
 And to fear a flame 
 And to burn a love that has a name 


 "Quicksand Jesus"
 by Skid Row

 She caught the melting sky.
 It burned but still the winter passes by and by to the other side
 A slow parade of wind that blows through trees that wilted
 With the season's children
 Are we saved by the words of bastard saints? Do we live in fear or faith
 Tell me now who's behind the rain

 A maze of tangled grace
 The symptoms of "for real" are crumbling from embrace
 But still we chase...the shadows of belief
 And new religion clouds our visions of the roots of our souls

 Are we ashamed of our own fate
 Or play the fool for our own sake
 Tell me who's behind the rain

 What do we need where do we go when we get where we don't know
 Why should we doubt the virgin white of fallen snow
 When faith's our shelter from the cold

 Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away without you
 Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away without you
 Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away...away
 Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away

 Quicksand Jesus I need you
 Quicksand Jesus I believe you
 Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away


 "Landslide"
 by Fleetwood Mac

 I took my love, I took it down
 Climbed a mountain and I turned around
 I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
 'Till the landslide brought me down

 Oh, mirror in the sky
 What is love
 Can the child within my heart rise above
 Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
 Can I handle the seasons of my life
 
 Mmm mmm... I don't know
 
 Well, I've been afraid of changing
 'Cause I've built my life around you
 But time makes you bolder
 Even children get older
 And I'm getting older too
 
 Oh, take my love, take it down
 Climb a mountain and turn around
 If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
 Well the landslide will bring it down

 If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
 Well the landslide will bring it down 
 

 "Nothin' But a Good Time"
 by Poison

 Now Listen
 Not a dime, I can't pay my rent
 I can barely make it through the week
 Saturday night I'd like to make my girl
 But right now I can't make ends meet

 I'm always workin' slavin' every day
 Gotta get away from that same old same old
 I need a chance just to get away
 If you could hear me think this is what I'd say

 Chorus:
 Don't need nothin' but a good time
 How can I resist
 Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
 And it don't get better than this

 They say I spend my money on women and wine
 But I couldn't tell you where I spent last night
 I'm really sorry about the shape I'm in
 I just like my fun every now and then

 I'm always workin' slavin' every day
 Gotta get away from that same old same old
 I need a chance just to get away
 If you could hear me think this is what I'd say

 Chorus

 You see I raise a toast to all of us
 Who are breakin' our backs every day
 If wantin' the good life is such a crime
 Lord, then put me away
 Here's to ya

 Solo

 Chorus (3x's)


 "Here and Now"
 by Letters to Cleo

 Just living on a Sunday morning, got my toast and tea and I'm warm and
 I just thought I'd think about
 All the things to get and keep getting never enough and never ending
 I just thought I'd think about
 And it might be...

 (all 2x)
 The comfort of knowledge of a rise above the sky above could never parallel
     the challenge of an acquisition in the here and now

 Parody of yourself in color, giving it to everybody but your mother
 And you've got much to think about
 Soaring higher with every treason
 Never justify, never reason
 You've got much to think about
 And it might be...

 CHORUS: 3x


 "The Goodbye Look"
 by Donald Fagen

 The surf was easy on the day I came to stay
 On this quiet island in the bay
 I remember a line of women all in white
 The laughter and the steel bands at night

 Now the Americans are gone exept for two
 The embassy's been hard to reach
 There's been talk and lately a bit of action after dark
 Behind the big casino on the beach

 The rules are changed
 It's not the same
 It's all new players in a whole new ball game
 
 Last night I dreamed of an old lover dressed in gray
 I've had this fever now since yesterday
 Wake up darling they're knocking the Colonel's standing in the sun
 With his stupid face the glasses and the gun

 I know what happens
 I read the book
 I believe I just got the goodbye look
 
 Won't you pour me a Cuban breeze Gretchen ?

 I know a fellow with a motor launch for hire
 A skinny man with two-tone shoes
 Cause tonight they're arranging a small reception just for me
 Behind the big casino by the sea
 
 I know what happens
 I read the book
 I believe I just got the goodbye look

 "Lost"

 Lost is all I will be.
 You are all I will be.
 Wasted.
 Broken.
 Promise.
 Silent.
 Lies.


 "Control"

 So much of you is me
 I don't know just who I am.
 Now I just can't believe in myself or in anything.
 and this is what you take from me
 and this is what you take from me
 and this is what you take from me
 and this is what you take from me
 I gave you my soul
 I gave you control of me.
 Now I just can't believe in myself or in anything.
 and this is what you take from me
 and this is what you take from me
 and this is what you take from me
 and this is what you take from me
 can't you just believe
 you are my everything
 and this is what you take from mE


 "Nothing"

 Some nights I feel like I have died
 or something deep inside is dying.
 I try to understand my crimes
 but there's nothing that really matters
 don't want to believe in you
 I can't believe in you
 I don't want it i don't need it
 I don't want it but i can't stop myself
 now endless questions fill my head
 some nights I'm frightened by the answers
 no you can't hurt me nothings real
 no pain you cause can last forever
 I don't want to believe in you i can't believe in you
 I don't want it i don't need it
 I don't want it but i can't stop myself
 one night I swore I'd die for you
 there's nothing else I'd rather die for
 but I'll try to live another night
 there's too much hate to be forgotten
 I don't want to believe in you
 I can't believe in you
 I don't want it I don't need it
 I don't want it but I can't stop myself.


 "ACF"

 You are all I am
 you are all I ever want to be
 I think of you
 a solitary cry echoes through my throat
 and through my mind
 I think of you
 I think I woke up screaming
 I had a dream that you still loved me
 I think I woke up screaming
 I think I woke up screaming again
 for hours I'll just stare
 at my ceiling at nothing at all
 and think of you
 the candlelight through bells
 make shadows just like roses in my mind
 and I think of you
 I think I woke up screaming
 I had a dream that you still loved me
 I think i woke up screaming
 I think I woke up screaming again
 could this last forever or will I die
 just can I die
 maybe I could try to take a bath or drink a little wine
 and think of you
 but probably I'll lie naked on the floor by candlelight
 and I'll think of you
 I think I woke up screming
 I had a dream that you still loved me
 I think I woke up screaming again


 "Lies"

 Your soul a pit of stone,
 the depths i wish i could have known.
 Dangerous black and full of spite
 thoughts of you fill my night.
 But now we lay naked on the floor.
 I'm lost. I'm drowning in you soul.
 i was searching for some answer in your eyes
 i find malicious laughter and a love that has died
 you are haunting my reality
 your lies are the only truth that i believe.
 you are haunting my reality
 now evey time i think about you i die
 hatred runs through me marrow deep
 i long to tear your eyes out in your sleep.
 this passion can lead to evil crimes.
 do i kill you or do i choose to die.
 acid burn etched through my brain.
 someone dies before i go insane.
 i was searching for some answer in you eyes
 i found malicious laughter and a love that has died
 you are haunting my reality
 your lies are the only truth that i believe
 you are haunting my reality
 now every time i think about you i die
 Lies
 soon know you'll be gone
 i wish to god i could have known.
 i love you i hate you every night
 this longing for your soul has got me scared.
 but now we lay naked on the floor
 i'm lost
 i'm drowning in your soul.
 i was searching for some answer in your eyes
 i find malicious laughter
 hate and lies
 fucking lies
 you are haunting my reality
 your lies are the only truth that
 i believe
 you are haunting my reality
 now everytime i die
 Lies


 "Ungod"

 You don't understand this I think you never did.
 Silently i search for a reason to exist.
 I found a way to feel you
 I feel so fucking old
 You're burning up inside me
 I feel so fucking cold
 You are clutched tight in my fingers.
 you caress my skin so light.
 You are welling up inside me
 you have finally freed yourself
 You are flowing cross my pale skin
 you are running down my arm
 You are salty as I taste you
 I have finally made you warm
 You stare at me so silent
 you stare at me so cold
 I think you stare right through me
 that stare has made me old
 I've found a way to feel you
 I feel so fucking old
 You're burning up inside me
 I feel so fucking cold
 You are cluthched tight in my fingers
 you caress my skin so light
 You are welling up inside me
 you have finally freed yourself
 You are flowing cross my pale skin
 you are running down my arm
 You are salty as i taste you
 i have finally made you warm
 Take this as an offering
 take this as a sign
 Take this as an offering
 how much can you take from
 how much can you take from me.
 I sink into this darkness
 i sink into this cold
 this emptiness is calling
 I've nothing left to lose.
 I've found a way to kill you
 I feel so fucking cold
 You're burning up inside me
 i feel so fucking old
 You are clutched tight in my fingers
 you caress my skin so light.
 You were welling up inside me
 you have finally freed yourself
 You are flowing cross my pale skin
 you are running down my arm
 You are salty as I taste you
 i have finally made you warm.
 Take this as an offering
 take this as a sign
 Take this as an offering
 How much can you take from
 Take this as an offering
 take this as a sign
 Take this as an offering
 How much can you take from
 How much can you take from me.


 "Throw"

 The night is cold as i wander through these streets
 the air is thick with hints of coming rain
 your face flashes through my head i swallow pain.
 so this is what it feels like to be betrayed
 this is what it looks like
 this is what it feels like
 this is what it tastes like
 this is what you've done to me
 this is what it looks like
 this is what it feels like
 this is what it tastes like when
 You throw this all away
 silent
 You throw this all away
 laughing
 You throw this all away.
 the lake is rough as i sit quietly
 remembering how are life used to be
 an angry vacant silence fills my head
 now all the empty promises are dead
 this is what it looks like
 this is what it feels like
 this is what it tastes like
 this is what you've done to me
 this is what it looks like
 this is what it feels like
 this is what it tastes like when
 You throw this all away
 silent
 You throw this all away
 laughing
 You throw this all away
 the night is old the sky is gray the
 tears roll off my face die in the rain
 an angry vacant silence fills my head
 now all the empty promises are dead
 this is what it looks like
 this is what it feels like
 this is what it tastes like
 this is what you've done to me
 this is what it looks like
 this is what it feels like
 this is what it tastes like when
 You throw this all away
 silent
 you throw this all away
 laughing
 You throw this all away
 You throw this all away
 silent
 You throw this all away
 laughing
 You throw this all away


 "Violent Mood Swings"

 You've left me with nothing left but questions
 You've left me here not knowing who i am
 You've left me so much fucking time to hate you
 You left me with no choice but to die
 Violent mood swings
 Your voice whispers nearly all the time now
 Reminding me just how worthless i am
 Sometimes i just here you laugh forever
 I want you the fuck out of my head
 Violent mood swings
 You're inside my pain inside my sorrow
 I'd die for one last moment inside you
 I miss you so fucking bad i am you
 Whose god will fucking save me now
 Violent mood swings


 "Red on White"

 Now I'm so tired of working this out.
 Going to give myself up...
 up to the truth of what this is,
 of what I am.
 Take from me all of my blood.
 Take from me all of my head.
 This is the best thing I can do.
 Why is it me instead of you?
 I come down.
 Now this is real.
 I can't go back.
 Caught up with everything here tonight.
 Going to fuck myself up.
 Going to throw myself away.
 Going to give this to you...
 give you what I've become.
 First red on white,
 then red on red.
 I left my soul back in my bed.
 This is the best thing I can do
 Why is it me instead of you?
 I come down.


 "Can't Happen Here"

 Last night I tripped in violent shades of green.
 A thousand voiceless faces were chasing me.
 I ran through the air as thick as glue
 from a thousand fucking faces that all look like you.
 Through night as black as hate my spirit fled
 through branches filled with thorns.
 My eyes bled and bled.
 How could I ever hope to win this race
 when everytime I close my eyes I see your face?
 It just can't happen here.


 "The Trick Is To Keep Breathing"
 by Garbage

 She's not the kind of girl
 Who likes to tell the world
 About the way she feels about herself

 She takes a little time
 In making up her mind
 She doesn't want to fight against the tide

 And lately I'm not the only one I say
 Never trust anyone
 Always the one who has to drag her down
 Maybe you'll get what you want this time around

 Can't bear to face the truth
 So sick you can not move
 And when it hurts he takes it out on you

 And lately I'm not the only one I say
 Never trust anyone
 Always the one who has to drag her down
 Maybe you'll get what you want this time around

 The trick is to keep breathing
 The trick is to keep breathing

 She knows the human heart
 And how to read the stars
 Now everything's about to fall apart

 I won't be the one who's going to let you down
 Maybe you'll get what you want this time around

 The trick is to keep breathing (rpt. 7 times)


 "Medication"
 by Spiritualized

 Every day when I wake up
 And I take my medication
 And I space the rest of the day
 Waiting for it to wear off
 Every night I stay up late
 And make my state more desperate
 Spend the rest of the night
 Waiting for it to wear off
 
 I'm waiting for a time
 When I can be without
 The things that make me feel
 This way all of the time
 
 Every now and then
 I get an urge to drive around
 Get into my car
 And then I'll maybe go up town
 Take my medication
 Do my best to get it on
 Spend the rest of the night
 Waiting for it to wear off
 
 I'm waiting for a time
 When I can be without
 The things that make me feel
 This way all of the time
 
 Every time I say this
 I just know this time I mean it
 But a feeling deep inside
 Says "it's OK one more time"

 I'm waiting for a time
 When I can be without
 The things that make me feel
 This way all of the time
 
 Makes me feel so good
 Makes me feel so fine
 Makes me feel so good
 Leaves me fucked up inside

 Medicate my days
 Medicate my nights
 Medicate my life
 Don't it feel alright
 Don't it feel so good
 Lord don't it feel just fine

 Don't it feel so good
 Don't it feel so fine
 Don't it feel so good
 Leaves me fucked up inside


 "Love Song"
 by Madonna

 Je suis prete. Est-ce que vous etes pret, aussi?

 Are you wasting my time, are you just being kind
 Oh no baby my love isn't blind 
 Are you wasting my time, are you just being kind 
 Don't go givin' me one of your lines 
 Say what you mean, mean what you say 
 Don't go and throw our love away 
 God strike me dead if I did you wrong 
 This is not a love song

 Are you just being kind
 Am I losing my mind 

 Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
 And those who run seem to have all the fun 
 But are you wasting my time -- she's so fine 
 Are you just being kind 

 Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
 That's how I feel, don't fog my mind 
 Mean what you say or baby I am gone 
 This is not a love song 

 Are you just being kind
 Am I losing my mind 

 Love song, love song

 Don't try to tell me what your enemies taught you
 I'm gone but I just want you to know 
 That this is not a love song that I want to sing 


 "Walk"
 by Pantera

 Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence
 One step from lashing out at you
 You want in to let under my skin
 And call yourself a friend
 I've got more friends like you
 What do I do?

 Pre-chorus:
 Is there no standard anymore?
 What it takes
 Who I am
 Where I've been
 Belong
 You can't be something you're not
 Be yourself
 By yourself
 Stay away from me
 A lesson learned in life
 Known from the dawn of time

 Chorus:
 Re
 Spect
 Walk

 Run your mouth when I'm not around
 It's easy to achieve
 You cry to weak friends that sympathize
 Can't you hear the violins playing your song?
 Those friends tell me your every word

 Pre-chorus
 Chorus

 Are you talking to me?
 No way punk


 "18 and Life"
 by Skid Row

 Ricky was a young boy, He had a heart of stone.
 Lived 9 to 5 and worked his fingers to the bone.
 Just barely got out of school, came from the edge of town.
 Fought like a switchblade so no one could take him down.
 He had no money, oooh no good at home.
 He walked the streets a soldier and he fought the world alone
 And now it's

 18 and life You got it
 18 and life you know
 Your crime is time and it's
 18 and life to go
 (repeat above)

 Tequila in his heartbeat, His veins burned gasoline.
 It kept his motor running but it never kept him clean.
 They say he loved adventure, "Ricky's the wild one."
 He married trouble and had a courtship with a gun.
 Bang Bang Shoot 'em up, The party never ends.
 You can't think of dying when the bottle's your best friend
 And now it's

 chorus

 "Accidents will happen" they all heard Ricky say
 He fired his six-shot to the wind that blew a child away.

 "Ol' Man Sam"
 by Spiderbait

 Johnny was a man
 A bad, bad man
 Badder he was
 Than Ol' Man Sam
 
 We're all having fun child
 Smoking the ganja
 We can't find the plunger
 So we may have to run-ja
 We may have to run-ja!

 I saw the Peter Tosh
 And he was sloshed
 I saw the Peter Tosh
 And he was sloshed he was sloshed
 He was so much off his face

 Jabba was big and fat
 But don't tell him that
 He ate a cat he ate a rat
 And then he ate, then he ate,
 Then he ate a cricket bat

 Oh reggie rolla, reggie rolla, reggie rolla, reggie rolla
 Reggie reggie rolla, reggie rolla, reggie rolla, reggie rolla
 
 Now it's time for us to go
 So don't be slow
 It's time for us to go
 So don't be slow don't be slow,
 Don't you be slow!
 

 "When The Levee Breaks"
 by Led Zeppelin

 If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break,
 If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break,
 When The Levee Breaks I'll have no place to stay.

 Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan,
 Lord, mean old levee taught me to weep and moan,
 Got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home,
 Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well.

 Don't it make you feel bad
 When you're tryin' to find your way home,
 You don't know which way to go?
 If you're goin' down South
 They go no work to do,
 If you don't know about Chicago.

 Cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good,
 Now, cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good,
 When the levee breaks, mama, you got to move.

 All last night sat on the levee and moaned,
 All last night sat on the levee and moaned,
 Thinkin' 'bout me baby and my happy home.

 Going, go'n' to Chicago,
 Go'n' to Chicago,
 Sorry but I can't take you.
 Going down, going down now, going down.


 "Book of Liars"
 by Walter Becker

 bye and bye now
 we'll get over
 the things we've done and the things we said
 but not just now when
 i can't remember
 exactly what it was i thought we had
 cause i waited so long girl and i came so far
 to find out you're not always who you say you are
 
 and there's a star in the book of liars by your name
 
 santa claus came in late last night
 drunk on christmas wine
 fell down hard in the driveway
 hung his bag out on the laundry line
 there's a cobra gunship for his golden boy
 and there's a hello kitty for his pride and joy
 
 and a silver star in the book of liars by your name
 they hung a star in the book of liars by your name
 
 stars imploding
 the long night passing
 electrons dancing in the frozen crystal dawn
 here's one left stranded at the zero crossing
 with a hole in it's half-life left to carry on
 but now the world's much larger than it looks today
 and if my bad luck ever blows me back this way
 
 then i just look in my book of liars for your name
 

 "Hurt"
 by Nine Inch Nails

 i hurt myself today
 to see if i still feel
 i focus on the pain
 the only thing that's real
 the needle tears a hole
 the old familiar sting
 try to kill it all away
 but i remember everything

 what have i become?
 my sweetest friend
 everyone i know
 goes away in the end

 you could have it all
 my empire of dirt
 i will let you down
 i will make you hurt

 i wear my crown of shit
 on my liar's chair
 full of broken thoughts
 i cannot repair
 beneath the stain of time
 the feeling disappears
 you are someone else
 i am still right here

 what have i become?
 my sweetest friend
 everyone i know
 goes away in the end

 you could have it all
 my empire of dirt
 i will let you down
 i will make you hurt

 if i could start again
 a million miles away
 i would keep myself
 i would find a way


 "The King of Carrot Flowers, Part One"
 by Neutral Milk Hotel

 When you were young
 You were the king of carrot flowers
 And how you built a tower tumbling through the trees
 In holy rattlesnakes that fell all around your feet

 And your mom would stick a fork right into daddy's shoulder
 And your dad would throw the garbage all across the floor
 As we would lay and learn what each other's bodies were for

 And this is the room
 One afternoon I knew I could love you
 And from above you how I sank into your soul
 Into that secret place where no one dares to go

 And your mom would sink until she was no longer speaking
 And dad would dream of all the different ways to die
 Each one a little more than he could dare to try
 

 "Something's Wrong"
 by K's Choice

 When your pubic hair's on fire, something's wrong
 When you think you're the Messiah, something's wrong
 When you mistake a plane for Venus, something's wrong
 When your girlfriend's got a penis

 Something's wrong...
 Something's wrong...
 Something's wrong...
 Something's wrong...

 When you like music more than life, something's wrong
 When you start sleeping as you drive, something's wrong
 When you're favorite drink is thinner, something's wrong
 When you're proud to be a sinner

 Something's wrong...
 Something's wrong...
 Something's wrong...
 Something's wrong...

 When a canary drives a tractor, something's wrong
 When your president's an actor, something's wrong
 When your jacket's plagued with dandruff, something's wrong
 If you think that this song matters

 Something's wrong...
 Something's wrong...
 Something's wrong...
 Something's wrong...

 Something's wrong...
 Something's wrong...
 Something's wrong...
 Something's wrong...
 Something's wrong...

 "Judy and the Dream of Horses"
 by Belle & Sebastian

 judy wrote the saddest song
 she showed it to a boy in school today
 judy, where did you go wrong
 you used to make me smile when i was down
 judy was a teenage rebel
 she did it with a boy when she was young
 she gave herself to books and learning
 she gave herself to being number one
 judy, i dont know you if you're gonna show me everything

 judy got a book at school
 she went under the covers with her torch
 she fell asleep till it was morning
 she dreamt about the girl who stole a horse
 judy never felt so good except when she was sleeping
 
 judy, let's go for a walk
 we can kiss and do whatever you want
 but you will be disappointed
 you will fall asleep with ants in your pants
 judy, you're just trying to find and keep the dream of horses
 and the song she wrote was 'judy and the dream of horses'
 dream of horses
 you dream of horses

 the best looking boys are taken
 the best looking girls are staying inside
 so judy, where does that leave you?
 walking thes treet from morning till night
 with a star upon your shoulder, lighting up the path that you walk
 with a parrot on your shoulder, saying everything when you talk
 if you're ever feeling blue
 then write another song about your dream of horses
 call it 'judy and the dream of horses'
 you dream of horses


 "Crash Into Me"
 by Dave Matthews Band

 You've got your ball
 you've got your chain
 tied to me tight tie me up again
 who's got their claws
 in you my friend
 Into your heart I'll beat again
 Sweet like candy to my soul
 Sweet you rock
 and sweet you roll
 Lost for you I'm so lost for you 
 
 You come crash into me
 And I come into you
 I come into you
 In a boys dream
 In a boys dream
 
 Touch your lips just so I know
 In your eyes, love, it glows so
 I'm bare boned and crazy for you
 When you come crash
 into me, baby
 And I come into you
 In a boys dream
 In a boys dream
 
 If I've gone overboard
 Then I'm begging you
 to forgive me
 in my haste
 When I'm holding you so girl
 close to me
 
 Oh and you come crash
 into me, baby
 And I come into you
 Hike up your skirt a little more
 and show the world to me
 Hike up your skirt a little more
 and show your world to me
 In a boys dream.. In a boys dream
 
 Oh I watch you there
 through the window
 And I stare at you
 You wear nothing but you
 wear it so well
 tied up and twisted
 the way i'd like to be
 For you, for me, come crash 
 into me


 "The Things You Said"
 by Depeche Mode

 I heard it from my friends
 About the things you said
 I heard it from my friends
 About the things you said
 But they know me better than that
 They know me better than that
 They know my weaknesses
 I never tried to hide them
 They know my weaknesses
 I never denied them

 I heard it from my friends
 About the things you said
 I heard it from my friends
 About the things you said
 How can a view become so twisted
 How can a view become so twisted
 They know my weaknesses
 I never tried to hide them
 They know my weaknesses
 You tried them

 I get so carried away
 You brought me down to earth
 I thought we had something precious
 Now I know what it's worth

 I heard it from my friends
 About the things you said
 I heard it from my friends
 About the things you said
 I've never felt so disappointed
 Never felt so disappointed
 They know my weaknesses
 I never tried to hide them
 They know my weaknesses
 Thought that you liked them

 They know me better than that


 "Kind and Generous"
 by Natalie Merchant

 La-la-la-la...

 You've been so kind and generous
 I don't know how you keep on giving
 For your kindness, I'm in debt to you
 For your selflessness, my admiration
 For everything you've done, you know
 I'm bound I'm bound to thank you for it

 La-la-la-la...

 You've been so kind and generous
 I don't know how you keep on giving
 For your kindness, I'm in debt to you
 And I never could have come, this far without you
 For everything you've done, you know
 I'm bound I'm bound to thank you for it

 La-la-la-la...

 Oh, I want to thank you for so many gifts you gave
 The love, the tenderness, I wanna thank you
 I want to thank you for your generosity, the love
 And the honesty that you gave me
 I want to thank you show my gratitude
 My love, and my respect for you,
 I want to thank you
 Oh, I want to thank you, thank you; thank you, thank you
 I want to thank you, thank you; thank you, thank you


 "Joyce's Hut"
 by Spiderbait

 Drifting sideways is what I like on a Monday
 Sinking quiet and thinking (something)
 Drown the (??) (something) fools (??) (something)
 
 I can see what I see (something)
 
 Boldy surfing I want no fighting in my car (??)
 Tinsel's with her (??) and (something) too far
 (something) you are (??)
 (something) for a few months (??)
 
 
 "You Oughta Know"
 by Alanis Morrisette

 I want you to know that I'm happy for you 
 I wish nothing but the best for you both 
 An older version of me 
 Is she perverted like me 
 Would she go down on you in a theater? 
 Does she speak eloquently 
 And would she have your baby 
 I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother 
 
 Cause the love that you gave that we made 
 Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no 
 And every time you speak her name 
 Does she know how you told me you'd hold me 
 Until you died, 'til you died 
 But you're still alive 
 
 And I'm here to remind you 
 Of the mess you left when you went away 
 It's not fair to deny me 
 Of the cross I bear that you gave to me 
 You, you, you oughta know 

 You seem very well, things look peaceful 
 I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
 Did you forget about me, Mr. Duplicity 
 I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner 
 It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced 
 Are you thinking of me when you fuck her 
 
 Cause the love that you gave that we made 
 Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no 
 And every time you speak her name 
 Does she know how you told me you'd hold me 
 Until you died, 'til you died 
 But you're still alive 
 
 And I'm here to remind you 
 Of the mess you left when you went away
 It's not fair to deny me 
 Of the cross I bear that you gave to me 
 You, you, you oughta know 
 
 Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me 
 And I'm not going to fade as soon as you close your eyes, and you know it 
 And everytime I scratch my nails down someone else's back 
 I hope you feel it ... well can you feel it? 
 
 And I'm here to remind you 
 Of the mess you left when you went away 
 It's not fair to deny me 
 Of the cross I bear that you gave to me 
 You, you, you oughta know 


 "I Alone"
 by Live

 It's easier not to be wise 
 And measure these things by your brains
 I sank into eden with you 
 Alone in the church by and by 
 
 I'll read to you here, save your eyes 
 You'll need them, your boat is at sea 
 Your anchor is up, you've been swept away 
 And the greatest of teachers won't hesitate 
 
 I alone love you 
 I alone tempt you 
 I alone love you 
 Fear is not the end of this! 
 
 It's easier not to be great
 And measure these things by your eyes 
 We long to be here by his resolve 
 Alone in the church by and by 
 To cradle the baby in space 
 And leave you there by yourself, chained to fate 
 
 I alone love you 
 I alone tempt you 
 I alone love you 
 Fear is not the end of this! 
 
 Oh, now, we took it back too far 
 Only love can save us now 
 All these riddles that you burn 
 All come runnin' back to you 
 All these rhythms that you hide 
 Only love can save us now 
 All these riddles that you burn 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 

 I alone love you 
 I alone tempt you 
 I alone love you 
 Fear is not the end of this! 


 Album: Metropolis Part II: Scenes From A Memory
 by Dream Theater
 

 ACT I
 Scene One: Regression

 [Present]

 [The Hypnotherapist:]
 "Close your eyes and begin to relax.
 Take a deep breath, and let it out slowly.
 Concentrate on your breathing.
 With each breath you become more relaxed.
 Imagine a brilliant white light above you,
 focusing on this light as it flows through your body.
 Allow yourself to drift off as you fall deeper and deeper
 into a more relaxed state of mind.
 Now as I count back from ten to one,
 you will feel more peaceful, and calm.
 Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six.
 You will enter a safe place where nothing can harm you.
 Five. Four. Three. Two.
 If at any time you need to come back, all you must do is open your eyes.
 One."

 [Nicholas:]
 Safe in the light that surrounds me
 Free of the fear and the pain
 My subconscious mind
 Starts spinning through time
 To rejoin the past once again
 Nothing seems real
 I'm starting to feel
 Lost in the haze of a dream
 And as I draw near
 The scene becomes clear
 Like watching my life on a screen

 Hello Victoria so glad to see you
 My friend.


 Scene Two: I. Overture 1928 (instrumental)


 Scene Two: II. Strange Deja Vu

 [Present]

 [Nicholas:]
 Subconscious Strange Sensation
 Unconscious relaxation
 What a pleasant nightmare
 And I can't wait to get there again
 Every time I close my eyes
 There's another vivid surprise
 Another whole life waiting
 Chapters unfinished, fading

 [Past]

 Closer now- Slowly coming into view
 I've arrived- Blinding sunshine beaming through

 There's a house I'm drawn to
 Familiar settings nothing new
 And there's a pathway leading there
 With a haunting chill in the air
 There's a room at the top of the stairs
 Every night I'm drawn up there
 And there's a girl in the mirror
 Her face is getting clearer
 Young child won't you tell me why I'm here?

 In her eyes- I sense a story never told
 Behind the disguise- There's something tearing
 At her soul...

 [Victoria:]
 Tonight I've been searching for it
 A feeling that's deep inside me
 Tonight I've been searching for
 The one that nobody knows
 Trying to break free

 I just can't help myself
 I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head
 Tears my heart into two
 I'm not the one the sleeper thought he knew

 [Present]

 [Nicholas:]
 Back on my feet again
 Eyes open to the real world
 Metropolis surrounds me
 The mirror's shattered the girl
 Why is this other life
 Haunting me every day
 I'd break through to the other side
 If only I'd find the way

 Something's awfully familiar
 The feeling's so hard to shake
 Could I have lived in that other world
 It's a link that I'm destined to make

 I'm still searching but I don't know what for
 The missing key to unlock my mind's door

 Today I am searching for it
 A feeling that won't go away
 Today I am searching for
 The only one I know
 Trying to break free

 I just can't help myself
 I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head
 Tears my soul into two
 I'm not the one I thought I always knew

 I just can't help myself
 I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head
 Uncanny, Strange Deja Vu
 But I don't mind- I hope to find the truth


 Scene Three: I. Through My Words

 [Present]

 [Nicholas:]
 All your eyes have ever seen
 All you've ever heard
 Is etched upon my memory
 Is spoken through my words
 All that I take with me
 Is all you've left behind
 We're sharing one eternity
 Living in two minds
 Linked by an endless thread
 Impossible to break


 Scene Three: II. Fatal Tragedy

 [Present]

 [Nicholas:]
 Alone at night
 I feel so strange
 I need to find
 All the answers to my dreams
 When I sleep at night
 I hear the cries
 What does this mean?

 I shut the door and traveled to another home
 I met an older man, he seemed to be alone
 I felt that I could trust him
 He talked to me that night;
 "Lad did you know a girl was murdered here?"
 "This fatal tragedy was talked about for years"
 Victoria's gone forever
 Only memories remain
 She passed away
 She was so young

 Without love
 Without truth
 There can be no turning back
 Without faith
 Without hope
 There can be no peace of mind

 As the night went on
 I started to find my way
 I learned about a tragedy
 A mystery still today

 I tried to get more answers
 But he said, "You're on your own."
 Then he turned away and left me
 As I stand there all alone
 He said, "You'll know the truth
 As your future days unfold...unfold"

 Without love
 Without truth
 There can be no turning back
 Without faith
 Without hope
 There can be no peace of mind

 [The Hypnotherapist:]
 "Now it is time to see how you died.
 Remember that death is not the end, but only a transition."


 Scene Four: Beyond This Life

 [Past]

 Headline: "Murder, young girl killed
 Desperate shooting at Echo's Hill
 Dreadful ending, killer died
 Evidently suicide."

 A witness heard a horrifying sound
 He ran to find a woman dead and
 Lying on the ground

 Standing by her was a man
 Nervous, shaking, gun in hand
 Witness says he tried to help
 But he'd turned the weapon on himself

 His body fell across that poor young girl
 After shouting out in vain
 The witness ran to call for assistance
 A sad close to a broken love affair

 Our deeds have traveled far
 What we have been is what we are
 Our deeds have traveled far
 What we have been is what we are

 She wanted love forever
 But he had another plan
 He fell into an evil way
 She had to let him down
 She said, "I can't love a wayward man."

 She may have found a reason to forgive
 If he had only tried to change
 Was their fatal meeting prearranged?

 Had a violent struggle taken place?
 There was every sign that lead there
 Witness found a switchblade on the ground
 Was the victim unaware?
 They continued to investigate
 They found a note in the killer's pocket
 It could have been a suicide letter
 Maybe he had lost her love

 I feel there's only one thing left to do
 I'd sooner take my life away
 Than live with losing you

 Our deeds have traveled far
 What we have been is what we are
 Our deeds have traveled far
 What we have been is what we are

 All that we learn this time
 (What we have been is what we are)
 Is carried beyond this life
 All that we learn this time
 (What we have been is what we are)
 Is carried beyond this life

 Our deeds have traveled far
 What we have been is what we are
 Our deeds have traveled far
 What we have been is what we are

 All that we learn this time
 (What we have been is what we are)
 Is carried beyond this life
 All that we learn this time
 (What we have been is what we are)
 Is carried beyond this life


 Scene Five: Through Her Eyes

 [Present]

 [Nicholas:]
 She never really had a chance
 On that fateful moonlit night
 Sacrificed without a fight
 A victim of her circumstance

 Now that I've become aware
 And I've exposed this tragedy
 A sadness grows inside of me
 It all seems so unfair

 I'm learning all about my life
 By looking through her eyes

 Just beyond the churchyard gates
 Where the grass is overgrown
 I saw the writing on her stone
 I felt like I would suffocate

 In loving memory of our child
 So innocent, eyes open wide
 I felt so empty as I cried
 Like part of me had died

 I'm learning all about my life
 By looking through her eyes

 And as her image
 Wandered through my head
 I wept just like a baby
 As I lay awake in bed
 And I know what it's like
 To lose someone you love
 And this felt just the same

 She wasn't given any choice
 Desperation stole her voice
 I've been given so much more in life
 I've got a son, I've got a wife
 I had to suffer one last time
 To grieve for her and say goodbye
 Relive the anguish of my past
 To find out who I was at last

 The door has opened wide
 I'm turning with the tide
 Looking through her eyes


 ACT II


 Scene Six: Home

 [Past]

 [The Sleeper:]
 Shine- lake of fire
 Lines take me higher
 My mind drips desire
 Confined and overtired

 Living this charade
 Is getting me nowhere
 I can't shake this charade
 The city's cold blood calls me home...

 Home...
 It's what I long for
 Back home...
 where I belong

 The city- it calls to me
 Decadent scenes from my memory
 Sorrow- eternity
 My demons are coming to drown me
 Help- I'm falling, I'm crawling
 I can't keep away from its clutch
 Can't have it, this habit
 It's calling me back to my home

 [The Miracle:]
 I remember the first time she came to me
 She poured out her soul all night and cried...
 I remember I was told there's a new love that's born
 For each one that has died...

 I never thought that I
 Could carry on with this life
 But I can't resist myself
 No matter how hard I try

 Living their other life
 Is getting them nowhere
 I'll make her my wife
 Her sweet temptation calls me home...

 Home...
 It's what I long for
 My home...
 where she belongs

 Her ecstasy- means so much to me
 Even decieving my own blood
 Victoria watches and thoughtfully smiles
 She's taking me to my home

 Help- he's my brother, but I love her
 I can't keep away from her touch
 Deception, dishonor
 It's calling me back to my home

 "...four, four, who wants the hard        [    A craps "stickman" is heard ]
 four?... who wants the hard four?...      [calling out various bets during ]
 ...shooter had one, four...               [ the gambling and sex sequence. ]
 ...one, four...
 one and make it the hard way...
 ...got the shooter...
 ...coming out for a new player...
 take your best shot, gambler...
 ...who wants to come? better hop in...
 place your bets... who wants to come?"

 [Present]

 [Nicholas:]
 Her story- it holds the key
 Unlocking dreams from my memory
 Solving this mystery
 Is everything that is a part of me

 Help- regression, obsession
 I can't keep away from it's clutch
 Leave no doubt, to find out
 It's calling me back to my home


 Scene Seven: I. The Dance Of Eternity (instrumental)


 Scene Seven: II. One Last Time

 [Present]

 [Nicholas:]
 It doesn't make any sense
 This tragic ending
 In spite of the evidence
 There's something still missing

 Heard some of the rumors told
 A taste of one's wealth
 Did Victoria wound his soul?
 Did she bid him farewell?

 [Past]

 [Victoria:]
 One last time
 We'll lay down today
 One last time
 Until we fade away
 One last time
 We'll lay down today
 One last time
 We slowly fade away...
 away

 [Present]

 [Nicholas:]
 Here I am inside his home
 It holds the many clues
 To my suspicions
 And as I'm standing here right now
 I'm finally shown what I have always known

 Coincidence I can't believe
 As my childhood dreams slowly come true

 Are these her memories
 Awakened through my eyes
 This house has brought back to life

 An open door
 I walk on through
 Into his bedroom

 Feeling as cold as outside
 The walls disappear
 To some woman who's screaming
 A man pleads forgiveness
 His words I cannot hear


 Scene Eight: The Spirit Carries On

 [Present]

 [Nicholas:]
 Where did we come from?
 Why are we here?
 Where do we go when we die?
 What lies beyond
 And what lay before?
 Is anything certain in life?

 They say, "Life is too short,"
 "The here and the now"
 And "You're only given one shot"
 But could there be more,
 Have I lived before,
 Or could this be all that we've got?

 If I die tomorrow
 I'd be all right
 Because I believe
 That after we're gone
 The spirit carries on

 I used to be frightened of dying
 I used to think death was the end
 But that was before
 I'm not scared anymore
 I know that my soul will transcend

 I may never find all the answers
 I may never understand why
 I may never prove What
 I know to be true
 But I know that I still have to try

 If I die tomorrow
 I'd be allright
 Because I believe
 That after we're gone
 The spirit carries on

 [Victoria:]
 "Move on, be brave
 Don't weep at my grave
 Because I am no longer here
 But please never let
 Your memory of me disappear"

 [Nicholas:]
 Safe in the light that surrounds me
 Free of the fear and the pain
 My questioning mind
 Has helped me to find
 The meaning in my life again

 Victoria's real
 I finally feel
 At peace with the girl in my dreams
 And now that I'm here
 It's perfectly clear
 I found out what all of this means

 If I die tomorrow
 I'd be allright
 Because I believe
 That after we're gone
 The spirit carries on


 Scene Nine: Finally Free

 [Present]

 [The Hypnotherapist:]
 "You are once again surrounded by a brilliant white light.
 Allow the light to lead you away from your past and into this lifetime.
 As the light dissipates you will slowly fade back into consciousness
 remembering all you have learned.
 When I tell you to open your eyes you will return to the present,
 feeling peaceful and refreshed.
 Open your eyes, Nicholas."

 [Past]

 [The Miracle:]
 Friday evening
 The blood still on my hands
 To think that she would leave me now
 For that ungrateful man

 Sole survivor
 No witness to the crime
 I must act fast to cover up
 I think that there's still time

 He'd seem hopeless and lost with this note
 They'll buy into the words that I wrote

 "This feeling inside me
 Finally found my love,
 I've finally broke free
 No longer torn in two
 I'd take my own life before losing you"

 [Victoria:]
 Feeling good this Friday afternoon
 I ran into Julian
 Said we'd get together soon
 He's always had my heart
 He needs to know
 I'll break free of the Miracle
 It's time for him to go

 This feeling inside me
 Finally found my love,
 I've finally broke free
 No longer torn in two
 He'd kill his brother if he only knew

 Their love renewed
 They'd rendezvous
 In a pathway out of view
 They thought no one knew
 Then came a shot out of the night

 [The Miracle:]
 "Open your eyes, Victoria."                [Towards the end of the shrieks ]
                                            [and gun fire during the fight. ]
 [The Sleeper:]
 One last time
 We'll lay down today
 One last time
 Until we fade away
 One last time
 We'll lay down today
 One last time
 We fade away

 As their bodies lie still
 And the ending draws near
 Spirits rise through the air
 All their fears disappear, it all becomes clear
 A blinding light comes into view
 An old soul exchanged for a new
 A familiar voice comes shining through...

 [Present]

 [Nicholas:]
 This feeling inside me
 Finally found my life, I'm finally free
 No longer torn in two
 I learned about my life by living through you

 This feeling inside me
 Finally found my life, I'm finally free
 No longer torn in two
 Living my own life by learning from you

 We'll meet again my friend someday soon...

 "Sleep Together"
 by Garbage

 I got you crawling up a mountain
 And around my neck
 I got you twisted round my finger
 Crawling round my lips

 The emptiness
 The craziness
 Satisfy this loneliness
 Darling How would it feel?

 CHORUS:
 If we sleep together
 Will you like me better
 If we come together
 We'd go down forever
 If we sleep together
 Will I like you better
 If we come together
 Prove it now or never

 Make me a pretty person and make me
 Feel like I belong
 Make me hard and make me happy
 Make me beautiful

 The emptiness
 The craziness
 Satisfy this loneliness
 Darling How would it feel

 CHORUS

 If we sleep together
 Nothing satisfies me baby
 If we sleep together
 I was something pretty baby
 If we sleep together
 Give me what I crave now baby
 If we sleep together
 Save the rest for later baby
 If we sleep together
 You would drive me crazy baby
 If we sleep together
 I save it all for you my baby
 If we sleep together
 If we sleep together
 If we sleep together


 "Looking for Atlantis"
 by Prefab Sprout

 if you're looking for atlantis
 you should cast your eye on me
 put your two and two together
 dont you know who built atlantis
 and returned it to the sea
 dont you know who owns the weather?
 rain or shine

 sure is good to seek a challenge
 sure is fine to set your sights
 sure is foolish to be blinded
 there are legions out there churchin
 searching for the holy grail
 isn't one of them can find it
 all this time

 you should be loving someone
 and you know who it must be
 cause you'll never find atlantis
 till you make that someone me
 
 say you do find your volcano
 and the darn thing is still hot
 lesson one: child don't waste it
 lesson two: the world's your cherry
 but tomorrow? maybe not
 lesson three: come on and taste it
 all this time

 you should be loving someone
 and you know who it must be
 cause you'll never find atlantis
 till you make that someone me


 "Rush"
 by Depeche Mode

 Walk with me
 Open your sensitive mouth
 And talk to me
 Hold out your delicate hands
 And feel me
 Couldn't make any plans
 To conceal me

 Open your sensitive mouth
 Hold out your delicate hands
 With such a sensitive mouth
 I'm easy to see through

 When I come up
 When I rush
 I rush for you

 Cry for you
 Seen the tears
 Roll down from my eyes for you
 Heard my truth
 Distorting to lies for you
 Watched my love
 Becoming a prize for you

 Seen the tears in my eyes
 Heard my truth turn to lies
 Seen the tears in my eyes
 I'm not proud of what I do

 When I come up
 When I rush
 I rush for you

 I come up to meet you
 Up there somewhere
 When I rush to greet you
 My soul is bared

 Gave more for you
 Dropped my crutches
 And crawled on the floor for you
 Went looking behind every door for you
 And because of the things
 That I saw for you
 I spiritually grew

 When I come up
 When I rush
 I rush for you


 "B & T"
 by Spiderbait

 She thinks she's got a power bat
 But thanks her soul to think about that
 They're waiting for the truth to hit
 And no one wants to deal with it

 She thought so hard she bled all over
 They use weapons to take you over
 Take away your mind for a couple of years
 She takes (something)
 For this heart in grace

 Take you over
 Take you over
 Take me over
 Take you over

 I'm walking down to the top of the city
 You can see your head from the top of the city
 Big and ugly and it looks so pretty
 Good therapy when you're feeling shitty

 I'm walking down to the top of the city
 You can see your head from the top of the city
 Wait for the cold to smash you in the face
 You'll see me in there
 Everything you hate

 Take you over
 Take me over
 Take you over
 Take me over
 

 "The Rollercoaster Ride"
 by Belle & Sebastian

 hey people, looking out the window at the city below
 hey people, looking out the window full of fun and sorrow
 hey people, looking out the window at the city below
 hey people, looking out the window, you'll be gone tomorrow
 
 the rollercoaster ride
 the rollercoaster ride
 of all the trouble kept her inside

 take judy, where her bow and arrow she's a mastermind
 too frumpy for the teenage population of her time
 car coat, she has a quilted jacket with a hood if it rains
 big pocket for the pharmaceuticals she takes to fix her brain
 
 the rollercoaster ride
 the rollercoaster ride
 of all the trouble kept her inside
 
 a puzzle for the moment, settle down to do it with him
 you're happy cause you're cozy and the rain comes rattling in
 it tickles, and it's something that is very good for your skin
 you're waiting for a baby, Baby, watch the idiot running

 you're hanging from the balcony upon the riverboat glass
 you're watching with your mouth wide open for the top of the class
 she came on with the boys while you were stuck in various poses
 if you were to remove your clothes, d'you think the singer would notice?

 
 "Enjoy"
 by Bjork

 I wish: I want to stay here
 I wish: this be enough
 I wish: I only love you
 I wish: simplicity

 Look at the speed out there
 It magnetizes me to it
 And I have no fear
 I'm only into this to
 Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.

 I wish I'd only look
 And didn't have to touch
 I wish I'd only smell this
 And didn't have to taste

 How can I ignore?
 This is sex without touching
 I'm going to explore
 I'm only into this to
 Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.


 "Oh Father"
 by Madonna

 It's funny that way, you can get used 
 To the tears and the pain 
 What a child will believe 

 You never loved me
 You can't hurt me now 
 I got away from you, I never thought I would 
 You can't make me cry, you once had the power 
 I never felt so good about myself 

 Seems like yesterday
 I lay down next to your boots and I prayed 
 For your anger to end 
 Oh father I have sinned 

 Oh father if you never wanted to live that way
 If you never wanted to hurt me 
 Why am I running away 

 Maybe someday
 When I look back I'll be able to say 
 You didn't mean to be cruel 
 Somebody hurt you too 
 

 "Comfortably Numb"
 by Pink Floyd

 Hello?
 Is there anybody in there?
 Just nod if you can hear me.
 Is there anyone at home?
 Come on, now,
 I hear you're feeling down.
 Well I can ease your pain
 Get you on your feet again.
 Relax.
 I'll need some information first.
 Just the basic facts.
 Can you show me where it hurts?
 
 There is no pain you are receding
 A distant ship, smoke on the horizon.
 You are only coming through in waves.
 Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
 When I was a child I had a fever
 My hands felt just like two balloons.
 Now I've got that feeling once again
 I can't explain you would not understand
 This is not how I am.
 I have become comfortably numb.
 
 O.K.
 Just a little pinprick.
 There'll be no more aaaaaaaaah!
 But you may feel a little sick.
 Can you stand up?
 I do believe it's working, good.
 That'll keep you going through the show
 Come on it's time to go.
 
 There is no pain you are receding
 A distant ship, smoke on the horizon.
 You are only coming through in waves.
 Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
 When I was a child 
 I caught a fleeting glimpse
 Out of the corner of my eye.
 I turned to look but it was gone
 I cannot put my finger on it now
 The child is grown, 
 The dream is gone.
 I have become comfortably numb.
 
 
 "Linoleum"
 by NOFX

 Posessions never meant anything to me
 I'm not crazy ('cause I've got none)
 Well that's not true, I've got a bed and a guitar
 And a dog named dog who pisses on my floor
 That's right, I've got a floor

 So what, so what, so what?

 I've got pockets full of kleenex and lint and holes
 Where everything important to me just seems
 To fall right down my leg
 And on the floor
 My closest friend, linoleum

 Linoleum

 Supports my head, gives me something to believe
 That's me on the beachside combing the sand
 Metal meter in my hand
 Sporting a pocket full of change
 That's me on the street with a violin under my chin
 Playing with a grin, singing gibberish

 That's me on the back of the bus
 That's me in the cell
 That's me inside your head
 That's me inside your head


 "Pearl"
 by Babes in Toyland

 Little Pearl she was this girl
 Her thoughts and notions in a whirl
 She was pretty quick
 Found her stick
 Filled it thick with...
 BLACKSUGAR SHIT

 Ole blackglasses
 Spoonful molasses
 Drinking wine
 Killing time
 Burn it black with a candle
 All bent at the handle
 Devil spit makes Pearl sick

 She had a name her name's insane
 A little maid picks away at her brain
 To much disdain her brain remained
 To think thought all axe and maim and...
 BLACKSUGAR SHIT

 I live inside...

 Off with their heads for I'm staying in bed
 I'm sick of that blackbird that shrieks in my head
 Blacksugar shit is shit

 
 "I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues"
 by Elton John

 Don't wish it away
 Don't look at it like it's forever
 Between you and me
 I could honestly say
 That things can only get better

 And while I'm away
 Dust out the demons inside
 And it won't be long before you and me run
 To the place in our hearts where we hide

 And I guess that's why they call it the blues
 Time on my hands could be time spent with you
 Laughing like children, living like lovers
 Rolling like thunder under the covers
 And I guess that's why they call it the blues

 Just stare into space
 Picture my face in your hands
 Live for each second without hesitation
 And never forget I'm your man

 Wait on me girl
 Cry in the night if it helps
 But more than ever
 I simply love you
 More than I love life itself


 "Jasper"
 by Spiderbait

 I was trying to remember
 Why we used to say "Hello"
 Even though I never liked you anyway

 You were always there to shit me
 And you really did annoy me
 Don't invite me to your party Saturday

 I'll go anyway!
 
 Do you miss me are you
 Happy now you don't see me around
 Does it feel like you're the man you are again

 I've been trying to remember
 Why we used to say "Hello"
 Even though it doesn't matter anyway

 I still wanna stay (??)
 

 "Daughter"
 by Pearl Jam

 alone.. listless..
 breakfast table in an otherwise empty room.
 a young girl.. violens..

 "Mama, I'm Coming Home"
 by Ozzy Osbourne

 Times have changed and times are strange
 Here I come, but I ain't the same
 Mama, I'm coming home
 Times gone by seem to be
 You could have been a better friend to me
 Mama, I'm coming home

 You took me in and you drove me out
 Yeah, you had me hypnotized
 Lost and found and turned aroound
 By the fire in your eyes

 You made me cry, you told me lies
 But I can't stand to say goodbye
 Mama, I'm coming home
 I could be right, I could be wrong
 Hurts so bad, it's been so long
 Mama, I'm coming home

 Selfish love yeah we're both alone
 The ride before the fall
 But I'm gonna take this heart of stone
 I just got to have it all

 CHORUS
 I've seen your face a hundred times
 Everyday we've been apart
 I don't care about the sunshine, yeah
 'Cause Mama, Mama, I'm coming home
 I'm coming home

 You took me in and you drove me out
 Yeah, you had me hypnotized
 Lost and found and turned around
 By the fire in your eyes

 CHORUS


 "Hymn 43"
 by Jethro Tull

 Oh father high in heaven -- smile down upon your son
 whose busy with his money games --  his women and his gun.
 Oh Jesus save me!

 And the unsung Western hero killed an Indian or three
 and made his name in Hollywood to set the white man free.
 Oh Jesus save me!

 If Jesus saves -- well, He'd better save Himself
 from the gory glory seekers who use His name in death.
 Oh Jesus save me!

 I saw him in the city and on the mountains of the moon --
 His cross was rather bloody -- He could hardly roll His stone.
 Oh Jesus save me!


 "Pennyroyal Tea"
 by Nirvana

 I'm on my time with everyone
 I have very bad posture

 Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
 Distill the life that's inside of me
 Sit and drink Pennyroyal tea
 I'm anemic royalty

 Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
 So I can sigh eternally

 I'm so tired I can't sleep
 I'm a liar and a thief
 Sit and drink pennyroyal Tea
 I'm anemic royalty

 I'm on warm milk and laxatives
 Cherry-flavored antacids


 "We Care A Lot"
 by Faith No More

 We care a lot about disasters, fires, floods and killer bees
 We care a lot about the NASA shuttle falling in the sea
 We care a lot about starvation and the food that Live Aid bought
 We care a lot about disease, baby Rock, Hudson, rock, yeah!

 We care a lot about the gamblers and the pushers and the geeks
 We care a lot about the crack and smack and whack that hits the street
 We care a lot about the welfare of all the boys and girls
 We care a lot about you people cause we're out to save the world YEAH!

 And it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it

 We care a lot about the army navy air force and marines
 We care a lot about the SF, NY and LAPD
 We care a lot about you people, about your guns
 about the wars you're fighting gee that looks like fun

 We care a lot about the Garbage Pail Kids, they never lie
 We care a lot about Transformers cause there's more than meets the eye
 We care a lot about the little things, the bigger things we top
 We care a lot about you people yeah you bet we care a lot, YEAH!

 Well, its a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
 And it's a dirty song but someone's gotta sing it


 "Subdivisions"
 by Rush

 Sprawling on the fringes of the city
 In geometric order
 An insulated border
 In between the bright lights
 And the far unlit unknown
 
 Growing up it all seems so one-sided
 Opinions all provided
 The future pre-decided
 Detached and subdivided
 In the mass production zone
 Nowhere is the dreamer or the misfit so alone

 Chorus
 (Subdivisions)
 In the high school halls
 In the shopping malls
 Conform or be cast out
 (Subdivisions)
 In the basement bars
 In the backs of cars
 Be cool or be cast out
 Any escape might help to smooth the unattractive truth
 But the suburbs have no charms to soothe the restless dreams of youth

 Drawn like moths we drift into the city
 The timeless old attraction
 Cruising for the action
 Lit up like a firefly
 Just to feel the living night
 
 Some will sell their dreams for small desires
 Or lose the race to rats
 Get caught in ticking traps
 And start to dream of somewhere
 To relax their restless flight
 Somewhere out of a memory of lighted streets on quiet nights...

 Chorus


 "In Your Room"
 by Depeche Mode

 In your room
 Where time stands still
 Or moves at your will
 Will you let the morning come soon
 Or will you leave me lying here
 In your favourite darkness
 Your favourite half-light
 Your favourite consciousness
 Your favourite slave

 In your room
 Where souls disappear
 Only you exist here
 Will you lead me to your armchair
 Or leave me lying here
 Your favourite innocence
 Your favourite prize
 Your favourite smile
 Your favourite slave

 I'm hanging on your words
 living on your breath
 feeling with your skin
 Will I always be here

 In your room
 Your burning eyes
 Cause flames to arise
 Will you let the fire die down soon
 Or will I always be here
 Your favourite passion
 Your favourite game
 Your favourite mirror
 Your favourite slave

 I'm hanging on your words
 living on your breath
 feeling with your skin
 Will I always be here


 "Us and Them"
 by Pink Floyd

 Us, and them 
 And after all we're only ordinary men. 
 Me, and you. 
 God only knows it's noz what we would choose to do. 
 Forward he cried from the rear 
 and the front rank died. 
 And the general sat and the lines on the map 
 moved from side to side. 
 Black and blue 
 And who knows which is which and who is who. 
 Up and down. 
 But in the end it's only round and round. 
 Haven't you heard it's a battle of words 
 The poster bearer cried. 
 Listen son, said the man with the gun 
 There's room for you inside. 

 "I mean, they're not gunna kill ya, so if you give 'em a quick short, 
 sharp, shock, they won't do it again. Dig it? I mean he get off 
 lightly, 'cos I would've given him a thrashing - I only hit him once! 
 It was only a difference of opinion, but really...I mean good manners 
 don't cost nothing do they, eh?" 

 Down and out 
 It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about. 
 With, without. 
 And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about? 
 Out of the way, it's a busy day 
 I've got things on my mind. 
 For the want of the price of tea and a slice 
 The old man died. 
 

 "Promise To Try "
 by Madonna

 Little girl don't you forget her face 
 Laughing away your tears 
 When she was the one who felt all the pain 

 Little girl never forget her eyes
 Keep them alive inside 
 I promise to try -- it's not the same 

 Keep your head held high -- ride like the wind
 Never look behind, life isn't fair 
 That's what you said, so I try not to care 

 Little girl don't run away so fast
 I think you forgot to kiss -- kiss her goodbye 

 Will she see me cry when I stumble and fall
 Does she hear my voice in the night when I call 
 Wipe away all your tears, it's gonna be all right 

 I fought to be so strong, I guess you knew
 I was afraid you'd go away, too 

 Little girl you've got to forget the past
 And learn to forgive me 
 I promise to try -- but it feels like a lie 

 Don't let memory play games with your mind
 She's a faded smile frozen in time 
 I'm still hanging on -- but I'm doing it wrong 

 Can't kiss her goodbye -- but I promise to try


 "Champagne Supernova"
 by Oasis

 How many special people change, how many lives are living strange
 Where were you while we were getting high?
 Slowly walking down the hall, faster than a cannon ball
 Where were you while we were getting high?
 
 Some day you will find me, caught beneath the landslide
 In a champagne supernova in the sky
 Some day you will find me, caught beneath the landslide
 In a champagne supernova, a champagne supernova in the sky
 
 Wake up the dawn and ask her why, a dreamer dreams she never dies
 Wipe that tear away now from your eye
 Slowly walking down the hall, faster than a cannon ball
 Where were you while we were getting high?
 
 Some day you will find me, caught beneath the landslide
 In a champagne supernova in the sky
 Some day you will find me, caught beneath the landslide
 In a champagne supernova, a champagne supernova
 Cos people believe that they're gonna get away for the summer
 But you and I, we live and die, the world's still spinning round
 We don't know why, why, why, why, why
 
 How many special people change, how many lives are living strange
 Where were you while we were getting high?
 Slowly walking down the hall, faster than a cannon ball
 Where were you while we were getting high?
 
 Some day you will find me, caught beneath the landslide
 In a champagne supernova in the sky
 Some day you will find me, caught beneath the landslide
 In a champagne supernova, a champagne supernova
 Cos people believe that they're gonna get away for the summer
 But you and I, we live and die, the world's still spinning round
 We don't know why, why, why, why, why
 
 How many special people change, how many lives are living strange
 Where were you while we were getting high?
 We were getting high
 We were getting high
 We were getting high
 We were getting high


 "Karma Police"
 by Radiohead

 Karma Police, arrest this man, he talks in maths
 He buzzes like a fridge, he's like a detuned radio
 Karma Police, arrest this girl, her hitler hairdo, is making me feel ill
 And we have crashed her party
 This is what you get, this is what you get
 This is what you get, when you mess with us
 
 Karma Police, I've given all I can, it's not enough
 I've given all I can, but we're still on the payroll
 This is what you get, this is what you get
 This is what you get, when you mess with us
 And for a minute there, I lost myself, I lost myself
 And for a minute there, I lost myself, I lost myself

 For a minute there, I lost myself, I lost myself


 "Change of a Season"
 by Bonham

 Rains of winter have come and gone
 Signs of a season's change
 Winds they rush through the empty streets
 No one
 No one invades (???)

 Cool evenings now of days gone past
 Remind me of you
 Lights from times and I could see
 A tear now
 A tear now around me

 Days are short and now and I've grown week
 All the colors of summer
 Happy lives reach their peak
 Are gone now away
 I walk along an empty beach
 Walk alone today
 Old man steals from down that road
 It moves on

 Change of a season
 Devil, you maiden
 Change of a season
 Devil, you maiden

 You people here just don't believe
 These changing times
 When all that dies you just don't see
 That I'll turn so blind
 Sky grew black and stone grey dawn
 Went on for days
 They (???) sun to find a way
 Dead, she's on the floor

 Change of a season
 Devil, you maiden
 Change of a season
 Death of creation
 Change of a season
 Devil, you maiden
 Change of a season
 Death of creation

 I'm still here far from home
 (???) froze off the desert sea
 I'm still here far from home
 Minds hoping now on the winds of hell
 Still a flame of life in me
 I've lost a flower and seasons change

 Rains of winter have come and gone
 Sign of a season's change
 I've been here now for a thousand years
 Well I'll return again

 Don't want to end up like you
 Oh so all alone
 Your travel road comes once a year
 I know you wait till then

 Around me now the ocean's seas
 Turn black with rage
 A devil's game so hard to see
 You're not your own disguise

 Change of a season
 Devil, you maiden
 Change of a season
 Death of creation
 Change of a season
 Devil, you maiden
 Change of a season
 Death of creation


 "Cover My Eyes"
 by Dream Theater

 I've got my hands out in front of my face
 But I can hardly see
 I've bathed myself in holy water
 But it doesn't bother me
 Under my skin, upon my head
 Inside the walls, beneath my bed
 My black and whites are turning red

 Cover my eyes and tell me
 Am I really blind
 Cover my eyes and tell me
 Have I lost my mind

 I've got my fingers to the blade
 But I can't feel a thing
 Open my eyes in salty water
 But it doesn't even sting
 Under my skin, upon my head
 Stuck in my throat, beneath my breath
 My black and whites are turning red

 Cover my eyes and tell me
 Am I really blind
 Cover my eyes and tell me
 Have I lost my mind
 Have I lost my mind
 Have I lost my mind

 Under my skin, upon my head
 The lunatic is playing dead
 My black and whites are turning red

 Cover my eyes and tell me
 Am I really blind
 Cover my eyes and tell me
 Have I lost my mind

 Cover my eyes and tell me
 Am I really blind
 Cover my eyes and tell me
 Have I lost my
 Have I lost my mind
 Have I lost my mind
 Have I lost my mind


 "Goosh"
 by Spiderbait

 Whenever you call
 My name
 I nearly run out to kill you

 Insane
 And I don't know how to tell you
 'Cos baby you look
 So strange
 Hanging down from the ceiling
 And maybe you need
 A change
 To take you mind to better days

 Ready yet?
 Do we really know the same thing
 Same song?
 Is it really not the same when I
 turn away?
 With a curse in your heart
 You have
 Nothing to say
 So I crawl into the whirlpool
 And I see one hundred stars
 I forgot that you touched your own
 Mutilated scars
 (Here we go now)
 
 Has the cat got your tongue? (3X)
 Has the cat got it?
 
 I joined a line
 You joined a line around the hen
 Nothing more is said
 Cat got your tongue
 I wear a blue silk gown
 I put my arm around a peachy [black] boy
 I put a cigarette on
 Make ya, make ya, make ya lose ya brain
 Make ya lose ya brain (2X)
 Make ya, make ya, make ya lose ya brain
 Make ya lose ya brain (2X)
 Make ya, make ya, make ya lose ya brain, yeah
 Make ya lose ya brain (2X)
 Make ya, make ya, make ya lose ya brain, yeah

 I'll run into you again (4X)
 Can you give me one of your stares (4X)
 Can you give me one (4X)


 "Possibly Maybe"
 by Bjork

 Your flirt finds me out
 Teases the crack in me
 Smittens me with hope

 Possibly maybe,
 possibly maybe,
 possibly maybe.

 As much as I definitely enjoy solitude
 I wouldn't mind perhaps
 Spending little time with you
 Sometimes, sometimes

 Possibly maybe
 probably love
 Possibly maybe
 probably love

 Uncertainty excites me
 Baby Who knows what's going to happen?
 Lottery or car crash
 Or you'll join a cult

 Probably maybe,
 possibly love
 This is probably maybe,
 possibly love, possibly

 Mon petit vulcan
 You're eruptions and disasters
 I keep calm
 Admiring the lava
 I keep calm

 Possibly maybe
 probably love
 Possibly maybe
 probably love

 Electric shocks?
 I love them
 With you dozen a day
 But after a while I wonder
 Where's that love you promised me?
 Where is he?

 Possibly maybe
 probably love
 Possibly maybe
 probably love

 How can you offer me love like that?
 My heart's burned
 How can you offer me love like that?
 I'm exhausted
 Leave me alone

 Possibly maybe,
 possibly maybe,
 possibly maybe.

 Since we broke up
 I'm using lipstick again
 I'll suck my tongue
 In remembrance of you

 Possibly maybe,
 possibly maybe
 Possibly maybe,
 possibly maybe
 Possibly maybe,
 possibly maybe


 "Boys at the Beak"
 by Spiderbait

 (something something something) on my wall
 (something something something) in the hall
 I work at Channel 9 I've gotta camera in my home
 Then I'll fuck you up the arse when I got you alone (???)

 (???????????????????)
 (Wow... anyone know?)


 "Horsin' Around"
 by Prefab Sprout

 It's me again your worthless friend or foe
 I somehow let that lovely creature down
 Horsin' around, horsin' around
 
 Some things we check and double check and lose
 I guess I let that little vow get lost
 Forgettin' the cost, forgettin' the cost
 
 Quick to forgive and so slow to blame,
 the very thought fills me with shame
 But that didn't stop it happening
 
 The thrill of it - can I call it that ? - was cheap
 And feeling cheap's the only thing you keep
 It's so unsightly to walk from her arms so lightly
 Selling it all up the swanee

 Horsin' around's a serious business,
 last thing you'd want somebody to witness
 I was the fool who always presumed that
 I'd wear the shoes and you'd be the doormat
 You wonder why my hands are still shaking:
 In need of a cry the shoulders are taken..

 I deserve to be kicked so badly
 You deserve more than I sold you for
 Horsin' around, horsin' around
 
 The moral is whatever else you learn
 You shouldn't let that lovely creature down
 Lord just blind me, don't let her innocent eyes remind me
 Selling it all up the swanee

 Horsin' around, horsin' around.
 

 "Wicked Ways"
 by Garbage

 I tried hard to mend my wicked ways
 I acted like a lunatic for years
 Lord knows I tried to be good
 I'd keep my promise if only I could
 Count your blessings that I covered light on you

 And I tried, and I tried, and I tried, and I tried

 CHORUS:
 Collect your pictures in the hall
 Put them up on the other wall ?????
 Close the door and keep it shut

 I've done things I've never thought I'd do
 Sure ain't help to lose myself in you
 Every time I'll be alright
 Say, c'mon sugar we'll go out tonight
 Forgive your trespassers and all that we've been through

 And I tried.(rpt. 7 times)

 CHORUS

 that sinking feeling
 When you are leaving
 All I'm believing
 What's at the door?

 I tried hard to mend my wicked ways
 Damage's done, there's nothing left to say

 And I tried (rpt. 7 times)

 CHORUS (w/ bkgd. Vocals)


 "Luka"
 by Suzanne Vega

 My name is Luka
 I live on the second floor
 I live upstairs from you
 Yes I think you've seen me before
 If you hear something late at night
 Some kind of troublesome kind of fright
 Just don't ask me what it was
 Just don't ask me what it was

 I think it's because I'm clumsy
 I try not to talk to loud
 Maybe it's because I'm crazy
 I try not to act too proud
 They only hit until you cry
 And after that you don't ask why
 You just don't argue anymore
 You just don't argue anymore
 You just don't argue anymore

 Yes I think I'm okay
 I walked into the door again
 Well, if you ask that's what I'll say
 And it's not your business anyway
 I guess I'd like to be alone
 With nothing broken, nothing thrown
 Just don't ask me how I am
 Just don't ask me how I am
 Just don't ask me how I am


 "Do it Again"
 by Steely Dan

 In the mornin you go gunnin'
 For the man who stole your water
 And you fire till he is done in
 But they catch you at the border
 And the mourners are all singin'
 As they drag you by your feet
 But the hangman isn't hangin'
 And they put you on the street
 
 You go back Jack do it again
 Wheel turnin' 'round and 'round
 You go back Jack do it again
 
 When you know she's no high climber
 Then you find your only friend
 In a room with your two timer
 And you're sure you're near the end
 Then you love a little wild one
 And she brings you only sorrow
 All the time you know she's smilin'
 You'll be on your knees tomorrow
 
 You go back Jack do it again
 Wheel turnin' 'round and 'round
 You go back Jack do it again
 
 Now you swear and kick and beg us
 That you're not a gamblin' man
 Then you find you're back in Vegas
 With a handle in your hand
 Your black cards can make you money
 So you hide them when you're able
 In the land of milk and honey
 You must put them on the table
 

 "A Question Of Time"
 by Depeche Mode

 I've got to get to you first
 Before they do
 It's just a question of time
 Before they lay their hands on you
 And make you just like the rest
 I've got to get to you first
 It's just a question of time

 Well now you're only fifteen
 And you look good
 I'll take you under my wing
 Somebody should
 They've persuasive ways
 And you'll believe what they say

 It's just a question of time
 It's running out for you
 It won't be long until you'll do
 Exactly what they want you to

 I can see them now
 Hanging around
 To mess you up
 To strip you down
 And have their fun
 With my little one

 It's just a question of time
 It's running out for you
 It won't be long until you'll do
 Exactly what they want you to

 Sometimes I don't blame them
 For wanting you
 You look good
 And they need something to do
 Until I look at you
 And then I condemn them
 I know my kind
 What goes on in our minds

 It's just a question of time
 It should be better
 It's just a question of time
 It should be better with you
 It's just a question of time


 "Black"
 by Pearl Jam

 Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
 Were laid spread out before me, as her body once did
 All five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun
 Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn
 Oooo, and all I taught her was everything
 Oooo, I know she gave me all that she wore
 And now my bitter hands shake beneath the clouds of what was everything
 All the pictures sent all been washed in black ...tattooed everything
 I take a walk outside, I'm surrounded by some kids at play
 I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear?
 And twisted thoughts that spin round my head, I'm spinnin'
 Oh I'm spinnin', how quick a sun can drop away
 And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass of what was everything
 All the pictures have all been washed in black ...tattooed everything
 All the love gone bad turned my world to black
 Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all that I'll be yeaheah
 Uhuh...uhuh...oooh I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
 I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky
 But why, why, why can't it be...can't it be mine? 


 "Should Have Done What My Mum Always Told Me To"
 by Spiderbait

 I know you and you know me
 I've got no personality
 Take away all your sympathy
 Do what you like to do to me
 
 N-no-no-no-n-no-no!
 N-no-no-no-no!
 
 I can see the way it's gonna go
 Only you and me will ever know
 Busting out of here is gonna be
 Almost an impossibility
 
 See the way that you're looking at me today
 (something) Can I swim? Can I get away?
 I can see, I can hear, I can taste the air
 Wanna run but I'm under intensive care

 N-no-no-no-n-no-no!
 N-no-no-no-n-no-no!
 N-no-no-no-n-no-no!

 I don't ever wanna say it
 Let me go and then I'll play it
 Don't you ever wanna see it?
 Looking at me with an eye
 
 I can see trouble brewing
 Don't you tell me what you're doing
 I don't ever wanna do it
 Looking at you with an eye
 
 N-no-no-no-n-no-no! N-no-no-no-n-no-no!
 N-no-no-no-n-no-no! N-no-no-no-n-no-no!
 N-no-no-no-n-no-no! N-no-no-no-n-no-no!
 N-no-no-no-n-no-no! N-no-no-no-no!

 Look at all the things you've done to me
 I can see you're where you want to be
 Put me in this sick serenity
 I can tell there's not much time for me
 
 Feeling sick, (something), yeah I'm slowing down
 Gotta get to a beat gotta come around
 See the door open up, see you coming through
 Should have done what my mum always told me to
 
 
 "Tesko Suicide"
 by Sneaker Pimps

 Phone me and I'll hang up
 Sick and tired of being bubble gum chewed up
 dark lane, bleak house shrinking rose,
 You're over and out

 Tie a cherry bootstring,
 put your candy teeth in
 Choking on a sweetheart,
 hang up, hang up, hang up

 Go on girls - solo,
 Go on girls - take a chance,
 Go on girls - trust it,
 Go on girls - the truth is ...

 Cut your hair wear a chip on your shoulder
 Get ahead, get laid, get it over
 Cheap show, back seat martyr's pose,
 you're over and out

 I'm checking out of my senses,
 buying best defences
 Putting on the trousers,
 hang up, hang up, hang up

 Go on girls - solo,
 Go on girls - take a chance,
 Go on girls - trust it,
 Go on girls - the truth is ...

 So so ... Single ... So low ... The truth is ...

 You want the day to fit to a soundtrack
 Get a story get a life and get back
 You've got nothing to shout about
 You're over and out

 I'm checking out of my senses,
 Buying best defences
 Fired up on free-will,
 hang up, hang up, hang up

 Go on girls - solo,
 Go on girls - take a chance,
 Go on girls - trust it,
 Go on girls - the truth is ...

 So so ... Single ... So low ... The truth is ...
 So so ... Single ... So low ... The truth is ...


 "Stairway To Heaven"
 by Led Zeppelin

 There's a lady who's sure
 All that glitters is gold
 And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
 When she gets there she knows
 If the stores are all closed
 With a word she can get what she came for.
 Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.

 There's a sign on the wall
 But she wants to be sure
 'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
 In a tree by the brook
 There's a songbird who sings,
 Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
 Ooh, it makes me wonder,
 Ooh, it makes me wonder.

 There's a feeling I get
 When I look to the west,
 And my spirit is crying for leaving.
 In my thoughts I have seen
 Rings of smoke through the trees,
 And the voices of those who standing looking.
 Ooh, it makes me wonder,
 Ooh, it really makes me wonder.

 And it's whispered that soon
 If we all call the tune
 Then the piper will lead us to reason.
 And a new day will dawn
 For those who stand long
 And the forests will echo with laughter.

 If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
 Don't be alarmed now,
 It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
 Yes, there are two paths you can go by
 But in the long run
 There's still time to change the road you're on.
 And it makes me wonder.

 Your head is humming and it won't go
 In case you don't know,
 The piper's calling you to join him,
 Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow,
 And did you know
 Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.

 And as we wind on down the road
 Our shadows taller than our soul.
 There walks a lady we all know
 Who shines white light and wants to show
 How ev'rything still turns to gold.
 And if you listen very hard
 The tune will come to you at last.
 When all are one and one is all
 To be a rock and not to roll.

 And she's buying a stairway to heaven.


 "Edge of Thorns"
 by Savatage

 An offering of reasons
 We put them all away
 A covering of treasons
 That one by one we let slip away

 A solitary dancer
 So lost upon her stage

 I have seen you on the edge of dawn
 Felt you there before you were born
 Balanced your dreams upon the edge of thorns
 But I don't think about you anymore

 A study made of winter
 Of summers long ago
 And dreams that use to glitter
 Safely now hidden under snow

 And so we end this chapter
 And let the stage lights fade

 I have seen you on the edge of dawn
 Felt you there before you were born
 Balanced your dreams upon the edge of thorns
 But I don't think about you anymore


 "In the Aeroplane over the Sea"
 by Neutral Milk Hotel

 What a beautiful face
 I have found in this place
 That is circling all round the sun
 What a beautiful dream
 That could flash on the screen
 In a blink of an eye and be gone from me
 Soft and sweet
 Let me hold it close and keep it here with me

 And one day we will die
 And our ashes will fly from the aeroplane over the sea
 But for now we are young
 Let us lay in the sun
 And count every beautiful thing we can see
 Love to be
 In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me

 Anna's ghost all around
 Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
 Soft and sweet
 How the notes all bend and reach above the trees
 
 Now how I remember you
 How I would push my fingers through
 Your mouth to make those muscles move
 That made your voice so smooth and sweet
 And now we keep where we don't know
 All secrets sleep in winter clothes
 With one you loved so long ago
 Now he don't even know his name

 What a beautiful face
 I have found in this place
 That is circling all round the sun
 And when we meet on a cloud
 I'll be laughing out loud
 I'll be laughing with everyone I see
 Can't believe how strange it is to be anything at all


 "Oklahoma"
 by Dan Bern

 On the 19th day of April
 Of 1995
 There was the worst car bombing
 200 people died.
 In Oklahoma City
 On Wednesday, 9 o'clock
 They struck the Federal building
 Took out near half a block.
 They thought it was an earthquake
 Made trees and light poles bend
 And folks thought they were seeing
 The world come to an end.
 They blew the building open;
 It lay there like a wound
 Twisted pipes and wires
 And silent like a tomb.
 
 Yes, it blew the building open
 And blew folks lives apart
 Fire fighters mumbling
 And wondering where to start
 
 They rushed out some survivors
 But soon could only cry
 And place the dead in caskets
 And ask the dear lord why
 Prayers for the missing
 For daughters and for sons
 Prayers for the souls of those
 Who'd never hurt a one.
 
 Kevin Small was lucky
 His clock needed repair.
 He overslept an hour:
 His three year old son was spared.
 But for too many others
 The news was not so bright.
 One baby got her picture in the paper,
 Then she died.
 
 The President, he promised
 "they'd pay dearly for the blast
 And all across the country
 Flags were flying at half mast.
 
 (harmonica)
 Shock soon turned to anger
 "Who'd do this ?" People said
 And anyone suspicious had
 A price upon their head.
 They thought it was some Arabs
 And folks began to scream,
 "First tighten up the borders:
 Then hang them from a tree! "
 
 This proves what we've been saying
 'Bout our fair and gentle land
 Nobody who did this could be an American "
 
 The FBI got busy
 Some drawings and some names
 And everyone was looking for
 Someone else to blame.
 
 Some fifty hours later
 Early Friday day
 They found the man they wanted
 In jail, ten miles away.
 A so-called right extremist
 A patriot government foe
 An expert on explosives
 And white as driven snow.
 
 When people heard the news,
 They found it hard to understand
 "How could such a murderer
 Come from our own land?"
 
 But when we build walls and borders
 From fear and hate and guns
 The hatred turns around and
 Strikes at everyone.
 
 Maybe now we'll understand,
 Maybe now we'll see;
 Super Patriots are seldom friends of you and me.
 They're scared and weak and cowards
 And they think that with their guns
 The ones they're most afraid of
 Will turn around and run.
 
 But when we stand strong together
 And let love enjoy it's will,
 Misfortune can't defeat us
 It makes us stronger still.
 
 Like on the nineteenth day of April,
 Of Nineteen, ninety- five
 The day all Oklahomans will
 Remember all their lives.
 

 "Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before"
 by The Smiths

 stop me, stop me
 stop me if you think that you've
 heard this one before
 stop me, stop me
 stop me if you think that you've
 heard this one before

 nothing's changed
 i still love you, oh i still love you
 only slightly less than i used to
 
 i was delayed i was way-laid
 an emergency stop
 i smelt the last ten seconds of life
 i crashed down on the crossbar
 and the pain was enough to make
 a shy, bald buddhist reflect
 and plan a mass-murder
 who said i'd lied to her?
 who said i'd lied because i never
 who said i'd lied because i never

 i was detained, i was restrained
 he broke my spleen
 he broke my knees
 (and then he really laid into me)
 friday night in Out-patients
 who said i'd lied to her?
 who said i'd lied because i never
 who said i'd lied because i never

 oh, so i drank one
 or was it four
 and when i fell on the floor
 i drank more

 stop me, stop me
 stop me if you think that
 you've heard this one before
 nothing's changed
 i still love you
 oh i still love you
 but only slightly less than i used to


 "Fallen Angel"
 by Poison

 She stepped off the bus out into the city streets
 Just a small town girl with her whole life
 Packed in a suitcase by her feet

 But somehow the lights didn't
 shine as bright as they did
 On her mama's TV screen

 And the work seemed harder
 And the days seemed longer
 Than she ever thought they'd be

 But you know you got to stick to your guns
 When it all comes down
 Cause sometimes you can't choose
 It's like heads they win
 Tails you're gonna lose

 Chorus:
 Win big--Mama's fallen angel
 Lose big--livin' out her lies
 Wants it all--Mama's fallen angel
 Lose it all, rollin' the dice of her life

 Now she found herself in the fast lane livin' day to day
 Turned her back on her best friends, yeah
 And let her family slip away

 Just like a lost soul
 caught up in the Hollywood scene
 All the parties and the limousines

 Such a good actress hiding all her pain
 Trading her memories for fortune and fame

 Just a step away from the edge of a fall
 Caught between heaven and hell
 Where's the girl I knew a year ago

 Chorus

 Too much too soon
 Or just a little too late
 Cause when her ship came in
 She wasn't there and it just wouldn't wait

 Solo, chorus out


 "Creep"
 by Stone Temple Pilots

 Forward yesterday
 Makes me wanna stay
 What they said was real
 Makes me wanna steal
 Livin' under house
 Guess I'm livin', I'm a mouse
 All's I gots is time
 Got no meaning, just a rhyme

 Take time with a wounded hand
 'Cause it likes to heal
 Take time with a wounded hand
 'Cause I like to steal
 Take time with a wounded hand
 'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal
 
 I'm half the man I used to me
 This I feel as the dawn
 It fades to gray
 Well, I'm half the man I used to be
 This I feel as the dawn
 It fades to gray
 Well, I'm half the man I used to me
 This I feel as the dawn
 It fades to gray
 Well, I'm half the man I used to be, half the man I used to be
 
 Feelin' uninspired
 Think I'll start a fire
 Everybody run
 Bobby's got a gun
 Think you're kinda neat
 Then she tells me I'm a creep
 Friends don't mean a thing
 Guess I'll leave it up to me
 
 Take time with a wounded hand
 'Cause it likes to heal
 Take time with a wounded hand
 Guess I like to steal
 Take time with a wounded hand
 'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal
 
 I'm half the man I used to me
 This I feel as the dawn
 It fades to gray
 I'm half the man I used to be
 This I feel as the dawn
 It fades to gray
 I'm half the man I used to be
 This I feel as the dawn
 It fades to gray
 I'm half the man I used to be, half the man I used to be
 
 Take time with a wounded hand
 'Cause it likes to heal
 Take time with a wounded hand
 Guess I like to steal
 Take time with a wounded hand
 'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal
 
 I'm half the man I used to me
 This I feel as the dawn
 It fades to gray
 I'm half the man I used to be
 This I feel as the dawn
 It fades to gray
 I'm half the man I used to be
 This I feel as the dawn
 It fades to gray
 I'm half the man I used to be, half the man I used to be,
 Half the man I used to be


 "Do Ya Know"
 by Slaughter

 It's been an illusion in your mind
 Imagination runs wild
 Well are you satisfied
 'Cause the picture you paint is so blue?
 Ah, so blue
 Or do you close your eyes
 To live the other side?
 When you're lookin' in the mirror
 There is no one in sight
 Yeah!

 Chorus:
 Do you really know who you are?
 So ya wanna change your life
 Do you really know who you are?
 'Cause you're gonna have to face it
 (Gonna have to face it)Tell me why

 Why do ya cry out(cry out loud)
 In vain
 Lost in confusion
 Is your game

 Well are you satisfied
 'Cause the picture you paint is so blue
 Ah, so blue
 Or do you close your eyes
 To live the other side
 When you're lookin' in the mirror
 There is no one in sight
 Yeah!

 "Barrel of a Gun"
 by Depeche Mode

 Do you mean this horny creep
 Set upon weary feet
 Who looks in need of sleep
 That doesn't come

 This twisted, tortured mess
 This bed of sinfulness
 Who's longing for some rest
 And feeling numb

 What do you expect of me
 What is it you want
 Whatever you've planned for me
 I'm not the one

 A vicious appetite
 Visits me each night
 And won't be satisfied
 Won't be denied

 An unbearable pain
 A beating in my brain
 That leaves the mark of Cain
 Right here inside

 What am I supposed to do
 When everything that I've done
 Is leading me to conclude
 I'm not the one

 Whatever I've done
 I've been staring down the barrel of a gun

 Is there something you need from me
 Are you having your fun
 I never agreed to be
 Your holy one

 Whatever I've done
 I've been staring down the barrel of a gun


 "Startin' Up A Posse"
 by Anthrax

 Now I'm gonna tell ya a story
 A tale of wrong and Right
 and freedom is the reason
 You can't take it without a fight

 Verse 1
 So now I'm startin' up a posse
 (Suck my dick, suck my dick)
 To come and look for you
 We're gonna put a stop
 To what you want to do
 You fucking whores
 (You fuckin' whores)
 That's all you are

 Verse 2
 You say our records are offensive
 (You're a douche, You're a douche)
 Our messages ain't right
 You say "We're gonna label records
 So our kids can grow up right"
 You fucking whores
 (Let them decide)
 That's all you are

 Chorus
 Shit, fuck, staan, death, sex drugs, rape
 These seven words you're trying to take
 Shit, fuck, satan, death, sex, drugs, rape
 Right or wrong it's our choice to make
 America the beautiful, Land of the free
 Don't change the words to land of Hypocrisy

 Verse 3
 Now I'm startin' up a posse
 (Fascist scum, fascist scum)
 And we'll damn sure make you see
 Something that offends you
 May not be offensive to me
 You fucking whores
 (You fuckin' whores)
 That's all you are

 Verse 4
 Now you might take offense
 To a word like "fuck" or "shit"
 (Dick!)
 But you fuckin' don't have the right
 (Cunt!)
 To discriminate me for saying it!
 You fuckin' whores
 ( You fuckin' whores)
 That's all you are

 Chorus

 Verse 5
 So now I'm startin' up a posse
 (Motherfucker, motherfuck)
 To fight for freedom of choice
 To fight for freedom of speech
 We're gonna make you hear our voice

 Verse 6
 And now I don't do this to shock you
 (That's the end, that's the end)
 I don't do this for spite
 You've got the choice, don't buy it, don't read it,
 And don't say your opinion's right
 You fucking whores
 (You fuckin' whores)
 That's all you are
 (Cunty, cunty, cunty, cunt)

 Verse 7
 You know you can't censor my feelings
 You can't censor my thoughts
 Censorship's against
 Everything America stands for
 You fuckin' whores
 (Let us decide)
 That's all you are
 (And this ain't sexist, either)


 Album: Mezzanine
 by Massive Attack


 "Angel"

 You are my angel
 Come from way above
 To bring me love
 Her eyes
 She's on the dark side
 Neutralize
 Every man in sight
 
 Love you, love you, love you ...

 "Dissolved girl"

 Shame
 Such a shame
 I think I kind of lost myself again
 
 Day
 Yesterday Really should be leaving but I stay
 
 Say
 Say my name
 I need a little love to ease the pain

 It's easy to remember when it came 'Cause It feels like I've been
 I've been here before
 And you are not my savior
 But I still don't go
 Feels like something that I've done before
 I could fake it but I still want more

 Fade
 Made the fade
 Passion's overrated anyway
 
 Say
 Say my name
 I need a little love to ease the pain
 
 It's easy to remember when it came
 'Cause I feels like I've been
 I've been here before
 And you are not my savior
 But I still don't go Feels like something that I've done before
 I could fake it but I still want more, oh!
 

 "(Exchange)"

 Yeah yeah yeah ah
 You see a man's face
 But you don't see his heart
 You see a man's face
 But you will never know his thoughts
 
 Everywhere you go
 There's a man to say love
 Never neither never neither
 Take it to heart
 
 For your heart is your heart
 And your thoughts is your thoughts
 Never mix love with hatred
 
 You see a man's face
 You will never see his heart
 You see a man's face
 But you will never know his thoughts
 You see a man's face
 You will never know his thoughts
 You see a man's face
 

 "Group four"

 A flask I drink of sober tea
 While reeling cameras monitor me
 And the buzz surrounds it does
 Buzz surrounds (x2)

 Closed eyed sky wide open
 Unlimited girl unlimited sigh
 Elsewhere
 indefinitely far away
 magnifies and deepens

 Ready to sing
 my sixth sense peacefully place on my breath
 And listening
 
 Keys swing from my hand

 My ears know that my eyes are closed

 perish thoughts like contraband

 I train myself in martial arts
 as advertised
 i reinforce my softened parts
 as advertised

 seen through me little glazed lane
  a world in myself
 ready to sing
  my sixth sense peacefully place on my breath

 Flickering I roam

 And listening
 My ears know that my eyes are closed
 We need to sing
 My sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath

 Flickering I roam

 And listening
 my ears know that my eyes are closed

 i see to bolts, put keys to locks
 no boats are rocked, i'm free to roam
 among dummy screens and magazines

 closed eyed sky wide open
 unlimited girl unlimited sigh

 to think I lay next to you
 wasting time when I could do
 a simple job in striplight
 a flask I drink of sober tea
 til daylight sends me home
 flickering I roam

 daydreaming admiring being
 quietly, open the world
  i hear the time
 of the starry sky
 turning over at midnight
 seen through me little glazed lane
 a world in myself
 daydreaming admiring being
 quietly, open the world
  i hear the time of the starry sky
  turning over at midnight
 

 "Inertia creeps"

 Recollect me darling raise me to your lips
 Two undernourished egos four rotating hips
 Hold on to me tightly i'm a sliding scale
 Can't endure then you can inhale
 Clearly out of body experience
 Interferes and dreams of flying i fit nearly
 Surrounds me though I get lonely
  Slowly

 Moving up slowly
  Inertia keeps
  She's moving up slowly
 
 In my home no chrome as clear as
 See me now with my nearest dearest
 Been there when I'm over-careering
 Room shifting is endearing
 Between us is our kitchen
 
 Where she finds my irritant's itching
  Been here before
 Been here forever
 
 Moving up slowly
 Inertia keeps moving up slowly
 Inertia creeps moving up slowly
 Inertia keeps moving up slowly
 She comes
 
 There be no sound in my eiderdown
 Awake i lie in the morning blue
  Room is still my antenna in you
 Nylon burns the bedspread with 2
 Gravity's zero see me stall
 I bounce off the walls lose my footing and fall
 It can be sweet though incomplete though
 And the frames will freeze
 See me on all fours
 It's been a long time
 
 She comes (x2)
  Comes I want to x you, she comes (x2)
 
  I caught your radio waves (x2)
 With tin cans and string
 Say you string me along
 Say string me along
 

 "Man next door"

 There is a man that live next door
 In my neighborhood (x2)
 And he gets me down...
 
 He gets in so late at night
 Always a fuss and fight (x2)
 All through the night
 
 I've got to get away from here
 This is not a place for me to stay
 I've got to take my family
 We'll find a quiet place

 Hear the pots and pans they fall
 Bang against my wall (x2)
 No rest at all
 
 He gets in so late at night
 Always a fuss and fight (x2)
 All through the night
 
 I've got to get away from here
 This is not a place for me to stay
 I've got to take my family
 We'll find a quiet place
 

 "Mezzanine"

 I'm a little curious of you in crowded scenes
 And how serene your friends and fiends
 We flew and strolled as 2 eliminated gently
 Why don't you close your eyes and reinvent me

 You knew you had a heart made of stone
 You should have let me know
 You could have let me know

 We'll go 'till morning comes
 And traffic grows
  And windows hum

 Speding all week with your friends
 Give me evenings and weekends
 Evenings and weekends
 
 I could for yours
 We can unwind
 All these other flaws all these influence

 You'd agree it's a typical high
 You fly as you watch your name go by
  And once the name goes by
  Not thicker than water nor thicker than mud
  and the 8K thuds it does
 sunset so quickly
 Let's make it quiet and quickly
 Don't frown
  tastes better on the way back down

 I care for yours
 We can unwind
 All these other flaws all these influence
 All these other flaws Will lead to mine

 We are more curious

  ??? Stick me down Stick me...down
  We can unwind all these other flaws
 

 "Rising sun"

 I seen you go down to a cold mirror
 It was never clearer in my error
 You click a shine upon your forehead or
 Check it by the signs in the corridor
 You light my ways through the club maze
 We would struggle through the dub daze
 
 I sink myself in hair upon my lover
 It's how you go down to men's room sink
 Sad we talk how madmen think
 I sink myself in hair upon my lover
 I don't know her from another miss
 I don't know you from another
 See me run now you're gone...dream on
 
 Why you want to take me to this party and breathe
  I'm dying to leave
 Every time we grind you know we sever lines
 Where have those flowers gone
 Long time passing
 Why you keep it testing, keep on tasking
 I keep on asking

 Toy-like people make me boy-like (x2)
 They're invisible, when the trip it flips
 They get physical, way below my lips
 And everything you got hoi-poloi like
 Now you're lost and you're lethal
 Now's a fine time, you gotta leave all
 These good people...dream on

 Nicer than the bird up in the tree top
 Cheaper than the chip inside my lap top
 All the variations you could do with me
 Nicer than the girl up in your mind you're free
 
 Automatic crystal remote control, we come to move your soul

 You kinda fade into the background
 Like a better smoke'll bring you back round
 Like a man slide inside you my dear
 Your cheap beer's filled with crocodile tears
 See 'em run now your gone...dream on

 I found a reason
 Toy-like people make me boy-like (x2)
 Dream on
 

 "Teardrop"

 Love, love is a verb
 Love is a doing word
 Feather's on my breath
 Gentle impulsion
 Shakes me makes me lighter
 Feather's on my breath
 
 Teardrop on the fire
 Feather's on my breath
 
 in the night of matter
 Black flowers blossom
 Feather's on my breath
 Black flowers blossom
 Feather's on my breath
 
 Teardrop on the fire
 Feather's on my breath
 
 Water is my eye
 Most faithful mirror
 Feather's on my breath
 Teardrop on the fire of a confession
 Feather's on my breath
  Most faithful my love
 Feather's on my breath
 
  Teardrop on the fire
 Feather's on my breath
 
 stumbling a little (x2)


 "Bizarre Love Triangle"
 by New Order

 Every time I think of you
 I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
 It's no problem of mine but it's a problem I find
 Living a life that I can't leave behind
 There's no sense in telling me
 The wisdom of a fool won't set you free
 But that's the way that it goes
 And it's what nobody knows
 While every day my confusion grows
 Every time I see you falling
 I get down on my knees and pray
 I'm waiting for that final moment
 You'll say the words that I can't say

 I feel fine and I feel good
 I'm feeling like I never should
 Whenever I get this way,
 I just don't know what to say
 Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
 I'm not sure what this could mean
 I don't think you're what you seem
 I do admit to myself
 That if I hurt someone else
 Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be
 Every time I see you falling
 I get down on my knees and pray
 I'm waiting for that final moment
 You'll say the words that I can't say

 "Father Of Mine"
 by Everclear

 Father of mine tell me where have you been?
 You know I just closed my eyes and my whole world disappeared.
 Father of mine take me back to the day when I was still your golden boy,
 Back before you went away.
 I remember blue skies, walking the block.
 I loved it when you held me high, I loved to hear you talk.
 You would take me to a movie, you would take me to the beach,
 You would take me to the place inside that is so hard to reach.

 Father of mine tell me where did you go?
 You had the world inside your hand, and you did not seem to know.
 Father of mine, tell me what do you see,
 When you look back at your wasted life and you don't see me.
 I was ten years old, doing all that I could.
 It wasn't easy for me to be a scared white boy in a black neighbourhood.
 Sometimes you would send me a birthday card with a five dollar bill.
 I never understood you then, and I guess I never will.

 Daddy gave me a name, my dad he gave me a name then he walked away.
 Daddy gave me a name then he walked away. My dad me gave me a name.
 Father of mine, tell me where have you been?
 I just closed my eyes and the world disappeared.
 Father of mine, tell me how do you sleep?
 With all the children you abandoned and the wife I saw you beat.
 I will never be safe, I will never be sane,
 I will always be weird inside, I will always be lame.
 Now I'm a grown man with a child of my own.
 And I swear that I will never let her know all the pain I have known.

 Then he walked away. Daddy gave me a name then he walked away.
 My dad he gave me a name then he walked away.
 Daddy gave me a name then he walked away. My dad he gave me a name.
 Then he walked away.


 "Eclipse"
 by Pink Floyd

 All that you touch 
 All that you see 
 All that you taste 
 All you feel. 
 All that you love 
 All that you hate 
 All you distrust 
 All you save. 
 All that you give 
 All that you deal 
 All that you buy, 
 beg, borrow or steal. 
 All you create 
 All you destroy 
 All that you do 
 All that you say. 
 All that you eat 
 And everyone you meet 
 All that you slight 
 And everyone you fight. 
 All that is now 
 All that is gone 
 All that's to come 
 and everything under the sun is in tune 
 but the sun is eclipsed by the moon. 
 

 "Dumb"
 by Nirvana

 I'm not like them
 But I can pretend
 The sun is gone
 But I have a light
 The day is done
 But I'm having fun
 I think I'm dumb
 or maybe just happy
 Think I'm just happy

 my heart is broke
 But I have some glue
 help me inhale
 And mend it with you
 [We'll float around]
 And hang out on clouds
 Then we'll come down
 And I have a hangover...
 Have a hangover

 Skin the sun
 Fall asleep
 Wish away
 The soul is cheap
 Lesson learned
 Wish me luck
 Soothe the burn
 Wake me up


 "Negative Girl"
 by Steely Dan

 She's lost - she's late
 She's zooming on a couch somewhere
 Or high - or home
 I'm not supposed to call her there
 I wait - I smoke
 I stare into my coke
 It's happening again
 I tell myself that it's over and done, amen
 
 Her skin - like milk
 It's like she's never seen the sun
 Some hearts to crunch
 Is more like her idea of fun
 I know - she's ill
 I'm cruising for a spill
 I'm hanging just the same
 I need to be in the heat
 Of her cold white flame
 
 Another negative girl
 At the edge of the frame
 Deliciously toxic
 The original classic thing - more of the same
 
 She's in the zone
 Crying on the phone
 I need you here
 I'm on the street again
 Staggering out into the burn of the brain dead dawn
 To arrive in time to find her gone
 
 She's on the train
 To somewhere up by Fordham Road
 Her reptile brain
 Locked down and ready in combat mode
 Some cash - a key
 This guy she has to see
 A doctor friend uptown
 And maybe she gets to me when she comes back down
 
 Another negative girl
 Spinning out of the frame
 Exquisitely limpid
 The original classic thing - more of the same

 A goof - a buzz
 If that is what it was
 Then how do you explain
 The way she looks when she's
 Dragging me out to dance with her
 In the summer rain

 Another negative girl
 At the edge of the frame
 Exhausting and luscious
 The original classic thing - more of the same

 English Translation :
 I worship the gurus' lotus feet 
 Awakening the happiness of the self-revealed 
 Beyond comparison 
 Working like the jungle physician 
 To pacify loss of conscienceness from 
 The poison of existence 
 In the form of a man up to the shoulders 
 Holding a conch, discus and sword 
 Thousand-headed, white 
 I bow respectfully 
 Peace 


 "Yesterday"
 by The Beatles

 Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
 Now it looks as though they're here to stay
 Oh, I believe in yesterday.

 Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be,
 There's a shadow hanging over me.
 Oh, I yesterday came suddenly.

 Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say.
 I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

 Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play.
 Now I need a place to hide away.
 Oh, I believe in yesterday.

 Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say.
 I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

 Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play.
 Now I need a place to hide away.
 Oh, I believe in yesterday.
 Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm.

 Roxanne
 You don't have to put on the red light
 Those days are over
 You don't have to sell your body to the night

 Roxanne
 You don't have to wear that dress tonight
 Walk the streets for money
 You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right

 Roxanne
 You don't have to put on the red light
 Roxanne
 You don't have to put on the red light

 Roxanne  (Put on the red light)

 Roxanne  (Put on the red light)
 Roxanne

 I loved you since I knew you
 I wouldn't talk down to you
 I have you to tell just how I feel
 I won't share you with another boy

 I know my mind is made up
 So put away your make up
 Told you once I won't tell you again
 It's a bad way

 Roxanne
 You don't have to put on the red light
 Roxanne
 You don't have to put on the red light

 "Hey"
 by Spiderbait

 Hey
 I don't remember my name
 And if you think that I'm sane
 My personality's out again (??)

 Hey
 I'll think of something to say
 It really isn't my day
 And I apologise in each and every single way

 No
 I'm never ready to go
 And they will bet that I'm slow
 But then they tell me I'm wonderful

 So
 I'm very happy to show
 That everyone that I know
 Is living the tale of woe
 

 "Don't Look Past Me"
 by Dream Theater

 "I don't know, I feel a lot of           [Sample is Robert DeNiro from the ]
 distance and I feel far away.            [film "The Deer Hunter".          ]
 I'll see you later..."

 I have seen you born before me
 I have watched you die
 I have heard every word you said to me

 Leave no question in your mind
 There is no brighter star to guide you
 Don't look past me to the sun, the sun is I
 I am the sun...

 So close the door behind him
 He wanders slowly to the car
 Trying to lift his heavy heart
 He says...

 "I feel bad about this.                  [Sample is Timothy Hutton from the]
 I feel really bad about this.            [film "Ordinary People".          ]
 Just, just let me feel bad about this."

 I'm through just getting by
 Countless times a friend has told me
 Watch out for the wave
 Now it seems the sea will be my grave
 And still you swim to save me
 Even though the water is much colder now
 Even though the water is much colder now

 Sometimes you can act on intuition
 Sometimes you can use a different point of view
 I've found that in such a position
 I could always come to you (Sun)
 I've seen you weep
 I have seen you tired and lonely (without you)
 But it only takes one heart (one heart)
 To lift you up and send you on
 Can you understand the life I've shown you
 Understand it's me, I'm giving you

 I have seen you born before me
 I have watched you die
 I have heard every word you said to me

 I have no question in my mind
 There's been no brighter star to guide me
 I don't look past you to the sun,
 so don't look past me to the sun,
 The sun is...

 And so love is broken
 They're asking me how can you help
 When you don't even know how that feels
 I don't need one thousand reasons
 When someone starts to cry
 When someone says my heart needs lifting
 Don't ask how come, ask how high

 I have seen you born before me
 I have watched you die
 I have heard every word you said to me

 Leave no question in your mind
 There is no brighter star to guide you
 Don't look past me to the sun, the sun is I

 Leave no question in your mind
 There is no brighter star to guide you
 Don't look past me to the sun, (it knows where you are)


 "Afro-Man"
 sung to the tune of Black Sabbath's "Iron Man"
 by Rich, The Stoner Guy I Lived With Once

 I am Afro-Man
 Running through the hills from the Ku Klux Klan
 They have white robes
 Pointed hats and baseball bats
 Oh shit, they're using me
 As a pinata in a Christmas tree


 "Pride (In the Name of Love)"
 by U2

 One man come in the name of love
 One man come and go
 One man come, he to justify
 One man to overthrow

 In the name of love
 What more in the name of love
 In the name of love
 What more in the name of love

 One man caught on a barbed wire fence
 One man he resist
 One man washed on an empty beach.
 One man betrayed with a kiss

 In the name of love
 What more in the name of love
 In the name of love
 What more in the name of love

 (nobody like you...)

 Early morning, April 4
 Shot rings out in the Memphis sky
 Free at last, they took your life
 They could not take your pride

 In the name of love
 What more in the name of love
 In the name of love
 What more in the name of love

 In the name of love
 What more in the name of love...


 "Bachelorette"
 by Bjork

 I'm a fountain of blood
 In the shape of a girl
 You're the bird on the brim
 Hypnotised by the Whirl
 Drink me, make me feel real
 Wet your beak in the stream
 Game we're playing is life
 Love is a two way dream

 Leave me now, return tonight
 Tide will show you the way

 If you forget my name
 You will go astray
 Like a killer whale
 Trapped in a bay

 I'm a path of cinders
 Burning under your feet
 You're the one who walks me
 I'm your one way street
 I'm a whisper in water
 Secret for you to hear
 You are the one who grows distant
 When I beckon you near

 Leave me now, return tonight
 The tide will show you the way

 If you forget my name
 You will go astray
 Like a killer whale
 Trapped in a bay

 I'm a tree that grows hearts
 One for each that you take
 You're the intruder saint
 I'm the branch that you break

 Hum-yeah!


 "The Trees"
 by Rush

 There is unrest in the forest,
 There is trouble with the trees,
 For the maples want more sunlight
 And the oaks ignore their pleas.
 
 The trouble with the maples,
 (And they're quite convinced they're right)
 They say the oaks are just too lofty
 And they grab up all the light.
 But the oaks can't help their feelings
 If they like the way they're made.
 And they wonder why the maples
 Can't be happy in their shade.
 
 There is trouble in the forest,
 And the creatures all have fled,
 As the maples scream "Oppression!"
 And the oaks just shake their heads
 
 So the maples formed a union
 And demanded equal rights.
 "The oaks are just too greedy;
 We will make them give us light."
 Now there's no more oak oppression,
 For they passed a noble law,
 And the trees are all kept equal
 By hatchet, axe, and saw.

 "Going To California"
 by Led Zeppelin

 Spent my days with a woman unkind,
 Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.
 Made up my mind to make a new start,
 Going To California with an aching in my heart.
 Someone told me there's a girl out there
 With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.

 Took my chances on a big jet plane,
 Never let them tell you that they're all the same.
 The sea was red and the sky was grey,
 Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
 The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
 As the children of the sun began to awake.

 Seems that the wrath of the Gods
 Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
 I think I might be sinking.
 Throw me a line if I reach it in time
 I'll meet you up there where the path
 Runs straight and high.

 To find a queen without a king;
 They say she plays guitar and cries and sings. La la la la
 Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
 Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born.
 Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,
 Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems.


 "All Apologies"
 by Nirvana
	
 Wha4t else should I be 
 All apologies 
 What else should I say 
 Everyone is gay 
 What else could I write 
 I don't have the right 
 What else should I be 
 All apologies 

 In the sun 
 In the sun I feel as one 
 In the sun 
 In the sun 
 I'm married 
 buried 
 
 I wish I was like you 
 Easily amused 
 Find my nest of salt 
 Everything is my fault 
 I'll take all the blame 
 I'll proceed from shame 
 Sunburn with freezer burn 
 Choking on the ashes of a memory 

 All in all we all are
 

 "To Bring You My Love"
 by PJ Harvey

 I was born in the desert
 I've been down four years
 Jesus come closer
 I think my time is near
 I've travelled over
 Dry earth and floods
 Hell on high waters
 To bring you my love
 Climbed over mountains
 Traveled the seas
 Cast out of heaven
 Cast down on my knees
 I play with the devil
 Curse god above
 Forsaken heaven
 To bring you my love
 To bring you my love
 To bring you my love
 No one's gonna be here
 Forsaken heaven
 Curse god above
 Play with the devil
 Bring you my love

 "Never Say Never"

 i was blind 
 as a bat 
 and still knew 
 where you were at 
 i was deaf 
 and dumb 
 and still knew 
 that you're the only one. 

 i could show up 
 at your door 
 and still know 
 what you're looking for. 
 i could wait 
 in your line 
 and if you had no money 
 i would give you my last dime. 

 i never 
 (never, never) 
 took it out 
 no, i never 
 (never, never) 
 took it out on you 
 no, i never 
 (never say never) 
 take it out on you.

 "Being With You"

 i sit with emptiness waiting for your call 
 will you still love me after the fall 
 an open phone line, but i still hit your walls 
 and it's just like being with you. 
 
 the cold rejection, that we can see the 
 our whole reflection, that i can't believe 
 we'll say it's over, but won't feel relief 
 it's just like being with you 
 it's just like being with you. 

 you know what you 
 need to do 
 and i know what's right for me 
 and you know what you 
 need to do 
 and i know what's right for me 

 a happy birthday i will wish you 
 the swollen memory, so we must choose 
 a tearful goodbye but we can't lose 
 it's just like being with you. 
 it's just like being with you. 
 you know what you need to do and i know what's right for me. 
 

 "Gagged and Tied" 

 i'd like to take you home

 "Retreat From the Sun" 

 and i looked 
 away from you 
 and i found 
 a better way to do it 
 and i've seen 
 some younger people happy 
 as can be 
 but not as especially happier than me. 
 happier than me. 

 you may run 
 like a bitch in heat 
 but it's fun 
 to sometimes try to retreat from the sun 
 cause it's awful lonely where i'm coming from 
 where i'm coming from. 

 retreat from the sun
 retreat from the sun 
 retreat from the sun 
 retreat from the sun 


 "Minneapolis"

 i was at the jabberjaw 
 cutest boy i ever saw 
 he was standing behind me 
 he was such a dream. 
 
 he kept looking right my way 
 i wanna see him every day 
 randy told me where he lives 
 in minneapolis 
 
 hung around till closing time 
 i wanna make him mine all mine 
 told my friends i want to leave 
 but they embarrassed me
 
 i took out my keys for my car 
 walked down the street--not very far 
 he came running after me 
 he saw me at the entry 

 minneapolis

 he said, "i heard you ask about me" 
 and i responded "yes" quietly 
 he said, "i'm leaving on wednesday 
 come see me when Low plays" 
 
 so i went to see him again 
 he should be my new best friend 
 running so romantically 
 down the street for me. 

 so he said he'd write or call 
 cuz i'd be touring in the fall 
 he said he wanted me to move 
 but that just won't do

 i never knew you and i know you now 
 i don't know how

 you'd sit on your house, you're writing out your will 
 he'd be there holding your baby, and i'd be there holding him still 
 he said "let me take you out so you can have some fun, 
 but can we take your car cause i don't have one" 
 
 this is like 
 a car crash 
 it's in my car 
 and he's driving. 
 he said "let's go for a ride 
 i'll take you anywhere you wanna go" 
 i asked if maybe i could drive 
 he said no 
 
 he'd be there holding your baby and i'd be there paying the bills
 
 he said let me take you out so 
 but can we take your car cause i don't have one 
 you can have some fun 
 but can we take your car cause i don't have one

 "Long Island"

 you're pretty dreamy for a boy from long island 
 you should come to see me on my western horizon 
 seems as though it's cause we're never meant to meet 
 but i just look at you and know you're pretty sweet 

 i want to set a place for you at my table 
 we can sit forever watching reruns on cable 
 take you driving in my brother's beat old car 
 sharing a cigarette and wish upon a star together 

 so you say you like my shirt 
 (i like your shirt) 
 and you say you've got a lot just like them 
 (i've got a lot just like them) 
 and i hear you wrote a song about me 
 by definition, a crush must hurt 
 and they do 
 and they do 
 just like the one i have on you.

 "Hawthorne"

 driving 
 looking for your parents house 
 striving 
 to find a piece of you 
 and i saw a punk rock show 
 in a car garage 
 and i saw you. 

 trying 
 to be strong for you and myself 
 i was dying 
 to get a piece of this 
 and i saw a punk rock show 
 in a car garage 
 and i saw you as a child 
 visiting while 
 i saw you. 

 and i saw a punk rock show 
 in a car garage 
 and i saw you as a child
 isn't it wild
 i saw a punk rock show 
 in a car garage 
 and i saw you. 
 a dream come true (i saw) 
 a dream come true (i saw)

 "Did You Ever" 

 did you ever 
 climb to the top of a tree 
 and fall down 
 and carve initials in for me to see 
 did you ever 
 did you want to 

 did you ever 
 climb to the top of a tree 
 and fall down 
 carve initials in for me to see 
 did you ever 
 did you want to 

 did you ever 
 fall in love with a small girl 
 while all she wanted was a baby 
 and maybe both meant it 
 did you ever 

 he said "here's what i'll do 
 i'll split myself in two 
 and that way you can be with me 
 and i can learn to be with you" 

 did you ever 
 pinch her cheeks and call her plum
 she was sweet 
 and spicy and spoiled really young 
 did you ever 
 did you want to 

 he said "here's what i'll do 
 i'll split myself in two 
 and that way you can be with me 
 and i can learn to be with you 
 i can learn to be with you 
 i can learn to be with you 
 i can learn to be with you" 

 did you ever? did you want to?


 "Cowboy Hat"

 i picked a cookie from the wrong batch 
 i found an egg unable to hatch 
 i started a fire but i could not find a match 

 cause you wore a cowboy hat 
 in the middle of the highway 
 a cowboy hat 
 fingers flying everywhere 
 a cowboy hat 
 and your middle finger pointed at me 

 i saw a goldfish swimming downstream 
 i picked an orange from the wrong tree 
 you're the most valuable player, but i've chosen the wrong team

 cause you wore a cowboy hat 
 in the middle of the highway 
 a cowboy hat 
 fingers flying everywhere 
 a cowboy hat 
 and your middle finger pointed at me 

 cause you wore a cowboy hat 
 in the middle of the highway 
 a cowboy hat 
 fingers flying everywhere 
 a cowboy hat 
 and your middle fingers pointed at me 
 a cowboy hat 
 lying in the desert 
 a cowboy hat 
 soaking in the gutter 
 a cowboy hat 
 and your middle fingers pointed at me 


 "Until The Day I Die" 

 it's been goodnight 
 it's been goodbye 
 it's been so long that 
 i might cry 
 
 one drunken kiss 
 a drunken lie 
 hung over mornings 
 and a sobering cry 
 
 i've never given back to you 
 all the pain you've put me through 
 and i've never given back to you 
 
 a rainy day and a beautiful night 
 a hung jury and a bed uptight 
 i've been alone through the nights 
 i'll be alone until the day i die 
 
 cause i've never given back to you 
 all the shame you've put me through 
 and i've never given back to you 
 all the love in the world
 to give to a little girl 
 no matter how hard i've tried 
 this will be until the day i die. 

 i've never given never give to you 
 and i've never given never give to you 
 you 
 you 
 you 
 you 
 you 
 it's been goodnight 
 it's been goodbye 
 it's been so long that i might cry


 "Lazy Line-painter Jane"
 by Belle & Sebastian

 working the village shop
 putting a poster up
 dreaming of anything
 dreaming of the time when you were free from all the trouble you're in
 
 in the mud, on your knees
 trying hard not to please
 anyone, all the time
 being a rebel's fine
 but you go all the way to being brutal

 you will have a boy tonight
 you will have a boy tonight
 on the first bus out of town
 on the first bus out of town
 
 let's see your kit for games
 all the girls look the same
 you are challenging style for running miles
 you're running miles in some boys jumper
 
 boo to the business world!
 you know a girl who's tax free on her back and making
 plenty cash
 while you are working for the joy of giving

 you will have a boy tonight
 you will have a boy tonight
 and you hope that she will see
 and you hope that she will see
 
 you are in two minds
 tossing a coin to decide whether you should tell your mum
 about a dose of thrush you got while you were licking railings

 but you read in a book
 that you got free in Boots
 there are lotions, there are potions
 you can take it to hide your shame from all those prying eyes

 Lazy Jane, all the time
 painting lines
 you are sleeping at bus stops
 wondering how you got your name
 and what you're going to do about it

 you will have a boy tonight
 you will have a boy tonight
 and you hope that she will see
 and you hope that she will see
 

 "America", the PR song from West Side Story
 Lyrics by Stephen Sondheim
 Music by Leonard Bernstien
 Appreciated by Mogel

 Rosalia
 Puerto Rico,  You lovely island,
 Island of tropical breezes.
 Always the pineapples growing,
 Always the coffee blossom blowing.

 Anita
 Puerto Rico,  You ugly island,
 Island of tropic diseases.
 Always the hurricanes blowing,
 Always the population growing,
 And the money owing,
 And the babies crying,
 And the bullets flying.
 I like the island Manhattan.
 Smoke on your pipe and put that in!

 Girls sans Rosalia
 I like to be in America!
 O.K. by me in America!
 Ev'rything free in America
 For a small fee in America!
 
 R: I like the city of San Juan.
 A: I know a boat you can get on.
 R: Hundreds of flowers in full bloom.
 A: Hundreds of people in each room!
 
 Girls sans Rosalia
 Automobile in America.
 Chromium steel in America.
 Wirespoke wheel in American,
 Very big deal in America!
 
 R: I'll drive a Buick through San Juan
 A: If there's a road you can drive on.
 R: I'll give my cousins a free ride.
 A: How you get all of them inside?
 
 Girls sans Rosalia
 Immigrants goes to America.
 Many hellos in America.
 Nobody knows in American,
 Puerto Rico's in America!
 
 R: I'll bring a T.V. to San Juan.
 A: If there's a current to turn on!
 R: I'll give them new washing machine.
 A: What have they got there to keep clean?
 
 Girls sans Rosalia
 I like the shores of America.
 Comfort is yours in America.
 Knobs on doors in American,
 Wall-to-wall floors in America!
 
 R: When I will go back to San Juan.
 A: When you will shut up and get gone!
 R: Ev'ryone there will give big cheer!
 A: Ev'ryone there will have moved here!
 

 "First We Take Manhattan"
 by Leonard Cohen

 They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom
 For trying to change the system from within
 I'm coming now, I'm coming to reward them
 First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

 I'm guided by a signal in the heavens
 I'm guided by this birthmark on my skin
 I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons
 First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
 
 I'd really like to live beside you, baby
 I love your body and your spirit and your clothes
 But you see that line there moving through the station?
 I told you, I told you, told you, I was one of those

 Ah you loved me as a loser, but now you're worried that I just might win
 You know the way to stop me, but you don't have the discipline
 How many nights I prayed for this, to let my work begin
 First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

 I don't like your fashion business mister
 And I don't like these drugs that keep you thin
 I don't like what happened to my sister
 First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

 I'd really like to live beside you, baby ...
 
 And I thank you for those items that you sent me
 The monkey and the plywood violin
 I practiced every night, now I'm ready
 First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
 
 I am guided
 
 Ah remember me, I used to live for music
 Remember me, I brought your groceries in
 Well it's Father's Day and everybody's wounded
 First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin


 "Mack the Knife"
 by Bobby Darin

 Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear
 And he shows them, pearly white
 Just a jackknife has MacHeath, dear
 And he keeps it out of sight
 
 When the shark bites with his teeth, dear
 Scarlet billows start to spread
 Fancy gloves, though, wears MacHeath, dear
 So there's not a trace of red

 From a tugboat by the river
 A cement bag's dropping down
 The cement's just for the weight dear
 Bet you Mackie's back in town.
 
 On the sidewalk Sunday morning
 Lies a body oozing lif
 SOmeon's sneaking 'round the corner
 Is the someone Mack the Knife?

 Louie Miller disappeared, dear
 After drawing out his cash
 And MacHeath spends like a sailor
 Did our boy do something rash?

 Sukey Tawdry, Jenny Diver
 Polly Peachum, Lucy Brown
 Oh the line forms on the right dear
 Now that Mackie's back in town.

 
 "Scenester"
 by Spiderbait

 "Like people here are like really friendly... like, like... people have
     been great"
 "They're like um"
 "Like, like I had no idea"
 "Like totally tranquil"
 "Like, like!..."
 "Like... like I thought it was just like..."
 "Like wow you..."
 "Like... that's all you know, like I'll tell you about it when I get
     home"

 Hey look at me I'm a scenester!
 Hey look at me I'm a scenester!
 Hey look at me I'm a scenester!
 Can't get away from me scenester
 
 Go to all the rock and roll places
 Seen with all the rock and roll faces
 I'm gonna be a good bassist
 When I get myself a new tattoo
 
 Buy all the records that they do
 Go to all the shows that they do
 Wear all the clothes that they do
 I don't give a shit I don't have to

 Hate rock stars that are plastic
 'Specially when they're geriatric
 Now they think that kids are fantastic
 They're so young and cute and they're so cool

 Feel so good I'm a scenester
 Feel so good I'm a scenester
 Feel so good I'm a scenester
 Can't stop me now I'm a scenester

 Deep down inside I'm a racist
 Deep down inside I'm a sexist
 Don't know much but I know that
 If you had Docs like me you'd be cool too

 "Fly Me to the Moon"
 by Bart Howard

 Fly me to the moon
 And let me play among the stars
 Let me see what spring is like
 On Jupiter and Mars
 In other words hold my hand
 In other words darling kiss me

 Fill my life with song
 And let me sing forevermore
 You are all I hope for
 All I worship and adore
 In other words please be true
 In other words I love you


 "Minnie the Moocher"
 by Cab Calloway

 Folks here's a story 'bout Minnie the Moocher
 She was a red hot hoochie-coocher
 She was the roughest toughest frail
 But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale

 Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi.... (Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi)
 Whoa-oh-oho-oh-oh-oho.... (Whoa-oh-oho-oh-oh-oho)
 Ee-de-ee-de-ee-de-ee.... (Ee-de-ee-de-ee-de-ee)
 Way-hey-ey-ay-ee-ay-ay-ay.... (Way-hey-ey-ay-ee-ay-ay-ay)

 She messed around with a bloke named Smokey
 She loved him though he was Coke-y
 He took her down to Chinatown
 And he showed her how to kick the gong(?) around

 Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi.... (Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi)
 Whoa-oh-oho-oh-oh-oho.... (Whoa-oh-oho-oh-oh-oho)
 Yeah-eah-aa-aheah-ah-ah-ah.... (Yeah-eah-aa-aheah-ah-ah-ah)
 Whoa--ioh--ioh--iohh.... (Whoa--ioh--ioh--iohh)

 She had a dream about the king of Sweden
 He gave her things that she was needin'
 He gave her a home built of gold 'n steel
 A diamond car ... with big pl-atinum wheels

 Hi-de-i-de-i-de-i-de-iii.... (Hi-de-i-de-i-de-i-de-iii)
 Oh-de-oh-de-oh-de-oh-de-O-oh.... (Oh-de-oh-de-oh-de-oh-de-O-oh)

 A-boo-rrigi-boo-rrigi-boo-rigi-ay.... (A-boo-rrigi-boo-rrigi-boo-rigi-ay)

 He gave her a townhouse and his racing horses
 Each meal she ate was a dozen courses
 She had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes
 She sat around and counted them a million times

 Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-i.... (Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-i)
 Whoahohohohohohooooooh.... (Whoahohohohohohooooooh)
 Whay-hey-heey-heey-hey-a-ay.... (Whay-hey-heey-heey-hey-a-ay)

 "Mr. Frump In The Iron Lung"
 by "Weird Al" Yankovic

 I visit Mr. Frump in the hospital.
 I see him 'most every day.
 And when I see Mr. Frump in his iron lung,
 This is what I hear him say:
 (iron lung sounds)
 
 Ya know, Mr. Frump is my very best friend.
 He's never a chump or a tease.
 He never tells me lies, and best of all,
 He never disagrees.
 
 I bring him candy and flowers every afternoon.
 Sit down by his side and say "Hi".
 And then I ask him his opinion of the world situation,
 And I wait for Mr. Frump's reply.
 And Mr. Frump would say:
 (iron lung sounds)
 
 Well, unfortunately, soon it came to be
 Mr. Frump's dying day.
 So now I bring to you the very last thing
 That Mr. Frump had to say:
 (rapid iron lung sounds)
 
 A-men!
 

 "One"
 by Metallica

 I can't remember anything
 Can't tell if this is true or dream
 Deep down inside i feel to scream
 This terrible silence stops me

 Now that the war is through with me
 I'm waking up i can not see
 That there is not much left of me
 Nothing is real but pain now

 Hold my breath as i wish for death
 Oh please god, wake me

 Back in the womb its much too real
 In pumps life that i must feel
 But can't look forward to reveal
 Look to the time when i'll live

 Fed through the tube that sticks in me
 Just like a wartime novelty
 Tied to machines that make me be
 Cut this life off from me

 Hold my breath as i wish for death
 Oh please god,wake me
 Now the world is gone i'm just one
 Oh god,help me hold my breath as i wish for death
 Oh please god help me

 Darkness imprisoning me
     All that i see
     Absolute horror
     I cannot live
     I cannot die
     Trapped in myself
     Body my holding cell

 Landmine has taken my sight
     Taken my speech
     Taken my hearing
     Taken my arms
     Taken my legs
     Taken my soul
     Left me with life in hell


 "One"
 by U2

 Is it getting better,
 Or do you feel the same,
 Will it make it easier on you now,
 You got someone to blame,
 
 You say, one love, one life,
 When it's one need in the night,
 One love, we get to share it,
 Leaves you baby if you don't care for it,
 
 Did I disappoint you,
 Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
 You act like you never had love,
 And you want me to go without,
 
 Well it's too late, tonight,
 To drag the past out into the light,
 We're one, but we're not the same,
 We got to carry each other, carry each other,
 
 Have you come here for forgiveness?
 Have you come to raise the dead?
 Have you come here to play Jesus
 To the lepers in your head?
 
 Did I ask too much,
 More than a lot?
 You gave me nothing,
 Now it's all I got,
 
 We're one, but we're not the same,
 Well we hurt each other, now we do it again,
 
 You say, love is a temper,
 Love a higher love,
 Love is a temper,
 Love the higher love,
 
 You ask me to enter,
 Well then you make me crawl,
 And I can't be holding on to what you got,
 When all you got is hurt,
 
 One love, one blood,
 One life, you got to do what you should,
 One life with each other,
 Sisters, brothers,
 
 One life but we're not the same,
 We get to carry each other, carry each other,
 One, one.


 "A Perfect Government"
 by NOFX

 Even if it's easy to be free
 What's your definition of freedom?
 And who the fuck are you, anyway?
 Who the fuck are they?
 Who the fuck am I to say?
 What the fuck is really going on?

 How did the cat get so fat?
 Why does the family die?
 Do you care why?
 'Cause there hasn't been a sign
 Of anything gettin' better
 In the ghetto

 People's fed up
 But when they get up
 You point your fuckin' finger
 You racist, you bigot
 But that's not the problem
 Now is it?

 It's all about the money
 Political power is takin
 Protecting the rich denying the poor

 Yeah, they love to watch the war from the
 White house
 And I wonder how can they sleep at night?
 How can they sleep at night?

 How did the cat get so fat?
 How did the cat get so fat?
 How did the cat get so fat?
 How did the cat get so fat?


 "It's No Good"
 by Depeche Mode

 I'm going to take my time
 I have all the time in the world
 To make you mine
 It is written in the stars above
 The gods decree
 You'll be right here by my side
 Right next to me
 You can run, but you cannot hide

 Don't say you want me
 Don't say you need me
 Don't say you love me
 It's understood
 Don't say you're happy
 Out there without me
 I know you can't be
 'cause it's no good

 I'll be fine
 I'll be waiting patiently
 Till you see the signs
 And come running to my open arms
 When will you realise
 Do we have to wait till our worlds collide
 Open up your eyes
 You can't turn back the tide

 Don't say you want me
 Don't say you need me
 Don't say you love me
 It's understood
 Don't say you're happy
 Out there without me
 I know you can't be
 'cause it's no good

 I'm going to take my time
 I have all the time in the world
 To make you mine
 It is written in the stars above

 Don't say you want me
 Don't say you need me
 Don't say you love me
 It's understood
 Don't say you're happy
 Out there without me
 I know you can't be
 'cause it's no good

 "Chopsticks"

 I met him at a party and he
 Told me how to drive him home.
 He said he liked to do it backwards.
 I said that's just fine with me.
 That way we can fuck and watch TV.

 It was four a.m. and the light was gray
 Like it always is in paperbacks.
 He asked if I liked playing jacks.
 I told him that I was good to sixes,
 But all hell broke loose after that.

 I told him that I knew Julia Roberts
 When I was twelve at summer camp.
 We didn't say anything after that.
 I dropped him off and I drove on home
 'Cause secretly, I'm timid.


 "Supernova"

 I have looked all over the place,
 But you have got my favorite face.
 Your eyelashes sparkle like gilded grass
 and your lips are sweet and slippery
 Like a cherub's bare wet ass ...

 'Cause you're a human supernova,
 A solar superman.
 You're an angel with wings of fire,
 A flying, giant friction blast.

 You walk in clouds of glitter
 and the sun reflects your eyes.
 And every time the wind blows,
 I can smell you in the sky.
 Your kisses are as wicked as an F-16
 And you fuck like a volcano
 and you're everything to me...

 'Cause you're a human supernova,
 A solar superman
 You're an angel with wings of fire,
 A flying, giant friction blast
 You're a giant, flying friction blast

 'Cause you're a human supernova,
 A solar superman,
 You're an angel with wings of fire,
 A flying, giant friction blast ...

 "Support System"

 I don't need a support system
 Lifting me into prop-position
 What I need is a man of action, I need my attraction to you
 Driving me down all those dangerous avenues
 Lions and tigers tearing at their food.

 (whistle break)
 I know the gossip
 Flies around at breakfast
 One of them rings in your hand
 Where the fuck do you get off thinking
 I was there at the party 'cause
 All of my friends feed me evil reasons
 Why you and I should not be friends...
 Let's think this whole thing through,
 Tell me, just what the hell is a lover supposed to do?
 I got the wrong reaction
 A slap in the face from you.

 (whistle break:
 This is such a stupid picture,
 Wrap me in a steak Why don't you
 Throw it in the panther cage and
 Maybe then I'll like you better (No Way))

 I don't need a support system
 Lifting me into prop-position
 What they make is a separation of beauty from attitude
 What satisfaction is left when all you do tells everyone
 You're acting untrue

 (whistle break:
 This is such a stupid picture,
 Light a cigarette why don't you
 Stub it in a carburator,
 Maybe then you'll sell me something
 (No Way))

 I don't need a support system
 Put your hand on my heart and listen
 What I need is a dedication to last me all the way through
 Pointing the finger, I'm counting on loving you
 Over and above the passion
 I'm connected to you.


 "X-Ray Man"

 As far as I know, baby,
 You can see
 As far as I go, funky baby,
 Digging deep inside of me...
 (uh uh uh uh uh uh x 4)

 As far as I know, sister,
 I'm alright
 As far as I know, funky lady,
 I'm coming home tonight...
 (you can see... through the smoke...)

 You're an X-ray man
 You got X-ray eyes
 [L] This is no reflection on you which is what I see inside
 [R] Why don't you put on your two-way sombrero and leave
 (uh uh uh uh uh uh x 4)

 You're an X-ray man
 You got white wall tires
 Iodine tan
 Cheap unpleasant desires

 You're an X-ray man
 Got an X-rated mind
 You're not satisfied looking at me, you're always
 Checking out the girl behind

 You're an X-ray man
 You got secret plans
 For me.


 "Shane"

 I know that it was the night
 The war broke out because
 You and I were driving around

 You were doing a story
 About if people understood
 What had happened to their world
 Tonight
 In bed
 Sleeping
 The world tonight
 In bed
 Asleep

 You said that you were in touch
 With the draft resistors
 In case the big boys called you up
 You're gonna have to let 'em
 Dick you around
 But don't let 'em make
 You do
 What you can't live with
 Tonight
 In bed
 With me
 Sleeping

 You looked like you were just a little kid
 Shane, I said, you've got to watch your ass

 You've gotta have fear in your heart (x 8)
 Fear in your heart.


 "Nashville"

 They don't know
 What they like so much about it
 They just go
 For any shiny old bauble
 And nobody sparkles like you...

 But I can't imagine it in better terms
 Than naked, half awake, about to shave and go to work...
 And I'm starting to think it could happen to me like it did to you
 And I'm starting to actually feel it seep through the
 Slick divide now
 I don't crack the door too far for anyone who's pushing too hard on me

 They don't know
 What they like so much about it
 Maybe it goes on the other side of the hallway,
 The writing's so small from here...

 But I can't imagine it in better terms
 Than naked, half awake, about to shave and go to work ...
 I won't decorate my love (x 6)


 "Go West"

 Safe on
 The interstate
 New York
 Is three thousand miles away
 And I'm not looking forward to following through
 But it's better than always running back into you
 I've closed my eyes and my bank account
 And gone west, young man

 Take off
 The parking brake
 Go coasting
 Into a different state
 And I'm not looking forward to missing you
 But I must have something better to do
 I've got to tear my life apart
 And go west, young man

 And it feels like I've got something to prove,
 But in some ways it's just something to do
 My friend's turn me around and say
 You go west, young man

 Stepping
 Down off my platform shoes
 Sixty-
 Nine in the afternoon
 And I'm waiting for someone in the know
 Like Pirnir tells me on the radio ed. note: this is the way it's spelled
 on the lyrics sheet. It may be "Pirner," as in Dave
 Says take it from someone who's been there before
 You go west, young man

 And I'm looking for somebody to do
 My thinking for me 'till I come through
 The state-line highway sign says
 You have gone west, young man
 And it feels like I've got something to prove
 But in some ways it's just something to do
 The state-line highway sign says
 You have gone west, young man


 "Cinco De Mayo"

 Cinco de Mayo.
 Blow out, denial.
 It wasn't fun this time, letting you go.
 What if I never, a bullet forever,
 Held out my hand to you, we wouldn't have known
 Beautiful flow,
 Absolute measure, I ain't no pleasure hound
 Bus' out of control, plowing the road.
 Out on a bender, just Alice falling down
 A deepening hole.
 I'd never been to Rome until you smiled.
 You're about as old and piled.
 I used to pray for snow...
 Now I just wonder what spell I was under,
 Thinking you thought of me as
 Something to hold.
 I'd never been to Rome until you smiled.
 You're about as old and piled.
 Cinco de Mayo.
 Burn-out, Ohio.
 It wasn't me this time, letting you go.


 "Dogs of L.A."
 4
 The canyon air is like a breath of fresh L.A.
 I was a Star Trek crew member
 With my Beatle boots and my Super-8
 And I raced you to the top,
 The camera gets a stuttered shot of
 Me approaching the painted shrine.

 I kissed the Buddha and made him cry
 I kissed the Buddha and made him cry,
 Georgie, I'm your friend!
 And the shit brown reservoir
 Is a testament to the dogs of L.A.
 They hold the place like the Mafia and say,
 Run me round again.

 The sawed off tree-trunks stand among the living palms
 You were beaming as I focused in and I panned along
 And I raced you to the top
 Kicking snakes up from dusty rocks
 Young Abe Vigoda plays Frankenstein

 I kissed the Buddha and made him cry
 I kissed the Buddha and made him cry,
 Georgie, I'm your friend!
 And the shit brown reservoir
 Is a testament to the dogs of L.A., they
 Hold the place like the Mafia and say,
 Run me round again.

 I wanna go again.
 And the shit brown reservoir
 Is a testament to the dogs of L.A.
 They hold the place like the Mafia and say,
 Run me round again.


 "Whip-Smart"

 I'm gonna tell my son to grow up pretty as the grass is green and
 Whip-smart as the English Channel's wide.
 And I'm gonna tell my son to keep his money in his mattress
 And his watch on any hand between his thighs.

 And I'm gonna lock my son up in a tower 'til I write my whole life story
 On the back of his big brown eyes.
 When they do the double dutch, that's them dancing. (x 4)

 And I'm gonna tell my son to join a circus so that death is cheap and
 Games are just another way of life.
 And I'm gonna tell my son to be a prophet of mistakes because for
 Every truth, there are half a million lies.

 And I'm gonna lock my son up in a tower
 'Til he learns to let his hair down far enough to climb outside.
 When they do the double dutch, that's them dancing. (x 4)


 "Jealousy"

 He's got a million dollar car
 He's got a thirty-seven year old guitar
 He's got a family who deals heroin,
 you're on the edge of your chair and then
 You feel it
 He's looking at you
 He's laughing at you
 It's happening.

 I can't, I can't believe it.
 But it's here on the pages I'm reading
 It's all I can do to conceal my feelings of jealousy... jealousy...

 I know it's just a drawer of photographs
 They're ex-girlfriends, I try to remember that
 I don't wanna look, but I'm already hooked on jealousy... jealousy...

 I can't believe you had a life before me
 I can't believe they let you run around free
 Just putting your body wherever it seemed like a good idea
 What a good idea:

 Standing
 On the corner
 Watching
 The ladies
 Pass by
 Imagining me behind your eyes
 And then what did I see?
 I saw hips, I saw thighs
 I saw secret positions that we never try
 I saw jealousy
 I saw jealousy
 I can't, I can't believe it
 But it's here in this place and I see it
 It's all I can do to conceal my feelings of jealousy... jealousy...

 Standing
 On the mud flats
 Watching
 The salmon
 Fly
 Wonder if I'll ever bury the hatchet inside.
 Imagining me behind your eyes
 And then what did I see?
 I saw hips, I saw thighs
 I saw secret positions that we never try
 I saw jealousy
 I saw jealousy

 I can't believe you had a life before me
 I can't believe they let you run around free
 Just putting your body wherever it seemed like a good idea
 What a good idea:


 "Crater Lake"

 Once you've left a lonely rage on its own, it grows.
 And dynamite stuffed in a mailbox doesn't smoke until it blows...

 And oh, all the tears
 In four tiny years
 Well look at me, I'm frightening my friends...
 You better roll me...

 I bought a map of the moon.
 There's a crater with my name on it and a really good view
 There I was, getting drunk in your room
 Because I wanted to throw my weight around

 And oh, all the tears
 In four tiny years
 Oh look at me, I'm frightening my friends...
 You better roll me home (x 3)


 "Alice Springs"

 See the sun rise
 So loud,
 This whole town
 Gets drowned out.
 Sky writing with the sweep of a flashlight
 I'm driving over that way
 Some pot of gold, it's just a carpeting store on opening day.

 See the moon rise
 So slow,
 And shallow,
 It burns halos in my eyes.
 It's harder to swallow,
 It's harder to breathe,
 So many opals, nobody here knows what to believe.
 They've got me underground.


 "May Queen"

 Don't be fooled by him he's fine.
 Rock and roll Ken doll,
 He's a national end-all,
 He's an on and off friend of mine ...

 Where have I been?
 Got any what?
 Who have I seen?
 I spy a May queen.
 You were miles above me,
 Girls in your arms.
 The changing of her majesty's guard is truly amazing.

 Got any what?
 Disease, hashish, a mind,
 Do I have any what?

 Where have I been?
 Got any what?
 Who have I seen?
 I spy a May queen.
 You were miles above me,
 Girls in your arms.
 You could have planted a farm
 With all of them hay-seeds....


 "Your Gold Teeth"
 by Steely Dan

 Got a feeling I've been here before
 Watching as you cross the killing floor
 You know you'll have to pay it all
 You'll pay today or pay tomorrow
 You fasten up your beaded gown
 Then you try to tie me down
 Do you work it out one by one
 Or played in combination
 You throw out your gold teeth
 Do you see how they roll
 I have seen your iron and your brass
 Can't you see it shine behind the glass
 Your fortune is your roving eye
 Your mouth and legs
 Your gift for the runaround
 Torture is the main attraction
 I don't need that kind of action
 You don't have to dance for me
 I've seen your dance before
 Do you throw out your gold teeth
 Do you see how they roll
 
 Tobacco they grow in Peking
 In the Year of the Locust
 You'll see a sad thing
 Even Cathy Berberian knows
 There's one roulade she can't sing
 Dumb luck my friend
 Won't suck me in this time
 
 Got a feeling I've been here before
 Won't you let me help you find the door
 All you got to do is use
 Your silver shoes
 A gift for the runaround
 Use your knack darlin'
 Take one step back darlin'
 There ain't nothing in Chicago
 For a monkey woman to do
 Do you throw out your gold teeth
 Do you see how they roll
 

 "wild horses"
 by Prefab Sprout

 through the rails i spied
 your ponytail, i tried
 with sugar cubes- and they're OK
 but i don't think
 I'll catch you that way
 i hate myself, cuz you're so cool
 with your mocking eyes
 "won't you look at the old fool?"
 
 wild horses-- i want to have
 wild horses-- i want to have
 wild horses
 
 look at you - unflawed
 now look at me - plain overawed
 grace and looks take no credit for
 girl you're young
 and they're part of the score
 like the chemicals at war in me
 til i'm a wolf with an eye for the ponies
 
 wild horses-- i want to have
 wild horses-- i want to have
 wild horses
 
 i want extra time to play
 afternoons in the hay
 it's a sorry way for a man to feel
 but sentimental is part of the deal
 i hate myself because it shows how
 i'm a fool for your rodeo
 
 wild horses-- i want to have
 wild horses-- i want to have
 wild horses-- i want to have you

 "I Am My Own Grandpa"

 many many years ago when i was 23
 i was married to a widow that was purdy as can be
 this widow had a grownup daughter who had hair of red
 my father fell in love with her and soon the two were wed

 this made my dad my son-in-law and changed my very life
 for my daughter was my mother because she was my father's wife
 to complicate the matter even though it brought me joy
 i soon became the father of a bouncing baby boy

 my little baby then became a brother-in-law to dad
 and so he became my uncle though it made me very sad
 for if he is my uncle then it also makes him brother
 to the widows grown-up daughter who is, of course, my own stepmother

 i'm my own grandpa
 i'm my own grandpa
 it's so funny, i know!
 but it really is so...
 i'm my own grandpa

 my father's wife then had a son that kept them on the run
 and so he became my grandchild because he was my daughter's son
 my wife is now my mother's mother and it makes me blue
 because although she is my wife, she's my grandmother too

 now if my wife is my grandmother, i am her grandchild
 and everytime i think of this, it nearly drives me wild
 this has got to be the strangest thing i ever saw
 as husband of my grandmother, i am my own grandpa!

 i'm my own grandpa hep hep hep
 i'm my own grandpa oi oi oi
 it's so funny, i know!
 but it really is so... hep
 i'm my own grandpa


 "Driving Up The Ceiling"
 by Spiderbait

 Driving
 Up the ceiling
 Wheeling (??)
 All I'm meaning (??)
 Dreaming
 Of the night time
 Thinking
 To a new sign
 As we're taking
 Sunshine

 Waiting (??)
 Saw the moon shine
 Slinking (??)
 Into tree tops (time??) (??)
 You're a comet (??)
 Waiting (??)
 For the big time (??)


 "Sad Songs (Say So Much)"
 by Elton John

 Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
 And ironing out the rough spots
 Is the hardest part when memories remain
 And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
 `Cause from the lips of some old singer
 We can share the troubles we already know

 Turn them on, turn them on
 Turn on those sad songs
 When all hope is gone
 Why don't you tune in and turn them on

 They reach into your room
 Just feel their gentle touch
 When all hope is gone
 Sad songs say so much

 If someone else is suffering enough to write it down
 When every single word makes sense
 Then it's easier to have those songs around
 The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
 and it feels so good to hurt so bad
 And suffer just enough to sing the blues

 Sad songs, they say
 Sad songs, they say
 Sad songs, they say
 Sad songs, they say so much


 "It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over"
 by Lenny Kravitz

 Here we are still together
 We are one
 So much time wasted
 Playing games with love

 Chorus:
 So many tears I've cried
 So much pain inside
 But baby it ain't over 'til it's over
 So many years we've tried
 To keep our love alive
 But baby it ain't over 'til it's over

 How many times
 Did we give up
 But we always worked things out
 And all my doubts and fears
 Kept me wondering
 If I'd always be in love

 Chorus
 Chorus
 Chorus


 "Perry Mason"
 by Ozzy Osbourne

 On his way to dinner when it took him by suprise
 And with one pull of the trigger he would vanish overnight
 Dancing by the roadside, holding on for dear life
 The a gun from out of nowhere made a widow of his wife

 I don't mind, single file down the runway
 Feelin' fine, and I'll see you my friend
 Over and over again

 Who can we get on this case?
 We need Perry Mason
 Someone to put you in place
 Calling Perry Mason

 Riding painted horses, oh the kids the love it so
 You can see it on their faces, how they love the wind to blow
 Minding my own business liku my mama always said
 But if I don't try to help'um they could wind up on the front page

 I don't mind, draw the line then draw me an arrow
 Feelin' fine, then I'll see you my friend
 Over and over again

 Who can we get on this case?
 We need Perry Mason
 Someone to put you in place
 Calling Perry Mason

 Wake me when it's over, tell me it's all right
 Just keep on talking baby, I've been doing this all night
 How much did you give me, tell me it'll be all right

 Who can we get on this case?
 We need Perry Mason
 Someone to put you in place
 Calling Perry Mason, again, again, again, again


 "Mercy In You"
 by Depeche Mode

 You know what I need
 When my heart bleeds
 I suffer from greed
 A longing to feed
 On the mercy in you

 I can't conceal
 The way I'm healed
 The pleasure I feel
 When I have to deal
 With the mercy in you

 I would do it all again
 Lose my way and fall again
 Just so I could call again
 On the mercy in you

 When here in my mind
 I feel inclined
 To wrongly treat you unkind
 I have faith I will find
 The mercy in you

 I would lose my way again
 Be led hopelessly astray again
 Just so I could pray again
 For the mercy in you

 When here in my mind
 I have been blind
 Emotionally behind
 I have faith I will find
 The mercy in you


 "The Analog Kid"
 by Rush

 A hot and windy August afternoon
 Has the trees in constant motion
 With a flash of silver leaves
 As they're rocking in the breeze

 The boy lies in the grass with one blade
 Stuck between his teeth
 A vague sensation quickens
 In his young and restless heart
 And a bright and nameless vision
 Has him longing to depart

 Chorus
 You move me
 You move me
 With your buildings and your eyes
 Autumn woods and winter skies
 You move me
 You move me
 Open sea and city lights
 Busy streets and dizzy heights
 You call me
 You call me

 The fawn-eyed girl with sun-browned legs
 Dances on the edge of his dream
 And her voice rings in his ears
 Like the music of the spheres
 
 The boy lies in the grass, unmoving
 Staring at the sky
 His mother starts to call him
 As a hawk goes soaring by
 The boy pulls down his baseball cap
 And covers up his eyes

 Chorus
 
 Too many hands on my time
 Too many feelings
 Too many things on my mind
 When I leave I don't know
 What I'm hoping to find
 When I leave I don't know
 What I'm leaving behind...


 "Speak To Me"
 by Dream Theater

 I remember when we were so young
 You embraced my fears and made me strong
 Never did you actually hold my hand
 Your silence no one else would understand

 Did you fall?
 Did you crawl?
 Will you open up at all?
 Did you hear things you fear?
 Did I make it clear?

 Tell me what you're thinking
 Tell me what you're thinking
 Tell me what you're feeling inside
 Tell me what you're thinking
 Tell me what you're thinking
 Tell me what you're feeling inside

 Do you like the clothes she wears today
 Colliding love affair against a shade
 Often times I wish she'd speak to me
 Her holy open book, a world revealed to see

 Did you fall?
 Did you crawl?
 Will you open up at all?
 Did you hear things you fear?
 Did I make it clear?

 Tell me what you're thinking
 Tell me what you're thinking
 Tell me what you're feeling inside
 Tell me what you're thinking
 Tell me what you're thinking
 Tell me all you're feeling inside

 So easy, easier
 If you spoke to me
 So easy, easier
 Speak to me

 Tell me what you're thinking
 Tell me what you're thinking
 Tell me what you're feeling inside
 Tell me what you're thinking
 Tell me what you're thinking
 Tell me all you're feeling inside

 "Drive"

 Smack, crack, bushwhacked.
 Tie another one to the racks, baby.

 Hey kids, rock and roll.
 Nobody tells you where to go, baby.

 What if I ride? What if you walk?
 What if you rock around the clock?
 Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
 What if you did? What if you walk?
 What if you tried to get off, baby?

 Hey, kids, where are you?
 Nobody tells you what to do, baby.
 Hey kids, shake a leg.
 Maybe you're crazy in the head, baby.
 
 Maybe you did. Maybe you walked.
 Maybe you rocked around the clock.
 Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
 Maybe I ride. Maybe you walk.
 Maybe I drive to get off, baby.

 Hey kids, shake a leg.
 Maybe you're crazy in the head, baby.
 
 Ollie, ollie.
 Ollie ollie ollie.
 Ollie ollie in come free, baby.

 Hey, kids, where are you?
 Nobody tells you what to do, baby.
 
 Smack, crack. Shack-a-lack.
 Tie another one to your back, baby.
 
 Hey kids, rock and roll.
 Nobody tells you where to go, baby.
 
 Maybe you did. Maybe you walk.
 Maybe you rock around the clock
 Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
 Maybe I ride. Maybe you walk.
 Maybe I drive to get off, baby.
 
 Hey kids, where are you?
 Nobody tells you what to do, baby.
 
 Hey kids, rock and roll.
 Nobody tells you where to go, baby, baby, baby.


 "Try Not To Breathe"

 I will try not to breathe. I can hold my head still with my hands at my
     knees.
 These eyes are the eyes of the old, shiver and fold.

 I will try not to breathe.
 This decision is mine. I have lived a full life
 and these are the eyes that I want you to remember. Oh.
 
 I need something to fly over my grave again.
 I need something to breathe.
 
 I will try not to burden you.
 I can hold these inside. I will hold my breath
 until all these shivers subside,
 just look in my eyes.

 I will try not to worry you.
 I have seen things that you will never see.
 Leave it to memory me. I shudder to breathe.
 
 I want you to remember. Oh. (you will never see)
 I need something to fly (something to fly)
 over my grave again. (you will never see)
 I need something to breathe. (something to breathe)
 Baby, don't shiver now.
 Why do you shiver now? (I will see things you will never see)
 I need something to fly (something to fly)
 over my grave again. (I will see things you will never see)
 I need something to breathe. Oh. Oh. Oh.

 I will try not to worry you.
 I have seen things that you will never see.
 Leave it to memory me. Don't dare me to breathe.
 
 I want you to remember. Oh. (you will never see)
 I need something to fly (something to fly)
 over my grave again. (you will never see)
 I need something to breathe. (something to breathe)
 Baby, don't shiver now.
 Why do you shiver now? (I will see things you will never see)
 I need something to breathe. (something to breathe - I have seen things
 you will never see)
 I want you to remember.


 "The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight"

 This here is the place I will be staying.
 There isn't a number. You can call the pay phone.
 Let it ring a long, long, long, long time.
 If I don't pick up, hang up, call back, let it ring some more.
 If I don't pick up, pick up... The sidewinder sleeps, sleeps, sleeps in a
     coil
 
 Call me when you try to wake her up. Call me when you try to wake her.
 Call me when you try to wake her up. Call me when you try to wake her.
 Call me when you try to wake her up. Call me when you try to wake her.
 
 There are scratches all around the coin slot
 like a heartbeat, baby trying to wake up,
 but this machine can only swallow money.
 You can't lay a patch by computer design.
 It's just a lot of stupid, stupid signs.
 
 Tell her,
 tell her she can kiss my ass, then laugh and say that you were only kidding.
 That way she'll know that it's really, really, really, really me.
 
 Call me when you try to wake her up. Call me when you try to wake her.
 Call me when you try to wake her up. Call me when you try to wake her.
 Call me when you try to wake her up. Call me when you try to wake her.
 
 Baby, instant soup doesn't really grab me.
 Today I need something more sub-sub-sub-substantial.
 A can of beans or blackeyed peas, some Nescafe and ice,
 a candy bar, a falling star, or a reading of Doctor Seuss;
 
 Call me when you try to wake her up. Call me when you try to wake her.
 Call me when you try to wake her up. Call me when you try to wake her.
 Call me when you try to wake her up. Call me when you try to wake her.
 
 The cat in the hat came back, wrecked a lot of havoc on the way,
 always had a smile and a reason to pretend.
 But their world has flat backgrounds and little need to sleep but to dream.
 The sidewinder sleeps on his back.
 
 Call me when you try to wake her up. Call me when you try to wake her.
 Call me when you try to wake her up. Call me when you try to wake her.
 I can always sleep standing up. Call me when you try to wake her.
 Call me when you try to wake her up. Call me when you try to wake her.
 Call me when you try to wake her up. Call me when you try to wake her.
 I can always sleep standing up. Call me when you try to wake her.
 Call me when you try to wake her up. Call me when you try to wake her.
 I can always sleep standing up. Call me when you try to wake her.
 I can always sleep standing up. Call me when you try to wake her.
 
 We've got to moogie, moogie, move on this one.
 

 "Everybody Hurts"

 When the day is long and the night, the night is yours alone,
 when you're sure you've had enough of this life, well hang on.
 Don't let yourself go, everybody cries and everybody hurts sometimes.

 Sometimes everything is wrong. Now it's time to sing along.
 When your day is night alone, (hold on, hold on)
 if you feel like letting go, (hold on)
 when you think you've had too much of this life, well hang on.

 Everybody hurts. Take comfort in your friends.
 Everybody hurts. Don't throw your hand. Oh, no. Don't throw your hand.
 If you feel like you're alone, no, no, no, you are not alone
  
 If you're on your own in this life, the days and nights are long,
 when you think you've had too much of this life to hang on.
 
 Well, everybody hurts sometimes,
 everybody cries. And everybody hurts sometimes.
 And everybody hurts sometimes. So, hold on, hold on.
 Hold on, hold on. Hold on, hold on. Hold on, hold on. (repeat & fade)
 (Everybody hurts. You are not alone.)


 "Sweetness Follows"

 Readying to bury your father and your mother,
 what did you think when you lost another?
 I used to wonder why did you bother,
 distanced from one, blind to the other?
 
 Listen here my sister and my brother
 what would you care if you lost the other?
 I always wonder why did we bother,
 distanced from one, deaf to the other.
 
 Oh, oh, but sweetness follows
 
 It's these little things, they can pull you under.
 Live your life filled with joy and wonder.
 I always knew this altogether thunder
 was lost in our little lives.

 Oh, oh, but sweetness follows.
 Oh, oh, but sweetness follows.
 
 It's these little things, they can pull you under.
 Live your life filled with joy and thunder.
 Yeah, yeah we were altogether
 lost in our little lives.
 
 Oh. Oh. Ah.
 
 Oh, oh, but sweetness follows.
 Oh, oh, but sweetness follows.


 "Money Got a raw Deal"

 Monty this seems strange to me.
 The movies had that movie thing,
 but nonsense has a welcome ring
 and heroes don't come easy.
 
 Now, nonsense isn't new to me.
 I know my head, I know my feet,
 but mischief knocked me in the knees.
 Said, Just let go. Just let go.
 
 I saw the ocean meet the man.
 I saw you buried in the sand.
 A friend was there to hold your hand,
 Said, Walk on by.
 
 So, I went walking through the street.
 I saw you strung up in a tree.
 A woman knelt there said to me,
 said, Hold your tongue, man. Hold your tongue.
 
 You don't owe me anything.
 You don't want this sympathy. [waste your breath]
 Don't you waste your breath. [waste your breath]
 for the silver screen.
 
 That nonsense doesn't mean a thing,
 they tried to bust you in a sting,
 but virtue isn't everything
 so, don't waste time.
 
 Now, here's a rhyme that you can steal.
 Put this on your reel to reel.
 Mischief threw a rotten deal.
 Monty's laying low, man.
 He is laying low.
 Just let go, y'all.
 Just let go.

 You don't owe me anything.
 You don't want this sympathy. [waste your breath]
 Don't you waste your breath. [waste your breath]
 Monty this seems strange to me.


 "Ignoreland"

 These bastards stole their power from the victims of the Us v. Them years,
 wrecking all things virtuous and true.
 The undermining social democratic downhill slide into abysmal
 lost lamb off the precipice into the trickle down runoff pool.
 They hypnotised the summer, Nineteen seventy-nine.
 Marched into the capital brooding duplicitous, wicked and able, media-ready,
 heartless, and labeled. Super U.S. citizen, super achiever,
 mega ultra power dosing. Relax.
 Defense, defense, defense, defense. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ignoreland. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ignoreland.
 
 The information nation took their clues from all the sound-bite gluttons.
 Nineteen eighty, eighty-four, eighty-eight, ninety-two too, too.
 How to be what you can be, jump jam junking your energies.
 How to walk in dignity with throw-up on your shoes
 They amplified the autumn, Nineteen seventy-nine.
 Calculate the capital, up the republic my skinny ass.
 T.V. tells a million lies. The paper's terrified to report
 anything that isn't handed on a presidential spoon,
 I'm just profoundly frustrated by all this. So, fuck you, man. (Fuck 'm)
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ignoreland. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ignoreland.
 
 If they weren't there we would have created them. Maybe, it's true,
 but I'm resentful all the same. Someone's got to take the blame.
 I know that this is vitriol. No solution, spleen-venting,
 But I feel better having screamed. Don't you?
 They desecrated winter, Nineteen seventy-nine.
 Capital collateral. Brooding duplicitous, wicked and able, media-ready,
 heartless, and labeled. Super U.S. citizen, super achiever,
 mega ultra power dosing. Relax.
 Defense, defense, defense, defense. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ignoreland. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ignoreland.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ignoreland. Yeah, yeah, yeah.


 "Star Me Kitten"

 Keys cut, three for the price of one.
 Nothing's free but guaranteed for a lifetime's use.
 I've changed the locks
 and you can't have one.
 You, you know the other two.
 
 The brakes have worn so thin that you could hear,
 I hear them screeching through the door from our driveway.
 Hey love, look into your glovebox heart.
 What is there for me inside? This love is tired.
 I've changed the locks. Have I misplaced you?
 Have we lost our minds?
 Will this never end?
 It could depend on your take.
 
 You. Me. We used to be on fire.
 If keys are all that stand between,
 Can I throw in the ring?
 No gasoline.
 Just fuck me kitten.
 You are wild and I'm in your possesion.
 Nothing's free so, fuck me kitten.

 I'm in your possesion.
 So, fuck me kitten.

 "Nightswimming"

 Nightswimming deserves a quiet night.
 The photograph on the dashboard, taken years ago,
 turned around backwards so the windshield shows.
 Every streetlight reveals the picture in reverse.
 Still, it's so much clearer.
 I forgot my shirt at the water's edge.
 The moon is low tonight.
 
 Nightswimming deserves a quiet night.
 I'm not sure all these people understand.
 It's not like years ago,
 The fear of getting caught,
 of recklessness and water.
 They cannot see me naked.
 These things, they go away,
 replaced by everyday.
 
 Nightswimming, remembering that night.
 September's coming soon.
 I'm pining for the moon.
 And what if there were two
 Side by side in orbit
 Around the fairest sun?
 That bright, tight forever drum
 could not describe nightswimming.
 
 You, I thought I knew you.
 You I cannot judge.
 You, I thought you knew me,
 this one laughing quietly underneath my breath.
 Nightswimming.
  
 The photograph reflects,
 every streetlight a reminder.
 Nightswimming deserves a quiet night, deserves a quiet night.


 "Find the River"

 Hey now, little speedyhead,
 the read on the speedmeter says
 you have to go to task in the city
 where people drown and people serve.
 Don't be shy. Your just deserve
 is only just light years to go.
 
 Me, my thoughts are flower strewn
 ocean storm, bayberry moon.
 I have got to leave to find my way.
 Watch the road and memorize
 this life that pass before my eyes.
 Nothing is going my way.
 
 The ocean is the river's goal,
 a need to leave the water knows
 We're closer now than light years to go.
 
 I have got to find the river,
 bergamot and vetiver
 run through my head and fall away.
 Leave the road and memorize
 this life that pass before my eyes.
 Nothing is going my way.
 
 There's no one left to take the lead,
 but I tell you and you can see
 we're closer now than light years to go.
 Pick up here and chase the ride.
 The river empties to the tide.
 Fall into the ocean.
 
 The river to the ocean goes,
 a fortune for the undertow.
 None of this is going my way.
 There is nothing left to throw
 of Ginger, lemon, indigo,
 coriander stem and rose of hay.
 Strength and courage overrides
 the privileged and weary eyes
 of river poet search naivete.
 Pick up here and chase the ride.
 The river empties to the tide.
 All of this is coming your way. 
 

 ALBUM: CHRONIC TOWN


 "Wolves, Lower"

 Suspicion yourself, suspicion yourself, don't get caught.
 Suspicion yourself, suspicion yourself, let us out.
 Wilder lower wolves. Here's a house to put wolves out the door.
 In a corner garden, wilder lower wolves.
 House in order. House in order. House in order. House in order.
 Down there they're rounding a posse to ride.
 
 (repeat verse)

 "Gardening At Night"

 I see your money on the floor, I felt the pocket change.
 Though all the feelings that broke through that door
 just didn't seem to be too real.
 The yard is nothing but a fence, the sun just hurts my eyes.
 Somewhere it must be time for penitence. Gardening at night is never where.
 Gardening at night. Gardening at night. Gardening at night.
 
 The neighbors go to bed at ten.
 Call the prayer line for a change.
 The charge is changing every month.
 They said it couldn't be arranged.
 
 We ankled up the garbage sound, but they were busy in the rows.
 We fell up, not to see the sun, gardening at night just didn't grow.
 I see your money on the floor, I felt the pocket change.
 Though all the feelings that broke through that door
 just didn't seem to be too real.
 Gardening at night. Gardening at night. Gardening at night 
 
 Your sister said that you're too young.
 They should know they've been there twice.
 The call was 2 and 51.
 They said it couldn't be arranged.
 
 I see your money on the floor, I felt the pocket change.
 Though all the feelings that broke through that door
 just didn't seem to be too real.v We ankled up the garbage sound, but they
     were busy in
 the rows.
 We fell up not to see the sun, gardening at night just didn't grow.
 Gardening at night. Gardening at night. Gardening at night 

 
 "Carnival of Sorts (Box Cars)"

 There's a secret stigma, reaping wheel.
 Diminish, a carnival of sorts.
 Chronic town, poster torn, reaping wheel.
 Stranger, stranger to these parts.
 
 Gentlemen don't get caught, cages under cage. Gentlemen don't get caught,
 Boxcars (are pulling) out of town. Boxcars (are pulling) out of town.
 Boxcars (are pulling) out of town.
 
 (repeat 1st verse and chorus)

 Cages under, cages under, cages under cage.
 Cages under, cages under, cages under cage.
 
 (repeat chorus)

 There's a secret stigma, reaping wheel.
 Stranger, stranger to these parts.
 Chronic town, poster torn, reaping wheel.
 Diminish, stranger.

 "1,000,000"

 Secluded in a marker stone
 Not only deadlier but smarter too smarter too
 All along the tomb, all along the ruin
 Secluded in a marker stone
 Not only deadlier but smarter too smarter too
 
 I could live a million, I could live a million, I could live a million,
 I could live a million years.
 
 (repeat 1st verse and chorus)

 All along all along all along the tomb
 Secret in secret in secret in the ruin
 Secluded in a marker stone
 Not only deadlier but smarter too smarter too
 
 
 "Stumble"

 We'll stumble through the yard
 We'll stumble through the yard
 We'll stumble through the A-P-T
 We'll stumble through the yard
 Force fields. Explorer racing home, the ancient star.
 Yellow mixed with golden hue.
 Scan the graveyard, dead there be.
 Ball and chain. Ball and chain.
 Ball and chain. Ball and chain.
 
 (Repeat 1st verse 3 times)
 
 It was round about midnight. Hipster town.
 Imagine going for a walk.
 Things get around to taking place. It's not a waste of time.
 The rich got a little poorer.
 Things get around to taking place. If they're gonna happen at all.
 Don't need that jazz. Don't need that stuff.
 It was round about midnight. Hipster town.
 It was round about midnight. Hipster town.
 
 (Repeat 1st verse)

 "Crazy" (Pylon)

 Listen
 
 You're funny and you don't know why
 You're funny and you can't even cry
 You're funny and you don't know why
 You're funny and you don't even try
 
 Cause your head's shaking cause your arms are shaking
 And your feet are shaking cause the earth is shaking
 
 You're hungry and you don't know why
 You're hungry and you can't even cry
 You're hungry and you don't know why
 You're hungry and you don't even cry
 
 You take a walk and you try to understand
 Nothing can hurt you
 Unless you want it to
 There are no answers
 Many reasons to be strong
 You take a walk you take a walk
 You take a walk and you try to understand
 
 You're in love and you don't know why
 You're in love and you can't even cry
 You're in love and you don't know why
 You're in love and you don't even try
 

 "There She Goes Again" (The Velvet Underground)

 There she goes again
 She's out on the street again
 She's down on her knees my friend
 Won't have to ask her please again
 
 Look a little closer there's no tears in her eyes
 You know she won't make it with just any guy
 What can you do
 See her walking down the street
 With all your friends she's gonna meet
 You'd better hit her
 
 
 "Burning Down"

 From the back of my neck, oh oh oh
 Wired a glass jaw, oh oh
 Plantation burning your boat is coming in
 Strum your jew's-harp, you're reeking gin
 
 Running water in a sinking boat
 Going under but they've got your goat
 Burning down - my hands are tied my feet are bound
 Burning down - can't you see that my hands are bound
 
 Johnny Mike is reading in the yard
 His story's timely, oh oh oh
 What river is it anyway, radio
 Not in a boat, in your ear

 Running water in a sinking boat
 Going under but they've got your goat
 Burning down - my hands are tied my feet are bound
 Burning down - can't you see that my hands are bound

 You pick your island in the sun
 Take your island off he's got a gun
 Burning down - my hands are tied my feet are bound
 Burning down - can't you see that my hands are bound

 He's cooking in the woods, a brush fire in your neck
 Feeling mighty mighty, oh oh oh
 You can pick your island in the sun
 Take your island off he's got a gun

 Running water in a sinking boat
 Going under but they've got your goat
 Burning down - my hands are tied my feet are bound
 Burning down - can't you see that my hands are bound


 "Voice of Harold"
 (derived from the liner notes to the gospel album "The Joy of Knowing
 Jesus," by The Revelaires)

 Reverend Bill Funderburk sings "He Cared That Much For Me";
 Charles Surratt introduces his own composition "On Calvary For Me";
 "The Joy of Knowing Jesus" is a song of pure delight featuring John Barbee;

 The pure tenor quality of the voice of Harold Montgomery
 gives a special interpretation to the grand old hymn "The Old Rugged Cross";
 Chill bumps appear and I am frozen in the web they weave as they reveal
     their innermost selves with the outpouring of their hearts...

 On and on the songs roll and soon you are caught up
 in the sermon in each rendition as you come to feel
 the devotion and dedication that is poured forth. 
 Suddenly, you know they are real, they mean it!

 "Let your light so shine..."
 could not be more aptly applied
 as there shines a light from heaven on your heart
 through their singing. As an artist, Rhonda Montgomery
 exemplifies piano artistry. That's Rhonda! An artist!

 This album can be the instrument to mend a broken heart
 or to straighten out your life through the sincere testimony
 in the songs of THE REVELAIRES. A must!

 "Burning Hell"

 Women got legs, men got pants
 I got the picnic, you got the ants,
 Put it in the fire heaven knows
 Take my torch and touch your toes in hell
 It's a burning hell
 
 You can burn in Hell
 It's a burning hell
 You can burn in hell
 It's a burning hell
 
 Women don't fret, boys don't bet
 Let me see your silhouette in hell
 Women above me take my love
 Love, love, love, love, love, love, love
 
 It's a burning hell
 It's a burning hell
 Baby, baby, baby, I'm hell
 It's a burning hell
 
 Girl stop moving, boy behave
 Baby, I'll put you in an early grave in hell
 Love on the ceiling, love on the floor
 I'm gonna leave you burning for more
 Burn in the country, burn downtown
 All the best people are burning down in hell, hell, Ah hell
 
 It's a burning Hell
 You'll burn in hell
 It's a big, burning, giant, colossal matter
 Hell
 Oh baby, I'm hell
 
 Burn, Burn, Burn!


 "Toys In The Attic" (Aerosmith)

 Light voices scream nothing seems real's a dream
 Leaving the things that you learned behind
 Leaving the things that you love behind
 All of the things that you learned were real
 Nothing except for the years
 Voices scream, nothing seems real's a dream
 Toys toys toys in the attic
 
 Light voices scream nothing seems real's a dream
 Leaving the things that you love behind
 Leaving the things that you learned behind
 All of the things that you learned were real
 Nothing except for the years
 Voices scream, nothing seems real's a dream
 Toys toys toys in the attic


 "Windout"

 Windout - if you're out of wind
 Windout - if you're really spent
 Windout - if you're young and red
 
 Yeah, tick tock, it's tine o'clockv
 Once is good enough, you really go...
 
 So find out - if you're really spent
 Find out - if you're out of wind
 Windout - if you're out of sin
 
 Winding up
 
 There's no doubt - that you're feeling fine
 No doubt - that you're out of mind
 No doubt - that you're young and red
 
 Windout - if you're really spent
 Find out - if you're young and red
 Windout - if you're out of wind
 If you're young and red
 
 Tick tock time to clock my band
 Once is good enough, you really go...

 "Ages of You"

 Postcard stowaway within
 Pristine indigo without
 Banded ottoman as such
 Sofa seated one too much
 
 All along the range all along the range
 Ages of you
 
 Train pulls over hanging bridge
 Conductor looks up, thinks
 out and down, hands stuck to the left
 to the right, you should fall,
 the horses just don't gossip anymore
 

 "Pale Blue Eyes" (The Velvet Underground)

 Sometimes I feel so happy
 Sometimes I feel so sad
 Sometimes I feel just about everything
 Lately I'm just feeling bad
 Lately I'm just feeling bad
 
 Linger on your pale blue eyes
 
 I thought of you as my mountain top
 I thought of you as my peak
 I thought of you as just about everything
 I had but couldn't keep
 I had but couldn't keep
 

 "Bandwagon"

 Come on aboard, I promise you you won't hurt the horse
 We treat him well, we feed him well.
 There's lots of room for you on the bandwagon,
 The road may be rough, the weather may forget us
 But won't we all parade around and sing our songs,
 a magic kingdom, open-armed
 
 Greet us hello, bravo, name in lights
 Passing on the word to fellow passengers and players, passing in,
 Until you're tired looking at all the flags
 And all the banners waving
 This is some parade, yesiree Bob.
 Could we have known?
 Yesiree Bob, could we have known?
 
 Look at all the flags and all the banners waving.
 Open up our arms, a magic kingdom, open-armed and greet us all
 
 Come on aboard I promise you you won't hurt the horse
 We treat him well, we feed him well
 There's lots of room for you on the bandwagon
 The road may be rough, the weather may forget us
 But won't we all parade around and sing our songs and wave our flags.
 A magic kingdom, greet us all hello, greet us hello, greet us hello.
 
 
 "Femme Fatale" (The Velvet Underground)

 Here she comes you better watch your step
 She's going to play you for a fool it's true
 It's not hard to realize
 Just look into her false colored eyes
 She'll build you up to just put you down
 What a clown
 
 Cause everybody knows the things she does to please
 She's just a little tease
 See the way she walks hear the way she talks
 
 You're written in her book
 You're number thirty-seven have a look
 She's going to play you for a fool it's true
 Little boy on the street
 Before you start you're already beat
 She's going to smile to make you frown
 What a clown
 
 Cause everybody knows (She's a femme fatale)
 the things she does to please (She's a femme fatale)
 She's just a little tease (She's a femme fatale)
 See the way she walks hear the way she talks
 

 "Walter's Theme"

 Hey this is David

 Put on my boots and going down to Walter's
 Get me some barbecue
 Bring some home to the misses
 He'll give you a bag to put it in
 This is David, signing off
 

 "King of the Road" (by Roger Miller)

 Trailers for sale or rent

 It takes four hours of pushin' broom
 To buy a four-by-twelve two-bit room
 I'm a man of means, by no means

 To throw Thoreau and rearrange

 Hang your collar up inside 
 Hang your dollar on me 
 Listen to the water still 
 Listen to the cause where you are 
 Fed and educated, 
 primitive and wild 
 Welcome to the occupation 
  
 Here we stand and here we fight 
 All your fallen heroes 
 Held and dyed and skinned alive 
 Listen to the Congress fire 
 Offering the educated 
 primitive and loyal 
 Welcome to the occupation 
  
 Hang your collar up inside 
 Hang your freedom higher 
 Listen to the buyer still 
 Listen to the Congress 
 Where we propagate confusion 
 Primitive and wild

 Copper, steel and cattle

 Where we open up the floodgates 
 Freedom reigns supreme 
 Fire on the hemisphere below

 "Disturbance at the Heron House" 
 A stampede at the monument 
 To liberty and honor under the honor roll 
 The gathering of grunts and greens 
 Cogs and grunts and hirelings 
 A meeting of a mean idea to hold 
 "When feeding time has come and gone 
 They'll lose the heart and head for home 
 Try to tell us something we don't know" 
  
 Everyone allowed, Everyone allowed 
  
  
 "Strange" (Wire) 
 (lyrics taken from the lyric sheet of Wire's _Pink Flag_) 
 
 There's something strange going on tonight 
 There's something going on that's not quite right 
 Michael's nervous and the lights are bright 
 There's something going on that's not quite right 
  
 There's something going on that wasn't here before 
 Keep your eyes glued to the floor 
 There's something strange going on tonight 
 There's something going on that's not quite right 
  
 There's something going on that wasn't here before 
 Keep your eyes glued to the floor 
 No one's going to say goodnight 
 There's something going on that's not quite right 
  
  
 "It's The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)" 
 (from official lyric sheet) 
 
 That's great, it starts with an earthquake, birds and snakes, an aeroplane - 
 Lenny Bruce is not afraid. Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn - 
 world serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needs. Feed it up a
     knock,
 speed, grunt no, strength no. Ladder structure clatter with fear of height, 
 down height. Wire in a fire, represent the seven games in a government for 
 hire and a combat site. Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry with the furies 
 breathing down your neck. Team by team reporters baffled, trump, tethered 
 crop. Look at that low plane! Fine then. Uh oh, overflow, population, 
 common group, but it'll do. Save yourself, serve yourself. World serves its 
 own needs, listen to your heart bleed. Tell me with the rapture and the 
 reverent in the right - right. You vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight, bright 
 light, feeling pretty psyched. 
 
 It's the end of the world as we know it. 
 It's the end of the world as we know it. 
 It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine. 
  
 Six o'clock - TV hour. Don't get caught in foreign tower. Slash and burn, 
 return, listen to yourself churn. Lock him in uniform and book burning,
     blood letting.
 Every motive escalate. Automotive incinerate. Light a candle, 
 light a motive. Step down, step down. Watch a heel crush, crush. Uh oh, 
 this means no fear - cavalier. Renegade and steer clear! A tournament, 
 a tournament, a tournament of lies. Offer me solutions, offer me
     alternatives
 and I decline. 
  
 It's the end of the world as we know it. 
 It's the end of the world as we know it. 
 It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine. 
  
 The other night I tripped a nice continental drift divide. Mount St.
     Edelite.
 Leonard Bernstein. Leonid Breshnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs. 
 Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom! You symbiotic, patriotic, 
 slam, but neck, right? Right. 
  
 It's the end of the world as we know it. 
 It's the end of the world as we know it. 
 It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine...fine... 
 
 (It's time I had some time alone) 
  
 
 "The One I Love" 
 
 This one goes out to the one I love 
 This one goes out to the one I've left behind 
 A simple prop to occupy my time 
 This one goes out to the one I love 
  
 Fire (she's comin' down on her own, now) 
  
 This one goes out to the one I love 
 This one goes out to the one I've left behind 
 Another prop has occupied my time 
 This one goes out to the one I love 
  
 
 "Fireplace" 
 
 Crazy crazy world crazy crazy times 
 Crazy crazy world crazy crazy times 
 Hang up your chairs to better sweep 
 Clear the floor to dance 
 Shake the rug into the fireplace 
  
 Crazy crazy world crazy crazy times 
 Crazy crazy world crazy crazy times 
 Hang up your chairs to better sweep 
 Clear the floor to dance 
 Sweep the floor into the fireplace 
 
 Hang up your chairs to better sweep 
 Clear the floor to dance 
 Throw the chairs into the fireplace 
  
 Hang up your chairs to better sweep 
 Clear the floor to dance 
 Throw the walls into the fireplace 
  
 
 "Lightnin' Hopkins" 
 
 When I lay myself to sleep pray that I don't go too deep 
 Lightnin' won Lightnin' won 
 Because it's cold down gold down there, crow! 
  
 Flat lands low lands on the track 
 Shows the water pan the track 
 Lightnin' won lightnin' won 
 Close up hands to silhouette, crow! 
  
 Lightnin' won, lightnin' won 
  
 Hound bark on the track 
 Hound crow hold onto your hat 
 Lightnin' won lightnin' won 
 Low lands timberlands bad lands bird lands 
  
 
 "King of the Birds" 
 
 A thumbnail sketch, a jeweler's stone 
 A mean idea to call my own 
 Old man don't lay so still you're not yet young 
 There's time to teach, point to point, 
 Point observation, children carry reservations 
 Standing on the shoulders of giants leaves me cold, leaves me cold. 
 A mean idea to call my own, a hundred million birds fly 
 
 Singer sing me a given, singer sing me a song 
 Standing on the shoulders of giants everybody's looking on 
 (Old don't lay so still you're not yet young, 
 there's time to teach, point to point, 
 point observation, children carry reservations). 
 Standing on the shoulders of giants leaves me cold 
 A mean idea to call my own, a hundred million birds fly away, away. 
 
 I am king of all I see, my kingdom for a voice 
 Old man don't lay so still, you're not yet young 
 There's time to teach, point to point 
 Point observation, children carry reservations 
 Standing on the shoulders of giants leaves me cold 
 A mean idea to call my own, a hundred million birds fly away 
  
 Everybody hit the ground. Everybody hit the ground. 
  
  
 "Oddfellows Local 151" 
 
 Oddfellows local 151 behind the firehouse 
 Where Peewee sits to prove a sage to teach 
 Peewee gathered up his proof 
 Reached up and scratched his head 
 Fell down and hit the ground again 
  
 Firehouse. Firehouse. 
  
 Why do the heathens rage behind the firehouse 
 Where Peewee sits upon the wall to preach? 
 This boy and girl that gather pearls 
 Of wisdom falling from his mouth 
 Wash off the blood, wash off the rum 
  
 Firehouse. Firehouse. 
  
 Oddfellows local 151 behind the firehouse 
 Where Peewee sits upon the wall to preach. 
 This boy and girl that gather pearls 
 Of wisdom falling from his mouth 
 Wash off the blood, wash off the 151. 
  
 Firehouse. Firehouse. 
 Firehouse. Firehouse.


 ALBUM: OUT OF TIME


 "Radio Song" 
 
 Hey, I can't find nothing on the radio 
 Yo! turn to that station 
 
 The world is collapsing 
 Around our ears 
 I turned up the radio 
 But I can't hear it 
  
 When I got to the house 
 And I called you out 
 I could tell that you had been crying, crying 
 It's that same sing song on the radio 
 It makes me sad 
 I meant to turn it off 
 To say goodbye 
 To leave in quiet 
 that radio song 
 Hey hey hey 
  
 I've everything to show 
 I've everything to hide 
 Look into my eyes 
 Listen 
  
 When I got to the show 
 Yo ho ho 
 I could tell that you had been crying, crying 
 It's that same sing song, and the DJ sucks 
 It makes me sad 
 I tried to turn it off 
 To say goodbye my love 
 That radio song 
 Hey hey hey 
  
 The world is collapsing 
 Around our ears 
 I turned up the radio 
 But I can't hear it 
 Yeah 
  
 I tried to sing along 
 But damn that radio song 
 Hey hey hey 
  
 I've everything to show 
 I've everything to hide 
 Look into my eyes listen to the radio 
 I turned up the radio 
 But I can't hear it 
 No, I can't hear it 
 Hey hey hey 
  
 Check it out 
 What are you saying 
 What are you playing 
 Who are you obeying 
 day out day in? 
 Baby baby baby 
 That stuff is driving me crazy 
 DJs communicate to the masses 
 Sex and violent classes 
 Now our children grow up prisoners 
 All their lives radio listeners 

 
 "Losing My Religion "
 
 Life is bigger 
 It's bigger than you 
 And you are not me 
 The lengths that I will go to 
 The distance in your eyes 
 Oh no I've said too much 
 I set it up 
  
 That's me in the corner 
 That's me in the spotlight 
 Losing my religion 
 Trying to keep up with you 
 And I don't know if I can do it 
 Oh no I've said too much 
 I haven't said enough 
 I thought that I heard you laughing 
 I thought that I heard you sing 
 I think I thought I saw you try 
  
 Every whisper 
 Of every waking hour I'm 
 Choosing my confessions 
 Trying to keep an eye on you 
 Like a hurt lost and blinded fool 
 Oh no I've said too much 
 I set it up 
  
 Consider this 
 The hint of the century 
 Consider this 
 The slip that brought me 
 To my knees failed 
 What if all these fantasies 
 Come flailing around 
 Now I've said too much 
 I thought that I heard you laughing 
 I thought that I heard you sing 
 I think I thought I saw you try 
  
 But that was just a dream 
 That was just a dream 

 
 "Low"
 
 Dusk is dawn is day 
 Where did it go? 
 I've been laughing 
 Fast and slow 
 Moving in a still frame 
 Howling at the moon 
 Morning found me laughing 
 Up and down, down 
 Low low low 
 Night suits me fine 
 and morning suits me fine 
 I've been so happy 
 Way up high, high 
 In between 
 Down below 
 Low low low 
  
 I skipped the part about love 
 It seems so silly and low 
 Low low low 
 Low low low 
  
 I said the morning 
 It isn't your time 
 Barefoot naked 
 I can see your lines 
 It doesn't bother me 
 That you are right 
 Your grass is grassy wet 
 Your light white is bright 
 Light white light 
  
 I skipped the part about love 
 It seems so shallow and low 
 Low low low 
 Low low low 
  
 You and me 
 We know about time 
 We know how things go 
 They come and go 
 They live and grow 
 They pass and go 
 And glow and glow 
 Up and down 
 High and low 
 Low low low 
 Low low low 
  
 I skipped the part about love 
 It seems so silly and low 
 I skipped the part about love 
 It seems so shallow and low 
 Low low low 
 Low low low 
  
 I like your hands 
 All full of glory 
 All full of glory 


 "Near Wild Heaven"
  
 Whenever we hold each other 
 We hold each other 
 There's a feeling that's gone 
 Something has gone wrong 
 And I don't know how much longer I can take it 
 House made of heart break it 
 Take my head in your hands and shake it 
 in this near wild heaven 
 Not near enough. 
  
 Living inside 
 Living inside 
 Near wild heaven 
  
 Whatever it takes I'm giving 
 It's just a gift I'm given 
 Try to live inside 
 Trying to move inside 
 And I always thought that it would make me smarter 
 But it's only made me harder 
 My heart thrown open wide 
 In this near wild heaven 
 Not near enough. 
  
 Living inside 
 Living inside 
 Near wild heaven 
  
 I'm holding my hands together 
 I'm holding my feet together 
 I'm holding myself together 
 In this near wild heaven 
 Not near enough 


 "Shiny Happy People"
 
 Shiny happy people laughing 
 Meet me in the crowd 
 People people 
 Throw your love around 
 Love me love me 
 Take it into town 
 Happy happy 
 Put it in the ground 
 Where the flowers grow 
 Gold and silver shine 
  
 Shiny happy people holding hands 
 Shiny happy people laughing 
 
 Everyone around love them, love them 
 Put it in your hands 
 Take it take it 
 There's no time to cry 
 Happy happy 
 Put it in your heart 
 Where tomorrow shines 
 Gold and silver shine 
  
 Shiny happy people holding hands 
 Shiny happy people laughing 


 "Belong"
 
 Her world collapsed early Sunday morning 
 She got up from the kitchen table 
 Folded the newspaper and silenced the radio 
 Those creatures jumped the barricades 
 And have headed for the sea, sea 
  
 Those creatures jumped the barricades 
 and have headed for the sea 
 She began to breathe 
 To breathe at the thought of such freedom 
 Stood and whispered to her child, belong 
 She held the child and whispered 
 With calm, calm; belong 
  
 Stood and whispered to her child, belong 
 She held the child and whispered 
 With calm, calm; belong 
  
 These barricades can only hold for so long 
 Her world collapsed early Sunday morning 
 She took the child held tight 
 Opened the window 
 A breath, this song, how long 
 and knew, knew; belong 


 "Half A World Away"
 
 This could be the saddest dusk 
 I've ever seen 
 Turn to a miracle 
 high alive 
 My mind is racing 
 As it always will 
 My hand is tired my heart aches 
 I'm half a world away here 
 my head sworn 
 To go it alone 
 And hold it along 
 Haul it along 
 And hold it 
 Go it alone 
 Hold it along and hold, hold. 
  
 This lonely deep sit hollow 
 I'm half a world 
 Half the world away 
 My shoes are gone 
 My life spent 
 I had too much to drink 
 I didn't think 
 and I I didn't think of you 
 I guess that's all I needed 
 To go it alone 
 And hold it along 
 Haul it along 
 And hold it 
 Blackbirds backwards forwards and fall and hold hold. 
  
 Oh this lonely world is wasted 
 Pathetic eyes high alive 
 blind to the tide that turns the sea 
 This storm it came up strong 
 it shook the trees 
 And blew away our fear 
 I couldn't even hear 
  
 To go it alone 
 And hold it along 
 Haul it along 
 And hold it 
 To go it alone 
 And hold it along 
 Haul it along 
 To go it alone 
 And hold it along 
 Haul it along 
 And hold it 
 Blackbirds backwards forwards and fall and hold hold. 
  
 This could be the saddest dusk 
 I've ever seen 
 Turn to a miracle 
 high alive 
 My mind is racing 
 As it always will 
 My hands tired my heart aches 
 I'm half a world away and go. 


 "Texarkana"
 
 20,000 miles to an oasis 
 20,000 years will I burn 
 20,000 chances I wasted 
 Waiting for the moment to turn 
  
 I would give my life to find it 
 I would give it all 
 Catch me if I fall 
  
 Walking through the woods I have faced it 
 Looking for something to learn 
 30,000 thoughts have replaced it, 
 Never in my time to return 
  
 I would give my life to find it 
 I would give it all 
 Catch me if I fall 
 All alone 
 Waiting to fall 
  
 40,000 stars in the evening 
 Look at them fall from the sky 
 40,000 reasons for living 
 40,000 tears in your eye 
  
 I would give my life to find it 
 I would give it all 
 Catch me if I fall 


 "Country Feedback"
 
 This flower is scorched 
 This film is on 
 On a maddening loop. 
 These clothes, 
 These clothes don't fit us right 
 I'm to blame 
 It's all the same 
 It's all the same 
  
 You come to me with a bone in your hand 
 You come to me with your hair curled tight 
 You come to me with positions 
 You come to me with excuses 
 Ducked out in a row 
 You wear me out 
 You wear me out 
  
 We've been through fake-a-breakdown 
 Self hurt 
 Plastics, collections 
 Self help, self pain, 
 EST, psychics, fuck all 
 I was central 
 I had control 
 I lost my head 
 I need this 
 I need this 
 A paper weight, junk garage 
 Winter rain, a honey pot 
 Crazy, all the lovers have been tagged. 
 A hotline, a wanted ad 
 It's crazy what you could've had 
 It's crazy what you could've had 
 It's crazy what you could've had 
 I need this 
 I need this 


 "Me In Honey"
 
 I sat there looking ugly 
 Looking ugly and mean 
 I knew what you were saying 
 You were saying to me 
  
 Baby's got some new rules 
 Baby said she's had it with me 
 It seems a shame you waste your time on me 
 It seems a lot to waste your time for me 
  
 Left me to love 
 What it's doing to me 
  
 There's a lot of honey in this world 
 Baby this honey's from me 
 You've got to do what you do 
 Do it with me 
 It seems a shame you waste your time for me 
  
 Left me to love 
 What it's doing to me 
  
 Knocked silly 
 Knock flat 
 Sideways down 
 These things they pick you up 
 and they Turn you around 
 Say your piece 
 Say you're sweet for me 
 It's all the same to share the pain with me 
 It's all the same. Save the shame for me 
  
 Left me to love 
 What it's doing to me 
  
 Baby's got some new rules 
 Baby says she's had it with me 
 There's a fly in the honey 
 And baby's got a baby with me 
 That's a part 
 That's a part of me 
 
 Left me to love 
 What it's doing to me 
 Left me to love 
 What it's doing to me 
 What about me?

 "Get Up"
 
 Sleep delays my life (get up, get up) 
 Where does time go? (get up, get up, get up) 
 I don't know 
 Sleep, sleep, sleepy head (get up, get up, get up) 
 Wake it up...up (get up, get up) 
 You've got all your life (way up ahead) (get up, get up, get up)

 This time, no escape, I wake up. (get up, get up) 
 

 "You Are The Everything"
 
 Sometimes I feel like I can't even sing (say, say, the light) 
 I'm very scared for this world 
 I'm very scared for me 
 Eviscerate your memory 
 Here's a scene 
 You're in the back seat laying down 
 The windows wrap around 
 To sound of the travel and the engine 
 All you hear is time stand still in travel 
 and feel such peace and absolute 
 The stillness still that doesn't end 
 But slowly drifts into sleep 
 The stars are the greatest thing you've ever seen 
 And they're there for you 
 For you alone you are the everything 
  
 I think about this world a lot and I cry 
 And I've seen the films and the eyes 
 But I'm in this kitchen 
 Everything is beautiful 
 And she is so beautiful 
 She is so young and old 
 I look at her and I see the beauty 
 Of the light of music 
 The voices talking somewhere in the house 
 Late spring and you're drifting off to sleep 
 With your teeth in your mouth 
 You are here with me 
 You are here with me 
 You have been here and you are everything 
  
 (repeat 1st verse) 

 
 "Stand" 
 
 Stand in the place where you live 
 Now face North 
 Think about direction 
 Wonder why you haven't before 
 Now stand in the place where you work 
 Now face West 
 Think about the place where you live 
 Wonder why you haven't before 
  
 If you are confused check with the sun 
 Carry a compass to help you along 
 Your feet are going to be on the ground 
 Your head is there to move you around 
  
 (repeat 1st verse) 
 
 Your feet are going to be on the ground 
 Your head is there to move you around 
 If wishes were trees the trees would be falling 
 Listen to reason 
 Season is calling 
  
 (repeat 1st verse) 
  
 If wishes were trees the trees would be falling 
 Listen to reason 
 Reason is calling 
 Your feet are going to be on the ground 
 Your head is there to move you around 
  
 So Stand (stand) 
 Now face North 
 Think about direction, wonder why you haven't before 
 Now stand (stand) 
 Now face West 
 Think about the place where you live 
 Wonder why you haven't 
  
 (repeat 1st verse) 
  
 Stand in the place where you are (Now face North) 
 Stand in the place where you are (Now face West) 
 Your feet are going to be on the ground (Stand in the place where you are) 
 Your head is there to move you around, so stand. 
 
 
 "World Leader Pretend" 
  
 I sit at my table and wage war on myself 
 It seems like it's all...it's all for nothing 
 I know the barricades, and 
 I know the mortar in the wall breaks 
 I recognize the weapons, I used them well 
  
 This is my mistake. Let me make it good 
 I raised the wall, and I will be the one to knock it down 
  
 I've a rich understanding of my finest defenses 
 I proclaim that claims are left unstated, 
 I demand a rematch 
 I decree a stalemate 
 I divine my deeper motives 
 I recognize the weapons 
 I've practiced them well. I fitted them myself 
  
 It's amazing what devices you can sympathize...empathize
 This is my mistake. Let me make it good 
 I raised the walls, and I will be the one to knock it down 
  
 Reach out for me and hold me tight. Hold that memory 
 Let my machine talk to me. Let my machine talk to me 
  
 This is my world 
 And I am the world leader pretend 
 This is my life 
 And this is my time 
 I have been given the freedom 
 To do as I see fit 
 It's high time I've razed the walls 
 That I've constructed 
  
 It's amazing what devices you can sympathize...emapathize 
 This is my mistake. Let me make it good 
 I raised the walls, and I will be the one to knock it down 
  
 You fill in the mortar. You fill in the harmony 
 You fill in the mortar. I raised the walls 
 And I'm the only one 
 I will be the one to knock it down 


 "The Wrong Child"
 
 I've watched the children come and go 
 A late long march into spring 
 I sit and watch those children 
 Jump in the tall grass 
 Leap the sprinkler 
 Walk in the ground 
 Bicycle clothespin spokes 
 The sound the smell of swingset hands 
  
 I will try to sing a happy song 
 I'll try and make a happy game to play 
  
 Come play with me I whispered to my new found friend 
 Tell me what it's like to go outside 
 I've never been 
 Tell me what it's like to just go outside 
 I've never been 
 And I never will 
  
 I'm not supposed to be like this 
 I'm not supposed to be like this 
 But it's okay 
  
 Hey those kids are looking at me 
 I told my friend myself 
 Those kids are looking at me 
 They're laughing and they're running over here 
 They're laughing and they're running over here 
 What do I do? 
 What can I do? 
 What should I do? 
 What do I say? 
 What can I say? 
  
 I said I'm not supposed to be like this 
 Let's try to find a happy game to play 
 Let's try to find a happy game to play 
 I'm not supposed to be like this 
 But it's okay...okay 
 
 
 "Orange Crush" 
 
 Follow me, don't follow me 
 I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush 
 Collar me, don't collar me 
 I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush 
 We are agents of the free 
 I've had my fun and now its time to 
 Serve your conscience overseas (over me, not over me) 
 Coming in fast, over me 
  
 (repeat verse) 
 
 High on the roof, 
 thin the blood, 
 another one ____ on the waves tonight, 
 comin' in, you're home 
  
 We'd circle and we'd circle and we'd circle to stop and consider and 
 centered on the pavement stacked up all the trucks jacked up and 
 our wheels in slush and orange crush in pocket and all this here county 
 hell any county it's just like heaven here and I was remembering and I 
 was just in a differnet county and all then this whirlybird that I 
 headed for I had my goggles pulled off I knew it all I knew every back 
 road and every truck stop 
  
 (repeat verse and chorus) 
 
 
 "Turn You Inside-Out" 
 
 Divide your cultured pearls in haste 
 I'm looking for to lay to waste 
 Of all the things I cannot taste 
 and this not the racy race 
 They spoke loud 
  
 I believe in what you do 
 I believe in watching you 
 It's what you do 
  
 I could turn you inside-out 
 What I choose not to do 
 I could turn you inside-out 
 What I choose not to do 
  
 Given the choice 
 Given the heart 
 Given the tool 
 Given the word 
 Given the cheers 
  
 I believe in what you do 
 I believe in watching you 
 It's what you do 
  
 I could turn you inside-out 
 What I choose not to do 
 I could turn you inside-out 
 What I choose not to do 


 "Hairshirt"
 
 I am not the type of dog 
 That could keep you waiting 
 For no good reason 
 Run a carbon-black test on my jaw 
 And you will find it's all been said before 
  
 I can swing my megaphone and long arm the rest 
 It's easier and better 
 To just beat it from the chest 
 Of desire 
  
 I could walk into this room 
 And the waves of conversation are enough 
 To knock you down in the undertow 
 So alone so alone in my life 
 Feed me banks of light 
 And hang your hairshirt on the lowest rung 
 It's a beautiful life 
 And I can hang my hairshirt 
 Away up high in the attic of the wrong dog's life chest 
 Or bury it at sea 
 All my life I've searched for this 
  
 Here I am here I am in your life 
 It's a beautiful life 
 My life 
 It's a beautiful life 
 Your life 


 "I Remember California"
 
 I remember redwood trees, bumper cars and wolverines 
 The ocean's Trident submarines 
 Lemons, limes and tangerines 
 I remember this 
  
 I remember traffic jams 
 Motor boys and girls with tans 
 Nearly was and almost rans 
 I remember this 
  
 History is made 
 History is made to seem unfair 
  
 I recall that you were there 
 Golden smile and shining hair 
 I recall it wasn't fair 
 Recollect it wasn't fair 
 Remembering it wasn't fair outside 
  
 Low ebb, high tide 
 The lowest ebb and highest tide 
 A symbol wave I must confide 
 I guess we took us for a ride 
 I guess it's just a gesture 
  
 I remember this defense 
 Progress fails pacific sense 
 All those sweet conspiracies 
 I remember all these things 
  
 I remember traffic jams 
 Motor boys and girls with tans 
 Nearly was and almost rans 
 I remember this...this 
  
 Low ebb, high tide 
 The lowest ebb and highest tide 
 I guess we took us for a ride 
 I guess its just a gesture. 
  
 At the end of the continent 
 At the edge of the continent 


 "[UNTITLED]"
 
 This world is big and so-awake 
 I stayed up late to hear your voice 
 This light is here to keep you warm 
 This song is here to keep you strong 
  
 I made a list of things to say 
 But all I really want to say 
 All I really want to say is 
 Hold her and keep him strong 
 While I'm away from here 
 Hold her and keep her strong 
 While I'm away from here 
  
 I've seen the world and so-awake 
 And stay up late to hear me sing 
 Just hold her 
 I've seen the world and so-awake 
 And stay up late to hear me sing 
 Just hold him 
 Hold her and keep her strong 
 While I'm away from here 
 Hold him and keep him strong 
 While I'm away from here


 ALBUM: LIFES RICH PAGEANT


 "Begin the Begin" 
 
 Birdie in the hand for life's rich demand 
 The insurgency began and you missed it 
 I looked for it and I found it 
 Miles Standish proud, congratulate me 
  
 A philanderer's tie, a murderer's shoe 
  
 Life's rich demand creates supply in the hand 
 Of the powers, the only vote that matters 
 Silence means security silence means approval 
 On Zenith, on the TV, tiger run around the tree 
 Follow the leader, run and turn into butter 
 
 Let's begin again, begin the begin 
 Let's begin again like Martin Luther Zen 
 The mythology begins the begin 
 Answer me a question I can't itemize 
 I can't think clearly, look to me for reason 
 It's not there, I can't even rhyme here in the begin 
  
 A philanderer's tie, a murderer's shoe 
 Example: the finest example is you 
  
 Birdie in the hand for life's rich demand 
 The insurgency began and you missed it 
 I looked for it and I found it 
 Miles Standish proud, congratulate me 
 
 A philanderer's tie, a murderer's shoe 
 Let's begin again begin the begin 
 Let's begin again 
 
 
 "These Days" 
 
 Now I'm not feeding off you, I will rearrange your scales 
 If I can, and I can 
 March into ocean, march into the sea 
  
 I had a hat I put it down and it sunk, reached down, 
 yanked it up, slapped it on my head 
 All the people gather 
 Fly to carry each his burden 
 We are young despite the years we are concern 
 We are hope despite the times 
 All of the sudden, these days 
 Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever.... 
 
 I wish to meet each one of you 
 And you, me, you, if I can and I can 
 We have many things in common, name three (three, three, three) 
 
 I had a hat and it sunk, reached down, 
 yanked it up, slapped it on my head 
 All the people gather 
 Fly to carry each his burden 
 We are young despite the years we are concern 
 We are hope despite the times 
 All of the sudden, these days 
 Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever you go. 
 
 Now I'm not feeding off you I will rearrange your scales 
 If I can and I can 
 I wish to eat each one of you and you, me, you 
  
 I had a hat and it sunk, reached down, 
 yanked it up, slapped it on my head 
 All the people gather 
 Fly to carry each his burden 
 We are young despite the years we are concern 
 We are hope despite the times 
 All of the sudden, these days 
 Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever you... 
 carry each his burden 
 We are young despite the years we are concern 
 We are hope despite the times 
 All of the sudden, these days 
 Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever you go. 
 (Take away the scattered bones of my meal) 

 
 "Fall On Me" 
 
 There's a problem, feathers iron 
 Bargain buildings, weights and pullies 
 Feathers hit the ground before the weight can leave the air 
 Buy the sky and sell the sky and tell the sky and tell the sky 
  
 Don't fall on me (What is it up in the air for) (It's gonna fall) 
 Fall on me (If it's there for long) (It's gonna fall) 
 Fall on me (It's over it's over me) (It's gonna fall) 
  
 There's the progress we have found (when the rain) 
 A way to talk around the problem (when the children reign) 
 Building towered foresight (keep your conscience in the dark) 
 isn't anything at all (melt the statues in the park) 
 Buy the sky and sell the sky and bleed the sky and tell the sky 
 
 (repeat chorus) 
 Don't fall on me 
  
 Well I could keep it above 
 But then it wouldn't be sky anymore 
 So if I send it to you you've got to promise to keep it whole 
  
 Buy the sky and sell the sky and lift your arms up to the sky 
 And ask the sky and ask the sky 
  
 (repeat chorus, etc.) 

 
 "Cuyahoga" 
 
 Let's put our heads together and start a new country up 
 Our father's father's father tried, erased the parts he didn't like 
 Let's try to fill it in, bank the quarry river, swim 
 We knee-skinned it you and me, we knee-skinned that river red 
  
 This is where we walked, this is where we swam 
 Take a picture here, take a souvenir 
  
 This land is the land of ours, this river runs red over it 
 We knee-skinned it you and me, we knee-skinned that river red 
 And we gathered up our friends, bank the quarry river, swim 
 We knee-skinned it you and me, underneath the river bed 
 
 This is where we walked, this is where we swam 
 Take a picture here, take a souvenir 
 Cuyahoga 
 Cuyahoga, gone 
 
 Let's put our heads together, start a new country up, 
 Underneath the river bed we burned the river down. 
 This is where they walked, swam, hunted, danced and sang, 
 Take a picture here, take a souvenir 
 Cuyahoga 
 Cuyahoga, gone 
 
 Rewrite the book and rule the pages, saving face, secured in faith 
 Bury, burn the waste behind you 
  
 This land is the land of ours, this river runs red over it 
 We are not your allies, we can not defend 
 This is where they walked, this is where they swam 
 Take a picture here, take a souvenir 
 
 Cuyahoga 
 Cuyahoga, gone 
 Cuyahoga 
 Cuyahoga, gone 


 "Hyena" 
 
 Night time fell at the opening, 
 In the final act of the beginning of time. 
 Hyena take your role, the stage is set. 
 The town is safe again tonight 
  
 Hyena (I see the day ahead) 
 Hyena (and all that I've cried through) 
 Hyena (God knows you're doin' that, don't you?) 
  
 Hyena, sister look to your hand 
 Man you serve communal interest, 
 She'll tell you when and where and how and why you'd hurt 
 A beautiful young lady 
 
 Hyena (I see the day ahead) 
 Hyena (and all that I've cried through) 
 Hyena (God knows you're doin' that, don't you?) 
 
 The only thing to fear is fearlessness 
 The bigger the weapon the greater the fear 
 Hyena is ambassador to here 
 
 Night time fell like the closing 
 Meager pay, but recognition 
 Hyena crawls on his belly out 
 The town is safe again tonight 
 
 Hyena (I see the changes, man) 
 Hyena (Goin' on 'cross the way) 
 Hyena (I see my road ahead) 
 Hyena (Don't know if I should stay) 
 Hyena (I see you holding him,) 
 Hyena (and all that I've cried through) 
 Hyena (God knows you're doin' that, don't you?) 

 
 "Underneath the Bunker" 
 
 I will hide and you will hide 
 And we shall hide together here 
 Underneath the bunkers in the row 
  
 I have water I have rum 
 Wait for dawn and dawn shall come 
 Underneath the bunkers in the row 

 
 "The Flowers of Guatemala" 
 
 I took a picture that I'll have to send 
 People here are friendly and content 
 People here are colorful and bright 
 The flowers often bloom at night 
  
 Amanita is the name 
 The flowers cover everything 
 The flowers cover everything 
  
 There's something here I find hard to ignore 
 There's something that I've never seen before 
 Amanita is the name they cover over everything 
  
 The flowers cover everything 
 They cover over everything (Amanita is the name) 
 The flowers cover everything 
  
 Don't look into the sun 
 Don't look into the sun 
  
 There's something that I've never seen before 
 The flowers often bloom at night 
 Amanita is the name they cover over everything 


 "I Believe"
 
 When I was young and full of grace 
 and spirited--a rattlesnake. 
 When I was young and fever fell 
 My spirit, I will not tell 
 You're on your honor not to tell 
 
 I believe in coyotes and time as an abstract 
 Explain the change, the difference between 
 What you want and what you need, there's the key, 
 Your adventure for today, what do you do 
 Between the horns of the day? 
  
 I believe my shirt is wearing thin 
 And change is what I believe in 
  
 When I was young and give and take 
 And foolish said my fool awake 
 When I was young and fever fell 
 My spirit, I will not tell 
 You're on your honor, on your honor 
  
 Trust in your calling, make sure your calling's true 
 Think of others, the others think of you 
 Silly rule golden words make, practice, practice makes perfect, 
 Perfect is a fault, and fault lines change 
  
 I believe my humor's wearing thin 
 And change is what I believe in 
  
 I believe my shirt is wearing thin 
 And change is what I believe in 
  
 When I was young and full of grace 
 As spirited a rattlesnake 
 When I was young and fever fell 
 My spirit, I will not tell 
 You're on your honor, on your honor 
 I believe in example 
 I believe my throat hurts 
 Example is the checker to the key 
 
 I believe my humor's wearing thin 
 And I believe the poles are shifting 
  
 I believe my shirt is wearing thin 
 And change is what I believe in 
 
 
 "What if We Give it Away"
 
 On the outside underneath the wall 
 All the money couldn't buy 
 You're mistaken no one's standing there 
 For the record no one tried 
  
 Oh I try to 
 What if we give it away? 
  
 Overlooking with a hollow eye 
 What's pretending is it right 
 Eye for order a hand for what's in line 
 Couldn't follow couldn't write 
  
 And our life is fine here 
 Stitch it on your tie here 
  
 Here's the trailer Tom 
 A year has come and gone 
 We're not moving was it right 
 Take the order sew it on your tie 
 We couldn't follow couldn't try 
 

 "Just a Touch"
 
 Well what in the world? Women in black 
 Don't you remember send us back 
 A day in the life well nobody laughed 
 Look to the days how long can this last 
 
 Kevin heard it on the radio 
 Hugh informed word of mouth 
 Carla read it in the news 
 Caught it all just a touch 
 
 You set the pace of what was to come 
 I have to carry on now that you're gone 
 A day in the life well nobody laughed 
 Look to the days how long can this last 
 
 There's someone in our dreams 
 In our preassembled dream 
 Lord! Dave! William! 
  
 Well what in the world? Women in black 
 Don't you remember send towering past back 
 A day in the life well nobody laughed 
 Look to the days how long can this last 
 
 I can't see where to worship Popeye, love Al Green, 
 I can't see, I'm so young, I'm so god damn young 


 "Swan, Swan, H"
 
 Swan, swan, hummingbird 
 Hurrah, we are all free now 
 What noisy cats are we 
 Girl and dog he bore his cross 
 A long, low time ago, people talk to me 
 
 Johnny Reb what's the price of fans 
 Forty a piece or three for one dollar? 
 Hey captain don't you want to buy 
 Some bone chains and toothpicks? 
  
 Night wings, her hair chains, 
 Here's your wooden greenback, sing 
 Wooden beams and dovetail sweep 
 I struck that picture ninety times, 
 I walked that path a hundred ninety, 
 Long, low time ago, people talk to me 
  
 A pistol hot cup of rhyme 
 The whiskey is water, the water is wine 
 Marching feet, Johnny Reb, what's the price of heroes? 
  
 Six in one, half dozen the other, 
 Tell that to the captain's mother, 
 Hey captain don't you want to buy, 
 Some bone chains and toothpicks? 
  
 Night wings, her hair chains 
 Swan, swan, hummingbird 
 Hurrah, we are all free now 
 What noisy cats are we 
 Long, low time ago, people talk to me 
 A pistol hot cup of rhyme, 
 The whiskey is water, the water is wine 


 "Superman (The Clique)"
 
 I am I am I am Superman and I know what's happening 
 I am I am I am Superman and I can do anything 
  
 You don't really love that guy you make it with now do you 
 I know you don't love that guy cause I can see right through you 
  
 If you go a million miles away I'll track you down girl 
 Trust me when I say I know the pathway to your heart


 ALBUM: MONSTER


 "What's the Frequency, Kenneth?" 
 
 "What's the frequency, Kenneth?" is your Benzedrine, uh-huh 
 I was brain-dead, locked out, numb, not up to speed 
 I thought I'd pegged you an idiot's dream 
 Tunnel vision from the outsider's screen 
 I never understood the frequency, uh-huh 
 You wore our expectations like an armored suit, uh-huh 
  
 I'd studied your cartoons, radio, music, tv, movies, magazines 
 Richard said, "Withdrawal in disgust is not the same as apathy" 
 A smile like the cartoon, tooth for a tooth 
 You said that irony was the shackles of youth 
 You wore a shirt of violent green, uh-huh 
 I never understood the frequency, uh-huh 
 
 "What's the frequency, Kenneth?" is your Benzedrine, uh-huh 
 Butterfly decal, rearview mirror, dogging the scene 
 You smile like the cartoon, tooth for a tooth 
 You said that irony was the shackles of youth 
 You wore a shirt of violent green, uh-huh 
 I never understood the frequency, uh-huh 
 You wore our expectations like an armored suit, uh-huh 
 I couldn't understand 
 You said that irony was the shackles of youth, uh-huh 
 I couldn't understand 
 You wore a shirt of violent green, uh-huh 
 I couldn't understand 
 I never understood, don't fuck with me, uh-huh 


 "Crush With Eyeliner" 
 
 I know you 
 I know you've seen her 
 She's a sad tomato 
 She's three miles of bad road 
 Walking down the street 
 Will I never meet her? 
 She's a real woman-child 
 Oh my kiss breath turpentine 
  
 I am smitten 
  
 I'm the real thing (I'm the real thing) 
 Have you seen her come around? 
 My crush with eyeliner 
  
 I'm in like. 
 I'm infatuated. 
 It's all too much-the pressure. 
 She's all that I can take 
 What position should I wear? 
 Cop an attitude? (you faker) 
 How can I convince her? (Faker) 
 That I'm invented too, yeah 
  
 I am smitten 
 I'm the real thing (I'm the real thing) 
 We all invent ourselves 
 and, uh, you know me 
  
 Yeah, she's a sad tomato 
 She's three miles of bad road 
 She's her own invention (She's her own invention) 
 That gets me in the throat 
 What can I make myself be? 
 Life is strange, yeah (Life is strange) 
 What can I make myself be (Fake her) 
 To make her mine? 
  
 I am smitten 
 I'll do anything (I'll do anything) 
  
 A kiss breath turpentine, 
 my crush with eyeliner 
  
 I am smitten 
 You know me (Yeah, you know me) 
 I could be your Frankenstein 
 my crush with eyeliner 
  
 I am smitten 
 I'm the real thing (I'm the real thing) 
 Won't you be my valentine? 
 My crush with eyeliner 

 
 "King of Comedy" 
 
 Make your money with a suit and tie 
 Make your money with shrewd denial 
 Make your money expert advice, 
 If you can wing it 
 Make your money with a power ply 
 Make your money with a buyout bribe 
 Make it lie as long as you mean it 
  
 I'm not king of comedy, 
 Grease the pig, give a squeeze (squeeze me) 
  
 Make your money with exploitation 
 Make it holy illumination 
 Say a prayer at every station 
 Don't forget to ask for mercy 
 Make your money with a pretty face 
 Make it easy with product placement 
 Make it charged with controversy 
 I'm straight, I'm queer, I'm bi 
 
 I'm not king of comedy, 
 I'm not your magazine, 
 I'm not your television 
  
 Make your money, make it rich 
 make it young and make it quick 
 Make your money on the jukebox, baby, 
 it's pick up sticks, 
 Make your enemies make your moves 
 Make your critics fumble through 
 Make it smart and make it schmooze 
 Make it look easy 
 
 I'm not king of comedy, 
 I'm not your magazine, 
 I'm not your television, 
 I'm not your movie screen 
 I'm not commodity (all together now) 
 I'm not commodity 
 I'm not commodity 
 
 
 "I Don't Sleep, I Dream" 
 
 I'm looking for an interruption, 
 do you believe? 
 You looking to dig my dreams 
 Be prepared for anything 
 You come into my little scene 
 Hooray hooray hip hip hooray 
 There's one thing I can guarantee: 
 You won't have to dig, dig too deep 
  
 Said leave me to lay, but touch me deep, 
 I don't sleep, I dream 
 I'll settle for a cup of coffee, but you know what I really need 
  
 Are you looking to drive my dreams? 
 You here to run my screens? 
 You come, deliver my demons 
 Hooray hooray hip hip hooray 
 Are you coming to ease my headache? 
 Do you give good head? 
 Am I good in bed? 
  
 I don't know, I guess so 
 I don't sleep, I dream 
 I'll settle for a cup of coffee, but you know what I really need 
  
 I'm looking for an interruption, 
 can you believe? 
 Some medicine for my headache 
 Hooray hooray hip hip hooray 
 I'm pitching for a new direction 
 Pinch me when I wake 
 Don't tell me my dreams are fake 
 you leave me to lay, you touch me deep, 
 I don't sleep, I dream 
 I'll settle for a cup of coffee, but you know what I really need 
 Leave me to lay, but touch me deep, 
 I don't sleep, I dream 
 I'll settle for a cup of coffee, but you know what I really need 
 

 "Star 69"
 
 you don't have to take the bar exam to see 
 what you've done is ignoramus 103 
 what've I got to hang my hat on 
 you don't have a pot to pee in 
 all this just to be your friend 
 I was there until the end. 
 extortion and arson, petty larceny 
  
 I know you called - I know you called - I know you called - 
 I know you called - I know you called - I know you hung up my line 
 star 69 
  
 I know all about the warehouse fire 
 I know squirrelys didn't chew the wires 
 3 people have my number 
 the other 2 were with me. 
 I don't like to tell-tell but I'm not your patsy. 
 this time you have gone too far with me. 
  
 I know you called - I know you called - I know you called - 
 I know you called - I know you called - I know you hung up my line 
 star 69 
  
 why'd you put your quarter down on me? 
 this reads like some dork inside edition hard copy. 
 I can't be your character witness 
 I can't be your alibi 
 doorbell rings it's the FBI 
 we learned spy vs. spy 
 you my friend, are guilty as can be. 
  
 I know you called - I know you called - I know you called - 
 I know you called - I know you called - I know you hung up my line 
 star 69 

 
 "Strange Currencies" 
 
 I don't know why you're mean to me 
 when I call on the telephone. 
 and I don't know what you mean to me 
 but I want to turn you on, turn you up, figure you out,
 I want to take you on
  
 These words, "You will be mine." 
 These words, "You will be mine." all the time. 
  
 the fool might be my middle name 
 But I'd be foolish not to say 
 I'm going to make whatever it takes, 
 ring you up, call you down, sign your name, secret love, 
 make it rhyme, take you in, and make you mine. 
  
 These words, "You will be mine." 
 These words, "You will be mine." all the time. oh 
  
 I tripped and fell. did I fall. 
 What I want to feel, I want to feel it now 
  
 You know with love come strange currencies  
 and here is my appeal: 
  
 I need a chance, a second chance, a third chance, a fourth chance, 
 a word, a signal, a nod, a little breath 
 just to fool myself, to catch myself, to make it real, real 
  
 These words, "You will be mine" 
 These words, "You will be mine." all the time. oh 
  
 These words, "You will be mine." 
 These words, they haunt me, hunt me down, catch in my throat, make me pray, 
 say, love's confined, oh. 

 
 "Tongue"
 (posted by Michael Stipe to rec.music.rem)  
 
 call my name, here I come. 
 90 to nothing, watch me run.  
 you call. 
 I am ashamed to say.  
 ugly girls know their fate.  
 anybody can get laid. 
 you want a room with a fire escape. 
 I want to tell you how much I hate this. 
 don't leave that stuff all over me. it pains me. 
 please just leave it.  
 I should toss that vanity license plate.  
 toss that make-up painted face. 
 box those poems, chocolate cake. 
 scratch that name on the record player. 
 please just leave me be.  
 don't lay that stuff all over me. 
 it crawls all over. all over me.  
 call my name, here I come.  
 your last ditch lay, will I never learn? 
 caramel turn on a dusty apology.  
 it crawls all over me.  
 you turn all over.  
 it pains me. 
 please just leave it. 


 "Bang and Blame"
 
 If you could see yourself now, baby 
 It's not my fault 
 You used to be so in control 
 You're going to roll right over this one 
 Just roll me over, let me go 
 You're laying blame 
 Take this as no, no, no 
  
 You bang, bang, bang, bang and bang, 
 blame, blame, blame 
 You bang, bang, bang, bang and bang, 
 It's not my thing so let it go. 
  
 If you could see yourself now baby, 
 the tables have turned 
 the whole world hinges on your swings 
 your secret life of indiscreet discretions 
 I'd turn the screw and leave the screen, 
 Don't point your finger, 
 You know that's not my thing 
  
 You came to bang, bang, bang, bang and bang, 
 blame, blame, blame 
 You bang, bang, bang, bang and bang, 
 It's not my thing so let it go. 
  
 You've got a little worry, 
 I know it all too well, 
 I've got your number, 
 but so does every kiss-and-tell 
 who dares to cross your threshold, 
 or happens on your way, 
 Stop laying blame. 
 You know that's not my thing. 
  
 You know that's not my thing, 
 You came to bang, bang, bang, bang and bang, 
 blame, blame, blame 
 You bang, bang, bang, bang and bang, 
 It's not my thing so let it go. 
 You bang, bang, bang, bang and bang, 
 blame, blame, blame 
 You bang, bang, bang, bang and bang, 
 It's not my thing so let it go. 
  
 You kiss on me, tug on me, rub on me, jump on me, 
 you bang on me, beat on me, hit on me, let go on me, 
 You let go on me. 


 "I took your Name"
 
 I wore the clothes you wanted 
 I took your name 
 If there is some confusion, who's to blame? 
  
 I signed your living will 
 I smiled your face 
 I'm ready to close the book on NASA in outer space 
  
 If there is some confusion 
 who's to blame? 
 who's to blame? 
  
 I sequenced your arrival 
 I sealed your fate 
 I pushed the button and erased your master tape 
  
 I wrote the sales pitch 
 I threw the brake switch 
 I dragged your big ass daddy roth car out of that ditch 
 
 If there is some confusion 
 who's to blame? 
 who's to blame? 
  
 I crossed your great divide 
 I stirred your ocean's tide 
 I called your bluff until I blew your circuits wide 
  
 I'll be your albatross, 
 devil, dog, Jesus, God, 
 I don't wanna be Iggy Pop but if that's what it takes, hey 
  
 If there is some confusion 
 If there is some confusion 
 If there is some confusion 
 who's to blame? 
 who's to blame? 


 "Let me in"
 
 Yeah, all those stars drip down like butter, 
 promises are sweet, 
 We hold out our pans, lift our hands to catch them. 
 We eat them up, drink them up, up, up, up 
  
 Heyyyyyy, let me in. 
 Heyyyyyy, let me in. 
  
 I only wish that I could hear you whisper down, 
 mister fisherman, to a less peculiar ground. 
 He gathered up his loved ones and he brought them all around 
 to say goodbye, nice try. 
  
 Heyyyyyy, let me in. yeah yeah yeah 
 Heyyyyyy, let me in. Let me in. 
  
 I had a mind to try to stop you. Let me in. Let me in. 
 I've got tar on my feet and I can't see. 
 All the birds look down and laugh at me. 
 Clumsy, crawling out of my skin. 
  
 Heyyyyyy, let me in. yeah yeah yeah 
 Heyyyyyy, let me in. 
 Heyyyyyy, let me in. yeah yeah yeah 
 Heyyyyyy, let me in. 


 "Circus Envy"
 
 Here comes that awful feeling again 
 Welcome the ugly animal. 
 I hold my breath to what you sing, 
 My pyro acrobat ball and chain, 
 I'm not afraid, I messed it, messed it, messed it, messed it up 
  
 I've got my telescope head in the haystack 
 I'm getting tired of your dodgeball circus act 
 Put pepper in my coffee, I forgot to bark on command 
  
 Here comes that awful feeling again 
 Make way for monster jealousy 
 The strong man kicked sand into my breakfast cereal bowl 
 I'd spelled your name with Oatios, 
 he messed it, messed it, messed it, messed it up 
  
 I've got my telescope head in the haystack 
 I am tired of your dodgeball circus act 
 Put pepper in my coffee, I forgot to bark on command 
  
 (you're mean, mean, mean 
 you tease, tease, tease me) 
  
 If I were you I'd really run from me 
 I'd really really wish that I were you 
 When I get loose I'll climb a tree 
 and drop a load on your head 
 This monster in me makes me retch, you messed it, messed it up 
  
 I've got my telescope head in the haystack 
 I am jealous of your dodgeball circus act 
 Put pepper in my coffee, I forgot to bark 
 Put pepper in my coffee, I forgot to bark on command 
  
 (you're mean, mean, mean 
 you tease, tease, tease me) 
  
 Do you smell jealousy? 
 Do you smell jealousy, jealousy, jealousy? 


 "You"
 
 Let the sun beat through the clouds, 
 Let me kiss you on the mouth. 
 All my childhood toys with chew marks in your smile. 
 Let me hold your syrup close to mine. 
 Let me watch you, Hollywood and Vine. 
 And I want you like the movies, touch me now. 
 I love you crazy, just keep on. 
 I love you madly, just keep watch. 
 You wipe my lips, 
 You turn me on. 
 My attentions are turned to you. 
 
 Did I dream you were a tourist 
 in the Arizona sun? 
 I can see you there with luna moths 
 and watermelon gum. 
 I woke up in the sleeping bag, 
 With nowhere else to run. 
 You're standing in the bathroom 
 telling me its all in fun. 
 I love you crazy, just keep on. 
 I love you madly, just keep watch. 
 You wipe my lips, 
 You turn me on. 
 My attentions are turned to you. 
  
 I can whisper in your ear. 
 I can write a calendar year 
 I can wing around your Saturn smile, shout at the moon 
 I walked the tension wire line. 
 And I learned to disrespect the signs. 
 And I want you like a Pisces rising, even though 
 I love you crazy, just keep on. 
 I love you madly, just keep watch. 
 You wipe my lips, 
 You turn me on. 
 My attentions are turned to you.


 ALBUM: NEW ADVENTURES IN HI-FI 
 

 "How The West Was Won And Where It Got Us"
 
 Blood from a stone 
 Water from wine. 
 Born under earplay design. 
 A stroke of bad luck, 
 wrong place, wrong time. 
 This flyer is out of the lime. 
  
 The story is a sad one, told many times. 
 The story of my life in trying times. 
 Just add water, stir in lime. 
 How the west was won and where it got us. 
  
 Canary got trapped, the uranium mine. 
 A stroke of bad luck, now the bird has died. 
 a marker to mark where my tears run dry. 
 I cross it, bless it, alkali. 
  
 The story is a sad one, told many times. 
 The story of my life in trying times. 
 Just add water, stir in lime. 
 How the west was won and where it got us. 
  
 I didn't wear glasses cause I thought it might rain. 
 Now I can't see anything. 
 I made a mistake, chalked it up to design. 
 I cracked through time, space, Godless and dry. 
 I point my nose to the northern star, 
 watch the decline from a hazy distance. 


 "The Wake-Up Bomb"
 (from a lyric sheet - performed during '95 Monster tour and on 1995 
 MTV Awards show) 
 
 (I...was...cool) 
  
 I look good in a glass pack 
 I look good and mean 
 I look good in metallic sick wraparound blackout tease 
 I scud along the horizon, I drink some sweet tree tea 
 I get high in my low-ass boot-cut jean 
 I like being seen 
 I look good with my drink-eat-no-sleep, take-a-leap longevity 
 I get high on my attitude, latitude, 1973 
 I'm in deep 
  
 My head's on fire and high esteem 
 Carry my dead, bored, been there, done that, anything 
 Oh, the wake-up bomb 
 Oh, the wake-up bomb 
 Oh, the wake-up bomb 
 Oh, the wake-up bomb 
 My head's on fire and high esteem 
 Get drunk and sing along to Queen 
 Practice my T-Rex moves and make the scene 
 Carry my dead, bored, been there, done that, anything 
  
 I had to knock a few buildings over 
 I make an ugly mess 
 I had to blow a gasket 
 Drop transmission 
 I had to decompress 
 I had to write the great American novel 
 I had a neutron bomb 
 I had to teach the world to sing by the age of 21 
 I wake up (I wake up) 
 I wake up (I wake up) 
 I threw up when I saw what I'd done 
  
 Oh, the wake-up bomb 
 Oh, the wake-up bomb 
 My head's on fire and high esteem 
 Get drunk and sing along to Queen 
 Practice my T-Rex moves and make the scene 
 Yeah, I'd rather be anywhere doing anything 
  
 I've had enough, I've seen enough, I've had it all, I'm giving up 
 I won the race, I broke the cup, I drank it all, I spit it up 
 I've had enough, I've seen enough, I've had it all, I'm giving up 
 I won the race, I broke the cup, I drank it all, I spit it up 
  
 Yeah, atomic, Supersonic 
 What a joke, I'm dumb 
 See ya, don't wanna be you 
 Lunch meat, Pond scum 
  
 My head's on fire in high esteem 
 Get drunk and sing along to Queen 
 Practice my T-Rex moves and make the scene 
 Yeah, I'd rather be anywhere doing anything 
 Yeah, I'd rather be anywhere doing anything 
 Yeah, I'd rather be anywhere doing anything 
  

 "New Test Leper"
 
 I can't say that I love Jesus 
 that would be a hollow claim. 
 He did make some observations 
 and I'm quoting them today. 
 "Judge not lest ye be judged." 
 what a beautiful refrain. 
 The studio audience disagrees. 
 Have his lambs all gone astray? 
  
 Call me a leper 
 Call me a leper 
 Call me a leper 
  
 "You are lost and disillusioned!" 
 what an awful thing to say. 
 I know this show doesn't matter. 
 It means nothing to me. 
 I thought I might help them understand 
 but what an ugly thing to see. 
 "I am not an animal" 
 subtitled under the screen. 
  
 Call me a leper 
 Call me a leper 
 Call me a leper 
  
 When I tried to tell my story 
 They cut me off to take a break. 
 I sat silent 5 commercuials 
 I had nothing left to say 
 The talk show host was index-carded 
  
 All organized and blank 
 The other guests were scared and hardened 
 What a sad parade. 
  
 What a sad parade 
  
 Call me a leper 
 Call me a leper 
 Call me a leper 


 "Undertow"
 
 I know what I wanted 
 I know what I wanted 
 I hnow how I wanted this to be 
  
 You go down to the water 
 Drink down of the water 
 Walk up off the water, leave it be 
  
 This is not my time, brother 
 It is cold in heaven 
 and I'm not sprouting wings. 
  
 I'm drowning 
 Me 
 I'm drowning 
 Me, yeah 
 
 Brother can you see those birds? 
 They don't look to heaven 
 They don't need religion, they can see 
  
 They go down to the water 
 Drink down on the water 
 Fly up off the water, leave it be 
  
 This is not my time, sister 
 It is cold in heaven 
 And no one's coming after me 
  
 I'm drowning 
 Breathing ourselves 
 Me 
 Breathing ourselves 
 I'm drowning 
 Breathing ourselves 
 Me, yeah 
  
 You know I am tired 
 Cold and bony tired 
 Nothing's gonna save me, I can see 
  
 I can't say I'm fearful 
 I can't say I'm not afraid 
 But I am not resisting, I can see 
  
 I don't need a heaven 
 I don't need religion 
 I am in the place where I should be 
  
 I am breathing water 
 I am breathing water 
 You know a body's got to breathe 
  
 I'm drowning 
 Breathing ourselves 
 Me 
 Breathing ourselves 
 I'm drowning 
 Breathing ourselves 
 Me, yeah 


 "E-Bow The Letter"
 
 Look up, what do you see? 
 All of you and all of me 
 Fluorescent and starry 
 Some of them, they surprise 
  
 The bus ride, I went to write this, 4:00 a.m. 
 This letter 
 Fields of poppies, little pearls 
 All the boys and all the girls sweet-toothed 
 Each and every one a little scary 
 I said your name 
  
 I wore it like a badge of teenage film stars 
 Hash bars, cherry mash and tinfoil tiaras 
 Dreaming of Maria Callas 
 Whoever she is 
 This fame thing, I don't get it 
 I wrap my hand in plastic to try to look through it 
 Maybelline eyes and girl-as-boy moves 
 I can take you far 
 This star thing, I don't get it 
  
 I'll take you over, there 
 I'll take you over, there 
 Aluminum, tastes like fear 
 Adrenaline, it pulls us near 
  
 I'll take you over 
 It tastes like fear, there 
 I'll take you over 
  
 Will you live to 83? 
 Will you ever welcome me? 
 Will you show me something that nobody else has seen? 
 Smoke it, drink 
 Here comes the flood 
 Anything to thin the blood 
 These corrosives do their magic slowly and sweet 
 Phone, eat it, drink 
 Just another chink 
 Cuts and dents, they catch the light 
 Aluminum, the weakest link 
  
 I don't want to disappoint you 
 I'm not here to anoint you 
 I would lick your feet 
 But is that sickest move? 
 I wear my own crown and sadness and sorrow 
 And who'd have thought tomorrow could be so strange? 
 My loss, and here we go again 
  
 I'll take you over, there 
 I'll take you over, there 
 Aluminum, tastes like fear 
 Adrenaline, it pulls us near 
  
 I'll take you over 
 It tastes like fear, there 
 I'll take you over 
  
 Look up, what do you see? 
 All of you and all of me 
 Fluorescent and starry 
 Some of them, they surprise 
  
 I can't look it in the eyes 
 Seconal, spanish fly, absinthe, kerosene 
 Cherry-flavored neck and collar 
 I can smell the sorrow on your breath 
 The sweat, the victory and sorrow 
 The smell of fear, I got it 
  
 I'll take you over, there 
 I'll take you over, there 
 Aluminum, tastes like fear 
 Adrenaline, it pulls us near 
  
 I'll take you over 
 It tastes like fear, there 
 I'll take you over 
  
 Pulls us near 
 Tastes like fear.. 
  
 Nearer, nearer 
 over, over, over, over 
 Yeah, look over 
 I'll take you there, oh, yeah 
 I'll take you there 
 Oh, over 
 I'll take you there 
 Over, let me 
 I'll take you there.. 
 There, there, baby, yeah 
  

 "Leave"
 
 Nothing could be bring me closer. 
 Nothing could be bring me near. 
 Where is the road I follow? 
 believing, leave. 
  
 It's under, under, under my feet. 
 The scene spread out there before me. 
 Better I go where the land touches sea. 
 There is my trust in what I believe. 
  
 That's what keeps me, 
 That's what keeps me, 
 That's what keeps me down, 
 to leave it, believe it, 
 leave it all behind. 
  
 Shifting the dream 
 nothing could bring me further from my old friend time 
 shifting the dream 
 charging the scene 
 I know where I marked the signs 
 Suffer the dreams of a world gone mad 
 I like it like that and I know it 
  
 I know it well, ugly and sweet 
 A temper man who said believe in his dream. 
  
 That's what keeps me 
 That's what keeps me 
 That's what keeps me down 
 I sent it on an airline plane 
 I sent it off in an airplane 
 that never left the ground. 
  
 That's what keeps me, 
 That's what keeps me, 
 That's what keeps me down, 
 To leave it, believe it. 
 leave it all behind. 
  
 Lift me, lift me, 
 I attain my dream. 
 I lost myself, I lost them. 
 heartache calling me. 
 I lost myself in sorrow 
 I lost myself in pain. 
 I lost myself in gravity, 
 Memory, leave, leave. 
  
 That's what keeps me, 
 That's what keeps me, 
 That's what keeps me down, 
 To leave it, believe it, 
 leave it all behind. 
  
 That's what keeps me, 
 That's what keeps me, 
 That's what keeps me down, 
 To leave it, believe it, 
 leave it all behind. 
  
 Midnight hands, my eyes are still 
 I walk into the scene 
 Shoot myself in a different place 
 Leavin' 
  
 Longed for this to take me, 
 Longed for my release 
 Waited for the coming 
 leavin', leave. 
  
 Leave, leave. 
 Leavin', leavin' 


 "Departure"
 
 Just arrived Singapore, San Sebastian, Spain, 26-hour trip. 
 Salt Lake City, come in spring. 
 Over the salt flats a hailstorm brought you back to me. 
 Salt Lake City, come in spring. 
 Over the salt flats a hailstorm brought you back to me. 
  
 Here it comes (I'm carried away) 
 Here it comes (I'm carried away) 
 Here it comes, back, back. 
  
 Departure, godspeed, bless his heart, good boy. 
 What a fuck-up, what a fighter. 
 A free-fall, motorcycle, hang-glider, 
 Hung on the line like a poison spider. 
 Win a eulogy from William Greider, 
 car crash, ptomaine, disposable lighter, 
 a bus plunge, avalanche, a vinegar cider. 
 Free-fall, motorcycle, hang-glider. 
  
 Here it comes (I'm carried away) 
 Here it comes (I'm carried away) 
 Here it comes, back, back. 
  
 Go, go, go, go, yeah. 
  
 Well, everybody is young forever. 
 There's so much to tell you, so little time. 
 I've come a long way since the whatever, 
 shit, I still see a word, think of you. 
 There is so much that I can't do, yeah. 
 You will be young forever. 
 There's so much that I can't do. 
 There is so much that I can't do. 
  
 Here it comes (I'm carried away) 
 Here it comes (I'm carried away) 
 Here it comes, back, back. 


 "Bittersweet Me"
 
 I move across, innocence lost 
 all flashing pulsar 
 I move across the earth in my new pattern shirt 
 I pass satellites. 
  
 "You're so bitter," your complaint 
 I can't give you anything. 
 I don't know who you're livin for 
 I don't who you are anymore. 
  
 I'd sooner chew my leg off, 
 Than be trapped in this. 
 How easy you think of all of this as bittersweet me 
  
 I couldn't taste it 
 I'm tired and naked. 
 I don't know what I'm hungry for 
 I don't know what I want anymore 
  
 I move across, candy floss 
 I move like a tank 
 I move across the room 
 with a heart full of gloom, 
 stronger than you think. 
  
 Oh my peer, 
 your veneer is wearing thin and cracking. 
 the surface informs that underneath, 
 underneath is lacking. 
  
 I'd sooner chew my leg off, 
 Than be trapped in this. 
 How easy you think of all of this as bittersweet me 
  
 I couldn't taste it. 
 I'm tired and naked. 
 I don't know what I'm hungry for. 
 I don't know what I want anymore. 
  
 You move across, innocence lost, 
 all static and desire, 
 you're blue in the face from navel gaze, 
 you set yourself on fire. 
  
 You strip down and lay yourself out, 
 I know you can't fake it, 
 But are you tire and naked? 
 Are you tire and naked? 
  
 I'd sooner chew my leg off, 
 Than be trapped in this. 
 How easy you think of all of this as bittersweet me 
  
 I couldn't taste it 
 I'm tired and naked. 
 I don't know what I'm hungry for. 
 I don't know what I want anymore. 


 "Be Mine"
 
 ("a speed zone up here too") 
  
 I never thought of this as funny 
 It speaks another world to me 
 I wanna be your Easter bunny 
 I wanna be your Christmas tree. 
 
 I'll strip the world that you must live in 
 of all its godforsaken greed. 
 I'll ply the tar out of your feathers. 
 I'll pluck the thorns out of your feet. 
 You and me. 
 You and me. 
 You and me. 
  
 And if I choose your sanctuary. 
 I'll want to wash you with my hair. 
 I'll want to drink of sacred fountains 
 and find the riches hidden there. 
 
 I'll eat the lotus and peyote. 
 I'll want to hear the caged-bird sing. 
 I'll want the secrets of the temple. 
 I'll want the finger with the ring. 
 You and me. 
 You and me. 
 You and me. 
 
 And if you make me your religion. 
 I'll give you all the room you'll need. 
 I'll be the drawing of your breath. 
 I'll be the cup if you should bleed. 
 I'll be the sky above the Ganges 
 I'll be the vast and stormy sea. 
 I'll be the lights that guide you inland. 
 I'll be the visions you will see. 
 Visions you will see. 
 You will see. 
 You will see. 
 You and me. 
 You and me. 
 You and me. 


 "Binky The Doormat"
 
 This is horror movie stuff. 
 the muffin is peach, you're 'makin' love'. 
 you mean this opera involves handcuffs? 
 I lay defeated. 
 yeah, sour milk mouth, horseradish sweet. 
 she's a girl and she's loving me. 
 but distance is my tendency. 
 I am defeated. 
  
 have you lost your place? 
 I wore my doormat face. 
 I hung my this or that. 
 I laid my welcome mat. 
  
 If I'm your oyster, where's the war? 
 you leave me gasping, tattered and torn. 
 I know you can't find a fork. 
 I am just a little acorn. 
 well, acorns grow to mighty trees. 
 you've got sauce, but you don't have knees. 
 now look who's asking pretty please. 
 I lay defeated. 
  
 have you lost your place? 
 i wore my doormat face. 
 I hung my this or that. 
 I laid my welcome mat. 
  
 Call your bathroom friends around. 
 I will fake a little frown. 
 I will be your little clown, 
 easily defeated. 
 yeah, shut the door and open wide. 
 seconal and astroglide. 
 fuck with me and traumatize. 
 don't you see i love your hide? 
 all the beauty that's trapped inside. 
 can't you see i love your hide? 
 can't you see i love your hide? 
 can't you see it? 
  
 have you lost your place? 
 I wore my doormat face. 
 I hung my this or that. 
 I laid my welcome mat. 


 "So Fast, So Numb"
 
 You're movin' through rough waters motel boy, 
 and swimming in your sleep. 
 How could I be so blind, mis-sighted, 
 not to see there's something wounded deep? 
  
 Anyone could scratch your surface now, 
 it's all amphetamine 
 you're blasting yourself into the present 
 learn some vast indignity, say that, 
  
 You say that you hate it, 
 you want to re-create it 
 I've been around, I've been your lover. 
 I let it go at Kill Devil Hill, 
 You're coming onto something so fast, so numb 
 that you can't even feel. 
  
 You're drinking the raw Drano baby, 
 You do-si-do, saddo 
 You're you in cartilage, shark-eyed, shock horror, all present tense, 
 and boy your blood is running cold. 
 Listen, this is now, this is here, this is me, 
 this is what I wanted you to see. 
 That was then, was that, that is gone, this is past, 
 you cast yourself cast, passed by, gone down fast, you say, 
  
 You say that you hate it. 
 You want to recreate it. 
 I've played this round, I've played your lover. 
 I've played it out to the hilt. 
 You're comin' on with something so fast, so numb 
 that you can't even feel. 
  
 You love it. You hate it. 
 You want to re-create it. 
 Now, this is here, this is me, 
 This is what I wanted you to see. 
 That was then, was that, that is gone. 
 That is what I wanted you to feel. 
  
 You love it. You hate it. 
 You spit it out, the bitter pill. 
 I've been around, I've been your lover 
 I let it go at Kill Devil Hill. 
 You're coming onto something so fast, so numb 
 that you can't even feel. 
  
 I've played this round, I've played your lover. 
 I've played it out to the hilt. 
 You're comin' on with something so fast, so numb 
 that you can't even feel. 
  
 you played around, you played me lover, 
 I let it go at Kill Devil Hill. 
 You're moving so hard, so fast, so numb 
 that you can't even feel. 


 "Low Desert"
 
 It happened fast, it's over quick. 
 a little dust and the engine kicks. 
 Did your hands drift down off the wheel? 
 a road owl hit your windshield 
  
 An eyelash or a little bit of sleep? Time stands still. 
 Just call it now and you're on your way (hey, hey, hey) 
  
 All the ashtrays, cities and the freeway drives 
 Broken casino and waterslide 
 Eighteen-wheeler, payback dice. 
 Gravity pulls on the power line. 
  
 Jet stream cuts the desert sky. 
 This is a land could eat a man alive. 
 Say you'd leave it all behind. 
  
 There's a radio tower that's egging me on 
 Back to the place where you never belong. 
 Where people thrive on their own contempt. 
 Whatever meaning is long gone, spent. 
 If you had to guess or make bet, 
 would you place yourself inside of it? 
 the mountains yawn, the clouds let out a sigh. 
 "Tricked again." Let go, okay. 


 "Electrolite"
 
 Your eyes are burning holes through me. 
 I'm gasoline. 
 I'm burnin' clean. 
  
 Twentieth century go and sleep. 
 You're plasticine. 
 That is obscene. 
 That is obscene. 
  
 You are the star tonight. 
 Your sun electric, outta sight. 
 Your light eclipsed the moon tonight. 
 Elecrolite. You're outta sight. 
  
 If I ever want to fly. 
 Mulholland Drive. 
 I am alive. 
  
 Hollywood is under me. 
 I'm Martin Sheen 
 I'm Steve McQueen 
 I'm Jimmy Dean 
  
 You are the star tonight. 
 Your sun electric, outta sight. 
 Your light eclipsed the moon tonight. 
 Elecrolite. 
 You're outta sight. 
  
 If you want to fly. 
 Mulholland Drive. 
 Up in the sky. 
 Stand on a cliff and look down there. 
 Don't be scared, you are alive. 
 You are alive. 
  
 You are the star tonight. 
 Your sun electric outta sight. 
 Your light eclipsed the moon tonight. 
 Elecrolite. 
 You're outta sight. 
  
 Twentieth century go and sleep. 
 Really deep. 
 We won't blink 
  
 You're eyes are burnin' holes through me. 
 I'm not scared 
 I'm outta here. 
 I'm not scared. 
 I'm outta here.
 

 ALBUM: RECKONING 
  
 
 "Harborcoat" 
 
 They crowded up to Lenin with their noses worn off 
 A handshake is worthy if it's all that you've got 
 Metal shoes on wood push through our back 
 There's a splinter in your eye and it reads "REACT" 
  
 They shifted the statues for harboring ghosts 
 Reddened their necks, collared their clothes 
 Then we danced the dance till the menace got out 
 She gathered the corners and called it her gown 
  
 Please find my harborcoat, can't go outside without it 
 Find my harborcoat, can't go outside without it 
  
 They crowded up to Lenin with their noses worn off 
 A handshake is worthy if it's all that you've got 
 Metal shoes on wood push through our back 
 There's a splinter in your eye and it reads "REACT", R-E-A-C-T 
  
 They shifted the statues for harboring ghosts 
 Reddened their necks, collared their clothes 
 Then we danced the dance till the menace got out 
 She gathered the corners and called it her gown 
  
 She said... 

 
 "Seven Chinese Brothers" 
 
 This mellow, sweet, short-haired boy, woman offers pull up a seat 
 Take in one symphony now, we've just begun to battle 
 Wrap your heel in bones of steel, turn the leg, a twist of color 
 Autumn waited hold it to you in the colored come another 
  
 Seven chinese brothers swallowing the ocean 
 Seven thousand years to sleep away the pain 
 She will return, she will return 
  
 This mellow, sweet, short-haired boy, woman offers pull up a seat 
 Take in one symphony now, we've just begun to battle 
 Wrap your heel in bones of steel, turn the leg, a twist of color 
 Autumn waded seven seas swimming colored come another 
  
 Seven chinese brothers swallowing the ocean 
 Seven thousand years to sleep away the pain 
 She will return, she will return 
  
 This mellow, sweet, short-haired boy, woman offers pull up a chair 
 Take in one symphony now, I guess we lost that battle 
 Wrap your heel in bones of steel, turn the leg, a twist of color 
 Autumn waded seven seas swimming colored come another 
 
 Seven chinese brothers swallowing the ocean 
 Seven thousand years the Communi did reign 
 She will return, she will return 
 

 "So. Central Rain (I'm Sorry)"
 (parts quoted by Michael Stipe in Rolling Stone in a letter in Dec 1988) 
 
 Did you never call? I waited for your call 
 These rivers of suggestion are driving me away 
 The trees will bend, the cities wash away 
 The city on the river there is a girl without a dream 
  
 I'm sorry 
  
 Eastern to Mountain, third party call, the lines are down 
 The wise man built his words upon the rocks 
 But I'm not bound to follow suit 
 The trees will bend, the conversation's dimmed 
 Go build yourself another home, this choice isn't mine 
  
 Did you never call? I waited for your call 
 These rivers of suggestion are driving me away 
 The ocean sang, the conversation's dimmed 
 Go build yourself another dream, this choice isn't mine 
 
 
 "Pretty Persuasion" 
 
 It's what I want, hurry and buy, 
 all has been tried, follow reason and buy, 
 Cannot shuffle in this heat, it's all wrong 
 Try to put that on your sleeve it's all wrong it's all wrong 
  
 He's got a pretty persuasion 
 She's got pretty persuasion 
 God damn, pure confusion 
 She's got pretty persuasion 
  
 It's what I want, hurry and buy, 
 all has been tried, follow reasoning, 
 And I put that in this heat it's all wrong 
 Try to wear that on my sleeve it's all wrong all wrong 
  
 He's got a pretty persuasion 
 She's got pretty persuasion 
 God damn, pure confusion 
 He's got pretty persuasion 
  
 In the light I saw 
 quite a scene there 
  
 It's what I want, hurry and buy, 
 all has been tried, follow reason and buy, 
 Try to put that in this heat it's all wrong 
 Cannot wear that on your sleeve it's all wrong it's all wrong 
 
 
 "Time After Time (Annelise)" 
 
 Ask the girl of the hour by the water tower's watch 
 If your friends took a fall, are you obligated to follow 
 
 Time after time after time 
  
 when the bull's on his hooves, when you gather friends by the tower 
 If you try to refuse, will they judge your worth by the hour? 
  
 If your tired and you're tried you can find me in my room 
 You can stay if you want and the third time you can't lose 
  
 Ask the girl of the hour, by the water tower's watch 
 We can fight if you want but who will turn out the light 

 
 "Second Guessing" 
 
 Why're you trying to second guess me? 
 I am tired of second guessing 
 What will be your look this season? 
 Who will be your book this season? 
  
 Why're you trying to second guess me? 
 I am tired of second guessing 
 What will be your look this season? 
 Who will be your book this season? 
  
 Here we are 
  
 Why're you trying to second guess me? 
 I am tired of second guessing 
 What will be your look this season? 
 Be in my club, write a book this season 
 
 
 "Letter Never Sent" 
 
 It's been pretty simple so far, vacation in Athens is calling me 
 And knock, knock, knock on wood, I thought I'd left you behind 
 Heaven is yours, heaven is yours, heaven's yours where I live 
  
 The thought of the catacombs left my soul at home 
 This letter never sent 
 And it's so far, it's so dark, i'm so lost 
 Heaven's yours, heaven's yours, heaven's yours where I live 
 (Another story, another story for a while, someone show me) 
 When I'm moving too fast, where's my new address? 
 
 The water is evening now, the catacombs are filling in 
 If my soul was made of stone, no, not, not so dark, dark 
  
 And it's so far, it's so dark, i'm so lost 
 And it's so far, it's so far, it's so far 
  
 Heaven's yours, heaven's yours, heaven's yours where I live 
 (Another story, another story for a while, someone show me) 
 Heaven's yours, heaven's yours, heaven's yours where I live 
 (Another story, another story for a while, someone show me) 


 "Camera" 
 
 From the inside room when the front room greeting 
 Becomes your special book, it was simple then 
 When the party lulls, if we fall by the side 
  
 Will you be remembered? Will she be remembered? 
 Alone in a crowd, a bartered lantern borrowed 
 If I'm to be your camera, then who will be your face? 
  
 I fell by your bed once, I didn't want to tell you 
 I should keep myself in between the pages 
 Of the green light room if we fall by the side 
  
 From the inside room when the front room greeting 
 Becomes your special book, it was simple then 
 When the party lulls, if we fall by the side 
 I still like you, can you remember? 

 
 "(Don't Go Back To) Rockville" 
 
 Looking at your watch a third time waiting in the station for a bus 
 Going to a place that's far, so far away and if that's not enough 
 Going where nobody says hello, they don't talk to anybody they don't know 
 You'll wind up in some factory that's full time filth and nowhere left to go 
 Walk home to an empty house, sit around all by yourself 
 I know it might sound strange, but I believe 
 You'll be coming back before too long 
 
 Don't go back to Rockville 
 And waste another year 
  
 At night I drink myself to sleep and pretend 
 I don't care if you're not here with me 
 'Cause it's so much easier to handle 
 All my problems if I'm too far out to sea 
 But something better happen soon 
 Or it's gonna be too late to bring you back 
  
 It's not as though I really need you 
 If you were here I'd only bleed you 
 But everybody else in town only wants to bring you down and 
 That's not how it ought to be 
 I know it might sound strange, but I believe 
 You'll be coming back before too long 
 
 
 "Little America" 
 
 I can't see myself at thirty, I don't buy a lacquered thirty 
 Caught like flies, preserved for tomorrow's jewelery, again 
 Lighted in the amber yard, a green shellback, green shellback 
 Preserved for tomorrow's eyes, in tree beer tar-black brer sap, 
 The biggest wagon is the empty wagon is the noisiest, 
 The consul a horse, Jefferson I think we're lost 
 
 Who will tend the farm museums? Who will dust today's belongings? 
 Who will sweep the floors, hedging near the givens? 
 Rally round your leaders it's the mediator season 
 Diane is on the beach, do you realize the life she's led? 
 The biggest wagon is the empty wagon is the noisiest, 
 The consul a horse, oh man I think we're lost 
 The biggest wagon is the empty wagon is the noisiest, 
 A matter of course, Jefferson, Jeffer 
  
 Lighted in the amber yard, a green shellback, green shellback 
 Sky-lied, sty-tied, Nero pie-tied, in tree tar-black brer sap, 
 Reason has harnessed the tame, a lodging, not stockader's game 
 Another Greenville, another Magic Mart, Jeffer, grab your fiddle, 
 The biggest wagon is the empty wagon is the noisiest, 
 The consul a horse, Jefferson I think we're lost 
 The biggest wagon is the empty wagon is the noisiest, 
 The consul a horse, Jefferson I think we're lost


 ALBUM: MURMUR
 
 
 "Radio Free Europe" 
 
 Beside yourself if radio's gonna stay. 
 Reason: it could polish up the grey. 
 Put that, put that, put that up your wall 
 That this isn't country at all 
  
 Raving station, beside yourself 
  
 Keep me out of country in the word 
 Deal the porch is leading us absurd. 
 Push that, push that, push that to the hull 
 That this isn't nothing at all. 
  
 Straight off the boat, where to go? 
 Calling on in transit, calling on in transit 
 Radio Free Europe 
  
 Beside defying media too fast 
 Instead of pushing palaces to fall 
 Put that, put that, put that before all 
 That this isn't fortunate at all 
  
 Raving station, beside yourself 
 Calling on in transit, calling on in transit 
 Radio Free Europe, radio. 
  
 Decide yourself, calling all of the medias too fast 
  
 Keep me out of country in the word 
 Disappoint is into us absurd 
  
 Straight off the boat, where to go? 
 Calling on in transit, calling on in transit 
 Radio Free Europe 
  
 
 "Pilgrimage" 
 
 Take a turn, take a turn 
 Take our fortune, take our fortune 
  
 They called the clip a two-headed cow 
 Your hate clipped and distant, your luck, pilgrimage 
 Rest assured this will not last, take a turn for the worst 
 Your hate clipped and distant, your luck a two-headed cow 
 The pilgrimage has gained momentum 
 Take a turn, take a turn 
 Take our fortune, take our fortune 
  
 Speakin' in tongues, it's worth a broken lip 
 Your hate clipped and distant, your luck, pilgrimage 
 Rest assured this will not last, take a turn for the worst 
 Your hate clipped and distant, your luck a two-headed cow 
 The pilgrimage has gained momentum 
 Take a turn, take a turn 
 Take our fortune, take our fortune 
  
 Pilgrimage. Pilgrimage.

 "Laughing" 
 
 Laocoon and her two sons 
 Pressured storm, tried to move 
 No other more, emotion bound 
 Martyred, misconstrued 
  
 Lighted in a room, lanky room 
 Lighted, lighted, laughing in tune 
 Lighted, lighted, laughing 
  
 Laocoon and her two sons 
 Run the gamut, sated view 
 Know them more, emotion bound 
 Martyred, misconstrued 
  
 Lighted in a room, lanky room 
 Lighted, lighted, laughing in tune 
 Lighted, lighted, laughing 
  
 In a room, lock the door, latch the room 
 Lighted, lighted, laughing 
  
 Laocoon and her two sons 
 Ran the gamut, settled new, 
 Find a place fit to laugh, 
 Lock the doors, latch the room 
 Lighted in a room, lanky room 
 Lighted, lighted, laughing in tune 
 Lighted, lighted, laughing in tune 
 Lighted, lighted, laughing in tunes 
 Lighted, lighted, laughing in tunes 
  
 
 "Talk About the Passion" 
 
 Empty prayer, empty mouths, combien reaction 
 Empty prayer, empty mouths, talk about the passion 
 Not everyone can carry the weight of the world 
 Not everyone can carry the weight of the world 
  
 Talk about the passion 
 Talk about the passion 
  
 Empty prayer, empty mouths, combien reaction 
 Empty prayer, empty mouths, talk about the passion 
 Combien, combien, combien de temps? 
  
 Not everyone can carry the weight of the world 
 Not everyone can carry the weight of the world 
 Combien, combien, combien de temps? 
  
 Talk about the passion 
 Talk about the passion

 "Moral Kiosk" 
 
 Scratch the scandals in the twilight 
 Trying to shock but instead 
 Idle hands all orient to her 
 Pass a magic pillow under head 
 It's so much more attractive inside the moral kiosk 
 Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight 
 Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight 
 
 They scratch the scandals in the twilight 
 She was laughing like a Horae 
 Put that knee in dour landslide 
 Take this step to dash a roving eye 
 It's so much more attractive inside the moral kiosk 
 Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight 
 Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight 
  
 (repeat first verse) 
  
  
 "Perfect Circle" 
 
 Put your hair back, we get to leave 
 Eleven gallows on your sleeve 
 Shallow figure, winner's paid 
 Eleven shadows way out of place 
 Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room 
 Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room 
 Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room 
  
 Pull your dress on and stay real close 
 Who might leave you where I left off? 
 A perfect circle of acquaintances and friends 
 Drink another, coin a phrase 
 Heaven assumed, shoulders high in the room 
 Heaven assumed, shoulders high in the room 
 Heaven assumed, shoulders high in the room 
 
 Try to win and suit your needs 
 Speak out sometimes but try to win 
 Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room 
 Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room 
 Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room 
 Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room 
 Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room 
 
 
 "Catapult" 
 
 Ooooo, we were little boys 
 Ooooo, we were little girls 
 It's nine o'clock, don't try to turn it off 
 Cowered in a hole, opie mouth. Question: 
 Did we miss anything? Did we miss anything? 
 Did we miss anything? Did we miss anything? 
 Catapult. Catapult. Catapult. Catapult. 
  
 Ooooo, we were little boys 
 Ooooo, we were little girls 
 It's nine o'clock, don't try to turn it off 
 Cowered in a hole, opie mouth. 
 We in step, in hand, your mother remembers this. 
 Hear the howl of the rope, a question: 
 Did we miss anything? Did we miss anything? 
 Did we miss anything? Did we miss anything? 
 Catapult. Catapult. Catapult. Catapult. 
 
 March could be darker. March could be darker. 
 Catapult. Catapult. Catapult. Catapult. 
  
 (Repeat 2nd verse) 
 
 
 "Sitting Still" 
 
 This name I got we all agreed 
 See could stop stop it will rid 
 We could bind it in the cist 
 We could gather, throw a fit 
  
 Up to buy, Katie buys a kitchen-size, but not Mae Ann 
 Setting trap for love, making a waste of time, sitting still 
  
 I'm the sign and you can read. 
 I'm the sign and you're not deaf. 
 We could bind it in the cist. 
 We could gather, throw a fit. 
  
 Up to buy, Katie buys a kitchen-size, but not Mae Ann 
 Setting trap for love, making a waste of time, sitting still 
 I can hear you. I can hear you. I can hear you. 
  
 This name I got we all agree

 Setting trap for love, making a waste of time, sitting still 
 I can hear you. I can hear you. I can hear you. 
  
 You can gather when I talk, talk until you're blue 
 You could get away from me. Get away from me. 
  
 Up to buy, Katie buys a kitchen-size, but not me 
 Setting trap for love, making a waste of time, sitting still 
 I can hear you. I can hear you. I can hear you. 
 I can hear you. I can hear you. I can hear you. 
 Can you hear me? 
 
 
 "9-9"
 
 Steady repetition is a compulsion mutually reenforced. 
 Now what does that mean? 
 Is there a just contradiction? 
 Nothing much. 
 Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. 
 If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord, hesitate. 
  
 Got to punch 
 Right on target 
 Twisting tongues 
 Gotta stripe down his back 
 all nine yards down her back 
  
 Give me a couple, 
 Don't give me a couple of pointers, 
 Turn to lies and conversation fear 
 Got to punch 
 Right on target 
 Twisting tongues 
 Gotta stripe down his back 
 all nine yards down her back 
  
 Give me a couple, 
 Don't give me a couple of pointers, 
 Turn to lies and conversation fear 
  
 What is in my mind? 
 What is in my mind? 
  
 Steady repetition is a compulsion mutually reenforced. 
 Now what does that mean?

 Nothing much.

 If I should die before I wake, oh come on, hesitate, hesitate.

 "Shaking Through" 
 
 Could it be that one small voice doesn't count in the world? 
 Yellow like a geisha gown, denial all the way 
 Could this by three be turned? Honor marches on. 
 Yellow like a geisha gown, denial all the way 
  
 Shaking through, opportune. Shaking through, opportune. 
  
 Are we grown way too far? 
 Taking after rain 
 Yellow like a geisha gown, denial all the way 
 Shaking through, opportune. Shaking through, opportune. 
  
 In my life. 
 
 Is that a steal? 
 Children of today on parade, 
 Yellow like a geisha gown, denial all the way 
 Shaking through, opportune. Shaking through, opportune. 
 Shaking through, opportune. Shaking through, opportune. 
  
  
 "We Walk" 
 
 Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall 
 Take oasis, Marat's bathing 
 We walk through the wood we walk 
 Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall 
 Take oasis, Marat's bathing 
 We walk through the woods we walk 
 Take oasis take oasis take oasis take oasis 
 Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall 
 Take oasis, Marat's bathing 
 We walk through the world we walk 
 Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall 
 Take oasis, Marat's bathing

 Take oasis, Marat's bathing 
 Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall 
 Into the hall 
 
 
 "West of the Fields" 
 
 Long gone, intuition to assume are gone when we try. 
 Dream of a living jungle in my way back home when we die. 
  
 West of the fields. West of the fields. West of the fields. West of the
     fields.
 Long gone. Long gone. Long gone. Long gone. West of the fields. 
  
 Dreams of Elysian, to assume are gone when we try 
 Tell now what is dreaming 
 When we try to listen with your eyes oversimplify 
  
 The animals, how strange. Try, try to stick it in. 
 The animals, how strange. Try, try to stick it in. 
  
 Dreams of Elysian, to assume are gone when we try 
 Tell now what is dreaming when we try. 
 Listen through your eyes when we die. 
  
 West of the fields. West of the fields. West of the fields. West of the
     fields.
 Long gone. Long gone. Long gone. Long gone. West of the fields.


 ALBUM: FABLES OF THE RECONSTRUCTION 
 
 
 "Feeling Gravity's Pull" 
 
 I fell asleep and read just about every paragraph. 
  
 Read the scene where gravity is pulling me around 
 Peel back the mountains peel back the sky 
 Stomp gravity into the floor 
 It's a Man Ray kind of sky 
 Let me show you what I can do with it 
 Time and distance are out of place here 
  
 Step up, step up, step up the sky is open-armed 
 When the light is mine, I felt gravity pull 
  
 Somewhere near the end it said 
 "You can't do this", I said "I can too" 
 Shift sway rivers shift, oceans fall and mountains drift 
 It's a Man Ray kind of sky 
 Let me show you what I can do with it 
  
 Step up, step up, step up the sky is open-armed 
 When the light is mine, I felt gravity pull onto my eyes, 
 holding my head straight (looking down). 
 This is the easiest task I've ever had to do...

 Reason had harnessed the tame 
 Holding the sky in their arms 
 Gravity pulls me down 
  
 
 "Maps and Legends" 
 (for the Rev. Howard Finster, "a man of vision and feeling -  
 a fine example to all") 
 
 He's not to be reached, he's to be reached. 
 He's not to be reached, he's to be reached. 
  
 Called the fool and the company, 
 On his own where he'd rather be. 
 Where he ought to be, he sees what you can't see, can't you see that? 
  
 Maybe he's caught in the legend, 
 maybe he's caught in the mood. 
 Maybe these maps and legends 
 have been misunderstood. 
  
 Down the way the road's divided, 
 Paint me the places you have seen. 
 Those who know what I don't know 
 refer to the yellow, red and green 
  
 Maybe he's caught in the legend, 
 maybe he's caught in the mood. 
 Maybe these maps and legends 
 have been misunderstood. 
  
 He's not to be reached, he's to be reached. (4 times) 
  
 The map that you painted didn't seem real. 
 He just sings whatever he's seen 
 Point to the legend, point to the east, 
 Point to the yellow, red and green 
  
 Maybe he's caught in the legend, 
 maybe he's caught in the mood. 
 Maybe these maps and legends 
 have been misunderstood, been misunderstood. (Maps and legends) 
  
 (Maps and legends) Is he to be reached? He's not to be reached. 
 (Maps and legends) Is he to be reached? He's not to be reached. 
 (Maps and legends) Is he to be reached? He's not to be reached anymore. 
  
 
 "Driver 8" 
 
 The walls are built up, stone by stone, 
 the fields divided one by one. 
 And the train conductor says 
 "Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break 
 We've been on this shift too long" 
  
 And the train conductor says 
 "Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break 
 We can reach our destination, but we're still a ways away" 
  
 I saw a treehouse on the outskirts of the farm. 
 The power lines have floaters so the airplanes won't get snagged. 
 Bells are ringing through the town again, 
 Children look up, all they hear is sky-blue, bells ringing 
  
 And the train conductor says 
 "Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break 
 We can reach our destination, but we're still a ways away" 
  
 Way to shield the hated heat. 
 Way to put myself to sleep. 
 Way to shield the hated heat. 
 Way to put myself, my children to sleep. 
 
 He piloted this song in a plane like that one. 
 She is selling faith on the Go Tell crusade. 
 Locomotive 8, Southern Crescent, hear the bells ring again. 
 Field to weed is stricken thin 
 
 And the train conductor says 
 "Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break 
 We've been on this shift too long." 
 And the train conductor says 
 "Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break 
 We can reach our destination, but we're still a ways away" 
 
 
 "Life and How To Live It" 
 
 Burn bright through the night, two pockets lead the way 
 To doors to go between the wall was raised today 
 To doors remain before your others and your own 
 Keep these books well stocked away and take your happy home 
  
 My carpenter's out and running about, talking to the street 
 My pockets are out and running about 
 Barking in the street to tell what I have hidden there 
  
 Burn bright through the night, two pockets lead the way 
 Two doors to go between the wall was raised today 
 Raise the walls and shout its flaws, a carpenter should rest 
 So that when you tire of one side the other serves you best 
 
 My carpenter's out and running about, talking to the street 
 My pockets are out and running about 
 Barking in the street to tell what I have hidden there 
  
 The hills ringing hear the words in time 
 Listen to the holler, listen to my walls within my tongue 
 Can't you see you made my ears go tin? 
 the air quicken tension building inference suddenly 
 Life and how to live it 
 
 Raise the walls and shout its flaws, a carpenter should rest 
 So that when you tire of one side the other serves you best 
 Read about the wisdom lost, a knock, a knock, a knock 
 A secret knock one hammer's locked the other wisdom lost 
 
 My carpenter's out and running about, talking to the street 
 My pockets are out and running about 
 Barking in the street to tell what I have hidden there 
 My carpenter's out and running about, barking in the, listen to the holler 
 My pockets are out and running about 
 Barking in the street to tell what I have hidden there 
 
 Listen, listen to the holler, 
 If I write a book it will be called "Life and How to Live It" 
  
  
 "Old Man Kensey" 
 
 Old Man Kensey wants to be a sign painter 
 First he's got to learn to read 
 He's gonna be a clown on TV 
 Flexes his elbow taunt and free 
 That's my folly, I believe 
 Drink up the lake Kensey's awake 
 That's my folly, that's my mistake 
  
 Old Man Kensey wants to be a goalie 
 First he's got to learn to count 
 He's gonna be a clown on a circus mount 
 Letters to be signed and dropped off 
 Kensey's going far 
 John, Bill and Ed, stand on your head 
 That's my folly, I'm ready to go 
 
 Old Man Kensey wants to be a dog catcher 
 First he's got to learn to stand 
 He's gonna be a clown in a marching band 
 Letters to be signed ransom greed 
 That's my folly, I believe 
 Drink up the lake, John, Bill and Ed, 
 That's my folly, that's my mistake 
 Kensey's awake, stand on your head 
 That's my folly, I'm ready to go 
  

 "Can't Get There From Here"
 
 When the world is a monster 
 Bad to swallow you whole 
 Kick the clay that holds the teeth in 
 Throw your trolls out the door 
  
 If you're needing inspiration 
 Philomath is where I go 
 Lawyer Jeff he knows the low-down 
 He's mighty bad to visit home 
  
 (I've been there I know the way) 
 Can't get there from here 
 (I've been there I know the way) 
 Can't get there from here 
 (I've been there I know the way) 
 Can't get there from here 
 (I've been there I know the way) 
  
 When your hands are feeling empty 
 Stickheads jumping off the ground 
 Tris is sure to shirr the deers out 
 Brother Ray can sing my song 
  
 (I've been there I know the way) 
 Can't get there from here 
 (I've been there I know the way) 
 Can't get there from here 
 (I've been there I know the way) 
 Can't get there from here 
 (I've been there I know the way) 
  
 Hands down, Calechee bound 
 Land locked, kiss the ground 
 The dirt of seven continents going 
 round and round 
 Go on ahead Mr. Citywide 
 hypnotize, suit and tie 
 Gentlemen testify 
  
 If your world is a monster 
 Bad to swallow you whole 
 Philomath they know the low-down 
 Throw your trolls out the door 
  
 (I've been there I know the way) 
 Can't get there from here 
 (I've been there I know the way) 
 Can't get there from here 
 (I've been there I know the way) 
 Can't get there from here 
 (I've been there I know the way) 
  
 (Thank you, Ray) 
 
 
 "Green Grow the Rushes"
 
 The wheelbarrow's fallen 
 Look at my hands 
 They've found some surplus, cheaper hands 
 Rubbing palms and pick and choose, 
 who will they choose? Here is the news. 
  
 Look at that building, look at this man 
 Haloed and whitewashed 
 Gone to find a cheaper hand 
 he'll offer a pound, offer a pound. 
  
 Green grow the rushes go 
 Green grow the rushes go 
 Green grow the rushes go 
 The compass points the workers home 
  
 Pay for your freedom, find another gate 
 Guilt by associate, the rushes wilted a long time ago 
 Guilty as you go 
  
 Stay off that highway, word is it's not so safe 
 The grasses that hide the greenback 
 The amber waves of gain again 
 The amber waves of gain 
  
 Green grow the rushes go 
 Green grow the rushes go 
 Green grow the rushes go 
 The compass points the workers home 
 

 "Kohoutek"
 
 Who will stand alone? 
  
 She carried ribbons, she wore them out 
 Courage built a bridge, jealous tore it down 
 At least it's something you've left behind 
 Like Kohoutek, you were gone 
  
 We sat in the garden, we stood on the porch 
 I won't deny myself, we never talked 
  
 She wore bangles, she wore bells 
 On her toes and she jumped like a fish 
 Like a flyin' friend, you were gone 
 Like Kohoutek, can't forget that 
  
 Fever built a bridge, reason tore it down 
 If I am one to follow.. who will stand alone? 
  
 Maybe you're not the problem 
 scissors, paper, stone 
 If you stand and holler, these prayers will talk 
  
 She carried ribbons, she wore them out 
 Michael built a bridge...Michael tore it down 
 At least it's something you've left behind 
 Like Kohoutek, you were gone 
  
 Michael built a bridge... Michael tore it down 
 If I stand and holler... will I stand alone? 
  

 "Auctioneer (another engine)"
 
 She didn't want to get pinned down by her prior town 
 Get me to the train on time, here take this nickel make a dime 
 Take this penny and make it into a necklace when I leave 
 What is at the other end, I don't know another friend 
 Another wife, another morning spent 
 Listen, listen to the auctioneer 
 Another engine, another engine 
  
 We never wrote the reasons that I need explained 
 Some things are givens, and others get away 
 This time its for myself you call it what you may 
 Okay, we won't say goodbye so long, so much more 
 Listen to the auctioneer 
 Another engine, another engine 
  
 Listen to the bargain holler 
 Listen to the barter holler 
 Listen to the auctioneer 
  
 Get me to the train on time here take this nickel make a dime 
 Take this penny and make it into a necklace when I leave 
 What is at the other end, an I don't know another friend 
 Another wife, another morning spent 
 Listen to the auctioneer 
 Another engine, another engine 
  
 Do I stand the bargain holler? 
 Listen to the barter holler 
 Listen to the auctioneer 
  

 "Good Advices"
 
 When you greet a stranger look at his shoes 
 Keep your money in your shoes put your trouble behind 
 When you greet a stranger look at her hands 
 Keep your money in your hands put your travel behind 
 Who are you going to call for, what do you have to say 
 Keep your hat on your head home is a long way away 
 At the end of the day, I'll forget your name 
 I'd like it here if I could leave and see you from a long way away 
  
 When you greet a stranger, look at her shoes 
 Keep you memories in your shoes, put your travel behind 
 Who are you going to call for, what do you have to say 
 Keep your hat on your head 
 Home is a long way away 
 At the end of the day, when there are no friends 
 When there are no lovers, who are you going to call for 
 What do you have to change 
  
 A familiar face a foreign place I forget your name 
 I'd like it here if I could leave and see you from a long way away 
 Who are you going to call for, what do you have to say 
 Keep your hat on your head 
 Home is a long way away 


 "Wendell Gee"
 
 That's when Wendell Gee takes a tug 
 Upon the string that held the line of trees 
 Behind the house he lived in 
 He was reared to give respect 
 But somewhere down the line he chose 
 To whistle as the wind blows 
 Whistle as the wind blows, with me 
  
 He had a dream one night 
 That the tree had lost its middle 
 So he built a trunk of chicken wire 
 To try to hold it up 
 But the wire, the wire turned to lizard skin 
 And when he climbed inside 
 There wasn't even time to say 
 Goodbye to Wendell Gee 
 So whistle as the wind blows 
 Whistle as the wind blows, with me 
  
 If the wind were colors 
 And if the air could speak 
 Then whistle as the wind blows 
 Whistle as the wind blows

 "Looking Down the Barrel Of a Gun"
 by Beastie Boys

 Rolling down the hill snowballing getting bigger
 An explosion in the chamber the hammer from the trigger
 I seen him get stabbed I watched the blood spill out
 He had more cuts than my man Chuck Chillout
 24 is my age 22 is my gauge
 Writing rhymes on a page going off in a rage
 Out on a mission a stolen car mission
 Had a little problem with the transmission
 3 on the tree in the middle of the night
 I have this steak on my head cause I got into a fist fight
 Life comes in phases take the good with the bad
 You bought those coins on the street and you got had
 It's all high spirit you know you gotta hear it
 Don't touch the mic baby don't come near it
 It's gonna get you it's gonna get you
 It's gonna get you girl it's gonna get you
 Looking down the barrel of a gun
 Son of a gun son of a bitch
 Getting paid getting rich
 Ultra violence running through my head
 Fuzzy navel y'all making me see red
 Rapid fire Louie like Rambo got bullets
 I'm a gonna die harder like my kid Bruce Willis Drummond
 I love girlies waxing and milking
 Got more excuses than my man Dave Scilkin
 Predetermined destiny is who I am
 You got your finger on the trigger like the Son of Sam I am
 Like Clockwork Orange going off on the town
 I've got posse bonanza to beat your ass down
 I'm mad at my desk and I'm writing all curse words
 Expressing my aggressions through my schizophrenic verse words
 You're a headless chicken chasin' a sucker free basin
 Looking for a fist to put your face in
 Get hip don't slip knuckle heads
 Racism is schism on the serious tip


 "Clean"
 by Depeche Mode

 Clean
 The cleanest I've been
 An end to the tears
 And the in-between years
 And the troubles I've seen

 Now that I'm clean
 You know what I mean
 I've broken my fall
 Put an end to it all
 I've changed my routine
 Now I'm clean

 I don't understand
 What destiny's planned
 I'm starting to grasp
 What is in my own hands
 I don't claim to know
 Where my holiness goes
 I just know that I like
 What is starting to show

 Sometimes

 As years go by
 All the feelings inside
 Twist and they turn
 As they ride with the tide
 I don't advise
 And I don't criticise
 I just know what I like
 With my own eyes

 Sometimes

 Sometimes


 "Swallowed"
 by Bush

 Warm sun, feed me up and I'm leery loaded up
 Loathing for a change and I slip some boil away

 Swallowed followed, heavy about everything but my love
 Swallowed sorrowed, I'm with everyone and yet not 
 I'm with everyone and yet not, I'm with everyone and yet
 
 Just wanted to be myself
 Hey, you said that you would love to try some
 Hey, you said you would love to die some 
 In the middle of a worm on a fish hook 
 You're the wave, you're the wave, you're the wave
 
 Swallowed borrowed, heavy about everything but my love
 Swallowed hollowed, sharp about everyone but yourself
 Swallowed oh no, I'm with every one and yet not
 I'm with everyone and you're not, I'm with everyone and you're not
 I'm on everyone and yet
 
 Piss on self-esteem, forward, busted knee
 Sick head, blackened lungs and I'm a simple selfish son
 
 Swallowed followed, heavy about everything but my love
 Swallowed oh no, I'm with everyone and yet not
 I'm on everyone and yet not, I'm on everyone and yet not, 
 
 Got to get away from here, got to get away from here
 Got to get away from here, got to get away from here
 I miss the one that I love a lot, I miss the one that I love a lot
 I miss the one that I love a lot


 "NFB (Dallabnikufesin)"
 by Anthrax

 We fell in love at first sight
 I can't explain the feelings
 When I first saw you
 We were so so happy
 A life of love sweet honey child
 You'll always be mine
 But then I played the fool
 I never meant to hurt you
 Or sleep with all your friends
 We reconciled we found ourselves
 Our love was meant to be
 Oh baby can't you see

 Solo

 You left me standing in the mud
 Crying to myself
 A heart so full of pain
 But we fell in love again
 This time forever
 True love prevails over all
 She got hit by a truck


 "Wait"
 by K's Choice

 I hold it, I fold it
 I throw it on the floor
 I wrote it, but maybe I'm afraid
 That you'll be bored
 It's very real and true and sad
 And hopeful just like me
 It's one of those things I'll never tell
 I'll carve it in a tree

 I follow you, I watch you
 I thank god you're in my class
 I picture us in the schoolbus
 And we're holding each others' hand

 I need a plan for you to fall
 In love with me and then
 I'll make you marry me,
 I'll wait...

 I never wear my glasses when
 I know that you can see me
 You act as if I'm not around
 But deep down you must need me
 I draw you, every single
 Feature in my head
 I try to do my homework
 But I dream of you instead

 I need a plan for you to fall
 In love with me and then
 I'll make you marry me,
 I'll wait...

 I'll make you marry me
 I'll make you marry me
 I'll make you marry, marry me...
 I'll wait...


 "Two-Headed Boy Pt. Two"
 by Neutral Milk Hotel

 Daddy please hear this song that I sing
 In your heart there's a spark that just screams
 For a lover to bring a child to your chest that could lay as you sleep
 And love all you have left like your boy used to be
 Long ago wrapped in sheets warm and wet

 Blister please with those wings in your spine
 Love to be with a brother of mine
 How he'd love to find your tongue in his teeth
 In a struggle to find secret songs that you keep wrapped in boxes so tight
 Sounding only at night as you sleep

 Brother see we are one in the same
 And you left with your head filled with flames
 And you watched as your brains fell out through your teeth
 Push the pieces in place
 Make your smile sweet to see
 Don't you take this away
 I'm still wanting my face on your cheek

 And when we break we'll wait for our miracle
 God is a place where some holy spectacle lies
 And when we break we'll wait for our miracle
 God is a place you will wait for the rest of your life
 
 Two headed boy she is all you could need
 She will feed you tomatoes and radio wires
 And retire to sheets safe and clean
 But don't hate her when she gets up to leave

 "My Friend of Misery"
 by Metallica

 You just stood there screaming
 fearing no one was listening to you
 they say the empty can rattles the most
 the sound of your voice must soothe you
 hearing only what you want to hear
 and knowing only what you've heard
 you   you're smothered in tragedy
 you're out to save the world

 misery
 you insist that the weight of the world
 should be on your shoulders
 misery
 there's much more to life than what you see
 my friend of misery

 you still stood there screaming
 no one caring about these words you tell
 my friend before your voice is gone
 one man's fun is another's hell
 these times are sent to try men's souls
 but something's wrong with all you see
 you   you'll take it on all yourself
 remember, misery loves company

 misery
 you insist that the weight of the world
 should be on your shoulders
 misery
 there's much more to life than what you see
 my friend of misery

 you just stood there screaming
 my friend of misery


 "Drowned World/Substitute for Love"
 by Madonna

 I traded fame for love
 Without a second thought 
 It all became a silly game 
 Some things cannot be bought 
 Got exactly what I asked for 
 Wanted it so badly 
 Running, rushing back for more 
 I suffered fools so gladly 
 And now I find 
 I've changed my mind 

 Chorus

 The face of you
 My substitute for love 
 My substitute for love 
 Should I wait for you 
 My substitute for love 
 My substitute for love 

 I travelled round the world
 Looking for a home 
 I found myself in crowded rooms 
 Feeling so alone 
 Had so many lovers 
 Who settled for the thrill 
 Of basking in my spotlight 
 I never felt so happy 

 Chorus

 Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
 Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh 

 No famous places, far-off places
 Trinkets I can buy 
 No handsome stranger, heady danger 
 Drug that I can try 
 No ferris wheel, no heart to steal 
 No laughter in the dark 
 No one-night-stand, no far-off land 
 No fire that I can spark 

 Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

 Chorus

 And now I find
 I've changed my mind 
 This is my religion

 "Big Furry Green Monster"
 by Spiderbait

 Big furry green
 Monster unseen
 Climbs up the hill
 Then, down
 Eats all the cow
 Horse and the plough
 Looks at the treats
 Around
 Big furry green
 Monster quite mean
 Begins the day
 Alone
 Thinks in his mind
 There was a time
 When everything
 Was fine
 Now can you see
 No one but me
 To do the monster
 Things
 Ate all the trees
 Grass and the leaves
 And then he says
 "Why am I the only
 So sad and lonely,
 Once I adored you,
 Now I ignore you."
 Big furry green
 Monster quite clean
 Reaches the cliff
 Twilight
 Something inside
 Doesn't feel right
 Then all the fear
 Subsides
 Makes up his mind
 Now is the time
 To be-a-leaving
 Home
 Opens his wings
 Leaps with a spring
 And then he whispers
 "Why am I the only,
 So sad and lonely,
 Once I adored you,
 Now I ignore you.
 Why am I the only,
 So sad and lonely,
 Once I adored you,
 Now I ignore you."
 
 
 "Waiting For The Night"
 by Depeche Mode

 I'm waiting for the night to fall
 I know that it will save us all
 When everything's dark
 Keeps us from the stark reality

 I'm waiting for the night to fall
 When everything is bearable
 And there in the still
 All that you feel is tranquillity

 There is a star in the sky
 Guiding my way with its light
 And in the glow of the moon
 Know my deliverance will come soon

 I'm waiting for the night to fall
 I know that it will save us all
 When everything's dark
 Keeps us from the stark reality

 I'm waiting for the night to fall
 When everything is bearable
 And there in the still
 All that you feel is tranquillity

 There is a sound in the calm
 Someone is coming to harm
 I press my hands to my ears
 It's easier here just to forget fear
 And when I squinted
 The world seemed rose-tinted
 And angels appeared to descend
 To my surprise
 With half-closed eyes
 Things looked even better
 Than when they were open

 Been waiting for the night to fall
 I knew that it would save us all
 Now everything's dark
 Keeps us from the stark reality

 Been waiting for the night to fall
 Now everything is bearable
 And here in the still
 All that you feel is tranquility


 "Everything Under the Sun"
 by Extreme


 Part I: Rise 'N Shine

 Dawn wakes the silence,
 of a fainted lullaby
 Day breaks the eyelid,
 from a song sung in my eye 
 Night rests in peace,
 as the sun mourns the sky
 All's accounted for sheep,
 over a horizon's I 

 Rise, rise 'n shine
 A new day is coming
 Rise, rise in time
 For everything under the sun 

 And when you see,
 a south wind blow
 Forecasting, you will know,
 a hot day, will be on the way
 (Foolish one)
 You analyze,
 the earth and the sky
 I ask you why,
 You can't analyze the signs,
 of the present time 
 
 I had a dream,
 not unlike te one from old
 Of a man king,
 whose head was made of gold
 Stand castles of sand,
 weather sundials rise 'n fall
 Chasing wind through your hands,
 'til water runs dry the well 

 Dream, Daniel, dream
 For what's yet to come
 See, Daniel, see
 For everything under the sun 

 And in the West,
 a cloud appears
 For shadows of
 a coming shower near,
 Oh, so near
 (Hypocrites)
 You analyze,
 the earth and the sky
 I ask you why,
 you can't analyze the signs,
 of the present time 

 Vanity,
 Yes, all is vanity
 Vanity,
 Yes, all's futility 

 For one that dies,
 another's born
 Where laughter's heard,
 comforters mourn
 Theres a time for
 everything 

 A song for love,
 even abhor
 An olive branch,
 or winter's war
 There's a time for
 Everything, under the sun 


 Part II: Am I Ever Gonna Change

 I'm tired of being me,
 and I don't like what I see,
 I'm not who I appear to be
 So I start off every day,
 down on my knees I will pray,
 for a change in any way
 But as the day goes by,
 I live through another lie,
 if it's any wonder why 

 Am I ever gonna change
 Will I always stay the same
 If I say one thing,
 Then I do the other
 It's the same old song,
 That goes on forever

 Am I ever gonna change
 I'm the only one to blame
 When I think I'm right,
 I wind up wrong
 It's a futile fight,
 Gone on too long 

 Please tell me if it's true,
 am I too old to start anew,
 cause that's what I want to do
 But time and time again,
 when I think I can,
 I fall short in the end
 So why do I even try,
 Will it matter when I die,
 Can anyone hear my cry? 

 Am I ever gonna change
 Take it day by day
 My will is weak
 And my flesh too strong
 This peace I seek
 Till thy kingdom comes 


 Part III: Who Cares?

 Tell me, Jesus,
 are you angry?
 One more sheep has,
 just gone astray
 A hardening of hearts,
 turning to stone
 Wandering off,
 so far from home
 So many children,
 losing time
 Walk in darkness,
 looking for a sign
 Chasing their rainbows,
 the future looks bright
 Slowly we're losing,
 Sight of the light 

 Who cares?
 Who cares?
 Who cares?
 Tell me who cares?
 Who cares? 

 All alone,
 out in the cold
 Can't look back,
 am I growing old
 I chose a path,
 is this my fate
 Am I finding out,
 the truth too late 

 Who cares?
 Who cares?
 Who cares?
 Tell me who cares?
 Who cares? 

 Here I am,
 a naked man
 Nothing to hide
 with empty hands
 Remember me,
 I am the one
 Who lost his way,
 your Prodigal Son 

 Who cares?
 Who cares?
 Who cares?
 Tell me who cares?
 Who cares? 

 Am I ever gonna change
 Will I always stay the same
 Say one thing
 Then do the other
 Same old song
 Goes on forever

 Rise, rise 'n shine
 A new day is coming
 Yes it is! 


 "Symphony of Destruction"
 by Megadeth

 You take a mortal man,
 And put him in control
 Watch him become a god,
 Watch peoples heads a'roll
 A'roll...

 Chorus
 Just like the Pied Piper
 Led rats through the streets
 We dance like marionettes,
 Swaying to the Symphony...
 Of Destruction

 Acting like a robot,
 Its metal brain corrodes.
 You try to take its pulse,
 Before the head explodes.
 Explodes...

 Chorus

 The earth starts to rumble
 World powers fall
 A'warring for the heavens,
 A peaceful man stands tall
 Tall...

 Chorus


 "Learning to Fly"
 by Pink Floyd

 Into the distance, a ribbon of black
 Stretched to the point of no turning back
 A flight of fancy on a windswept field
 Standing alone my senses reeled
 A fatal attraction holding me fast, how
 Can I escape this irresistible grasp?
 
 Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
 Tongue-tied and twisted Just an earth-bound misfit, I
 
 Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
 Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
 No navigator to guide my way home
 Unladened, empty and turned to stone
 
 A soul in tension that's learning to fly
 Condition grounded but determined to try
 Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
 Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I
 Friction lock - set. 
 Mixture - rich 
 Propellers - fully forward 
 Flaps - set - 10 degrees 
 Engine gauges and suction - check 
 
 Mixture set to maximum percent - recheck
 Flight instruments...
 Altimeters - check both
 (garbled word) - on
 Navigation lights - on
 Strobes - on
 (to tower): Confirm 3-8-Echo ready for departure
 (tower): Hello again, this is now 129.4
 (to tower): 129.4. It's to go.
 (tower): You may commence your takeoff, winds over 10 knots.
 (to tower): 3-8-Echo
 Easy on the brakes. Take it easy. Its gonna roll this time.
 Just hand the power gradually, and it... 

 Above the planet on a wing and a prayer,
 My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air,
 Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
 Out of the corner of my watering eye
 A dream unthreatened by the morning light
 Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

 There's no sensation to compare with this
 Suspended animation, A state of bliss
 Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
 Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I


 "Every Rose Has Its Thorn"
 by Poison

 We both lie silently still
 in the dead of the night
 Although we both lie close together
 We feel miles apart inside

 Was it something I said or something I did
 Did the words not come out right
 Though I tried not to hurt you
 Though I tried
 But I guess that's why they say

 Chorus:
 Every rose has its thorn
 Just like every night has its dawn
 Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
 Every rose has its thorn

 Yeah it does

 I listen to our favorite song
 playing on the radio
 Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and
 easy go
 But I wonder does he know
 Has he ever felt like this
 And I know that you'd be here somehow
 If I could have let you know somehow
 I guess

 Chorus

 Though it's been a while now
 I can still feel so much pain
 Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
 but the scar, that scar remains

 Solo

 I know I could have saved a love that night
 If I'd known what to say
 Instead of makin' love
 We both made our separate ways

 But now I hear you found somebody new
 and that I never meant that much to you
 To hear that tears me up inside
 And to see you cuts me like a knife
 I guess

 Chorus

 
 "West of Hollywood"
 by Steely Dan

 Brother in tears
 Look at this chain of sorrows
 Stretching all the way from here and now to hell and gone
 I was Kid Clean
 She was Anne de Siecle
 Just a thrill away from punching through to the cosmic wow
 It started out good
 Then it got lots better
 Makin' up the rules as we went along
 But with a business like this
 There's a gnarly downside
 
 I'm way deep into nothing special
 Riding the crest of a wave breaking just west of Hollywood
 
 Swingin' so hard
 We burned right through the summer
 Till the axis of pain/pleasure sheared the arc of desire
 From the Rebus affair
 To the streets of Culver City
 Places and events slip below the horizon line
 Now at this time
 Into our pretty story
 The truth compels us
 To bring a certain name
 Meet if you will
 Doctor Warren Kruger
 
 I'm way deep into nothing special
 Riding the crest of a wave breaking just west of Hollywood
 
 She reached out for my hand
 While I watched myself lurch across the room
 And I almost got there
 Look in my eyes
 Can't you see the core is frozen?
 You can't ask me to access the dreams I don't have now
 Sadly for us
 Our little talk is over
 So together we'll endure the tyranny of the disallowed
 Don't you love Port Blanc
 When Hooterie is over
 When the girls get easy and the crowds are gone
 A weekend of bliss
 Then the rainy season


 "Hyper-ballad"
 by Bjork

 We live on a mountain
 Right at the top
 There's a beautiful view
 From the top of the mountain
 Every morning I walk towards the edge
 And throw little things off
 Like car-parts, bottles and cutlery
 Or whatever I find lying around
 It's become a habit
 A way to start the day

 I go through all this
 Before you wake up
 So I can feel happier
 To be safe up here with you
 I go through all this
 Before you wake up
 So I can feel happier
 To be safe up here with you

 It's real early morning
 No-one is awake
 I'm back at my cliff
 Still throwing things off
 I listen to the sounds they make
 On their way down
 I follow with my eyes 'til they crash
 Imagine what my body would sound like
 Slamming against those rocks
 When it lands
 Will my eyes
 Be closed or open?

 I go through all this
 Before you wake up
 So I can feel happier
 To be safe up here with you
 I go through all this
 Before you wake up
 So I can feel happier
 To be safe up here with you
 I go through all this
 Before you wake up
 So I can feel happier
 To be safe up here with you
 Safe up ( here with you ) ...


 "About a Girl"
 by Nirvana

 I need an easy friend
 I do... with an ear to lend
 I do... think you fit this shoe
 I do... but you have a clue

 I'll take advantage while
 You hang me out to dry
 But I can't see you every night (for) free

 I'm standing in your line
 I do... hope you have the time
 I do... pick a number too (to or two)
 I do... keep a date with you


 "Another Brick in the Head"
 by Spiderbait

 Come on baby
 We're gonna have a good time
 You'll show me yours
 I'll show you mine

 Come along down
 I'm not (something) as a man
 I'll show you why
 I'm a big tough man!

 Big tough man!
 
 Come on baby
 You're gonna lock down
 All of them said
 You are the whore of town

 Come in the back
 Sit on my lap
 If you don't suck my cock
 I'm gonna beat your head with a big piece of rock!

 Beat you with this rock!
 
 Too bad baby
 You bit too late
 Now I'm going back
 To tell all my mates
 
 How I cut you open
 Until you're dead
 I'm so glad
 I smashed your head!
 
 
 "Jesse James Symphony"
 by Prefab Sprout

 jesse james is running and he'll never be at rest
 til the day they fold his arms across his chest
 he's a long way from the cradle
 and his ma's authority
 but it only seems a minute
 since she stood over his bed
 and she tried to tell him something
 now what the hell was it she said?
 
 jesse james is thinking of the breaks he never had
 and the gene that cursed his blood group rhesus-bad
 jesse james lived money
 his account was in the black
 til the day he stopped a bullet with his back
 well the zip code may read Vegas
 but the heart beats Tupelo
 and a footstep is such a small thing
 that it's neither here nor there
 til you string those steps together
 and find home is way back, way back where?
 
 jesse james was never
 part of life's great symphony
 all he heard were penny whistles out of key
 jesse james he promised
 "i will never die afraid"
 that boy perjured every vow he ever made
 

 "Junkie Man"
 by Rancid

 The common man doesn't suffer pain like this
 Only the soul that has never been kissed
 Let us adore our beautiful son
 He's ridin' on the river of Babylon
 Bootin' up, shootin' up, bring on the brightness
 See the son of God is comin' up and I see a likeness
 Internalize the lunacy of the misery is showin'
 When you're brought up you're caught up in a system that's goin'

 No one answers, no one takes that call from you
 No one answers, no one takes that call from you
 No one answers, no one takes that call from you, you, you
 
 Junkie man tell me what your story is
 Junkie man tell me what your story is
 Junkie man tell me what your story is
 Junkie man tell me what your story is
 
 Water, water, water, water I desire
 Some parent's house is on fire
 Slowly the house gonna burn to the ground
 The neighborhood will watch, bridge outta town
 Will someone be a witness, please tell me that he's crazy
 But he's not and they know that
 And they can't get him 'cause he's not crazy
 Beat him, lock him, knock him, take away his authority
 Hit 'em, ship 'em, club 'em, submitted conformity

 No one answers, no one takes that call from you
 No one answers, no one takes that call from you
 No one answers, no one takes that call from you, you, you
 
 Junkie man tell me what your story is
 Junkie man tell me what your story is
 Junkie man tell me what your story is
 Junkie man tell me what your story is
 
 My hand went blind, clairvoyant
 My hand went blind
 I make love to my trance sister
 My trance sister went on
 And my trance parents see from the balcony
 I looked out on the big field
 The big field, it opens like the cover of an old bible
 And out come the wolves
 Out come the wolves
 Their paws trampling the snow, the alphabet
 I stand on my head and watch it all go away
 
 Bootin' up, shootin' up, bring on the brightness
 See the son of God is coming up and I see a likeness
 Internalize the lunacy the misery is showin'
 When you're brought up and caught up in a system that is goin'
 
 No one answers, no one takes that call from you
 No one answers, no one takes that call from you
 No one answers, no one takes that call from you, you, you
 
 Junkie man tell me what your story is
 Junkie man tell me what your story is
 Junkie man tell me what your story is
 Junkie man tell me what your story is

 "Pull Me Under"

    Lost in the sky
    Clouds roll by and I roll with them
    Arrows fly
    Seas increase and then fall again

    This world is spinning around me
    This world is spinning without me
    Every day sends future to past
    Every breath leaves one less to my last

    Watch the sparrow falling
    Gives new meaning to it all
    If not today nor yet tomorrow then some other day

    I'll take seven lives for one
    And then my only father's son
    As sure as I ever did love him
    I am not afraid

    This world is spinning around me
    The whole world keeps spinning around me
    All life is future to past
    Every breath leaves me one less to my last

    Pull me under  Pull me under
    Pull me under  I'm not afraid
    All that I feel is honor and spite
    All I can do is to set it right

    Dust fills my eyes
    Clouds roll by and I roll with them
    Centuries cry
    Orders fly and I fall again

    This world is spinning inside me
    The whole world is spinning inside of me
    Every day sends future to past
    Every step brings me closer to my last

    Pull me under  Pull me under
    Pull me under  I'm not afraid
    Living my life too much in the sun
    Only until your will is done

   'Oh that this too 
    too solid flesh would melt.'           [Quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet,]
                                           [also sometimes seen in various  ]
                                           [versions as 'too sullied flesh'.]
 "Another Day"

     Live another day
     Climb a little higher
     Find another reason to stay
     Ashes in your hands
     Mercy in your eyes
     If you're searching for a silent sky...

       You won't find it here
       Look another way
       You won't find it here
       So die another day

     The coldness of his words
     The message in his silence,
     'Face the candle to the wind...'
     This distance in my voice
     Isn't leaving you a choice
     So if you're looking for a time to run away...

       You won't find it here
       Look another way
       You won't find it here
       So try another day

     They took pictures of our dreams
     Ran to hide behind the stairs
     And said maybe when it's right for you, they'll fall
     But if they don't come down
     Resist the need to pull them in
     And throw them away
     Better to save the mystery
     Than surrender to the secret

       You won't find it here
       Look another way
       You won't find it here
       So try another day

  
 "Take The Time"

   "Hold it now... 
    wait a minute... 
    come on... whew..."                                    [Samples from ???]                 ]

    Just let me catch my breath...
    I've heard the promises
    I've seen the mistakes
    I've had my fair share of tough breaks
    I need a new voice, a new law, a new way
    Take the time, reevaluate
    It's time to pick up the pieces,
    Go back to square one
    I think it's time for a change

    There is something that I feel
    To be something that is real
    I feel the heat within my mind
    And craft new changes with my eyes
    Giving freely wandering promises
    A place with decisions I'll fashion
    I won't waste another breath

    [Chorus:]
      You can feel the waves coming on
      (It's time to take the time)
      Let them destroy you or carry you on
      (It's time to take the time)
      You're fighting the weight of the world
      But no one can save you this time
      Close your eyes
      You can find all you need in your mind

    The unbroken spirit
    Obscured and disquiet
    Finds clearness this trial demands
    And at the end of this day sighs an anxious relief
    For the fortune lies still in his hands

    If there's a pensive fear, a wasted year
    A man must learn to cope
    If his obsession's real,
    Suppression that he feels must turn to hope

    Life is no more assuring than love
    (It's time to take the time)
    There are no answers from voices above
    (It's time to take the time)
    You're fighting the weight of the world
    And no one can save you this time
    Close your eyes
    You can find all that you need in your mind

    I close my eyes
    And feel the water rise around me
    Drown in the beat of time
    Let my senses fall away
    I can see much clearer now, I'm blind

   "Adesso che ho perso la vista,    [Sample from the Italian film "Cinema  ]
    ci vedo meglio e di piu."        [Paradiso", which means "Now that I'm  ]
                                     [blind, I can see much clearer."       ]
    [Chorus]                         [This text was taken from the video for]
                                     [Take The Time, and is incorrect. It   ]                        
    Find all you need in your mind   [should be "Ora che ho perso la vista, ]
    If you take the time             [ci vedo di piu.", which means "Now    ]
    Find all you need in your mind   [that I have lost my sight, I can see  ]
    If you take the time             [clearer."                             ]

  
 "Surrounded"

    Morning comes too early and nighttime falls too late
    And sometimes all I want to do is wait
    The shadow I've been hiding in has fled from me today

    I know it's easier to walk away than look it in the eye
    But I will raise a shelter to the sky
      and here beneath this
      star tonight I'll lie
    She will slowly yield the light
    As I awaken from the longest night

    Dreams are shaking
    Set sirens waking up tired eyes
    With the light the memories all rush into his head

    By a candle stands a mirror
    Of his heart and soul she dances
    She was dancing through the night above his bed

    And walking to the window
      he throws the shutters out
      against the wall
    And from an ivory tower hears her call
    'Let light surround you'

    It's been a long, long time
    He's had awhile to think it over
    In the end he only sees the change
    Light to dark
    Dark to light
    Light to dark
    Dark to light

    Heaven must be more than this
    When angels waken with a kiss
    Sacred hearts won't take the pain
    But mine will never be the same

    He stands before the window
    His shadow slowly fading from the wall
    And from an ivory tower hears her call
    'Let the light surround you'

    Once lost but I was found
    When I heard the stained glass shatter all around me
    I sent the spirits tumbling down the hill
    But I will hold this one on high above me still
    She whispers words to clear my mind
    I once could see but now at last I'm blind

    I know it's easier to walk away than look it in the eye
    But I had given all than I could take
    And now I've only habits left to break
    Tonight I'll still be lying here
    Surrounded in all the light

  
 "Metropolis - Part I 'The Miracle and the Sleeper'"

    The smile of dawn
    Arrived early May
    She carried a gift from her home
    The night shed a tear
    To tell her of fear
    And of sorrow and pain
    She'll never outgrow

    Death is the first dance, eternal

    There's no more freedom
    The both of you will be confined to this mind

    I was told there's a miracle for each day that I try
    I was told there's a new love that's born for each one that has died
    I was told there'd be no one to call on when I feel alone and afraid
    I was told if you dream of the next world
    You'll find yourself swimming in a lake of fire

    As a child, I thought I could live without pain without sorrow
    But as a man I've found it's all caught up with me
    I'm asleep yet I'm so afraid

    Somewhere like a scene from a memory
    There's a picture worth a thousand words
    Eluding stares from faces before me
    It hides away and will never be heard of again

    Deceit is the second without end

    The city's cold blood teaches us to survive
    Just keep my heart in your eyes and we'll stay alive

    The third arrives...

    Before the leaves have fallen
    Before we lock the doors
    There must be a third and last dance
    This one will last forever
    Metropolis watches and thoughtfully smiles
    She's taken you to your home

    It can only take place
    When the struggle between our children has ended
    Now the Miracle and the Sleeper know that the third is love

    Love is the Dance of Eternity

  
 "Under A Glass Moon" 

    Tell me
    Remind me
    Chase the water racing from the sky
    Always beside me
    Taste the memories running from my eyes
    Nervous flashlights scan my dreams
    Liquid shadows silence their screams
    I smile at the moon
    Chasing water from the sky
    I argue with the clouds
    Stealing beauty from my eyes

    [Chorus:]
      Outside the soundness of your mind
      Bathing your soul in silver tears
      Beneath a blackened summer sky
      Praying for time to disappear

    Beneath a summer sky
    Under glass moonlight
    Night awaits the lamb's arrival
    Liquid shadows crawl
    Silver teardrops fall
    The bride subsides to her survival

    By your hand
    I've awakened
    Bear this honor in my name

    [Chorus]

  
 "Wait For Sleep"

    Standing by the window
    Eyes upon the moon
    Hoping that the memory will leave her spirit soon
    She shuts the doors and lights
    And lays her body on the bed
    Where images and words are running deep
    She has too much pride to pull the sheets above her head
    So quietly she lays and waits for sleep

    She stares at the ceiling
    And tries not to think
    And pictures the chain
    She's been trying to link again
    But the feeling is gone

    And water can't cover her memory
    And ashes can't answer her pain
    God give me the power to take breath from a breeze
    And call life from a cold metal frame

    In with the ashes
    Or up with the smoke from the fire
    With wings up in heaven
    Or here, lying in bed
    Palm of her hand to my head
    Now and forever curled in my heart
    And the heart of the world

  
 "Learning To Live" 

    There was no time for pain
    No energy for anger
    The sightlessness of hatred slips away
    Walking through winter streets alone
    He stops and takes a breath
    With confidence and self control

    I look at the world and see no understanding
    I'm waiting to find some sense of strength
    I'm begging you from the bottom of my heart to show me understanding

    I need to live life
    Like some people never will
    So find me kindness
    Find me beauty
    Find me truth
    When temptation brings me to my knees
    And I lay here drained of strength
    Show me kindness
    Show me beauty
    Show me truth

    The ways that your heart sounds makes all the difference
    It's what decides if you'll endure the pain that we all feel
    The way that your heart beats makes all the difference
    In learning to live
    Here before me is my soul
    I'm learning to live
    I won't give up
    Till I've no more to give

    Listening to the city
    Whispering its violence
    I set out watching from above
    The 90's bring new questions
    New solutions to be found
    I fell in love to be let down

    Once again we dance in the crowd
    At times a step away
    From a common fear that's all spread out
    It won't listen to what you say
    Once you're touched and you stand alone
    To face the bitter fight
    Once I reached for love
    And now I reach for life

    Another chance to lift my life
    Free the sensation in my heart
    To ride the wings of dreams into changing horizons
    It brings inner peace within my mind,
    As I'm lifted from where I've split my life
    I hear an innocent voice
    I hear kindness, beauty and truth

    The way your heart sounds makes all the difference
    It's what decides if you'll endure the pain that we all feel
    The way your heart beats makes all the difference
    In learning to live
    Spread before you is your soul
    So forever hold the dreams within our hearts
    Through nature's inflexible grace
    I'm learning to live


 "World In My Eyes"
 by Depeche Mode

 Let me take you on a trip
 Around the world and back
 And you won't have to move
 You just sit still
 Now let your mind do the walking
 And let my body do the talking
 Let me show you the world in my eyes

 I'll take you to the highest mountain
 To the depths of the deepest sea
 We won't need a map, believe me
 Now let my body do the moving
 And let my hands do the soothing
 Let me show you the world in my eyes

 That's all there is
 Nothing more than you can feel now
 That's all there is

 Let me put you on a ship
 On a long, long trip
 Your lips close to my lips
 All the islands in the ocean
 All the heaven's in the motion
 Let me show you the world in my eyes

 That's all there is
 Nothing more than you can touch now
 That's all there is

 Let me show you the world in my eyes


 "My Tears Are Fallin'"
 probably not by Collision, but that's the only version I know

 My tears are fallin'
 and I'm doin' time for being young
 My tears are fallin'
 but my life has just begun
 you see women in Cadillacs
 and the girls with their summer dresses high
 Be my December
 I'll be your sweet July
 My tears are fallin'
 My tears are fallin'
 My tears are fallin'
 Ooooh

 My deepest lines of worry
 I've crossed one thousand times
 My tears are no valley babe,
 Each one much harder to climb than the
 one before I guess
 I knew I had to go
 'Cuz you're so far away
 and I needed to hold you close
 you see women in Cadillacs
 and the girls with their summer dresses high
 Be my December
 I'll be your sweet July
 My tears are fallin'
 My tears are fallin'
 My tears are fallin'
 My tears are fallin'
 uh... my tears are fallin'
 Oh oh ohhhhh...

 "Harvey the Wonder Hamster"

 Oh, Harvey, Harvey
 Harvey the Wonder Hamster
 He doesn't bite and he doesn't squeal
 He just runs around on his hamster wheel

 Hey, Harvey!


 "Billy the Mountain"
 by Frank Zappa
 
 Billy the Mountain
 Billy the Mountain
 A regular picturesque
 Postcardy mountain
 Residing between lovely
 Rosamond and Gorman
 With his stunning wife Ethell
 A tree
 A tree
 
 Billy was a mountain
 Ethell was a tree growing off of his shoulder
 Billy was a mountain
 (Billy was a mountain)
 Ethell was a tree growing off of his shoulder
 (Ethell was a tree growing off of his shoulder)
 He-he-hey!
 Billy had two big caves for eyes
 With a cliff for a jaw that would go up and down
 And whenever it did he'd puff out some dust
 And hack up a boulder
 Hack!
 Hack up a boulder
 Hack, hack!
 Hack up a boulder
 Hack, hack!
 Hack up a boulder
 
 Now one day, now I believe it was on a Tuesday, a man in a checkered 
 double-knit suit drove up in a large Eldorado Cadillac leased from Bob 
     Spreen
 (Where the freeways meet in Downey!")
 And he laid a huge bulging envelope right at the corner of Billy the 
 Mountain, that was right where his foot was supposed to be. Now, Billy the 
 Mountain, he couldn't believe it! All those postcards he'd posed for for all 
     those years, and finally, now, at last, his royalties!
 Royalties!
 Royalties check is in, honey...!
 Royalties!
 Royalties!
 Yes! Billy the Mountain was rich! Yes... and his eyeballs caves they widened 
     in amazement, and his jaw which was a cliff, well it... it dropped
     thirty feet!
 A bunch of dust puffed out
 Rocks and boulders hacked up!
 Hack, hack, hack!
 Crushing the Lincoln!
 
 I gave him the money
 He acted real funny
 He hacked up a rock and
 It totalled my car
 Oh do you
 Know any trucks might
 Be bound for the valley
 I don't wanna stand here
 All night in this bar
 Dear Lord I
 Don't wanna stand here
 All night in this bar
 No shit I
 Don't wanna stand here
 All night in this bar
 
 By two o'clock, when the bars had already closed down, Billy had broken the 
     big news to Ethell
 Ta-da!
 And with dust and boulders everywhere
 Billy, choked with excitement
 AAWW!
 Announced:
 ETHELL, WE'RE GOING ON A VACATION
 Yes! And they were going an a vacation... oh, and Ethell, Ethell, Ethell, 
     like any little woman, she of course was very excited
 Ha ha ah ah ah ha ha ah ha ha!
 She creaked a little bit and some old birds flew off of her
 Billy told Ethell they were going to...
 Yes! They were going to New York!
 ETHELL, WE'RE GOING TO...
 TU-TU-TU-TU-TU
 NEW YORK
 But first they were gonna stop in Las Vegas!
 
 It's off to Las Vegas
 To check out the lounges
 Pull a few handles
 And drink a few beers
 Oh Ethell
 Ethell, my darling
 You know that I love you
 I'm glad we could have a
 Vacation this year
 Oh neet-o
 Glad we could have a
 Vacation this year
 
 They left that night, crunching across the Mojave desert, their voices 
     echoing through the canyons of your mind...
 (Poo-ah!)
 ETHELL, WANNA GET A CUPPA CAWFEE?
 (Howard Johnson's, Howard Johnson's, Howard Johnson's)
 OH, THERE'S A HOWARD JOHNSON'S... WANNA EAT SOME CLAMS?
 
 The first noteworthty piece of real estate they destroyed was Edwards Air 
     Force Base

 And to this very day, wing-nuts and data reduction clerks alike speak in 
     reverent whispers about that fateful night when Test Stand Number One
     and the rocket sled itself got...
 (We got a mission...)
 LUNCHED!
 I said LUNCHED!
 By a famous mountain-in
 Ha-dee-a-dee-a-da!
 And his small wooden wife
 Ha-dee-da-dee-da-da-dee-da-dee-da-da-da
 
 Word just in to the KTTV news service... Undeniably links this mountain and 
     his wife to drug abuse and pay-offs as part as the San Joaquin Valley
     smut ring... However we can assure parents in the Southern California
     area that a recent narcotics crack-down in Torrance... Hawthorne...
     Lomita... Westchester... Playa del Rey... Santa Monica... Tujunga...
     Sunland... San Fernando... Pacoima... Sylmar... Newhall... Canoga
     Park... Palmdale... Glendale... Irwindale... Rolling Hills... Granada
     Hills... Shadow Hills... Cheviot Hills... will provide the secret
     evidence the Palmdale Grand Jury has needed to seek a criminal
     indictement... and pave the way for stiffer legislation... increased
     federal aid... and avert a crippling strike of bartenders and
     veterinarians... throughout the inland empire...

 Within a week Jerry Lewis had hosted a telethon
 (La la la nice lady)
 To raise funds  for the injured
 Injured
 And homeless
 Homeless
 In Glendale

 (As Billy had just levelled it)
 And a few miles right outside of town, Billy caused a 'Oh Mein Papa' in the 
     earth's crust
 Right over the secret underground dumps, right near the Jack-In-The-Box on 
     Glenoaks, where they keep the
 Pools of old poison gas
 And obsolete germ bombs
 Just as a freak tornado cruised through...
 Yes, it was about three o'clock in the afternoon when little Howard Kaplan 
     was sitting on his porch...
 Toto!
 Just playing...
 Come here, Toto!
 Having a nice time with his little accordion...
 Toto!
 And this weird wind came up...
 Toto!
 Direct from Glendale...
 Toto!
 Blowing these terrible germs in his direction...
 Toto! Come here, Toto!
 And all of this caused by a huge mountain
 (Aunty Em!)
 Somewhere over the rainbow
 Blue birds fly
 Sucking up two thirds of it
 (Suck, suck, suck)
 For an untimely dispersal over vast stretches of...
 WATTS!
 
 Now, unless I misunderstood, it was right outside of Columbus, Ohio, when 
     Billy received his notice to report for his induction physical, now, let
     me tell you, Ethell said, now Ethell, Ethell said, she wasn't gonna let
     him go
 I'm not gonna let you go, Billy!
 That's right
 
 We now have confirmed reports from an informed Orange County minister that 
     Ethell is still an active communist... and it is This Reporter's Opinion 
     that she also practises...
 Coven
 Witchcraft!
 
 It was about this time that the telephone rang inside of the secret 
     briefcase belonging to the one mortal man who might be able to stop all
     of this senseless destruction and save America herself... and I'm sorry
     to disappoint some of you, it was not Chief Redden... this one man was 
     Studebacher Hoch... fantastic new super hero, of the current economic
     slump

 Now some folks say he looked like
 (He looks like)
 Zubin Mehta
 (Zubin Mehta)
 Still others say...
 (Others say...)
 Bullshit, honey
 (Bullshit, man...)
 He was just another greasy guy
 (Frozen beef pies)
 Who happened to be born next to the frozen beef pies of Boney's Market
 (Others say he was just a)
 Still others say
 Pshaw, piss on you, Jack
 (Crazy Italian)
 He's just a crazy Italian who drove a red car
 You see?
 (Nobody knows for sure 'cause he was so)
 Nobody ever really knew for sure
 Because Studebacher was so
 Mysterious
 (Mysterious)
 He was so
 (He was so, he was so)
 Mysterious
 He was so
 (He was so, he was so)
 Mysterious
 
 'Cause when a person gets to be
 Such a hero, folks
 And marvelous beyond compute
 You can never really tell about a guy like that
 Wether he's really a nice person
 Or if he just smiles a lot
 Or if he has a son named Pinocchio
 Or what
 Wether he's really a nice person or if he has a son named Pinocchio or what
 Some men say he could fly
 Some men say he could swim
 Others say he could sing like Neil Sedaka
 And all the girls in Flushing would be amazed of him
 Two... three...
 Amazed of him
 (Amazed!)
 Time passes...

 So when the phone rang
 In the secret briefcase
 A strong masculine hand
 With a Dudley Do-Right wrist watch
 And flexy bracelet
 Grabbed it
 And answered
 In a deep
 Calmly assured voice...
 
 So... uh... yeah, yeah... hello, already? What? What... yeah? Uh... are you 
     kidding? You're not kidding... A mountain! With a tree growing off of
     his shoulder? You're fulla shit, man! Uh... listen, by the way, before
     you go on... did you get those white albums I sent you with the pencil
     on the front? Yeah? Yeah, you should move some of those for me, we're
     having a lotta... listen... so kiss little Jakee on the head... and...
     uh... how's your wife's hemorrhoids? Oh, that's too bad... listen... so
     you've got a mountain... with a tree... listen, causing... oh, my...
     well, let me write this down... sort of... take a few notes here...
     Yeah? To El Segundo? Huh?
 Causing untold destruction?
 (My baby, my baby)
 Wanted for... draft evasion? Oh... an expense account? And per diem too?
 
 Some men say he could dance
 They said he could dance and of course they were right... ladies and 
     gentlemen, this is it, the Studebacher Hoch Dancing Lesson & Cosmic
     Prayer
 For Guidance, featuring Aynsley Dunbar... Hit it!

 Hey! Right hand from the heart-a
 Left hand from the heart-a
 Right hand from the heart-a
 Left hand from the left shoulder to the heart-a
 Fillmore... Fillmore... etc.
 Nobody can dance like Studebacher Hoch
 
 So many rumors have spread about Studebacher Hoch...
 (A rumor.... a rumor...)
 Consider this rumor...
 (A rumor...)
 Which was published about three weeks ago in Rolling Stone...
 (Oh, it's gotta be true!)
 Studebacher Hoch can write the Lord's Prayer on the head of a pin!
 (No!)
 
 Do-do-do,
 Doot-doot-do DO DO DO!
 etc.
 I'm so hip!
 Beef pies
 He was born next to the beef pies
 Underneath
 Joni Mitchell's autographed picture
 Right beside
 Elliot Robert's big bank book
 Next to the boat
 Where Crosby flushed away all his stash
 And the cops
 Got him in the boat and drove away
 To the can
 Where Neil Young slipped another disc
 
 Froze-ing by the pies
 Froze-ing by the pies
 Froze-ing by the pies
 
 And that was the main influence on him
 The influence of a frozen beef pie
 
 Boldly springing into action he phoned his wife...
 Who ran a modeling school whereupon he...
 Yes, he ran around the back of Broadway at Hollywood Boulevard and Vine to 
     see if he could find himself some big large un-used cardboard boxes...
 (No shit!)
 After which he hit up the Ralph's on Sunset for some Aunt Jemima syrup, some 
     Kaiser boiler foil and a pair of blunt scissors, he-hey!
 Yes, and in the parking lot of Ralph's...
 (Where no prices are lower prices than Ralph's...)
 In the parking lot of Ralph's, in between a pair of customized trucks, where 
     nobody was looking, he cut out some really, really, really, nice wings
     and he covered 'em thoroughly with foil...
 Thoroughly with foil...
 Then he took those wings and wedged one under each of his powerful arms... 
     and sneaked in to a telephone booth...
 Yeah!
 Yes... and then he shut the fucking door! And he pulled down his blue denim 
     policeman type trousser pants and he spread even amounts of Aunt Jemima 
     maple syrup all over the inside of his legs...
 Ah ha ha ha!
 Soon the booth was filling with flies
 Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me!
 He held open the legs of his boxer shorts so they could all get in...
 Yes!
 No!
 And when each and everyone of those little cocksucking flies had gone into 
     his pants and they were lapping up all that maple syrup... he bent over
     and he put his head between his legs and he said in a very clear,
     impressive Ron-Hubbard-type voice...
 New York
 And the booth and everything lifted up out of the parking lot and into the 
     sky!

 Studebacher Hoch, yeah, yeah
 Studebacher Hoch, Studebacher Hoch
 Studebacher Hoch, yeah, yeah
 Studebacher Hoch, Studebacher Hoch
 
 He's coating his legs
 With Aunt Jemima syrup
 Up and down
 His shorts'll be filled
 With flies that will be
 Buzzing all around
 
 Stoodlabaker Hoch
 He's really outa sight
 Stoodlabaker Hoch
 He does it every night
 Stoodlabaker Hoch
 He treats the flies alright
 Stoodlabaker Hoch
 That's why they never bite
 Hey!
 
 Please to New York
 Fly to New York
 He could be a dog
 Or a frog
 Or a lesbian queen
 Down to New York
 He could be a narc
 Or a lady marine
 
 Oh he might play dirty
 He's over thirty
 Getting old
 Say!
 I don't know
 His peculiar attire
 And the flies he requires
 Keep leading him on
 'Cause Ethell is gone
 They keep leading him on
 'Cause Ethell is gone
 And the mountain she's on
 
 And speaking of mountains we'll join Studebacher Hoch on the edge of Billy 
     the Mountain's mouth... take it away...

 Ah, yeah... yeah, yeah... hey... uh... Billy? Uh... listen, I've come to 
     reason with you, our great country needs you in the Armed Forces, your 
     number came up, you can't go on running like this forever...

 Oh! But Ethell just shook her twigs angrily, but Studebacher Hoch, calm, 
     cool, collected and un-ferturbed continued

 Yeah, well listen you... Cough, Cough...
 Listen you communist son of a bitch, you better get your ass down there for 
     your fucking physical, or I'll see to it that you get used for fill dirt
     in some impending New Jersey marsh reclamation, and your girlfriend
     there will wind up disguised as a series of brooms, primitive ironing
     boards, or a dog house, get the...
 Cough! Cough! Get the picture?

 Yeah, well, Billy just laughed
 HA HA HA! IF THEY THINK THEY'RE GONNA DRAFT ME, THEY'RE CRAZY
 
 Unfortunately because Studebacher Hoch was standing on the edge of Billy the 
     Mountain's mouth, when the giant mountain laughed, Studebacher Hoch lost
     his footing and fell screaming two hundred feet into the rubble below!

 Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
 Oh fuck, I'm gonna need a truss!
 
 Oh, listen, that only goes to show you... and I'll show you once again 
     that...

 A mountain is something
 You don't wanna fuck with
 You don't wanna fuck with
 Don't fuck around
 Don't fuck around!
 Don't fuck with Billy
 No!
 And don't fuck with Ethell
 You saw what just happened
 To the guy with the flies
 
 Don't fuck around
 Don't fuck around
 Don't fuck around
 Don't fuck around
 Don't fuck around
 Don't fuck around
 Don't fuck around
 With Biddilly
 Biddilly
 Biddilly
 Biddilly the Mountin-innnn!
 
 Eddie, are you kidding?
 
 Eddie, are you kidding...? Oh, I forgot to mention this is where we take our 
     intermission, we'll see you in a few minutes
 Thank you!
 We'll be back!


 "Song Against Sex"
 by Neutral Milk Hotel

 And the first one tore a picture
 Of a dead and hanging man
 Who was kissing foreign fishes
 That flew right out from this hands
 And when I put my arms around him
 I felt the blushing blood run through my cheeks
 And an eeriness surrounded when his tongue began to speak
 And he said...Oh boy you are so pretty
 Enough to wrap tight in rice-paper string...
 And when I finally kissed him the whole world began to ring
 Lost like a bell that's tipping over
 With two cracks along both sides
 And I knew the world was over so I took a look outside
 And watched the fires that were reaching
 Up to the weather vane and the tops of trees
 And the waiting scene and the sunday dream
 They're all waiting here for me
 
 Deli markets with their flower stands
 Pretty girls and the burning men
 Hanging out on the hooks next to the window displays
 And I took out my tongue twice removed from my face
 Across a bridge and across the mountains
 Threw a nickel in a fountain
 To save my soul from all these troubled times
 And all the drugs that I don't have the guts to take
 To soothe my mind so I'm always sober
 Always aching, always heading towards
 Mass suicide, occult figurines
 And wasted gas-station attendents
 Attending to their jobs
 And a nice drive in the country
 Finds a nice cliff to drop off
 Oh when this world just gets so grating
 All the grittiness of life
 But don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you
 You're too wonderful to die
 
 From anything we could call loving
 Any love worth living for
 So I'll sleep out in the gutter
 You can sleep here on the floor
 And when I wake up in the morning
 I forgot to lock the door
 Because with a match that's mean and some gasoline
 You won't see me anymore


 "Old Man Sam"
 by Spiderbait

 Johnny was a man
 Bad bad man
 Baddest man in all the land
 Badder he was
 Than Old Man Sam
 
 We're all here
 Drinking beer
 Drinking beer without a care
 Drinking beer
 Without a care!
 
 I saw Johnny Cash
 Saw Johnny Cash and he was smashed
 Johnny Cash, Johnny Cash
 He was smashed
 
 Elvis was big and fat
 Was big and fat, so how about that?
 Big and fat, so how about that?
 How about that?
 
 Rock and roll
 Rock and roll
 Rock and rock and rock and roll
 Rock and roll, Rock and roll
 
 Now it's time for us to go
 Time to go so don't be slow
 Don't be slow, time to go
 Time to go, rock and roll
 

 "New Year's Day"
 by U2

 Yeah...

 All is quiet on New Year's Day
 A world in white gets underway
 I want to be with you
 Be with you night and day
 Nothing changes on New Year's Day
 On New Year's Day

 I will be with you again
 I will be with you again

 Under a blood red sky
 A crowd has gathered in black and white
 Arms entwined, the chosen few
 The newspapers says, says 
 Say it's true it's true...

 And we can break through
 Though torn in two 
 We can be one

 I...I will begin again
 I...I will begin again

 Oh...
 Maybe the time is right
 Oh...maybe tonight...

 I will be with you again
 I will be with you again

 And so we're told this is the golden age
 And gold is the reason for the wars we wage
 Though I want to be with you
 Be with you night and day
 Nothing changes 
 On New Year's Day
 On New Year's Day


 "Sexy Sadie"
 by The Beatles

 Sexy Sadie what have you done
 You made a fool of everyone
 You made a fool of everyone
 Sexy Sadie ooh what have you done.

 Sexy Sadie you broke the rules
 You layed it down for all to see
 You layed it down for all to see
 Sexy Sadie oooh you broke the rules.

 One sunny day the world was waiting for a lover
 She came along to turn on everyone
 Sexy Sadie the greatest of them all.

 Sexy Sadie how did you know
 The world was waiting just for you
 The world was waiting just for you
 Sexy Sadie oooh how did you know.

 Sexy Sadie you'll get yours yet
 However big you think you are
 However big you think you are
 Sexy Sadie oooh you'll get yours yet.

 We gave her everything we owned just to sit at her table
 Just a smile would lighten everything
 Sexy Sadie she's the latest and the greatest of them all.

 She made a fool of everyone Sexy Sadie.
 However big you think you are Sexy Sadie.


 "Say It Ain't So"
 by Weezer

 Oh Yeah
 All Right

 Somebody's heine is crowding my icebox
 Somebody's cold one is giving me chills
 Guess I'll just close my eyes

 Oh yeah
 All right
 Feels good
 Inside

 Flip on the Tele...
 Wrestle with Jimmy
 Somethin' is bubblin' behind my butt
 The bottle is ready to go

 Say it ain't so a-woah-a-woah
 Your drug is a heartbreaker
 Say it ain't so a-woah-a-woah
 My love is a life-taker

 I can't confront you, I never could do...
 That which might hurt you
 Try and be cool, when I say:
 This way is-a-waterslide-away-from-you-that-takes-you-futher-everyday!
 Be cool

 Say it ain't so a-woah-a-woah
 Your drug is a heartbreaker
 Say it ain't so a-woah-a-woah
 My love is a life-taker!

 Dear daddy, I write you in spite of fears of silence
 You cleaned up, found Jesus,
 Things are good also I hear
 This bottle of Stevens awakens ancient feelings...
 Like father, Step-Father...
 The son is drowning in the flood!
 Yeah Yeah-Yeah Yeah-Yeah!

 Say it ain't so a-woah-a-woah
 You drug is a heartbreaker.
 Say it ain't so a-woah-a-woah.
 My love is a life-taker.


 "Big Long Now"
 by Nirvana

 It's not cold enough
 Please put this side up
 She is moving through
 Can we show our faces now?

 I'm not interesting
 She's not turning green
 Shameful as it seems
 Can we show our faces now?

 Endless climb
 I am blind
 Why can't I leave?
 Color blind
 Speaking a phrase
 Instantly grown
 I am blind
 Waiting in line

 Why am I sure?


 "Wasted Time"
 by Skid Row

 You and I together in our lives,
 Sacred ties would never fray
 Then why can I let myself tell lies
 And watch you die every day

 I think back to the times when dreams were what mattered
 Tough talking youth naivete
 You said you'd never let me down
 But the horse stampedes and rages in the name of desperation

 CHORUS
 Is it all just wasted time
 Can you look at yourself when you think of what you left behind
 Is it all just wasted time
 Can you live with yourself when you think of what you left behind

 Paranoid delusions they haunt you
 Where's my friend I used to know
 He's all alone.
 He's buried deep within a carcass searching for a soul

 Can you feel me inside your heart as it's bleeding
 Why can't you believe you can be loved
 I hear you scream in agony
 And the horse stampedes and rages in the name of desperation

 CHORUS

 You said you never let me down
 But the horse stampedes, it rages in the name of desperation

 CHORUS

 The sun will rise again
 The earth will turn to sand
 Creation's colors seem to fade to grey
 And you'll see the sickly hands of time will write your final rhyme
 And end a memory

 I never thought you'd let it get this far boy


 "Pearl of the Quarter"
 by Steely Dan

 On the water down in New Orleans
 My baby's the pearl of the quarter
 She's a charmer like you never seen
 Singing voulez voulez voulez vous
 Where the sailor spend his hard-earned pay
 Red beans and rice for a quarter
 You can see her almost any day
 singing voulez voulez voulez vous
 
 And if you hear from my Louise
 Won't you tell her I love her so
 Please make it clear
 When her day is done
 She got a place to go
 
 I walked alone down the miracle mile
 I met my baby by the shine of the martyr
 She stole my heart with her Cajun smile
 Singing voulez voulez voulez vous
 She loved the million dollar words I say
 She loved the candy and the flowers that I bought her
 She said she loved me and was on her way
 Singing voulez voulez voulez vous
 
 And if you hear from my Louise
 Won't you tell her I love her so
 Please make it clear
 When her day is done
 She got a place to go
 

 "For Martha"
 by The Smashing Pumpkins

 Whenever I run
 Wherever I run to you, lost one
 It's never done just hanging on
 The past has let me be
 Returning as if dream
 Shattered as belief

 If you have to go don't say goodbye
 If you have to go don't you cry
 If you have to go I will get by
 Someday I'll follow you
 And see you on the other side

 But for the grace of love
 I'd will the meaning of heaven from above
 (rpt)

 Your picture out of time left aching in my mind
 Shadows kept alive

 If you have to go, don't say goodbye
 If you have to go, don't you cry
 If you have to go I will get by
 I will follow you and see you on the other side

 But for the grace of love who'd will the meaning of heaven from above
 Long horses we are born
 Creatures more than torn
 Mourning our way home


 "Nothing Else Matters"
 by Metallica

 So close no matter how far
 couldn't be much more from the heart
 forever trusting who we are
 and nothing else matters

 never opened myself this way
 life is ours, we live it our way
 all these words I don't just say
 and nothing else matters

 trust I seek and I find in you
 every day for us something new
 open mind for a different view
 and nothing else matters

 never cared for what they do
 never cared for what they know
 but I know

 so close no matter how far
 couldn't be much more from the heart
 forever trusting who we are
 and nothing else matters

 never cared for what they do
 never cared for what they know
 but I know

 never opened myself this way
 life is ours, we live it our way
 all these words I don't just say

 trust I seek and I find in you
 every day for us something new
 open mind for a different view
 and nothing else matters

 never cared for what they say
 never cared for games they play
 never cared for what they do
 never cared for what they know
 and I know

 so close no matter how far
 couldn't be much more from the heart
 forever trusting who we are
 no nothing else matters


 "With or Without You"
 by U2

 See the stone set in your eyes
 See the thorn twist in your side
 I wait for you
 Sleight of hand and twist of fate
 On a bed of nails she makes me wait
 And I wait without you
 With or without you
 With or without you

 Through the storm we reach the shore
 You give it all but I want more
 And I'm waiting for you
 With or without you
 With or without you
 I can't live
 With or without you

 And you give yourself away
 And you give yourself away
 And you give
 And you give
 And you give yourself away

 My hands are tied
 My body bruised, she's got me with
 Nothing to win and
 Nothing left to lose

 And you give yourself away
 And you give yourself away
 And you give
 And you give
 And you give yourself away

 With or without you
 With or without you
 I can't live
 With or without you
 With or without you
 With or without you
 I can't live
 With or without you
 With or without you


 "Condemnation"
 by Depeche Mode

 Condemnation
 Tried
 Here on the stand
 With the book in my hand
 And truth on my side

 Accusations
 Lies
 Hand me my sentence
 I'll show no repentance
 I'll suffer with pride

 If for honesty
 You want apologies
 I don't sympathize
 If for kindness
 You substitute blindness
 Please open your eyes

 Condemnation
 Why
 Because my duty
 Was always to beauty
 And that was my crime

 Feel elation
 High
 To know I can trust this
 Fix of injustice
 Time after time

 If you see purity
 As immaturity
 Well it's no surprise
 If for kindness
 You substitute blindness
 Please open your eyes

 by Veruca Salt


 "Get Back"

 I'm spinning out, I can't control my car
 It doesn't matter who you think you might be you are
 I misplace it and I don't know where it's at,
 And I could find it but I'd never get it back...

 Don't get it back,
 Don't get it back
 The more you want it, the less you're gonna get back

 I'm running out, I don't know when to stop
 I thought I'd wait till I saw the penny drop
 It started raining, pennies falling in my lap
 And I could spend it, but I'd never get it back

 Don't get it back
 Don't get it back
 The more you want it, the less you're gonna get back

 Don't get it back
 Don't get it back
 The more you want it, the less you're gonna get it back. (x 3)

 I'm spinning out, I can't control my car


 "All Hail Me"

 Yeah
 So sorry, lady,
 So sorry now,
 I've killed your baby,
 I don't know how

 So sorry, so sorry now,
 So sorry, so sorry now

 You-so sorry mister. (oh-oh, oh-oh)
 But don't look now (oh-oh)
 I've got your sister (oh-oh)
 I shot her down

 So sorry, so sorry now,
 So sorry, so sorry now

 'Cos I'm a bad man, I do what I can
 I'm a bad man, I do what I can
 I'm a bad man, I do what I can

 All hail me

 So sorry mother
 I've let you down
 I'm soaked in blood here
 I can't get out

 So sorry, so sorry now (x 3)

 'Cos I'm a bad man, I do what I can
 I'm a bad man, I do what I can
 I'm a bad man, I do what I can

 All hail me

 Ha, ha, ha, all hail me

 (oh, I'm melting)
 (melt your baby)
 (that did not hurt so bad....)


 "Seether"

 Ow!

 Seether is neither loose nor tight,
 Seether is neither black nor white

 I tried to keep her on a short leash,
 I tried to calm her down
 I tried to ram her into the ground, yeah

 Can't fight the seether (x 3)
 I can't see her 'till I'm foaming at the mouth

 Seether is neither big nor small
 Seether is the center of it all

 I tried to rock her in my cradle,
 I tried to knock her out,
 I tried to cram her back in my mouth, yeah

 Can't fight the seether ( Seether ) (x 3)
 I can't see her 'till I'm foaming at the mouth

 Keep her down, boiling water,
 Keep her down, what a lovely daughter

 Oh, she is not born like other girls,
 But I know how to conceive her
 Oh, she may not look like other girls,
 But she's a snarl-toothed seether, seether!

 Can't fight the seether ( Seether ) (x 3)
 I can't see her 'till I'm foaming at the mouth

 Seether
 Can't fight the seether ( Seether ) (x 3)
 I can't see her 'till I'm foaming at the mouth
 Yeah


 "Spiderman '79"

 You're so nice, you tie me in a web,
 And cradle me 'till dawn
 You're so deadly that I can see your breath
 Beneath me when you're gone
 You're so windy, I'd like to pin you down
 And tack you to the wall,
 Spiderman,
 Spiderman

 Spider Sunday, you blaze up from the south
 With oil on your hands
 I'm streaked in grease and grime and idle mouths
 You've spoiled all my plans,
 Whoa, ho-oh Spiderman,
 Spiderman,
 Spiderman

 I can't take more of that (x 4)
 Whoa, ho-oh, Whoa, ho-oh. Whoa, ho-oh. Ho-oh. (x 3)

 Tiny truckstop, you lay me in a towel,
 And savor me like a lamb
 You smell of corduroy and lemon drops
 And reds pulled from a can
 I dream in black and white,
 I've long forgot exactly, who I am, am,
 A Spiderman,
 Spiderman,
 Spiderman

 Oh man,
 Spiderman
 Whoa, ho-oh, Whoa, ho-oh. Whoa, ho-ho. Ho-oh.
 Spiderman
 Whoa, ho-oh, Whoa, ho-oh. Whoa, ho-oh. Ho-oh.
 Spiderman
 Whoa, ho-oh, Whoa, ho-oh. Whoa, ho-oh. Ho-oh.
 Spiderman


 "Forsythia"

 Yellow baby,
 A yellow baby is a bad sign
 But I don't mind,
 I don't mind,
 Ohhh, Forsythia

 Spider monkey,
 A spider monkey is a good lie
 But I don't know why,
 Ohhh, Forsythia, oh-ohhh

 I don't mind sitting in the way way back
 I don't mind, lying to my friends

 One thing about Forsythia,
 She comes around and I get lost
 Against her yellow, I'm no longer me

 Yellow daisy, a dandelion or a pussy willow,
 It's a different thing
 Oh-oh, Forsythia.
 Forsythia.
 Forsythia

 One thing about Forsythia,
 She comes around and I get lost
 Against her yellow I'm no longer me

 One thing about Forsythia
 There's one thing about Forsythia


 "Wolf"

 That was a time for falling,
 I knew you well
 There was no time for calling,
 Me when you fell

 This is a time to take cover,
 In a wishing well
 Summer was blowing all over me when you fell,

 Sailors can take all the breathing
 Out of the sail,
 I took a trip when you needed me

 When you fell,
 Waters were driving me
 To a deep place
 I close my eyes to see,
 Your sweet face,
 A coke inside me,
 I slept in hell

 Angels can be so deceiving
 When they love you well,
 Did you think you would be leaving me?

 These are some lavender flowers
 In a broken shell
 They comfort me ever since the day when you fell

 When you fell,
 Waters were dancing me
 In a dark place,
 I close my eyes to see
 Your determined face,
 My secret inside me
 I slept in hell

 This is a time for believing
 In fairy tales,
 One in which you are brought back to me

 Wolf, I cried wolf
 Wolf, I cried wolf
 Wolf, I cried wolf


 "Celebrate You"

 I wear my patent leather shoes,
 And my golden fleeces,
 A feather in my hair for you,
 And then I fall to pieces
 At your celebration (oh-oh, oh-oh)
 Celebration (Oh-oh, Oh-oh) (x 2)
 Celebrate you

 We're quiet as two mannequins
 Feasting on silences
 We wait for Christmas to begin
 To see the cracking faces
 I tip my glass a toast to you,
 The blood spills on the carpet
 At your celebration (oh-oh, oh-oh)
 Celebration (Oh-oh, Oh-oh) (x 2)
 Celebrate you

 And in the dream you held a gun,
 You killed off all who hurt you,
 And left me there the only one
 Who would not dare desert you
 I'm safe here growing in the shade,
 Away from all the brightness
 I lost my innocence today
 When I learned how to write this

 Tonight my nightgown is in knots
 I toss and turn in your honor
 I'll never know just what I've got
 As long as you're my father

 And I'll keep searching here for you,
 I'll clean out every corner

 It's not my fault
 It's not my fault. (celebrate you) (x 3)
 It's not my fault


 "Fly"

 Twice bitten, twice baked
 Twice led down the same mistake
 Try me on a saturday, try me, try me

 Fine fool for a holiday
 Slow sun in a spanish way
 One heart for one week of may, why me?, why me?

 Twice given to yesterday
 Right for a foray with fate
 Fly me home to heaven's gate, fly me, fly me, fly

 Twice bitten, twice baked
 Twice led down the same mistake
 Try me on a saturday, try me, try me

 Try me, try me


 "Number One Blind"

 Be my blind
 Be it all the time
 Be it night or day,
 Take my sun away, away

 Levolor, which of us is blind?
 Levolor, left me in the dark
 Levolor, I can't see a thing but you,
 Is it morning?

 Blind me please,
 I am on my hands and knees
 I can only pray,
 Take my sun away, away

 Levolor, which of us is blind?
 Levolor, left me in the dark
 Levolor, I can't see a thing but you,
 Is it morning?

 It is time
 It is time (oh-oh)

 Levolor, which of us is blind?
 Levolor, left me in the dark
 Levolor, I can't see a thing but you,
 Is it morning?

 Levolor, which of us is blind?
 Levolor, left me in the dark
 Levolor, I can't see a thing but you,
 Is it morning?

 Levolor, Levolor, Levolor, Levolor...

 "Twinstar"

 Flying, when all I want to do is die
 Feels like your, flyin'
 Oh God, I wish that I could, fly

 You want to lift me up
 But you don't know, and you don't see,
 I'm stuck in my ways, stuck in my ways, oh

 Breathing, when all I want to do is drown
 You keep on breathing and I keep on sinking down, oh, oh

 You want to lift me up,
 But you don't know, and you don't see,
 I'm stuck in my ways, stuck in my ways
 I'm stuck in my ways, oh

 You want to lift me up,
 But you don't know, and you don't see,
 I'm stuck in my ways, stuck in my ways
 I'm stuck in my ways, I'm stuck in my ways, oh


 "25"

 I'm afraid I will never change,
 It's okay I'm not ashamed
 I can say that my bed is made

 You can bend me, shape me any way you can
 Bend me, shape me any way you want me

 I maintain, I am not in pain,
 How I try, not to place the blame
 I came late to an early game

 You can bend me, shape me any way (x 3)
 You can bend me, shape me any way you want me

 When I was five, I took a dive,
 When I was ten, I walked again
 When I was fifteen, I kept my motor clean
 When I was twenty, I got plenty
 When I was twenty-five
 When I was twenty-five


 "Sleeping Where I Want"

 This is my favorite disease,
 I am sleeping in his dreams
 And the TV is on,
 It is seeping into me,
 It is guiding my dreams,
 It is only three
 So it's jeopardy

 You can go and burst my tiny bubble
 Blow me off without a care
 But I am sleeping where I want to

 This is my favorite time
 I can sleep until the phone rings
 And I doubt that it will

 You can go and burst my tiny bubble
 Blow me off without a care
 But I am sleeping where I want to


 "The Way It Used To Be"
 by Dream Theater

 Feelin' sick once again
 I'd give anything
 To be back home
 Safe and warm inside

 I can't stand the crowds
 Or the smell that surrounds me
 The cloth and key
 Still preach chastity

 Take me back so I can see
 The way it used to be

 I lay down and enter a dream
 Unlike anywhere I've been
 All is silent and sweet

 Then I'm falling down to the ground
 And I'm lost from what I've found
 Can't stand the sounds no more

 Take me back so I can see
 The way it used to be
 The way it used to be

 Move me from the water
 Too cold to swim
 Bring me to the land
 Move me from the water
 That I see within
 Bring me to the land

 Radio waves
 Splash through my head
 To a rhythm that I crave
 Radio waves
 Relive the moment
 Seems like yesterday

 Take me back to Twelve Mile Bay
 Where I'll sit at the edge with my feet in the water
 Take me back as the sun fades away
 Break down the walls so I can breathe

 Move me from the water
 Too cold to swim
 Bring me to the land
 Move me from the water
 That I see within
 Bring me to the land

 Move me from the water
 Too cold to swim
 Bring me to the land
 Move me from the water
 That I see within

 The way it used to be
 The way it used to be

 Move me from the water
 Too cold to swim
 Bring me to the land
 Move me from the water
 That I see within
 Bring me to the land

 Move me from the water
 Too cold to swim
 Bring me to the land
 Move me from the water
 That I see within


 "I'm Not the Guy"
 by Dan Bern

 You can categorize me
 Lump me with the others
 If that's the way you wanna play
 You can say that the way it's been
 Is exactly the way that it's gotta be
 And I'll make you feel right
 If you gotta feel right
 Well if you're willing to live truthfully
 I think you'll see
 That babe I'm not the guy who
 Hurt you many years ago

 I'm not the guy
 I'm not the guy
 I'm not the guy

 Babe what are you seeing?
 When you look in my eyes
 Maybe someone from a magazine
 Is that someone who hurt you?
 You don't gotta explain it
 I used to read that magazine myself
 But last night in the kitchen, yeah
 I cancelled my subscription, yeah
 And maybe you'll believe me babe
 That you don't need to carry yours
 Around anymore

 'Cause I'm not the guy
 I'm not the guy
 I'm not the guy
 
 I'm not the guy who made you crawl into the shell
 I'm not the guy who threw your heart against the wall
 I'm not the guy who made you feel like all you did was lost
 I'm not the guy who loved you babe, and kept his fingers crossed
 
 I'm not the guy
 I'm not the guy
 I'm not the guy
 
 I'm not the guy who tried to hide his wedding ring
 I'm not the guy who disappeared after the spring
 I'm not the guy who took care of you for a weekend stay
 I'm not the guy who loved you babe, and took his love away
 
 I'm not the guy (6x)
 

 "One More Minute"
 by Weird Al Yankovic

 Well I heard that you're leavin'
 Gonna leave me far behind
 'cause you found a brand new lover
 You decided that I'm not your kind
 
 So I pulled your name out of my Rolodex
 And I tore all your pictures in two
 And I burned down the malt shop where we used to go
 Just because it reminds me of you

 That's right, you ain't gonna see me cryin'
 I'm glad that you found somebody new
 'cause I'd rather spend eternity
 Eating shards of broken glass
 Than spend one more minute with you

 I guess I might seem kind of bitter
 You've got me feeling down in the dumps
 'cause I'm stranded all alone at the gas station of love
 And I have to use the self service pumps!

 Oh so, honey, let me help you with that suitcase
 You ain't gonna break my heart in two
 'cause I'd rather get a hundred thousand paper cuts on my face
 Then spend one more minute with you
 
 I'd rather rip out my intestines with a fork
 Then watch you going out with other men
 I'd rather slam my fingers in a door
 Again and again and again and again and again
 (Oh can't ya see what I'm trying to tell ya darling!)

 I'd rather have my blood sucked out by leeches
 Shove an ice pick under a toenail or two
 I'd rather clean all the bathrooms
 in Grand Central Station... with my tongue
 Then spend one more minute with you.
 
 Yes, I'd rather jump naked on a huge pile of thumbtacks
 Or stick my nostrils together with Krazy Glue
 I'd rather dive into a swimming pool
 filled with double edged razor blades
 Then spend one more minute with you
 
 I'd rather rip my heart right outta my ribcage
 With my bare hands and then throw it on the floor
 And stomp on it 'till I die!!!!
 (GASP!)
 Then spend... one more minute... with you
 

 "The Wedding March"
 by Prefab Sprout

 one dance whose steps, i never could learn
 its called the wedding march
 the grace it takes, the grace you deserve
 requires a lighter touch
 i know you love dancing
 oh i know that you love dancing so much
 
 music's a wild thing, with mischief to prove
 i can't adjust to the way that you move
 music's a wild thing, whatever the groove
 some music isn't for dancing
 
 one dance whose steps, i never could learn
 it's called the wedding march
 the grace that it takes, the balance and poise
 i still find a mystery
 i know you love dancing
 so, i know that you'd hate dancing-- with me
 

 "Aneurysm"
 by Nirvana

 Come on over and do the twist
 Overdo it and have a fit
 Love you so much it makes me sick
 Come on over and do the twist

 Beat me outta me (Beat it, beat it)

 Come on over and do the twist
 Over-do it and have a fit
 Over-do it and have a fit
 Love you so much it makes me sick
 Come on over and shoot the shit

 She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
 

 "She Talks To Angels"
 by The Black Crowes

 She never mentions the word addiction
 In certain company
 Yes, she'll tell you she's an orphan
 After you meet her family

 She paints her eyes as black as night now
 She pulls those shades down tight
 She gives a smile when the pain comes
 The pain gonna' make everything alright

 Says she talks to angels
 They call her out by her name
 Oh yeah, she talks to angels
 Says they call her out by her name

 She keeps a lock of hair in her pocket
 She wears a cross around her neck
 Yes the hair is from a little boy
 And the cross from someone she has not met
 Not yet

 (Repeat Chorus)

 She don't know no lovers
 None that I've ever seen
 And to her that means nothing
 But to me it means, means everything

 (Repeat second verse)

 (Repeat Chorus)


 "Invisible Man"

 "Listen, Green!"
 "Green listen!"

 They can't see me
 They can't touch me

 Now you are
 The invisible man

 
 "Another Rainy Night (Without You)"
 by Queensryche

 Don't slam the door on your way out
 Don't leave without saying goodbye
 Another long distance night alone
 You leave me wanting, always leave me wanting more
 Last word today, coming home to stay?
 Wouldn't that be nice, for awhile?

 But now my take-out food is growing cold
 And the candle's burned a hole in the floor
 And I'm still waiting for the ring of the phone

 CHORUS
 I'm all alone
 And it's another rainy night, without you
 Guess I'll leave the light on for you
 It's just another rainy night without you

 Listen, there's a foghorn blowing from the coast tonight
 Remember making love in the rain?
 Strange how laughter looks like crying with no sound
 Raindrops taste like tears, without the pain
 I'm not much without you, can't leave if I wanted to
 Maybe that's why you stay around

 But tonight I'll sit here tending the fire
 and pace the floor one hundred times in an hour
 And check the voice-mail for a message you've called

 CHORUS

 Waiting by the phone, alone
 And it's another rainy night without you

 Hate the sound of the closing door
 And your footseps walking away

 But now my takeout food is growing cold
 and the candle's burned a hole in the floor and
 I'm still waiting for the ring of the phone

 CHORUS


 "Fly on the Windscreen"
 by Depeche Mode

 Death is everywhere
 There are flies on the windscreen
 For a start
 Reminding us
 We could be torn apart
 Tonight

 Death is everywhere
 There are lambs for the slaughter
 Waiting to die
 And I can sense
 The hours slipping by
 Tonight

 Come here
 Kiss me
 Now
 Come here
 Kiss me
 Now

 Death is everywhere
 The more I look
 The more I see
 The more I feel
 A sense of urgency
 Tonight

 Come here (touch me)
 Kiss me (touch me)
 Now (touch me)
 (touch me)

 There are flies on the windscreen
 There are lambs for the slaughter
 There are flies on the windscreen

 Come here (touch me)
 Kiss me (touch me)
 Now (touch me)
 (touch me)
 Come here (touch me)
 Kiss me (touch me)
 Now (touch me)
 (touch me)


 "Helter Skelter"
 by The Beatles

 When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
 Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
 Till I get to the bottom and I see you again.

 Do you, don't you want me to love you
 I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you
 Tell me tell me tell me come on tell me the answer
 Well you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer.

 Helter skelter helter skelter
 Helter skelter.

 Will you, won't you want me to make you
 I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
 Tell me tell me tell me the answer
 You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer.

 Look out helter skelter helter skelter
 Helter skelter
 Look out, cause here she comes.

 When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
 And I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
 And I get to the bottom and I see you again

 Well do you, don't you want me to make you
 I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
 Tell me tell me tell me the answer
 You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer.

 Look out helter skelter helter skelter Helter skelter
 Look out helter skelter
 She's coming down fast
 Yes she is
 Yes she is.

 [I got blisters on my fingers]


 "Cygnus X-1 Book II: Hemispheres"
 by Rush


 I. Prelude

 When our weary world was young
 The struggle of the ancients first began.
 The gods of Love and Reason
 Sought alone to rule the fate of Man.
 
 They battled through the ages,
 But still neither force would yield.
 The people were divided,
 Every soul a battlefield.
 

 II. Apollo/Dionysus
 
 Apollo: Bringer of Wisdom
 "I bring truth and understanding,
 I bring wit and wisdom fair,
 Precious gifts beyond compare.
 We can build a world of wonder,
 I can make you all aware.
 I will find you food and shelter,
 Show you fire to keep you warm
 Through the endless winter storm.
 You can live in grace and comfort
 In the world that you transform."
 
 The people were delighted
 Coming forth to claim their prize
 They ran to build their cities
 And converse among the wise.
 But one day the streets fell silent,
 Yet they knew not what was wrong.
 The urge to build these fine things
 Seemed not to be so strong.
 The wise men were consulted,
 And the Bridge of Death was crossed
 In quest of Dionysus
 To find out what they had lost.
 
 Dionysus: Bringer of Love
 "I bring love to give you solace
 In the darkness of the night,
 In the Heart's eternal light.
 You need only trust your feelings;
 Only love can steer you right.
 I bring laughter, I bring music,
 I bring joy and I bring tears.
 I will soothe your primal fears.
 Throw off those chains of reason
 And your prison disappears."
 
 The cities were abandoned,
 And the forests echoed song.
 They danced and lived as brothers;
 They knew love could not be wrong.
 Food and wine they had aplenty
 And they slept beneath the stars.
 The people were contented
 And the gods watched from afar.
 But the winter fell upon them
 And it caught them unprepared,
 Bringing wolves and cold starvation,
 And the hearts of men despaired.
 

 III. Armageddon: The Battle of Heart and Mind

 The universe divided
 As the Heart and Mind collided,
 With the people left unguided
 For so many troubled years.
 In a cloud of doubts and fears,
 Their world was torn asunder into hollow
 Hemispheres.
 
 Some fought themselves, some fought each other,
 Most just followed one another
 Lost and aimless like their brothers
 For their hearts were so unclear
 And the truth could not appear
 Their spirits were divided into blinded
 Hemispheres.
 
 Some who did not fight
 Brought tales of old to light.
 "My Rocinante sailed by night
 On her final flight."
 To the heart of Cygnus' fearsome force
 We set our course
 Spiralled through that timeless space
 To this immortal place.
 

 IV. Cygnus: Bringer of Balance

 I have memory and awareness,
 But I have no shape or form.
 As a disembodied spirit,
 I am dead and yet unborn.
 I have passed into Olympus
 As was told in tales of old,
 To the city of Immortals,
 Marble white and purest gold...
 
 I see the gods in battle rage on high...
 Thunderbolts across the sky...
 I cannot move, I cannot hide...
 I feel a silent scream begin inside...
 
 Then all at once the chaos ceased
 A stillness fell, a sudden peace
 The warriors felt my silent cry
 And stayed their struggle, mystified.
 
 Apollo was atonished;
 Dionysus thought me mad.
 But they heard my story further
 And they wondered, and were sad.
 
 Looking down from Olympus
 On a world of doubt and fear,
 Its surface splintered
 Into sorry Hemispheres.
 
 They sat a while in silence,
 Then they turned at last to me:
 "We will call you Cygnus,
 The god of Balance you shall be."
 
 The Sphere: A Kind of Dream

 We can walk our road together
 If our goals are all the same.
 We can run alone and free
 If we pursue a different aim.
 Let the Truth of Love be lighted,
 Let the Love of Truth shine clear. Sensibility,
 Armed with sense and liberty,
 With the Heart and Mind united in a single
 Perfect
 Sphere.


 "Night by Night"
 by Steely Dan

 It's a beggars life, said the Queen of Spain
 But don't tell it to a poor man
 'Cause he's got to kill for every thrill
 The best he can
 Everywhere around me
 I see jealousy and mayhem
 Because no men have all their peace of mind
 To carry them
 Well I don't really care
 If it's wrong or if it's right
 But until my ship comes in
 I'll live night by night

 When the joker tried to tell me
 I could cut it in this rube town
 When he tried to hang that sign on me
 I said Take it down
 When the dawn patrol got to tell you twice
 They're gonna do it with a shotgun
 Yes, I'm cashing in this ten-cent life
 For another one
 
 Well I ain't got the heart
 To lose another fight
 So until my ship comes in
 I'll live night by night
 
 Well I don't really care
 If it's wrong or if it's right
 But until my ship comes in
 I'll live night by night


 "See You On The Other Side"
 by Ozzy Osbourne

 Voices, a thousand, thousand voices
 Whispering, the time has passed for choices
 Golden days are passing over, yeah

 I can't seem to see you baby
 Although my eyes are open wide
 But I know I'll see you once more
 When I see you, I'll see you on the other side
 Yes, I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side

 Leaving, I hate to see you cry
 Grieving, I hate to say goodbye
 Dust and ash forever, yeah

 Though I know we mus be parted
 As sure as stars are in the sky
 I'm gonna see when it comes to glory
 And I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side
 Yes I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side

 Never thought I'd feel like this
 Strange to be alone, yeah
 But we'll be together
 Carved in stone, carved in stone, carved in stone

 Hold me, hold me thight, I'm falling
 Far away. Distant voices calling
 I'm so cold. I need you darling, yeah

 I was down, but now I'm flying
 Straight across the great divide
 I know you're crying, but I'll stop you crying
 When I see you, I see you on the other side
 Yes. I'll see you. See you on the othe side
 I'm gonna see you. See you on the other side
 God knows I'll see you, see you on the other side, yeah

 I'll see you. See you on the othe side
 I'm gonna see you. See you on the other side
 God knows I'll see you, see you on the other side, yeah
 I wanna see you, yeah, yeah, yeah, see you on the other side
 God knows I'll see you, see you on the other side, yeah
 I'm gonna see you. See you on the other side


 Album: Totally Crushed Out!
 by that dog.


 "Ms. Wrong"

 So he said, "want to go to a movie?"
 So she thinks, what do I want to do?"
 So he said, "I think you're pretty."
 So she thinks, "I wish I liked you."
 
 If I could draw a map of a boy that I would like, 
 your resume would be shining like a bright green light.
 If I didn't feel so wrong, you'd be my Mr. Right.
 
 so he said, "I have something to ask you."
 So she thinks, "this makes no sense."
 So he said, "are you a teepee or a wigwam?"
 So she thinks, "I'm just too tense."
 
 If I could draw a map of a boy that I would like, 
 your resume would be shining like a bright green light.
 If I didn't feel so wrong,
 you'd be my Mr. Right.
 

 "Silently"

 You silently cheer me up. You don't even know it.
 You silently piss me off. You don't even know it.
 You silently turn me up. You don't even know it. 
 You silently check me out. You don't even know it.


 "Back Of My Mind"

 In the back of my mind, I saw a door.
 In the back of my mind, I went for more.
 In the back of my mind, less than I see.
 In the back of my mind, not enough for me.
 
 In the back of my mind, I saw the door.
 In the back of my mind, I went for more.
 In the back of my mind, but you shut it on me.
 In the back of my mind, now what do I see?


 "He's Kissing Christian"

 He's kissing Christian and it's making him feel backwards.
 He's kissing Christian 'cause he's such a successful bachelor.
 He's kissing Christian and it's making my back hurt.
 He's kissing Christian and it's making you cry.

 Come out, come out, come out, wherever you are.
 Come out, come out, come out, wherever you are.
 Come out, come out, come out.
 Come out, come out, come out, wherever you are.

 He's kissing Christian and he's taking it like a beating. 
 He's kissing Christian and it's seeming like he's cheating.
 He's kissing Christian and it's keeping me from eating
 He's kissing Christian and it's making you high.
 He's kissing Christian.
 He's kissing Christian.
 He's kissing Christian, and it's making you die.
 

 "Anymore"

 I can't do this anymore.
 I can't think anymore.
 I can't sit here anymore, and wait for you.
 
 I can't be there anymore. 
 I can't compete here anymore.
 I can't give treatment anymore, and be sweet to you.


 "To Keep Me"

 It's time to shut off.
 It's time to get lost.
 I must turn me around.
 
 To lessen the pain.
 To broaden the truth.
 To dispose of no gain.
 I haven't the proof.

 To keep me from falling back.
 To keep me from letting go.
 To keep me from holding onto myself.
 
 The era has ended. 
 The time has come.
 It will be so splendid.
 We've only just begun.

 To keep me from falling back.
 To keep me of letting go.
 To teach me from holding onto myself.


 "Lip Gloss"

 Tie me down with dental floss.
 Tie me up with love and say you miss me.
 'Cause I keep putting on lip gloss.
 And you won't kiss me.

 Kiss my lips.
 Kiss, kiss, kiss me.
 Put your hands on my hips, 
 Slap some of that bliss on me.
 Kiss, kiss, kiss my lips.

 Run your fingers through my locks.
 In a corner back me in and dis me.
 'Cause I keep putting on so much lip gloss.
 And you won't kiss me.

 Lily white. Cherry raspberry. Lip lover. Rachel Perry.
 Lily white. Cherry raspberry. Lip lover. Rachel Perry.
 
 Ragged, young, possessed and sauced.
 Walk around all day and be a sissy.
 'Cause I keep putting on so much lip gloss.
 And you won't kiss me.

 Kiss my lips.
 Kiss, kiss, kiss me.
 Put your hands on my hips, 
 Slap some of that bliss on me.
 Kiss, kiss, kiss my lips.
 Kiss, kiss, kiss my lips.
 Kiss, kiss, kiss my lips.


 "She Doesn't Know How" 

 She doesn't know how to give herself a chance.
 She doesn't know how to go home.
 She doesn't know how to go to sleep at night.
 She doesn't know how, she doesn't know how.
 
 She's getting sick and tired of feeling the same old things.
 She's getting sick and tired of not giving in.
 But in her own way, she is letting go.
 She doesn't know how, she doesn't know how.
 
 She doesn't know how.
 She doesn't know how.
 She doesn't know how.
 She doesn't know how.


 "Holidays"

 This always happens to me just when I feel happy.
 They go and turn on me again.
 The same thing every time, I go out on a line.
 Everyone else turns out fine.
 
 Holidays are all the same.
 Always have myself to blame.
 Don't want to feel this way again.
 
 When it's one of those days, I go into a craze.
 My head and body feel malaise.
 
 Holidays are all the same.
 Always have myself to blame.
 Don't want to feel this way again.
 

 "Side Part"

 Part of this is waiting.
 Part of this is baiting you.
 Part of this is parting us.
 Part of this is this part of you.
 
 Part of this is faking. 
 Part of this is waking.
 Part of this is breaking us.
 'Cause part of this is this part of you.

 Part of this is somewhere.
 Part of this is wondering.
 Part of this is parting this.
 Part of this is this part.
 Part of this is this part.
 Because part of this is parting this with you.


 "One Summer Night"

 One summer night.
 I was fourteen.
 He threw his thongs up at my windows 
 and he asked if he could come up and see me.

 He sat in the quad.
 Across from me.
 He asked my options about his short stories, it was flattering.
  
 Saw him at the prom.
 He danced with me.
 I asked him if he'd write me when I went away to school,
 and he said, "maybe."
 We kissed goodnight.
 I thought I'd never see him again.
 But he showed up at my window that one summer night,
 and I made him leave.


 "Michael Jordan"

 Why does he give up so easily?


 "Rockstar"

 Could you sign my guitar?
 Can I take a picture with a rock star?
 Your face wallpapers my walls.
 Here's my number, when you're in town give me a call.
 I know I don't know you, but I'm in-love.
 The bad reviews kill me 'cause I know what you're made of.
 I have ten copies of you on the cover.
 When I went to see you, got a ride from my mother.
 
 Your CD singles comfort my ears.
 Your unplugged songs bring me to tears.
 I see your video in my dreams.
 Can I shake your hand, you're totally supreme.


 "Tom Sawyer"
 by Rush

 A modern-day warrior
 Mean mean stride,
 Today's Tom Sawyer
 Mean mean pride.
 
 Though his mind is not for rent
 Don't put him down as arrogant
 His reserve, a quiet defense
 Riding out the day's events
 The river
 
 What you say about his company
 Is what you say about society
 Catch the mist, catch the myth
 Catch the mystery, catch the drift

 The world is, the world is
 Love and life are deep
 Maybe as his skies are wide
 
 Today's Tom Sawyer
 He gets high on you
 And the space he invades
 He gets by on you
 
 No his mind is not for rent
 To any god or government
 Always hopeful, yet discontent
 He knows changes aren't permanent
 But change is
 
 What you say about his company
 Is what you say about society
 Catch the witness, catch the wit
 Catch the spirit, catch the spit
 
 The world is, the world is
 Love and life are deep
 Maybe as his eyes are wide
 
 Exit the warrior
 Today's Tom Sawyer
 He gets high on you
 And the energy you trade
 He gets right on to the friction of the day
 

 "Life Goes On"
 by Poison

 I felt this before
 Now I feel it again
 No matter how hard I try
 This feeling won't end

 So I pretend you're here by my side
 Tonight on this lonely ride
 I keep telling myself that

 Chorus:
 Life goes on while you're miles away
 And I need you
 Time goes on as night steals the day
 There's nothing I can do

 You heal up my wounds
 I tasted your tears
 You spilled out your heart
 So I let out my fears

 But one fear that I kept to myself
 Was how I prayed that you'd love no one else
 Like you're saying you love me

 Chorus

 If you only knew how much I miss you

 Solo

 When my mind plays these tricks on me
 It shows me things I don't want to see
 That's why I tell myself
 I keep telling myself
 Just take another piece of me

 Chorus

 And this last mile I travel with you


 "Falling To Pieces"
 by Faith No More

 Back and forth, I sway with the wind
 Resolution slips away again
 Right through my fingers, back into my heart
 Where it's out of reach and it's in the dark

 Sometimes I think I'm blind
 Or I may be just paralyzed

 Because the plot thickens every day
 And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumblin' away
 But I know, there's a picture beneath

 Indecision clouds my vision
 No one listens...

 Because I'm somewhere in between
 My love and my agony
 You see, I'm somewhere in between
 My life is falling to pieces
 Somebody put me together

 Layin' face down on the ground
 My fingers in my ears to block the sound
 My eyes shut tight to avoid the sight
 Anticipating the end, losing the will to fight

 Droplets of "yes" and "no"
 In an ocean of "maybe"

 From the bottom, it looks like a steep incline
 From the top, another downhill slope of mine
 But I know, the equilibrium's there

 Indecision clouds my vision
 No one listens

 Because I'm somewhere in between
 My love and my agony
 You see, I'm somewhere in between
 My life is falling to pieces
 Somebody put me together 


 "Ghost of Winter"
 by Lillian Axe

 As I lie awake
 All the memories of my life
 seem to come and fade
 Wakes me in the dead of night
 
 Am I slipping away?
 Is my memory leaving me?
 When it's cold and dark
 Ghost of winter comes to me
 
 Look at me: I'm eternal thought
 It's a shame but we must part
 It's just a dream
 It's just a dream
 
 Dreams that seem so real
 Granny tells me it's okay
 Won't you cry to sleep
 You'll wake up to a brand new day
 
 Tears to wake the dead
 Tells them it's not all in vain
 Since the dawn of man
 Think how many felt the rain
 
 It's far from what you know
 But now I have to go
 It's just a dream
 It's just a dream
 
 In the world darkness follows me
 Hiding out in places I can't see
 I'll tell you one thing
 I'll never change my ways
 Fly high
 
 I can't distinguish reality from dream
 Ghost of Winter, won't you hear my silent scream?
 
 Ghost of Winter, hear my silent scream
 Ghost of Winter, return me to my dream
 Ghost of Winter, hear my silent scream
 Ghost of Winter, return me to my dream
 
 You've shown me one thing I've never ever seen
 So take me back there
 I've got to have a dream
 Oh Ghost of Winter, hear my silent scream

 Fly high...


 "Gardenhead / Leave Me Alone"
 by Neutral Milk Hotel

 There are beads that wrap
 Around your knees that crackle into the dark
 Like a walk in the park like a hole in your head
 Like the feeling you get when you realize you're dead
 This time we ride roller coasters into the ocean
 We feel no emotion as we spiral down to the world
 And I guess it's worth your time
 Because there's some lives you live
 And some you leave behind
 It gets hard to explain
 The gardenhead knows my name
 
 Leave me alone, for you know this isn't the first time
 In fact this is twice in a row
 That the angels have slipped through our landslide
 And filled up our garden with snow
 And I don't wish to taste of your insides
 Or to call out your name through my phone
 For the glory boys at your bedside will love you
 As long as you're something to own

 Follow me through a city of frost covered angels
 I swear I have nothing to prove
 I just want to dance in your tangles
 To give me some reason to move
 But to take on the world at all angles
 Requires a strength I can't use
 So I'll meet you up high in your anger
 Of all that is hoping and waiting for you


 "(There Is) Always Something There To Remind Me"
 by Naked Eyes

 I walk along the city streets you used to walk along with me
 And every step I take reminds me of the way we used to be

 Well how can I forget you girl
 When there is always something there to remind me
 Always something there to remind me

 Shadows fall I pass a small cafe where we would dance at night
 I can't help recalling how it felt to kiss and hold you tight

 Well how can I forget you girl
 When there is always something there to remind me
 Always something there to remind me 

 I was born to love her
 and I will never be free
 You'll always be a part of me 

 If you should find to use the sweet and tender love we used to share
 Just go back to the places where we used to go and I'll be there

 Well how can I forget you girl
 When there is always something there to remind me
 Always something there to remind me 

 I was born to love her
 and I will never be free
 You'll always be a part of me

 'Cause there is always something there to remind me
 Always something there to remind me
 Always something there to remind me
 Always something there to remind me... 


 "K.C.R."
 by Spiderbait

 Step on me and I'll cut you open
 Step on me and I'll cut you open
 Step on me and I'll cut you open
 Step on me

 Step on me and I'll cut you open
 Step on me and I'll cut you open
 Step on me and I'll cut you open
 Step on me

 Step on me and I'll cut you open
 Step on me and I'll cut you open
 Step on me and I'll cut you open
 Step on me

 Look in the mirror
 I play with my hair
 It's long and It's lovely
 And lavish and fair

 I comb it and stroke it
 And wash it all day
 It makes me so sexy
 Yeah, that's what they say

 Look at my body
 It's long and It's lean
 It sure may be pretty
 But boy am I mean

 Paid all those bogans
 And, God, they're obscene
 They'll never touch
 My big bacon machine

 Rocking and rolling
 And looking real good
 Slamming and banging
 My head like I should
  
 Now don't you mess with me
 I might start a fight
 I've got some ripped jeans
 Look so cool and so tight

 I love your attention
 When you hold me near
 Now shut up and buy me
 Some smokes and more beer

 I know that you love me
 And I love me too
 But what you don't know is
 That I'm using you!

 Talk to me and I'll make you sick
 Talk to me and I'll make you sick
 Talk to me and I'll make you sick
 Don't talk to me

 Talk to me and I'll make you sick
 Talk to me and I'll make you sick
 Talk to me and I'll make you sick
 Don't you talk to me!

 
 "Strange Machines"
 by The Gathering

 it has always been in the back of my mind
 dreaming about going to the corners of time
 i always wanted to fly
 in strange machines

 i wanna do centuries in a lifetime
 and feel it with my hands
 touch the world war II and Cleopatra
 flying...

 could it be that my dream would come true
 building a machine that would
 actually do what i want it to do
 russian revolution, let's do that in one day
 Beethoven and Gershwin i think that would be o.k.
 more than anything i wanna fly
 in strange machines

 i wanna do centuries in a lifetime
 and see it with my eyes
 watch Jesus rise, if he ever did
 flying...

 i wanna do centuries in a lifetime
 and feel it with my hands
 touch renaissance and Chaka Khan
 flying...


 "Revolution 1"
 by The Beatles

 You say you want a revolution
 Well you know
 We all want to change the world
 You tell me that it's evolution
 Well you know
 We all want to change the world
 But when you talk about destruction
 Don't you know you can count me out... in

 Don't you know it's gonna be alright
 Alright
 Alright

 You say you got a real solution
 Well you know
 we'd all love to see the plan
 You ask me for a contribution
 Well you know
 We're doing what we can
 But if you want money for people with minds that hate
 All I can tell you is brother you have to wait

 Don't you know it's gonna be alright
 Alright
 Alright

 You say you'll change the constitution
 Well you know
 we all love to change your head
 You tell me it's the institution
 Well you know
 You better free your mind instead
 But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
 You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow

 Don't you know it's gonna be alright
 Alright
 Alright


 "Clown"

 Anger inside builds within my body
 Why'd you hit me?

 You tried to hit me!

 -The pain will begin, if you like [Do you want me to begin, if you like]
 Throw your hate at me with all your might
 Hit me 'cause I'm strange, hit me!
 You tell me I'm a pussy and you're harder than me
 What's with you boy? Think hard.
 A tattooed body to hide who you are
 Scared to be honest, be yourself
 A cowardly man!

 I don't run around trying to be what's not within me
 Look into my eyes, I am free
 You're just a wanna-be

 To come out
 Hit me clown

 Clown you ain't shit. Turn around and get your face split.
 I'm just too fucking little! I'm just a fucking mental!


 "New Model No.15"
 by Marilyn Manson

 I'm as fake as a wedding cake
 And I'm Vague and I know that I'm homopolitan
 Pitifully predictable
 Correctly political
 I'm the new, I'm the new, new model
 I've got nothing inside
 Better in the head and in bed
 At the office I can suck and I smile

 New, new, new model

 I can choke and diet on coke
 I'm Spun and I know That I'm Stoned and Rolling
 Lifelike and poseable
 Hopeless and disposable
 I'm the new, I'm the new, new model
 I've got nothing inside
 Better in the head and in bed
 At the office I can suck and I smile

 New, new, new model

 Don't let them know how far you go
 Or that you use you "lovers"
 Oh look, you're like a VCR
 Stick something in to know
 Just who you are you

 New, new, new model


 "This Love"
 by Pantera

 If ever words were spoken painful and untrue
 I said I loved but I lied

 In my life I all wanted
 Was the keeping
 Of someone like you
 As it turns out
 Deeper within me
 Love was twisted
 And pointed at you

 Never-ending pain
 Quickly ending life

 Chorus:
 You keep this love
 Thing
 Love
 Child
 Love
 Toy
 You keep this love
 Fist
 Love
 Scar
 Love
 Break
 You keep this love
 Love
 Love
 You keep this Love
 Love
 Love
 You keep this love

 I'd been the tempting one
 Stole her from herself
 This gift in pain
 Her pain was life

 And sometimes I feel so sorry
 I regret this this
 The hurting of you
 But you make me so unhappy
 I'd take my life
 And leave love with you

 I'd kill myself for you
 I'd kill you for myself

 Chorus

 No more head trips


 "Potters Field"
 by Anthrax

 I was told to love you
 I was told to try
 I was born to save you
 I was born to die
 I'll always be your scapegoat
 You'll never take the blame
 You never had a chance
 It was your soul to save
 I am your one night nightmare
 Pain is all you see
 The blood is on your hands
 I hope you're proud of me

 I was told to love you
 I learned how to hate
 I was born to save you
 Your choice became your fate
 You can't take care of yourself
 How could you care for me?
 I am your retribution
 When is my soul free?
 I never asked for mercy
 You told me to forgive
 The blood is on your hands
 I hope your proud of me
 And what I've done to set you free
 I can barely hold myself

 Fascination, stimulation, stronger as I learn
 By his hand, I understand
 I was told to burn

 Bastard son, your saving grace
 Left alone I found my place
 I find love in what I steal
 You should of left me rest in Potters Field
 I was told to. I was told to...

 Your beliefs turned me into this
 Bite the hand that feeds, you're so selfish
 Thank you mother for giving me this life
 I'll bring down the rapture
 Then we'll see who lies

 Fascination, stimulation, stronger as I learn
 By his hand, I understand,
 I was told to burn

 Bastard son, your saving grace
 Left alone I found my place
 I find love in what I steal
 You should of left me rest in Potters Field
 I was told to. I was told to.
 I was told to. I was told to...
 Stop it


 "Enjoy the Silence"
 by Depeche Mode

 Words like violence
 Break the silence
 Come crashing in
 Into my little world
 Painful to me
 Pierce right through me
 Can't you understand
 Oh my little girl

 All I ever wanted
 All I ever needed
 Is here in my arms
 Words are very unnecessary
 They can only do harm

 Vows are spoken
 To be broken
 Feelings are intense
 Words are trivial
 Pleasures remain
 So does the pain
 Words are meaningless
 And forgettable

 All I ever wanted
 All I ever needed
 Is here in my arms
 Words are very unnecessary
 They can only do harm

 Enjoy the silence


 "Teacher"
 by Jethro Tull

 Well the dawn was coming, heard him ringing on my bell.
 He said, ``My name's the teacher, that is what I call myself.
 And I have a lesson that I must impart to you.
 It's an old expression but I must insist it's true.

 Jump up, look around, find yourself some fun,
 no sense in sitting there hating everyone.
 No man's an island and his castle isn't home,
 the nest is for nothing when the bird has flown.''

 So I took a journey, threw my world into the sea.
 With me went the teacher who found fun instead of me.

 Hey man, what's the plan, what was that you said?
 Sun-tanned, drink in hand, lying there in bed.
 I try to socialize but I can't seem to find
 what I was looking for, got something on my mind.

 Then the teacher told me it had been a lot of fun.
 Thanked me for his ticket and all that I had done.

 Hey man, what's the plan, what was that you said?
 Sun-tanned, drink in hand, lying there in bed.
 I try to socialize but I can't seem to find
 what I was looking for, got something on my mind.


 "Midnight Mountain"
 by Cathedral

 Sliding down a mountain,
 as dusk passes to day.
 The antidote of elation,
 now lifeless masses wake.
 Jaws of suxiety open,
 the luring vampire of agility,
 a fatal invitation,
 sight hazing from me.

 Chorus:
 Oh midnight mountain.
 I require inner re-location,
 back to pinnacles high.

 Drowning in empty faces,
 sinking in banal,
 I crave the isolation of eventide when perception climbs.
 I just need the injection,
 a dose to boost my flight,
 a sonic blast of moonlight,
 nucleus ignites

 Chorus:
 Oh midnight mountain,
 now I'm revived,
 stimulus transcending back to pinnacles high.

 Screaming at doleful skies,
 absorbing all my sighs,
 responding to my cries -
 downcast a thunder of reprise,
 won't let the next sunrise,
 signal my landslide,
 from ecstatic highs.
 I'm on top of their demise.

 
 "Iris"
 by Goo Goo Dolls

 And I'd give up forever to touch you, cause I know that you feel me somehow 
 You're the closest thing to heaven that I'll ever be, and I don't want to go
     home right now
 And all I can taste is this moment, and all I can breathe is your life 
 'Cause sooner or later it's over, I just don't want to miss you tonight 

 And I don't want the world to see me, 'cause I don't think that they'd
     understand
 That when everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am 

 And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming, or the moment of truth in
     your lies
 When everything seems like the movies, yeah, you bleed just to know you're
     alive

 (Repeat chorus)

 (Instrumental)

 (Repeat chorus)

 I just want you to know who I am...


 "One Slip"
 by Pink Floyd

 A restless eye across a weary room
 A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
 The music played and played as we whirled without end
 No hint, no word her honour to defend
 
 I will, I will she sighed to my request
 And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
 Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
 I lead the way to the funeral pyre
 And without a thought of the consequence
 I gave in to my decadence
 
 One slip, and down the hole we fall
 It seems to take no time at all
 A momentary lapse of reason
 That binds a life for life
 A small regret, you won't forget,
 There'll be no sleep in here tonight
 
 Was it love, or was it the idea of being in love?
 Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?
 The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown
 The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone
 
 One slip, and down the hole we fall
 It seems to take no time at all
 A momentary lapse of reason
 That binds a life for life
 A small regret, you will never forget,
 There'll be no sleep in here tonight
 

 "Barrytown"
 by Steely Dan

 I'm not one to look behind I know that times must change
 But over there in Barrytown they do things very strange
 And though you're not my enemy
 I like things like they used to be
 And though you'd like some company
 I'm standing by myself
 Go play with someone else
 I can see by what you carry that you come from Barrytown
 
 Don't believe I'm taken in by stories I have heard
 I just read the Daily News and swear by every word
 And don't think that I'm out of line
 For speaking out for what is mine
 I'd like to see you do just fine
 But look at what you wear
 And the way you cut your hair
 
 I can see by what you carry that you come from Barrytown
 
 In the beginning we recall that the word was hurled
 Barrytown people got to be from another world
 
 Leave me or I'll be just like the others you will meet
 They won't act as kindly if they see you on the street
 And don't you scream or make a shout
 It's nothing you can do about
 It was there where you came out
 It's a special lack of grace
 I can see it in your face
 
 I can see by what you carry that you come from Barrytown


 "Disgustipated"
 by Tool

 And the angel of the lord came unto me, snatching me up from my place of
     slumber.  And took me on high, and higher still until we moved to the
     spaces betwixt the air itself.  And he brought me into a vast farmlands
     of our own midwest.  And as we descended, cries of impending doom rose
     from the soil.  One thousand, nay a million voices full of fear.  And
     terror possesed me then.  And I begged, "Angel of the Lord, what are
     these tortured screams?"  And the angel said unto me, "These are the
     cries of the carrots, the cries of the carrots!  You see, Reverend
     Maynard, tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust."  And
     I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat like the tears of one million
     terrified brothers and roared, "Hear me now, I have seen the light!
     They have a consciousness, they have a life, they have a soul!  Damn
     you!  Let the rabbits wear glasses!  Save our brothers!"  Can I get an
     amen?  Can I get a hallelujah?  Thank you Jesus.

 Life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on........
 This is necessary.

 It was daylight when you woke up in your ditch.  You looked up at your sky
     then.  That made blue be your color.  You had your knife there with you
     too.  When you stood up there was goo all over your clothes.  Your hands
     were sticky.  You wiped them on your grass, so now your color was green.
     Oh Lord, why did everything always have to keep changing like this.  You
     were already getting nervous again.  Your head hurt and it rang when you
     stood up.  Your head was almost empty.  It always hurt you when you woke
     up like this.  You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road
     and began to walk, waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to
     you.  You can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward
     it.  "If God is our Father," you thought, "then Satan must be our
     cousin."  Why didn't anyone else understand these important things?  You
     got to your car and tried all the doors.  They were locked.  It was a
     red car and it was new.  There was an expensive leather camera case
     laying on the seat.  Out across your field, you could see two tiny
     people walking by your woods.  You began to walk towards them.  Now red
     was your color and, of course, those little people out there were yours
     too.


 Album: The Great Southern Trendkill
 by Pantera


 "THE GREAT SOUTHERN TRENDKILL"

 It's wearing on my mind, I'm speaking all my doubts aloud
 You rob a dead mans grave, then flaunt it like you did create
 If I hit bottom and everythings gone
 In the great Mississippi, please drown me and run
 It's digging  time again, you're nurturing the weakest trend
 Those with the heart and the brain to get past this
 Can spot a pathetic without even asking
 Fuck your magazine, and fuck the long dead plastic scene
 Pierce a new hole, if  Hell was "in"
  you'd give your soul
 (Chorus)
 THE GREAT SOUTHERN TRENDKILL
 That's right,
 THE GREAT SOUTHERN TRENDKILL
 Buy it at a store, from MTV to on the floor
 You look just like a star, it's proof you don't know who you are
 It's bullshit time again, you'll save the world within !
  your trend
 Politically relieved, you're product sold and well received
 The right words spoken gold, if I was God you'd sell your soul to...
 (Chorus)


 "WAR NERVE"

 Truly, fuck the world, for all it's worth, every inch of Planet
 Earth, fuck myself, don't leave me out, but don't get
 involved, don't corner me
 Inside, ulcer, unjust bastards, file out face first
 Meet the lies and see what you are
 (Pre)
 It's forcing you down, and it's grinding against you
 Let the war nerve break
 (Chorus)
 For every fucking second the pathetic media pisses on me and
 judges what I am in one paragraph - Look here - Fuck you all
 Expect the worse, you bleeding heart, but kill me first
 before it starts, yes my cock is getting hard, we are
 born different after all
 Invite mayhem, produce weapons, shoot out, burn down
 No CNN or media now
 (Pre)
 (Chorus)
 All the money in the fucking world couldn't
 buy me one second of trust or one ounce of faith in anything you're
 about
 Fuck you all
 Nothing is worth the sleep that I've lost
 Apologies unacceptable now
 A blistered revenge awaits in me
 This is fucking loveless
 Hate
 Hate mail is not read, in jail instead
 Hate
 The Lord knows, there's worse
 Ignore, this curse
 Hate
 

 "DRAG THE WATERS"

 A smack on the wrists is the words from the mouth
 of the outsiders, lawyers, police
 A small price to pay for the dope and the guns
 And the rape, it should all be O.K.
 Your father is rich, he's the judge, he's the man,
 he's the God that got your sentence reduced
 But in the back of his mind, he well knows what
 he'd find if he looked a little deeper in you - in you
 (Chorus)
 Drag the waters some more
 Like never before
 (Chorus)
 Sweet is the slice and the lips - you're gonna have
 that woman - she is your favorite lay
 Promised you (swore) that no one had been there,
 and she was going to keep it that way
 Let it move in, you got thin, and got high, and
 your money went and so did your friends
 But she's by your side, and her smile cannot hide
 the premonition of the !
  beckoning end - the end
 (Chorus)
 (Chorus)
 In with it, out with
 it


 "10'S"

 My skin is cold, transfusion with somebody morose and
 old, drop into fruitless dying
 It was tempting and bared, the whoring angel rising
 Now burning prayers, my silent time of losing
 (Chorus)
 My foes - they can't destroy my body
 Colliding slow, like life itself
 Long for the blur, we cannot dry much longer
 Cement to dirt, disgusted with my cheapness
 (Chorus)
 (Chorus)
 Reaching down, staring up (at the forgiver)
 
 
 "13 STEPS TO NOWHERE"

 Whores
 Your windows boarded up, your private lives exposed
 The talk shows pump it up, lab rats diseased for show
 We're doomed to use the slang, outbreak of drug roulette
 A church burned to the ground, not even noticed yet
 13 Steps (To Nowhere)
 Whores
 A backwards swastika, the black skin riddled in lead
 A Nazi Gangster Jew, it beats a dog that's dead
 It's in to use the slang, outbreak of gun roulette
 The cross slants to the side, will prove the damnedest yet
 13 Steps - Leads to nowhere
 The backlash dislocates, an untimely rei!
  gn of
 death
 The wolf poked with the stick, awaits with cancerous breath
 (Leads to nowhere)
 Outsiders still suppose, there's Holy streets to roam
 The truth should not surprise, your homes were built on lies
 

 "SUICIDE NOTE PT. 1"

 Cheap cocaine, a dry inhale, the pills that kill and take
 the pain away
 Diet of life, shelter without, the face that cannot
 see inside yours and mine
 (Pre)
 When I'm hiding, when I need it, it lets me
 breathe, for our handle on this life, I don't believe
 this time
 (Chorus)
 Would you look at me now?
 Can you tell I'm a man?
 With these scars on my wrists
 To prove I'll try again
 Try to die again, try to live through this night
 Try to die again.....
 Forever fooling, free and using, sliding down the
 slide that breaks a will
 Mothers angel, getting smarter, how smart are
 you to regress unfulfilled? It's a damn shame,
 but who's to blame?
 (Pre)
 (Chorus)
 

 "SUICIDE NOTE PT. II"

 Out of my mind, gun up to the mouth
 No pretension, execution, live and learn
 Rape and turn
 Fret not family, nor pre-judged army
 This is for me, and
  me only, cowards only
 Try it
 (Chorus)
 Don't you try to die, like me
 It's livid and it's lies and makes graves
 It's not worth the time to try, to replenish a
 rotting life
 I'll end the problem, facing nothing, fuck you off,
 fuck you all
 Tortured history, addict of misery, this exposes me
 for weakness is a magnet - watch me do it
 (Chorus)
 Graves descending down
 Why would you help anyone who doesn't want it,
 doesn't need it, doesn't want your shit advice
 when a mind's made up to go ahead and die?
 What's done is done and gone, so why cry?
 (Chorus)
 
 
 "LIVING THROUGH ME (HELLS' WRATH)"

 I cannot take the take, your condition was nod awake
 A selfish cryer, boldface liar, robbing all of what
 you could take in
 Stabbed towards a death, a dirty smelling girl
 Shit decisions, no provisions, filling veins with juice
 of chaos
 (Chorus)
 Painted face, olive drab, swollen hole, empty bag,
 sunken eyes, whining dog, it's times like this
 you should pray for never
 I broke your fucking mold,!
   then
 threw away the
 cast, new religion and new provisions, it's amazing
 you're alive
 Drop the needle and stop what you're changing into
 Erase the end dissolving, disgrace is needed more
 So I mended severed ties, through flesh we cauterized
 the undeserving, sliming, writhing, I filled you up
 with watered promise
 (Chorus)(2nd half)
 Spitting teeth, oral lust, alley fuck, angel dust, anal whore, bleeding
 knees, it's times
 like this to pray for murder
 (Chorus #2)
 So now I've seen it all, Hells' wrath , no
 man has greater glory, cause now you're living through me
 So I'm done with saving you, a gift unto myself, a
 tired savior, a wasted favor, and I'm lucky I'm alive
 
 
 "FLOODS"

 A dead issue, don't wrestle with it, deaf ears are sleeping
 A guilty bliss, so inviting (let me in), nailed to the cross
 I feel you, relate to you, accuse you
 Wash away us all, take us with the floods
 Then throughout the night, they were raped and executed
 Cold hearted world
 Your language unheard of, the!
   vast sound of tuning out
 The rash of negativity is seen one sidedly, burn away the day
 The nervous, the drifting, the heaving
 Wash away us all, take us with the floods
 Then throughout the day mankind played with grenades
 Cold hearted world
 And at night they might bait the pentagram
 Extinguishing the sun
 Wash away man, take him with the floods
 
 
 "THE UNDERGROUND IN AMERICA"

 Put in position to wage teenage mayhem
 A common affair for the ones who are juiced
 If it is weakness that grants us the power
 We thrive on what's stronger than most of the world
 Glass breaks/the dimming lights/sweat, heat and profane debate/
 the smart ones stay on the outside/while drunken heads and
 arms erupt/centered man swings a punch, spits a tooth, postures
 odd/a punk rock escapade/five bucks a head to be king dick in the crowd
 We are the ones who must sport the position
 cheap beer/trendy clicks/lesbian love is accepted and right/
 shaved heads meet hair in the mix/blending the 80's and 90's
 with hate
 Shows on/dates canceled/kicked out for reasons that seem so
 unfair/skin crusts against the cops/a foregone conclusion that's
 tired and beat
 Ringworm,crabs and lice/V.D. ecstasy, speed and horse/a
 heaven/of unmatched importance/an honor of sex to be stuck by the
 punk
 Rich homes/with money and food/abandoned for the bums on the
 street/a lifestyle that's unexplainable/don't try and save what is
 all meant to be
 If it is free/from (a) family that's seen/you can just keep it
 if you must beg/it's better instead/you must follow the etiquette
 You know when it rains you're in your bed at home
 You act so real when you are alone
 You better not let the mohawked crowd see
 Give it five years, you'll retire your piercings
 You must admit that you mimic the weaklings
 

 "(REPRISE) SANDBLASTED SKIN"

 Scrape it, grind it, peel it, hide it
 The trend is over and gone forever
 Shelf it, box it, save it, frame it
 You won't need that anymore, it's on sale at the dollar store
 Waste of time, pantomime, circus doll, at the local mall
 Exterminate, it's all fake!
 
 Exterminate, it's all fake
 Sandblast yourself
 Sandblast yourself
 Sandblast
 Sandblast
 It's getting old, old, old


 "Missing"
 by Everything But The Girl 

 I step off the train, I'm walking down your street again 
 Come past your door, but you don't live there anymore 
 It's years since you've been there 
 Now you've disappeared somewhere 
 Like outer space - you found some better place 

 And I miss you...
 Like the deserts miss the rain 
 And I miss you 
 Like the deserts miss the rain 

 Could you be dead? You always were two steps ahead
 Of everyone, we'd walk behind while you would run 
 I look up by your house, and I can almost hear you shout 
 Down to me, where I always used to be 
 And I miss you 

 (Repeat chorus)

 I'm back on the train, I ask why did I come again?
 Can I confess? I've been hanging 'round your old address 
 And the years have proved to offer nothing since you moved 
 You're all gone, I can't move on 
 And I miss you 

 (Repeat chorus)


 "Silver Springs"
 by Fleetwood Mac

 You could be my silver spring 
 Blue-green colors flashing 
 I would be your only dream 
 Your shining over ocean crashing 

 Don't say that she's pretty
 And did you say that she loved you 
 Baby I don't want to know 

 So I begin not to love you
 Turn 'round, see me running 
 I say I loved you years ago 
 But tell myself you never loved me no 

 And don't say that she's pretty
 And did you say that she loved you 
 Baby I don't want to know 
 Oh no... 

 And can you tell me was it worth it
 Baby I don't want to know 

 Time cast a spell on you
 But you won't forget me 
 I know I could have loved you 
 But you would not let me 

 (Repeat)

 I follow you down 'till the sound
 Of my voice will haunt you 
 ("Give me just a chance") 
 You'll never get away from the sound 
 Of the woman who loves you 
 ("Was I just a fool") 

 (Repeat)


 "You Made Me Forget My Dreams"
 by Belle & Sebastian

 you made me forget my dreams
 when i woke up to you sleeping
 we had peace for a night at least
 but the trouble starts today
 this morning you'll say
 "i'll see you sometime maybe"
 and I fall back to uneasy sleep
 
 you made me forget my dreams
 i was building a space rocket
 with the boy who played bass guitar
 with the boy who's wearing flares
 he didnt care
 he lit the fuse and ran for a mile
 the space rocket went up in style
 
 i'll lend you two hundred quid
 for a flight across the ocean
 maybe things will look better there
 because they couldn't be much worse
 than tears and a curse
 for men with guns, maturing in age
 will always pay a shitty wage
 they'll always pay a shitty wage
 
 you made me forget my dreams
 when i woke up to you sleeping
 there was blood on the sheets again
 and the view outside the window
 of gardens in bloom
 obscured by all the trouble we had
 i think i better make a move
 

 "Fucken Ace"
 by Spiderbait

 Went to a party it was fucken ace!
 Went to a party it was fucken ace!
 Went to a party it was fucken ace!
 Went to a party I was off my face!

 Went to a party it was fucken ace!
 Went to a party it was fucken ace!
 Went to a party it was fucken ace!
 Went to a party I was off my face!

 Went to a party it was fucken ace!
 Went to a party it was fucken ace!

 I passed out I was off my face!
 Off my face!
 Off my face!
 

 "December"
 by Collective Soul

 Why drink the water from my hand?
 Contagious as you think I am
 Just tilt my sun towards your domain.
 Your cup runneth over again.

 Don't scream about
 Don't think aloud
 Turn your head now baby
 Just spit me out
 Don't worry about
 Don't speak of doubt
 Turn your head now baby
 Just spit me out

 Why follow me to higher ground?
 Lost as you swear I am.
 Don't throw away your basic needs,
 Ambiance and vanity.

 December promise you gave unto me
 December whispers of treachery
 December clouds are now covering me
 December songs no longer I sing


 "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"
 by The Beatles

 Desmond has a barrow in the market place
 Molly is the singer in a band
 Desmond says to Molly-girl I like your face
 And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.

 Obladi oblada life goes on bra
 Lala how the life goes on
 Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
 Lala how the life goes on.

 Desmond takes a trolley to the jewellers stores
 Buys a twenty carat golden ring
 Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
 And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

 In a couple of years they have built
 A home sweet home
 With a couple of kids running in the yard
 Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

 Happy ever after in the market place
 Molly lets the children lend a hand
 Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
 And in the evening she's a singer with the band.

 Chorus:

 And if you want some fun-take Obladi Oblada.


 "Lucky Henry"
 by walter becker

 dusted down in shanty town behind a sky of red
 hoist upon some frozen dawn exploding in my head
 fast asleep in trouble deep or wide awake and burning
 stuck inside some stranger's hide whose karma keeps returning
 where you trail that holy grail of darkness and despair
 way cross town, now up, now down, as though you'd really care
 on the bus across from us seen once in silhouette
 the old man's face you couldn't place that now you can't forget
 
 down and dirty
 there you go
 lucky henry says hello
 burned his bridges high and low
 and down the road and gone
 it's raining boxcars did you know
 from county cook to baltimore
 where ever those old jockeys go
 to live out their lifelines
 
 burning down that two lane town the boys call hollywood
 kicked around now lost, now found, loast again for good
 badly priced or half erased, or lost in space and time
 and all because the last one was the disappearing kind
 
 now you tumble
 now you know
 lucky henry says hello
 scratched in verses high and low
 and down to hell and gone i'm told
 it's raining boxcars that's for sure
 from bakersfield to elsinore
 for all what i car anymore
 for now and forever, gone gone gone
 

 "One Caress"
 by Depeche Mode

 Well I'm down on my knees again
 And I pray to the only one
 Who has the strength
 To bear the pain
 To forgive all the things that I've done

 Oh Girl
 Lead me into your darkness
 When this world is trying it's hardest
 To leave me unimpressed
 Just one caress
 From you and I'm blessed

 When you think you've tried every road
 Every avenue
 Take one more look
 At what you found old
 And in it you'll find something new

 I'm shying from the light
 I always loved the night
 And now you offer me eternal darkness

 I have to believe that sin
 Can make a better man
 It's the mood that I am in
 That left us back where we began


 "Paid Programming"
 by that dog.

 Paid programming helps me sleep at night, tucked in bed so tight.
 Paid programming helps me sleep at night, cures me of my fright.
 
 I'd like to see Cher doing her hair on the air.
 And I'd like to see Richard Simmons dealing a meal and helping to heal.
 
 Paid programming helps me sleep at night, tucked in bed so tight.
 Paid programming helps me sleep at night, cures me of my fright.
 
 I'd like a Strawberry Whip De-lite to give me pleasant dreams at night.
 And I'd like to see the vaccuuming haircut machine going mainstream.

 Paid programming helps me sleep at night, tucked in bed so tight.
 Paid programming helps me sleep at night, cures me of my fright.


 "Brain Crack"
 by Tracy Bonham

 have you ever heard the sound
 of your head in the ground
 and you're afraid to say
 and it wont go away?

 that's the sound of your brain cracking
 that's the sound of your brain cracking
 that's the sound of your brain cracking
 that's the sound of your brain cracking


 "the ice maiden"
 by Prefab Sprout

 standing on the boulevard
 you wish to know my name
 i'm the ice maiden
 i think perhaps you like being unhappy
 i'm the ice maiden - the limit of your dreams
 arctic winds blow and still you believe
 love makes you one of the chosen
 die in the snow-- i'll never grieve
 so what if tomorrow you're frozen
 death is a small price for heaven
 
 welcome to the glow of high octane affairs
 esperanto style and blonde dishevelled hair
 subterranean streams, duckling you're a swan
 infinities of dreams, imploding into one
 
 all those nights i dreamt of you
 i wonder where they've gone
 you're the ice maiden
 
 standing on the boulevard
 i've always known your name
 you're the ice maiden
 let you and i grow frosty together
 you're the ice maiden--today you meet your match
 
 girl when i burn- hell nothing's the same
 i'll singe your pretty blonde lashes
 we're talking fire-- we're talking flame
 we're talking ice into ashes
 but death is a small price for heaven
 

 "Christmas at Ground Zero"
 by 'Weird Al' Yankovic

 It's Christmas at Ground Zero
 There's music in the air
 The sleigh bells are ringin' and the carollers are singin'
 While the air raid sirens blare
 
 It's Christmas at Ground Zero
 The button has been pressed
 The radio just let us know
 That "This is not a test..."
 
 Everywhere the atom bombs are droppin'
 It's the end of all humanity
 No more time for last minute shoppin'
 It's time to face your final destiny

 Well, it's Christmas at Ground Zero
 There's panic in the crowd
 We can dodge debris while we trim the tree
 Underneath a mushroom cloud

 You might hear some reindeer on your rooftop
 Or Jack Frost on your windowsill
 But if someone's climbin' down your chimney
 You better load your gun and shoot to kill

 Oh, it's Christmas at Ground Zero
 And if the radiation level's okay
 I'll go out with you and see the all new
 Mutations on New Year's Day

 It's Christmas at Ground Zero
 Just seconds left to go
 I'll duck and cover with my yuletide lover
 Underneath the mistletoe
 It's Christmas at Ground Zero
 Now the missles are on their way
 What a crazy fluke we're gonna get nuked
 On this jolly holiday
 What a crazy fluke we're gonna get nuked
 On this jolly holiday

 
 "Sometimes Salvation"
 by The Black Crowes

 To lessen my troubles
 I stopped hanging out with relatives
 And empty saviours like you
 I wish I had a nickel for every miracle
 That you easily tricked me into

 You can lead a horse to water
 But faith is another matter
 So don't you surrender
 Cause sometimes salvation
 In the eye of the storm

 I've no time for accusations
 Or conversations on all the bad, bad things you do.
 Just a note from your jailor
 Drugs and the relations
 To all the people around you

 You can lead a horse to water
 But faith is another matter
 So don't you surrender
 Cause sometimes salvation
 In the eye of the storm

 I've kept secret your superstitions
 And all its twisted wisdom
 That I fell into
 Sister can you try and find me?


 "Name"
 by Goo Goo Dolls 

 Even though the moment passed me by 
 I still can't turn away 
 I saw the dreams you never thought you'd lose 
 Tossed along the way 
 The letters that you never meant to send 
 Lost or thrown away 

 But now all your boyfriends, I never knew their names
 Who don't belong to no one, that's a shame
 You could hide beside me, maybe for awhile 
 And I won't tell no one your name 
 I won't tell them your name 

 Scars, the souveneirs she'd never lose
 The past is never far 
 Did you lose yorself somewhere out there? 
 Did you get to be a star? 
 Don't it make it sad to know that life is more than who we are 

 You grew up way too fast
 Now there' nothing to believe 
 The reruns all become our history 
 A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio 
 And I won't tell no one your name 
 I won't tell them your name 
 I won't tell them your name 
 I won't tell them your name 

 (Guitar instrumental)

 I think about you all the time
 But I don't need to sing 
 Slowly where you are, come back down 
 And I won't tell them your name... 


 "Chest Hair"
 by Spiderbait

 He used to live with a knife in the wall
 Blonde to the bone, liked to piss out the door
 Maidens of Eire licked his arse every day
 Thought he could talk, just had nothing to say

 Yeah!
 Yeah!
 
 He loved to say "Don't you know who you are?"
 Wrote poetry, Morrisey, Johnny Marr
 He tried to tell us all
 That we were going to fall
 If we didn't change our ways
 Tried to pretend it was all just a phase

 Yeah!
 Yeah!

 Then Kieran said to his face from a far
 Look at the circle on our calendar
 You know that that's the day
 When you'll be gone away
 We're kicking you right out of here
 So time to go, pack your bags, shed a tear

 Yeah! You're gone
 Yeah! You're gone
 Yeah! You're gone
 Yeah! You're gone

 
 "Ten Years Gone"
 by Led Zeppelin

 Then as it was, then again it will be
 Though the course may change sometimes
 Rivers always reach the sea

 Like stars of fortune
 Each has separate rays
 On the wings of maybe
 Down in birds of prey

 Kind of makes me feel sometimes
 I didn't have to grow
 But as the eagle leaves the nest
 He got so far to go

 Changes fill my time
 Baby, that's all right with me
 In the midst I think of you
 And how it used to be

 Did you ever really need somebody
 And really need 'em bad
 Did you ever really want somebody
 The best love you ever had
 Do you ever remember me, baby
 Did it feel so good
 'Cause it was just the first time
 And you knew you would

 Turn the eyes and I sparkle
 Senses growing keen
 Tasting love along the way
 See your feathers preen

 Kind of make you feel sometimes
 Didn't hard to grow
 We are eagles of one nest
 The nest is in our souls

 Vixen in my dreams with great surprise to me
 Never thought I'd see your face the way it used to be

 Oh darlin', oh darlin'

 (Repeat)

 I'm never gonna leave you, I'm never gonna leave you
 Ten years gone, holdin' on, ten years gone

 (Repeat)


 "Three Peaches"
 by Neutral Milk Hotel

 So wake up run your lips across your fingers till you find
 Some scent of yourself that you can hold up high
 To remind yourself that you didn't die
 On a day that was so crappy whole and happy you're alive

 You're in the bathroom carving holiday designs into yourself
 Hoping noone will find you but they found you
 And they took you
 And you somehow survived

 So wake up and if the holidays don't hollow out your eyes
 Then press yourself against whatever
 You find to be beautiful and trembling with life
 Because I'm so happy you didn't die


 "To Live Forever"
 by Dream Theater

 If I'd started from the top
 And worked my way down
 There'd be no reason
 To live forever
 To live forever

 The starvation has turned
 Me outside in
 And the wind has blown
 Me halfway across the world
 Across the world

 Why was I born
 In an age of distrust
 I'd offered some change
 For a photograph
 It will always stay the same

 [**A**]
 You will always be the same
 Until I saw the desire for revenge
 My heart never once went astray
 As long as I have to die in the attempt
 Then there is no reason
 To live forever
 I found you where

 They left you there
 A passing word that's gone forever
 And searching my memory for answers
 I saw the words of a letter you wrote
 She said 'You don't have to live forever,
 You don't want to live forever.'
 And everything's changing now,
 I don't want to live forever.

 [Alternate ending - (Live in Tokyo Home Video)]
 [Beginning at **A** above. ]

 It will always stay the same
 Always be the same
 Until I saw the desire for revenge
 My heart never once went astray
 As long as I have to die in the attempt
 Then there is no reason
 To live forever

 Until I saw the desire for revenge
 As long as I have to die in the attempt
 If I had to charge the attack
 Let me
 No reason
 No reason
 No reason
 No reason
 To Live Forever

 [Alternate ending - (Studio acoustic version - "Subconscious" CD)]
 [Recorded as James LaBrie's vocal audition in 1990. ]
 [Beginning at **A** above. ]

 It will always stay the same
 Always be the same
 Until I show desire for revenge
 My heart never once went astray
 As long as I have to die in the attempt
 Then there'd be no reason
 To live forever

 Until I show desire for revenge
 As long as I have to die in the attempt
 As long as I have to die in the attempt
 Then there'd be no reason
 No reason
 No reason
 To Live Forever
 To Live Forever

 'This just in from Baghdad... Seven patriot missiles have been spotted above
     Cuba.' 


 "On the Turning Away"
 by Pink Floyd

 On the turning away
 From the pale and downtrodden
 And the words they say
 Which we won't understand
 "Don't accept that what's happening
 Is just a case of others' suffering
 Or you'll find that you're joining in
 The turning away"
 
 It's a sin that somehow
 Light is changing to shadow
 And casting it's shroud
 Over all we have known
 Unaware how the ranks have grown
 Driven on by a heart of stone
 We could find that we're all alone
 In the dream of the proud
 
 On the wings of the night
 As the daytime is stirring
 Where the speechless unite
 In a silent accord
 Using words you will find are strange
 And mesmerized as they light the flame
 Feel the new wind of change
 On the wings of the night
 
 No more turning away
 From the weak and the weary
 No more turning away
 From the coldness inside
 Just a world that we all must share
 It's not enough just to stand and stare
 Is it only a dream that there'll be
 No more turning away?
 

 "Black Lodge"
 by Anthrax

 Worship the ground you barely walk on
 You give of yourself but your angels are gone
 
 Deny your body is screaming
 But your heart and you soul they're bleeding
 Just to fall asleep is a godsend
 Until your demons appear again
 
 I am a witness to your demise
 
 Your biggest secret is one you can't keep
 Lift up your head if you're only asleep
 
 You try to hold onto reason
 Why can't you see that you're leaving
 My love for you knows no distance
 But it can't fight your resistance
 
 I am a witness to your demise
 I am the one who saw through the lies
 
 Give me,
 The one thing you can't give
 Take me to
 The black lodge where you live
 Give me,
 The one thing you can't give
 Take me to
 The black lodge where you live

 Deny your body's screaming
 But your heart and your soul they're bleeding
 Just to fall asleep is a godsend
 Until your demons appear again

 I am a witness to your demise
 I am the one who saw through the lies
 
 My love has always been blind
 
 Give me,
 The one thing you can't give
 Take me to
 The black lodge where you live
 Give me,
 The one thing you can't give
 Take me to
 The black lodge where you live
 Where you live 


 "Little 15"
 by Depeche Mode

 Little fifteen
 You help her forget
 The world outside
 You're not part of it yet
 And if you could drive
 You could drive her away
 To a happier place
 To a happier day
 That exists in your mind
 And in your smile
 She could escape there
 Just for a while
 Little fifteen

 Little fifteen
 Why take the smooth with the rough
 When things run smooth
 It's already more than enough
 She knows your mind
 Is not yet in league
 With the rest of the world
 And its little intrigues
 Do you understand
 Do you know what she means
 As time goes by
 And when you've seen what she's seen... you will
 Little fifteen

 Little fifteen
 Why does she have to defend
 Her feelings inside
 Why pretend
 She's not had a life
 A life of near misses
 Now all that she wants
 Is three little wishes
 She wants to see with your eyes
 She wants to smile with your smile
 She wants a nice surprise
 Every once in a while

 She wants to see with your eyes
 She wants to smile with your smile
 She wants a nice surprise
 Every once in a while
 Little fifteen


 "Queer"
 by Garbage

 Hey boy, take a look at me 
 Let me dirty up your mind 
 I'll strip away your hard veneer 
 And see what I can find 
 
 The queerest of the queer 
 The strangest of the strange 
 The coldest of the cool 
 The lamest of the lame 
 The numbest of the dumb 
 I hate to see you here 
 You choke behind a smile 
 A fake behind the fear 
 The queerest of the queer 
 
 This is what he pays me for 
 I'll show you how it's done 
 You learn to love the pain you feel 
 Like father, like son 
 
 The queerest of the queer 
 Hide inside your head 
 The blindest of the blind 
 The deadest of the dead 
 You're hungry 'cause you starve 
 While holding back the tears 
 Choking on your smile 
 A fake behind the fear 
 The queerest of the queer 
 
 I know what's good for you (You can touch me if you want) 
 I know you're dying to (You can touch me if you want) 
 I know what's good for you (You can touch me if you want) 
 But you can't stop 
 
 The queerest of the queer
 The strangest of the strange 
 The coldest of the cool 
 The lamest of the lame 
 The numbest of the dumb 
 I hate to see you here 
 You choke behind a smile 
 A fake behind the fear 
 
 The queerest of the queer 
 The strangest of the strange 
 The coldest of the cool 
 You're nothing special here 
 A fake behind the fear 
 The queerest of the queer 
 
 I know what's good for you 
 I know you're dying to 
 I know what's good for you 
 I bet you're dying to 

 You can touch me if you want 
 You can touch me if you want 
 You can touch me 
 You can touch me 
 But you can't stop 


 "Black Friday"
 by Steely Dan

 When Black Friday comes
 I'll stand down by the door
 And catch the grey men when they
 Dive from the fourteenth floor
 When Black Friday comes
 I'll collect everything I'm owed
 And before my friends find out
 I'll be on the road
 When Black Friday falls you know it's got to be
 Don't let it fall on me
 When Black Friday comes
 I'll fly down to Muswellbrook
 Gonna strike all the big red words
 From my little black book
 Gonna do just what I please
 Gonna wear no socks and shoes
 With nothing to do but feed
 All the kangaroos
 When Black Friday comes I'll be on that hill
 You know I will
 
 When Black Friday comes
 I'm gonna dig myself a hole
 Gonna lay down in it 'til
 I satisfy my soul
 Gonna let the world pass by me
 The Archbishop's gonna sanctify me
 And if he don't come across
 I'm gonna let it roll
 When Black Friday comes
 I'm gonna stake my claim
 I'll guess I'll change my name
 

 "Thorn In My Pride"
 by The Black Crowes

 Wake me when the day breaks
 Show me how the sun shines
 Tell me about your hearaches
 Who could be so unkind?
 Do you dream to touch me?
 And smile down deep inside
 Or could you just kill me?
 It's hard to make up your mind, sometimes.

 My angels, my devils, my thorn in my pride.

 Are you wanting instiration
 You spill your secrets on me
 Then you tell me with a whisper
 Of things that will never be.
 Do you hear me breathing?
 Does it make you want to scream?
 Did you ever like a bad dream?
 Sometimes life is obscene.

 My angels, my devils, my thorn in my pride.

 Lover cover me with your sleep
 Let your love light shine
 Lover cover me with a good dream
 Let your love light shine


 "My Record Company"
 by K's Choice

 Beware, beware
 They're on their way
 They're getting closer every day
 But I'm prepared
 I'm sure some common sense will
 Blow them all away

 They like your band
 They shake your hand
 They smell like food that has gone bad
 Today it's you
 Today will pass
 I'm so sick of all this trash...

 (Don't take it personally, oh no...)
 (Don't take it personally, oh no...)
 (Don't take it personally, oh no...)
 (Don't take it personally, oh no...)

 And sometimes in the middle of
 The roaches' nest
 You find a little soul
 That understands the content of a song, so...

 (Don't take it personally, oh no...)
 (Don't take it personally, oh no...)
 (Don't take it personally, oh no...)
 (Don't take it personally, oh no...)
 (Oh no...)
 (Yeah...)


 "I Gotta Know"
 by Spiderbait

 I gotta know
 Tell me now
 I don't get it
 I wanna know

 Walking down the street from my pad
 I'm safe and sound in my head
 Keeping up a smile full of dread
 Everyone around me is dead

 I gotta know
 Tell me now
 I don't get it
 I wanna know
 
 Never thought I'd see what I saw
 People screaming something at the door
 I can hear it all breaking down
 Don't you even make a sound

 Yeeeaaaaahhhhhhh!
 
 
 "Dare To Be Stupid"
 by "Weird Al" Yankovic

 Put down that chain saw and listen to me.
 It's time for us to join in the fight.
 It's time to let your babies grow up to be cowboys.
 It's time to let the bedbugs bite.
 You better put all your eggs in one basket.
 You better count your chickens before they hatch.
 You better sell some wine before its time.
 You better find yourself an itch to scratch.

 You better squeeze all the Charmin you can,
 When Mr. Whipple's not around.
 Stick your head in the microwave, and get yourself a tan.
 Talk with your mouth full.
 Bite the hand that feeds you.
 Bite off more than you can chew.
 What can you do?
 Dare to be stupid.

 Take some wooden nickels.
 Look for Mr. Goodbar.
 Get your mojo working now.
 I'll show you how.
 You can dare to be stupid.
 
 You can turn the other cheek.
 You can just give up the ship.
 You can eat a bunch of sushi, then forget to leave a tip.
 Dare to be stupid.

 Come on and dare to be stupid.
 It's so easy to do.
 We're all waiting for you.
 Let's go!

 It's time to make a mountain out of a molehill.
 So can I have a volunteer?
 There's no more time for crying over spilled milk.
 Now it's time for crying in your beer.
 Settle down, raise a family, join the P.T.A.
 Buy some sensible shoes and a Chevrolet.
 Then party till you're broke, and they drag you away.
 It's okay... you can dare to be stupid.

 It's like spitting on a fish.
 It's like barking up a tree.
 It's like I said, you gotta buy one if you wanna get one free.
 Dare to be stupid.

 Yes.  Why don't you dare to be stupid.
 It's so easy, so easy to do.
 We're all waiting for you.
 Burn your candle at both ends.
 Look a gift horse in the mouth.
 Mashed potatoes can be your friends.

 You can be a coffee achiever.
 You can sit around the house
 And watch "Leave It To Beaver."
 The future's up to you.
 So what you gonna do?
 Dare to be stupid.
 Dare to be stupid.

 What did I say?
 (Dare to be stupid.)
 Tell me, what did I say?
 (Dare to be stupid.)
 It's all right.
 (Dare to be stupid.)
 We can be stupid all night.
 (Dare to be stupid.)
 Come on, join the crowd.
 (Dare to be stupid.)
 Shout it out loud.
 (Dare to be stupid.)
 I can't hear you.
 (Dare to be stupid.)
 Okay, I can hear you now.
 (Dare to be stupid.)
 

 "The Candy Man"
 by Sammy Davis, Jr.

 Candy Man, Hey Candy Man
 Everybody gather around and listen because, 
 I'm the Candy Man

 Who can take a sunrise, sprinkle it with dew
 Cover it with chocolate and a miracle or two
 The Candy Man, oh the Candy Man can
 The Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love 
 and makes the world taste good
  
 Who can take a rainbow, wrap it in the sky
 Soak it in the sun and make a groovy lemon pie
 The Candy Man, the Candy Man can
 The Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love 
 and makes the world taste good
  
 The Candy Man makes everything he bakes satisfying and delicious
 Now you talk about your childhood wishes, you can even eat the dishes
  
 Oh, who can take tomorrow, dip it in a dream
 Separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream
 The Candy Man, oh the Candy Man can
 The Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love 
 and makes the world taste good
  
 The Candy Man makes everything he bakes satisfying and delicious
 Talk about your childhood wishes, you can even eat the dishes
  
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 Who can take tomorrow, dip it in a dream
 Separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream
 The Candy Man, the Candy Man can
 The Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love 
 and makes the world taste good
 Yes, the Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love 
 and makes the world taste good
 a-Candy Man, a-Candy Man, a-Candy Man
 Candy Man, a-Candy Man, a-Candy Man
 Candy Man, a-Candy Man, a-Candy Man
  

 "Fearless"
 by Pink Floyd

 You say the hill's too steep to climb, climbing
 You say you'd like to see me try, climbing
 You pick the place and I'll choose the time
 And I'll climb the hill in my own way
 Just wait a while for the right day
 And as I rise above the tree-line and the clouds
 I look down hearing the sound
 of the things you've said today 
 Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd, smiling
 Merciless the magistrate turns round, frowning
 And who's the fool who wears the crown
 No doubt in your own way
 And every day is the right day
 And as you rise above the fear-lines in his brow
 You look down hear the sound of the faces in the crowd 
 
 
 Album: Awake
 by Dream Theater


 "6:00"

   "Six o'clock on a Christmas morning..."  [4 times]
   "And for what?"
   "Well, isn't it for the honor of God,  [Samples from the film "The Dead",]
    Aunt Kate?"                           [an adaptation of James Joyce's   ]
   "I know all about the honor of God,    [short story from his book        ]
    Mary Jane."                           ["Dubliners".                     ]

    Six o'clock the siren kicks him from a dream
    Tries to shake it off but it just won't stop
    Can't find the strength but he's got promises to keep
    And wood to chop before he sleeps

    I may never get over
    but never's better than now
    I've got bases to cover

    He's in the parking lot and he's just sitting in his car
    It's nine o'clock but he can't get out
    He lights a cigarette
    and turns the music down
    but just can't seem to shake that sound

    Once I thought I'd get over
    but it's too late for me now
    I've got bases to cover

    Melody walks through the door
    and memory flies out the window
    and nobody knows what they want
    'til they finally let it all go

    The pain inside
    coming outside

    So many ways to drown a man
    So many ways to drag him down
    Some are fast and some take years and years
    Can't hear what he's saying when he's talking in his sleep
    He finally found the sound but he's in too deep

    I could never get over
    Is it too late for me now?
    Feel like blowing my cover

    Melody walks through the door
    and memory flies out the window
    and nobody knows what they want
    'til they finally let it all go

    But don't cut your losses too soon
    'cause you'll only be cutting your throat
    And answer a call while you still hear at all
    'cause nobody will if you won't

   "Six o'clock on a Christmas morning..." [4 times]
   "I know all about the honor of God, 
    Mary..."                              [3 times]
   "I know all about the honor of God,    [Samples from the film "The Dead",]
    Mary Jane."                           [an adaptation of James Joyce's   ]

 "Caught In A Web"

    Silence disguised
    I watch you
    Show me the hurt
    that haunts you
    would you despise the thrill
    If all you hide were mine?

    I can't hold on any longer
    These feelings keep growing stronger
    Echoes that deafen the mind
    will bury my voice in their wake

    Caught in a Web
    Removed from the world
    Hanging on by a thread
    Spinning the lies
    devised in my head

    I've seen the path
    the one you take
    shows the truth
    for you to make
    This turn of phrase
    we might not see
    is the thirst of desire
    found so easily

    Try to push me 'round
    the world some more
    And make me live in fear
    I bare all that I am
    made of now
    Attractive I don't care
    'Cause even when I danced with life
    no one was there to share

    Does this voice the wounds of your soul?
    Does this voice the wounds of your soul?

    Caught in a Web
    Removed from the world
    Hanging on by a thread
    Spinning the lies
    devised in my head

    Tried to live the life
    you live and saw
    It doesn't work for me
    I bare all that I am
    made of now
    Attractive, I can't be
    Inside the Dance of Life is one
    I'll never hold to me

    You can't heal the wounds of my soul.
    You can't heal the wounds of my soul.

    Caught in a Web
    Removed from the world
    Hanging on by a thread
    Spinning the lies
    devised in my head

    Caught in a Web
    Refused by the world
    Hanging on by a thread
    Spinning a cage
    Denied and misread

  
 "Innocence Faded"

    Animation
    breathes a cloudless mind
    Fascination
    leaves the doubting blind
    Until the circle breaks and wisdom lies ahead
    the faithful live Awake
    the rest remain misled

    Some will transcend spinning years
    One as if time disappears

    Innocence faded
    the mirror falls behind you
    Trinity jaded
    I break down walls to find you

    Callow and vain
    fixed like a fossil, shrouding pain
    Passionless stage
    Distant like brothers
    Wearing apathetic displays
    Sharing flesh like envy in cages
    Condescending
    Not intending to end

    Some will transcend spinning years
    One as if time disappears

    Innocence faded
    the mirror falls behind you
    Trinity jaded
    I break down walls to find you

    Beginnings get complicated
    the farther we progress
    Opinions are calculated
    Immune to openness

    Beyond the circle's edge
    We're driven by her blessings
    Forever hesitating
    Caught beneath the wheel

    Innocence faded
    the mirror falls behind you
    Cynically jaded
    The child will crawl to find you.

  
 "Voices"

    'Love, just don't stare'
    He used to say to me
    every Sunday morning
    The spider in the window
    The angel in the pool
    The old man takes the poison
    Now the widow makes the rules

    'So speak, I'm right here'
    She used to say to me
    not a word, not a word
    Judas on the ceiling
    the Devil in my bed
    I guess Easter's never coming
    So I'll just wait inside my head

    Like a scream but sort of silent
    living off my nightmares

    Voices repeating me
       'Feeling threatened?
        We reflect your hopes and fears.'
    Voices discussing me
       'Others steal your thoughts
        they're not confined
        within your mind.'

    Thought disorder
    Dream control
    Now they read my mind on the radio
    But where was the Garden of Eden?

    I feel elated
    I feel depressed
    Sex is death, Death is sex
    Says it right here on my Crucifix

    Like a scream but sort of silent
    living off my nightmares

    Voices protecting me
       'Good behavior
        brings the Savior
        to his knees.'
    Voices rejecting me
      'Others steal your thoughts
       they're not confined
       to your own mind.'

   "I don't wanna be here, 'cause of my    [Dialogue by rap artist Prix-mo  ]
    suffering, 'cause of my illness.       [reading from the book "Cultural ]
    Only love is worth having, only        [Revolution".                    ] 
    love is what matters, loving every 
    people on equal terms. "
   "You've got to know who you're 
    dealin' with because, like a stranger, 
    a-heh, just might come in through
    here with a gun... and then, what 
    would you do? (Heh.)"
   "Everything is immaterial..."
   "'n' you know that reality is immaterial."
   "This is not reality..."
    
    I'm kneeling on the floor
    staring at the wall
    like the spider in the window
    I wish that I could speak
    Is there fantasy in refuge?
    God in politicians?
    Should I turn on my religion?
    These demons in my head tell me to

    I'm lying here in bed
    Swear my skin is inside out
    Just another Sunday morning

    Seen my diary on the newsstand
    Seems we've lost the truth to quicksand
    It's a shame no one is praying
    'Cause these voices in my head
    keep saying...

    'Love, just don't stare.'
    'Reveal the Word when you're
    supposed to'
    Withdrawn and introverted
    Infectiously perverted
    'Being laughed at and confused
    keeps us pleasantly amused
    enough to stay.'

    Maybe I'm just Cassandra fleeting
    Twentieth century Icon bleeding
    Willing to risk Salvation
    to escape from isolation

    I'm witness to redemption
    heard you speak but never listened
    Can you rid me of my secrets?
    Deliver us from Darkness?

    Voices repeating me
      'Feeling threatened?
      We reflect your hopes and fears.'
    Voices discussing me
    Don't expect your own Messiah
    This neverworld which you desire
    is only in your mind.

  
 "The Silent Man"

    A question well served,
    'Is silence like a fever?'
    'A voice never heard?'
    'Or a message with no receiver?'

    Pray they won't ask
    Behind the stained glass
    There's always one more mask

    Has man been a victim
    of his woman, of his father?
    if he elects not to bother,
    will he suffocate their faith?

    Desperate to fall
    Behind the Great Wall
    That separates us all

    When there is  reason
    Tonight I'm Awake
    when there's no answer
    Arrive the Silent Man

    If there is  balance
    tonight He's Awake
    If they have to suffer
    There lies the Silent Man

    Sin without deceivers
    A God with no believers
    I could sail by
    on the Winds of Silence
    And maybe they won't notice
    But this time I think
    It'd be better if I swim

    When there is  reason
    Tonight I'm Awake
    When there's no answer
    Arrive the Silent Man
    If there is balance
    Tonight he's Awake
    But if they have to suffer
    There lies the Silent Man

  
 "The Mirror"

    [Low spoken parts performed by Mike Portnoy]

    Temptation-
    Why won't you leave me alone?
    Lurking Every Corner, everywhere I go

    Self Control-
    Don't turn your back on me now
    When I need you the most

    Constant pressure tests my will
    My will or my won't
    My Self Control escapes from me still...

   "???"                                    [Sample from ???]

    Hypocrite-
    How could you be so cruel
    and expect my faith in return?

    Resistance-
    Is not as hard as it seems
    When you close the door

    I spent so long trusting in you
    I trust you forgot
    Just when I thought I believed in you...

   "What're you doing?                    [Sample is Meryl Streep from the  ]
    What're you doing?"                   [film "Falling In Love".          ]

    It's time for me to deal
    Becoming all too real
    living in fear-
    Why did you lie and pretend?
    This has come to an end
    I'll never trust you again
    It's time you made your amends
    Look in the mirror my friend

   "That I haven't behaved as I should"   [Sample is Jeremy Irons from the  ]
                                          [film "Damage".                   ]
   "Everything you need is around you.    [Sample is Mary Beth Hurt from the]
    The only danger is inside you."       [film "Light Sleeper".            ]
                                           
   "I thought you could control life,     [Sample is Jeremy Irons from the  ]
    but it's not like that. There are     [film "Damage".                   ]
    things you can't control."

    Let's stare the problem right in the eye
    It's plagued me from coast to coast
    Racing the clock to please everyone
    All but the one who matters the most

    Reflections of reality
    are slowly coming into view
    How in the hell could you possibly forgive me?
    After all the hell I put you through

    It's time for me to deal
    Becoming all too real
    living in fear-
    Why'd I betray my friend?
    Lying until the end
    Living life so pretend
    It's time to make my amends
    I'll never hurt you again

  
 "Lie" 

    Daybreak
    at the bottom of lake
    it's a hundred degrees I can't breathe
    And I won't get out
    'til I figure it out
    Though I'm weak like I can't believe
    So you tell me 'trust me' l can  trust you
    Just let me show you
    But I gotta work it out in a shadow of doubt
    'cause I don't know if I know you

    Doing fine but don't waste my time
    Tell me what it is you want to say
    You sin, you win, just let me in - hurry
    I've been out in the rain all day
    So you tell me 'trust me' I can trust you
    as far as I can throw you
    And I'm trying to get out of a shadow of doubt
    'cause I don't know if I know you

    [Chorus:]
      Don't tell me you wanted me
      Don't tell me you thought of me
      I won't, I swear I won't
      (Did)
      I'll try, I swear I'll try
      (Lie)

    Mother Mary quite contrary
    Kiss the boys and make them wary
    Things are getting just a little bit scary
    It's a wonder I can still breathe

    Never been much of a doubting Thomas
    but nothing breaks like a broken promise
    You tell me 'bout your two more coming
    but once is just enough for me

    [Chorus]

    I had gotten used to being a soul destroyed
    She comes in apparently to fill the void
    All dogs need a leash and
       at least I'll forget it
    And she would never hurt me though
       she's never said it
    But I'm not gonna ask her today
    I don't wanna scare her away
    Your town, I'm all alone
    and I just can't stare at the phone
    I wanna talk about lifelong mistakes
    and you can tell your stepfather I said so

    [Chorus]

  
 "Lifting Shadows Off A Dream"

    He seems alone and silent
    thoughts remain without an answer
    Afraid and uninvited
    he slowly drifts away

    Moved by desire and fear
    Breaking delicate wings

    Lifting shadows
    off a Dream once broken
    She can turn a drop of water
    Into an ocean

    As the rain is pouring down
    Tears of sorrow wash his mind
    Drifting with the current
    This stream of life flows on

    He seems alone and silent
    waiting on his hands and knees
    The chill of winter's darkness sits quietly

    Moved by desire and fear
    he takes a few steps away

    Lifting shadows
    off a Dream once broken
    She can turn a drop of water
    Into an ocean

    And she listens openly

    He pours his soul into the water
    reflecting the mystery
    She carries him away
    and the winds die slowly

    And she listens openly
    And she listens openly

    Lifting shadows
    off a Dream once broken
    She can turn a drop of water
    Into an ocean

    Lifting Shadows off a Dream
    Lifting Shadows off a Dream

 
 "Scarred"

    To Rise, To Fall.
    To Hurt, To Hate.
    To Want, To Wait.
    To Heal, To Save.

    Can't hear it
    we fear it
    awareness won't come near it

    Distractive
    Reactive
    Disguised in spite of time

    I never bared my emotion
    My passion always strong
    I never lost my devotion
    but somewhere fate went wrong

    Can't let them rape me again
    Your venom's not family here
    won't let them fill me with
    fatalistic remedies

    What if the rest of the world
    was hopelessly blinded by fear?
    Where would my sanctity live?
    Suddenly nobody cares.

    It's never enough
    You're wasting your time
    Isn't there something I could say?
    You don't understand
    You're closing me out
    How can we live our lives this way?

    You tell me I'm wrong
    I'm risking my life
    Still, I have nothing in return
    I show you my hands
    You don't see the scars
    Maybe you'll leave me here to burn.

    What if the rest of the world
    was hopelessly drowning in vain?
    Where would our self pity run?
    Suddenly everyone cares.

    Blood...Heal me
    Fear...Change me
    Belief will always save me
    Blood...Swearing
    Fear...Staring
    Conviction made aware

    Give up on misery
    Turn your back on dissent
    Leave their distrust behind
    Wash your hands of regret

    Do you feel you don't know me anymore?
    And do you feel I'm afraid of your love?
    And how come you don't want me asking?
    And how come my heart's not invited?
    You say you want everyone happy
    Well, we're not laughing.

    And how come you don't understand me?
    And how come I don't understand you?
    Thirty years say we're in this together
    So open your eyes.

    People in prayer for me
    everyone there for me
    Sometimes I feel I should face this alone
    My soul exposed
    It calms me to know that I won't

    Blood...Heal me
    Fear...Change me
    Belief will always save me
    Blood...Swearing
    Fear...Staring
    Conviction made aware

    Give up on misery
    Turn your back on dissent
    Leave their distrust behind
    Wash your hands of regret

    Blood...Heal me
    Fear...Change me
    Belief will always save me
    Blood...Swearing
    Fear...Staring
    Conviction made aware

    Learning from misery
    Staring back at dissent
    Leaving distrust behind
    I'm inspired and content

 
 "Space-Dye Vest"

    Falling through pages of Martens on angels
    Feeling my heart pull west
    I saw the future dressed as a stranger
    love in a space-dye vest

    Love is an act of blood and I'm bleeding
    a pool in the shape of a heart
    Beauty projection in the reflection
    Always the worst way to start

   "But he's the sort who can't know      [Sample is Julian Sands from the  ]
    anyone intimately, least of all a     [film "A Room With A View".       ]
    woman. He doesn't know what a woman
    is. He wants you for a possession, 
    something to look at like a painting or an ivory box. 
    Something to own and to display. He doesn't want you to be real, 
    or to think or to live. He doesn't love you, but I love you. 
    I want you to have your own thoughts and ideas and feelings, even when
    I hold you in my arms. It's our last chance... It's our last chance..."
    
    Now that you're gone I'm trying to take it
    Learning to swallow the rage
    Found a new girl I think we can make it
    as long as she stays on the page

    This is not how I want it to end
    And I'll never be open again

   "...I was gonna move out...ummm...get,   [Sample from "The Trouble With  ]

    but... I go into the mall where I       ["The Fifth Estate".            ]
    want to work and they tell me, I'm, 
    I was too young..."

   "Some people, gave advice before,        [Sample is Jim Hill from a news ]

    without a doubt, is his biggest 
    challenge ever. He's going to have to face it. 
    You're gonna have to try, he's gonna to have to try and, 
    uh, and, and, and get some help here. I mean no one can 
    say they know how he feels."

   "That, so they say that, in ya know      [Sample from the Conan O'Brien  ]
    like, Houston or something, you'd       [show.                          ]
    say it's a hundred and eighty degrees, 
    but it's a dry heat.
    In Houston they say that?
    Oh, maybe not. I'm all mixed up.
    Dry until they hit the swimming pool."

   "...I get up with the sun... Listen.     [Sample from "The Trouble With  ]
    You have your own room to sleep in,     [Evan", from the Canadian series]
    I don't care what you do. I don't       ["The Fifth Estate".            ]
    care when. That door gets locked, 
    that door gets locked at night by nine o'clock. 
    If you're not in this house by nine o'clock, then you'd better find some 
    place to sleep. Because you're not going to be a bum in this house. 
    Supper is ready..."

    There's no one to take my blame
    if they wanted to
    There's nothing to keep me sane
    and it's all the same to you
    There's nowhere to set my aim
    so I'm everywhere
    Never come near me again
    do you really think I need you

    I'll never be open again, I could never be open again.
    I'll never be open again, I could never be open again.

    And I'll smile and I'll learn to pretend
    And I'll never be open again
    And I'll have no more dreams to defend
    And I'll never be open again


 "Sweating Bullets"
 by Megadeth

 Hello me...Meet the real me.
 And my misfits way of life.
 A dark black past is my
 Most valued possession.
 Hindsight is always 20-20,
 But looking back it's still a bit fuzzy.
 Speak of mutually assured destruction?
 Nice story...Tell it to Reader's Digest!!!

 Chorus
 Feeling paranoid
 True enemy or false friend?
 Anxiety's attacking me, and
 My air is getting thin.
 I'm in trouble for the things
 I haven't got to yet.
 I'm chomping at the bit, and my
 Palms are getting wet,
 sweating bullets.

 Hello me...It's me again.
 You can subdue, but never tame me.
 It gives me a migraine headache
 Thinking down to your level.
 Yea, just keep on thinking it's my fault
 And stay an inch or two outta kicking distance.
 Mankind has got to know
 His limitations.

 Chorus
 Feeling claustrophobic,
 Like the walls are closing in.
 Blood stains on my hands and
 I don't know where I've been.
 I'm in trouble for the things
 I haven't got to yet.
 I'm sharpening the axe and my
 Palms are getting wet,
 sweating bullets.

 Well, me...it's nice talking to myself,
 A credit to dementia.
 Some day you too will know my pain,
 And smile its blacktooth grin.
 If the war inside my head
 Won't take a day off I'll be dead.
 My icy fingers claw your back,
 Here I come again.

 Chorus
 Feeling paranoid
 True enemy or false friend?
 Anxiety's attacking me
 And my air is getting thin
 Feeling claustrophobic,
 Like the walls are closing in.
 Blood stains on my hands and
 I don't know where I've been

 Once you committed me
 Now you've acquitted me
 Claiming validity
 For your stupidity
 I'm chomping at the bit
 I'm sharpening the axe
 Here I come again, whoa!
 Sweating bullets


 "Ride the Wind"
 by Poison

 Hearts of fire
 Streets of stone
 Modern warriors
 Saddle iron horses of chrome

 Taste the wild
 Lick the wind
 Like something they never saw before
 Their jaws dropping to the floor
 Steel made of soul and sin

 Rebels born without a care
 And the day he listens
 Only to fly where eagles dare
 And the night she whispers

 Chorus:
 Ride the wind
 Never coming back until I touch the midnight sun
 Ride the wind
 Never coming back again
 Ride the wind
 Never coming back until I touch the midnight sun

 Painted flesh
 Loyalty
 Humble pride
 Just as far as the eye can see

 Stories told
 Two old friends
 Of battle scars and lonely bars
 And nights the rain wouldn't end

 Here's to withered eyes wearing gypsy smiles
 And the day he listens
 Here's to lovely ladies and a million miles
 And the night she whispers

 Chorus

 Ride the wind
 I'm still the bravest soul in sin,
 Burning till the night is done.

 Solo

 Of all the truths and lies
 And stories of riders in the sky
 They say only the bravest try
 Where eagles and angels dare to fly

 Chorus


 "Red Barchetta"
 by Rush

 My uncle has a country place
 That no one knows about.
 He says it used to be a farm
 Before the Motor Law.
 And on Sundays I elude the Eyes,
 And hop the Turbine Freight
 To far outside the Wire
 Where my white-haired uncle waits.

 Jump to the ground
 As the Turbo slows to cross the borderline.
 Run like the wind
 As excitement shivers up and down my spine.
 Down in his barn
 My uncle preserved for me an old machine
 For fifty-odd years.
 To keep it as new has been his dearest dream.

 I strip away the old debris
 That hides a shining car:
 A brilliant red Barchetta
 From a better vanished time.
 I fire up the willing engine
 Responding with a roar.
 Tires spitting gravel,
 I commit my weekly crime.

 Wind
 In my hair
 Shifting and drifting
 Mechanical music
 Adrenaline surge...

 Well-weathered leather,
 Hot metal and oil,
 The scented country air.
 Sunlight on chrome,
 The blur of the landscape,
 Every nerve aware.

 Suddenly ahead of me
 Across the mountainside
 A gleaming alloy air-car
 Shoots towards me, two lanes wide.
 I spin around with shrieking tires
 To run the deadly race
 Go screaming through the valley
 As another joins the chase.

 Drive like the wind
 Straining the limits of machine and man.
 Laughing out loud with fear and hope
 I've got a desperate plan.
 At the one-lane bridge
 I leave the giants stranded at the riverside.
 Race back to the farm
 To dream with my uncle at the fireside.


 "Bonny"
 by Prefab Sprout

 I spend the days with my vanity
 I'm lost in heaven and I'm lost to earth
 Didn't give you minutes, not even moments
 All my life in a tower of foil
 Shaded feelings, don't believe you
 When you were there before my eyes
 No one planned it, took it for granted
 
 I count the hours since you slipped away
 I count the hours that I lie awake
 I count the minutes and the seconds too
 All I stole and I took from you
 But Bonny don't live at home, no Bonny don't live at home
 
 Words don't hold you, broken soldiers
  
 All my silence and my strained respect
 Missed chances and the same regrets
 Kiss the thief and you save the rest
 All my insights from retrospect
 
 I count the hours since you slipped away
 I count the hours that I lie awake
 I count the minutes and the seconds too
 All I stole and I took from you
 But Bonny don't live at home, no Bonny don't live at home
 
 (Save your speeches, flowers are for funerals)
 

 "C'Mon Billy"
 by PJ Harvey

 C'mon Billy 
 Come to me 
 You know I'm waiting 
 I love you endlessly 
 C'mon Billy 
 You're the only one 
 Don't you think it's time now you met your only son 
 I remember lover's play 
 The corn was gold and we lay in it for days 
 I remember the things you said 
 My little Billy come to your lover's bed 
 Come home is my plea
 Your home now is here with me 
 Come home to your son 
 Tomorrow might never come 

 C'mon Billy
 You look good to me 
 How many nites now 
 Your child inside 
 Oh, don't forget me 
 I had your son 
 Damn thing went crazy 
 But I swear you're the only one 

 Come along Billy come to me
 Come along Billy come to me 
 Come along Billy come to me 
 Come along Billy come to me 
 Come along Billy come to me 
 Come along Billy come to me 
 Come along Billy come to me 
 Come along now and come to me 


 "Low"
 by Testament

 Fuel the fire for war
 It's man against mankind
 Bruises that they bear
 Been beaten down with time

 Innocent people suffer the loss
 Your broken hope so close to the cross
 Sometimes you just don't know
 How low...how low you can, go...
 So low it's sickening
 Low...Low...show some mercy...

 Hey you piece of shit
 Just leave the kids alone
 Why can't you bear
 The things that we endure

 Innocent people suffer the loss
 Lost hope with faith to the cross
 Sometimes you just don't know
 How low...How low you can go
 Show some sympathy
 Low...low...show some mercy

 I don't like you for your warped demeted ways
 I hope they lock you down so you never get away
 Low...Low...show some sympathy
 Low...low...show some mercy...


 "Hot Water & Milk"
 by Spiderbait

 You're dumb but it's sweet
 I'd hate you smarter than me
 Can't you see?
 That's what begins the confusion
 
 You're just the perfect man
 No feet, no head, no hands
 Can't you see?
 That's where we'll end the confusion

 You've said it
 I've said it
 You've said it
 
 But I meant it
 You've said it
 I've said it
 You've said it
 But I dread it again

 We're from different worlds
 You're boys and I'm from girls
 Can't you see?
 That's what begins the confusion
 
 You think I love you
 But I know that isn't true
 Can't you see?
 There isn't any confusion
 
 You've said it
 I've said it
 You've said it
 But I meant it
 You've said it
 I've said it
 You've said it
 But I dread it again
 

 "Doctor Wu"
 by Steely Dan

 Katy tried
 I was halfway crucified
 I was on the other side
 Of no tomorrow
 You walked in
 And my life began again
 Just when I'd spent the last piaster
 I could borrow
 All night long
 We would sing that stupid song
 And every word we sang
 I knew was true
 Are you with me Doctor Wu
 Are you really just a shadow
 Of the man that I once knew
 Are you crazy are you high
 Or just an ordinary guy
 Have you done all you can do
 Are you with me Doctor
 
 Don't seem right
 I've been strung out here all night
 I've been waiting for the taste
 You said you'd bring to me
 Biscayne Bay
 Where the Cuban gentlemen sleep all day
 I went searching for the song
 You used to sing to me
 Katy lies
 You could see it in her eyes
 But imagine my surprise
 When I saw you
 
 Are you with me Doctor Wu
 Are you really just a shadow
 Of the man that I once knew
 She is lovely yes she's sly
 And you're an ordinary guy
 Has she finally got to you
 Can you hear me Doctor ?
 

 "Alive"
 by Pearl Jam

 "Call Any Vegetable"
 by Frank Zappa

 Call any vegetable
 Call it by name
 You gotta call one today
 When you get off the train

 Call any vegetable
 And the chances are good
 Ye-e-eah
 
 The vegetable will respond to you
 La-la-ah la-la
 
 The vegetable will respond to you
 La-la-ah la-la
 
 Oh...
 Call any vegetable
 Pick up your phone
 Think of a vegetable
 Lonely at home
 
 Call any vegetable
 And the chances are good
 Ye-e-eah
 
 The vegetable will respond to you
 La-la-ah la-la
 
 The vegetable will respond to you
 La-la-ah la-la
 
 Rutabaga, Rutabaga,
 Rutabaga, Rutabaga,
 Rutabay-y-y-y...

 No one will know
 If you don't want to let them know
 No one will know
 'Less it's you that might tell them so

 Call and they'll come to you
 Smiling and covered with dew
 Vegetables dream
 Vegetables dream
 Vegetables dream of responding to you

 Standing there shiny and proud by your side
 Holding your joint while the neighbours decide
 Why is a vegetable something to hide
 To hide
 To hide
 To hide
 
 FZ: You know... a lot of people don't bother about their friends in the 
     vegetable kingdom. They... they think: What can I say? Sometimes they
     think: Where can I go?

 HOWARD: At Ralph's vegetarian poodle clipping, where you can come this...
 MARK: Where can I go to get organic vaseline for my intercourse?
 HOWARD: At Bob and Ray's Swahili restaurant, where you can come this...

 HOWARD: Hey, De-due...

     concerned young person today... oh, but it's a great time to be alive, 
     ladies and gentlemen, and that's the theme of our program for tonight...

     tonight, boys and girls... and I wanna tell ya... if there's anybody

 "Blasphemous Rumours"
 by Depeche Mode

 Girl of sixteen, whole life ahead of her
 Slashed her wrists, bored with life
 Didn't succeed, thank the Lord
 For small mercies
 Fighting back the tears, mother reads the note again
 Sixteen candles burn in her mind
 She takes the blame, it's always the same
 She goes down on her knees and prays

 I don't want to start any blasphemous rumours
 But I think that God's got a sick sense of humor
 And when I die I expect to find Him laughing

 Girl of eighteen, fell in love with everything
 Found new life in Jesus Christ
 Hit by a car, ended up
 On a life support machine
 Summer's day, as she passed away
 Birds were singing in the summer sky
 Then came the rain, and once again
 A tear fell from her mother's eye

 I don't want to start any blasphemous rumours
 But I think that God's got a sick sense of humor
 And when I die I expect to find Him laughing

 Ssss....


 "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"
 by U2

 I have climbed highest mountain
 I have run through the fields
 Only to be with you
 Only to be with you
 I have run 
 I have crawled
 I have scaled these city walls
 These city walls
 Only to be with you

 But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
 But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

 I have kissed honey lips
 Felt the healing in her fingertips
 It burned like fire
 This burning desire
 I have spoke with the tongue of angels
 I have held the hand of a devil
 It was warm in the night
 I was cold as a stone

 But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
 But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

 I believe in the kingdom come
 Then all the colors will bleed into one
 Bleed into one
 Well yes I'm still running
 You broke the bonds and you
 Loosed the chains
 Carried the cross
 Of my shame
 Of my shame
 You know I believed it

 But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
 But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
 But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
 But I still haven't found what I'm looking for...


 "Carry That Weight"
 by The Beatles

 Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
 Carry that weight a long time
 Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
 Carry that weight a long time

 I never give you my pillow
 I only give you my invitations
 And in the middle of the celebrations
 I break down

 Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
 Carry that weight a long time
 Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
 Carry that weight a long time


 "Road to Nowhere"

 I was looking back on my life
 And all the things I've done to me
 I'm still looking for the answers
 I'm still searching for the key

 CHORUS
 The wreckage of my past keeps haunting me
 It just won't leave me alone
 I still find it all a mystery
 Could it be a dream?
 The road to nowhere leads to me

 Through all the happiness and sorrow
 I guess I'd do it all again
 Live for today and not tomorrow
 It's still the road that never ends

 CHORUS

 Ah ah
 The road to nowhere's gonna pass me by
 Ah ah
 I hope we never have to say goodbye
 I never want to live without you

 CHORUS


 "Big Love"
 by Fleetwood Mac

 Looking out for love
 In the night so still
 Oh I'll build you a kingdom
 In that house on the hill

 Looking out for love
 Big, big love

 You said that you love me
 And that you always will
 Oh you begged me to keep you
 In that house on the hill

 Looking out for love
 Big, big love

 I wake up alone
 With it all
 I wake up
 But only to fall

 Looking out for love
 Big, big love
 Just looking out for love
 Big, big love


 "LSD"
 by Hallucinogen

 I believe with the account of acid we discovered new ways to think, and, it
 has to do with piecing together new thoughts of mind. Why is it that people
 think it so evil? What is it about it that - that it scares people so deeply
 even without [knowing it i think it is] because they're afraid that there's
 more to reality than they have confronted. That there are doors that they're
 afraid to go in, and they don't want us to go in there either, because if we
 go in, we might learn something that they don't know, and that makes us a
 little out of their control.


 "April 8th"
 by Neutral Milk Hotel

 Crawl across towards your window
 I'm calling softly from the street
 Always a lonely widow
 Half awake and sleeping on my feet
 I'm of age but have no children
 No quarter phone booth calls to home
 Just late with television
 Inside my bedroom all alone
 
 There is no use in waiting
 Offer up your steps so I can climb
 Show me all your figure paintings
 Etched in the middle of the night
 Let me stretch upon your carpet
 Let me hear the rain tap on your street
 Knowing I am safe on the inside
 Blankets wrapped and drifting off to sleep


 "Fade To Black"
 by Metallica

 Life it seems, will fade away
 Drifting further everyday
 Getting lost within myself
 Nothing matters no one else

 I have lost the will to live
 Simply nothing more to give
 There is nothing more for me
 Need the end to set me free

 Things not what they used to be
 Missing one inside of me
 Deathly lost this can't be real

 Emptiness is filling me
 To the point of agony
 Growing darkes taking dawn
 I was me, but now he's gone

 No one but me can save myself,
 but it's too late

 Now I can think, think why
 I should even try
 Yesterday seems as though it never existed
 Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye


 "Never Let Me Down Again"
 by Depeche Mode

 I'm taking a ride
 With my best friend
 I hope he never lets me down again
 He knows where he's taking me
 Taking me where I want to be
 I'm taking a ride
 With my best friend

 We're flying high
 We're watching the world pass us by
 Never want to come down
 Never want to put my feet back down
 On the ground

 I'm taking a ride
 With my best friend
 I hope he never lets me down again
 Promises me I'm safe as houses
 As long as I remember who's wearing the trousers
 I hope he never lets me down again

 Never let me down

 See the stars, they're shining bright
 Everything's alright tonight


 Album: Master Of Reality
 by Black Sabbath


 "Sweet Leaf"

 ALRIGHT NOW!!
 Won't you listen?

 When I first met you, didn't realize
 I can't forget you, for your suprize
 you introduced me, to my mind
 And left me wanting, you and your kind
 Oh yeah!

 I love you, Oh you know it
 
 My life was empty forever on a down
 Until you took me, showed me around
 My life is free now, my life is clear
 I love you sweet leaf, though you can't hear
 Oh yeah!

 Come on now, try it out
 
 Straight people don't know, what your about
 They put you down and shut you out
 you gave to me a new belief
 and soon the world will love you sweet leaf
 Oh yeah baby!
 

 "After Forever"

 Have you ever thought about your soul - can it be saved?
 Or perhaps you think that when you're dead you just stay in your grave
 Is God just a thought within your head or is he a part of you?
 Is Christ just a name that you read in a book when you were in school?
 
 When you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your
     cool?
 Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope - do you think he's
     a fool?
 Well I have seen the truth, yes I've seen the light and I've changed my
     ways
 And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared at the end of our
     days

 Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say
 If they knew you believe in God above?
 They should realize before they criticize
 that God is the only way to love
 
 Is your mind so small that you have to fall
 In with the pack wherever they run
 Will you still sneer when death is near
 And say they may as well worship the sun?
 
 I think it was true it was people like you that crucified Christ
 I think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced
 Will you be so sure when your day is near, say you don't believe?
 You had the chance but you turned it down, now you can't retrieve
 
 Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead and gone
 Open your eyes, just realize that he's the one
 The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate
 Or will you still jeer at all you hear? Yes! I think it's too late.


 "Children of the Grave"

 Revolution in their minds - the children start to march
 Against the world in which they have to live
 and all the hate that's in their hearts
 They're tired of being pushed around
 and told just what to do
 They'll fight the world until they've won
 and love comes flowing through
 
 Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today
 Will the sun rise up tomorrow bringing peace in any way?
 Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?
 Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear?
 
 So you children of the world,
   listen to what I say
 If you want a better place to live in
   spread the words today
 Show the world that love is still alive
   you must be brave
 Or you children of today are
   Children of the Grave, Yeah!
 

 "Lord of this World"
 
 You're searching for your mind don't know where to start
 can't find the key to fit the lock on your heart
 you think you know but you are never quite sure
 your soul is ill but you will not find a cure.
 
 Your world was made for you by someone above
 but you chose evil ways instead of love.
 You made me master of the world where you exist
 the soul I took from you was not even missed.
 
 Lord of this world
 Evil possessor
 Lord of this world
 He's your confessor now!
 
 You think you're innocent you've nothing to fear
 You don't know me, you say, but isn't it clear?
 You turn to me in all your worldly greed and pride
 But will you turn to me when it's your turn to die
 

 "Solitude"

 My name it means nothing
 my fortune is less
 My future is shrouded in dark wilderness
 Sunshine is far away, clouds linger on
 Everything I possessed - Now they are gone
 They are gone
 They are gone
 
 Oh where can I go to and what can I do?
 Nothing can please me only thoughts are of you
 You just laughed when I begged you to stay
 I've not stopped crying since you went away
 
 The world is a lonely place - you're on your own
 Guess I will go home - sit down and moan.
 Crying and thinking is all that I do
 Memories I have remind me of you
 

 "Into the Void"

 Rocket engines burning fuel so fast
 Up into the night sky they blast
 Through the universe the engines whine
 Could it be the end of man and time
 Back on earth the flame of life burns low
 Everywhere is misery and woe
 Pollution kills the air, the land and sea
 Man prepares to meet his destiny
 
 Rocket engines burning fuel so fast
 Up into the night sky so vast
 Burning metal through the atmosphere
 Earth remains in worry, hate and fear
 With the hateful battles raging on
 rockets flying to the glowing sun
 Through the empires of eternal void
 Freedom from the final suicide
 
 Freedom fighters sent out to the sun
 escape from brainwashed minds and pollution.
 Leave the earth to all its sin and hate
 find another world where freedom waits.
 
 Past the stars in fields of ancient void
 Through the shields of darkness where they find
 Love upon a land a world unknown
 where the sons of freedom make their home
 Leave the earth to Satan and his slaves
 leave them to their future in the grave
 Make a home where love is there to stay
 Peace and happiness in everyday


 "The Message"
 by Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five

 It's like a jungle, sometimes it makes me wonder
 How I keep from goin' under
 It's like a jungle, sometimes it makes me wonder
 How I keep from goin' under

 Broken glass everywhere
 People pissin' on the stage, you know they just don't care
 I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
 Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
 Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
 Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
 I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far

`Cause the man with a tow truck repossessed my car
 Don't push me `cause I'm close to the edge
 I'm tryin' not to lose my head, huh, huh, huh, huh

 It's like a jungle, sometimes it makes me wonder
 How I keep from goin' under

 Standin' on the front stoop, hangin' out the window
 Watchin' all the cars go by, rollin' as the breezes blow
 A crazy lady livin' in a bag
 Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a f@# hag
 Such a nasty tango, skipped the life in Dango
 Was hooked on princes, seemed she lost her senses
 Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
 So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
 She went to the city and got Social Security
 She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

 Don't push me `cause I'm close to the edge
 I'm tryin' not to lose my head, huh, huh, huh, huh

 It's like a jungle, sometimes it makes me wonder
 How I keep from goin' under
 It's like a jungle, sometimes it makes me wonder
 How I keep from goin' under

 My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
 Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
 All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
 Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
 The bill collectors, they ring my phone
 And scare my wife when I'm not home
 Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
 I can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
 Neon King Kong, standin' on my back
 Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
 A midrange migraine cancered membrane
 Sometimes I think I'm going insane, I swear I might hijack a plane

 Don't push me `cause I'm close to the edge
 I'm tryin' not to lose my head

 It's like a jungle, sometimes it makes me wonder
 How I keep from goin' under

 My son said, "Daddy, I don't want to go to school
 `Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
 And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
 If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
 I'd dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
 Wear a shirt and tie, and run with the creeps"
 `Cause it's all about the money, ain't a damn thing funny
 You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
 They pushed that girl in front of the train
 Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
 Stabbed that man right in his heart
 Gave him a transmit for a brand new start
 I can't walk through the park `cause it's crazy after dark
 Keep my hand on my gun `cause they got me on the run
 I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
 Hittin' `em and sayin', "You want some more," livin' on a seesaw

 Don't push me `cause I'm close to the edge
 I'm tryin' not to lose my head, say what

 It's like a jungle, sometimes it makes me wonder
 How I keep from goin' under

 A child is born with no state of mind
 Blind to the ways of mankind
 God is smilin' on you, but he's frownin' too
 Because only God knows what you'll go through
 You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second rate
 And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
 The places you play and where you stay
 Looks like one great big alley way
 You'll admire all the number book takers
 Thugs, pimps and pushers, and the big money makers
 Drivin' big cars, spendin' 20s and 10s
 And you wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
 Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
 Pick-pocket, peddlers, even pan handlers
 You say, "I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool"
 But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
 Now you're unemployed, all non-void
 Walkin' `round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
 Turned Stick-Up Kid, but look what you done did
 Got sent up for a 8-year bid
 Now you're manhood is took, and you're a Maytag
 Spend the next two years as a undercover f@#
 Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
 Till one day you was found hung dead in the cell
 It's was plain to see that your life was lost
 You was cold and your body swung back and forth
 But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
 Of how you lived so fast and died so young

 So don't push me `cause I'm close to the edge
 I'm tryin' not to lose my head, huh, huh, huh, huh

 It's like a jungle, sometimes it makes me wonder
 How I keep from goin' under, huh, uh, huh, huh, huh, huh
 It's like a jungle, sometimes it makes me wonder
 How I keep from goin' under


 "Bela Lugosi's Dead"
 by Bauhaus

 White on white translucent black capes
 Back on the rack
 Bela Lugosi's dead
 The bats have left the bell tower
 The victims have been bled
 Red velvet lines the black box
 Bela Lugosi's dead
 Undead undead undead
 The virginal brides file past his tomb
 Strewn with time's dead flowers
 Bereft in deathly bloom
 Alone in a darkened room
 The count
 Bela Logosi's dead
 Undead undead undead


 "Mr. Roboto"
 by Styx

 Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto,
 Mata ah-oo hima de
 Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto,
 Himitsu wo shiri tai
 You're wondering who I am-machine or mannequin
 With parts made in Japan, I am the modren man

 I've got a secret I've been hiding under my skin
 My heart is human, my blood is boiling, my brain I.B.M.
 So if you see me acting strangely, don't be surprised
 I'm just a man who needed someone, and somewhere to hide
 To keep me alive-just keep me alive
 Somewhere to hide to keep me alive

 I'm not a robot without emotions-I'm not what you see
 I've come to help you with your problems, so we can be free
 I'm not a hero, I'm not a saviour, forget what you know
 I'm just a man whose circumstances went beyond his control
 Beyond my control-we all need control
 I need control-we all need control

 I am the modren man, who hides behind a mask
 So no one else can see my true identity

 Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto, domo...domo
 Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto, domo...domo
 Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto, domo...domo
 Thank you very much, Mr. Roboto
 For doing the jobs that nobody wants to
 And thank you very much, Mr. Roboto
 For helping me escape just when I needed to
 Thank you-thank you, thank you
 I want to thank you, please, thank you

 The problem's plain to see: too much technology
 Machines to save our lives. Machines dehumanize.

 The time has come aat last
 To throw away this mask
 So everyone caan see
 My true identity...
 I'm Kilroy! Kilroy! Kilroy! Kilroy!


 "Sweet Jane"
 by Cowboy Junkies

 Anyone who's ever had a heart
 Wouldn't turn around and break it
 and anyone who's ever played a part
 Wouldn't turn around and hate it
 Sweet Jane, sweet Jane
 Sweet, sweet Jane
 You're waiting for Jimmy down in the alley
 Waiting there for him to come back home
 Waiting down on the corner
 and thinking of ways to get back home
 Sweet Jane, sweet Jane
 Sweet, sweet Jane

 Anyone who's ever had a dream
 Anyone who's ever played a part
 Anyone who's ever been lonely
 and anyone who's ever split apart
 Sweet Jane, sweet Jane
 Sweet, sweet Jane

 Heavenly widened roses
 seem to whisper to me when you smile
 Heavenly widened roses
 seem to whisper to me when you smile

 La la la la, la la la, etc...

 Sweet Jane
 Sweet, sweet Jane


 "BUTTERFLY"
 by Weezer

 YESTERDAY I WENT OUTSIDE WITH MY MOMMA'S MASON JAR
 CAUGHT A LOVELY BUTTERLFY
 WHEN I WOKE UP TODAY AND LOOKEDI IN ON MY FAIRY PET
 SHE HAD WITHERED ALL AWAY
 NO MORE SIGHING IN HER BREAST
 I'M SORRY FOR WHAT I DID 
 I DID WHAT MY BODY TOLD ME TO
 I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO YOU HARM 
 BUT EVERYTIME I PIN DOWN WHAT I THINK I WANT
 IT SLIPS AWAY--THE GHOOOOST SLIPS AWAY
 I SMELL YOU ON MY HAND FOR DAYZ
 I CAN'T WASH AWAY YOUR SCENT
 IF I'M A DOG THEN YOU'RE A BITCH
 I GUESS YOU'RE AS REAL AS ME
 MAYBE I CAN LIVE WITH THAT???
 MAYBE I NEED PHANTASY???
 A LIFE OF CASHING BUTTERFLYS
 I'M SORRY FOR WHAT I DID
 I DID WHAT MY BODY TOLD ME TO
 I DIDN'T MEANT TO DO YOU HARM
 BUT EVERYTIME I PIN DOWN WHAT I THINK I WANT
 IT SLIPS AWAY--THE GHOOOOST SLIPS AWAY
 I TOLD YOU I WOULD RETURN
 WHEN THE ROBIN MAKES HER NEST
 BUT I AIN'T NEVER COMING BACK
 I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I'M SOOOOOOOOOORRY!!!!!
 

 "Only When I Lose Myself"
 by Depeche Mode

 It's only when I lose myself in someone else
 That I find myself
 I find myself

 Something beautiful is happening inside for me
 Something sensual, it's full of fire and mystery
 I feel hypnotised
 I feel paralysed
 I have found heaven

 There's a thousand reasons
 Why I shouldn't spend my time with you
 For every reason not to be here
 I can think of two
 To keep me hanging on
 Feeling nothing's wrong
 Inside your heaven

 It's only when I lose myself in someone else
 That I find myself
 I find myself

 I can feel the emptiness inside me
 Fade and disappear
 There's a feeling of contentment
 Now that you are here
 I feel satisfied
 I belong inside
 Your velvet heaven

 Did I need to sell my soul for pleasure like this
 Did I have to lose control to treasure your kiss
 Did I need to place my heart in the palm of your hand
 Before I could even start to understand

 It's only when I lose myself in someone else
 That I find myself
 I find myself


 "Something I Can Never Have"
 by Nine Inch Nails

 i still recall the taste of my tears.
 echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears.
 my favorite dreams of you still wash ashore.
 scraping through my head 'till i don't want to sleep anymore.

 Chorus:
 come on tell me.
 make this all go away.
 you make this all go away.
 i'm down to just to thing.
 and i'm starting to scare myself.
 make this all go away.
 you make this all go way.
 i just want something.
 i just want something i can never have

 you always were the one to show me how
 back then i couldn't do the things that i can do now.
 this is slowly take me apart.
 grey would be the color if i had a heart.

 i just want something i can never have.

 in this place it seems like such a same.
 though it all looks different now,
 i know it's still the same
 everywhere i look you're all i see.
 just a fading fucking reminder
 of who i used to be.

 Chorus

 i just want something.
 i just want something i can never have
 i just want something i can never have

 think i know what you meant.
 that night on my bed.
 still picking at this scab
 i wish you were dead.
 you sweet and perry ellis.
 just stains on my sheets.


 "I'm Not Amused"
 by Galactic Cowboys

 A cloak of mystery, a beating heart.
 He prays for sympathy, they do their part.

 Can't you see it's not amusing anymore.
 We're not amused by all the blood upon your floor
 It's going farther than it's ever been before.
 Oh, can't you see it's not amusing anymore!

 No look of innocence in deep blue eyes.
 So weathered through the years the young one cries.

 Can't you see it's not amusing anymore.
 We're not amused by all the blood upon your floor
 It's going farther than it's ever been before.
 Oh, can't you see it's not amusing anymore!

 A starry night in May.
 He slipped away.
 They find his shallow grave.
 Someone will pay.

 Can't you see it's not amusing anymore.
 We're not amused by all the blood upon your floor
 It's going farther than it's ever been before.
 Oh, can't you see it's not amusing anymore!


 "Don't Stand So Close To Me"
 by The Police

 Young teacher, the subject
 Of schoolgirl fantasy
 She wants him so badly
 Knows what she wants to be
 Inside her there's longing
 This girl's an open page
 Book marking - she's so close now
 This girl is half his age

 Don't stand, don't stand so
 Don't stand so close to me
 Don't stand, don't stand so
 Don't stand so close to me

 Her friends are so jealous
 You know how bad girls get
 Sometimes it's not so easy
 To be the teacher's pet
 Temptation, frustration
 So bad it makes him cry
 Wet bus stop, she's waiting
 His car is warm and dry

 Don't stand, don't stand so
 Don't stand so close to me
 Don't stand, don't stand so
 Don't stand so close to me

 Loose talk in the classroom
 To hurt they try and try
 Strong words in the staffroom
 The accusations fly
 It's no use, he sees her
 He starts to shake and cough
 Just like the old man in
 That book by Nabakov

 Don't stand, don't stand so
 Don't stand so close to me
 Don't stand, don't stand so
 Don't stand so close to me

 Don't stand, don't stand so
 Don't stand so close to me


 "What It Takes"
 by Aerosmith

 There goes my old girlfriend
 There's another diamond ring
 And a all those late night promises
 I guess they don't mean a thing
 So baby, what's the story
 Did you find another man
 Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made
 When you don't look back I guess
 The feelings start to fade away
 I used to feel your fire
 But now it's cold inside
 And you're back on the street
 Like you didn't miss a beat, yeah

 (Chorus)
 Tell me What It Takes to let you go
 Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
 Tell me how it is that you can sleep
 In the night, without thinkin' you lost
 Everything that was good in your life
 To the toss of a dice
 Tell me What It Takes to let you go Yeah,

 Girl, before I met you,
 I was F.I.N.E - fine
 But your love made me a prisoner
 yeah, my heart's been doing time
 You spent me up like money
 Then you hung me out to dry
 It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise
 'Cause you had me in deep
 With the devil in your eyes

 (Chorus)
 Guitar!

 Tell me that you're happy that you're on your own
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 Tell me that it's better when you're all alone
 Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch
 Tell me that my lovin' didn't mean that much
 Tell me you ain't dying
 When you're cryin' for me

 (Repeat Chorus)

 Tell me who's to blame for thinkin' twice
 'Cause i don't wanna burn in Paradise
 Oh, let it go, let it go...
 I don't wanna burn....


 "Bust a Move"
 by Young MC

 This here's a tale for all the fellas
 Try to do what those ladies tell us
 Get shot down cause you're over zealous
 Play hard to get an females get jealous
 Ok smartie, go to a party
 Girls are stancin the crowd is showin body
 A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
 But you're standin on the wall like you was Poindexter
 Next days function, high class luncheon
 Food is served and you're stone cold munchin'
 Music comes on, people start to dance
 But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants
 A girl starts walkin, guys start gawkin'
 Sits down next to you and starts talkin'
 Says she wanna dance cus she likes the groove
 So come on fatso and just bust a move

 You're on a mission and you're wishin'
 someone could cure you're lonely condition
 You're lookin for love in all the wrong places
 Not fine girls just ugly faces
 From frustration first inclination
 Is to become a monk and leave the situation
 But every dark tunnel has a lighter hope
 So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope
 New movie's showin... so you're goin
 Could care less about the five you're blowin
 Theatre gets dark just to start the show
 When you spot a fine woman sittin in the front row
 She's dressed in yellow, she says "Hello,
 Come sit next to me you fine fellow"
 You run over there without a second to loose
 And what comes next, hey bust a move

 If you want it baby you've got it (repeat)
 Just bust a move

 In the city ladies look pretty
 Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
 Try to tell a joke just to get some play
 Then you try to make a move and she says "no way"
 Girls a fakin' ... goodness sakin'
 They want a man who brings home the bacon
 Got no money and you got no car
 Then you got no woman and there you are
 Some girls are sophistic... materialistic
 Looking for a man makes them opportunistic
 They're lyin on the beach perpetratin a tan
 So that a brother with money can be their man
 So on the beach you're strollin'... real high-rollin'
 Everything you have is your's and not stolen
 A girl runs up with somethin to prove
 So don't just stand there, bust a move

 (break down)

 Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry
 In five days from now he's gonna marry
 He's hopin you can make it there if you can
 'Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man
 You say "neato"... check your libido
 And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
 The bride walks down just to start the wedding
 And there's one more girl you won't be getting
 So you start thinkin, then you start blinkin
 A bride maid looks and thinks that you're winkin
 She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back
 And now you're feelin really fine cus the girl is stacked
 Reception's jumpin, bass is pumpin
 Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin
 Says she wants to dance to a different groove
 Now you know what to do g, bust a move

 by Liz Phair


 "White Chocolate Space Egg"

 Orange and blue, green and pink
 I see you in everything...

 Don't need money, don't need wine
 I've got better ways to spend my time

 I'll see you around, every hollow has its favorite sound
 And my heart is holding on...

 Purple, yellow, reddish brown
 Once I felt you, I couldn't lay you down

 Don't be shy, baby, don't be careful with me
 Let it go, let it soak me down

 Every rock and tree and leaf abound with your face
 Your face, your face...

 Trace...

 Don't tell me I've been wrong...
 Don't tell me all the magic's gone?

 Every corner has its favorite clown
 I'll see you


 "Big Tall Man"

 I'm a big, tall man
 I cut the grass
 My left eye hurts
 I am waiting and reading parts
 I can be a complicated communicator

 Zeus and Athens
 Florida driveway
 Asphalt and tires
 Sand and the beach, rocker panel
 Headlights in the dark...
 I am drag racing

 Fog and the distance beyond it...
 Boats and the quiet morning noises...
 I'm walking the shoreline
 A beer and a cigarette...
 A bug with twitching antennae
 A button-up short sleeved shirt...

 Yes, I'm careening down!
 Winding the canyons, now!
 Yes, I am broadcasting myself!


 "Perfect World"

 What a pretty live you have
 Oh boy, it's a pretty life
 And I would need a map
 Just so I could navigate the back yard

 Home is very ordinary
 I know I was born to lead a double life

 And when I find it, I know I'll make sense of me

 I want to be cool, tall, vulnerable and luscious
 I would have it all if I'd only had this much
 No need for Lucifer to fall if he'd learn to keep his mouth shut
 I would be involved with you

 I know the girls
 That live inside your world
 Just sitting next to a mortal makes their skin crawl


 "Johnny Feelgood"

 Johnny feel good, Johnny right on
 Johnny miss you, Johnny light on

 Johnny makes me feel strangely good about myself

 Moderation is a memory
 Dive right in and let him send me

 I could take this in doses large enough to kill...

 I never met a man who was so pretty inside
 He's got diamonds on the bed of his thumbnails and I
 Never realized I was so dirty and dry
 Till he knocked me down, started dragging me around in the
 Back of his convertible car...

 And I liked it
 I liked it more and more
 Crimson and Clover, soon he's taken over all my senses

 He's got petals on the bed of his sweat sock drawer
 And who the fuck am I (?) to criticize him cause
 I really need him now, in fact
 I'm kinda freaking out
 And I'm wondering where the hell you all are...

 I've never met a man I was so crazy about
 It kinda has become an obsession to me

 I hate him all the time
 But I still get up
 When he knocks me down
 And he orders me around
 'Cause it loosens me up
 And I can't get enough
 And I'd pay to spend the nights with him
 Some more!


 "Polyester Bride"

 I was talking, not two days ago
 To a certain bartender I' lucky to know
 And I asked Henry, my bartending friend
 If I should bother dating unfamous men

 And Henry said, "You're lucky to even know me.
 You're lucky to be alive.
 You're lucky to be drinking here for free cause I'm a
 Sucker for your lucky, pretty eyes."

 And then he said, "Do you want to be a Polyester Bride?
 Or do you want to hang your head and die?
 Do you want to find alligator cowboy booths they just put on sale?
 Do you want to flap your wings and fly away from here?"

 I was sitting, not two days ago
 Feeling lonely 'cause I'm just feeling low
 And I asked Henry, my bartending friend
 Why it is that there are those kind of men

 "Princess, do you
 Really want to flap your wings and fly...
 Because you've got time."
 He keeps telling me, "You've got time."
 But I don't believe him
 "You've got time."
 I keep on pushing harder...
 I keep on pushing farther away
 But he keeps telling me, "Baby, baby, do you want to be a polyester bride?"
 "Do you want to flap your wings and fly away from here?"


 "Love is Nothing"

 You thought I was something from afar
 You thought I'd totally excite you

 I guess it's just another thing to stand up close and ignite you

 Love is nothing, nothing, nothing
 Like they say...
 You gotta pick up the little pieces every day

 You were telling me the friends we have in common...
 By the time I figured it out you were yawning

 Love is nothing, like they say

 You gotta get up and work the people everyday

 And I thought, "Who am I?"
 "Who's this guy?"
 "Would I lie
 To make the day blur into the night...?"


 "Baby Got Going"

 Baby got goin' on a southern train, you know
 Fired up the pistons driving below
 And the whole vibration, seat upholstery
 Silky underwear, oh conductor, let's roll!
 Baby got goin' but I can't complain, you know
 It knocks me out when she acts so strange, it's like a
 Big Mac truck cut across three lanes in my soul, conductor
 Let's throw some metal down, roll!

 Squeeze her knees underneath a book, you know
 A real good shakin' is all it took
 Cause my baby's hooked on me, and as you can see
 I'm wild about her!

 She gets mad when it goes too slow, so I'm beggin' you man
 Keep a shovelin' that coal and let's roll!
 Dinah, blow your horn!


 "Uncle Alvarez"

 There's a portrait of Uncle Alvarez
 Hanging in the hall
 Nobody wants to look at it
 But Uncle Alvarez sees us all

 Ho ho ho imaginary accomplishments
 Hey hey hey you visionary guy!
 You might even shake the hands of presidents
 Better send a postcard and keep the family quiet

 He's not really part Cherokee Indian
 He didn't fight in the Civil War
 He's just Eugene Isaac Alvarez
 We feel sorry for the wall

 And It's a long way down, you're hoping for a heart attack
 Running around, investing in this and that, and your
 Beautiful wife keeps your life on a shelf for you
 Safe in the bedroom where there's no dust or mildew and it's
 Hard to believe you were once a
 Beautiful dancer...

 Better just to shake it off
 As you write your resume
 Don't think of Uncle Alvarez
 And the price he had to pay!

 You might even shake the hands of presidents

 Better send some money to the Alma Matter


 "Only Son"

 All these babies are born
 To the wrong kind of people
 And I wish I had known
 I was not good enough
 I'm the worst kind of son
 Bringing shame to my family
 And I know I have worn
 My mother's heart out, believe me
 I saw it
 I saw it coming

 All these things I have done
 To my little little sister
 When I try to support her
 She don't believe
 Shy should she?
 I hurt her
 I mean I hurt her

 So goodbye, so long, I'm gone already
 I'm running out of time
 I'm losing my mind]
 Won't you come take me home?
 Won't somebody hold me?

 All these babies are born
 Like a field full of poppies
 Who's gonna know which are torn?
 I believe I'll soon leave the meadow
 I see my shadow

 I think I'm losing my soul...


 "Go on-Ahead"

 You go on ahead, honey
 You have a good time there
 You make me feel funny
 I'm no ordinary lover or friend

 I believe we have things to do
 I believe in myself and I believe in you
 I believe when I sleep you are near to me
 I believe when you sleep I am near to you

 You walk out of the room with your hands so deep in your pockets, I don't
 Recognize you
 You say you're a ghost in our house and I realize
 I do think I see through you

 It's a death in our love that has brought us here
 It's a birth that has changed our lives
 It's a place that I hope we'll be leaving soon
 And I fear for the year in his eyes

 And it goes around in circles: one night is lovely, the next is brutal
 And you and I are in way over our heads with this one, it's hard
 To admit it, but you hold me and I can't feel you
 We hurt but we smile
 I promise I'll make it back when the summer has warmed me awhile


 "Headache"

 I can see the Russian Army rolling through my head
 On one side of me lies the enemy, the other half is dead
 I've got diamonds and I've got pearls...
 And I said, "Hey mister, won't you come for me?"
 You can take me home, but I will never be your girl
 I won't let your mystery unfurl

 That's the whole thing about it...
 I'm so in love today
 I've been waiting at the bus stop
 Come my way?

 I'm a
 Psychosomatic sister
 Running around without a leash
 Snow is falling, January's all across the land
 I've got seven other men in the ditches behind me, and
 I'm think I'm the last survivor...


 "Ride"

 As I stumble into bed, I curse the devil in my head
 And if I die before I wake, I hope the lord won't hesitate
 To pluck my coffin from the ground
 He need not heed the neighbors now
 And throw me up for all to see, the flies of
 August swarming me...

 I get a ride. Right by your side
 Under your skin. I'm digging in

 Well I don't know, but I've been told
 The road to heaven is paved with gold
 And if I die before I wake, I need a ride
 From you

 Well sticks and stones can break my bones
 And boys can make me kick and moan
 But when I want it autodrive, I get a ride
 From you

 I get a ride   98.5   Positive T-cell   Regeneration
 Regeneration   Regeneration   Positive T-cell   Regeneration


 "What Makes You Happy"

 But don't worry, mom. I met him in a restaurant
 And all this time I've been getting to know him
 He's got an ex-wife in Pasadena, and sometimes she's a mess
 To deal with, but mostly we've been living here
 Uninjured...
 There's a silence, and she says,

 "Listen here young lady,
 All that matters is
 What makes you happy,
 but you leave this house knowing my opinion won't
 Make you love me if you don't care to."

 But mom, I'm sending you this photograph, I swear
 This one is going to last and all those other bastards
 Were only practice!
 I feel the sun on my back...
 I smell the earth in my skin...
 I see the sky above me like a full recovery...

 She said, "Listen here young lady,
 All that matters is what makes you happy,
 But you leave this house knowing my opinion
 It won't make a difference if you're not ready."


 "Fantasize"

 He's a friend of mine
 Kind of special guy
 He's a run-around

 Hey, you've got to hide your love away!
 I hear people are talking about us
 And I just have to say
 I lie awake every night
 Thinking about you. I fantasize...
 All around me people are changing

 He's a special guy
 Kind of sentimental inside

 I hear people are talking about us
 That's ok with me
 Get it easily inside...


 "Shitloads of Money"

 Louis is probably thirty years old but he looks like a solid 45
 Louis says he's got a headache
 I look in his eyes, and I believe him
 The big L.K.'s and the gangster disciples
 Louis can't think of who else could take over, but he just can't
 Get up in the morning
 A genuine face, braced for survival...

 It's nice to be liked
 But it's better by far to get paid
 I know that most of the friends that I have don't really see it
 That way
 But if you could give 'em each one wish
 How much do you wanna bet?
 They'd wish success for themselves and their friends and
 that would include lots of money

 Don't know how many times you were stuck in the morning
 You just could move, though your mother was calling
 You know what you need
 Is a Lotto revival
 A train flashes by and you're lost in a spiral...

 Take the train on up to the zoo, don't look back
 On what you've been through
 Cause everyone's got a Monday...
 It looks like shit and it must be America

 It burns so quick, then it must be America

 We all need a shitload of M-O-N-E-Y, money


 "Girls' Room"

 I'm sleeping in the girls' room
 I'm sleeping in the sky, I'm sleeping in the water

 I'm sleeping in the girls' room tonight

 Here comes Tiffany
 My best friend, Tiffany
 Wearing a size too small of sweater

 Me and Tiffany
 Dressing up pretty
 We love to ride, we love to canter

 My best friend Tiffany
 She is so popular
 We're going from site to site and pool to pool tonight

 And we hear Terry say that Tricia's ok
 But she ought to learn to shave her bikini line better
 And Tauren was born, like her mother in a storm
 And Tracey's been away forever...


 "Where Are You Now"
 by Dream Theater

 Carry it away
 Carry it away again
 Have nothing to say
 Nothing to say again

 No one needs to be alone
 Get my ego on the phone

 Walking again
 Walking again today
 Who will I drain?
 Who will I drain today?

 No one wants to see you drown
 And no one wants to be let down

 Sorry about your secret garden
 Is it too late to beg your pardon?
 Didn't expect your soul to harden
 Are you already gone?
 Too late...

 Where are you now?
 Blind and deaf
 No one's left to come around
 Where are you now?
 Lost out there
 Where eyes no longer stare

 You read the writing on the wall
 Will Jesus catch you when you fall?
 Heaven's filled with empty prayers
 Pray too hard and no one cares

 Sorry about your secret garden
 Is it too late to beg your pardon?
 Didn't expect your soul to harden
 Are you already gone?
 Too late...

 Where are you now?
 Blind and deaf
 No one's left to come around
 Where are you now?
 Lost out there
 Where eyes no longer stare

 So there you are
 Beyond the crowd
 What do you hear to talk so loud?
 Beneath the wall
 Is where you'll fall
 And wanting more
 And losing all
 (You're one step away)
 Losing all
 (You're one step away)
 Losing all

 I'm gonna comfort you
 I'm gonna comfort you
 I'm gonna comfort you
 I'm gonna comfort you
 Nothing's gonna
 No one's gonna comfort you

 Where are you now?
 Lost out there
 Where eyes no longer stare

 Where are you now?
 Lost out there
 Where eyes no longer stare

 Where are you now?
 Lost out there

 Where are you now?
 Lost out there


 "Buy Me A Pony"
 by Spiderbait

 Don't you wanna be
 A personality
 An ocean in the sea
 But you'll never make it
 If you can't shake it
 So don't mistake it
 Just try and fake it
 And I want you to know
 You don't have far to go
 So we'll use all your dough
 To buy new clothes
 And see what flows
 And powder your nose
 For those photos
 You're almost on your way
 To popularity
 And we'll teach you to play
 With icy stare
 And punk rock hair
 And beatnik flair
 We'll take you there
 
 'Coz there's nobody else like you
 And we sure care just what you're doing
 After we have gone our seperate ways
 
 So don't you want to be
 A big time entity
 Your place in history
 But don't be scared
 Of what we said
 'Coz there's no end
 To being your friend
 But wait out in the hall
 We've just received a call
 We'll have to dump you all
 But don't you try
 To pass us by
 'Coz we own you
 Until we're through
 
 And there's so many round like you
 And we don't care just what you're doing
 After we have gone our seperate ways
 

 "Fight For Your Right (To Party)"
 by The Beastie Boys

 You wake up late for school - man you don't wanna go
 You ask you mom, "Please?" - but she still says, "No!"
 You missed two classes - and no homework
 But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk

 (chorus)
 You gotta fight for your right to party

 You pop caught you smoking - and he said, "No way!"
 That hypocrite - smokes two packs a day
 Man, living at home is such a drag
 Now your mom threw away your best porno mag
 (Bust it!)

 (repeat chorus)

 Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
 I'll kick you out of my home is you don't cut that hair
 Your mom busted in and said, "What's that noise?"
 Aw, mom you're just jealous - it's the Beastie Boys!

 (repeat chorus twice)


 "Something"
 by The Beatles

 Something in the way she moves me
 Attracts me like no other lover
 Something in the way she moves me
 Don't wanna leave her now
 Don't wanna leave her now

 Something in the smile she knows
 That I don't need no other lover
 Something in her style that shows me
 Don't wanna leave her now
 Don't wanna leave her now

 You're asking me why love grows
 I don't know, I don't know
 You stick around, how it may show
 I don't know, I don't know

 Something in the way she knows
 And all I have to do is think of her
 Something in the things she shows me
 Don't wanna leave her now
 Don't wanna leave her now


 "Kid Charlemagne"
 by Steely Dan

 While the music played you worked by candlelight
 Those San Francisco nights
 You were the best in town
 Just by chance you crossed the diamond with the pearl
 You turned it on the world
 That's when you turned the world around
 Did you feel like Jesus
 Did you realize
 That you were a champion in their eyes
 On the hill the stuff was laced with kerosene
 But yours was kitchen clean
 Everyone stopped to stare at your technicolor motor home
 Every A-Frame had your number on the wall
 You must have had it all
 You'd go to L.A. on a dare
 And you'd go it alone
 Could you live forever
 Could you see the day
 Could you feel your whole world fall apart and fade away
 
 Get along, get along Kid Charlemagne
 Get along Kid Charlemagne
 
 Now your patrons have all left you in the red
 Your low rent friends are dead
 This life can be very strange
 All those dayglow freaks who used to paint the face
 They've joined the human race
 Some things will never change
 Son you were mistaken
 You are obsolete
 Look at all the white men on the street
 
 Clean this mess up else we'll all end up in jail
 Those test tubes and the scale
 Just get them all out of here
 Is there gas in the car
 Yes, there's gas in the car
 I think the people down the hall
 Know who you are
 
 Careful what you carry
 'Cause the man is wise
 You are still an outlaw in their eyes
 

 "Sam Gribbles"
 by Spiderbait

 Touch me up I'll burn your house down
 So remember this time again
 Out of breath - asphyxiation
 Thought I'd choke down in the ocean
 Now I'm busting up in my mind
 So remember this place again
 Trust my instincts now that I'm slow
 I forgot that there was time to go
 Knowing I'm aware
 Feeling all right
 Now I gotta say
 
 Touch me up I'll burn your house down
 So remember this time again
 Out of breath - asphyxiation
 Thought I'd choke down in the ocean
 Now I'm busting up in my mind
 So remember this place again
 Trust my instincts now that I'm slow
 I forgot that there was time to go
 

 "Girl From Mars"
 by Ash

 Do you remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars?
 I don't know if you knew that.
 Oh we'd stay up late playing cards,
 Henri Winterman Cigars.
 Though she never told me her name,
 I still love you, Girl From Mars.

 Sitting in our dreamy days by the water's edge,
 On a cool summer's night.
 Fireflies and the stars in the sky,
 Gentle glowing light,
 From your cigarette.

 The breeze blowing softly on my face,
 Reminds me of something else.
 Something that in my memory has been replaced,
 Suddenly it all comes back.

 And as I look to the stars.
 I remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars,
 I don't know if you knew that.
 Oh we'd stay up late playing cards,
 Henri Winterman Cigars.
 Though she never told me her name,
 I still love you, Girl From Mars.

 Surging through the darkness over the moonlight strand,
 Electricity in the air.
 Twisting all through the night on the terrace,
 Now that summer's here.
 I know you are almost in love with me,
 I can see it in your eyes.
 Strange light shimmering over the sea tonight,
 And it almost blows my mind

 And as I look to the stars
 I remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars,
 I don't know if you knew that.
 Oh we'd stay up late playing cards,
 Henri Winterman Cigars.
 Though she never told me her name,
 I still love you, Girl From Mars.

 Today I sleep in the chair by the window,
 It felt as if you'd returned.
 I thought that you were standing over me,
 When I woke there was no-one there.
 I still love you,
 Girl From.....Mars

 Do you remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars?
 I don't know if you knew that.
 Oh we'd stay up late playing cards,
 Henri Winterman Cigars.
 Though she never told me her name.

 Do you remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars?
 I don't know if you knew that.
 Oh we'd stay up late playing cards.
 Henri Winterman Cigars.
 And I still dream of you,
 I still love you,
 Girl From Mars.


 "Plush"
 by Stone Temple Pilots

 And I feel that time's a wasted go
 So where ya going to tomorrow?
 And I see that these are lies to come
 Would you even care?

 And I feel it
 And I feel it
 
 Where ya going for tommorrow?
 Where ya going with that mask I found?
 And I feel, and I feel
 When the dogs begin to smell her
 Will she smell alone?
 
 And I feel, so much depends on the weather
 So is it raining in your bedroom?
 And I see, that these are the eyes of disarray
 Would you even care?
 
 And I feel it
 And she feels it
 
 Where ya going to tomorrow?
 Where ya going with that mask I found?
 And I feel, and I feel
 When the dogs begin to smell her
 Will she smell alone?
 
 When the dogs do find her
 Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
 To find it, to find it, to find it
 When the dogs do find her
 Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
 To find it, to find it, to find it
 
 Where ya going for tomorrow?
 Where ya going with that mask I found?
 And I feel, and I feel
 When the dogs begin to smell her
 Will she smell alone?
 
 When the dogs do find her
 Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
 To find it, to find it, to find it
 When the dogs do find her
 Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
 To find it, to find it, to find it
 To find it
 To find it
 To find it
 

 "Eleanor Rigby"
 by The Beatles

 Ah, look at all the lonely people
 Ah, look at all the lonely people

 Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
 Lives in a dream
 Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
 Who is it for?

 All the lonely people
 Where do they all come from?
 All the lonely people
 Where do they all belong?

 Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
 No one comes near.
 Look at him working.
 Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
 What does he care?

 All the lonely people
 Where do they all come from?
 All the lonely people
 Where do they all belong?

 Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
 Nobody came
 Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
 No one was saved

 All the lonely people
 Where do they all come from?
 All the lonely people
 Where do they all belong?


 "Communist Daughter"
 by Neutral Milk Hotel

 Sweet communist
 The communist daughter
 Standing on the sea-weed water
 Semen stains the mountain tops
 With cocoa leaves along the border
 Sweetness sings from every corner
 Cars careening from the clouds
 The bridges burst and twist around
 And wanting something warm and moving
 Bends towards herself the soothing
 Proves that she must still exist
 She moves herself about her fist
 Sweet communist
 The communist daughter
 Standing on the sea-weed water
 Semen stains the mountain tops


 "Ordinary World"
 by Duran Duran

 Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue
 Thought I heard you talking softly.
 I turned on the lights, the TV and the radio
 Still I can't escape the ghost of you

 What has happened to it all?
 Crazy, some'd say,
 Where is the life that I recognize?
 Gone away...

 But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world,
 Somehow I have to find.
 And as I try to make my way, to the ordinary world...
 I will learn to survive.

 Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
 "Pride will tear us both apart"
 Well now pride's gone out the window cross the rooftops, run away,
 Left me in the vacuum of my heart.

 What is happening to me?
 Crazy, some'd say,
 Where is my friend when I need you most?
 Gone away...

 (chorus)

 Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
 Here today, forgot tomorrow
 Ooh, here besides the news of holy war and holy need
 Ours is just a little sorrowed talk
 (Just blown away...)

 And I don't...

 (chorus)

 Every world, is my world...
 (I will learn to survive)
 Any world, is my world ...
 (I will learn to survive)
 Any world, is my world...
 Every world is my world...


 "Never Tear Us Apart"
 by INXS

 Don't ask me
 What you know is true
 Don't have to tell you
 I love your precious heart

 I, I was standing
 You were there
 Two worlds collided
 And they could never tear us apart

 We could live
 For a thousand years
 But if I hurt you
 I'd make wine from your tears
 I told you
 That we could fly
 'Cause we all have wings
 But some of us don't know why

 I, I was standing
 You were there
 Two worlds collided
 And they could never ever tear us apart


 "Friends"
 by Led Zeppelin

 Bright light almost blinding,
 Black night still there shining,
 I can't stop, keep on climbing,
 Looking for what I knew.

 Had a friend, she once told me,
 "You got a friend, you ain't lonely,"
 Now she's gone and left me only
 Looking for what I knew.

 Mmm, I'm telling you now,
 The greatest thing you ever can do now,
 Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now,
 It's very easy just.

 Met a man on the roadside crying,
 Without a friend, there's no denying,
 You're incomplete, they'll be no finding
 Looking for what you knew.

 So anytime somebody needs you,
 Don't let them down, altho' it grieves you,
 Some day you'll need someone like they do,
 Looking for what you knew.


 "Trackstar"
 by Shudder to Think

 Do you love him?
 Who knows
 Why
 Got no time for bad black jokes
 You
 Goodbye

     you all the time and it gets me down to the future I can't imagine a
     worse fate we did some damage on your truck and it drags me down I think
     about it everywhere


 "Something To Believe In"
 by Poison

 Will I see him on the TV
 Preachin' 'bout the promised land
 He tells me to believe in Jesus
 And steals the money from my hand

 Some say he was a good man
 But Lord I think he sinned, yeah

 Twenty-two years of mental tears
 Cries a suicidal Vietnam vet
 Who fought a losing war on a foreign shore
 To find his country didn't want him back

 Their bullets took his best friend in Saigon
 Our lawyers took his wife and kids, no regrets
 In a time I don't remember
 In a war he can't forget

 He cried "Forgive me for what I've done there
 Cause I never meant the things I did"

 Chorus:
 And give me something to believe in
 If there's a Lord above
 And give me something to believe in
 Oh, Lord arise

 My best friend died a lonely man
 In some Palm Springs hotel room
 I got the call last Christmas Eve
 And they told me the news

 I tried all night not to break down and cry
 As the tears rolled down my face
 I felt so cold and empty
 Like a lost soul out of place

 And the mirror, mirror on the wall
 Sees my smile it fades again

 Chorus

 Sometimes I wish to God I didn't know now
 The things I didn't know then
 Road you gotta take me home

 Solo

 I drive by the homeless sleeping on a cold dark street
 Like bodies in an open grave
 Underneath the broken old neon sign
 That used to read JESUS SAVES

 A mile away live the rich folks
 And I see how they're living it up
 While the poor they eat from hand to mouth
 The rich is drinkin' from a golden cup

 And it just makes me wonder
 Why so many lose, so few win

 Chorus

 You take the high road
 And I'll take the low road

 Sometimes I wish to God I didn't know now
 The things I didn't know then

 And give me something to believe in


 "Dreams"
 by Fleetwood Mac

 Now here you go again
 You say you want your freedom
 Well who am I to keep you down
 It's only right that you should
 Play the way you feel it
 But listen carefully to the sound
 Of your loneliness
 Like a heartbeat.. drives you mad
 In the stillness of remembering what you had
 And what you lost...
 And what you had...
 And what you lost

 Thunder only happens when it's raining
 Players only love you when they're playing
 Say... Women... they will come and they will go
 When the rain washes you clean... you'll know

 Now here I go again,
 I see the crystal visions
 I keep my visions to myself
 It's only me
 Who wants to wrap around your dreams and...
 Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
 Dreams of loneliness...
 Like a heartbeat... drives you mad...
 In the stillness of remembering what you had...
 And what you lost...
 And what you had...
 And what you lost

 Thunder only happens when it's raining
 Players only love you when they're playing
 Say... Women... they will come and they will go
 When the rain washes you clean... you'll know 


 Album: Wish You Were Here
 by Pink Floyd


 "Shine On You Crazy Diamond (1-5)"

 Remember when you were young, 
 You shone like the sun. 
 Shine on you crazy diamond. 
 Now there's a look in your eyes, 
 Like black holes in the sky. 
 Shine on you crazy diamond. 
 You were caught on the crossfire 
 Of childhood and stardom, 
 Blown on the steel breeze. 
 Come on you target for faraway laughter, 
 Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine! 
 
 You reached for the secret too soon, 
 You cried for the moon. 
 Shine on you crazy diamond. 
 Threatened by shadows at night, 
 And exposed in the light. 
 Shine on you crazy diamond. 
 Well you wore out your welcome 
 With random precision, 
 Rode on the steel breeze. 
 Come on you raver, you seer of visions, 
 Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine! 
 

 "Welcome to the Machine"

 Welcome my son, welcome to the machine. 
 Where have you been? 
 It's alright we know where you've been. 
 You've been in the pipeline, filling in time, 
 Provided with toys and 'Scouting for Boys'. 
 You brought a guitar to punish your ma, 
 And you didn't like school, and you 
 know you're nobody's fool, 
 So welcome to the machine. 

 Welcome my son, welcome to the machine. 
 What did you dream? 
 It's alright we told you what to dream. 
 You dreamed of a big star, 
 He played a mean gituar, 
 He always ate in the Steak Bar. 
 He loved to drive in his Jaguar. 
 So welcome to the Machine. 
 

 "Have a Cigar"

 Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar. 
 You're gonna go far, fly high, 
 You're never gonna die, 
 You're gonna make it if you try; 
 They're gonna love you. 
 Well I've always had a deep respect, 
 And I mean that most sincerely. 
 The band is just fantastic, 
 that is really what I think. 
 Oh by the way, which one's Pink? 
 And did we tell you the name of the game, boy, 
 We call it Riding the Gravy Train. 
 
 We're just knocked out. 
 We heard about the sell out. 
 You gotta get an album out. 
 You owe it to the people. 
 We're so happy we can hardly count. 
 Everybody else is just green, 
 Have you seen the chart? 
 It's a helluva start, 
 It could be made into a monster 
 If we all pull together as a team. 
 And did we tell you the name of the game, boy, 
 We call it Riding the Gravy Train. 
 
 
 "Wish You Were Here"

 So, so you think you can tell 
 Heaven from Hell, 
 Blue skys from pain. 
 Can you tell a green field 
 From a cold steel rail? 
 A smile from a veil? 
 Do you think you can tell? 
 
 And did they get you to trade 
 Your heros for ghosts? 
 Hot ashes for trees? 
 Hot air for a cool breeze? 
 Cold comfort for change? 
 And did you exchange 
 A walk on part in the war 
 For a lead role in a cage? 
 
 How I wish, how I wish you were here. 
 We're just two lost souls 
 Swimming in a fish bowl, 
 Year after year, 
 Running over the same old ground. 
 What have we found? 
 The same old fears. 
 Wish you were here. 


 "Shine On You Crazy Diamond (6-9)"

 Nobody knows where you are, 
 How near or how far. 
 Shine on you crazy diamond.
 Pile on many more layers 
 And I'll be joining you there. 
 Shine on you crazy diamond. 
 And we'll bask in the shadow 
 Of yesterday's triumph, 
 And sail on the steel breeze.
 Come on you boy child, 
 You winner and loser, 
 Come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shine!
 
 
 "Moving the River"
 by Prefab Sprout

 You surely are a truly gifted kid
 But you're only good as
 The last great thing you did
 And where've you been since then
 Did the schedule get you down
 I hear you've got a new girlfriend
 How's the wife taking it ?
 
 If it's uphill all the way
 you should be used to it by now
 You must know me, Father it's your son
 And I know that you are proud
 of everything I've done
 But it's the wonders I perform,
 Pulling rabbits out of hats
 When sometimes I'd prefer
 Simply to wear them
 
 If it's uphill all the way
 you should be used to it and say
 My back is broad enough sir
 to take the strain and it's
 Hello mother, it's your son
 and aren't you proud, of all I've done
 But I'm turkey hungry,
 I'm chicken free,
 and I can't breakdance on your knee
 
 But it's "stay right there son, baby do",
 while I am itching for something new
 So watch me hawkeye and understand
 the force of will, the sleight of hand
 Moving the river,
 I'm turkey hungry,
 I'm chicken free
 and I can't breakdance on your knee
 
 Moving the river, bucket by spoon,
 and do you think that they'll like me
 when they learn what I do?
 Moving the river, money for jam,
 and it takes such an effort
 to stay where I am...
 
 moving the river..

 by Spiderbait

 Sunshine
 On my window
 Makes me happy
 Like I should be

 Outside
 All around me
 Really sleazy
 Then it hits me

 Don't tell me
 You can't see
 What it means to me

 Meanwhile
 In the moonlight
 Purple people
 Unforseeable

 Lonely
 As they may be
 They'll be peachy
 Then it hits me

 Don't tell me
 You can't see
 What it means to me
 Me me me

 Sunshine
 On my window
 Makes me happy

 "She Said She Said"
 by The Beatles

 She said I know what it's like to be dead
 I know what it is to be sad
 And she's making me feel like I've never been born.

 I said "Who put all those things in your hair
 Things that make me feel that I'm mad
 And you're making me feel like I've never been born."

 She said "you don't understand what I said"
 I said "No, no, no, you're wrong"
 When I was a boy everything was right
 Everything was right

 I said "Even though you know what you know
 I know that I'm ready to leave
 'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born."

 She said "you don't understand what I said"
 I said "No, no, no, you're wrong"
 When I was a boy everything was right
 Everything was right

 I said "Even though you know what you know
 I know that I'm ready to leave
 'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born."

 She said I know what it's like to be dead
 I know what it is to be sad...


 "Believe"
 by Lenny Kravitz

 I am you and you are me
 Why's that such a mystery?
 If you want it you got to believe

 Who are we?
 We're who we are
 Riding on this great big star
 We've got to stand up if we're gonna be free yeah

 If you want it you got it
 You just got to believe
 Believe in yourself
 'Cause it's all just a game
 We just want to be loved

 The Son of God is in our face
 Offering us eternal grace
 If you want it you've got to believe

 'Cause being free is a state of mind
 We'll one day leave this all behind
 Just put your faith in God
 And one day you'll see it

 If you want it you got it
 You just got to believe
 Believe in yourself
 'Cause it's all just a game
 We just want to be loved

 The future's in our present hands
 Let's reach right in
 Let's understand
 If you want it you've got to believe yeah

 If you want it you got it
 You just got to believe
 Believe in yourself yeah

 If you want it you got it
 You just got to believe
 Believe in yourself yeah
 'Cause it's all just a game
 We just want to be loved


 "The World I Know"
 by Collective Soul

 Has our conscience shown?
 Has the sweet breeze blown?
 Has all the kindness gone?
 Hope still lingers on.

 I drink myself of newfound pity
 Sitting alone in New York City
 And I don't know why.

 Are we listening
 To hymns of offering?
 Have we eyes to see
 That love is gathering?

 All the words that I've been reading
 Have now started the act of bleeding
 Into one.

 So I walk up on high
 And I step to the edge
 To see my world below.
 And I laugh at myself
 As the tears roll down.
 'Cause it's the world I know.
 It's the world I know.


 "Piece of Me"
 by Skid Row

 Sleazin' in the city
 Lookin' for a fight
 Got my heels and lookin' pretty
 On a Saturday night, night, night

 Good God, bless my soul
 I need a fix of rock 'n roll
 Come on baby you gotta wait and see
 You better hurry
 To get a piece of me

 Caught a lonely lady
 Crying on a cigarette
 I got nasty, nasty habits
 And that's all she's gonna get

 One for the money, two for the show
 So 'round and 'round and 'round we go
 Take a look at what-a you might need
 You better hurry
 To get a piece of me

 I don't have looks, I don't have money
 But I know one thing's for sure
 One night ain't enough of my love
 She wanted more, more, more

 Sleazin' in the city
 Lookin' for a fight
 Got my heels and lookin' pretty
 On a Saturday night, night, night

 One for the money, two for the show
 So 'round and 'round and 'round we go
 Take a look at what-a you might need
 You better hurry
 To get a piece of me
 To get a piece of me
 To get a piece of me


 "A Change Of Seasons"
 by Dream Theater


 I. The Crimson Sunrise (Instrumental)


 II. Innocence

 I remember a time
 My frail, virgin mind watched the crimson sunrise
 Imagined what it might find
 Life was filled with wonder
 I felt the warm wind blow
 I must explore the boundaries
 Transcend the depth of winter's snow
 Innocence caressing me
 I never felt so young before
 There was so much life in me
 Still I longed to search for more
 But those days are gone now
 Changed like a leaf on a tree
 Blown away forever into the cool autumn breeze
 The snow has now fallen and my sun's not so bright
 I struggle to hold on with the last of my might
 In my den of inequity
 viciousness and subtlety
 struggle to ease the pain
 struggle to find the sane
 Ignorance surrounding me
 I've never been so filled with fear
 All my life's been drained from me
 The end is drawing near....


 III. Carpe Diem

 'Carpe diem, seize the day'
 I'll always remember
 The chill of November
 The news of the fall
 The sounds in the hall
 The clock on the wall ticking away
 'Seize the Day'
 I heard him say
 Life will not always be this way
 Look around
 Hear the sounds
 Cherish your life while you're still around

 "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,        [Sample is James Waterston from   ]
 Old Time is still a-flying;              [the film "Dead Poet's Society".  ]
 And this same flower that smiles today,  [From the poem "To The Virgins, To]
 Tomorrow will be dying."                 [Make Much Of Time" by Robert     ]
                                          [Herrick.                         ]
 We can learn from the past
 But those days are gone
 We can hope for the future
 But there might not be one
 The words stuck in my mind
 alive from what I've learned
 I have to seize the day
 To home I returned
 Preparing for her flight
 I held with all my might
 Fearing my deepest fright
 She walked into the night
 She turned for one last look
 She looked me in the eye
 I said, 'I Love You...Good-bye'

 "It's the most awful thing you'll         [Various samples mainly John     ]
 ever hear."                               [Voight from the film "Table For ]
 "If you're lying to me..."                [Five", some are from the film   ]
 "Oh, you dearly love her."                ["Dead Poet's Society".          ]
 "...just have to leave... all our lives."
 "Seize the day!"
 "Something happened."
 "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may."
 "She was killed."


 IV. The Darkest of Winters (Instrumental)


 V. Another World

 So far or so it seems
 All is lost with nothing fulfilled
 Off the pages and the T.V. screen
 Another world where nothing's true
 Tripping through the life fantastic
 Lose a step and never get up
 Left alone with a cold blank stare
 I feel like giving up
 I was blinded by a paradise
 Utopia high in the sky
 A dream that only drowned me
 Deep in sorrow, wondering why
 Oh come let us adore him
 Abuse and then ignore him
 No matter what, don't let him be
 Let's feed upon his misery
 Then string him up for all the world to see
 I'm sick of all you hypocrites holding me at bay
 And I don't need your sympathy to get me through the day
 Seasons change and so can I
 Hold on Boy,
 No time to cry
 Untie these strings, I'm climbing down
 I won't let them push me away
 Oh come let us adore him
 Abuse and then ignore him
 No matter what, don't let him be
 Let's feed upon his misery
 Now it's time for them to deal with me


 VI. The Inevitable Summer (Instrumental)


 VII. The Crimson Sunset

 I'm much wiser now
 A lifetime of memories run through my head
 They taught me how for better or worse, alive or dead
 I realize there's no turning back
 Life goes on the offbeaten track
 I sit down with my son
 Set to see the Crimson Sunset
 (Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
 Many years have come and gone
 I've lived my life, but now must move on
 (Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
 He's my only one
 Now that my time has come
 Now that my life is done
 We look into the sun
 'Seize the day and don't you cry,
 Now it's time to say good-bye
 Even though I'll be gone,
 I will live on, live on.'


 "23"
 by God Lives Underwater

 I'm breathing the air
 The air I always breathe
 I don't have a lot
 I want someone to share it with me

 I really only want a few things
 They've all been taken away
 What does the next life bring
 I just want to feel O.K.

 I'm searching forever
 For someone or something
 I want to be high
 And I want someone to love me

 I've spent 23 years now
 Trying to get by
 Other people make it day to day
 I still wonder why

 I really only had a few thing
 They've all turned to tears
 One tried to kill me
 The other kept me here I'm still here


 "Damn I wish I was your Lover"
 by Sophie B. Hawkins

 That old dog has chained you up alright
 Give you everything you need to live inside a twisted cage
 Sleep beside an empty rage
 I had a dream I was your hero

 Damn, I wish I was your lover
 I'll rock you till the daylight comes
 Make sure you are smiling and warm
 I am everything
 Tonight I'll be your mother I will
 And I'll do such things to ease your pain
 Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed, ooh

 (Oh, open up, come inside, fill you up, gonna make you cry, cry, cry)

 This monkey can't stand to see you black and blue
 I give you something sweet each time you come inside my jungle book
 What is it just too good
 Don't say you'll stay 'cause then you go away

 Damn, I wish I was your lover
 I'll rock you till the daylight comes
 Make sure you are smiling and warm
 I am everything
 Tonight I'll be your mother I will
 I'll do such things to ease your pain
 Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
 Shucks, for me there is no other
 You're the only shoe that fits
 I can't imagine I'll grow out of it Damn (Ooh) I wish I was your lover, yeah

 If I was your girl believe me
 I'd turn on the Rolling Stones
 we could groove along and feel much better
 Let me in, mmm mmm
 I could do it forever and ever
 Give me an hour to kiss you
 Walk through heaven's door,
 I'm sure we don't need no doctor to feel much better
 Let me in, ooh
 Forever and ever and ever and ever...

 I sat on the mountainside with peace of mind
 And I lay by the ocean making love to her with visions clear W
 alked for days with no one near
 And I return as chained and bound to you

 Damn, I wish I was your lover
 I'll rock you till the daylight comes
 Make sure you are smiling and warm
 I am everything
 Tonight I'll be your mother I will
 I'll do such things to ease your pain
 Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
 Shucks, for me there is no other
 You're the only shoe that fits
 I can't imagine I'll grow out of it
 Damn, I wish I was your lover

 Come open up, I wanna come inside,
 I wanna fill you up, I wanna make you cry

 Damn, I wish I was your lover
 Hopping on a subway and I'm coming up town
 Damn, I wish I was your lover
 Standing on the street corner, waiting for my love to change 
 Damn, I wish I was your lover
 I'm feeling like a schoolboy, too shy, too young, oooh
 Damn, I wish I was your lover
 Come open up, I wanna come inside,
 I wanna fill you up, I wanna make you cry
 Damn, I wish I was your lover
 Hopping on -------- and I'm coming up town
 Damn, I wish I was your lover
 I'm hanging around this jungle, waiting that this fate would change


 "Goin' Off"
 by Spiderbait

 There are some people
 Who are
 Dickheads
 They don't care
 What they
 Do to
 Others
 
 I've seen some people
 Cut up
 Felt up
 Just when they're
 Dancing
 Singing
 Grinning
 Watching the band play
 
 
 "Kashmir"
 by Led Zeppelin

 Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
 And stars fill my dream
 I'm a traveller of both time and space
 To be where I have been
 To sit with elders of the gentle race
 This world has seldom seen
 They talk of days for which they sit and wait
 All will be revealed

 Talk in song from tongues of lilting grace
 Sounds caress my ear
 And not a word I heard could I relate
 The story was quite clear

 Ooh, baby, I been blind
 Oh, yeah, mama, there ain't no denyin'
 Oh, ooh yes, I been blind
 Mama, mama, ain't no denyin', no denyin'

 All I see turns to brown
 As the sun burns the ground
 And my eyes fill with sand
 As I scan this razor line
 Can I find, can I find where I've been
 Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
 Like sorts inside a dream
 Leave the path the led me to that place
 Yellow desert stream

 Like Shangri-la beneath the summer moon
 I will return again
 As the dust that floats finds you
 Will move and search
 Kashmir
 Oh, father of the four winds fill my sails
 Cross the sea of years
 With no provision but an open face
 Along the straits of fear

 Oh, when I want, when
 I'm on my way, yeah
 And my feet wear my fickle way to stay
 Ooh, yeah yeah, ooh, yeah yeah, but I'm down
 Ooh, yeah yeah, ooh, yeah yeah, but I'm down, so down
 Ooh, my baby, oh, my baby
 Let me take you there
 Come on, oh let me take you there
 Let me take you there


 "While My Guitar Gently Weeps"
 by The Beatles

 I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
 While my guitar gently weeps
 I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
 Still my guitar gently weeps

 I don't know why nobody told you how to unfold your love
 I don't know how someone controlled you
 They bought and sold you.

 I look at the world and I notice it's turning
 While my guitar gently weeps
 With every mistake we must surely be learning
 Still my guitar gently weeps

 I don't know how you were diverted
 You were perverted too
 I don't know how you were inverted
 No one alerted you.

 I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
 While my guitar gently weeps
 Look at you all...
 Still my guitar gently weeps.

 "COLORBLIND"

 on a beach twenty yards from the roadside
 back again 6 AM far from sleep
 must be 290 blue on the water
 it's gray to me 3 CV is all I see
 
 green can only hold you in the garden
 too much red will go right to your head
 but if it's all the same to you
 give me back my blue
 other colors fade anyway

 i'm colorblind three way tragedy
 pantone memory grayscale eyes
 maybe i'm paranoid yeah that's my problem
 you almost have to be when you look like me
 
 stopped in the shade of a road sign
 when the sun rose like a bomb
 tried to read the simple writing
 but the letters came out wrong
 it's all white lines to me
 but things are getting clearer
 i can almost read the writing in the mirror
 
 i'm colorblind three way tragedy
 pantone memory grayscale eyes
 maybe i'm paranoid yeah that's my problem
 you almost have to be when you look like me
 
 green can only hold you in the garden
 too much red will go right to your head
 but if it's all the same to you
 give me back my blue
 other colors fade anyway
 
 i'm colorblind freeway tragedy
 pantone memory x-ray eyes
 where'd all the color go on my radio?
 you almost have to be a satellite to see.
 

 "EVEN THE WAVES"

 me & judas lost at sea
 under electric twilight fading
 i look at him he sees through me
 40 days and we're still waiting
 
 i'm not tired but i think i'll lay back anyway
 i'm not welcome but i think i'll stay
 
 me & jonas lost at sea
 deep inside a dream we're trailing
 heard him whisper wait for me
 sun goes down and we're still sailing
 
 i'm not nervous but i think i'll lay back anyway
 i'm not helpless but i think i'll stay
 and even the waves won't carry me away
 
 keep heading west that's the best
 may be lost but i'm not crazy
 stay where you are not too far
 keep it up you're doing fine
 well i thought i was fine
 
 me & joseph lost at sea
 under rain and slowly waking
 he looks around and smiles at me
 41 and we're still waiting
 
 i'm not tired but i think i'll lay back anyway
 i'm not hopeless but i think i'll stay
 and even the waves won't carry me away
 
 
 "UNDERTOW"

 last night hit the net
 woke up in a sweat
 same scene different dream sudden ending
 
 grabbed a pillow and covered my head
 kicked the phone off the side of the bed
 tried to sing but the damn thing kept on ringing
 
 i know
 i'll go to mexico
 someplace nothing changes
 maybe i'll call on the phone
 maybe i'll write you a letter
 that's what i meant when i said goodbye

 backed the shovelhead out of the shed
 hit the interstate hard heading left
 the street below is water flowing undertow
 
 there's a song that i'd rather forget
 but i don't think i've shaken it yet
 as soon as i do
 i'm gonna write us another one

 i know
 i'll go to mexico
 someplace nothing changes
 maybe i'll call on the phone
 maybe i'll write you a letter
 that's what i meant when i said goodbye

 i know
 i'll go to mexico
 someplace nothing changes
 maybe i'll call on the phone
 maybe i'll write you a letter
 maybe i'll die maybe i'll learn how to fly
 that's what i meant when i said


 "AMERICA THE VIDEO"

 i was half outside and half inside a dream
 when i thought i heard your voice on my machine
 sang along had the song almost memorized
 liked the track so i laid back and let it fossilize
 
 (i've got all of this on video
 it just gets better every episode)
 
 america i was blind but now i see
 america right there in front of me
 
 lost my head in my hotel room when the ground shook
 had to choose between the bible and the phone book
 
 you're never home but that's okay
 it's so much easier that way
 'cause i can't tell it to your face in real time anyway
 
 america i was blind but now i see
 america right there in front of me
 
 and it makes no sense to me
 unless i see it on t.v.
 so just launch that satellite
 and get it right
 
 america i was blind but now i see
 america right there in front of me

 and it makes no sense to me
 unless i see it on t.v.
 so just launch that satellite
 and get it right
 
 (sometimes the answer just comes)

 "S.O.S."

 fly blackbird fly
 frozen the sea i see you
 old cover clouds new snow there they go
 
 silent but wings
 sun orange small i see you
 nowhere is home go alone and alone
 
 fly angel fly
 older than me i feel you
 coalcovered clouds white snow there you go

 heard myself call
 far from them all i feel you
 left them behind or ahead and he said
 
 sooner or later you get up off the floor
 when no one wants to hear it anymore
 someday soon you're gonna get up off the floor
 'cause no one wants to hear that shit

 cry blackbird cry over the waves i hear you
 coalcovered clouds white snow there they go
 ice on your wings songless he sings i hear you
 nowhere is home go alone there's a phone

 
 "ON THE PAGE"

 tell me something stupid
 auction off my diary
 life is getting esoteric
 let me in your movie
 each time i walk out the door
 someone mixes metaphors
 life is so much cleaner on the page
 
 it's like the morning when i'm dreaming
 and everything is so pristine
 it's just a seven hour movie
 and i'm in every scene
 
 let me in my t.v.
 get this tape to tori
 got to have a subplot
 when i sell them my life story
 maybe i should write it first
 and do the living later
 'cause life is so much cleaner on the page

 it's like the time i lost my body
 and then i saw it on t.v.
 somehow it shed a whole dimension
 but it still looked like me
 (hey! that looks like me!)
 
 each time i write lines for it
 someone improvises it
 life is so much cleaner on the page
 life is so much cleaner on the page
 

 "MOUSE (Now watch what happens)"

 (now, now I know I'm not crazy. the fucking mouse, the mouse is back again.
     and I got him here, mother fff - he's in the fucking radiator. this
     prick, and he's lay - he's eating a fucking Dorito. and I can't get him.
     and he's looking at me, and he'll still eat the Dorito. he's behind the
     fucking - i'm gonna fucking kill him. this is war. now this is war. now
     watch what happens.) [Todd Farrington]

 took the flower back
 his wayward love had been mislead
 the sun is dying
 apologies she can't accept
 check the window quick
 the sun is dying
 blue and red of day to purple night
 and absent light to disarray
 took the flower back
 his wayward love had been mislead
 the sun is dying
 apologies she won't accept
 check the window quick
 the sun is dying
 a candle marks her tears
 the flame will fade
 she'll greet the dawn in disarray
 she steps into the stream the level rising
 she steps into the stream the level rising
 took the flower back
 his wayward love had been misled
 the level's rising
 steps into the stream
 we're so misled
 she'll watch the pain the level's rising
 blue and reds of day to purple night
 and absent light to disarray
 she steps into the stream the level rising
 she steps into the stream the level rising
 she steps into the stream the level rising
 she steps into the stream the level rising
 

 "HELL MARY"

 Oh! Oh! I see the sky; it's becoming a very, very
 bright red, almost an orange, a red - orange. And it's
 like I'm suspended, and the light is so bright it
 hurts my eyes. And I see this huge ball. Now in the
 center - it's, it's a gray colored ball, almost - oh,
 I don't know what it's made of, but a rock - like
 formation. But as it's turning now, it's beginning to
 change color, becoming a purplish, hazy, orange -
 looking ball. And now it's beginning to gather great
 speed. And as it's going faster across the sky, part
 of it has broken off now, and it's going now behind
 the sun. I see the huge ball of the sun. It's a ball
 of fire. And this is another ball of fire. And a piece
 now is broken off, and it's hitting into the sun. And
 there - oh! Oh! It's an explosion. Oh! I can't look.
 Oh - h - h! Oh - h - h!

 by Kevin Moore/Chroma Key demos


 "HAY DAY. MAY DAY. HELP"

 Come in take your shoes off lock the door
 I just can't ignore you anymore
 You look at me so strange somethings gonna change
 Heavy is empty you'll find out
 It's a wonderful story
 
 Staring thru a wall that caught my eye
 I was in the house I thought I'd just say hi
 But the lamp seemed so distrught
 and i lost my train of thought
 everything watches you'll find out
 it's a wonderful story
 
 come on won't you hear my story
 if you listen i will stay
 normal words are getting boring
 i am not sane i am not sane

 when they come back i'll be gone
 and i'll bring my machine along
 i'll be floating on a cloud
 whispering warnings to my freinds
 and they'll all know i was right
 when they see the state i'm in
 and i'll never go back again
 
 
 "WEDNESDAY THE SKY"

 I was 5 miles up in the atmosphere
 I was half asleep when I landed here
 Kept my eyes half-closed when the tide came in
 Heard the rushing waves and I slept again
 
 Sunday I'll get back into the sky
 But I can wait much longer if I try
 
 So I tell myself in a daydream trance
 When I wake back up give me half a chance
 Then a girl showed up (she was heaven sent)
 So I sent her back (wasn't what I meant)

 Monday I'll get back into the sky
 But I can wait much longer if I try
 
 Behind the sun someone is waiting for me
 Careful my son never know never know
 Just past that sun heaven is waiting for me
 Thousand to one gotta go gotta go

 Don't save your wings for the summer
 Give up your fear let it go
 
 Tuesday I get back into the sky
 Cause I can't wait much longer


 "ROLL AWAY THE STONE"

 wake up darlin' don't you hear the phone
 no one's gonna make you go alone
 she don't know what's happening
 she don't know what's happening
 everything you dreamt about tonight
 is gonna help you get through this alright
 she don't know what's happening
 she don't know what's happening
 and the angles in your head went kind of cold on you last night
 how are you supposed to make it right
 roll away the stone
 life calling night falling i'm already gone
 wake up darlin' and roll away the stone
 watch me float out from the sea
 moon is you and you are me
 this is all you need to know
 something passes let it go
 life calling night falling i'm already gone
 wake up darlin' and roll away the stone
 

 "NORA"

 could this be the one i followed
 could this be the one i've given faith
 i know you care
 all at once a star is frozen
 all at once my memory fades away
 i know you care
 peace falling into my life
 why won't you follow?
 words falling into my way
 what do i say?
 gave you all a man could borrow
 and all the time you've hidden this away
 i know you care
 faith falling out of my life
 faith did you fuck him?
 love moving out of my way
 why should i stay?
 words from the mouth of my friend
 and i had to believe him
 when we talked about the things you used to say
 every second day
 words take a hold of my memory
 as history changes
 and if i could just forget it all tonight
 that would be alright
 years falling out of my life why don't you follow?
 love falling out of the way why should i stay?
 words falling out of my life what should i write?


 "ON THE PAGE ('95 version)"

 tell me something stupid
 auction off my diary
 life is getting esoteric

 "BLUSONG"

 endless days, second phase, feeling fine
 prayed for this, all my life, all the time
 i'm just trying to leave myself alone
 twenty years from home

 saved myself from the choke of content
 clipped my wings when i landed innocent
 i'm just trying to leave myself alone
 twenty years from home

 and every day one turns away
 and lets morning come between us
 hurts my eyes but otherwise
 it's less than i can take
 the sunset is my best friend now
 the best i've ever known
 i'm just trying to leave myself alone
 twenty years from home
 i'm just trying to get there on my own
 twenty years from home


 "SUN ORANGE SMALL"

 fly blackbird fly
 frozen the sea i see you
 old cover clouds new snow there they go
 
 silent but wings
 sun orange small i see you
 nowhere is home go alone so alone
 
 fly angel fly
 older than me I feel you
 coalcovered clouds white snow there you go
 
 heard myself call
 far from them all i feel you
 left them behind or ahead and he said
 
 something's gonna change i can feel it
 last night i had dreams that i was you
 i was tearing out the pages of my diary
 when a bird flew past my head
 so i put them back again 'cause i knew
 it's alright to like the way i feel

 cry blackbird cry over the waves i hear you
 coalcovered clouds white snow there they go
 ice on your wings songless he sings i hear you
 nowhere is home all alone there's a phone

 something's gonna change i can feel it
 last night i just stayed at home alone
 i was tearing out the pages from my diary
 when a bird flew past my head
 so i put them back again 'cause i know
 it's alright to feel the way i feel

 sometimes the answer just comes
 

 "BECAUSE THE PLANE CRASHED"

 the words of a poem she wrote
 on the promise of faraway towns
 came clearer today and would not go away
 as the wheels lifted off of the ground


 "THE FUCKING MOUSE"

 (now, now I know I'm not crazy. the fucking mouse, the mouse is back again.
     and I got him here, mother fff - he's in the fucking radiator. this
     prick, and he's lay - he's eating a fucking Dorito. and I can't get him.
     and he's looking at me, and he'll still eat the Dorito. he's behind the
     fucking - i'm gonna fucking kill him. this is war. now this is war. now
     watch what happens.)

 took the flower back
 his wayward love had been mislead
 the sun is dying
 apologies she can't accept
 check the window quick
 the sun is dying
 blue and red of day to purple night
 and absent light to disarray
 took the flower back
 his wayward love had been mislead
 the sun is dying
 apologies she won't accept
 check the window quick
 the sun is dying
 a candle marks her tears
 the flame will fade
 she'll greet the dawn in disarray
 she steps into the stream the level rising
 she steps into the stream the level rising
 took the flower back
 his wayward love had been misled
 the level's rising
 steps into the stream
 we're so misled
 she'll watch the pain the level's rising
 blue and reds of day to purple night
 and absent light to disarray
 she steps into the stream the level rising
 she steps into the stream the level rising
 she steps into the stream the level rising
 she steps into the stream the level rising


 "SHALLOW"

 i won't hold my breath
 been in too long i guess
 only time will tell
 i can't stand here waiting
 give me a simple dream
 once across a shallow stream
 all in the name of change
 i can't stand here waiting
 innocent is sent at last
 represent my hollow past
 underneath and falling fast
 i can't stand here waiting
 it's all an arrow so
 i'm way off mark i know
 release at least if all
 i can't stand here waiting
 all my dreams are lost and found
 set them up and knock them down
 she's gone 2000 years
 i can't stand here waiting


 "HOLLOW"

 for the last time give me ten cents or a dime
 and i'll kick the resurrection off today
 in the first place get that book out of my face
 man, he never tried to call me anyway
 now hanging out with prophets ain't no crime
 but i never search for nothing i can't find
 jesus had his own life, i got mine
 just call me hollow you can call me hollow
 
 i was no place when i saw a pretty face
 and she nearly saved my soul before she died
 it's a damn shame 'cause i almost got her name
 but i'm glad to say I made it home alive
 now holding hands with mary ain't no crime
 but dressing up like santa's not far behind
 tell me about your body fuck your mind
 just call me hollow you can call me hollow
 
 if you crash and you fall you can call on me
 i'm the one you can trust but you'll never be
 it's a choice like this song and it's all on you
 if you're right then i'm wrong what you gonna do?
 
 i've been thinking take up drinking
 throw a few bad years away
 keep redialing and wake up smiling
 maybe he'll be in today
 
 gimme that ol' time religion yeah
 gimme that ol' time religion yeah
 
 for the last time give me ten cents or a dime
 and i'll kick the crucifixion off today
 in the first place get that shit out of my face
 it'll only make me happy anyway
 acid always gets me so deranged
 puts all but one station out of range
 and i never watch a channel i can't change
 just call me hollow you can call me hollow
 
 gimme that ol' time religion
 gimme that ol' time religion
 

 "WATERCOLOR"

 laying in my bed i got this feeling
 only silent pictures talk to me that way
 in my head by my head sits the soundtrack to the movie
 and the colors fade the moment i hit play
 sounds like watercolor
 anything to drown me
 i will sleep until i sing myself awake
 and i always liked it better
 when the morning rises sooner
 and i can't recall a single word i said
 it's not like i can't stop
 pull back the playback in my head
 i could lay here
 i could lie you know
 maybe i can find a place
 where them old movies never go
 i could try it (doesn't matter)
 i could try it though (it doesn't matter)
 sounds like watercolor
 anything to drown me
 i will hide until i find myself awake
 and it sounds a little better
 when it gets a little louder
 by the morning if i make it i'm o.k.

 (pack your bags it's time to panic, 15 years in automatic, cellar door leads
     to the attic, what was jesus thinking get there faster if we drive, 12
     short steps to the sunny side, got a backstage pass and a bitchin ride,
     and everything comes easy. that was easy.)

 "CHROMAKEY"

 so i'm dreaming in the mirror trying to stare my spirit clean as the world
     comes in from hollywood, red, blue and green.
 catch sight of myself in the color as a memory catches a wave. and it
     splashes down in front of me all in chroma key.

 wow   what a night
 just like   3D vision
 wow   what a show
 damn though   2D memory

 there was sunlight in my eyesight
 when the words began to fade
 so i shifted into satellite
 and i pulled the shade

 got caught up in a radio current
 and my energy locked on the beam
 when i hit the ground i was two feet down
 do you dream like i do?

 wow   what a night
 just like   3D vision
 wow   what a show
 damn though   2D memory

 (settlebackfireupthesimultinesthankyouallforwatchingandcatchthepicturesas-
     theyflythroughtheair)

 remember when you told me that you'd never let me go?
 now was that three years from yesterday or a video?
 kept scanning for clues in the colors in a room with a
 wonderful view, till i found myself in front of me sitting
 next to you.

 wow.


 "BLANKET (I Buried Me Wife And I Dance On Top Of Her)"
 
 Memory save me I'm fuckin up. Constantly laid on the ground. Looking for
     signs on the ceiling (she wants me to know she wants me around). Think I
     was moving to something. Thought I was sailing along. Had to be sailing
     for someplace (thought I was right, but I must have been wrong). You do
     make a beautiful blinder, you hide things I don't want to see. Your arms
     cover me like a blanket and maybe it's all that I need. Memory save me
     I'm trippin up. Picking up bones from the ground. Throw me a chain and
     I'll climb it up (thought I was up, but I guess I was down). You look
     like a dream I was dreaming, a dream of a boy by the sea. You must have
     eyes just like mirrors, 'cause I thought I was looking at me. Close your
     eyes, think of the Best Thing To Say. iampathetically lost and maybe you
     made me this way. Memory save me I'm fuckin up. The sun's just a spot on
     the sea. I know I was reaching for something (thought it was you, but I
     guess it was me). And the world is a wonderful target, she was a
     wonderful world, but God is a girl who won't listen. She was an
     insolent girl. Close your eyes and see what you're doing to me. She
     catches my eye with a cynical smile and says, "I Cannot Solve All I
     See". I had a dream (dreams would fill my head, but I let 'em all slide,
     american-style, for a blanket that lays on my bediwaitalldayformysailor-
     andsometimeshecomeswereyousurprisedthathediedtryingtolookforother-
     peoplenohewashewasthetypeofpersonwhowoulddefinitelygolookingforthe-
     people) I wanted to find an innocent mind but only found myself waiting.
     I laid on the floor, you walked through the door and now I feel myself
     fading. I wanted to find an innocent mind, but only found myself
     waiting. I laid on the floor, You walked through the door and now I feel
     myself fading. Now I feel myself fading. I jumped on a meaningful wave
     that carried me right to the shoreline. I laughed when my face hit the
     sand and swam out again for the joyride. I told you the things that I
     want and you gave me just what I needed. It's just like my father would
     want, but I couldn't smile when he did. I boarded the windows and doors
     and took the clock down from the ceiling. But I kept my head to the
     floor 'cause I had a confident feeling. Somebody called me today, I
     answered the door kind of hazy. He told me to leave all my clothes, he
     told me to tell you you're crazy. I followed him out to the street, he
     pointed and quickly departed. And left me to travel for weeks, till I
     get to the place where I started. And I just want to be where I started,
     I just want to get back where I started, and I just want to be where I
     started, and I just want to get back where I started.
