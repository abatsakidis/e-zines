 2000 .+#################################################################.net

        I'll never forget that day in the only class my community college
 offered in the poli-sci department.  I had been biding my time, listening to
 all of these single mothers and ousted factory workers and everyone else
 give their opinions on this and that, with little interaction from the
 instructor to actually EDUCATE them.  It's hard to watch, especially when
 you're a fanatically political person who prides themselves on understanding
 their beliefs and pressing for them.  And I was only becoming more and more
 miserable sitting through this class as we debated, "Should there be a none-
 of-the-above spot on the ballot?"

        Because I consider myself well-versed on the platforms of many
 parties beyond that of Democrats and Republicans, I kept my mouth shut for
 a while during this debate.  I wanted to hear what normal people thought,
 and find out if I was some sort of wickedly bizarre outsider who thought
 politics was "fun" and should be banished to the BLACK HOLE.

        So as this debate continued, I realized that the vast majority of the
 people in this class really had no idea about anything beyond a two-party
 system.  The vast majority, in fact, was vehement in their wish for a none-
 of-the-above space on the ballot, believing that somehow that would be the
 only way their opinions would be expressed.  Following this logic, this
 would mean that the general public would probably none-of-the-above more
 often than not until they found someone they could fully support.  Following
 this logic further by tapping into the mass public that doesn't agree 100%
 with EITHER party, this means there would never be another elected official
 again.

        Sensing the worst--that being my instructor AGREEING with the class--
 I finally jumped in.

        See, although the United States government runs on a primarily two-
 party system, there really are more than just two parties.  Until Perot
 jumped in during the '92 election, the vast majority of the american public
 hadn't even CONSIDERED third parties as being relevant let alone worth a
 vote.  Third parties have existed ever since this country became a nation
 of Republicans and Democrats, because two platforms cannot possibly satisfy
 the wide range of beliefs of everyone in this country... sometimes not even
 coming close.  So, instead of whining, bitching, and complaining, refusing
 to vote, writing in "COOKIE MONSTER" or lobbying for a none-of-the-above
 option, why not find something you CAN stand for?  

        It's not a difficult thing to educate yourself on politics.  If you
 care enough about your country that you bitch and moan about policies and
 actions and you VOTE, then why NOT take an evening out of your life to make
 your vote educated?  After all, it's not like the world is going to find out
 who you vote for.  It's nobody's business.  You're not going to suddenly
 become part of the outcast crowd because you voted for someone who isn't
 cool.  Time spent reading newspapers, magazines, or searching the Internet
 will probably make you feel a lot better about what you do this Tuesday.

        Where to start?  First, think about your own values and beliefs.
 Think about those that you don't have an opinion about.  Think about those
 that you know nothing about at all.  Think about your life experiences, the
 way your family survived growing up, your relatives, your friends, your job,
 your lifestyle, your morals, your religion, your compassion, your duties,
 EVERYTHING that affects you.  And with these in mind, find a party that
 represents all of these and fights to keep them sacred.

        I did this quite some time ago.  I grew up in a quite democrat-
 oriented household, and I later fell into the glory of idealism and equality
 that is socialism, but I turned my back on all of it.  I looked at what I
 really wanted for myself and for society.  What I wanted was simply nothing
 more than freedom, and I turned to the Libertarian Party.

        I'm a very outspoken individual.  I like my opinions, I like my
 beliefs, and I like being able to scream them from the top of my lungs and
 not be beaten down for it.  I believe that morons should exist in our
 society and be given a voice so that the rest of us can teach our own
 children how stupid they are.  I love that freedom.  I love laughing at
 those who need a good slap in the mouth, and I love the right to own a gun
 so that if they should enter my home I can KILL THEM.  And most of all, I
 want to be able to do things in my own home that don't affect anyone else
 in THEIR homes without the risk of police bashing in my door and telling me,
 no, I cannot possibly make that decision for myself.

        Never mind that I'd have a lot more money to set aside for when I
 retire years and years from now if the damned government wasn't taking it
 all away from me.  Never mind that places where I've worked could've put
 more of their profits into my pocket if they didn't have ridiculous
 regulations to follow that didn't even affect them.  Never mind that I don't
 appreciate not being able to get a decent education because they can't fund
 the schools adequately enough to provide the programs year-round so I can
 finish my degree (let alone pay the instructors enough for them to stick
 around to teach them).

        I believe that the Libertarian Party's solutions to these problems
 and more will make MY life better as well as everyone else's.  Now I feel
 comfortable in placing my votes.  Now I feel indignant about what other
 elected politicians do, and I do my best to oust them from office.  But most
 of all, now I am angry at others who complain but don't bother trying to
 change the status quo.

        Agree with me or not... I don't care.  But don't talk to me about it
 unless you take the time to educate yourself.  I'll even get you started.
 Good luck.

        The DEMOCRATIC PARTY is high on personal freedom and the right for
 everyone to have an equal chance to succeed.  It believes in a governmental
 regulations and policies to enforce those freedoms, as well as keeping
 businesses in check.  You can find their platform at
 http://www.democrats.org/hq/resources/platform/

        The REPUBLICAN PARTY strives for a free capitalist society, where
 those who work hard reap the rewards and those who do not will not.  They
 also believe in upholding christian morals in our society to prevent chaos.
 You can find their platform at http://www.rnc.org/2000/2000platformcontents

        The LIBERTARIAN PARTY believes in complete freedom in one's personal
 life as well as in the business world.  They believe in minimal government
 and privatization to improve failing public programs.  Their platform is
 found at http://www.lp.org/issues/platform/

        The GREEN PARTY emphasizes preservation of the environment above all
 else.  The party is currently splintered due to the non-green beliefs of
 their presidential candidate Ralph Nader versus their true party beliefs.
 The platform supported by Nader is found at
 http://gis.pair.com/asgp/platform/gpp2000.html

        The REFORM PARTY believes in multiple changes to our current
 governmental structure to ensure that the American people's concerns are
 being addressed and acted upon.  Their platform is available at
 http://www.reform-party-usa.org/principles/platform1997/constitutional-
 principles.html

        The NEW FEDERALIST PARTY strives to emulate the policies and beliefs
 that were backed by Ronald Reagan during his term as president.  You can
 read more about them at http://www.reagan2000.com/federalistplatform.asp

        The SOCIALIST PARTY works for ultimate equality, whether it be in
 work or play, and to extinguish all classes as well as the idea of the
 "haves" and the "have-nots".  Their platform is available at
 http://sp-usa.org/platform.html

        The LABOR PARTY shares beliefs similar to that of the socialist party
 but with more of a bend toward help for the workforce that barely breaks
 even.  Find more at http://www.igc.org/lpa/documents/const.html

        There are many, MANY more parties to choose from--some are simply
 hardcore factions of these parties, others are more centrist in view, some
 are splinters to these and more.  There are parties representing those
 with a dream of anarchy as well as those with a dream of a democratic
 socialist state.  There is a near guarantee that somewhere out there is a
 party that agrees with you almost 100%.

        Stop sitting on your ass and settling with something you can only
 half-assed believe in.  Stop complaining about the "big two" candidates and
 about how worthless they are.  DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

        Of course, if you're one of those damned commies, I'd be happier if
 you DIDN'T vote.  Thank you.
