        it was frank the stinky ferret's first day of school.  his mom
 dropped him off at 8 am and he went down to the cafeteria to get his school
 provided breakfast.  frank the stinky ferret was quite pleases when he found
 that they were serving brown sugar and cinnamon pop tarts and black coffee
 for breakfast.  so elated was he, he bought double breakfast!

        the bell rang so he went to class.  there were mostly ferrets in his 
 homeroom, but there were some dirty skunks, also.  boy was he glad he wasnt 
 the stinkiest individual in homeroom!

        all the other student kept staring at frank the stinky ferret,
 though, and he was wondering what was wrong.  he took a look around the
 classroom and then it hit him... he had made the mistake of wearing
 unfashionable corduroy pants!

        just as he came to the conclusion, this ferret to the right of him
 said, "hey, stinky!  dont you know that courdaroy pants sooo reek of
 uncool-eousity?  flourenscent colored sweat pants are where its at now a
 days!  it looks like you're stinky and not very fashionable either! haha!"

        just then all the students started chanting, "STINKY AND
 UNFASHIONABLE!", over and over and over and over and over and over again.
 this made frank the stinky ferret very upset.  its a good thing frank the
 stinky ferret had learned to vomit on command though, its comes in handy at
 times like this!

        frank stood up on his desk and yelled, "TAKE THIS YOU SWEATPANT
 WEARERS!" and he projectile vomitted all over all his classmates and his
 teacher too.  he got sent to the principal's office, but the principal
 couldn't stand to smell him so he told frank the stinky ferret that he'd
 pass him for the year if he never brought his stinky assed self to school
 ever ever again.

        to celebrate, frank the stinky ferret went home, listened to his atom
 and his package cds, ate some cheeseburgers and drank cherry coke.
