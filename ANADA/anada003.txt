 "There are only 2 kinds of pokémon for the black man:
  Jigglyboo, and Jigglysquat."


        Race does not exist.  It is a lie invented and propagated by the
 bourgeoisie intelligencia to secure the dominance and privilege of Western
 European culture and its elite. The biological theory of race holds that the
 human species evolved into its present form from three seperate sub-species.
 And that while our genetic code is the same, the differing alleles of each
 gene determine our seperate phenotypic appearance and cultural behaviors.
 This difference in our genetic alleles is how we define race and understand
 its biological basis. For example, the genetic alleles taken from a
 statistical sample of white people when compared with that taken from a
 statistical sample of black people will vary by approximately 6%.  Thus, if
 a genetic allele difference of 6% or more is present between two subjects,
 the subjects are of different races.  However, when an allele sample is
 taken from one individual and compared to that of another, the difference
 will be approximately 12%.

        Thus, we all are more than the required 6% difference and as such,
 are each our own separate race.  Since every person is biologically their
 own race, the concept of race does not distinguish groups of people and is
 useless.  So, if race is a false concept, why does it continue to saturate
 our ideas and progress unhindered through history?

        If we are in competition with one another to gain the resources we
 need to survive, such as food, water, clothing, and shelter, and these
 resources all have their origins from land and property that only a small
 group controls, it is in the interests of this group to divide the property-
 less class into easily distinguishable divisions so that their hostilities
 will be directed inward to their own social class and not against those who
 truely oppress and enslave them.  The concept of race is a simple
 utilitarian construct serving to keep the oppressed divided, the oppressors
 secure, all the while justifying this stratification to both classes.  And
 so it has been throughout history from ancient times to Nazi Germany to the
 current one half of one percent that possesses 98% of all the wealth and
 resources on the planet.
