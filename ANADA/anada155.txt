 i'm bored as usual

 i've not written one of these for ages

 well, ever

 I know my audience

 ever seen me in the streeet, please stop and say hell

 course u don't know who I am and i'd like to keep it that way

 i'm not lonely, I just don't have many friends

 who can I suck up to next? she asks.  one of my friends always does that.
 she sucks up to my two closest friends.  they don't like her *that* much cos
 she sucks up to them.  she gets her way tho a lot of the time, she alays
 gives out her money. its annoying isn't it

 I think someone people think i'm a suck up too.  I hope i'm not, I don't
 think I am

 why is it some people know me better than I do? that's not fair

 nothings fair is it tho?! nope siree

 er... what the fuck did that do?!?  i hate buttons that do fuck all

 ahhhhh sweet f a. ever get the feeling it's your best friend?  well I fixed
 the puta.  my friends cousin said something.  i'm incedibly dull.  I write
 scary letters to my ex friends telling them I love them, then they feel
 uncomfortable.  there must be a point somewhere

 everything has a point

 i'm sure this cd is jumping

 aaaaarrrrrrrrrggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh

 its crap anyway bye bye bye bye

 what next?

 a nice rude song that would shock your mother, thats always fun.  it says
 fuck off a lot.  aaaawwwww isn't he sweet,

 why don't u get the fuck out of my face now

 gladly

 ctrl alt delete

 go on I dare you

 ctrl alt delete again go on

 whats the point when is there a fucking point

 ye this is just babbling the 1st thing that cames into my head

 have I got anything constructive to say?!?!? i doubt it shall I look

 ~looks deep inside~

 I know the rights and wrongs, thats about it

 form an opinion why can't I form a fucking opinion

 I read somewhere that your opinion is just half of someone elses and then
 yours built on top

 ok so I just made it up did it sound quite true tho?

 I got a printer must go use it bbye
