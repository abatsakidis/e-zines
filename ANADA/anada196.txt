        one day, an acquaintance of frank the stinky ferret asked him if he'd
 like to go record shopping with him.  frank the stinky ferret was very
 enthusiastic and shrieked, "OH GRAND!  HOW I WOULD LOVE TO GO RECORD
 SHOPPING WITH YOU THIS FINE DAY!"

        so, frank and his acquaintance got into frank the stinky ferret's
 go-kart and off to the record store they went.  frank had his credit card
 with him and his credit card company had just foolishly raised his credit
 limit, so frank picked up numerous records.  frank picked out records by
 poison the well, the dillinger escape plan, converge, isis, the year of our
 lord, reversal of man, and corrin.

        frank approached his acquanitance to show off what he was going to
 buy, which he did gleefully.  after frank the stinky ferret's acquaintance
 looked over the records frank asked, "so what do you have?"  frank's brain
 nearly exploded when he witnessed the utter crapulence that was his
 acquaintence's selections.  inculded were records by the front street
 degrees boys, britney spears, eminem, hootie and the blowfish, and the
 newest album by kid limpknot.

        frank was flabbergasted.  "wha, wah, wha, huh, who, uh... dood this
 shit totally scrapes the bowels of sucktitude.  what the hell kind of
 reekazoid are you?  screw you bitch, walk home."

        frank the stinky ferret then went home to listen to his new records,
 play tony hawk 2, eat cheeseburgers and drink cherry coke.
