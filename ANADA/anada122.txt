        Where am I, I thought as got to my feet dusting my clothes.  I felt
 cold chills racing through my body and fear overwhelming me.  It was dark,
 this place I was in and deathly cold.

        I strained my eyes to see in the distance but there was nothing to
 see.  I didn't even remember how I got there.  I fondled in the dark,
 searching for anything solid to grip on to.  After a few clumsy attempts I
 managed find to find a wall of some kind.  It was cold, slimy; felt like
 rock, like that of a cave.

        I moved along the wall desperately wanting out of this place, my fear
 building, the darkness enveloping me, taunting me.  All my childhood fears
 of ghosts and goblins filling my mind.

        I wanted to scream out but couldn't bring forth the words.  I started
 hearing things moving around me.  I didn't know if it was paranoia or what.
 Was I paranoid or was this just some kind of fucked up nightmare?  I started
 moving faster, the noises getting closer... louder.

        I was trembling now, scared shitless and on the verge of tears.  What
 was happening to me?  Where was I?  How in the hell did I get here? 

        Something brushed against my leg.  I stopped.  Paralyzed, cold beads
 of sweat forming on my forehead.  Was I going to die in this devilish place?
 I was trapped with nowhere to run.

        "Fuck it!" I yelled, letting go of the wall and starting to run,
 trying to get away from the demons both physical and mental, that clawed at
 my tortured soul.

        The ground became soft and mushy, and I found it hard to keep my
 footing.  I struggled as my feet sank into the clay-like ground, barely
 moving now.  I fell to my knees, not able to go on any further.  My chest
 felt warm.  Putting my hand across it, I felt moist and sticky material pull
 away from it.  What the hell?  I thought.

        Then it hit me.  The night before.  The liquor store.  The elderly
 store clerk.  The sawed off Smith and Wesson hidden in my overcoat.  But
 something went wrong and the clerk pulled a gun.  There was a bang, and I
 remembered my chest being slammed by a nine millimeter slug.  The clerks
 words echoing through my semi-conciouss mind... "Die fucker, you sorry
 fucking bastard."

        I looked up, the darkness lifting, light surrounding me... but it
 wasn't light.  More like jagged flames burning aroud me. The figure standing
 before me was of pure evil: a hooven monster with blood hued skin and dark
 crimson horns pertruding out his head.  He reached for my hand. "Welcome to
 eternity... it is here that you will burn for your sins."  He said no more
 and walked into the flames.
