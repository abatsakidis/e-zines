 wistful

 nestled in the navysilk night
 there is a whisper of warmth
 that weaves along the legs&arms
 which occupy open doors&windows
 it hovers behind the lost cars
 speeding down empty roads,a
 smokebread trail marking paths
 that may never be retraced
 it blends into the aching blue
 of saxophonepianobass,humming
 with the undeniable allure of
 humanity,bittersweet longing
 but where are you candlesoft
 breath,you who fills my mouth
 who laughingly dances my eyes
 into the inscrutable darkness
 where are you,my shy dreaming
 secret window to the otherworld
 where are you tonight
		     without me

 
 gesture

 this day will live,not in
 infamy,but in my mind,in the
 kaleidoscope echoes of my
 fragmented memories of us
 this was when the first
 whispery web-cracks formed
 in our perfect crystal life
 our pictureframe future
 but i am the only one who
 sees,because i alone watch
 the startled glass wince
 you have never seen this
 photograph,so immaculately
 dusted and forlornly kept
 you will never see it until
 you turn to throw it away
