 'the maggot'

        i sat at my desk and tried to come up with something.  anything. all
 i could do was doodle little mountain scenes.  i even used some nice shading
 but it still wasn't what i had in mind.  so, i ended up sitting there for a
 little while longer, staring at this can of mixed nuts.  it's a bonus 20%
 more can with a guarantee of no more than 50% peanuts.  imagine that.  the
 almonds are the best.  everyone knows that.  that's why there aren't too
 many in the can.  bitches.


 'the bootlicker'

        sometimes i dont eat for days.  to feel the pain of hunger gnawing at
 my stomach and chest is the purest feeling in the world.  as pure as virgin
 snow.  as pure as a thousand small children playing in a school yard.
 screaming and yelping their sounds of joy.  you can almost see them dying in
 the morning sunlight.


 'the crybaby'

        she said she loved to sit in the car when it rained and listen to the
 rain dance on the metal roof.  she would sit there for hours, listening to
 nothing other than the rain.  she would cry.  to hear the rain beating time
 on the roof of her car and to taste the salty tears of utter joy.  she's in
 the car listening to mahler, waiting for the rains to come.

 "what a day, what a day... if you can look it in the face and hold yr vomit"

        so there i was... suspended under pagan starlight... mesmerized by
 the sound of my own feedback... white noise... there was soft enchanting
 music being played in the background... it was piano music... no, wait, it
 was a sort of ambient techno... yeah, i remember the glockenspiel solo
 towards the middle... then the disc changed and leif garret was singing
 smells like teen spirit... weird dood.

 rise in the moonlight
 sparrows and phoenix
 rising from ashes
 squealing in the sonic fog
 dying, praying
 to live in flight
 do you see the bloodletting
 do you, motherfucker

        when morning came, i sat down underneath the large tree in the center
 of the yard... it was hard to get comfortable for there were countless
 gnarled roots that snaked in and out of the then parched meadow... i chewed
 on lemon grass... i had combat boots on... i had a knit cap on... it was
 hot... it was a mad day... the sun beat down through the bare branches and
 fucked with my head... i moved over to a more shady spot... the treee moved
 with me... the sun moved with me... or did i ever move?  no i dont think i
 did... crap...

        thats my gi joe's mass grave, over there by the dead squirrel...

        i cursed

 "my hand are really shaking, i cannot hardly walk, we're gonna ask the land 
 lord, why he's been such a cock"


        he needed to look for a job.

        he was accustomed to working in shipping and receiving in warehouses
 and such, but he was prepared to take a dishwasher's position if necessary.
 he woke up at noon but laid in bed for about 13 mintues.  the sky was grey,
 the room was greyer.  he got up and put on the same pants he'd been wearing
 for 5 days.  they were comfortable and tan.  there was a store on the corner
 of madison and county that he got the local paper and cheap coffee at every
 morning.  the coffee tasted like shit.  he could never put enough sugar in
 it.  the man behind the counter knew his name but he didnt know how.  he
 never asked though, he really didnt care.

        he got back to the cheap hotel that he was staying at and took the
 want ads into the bathroom with him.  he read them and took a shit.  then he
 went back to sleep.
