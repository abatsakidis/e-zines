 sometime i like to think that stuff just falls out of the sky or just
 appears out of thin air.  who knows, that just may happen.  how many stars 
 have already exploded that i will never get to see explode in my lifetime? 
 how many times have i exploded or will explode in my life time?  why is it 
 that when the giant foam robots came on stage, they didnt just eat the drum 
 kit or poop on the bass amp?  i would never go into another forest again if
 i didnt have to.  i cant imagine laying in a bed of pine needles without you 
 laying right next to me.  it's even kinda dark in the forest at noon.  its 
 even kinda dark in my bedroom at noon.

 driving on the highway at night.  the backs of cars in front of me look like
 giant evil insects flying backwards.  giant gleaming red eyes.  license
 plate grimace.  as i speed up it appears as though they are now flying
 towards me.  invisible wings.  the grimaces turn to smiles and its a
 beautiful happy bug flying by my window.  then i run you off the road.  i
 must destroy you.

 i just want to be able to read books and listen to music all day long,
 everyday.  is that so wrong?  but then i need to be held.  being human.
 needing food.  wearing socks.  argyle socks perferably.  no striped tube
 socks.  no plain white.  boring.  oh, i need spring water too.  the best
 part about going to school was going to the bagel store everyday when i had
 an hour off.  i would get a cinnamon raisin bagel with butter and a grapeade
 snapple everyday.  sometimes julie would go too.  and then listening to
 music in the car and writing the worst poetry i could think of so i could
 read it in poetry class...

 ahem:
 how are you today?
 my you seem so gay.
 shall we frolick in the hay?
 nay! go away?
 ok. :(
 
 ...etc., etc. being a fucking retard is where it's at d00der.
