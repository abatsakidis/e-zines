        PLEASE, DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER UNLESS YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT MAKING
 TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS!!

        Come on.  We mean it.  Turn back now if you don't have your sights
 set on EIGHT FIGURES by EASTER!!

        Are you sure you want to keep reading this?  Perhaps you'd be more
 interested in some other company's email, one that only promises a hundred
 grand, or throws around vague bullshit about "unlimited earning potential."
 We don't mean to be rude to you, but frankly, if you're not DEAD FUCKING
 SERIOUS about latching onto TEN MILLION DOLLARS within six months, then we
 don't want to talk to you.  Okay?  We're very busy getting richer and
 teaching other serious people how to get richer.  Those of you who
 frivolously answer this email or call our informational answering machine
 just to leave dirty messages are just wasting your time and our own.

        You know?  What the hell?  Why don't you get a hobby or something?  I
 just don't get why you have to bother us when you're not even serious about
 earning TEN MILLION DOLLARS in SIX MONTHS.  I have to admit, it's people
 like you who are seriously making me doubt the effectiveness of sending out
 junk emails to a carefully selected database of 2.6 million email addresses.
 I'm not doing this for kicks, you know, this is my thing, my mission, and
 here you come, Joe AOL, sitting there in your Stone Cold Steve Austin shirt
 and drinking a beer, looking at donkey porn, and you get my email--my plea,
 my exhortation, my boost up from the gutter to the good life--and you don't,
 for one second, give any serious, sober consideration to making TEN MILLION
 DOLLARS in SIX MONTHS.

        If you emailed me an incredible chance to win a seven-night cruise by
 calling a 900 number to enter, or sent me a link to an amazing 100% free
 teen blowjob site that you were sure was going to be shut down in a week so
 check it out now, I'd at least give it a chance and check it out.  I don't
 even know you, but I'd do that much for you, because I still believe--call
 me old-fashioned--that the Internet is a big community, a family if you
 will.  Ignoring a nice offer that someone takes the time to send you--why,
 that's just rude.  I tell you, the ol' neighborly spirit that made the 'net
 such a great place is dying a little each day, with each press of the delete
 button, and it's people like you who won't take my offer to make TEN MILLION
 DOLLARS in SIX MONTHS seriously who are to blame.  For shame, sir!  For
 shame!

        You know what?  I don't even want to sell--uh, I mean, tell--you how
 to make TEN MILLION DOLLARS in SIX MONTHS any more.  That dream is dead for
 me now--dead like a leaf in autumn, falling from a tree into a pile of dog
 crap in the yard, waiting to get stepped in and tracked all over the house.
 I don't need this abuse from you.  Besides, I just got hold of a CD full of
 information on HOW TO FIND OUT ANYTHING ABOUT ANYONE!  It's been BANNED ON
 EBAY and THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT IT!!!!  I'm about to
 send out another offer to a different, carefully-selected group of 3.4
 million email addresses--maybe they'll be kind to a friendly spammer, and
 maybe they won't.  Heck-fire, all I've got in this kooky ol' world is my
 dreams, my wishes, and my HOW TO FIND OUT ANYTHING ABOUT ANYONE! offer--and
 I've got my can-do spirit.

        Oh, and I've also got an AMAZING OFFER FOR VIAGRA AT A 75%
 DISCOUNT!!!!!!!! too.
