        he walks into E building and makes his way over to the pepsi vending
 machine for a bottle of schwepps ginger ale.  he takes his wallet out of his
 right side pocket and opens it.  he pulls a crisp one dollar bill from the
 layers of bills.  george smiles at him as he slides the dollar in the slot
 of the vending machine.  the dollar goes all the way inside and then comes
 back out a second later.  he pulls the dollar out and there's another dollar
 underneath it.

        "what the fuck?", he whispers.

        the attractive blonde on the couch to the right looks at him as if he
 were insane.  what the fuck does she know anyhow?  read your teen style
 magazine wench!  read on!

        but i digress...

        he straightens his original dollar and makes sure it is facing the
 right way.  he puts it into the slot of the vending machine and it comes
 back out a second later.  so he decides to try the second dollar that popped
 out of the machine instead.  he straightens it, makes sure its facing the
 right way, and slides it in.  it stays in.  yes!  he presses the button on
 the right side of the machine that shows his beverage of choice, schwepps
 ginger ale, and...

        NOTHING.

        he thinks, "hmmm, oh well, it was a free dollar anyhow."  he then
 puts his original dollar into the money slot and it comes back out a second
 later with the other dollar underneath it.

        "you fucking cunt!"

        he looks to the right.

        "no, not you."

        he decides to walk over to the cafeteria for his fucking ginger ale.
