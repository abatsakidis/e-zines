 DISCLAIMER - There's probably a real name for the condition and someone has
 probably used the phrase "Hamlet Syndrome" before, but that's too bad cause
 this is The BMC and what I say is law.


 -introduction-

        Ok, I know teen angst is real and I know that indecisiveness is real.
 I have gone through it many times and I by no means want to make light of
 it, but I find it to be very frustrating, especially when I see it in other
 people.

        How can you convince someone that the reason they feel alone is
 because there is only one consciousness within their body and that is ok?
 Yeah everybody is alone, but you have to deal with that and please yourself.
 Pleasing yourself is not difficult.  Start by masturbating.  As you come,
 keep in mind that although you will never share the same body as someone
 else.   You'll never get treated like a mothered infant again.  Is that ok?
 Is it ok to grow up and realize you're never going back in your mom's tummy?
 I hope so for your sake because this is the path we must all travel in life.
 We all have to accept that at some time.  So to the devil with your
 complaints about being alone!  We are all alone, get used to the idea.  Hey,
 is it any consolation that everyone can deal with your feeling of being
 alone?  We are all united by that feeling.

        Is your problem that you worry too much and never seem to get
 anything done?  Well here is the solution.  Take some of that time that you
 spend obsessing and spend it working on the things you are obsessing about.
 After doing this three or four times you will notice that there are not as
 many problems and you have fewer stomach problems from devoting more than
 half of your time to stressing out.

        I read this once and I'm going to pretend it is a quote even though
 it is loosely paraphrased from the original.  "If you spend too much time
 thinking about the future and past you should ask yourself if you are
 actually living in the real world."

        Are you trying to "find yourself?"  Well you're not going to do it by
 running away.  You're not going to do it through analysis.  You're not going
 to meet some magical person to find you.  The key is to stop looking.  Who
 gives a shit if you find yourself or not?  Stop wasting your life and make
 it count.  Make it feel good.  Do what you want to do and stop worrying
 about what might happen.  If you live in the present you will never be
 disappointed with yourself!

        If you're so smart, why aren't you happy?  It seems to me that the
 smart thing to do would be to blind yourself to whatever your source of pain
 is.  Maybe I'm just stupid for being happy though.

 -summary-

        Hamlet couldn't even kill his uncle because he spent too much time
 thinking about the plusses and minuses.  If he would have spent about a
 minute of that time killing his uncle everything would have been ok and he
 would have been King of Denmark.  But then I guess we wouldn't have a kick-
 ass play.  A tragic play.  If you want to live life as a tragedy that's your
 choice.  Just remember that you don't have an audience.
