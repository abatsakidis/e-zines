        So the Olympics are over.  Oh boy.  I have to ask: What was the
 point?

        I could just about understand it in the '50s or something but now no
 way.  Who's taking drugs?  Or rather, who's not?  And then there's the
 corruption.  The International Olympic Committee was set up by Juan Antonio
 Samaranch (well that's how you SAY his surname anyway) exclusively for the
 furtherance of his financial income.  All the money that comes from sponsors
 like Coke and other junk food providers goes straight to the IOC.  And then
 where does it go?  Who the fuck knows, they never publish accounts.

        Who do the IOC report to?  No one.  Who appoints the members?  Juan
 Spanish-Jimmy-Hoffa.  Who can make the IOC reveal anything about what they
 do with the money?  No fucker.

        All right, full marks to him for fleecing the global conglomerates
 who supply heart disease wrapped in logos but they also make money from
 ticket sales based on people watching junkies race each other.  I would
 personally write off the last 20 years worth of medal placings for all they
 are worth.

        That's one reason (and a pretty good one at that) for hating the
 Olympics.  Then there's just the general pointlessness of it.  Who the fuck
 cares how fast one bloke can run.  What's that achieving?  These people
 don't run for their country; they run for themselves, for their egos.
 Anyone who says different is talking shit.

        They are selfish bastards.  They spend their entire lives doing
 nothing but training to the exclusion of anyone or anything else and instead
 of doing something worthwhile like having a proper job, they throw sticks or
 jump into sand.

        You might say the same about artists but they have interesting
 messages and can cause huge cultural shifts, look at Rock'n'Roll.  Athletes
 just cause huge shifts in money between themselves and drug dealers.  Even
 in Communist countries.  I nearly required an operation to close my gaping
 mouth again when I saw those Chinese "female" swimmers!  They should have
 been sponsored by Gillette.  Yeah, OK, they got banned but that's just 'cos
 they got caught.

        OK, athletics is good for keeping fit.  Fine.  But don't spend your
 life doing it!  It is not fun to watch someone run faster than you for
 money.  He can only run fast because he's trained day in day out for years.
 Of course he's gonna run faster than you!  If I practised the discus for
 long enough, and took enough drugs, I'd be able to throw it a fucking long
 way but I can't be bothered.  So don't expect me to be impressed when I see
 someone else do it instead.

        You know that 5 ring symbol?  To me it's the 5 "O"s: Organised,
 Overblown, On-the-take, Onanist and On-my-tits.
