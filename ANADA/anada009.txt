        Well, I was asked to write a rant about whatever the hell I wanted
 to, so here I am.  You have gotta be really bored if you're reading it, but
 anyway.

        Since I'm writing this, first, and I know how I am, there will be
 lots of swearing and words people might find offensive.  If your an anal
 type person, fuck off now because I fully intend to piss off everyone.  I
 also intend to make fun of and/or complain about everything, so thank you,
 please drive through...

        Hmmm, what the fuck to start this rant about... that is a good
 question, I'm glad you asked... I have no idea.  Perhaps I could bitch about
 all the dirty Mexicans running across the border.  Mind you, I'm Canadian,
 but still the fucking rejects shouldn't do it.  Simply what they need to do
 is cover that area in landmines, then if they make it through alive, let
 them stay.  Mind you, no one would so the world would be better off without
 them, considering the spics are getting just as bad as the blacks when it
 comes to gangs and such.  Now I'm no racist, I just use the terms, so don't
 even fucking bother bitching at me about it.  I warned you before you
 started reading, so piss off then.

        Anywho, back to the rant.  As I was saying, your country is overrun
 with people who shouldn't be there: doing crime, living on government money
 because they're too lazy to work.  They complain they have no money, yet
 they wont work, mainly because they know they would be deported back to
 their own shithole.

        And look at your jail system.  You get sentenced to die, it's like,
 what, 20 years before you die?  Fuck that.  Be like China: you're found
 guilty, you die within a few weeks, and your family gets billed for the
 bullet.  That's how you must do it.  If a few people who are innocent must
 die in order to keep the peace and so people can walk down the street, so be
 it.  I say, you might agree, you might not, I don't care.  This isn't a
 discussion.

        Now, I think people should die for their crimes.  I wish they did in
 Canada.  Why waste prison space for a reject who, if ever let out, would do
 as he has before like most of them?  They rape, kill, steal, etc., and your
 lame-ass system keeps letting them out so they can ruin more lives.

        "They might have done crime, but they're people too and deserve
 rights," you say.  Well, to you people I say, Go fuck yourselves.  Have you
 ever been gang raped?  Ever had a family member killed in cold blood and/or
 raped as well?  Ever had your kids molested?  Ever had your kid kidnapped,
 beaten and raped?  No, most of you haven't.  You're just a bunch of assholes
 with money and free time and need a reason to fuckin whine because you have
 nothing better to do.  You don't have a reason to complain.  If you do a
 crime, you should have no fucking rights.  You give up the rights the second
 you commit a crime.  Simple families suffer because people gave the criminal
 too many rights.  Their loved one has been taken from them and they have no
 rights at all, yet the person that did the killing has the rights.  Now I
 ask you, how the fuck is this fair?  They deserve to die for all the crimes
 I listed earlier.

        And if you feel differently, FUCK OFF ASSHOLE.  It's people like you
 that help make the world as shitty as it is by your whining and bitching.
 Open your fucking eyes and clue in to the world around you.  Stand up for
 the victims, not the criminals.  Just pull your fucking heads out of your
 assholes and have a look at the real world, not the one you live in...

        Case in point: you stupid fucks who chain yourselves to trees so the
 loggers can't get to work.  Wake the fuck up.  They plant a lot more then
 they cut down, and people need places to live.  People need to work.  They
 have families to feed and bills to pay.  Why don't you stop living off of
 mommy and daddy and get a real fucking job for once.  See how tough the
 world is when you're not living off of mommy and daddy.  Then see how you
 would feel about it.  McDonald's kills cows for its meat, I don't see you
 chaining yourself to a cow in order to save its life when, in fact, it does
 feel pain, unlike a tree.  And NO you clueless fuck, trees aren't alive in
 the sense that humans or other animals are, so don't even fucking bother.

        You type of people make me sick.  You think you should run things.
 It should be your way... when your way is soo fucking stupid. It isn't war
 or hunger that would kill off the world.  Most of you have no clue what
 you're fighting for or why you're there.  Because others are there?  No
 other reason?  It's all bullshit.  Grow the fuck up and join the real
 fucking world, you sorry excuses for people.  You know who you are.

        Now, the government: your laws and judicial system are soooo fucked
 up, it doesn't know if it's coming or going.  You send money to the reject
 third world countries because they're hungry.  What about your own people?
 Canada I know spends more sending money to others for food then it spends on
 its own people who are hungry and homeless, which is just fucking stupid in
 so many ways.  Worry about your own people before you worry about others.
 Your people need it just as much as others, yet they get nothing.  But what
 can you do, huh?  Nothing I suppose, 'tis the way of the world now.

        If you're still reading, I'm sure you're rather bored, so I'll end
 rant one now.  But this is only a start; there will be many more to come.
 You can be sure of this.  You can flame me or whatever you feel you need to
 do because of my views; I don't really care at all.  If you think there's
 something wrong with anything I've said, then you're one of the people wrong
 with this world.

        Until next time: Fuck off, all of you assholes who are fucking things
 up for the common person and hard workers of this world.
