 questions

 What happens when I fall *out* of love for the first time?
 How does it feel to be *truly* accepted?
 When can I *stop* laughing?
 Why am *I* the one getting over it?
 Where does the path I *don't* choose lead?

 answers

 You can't.
 You won't.
 You tried.
 You know.
 You failed.

 comments

 all of it makes me so sad
 to know of the thoughts
 to remember the days
 to experience the hate
 to repair the damage
