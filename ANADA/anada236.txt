 This story is one i wrote a couple summers back....


 I, Claudyi (Claw Dee I)


        The Air of Cold is only what it seems...(Langley, Poem 6, Book of 
 Indifference)

        ORatory 1 - When things happen, it's for a reason.  Thus the tragic
 story of Claudyi.  WEep if u will, but bear in mind things that will set off
 the bone of funny, or the horn of plenty.  The story you are about to read
 may be in play form of just read form.. YOU DECIDE...

        Segment 1 - PIcture yourself in a warm cheese factory.  Here is the
 first of the proceedings.

 Said Hambone: I have been shot

 Replied Claudyi: Sure you have.

 SAid Hambone: But I have. BElieve me.

 REplied Claudyi: THings arent what they seem my dear Hambone.  Macaroni and
                  cheese is the only way.

        I am sorry.  This story is nothing but fooling and noodling around.
 NOw I will really tell the story starting now>?>>>>.....

        Oratory 2 - WEll the past proceedings certainly explained nothing.
 But they have an important effect on no one.  Disregarding what I have just
 said, let's continue no? he he he hahah ahhha

        Segment 2 - the action is now taking place in a cirus

 Cladyi: Ohh woeth me! I have none of what is to be!

 Yuki: What ever is wrong my dear?

 Cladyi: OHh gracious even the pigs! I am nothing!

 Yuki: Should we do what is right? I have nothing left to give but my self! I
       am sorry!

 Cladyi: YOu are now punished! Make me a samich bits!

        Subdivison 1 - WE will now take a contemplation break.  Think of what
 you've done and why you've done it.

             AFterwards

        well that is all of the story i had written.  I dont know why i never
 finished it.  But let is stand as a testament to the cheddar monkey and all 
 it stands for.

             good bye my friends and till next time
