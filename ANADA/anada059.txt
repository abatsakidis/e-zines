 KRUEGER'S POEM

 I ran to you
 With tears in my eyes you engulfed me
 Close in your arms my fears faded
 And words that promised every thing would be alright
 You silenced my rage, fulfilled all desires
 My shinning prince in common clothes
 At any point you were all i needed
 you saved me from myself


 FUCKED

 I hate you because you used me and hurt me
 You lied, I thought you cared
 And I want to rip your heart out the way you did mine
 Then maybe I'll feel better
 I want to find someone new the way you did
 I'll make promises and break them, like you
 Maybe then I'll feel better, or not 

 And I love you for all that you said
 How I can run to you and you make it all better
 Because you are my savior
 And you held me close
 I thought you cared
 I wanna be with you so badly

 Knowing all this, you used me 
 And you fucked me
 But I love you and I thought you loved me too
 I thought you'd always be there
 But you're not
 And I hate you
 You brought me all this pain
 Lead to believe all your lies
 Fucked me over and over again


 EVIL TEASE

 I want to kiss every inch of your body
 Fell your hand inside mine
 Tight in your arms
 Hold me closer closer
 Until I can't breath
 And I'm suffocating within you
 Our hearts beat as one
 Because I love you 
 But you don't
 It's all a lie
 Yet I can't cuz it feels to good to 
 Ever Let Go


 KANSAS

 Paint a picture
 of endless hours spent lying in your arms
 Walking hand in hand 
 through the sacred garden
 The sun
 warms our naked shoulders
 A scent of roses
 forever lingers in the air
 Colors of pink and violet
 dance on the horizon
 With a stretching blue sky
 that cures all sadness in my heart
 No one 
 can harm us now
 No one 
 can hurt us here
