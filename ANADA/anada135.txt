        This is how written language works:

        writer-->intention-->medium-->reader-->meaning

        meaning comes from the reader

        because of this, all that shit they tell you in High School and
 College about the meaning of some old fart's works like Charles Dickens or
 J.D. Salinger, or Robert Frost or Anne Sexton (ha, I wrote sex) is total
 bullshit.  Meaning comes from you, and fuck whatever Anne Sexton thought I
 was reading, because her name had sex in it, her work must.  I'll find it
 even if she didn't put it there.  Here's a good example.

        Poem #666

        Where is God?  Where is Satan?  Who is Bill Clintion?

        that's the entire poem.  I think you've already assumed that the poem
 number had relevance to the poem, and that somehow God and Satan or maybe
 just Satan is applied to bill clinton.  HA!!

        I wish I could Show you this thing I have, but It'd have to be
 scanned and that's a pain in the ass.  basically, I took a piece of computer
 paper and wrote the word "SEX" in huge bold letters on the top of it.  then
 I drew some random lines and squiggles and shit to make it look kind of like
 writing, except that it was random.  I then gave the paper to a girl and
 asked her what it said.  She said the random letters meant "Lick Jenny".

        I realize that maybe now you're thinking "well, she was just fucking
 around with you".

        I assure she was not, I did the experiment in several different ways,
 and I even saw in the random lines what she did to form those words.

        interesting.

        so, I hope I"ve established that meaning comes from the reader.

        Charles Dickens wrote some Really boring shit. really really boring
 shit.

        I think eastern and western philosophy are so different because they
 were developed using languages which expressed different things.  If you
 taught someone from birth, english, and gave them no contact with the world,
 but taught them english and based the meaning of every word on another word,
 they would be able to speak with you about anything, but if you gave them a
 shoe they wouldn't know what the fuck it was.

        Kind of like helen keller.  Language was just a "game" to her until
 she found out what water was.

        Language is funny in that way.  it's just a label for actual things.
 they're horrible labels too.

        you'll never be able to think things that can't be expressed by
 english.

        funny thought.  the more you eliminate english, the broader your
 horizons, even though I kind of defeat that by writing this.  funny topic, I
 wrote a short story about it you might be able to see in the future.

        labels for everything.  they're inaccurate and I just labeled them
 (them's a label for something too).  That's why I get pissed off about the
 philosophy club at my school. they say: well, what's better: living in
 nature or living "synthetically".

        that's a bunch of bullshit.  better is subjective, ill defined, and
 even the definition will be ill defined into a loop or infinity.

        natural is a label for some subjective concept of nature.  ill
 defined. ill defined.

        definition is a label of expansion of meaning.  another label.
 stupid.

        synthetically:who the fuck can say what is synthetic.  another label
 to a subjective concept.  that's why I hated the class. so friggin' fruity.
 composed by a bunch of flakes who think they have something going.  I just
 labeled them. I don't care, all I know is I don't like them and in the end I
 will beat them.  After I figure out a way to call them stupid without
 calling them stupid.  kind of like a politician.

        interviewer: Politician, what is your name?

        Politician: Well, my name is 3 words composed of letters.  I plan to
                    revonate my name and give names to everyone with a low
                    rate of tax.

        stupid.

        stupid backwards is diputs.

        if you minus the us from diputs you  get dipt

        if you at a shi to it, it's dipshit. funny.

        then next time someone tells you you didn't understand something that
 was written down, GIVE THEM THE FINGER!!!!!!!!!

        meaning comes from the reader.

        I know this.  a girl sent me a wonderful note which said exactly what
 I just said in different words.  i didn't capture the intention of the
 writer and I thought it was flaky, but THAT DOESN"T MATTER.

        i figured it out on my own anyway.  language is a fickle bitch.

        this is because every word comes with a different connotation for
 every person so 10 people could read this poem:

        SEX

        ORGASM

        and have different feelings about it.  even though the writer had a
 certain intention.

        fuck you, old fart teachers of AP ENGLISH.  you try to ruin poetry
 for everyone.  skanchen my ass. it's all subjective.

        my meaning is wrong?  fuck you.

        meet mr. BIRDY

        hahaha, that's right, my finger's up and it says FUCK YOU

        and that's not subjective.
