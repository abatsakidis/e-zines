        I gotta say, as far as brains go, mine is pretty darn adequate.  I
 can work at mindless tasks, for all appearances completely involved in
 whatever I'm doing.  Deep inside the dark recesses of my brain that has only
 seen the light of day once (and that was messy), flywheels of free
 association are spinning out of control.  Every once in a while, enough
 stray thoughts lock into place to form a single coherent picture.  It
 doesn't happen often, but when it does, I just have to write about it.

        My mind has been multi-tasking on the common sense-defying enigma
 that is communism for weeks now, ever since I went out with that bisexual
 communist chick.  No, I didn't get any -- she was all red (I KILL me!).
 Besides pointing out that it flies in the face of human nature, the laws of
 economics, and is basically a watered down version of Christian utopia, I
 have been struck with yet ANOTHER insight.

        I have determined that Communism and its sickly anemic brother,
 socialism, are modernizations of good old-fashioned anti-Semitism.

        "How the hell do you figure that?" one of the heathens in the back
 exclaims.

        It's no secret that Jews have been persecuted probably more than any
 ethnic or religious group in history, subject to repeated pogroms,
 expulsions, and mass slaughter.  Why is that?  Sure, they were a different
 religion and a different culture diluted amongst the xenophobic peoples of
 Medieval Europe, and those were contributing factors.

        The thing that set them apart form the other peoples of Europe,
 though, was that they took education very seriously and had a powerful work
 ethic.  In an age when a good Christian was not allowed to make a profit of
 any kind, Jews, the infidels, were the only ones who had an incentive to go
 into business.  As a result, they became relatively wealthy.  The peasants
 and nobles didn't like it, and often decided to "redistribute the wealth".
 Even after the Protestant Reformation made it OK to make money, Jews still
 had the cultural emphasis on education and did better.  People still didn't
 like it, either.

        "OK, fine," says the dumbass in the back, "but what's that got to do
 with Communism?"

        The mentality of modern Communists and old-time Jew haters is
 basically the same: take the wealth away from those who actually EARNED it
 and give it to the slackers.  The arguments are the same, too.  Jews and
 capitalists secretly conspire to run the world, they profit by keeping
 others poor, and that they actively exploit the poor helpless mediocretins.

        The average person seems to have an irrational resentment toward
 anyone who earns a fortune by the sweat of their own back.  Ironically, they
 didn't seem to mind the nobles who killed them regularly nearly as much as
 they hated the commoner who earned his wealth.  I suspect that they felt
 that since the nobility was practically a different race of human, they
 figure they could never achieve that level of wealth, so they're OK with
 that.  When one of their own gets some bucks, it points out what lazy sots
 they are and that burns their little egos.  If the rich person happens to be
 different in any way, so much the better.

        OK, that last paragraph is largely conjecture that requires more
 research, but the central point remains the same: Some people just HATE it
 when their peers do better than they do.  An illustrative modern scenario is
 the black business person who is victimized by his fellow blacks just
 because he or she being successful.  Of course this mentality is not limited
 to blacks, but that example particularly annoys me.  I think that that
 adequately explains why a bunch of numbskulls would follow the misanthropic
 teachings of the Champion of the Working Class who never held a job in his
 entire friggin' life.

        So stick that in your sock and smoke it, commies!
