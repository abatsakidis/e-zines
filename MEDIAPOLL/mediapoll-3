NET COVERAGE: THE UNHOLY TRYST

This week's "poll" was prompted by a reader who suggested we follow up on 
her impression that an unusually high number of articles about the 
Internet seem to focus on "certain negative, sensationalist topics" such 
as "sex, pedophiles, terrorists, and censorship."  The media, if this is 
true, seems capable of only finding the bad stuff interesting, making the 
Internet Story one where crime and/or prurience meet data communications 
in the ultimate unholy tryst of convenience.  

OF COURSE, THERE IS TRUTH in this Story.  My entirely clinical research 
for this column showed that porn is just around the corner anywhere you 
go on the Net.  I found that if you do a keyword search using a service 
like InfoSeek for some kind of vaguely sex-related term, not only will 
you get a ginormous amount of the filthiest hits you ever saw, you'll also 
get instant ads popping up on the screen touting HARDCORE this and 
UNCENSORED that.  Seems logical now, but five years ago few Net gurus 
would have forecast that cyberporn would become *the* killer Internet 
application second only to e-mail.  [Certainly it's one of the market 
drivers behind the whole WebTV gamble.] 

I'm sure our correspondent would admit that since certain old-fashioned 
barriers to becoming a pornography consumer, such as having to be seen in 
public requesting and paying for socially unacceptable magazines and 
videos, do not exist on the Net and therefore have encouraged a prolific 
new distribution channel for the industry.  And wouldn't you agree that 
so-called "chat rooms" and unmonitored bulletin boards make it easier for 
child molesters and stalkers to at least initiate their sordid projects?

THE FLIP SIDE, of course, is that this is all "just around the corner" in 
the real world as well, in more or less the same proportion, and that 
talking up sleaze and negativity on the Net is just as 
sensationalistically skewed as the damning of television for ruining 
society or blaming Ice T for the poor relations between police and 
inner-city youth. [I heard that "Cop Killer" is being banned again 
somewhere, which will surely do nothing but keep it from being deleted 
from the record company's back catalogue even longer.] 

But is it true?  Can our correspondent's "impression" be substantiated by 
cold hard facts?  Let us throw the switch on the Media Poll machine, 
using the usual limitations (top 50 U.S. newspapers). . . .

The first column (after the year indicator) lists the number of articles 
mentioning "Internet" or "World Wide Web".  The next column lists the 
number of articles mentioning one of those terms AND words such as sex, 
pornography, censorship, terrorism, etc.  The last column indicates the 
percentage of such stories in relation to the total.

       Internet      Internet         Sleaze 
       etc.          + "negative"     Quotient
                     term(s)
-----------------------------------------------
1993    1,527          199             13%
1994   10,111        1,061             10%
1995   36,826        4,461             12%
1996   71,942        7,206             10%


Do you find it at all troubling that one out of every ten articles that 
mention the Internet in our largest circulating newspapers also mention 
one of our designated "negative" terms?  Does that mean only nine 
concentrate on the "positive" - i.e., the revolutionary effect the Net 
has had on science, education, libraries, news, mass communications, the 
software and computer hardware industries, and personal communications?  
Let's not get alarmed yet.  Analyzing the data for trends, one is struck 
by the rock solidity of the sleaze quotient.  Even back in 1993 when the 
porn-friendly Web was still under development, roughly the same 
percentage of articles about the Net couldn't stay away from the more 
difficult and seamy aspects of the medium as last year.  It is certainly 
significant that despite the wild growth in total coverage, this 
sub-sector of media Net coverage held its ground.  True, there were over 
7,000 "negative" Internet stories last year compared to just 1,000 in 
1994, and that may be what is creating the impression that they're out of 
control, but the full context should be noted: at least the sleaze 
quotient isn't growing, and 10% isn't that bad, is it?

BUT IS THIS SAMPLE realistic?  Just how many of these "Internet" stories 
are really about the Internet?  A free-text search can't predict relevance 
too well:  half of these stories might have only barely mentioned the Net 
in a throwaway reference.  They could be about anything.

So let's look at our sample again and zero in on those articles where 
"Internet" or "World Wide Web" are in the *headline* of the article--this 
should limit the pool to stories actually focusing on the Net:

       Internet      Internet +      Sleaze 
       etc. in       "negative"      Quotient
       headline      term(s)
-----------------------------------------------
1993      166           29             17%
1994    1,245          145             12%
1995    4,631          714             15%
1996    7,489        1,093             15%


With this better-focused sample we notice two things:  

1)  The Sleaze Quotient is just as steady as before
2)  The Sleaze Quotient is even higher!

Things may not be getting worse every year, but 15% is enough to make you 
think.  Fifteen percent.  What's that, one out of seven?  Dear readers: I 
leave further analysis up to you.  Dear journalists: is that the best you 
can do?

THE MEDIA POLL 10:  GENERIC CELEBRITIES

I have a thing about "generic celebrities."  Not much of a thing.  It's 
just that sometime during the 1980s I noticed there seemed to be a 
generic celebrity of the year--or even month--usually the product of some 
media-saturated scandal or other. And after the new celebrity's scandal 
died down, he or she remained on the public stage for some time longer 
due to his or her firm impression onto the soft clay that makes up the 
collective American psyche:  Donna Rice, Tammy Faye Bakker, Leona 
Helmsley, Oliver North's secretary whose name I can't believe I've 
forgotten*, Oliver North himself.  Many of these personalities have 
nearly faded away completely from the spotlight, but the 1990s have made 
sure we're not in short supply, producing Tonya Harding, the Bobbits, 
Gennifer Flowers, and Richard Jewel.  

BUT LATELY my definition of the term has been changing as I recognize 
another class of generic celebrity.  These are the people whose celebrity 
is so great (as in large, massive, *gros*) that it cannot be classified 
in any one category of fame, such as politician, entertainer, athlete.  
These people may have been actors or sportsmen at one time--and that is 
how they developed their fame--but since then they have transcended their 
original fields of endeavor and are now more famous simply for being 
famous.  They are distinguished from the people in the first paragraph by 
the fact that they did at one time actually *do* something for which they 
were *celebrated* (well, most of them did, anyway).  But like the purely 
sensationalist media personalities above, they are either on TV all the 
time or they are *talked about* on TV all the time because they are 
*beyond* TV.  (Some are the punchlines of jokes every night on late night 
TV.)  Can O.J. be called just an ex-football player anymore?  To call 
Oprah Winfrey a talk show host is really far from accurate.  And Martha 
Stewart and Richard Simmons:  just what the hell are their jobs, anyway? 
Below, then, is my 1996 list of Top Generic Celebrities.  Who would you 
have put on the list?

1996 Top 10 Generic Celebrities
(by number of mentions in the top 50 U.S. newspapers)
--------------------------------
Ross Perot              15,637
O.J. Simpson            14,393
Dennis Rodman           12,799
Madonna                  8,414
Michael Jackson          5,498
Jack Kevorkian           3,616
Larry King               3,319
Oprah Winfrey            3,271		
Martha Stewart           2,679
Mother Teresa            2,647
Howard Stern             1,788
Sarah Ferguson           1,196
Richard Simmons            459

YES, I KNOW, there are 13 people in this "Top 10."  This just goes to 
show how potent are the appearances of people like Howard Stern (11) and 
Richard Simmons (13):  they just seem to be in your face all the time.  
(On the other hand, maybe they are beasts of broadcasting whose print 
exposure doesn't measure up.)

Surely the top 5 listed here are no surprise.  Rodman (3) in particular 
has extended his reach deeply into the realm of generic celebrityhood.  A 
couple years ago he was Top 50, I'd say, and now he's easily Top 3, getting 
52% more coverage than his ex-girlfriend and headline default setting 
Madonna (4).  What's truly scary, though, are the Top 3's relation to the 
total number of articles published *on anything* in 1996.  

THERE WERE, according to my sources (the DataTimes news database 
service), 2,784,239 articles published in the top 50 U.S. newspapers last 
year.  This means that Dennis Rodman actually appeared in 0.4597% of 
*all* articles published in 1996. And that the Worm infests itself into 
just about *one out of every 200 articles* published. Same thing for H. 
Ross (1) and O.J. (2).

Meaning?

Richard Simmons' braying ubiquity may be limited to TV, but our 10's 
dominance over the morning read is undeniable.  Add up all the numbers 
above and one of these people that are famous just for being famous is in 
one out of every 40 news items.  For every 40 headlines, for every 40 
leads, soon to follow, inevitably, like The Partridge Family after The 
Brady Bunch, will be Jack or Oprah or Larry or one of their MP10 kin, 
there, and there, just because they're there. . .

NOTE TO READERS

The "You Heard it There First" and "Popular Arts in Review" features will 
follow in future columns.  If you hadn't yet noticed, my publishing 
schedule is fluid, so ignoring arbitrary deadlines should result in 
better and more frequent, if shorter and less diverse, columns.

Note to Bandwidth Police and Content Cops:  

Very shortly I will stop posting the full text of The Media Poll on 
(relevant) newsgroups and will provide just headlines and a pointer to a 
soon-to-be-functioning web site.  In the meantime, I trust this modest 
and infrequent column hasn't overwhelmed anyone's resources (or patience).
