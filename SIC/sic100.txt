Souls in Chaos 
Issue 1.00 Beta 

Created by Xar



Welp you finally downloaded this zine if that's what you call it .. its 4:55am
stoned out of our skulls on  everclear me (me = Xar ) and Cnaw decide to
make a zine what a great fucking idea  , but what the fuck do we put in this
zine ???? welp the fucking crap i write , yeah all the suff i write which make
no sense, or if my stuff can be called prose then let me fuck Hitler.

Hmmmmm do any one of you out there reading this want to know why we named
this zine souls in chaos ??? welp its because after a lot of everclear
and some other stuff ;)  that's how your soul is , that is if i still have
one , i tried to sell my soul but no damm fucker wanted to buy it even after
i put up an advert to sell my soul at 50% discount.

Come to think of it why don't some of us put adverts in newspapers
that our soul is for sale , that would make the classified section look like

Hmmmm why the fuck did i write that piece of shit i cant fucking write
to get a fuck from a babe ..(sorry to all those women who are not babes )
come to think of it i have sexual desires to go and fuck a dog at  least its
going to be better than some cunts.

Let me bore you for a while before you delete this zine and forget all about
souls in chaos .. yeah as if i plan to make another issue ( i will if someone
tells me this zine fucks to hell, i like pissing people off  ).. AT&T fucked
me with another massive phone bill , so what's new in my sorry life NOTHING.
To all those people out there who think their life sucks want to trade, i
am so fucked up that if i needed to pay to shit i would rather puke.

I have a question to all those smart people out there i.e. all those who can
count to 100 .. its about your local  7-11 store ... now if 7-11 is open 24hrs
a day 365 days a year .. why the fuck do they have locks on their doors for
that matter why do they have doors , the fucking 7-11 is still going to be
open , they never close and still rip you off when you buy a pack of cigs. If
you have the answer and want to put a soul out of misery e-mail me the answer
at the address at the end of this zine ( Hopefully someone is going to read
the stuff between his paragraph and the end).


Still reading wow you must be nuts , come to think of it the who fucking world
is nuts we  recycle cans and paper but still kill thousands rather odd don't
you think , fuck a can is has more value than a life as far as i am bothered
, right now i am destroying the earth by throwing my cans in the trash,
who the fuck cares we are all going to be six feet under no matter what ,
do you want to save the world for another generation that will fuck it up
even more ???? go ahead spend your time sorting trash and tried to be good
when a few years from now we will be testing chemical weapons in car parks.

Quote of the month

Dancing is a vertical expression of a horizontal intention

Cool one eh ... i think so and i don't really give a fuck if you think it
sucks , why because its my warped up brain and not yours be happy that your
not sitting in front of your text editor and typing shit so other people can
read it and know how stupid you are.


Things you can do today.
----------------------------------

1) Drink your piss

2) Piss in someone else's mouth 

3) Play with your self

4) Smoke 10 packs of cigs

5) Fail all your exams if you are in college , if not fuck your friends sister

6) While fucking your friends sister fuck your friend as well 

7) Drink everclear and rubbing alcohol ( this drink is called burnt dick fyi )

8) Stick a glock in your mouth and pull the trigger , so that you wont have
   to read this crap again

9) Tell your girlfriend / boyfriend that you love her and then go and fuck
   around

10) Wardail 1000 1-1800 number and piss AT&T off for me ;)
   (Hey it is a joke ok !!!)

If you still cant think of what to do today then go stick your dick in a plug
point to test the theory that you can conduct electricity.

And now that by brain is fried and i have no more crap to write and bore people
shitless , hear are some of the stuff  i write for fun .. yes my I.Q is 2 so
don't expect any thing good ... all the chants as i call them are written by
me when i am high so read on and barf.

Chants of XAR Vol. 1.00 

Copyright 1995 Kelvin Muthumani ( <--- who the fuck is this guy ???? !##$#$# )

Chaos In Power

Fallen Angels 
Meet they maker
Chaos is near
Fear is past
Land in darkness
Power rides
On the godly steed
Paper floats 
Power is now yours

Legion of Chaos

Over the world we ruled
Chapters of the book torn
What was not proper destroyed
Cursed at those who are not with us
Burn them , Destroy their minds
Say they are not who they are
Bow your heads low
For your time has come
The true one is become
Death is in your dreams
For your time has come


Rings

Rings on my finger
Rings in my head
Crafted of old
Cursed for those they hold
Visions for those that behold
The choice is yours
The path is mine 



Inner light

Shine in me 
Shine with me 
Show me the coven of the dead
The people who have destroyed you
You Burn them 
Learn the chants
Flame of Staten 
Flame that burns
Towards the master
He feeds your
Mind with the pages
Burn your soul for him
You have become one


I stand before thee

I stand before thee cold and naked
For eons i have searched
For the true god
What can you do now
What more can i do 
I have found you 
The gray one 
Spoken of in whispers
All knowing
What more can i say

Demon of my mind

World in pain 
Mind open for air
I turn to them in need
And forget them in power
Circle of black
Blood of my soul
Drop of sin
And the covenant is sold
For a second of peace
I have given them my soul

Remember your sins

Pray for forgiveness that you will not have
Chant from the book of books
Take the body drink the blood
Is this your peace
The chosen one stands
And points to you
Feel the rage of your souls
Sins not to be told
On earth we die
For nothing but a sin

Fallen Souls

For heaven they sold their souls
To see the glory they became blind
For escape from pain they closed their minds
For help they turned deaf
For voice they became silent
Now the test is near
They see their doom
Curses to the ones
Who did not follow 
For they are the ones that will see the light
Burn in Haven and rot in hell
For both are but one to become

Reversal of God

Hated by all
Thrown into the pit to rot
God comes upon them
In a black mist of sin
Choking mist
That  burns holes in your eyes
They bow low
To the master who as not forgotten 
He has come to rule
To hate and destroy
Voices chant in unison
Lord of the depts. you have come
To gives us life and pain
Chaos is thy name
Dog si  natas


Lord of the Mind

Visions of the lord
Ride in my head
Four demons on wings
Let sleep become by life
And sin my soul
They come upon you like sin
Burn your eyes and kiss your soul


Bow to the Master

Black demons ride into the winds
The chosen one is born
See the powers that he has
Demons old demons cold
Come and bow before  him
For your faith is sealed in his mind
The lord of lords has chosen him
Put the blood of the four on his chest
The gray ones will smile
Fires on the four points 
Incense burns for the godly one
Chant from the book of the Dead 
The four become one
To protect him from good
Cut your hand
Let it drip on his head
Pure blood ,black with the sins of mankind
The charts show the paths he will follow
Chant from the book of the god
Burn the pages 
Rub the ashes on his body
Cut is wrist and let it drip
Make the sign 
Bow your head low
Your duty is done
Your time is gone
The demons of black ride in the winds
For the chosen one has become


 More ???

Fight for you blood
Free your mind 
From the chains of  mankind
See the light 
See the paths 
Follow the one that leads
To the true one
No one can decide 
For the paths are there
And the choice is yours
