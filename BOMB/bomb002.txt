DOES A RECENT ADDITION TO YOUR WALLET INCLUDE A NEW MEAL
KARD?  DO YOU SPEND THE DAYS AND NIGHTS CONTEMPLATING HOW
TO KILL YOUR ROOMATE?  HAVE YOU MISSED MORE THEN FOUR
CLASSES IN THE LAST TWO DAYS?  THEN THIS FILE IS FOR
>>>>YOU<<<<<<<<<!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

here's some surefire ways to really piss off people in
a college enviroment.  we take no responsibility for what
may occur because of these events!!!!

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

NUMBER 1: when walking across campus, you no doubt see
a lot of people.  if you go to a school like mine, you'll
probably see eighty to ninety thousand people per day.  that's ok
because that makes this one really fun!

as you're walking around carrying your backpack and waiting
to go to class, eye out a person.  look around and find someone.
it doens't matter it they r male or female, just find someone.
follow them.  not too long, becuz you don't want them to
be suspicious.  just long enough to know that they rn't a
fed!

when you're sure that this person isn't a fed, line up about 20
feet behind them.  then run as fast as you can and tackle the
person.  the more people that are around, the better.  if you
can take out a number of people at the same time, the better!

now, after you tackle this person, punch them.  repeatedly.
just keep punching and punching.  if the person screams,
who cares?!@  there's nothing wrong with a little
resistance.  just take your fist and shove it in their mouth.
that's a surefire way to shut them up.

another surefire way to shut them up is to kill them!

hahahahah  hah hahhahahahaAHhahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!1

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  ::::::::::

NUMBER 2: take a gun.  shoot as many people as you can.
JUSt DON'T KILL ANY FEDS AND MAKE SURE NO FEDS SEE YOU.

it's simple.

::::::::::::::::::::::::: ::::::::::::::::::: ::::::::::::

number 3: it's almost like number 1, but not quite.

when you're in the dining hall, find someone (MAKE SURE THEY'RE
NOT A FED) and stand behind them on line.  after they get their
mashed potatoes and meatloaf suprise, follow them to the
silly vegan salad line.  after they get their soda, follow them
to their table.  the thing is, they're not getting to their
table!!! hahahaHAHahhahahah!!!

tackle them before they get there.  make sure you take out
a bunch of people and knock over other tables.  then hit
them over their head with your tray.  keep hitting them
until they die.  and then stand up and say, "HA HA.  SILLY
FRESHMAN DROPPED HIS FOOD AND DIED!!!!"  point and laugh
a lot.

::         :::::::::::::::::: : :: : : :::::::::::::::::

nUMBeR4: if you've got a work-study job, like in the admissions
office, this works great!

when you're finnaly fed up with everything, just sit there.  when
you're sure that none of the people you work with are fedz.
ok.  so you just sit there all calm-like and when nobody's expecting
it, just flip your desk and knock over everything.  make a big mess.
then kill your coworkers.

leave .. and then the next day, come in and say, "hey, what happened
here?  did somebody move my desk?"  it's a surefire hit around the office!!
it'll make a great dilbert strip!!!!!!!!!!!!

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

ok.  with those in mind, go piss off people!!!!!!!!!!!!!
