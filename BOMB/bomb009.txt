MrKoo410: hahahahha....
MrKoo410: naaaaaaah.
CountPip: why are you such an asshole to me?
CountPip: what have i ever done to you?
CountPip: WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE THIS KIND OF TREATMENT?
MrKoo410: HI!

CountPip: doud, i'm 22.
MrKoo410: im so glad i can say that without getting hit :)
CountPip: that's not all that old.
MrKoo410: i know, i just love to say yer a geizer :)
CountPip: my doctor told me not to hit people.
CountPip: too many lawsuits.
MrKoo410: hmmmm...
MrKoo410: alright....
MrKoo410: buttsex
CountPip: fuck off, wanker.
MrKoo410: buttsex
CountPip: eat the corn out of my shit.

CountPip: shut the fuck up, you peanut picking bastard.
MrKoo410: shut the fuck up, you penis picking bastard
CountPip: kevin, i'm not really in the mood.
CountPip: don't fuck with me, boy.
MrKoo410: what's yer sitch?
MrKoo410: boy?
CountPip: sitch?
CountPip: what kind of backwater term is that?
MrKoo410: are you going to iraq?
CountPip: hopefully not, considering that i'm not trained for ground 
combat.
CountPip: if i would be to go anywhere, it'd be oman (shit house) or 
saudi
          (slightly better shit house)
CountPip: but the chances of that are slim to none.
CountPip: well, EXCUSE ME for having at least a little angst.
MrKoo410: hmmmm....
MrKoo410: you want to go there eh?
CountPip: not in the least.
CountPip: those fucking rag heads can have their sand.
CountPip: i'm not about to die for some (censored)

CountPip: you know what i'm saying?...
MrKoo410: yes, (censored).
MrKoo410: stop being "that guy"

MrKoo410: what are YOU talking about?!
CountPip: man, i don't need to take this from a goddamn half baked jew.
MrKoo410: shut up you stupid mc
CountPip: i don't want to  hear any more of your jew lies.
MrKoo410: at least jesus isn't our lord!
MrKoo410: :)
CountPip: jesus is everybody's lord.
CountPip: you bagle eating jew bastard.
MrKoo410: yer very wrong in saying that.
MrKoo410: but i expect that (wrongness) from an irish catholic filthbag
MrKoo410: :-)
CountPip: listen, you haunakah celebrating, dradle spinning, matzoh 
eating
          piece of shit, you better shut your goddamned kosher piehole
          before i shove my steel toed boots of the klan down your

CountPip: i'm going to be the proud owner of every winamp skin/plugin 
known

CountPip: what do you think of that, jew.
MrKoo410: not much of it.
CountPip: hey, can i use our conversation for my zine?
CountPip: for 'bomb'
MrKoo410: as long as it's used in a negative way!
CountPip: of course it will be!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CountPip: i'm going to kill the sand nigger part (for c4) becaues i 
think he'd
          find it insulting to himself.
CountPip: i mean, REALLY... who would want to be associated with those 
rag
          heads anyways.
MrKoo410: i dunno man...they should be terminated.
CountPip: exactly, you should hear the shit we talk about in class =]
CountPip: we're all like ... talking about ethnic cleansing, but not 
directly.
MrKoo410: hahahahaa...i watched full metal jacket last night...and 
thought of

CountPip: awwwh!  actually, that movie is more like what kelly went 
through...

          wiffle ball bat.
MrKoo410: well, how are you gonna wrap your fingers around the bat when
          they're broken?
MrKoo410: and i think maybe at that point you should be holding a broom 
to
          sweep up yer teeth
CountPip: oh, so you're a funny boy now, eh?... FUNNY HA HA?
MrKoo410: oh now yer going to get the delusion that yer in the IRA arent
