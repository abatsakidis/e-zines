@SONG: Round Here
(Adam Duritz/Dave Janusko/Dan Jewett/Chris Roldan/David Bryson)

Step out the front door like a ghost
Into the fog where no one notices
The contrast of white on white

And in between the moon and you
The angels get a better view
Of the crumbling difference
Between wrong and right

I walk in the air between the rain
Through myself and back again
Where? I don't know

Maria says she's dying
Through the door I hear her crying
Why? I don't know

Round here we always stand up straight
Round here something radiates

Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
She walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
She parks her car outside my house
Takes her clothes off
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
She knows she's more than just a little misunderstood
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous

Round here we're carving out our names
Round here we all look the same
Round here we talk just like lions
But we sacrifice the lambs
Round here she's slipping through my hands

Sleeping children got to run like the wind
Out of the lightning dream
Mama's little baby better get herself in
Out of the lightning

She says, "It's only in my head."
She says, "Shhh...I know it's only in my head."

But the girl on the car in the parking lot says
"Man, yo ushould try to take a shot
Can't you see my walls are crumbling."

Then she looks up at the building
And says she's thinking of jumping
She says she's tired of life
She must be tired of something

Round here she's always on my mind
Round here I got lots of time
Round here we're never sent to bed early
Nobody makes us wait
Round here we stay up very late
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: Omaha
(Adam Duritz)

Start tearing the old man down
Run past the heather and down to the old road
Star turning the grain to the ground
Roll a new leaf over
In the middle of the night
There's an old man treading around in the gathered rain
Well mister, if you're going to walk on water
Could you drop a line my way?

CHORUS
Omaha
Somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of the matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you better turn your ticket in
And get your money back at the door

Start threading a needle
Brush past the shuttle that slides through the cold room
STart turning the wool across the wire
Roll a new life over
In the middle of the night
There's an old man threading his toes through a bucket of rain
hey mister, you don't want to walk on water
You're only going to walk all over me

CHORUS

Start running the banner down
Drop past the color
Comoe up through the summer rain
Start turning the girl into the ground
Roll a new love over
In the middle of the day
There's a young man rolling around in the earth and rain
Hey Mister, if you're going to walk on water
You know you're only going to walk all over me

CHORUS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: Mr. Jones
(Adam Duritz/David Bryson)

I was down at the New Amsterdam staring at this yellow-haired girl
Mr. Jones srikes up a coversation with this black-haired flamenco dancer
She dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
We all want something beautiful
I wish I was beautiful

So come dance this silence down through the morning
Cut up, Maria!
Show me some of them Spanish dances
Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
I want to be someone who believes

Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
Stare at the beautiful women
"She's looking at you.
Ah no, no, she's looking at me."
Smiling in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely

I will paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful
Gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me look into the future
Stare at the beautiful women
"She's looking at you.
Uh, I don't think so. She's looking at me."
Standing the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me I will enver be lonely

I want to be a lion
Everybody wants to pass as cats
We all want to be big, big stars, but we got different reasons for that
Believe in me, because I don't believe in anything
And I want to be someone to believe

Mr. Jones and me stumbling through the barrio
Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
"She's perfect for you, man, there's got to be somebody for me."
I want to be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody loves you, son, that's just about as funky as you can be

Mr. Jones and me staring at the video
When I look at the televison I want to see me staring right back at me
We all want to be big stars, but we don't know why and we don't know how
But when everybody loves me
I'm going to be just about as happy as can be
Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars...

@SONG: Perfect Blue Buildings
(Adam Duritz)

Just down the street from your hotel, baby
I stay at home with my disease
And ain't this position familiar, darling
Well, all monkeys do what they see
Help me stay awake, I'm falling

Down on Virginia and La Loma
Where I got friends who'll care for me
You got an attitude of everything I ever wanted
I got an attitude of need
Help me stay awake, I'm falling

CHORUS
Asleep in Perfect blue buildings
Beside the green apple sea
Gonna get me a little oblivion
Try to keep myself away from me

It's 4:30 a.m. on a Tuesday
It doesn't get much worse than this
In beds in little rooms in buildings
In the middle of these lives which are completely meaningless
Help me stay awake, I'm falling

CHORUS

I got bones beneath my skin and mister
There's a skeleton in every man's house
Beneath the dust and love and sweat that hangs on everybody
There's a dead man trying to get out
Please help me stay awake, I'm falling

CHORUS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: Anna Begins
(Adam Duritz/David Bryson/Marty Jones/Toby Hawkins/Lydia Holly)

My friend assures me, "It's all or nothing."
I am not worried
I am not overly concerned
My friend implores me, "For one time only,
Make an exception."
I am not worried
Wrap her up in a package of lies
Send her off to a coconut island
I am not worried
I am not overly concerned with the status of my emotions
"Oh," she says, "you're changing."
But we're always changing

It does not bother me to say this isn't love
Because if you don't want to talk about it then it isn't love
And I guess I'm going to have to live with that
But I'm sure there's something in a shade of grey
Something in between
And I can always change my name
If that's what you mean

My friend assures me, "It's all or nothing."
But I am not really worried
I am not overly concerned
You try to tell yourself the things you try to tell yourself
To make yourself forget
I am not worried
"If it's love," she said, "then we're going to have to 
Think about hte consequences."
She can't stop shaking
I can't stop touching her and

This time when kindness falls like rain
It washes her away and Anna begins to change her mind
"These second shen I'm shaking leave me shuddering for days," she says
And I'm not ready for this sort of thing

But I'm not going to break
And I'm not going to worry about it anymore
I'm not going to bend and I'm not going to break
And I'm not going to worry about it anymore
It seems like I should say, "As long as this is love..."
But it's not all that easy so maybe I should
Snap her up in a butterfly net
Pin her down on a photograph album
I am not worried
I've done this sort of thing before
But then I start to think about the consequences
Because I don't get no sleepin a quiet room and...

The time when kindness falls like rain
It washes me away and Anna begins to change my mind
And everytime she sneezes I believe it's love and
Oh Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

She's talking in her sleep
It's keeping me awake and
Anna begins to toss and turn 
And every word is nonsense but I understand and
Oh Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

Her kindness bangs a gong
It's moving me along and Anna begins to fade away
It's chasing me away
She disappears and
Oh Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: Time and Time Again
(Adam Duritz/David Bryson/Charlie Gillingham/Steve Bowman/Don Dixon)

I wanted so badly
Somebody other than me
Staring back at me
But you were gone

I wanted to see you waling backwards
And get the sensation of you coming home
I wanted to see you walking away from me
Without the sensation of you leaving me alone

CHORUS
Time and time again
Time and time again
Time and time again
I can't please myself

I wanted the ocean to cover over me
I wanna sink slowly without getting wet
Maybe someday I won't be so lonely
And I'll walk on water every chance I get

CHORUS

So when are you coming home
Sweet angel?
You leaving me alone?
All alone?
Well, if I'm drowning, darling, you'll come down this way on your own

I wish I was traveling on a freeway
Beneath the graveyard western sky
I'm gonna set fire to this city
And out into the desert we're gonna ride

CHORUS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: Rain King
(Adam Duritz/David Bryson)

When I think of heaen
(Deliver me in a black winged bird)
I think of lying down into a
Sea of pens and feathers and all 
Other instruments of faith and 
Sex and God in the belly of a black winged bird
Don't try to feed me
I've been here before and I deserve a little more

CHORUS
I belong in the service of the Queen
I belong anywhere but in between
She's been crying
I've been thinking
And I am the Rain King

Mama, why am I so alone?
I can't go outside
I'm scared I might not make it home
I'm alive but I'm sinking in
If there's anyone at home at your place
Why don't you invite me in?
Don't try to bleed me
I've been there before and I deserve a little more

I belong in the service of the Queen
I belong anywhere but in between
She's been lying
I've been sinking
And I am the Rain King

Hey, I only want the same as anyone
Henderson is waiting for the sun
Oh, it seems night endlessly begings and ends
After al lthe dreaming i come home again

ARE YOU REALLY READING THIS?

DO YOU REALLY LIKE THE COUNTING CROWS THIS MUCH?

I BET YOU READ HOE, YOU COCK SUCKING FAGGOT PUSSY BITCH MOTHERFUCKER.

I BET YOU DRAW ANSI STILL.  HAVEN'T YOU GROWN OUT OF YOUR

MOTHERFUCKING WANNBE HACKERS.  THEY'RE ALL ALIKE.  ANOTHER ONE

TOUCHES HIS LITTLE JIMMY WHEN HE SLEEPS.

THE COUNTING CROWS SUCK!!!!!!

When I think of heaven
(Deliver me in a black-winged bird)
I think of dying
Lay me down in a field of flame and heather
Render up my body into the burning heart of God 
In the belly of a black-winged bird
Don't try to bleed me
I've been here before and I deserve a little more

I belong in the service of the Queen
I belong anywhere but in between
She's been dying
I been drinking and I am the Rain King
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: Sullivan Street
(Adam Duritz/David Bryson)

Take the way home that leads back to Sullivan Street
Corss the water and home through the town
Past the shadows that fall down wherever we meet
Pretty soon I won't come around

I'm almost drowning in her sea
She's nearly fallen to her knees

Take the way home that leads back to Sullivan Street
Where all the bodies hang on the air
If she remembers, she hides it whenever we meet
Either way now, I don't really care

I'm almost drwoning in her seas
She's nearly crawling on her knees
She's down on her knees

Take the way home that leads back to Sullivan Street
I'm just another rider burned to the ground

I'm almost drowning in her seas
SHe's nearly crawling on her knees
It's almost everything I need
I'm down on my knees
I'm down on my knees
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: Ghost Train
(Adam Duritz)

I too kthe cannonball down to the ocean
Across the desert from sea to shinging sea
I rode a ladder the climbs across the nation
Fifty million feet of earth between the buried and me

CHORUS
"How do you do?"
She said, "Hey, how do you do?

SHe buys a ticket 'cause it's cold where she comes from
She climbs aboard because she's scared of getting older in the snow
Love is a ghost train rumbling through the darkness
Hold on to me darling I've got nowhere else to go

CHORUS

I took the cannonball down to the ocean
Watched the diesel disappear beneath the rumbling waves
Love is a ghost train howling on the radio
"Remember everything," she said, "when only memory remains."

CHORUS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: Raining in Baltimore
(Adam Duritz)

This circus is falling down on its knees
The big top is crumbling down
It'sraining in Baltiimore fifty miles east
Where you should be, no one's around

I need a phone call
I need a raincoat
I need a big love
I need a phone call

These train conversations are passing me by
And I don't have nothing to say
You get what you pay for
But I just had no intention of living this way

I need a phone call
I need a plane ride
I need a sunburn
I need a raincoat

And I get no answers
And I don't get no change
It's raining in Baltimore, baby
But everything else is the same

There's things I remember and things I forget
I miss you
I guess that I should
Three thousand five hundred miles away
But what would you change if you could?

I need a phone call
Maybe I should buy a new car
I can always hear a freight train
If I listen real hard
And I wish it was a small world
Because I'm lonely for the big towns
I'd like to hear a little guitar
I think it's time to put the top down

I need a phone call
I need a raincoat
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: A Murder of One
(Adam Duritz/Matt Malley/David Bryson)

Blue morning
Blue morning
Wrapped in strands of fist and bone
Curiosity, Kitten, doesn't have to mean you're on your own
You can look ouside your window
He doesn't have to know
We can talk awhile, baby
We can take it nice and slow

All your life is such a shame
All your love is jsut a dream

Are you happy where you're sleeping?
Does he keep you safe and warm?
Does he tell you when you're sorry?
Does he tell you when you're wrong?
I've been watching you for hours
It's been years since we were born
We were perfect when we started
I've been wondering where we've gone

All your life is such a shame
All your love is just a dream

I dreamt I saw you walking up a hillside in the snow
Casting shadows on the winter sky ans you stood there counting crows
One for sorrow
Two for joy
Thre for girls and four for boys
Five for silver
Six for gold and
Seven for a secret never to be told

There's a bird that nests inside you
Sleeping underneat your skin
When you opne up your wings to speak
I wish you'd let me in

All your life is such a shame
All your love is just a dream
Open up your eyes
You can see the flames of your wasted life
You should be ashamed

Yo udon't want to waste your life

I walk along the hillsides
In the summer 'neath the sunshine
I am feathered by the moonlight falling down off me

Change
