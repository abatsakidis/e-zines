issue 008 - "real letters from the inside #1" by the
            BOMB SQUAD

-------------------------------------------------------
shortly after our release, we recieved this email.  we're
printing anonymously, because we don't want neko to get in
trouble for bringing light the horrors of life on the
inside.

unfortunetely, we were wrong about the extent of the
conspiracy.  we were lead to believe that all of the hoe
writers knew of the conspiracy, but alas, they don't know.
this letter proves that.  mogel and ziego are friends and
are simply waiting for the right time to unleash their
capitalistic ideas.  some writers have been allowed to
know this.  but other writers, such as neko, are being
forced into believing otherwise.

if any hoe writer wants to come forth with their descriptions
of what it is like on the inside, please email us.  we'll help
you.  we'll take care of you and grant you freedom.  WE
CAN'T HELP YOU IF YOU DON'T COME TO US.

now, the anonymous letter:

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Dear BOMB Squad:

Let me tell you -- HOE is in very real danger!

I consider myself extremely lucky to get away from Ziego and his
mercenaries for five minutes to write this email.

They think I'm writing another tfile, but really I used this opportunity to
hack root on their linux box and telnet to my school email account to send
this.

Fortunately, all that hacking I got arresated for when I was 15 paid off.

Double fortunately, I have some random old shit on my shell here I can ftp
back to the 'new' hoe server for Ziego.

Damn he'll thunk I'm prolifc.

Anyway! Art, as you know, is dead.

Murmur -- well -- no one has seen him since the takeover. We assume he is
dead, but hope for the best!

In any case, this is no laughing matter! You are lucky -- you are on the
outside, you are in a position to make fun. As for myself and a dozen other
HoE writers, we are beaten and starved daily.

We are given food and water in proportion to the number of words we can
write daily. So if you've got writer's block, you're fucked.

& I'm not afraid to say it, you quite often are fucked. The HoE men are
taking it rather well, but I am concerned for the women of HoE -- condoms
are something Ziego's crew seems not to have heard of.

Maybe they've got AIDS and we can all day quickly and have this be ofer with.

ofuck z is coming!

SPREAD RTHE TRUTH
