"auslander liebe"

written in total by: rapeman

well, it's the day after i wrote the first issue and i already hate it.
i'm glad i have the opportunity to remedy that with this issue.  HELL, i'm 
the fucking publisher.  who's going to tell me i can't?  this issue is 
subtitled "auslander liebe" because not only do i think it sounds neat, but
it means "outlander love". i like it.
this issue is dedicated to my dog.

it is now two months later than the above date.  i've gotten REALLY fucking
lazy lately.  it's not that i have much to do.  i have NOTHING to do. just
know that i'm not writing this is february.
this issue is still dedicated to my dog.

btw, as you may notice, that is if you read the first issue, i've decided
to change the format.  i found the original scheme not only too long, but
far too limited.


"imagine hundreds of thousands of manchurian candidates, each programmed to
assassinate designated leaders and officials so that the aliens' hand-trained
agents can come forward." - paranoia magazine vol 3, no. 4, issue 11 


:AIDS AND THE AMERICAN WAY:
about a month ago, i had my first aids test.  that's some fun shit:  3 weeks
of building curiousity and paranoia.  so i was at planned parenthood reading  
some of those pamphlets when i saw that the projected percentage of people
with aids by the year 2012 was 72%.  with as many ignorant people we have on
this earth, that is not a surprising number.  i started thinking, "what going
to save the other 28%?"  extreme religious piety?  so is this who i am going 
to be left with?! THE FUCKING CHRISTIAN COALITION?! is this who is going to 
be running the country?  what a life our kids have to look forward to:
fascism and bible beating - the american dream.  also, i was just thinking: 
is aids going to be a demonstration of darwinism or an opposite, 
"retrodarwinism".  for instance, the survival of the fittest is a contest 
between the most intelligent and the most attractive; basically, "WHO IS
GOING TO BREED (FUCK)?".  the people who are breeding (fucking) are also the 
ones who have the most exposure to the aids virus.  so is this disease going 
to relieve us of our "finest" and leave us with the celibate (by choice or 
otherwise)?  hopefully, the best of our species will survive this onslaught,   
otherwise it looks like we have a bleak future.  can't you see it now:
the christian fascists leading the ignorant and unattractive masses.  I'm 
saving a cyanide capsule, specifically for that day.  the bastards...


*WEEZER, AS RELATED TO THE MONKEES*
ever notice that the pr for weezer just seemed a little too perfect?  that
their drummer really sucks?  that they don't curse on a single song?  they
sing like they're from the fifties, AND WORSE YET, MINUS THE OCCASIONAL
ANACHRONISM, THEIR LYRICS SOUND LIKE THEY ARE FROM THE FIFTIES.  for christ's
sake, most of their songs are about girlfriends that they never mention
having sex with, being naked with, or being sexual with in any way.  i look
at all this and i wonder if they even knew how to play their instruments
before they made their album.  

HEY, HEY WE'RE WEEZER.
WE LIKE TO SING AND PLAY.
BUT OTHER THAN "BUDDY HOLLY",
WE'VE GOT NOTHING TO SAY.....
