i take absolutely no responsiblity for the use of this text, or anything that
may result from it. if you make dmt or take dmt and somehow kill yourself,
it's not my fucking problem. it was a result of your own actions.  

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

welcome to issue #12.  as you may or may not know, i now have a web page. 
there's not much on it, but that is soon to be amended.  however, all the
issues are on it, so you may grab them at your convenience.

if you will and if you care... enjoy.

prepatory statement:  DMT = LSD * 1,000,000

LSD distorts reality.  DMT gives you a new one.  in the organic form, it
is an orange powder or paste.  when made in a laboratory, it is typically
a white powder or paste.  for maximum results, it is smoked with a crack
pipe.  approximately 30 mg should give you the best effect.  smoke it QUICKLY.
your body develops an immediate tolerance.  beware, it tastes like shit. one 
must be sitting and having another person hold the pipe, as you lose all motor 
functionality.  although it lasts between 5-30 minutes, it may seem an 
eternity.  DO NOT SMOKE TOBACCO within a few hours previous to your DMT 
smoking.

depending on the method of ingestion used and largely upon the user, the
results vary.  A friend of mine smoked it with pot, reporting a series of
intense kaliedoscopic images.  I heard about this one guy that lived an 
ENTIRE LIFETIME, from birth to death, inside of the 15 minutes we was under
the influence.  some people talk of jeweled basketballs that sing objects
into existance and mysterious elven creatures that operate the machinery to
with the universe is subordinate.

mckenna.

      HOW TO MAKE DMT (N,N-dimethyltryptamine) IN YOUR FUCKING KITCHEN
      (stolen without changes or permission from william powell's 
       _the anarchist cookbook_)

1.  Mix thoroughly and dissolve 25g of indole with a pound of dry ethyl ether
    in a 2,000ml flask (two-quart jar).

2.  Take ice tray and fill with chipped or shaved ice.  Now cool solution for
    about 35 minutes until it reaches the temperature of 0 degrees C.  At the
    same time cool 50ml of dry oxalychloride to about -5 C. in the same ice 
    tray.

3.  VERY SLOWLY add the oxalychloride solution to the indole solution.

WARNING: When these two chemicals are mixed together, there is an extremely
violent reaction.  Avoid boiling over, avoid contact with skin, and avoid
fumes.

4.  Wait until all the bubbling has died down, then add a few handfuls of
    common table salt to the ice tray, to cool the solution further.  Put 
    this solution aside and label it "solution 1."

5.  Cool 100ml of dry ethyl ether, in a 500ml flask, to 0 degrees C. in a
    salted ice tray.  At the same time cool an unopened 100g bottle of 
    dimethylamine to 0 degrees C. in the same ice bath.

6.  Open the seal of the dimethylamine bottel and slowly pour a steady stream
    into the ether.  Label "solution 2."

7.  Very slowly and carefully add solution "1" and "2" together.

8.  Now take the mixed solutions from the ice tray and bring up to room
    temperature, stirring the solutionall the time.  You should be left with
    a solution which is almost clear.  If it is still murky, continue
    stirring until it becomes as clear as possible.

9.  Now filter the solution to separate the precipitate by suction, as shown
    in figure 1.

figure 1: primary filtering of homemade DMT

10.  Refilter with suction after pouring technical ether over the precipitate.

11.  Repeat filtering once more with ether and then twice with water.

12.  Let this substance dry on a plastic or china plate. (Do not use metal.)
     After drying, a solid material will be formed.  Take these particles and
     place them in a 800ml beaker.

13.  Mix 100ml benzene with 100ml methyl alcohol.  After the mixture has been
     stirred,  cover solid particles from step 12 with about a half inch of
     the solution and heat the beaker in water until all solid material has
     dissolved.  Add more solvent if necessary.  See figure 2 below.

             heat source

figure 2: heating DMT solution in water bath

14.  After all the solid material has dissolved, remove beaker from the heat,  
     and allow it to cool.  As it cools, small needle-shaped crystals will
     appear.  When this happens, try to pour off as much of the solvent as
     possible without disturbing the crystals.

15.  Place crystals in a 1000ml flask and dissolve in tetrahydrofurane.
     (Use only as much as absolutely necessary.) Label this solution "A."

16.  Slowly mix 200ml tetrahydrofurane and 20g lithium aluminum hydride in a
     500ml flask, and label it solution "B."

WARNING: Lithium aluminum hydride ignites on contact with moisture. Do NOT
use on humid days.  Protect eyes and wear rubber gloves.

17.  Mix solutions "A" and "B" slowly, stirring constantly.

18.  Prepare a water bath and heat solution in water bath for three hours,
     stirring for four minutes every half hour.  When not stirring, use
     aspirator tube as shown in figure 3.

figure 3: final collection of DMT

19.  When this is completed, allow the flask to remain at room temperature
     for about 20 minutes.  Then place in salted ice bath and cool to 0
     degrees C.  Add a small amout of chilled methanol, stirring gently until
     solution appears murky.

20.  Filter this murky solution through a paper filter in a funnel, and
     collect the filtered liquid in a flask.

21.  Add 100ml of tetrahydrofuran through the filter and collect in the same
     flask.  Now heat this solution in a water bath until most of the 
     tetrahydrofuran is evaporated and a gooey substance remains.

22.  Place little piles of this substance on a cookie tray and, with a heat
     lamp, dry for three of four hours.  DMT is the result.
