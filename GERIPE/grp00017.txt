GOOD MORNING. I've been very distracted lately - Information Overload Unit.
I've moved twice since the last issue.  I suppose my mind has been equally
as restless as my body.  This is one thing I wrote after the first move:

"geripe resides with my computer just as a soul attaches itself to a body.
 when the body moves, the soul follows.  when the body changes, the soul
 accomodates.  my computer is now running an entirely different O/S, so
 geripe isn't necessarily going to be the same entity.  like the soul, it
 must accomodate and it rarely knows the changes it must put itself through
 before the changing actually occurs.  my computer has also moved, along
 with myself, to a new location where it expects to spend a large amount of
 time.  with each of these new changes there are always attachments,
 sometimes hidden.  i can only expect them as welcomed guests and allow them
 to change things as they may."

The following notes that make up this issue are what geripe may become.
There will be more information on this later.

enjoy the issue.

           pSYCHOTROPIC DELUGE: tHE fLOOD tHAT aCTS uPON tHE mIND.
                                (liner notes)

*ontology

the random wall:
plaster of paris - key insignia pushing out into substance.  quiet (loud?)
sensibilties stream (non-abrubt?) into consciousness.  slip inside...
it recedes from tangibility.  thoughts come to tongues - instantaneous
wash-away.  apres moi les deluge.

from the random wall:
focus on paradigmatic will.  keying up the extension of motorized sounds
for predetermination engine.  take all, take nothing, take _some_thing.


*epistimology

the weak:
the confines that the mind places on idea.  the ineptitude of the mind to
communicate this idea thru the passage of words with the limitations of
grammatical rules and such prisons as specific _words_.  words are no
longer taken into consideration as anything but contextual clues to meaning.
the words have no specific value unto themselves; they become the context and
the context defines form.  the form bleeds to truth and the truth becomes
oneself.  breaking free from these prisons of the mind which the mind defines
for itself.  these seemingly congenital disorders of thought were begotten
by convenience in understanding this "outside world" (does such as this
exist?) upon the self-realization of man.  this perversion of idea begets
lies, misunderstanding, misery.  may your atavistic urges to understand
set you free.

from the weak:
the focus of the mind.  steal this intangible dream.  communicate to yourself
thru the wanderings of others.  become yourself by liberating the soul inside
the chaos.  the chaos is the field between subjective and objective modes.
the subjective defines, the objective defies this paradigm.

sundial - a solar rheostat.

* Turn West: the sky opens and closes as you watch tomorrow.

* Turn East: the sky opens and closes as you watch yesterday.

The monolithic knob is turned by thought, but the process is not easy:

	Nature is against you.

It looks with abhorence on this jealous activity.  It sees this mind as a 
miser of memory: latching onto something which doesn't belong to it.

What follows is the outline for the track "Soul Nutrition".


THE SOUND:

In the element of sound, I have separated specific qualities into
each track.

one:  The text is read changing the recording speed for emphasis.

two:  The text is read having been modified in the defined mode and 
      is now played backwards as a separate track.

three:  Sounds produced by the abrasive rubbing of a microphone into
        a multi-folded section of aluminum foil.  The microphone is
        connected to an amplifier on very high volume with the
        distortion option enabled. The rhythm of such an instrument
        has no bearing on the track at hand.  This is done for the
        sole purpose of audio intensity.

four:  An intensly loud sample of an air-compressor is played at 
       seemingly random intervals.  This is also done for the purpose
       of emphasis as related to audio intensity. 


THE TEXT:


Fade in: blackness recedes to reveal the bark of a tree.  

Light falls onto the trunk, hits the branches, touches 

leaves.  The light grows brighter and wider.  It 

unassumingly stops after the tree is shone bright.  

Like branches on trees, we appear from the trunk, the 

trunk of consciousness and the trunk of body, they are 

THE singular entity.  Consciousness is a function of body.  

Body stems from nature.  Nature is an extension of idea 

in the form of a leaf.  Communication is the falling of 

the leaf, the passing of an epoch of impossible duration.  

Leaf touches ground from which it gains its intension, 

intoning a nutrient of denotation isolated by truth from 

connotation, that miapprehender of ideas, that killer of 

intension.  This nutrient is either taken as food or 

rejected as trash when the compost of universal 

consciousness ripens it to a stinking morsel.  This process 

of rejection may be infinite, but it lacks in efficiency.

The fault lies with the aesthetic of change, everything must 

be accepted when needed or the tree's growth suffers.  

Shouldn't the progress of the tree be of the branches best 

interests?  These branches, giving no thought to their great 

progenitor imagine themselves to be separate trees of 

themselves.  A misconception of ones heredity only begets 

more of the same self-hate; begets/begat/will beget this 

self-same hatred, self-hatred, hatred, self-hatred, hatred, 

hate, stopping and stillness.  This is counter-productive by 

its very nature.  And it lacks the self-less, unthinking 

intension: the marrow of the human raison d'etre.

fade away: the tree recedes as do I.  The blackness is the 

tree as I am the tree like the reflection in a mirror.  

Reach out and touch your own hand.
