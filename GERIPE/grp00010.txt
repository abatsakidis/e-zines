it's been a really long time since i actually wrote anything, much less for
this zine.  i've been really busy lately.  reading vonnegut and acting
important in my work environment.  acting important more or less because i
suppose that the busier and more serious i look, the lesser my chances of
being fired for laziness.  it's 1:00pm and i've been up since 7:00am, having
had my full 8 hours of sleep.  i'm still struggling to stay awake.  maybe i
have mono.  maybe it's the experiments.  i think i'm just lazy.  laziness is
my raison d'etre.

i've decided that geripe is now at an empasse.  as i've been fiddling with
the i ching as of late, i think it would be appropriate to consult it on this
matter.  here i go:

<wait while i find my hexagram> 
             
earth, eh?  it looks like this:
                         ________    ________
                         ________    ________
                         ________    ________
                         ________    ________
                         ________    ________
                         ________    ________

my hexagram is earth for this particular circumstance.  the earth
hexagram, strangely enough, is made up of two earth trigrams, pure yin
(broken line).  so by consequence, my trigram is made up entirely of yin.
i can't roll anything about yin.  as yin can be interpereted as female, maybe
the i ching is trying to tell me something.  or maybe it's just a reflection
of what has been on my mind all day... week... month... year. 
             
according to thomas cleary (the translator of the i ching i'm consulting who 
i'm not so inclinded to trust as i not being the sinologist that he is have 
found mistakes in his work) earth represents receptivity.  maybe this has 
something to do with me being receptive to my own ideas.  recently, i have 
been laconic of thought.  perhaps i need to give those thoughts more 
attention in order to allow them to develop.  
             
my more latent question as to whether i should even continue seems to be
ignored.  it was a stupid question anyway.
