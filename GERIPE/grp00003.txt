"...By far the worst is the hamburger lady, and because of shortage right now
 of 'qualified technicians', e.g. technicians who can work with her and keep
 their last meal down, Screwloose Lauritzen and I have been alternating 
 nights with her, unrelievedly.  If you put a 250-lb meatloaf in the oven
 and then burned it and then followed that by propping it up on a potty-chair
 to greet you at 11pm each night, you would have some description of these
 past two weeks.  Which is to say the worst I seen since viet napalms.  When
 somebody tells you that there is a level of pain beyond which the human mind
 cannot retain consciousness, please tell them to write me.  In point of fact
 this lady has not slept more than 3-5 minutes at a stretch since she came to
 us - that was over two weeks ago and, thanks to medical advances, there is
 no end in sight; from the waist (waste?) up everything is burned off, ears,
 nose etc - lower half is untouched and that, I guess, is what keeps her
 alive.  I took one guy in to help me change tubes and he did alright, that
 is alright till he came out, then he spotted one  of the burn nurses 
 (pleasant smiling zombies) eating a can of chile-mac at the desk, and that
 did it: he flashed on the carpet.  It is fucking insane is what it is."

if anyone reads these things, then they have probably noticed that geripe
comes out on a very irregular basis.  this issue was started and not
necessarily finished on the day after the release of #3.  it always seems
to work out that i get the inspiration to write and release an issue and then
immediately think of more things to write about that i really should have put
in the issue that i just released... oh, well.  there probably isn't even
anyone that reads these things, anyhow.  


*AN EXPERIENCE WITH SLEEP DEPRIVATION*

My knowledge of sleep deprivation runs deep, as i am a chronic insomniac.
i think the best part of it is definately the dementia that it produces.
half the time, i'm seeing in 2d and i feel like i'm in a movie.

i was talking to my brother a while ago and he relayed to me an experience
he had.  see, he's a security guard.  so by definition, he has sporatic
sleeping patterns.  on this particular night, he hadn't slept for about 48
hours, having to do his usual bit of putting up with idiots.  he's a writer 
(speaking of which, i hope he would hurry up and send me some of his stuff,
i want to put it in the zine), and a damn good writer, too.  like just about
every writer, he dreams of having a great book published, winning the 
pulitzer prize, etc... he was thinking along these lines on that particular
night when he had this IDEA.  he said to himself, "OH MY FUCKING GOD, THIS
IS THE ONE.  THIS IS THE ONE THAT WILL GET ME THE FUCKING PULITZER PRIZE.
FUCK THAT, THE *NOBEL* PRIZE.  THIS ONE'LL REVOLUTIONIZE THE FIELD!"  he
quickly took out a piece of paper and laughing to himself, scrawled IT on
a piece of paper.  he stuck the paper fragment into his pocket knowing of his
victory and let the IDEA slip from his mind during the process of the night.
later that night, after his shift was over he drove home exhausted from the
obtuse people and the ordeal of the of the last two days.  he immediately
fell asleep.  a couple of days later, he was going through his pants pockets
and found this little strip of paper that in a deranged, almost illegible
script read, "WASH YOUR SOCKS IN GRAVY".
