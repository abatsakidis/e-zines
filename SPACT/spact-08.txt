People Who Should Not Be Allowed On The Bus
=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=

I have been travelling around London quite a bit on
busses recently and this has compelled me to publish
a list of those groups of people I think should be
banned from public transport (and in particular the
busses). So without further procrastination:

Useless Old People
------------------
This does not mean all old people. This means: IF YOU
CANNOT STEADY YOURSELF TO GET ON THE BUS IN UNDER
50 SECONDS, GET THE FUCK OFF. The amount of complaining
from elderly people falling all over the place because
they cannot keep their balance is most frustrating.
When you can no longer keep your balance, stop using
the bus; public transport is not for you. In fact,
there is a place just for you: IN DOORS. Stay there.


People With Push Chairs
-----------------------
If you can afford to have a baby you should damn well
afford to own a car. If you can't perhaps you should
have made your skanky ass trailer trash boyfriend
where some protection; or failing that, stop being
such a slut. Enough said.


People Who Smell
----------------
People who lack the ability to wash themselves sufficiently
do not deserve to use public transport and make us all
smell their filth; have a shower asshole.


Fat People
----------
If you take up more than one seat on the bus you are too
fat and should not be allowed on. It's a piss take. If 
you struggle to waddle down the isle without sticking
your huge fat backside in normal people's faces; GET THE 
HELL OFF THE BUS LARDASS. Walk, face it, you need the 
exercise.


Care In The Community Patients
------------------------------
The mentally ill have no place on public transport. 
Listening to these retards gibber to themselves is not
as fun as it initially seems when you glance at the
amount of murders committed by those who should be
locked in rubber rooms each year. We should be 
protected from these bastards, not be asked to
offer our seats to them.


People Who Have No Concept Of Personal Space
--------------------------------------------
I swear to God, the next son of a bitch that leans on
me on the bus while I'm minding my own business is
going to die. I don't care how old/retarded/skanky 
you are; get the hell off me dipshit. If I wanted
an elderly Pakistani man sitting on my lap I'd
head off to a gay brothel somewhere with a very
specific request. I don't, therefore; FUCK OFF.

This has helped me.
