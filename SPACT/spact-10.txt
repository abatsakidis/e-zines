A Cunning And Evil Plan
=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=

[18:00] <elggawf> ;)
[18:01] <elggawf> i don't get it though
[18:01] <elggawf> like
[18:01] <elggawf> if i were a terrorist nation with an 
                  assload of money to spend

[18:01] <elggawf> instant space programme
[18:01] <elggawf> it only cost about $20m too
[18:01] <elggawf> then you spend another $1m in american 
                  currency
[18:01] <elggawf> all in pennies
[18:02] <elggawf> then you fly up into sub-orbit
[18:02] <elggawf> and drop them all out over the USA
[18:02] <elggawf> imagine
[18:02] <elggawf> a hundred million tiny, superheated chunks 
                  of copper raining down on your enemies
[18:02] <elggawf> it's genius
[18:04] <|PaRiS|> fwaggle you are a scary man.

                  hookers
[18:26] <elggawf> not actually playing the game
