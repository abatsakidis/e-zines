"Once you have learned everything you think you need
to know about Magic, and further more, once you have
learned everything there is to know about Magic, you
still have one more lesson to learn. Not to use it."

Comic's Are Coming Along Hardcore
=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=
The Soljo Comics are comic along very well, one is
however still working with a temporary title until
we finalise what we want it to be called! The other
I can exclusively reveal is called "Insignificant
Demon", and centres around the exploits of Samual
Darkhart, as you may have guessed, a fairly 
insignificant demon (mentioned previously in 
Desirei`: Beginnings). As soon as we finalise the
umbrella name for the publications the site will
appear on it's own area of www.soljo.org - with
each publication having it's own cover, intro and
staff lists. We expect the first releases late 
January after the release of the 2003 Annual (Xmas 
Edition).

No Huns Please, We're British
=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=
[19:41] <claustro> Well, I have a few plans to 
provide in my life... such as... climbing the Magick 
Tree... is there a sign on it saying: "Shall not be 
climbed by huns"?
[19:41] <|PaRiS|> Not at the moment, but I could 
make one.


So, The U.S Caught Saddam...
=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/
Well they caught the son of a bitch, and I have 
to admit being surprised about it. Not surprised 
that they caught him you understand (all that 
technology; a "Wild West" bounty of on his head... 
just a matter of time in a region where he was hated 
by the largely more zealous Islamic powers...), 
surprised that Saddam was stupid enough not to have 
fled the country or man enough to go down shooting;
himself if no one else...

So much for that Islamic fighting spirit huh, what 
the hell are we in the west all so worried about? 
If the men at the top are all such cowards; sooner 
or later the men at the bottom (being asked to 
literally blow themselves up to sustain the man 
at the top) will realise. Fact.

But I digress... the world may well be a "better 
place" with Saddam locked up somewhere and not 
using chemical weapons on Kurds, at the moment 
at least; but when the US keeps it's sticky mitts 
in the Middle East after they hand back power to 
the Iraqi's with the mandate that they caught the 
"Butcher of Baghdad" will the world still be 
"better." all depends on your definition of 
"better" really doesn't it? It's a heavy price 
to pay.

Either way the anti-war Iraq War side of the 
argument will never hear the end of this, or 
will they?

<ProWar>
So, we caught a ruthless dictator, the war in 
Iraq is now justified.

<AntiWar>
God bless America already... We can all sleep 
better in our beds now that a man who never had 
any direct influence on our lives is gone for good, 
America is a safer place... we caught the bad guy... 
Hey were is Bin Laden by the way?

<ProWar>
Who?

Bin Laden has been officially identified as 
"the problem"; the leader. Capturing Saddam (who 
never had anything to do with Bin Laden in the 
first place) is irrelevant. A great propaganda 
victory no doubt. But meaningless in the Americans 
so called agenda of "War against Terror".

If the U.S really wanted to fight Terror they 
wouldn't have passively funded the IRA for over 
30 years. They would make moves to attack, talk 
to, or even threaten North Korea (Which has 
behaved worse than Iraq over the last 10 years; 
and continues to behave badly, waving around 
actual tangible Nuclear Weapons programs, as 
opposed to Saddams imaginary ones...) and they 
would actually gave to FIND Bin Laden.

Anything else they do is just at best, an aside, 
and at worst attempted justification of an 
Imperialistic agenda with a democratic scapegoat 
of a cause.

"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was 
convincing the world he didn't exist."

The U.S is a wolf of Imperialism in sheep's 
clothing; it's claws are just beginning to 
tear it's costumes fabric.

Hands up who can see this.?
