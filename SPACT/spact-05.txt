Xmas TV Rant
=/=/=/=/=/=/

What the fuck is up with TV around Xmas in the 
UK? It seems to me that the schedulers just all 
piss off and they bring in their grandparents to 
fill in. Take BBC 2 for example... Generally they 
play the Simpson's 6pm every week day; it's a good
show and gets the highest ratings most weeks. So 
over Xmas, what do they do? Stop showing it.

What do they show in it's place... random films 
from the 60's.

Why?

Beats the shit out of me.

They are bastards. And I hate them.
