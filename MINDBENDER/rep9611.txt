 3:rd World paki report, November 1996 by MindBender & ShadowMaster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NOTE: Iïm very sorry for the delay of this issue. Because of my new job and
alot of other time-infecting activities there hasnt been any room for this
report until now... Iïm currently working bi-handed on this and the december
issue so hopefully it will be out in time... 

Special hiho to Mad Turnip and the rest of the Hybrid x-mas magazine crew,
sorry for not participating but time was too short for me this year, maybe
I can help you out with a spring-issue ? :)

Merry x-mas and a happy new year to everyone...     // MindBender

To gain score, follow the rules below:

* Only final release version will be rated
* Only releases within the 50 disk limit will be rated
* Only releases that works 100% will be rated (no beta/unregistered)
* Only releases in english language will be rated

The first working version that is 'properly' stripped will recieve score !

All releases will be rated in a 1-5 point score (1 = crap, 5 = excellent).
This includes trainers and "real" addons (extra missions etc. NOT sound
or animations). A good trainer is much more joyable than a bad game...

Non-working games that are fixed within a 5 day period will be rated with
a lesser score for each fix needed. Fixes are not awarded with score...

* note * the defination of a properly stripped game is where unnecessary
animations/intros/outros/speech etc is removed. The game must ofcourse
still be playable (ie: Command & Conquer - Hybrid releases in 1995).

Authors comments: Once again Hybrid holds Europe in its grip, as no one can 
                  mount any opposition.  Despite a slowdown in the number of
                  European titles, Hybrid digs deep on the last couple days
                  of the month and manages to claim the number two spot from
                  undeserving hands.  Mad Turnip does his usual, and Animal
                  and Dogfriend do more than usual, even stepping in to grab
                  a USA title.  Hot Tuna, Hybrid's latest acquisition, nails
                  a couple nice titles this month in addition.  With their
                  usual mix of suppliers, and the addition of HT to the team,
                  their control of England is complete.  Expect Hybrid to
                  remain on top of Europe for quite some time.

Authors comments: Once again Reflux comes through with a smidgen of titles
                  to release.  Time Warp is a porn game with the pornography
                  ripped out, and Scorcher is likely a beta.  Here is where
                  we will have a little discourse on Reflux's judgement in
                  bringing back JDA.  This guy puts out nothing but betas,
                  and was the reason for Reflux being banned in the first
                  place.  Now they allow him back and the first thing he
                  gives them something we're 99% sure is a beta.  It is likely
                  that Reflux will grab the minor titles here and there, and
                  continue to put out betas from JDA until they get in trouble
                  again.

Releasing errors: Though technically no "releasing errors," but one is such a
                  piece of shit, and the other is going to be proved a beta,
                  that they should both be listed here.

Authors comments: Well, they did put out more things than last month, but it
                  appears that is a mixed blessing.  While they scored nice
                  titles such as HoMM2 and Harpoon '97, the number of
                  penalties they incurred is shameful.  Five out of seven
                  releases either got no credit, needed fixes, or both.  To
                  top it off they decided they would break the disk limit
                  all group had previously set.  This might not be such a
                  hard pill for them to swallow if they hadn't made such
                  lofty claims about how wonderful they were.  With any luck
                  they will try to shape up their act, and we expect them
                  to come in 3rd place next month.

Authors comments: Once again Prestige rises to the occasion and breaks
                  another record, putting out 42 titles.  As expected they
                  retained the number 1 slot.  No spectacular news over here
                  this month.  Expect Prestige to retain first place for a
                  while.

 Final Words
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sheesh, and we thought last month was the biggest we had ever seen.  November
has always been the best month of the year, and we should've known better.   
Major titles from both Europe and the USA flooded boards and sites worldwide.
The best part of it all was that these titles came from several groups as   
everyone seemed to get a big piece of the pie this month.  Most major
companies, as well as several smaller ones, rushed out a lot of titles so they
would be in shops come holiday time, and you can see the results, as virtually
every day something new was released.  If you can't find at least 3 or 4 games
you like this month, something is wrong with your head.

Strangely enough, it would seem as a lot of betas have been released recently,
some of the more notable ones being Privateer 2, Sim Golf, and (thought as yet
unproven) Batman: the Arcade Game.  So as we could expect, several groups  
were able to release final versions of the beta titles, only adding to the
huge amount of stuff coming out.  At least it is reassuring to see that some
groups are making a greater effort to investigate possible releases, so that
less mistakes will be made in the future.

The amount of competition is steadily growing, and it is beginning to feel 
like the old days again, as we have 4 major groups competing for the top slot,
as opposed to the 2 that existed last Christmas.  As predicted, Razor has had
a much better month in November than October, releasing quite a few nice
titles.  Paradigm has risen to become a big releasing force, as expected, and
did a good job putting out a few long awaited games.  Prestige continued to
control the majority of American originals with no European support, and 
as expected Hybrid dominated Europe with no American support.

Expect to see a bit of a slowdown in December if the releasing activity of 
past years proves to be accurate again.  With over 60 titles released this
month, however, a slow down does not mean that the well of releases will be
dry.  You can expect to see the major contenders pumping out lots of good
stuff for the masses of enthusiastic gamers.

As for the wrap up for this month, we can say that without a doubt this is
the most memorable month in a long time as more titles are released in this
month than EVER before for ANY system.  All groups did a superb job, and
we encourage you to keep up the good work.  At this rate, we'll all need to
purchase huge hard drives just to keep up with the releasing craze.
