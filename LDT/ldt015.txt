#015 - [ Dog Shit ]
       [ xod ]

Taking the dog for a walk.
		He is obsessed with sticks.  
				Big sticks.  

	Big Sticks, little dog.  
		
			Any idea what that looks like?

Kinda funny to watch.

Anyways, I find a big stick, but I'm stood thinking.  Hrm, perhaps 
this stick is a little too big.  So, I try breaking it in half.  
Problem is I choose the toughest stick around.  I was twisting it 
and pulling it with no results.  You should have seen the end of the 
stick when I finished with it, a twisted mashed-up stick that 
resembled a makeshift mop rather than a stick.

I threw the stick, but it didn't go very far because the mashed up
end of the stick didn't react very well to the wind, and it fell to
the ground only a short distance away.  Bah, I thought.

Walking onwards, I say to my girlfriend.

'Fuck, it stinks of dogshit around here, this is nearly unbearable'.

Walking onwards, I say to my girlfriend.

'Hrm, Have I stepped in some dogshit?'

'Nope'.

Walking onwards, I smell my hand.

What do you know..  Dogshit.

Yep.  I guess while wrestling with the stick that didn't even do its 
job properly I must have dropped it in some dog shit and picked it up 
without realising.  I tend to switch off like that while walking the
dog.

So there I was, dogshit on my fingers, dog barking like crazy expecting
me to throw the shitty stick again, pissed off, and miles from a bar of
soap.  Luckily I wasn't biting my nails at the time.  I'd have been 
brushing my teeth for the next two days.

What more can I say?

Dog Shit -> :<
