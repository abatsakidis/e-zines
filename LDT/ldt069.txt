#069 - [ I Had A Dream ]
       [ n0soul ]


Last night i had a dream

i dreamt of a girl i once dated

well we didnt really date we met when i was on holiday

i was a much different person when we met

i was rude

i used drugs

i didnt really have that much respect for girls

i was always trying to act 'cool' trying to empress my friends

 

she was great

she was smart 

she was funny 

she was caring

she was beautiful

 

i fell for her from when we first met

i dont even understand how she could have liked me, but she did

her dad didnt 

i didnt care much

i was too cool to care about anything

 

we wrote to one another for a while

you know how it is, things like that never last

but the time we shared was great

 

i always used to think about her

always fantasy about her

aways daydream about her

 

how could i not, she was PERFECT

 

my dream was strange, as they are

she was in a bright golden light

i was in the dark 

i sat beside her

she didnt recognize me at first

i told her i was just coming over to say hi and ask how she is

and then i walked off

 

it was kind of a sad dream

but it sparked up memorys of her

thinking of her makes me feel good

but thinking of what i was like and what i ruined makes me feel shit

i try and block that stuff out

 

i wish i could meet her again and show her how i have changed

but now id be to shy to approach a girl like that

so PERFECT

 

yes, ive dated since then

yes, i check out girls when i go somewere

but they are nothing compared to her

 

all the memorys came flooding back this morning 

i woke up an hour before my alarm was due to wake me from my slumber

i lay in been thinking of her in that golden light 

it felt good to just lie there thinking of such a divine creature

she was the subject of my daydreams today and i think she will be 
tomorrow

she is the only person i have loved and still do

 

I love you Joanna
