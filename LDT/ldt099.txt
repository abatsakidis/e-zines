#099 - [ Wave (die thou stupid wave, die) ]
       [ Dr. Bryan Thompson ]


Come see the wave crash upon the shore in a hurried frenzy of panicked water
molecules flung on the land, drowning in the sand.  the wave crash into the
rock and die and fall back all to do it again and again like some stupid
teenager with nothing better to do the throw himself against the wall like
some drunken fish, again and again and again and again and again.  I tell the
wave to die.  The wave does not.  I tell the wave to go away.  The wave does
not.  I spit curses at the wave again and again.  DIE THOU STUPIDEST STUPID!
DIE AND TAKE YOUR SEAWEED WITH YOU!

The wave does not.  I fight the wave.  I punch and kick it.  Again, it
continues to fight back and crash and tumble and recede over and over again
and again.  Ultimately, the wave wins with me panting on the shore for breath
and the wave continues.  Where has the water been?  It has surely fought
greater men than me.  Eventually, I join the wave in one final act of
desperation.  I give in.  I fall.  I sink.  I am now the wave.  The wave is
now me.  I am on the ocean bottom, but soon, the wave will wash me up.  I am
the wave.

I wash up on the shore in a crazed manner.  Stark white.  Lifeless eyes
staring straight into space, above, beyond.  Extremely creepy.

I wash up.  The wave, my friend, takes me there.  To the beach that I once
knew.  To the beach that I was once on when I was a landlubber.  Before I
was one with the wave, one with the sea.  Before I crashed upon every shore
in every beach.  Before I was sailed upon and captured for water and before
I was moved and tumulted around, again, like a drunken fish.  "I am the sea",
I said.

"I AM THE SEA"
I CRIED FROM THE TRENCHES IN THE SEA, MY AIR BUBBLES FLOATING UP TOP TO THE
OTHER WORLD OF AIR AND LIFE AND HORIDDNESS BEYOND ALL IMAGINATION.

DIE. DIE. DIE. DIE. DIE.
THE SEA SHALL LIVE.  WATER FLOATS.  ROCKS DO NOT 
ALL HAIL THE WAVE! 
ALL HAIL THE SEA! 

I wash up on the sandy beach and a couple finds me.  They were walking on the
beach holding hands like a couple of yuppies before they found my body.  My
lifeless eyes.  Seaweed clinging to me.
They were frightened to say the least, but I was even more frightened to be
on the moonscape, this horrid world with its stagnation and inertia.  I hated
this world.  I am still the wave.  I will continue to be the wave even after
they take my sea-ridden body to the hospital and realize that the sea took me.
But I am sad to be here.  I am sad to be on the surface world.  I long for
the waves, yet, I am one.  I will continue to crash on the shore over and
over again in countless beaches, even while I am in the casket, in the ground.
I will continue to be the sea.

GWAHAHAHAHAHA!
