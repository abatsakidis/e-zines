#049 - [ How Hard is it to Not Talk While i'm Watching? ]
       [ jvaldez ]


I am not a racist.

I do not hate a people or a group of people based on one individual.

I do however hate when people interrupt my entertainment, as entertainment
is all there really is to live on in life. On a weekly basis (usually on
sundays) I go to a movie at the local movie theatre. Unfortuneatly, so do a
lot of blacks (african american for those sensitivity inclined) and it seems
that it is these blacks that ruin the god damn movies.

I'm sure there are blacks out there that sit quietly in movie theatres across
the country, don't speak loud, do not laugh and hollar at jet-like decibals,
but most, to all, it seems, do.

Recently I saw Denzel Washington's new flick, "Training Day." It's a real good
movie with a comprehensive story line and a whole lot of action sequences.
Witty characters, good acting, and overall just real good entertainment. I
decided to go see it again, but instead of going to the theatre I first saw it
at, my friend and I decided to go to a movie theatre that was bigger, more
high class, more pricey, etc etc.. That was a mistake. As we (the movie goers)
gathered into this theatre, I looked around, different faces, different
colors. However, each time I spotted a black person, I just thought to myself,
"man I'll bet he/she is going to be an obnoxious idiot during the movie."

So the movie starts..

Within the first 5 minutes of the movie starting, some black guy impersonates
a mexican and starts spewing out bullshit like "start the fucking movie
holmezz, come on essay, start the fucking movie.." That was the first time I
wanted to kill.

In the first 15 minutes of the movie, there is a scene with a Monte Carlo that
has hydraulics on the car. Denzel Washington 'hits the switches' raising the
monte carlo up about a foot, and every fucking black person in that god awful
theatre goes ape shit. "YEA BOY RAISE THAT SHIT UP!!!" Stupid ass uneducated
fucks.

Throughout the rest of the movie, including scenes with drugs in them, these
blacks that I picked out to be "noise makers," fulfilled my premonition and
were complete obnoxious fucks. As the movie ends and we start leaving, I see
the guy who made most to all of the unneeded commentary during the movie
saying to his fat, fat, fat, girlfriend "yo, he lived azuh gangstuh, he died
azuh gangstuh, werd?" From then on, I have felt very weird about being around
blacks I do not know. I do have black friends, of course, they don't act this
way at all.

To conclude this little rant, how fucking hard is it to be quiet for one to
two hours at the max during a fucking movie? I mean honestly, if you can't
keep your trap shut for the first half of the movie, why even go? Rent the
movie when it comes out and save us the trouble of having to see it again
because your mouth was open during all the good scenes. Annoy your friends
and family, not us complete strangers intent on entertaining fulfillment.

Yes I may have made some generalizations back there, but these mother fuckers
are the only ones who do it. I see no mexicans, no whites, no indians, no
puerto ricans, no anybody -- other than blacks making shit loads of noise in
the theatre. I think the movie that illustrates this fact the most is probably
the comedy "Scary Movie," specifically when the black girl is talking up a
storm during a movie. I wonder if these people even realize how rude that kind
of bullshit is?

I am not a racist.

I do not hate blacks because they are black.

I hate the ones that are loud in movie theatres.

Please, do me and all the other movie goers a favor:

shut the fuck up.
