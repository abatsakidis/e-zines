#071 - [ Bad Hair Day ]
       [ xod ]


I washed my hair.  Because it needed to be washed.  I've been wearing my cap
for weeks but I can't really wear my cap to work.  So I had to wash my hair.

Now i'm thinking I shouldn't have washed it.  Ever get that feeling?

Now it's just so out of control.  Fuck style, fuck definition, fuck neat hair.
Its all crazy, it's adopted a life of its own, it looks like i've had a major
electric shock while being thrown through a hedge at the same time.  Sucks.

So now my cap is back on, and I take it off every so often and make my hair
all messy with my hands, then put it back on, and repeat the process again
15 minutes later.

Hopefully that'll do the trick.

My major moaning point is that before I washed my hair it was fine.  It fell
into place nicely, looked fine as far as I could tell.  But I thought i'd
make the effort to wash it.  What do I get for my efforts?!  Even shitter
hair than I started with.  Cleaner hair, but shitter hair.

I don't understand the people who make shampoo.  Surely they can develop a
formula that actually works rather than giving us bullshit that they suggest
works.

On the bottle of shampoo I used it says 'No More Fluffy Hair'.  I can tell
my hair is gonna go b00m in the morning, and i'll end up looking like i've 
got a giant rabbits tail or whatever on my head.

Now i'll have to spend time in the morning pouring lots of water on my head
to make sure its relatively normal.

Argh!@

Its not like it's cheap shampoo either.  I've tried lots of different brands
but they are all the same: shit!

What can I do?

Nothing.

What should I do?

Shave my Head.
