#060 - [ I Wanna be Straight-Edged ]
       [ xod ]


I like a cold beer.  I like a cigarette when i'm drunk.

But I Wanna be Straight-Edged.

This isn't the 1st time i've had this feeling.  I knew a straight edged kid
once and I spoke to him about it while we were on a bus into town.  He got me
thinking 'hrm, it'd be a good idea'.  However, last time I saw this guy he was
drunk as fuck, so hrm, I presume he lost the edge.

I guess it's one of those things you have to get into at a certain point in
your life, and i've either gone past that point, or I haven't reached it yet.
I could have easily been straight-edge when I was 15-18.  I mean, I used to
drink a lot for a period there when I started going out, but then I stopped
for a while.  But it wasn't through philosophy or politics, purely through
the fact that I didn't feel like drinking.  Hrm, if i'd thought of it from a
straight-edge perspective maybe i'd still be there today, then again, maybe
not.

I don't really know many straight-edged people.  Most people I know like
drinking.  I used to know a lot of people into drugs but I didn't really want
to be hanging around with them anymore.  If I had some friends who wanted to
go straight-edged i'm sure it'd be easier to take that step.  For example, a 
junkie trying to give up a drug isn't going to have a very high success rate 
if he's hanging around at his/her dealer's house everyday.  Likewise, an 
alcoholic isn't going to have much success quitting the drink if he/she works 
in a bar 6 day's a week.  It just doesn't happen.

The key factor is enviroment.
