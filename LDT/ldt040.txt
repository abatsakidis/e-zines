#040 - [ I Smell Gas ]
       [ xod ]


I figure if I lit a cigarette right now i'd cause an explosion.  Shall I
strike the match?  No, i'd probably blow up the whole street.

I've been in the same situation a few times now.  At my old house I came
downstairs to grab a drink one time and I could smell a really strong smell
of gas.  So, what did I do?  Without thinking, I switched on the lightswitch.
I was stoned at the time and I figured,

'Hey, there is no better way to tell if its a gas leak than to turn on a
  light or spark a match'.

I guess thats stoner logic.  Dumbass.

I guess the smell I can smell now is coming from outside.  The 'gas-out' pipe
or whatever its called is on the bottom floor right below the window I
currently have open up here, on the second floor.

A few weeks ago we were sat downstairs watching a movie in the dark.  'What
Lies Beneath'.  It was a good movie I guess, from what I saw/heard of it at
least.

Yeap, we could smell gas, we had been smelling it all day but we didn't
really think anything of it.  Three of the other people here were feeling
quite weird; headaches, drowsiness, drizzyness, that sort of thing.  I was
feeling a little weird too I guess.

So, we decided to call the 'Gas Emergency Hotline'.  After speaking to the
operator on the otherside they told us not to touch anything, keep all
electrical items/lights that are already on, on, and keep everything that is
currently off, off.

So, I got up, I can't remember why, perhaps to go to the bathroom, and what
did I do, yeap, I switched on the light.  I wasn't stoned at this time, so I
guess that's simply xod logic.  Dumbass.

But hey, nothing happened, so I was forgiven by the others and the possible
seriousness of the thoughts of a 'gas leak' seemed to disappear to be replaced
with sillyness and laughing (possibly bought on by the gas we were inhaling).

The emergency gas man arrived, went down to the basement where the gas-mains
thing is, came up 5 minutes later telling us of a hole in the pipe which was
leaking out gas.  Apparently it had rusted right through because the gas-mains
was so old it could have possibly been auctioned to 'The Museum of Gas Related
Paraphernalia' for a healthy profit.  He replaced the gas-mains with a brand
new one and left.

                        The gas man saved the day, hooray!
