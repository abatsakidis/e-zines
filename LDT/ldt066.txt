#066 - [ Theory on the American Terrorist Attack ]
       [ bshark ]


Now before i go on i feel that some people may find this text file distasteful
and basically not nice, well if you are thinking that then dont worry, i dont
think that the attacks on america were good at all, i think they were an
absolute waste of time and achieved nothing except put the world at the risk
of a war because america has the most stupid leader it has ever had........
BRING BACK CLINTON!!!

He was one clever guy, i really dont like bush being president he is stupid
and not intelligent at all, he is one of the worst people you can have for
president, but then looking at the candidates, it was either shit and crap
bush or crap and shit gore.......America looses either way!

Oh Btw i am english and i have nothing at all against america except their
inaccurate spellings and their bad interpretation of sports names.....
but that is another story.

So as the world is aware we are going into economic slow down and people are
loosing their jobs and less money is being spent in the world (mainly america)
and so there is a global panic incase of a massive recession.

So here comes a brief guide to a recession for those that dont know:

Recessions can be brought about in a few ways that all lead to the same
outcome. I will mention two right here (working in a perfect economy and
assuming ceterus parabus),  Firstly there is the personal greed factor,
Workers feel they are not paid enough so they ask for a pay rise, the bosses
give the workers their pay rise, to cover the pay rise the bosses then have
to recoup these extra expenses from somewhere else, they increase the price
of their goods to get more revenue.  This will have two possible outcomes,
all other companies can no longer afford to buy as much of their product so
they increase their product prices and all workers then need pay increases
(This is known as inflation and has a natural rate anyway) so that they can
have the same standard of living. Alternatively as prices have increased the
companies buying the goods from the first company may not want to increase
price and so they lay off workers and reduce output slowing down the economy.
Workers will have be removed from the economy and thus the purchasing power
of the economy has been greatly reduced. As there is much reduced purchasing
power there is then less demand for the products that would have then bought
and more demand on the government for benefit hand outs. This means less
income for companies and more public (government tax) money being spent on
benefits.  The companies that are now receiving less revenues due to the
reduced demand for proucts may find it hard to continue working at the same
rate they were and so will reduce the output of their goods, they may also
remove workers from their employment as they will be surplus to requirements.
This inturn will reduce the demands for goods on the market, as demand for
goods decreases then the demand for workers will also decrease. This will
continue until an economic equlibrium is found.

There is also a scare factor to.  People fear loosing their jobs, when they
see fellow workers being laid off and becomming unemployed they panic fearing
they to will loose their jobs, and so rather than spend money friviously they
start to save, this also decreases the amount of money in the money supply
and so inturn reduces the economic power of the country.

A global recession will occur IF many importers are hit by the recession, this
happens because america will demand less products from england, england will
then have less money comming in and so tighter margins on profits, this may
start to lead to the same problems in england as in america that is mentioned
in the above paragraphs.

If enough importers are hit who import from all over the world then a global
recession will occur. So basically a recession is where there is less demand
for goods, less demand for workers and less demand for imports or exports and
less money in the economy.  And remember as Bush said, "More of our imports
are comming from abroad"............Now just a thought....Dont all imports
come from abroad??

I hope that gives you a brief outline of how a recession happens and what its
outcomes are.

Firstly i have worked in an economic research centre and so i found that the
construction industry is the backbone of the Unending economy.

Construction is now what america needs. There will be many contruction
businesses looking forward to the next few weeks.  Kicked to the ground have
been the World Trade Centres and also part of the pentagon and they will need
to be rebuilt.

The construction industry will have to do this and they will be waiting with
baited breath for the job.  How will they do this, mainly by employing a lot
more workers (remember the towers were 146 stories or higher!!)  Everything
will be built again, maybe bigger, this will be a big job, it wont take a week
and tons of brick will be needed.

The people who get the job to rebuild everything will earn a lot of money and
will employ many workers.  Employment for many people will help the economy
to rebuild itsself, albeit maybe slowly, it will grow.  Riches and Rewards
will be reaped for those who do and the economy will slowly start to be
literally rebuilt.  Only the areas around where the new workers will live will
be immediately helped by the increased cash and workforce. Regional areas
around NY and Washington will be the next to benefit from increased economy.
In the end the whole of america will benefit from the rebuilding of the WTC
and the Pentagon, how much, i just dont know.

Still this is a tragady and it should never have happened, but could it be
possible that this is a conspiricy by the American government to rebuild the
american economy?  The world lost 5000 workers So this means that 5000 more
people will be required to get it back to its old former self and 5000 people
off the benefit schemes.

If my theory is correct then i am deeply saddened and it should never have
happened. But could it be that america sooo desperatly wants to hide the truth
about the rebuilding of the economy and the desperate measures they went to
to save the world from economic collapse that they are blaming Bin Laden (bin
liner) even though he may have nothing to do with it.

Remember, as one economist once said "in the long run we are all dead anyway,
the best thing for the world as a whole is a few dead people now rather than
nearly everyone dead."

That is a pessimistic view i know but it could be a reason why it was done.
The knock on effects of this are massive, as i write this text file i am
looking at the old world trade centres on a poster i got from america, they
are gorgeous and tall, will they be taken back to their old glory or an even
better one? I dont know only the builders and the owners will know this.

If this was not a government conspiricy to rebuild the economy and infact Bin
Liner did do it, i doubt Bin Liner knows how much help he actually has done
for america and the world but yet the small scale damage he has inflicted
temporarily on america and the world.

And if Bin Liner didn't even do it will we ever know.....Bush is after blood
and Bin Liner is the donator. Once he is dead that will be the end? i doubt
we will ever know the whole truth but we can keep our fingers crossed for at
least something to be said to help us all understand.

There is one thing i feel may happen though, America, UK and the allied forces
(whoever they may be) will loose this war, if they haven't lost already, "bin
laden" has done more damage in 1 day and with anthrax packages (presuming
that is him to) than the americans have done in a month of bombing, looking
at ratio hits i think bin liner is a long long long way ahead of us! :(

But ill leave you with one thing to think about......Think about how gutted
you would feel if you were the insurance company of the world trade centre...

I know, I would have been shitting myself to........
