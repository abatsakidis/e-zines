#022 - [ Loneliness and the Electronic Medium ]
       [ jvaldez ]
     
		
                          Loneliness and the Eletronic Medium;
                                    A case study by:
                                  --> jvaldez and company <--

Picture this. Our modern day source for meeting people has changed from the
normal 'singles' bars and dance clubs to an all digital text only system of
communcation. In short, IRC (internet relay chat for those not addicted). For
those in life, who wish they had, have never experienced, or lack any *good*
experiences with social interaction, the IRC chat rooms provide a place where
they can be anybody. They can drop 200 lbs and gain the looks of a super
model, all by the click of a button. To be more specific, a click of the
connect button. This case study is actually not about the downsides or effects
of IRC and human social reaction, but rather directed towards how the male
gender age thirten to upwards of fourty react to IRC nicknames representing
the female gender. In short, to see how low we could go.


                                  --> the experiment     <--

NOTE: This experiment was done about a year ago on IRC servers of Undernet
(undernet.org) and Efnet. We would have researched this more on Dalnet
(dalnet.org) but we wanted to give humanity, decency, and dignity a slight
chance.

We used the following channels:
	
	#teen
	#teenchat
	#teensex

Don't be fooled by the difference in suffixes above, they all stand for the
same channel.

   #UnattractiveLowLifesInSelfDenialUsingIRCasanEscapeFromTheirSad,SadLives

When doing the tests, we hit these channels at what we considered peak hours,
normally 3 PM - 6 PM. These hours coincide with most high schools and most
shitty eight-to-five day jobs getting out. Why was the day job factor
considered in this experiment? Here are two of the main reasons:

	1. There are a lot of thirteen to eighten year olds. That is a given.
	2. Multiply that times two and you might have a good figure on the
           nineteen to thirty-five age group within the channels.

-- Test 1 --

In our first phase of the experiment we tested the nickname "Nichole17" (N17).
The results were as expected getting 27 messages (from different people of
course) within a period of 90 seconds. Quite a staggering result if the
reader is not one familiar with IRC. However, I myself thought this number to
be low.  So, we changed the variables a bit...

-- Test 2 --

Jeanie15 (J15) sounded just perfect and in fact, did bring a lot more
messages. Totaling up to 40 messages within a 90 second period. Why did it
increase? Well, here is the theory: When we are young, adults and others
sometimes shorten our names to make us sound young. Examples:

Robert => Bobby => Robby

Katherine => Kathy => Katie

Also, we lowered the age by two years, which probably helped out greatly as
well. So by creating an adolescent style name and a lower age, we could spark
the interest of many. Still not satisfied, we continued onto our next subject.

-- Test 3 --

Alexis13 (A13), the best producing nickname we had thought of. The results
were staggering; 67 messages within 90 seconds! We had found the formula. It
goes something as such:

Exotic Name + Low Teenage Age = Reaction (ExN+LA=R)

Think about it for a second, Alexis is a really exotic and interesting name,
you could even go so far as describing it as "sexy." Combine this with the
prime age of innocence, thirteen, and this pseudo-chatter presented the
perfect image of complete innocence to many and resulted with a complete hard
on by most.

                                  --> Conclusion and Thoughts <--

That concluded our experiment but for those who want or think they can get
better results, try  AOL and other servers perhaps.

On another side note, we also took and added other variables to our little
experiment. Unfortunatly, these side projects were not logged as well as our
main goal was. Here are some of our results.

- When joining the channel, with A13, adding a "Hi" would result in a
  thirty-five percent increase in overall messages. So:

	ExN+LA*.65=R

- However, when using A13 once more, but using a lower case 'h' for the "Hi"
  greeting, messages jumped almost half of normal.

	2(ExN+LA)=R

  Our theory on the jump is that when using a capitol 'H' in "Hi" it seems
  that the A13 subject seems to perky, not as innocent as when using a lower
  case 'h'.

- Adding exclamation marks also mixed the results up a bit, but no overall
  gains or anything substantial enough to report. Again this goes
  back to the innocence theory above.


In conclusion, I hope this has made you aware of how many sad, sad people
there are on IRC. Pretty pathetic is what the case study was rated at by our
group. Future tests might be interesting in different languages to determine
whether this is a North American phenomenon or not.
