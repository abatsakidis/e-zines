#032 - [ The Alleged Elites were Alleged Losers once ]
       [ xod ]


I was quite amused when I was reading this.  I thought i'd share it with
anyone interested.

I was looking through textfiles.com and I found the following file..

---

OFFICIAL 1984 LOZERLIST by The Atom
THE BIGGEST WELL KNOWN LOZERS  - 3/3/85

---

Full file can be found here: http://www.textfiles.com/phreak/lozers.hum

While looking through the 'Loser Phreaks' section I noticed that the
infamous Lex Luthor, of LOD fame was the 4th name in the list.

Here is an interesting extract from the text regarding Lex Luthor..

---

Has alot of connections in the phreak world because just
about everyone who is currently active in the phreak area thinks he is
great.  No real connect- ions with any "real world people", Started the
group "Legion Of Doom" (isnt he imaginative?), which seemed to prosper for
about 6 months, & then sort of fell apart.

---

Heh.

Legion of Doom also recieved the privilege of being awarded 2nd place in
the 'Loser Phreak Groups of the Year' section.  The 1st place went to 
the group Knights of Shadow, which Lex Luthor was also a member of. 

Here is an extract from the file explaning why LOD recieved 2nd place.

--

Sort of Lex Luthers attempt at trying to follow in the footsteps of TKOS and
start a new elite group.  Well is failed miserably, and as the group it was
modeled after (TKOS) it did nothing at all, but threaten people.  In
comparison to TKOS it was really a poor imitation while TKOS had mostly
big-name phreaks in it, LOD started with a bunch of unkowns (Blotto, Razor,
X-man, etc, basically the people who weren't considered good enough to get
into TKOS itself) hoping the group would become notorious enough on its own.
It appears to have worked, and the group LOD still exists, but it does
nothing at all.

Heh. :> 

LOD then went on to become one of the most infamous h/p groups of all time
as well as producing the elite LOD Technical Journals.
