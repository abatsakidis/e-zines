ilamai was due to say her thing.  But she's lying on the bed semi-asleep,
and I quote.

"i ain't typing fuck."

I HAD TO CHANGE THE MP3.  SORRY.

Blackshark just announced to us how he had to go the toilet; so while he's
gone we can talk about him.

FYI.  visual studio 6 doesn't install on windows 2000 without you having
to cheat it.  You heard it here first, courtesy of the man they call the
black shark.

OK.

WE'RE GONNA FINISH THIS T-FILE NOW.

BYE!@#@!
