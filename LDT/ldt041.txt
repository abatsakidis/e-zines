#041 - [ Watching what you Watch: Theories on Propaganda and How it Twists Your Mind ]
       [ jvaldez ]


I'm sure (if you're american) you've seen the infamous "ROCKY IV"
(rocky four).  For those not inclined to Rocky movies (you're definitely not
american then) rocky's friend gets killed by a Russian (Communist) boxer
named Ivan Drago.  Basically, even though communist countries were not
allowed to compete in professional boxing, baseball, or any american sports
in general, this one boxer was able to come to the US and challenge Rocky.
Of course, the Soviet Union at that time was very secretive about things, so
naturally the movie producers overestimated russias technology levels. The
theory about this boxer was that he was specially 'bred' to box, which is a
joke within itself. Then, rocky goes to "Mother Russia" to fight this 6'7"
monster, and by the time the fight is over, naturally, rocky wins, and all
of russia cheers for Rocky. Let's analyze two things.

1. Rocky Defeats Ivan.
2. Rocky wins the heart of Russia. 
3. Fans of Ivan go to Rocky.

This, when you look very closely turns into.

1. Capatalism and The American Dream will *always* triumph bloodless
   communistic values.
2. Inside every russian commie, there is an american trying to get out.
3. Who doesn't want to be american?

Remember, these are just interpretations so they might be off a hair or two,
but the point is there. The government can *and* will influence movies that
will be shown all over the world. After I saw rocky iv, I didnt think about
being influenced by subliminal propaganda, I just thought it was a great
movie. But, after recent events, I've realized that was probably the biggest
propaganda movie I've seen so far.

Next case and point is this whole 24 hour coverage of the United States "WAR
ON TERRORISM." Can you say one big propaganda mess ? Let's not get confused
by the issues here, personally, I do think people should pay for the World
Trade Center incident. However, hearing about it day in and day out, over
the radio, the tv and newspapers is a bit much. I don't care how accurate our
bombs are hitting targets. I don't care that we are only taking out military
targets. I don't care if those people in the world trade center are ever
avenged. The government realizes this, and what could theoretically happen if
we didnt put propaganda on CNN 24 hours a day is this:

1. America as a nation would start to lose interest in this so called 'just
   vengence.'
2. Support would slowly die off for the military.
3. Military is called out of afghanistan, etc.
4. Military budget is cut.
5. Things go back to normal.

Unfortunately this is how things are going to be:

1. Everyday, by merely turning the TV or radio on, we will be angered once
   more by phrases like this:

	A. "Since the terrorist attack on that dreadful day of September 11..."
	B. "We are here interviewing another survivor of the the September 11
            incident.."
	C. "It has been approximately _____ days since September 11.."

2. Once outraged by being reminded of it we will:

	A. Not Re-evaluate our opinions on the matter.
	B. Support any action our government makes no matter what.
	C. Become blind war machines dead set on ridding the world of an
           islamic threat.

Are you skeptical ? I'm sure you are by now, because though my conclusions are
valid, they are a bit outlandish. Think about it though, did you ever think
about any causes? Here are some listed.

1. These so called terrorist groups are fighting a religious war against
   judaism. The United States has    intervened and taken the side of judaism
   (Israel, etc)
2. If we would've taken the side of Islamic factions, would jews be bombing
   our nation? Probably.
3. Everyday you hear somebody say "What'd we do to deserve this?" Immediately,
   somebody responds with "NOTHING! THOSE TOWEL HEAD BLAH BLAH BLAH DID THIS
   IN COLD BLOOD!!!" However, this is really wrong,    because:

	A. All the countries we support, are American supplied. They carry
           American M16 Rifles, wear American fatigues, etc.
	B. By supplying a side with weapons, we are automatically drafted into
           a war. Examples: World War I & II, Korea, Vietnam, Etc.

4. You can't blame yourself, and you can't blame the enemy.. Who can you
   blame? THE MILITARY. The average US citiczen has *NO* control of foreign
   policy affairs, so those who are in office are to blame.


Perhaps this has drifted a little bit, but I've tried to stick to one issue,
(the terrorist attack) and it seems that most need to reevaluate their
opinions on this. Try not to be so influenced by the pictures of people
covered in ashes, the MTV song, or even CNN. Remember, everyone is getting
paid to propagate you so that you in turn will blindly follow some sort of
American conquest. America is a country, it cannot be classified into good or
evil. Good and evil are in the hearts of people. Think about it before you go
ranting about what kind of revenge we should go after.
