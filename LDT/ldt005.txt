#005 - [ Telco Kid ]
       [ xod ]

He ran and ran, its all he could think of to do.  

And no, i'm not talking about Forrest Gump.

I'm talking about an unnamed individual, a nobody yet an anybody.
It could be you for all I know.

I'm sure we all know someone similar.

A so-called Hacker or Telephone enthusiast.  So-called because the person 
in question is no more than a kid out of his depth.  He doesn't understand.  
But then again no one understands him..

A - 'Man, i'm so bored.'
B - 'Whatcha wanna do?'
A - 'Hey lets go trashing'
B - 'Why?'
A - 'So we can get our hands on some neat telco docs!'
B - 'What we gonna do with them once we get them?'
A - 'Get free fone calls man!'
B - 'Er.. Ok!'

So off they went.  Down the road to the big telco building at the end of 
the street.

The main gate was locked.  It was 10pm.  Waiting to make sure no one was 
around they climbed the wall, it wasn't too hard to jump up and get over.  
21 seconds later they were in telco property.

B - 'Er.. Are you sure we should be doing this?'
A - 'Relax, I've done this thousands of times'

It was actually only the second time he had been on the premises, the 
first being yesterday, when he walked through the main gates during his 
school lunch-hour when he wanted to make sure there was lots of trash 
to check through.  

He was too determined to back out now.

They soon made their way to the trash.

B - 'Er.. There is no garbage, nothing, the trash is empty'
A - 'Shit! It was full last night, fuck'
B - 'Now what do we do?'

Hmmm.  They scoped out the area, Kid A noticed a ground floor window 
was slightly a-jar.

A - 'The Window, c'mon lets go inside'
B - 'Do you really think we should?  Thats breaking & entering man.'
A - 'I know, but man, think of the stuff we can get out of there.'

The two walked up to the window.  Kid A put his hand in the gap and 
pulled the hinge, opening the window with enough gap for them to fit 
through.

They climbed through, using an empty plastic container they had found 
near the trash to stand on so they had enough thrust to pull themselves 
up and through the window.

Kid A was now inside the building, while Kid B was still struggling to 
get through the window.  He had a dubious look on his face, a worried 
look.  He seemed scared but he still carried on pushing himself up and 
through the window.

They were now both inside, looking in awe around the building.  
The Equipment.  The Terminals.  The Documents.

Neither of them really had a clue what they were looking for.

Kid B was getting really nervous; It was obvious he didn't want to be 
here long.

B - 'Can we just grab some stuff and go please?'
A - 'Yea no problem, wait.. lets go through this door here..'

Kid A reached for the handle, the door opened, and instantly..

B - 'SHIT! SHIT! SHIT!'
A - 'SHIT! SHIT! SHIT!'
A - 'FUCKING RUN!'

The door must have been hooked up to an alarm system and once opened 
it was triggered.  The noise was literally unbearable.  They knew 
they had to get out of there, fast.

They both ran towards the still open window.  Kid B literally threw 
himself through the window falling on the gravel below as he landed.  
Kid A quickly followed clambering through the window with a bit more 
caution but still at speed.

They both ran as fast as they could toward the wall they came over, 
without care of who was around they both jumped over the wall.  They 
could still hear the alarm, the ringing in their ears making it seem 
more intense than it probably was but they didn't care, they had to 
get as far away as possible, and fast.

They finally made it home.  Both of them looking as white as sheep.  
Scared shitless, and they had acquired no docs from their journey, 
the alarm put an end to that objective.  I guess they'll have to 
wait a while before they can make their 'free fonecalls'.

Did they ever get caught for their elite b&e techniques?
What do you think? heh.

The moral of the story is (we gotta have a moral, heh.)..


		  *** Don't be a kiddy ***
		*** Learn before you act ***
                *** Think before you act ***
             *** It'll be better in the end ***
