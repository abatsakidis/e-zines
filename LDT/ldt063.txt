#063 - [ Sleeping on the Couch ]
       [ xod ]


She's asleep on the couch.

I don't want her to wake up.  At least not yet.

I want to be the one to wake her up.  I want to tell her its time for bed.

I want to tell her it's time to go upstairs.  Time to go to sleep.  Time to
end the day and prepare for the beginning of the next.

She always goes to sleep before me, but I don't mind.

She always wakes up before me, but I don't mind.  Infact I like it.

I always wake up when she comes upstairs to have a cigarette.  I like that.
It reminds me that I have something important to wake up for.  Some point to
my existance.  I like it when she wakes me up before i'm ready to awake from
my from sleep.  I love to see her face, hear her voice saying hello, feel her
touch as she sits on the bed near the window ready to smoke a cigarette.

Right now I keep looking towards the couch.  I want to make sure she is still
sleeping.  The last thing I want is for her to wake right now.  Half awake,
Half asleep, staggering over to me, telling me how she is going upstairs to
sleep.  It's my job to tell her that, my job to wake her.

Usually she doesn't like sleeping on the couch.  Usually she says how she is
going upstairs hours before I feel like joining her in sleep.  Tonight is
different, maybe because she is slightly drunk, or maybe because she is
extremely tired.  Either way, i'm glad she is down here with me.  I'm happy
that I will be the one to wake her and tell her that it's time for bed.

I'm happy she's sleeping on the couch.
