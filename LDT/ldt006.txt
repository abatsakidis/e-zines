#006 - [ Lagwagon Lyrics ]
       [ keno ]


I was thinking about songs.  Just the sheer power they can provide, the 
emotion, the strength of a song. They can make you happy, they can make 
you sad, feelings of joy, feelings of pain.  Memories of people, places, 
things and times.  

Great things: songs.

I thought i'd type up a couple lyrics of songs below.  The album that 
these songs are from (Hoss) I was playing out a lot in Summer 1998 I 
remember.

The great thing I always found about Lagwagon songs, paticularly the 
whole of 'Hoss' was that there was so much power and emotion behind 
the instruments.  Beautiful harmonys and lines, some of the greatest 
changes in speed and flow into the next verse/chorus/bridge/etc.  
A perfect balance between instruments and vocals.  Great use of 
stopping and starting etc.  If you hear the songs i'm sure you'll 
know what I mean.

Get hold of the songs and listen to them.  The beauty is in the music.

--> Lagwagon - Black Eyes


He knows no shame and takes no blame 
This simpleton sees everything 
He's only satisfied to point out other's mistakes 
Never afraid to use his pride 

his tradition is old 
his faith a hand-me-down 
the family 
he wears them on his sleeve 
morale and value left under a christmas tree 
he once had the gift 
this image in his grandparents eyes 
no guns, no drugs, no rape, no end 

this vacant soul is pale and blue 
in empty gaze his crow's feet are a vision of defeat 
sick and tired of the meaninglessness 
the irrationale he's desensitised 
his every need and emotion 
a cup half empty but full of euphoria 
he's searching for the light switch in the dark 
to switch his routine 
to find a reason 
to find faith and piece of mind 
when one to many beliefs die 
it's tough to see through these black eyes 

everyone forgives, everyone forgets 
everyone is true and no one here will lie to you 
he knows the truth, he knows the truth 
here nothing's certain disregard what you've learned 
to find faith in piece of mind all of their gods died with his peace 
i should know him that heathen’s me 


--> Lagwagon - Shaving Your Head


We used to watch them fall 
and you saw them distraught 
but the attention that they got it surrounds them 
for years we watched them enslaved and we could only laugh 
what a loser, what a shame 
said we'd never play the... 

and now it seems you haven't learned the lesson 
i guess you have to share the pain 
and now the tainted blood leaves stains behind your back 
and in their words i hear your shame 

how can you lie to me? 
in your eyes i can see 
glazed and vacant 
as you're caught in the act 
you've always wanted this 
now you feel the stab 
are you happy to be sad?
is there pleasure in the...?

and now it seems you haven't learned the lesson 
i guess you have to share the pain 
but now the tainted blood leaves stains behind your back 
and in their words i hear your shame 

as it makes you sick 
do i make you scared?
when you see what you once were 
as you're shaving your head 

the scared boy thinks he's safe 
if you can't read his eyes 
but you can read 
you can read his eyes 
his lies..
