#090 - [ What are you good at? ]
       [ jvaldez ]


Lately, I've noticed a lot of things about me, mostly because I've been
studying the way I and others interact with society. Imagine this, you are a
football player, you are the best on the team, the best in the district, the
best in the state. You are not me. You are good at one thing; the best even.
Here is my theory on what I'm good at.

Not to be self indulgent, but I have noticed I can excel in anything. When I
mean anything, I mean anything. I started off with computers, slowly learning
every aspect that I wanted to know about them right? I became really good at
them and then I met others who were better than I was. Discouraged I stuck
with it and got better too, but never better than them. Then I took up auto
repair (mechanics) and goofed with that for awhile. I could figure out
problems and how to solve them sure, but certainly not as fast or as decent
as others. Others were better than me. Sure I was good at it, but they were
better. So then I moved in to playing a certain online multiplayer first
person shooter game. I have become really good at this as well, but not the
best. There is always somebody better. Always. Somebody. Better.

This is what infuriates me the most, knowing in my heart there is always
somebody better at everything than I am. Of course, here is the way I look
at things for a more positive view.

Best of the Best:
A. You are good at one thing, *THE* Best. You suck otherwise. You spend
countless hours fine tuning your ability in (whatever) and in doing so you
have become the best. You have even got to extraordinairy lengths and a hermit
like existence to become the best. In your heart, it is and was totally worth
it.

Adaptive Kind:
B. I am mediocre at many things, I can get almost anything done, but don't
expect me to be perfect. Give me a quick briefing and 30 minutes I'll have the
hang of it in no time. My attention span lasts only as long as curiousity
lingers within my mental state. After that, consider it dropped until I need
to use this skill / thing again. While I'm doing the same old same old, I'm
dreaming up better, and newer things to do.

This concludes into this (possibly my mental attitude on things might be a
little warped for the average reader.)

A. You have a handy career in ( career field here ) but you will have nothing
but ( same career field prev. ) to be good at when you get bored of ( again
same career field) if ever.

B. I am handy in a number of aspects including ( job specific stuff here ) and
have an amazing ability of adaptation.

What does this mean? Perhaps even when we all get jobs at giant corporations
and we all get downsized, maybe we, the adaptive kind of people, rather than
the perfectionist/best-of-the-best type of people will be able to steal jobs
that would only be suited for the bestofthebest people, because we can adapt
to make the fallacy that we are more qualified. Of course that is a mere pipe
dream if you look at it from the big picture. In doing so however, the best
of the best people will be left heartbroken and financial corrupted because
there is nothing that involves an actual skill they can do except for the one
they are the best at.

So now that leaves us with:

Who is better? Adaptive or BOB (Best of the Best) type of people

Let's think about it this way:

A. Best of the best people are sought out by many corporations and companies
   eager to bring fresh new minds in.
B. Let's say out of the 260 Million in the US, 2% of that are Best of the Best
   type of people.
C. The other 98% are split up like so:
	1. 78% of those people are uneducated (only have GED, high school
           diploma, or none)
	2. 20% of those people are me (the adaptive kind) and have an
           education.
D. Now if we narrow it down to just say there are 10 jobs available to
   best-of-the-best type people only.
	1. there is 10 adaptives for every 1 best of the best right?
	2. If statement above is true, then 9 of us can con our way into a
           corporation for less than half the work the best of the best people
           did.
        3. If there are a thousand best of the best, there are always going to
           be at least 10 thousand adaptives trying to con our way into a job.
	4. The likely hood of adaptives getting jobs over the best-of-the-best
           type of people is that we have social interaction skills. (see
           hermit reference above) And our social interaction skills outclass
           and out weigh your technical knowledge / ability because we know
           how to get along with managers and how to carry ourselves around
           the work place.

My last argument is:

Is there a median? An adaptive-best-of-the-best person out there? Somebody who
can excel completely and be the best in one thing, but at the same time be
pretty good at other things? Do you view yourself as one of these people? If
you do you should probably think about yourself some more and come up with at
least 10 things including the one you are best at to prove it, not to me, but
rather to yourself. Everyone is a little self indulgent at times, but try and
be as honest as possible. What are you really good at ? Why ? Who said this?
Do you believe in yourself? Do you trust in your ability? Can you trust in
your abilities ? Are you the one?

Just something to leave you blinking for 2 days,

jvaldez.
