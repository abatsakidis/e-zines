vicious you.
you're just another letter. threehanded letter. and i never ever loved 
you. 

he awoke with a slap, with a bang, with a little sigh. of these he only 
owned one, and his throat was raw. his skin was raw. red. redundant 
after midnight. 

looking for titles to envelop the night. looking for tapestry, for 
covers. looking for a best lover to hold, someone with arms, without 
questions. later, the questions. 

another book, another paragraph and the repetition in yet another 
paragraph from his mind's small, sneering calligraphy. he doesn't make 
mistakes. his mind. it doesn't make mistakes. 

another book. entitled 'another book' because it can't be 'another 
broken heart' because there is no heart to speak of because he's lost 
it. and it's such a hard concept to bear, a heavy heart like an 
oxymoron. emptiness is heavy. emptiness is ridiculously heavy. it waves 
and tantalises and laughs. 

he stares. 

vicious you. he starts again, quotation marks-less. he starts, stands up 
running hands and locking doors -- as in an afterthought. and where is 
the aftertaste? himself. all he ever ever had.
