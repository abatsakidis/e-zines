#020 - [ Pale Blue Dot ]
       [ BlackShark ]

BlackShark presents ""Pale BLue Dot", Something that sums up what i have
said for a VERY long time!" Its taken from "Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the
Human Future in Space by Carl Sagan, Random House, 1994" Found on the
website: http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/pale_blue_dot.html

Check the picture at this address to see what it refers to.

Now i dont like just copy and pasting but i thought this was something that
perfectly summed up what i have said for along time but will save me having
to type it out! :)

Enjoy people.
BlackShark.

"Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone
you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being
who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering,
thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every
hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of
civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every
mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of
morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader,"
every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there - on a mote
of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers
of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors, so that, in glory and
triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.
Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of
this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner,
how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another,
how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the
delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are
challenged by this point of pale light.

Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our
obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from
elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere
else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit,
yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we
make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character building
experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human
conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores
our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve
and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known. "
