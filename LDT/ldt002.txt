#002 - [ Another day Another Dollar ]
       [ - xod ]


Another day, another dollar.  So the expression goes.  But in my case, its
more like Another day, another wasted dollar.  Another opportunity to be
making some money gone.

I wouldn't really care if it weren't a necessity of life.  I mean, I get
money, and I spend it.  I guess in a communist utopia everything would be
different, heh.

The basic problem is, I'm looking for a job.

So here is the deal.  

All your school life you are told to study hard, go onto university,
study hard, then you'll come out of university with a nice job waiting on
a comfortable starting salary.

Hmmmm.

Ok, I do the whole University thing, but now what?

I handed my CV/Resume to like 15/20 recruitment agencies and they all say
the same thing.

'You don't have enough commercial experience'.  
'They need someone with more experience'
'You say you know this but do you have commercial experience?'

So, erm, there must be something wrong here.

Why did I waste 3 years of my life at a University where I learnt more by
myself in my bedroom than I ever did in lectures?

Because that's what everyone tells you is right all your life.

So, now i'm here with no money.  I'm over 1.5k overdrawn at the bank, I have
like 10k of loans to repay, and for what?

Nothing.

I should have just got an entry level position at 18, and worked up the
ladder.  I'd have 3 years 'commercial experience' behind me by now.  Heh.
Oh well.  I'm sure the opportunity will come along one day soon.

It's just a lesson really.  

Don't believe those who say 'college will guarantee you a good job'

Perhaps 10-20 years ago it did.

But not here.  Not now.
