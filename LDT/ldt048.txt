#048 - [ Socrates in Action ]
       [ n0soul ]
                   
                                   
EUTHYPHRO

We all know who Socrates is, an arrogant, ugly, old, know it all, cunt. 
(although some of his ideas are quite cool)

Before we start i would like to tell you a theory of my own, When i 
first discovered Socrates and found out some things about him, the first 
thing i thought was that he was a major stoner.  There is a type of 
cactus that grows in the sort of environment that Socrates lived, you 
may know the type, its called peyote (and i bet there were alot of 
other natural drugs for Socrates to get high on) the peyote cactus is a 
hallucinogenic drug that gives similar to LSD (invented by another 
genius, and pushed to greatness by Timothy Leary) this is just the drug 
Socrates needed to see his oracle and communicate with the gods. Also 
Socrates use to stand on one spot for hours and hours in a total daze 
talking mumbo jumbo, another effect of the drugs. Drugs eventually got 
to Socrates and caused his demise. When Socrates was taken to court by 
Meletus (for corrupting the minds of the young and worshipping false 
idols) he eventuly lost the battle ( and didnt put up much of a fight, i 
guess he thought it was good though, and at least he said what he 
thought was right (so we'll give him that) ) The way the courts worked 
back then was each party got to decide a punishment e.g. Meletus & 
Socrates both got to choose a punishment for the guilty, Meletus wanted 
to give Socrates the death penalty, where Socrates chose that the state 
should pay him for what he was doing (he never worked, had lots of 
kids, and stood around, argued, and pondered all day) the jury obviously 
found this punishment crazy and had to go with the death penalty (they 
didnt want Socrates dead, they thought he would chose banishment) so off 
Socrates went to prison, only to drink hemlock a few days later (he had 
the chance to escape but did not because the drugs made Socrates very 
lazy)

any way this was going to be comments on Euthyphro and Socrates 
conversation out side the court house(Socrates was waiting to be 
charged, Euthyphro was going to charge/challenge his farther (who 
happened to starve a slave to death) for manslaughter). But now i feel 
that ive trailed on for to long, and its time for a smoke, and im to 
lazy to type the rest, perhaps another time.

                                                                
                                                                   n0soul
                                                                 17/10/01
