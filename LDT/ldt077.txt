#077 - [ Originality Is The Key ]
       [ xod ]


Originality is the key.

			The Key to what?

		The key to your heart?
					
				The key to the lock on the door?

The key to what?

Originality.

Is there such a thing?

		We all try to be different.

			But we're probably all the same.

			All trying to be..

				Different.
				Unique.
				Interesting.
				Original.

All trying to create that seminal piece of art.  
				  piece of film.  
                                  piece of writing.
                                  piece of music.
                                  piece of speech.

Not just artists.

				Everyone.

Well..

		Maybe not everyone.

But defiently the majority..

		But, the majority is mainstream.
			
		    Unoriginal.  Reiterated.  Boring.  Shite.

                How can we be different, unique, interesting, original..

        Without first recycling old ideas, old thoughts, old feelings?


                        Short Answer...


                        We can't.
