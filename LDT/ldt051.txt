#051 - [ White House, we're on to You ]
       [ xod ]


I think the script writers of 'Police Academy II: Their First Assignment'
should contact The White House.  I think they're owed some money perhaps.  I
always thought it was wrong to use something from someone else's speech in
one of your own, unless you acknowledge the source.

Did George Bush acknowledge the Police Academy II script writers when he gave
one of his war speeches after the Terrorist Attacks?

Not to my knowledge, no.

Captain Eric Lassard makes a speech regarding the war on the gang that is
terrorising his precinct after he is trapped down an alleyway and spray
painted by a gang of 15-20 'punks'.

'This is war.  It is not a war which we asked for.  But we will go to war,
 and we will win the war'

Hrm, Sound familiar?

Is this an in-house joke; putting quotes from comedy movies into the
president's speeches because a lot of people think he is kinda dumb?

Is it simply that the Police Academy II script writers have moved on, and are
now official speech writers for the White House?

Who knows, but hrm, if I was a Police Academy II script writer, i'd be
hassling The White House for my royalties.

White House, we're on to you.
