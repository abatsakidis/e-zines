<xod> idler :<
<xod> he was an idle idler
<xod> he left his computer on all day
<xod> idling in a channel
<xod> where no one ever talks
<xod> i'd talk, if you'd talk, but you're idle, so i don't.
<xod> i sit and i wait, judging from your idle time, i'll be waiting for a
        while.
<xod> thats all we ever do, idle, idle, idle.
<xod> surely there is more to life than idling.
<xod> surely there is more to irc than idling.
<xod> you'd think so, but no.
<xod> its a bottomless pit of idleness.
<xod> a neverending story of conflict between life & irc.
<xod> choose life.
<xod> choose idleness.
<xod> choose /away.
<xod> choose leaving on your computer.
<xod> choose idle times the length of weekends.
<xod> brb, afk, only to return days later.
<xod> choose watching tv, reading a book and boycotting your computer.
<xod> choose chilling with friends, raiding the fridge and drinking pepsi cola.
<xod> choose decorating your house in a range of fucking fabrics.
<xod> choose drinking beer and wondering why the fuck you did on a sunday
        morning.
<xod> don't choose sitting in your swivel chair looking at mind-numbing,
        spirit-crushing irc sessions, stuffing fucking junkfood in your mouth.
<xod> don't choose rotting away at the end of it all, pishing your last in
        some miserable channel, nothing more than an embaressment to the
        selfish, fucked up eggdrop bot you use to replace yourself.
<xod> choose your future.
<xod> don't choose irc.
<xod> choose idle.
