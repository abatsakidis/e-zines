#001 - [ infiltr8 ]
       [ - xod    ]


They say a good pop song has to have a hook.  It has to have a good chorus
and it has to hit a certain note of familiarity or repetition to the listener
while at the same time remaining individual enough to stand its own ground.

Hmmm.  So where did pop go wrong?
(I'm not saying it was ever right, I am merely questioning the unwritten law
of pop songs)

I mean, you just have to switch on the TV and you are surrounded by the
sounds of boy bands and solo artists who have about as much individuality
as a haircut at a skinheads convention.

It's not about a hook anymore.  It's about infiltration.

Infiltration of our minds and what we hear.

It's been the same for many years but I dunno, I just feel the infiltration
has increased dramatically over the past few years.

What follows is a prime example.

You hear a song on the radio.  You also hear the same song on TV.  You hear
the same song in the background of another TV show.  You hear the same song
in shops/stores.  You hear the same song when you go out, even when you walk
down the street if some 12 year old has her bedroom window open and her stereo 
too loud.  The only method of escape is by living as a hermit in the
Outer Hebrides or some other remote island where the population of goats
exceeds people.

The song then remains in your head.  You wake up the next day humming a tune.  

- "Hrm, whats this tune?" --> "da da dee dee da da la la da"
- "Ahh, thats the new <insert-shite-pop-act-here> song"

Then you proceed to say how you don't even like the song. 

No one believes you.  

Branded for life.
