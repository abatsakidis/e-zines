#076 - [ Just Do It ]
       [ n0soul ]


We DO all have the same intellect

You will notice in your everyday life that some people seem smarter or 
dumber than you (in most cases you will think they are dumber because 
you’re a geek buzzed on coke and bloated with useless facts those 
no-one else cares about).

But anyway, intellect is generated by your life style/situation. You 
would have seen that 90 % of the really smart people are brought up in a 
family environment, two parents brother or sister. A lot of the time 
their parents will be intelligent too, they recognize the importance of 
education and have made their kids study hard out from an early age. It 
is likely that they were treated this way by their parents.

I am not talking about genetics I don’t even believe that genetics 
have anything to do with how smart a person is, e.g. real brainy kids 
with dumb parents. In these cases it is the child that has found an 
interest and has actively worked on improving his or her knowledge about 
it. 

What defines a brainy/smart person? The word bright comes to mind. A 
bright person is not only intelligent but also talented the worlds have 
similar meanings but I believe a talented person has the ability or 
powers to be creative, not just recalling information from books. 
Talented people are few and far between, they have the edge on 
intelligent people as they are likely to be good in arts such as 
painting, sports, chess, golf, writing, and musical instruments.

But all humans can be brainy smart etc. (well what the majority of the 
population believes to be smart) (except people born deaf and blind). 
Its just a matter of the individual, when some people discover this fact 
for themselves they believe it to be to late for me. This is not 
true if you really strive to be smart then you will be, there is no 
question, some people say that they would study if they had the time. 
These people will never achieve their goals because if you want 
something bad enough you are willing to climb obstacles and change your 
life, e.g. I had a nap after school the other day and my mum asked me 
why I had a nap, I said I was tired, she then went on to say, you 
think you're tired imagine how I feel working all day and then coming 
home to cook tea etc.. I told her to stop making excuses but she 
strongly believed that she was not and I could not convince her. This 
is the mentality that will not get you anywhere, and these people will 
never achieve their full potential.

Don’t make excuses for yourself JUST DO IT (breach of copy write 
laws, I love my Nikes, Opps)
