#016 - [ Angelica ]
       [ ila mai ]

TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD RUGRAT

The title is not a metaphor. Nor is it symbolism of any kind.

My sister is a twenty three year old Angelica. Her boyfriend is her 'Cynthia'.
He follows her everywhere, obeys every word and is also going slightly bald.

The reasons i say this is the differences between her, myself and my other 
elder sister.

She left home to go to uni and has rarely been back since. She supports 
herself and her two year old son in the middle of London. Not a cheap place 
to live.  My other sister, Angelica i will call her is still at uni, with a 
good job (ie: not working in a supermarket like most of us students have to).  
She lives in a three bedroomed house with a relatively wealthy boyfriend who 
is also a student who also works for a computing company.

Therefore my point being, she gets her loan.  She gets her boyfriends loan. 
She gets her paypacket every month aswell as his minimum 400 squids a month.

So, how is that aproximately every two months she rings up my dad and asks 
to 'borrow' a couple of hundred pounds?  Everyone knows in my family that 
borrow means have; And she gets it everytime.  Just like Angelica gets 
whatever she wants when she puts on that pathetic girly voice.  Let it be 
said, i am a student that has to pay for everything myself, tuition fees, 
rent, everyone elses share of the phone bill, i have no job because no one 
is going to employ someone who's been arrested.  If i ask for a tenner to go 
out with (not nearly enuff for a decent night) when i'm on holiday, my dad 
snubs and huffs.  This is the only money i have asked for since i started 
uni.  I am only twenty.

My dad just bought a new car. Our old one is mine, until i go back to uni 
then Angelica gets it. Even though her boyfriend Cynthia has a mondeo 
already, that is barely two years old.  She drives it more than him, 
because obviously, really it's hers.

My sister seems to spend a horrendous amount of money.  Any spare money i 
have goes on cigs to keep me being polite to people like this.

I am lucky if i get my hair cut once evry four months.  When i do i either 
get a friend to do it for free or i go to the cheapest place possible and 
get it done for eight pounds.  Not out of choice, this is all i can afford. 
Angelica gets hers done at a Toni and Guy every month.

I needed a new pair of trainers. I were them everyday so after a year they 
get battered.  Usually i don't wear socks but i had start because my 
trainers were in such a state that my feet would bleed when ever i walked 
any distance.  My dad refused to buy me new ones, too expensive.  A mere 
fifty pounds a year is not too horrendous.  After two years of this and 
these trainers i eventually saved enough to buy my own.  My sister rang up 
once needing a new pair too.  She rarely wears them.  He, like he does with 
everything, drove sixty miles to her house and bought her some on the spot.

There is more, but i can't be bothered. She bores me because she is 
so predictable.

You make think i'm jealous.

If you knew me and Angelica then you would know i'm a cinderella.  

I buy a pumpkin every halloween and carve it in hope.
