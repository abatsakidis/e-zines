#030 - [ Typical College Student Living Typical Student Life ]
       [ jvaldez ]



Odd to me, how most people have misconceptions about college. I hear, man the
parties must be awesome and it must be great meeting all those new people.
When people say this to me, I can't help but laugh at their 'after school
special' idea of college and their concepts and theories.  Where I goto
college, it's really no picnic. I don't drink that often, I go to class
everyday, I try to sleep well, and I study a whole lot. College isn't fun and
games, its work work work. That's why its so fun. I love college because that
means it's just one less year in the thirty or forty coming up that I have to
work a full time job. Yes, you may join a fraternity or whatever, but those in
my opinion are a big joke. You are 'initiated' and suddenly you're a
'brother'?  Give me a break, trust is earned, not given through some half
asked initiation ritual.

Why College is Fun:

Girls are everywhere, if you like that sort of thing, and its all about you
furthering your education? If you're asking yourself why you would want to go
to school for four more years, perhaps college isn't for you. I hate people
who consider themselves 'hackers' and then complain about school. I'm sorry,
I love school, because I get to learn something new, regardless if I need it
or not. If I had a choice to go to work, or continue to go to college for the
rest of my life, learning new shit everyday, I think we both know what I would
choose.

Parties are kind of fun, because everyone has the same cares and due dates.
You get to bitch about professors and how they teach their classes, or when is
the last time to drop classes, or even how late you were to physics and still
passed the test.  The downside of these parties is you get to meet fucks that
don't go to college that preach that college is useless yada yada yada. Makes
me laugh some more. The parties are neat too, because you don't have to see
the high school 'stars' that were top of their class because they get filtered
out within the first year. Those type of people are the guys/girls that
believed the movie "animal house" was a factual depiction of what college is
like. You'll find the "new" popular people are usually guys with a lot of
knowledge, semi to very athletic, and usually good looking. Pretty much the
best of all worlds I would expect. Parties (big ones) only happen after
certain college 'holidays.' Typical ones being after midterms and after
finals, no real weirdness there, after a week of finals I know I find myself
in need of a beer.

Why College Sucks:

Imagine yourself going to a day job you like. You get paid a decent wage, you
do your work, you get by in life. Heres the situation with college, its
exactly like a day job, but you take home your work and you don't get paid for
it (unless you got a *real* nice scholarship) Everyday you have to push
yourself to want to go to school, and believe me, this is hard. Today even, I
missed class, and I feel like a real piece of shit because of it. I pay a lot
of money to go to school, just so I can miss it ? Fuck that. Missing class is
probably 40% of the reason why most typical college students fail out. Missing
class bites the big one. Also the mere cost of buying shit on campus is
outrageous as well. Last year i spent 500 dollars on books alone. For four
classes and a lab no less! Driving to school sucks as well, mostly because of
the traffic, and at my university, the parking is so bad, it makes me want to
puke. Dealing with angry college students in vehicles is a bad, bad thing.

Alcoholism on campus isn't really such a big thing, but there are a lot of
drinkers. You'll notice after going to school for awhile, everyone drinks,
but the thing that separates them is this:

1. Do they drink a beer or a few beers every night?
2. Do they drink a beer or a few beers on occasion?

Now, number two, I don't mind at all, because I do drink on occassion. I never
drink and drive, and I only drink at the place I am going to stay. I drink
usually when im tired or relaxing (i.e. not going anywhere) and when going
to parties and drinking there is *always* a D.D. You don't want to ruin your
life and lose your education because you die in a car wreck do you? I don't.
If you know people who drink every night and all they do is drink, I hate to
say it, but these people are usually losers. They don't go to class because
they are hung over from drinking the night before, and they don't study or
help out in anyway because they're too busy drinking. My recommendation is, to
continue your education and do well, do not hang out with these guys, or do so
on rare occasion.

Drugs is another deal which I'd like to cover. Everyone has had their stint
with some drug or another, I know I used to smoke pot/weed/whatever when I was
a sophmore in high school. Not a day goes by that I don't regret the choices
I made as a 14 year old. Drugs can be big on campus but I havent noticed a
significant drug trafficking deal on campus yet, but I would still recommend
against them. In the end they bring you more enemies than friends and besides,
if drugs were big on campus, more people would be going wouldn't they? I mean,
most of the druggies from your highschool basically dropped out and are
currently doing drugs because they have nothing else that makes them happier.
Let them be fucks, and let you get an education.

Your choice in the end:

College (for me) is fun. It's a lot of work, but I know in the end, it will
help me get that Porsche 959 I dream of day and night. Someday yes, AWD 600
HP Twin Turbo Porsche machine.. oh yes..

Be You.
