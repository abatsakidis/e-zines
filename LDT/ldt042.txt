#042 - [ The Truths of Sleep ]
       [ n0soul ]


we have all had those days (some more than others) when you just cant sleep.
You role over a number of times, left right left right back right left, after
time you notice you still dont feel tired, you decide to try a trick that has
never worked before and probably wont work again but you are in agony lying
around for ages, you role onto your stomach, yup, this is the most
unconvertible yet.

hmmmm hmmmm, what to do, wank, watch tv, get a drink, have a smoke.  these
are all ok ideas a wank will burn of some energy and make you feel good for
a while, watch tv is ok too if you dont mind the burning light against your
eyes, and smoking is a good idea your heart rate will be up for a while and
that will feel good to but you still wont be able to sleep

try and think of nothing, thinking of nothing provokes strange thoughts. you
will come up with wacky ideas that you can play with for a while and develop, 
(WARNING: the next day these ideas will seem absolutely ludicrous and you wont
ever mention them to any one, but for now they are great). soon you will be
forced to look at the clock, which is a definite no no your ideas will fade
and you will get frustrated. now you tell your self that you are very serious
and you need to sleep now, for that early morning.

you lie there and open and close your eyes a few times, the CD you were 
listening to has finished and the only thing you can hear is the hypnotic hum
of your computers fan's now you start to think about computers (dont you) but
this is the worst thing to do if you are trying to sleep, if you think of
something totally cool you will get really excited you build the idea and
make big plans for your next free time to put your plan to action, which is
all fine and good, although if your idea fails you will spend hours trying to 
make it work/get it right in some cases it will be great once you get it
going, but more often than not its a waste of time and will leave you angry.

back to the topic of sleep

you feel too hot, so you pull back the sheet, um now to cold.
your one pillow feels to thin, so you get another, um to high.

anyway, the main point im trying to get across here is -
                                        When you cant sleep it totally sux.

                                                                     n0soul
