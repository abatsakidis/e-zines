#007 - [ Weezer Lyrics ]
       [ keno ]


I'm on a bit of a roll here, so i'll step onto a few more songs from a 
different band.. Weezer.

I checked out their new album (The Green Album) and I didn't really like 
it at first.  I thought the single, Hash Pipe, was pretty basic and 
personally, kinda poor for what I have come to expect from a Weezer song, 
heh.  However, I listened to it some more and there were a few songs on 
there I really liked, so my opinions of it have risen.

They say that any bands second album is reknown for being the tricky one 
to write.  It has to live up to peoples expectations yet surpass the 
quality of the first in some way.  Weezer's second album 'Pinkerton' 
is my favourite by far.  It has some really beautiful songs on it.  Its 
as if the guy who wrote the tunes was going through some hard times 
with the females at the time, it really shines through in the songs at 
least..

Bah, I'll stop being boring now and get on with the lyrics.  Go out and 
get hold of these songs and give them a listen if you haven't already.


--> Weezer - Why Bother?


i know i should get next to you 
you've got a look that made me think you're cool 
but it's just sexual attraction 
it's nothing real 
so i'd better keep whackin 

why bother 
it's gonna hurt me 
it's gonna kill when you desert me 
this happened to me twice before 
it won't happen to me anymore 

i've known a lot of girls before 
what's the harm in knowing one more? 
maybe we could even get together 
maybe you could break my heart next summer 

why bother 
it's gonna hurt me 
it's gonna kill when you desert me 
this happened to me twice before 
it won't happen to me anymore 

it's a crying shame i'm all alone 
not with you, nor her, nor anyone 
won't deny me of my head 
crack it open and then i would share 

why bother 
it's gonna hurt me 
it's gonna kill when you desert me 
this happened to me twice before 
won't happen to me anymore

why bother 
it's gonna hurt me 
it's gonna kill when you desert me 
this happened to me twice before 
won't happen to me anymore

why bother 
it's gonna hurt me 
why bother 
it's gonna hurt me


--> Weezer - Across the Sea


you are eighteen year old girl 
who live in small city in japan 
you heard me on the radio 
about one year ago 
and you wanted to know all about me 
and my hobbies 
my favorite food and my birthday 

why are you so far away from me? 
i need help and you're way across the sea 
i could never touch you 
i think it would be wrong 
i've got your letter 
you've got my song 

they don't make stationery like this where i'm from 
so fragile 
so refined 
so i sniff (so i sniff) 
and i lick (and i lick) 
your envelopes 
fall to little pieces every time 

i wonder what clothes you wear to school 
i wonder how you decorate your room 
i wonder how you touch yourself 
and curse myself for being across the sea 

why are you so far away from me? 
i need help and you're way across the sea 
i could never touch you 
i think it would be wrong 
i've got your letter 
you've got my song 

at ten i shaved my head and tried to be a monk 
i thought the older women would like me if i did 
you see mom, i'm a good little boy (good little boy) 
it's all your fault, momma 

it's all your fault 
goddamn this business is really lame 
i gotta live on an island to find the truth 
so send me your love 
from all around the world 
so i gotta live on 
words and dreams and a million screams 
oh how i need a hand of mine to feel 

why are you so far away from me? 
why are you so far away from me? 

i could never touch you 
i think it would be wrong 
i've got your letter 
you've got my song 
i've got your letter 
you've got my song


--> Weezer - The Good Life


when i look in the mirror 
i can't believe what i see 
tell me who's that funky dude 
staring back at me 

folking bitten down 
can't even get around 
without an old man's cane 
i fall and hit the ground 
shivering in the cold 
bitter and alone 

excuse the bitchin 
i shouldn't complain 
i should have no feeling 
cause feeling is pain 

cause everything i need 
is denied me 
and everything i want 
is taken away from me 
but who do i got to blame 
nobody but me 

and i don't wanna be a old man anymore 
it's been a year or two since i was down on the floor 
shaking booty making sweet love all the night 
it's time i got back to the good life 
it's time i got back 
it's time i got back 
and i don't even know how i got off the track 
i wanna go back, yeah 

screw this crap i've had it 
i ain't no mr. cool 
i'm a pig i'm a dog 
so 'scuse me if i drool 

i ain't gonna hurt nobody 
ain't gonna cause a scene 
justly to admit i want sugar in my tea 
hear me, hear me, i want sugar in my tea 

and i don't wanna be a old man anymore 
it's been a year or two since i was down on the floor 
shakin' booty making sweet love all the night 
it's time i got back to the good life
it's time i got back
it's time i got back 
and i don't even know how i got off the track 
i wanna go back, yeah 

i wanna go back 
i wanna go back 
and i don't even know how i got off the track 
it's time i got back 
it's time i got back 
and i don't even know how i got off the track 
i wanna go back, yeah

and i don't wanna be a old man anymore 
it's been a year or two since i was down on the floor 
shakin' booty making sweet love all the night 
it's time i got back to the good life
it's time i got back
it's time i got back 
and i don't even know how i got off the track 
it's time i got back
it's time i got back
and i don't even know how i got off the track 
i wanna go back 
i wanna go back
