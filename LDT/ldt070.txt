#070 - [ Don't Read This its Shit ]
       [ n0soul ]

Well today its my birthday and im now 18 and old enough to drink in pubs 
(vote and all the other stuff) where I live (woohoo, hoot hoot etc.)

But there is a down side to this new found freedom and responsibility.
I am now subject to harsher laws and am able to go to jail, I don’t 
commit to much crime anyway but the idea is a bit scary. 

Another thing that sux on your birthday (well mine anyway) is my mum 
invites all these people over, it makes me really nervous for a few 
reasons. she calls me out of my room and away from my computer, not only 
does this take me away from the pacifying effects of technology but 
makes me have to socialize with people I would not normally talk to or 
be around. And when they give me gifts its even worse, I don’t know 
what to say and I don’t think I deserve to get anything from them nor 
need anything off them, I will still treat them the same as I would 
otherwise (even though I don’t mind getting gifts much, hypocrite huh)

Another thing that makes me feel strange is everybody treating me 
different and telling me its my birthday and being so happy, I don’t 
care! If someone can be happy for me on my birthday why cant they be 
happy for me the other 364 days a year, im still the same person!.

I don’t like it when people make a big deal about my birthday, I try 
to keep it pretty much low-key just so I don’t suffer from (the)* 
weirdness (factor)*.

Something unrelated to growing older 

Just reading Damian Rensh’s file the other day and the parts about the 
cops I just thought, what it would be like with no cops(pigs), so 
fucking dangerous (yes yes I know a lot of them are fuck wits) i have 
had unfair run-in’s with the porkers my self but I would not be brave 
enough to go out and fight crime and do the cop thing even with a gun
Anyway (just a idea)
