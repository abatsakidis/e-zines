Kinkos; Copy Place or College Student Defamation League

I'm sure you all are familiar with Kinkos Copy (c). As you probably know, they
do all sorts of copy jobs for all sorts of companies and people ranging from
business reports to the average copy.

Here was my dilemma:

I had a test coming up, and I like to write in my books. Unfortunately for us
college students, we don't get as good of a price when we sell our books back
if they are scribbled in. I have very sloppy penmanship and write only in pen
so I came up with this awesome idea. I could copy my chapters at minimal cost,
and be able to write in them without sacrificing the sell-back price of my
book. Sure I know what your thinking, "jeez, this guy is a genius," as I was,
but then I was hit with some weird law/regulation/bullshit (you pick).

Here is our basic text scenario.

(NOTE: Before this event, I had never been to a kinkos copy place, or ever
       cared to be. Now I really probably won't go back. Fascists.)

JV = jvaldez, KL = kinko lady

JV: Hi, I need some copies made <shows book to kinko lady>
KL: No can do.
JV: Um, what?
KL: Yes, that book is copyrighted, we, at least I, am not able to copy it.
JV: Hm, that's pretty weird, shouldn't we be able to copy whatever we want to?
KL: No, there is a federal regulation that says we aren't allowed to copy
    copyrighted material.
JV: So can *I* copy it?
KL: You can't copy more than one chapter of the book if we go that route.
JV: Um, if I'm copying and paying for it, don't I have the right to pick and
    choose what I want and do not want in my copies?
KL: I would normally say yes, but our regulations mandate only one chapter out
    of copyrighted material for students.
JV: OK. I just need chapter 7 for reference. Can we do that? 
(NOTE: i was planning to copy both 6 and 7, fuqn bitch)
KL: I would suppose so, copiers are on the right.
JV: OK.

So I get my copying done, but all the while I am really frustrated that some
BS rule won't let me copy what I want and only lets me get a meager 1 chapter.
What kind of deal is that? I mean to copy something that is not going to be
resold? I am a mere student, with educational needs, why should I have to
suffer if Kinkos accidently helped in the selling of 'bootleg' books.

This whole little event before 8 AM has led me to believe, that kinkos
conspires against the everyday hardworking college student, hoping to keep us
down, ensuring that as uneducated idiots, we will conform to a Kinkos way of
life.

Adolf 'Kinkos' Hitler ?
Josef 'Kinkos' Stalin ?
Benito 'Kinkos' Mussolini ?
Fidel 'Kinkos' Castro ?

Either way, there is a strand of totalitarianism that runs through the life
blood of kinkos. Maybe the phrase "Fight the system" should be "Fight the
Kinkos."

Just more abnormal thoughts to leave you utterly stunned.
