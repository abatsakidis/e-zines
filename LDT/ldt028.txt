#028 - [ Theft, Violation, and Dealing With It ]
       [ jvaldez ]

	
I walked out to my car and noticed there were wires sticking out of the trunk.
Odd, I thought to myself, those aren't supposed to come out of the trunk.
Then it hit me. Peices of my stereo system were gone, my radar detecter gone
and whatever else I had of value in the car was gone. However, I was smart
enough and you might say, uncivilized enough, to have a completely trashed
car. I maintained my CD's because the thieves were smart and stayed away from
them b/c there was about 4 pounds of garbage on top of the case. However,
still feeling violated and enraged, I turned to some of my tried-and-true
methods of dealing with it.

Let's face it, everyone at least once in their little lives has stolen
something and has had something stolen from them. Getting something stolen
from you sucks, not merely out of financial loss (though that does suck too!)
but primarily out of the feeling of violation and helplessness. There is a big
difference however, in getting something stolen from you after they pry it out
of your cold dead hands, and getting something stolen from you while you're
asleep in the safety of your home and the comfort of your own neighborhood.
After getting something stolen while you are sleeping, a feeling of violation
ovrwhelms you. This soon is replaced by rage, and then finally by anxiety
(for fear you might have something stolen again.) I have come up with a few
methods to help you deal with these problems and/or emotions without hurting
and/or destroying the lives of your loved ones.  They work for me and if you
are male with a lot of anger deep down within, they ought to work for you too.
Best of all, they are all legal.

1. A visit to the grocery store:

	While at a grocery store, pick up a few watermelons (big ones, the
        biggest you can find.) This may cost you a little bit, but its well
        worth it. Take these melons out into the backyard and soften them up
        with a bat and a smile on your face. Try not to bust them open so go
        easy. Then just drop the bat and go ape on those bastards. Yes you
        will get messy, but yes it will relieve the rage part of the 'getting
        something stolen from you' syndrome. Try and not let your neighbors
        see this and try not to throw pieces out of your yard. After all, the
        last thing you need is cops carrying you away on a domestic fruit
        charge.

2. A visit to a salvage yard:

	Most salvage yards don't "legally" allow you to do this, but I say
        screw it, the cars are junk anyways aren't they? Bring tools, but not
        a bat, unless you can fit it into a tool box of course. Go nuts with
        your bigger wrenches and hammers on car doors windows etc. Just try
        not to get caught by the people who own the salvage yard. Yes, I know
        I said they would be all legal, but hey these are *my* methods of
        feeling better.

3. A visit to the gun range:

	Nothing feels better then shooting sporting clays with a twelve gauge
        shotgun.  Except shooting sporting clays with a twelve gauge shotgun
        and imagining the thieves as the sporting clays. If not involved with
        a gun range/club, see if you have any relatives with a small bit of
        land. If you don't own a gun, you're probably not American, and if
        you're not, don't apply this one.

4. Recycling:

	Collect cans ? If so, take all your empty non crushed pop cans and
        your trusty baseball bat or whatever tools you want (air hammers are
        pretty awesome) and go nuts on the pop cans. This benefits in the fact
        that, even though you're exerting rage, you're going to get a little
        money back and the fact that you can fit more cans into a bag.

If all these do not quell your anger, well then you have a temper problem. I
will be the first to admit, when I get pissed things get broken. However, I
make sure these things that get broken are either fruit, junk, or things of
no value. Don't go ruining other peoples lives just because yours got messed
up a bit. Try to become a better person out of it instead of 'looking for
vengeance.' Yes, it does suck, yes, it does happen and yes, you have to deal
with it.
