#094 - [ Be Careful What You Wish For ]
       [ xod ]


Anne was beautiful, but she just didn't see it.

In her eyes everyone she knew was prettier than her, more popular than her,
more intelligence than her and better than her at everything.

One day Anne was walking to school the same five minute route she took
everyday, when she came across a lamp on the roadside.  What she didn't 
know at this time was that the lamp was a magic lamp.  A magic lamp that 
would grant a person 1 wish if they rubbed it.

Anne looked at the lamp and decided to pick it up.  She noticed it was a
little dirty, presumably from the mixture of mud and rain from the night
before.  Anne proceeded to rub the lamp to clean it up.


    *** ppppp ooooo ooooo fffff ***
  ****  pp pp oo oo oo oo ff     ****
*****   ppppp oo oo oo oo fffff   *****
  ****  pp    oo oo oo oo ff     ****
    *** pp    ooooo ooooo ff    ***
    
Out of the lamp popped a genie.

 o
-|-      <- ( believe it or not but this is a real genie ) 
/ \

The Genie spoke out.

"Hi.  My name is Larry and i'm a genie"
"You have rubbed the magic lamp! I grant you 1 wish"


"1 WISH?! Shouldn't it be 3 wishes?!@" shouted Anne.

"No Anne" replied Larry the Genie.

"One Wish.  So Choose it wisely".

"Oh.."

"..And.."

"..Be Careful what you wish for..."


Anne had heard that when a genie grants a wish there is always a huge flaw
in the wish so she knew that she had to be very detailed within her solitary
wish.  But, She knew what she wanted.

"I want to be the most beautiful girl in the world.
 I want blah-blah-blah measurements.
 Then I will be the prettiest, most popular girl in school!"

 "Your wish is my command" said Larry the Genie.

 And..

          *** ppppp ooooo ooooo fffff ***
        ****  pp pp oo oo oo oo ff     ****
      *****   ppppp oo oo oo oo fffff   *****
        ****  pp    oo oo oo oo ff     ****
          *** pp    ooooo ooooo ff    ***

Larry the Genie was gone and Anne suddenly found herself at home, in bed.

She ran to her mirror and was greeted by the reflection of the most beautiful
girl in the world.

"OH MY GOD" she shouted out.

At this point her face dropped.  She seemed to feel panic and shouted again..

"OH MY GOD"

She was in shock, she couldn't believe it.  She was the most beautiful girl
in the world, but there was a certain problem.

"I SOUND LIKE BARRY WHITE!" she said in a bass fuelled rumble.

Anne didn't take heed of Larry the Genie's warning.  She had found the flaw in
her wish.  Although she was now the most beautiful girl in the world she also
had one of the deepest and manly voices in the world.

"THIS IS WORSE THAN BEFORE" she screamed (rumbled).

At least before she had a female voice.
Now she will never be popular.  She will never get all the boys (unless she 
doesn't speak).  She has basically lost her everyday life due to 1 minute of 
irrational thinking over a wish to be 'popular'.

Let that be a lesson to you kids.

Play with fire and you'll get burned.

Play with Larry and you'll sound like Barry.

                     THE
                        END
