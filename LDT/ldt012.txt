#012 - [ Your Science Will Kill Us ]
       [ xod ]

Sunday Morning.

I'm sat there eating some breakfast and reading the morning newspaper.
One article came to my attention and the basic stupidity of one person 
quoted within it.  It came from a person who is deemed by society to be 
intelligent: a scientist.  But what the person in question seemed to lack
was one of the most important factors of man's survival: Common Sense.

The basics of the article were regarding tests for planned manned-missions
to mars.  A project entitled 'Mars on Earth'.  A couple of weeks ago NASA 
and British Scientists attempted to simulate a landing on mars, on an island 
called Devon Island, a Canadian island 400 miles from the North Pole.  It 
seems to look a lot like mars and apparently has hostile conditions, the 
most similar to mars to be found on earth.

The details are not important, purely the quote from our scientist.

"What we really need is a new Cold War, perhaps with China.  
 - We need a space race".

PURE IDIOCRACY.
WHAT A FUCKING IDIOT!

To me the above quote makes me think how irresponsible the scientist in 
question is.  Its a purely selfish thing to say in regards to science's 
advancement at societys expense.

'Hey, who cares if a continent got blown up in the process, we've got 
better spaceships now!'

I'm all for scientific advancement but I don't see the point of advancement 
if half of us aren't going to be here to see it or make use of it.

Following the quote from our scientist above came another quote from 
George W. Bush.  He was recently quoted as suggesting that space 'has 
been overlooked'.

Something much closer to home for George W. Bush has been grossly 
overlooked: A Brain. 

( http://www.ldt.org.uk/bush.jpg is conclusive proof)

So, my point I guess is that, scientists may be intelligent, but some of 
them seem to have no common sense.  Their aim is a much more selfish one
than for advancement of society.  It seems to be more a case of how far 
they can advance with their projects.  

Personal glory.  Personal glory.  Personal glory.

The people will pay the bill..
