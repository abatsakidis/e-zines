#023 - [ I live with fucking Dick heads! ]
       [ BlackShark ]


Ok this might be a bit premature but i think that first impressions do infact
count.  I have spent the last 3 or 4 days in total bliss, in a house by
myself with no one annoying me and me annoying no one, i keep myself to
myself and stay quiet and i expect others to do the same for me; as they say,

"Do unto others as you want to be done unto you"

(unless you are a masochist of course). 

So i wake up this morning, its nice and sunny, and i jump onto, yes of course 
you guessed it, my computer, i dont even open my curtains, and i start to code 
my uni project, i know its going to be hard so i want to get as much done as 
I can (uni hasn't even started so im making a preemtive start onto what i hope 
will be my project).  After a while it gets overcast and starts to rain (hey 
i'm in england what else do i expect?)

Oooohh, knock on the door, hang on brb, its some dudes from next door....3
guys come in, main guy sounds like he is from brummy.....thick brummy accent.

Hahahah all three of them are called Dave. In the first year from the looks
of things, i tell them i am in the 4th and they are surprised. They seem
alright, they live next door and wonder if anyone wants to goto the pub, im
not what you would call the total social type, im more secluded and hermit
like, recluse if you will, i prefer to be known as a stereotypical geek,
computer nerd, im sure you know the sorts of things that get said to us all,
i prefer the sorts of people who like what i like and who seem quiet, im on
my computer 24/7 and if im not thats cos im going down to the shop to order 
a computer part (cos the net is down) or collect a computer part cos i 
didn't answer the door when Royal Mail arrived with it earlier in the day 
when i was asleep (about 11am).

But anyway, i let them go upstairs to talk to the others, they all seem to
be getting along quite well, they are going downstairs, mmmm talking,
probabaly going to the pub now!! (fingers crossed)

Anyway that was a side track, after treking down to the uni in the rain i
come home (you know why i was at the uni...yes yes....to go on the computers
and use the net and email my latest text file to Xod, he was impressed with
the amount i did yesterday and i have another one ready for him today!!) and
i walk down the road after going to the chippy (i cant be fucked to cook,
tooooooo tired!!) and i see the lights are on....ALL THE LIGHTS are on,
except mine, i assume i have just left them on by mistake, i open the door..
THUMPING MUSIC!!

you know the sort i mean, some "cool" guy (you know the sort, nice car, ugly
guy hot looking girl next to him, who only likes the street cred and his
cash, remove the car and she wouldn't look twice at him, i also think that
there is a correlation between the coolness of a car and the hotness of a
gold digger/girl, better the car better the girl! The guy on the other hand
is a non determinate factor) in his car comes bopping along with his windows
down....music == monotone Bass drum going

"boom boom boom boom boom" (hay i like this stuff but i cant get it for love
nor money, where they get it from is beyond me!!!) and i think...."FUCK!!!"
i send my GF a text msg telling her how my life has gone from pure bliss to
fucking hell.

No reply.....its been about 25 minutes now, has it got lost or have the new
guys (who incidently have NOTHING here except 1 CD and a ghetto blaster)
surrounded this place in an anti mobile phone msg shield??? Who knows.......

The music has got louder now, but it has also got shitter, sounds like some
erm...i dunno latin stuff but crap latin stuff, or could it just be a demo
song from a keyboard, either way it sucks, id put some drum and bass on but
i dont want to have to beat them in a sound out.

The music is still going on, i expect it to finish sometime in the VERY early
hours, there goes my quiet night in and a good cup of coffee. In fact what
the hell ill make one now....brb people....Well i took a walk down to the
kitchen and it transpires that the music is in fact the good ole Drum and
Bass anyway (tinny noises dont travel through floor boards) so that has
gained them some credit at least! :)
They have some good tunes as well!

The good thing is that all my stuff i left on the side in the kitchen (i
never expected anyone here till sunday) was never touched...thats a start
at least, i know they looked into my room, my towel was on the floor, they
have also put the heating on, i just felt the radiator, im not sure if they
are pot smoking or what, who knows, who cares, i know i dont, as long as i
can work without them bothering me too much i dont mind. Writing this text
file and complaining to no one but my computer screen has helped me feel soo
much better about myself and this situation, so much so i just cant start to
put it into words! Thanks for listening and displaying all the ASCII
characters i have pressed MR Computer.

p.s. PLEASE COME AND SAVE ME!! THE MUSIC HAS TURNED INTO A SLOW ELEPHANT
LIKE HEART BEAT....TAKE ME AWAY FROM THIS....
does anyone have a Visual basic programming job going??????
