#026 - [ Your Construction Smells of Corruption, I Manipulate to Recreate.. ]
       [ jvaldez ]


One of those things in life that register a question mark in my head:

	Canadian Supremists, Yesterday and Today:

Why do canadians feel superior over Americans? Basically a canadian is an
American with better healthcare, more french accent and background, slightly
better educational system and no guns. I'll be honest, I joke around a lot
with the whole "canada sucks" routine and would even go so far as saying
"bomb canada!" but let's be honest with ourselves here! What has Canada to
offer to the world? A dual language sign system throughout one of its
provinces ? Awesome. Below and in the rest of this 'shpeel' I have listed 2
things CANADA VS USA they are pretty big ones, but there are more, I have
just yet to think of them. Please no death threats, this time.

          Cool Cities

Canada Has:            USA:
		      
Vancouver	       Los Angelos 
Toronto                San Francisco
Ottawa?		       Seattle
          	       Chicago
		       New York
		       Miami
	               San Diego
                       Las Vegas
                       Houston
		       New Orleans
                       Boston
                      	

Hm, thats kind of weird, I can't see the point that they have more big
landmarks then we do.. However, the normal canadian would approach with the
line "But our crime rates are lower!" Well, so are your populations, our
cities are not exactly modeled after Rio De Janairo (sp?) (aka city with
highest murder rate in the world.) The pollution argument can be linked with
this fact too. Our cities are not little Mexico City's either (aka city with
the most pollution AND population)

So we get two basic facts straight:

Crime and Population are very important factors.
Pollution and Population are very important factors.

Working on this, city-wise, the US has canada beat. You also cannot use any
form of 'land mass' argument because in a literal sense, canada has close to
what America has. So what if Canada is half covered with permafrost, not our
fault, you guys chose it.

	  Places to See:

Canada Has:                            USA:
The other side of Niagra falls ?       Disney World
                                       Used to have WTC's
                                       Empire State Building
                                       Sears Towers
                                       Mount Rushmore
                                       Devils Tower
                                       Mount McKinley 
                                       Mardi Gras / Bourbon Street
                                       Yellow Stone National Park
                                       Space Needle in Seattle
                                       Golden Gate (Gay?) Bridge San Francisco
                                       Vietnam Memorial Wall
                                       Capitol Hill
                                       (too much to list really)

Basically another win. You have to remember, these places are things people
all over the world would know of. How many people have ever heard of world
famous monuments / things to see in canada ? 4 maybe 5 at the most? Odd, I'm
still trying to find out why we Americans suck and you Canadians are awesome.

Overall, I really could care less what people think, but I like to think of
things that are weird and to top it off, really have no justification or back
up (i.e. canadian supremecy and canadian supremists) Just seems a bit off
putting when a country right above the US considers itself a 'better' people
because they have less to do, less interesting sites, and weirder accents.
