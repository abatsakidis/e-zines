#034 - [ Paranoia: The Vicious Circle ]
       [ xod ]


You look over your shoulder, do you have something to fear?
You hesitate and you stutter, do you have something to hide?

You never know who's listening.
You never know who's around.

You can never be too careful.
You don't want to make a sound.

They probably know about everything.
They'll have heard you on the phone.
They'll have seen your picture a hundred times.

They know who you are.
They know where you are.
They even know why.

But then again, maybe not.

But you can never be too sure..
