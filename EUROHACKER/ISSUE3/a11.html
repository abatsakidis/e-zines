<h1> New Possibilities With Peercasting </h1>

<p align="center"> <em>Written by <a href="http://penguin.agrid.usm.edu/%7Edeisenhardt">Derick

<p> Have you ever thought of running your own Internet radio or TV
station? Numerous broadcast tools have come out over the last decade,
but the bandwidth requiredto run one is still extremely high. The
cheapest solution for most was to just let someone like Live365 take
care of the bandwidth, but many still felt restricted by this. A couple
years back Live365 started charging broadcasters higher fees to run
their station without commercials being added to their playlist and
users would have to start paying as well. Shoutcast and Icecast stations
are still a popular alternative, but once again it costs a lot to host
all that bandwidth yourself. </p>

<p> The same problem had troubled websites for years as well 'till Bit
Torrent came around. If you don't already know, BitTorrent allows sites
to get away with smaller bandwidth by having the people that are
downloading from them also upload to each other which cuts down
bandwidth needs dramatically. Unfortunately BitTorrent was only
designed for static files so this doesn't help out Internet broadcasters
much. </p>

<p> There have been two different solutions to this problem. One idea
which has become fairly popular is <a href="../../../wiki/Podcasting.html">"podcasting"</a>, which
isn't really broadcasting at all, and <a href="../../../wiki/Peercasting.html">"peercasting"</a>.
Podcasting is a fairly simple process aimed at iPod users and the like.
Instead of listening to live, streaming audio, a listener will download
an entire playlist of music and then just listen to that. I'm not aware
of anyone doing the same with a TV station-like theme, but I'm sure it's
quite possible. This however took away the magic of a live broadcast.
With live radio you can talk on air, have listeners call in, take
requests etc. Still, a lot of people seem to be fine with this loss;
probably since most traditional radio stations are filled with boring
talk radio and such these days. </p> 

<p> If you're still interested in live radio or TV, there are now some
quite viable solutions. Although none of these have really taken off, <a href="http://www.peercast.org/">Peercast</a> seems to be about the most
popular and mature. The peercast design is pretty simple and easy to
setup. For listeners, all you do is download the client (available for
Linux, Mac & Windows) and it acts as a middle man between the
broadcaster and your media player of choice. For broadcasters all you do
is broadcast with a traditional encoder like Icecast or Oggcap, the
peercast software receives this stream and then redistributes it for
you. Now this may sound very similar to the way BitTorrent works, but
it's not. BitTorrent uses a technique called "swarming" which allows
you to download and upload numerous little bits wherever it is most
efficient. Peercast simply works off a piggy back algorithm where you
relay an entire stream to the next person. This seems to work fine for
low bitrate streams like audio, but doesn't work too well for decent
quality video. There have been many discussion on solutions on their
forums, such as "minute swarming", which would use a swarming technique
for each minute of the stream, but nothing has really happened yet. As
of right now this is a pretty large hurdle in the way of peercasting
really taking off. The Xiph foundation have been planning a similar
technology called <a href="http://wiki.xiph.org/index.php/IceShare">IceShare</a> for a while,
but there has yet to be any code produced. The project page for IceShare
claims it will use portions of BitTorrent's code, but how so has not
really been discussed much. </p>

<p> Ok, so you've got your internet radio station going now, but what
are you gonna play? If you want to play mainstream music, you'll
probably have the RIAA or ASCAP asking for money for the "right" to play
their music. How much they would be entitled to is still iffy since
current rules and laws weren't designed with peercasting in mind. Most
countries will have rules stating for every 25 listeners you must pay so
much money, but with peercast you may be technically only broadcasting
to one or two listeners and then it spreads from there. Do they just
count how many total listeners there are and charge the original
broadcaster based on that, or does each person relaying the station get
charged? This is a matter yet to be figured out, and will probably be a
topic of discussion for quite some time. Well, you could always play
independent artists. Most Internet based musicians are smart enough to
realize that you playing their music will only help promote them more
for free and will gladly allow you to play their stuff. There are even
some musicians releasing their songs under Creative Commons or GPL
licenses. Well, what if you wanted to run a TV station? The restrictions
on rebroadcasting of TV shows and movies are even more harsh, yet less
defined since it doesn't happen quite as often. Once again there are
some good indy shows you could find on the net and broadcast, but
there's much less to choose from. However, if independent film makers
realized the opportunities peercasting can afford them, maybe more would
try it. Another benefit peercasting vs. BitTorrent distribution may
eventually provide is content on demand type services. If peercasting
really took off, mainstream/traditional radio and TV stations might be
in big trouble. </p>

<p> So if you've been itching to create your own Internet radio or TV
station, but didn't want to pay outrageous fees for bandwidth,
peercasting may be your solution. </p>
