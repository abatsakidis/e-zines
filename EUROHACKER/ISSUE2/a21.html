<h1> Review of "Innocents Betrayed" </h1>

<p align="center"> <b>Written by:</b> the editor (yes, I actually did
work) </p>

<p align="center"> <img src="ib.jpg"> </p>

<p> Today I got a most pleasant surprise in the mail: a free copy of the
documentary "Innocents Betrayed",  which links gun control to genocide,
sent to me by the awesome people at JPFO (Jews for the Preservation of
Firearms Ownership). I even got a hand-written note from their leader,
Aaron Zellman. You guys rock!!! </p>

<p> Anyway, it was kinda inconvenient that I should get it today since
today is release day. But, to show my gratitude, I worked overtime (yes,
you are reading it right)... :) </p>

<p> The DVD looks really slick and professional, almost like a Hollywood
movie :) It fails to mention the words "gun control" on the back,
though, which is kind of weird... </p>

<p> The video production does a convincing job, what with all the fades
and zooms and sounds. It manages to not become boring, even though it
relies mainly on photos and voice-overs. Gory images uproot the viewer's
sentiments, to great effect. I felt kind of queasy watching some of it,
so you may be advised not to treat Grandma to this kind of
entertainment. </p>

<p> The meat part of the documentary details various genocides committed
in the 20th century and their link to gun control. Germany is of course
the main example to consider but the documentary showed me some I hadn't
really heard of about before. At times the link between gun control and
genocide is exaggerated and oversimplified, but mostly it gives us a
good feeling of the message that is being conveyed. I'd say we are shown
more strong links than tenuous ones. I would have liked to see more
examples of successful self-defence against government, though. For
instance, the Warzaw ghetto uprising. </p>

<p> After all the world-wide genocides the documentary takes a look at
genocide in the US. It looks at the persecution of blacks and native
Americans in the 19th and 20th centuries. Good points are brought up
about minorities who are made defenceless. It also goes in to some
specific cases where gun control has led to the death of individuals. I
found this a bit out of place, since it wasn't related to genocide per
se. </p>

<p> My main gripe with the documentary is that it is based on an
assumption which is not explained nor discussed adequately. It is
implicit. Now, for some of us, the reasoning used in the documentary is
obvious, but it is not to the common man (at least not in Europe).
Therefore I would have liked to see a philosophical argumentation of
sorts. Explain the ethics of self-defence and such. The documentary
seems a lot like a history book to me: great if you want some specific
info but not so informative if you need to know the whys as opposed to
the hows and whats. In short: it's not enough to just shock a man with
grisly images, you have to really convince him as to why he should believe
the basic assumption that this documentary is based upon. Otherwise,
he'll just go "ah, but that won't happen here" or "guns make no
difference". Again, this kind of thing is obvious to some of us but
others just need to have their gun control brainwashing undone, you know
:) Also, I would have liked to see some rebuttals of common arguments
against guns as a counterweight to tyranny ("we can't fight the
government with our guns, they have nukes and tanks helicopters and
bombs and crap"). Maybe mention Waco. </p>

<p> Another problem is the lack of mention of the genocides committed by
the United States government in World War 2 and the Viet Nam war (as
well as in other wars and operations). Dresden? Hiroshima? My Lai?
Operation Rolling Thunder? </p>

<p> After the documentary, we get to see some interviews, where I think
the needed philosophical arguments are brought forward in a better way.
Had the documentary included some of the arguments for gun ownership
found in the interviews, that would have been great. Brownie points for
that fact that Aaron Zellman drops the Robert A. Heinlein quote "An
armed society is a polite society" :) </p>

<p> I was impressed with this documentary. Most pro-gun advocates talk
about the right to defend yourself against common criminals. The fight
against tyranny is kind of forgotten, especially by mainstream gun
organizations such as the NRA. Still, for people who are new to the
whole pro-gun movement, I recommend that you pick up something that
deals with the former category of self-defence. The latter is a bit
esoteric, after all, and I think you need to be a bit hardcore to
properly digest it. Perfect for EuroHacker readers, in other words! </p>

<p> I give it a rating of 8/10. If you are pro-guns, you need this in
your collection. </p>

<p> Oh, one more thing. If you order a copy, tell 'em I sent you ;) </p>
