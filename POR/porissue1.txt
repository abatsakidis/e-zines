******************************************************
***Logical Web Hacking: Some methods of exploration***
******************************************************
************** -= By: Scientist =- *******************


When someone sees "WebHack", they immediately jump to SunOS and ISS exploits,
how they can hax0r teh gibson, and generally silly and complex things. They
forget the true nature of hacking: exploring. By looking around and poking here
and there, we find some neat stuff. Handscanning and Wardialing show this nature.
You keep constantly pushing a button until something neat comes out of it.

Web Hacking is similar to this. You constantly push something as far as it can
go, and then you see what happens. However, by thinking about general web design
and knowing something about HTTP in general, you can make your life alot easier.

I classify all information that can be found out in two ways: visible, and feelable. 
Visible information is just looking around without prodding. Examples are reading 
a number off of a payphone, listening to radio activity, and, to a certain extent, 
taping phonelines. In the case of WebHacking, these are viewing the source of pages
you're meant to be on, google-hacking, and other stuff that won't be seen. Feelable is
information you can see, but you give away the fact that you're looking. Going to our
previous example, feelable information would be wardialing from that payphone, RF
data reinterpretation (sending out radio signals to see what response you get), and
using that line you just tapped. 

The reason these are important are because of the risks you take. Visible 
information is riskless; true visible info is not able to be reasonably tracked. 
Visible information specifically does not tick off website alarms that tell the 
site owner to put all the neat stuff away. However, that does not make feelable info
completely taboo, just realize that it's most likely a one time information splurge, 
it won't stay long.

Well, I bored you enough didnt I? Lets get to techniques....


-=Techniques=-


*Google-Hacking:

Google revolutionized webhacking by suddenly adding a searchable keyword database for
thousands upon thousands of websites. To be more specific, they added the ability to
not only find your search queries in the website text but also in the website URL,
title, etc. One of the things this helps alot with is once you find a neat WebHack 
that works one place (say you figure out that all the passwords for a site are hidden 
in a directory called /cgi-bin/CreCarServ/), you can search a general website signature
and find hundreds of other sites that have the same vunerability. The best example I can
give of this is the old PayPal (and probably other credit card brokers) link hack. PayPal
was simply a middle man in the whole deal, and clicking a paypal link hooked you into a CGI
script that, by parameters in the link, knew how much to charge you, who to send the money
to, and what website to forward you to afterward. Thats right, they would just send you to
another link, usually on the same site, that would have a form that you could enter in the
information you needed to get the service that was "charged" for. Originally the link was
plaintext, and you could just copy and paste it, but eventually PayPal caught on. However,
searching google for "Thank You" and "Registering" you could find these sites anyhow. Google
hacking brings us to another, more directed hack. Google hacking is completely invisible.


*Robots.txt Hacking:

Well, to solve the google hack, some mediocre web designer decided that if he banned google
from searching his directories, they wouldnt be searched. So, he looked at google and found
out about robots.txt, something that google looks for before it searches through your site
and find out what to update daily, what not to update at all, and what directories to keep 
clear of. Well, by making robots.txt ban google from looking at the secret directories, he
actually tells us exactly what to look for. When we find a site we think might be defended 
in this way, just look at robots.txt. Thats usually a good hint as to where all the fun stuff 
is. Robots.txt hacking is VERY visible.

*Mental/Logical Webhacking:

If you read a safecracking book, they tell you about psychological safecracking: the idea
that humans think alike, and thus by getting into the mind of the safeowner you can figure
out the safe code. This is a bigger security risk then we think. Considering these sites
are also made by people, and not terribly smart people at that (mostly people that use front-
page, I am not talking about all you true webmasters out there) we can get into their minds.
Sadly, the best example I can think of is porn sites. Most sites have sample sites that allow
you to see some pictures of what's in their site. Alot of times, these are actually
hosted on what are known as TNG bases (thumb nail galleries) that host galleries for a bunch 
of sites. Because of their size, the galleries are made with automatic programs that usually
name them sequentially. Thus, by looking at the directories they are in, and other such things
one can find how large these truly are and find other directories and pictorials.

This text is meant to be a taste of something to get you initiated to exploring. Look at my
ideas! They are by no means concrete!

******************************************************
***************Accessing T-Mobile VMBs****************
******************************************************
**************** -= By: I-baLL =- ********************




Background info:

I've been with T-Mobile for a few months now but only recently did I notice that
when I dialed my T-Mobile vmb (by holding down the 1 key) my cell phone dialed
some weird number. So I went to my "Dialed calls" log and copied down the
number. The NPA (805) proved to be a Californian NPA located in Santa Barbara
to be exact. The exact NPA and exchange is 805-637 and is one of the exchanges
in the 805 NPA which is owned by T-Mobile. Now T-Mobile itself is located in
Bellevue, Washington (the state not the district.) so I'm not sure why it
would own blocks of exchanges in a Californian NPA. Anyways, I dialed
805-637-9999 and got the message which I'll paraphrase as: "Please enter the
10-digit number of the T-Mobile customer you're trying to reach now..." Then
I dialed the number which my cell phone dials to access my own vmb...
*drumroll* 805-637-7243 (805-MESSAGE). I reached my VMB. So then I hung up, dialed
805-637-9999 and entered "805-637-7243" as "the 10-digit number of the
T-Mobile customer you're trying to reach..." I was expecting to hear my
voicemail greeting. Instead I heard somebody else's voicemail greeting and
realized that 805-637-7243 was not a backdoor number to my vmb. "Hmmm.." I
wondered to myself, "Could it be that T-Mobile assigned 805-637-7243 to one of
their Californian customers?" If that was true then it would mean that I
wouldn't be able to reach that person from my own cellphone seeing how, when I
dialed that number I instead got into my vmb. So I called up a friend and
asked him to dial 805-637-7243. He did and told me that he heard "Please enter
the 10-digit number of the T-Mobile customer you're trying to reach now..."
That was the exact same message as 805-637-7243. That would mean that I could
only access my voicemail box by dialing 805-637-7243 only if I was dialing
that number from my cell phone. While all this was happening I went to
http://www.bellsmind.net in order to get information on the 805-637 exchange.
And what did I see there but, and I quote:

"805-637-7243 VMB T-Mobile's Nationwide VMS access number" (with credit
given to "Greyarea" for finding this number.)

So I called somebody else who had a T-Mobile phone and asked them what number
their cell dialed to access their voicemail. Turned out it was the exact same
number (805-637-7243.) Alarms were going off in my head. I couldn't believe
the possibility that had arisen amidst these pieces of information. I had a
concept that had formulated in my mind and all I had to do was prove it to
myself.

A few hours later I sat down on the bed with a friend's cell phone and spoofed
my own cell phone's caller id number. I'm not going to describe how that was
done because I still need to have some secrets, don't I? Then I dialed
805-637-7243 (I keep repeating the number so you would remember it. A mind,
unlike a notebook, can't be lost. Well, that's not exactly true but that's not
the point.) and waited with crossed fingers, baited breath, and a collection
of good luck charms that would make the curator of the Smithsonian proud.

"...You have 3 new voice messages" said the pre-recorded voice on the other
end of the line and I jumped up from my bed in excitement. Well, I didn't
jump. It was more of a rolling stand. Anyway, I was excited. Proof of concept
has been achieved.

So let's run this down into a simple explanation of method:

Step 1: Obtain cell phone number of T-Mobile customer whose mailbox you want
to access. I used my own.

Step 2: Spoof your Caller ID to that of the T-Mobile customer's cell phone
number.

Step 3: Using that spoofed CID dial "805-637-7243".

Step 4: There is no step 4.

******************************************************
****Free Web Access on the TCC Teleplex Web Kiosks****
******************************************************
**************** -= By: I-baLL =- ********************


TCC Teleplex introduced their internet web kiosk payphones sometime in the fall
of 2003. The web kiosks themselves are Marconi Interactive Net Neptune 800 Web
phones. Marconi Interactive is a UK based telecommunications company that makes 
all sorts of weird looking payphones. Especially the Neptune 800 model whose 
"full QWERTY keyboard" doesn't even include quotaiton marks. Anyways, this
article isn't about Marconi Interactive though the exploit mentioned here can 
probably be used anywhere else where you can access Google from the web kiosk
for free.

Anyways, here's the deal:

You want to get free internet access on the kiosk, right? Well, here's the deal:
The kiosk allows you to access Google for free. In fact, anything within the
Google domain is accessible. That includes Usenet (Google Groups) and GMail. The
trick, though, involves Google Images. The thing with Google Images is this:
When you google for an image, let's pick Goatse, Google givesdyou back a result.
Now when you click on the result Google goes to a frame page. The url in your
address bar still says images.google.com/blahblahblah and the top part of the page
is a frame which features a thumbnail of the image, a link to the image and some
text which I've never bothered to read. The trick, as you might've noticed, is that
the url still says that you're inside the Google domain. That's right! The web kiosk
allows you to see the site for free as long as you keep that annoying Google frame
on top of the screen. But just googling for images is a crapshoot way of going to
websites. Instead all you have to do is memorized the url that google uses to display
the 2 frames. The main frame (which is a Google frame thus you get to keep the Google
domain in the url) and the site frame which has the site on it.

The url is:

http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://xxx.com&imgrefurl=http://www.yoursite.com/

The imgurl part is the url of the image you're Googling for. Since you're not googling
then just make sure that that part in the url follows the normal url format. You know,
http://www.xxx.com. The important part of the url is the imgrefurl part. It's basically
the url of the website which has the picture on it. But since we're not looking for a
pic we just put in the url of the website that we want to go to in there. So let's say
that you want to go to Slashdot. That means you'll type:

http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.f.com&imgrefurl=http://www.slashdot.com

Ta-da!

Oh, and now click on the lower border of the google frame and move it up. That's right!
you can resize the Google frame so it's virtually not there!

Downsides:

If a link opens up a new window then you must look at the new window in the size with which
it was open. If you maximize it then the kiosk will ask you to pay. Also, you won't be able
to click on the links in the newly opened window. So as long as the links that you click on
don't open up any new windows you're a-okay.

No cookies! No cookies are saved! That means you can't login into any websites! Which sucks.

Other methods:

You can always go into Google prefernces are check off the "Open links in new windows"
option. But the problem with that is that the sites you go to, by searching for them and 
clicking on the links, will appear in a small window and you won't have the ability to click
on the links on the site.

Problems:

The big problem with the kiosk is that they have web filtering software. 2600.com is banned.
http://www.phonelosers.org is banned. http://www.binrev.com is banned. The stupid thing is
that TCC Teleplex never reveals that they ban certain sites. And that's bad.


Here's a map of all their web kiosks in NYC:

*****How to Call 10-10-288-0 from Verizon Hybrids*****
******************************************************
**************** -= By: I-baLL =- ********************


So you need to dial that hot new WATS teleconf from your local truckstop but don't want to
pass your ANI to whoever runs it. But you realize that you're standing in front of a Verizon
Hybrid! Oh, no! Feeling screwed, aren't you? Not to worry! Pull out that dialing finger and
start pushing buttons. More specifically push #,C,O,I,N. That's right! #2646. You'll hear the
hybrid dialing in the distance background until suddenly you hear:

"Thank you for calling the Gemini Calling Center!" (I've no clue whatt his is. Anybody have 
any ideas?) Then there's a beep and you can record a message. do us all a favour and don't do
that. Instead push #. Now you hear the hybrid hang up. Stay on the phone until you hear a
dialtone come up. That's a real dialtone! Now you can dial 10-10-288-0! OMG HAX!

Other methods that might work on other phones: *67 or 1167. It might drop you to a dialtone or
it might not do anything. also try 0+10-10-288-0 as well as 00+10-10-288-0. Good luck!
