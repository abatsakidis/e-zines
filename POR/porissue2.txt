***************INTRO********************

Fuck. It's 3:24am on the night between Friday, February 18th, abd
Saturday, February 19th. The ephedra from the stockpile (it's only
illegal to sell, not to possess) is quickly wearing off and my eyes
grow weary and tired. Oh, what the hell. Fuck it.

Anyways, welcome to Patterns of Recognition issue #2. Issue #1 seems
to have been a success. Or at least I'm led to believe this from all
the good reviews we've recieved from wherever I've spammed our url
and, trust me, I've spammed this url in as many places as possible.
Hell, if you spend the night with some celebrity, like Paris Hilton,
you might actually see our url tatooed inside their sexual organs...
Or so we're told by a not-too-trusted source. Yes, that's a bad joke.
An editor, a temporary one at least, who feels sick, is allowed to
joke in whatever manner possible, be it offensive or quite funny.
Whatever.

As you can see, our article count has gone up. This was achieved in
a relatively short time due to feedback grom Goatse assholes. Yup,
that's another bad joke. I'm not even sure if that'll qualify as 
filler. Only time will tell.

Hopefully this issue will have less mistakes. Less spelling mistakes,
less grammatical mistakes, and less technical mistakes. We will try
to achieve technical brilliance in order to sound cool and smart and
have you send us money and information.

Anyway, we're releasing a second PoR issue only a week after the
first PoR issue because we like momentum. Momentum might help to keep
this whole thing going forquite a while so we try to use it to our
best advantage.

NOTE ON OUTSIDE SUBMISSIONS:

A few people asked if we take outside submissions. We didn't have a
policy on them before but now we've decided to accept them. We'll 
review them and if we find the article to be good we'll print it.
Please don't submit in articles that have been submitted elsewhere.
We try to have new content in every single issue and if you just 
reprint an old article then it'll just be redundant and a waste.
So send in the articles as well as any feedback on the zine to:
patternsofrecognition /at/ yahoo \dot\ com.


-=I-baLL=-

_____________________________________________________________________
Corrections for last issue:

#coin is answered by a human operator if called Monday - Friday between
the hours of 8am and 4pm, or something like that.

You don't have to wait for the answering machine prompt to finsh. Just,
when the answering machine begins to play its prerecorded message, push #,
and then # again. This will take you a reorder and you just stay on the
line and wait for the reorder to end. This whole process should last 5
or 6 seconds tops.

*********** Sprint Phone Code Hacking ***********
*************************************************
************ -= By: Scientist =- ****************


Alrighty, some people out there beyond me have sprint...and I am 
also sure some people out there have phones that are too new to
have any neat hacks out for. Well, sprint was really nice to us 
and made some codes universal!

First one is ##DATA or ##3282. Most phones require you to enter 
this code, and then press "OK", "Send" or any other similar key.
If your phone doesnt have these buttons, simply end it with another
#

Next one is ##DEBUG...on some phones this mode is ##040793(like mine...)
Again, either press OK after, or #. 

Well...you can do the rest of the work for yourself. Some more codes below

Nam Set: ##Spc+Ok+Key Down+Ok
A-key: ##2539+Ok+Key Down+Ok
Version: ##**837+Ok+Key Down+Ok
Debug Menu: ##FSC+Ok+Key Down+Ok
Airtime menu: ##8463+Ok+Key Down+Ok
Change CAI: ##7738+Ok+Key Down+Ok
Vocoder: ##8626337+Ok+Key Down+Ok
Reverse Logistic: ##786+Ok+Key Down+Ok
Set IP Address: ##2769737+Ok+Key Down+Ok
TTY On/Off: ##889+Ok+Key Down+Ok
Advanced Data: ##3282+Ok+Key Down+Ok+Msl

Browser Init On/Off: ##4682+Ok+Key Down+Ok
Picture Token: ##25327+Ok+Key Down+Ok
Unknown Code: ##5282277+Ok+Key Down+Ok

WARNING: Most of these worked on my Sanyo phone, but be careful...the last one crashed
my phone!

Happy Hunting!

*************************************************
****** CPN/CID Spoofing Through Bell South ******
*************************************************
************** -= By: Enamon =- *****************


Before I begin let me state that you WILL be charged for placing calls using
this method. Also, while it is generally not illegal to spoof CID it *is*
illegal to do so if you intend to use it to commit fraud. If you do anything
illegal with this information then you will be held responsible. It's your ass
not mine. Now that we have that out of the way...

The method is quite simple. The only thing you really need is either a line to
bill the phone call to (i.e. one that allows third party billing and that has
someone there to answer the phone and accept all charges) or a Bell South
calling card. How you obtain any of these two is up to you though it seems to
me that the Bell South calling card is the more versatile method for payment.

The first step involved in spoofing your CPN/CID is causing an ANI Fail when
calling Bell South (800-235-5768). You can do this using one of two ways.
The first method is universal and should work just about anywhere. You dial
10-10-288-0 to reach AT&T's Automated Operator. When it prompts you to punch
in the number you want to dial just press 800 235 5768. It will then connect
you to Bell South without passing on your ANI or CPN.

The other method of inducing an ANI Fail is to call Bell South through your
local operator. Just dial 0 and tell your local operator that you have
"operator privileges". "Operator privileges" is a service provided by your
local telephone company for handicapped people who are either unable or find
it difficult to dial phone numbers. Usually the operator will dial the number
for you. However sometimes they like to be difficult. This is why I prefer
the first method.

Now normally when you call Bell South you get an automated response service
(or whatever they're called) but since you've caused an ANI Fail you'll be
dumped right away to a Bell South operator who will ask you "What number are
you calling from?". This is where you tell the operator the number you want to
spoof. Say you want to be seen as calling from the White House switchboard
(202-456-1414). You thus tell the operator that you're calling from 202-456-
1414. The operator will then ask for the number you want to call and will then
ask you to what will the call be billed. This is where you can choose either
third party billing or a Bell South calling card. Once the operator verifies
your method he or she will connect your call and whatever number you've chosen
to spoof shall appear on the called party's CID box.


Let's go over the steps once again.

1. Cause an ANI Fail when calling Bell South. This can be done through either

a. Using 10-10-288-0
b. Calling through an operator (using Operator Privileges)

2. Stating the number you're "calling from" (i.e. the number you want to
spoof).

3. Stating the number you want to call.

4. State how you want to be billed.

5. Wait for your call to connect.

It's as simple as that.

********************How to**********************
*Reach Verizon Nationwide 411 Directory Service*
*****************From Your Cell*****************
***************/-= By: I-baLL =-\***************


It's quite easy to access Verizon Nationwide 411 Service from
your cell. All you have to do is change your wireless carrier 
to Verizon.

....

Okay, so the joke's not as funny as I thought it'd be. Anyways,
most, if not all, of the cell phone service providers charge
you outrageous fees for 411 service. So how, oh how, do you get
411 service without having to sell oyur first born and/or go
into debt?

I've no clue.

Heh, actually it's quite simple.

Step 1: Dial the Verizon 0 Operator Backdoor number (which will
be revealed in the next PoR release).

Step 2: Push 4 on your keypad to select option 4.

Step 3: You're now connected to Verizon 411 Nationwide Directory.
Ask away!

Step 4: There is no step.

(And just kidding about giving the number out in the next issue.
The backdoor number for Verizon 0 operator is: 1-718-348-9999.)

*How to set up Bell Canada teleconferences*
***********-= By: Murd0c =-****************


Hi everyone, its me. Well, today is a special day, because I am 
going to teach all of you little phreaks how to set up Bell Canada 
teleconfs. Why Bell Canada, Murd0c? Don't we hate Canadians? Well, 
yes, yes we do. But that dosent mean we can't exploit their bullshit 
excuse for a Bell phone company. YAY! Alright, so get your ass to a 
payphone, or someones TNI box via your beige box. Why should you 
prefer payphones, less work. Yes, this will work from any payphone 
as they often don't ring back. 

Okay, now you are outside, exposed to all that mother nature has to 
offer. And behold, a shiny Western Electric payphone that proclaims 
"you need to deposit 50 cents to make a local call or get a cell phone
like the rest of us!" Yes, I know it may be intimidating, but pick up 
the reciever and dial up 1-800-667-3678. Yeah, it might be good to 
divert using 10-10-288-0 if your payphone allows you to.

Now, you might hear some wacky French voice prompts, don't be alarmed. 
This is Canada's other language, English is coming soon. After this, 
you should connected to a very friendly Canadian operator who might say 
'eh' a lot. Don't be scared, its just how they talk. The conversation 
should probably go a bit like this.

Op: Hi, welcome to Bell Canada's Teleconferencing Services, this is Anita. 
Can I have your conference Folder ID?

You: Well hello Anita, I don't have a conference ID this is my first time 
using Bell Canada. 

Op: Well if you just give me a minute, I can get you all set up. Okay, I 
need your name and your company's name.

You: (Alright, at this point you make up a believable company name. Like 
Dave's Tax Consulting and Preperation. Make sure you write down all the 
info you give her on a scrap of paper so you don't get mixed up and come 
off sounding like an idiot.) My name is Steven Westchester, and I'm with
Stratovarius Publishing Group.

Op: Okay, I need a phone number and address that the call will be billed 
to.

You: 212-xxx-xxxx. And we're at 2755 W. 74th St. NY, NY 10002. 

Op: Please hold while I set up the conf. (She might ask you for other 
information, but you're all pretty good social engineers I imagine. Just 
fudge some facts and you should be okay. Bell Canada is a very easy 
company to get conferences from.)

Op: Okay, so what is the date and time you would like your conference to 
start?

You: 25th of Feburary, from 7pm to 7am. 

Op: Great, and how many participants will be dialing in?

You: (You can say as many as 20 people)

Op: Okay, would you like to incur the long distance charges made by your 
participants?

You: Yeah, I would like to have an 800 dial-in.

Op: Terrific. Okay, I have a Steven Westchester scheduled for Feburary 
25th from 7pm to 7am with 20 ports. The number to dial in will be 
1-877-xxx-xxxx. The moderator pin will be xxxxxx and the participant pin
will be xxxxxx.

You: Thank you so much for your time.

Its really very easy to set up. Now you and your wacky friends can have 
all the toll-free, moderated conferencing you want. Now, sometimes Bell 
Canada will do a ring back to you. Some people that I know have set up 
confs with them over 10 times and its only happened once, so just keep 
trying and try from different phones. 

Bell Canada Teleconferencing Services: 1 800 667-3678.

NOTES:

It seems that the number that you give to the operator for billing 
doesn't have to be a valid number.

Also, supposedly if you use the mod pin they backbill to you i.e. they
bill the number from which the person using the mod pin is calling from.

************ -= By: Gonzo =- ********************



That night was humid, almost unbearably so. It was a Saturday night in July 
of the foul year of 2004, during the Fifth H.O.P.E. conference. I had a 
decent amount of alcohol in me, and I was just glad to be away from the man 
bashing Women of 2600 panel that I just witnessed on the Second Track.

I was invited to a party at the Hacker Halfway House, a.k.a. the Triple H
Ranch. This was a big thing for me. I was never able to make it to the 
parties that were held there after 2600 meetings because I have to get back 
to Jersey because if I left my car there overnight, I would either get an 
invite to a Dover Boro fundraiser, also known as a parking ticket, or some 
local punk teen who thinks he's in a gang would steal my car. I couldn't 
pass this up.

My memories of getting there are vague. I remember the JMZ would get you out
there to Brooklyn. I knew this would be some party, and I was expecting some 
kind of craziness. I also had a brief image of feds raiding the place, and 
making the biggest sweep of hackers in history, but nothing of the sort 
happened. Even while I was walking the street to get there I was a bit on 
edge. This was not the best of neighborhoods, but I made it there okay.

Once at the party, the first thing I noticed was the insane amount of alcohol.
Someone later told me that there close to 30 bottles of vodka there. Nice. I 
did feel a bit ill at ease because I didn't know anyone there. However, B9 
Punk, one of the residents there and a friend of mine, made me feel right at 
home. She was even kind enough to let me meet one of her cats, Zero. The place
was packed, and I needed room to breathe, so I headed up to the roof.

Not too much later, my friends joined me. Let's see...Murd0c, Judas Iscariot, 
Scientist, Enamon, I think, and I'm sure there were others there I'm 
forgetting. Even though there were others part goers, there we were, just an 
intimate circle, talking about. I can't even remember what the conversation(s) 
were about. I do remember my reminiscing about my L.O.S. days. Judas was the 
one who spoke up.

"We should form a new group." he said.

It had me interested. I missed having a group, and that chosen family around. 
I remember looking at slow, green burn of the city, and thought about it for a 
bit. L.O.S. was a life changing event for me, the kind of peak that never 
comes again. For a while I had been feeling how the hacker community seemed to 
have stagnated a bit. Maybe the time was right for something new. I took another 
look around, and wondered where my now disbanded L.O.S. brothers/sister-in-arms 
were now. They weren't on this threshold.

"I'm in." I said.
	
The next day, Judas, Enamon, and I would find ourselves near the network area, 
cementing our plans, and it was from there we went off to tell the others.
It wasn't easy to think of a name at first. I came up with the idea of calling 
the group Mosaic. Yes, it was the first browser, but those of us in the group are 
so different in our backgrounds that we each had something to bring to the table. 
I-baLL later came up with the name of Patterns of Recognition. Each of us was a 
different pattern, and the acronym for the group, P.O.R., also had a humorous 
side. We were all flat on our assets, and were poor. The name stuck.

So, here we are, not even a year out from that weekend, waiting to see what 
tomorrow will make us do.

**Judas Iscariot's Highly Anticipated Grossly Overdue**
****************** Fifth HOPE Recap! ******************
*******************************************************
************** -= By: Judas Iscariot =- ***************



So, like 8 months ago the Fifth HOPE came and went and, in the world of hackerdom, a 
peace was spread across the land.  A peace that came in the symbol of George W. Bush 
crossed with Hitler to produce a love child of Big Brother.  Who is watching you.  
Watching you poop.  Oh excuse me, that's Captain Crunch.  Regardless, I attended the 
Fifth Hope (hereby referred to as "La Quinta Esperanza") and had me a time that I will 
never be forget. Let me introduce you to a world of eating lots of McDonalds and 
Sbarro for three days and smelling more B.O. than your 80 year old grandmother's 
trailer park home.

DAY 1 - "I got some black cats if you want them..." -Anonymous

I arrived from the Bus Depot into Penn Station.  I called up the jolly hax0r evil by 
the name of Murd0c and tried to figure out where he was staying. My room at the 
hotel wouldn't be ready until the next day. Regardless I went to the room and saw 
a shitload of people whose live journals I've read before but never met.  I knew the 
familiars from the PLA and NYC2600.  Hands were shook and new friendships started.  
"K-rad!!," I thought to myself.  I checked in with Cheshire Catalyst and the crappy 
speaker registration which consisted of the l33t system of pen and paper (Come on 
2600, you can afford DNA spectroanalyzers can't you?  Hook that up Bernie!).  

Here are some highlights and statistics from Day 1...



BREAKFAST:      Waffles at home

LUNCH:          Shitty bus termial vending machine food

DINNER:         Wendy's in NYC where you can't eat in the basement or else you get 
                yelled at by the black lady.

FUN LEVEL:      7 - Good times.  Happy Days. What's Happenin.


DAY 2 - "DAMN THE PLA!" - Bird

The start of La Quinto Esperanza and incidently the night that I would have to 
present a panel with a few friends.  The great thing about this was that none of us 
had really prepared anything beyond a few posts to a yahoo group that had more 
cobwebs then Carolyn Mienal's vag.  Yeah, that's right.  I said it. P-H-4-G-1-N-A!  
Anyway, most of the day was spent going to sub-par panels with sub-par seating for 
my sub-par posture.  Mitnick was speaking around 3 or 4 so we all went to that.  All 
I can say is that I felt like I was in a sauna of nerd and it wasn't the good type.  
I don't know what the front of the crowd looked like but in the back it looked like 
uglypeople dot com (I-baLL uses his mad l33t editing skills to put in the following 
comments: You shoudn't: a. judge people by how they look and b. go to a hacker 
convention and act like you're expecting a fashion show.)  I escaped from the Temple 
of n00b and retired to my room where myself, Murd0c, Enamon, Gonzo, and probably 
I-baLL proceeded to shoot the shit and partake in the luxorious 10 by 5 room I was 
paying some nice change for per night. Love you Hotel Pennsylvania and your insane 
room dimensions.  After some self medication we headed to Rob T. Firefly's room to 
figure out what the hell we were gonna do.  We started to get tired but then Grey 
Frequency cast Life3 and we were all going again.

THE PANEL

For security purposes, because we all are mega starz in the hax0r1ng and phr34k1ng 
w0r1d, the HOPE crew had to secure the area for our arrival.  This meant a long wait 
had to occur which is why everyone had to endure the nasal writhings of PeeWee (the 
dreaded cling-on). Before Gonzo ripped out his heart, the doors were opened and we 
set up shop.  Our panel for the PHONE LOSERS OF AMERICA went exceedingly well at La 
Quinto Esperanza (now known as "HackerQuotesFor3DaysStraight.zip").  When the time 
came at the end of the panel, we had phr33 sh1t to give out because we are like the 
k1ngz of the warez scene and we f-serve even in real life and shit.  As soon as the 
words "free" left RTF's mouth, a huge insane riot erupted out of the crowd.  Chairs 
were thrown, microphones were destroyed, dogs were unleashed into the mayhem and 
general chaos ensued (I-baLL notes: This is an exageration. Only one dog was 
unleashed.)  I jumped out of my chair just as the flames started. After kicking a 
rotweiler's ass I headed for the door.  There was partying to be done.  

THE PARTY - "Welcome to the Fifth Hope!!!" - Shardy 

We got a tip on our Nokia Imported GPS Blackberry's that we gotz to get our 4ss3s to
ROOM NUMBER DELETED BY EDITOR (I-baLL says: I've deleted the number of room 402A in 
order to protect the guilty) for a party in Emmanuel's room.  It was packed to the 
max and mad shit was going on.  Pr0n was on the walls, kids were drunk, people were 
self-medicating all over the place, some kid was jacking off because he was sitting 
on Emmanuel's bed, it was crazy.  I got plastered and stayed until hotel security 
kicked us all out.  I met Johnny Xmas (sup d00dzer!<>$) there too.  Went back to my 
room and slept. 

Stats for 

DAY 2 

BREAKFAST:        McDonalds ("Yes you guys, that IS Cap'n Crunch.")

LUNCH:            SBARRO 

DINNER:		  SBARRO


DAY 3 - Let's play files from phone trips for our panel! 

Ugh.  Day 3 started off brutal.  Crunch had a panel which gave me a headache because he 
played a file from phone trips (I-baLL interrupts again to say: Actually it was a pretty 
cool panel.) Damn Crunch.  He watches you poop.  I left the con with murd0c and m1k3tv 
for food and cheap bootlegs on Canal St.  I think we went back for a few panels but 
nothing mind blowing.  Since we are the alpha and the omega we were up on the jive, and
the Hacker Halfway House (Rest in Peace fair soul, for you did good whilst you existed) 
was having a bomb ass party.  It was all that and a bag of doritos.  Cool Ranch. But not 
the kind where you don't get any flavor salt shits because I hate that shit and that's like 
having a girlfriend but not the sex.  The party was bomb, self-medicating rocks more then 
Danzig, and I was having a damn good time.  On the roof of the HHH a new alliance was 
formed that will change the face of history as man knows it.  A powerfull alliance that 
not even your fuckin' dumb ass mom could break.  Got it?  Much props to the Hacker Halfway 
House and whoever fuckin' ruined it should be hung up by a guitar string around their 
nutsacks.

Let's get it on with Day 3 statistics...

BREAKFAST:	Sbarro.  I'm really getting sick of it by now.

LUNCH:          Hot Dogs?

DINNER:         Sbarro.


DAY 3 - More stupid panels

(I-baLL points out that this is probably day 4. Parts of this article's chronology isn't 
right so...uh..ignore that.) There was some more stupid panels and some more stupid shit 
going on.  Everyone hung out for the last time and things started to wind down. The feds 
were leaving and soon a ton of nerds would have their mothers picking them up in the Family
Caravan to make the long trek home to "the Batcave".  I think this day topped the medication
faction.  It started raining inside and I remember talking to Gonzo about the Misfits.  

SIDE NOTE:  I read online that some people got miffed at me for leaving wihtout saying goodbye.  
I had an early bus to catch and didn't get time to say bye but didn't do it on purpose.  Sorry.  
Somewhere in there I met 2 kids who needed a place to medicate so they came up to our room. One 
kid had a stolen FRS radio and was toning out the security team and all communication on the 
channel with the radio's rendition of La Cuca Racha.  I traded him some medicine for it and the
power was in my hands.  My dumb ass only brought a scanner, but now I could Tx to my hearts 
content (and Tx I did).  Towards the end of the con I watched dumbass Jello who was cool but my 
legs were tired and there was a bad case of the crabs going around.  I didn't want to catch that 
shit.  A few of us headed to the NOC room to get free shit.  I stayed an extra day and then caught 
my bus home.  No statistics for Day 3 because I was in a haze by then.


AWESOME SHIT THAT HAPPENED:

Bathroom BBS

Good Panel - SUPER DEATH RIOT WITH MULTIPLE CASUALTIES!

Good friends, good medicine, good brew


STUPID SHIT THAT WAS DUM N GHEY :(  :(  :(

Not long enough 

Too many people smelled

Crunch

Nothing you fucks!  It rocked!  If you didn't go you missed out. Loser.
