Hola, seniores y senioritas. Mi llamo I-baLL and I never learned how
to speak Spanish so I'll drop that facade right now. Anyways, lemme
apologize for this late release. PoR Issue 3 was actually ready over
a month ago. I just took my sweet time trying to verify some stuff
for an article but never ended up actually getting to try it out.
Success is 20 percent intelligence, 20 percent ideas, and 60 percent
drive. Well, I don't have my license yet (long story) so I can't drive
therefore...eh...bad joke.

But seriously, so much shit happened since our last release. Waay too
many people died. Hunter S. Thompson died (It's extremely hard to express
my feelings over his death. All I can say is that he will be missed. That
may sound like cliche that everybody says but beneath that statement lays
my frustration at the loss of an icon, a pioneer, and a..fuck. This sounds
cheesy. Anyway, the guy didn't shy away from conflict. And he wrote. It's
from him, as well as the fictional character of Spider Jerusalem, that I
get my romanticized mental image of just going into midst of things with
my senses, a laptop, a net connection, and a voice to write out. But fuck,
too much ME here and not enough PoR so I'll shut up right now.), Terry
Schiavo died (OMG PUNK RAWK!), Mitch Hedberg died (fuck!), and the Pope
died as well (A trusted source tells us a rumour that: "The pope died cause 
he couldn't wait for PoR #3 to come out!") Life happens. Death happens. Shit
happens. PoR Official Release # 3 happens.

Fuck, people, correspond with us! Send us emails. We are like human senses.
Craving feedback. But preferably with a high signal to noise ration. Our
email is, as always, patternsofrecognition at yahoo dot com. Id you got an idea,
a tip, a rumour, a question, or maybe even an article, then write to us!
Also link to us from your websites so we can claim faim in the scene and stuff.
And so we can write cheesy books like "Become a Phreaker in 12 easy steps" or
something shitty like that.

Yes, I am rambling to fill up space.....

This isn't really a correction as much as a follow up. Basically TCC Teleplex
has fixed up their web kiosks so you can't use the google images trick to get
free internet access. They fixed it by making only www.google.com free. If you
click on "Preferences" or "images" or whatever then the kiosk asks for money.
Well, that sucks. By the way, if any TCC Teleplex employees are reading this:
Put notifications, on your web kiosks, that point out that you ban the accessing
of some sites. Like 2600.com and binrev.com and phonelosers.org. I don't want to
discover that these sites are banned AFTER I put in my quarter.

Okay, now in the second part of this section Judas will address my comments that
I snuck into his article in the last PoR issue....:

***(INSERT PRETTY BORDER HERE)***

I was sitting at my computer reading PoR issue #2 and this
awesome ass article by a guy named judasiscariot 
(I-baLL rudely inserts comment: "Refering to yourself in 
3rd person is one of the first signs of the presence of
Paranoid Schizophrenia.")
Further down in the article, I made a comment about some of 
the people that attended HOPE.  I-BaLL, as editor, added in 
his own comments saying that I shouldn't judge people off how
they look.  <dr. phil>This kinda made me really think how 
sometimes you are perceived by your style of writing.</end 
dr. phil>  Truth is, I give everyone a fair chance and don't
base someone 100% off their looks.  I think a good deal of
the hacker/phreaker world were outcasts in this fucked up
society at one time.  We all know what it's like, and the 
hacker community is one with very open arms.  As long as 
your here for a pursuit of knowledge, you are pretty much
accepted.  Tr0n might not like you, but it'll be okay.  My
style of writing is one of that of sarcasm and wit.  I guess
you could say I like working in the blue.  Just how I am.  
(I-baLL adds: "You still look like a hippie to me!" *ducks*)

I will now take the time to apologize to everyone in the 
hacker/phreaker community.  (except the ugly people)

<333s, 
Judas Iscariot

*******************************************************
* DCT2500 Diagnostics, Comcast Digital Cable, and You *
*******************************************************
************** -= By: Judas Iscariot =- ***************

Okay.  Let's talk Digital Cable.  This new medium of 
television broadcasting is taking the world by storm and
has been on a steady pace of world domination for the 
past few years.  I think the FCC has a mandate that says
sometime in 2005 or 2006 all broadcasting must be digital. 
Or something like that.  

Comcast will gladly provide you, the end user, with a 
brand spanking new Motorola DCT2500 if you sign up for 
their digital cable service.  I think there's a rental
fee for the box, but that’s not important to this article.
The DCT2500 has standard cable connections, some AV jacks, 
a serial port, and a detachable power cord.  I have a
black version DCT2500 system since I didn't shell out the
moola for the DVR (Digital Video Record) model.  

After carefully watching my cable guy hook it all up
and setting up the system, I started playing around with 
it, trying to recreate the steps he was taking.  

*** Ready kids?  Here comes the phun part! ***

Power on your DCT2500.  After the box boots and your getting
channel reception, press POWER to turn the box off.  As soon
as you do this hit the "SELECT/OK" button.  You have about a 
2 second window to do this.  On some models an additional 
press of the "MENU" key is required.  Once you do this, a 
blue diagnostic screen should appear.  My output was as follows,


	DCT2500 DIAGNOSTICS

	01  GENERAL STATUS
 	02  OOB STATUS
        03  IN BAND STATUS
	04  AUDIO/VIDEO STATUS
	05  UNIT ADDRESS
	06  FIRMWARE VERSION
 	07  CURRENT CHANNEL STATUS
	08  RENEWABLE SECURITY
	09  UPSTREAM MODEM
	10  APP CODE MODULES
	11  MEMORY CONFIG
	12  INTERACTIVE INFO
	13  MAC FREQUENCY TABLE
	14  CONTROL CHANNELS
	15  MESSAGE TYPES
	16  IN BAND PAT
	17  IN BAND PMT
	18  TASK STATUS
	19  USB STATUS
	20  IB MCA STATUS
	21  KEYBOARD/LED


Phew.  That's a lot of menus to play around with.  Shitty thing
is that everything is Read-Only.  You cannot make any changes
through the remote or control panel on the box in these sub-
menu's.  Remember, D-I-A-G-N-O-S-I-T-C-S.  We're not here to 
change anything......yet.  While that does suck, one does gain
a lot of information from these menus.  Most of them contain 
technical information regarding values on the box.  

The first menu, GENERAL STATUS, contains box error codes, PPV
and On Demand purchases, Machine ID, and time zone information.
PPV Purchases is interesting because the machine keeps a record
of how many things you have ordered through it.  Comcast will
send a signal to the box which relays the purchase information 
back to headquarters.  Since the DCT2500 contains EEPROM (Elect-
ically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory), this value cannot
be reset.  More on this later. 

Menu's 2 through 10 just give information regarding settings and 
parameters in the box.  Video settings such as MPEG layering and 
Firmware revisions are reported.  Just incase anyone is curious, 
my DCT2500 contains a firmware of 02.42 with a BOOT of 02.31.

Menu 12, INTERACTIVE INFO, is what my cable guy was looking at 
after he booted the box for the first time while had his tech on 
the phone.  This menu contains your box IP address on the Comcast
network, Box state, and a listing of what ports are being utilized
and which are not.  My IP was in the 10.2.35.96 range and 2 ports
were open.  My port output was follows:

	Sockets/Ports

	0  5555  RECVING  
	1  1024  Ready	
	2        UNUSED
	3        UNUSED
	4        UNUSED
	5        UNUSED

I haven't had time to experiment and I know the security must be 
a pain in the ass, but there has to be a way to hook this box up 
to a machine and drill through those ports.  

Menu 14, CONTROL CHANNEL INFO list out channels, band, and it's PID.  
Wait a minute?  PID number?  Can we say Process ID!  This menu has
changing values every tick (one second of refresh).  Weird thing is 
that while your viewing this menu, the value for CNT raises by a few
intervals.  Output as follows:

        CHN   BAND     PID   CNT   OVFL   ERROR
         0    INB     0000   234     0      0
     *   1    INB     003B  1308     0      0
     *   2    INB     0000     0     0      0
    (continued)

Pretty neat stuff.  Just flipping through the menus gives one a world
of information.  I didn't know that functions such as On Demand and 
TV Guide were loaded in as modules.  Now that we've covered all that, 
your probably sitting there saying "That's great Judas, just tell us
how to get free digicable god damnit!@#"  Truth is, it's going to be a
pain in the ass to get free digital cable and the risk of cable theft
is great.  

Digital filters for the cable line have been appearing on the internet.
In a nutshell what they do is block the transmission from your box to
Comcast.  Remember the PURCHASE information?  Comcast essentially 
POLLS the boxes to send this information so they can charge you.  The
filter keeps the box from sending, so Comcast never sees the charges.  
Here's the problem with that.  With your remote, you can only charge 
up to $80 or $85.  After that you have to call Comcast to order anything.
So you take off the filter and BAM!  $80 of you hard earned l33t hax0r
money is gone.  It's a no win situation.  The only way to get around
this would to find a way to overwrite that address of the memory.  
Nothing has been found yet.


I do not present this information as fact.  This was all concluded based
off my own research and conclusions.  I know there's gonna be people out 
there that think they are holier then thou and know this shit, but out of 
all the people I showed that menu to, only 1 knew about already so suck 
my dick you pretentious egotistical fucks.  If you'd like to discuss digital 
cable or anything mentioned here further, please email me at

0o0o0o MSL's and you...and using BitPim o0o0o0
o0o0o0o0o0o0oo0o  by sCi  0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o

Okay, maybe not profit...but definitly fun

First things first, if you remember in my last article I gave lots
of codes...and some of those asked for an MSL. Exactly what is an 
MSL, you might ask yourself? Well, its this fun neat code that keeps
us from doing anything too dumb...like fucking up the phone REAL good.
It also keeps us from switching the phone to another CDMA network...
which actually would be pretty dumb too... But this is the age of 
information, right?

MSL stands for Mobile Security Lock(im pretty certain), and there are
some reasonable ways to get them! They are created by some form of 
formula within Sprints formulas of Oz...but thats not the important 
part. The important part is that simply by calling up Sprint's PCS 
Activation Number(an 800 number you can look up yourself) and acting
like a cellphone reseller with an annoyed customer who needs his phone
reset, they'll look up the code for you. This is called Social Engineering
children, the important part is to remeber...your in some kind of store, 
with an angry customer, that you have to keep from going insane(remember to 
reassure your customer that youll fix this in a second, they just have to
look up the code for you...etc). The important thing is to have the phones
ESN handy, which will be convinently located under the battery on most modern
Sprint phones.

Well, how does the phone know what the MSL is? Well, simple: its stored in
there. This is where BitPim comes in. First things first: cellphones all have
a file system. The phone allows your computer to read these files for neat
programs like FutureDial(as evil as it may be...$50 for fucking software) that
can backup your phonelists, put porn on as your backround, mess around with
your calendar...all sorts of fun stuff. However, the phone lets you read 
EVERYTHING...including a file with the MSL. BitPim is an open source program
that does exactly that...reads the whole data system for you. www.bitpim.org.
Even lets you play with these files...and for most phones it allows you to
edit calendar, ringtones and other such file system stuff. You'll need a cable
and drivers for them, you can get the cable and drivers for the cable at 
Radio Shack, some independant cables will work. This might cost you a bit,
but you can use the cables for lots(I am actually uploading this via one...)
Back on topic...

Beyond this point your on your own. First thing would be to find out how many
digits are in your MSL...there were 6 in mine. Next is to look through the 
folders in the filsystem tab of BitPim for the variable file. Mine was under
the nvm folder, you might want to give it a check there. At one point youll
see something like this 

00000070 00 01 35 39 33 37 01 00 00 00 00 01 33 30 30 37     ..5937......3007
00000080 38 32 01 32 35 38 32 36 37 01 20 20 20 20 20 20     82.258267.      

Gee...two 6 digits codes seperated by a period...wonder what that could be?
Well, remember that the first one is a one time use only code...the second one
is your MSL

Look around! Discover more! Dont be a script kiddie! Send anything you find to 
me! Happy Hunting

"Knowledge.. A breath of cool air to quench parched thoughts. Lives lived in 
shadows of ideas, people waiting to see the light. They feel the tingle, in 
the back of the neck…those who fear it, they feel it, they know its there, 
wanting to understand it failing to embrace it. It haunts their thoughts as 
they live every day conforming to realties given to them, truths cloaked in 
lies surrounding facts… enigmas wrapped and warped in riddles and puzzles 
confusing the simple minded giving no choice but to believe in what they are 
told…Information is freedom, freedom is knowledge, knowledge is power.. "

Hacker History
By:
Gonzo

     Gather 'round, kiddies. It's time for a history lesson.
No one can say with certainty just how the term "hacker" came into use. There 
are so many stories about the word's origin that we will probably never know. 
What ever the case, hackers are what we are.
     
     On numerous occasions, I've had people ask me "How do you hack?" I tell 
them "It's not that easy." It's not, either. Gone are the days when hackers 
were on side of the aisle, and phreakers on the other. Future shock got to us,
too. We've progressed to the point where no one really knows all there is to know 
about one thing anymore. At any rate, I can't stress the importance of knowing 
hacker history, be it something that happened last week, or something from the 
M.I.T. days in the late 50s/early 60s. Here are some bits of hacker history that 
really capture the hacker spirit.

     In 1961, Caltech students hacked the Rose Bowl game. One student, in an act
of social engineering, posed as a reporter, and interviewed the director of the 
University of Washington card stunts. These are usually the people who have had 
way too much beer, have painted themselves in team colors, and are the ones who 
hold up the cards that make pictures. It was revealed how the stunts were pulled 
off, and that the director would be out for dinner later.

     While the director was eating, the students, known as the "Fiendish Fourteen," 
picked a lock, and got away with a blank direction sheet for the card stunts. They 
made 2300 copies of the blank. They picked the lock again the next day, and made 
off with the master plans for the stunts, large sheets of graph paper colored in 
with the stunt pictures. This could be considered to be the first known grep. Using 
these as a guide, they made new instructions for three of the stunts on the copied 
blanks. They broke in again, and replaced the new sheets for the original ones.
     The result was three different pictures. Instead of WASHINGTON, CALTECH was shown. 
Another trick showed the word HUSKIES, the Washington nickname, backwards. The last was 
supposed to have been a picture of a husky, but showed a beaver instead. Caltech and 
M.I.T. use the beaver as a mascot.

     Here's one more.

     In 1982, M.I.T. hacked the Harvard-Yale football game. After Harvard's second 
touchdown, in the first quarter, a small, black ball popped up out of the ground, and 
grew bigger, bigger, and bigger with the letters "M.I.T." all over the ball. As everyone 
watched, the ball grew to be six feet in diameter, and them popped with a bang and a 
cloud of white smoke.

     The Boston Globe said of the experience "If you want to know the truth, M.I.T. won 
the game."

     The stunt was pulled of by M.I.T.'s Delta Kappa Epsilon frat. The ball was actually 
a weather balloon, a hydraulic ram that ran on freon gas to lift it out of the ground, 
and a vacuum motor to inflate it. They made eight trips to Harvard Stadium anywhere
between 1 to 5 in the morning, finding an unused 110-volt outlet running buried wires to
the 40-yard line, where the unit was buried. When it came time for showtime, all that 
had to be done was flip a circuit breaker, and plug something in.

     This had the hoof prints of a killer hack. Surprise, publicity, safety, and genius 
were all present. The fact that it was manually controlled allowed for perfect timing 
because it was set off during plays. There was even a note attached saying that no 
explosives were present.

     Pranks are always fun. When I get the chance to walk through Times Square, or look 
at the screens over MSG, I get a strange itching in my fingers. Don't you?

&!!!!& How to Spoof CPN/CID Without Asterisk &!!!!&
&!!!!&!!!!&!!!!&!!!!&!!!!&!!!!&!!!!&!!!!&!!!!&!!!!&


So too many people are asking how to spoof CPN/CID. Hell, pay 
services have popped up that let you do that nowadays. Star68 
(or whatever) and Covertcall. Well there's a better and cheaper
way to spoof CPN/CID.

Get an account with a VoIP provider that allows you to choose your 
CPN/CID. Like VoIPJet. Then download iaxCOMM. Now set up iaxCOMM 
with your VoIPJet account details + the host that you'll be using. 
Now go to "Preferences" and select "Caller ID. Now select which 
Caller ID you want to use. That's it! Fast. Easy. And cheaper than 
CovertCall.

|"Transcription of John Draper's words taken from the "Making of|
|  'Sneakers'" feature on the Sneakers Collector's Edition DVD  |
*****************************************************************

(NOTE FROM I-baLL: " 'Sneakers' is a great movie. I definatly
recommend that you buy the DVD. I transcribed this just so those
of us who don't have spare cash can have a way of finding this
info out. But if you have the cash then buy the DVD. It's freaking
awesome.)

John Draper aka Captain Crunch:

"Captain Crunch" came from a whistle in the Captain Crunch cereal box 
which was figured out by this guy named "Sid" in Los Angeles. Sid was 
a person who discovered the whistle and he discovered that the whistle 
was capable of emitting a tone that is used by the phone company to 
disconnect long distance calls. All it does was - All it does is issue 
a disconnect signal. It really couldn't make a free call with a whistle 
but you could in certain circumstances. In some very, very old exchanges, 
if you blew the whistle 3 times in rapid succession, doot-doot-doot, like 
that,  then you would dial the digit "3" and so you could dial - actually 
dial numbers by blowing the whistle with a long burst to, first of all, 
clear the line and then burst it with pulses to actually dial a number. 
Those only work on very, very old step-by-step exchanges that were controlled 
by tones. Since that time they've converted all those - all those equipment 
over to multi-frequency tones and the multi-frequency tones are what the blue 
box's sound when you make a call. And these are the internal switching tones, 
they are not the same as touch-tones you would normally use on a - on a today's 
modern phones. They're a totally different set of tones.

*There's some speaking by somebody else right now. The guy's basically saying a 
small version of what Crunch says next....*

The story essentially was that I was incarcerated in jail and, while I was in 
jail, I was - I was exposed to the criminal element in jail and talked quite - 
quite a bit extensivly about my activities to the other prisoners in jail as 
what normal people would do when they're in jail. So I did a lot of information 
exchange and told quite a few - gave - gave out quite a bit of information about 
how to do things and it was made very clear that if I didn't do that that my 
life in jail would be very uncomfortable.

Well, we've reached the end of another PoR release. So, before I forget,
a little rant from yours truly:

Do not abuse information. Use it. Have fun with it. But don't kill it.
Please do not burn your bridges. Don't destroy but explore and create.
With great information comes great responsibility. Uncle Ben! Uncle Ben!

That's it for the rant. Now for something else:

A current idea is that PoR will go on break for a bit. Issue # 4 will
be released soon though and will be mostly composed of found stuffs.
That is stuff found while trashing, through social engineering, whatever.
That way we'll just transcribe stuff and/or cut and paste. A concentrate
of disorganized data injected into the text stream of a PoR Official
Pubic...uh...Public Release.

Don't forget to email us at:

patternsofrecognition at yahoo dot com. Okay? Coolness.
