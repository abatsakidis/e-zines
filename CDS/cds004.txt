i've been told that the last three issues of cds had confused over 90% of the
readers; they had no idea how to get in touch with me. i apologize for any
inconvenience i might have caused you. statistics report that 75% of all
hispanic readers misread what i had put in issue #2 and now work at taco bell.
and that's why, this time around, i'm gunna make sure you understand.

the easiest way to get in touch with me is by e-mail. my e-mail address is:

 sirbob@juno.com

if you would like to call the whq for cds then go right ahead. here's the
number:

 the shadow of cyberia
 602-451-8564

now i know that you ^hate^ making long distant phone calls. that's why i
finally put up two toll free numbers so you can call my bbs. it's called cs's
dime a minute plan. you simply dial either of the two numbers below and mike
dietz pays for it.

node 2: 1-800-C4LL-4TT
node 3: 1-800-C0LL3CT

(technology is amazing these days.)

---

cEE dEE eSS is a free publication zine. if you have something funny and/or
informative to say, say it in here!@#

what you will receive if you send me an article for cds:

 1 official cds tee-shirt (signed by mike dietz)
 1 pornography video of mike dietz and/or a g0at
 3 toll free at&t operator home fone numbers

and if you run a bbs, you will be placed into a drawing for the official
children of a dying sun support bbs. (that is, if your board is better than
mine. <cough>)

^-_-^ woof! eye yam the g0at herder.

i guess this is issue number four. it's been great these past few months and i
know there are a lot of readers out there that love us.. why don't you give us
some feedback!@#? ... i'm not going to point any fingers, but you know who
you are. damn lazy readers...

purifier has been found, although, i doubt he will ever be able to write for
cds again. (see the three part purifier saga.) if you happen to bump into him
on the irc, give him my regards.

there is a new alarm clock concept out on the market. it is called EREBUS.
satan was the first to try this totally new way of waking up each morning and
has expressed, "EREBUS is great. thanks to him, i am no longer late for work!"

the way EREBUS works is simple. you give EREBUS your bbs number and let him
apply. then, each morning, EREBUS will call up your bbs and page you until you
wake up. EREBUS is totally free and, due to the fact that he has no life, will
constantly humour you.

to get your own EREBUS, call up anarchist unite and apply online. you won't be
disappointed.

as always, mike dietz is still trying to shut down the entire warez scene. how
do i know this, you ask? well one night i was bored and decided to call up
good 'ol mike and see what he was up to. naturally i told him i was from the
spa and needed to check out his bbs. in a crude attempt to direct the
attention towards me and my bbs (without him actually knowing it), this is how
the conversation went:

md = mike dietz; cs = me
------------------------
md : can i help you?
cs : yes. my name is jeremy landovich. i work for a branch of the fbi called
     the software piracy association, or more commonly known, the spa.
md : what do you need?
cs : i need to call your bbs to examine it. we have gotten several anonymous
     tips that you have been illegally pirating software.
md : noooo! the only thing i have ever pirated is norton utilities and xtgold.
     and i gave both of those programs out to atleast twenty people only. it's
     not like i'm a big time courier for risc.
cs : according to the anonymous tip, you call a pirate bbs regularly to
     download child pornography. is this true?
md : well, i know it's a pirate bbs, but where else am i going to get my
     porno? i just ignore the warez...
cs : i see. how often would you say you call this pirate bbs?
md : <short pause> every day. maybe twice a day. actually i'm downloading 10
     megs of child porn right now.
cs : sir, are you aware that the activities you are engaging in at this very
     moment are illegal?
md : uhm well uhm well, no. but i was just talking to you guys the other day.
     i dialed 1-800-388-PIR8. i have been trying to shut down a bbs called the
     shadow of cyberia. they won't let me on, and i know they have warez.
cs : the shadow of cyberia is a pirate bbs?
md : yes!!!
cs : do you have any proof of this?
md : no, i tried to login, but it said i needed something called a nup. but
     don't worry, i'll call back and try to upload some of my porn. that
     always seems to work.
cs : sir, it's obvious that your bbs is not a pirate bbs and there is no need
     to pursue this conversation any further. thank you for your time.
md : no problem. and hey, if you want, i can send you some of my porn. what's
     your e-mail address?
cs : <click>

w0w. mike just told me his entire plan; he is trying to shut down my bbs. that
gives me a chance to tighten the security and keep him off. thanks mike!@# but
what am i worried about? it's not like i am doing anything illegal.. <cough>

1-800-388-PIR8 wants you to turn in your friends, family, and even relatives
to be prosecuted by the spa. if you see someone with an illegal copy of
windows 95, don't be afraid to call. you will be doing a great justice to your
country and to your fellow programmer.

happy halloween@!# this year, while you are out trick or treating, i'm gunna
rob your home. do me a favor and leave me your house key under the door mat.

anyway ...

according to some sources--mainly the phreakER community--a new style of trick
or treating has been developed. it is called "phreak or treat." basically what
is done is this: if someone does not give you your candy when you ask for it,
you come back later that night and phreak the hell out of them.

---

while a7 and i were out phreak or treating, we decided to hit mike dietz's
house. being the unkind host he is, mike decided not to answer our candy
craving cries. he wouldn't even acknowledge our presence. after several hours
of banging on his door, a7 and i decided to take a different approach.

we left and wandered around his neighborhood for a few more hours, stealing
candy, egging cars, tipping cows, that sort of thing. boredom prevailed and i
suggested we return to mike's house to see what he was up to. after all, the
rules clearly state, "phreak or treat." and we hadn't exactly gotten our
treat.

mike's house appeared to be empty and their was a note taped to his front
door. it read:

 dear ups man,

 an emergency situation has come up and we had to leave immediately without
 notifying our neighbors. if you happen to deliver a package addressed to
 mike dietz, just leave it on the doorstep. hopefully we will be back before
 you drop off the package. (we will probably be gone for atleast three days.)

 sincerely,
 mike dietz

a7 began to laugh and i soon joined in. we made our way to mike's telco box
and began ripping it apart. i called up an operator and had her setup a
teleconference for me. a7 was busy calling out with his laptop. i looked at
the screen and noticed he was harassing a sysop in egypt.

two hours later i got a great idea. digging through my backpack i pulled out
an am transmitter. "hey a7," i said, "lets hook up this am transmitter to
mike's phone and broadcast his conversations." a7 agreed.

a few days later mike returned from his emergency situation. a7 and i were
already waiting with our am receiver:

md = mike dietz; nc = nick coons
--------------------------------
RING .. RING
nc : hello?
md : hey nick! i just got back.
nc : so. it's not like you are my friend.
md : oh well. but guess what. i finally got that package i had been waiting
     for!
nc : which one?
md : you know, spanky's porno collection. volume one.
nc : that's disgusting...
md : no it's not! actually i'm watching the tape right now.
nc : uhh.. uhh.. i need to go now.
md : you want to come over later on? maybe you can watch it with me.
nc : <click>

i clicked the am receiver off and turned to a7. "this sure is going to make a
scary tail to tell around the camp fire."

a7 agreed. "definitely. if i was a little kid and heard that story, i'd
probably become afraid of the dark for life."

the following capture is of john mcgowan, a world renown ascii artist. he is
giving a tip, to a beginner, on how to become a better ascii artist. you may
not have heard of john mcgowan in the art scene, but he is huge in the public
domain scene:

You have to learn ASCII????? MOron, fucking moron.  ASCII is so simple, get a
fucking chart and use that.  Dillhole!

---

during the short interview between john and i, john clearly states that the
art scene is nothing but a bunch of snotty nosed kids who don't know what real
art is. here is a portion of the conversation that we had:

jm = john mcgowan; cs = me
--------------------------
cs : so tell me john. what is it like to be the best ascii artist in the
     world?

jm : Oh, I'm not the best ASCII artist in the world. I am the best ASCII
     artist in the entire universe. Get that straight! <G>

cs : how long, would you estimate, have you been at the top of the art scene?

jm : My BBS is what keeps me at the top of the art scene. There is NO BBS that
     could possibly compare to mine, in both ANSI and ASCII.

cs : how would you describe the art scene?

jm : The art scene, eh? I'd have to say that the art scene is cluttered with
     snotty nosed children. That is why I am going to convert my net (PRONET)
     into an art group. Soon EVERYONE will come to know what REAL art is! <G>

i wish someone would have told me, but now all the phreaks are calling the
public domain boards. no i didn't say art boards.. i didn't even say elite.
here's a message posted by the greatest phreakER in the world:

Date: 9:21 pm  Fri Sep 20, 1996        Number : 85 of 85
From: Jackal                           Base   : Where The Elite Meet

    While sitting at my terminal doing nothing, I began to wonder what my
phone bill would be if I hadn't gotten free service from the phone company.
(Bless Sprint's soul for the gift of free calls!)  Soon I began to compile and
add phone calls I had record of.  Using standard international phone rates, I
found that over a six month period (thats as far as my records go) I stole
about $3,400 from the phone company in the manner of services.  This does not,
however, include satellite calls; routing through SatCom 1 is probably more
expensive than I care to mention.

    In all though I can estimate that I've taken a whopping $10,200 (not very
much considering) in phone services.  Again that is minus satellite service
(just add about $3,000 or so).  In all this is more than anything else I've
ever "stolen", i.e. credit fraud.

    And yet.....I feel no guilt.

    My Moto:  If they are dumb enough not to stop you or are so stupid they
can't stop you; they deserve what they get.

[--part four--]

it happened again; i got r00t on mike dietz's bbs. i guess that will teach him
to use the password "p0rn" for every bbs that he calls.

while i was on mike dietz's computer, i found a hidden directory with atleast
300 megs of child pornography. below is a brief capture of the files (with
descriptions added.)

(what baffles my mind is that mike dietz has official cds porn!@?#)

==============================================================================
the two issue long search for purifier has been called off. here is the brief
recap of the entire story.

after a7, hound, and i had left purifier at thndrbolt's house, we went back
the next day to search for him. to our dismay, purifier could not be located.
we all agreed, and hoped, that purifier had escaped the clutches of thndrbolt
and would contact us shortly.

three months passed and we had still not heard from purifier. as a last
resort, i called up thndrbolt's bbs (since thndrbolt doesn't have a voice
phone number) and paged thndrbolt until he answered. the only thing that he
would type was:

gte m out of hre!

everyone knows that thndrbolt isn't very good with grammar and i figured he
was simply telling me to get lost.

a few days later i was talking to a7 on the phone and we began discussing the
purifier incident. we thought back to the night we had called out from 
thndrbolt's telco box. what was odd was the fact that thndrbolt *knew* who
had messed with him. (in issue number two thndrbolt had pretended to bury
purifier in his front yard.) i slowly began to piece together bits of
evidence and came to a slightly obvious conclusion.

"ahhh hah!@#" i said, "it's clear now."

"what?" a7 said. he was busy resoldering his crystal back onto his tone
dialer.

"i think i know where purifier is."

"where is he?!"

i thought it through one more time and then said, "thndrbolt has him tied up
in his house!@#"

a7 seemed to be impressed at my amazing ability to solve mysteries. "you know,
you just might be right."

later that night, both a7 and i snuck over to thndrbolt's house and broke in.
the place appeared to be empty.

after a few minutes of searching, i found a trap door, that was hidden beneath
a dusty rug, imbedded into the floor. i lifted the door open and found a
flight of wooden stairs. we both wandered down them and stumbled around in the
dark. without warning, there was a loud grunt that sent a7 and i against the
wall. a7 quickly pulled out his flashlight and shined it towards the
frightening voice. it was purifier, and he was tied to a chair!@

"purifier," i said in a whisper, "is that you?"

he replied with a few grunts that were impossible to understand.

i ripped off the tape that was covering his mouth. "there you go," i said,
"now you can talk."

"get me out of here," he cried, trying not to cough up the crusted blood that
had formed in his throat.

a7 and i untied purifier and helped him out of the house...

later that night, as all three of us sat outside the coffee plantation having
a few smokes, i had a some questions that needed answers.

"so why didn't you try to contact us?" i asked purifier.

"i did try," he said with a sigh, "but you just hung up. when you called up
thndrbolt's bbs i just happened to be tied up next to the keyboard. i saw you
page him so i broke into chat. i tried to tell you 'get me out of here' but
you acted like i was being a jerk and hung up."

i was in utter shock. "that was you?! i could barely understand what you were
saying!@#"

"yeah yeah, i know. i was typing with my nose. my hands were tied up."

a7 and i both began laughing. "well man," i said, "everyone knows that
thndrbolt is the worst typer in the world. i figured he was telling me to get
lost."

purifier chuckled and took another drag off his smoke.

"so tell me," a7 asked, "what was it like being tied up in thndrbolt's house?"

it was apparent that purifier did not appreciate the question. his faced had
formed into a mad twist of craziness. he then began to speak in a voice that
would give even steven king chills. "it was horrible. everyday he made me
watch him type on his computer. for three months i had to watch him work on
his keyboarding lessons. he never got better. everyday the same old thing:
asdfjkl; asdfjkl; asdfjkl; asdfjkl;... it was horrible.. it was horrible.. it
was horrible.."

i slapped purifier's face, forcing him to return to reality. "damnit," i said,
"you're definitely gunna need professional help."

purifier agreed.

due to mental trauma, purifier will no longer be able to write for cds.
according to the doctor who examined him, purifier can no longer type or
comprehend complete sentences. i guess we can all thank thndrbolt for that
one.

if you would like to get a t-shirt of purifier tied up in thndrbolt's
basement, contact me through e-mail. this is a first come first serve offer.
(there are very few shirts left already.)

---[ article : a few ideas for the bbser                                  ]---
---[ author! : cs                                                         ]---
==============================================================================
the following are just thoughts for the more avid bbser. the chances are you
already know how to do most of what is mentioned, but if that is not the case,
then you are welcome.


[--part 1 (how to beat a cbv)--]

many of the popular call back verification doors usually default to an auto
security upgrade for the long distance callers. that means if you "claim" you
are calling long distance, the cbv will give you normal access to the bbs,
rather than actually calling you back. the reason for this is because most
sysops don't like to get charged for calls made out of the local area.

now how can "auto security upgrade" work for you? it's simple actually. call
up your target bbs and apply as a new user. make sure you leave a fake number
(one that is in your area code) so that the sysop does not become suspicious.
then when you are sent to the cbv, give it an alternative long distance number
to call you back at. most call back verifiers, by default, upgrade you
manually instead of actually calling the long distance number. have fun with
this one.


[--part 2 (how to lock up a renegade bbs)--]

due to a tiny little bug in the way renegade talks to the fossil driver, it is
possible to lock up the bbs. the simplest and most effective way, which
requires little effort, is to hang up immediately after the front end mailer
connects and then sends you off to the bbs. what happens is renegade loads up
and tries to detect emulation. since you are not online anymore, renegade
jumps into an endless loop, and the computer will have to be reset.

this "little bug" will also work with most bbs doors. just hang up after the
bbs shells out and loads the door. usually the bbs will not reset and stay in
limbo.

this is great for locking up that asshole sysop's bbs.


[--part 3 (exploiting your enemy)--]

exploiting your enemy is all about using their tools against them. one tool
that deserves considerable recognition is called emsi. emsi is used as a
protocol that transmits information back and forth between a remote and local
computer. the way a bbser uses emsi is by logging into a bbs without having
to actually type their login and password. as you can see, this is a crutch.

the chances are, your enemy uses emsi. that means they have all their personal
information (ie name, address, password, etc) in their emsi setup. to get your
enemy to show you what they have in their emsi setup, you must request it from
them. a good way to do this is on a multi-node bbs, in the teleconference.

to request emsi login information from your enemy, send the following request
string to them:

**EMSI_IRQ8E08

it should then spit out whatever they had in their emsi setup. have fun and
happy exploiting!@#

this is a note to _ALL_ the authors of BBS software: you guys are fucking
jerks!@ i cant believe that you would make the setup so damn easy?! thats why
we have sysops like Mike Dietz, and Josh McCarty... it's just pointless. they
have no idea how to run a bbs. the most they can do is:

C:\PORN>CD\
C:\>MD BBS
C:\>MOVE RENEGADE.ZIP .\BBS
C:\>CD BBS
C:\BBS>PKUNZIP RENEGADE.ZIP -D

i hate it! that's all sysops can do anymore. and because so many idiots do it,
it is extremely hard to make your/my bbs stand out; it just blows g0at nuts!@
i cannot even begin to count how many times i have called a new bbs,
advertised on another k-rad system, and gotten the shitty default obv/2 setup.
then to top it all off i get thrown into chat with the sysop. this is how the
average conversation goes:

 me : why did you chat me? what do you want?
 him: umm....are you really calling long distance?
 me : yeah, and i dont have the time to chat!$#@
 him: well, i just have a few questions...
 me : hurry up, i need to go hack your ass.
 him: ok, 1st, how do you like my bbs?
 me : it's all defaults.
 him: i know, i like it too.
 me : i never said i liked it, there are NO files or msgs.
 him: msgs are pointless. why drag a conversation on for days when you can
      just chat with me? and it's not my fault there are no files, it's my
      dad's computer and he said i could only use 5 megs......
 me : NO CARRIER

why cant fiend/cott lang/lord tracer make a bbs software that requires some
type of knowledge about computers? watch out for those types of people. i'm
outta here.

---[ article : chris nowak the hacker                                     ]---

==============================================================================
hacking the net is becoming the latest crave. from first time hackers to
veteran hackers, the thrill is still the same. this is a story about chris
nowak, a net surfer and hacker. beware of chris's story though, don't let this
happen to you.

---

chris nowak was your average web surfer. he always had the latest version of
his net browser and was the proud owner of a huge "underground" bookmark.
daily chris would get on the www and cruise through it, looking for the latest
files and greatest chat rooms.

unfortunately, chris was a little hesitant with the underground files that he
found. he knew that only the privileged web surfers had access to those types
of files, which made downloading them more difficult. once he had downloaded
a file called "hack.zip" which was supposed to give guidelines on how to
become a hacker. he unzipped the file in windows, using winzip, and instead of
giving him his 5000 byte text file, it rewrote over his entire hard disk
partition, destroying everything.

people would e-mail chris constantly asking for hacking advice. he knew he
wasn't that great of a hacker, but didn't care. for the time, he was a god. a
god that ruled over others and commanded them to do his bidding. a god who was
worshipped for doing something that others could not. a god who commanded a
fine battalion of net surfers that would click at his command.

being a god had its advantages--but it also had it's disadvantages. after
living a lie for over three months, chris felt insecure about his title as
a hacker, and knew he had to do something to assure himself of his abilities.

one day, as chris was casually surfing the net, he stumbled onto a top secret
web page run by nasa. he figured if he could hack into it, his reputation in
the hacking world would rise 100% and he would become the supreme ruler.

carefully planning and plotting his hack over a period of three days, chris
got back onto the net and began server hopping. hoping that if he was going to
be traced, it would take them longer to get back to his provider.

at the nasa web page, chris saw two options, "login" and "password." this
will be simple, chris thought, all i have to do is figure out the login and
i am home free. passwords are easy to crack.

after several hours of toil, chris finally found a login that would work. "ah
ha!" chris thought aloud. "it was always right there in front of me. anonymous
is the login, i/o@lame.user.com is the password!"

he typed both the login and password and watched as the bytes counter went
wild at the bottom of his screen. "i'm in! i'm in!" he screamed in joy. "now
the world will know that i am a true hacker!"

and indeed he was in. there were all sorts of interesting things to examine
and click on. he found logs of past shuttle flights, pictures of "top secret"
military activities, and schematics for the latest shuttle crafts being built.
unfortunately, he could not download or view any of the information in the
files. it kept giving him errors like "you do not have access to download this
file." chris eventually decided that he would come back later and try to crack
the security code; then he would be able to download anything he wanted.

a day or so passed and chris had already sent word out that he had hacked
nasa. hackers from across the web came to visit chris in his very own private
chat room; they wanted to find out exactly how he had done it. chris told and
retold the the tale. everyone was amazed.

several net surfers had asked chris, "what are you going to do now?" casually,
chris always replied, "at the moment i am writing a virus that will totally
destroy nasa's home page. it will be done very soon..." chris had become what
he had longed dreamed of--a true hacker.

then on one cold, dreary night, chris awoke from his sleep with a sudden jump.
he ran to his computer and looked at the screen. there was a red flashing
e-mail icon. he dragged his mouse pointer over to it and double clicked. a new
window opened and revealed it's mysticism. the e-mail was sent by nasa.

chris broke into a cold sweat. they have found me, he thought, what will i do?
his palms had become soaked and made it difficult to hold his mouse.

the e-mail read:

 dear fellow net surfer,

 thank you for checking out our web page. if you would like to become a year
 round subscriber to "space and beyond" please fill out the order form
 attached to this e-mail and send it back to us.

 space and beyond is a magazine devoted to space exploration. it covers
 topics such as historical achievements that enable the space program to
 further it's technology, and modern day space travel.

 it is our goal to bring you the latest reports pertaining to the space
 program, astronomy, and anything else space related.

 thank you for your time.

 sincerely,

 harrold d. harper
 vice president of space and beyond


after chris had read the e-mail, he began to realize that nasa had not caught
him, in fact, but instead sent him a letter about their space magazine. once
again, he thought, they have not been able to track me.

the following morning, chris went back to nasa's secret web page and logged
back on. this time he was going to exploit them and unleash his newly written
virus.

after he had finished his work, he returned to his own private chat room and
told his faithful followers what he had done. "i have destroyed nasa," he
said, "and now i control their satellite in space. right now i have it pointed
at my house, giving me free cable!"

chris had never had cable before, and now thanks to nasa, he did. he
controlled nasa's satellite and could make it do whatever he wished. maybe
i'll broadcast my favorite television show on every channel, he thought. his
imagination was running away with him.

there was a knock at the door that woke chris from his net surfing. he peered
through the key hole to see two cable men; one was holding an invoice. chris
opened the door and one of the cable men handed him the paper. "we just
installed the cable for you," the other cable man said, "give this invoice to
your dad when he gets home." then they left.

chris was in utter shock. he didn't control nasa's satellite. he hadn't 
destroyed nasa. he was a failure. chris was surely devastated.

---

now, almost a year later, chris nowak has decided to put aside his hacking
career and become a full time courier for a warez group. "i just couldn't
handle the stress of being a hacker," chris had said, "hopefully i'll be able
to return to the hacking scene and teach other newbies how to hack. but for
now, i am content."

==============================================================================
To start you need a small space--a closet roughly 60x150x200 cm (That's
2x5x6 Ft. for the archaic). Cover the walls, ceiling, and doors with
aluminized mylar (if you can find it) or aluminum foil, with the shiny side
out. This saves light for the plants; Ideally, the only light absorber in the
room is the plant.  

The next step is to put lights in the room. Fluorescents are the cheapest and
most readily available. Shop light holders will hold two 120 cm (4 Ft) bulbs.
Each bulb is rated at 40 watts. Five sets of shop lights will give 5 or 6
plants enough light for good results. That's a total of 10 bulbs or 400 watts.
The type of bulb does not really matter. Wide-spectrum grow bulbs, if you can
get them, are great, but regular shop lights work fine.

If the closet is already warm, some ventilation is required. Space under an
equivalent 10 square cm (4 sq in) hole out the top of the closet is adequate.
Alternatively, you can leave the door open a couple of cm and put aluminum
foil along the wall, near the door, to prevent light leakage. Do not let the
room temperature get over 35ø C (95ø F) as this hurts growth. Optimal
temperature is 27-30ø C (80-86ø F). Less than 21ø C (70ø F) is too cold for
good growth.

Vertically mounting the lights is best as this provides light for the entire
plant. Putting one in each corner and one over head will also work well. Use
bricks or 2x4's to raise the lamps off the floor, or use the hangers to hold
the shop lights up on the wall.

If you know how, buy sockets, boxes, and 3 wire cables (14 gauge or better),
and build an extension cord for all the shop lights. The boxes can also sit
on the platforms holding the lights up or can be tied up above the floor. (If
you have a water accident you don't want your electrical components to be
involved--it could kill you.) If you don't know how, and don't have any
friends who do, then buy the 3 ft extension cords with 3 sockets on the end.
Use one socket to plug in the shop light and another for the next extension
cord.

The reason for doing this is for the timer you'll need to put on the lights
and because most shop lights only come with a 6 inch cord.  Once your
room is set up it should seem BRIGHT since the walls are all mirrors.

Now it is time for the planting. Rockwool is the best medium but not
universally available. Potting soil mixed with pearlite, lava, sand, or
styrofoam in a 50% soil/50% lava works best. Hemp grows best in sandy or loose
soil; The roots need lots of air as well as water. For detailed instructions
seek another reference (See High Times ads), but hemp is a weed which will
pretty much grow anywhere with enough light and nutrients.

Plant 10 to 15 seeds at a time. If you get clones you can start with 5 more
plants, but they will be light starved in this small a space. Keep the light
on 24 hours a day if possible. The first stage of growth is called vegetative.
Water the plants twice a day during this time. About 12 hours apart is best,
but few hours either way is adequate. Feed the plants once a week with a
15-10-10 plant food or standard "Miracle-Gro" product from any K-Mart.  Again,
for detailed information, refer to another reference.

When the plants are about 60 cm (2 Ft) tall you can go into the flowering
stage. To do this set a timer for 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness.

For the best sinsemilla you want to cut out the males before they release
pollen. If you want seeds then this is not necessary. Reduce the number of
plants down to the best 5 females. Use the rest in brownies or cookies. The
leaf has too much vegetable matter to smoke but will work fine for eating.

The entire cycle takes about 4 months. Usually 4 to 6 weeks in vegetative
stage, 2 weeks to differentiate, and another 8 weeks to flower. Harvest when
the large sun leaves begin to yellow and drop off.

To harvest, cut the leaves off and let them dry on a flat surface. Trim the
leaf down to the buds and hang the buds to dry for about a week. This part can
get fairly stinky so you may need ventilation to the outside, or a room
deodorizer. For faster results use a microwave oven.

---[ author! : trooper and nukepaste                                      ]---
==============================================================================
NukePaste had wanted to dump his shitty MAC for an IBM system for several
months. Every day he had worked after school, in a Block Mason job, for a
bunch of dicks; He wanted to save enough cash and buy the system he had been
looking forward to all year. Finally, after suffering a severe concussion,
working till his fingers had become bloody stumps, and living through 10 near
death experiences, he happened upon an ad for a P-133 IBM in the newspaper. It
was placed by a guy named Good Time Josh at 602-992-9611.

NukePaste called Josh on the phone and waited about ten minutes for him to
finish whatever he was doing in the bathroom. (Apparently Josh had left the
water running and couldn't hear his mom yelling at him.) Eventually Josh made
his way to the phone and in his usual lispy, faggot tone voice, he said
"Sssir. Sthorry to keep you waithing. I wasth in the basthroom." Josh then
described what he did in the bathroom, rather mumbled, which made NukePaste
sick to his stomach. He was then put on hold again while Josh could wiped the
vaseline off his right hand, and on the phone.

NukePaste, now annoyed, was about to hang up when Josh got back on and said,
"Ok, I'm back. Hehehe. I wasph a liwwtle messhy. Now you want to sphee my
P-133?" NukePaste replied, reluctantly, "YES!@#" After several more minutes
they had worked out a time for NukePaste to go over to Good Time Josh's house
and see the system for sale.

Here's the fast facts of what had happened:

Josh said for 600 Bucks (which happened to be all the cash NukePaste had), he
would sell the system. NukePaste wanted to verify that the system had all the
internal components that Josh had claimed was in it. Josh laid some bullshit
story on him that it did have everything that he said it had. But he wouldn't
open the case because he said that the system had such a high grade
motherboard and other components, which made it extremely dangerous to expose
them to the outside world. He also implied that he did not want to be
responsible for the damage caused by electrical shock due to improperly
grounded wires. NukePaste, at the time, did not know anything about the way
IBMs worked; All he had been exposed to was a MAC. Besides, the deal was so
great he didn't want to pass it up. NukePaste bought the system.

A week passed and NukePaste had found that his system was, in fact, a piece of
shit. He had had nothing but problems with it. For example, the sound card
would not work in Windows. The video card would always lock up in Windows and
never show color in DOS. The CD-ROM was slow and made horrible noises when it
ran; It didn't even have a geared CD Drawer. (It was the type with a release
similar to an A: or B: drive.) The system was not at all like Good Time Josh
had claimed it to be.

Nukepaste called Josh several times after the color in DOS was un-fixable, the
CD-ROM drive was eating CDs, and WIN95 kept locking up. Nothing was working
right. The computer would randomly reset if the case was bumped even slightly.
As a last resort, NukePaste brought the computer to Trooper.

The first thing Trooper did was ask if NukePaste had any documentation for
the WIN95 crap that was being displayed on screen. He said no. Trooper then
asked Nukepaste to fill him in on the entire situation. After he had told the
sob story, Trooper, attempting to be sincere, said "Sorry man, that Josh Dude
really fucked you BAD."

Apparently, Josh had Pirated a network copy of WIN95. The settings in the
config looked like a server setup, but with no work stations. The color in DOS
was distorted because he had jammed in a shitty S-3 Video Card. Josh had also
said that the system was a P-133; He put a 133 clock display on the case to
fool NukePaste into believing that the system was a Pentium.

Trooper took the computer apart and examined the mother board. It was a
non-PCI with a 486DX4-120 CPU. It was not a P-133 like Josh had said it was.
NukePaste had been fucked royally.

After Trooper's great discovery, several calls were made to Josh. NukePaste
continually demanded that Josh fix each problem that the computer had. Josh,
being the slimy piece of shit he is, blew NukePaste off with the usual "Well
you owned a MAC before this. You just don't know what you are doing.." As a
last resort, NukePaste got his parent's involved and forced Josh to fix the
system. All Josh fixed was the case so the computer wouldn't reboot when the
wind blew.

[--Enter Trooper--]

I tore the bitch apart and found the video card. It was not even supported by
WIN95. The copy of WIN95 was pirated off some network server. (Probably from
whatever special-ed school Josh goes to.) And the CD-ROM was a pile of shit,
the HD was used, the mother board was a piece of shit (VESA/ISA), and the CPU
was a 120.

Both NukePaste and I called Good Time Josh at 602-992-9611 once again. Of
course we had to wait at least 20 minutes for Josh to get out of the bathroom.
I was surprised that he was not happy to hear from me, since it was only 11:30
or so at night.

I explained to him that WIN95 was pirated. He tried to tell me that it was not
pirated, and in fact, was a licensed copy. And I said "Licensed to who? You
have manuals for it? Do you? Do you have any manuals for the other *new* parts
in the computer?" Josh said no.

Josh tried to get upset with the accusations. In retaliation, I offered to
give the SPA a call, and let Josh explain how a pirated copy of Windows 95 had
appeared on NukePaste's computer. After an annoying conversation, (Josh
continually dropped the phone and kept complaining about the vaseline on it.)
he agreed to exchange the 120DX4-120 for the P-133 CPU.

While on the phone with Josh, I had forgotten to ask him about the video card.
But it was not one of my main concerns at that moment. The CPU was the most
important at the time; And besides, how was I supposed to know that Josh would
still try to cheat NukePaste out of a fair deal?

Josh did bring over a new CPU to NukePaste. Except, instead of a P-133, it was
an AMD-133. NukePaste kicked Josh out the door and plugged the new chip in.
It didn't work. Josh had tricked us again. The fucker must had known that the
motherboard only went to 120 on the clock setting. 

We finally said fuck it and decided not to let Josh come back over again and
fix it; I didn't want to wipe slime off my doornob anymore. Besides, he didn't
seem willing enough to visit us anyway. So, we ended up having a new
motherboard, a new video card, and a new os for the system--about 200 bucks.

If NukePaste had planned on spending 800+ dollars on new system, he would have
bought an 800+ dollar system. He is still stuck with the 14" blurry monitor
and can't afford another until the Block Masons get off un-employment and hire
him again. We can all thank Good Time Josh for the mess he has created. If you
would like to get fucked over hard on a computer deal, call the best
g0atfucker in the world: Josh @ 602-992-9611.

He says he builds computers for extra money all the time. So I am sure all the
fellow readers of CDS will be HAPPY to get a "quote" from him...

==============================================================================
This is a text on how to steal cable without actually building a descrambler.
Everyone, at least at one point in time, has either read about, or attempted
to build a descrambler that allows you to have every channel; Including 
pay-per-view. If you do not want to use this method of stealing cable, then
order a descrambler from your local radio shack.

First, you need to locate your cable junction box. It should be between your
house and your neighbor's house. It will look like a colored post. PLEASE
PLEASE PLEASE make sure that it is in fact your cable box, and not your
electric box, or you will be transferred a sizeable voltage when it is opened.
Examine the box for any type of lock. If there is a lock simply break it off
with a small hammer. Here is a diagram of what the cable junction box should
look like:

                /====================\  
                |                    |  There are going to be wires and other
                | T  T  ~  T    T   T|  annoying obstacles that will attempt
                | T  T    T    T   T |  to keep you from finishing your task.
                | T  T ~   T    T    |  Simply pull out the tubes and ignore
                | T  T    T    T   T |  everything else that remains. (Please
                | T  T  ~  T    T   T|  note that some models may differ.)
                | T  T  ~  T    T    |
                | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ |  
                |    ~  ~    ~    ~  |  T = Tubes
                |  ~      ~     ~    |

                |    ~     ~     ~   |  ~ = Wires
                \====================/


Second, pull out every tube that is in the box. Don't forget to save the tubes
either. If the cable guy happens to come back and sees what you have done to
his precious tubes, he will take your cable away. To avoid a situation such as
this, call up your local cable company and ask when they plan to service your
area. If your cable company seems to be the type that services your area
regularly, take all the tubes out of your neighborhood's boxes. Even though
this illegal, no one is going to care about getting free cable. (Except for
Mike Dietz.)

If you have any questions or comments, I can be reached at:

This is a fun and easy way to get free cable. Enjoy!

Here are a few fun ideas that you could do to your "friend's" pool. First of
all, the only thing you need to know is what a pool pump looks like; For this
information, please refer to another text before continuing.

Second, dress casual for the occasion (preferably in black). Take a nice
little walk over to your "friend's" house. (This would be the friend's house
with the pool that looks like fun.) Once at the pump, simply switch the two
wires located on the back, + and -. Then wait until the pump turns on and
KABOOOOOOMMM!!!! It is quite beautiful.

If you would still like to have a little fun, but don't want the damage,
switch the pump to "backwash" while the pump is off. Once you have
accomplished this, turn the pump back on and get the hell out of there. If you
go back the next day you'll hear your friend say, "Hey where the !@#$! is all
my water?!?"

Or, if you do want permanent damage but no explosion, shut the valves of the
pool off; There are two, one goes to the main drain and the other goes to the
filter. The pump has to take in water, so when there is no water... you get
the idea.

---

I hope you enjoy trying these out on all of your good "friends". I'll make
sure and try to write some more shitty anarchy for the next issue of CDS.
Later guys.

BTW--If you're wondering where I get reference to most of this info, it comes
from the Anarchist Cookbook. If you get into trouble for doing any of this,
it's your own fault; CDS and myself are not responsible for your actions.

to all the readers of cds, i'd just like to say that i had a fun time putting
this issue together. and i'm very sure you had a fun time reading it.

but there are always ways to improve cds. at the moment i code the emag and
edit the zine. i would appreciate any help that is offered towards either
editing or coding. (of course it's not needed, but i have a life and don't
want to spend it working on this thing. <cough>)

that's about it. mike dietz is still trying to shut us down, uncle john is
still teaching ascii, and chris nowak is a big time courier for risc. some
things will never change...
