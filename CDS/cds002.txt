=[who we are/contacting us]===================================================

this is the second issue of cds. putting this out basically means that cds is
not a lame little zine, or a dead one for that matter. the real question that
everyone wants to know is "why haven't you sent me your article for this
issue?!" what's that you say? you don't know how to send me your article?
ahhh well this is what you do. dial up the support bbs at:

 the shadow of cyberia
 602-451-8564
 [the nup isn't sabotage]

and login as a new user. make sure you tell me where you got the number and
what your intentions are. (for example if you want to format my h/d please
include "hey, i want to format your h/d!" in the new user application
letter.)

<insert sound of trumpets here>

this may come to a shock to most of you, but it's true. i finally got a
permanent, legal, legitimate, free, and very easy to use e-mail address. now
you can send me your articles via the information super highway. wow, what a
deal. and it doesn't even cost me a penny. my new e-mail address is:

sirbob@juno.com

and as always you can look for me in channel #cds on the irc. i usually use
the handle _cs_ when i am not waging war on a lame channel or user. (if you
suspect me to be waging war look for either "sdkfjas1204jklf" or
"32fjdnzvcxmhskjh" on channel #fkdsjf)

so get off your butt and write up an article. what are you waiting for? why
are you still reading this? i thought i told you to get off your lazy butt
and start on that article?! ahhh oh well, never mind.


=[welcome back!@]=============================================================

thanks for checking out another great issue of children of a dying sun. the
good news is i finally got around to writing an executable emag. (if you are
reading this with a text editor, shame, shame, go get the emag.) the bad news
is we lost an author. this is how the story goes:

it was a perfect scheme. a7, h0und (formerly known as knightmare), purifier,
and i would sneak into mr. park's back yard and beige box our way to a tokyo
sex hot line. i brought the beige box, a7 brought the ride, h0und brought
the beer, and purifier brought the flash light.

when my watched showed 2:30am we hopped over mr. park's old picket fence,
crawled through his crab grass yard, and snuck up to his little phone box
which was never locked.

i leisurely took out my beige box and hooked it up. while i was doing that a7
and hound were busily unloading the picnic basket and handing out the beer.
purifier stood watch for the grumpy mr. park.

we talked for about an hour until the phone line suddenly died. mr. park
emerged from behind a nearby bush and clubbed purifier over the head with a
shovel.

mr. park turned to me and said, "my nmea is thdrbolt! whta are yuo kids donig
heer?"

there was a moment of silence until a7 turned to me and yelled "run fer your
life!" we all took off in opposite directions leaving purifier and mr. park
behind. 

the next night we went back to mr. park's to look for purifier. he had not
been seen since he was clubbed on the head. all we could locate was the shovel
which was stuck into a pile of new dug earth.

we then saw mr. park step outside from behind his wooden door and say "ha
ha ha ha. thsi wil tecah yuo braty kids not ot mess with thndrbolt!"

...

ok, my name is not steven king and that is not what really happened. actually
the truth is, purifier just disappeared. he hasn't called my board in over a
month and a half. if you know where he is then please either call me or the
phoenix police so we can call off the search.

there was also another loss to the cds team. my chair broke and had to be
replaced. (it was the one that i sit in when i use my computer.) the funeral
was on a sunday and burial was the following day. if you would like to
support 'the people who had their chairs break foundation' please send all
donations to:

=[special thanks]=============================================================

as always this section is set aside for the people who have helped either me
or cds.

 - firelord for drawing the cds logo.

 - shadowlight for helping with the emag. (who else is gonna do the math?)

 - anyone who bought my ansi this month.

 - the at&t operator who gives me free ld phone calls. (no joke.)

 - tommy the cat

 - all the readers of cds


=[hackerz of zix owh tew]================================================[cs]=

the last two months were hectic. i definitely needed a break from calling the
hpav/art boards of 602, and decided to dial up a few of the more popular pd
boards in the shareware scene.

the first board i called had horrible ansi and was obviously dedicated to
being lame. while i was on, one of the ops logged onto node 2 and paged me
from the teleconference. in the teleconference i chatted with the op (known
as pd_lamer) for only a short amount time. (but it was enough to make me
laugh.)

Welcome to Teleconferencing.  Type /? for help or /Q to quit.
You are now in conference room 1
The Current Topic is: Main

There is 1 other person present.

cs      :yes?
pd_lamer:Yur hot keys were on.. thats aprob
cs      :hmm. you should setup rg so it'll accept that too. anyway what do
         you need?
pd_lamer:Well i heard that max said your concerned about us getting hacked
         and your information leaking?
cs      :yeah
pd_lamer:Well there is only 1 way we can be hacked.. and well we would have
         to be crashed, and thats not even hacking
pd_lamer:I know how to hack, give me any board and i can take it down
         within 3 weeks
cs      :alright. call 451-8598.
pd_lamer:What bbs is that to?
cs      :it is to the 5th dimension.
pd_lamer:What software they run?
cs      :they run remote access.
pd_lamer:i can get there users.dat file (or whatever RA uses..)
pd_lamer:There is no way for this board to get hacked unless some smartass
         uploads a ANSI bomb and even then i have someone that scans for
         those
cs      :what could an ansi bomb do?
pd_lamer:it will do whatever you tell it to do.. they arnt very common..
         lets keep it that way, they are REALLY dangergous..
cs      :no they are not. all they do is remap the keyboard. they are only
         as dangerous as you make them.
pd_lamer:Yes well, i made one that reformats your HD to 360k..
pd_lamer:Hahahah
cs      :man that won't happen. formatting a h/d to 360k? format has
         safety guards for that kind of stuff.
pd_lamer:now thats easy
pd_lamer:FORMAT /F:360 /V:hacked /U
cs      :that's nice for a disk.
pd_lamer:Well trust me, there is no way anyone could get any information
         from our user files
cs      :that's nice... to tell you the truth, i feel very safe now.
pd_lamer:Format C: /F:360 /V:hacked /U
pd_lamer:doh
pd_lamer:heh
cs      :so what boards are you on?
pd_lamer:How do you think someone could hack us..
pd_lamer:I prefer not to say.. i dont like letting everyone know who/where
         i am
cs      :then how do you expect people to do that here?
pd_lamer:do what here.. hack?
cs      :no, give out personal information.
pd_lamer:There is way to be hacked unless someone throws an ansi bomb at
         us (and i have something that checks for those)
pd_lamer:The only way for that is through the archive menu
cs      :oh really? and that has been fixed?
pd_lamer:And i deleted that
pd_lamer:well why dont you try real qwk
cs      :no i believe you.
pd_lamer:trust me, i program, i make virii, i own a software company, i
         know renegade..
cs      :you make virii? what kind? you know assembler?
pd_lamer:Im learning assembly..
cs      :what language do you write your virii in then?
pd_lamer:Assembly, iv done some trojans in basic before
pd_lamer:I made a virus that blows up your processer
pd_lamer:its 4 bytes
pd_lamer:and pascal
cs      :wow you must be awesome!
pd_lamer:MOV AUX,AUX
cs      :what does that do?
pd_lamer:thatll take a register near the center of a 486 chip and move its
         value on top of itself, loop that and boom
cs      :neato!
pd_lamer:I have many more..
pd_lamer:But i prefer not to get into them...
cs      :where do you get all your stuff?
pd_lamer:What do you mean by get?
pd_lamer:I make most of my stuff
cs      :so you are not on any hacking boards?
pd_lamer:I have connections..
cs      :hey man! hook me up please!
pd_lamer:out of state ones
pd_lamer:Its not to smart to be on h/p phreaking boards locally
cs      :why?
pd_lamer:Because then they have all of your information.. and if you try
         to crash em..
cs      :ohh. that would suck. what is phreaking?
pd_lamer:I mean, if someone logged on here, and they were out of state and
         tried to crash me i wouldnt care as much as if it was somone
         locally.
pd_lamer:Phreaking is like phone fraud
cs      :how do you phreak?
pd_lamer:There are many ways..
cs      :like what?
pd_lamer:You can use different tones (e.i. Red box, black box, blue box
         etc) Or you can hack the phone
cs      :wow that's amazing.
cs      :do you have hacking text files so i can learn?
pd_lamer:well i need to go..
pd_lamer:sorry

[ pd_lamer has disconnected on node 2 ]
[ pd_lamer has left the room. ]


unfortunately the pd_lamer logged off the bbs before i got a chance to really
get some information out of him. and to think, he could of shown us how to
make free phone calls with a comb.

now you are probably wondering "what in the world is an ansi bomb?" and i'm
sure professor bob will be more than happy to tell us...

"hey professor bob, the readers of cds want to know what an ansi bomb is. can
you help us out?"

"ansi bombs, eh? what do yew bunch ah punks want an ansi bomb fer?!"

"professor bob, we want to become elite like the rest of the public domain."

"yew damn bbsing kids. ahh tha hell with ya. this is how yew do it. with one
ansi command yew can remap a key on tha keyboard to dew whatever yew want."

"can you show us an example?!"

"what are yew, stupid?! all yew do is put tha ascii value of tha key yew want
ta change and then another ascii value er string that will replace it. like
this:

[13;"mike dietz's girlfriend popped! "p

and then yew send that to tha ansi.sys driver and kaboom.

c:\elite\cds\>type ansibomb.ans[enter]

now don't be ah lamuh and ferget yer ascii chart. tha big letter a = 65, tha
little letter a = 97, and whatever. figger it out fer yerself."

"wow professor bob, that's wonderful. what else can you teach us?"

"go away, watcha wanna do, kill an old man? come back next issew and maybe
i'll teech yew bunch ah punks how to make netmail bombs ta send to yer friends
and relatives."

"thanks professor bob!"

according to professor bob that's how you make ansi bombs. professor bob was
kind enough to give us an ansi bomb to include in this archive. make sure
your ansi.sys driver is loaded, go to dos, and then enter the command "type
ansibomb.ans" (make sure you are in the same directory as the ansi bomb
stupid.)

that ansi bomb is copyrighted so you better not use it for your devilish
purposes. if you would like an ansi bomb construction kit, get in touch with
me and i might send you the kit that i wrote. (please only bother me about it
if your name is mike dietz. you're an elite hacker--figure it out.)

after reading all that, and assuming your not asleep yet, i'll show you the
next lamer that i ran across. his name is starman and he is about as smart as
mike dietz.

the first thing starman did was post his pd ansi adds on an hpav/warez board
and ask for users to call his board. then he had the nerve to tell me i had
no idea what i was talking about.

 ALot better than you can ever do.. And if any of you fucking warez fanatics

There are alot more non warez people than warez people.. I do have warez
though.. And I do pirate... So fuck off.. Knights Realm.. hmm.. that don't
sound gay.. SOunds like RPG, Fantasy.. Maybe you are just too fucking stupid 
to know what a knights is..

Starman

[i don't ever plan on running a bbs. that's what you can think atleast.]


and finally for the grand finnale, the lamest person on the face of the planet
has been located. so call off the search--he has been identified. his name is
jamie brown and he goes by the handle of wizzard. (\/\/izard) 

once i talked to wizzard voice on the phone. he was bragging to me how he
used to run a bbs but couldn't remember the name or the software. i asked him
to describe the software.


wizzard :it's that popular program that everyone runs.. you know, it has an
         r in it.
cs      :do you mean renegade?
wizzard :yeah! that's it.
cs      :how many users did it have?
wizzard :alot, but i forgot how many.
cs      :is it still up?
wizzard :no i took it down because i didn't like it.
cs      :oh, so what was on it?
wizzard :well i would load up this program called thedraw, and using the ascii
         programming language make some files that would display information
         about a user when they saw it on the bbs.
cs      :what? ascii a programming language?
wizzard :yeah it is. here, go to dos and type in alt-158. that's how you
         program.
cs      :man you're crazy. do you even know what ascii stands for?!
wizzard :no... not "ascii" it's pronounced "asc 2", but i have heard it both
         ways. but what does it mean?
cs      :it stands for 'american standard code for information interchange.'
         where does it say 'programming language' in ascii?
wizzard :well, it doesn't, but it is a programming language... i'm sure, i've
         been programming in ascii for a long time. and i'm learning ansi.
cs      :that is about the stupidest thing i have ever heard.
wizzard :my dad told me it was a programming language, and he knows alot about
         hacking.
cs      :so you want to be a hacker?
wizzard :i'm learning. some day i will be as good as zero cool. you saw that
         movie right? hackers...
cs      :are you some kind of retard? man, first you have to understand that
         ascii and ansi are not programming languages.
wizzard :no! they are. i'll just have to type up a little program sometime
         and send it to you.
cs      :what kind of program?
wizzard :it shows the name of the person on the bbs.
cs      :you mean %un?
wizzard :yeah.
cs      :that's an mci code.
wizzard :well it's still a programming language.
cs      :man, shut up. <click>


and that was about all i could stand. it was the wierdest conversation i have
ever had in my entire life. then about a month later *he* calls me up. (i
guess he found out my number from a friend that knows my brother. or something
like that?)


wizzard :so i hear you have been calling me a queer and making fun of me
         behind my back!?
cs      :no actually i was going to call you up and tell you but i was taking
         a crap.
wizzard :well don't be calling me a queer. i have a girl friend!!!!
cs      :that doesn't mean you're not a faggot. hold on, i gotta take another
         crap...

[ten minutes pass. i go and watch a little tv and forget about wizzard. then
i get ready to make a few prank calls and find my phone off the hook.]

cs      :jeeeezus. you're still on here? hang up, i gotta prank someone.
wizzard :no, just stop calling me a queer. that's the only reason i called.
cs      :uhh but you are a queer.
wizzard :why would a queer have a girl friend?
cs      :i thought we already went over this. <click>


when i hung up with him i was so annoyed i called up his favorite bbs and
logged in with his password 'noisulli' to make him look like a total idiot.
here is a capture of what he said, errrr i said.

  \/\/


isn't that disgusting? what a queer... can you believe he had the nerve to
post that? 

wizzard wants you to call him and have some phone sex. he also wants to teach
you how to program in ansi and ascii. his phone number 602-788-9796. (but you
didn't get that from me.)


=[the hacker profile]=================================================[satan]=

my article on hackerz of zix owh tew. this is between satan and a "hacker"
that goes to his school.

S> 98 MEGS ON 7 DISKS!?!?!?!
T> have you ever heard of data compression?
S> umm, yeh, but how do ya hack?
T> i call up the place and break into shit and change it.
S> how?
T> i cant tell you.
S> have you ever read 3600? [yes, 3600.]
T> never heard of it.
S> your a hacker and you don't reed 3600!!
T> i guess so?
S> what did you do with the police station?
T> i changed shit for my friends.
S> like...?
T> their records.
S> ohh, what kind of system do they have?
T> a bbs.
S> hmmm, you said you programmed rite?
T> yes.
S> do you know how to program in zupah haquer?
T> yes.

T> ummmmmm....
S> well, how do i display text on the screen?
T> with 'display.'
S> how do i make a tone?
T> 'tone.'
S> oh, ok. so how do you hack passwords? [this is the funny part.]
T> i take part of Windows 95, Norton Utilities, and a few games. then i copy
   them into one big file and run it...and it breaks the password.
S> [i try not to laugh.] damn, you're good, can you teach me how to hack?
T> nope sorry.
S> tyson, can i tell you something?
T> what
S> yer fulla shit!


then satan ran across another lamer, named chris.

[s=satan, c=chris]

S> i have heard that you are a hacker?
C> yes i am.
S> what have you hacked?
C> i can't tell you.
S> hmm, can you teach me to hack?
C> sure, stay after school tomorrow.
S> ok.

[he never showed up. this is the next day...]

S> you never showed.
C> sorry.
S> why?
C> i was working, but i know someone that you need to meet. he lives in 
C> scottsdale. 
S> thats good, now how am i gonna meet him?
C> when he comes up to my place.
S> and when will that be?
C> soon.

[he never told me about him ever again. here is the final part of the chris
story.]

S> so whats up?
C> nuthin.
S> do you have a war dialer?
C> yes.
S> well, how big is it?
C> about this big...[he shows me with his hands stretched apart from each
   other, like it is a physical size.]
S> wow!

that just goes to show what the "hacker" can do to you and your computer. be
careful boys and girls, it's getting scary.


=[how to crash a renegade bbs]===========================================[cs]=

we all know they are out there, charging users to play door games and download
shareware. they give you 30 minutes a day and a 1 to 10 upload/download ratio.
what am i talking about? ahhh nothing other than the default renegade bbs.
what's worse than a default renegade bbs? wildcat on thndrbolt's computer.

this is an informational text on how to successfully crash a renegade bbs.
this will work 100% of the time and will most likely be the easiest way to
get back at a sysop who has been an asshole to you. assuming you have no
hacking knowledge, read on.

well it looks like mike dietz put his board up again. that guy will never
learn. what's worse is he used nothing but thedraw fonts for his ansi pics,
and took down front door. (so we can't send him netmail bombs.)

it is time to take down the 5th dimension permanetly. follow these simple
steps and you can become a renegade bbs crasher too.

[please ignore the fact that mike dietz is running an ra bbs, and not a
renegade bbs.]

step 1
------
as usual mike dietz has posted his vacation plan on his bbs.

Date: 5:32 pm  Tue Jun 18, 1996        Number : 5 of 6
From: Mike Dietz                       Base   : Elite Talk
To  : All                              Refer #: None
Subj: I'm going on vacation. TTYL.     Replies: None
Stat: Normal                           Origin : Local

I'm going on vacation again everyone. I'm leaving the 20th and getting back
July 4th. (Just in time for the 4th of July, eh?) I left my house key under 
the doormat for the maid, so if she forgets where it is, someone please tell
her. There will be absolutely no one home during my vacation as my parents
are already in Waco, Texas waiting for me. The neighbors are also on vacation
so i doubt they will be any help maintaining this BBS. Enjoy yourself and
keep those games going!

TTYL,

Mike Dietz
SysOp of THE 5th DiMENSiON


now that you know when he is going to be gone, you are about to begin your
quest of destruction.


step 2
------
the next thing you will need to do is go to your local hardware store and
buy the biggest hammer you can find. crowbars and other large, heavy objects
will work also.


step 3
------
now that mike has left for vacation, and you can get into his house, go to
his computer and begin crashing his bbs. make sure you hit his monitor and
case several times and then start on the internal hardware. usually when the
crashing begins you will see sparks fly into the air. ignore those, they are
usually signs that the bbs is being destroyed.

keep crashing the bbs until either (1) the maid comes to clean the house, or
(2) your hammer breaks.

when you are done crashing the renegade bbs, pick up the pieces and carefully
put them back onto his desk. this will make it easier for the maid vacuum the
floor.


step 4
------
go back to your computer, call the 5th dimension, and make sure it doesn't
answer. if it does then repeat step 3 until the bbs stops answering.


step 5
------
return the hammer to the hardware store and destroy all evidence. 


i sure hope mike has learned his lesson this time. i'm tired of crashing his
bbs.


=[irc cops are gay]===================================================[h0und]=

well, most of them anyway. i had a rather interesting experience around 12:30
am on thursday, july 4th. (oh, independence day. big fucko.) anyway. i was
just a little bored with the usual irc drivel that early morning, so i loaded
up ircuzi.irc and nova.irc (2 of the best warscripts i know of) and went to
raise hell.

turns out some guy in #oldwarez (going by norm) wanted to do the same. we
agreed we would meet in #castle, and try to get an army of 20-30 warscripters
to go take over a lame channel (i think it was #teen). well, some ass named
deeptrout came onto #castle and said "OP ME WITHIN THE NEXT 10 SECONDS OR I
WILL GO WARN #TEEN." of course, i replied with a cheery "/mode #castle +b
deeptrout". at this time we only had about 5 people, so i went and advertised
the expedition in #hack. i was then killed by an ircop named tersiann,
something about conspiring to take over a channel. so i guess ircops are in
#hack, but invisible, all of the time. food for thought.

anyway. i relogged, and went back into #castle. tersiann and another lamer
ircop named piker had the channel. i as then got killed by piker with the
reason being "k-line this lamer please." i relogged one more time, and told
them not to kill me again. because i wanted to talk. tersiann tells me he saw
my little add in #hack. i said "odd, i didn't see your name when i joined..."
and he made up some dumb excuse about me missing it. sure.

tersi and piker started telling me how i shouldn't be allowed on irc is i am
going to abuse the privilege, and that i have too much time on my hands. well,
it *is* midnight, what else am i gonna do? go meet friends somewhere? idiots.
piker threatened to have me banned from irc. hahahahahaha. "well, piker, i'll
just have to get another account." he seemed to think this was enough to bust
me until i drop-kicked his ass back into the real world. "i could've meant i'd
go purchase one from another isp." he shut up for the time being. and about
having my puter confiscated. he seemed to think that me using a warscript
would warrant a raid. no, that *saying i was going to* use a script was enough
to warrant a raid. i set him straight again.

they went into some bullshit story about how they could get my info. "well,
you don't know that the info on this account is real." then tersi, the bigger
idiot, took over, saying that primenet logs every data connection with block-
proof call identification. even if they did, how would he get the info? and
even if he could, what are the feds gonna do? slap me on the wrist for using
an irc script they don't like? piker then said he needed to go to sleep. sure.
i was later killed by tersiann, a feeble attempt to get rid of me. any other
/msgs to him were responded to with "go away."

so, if you're ever on the irc, /msg one/both of them. tell them specters said
hi.


=[break into any car with just wire cutters!]=================[brain smasher]=

so you've finally decided to break into that assholes car? maybe that person
is a lame jock who pumps his stereo loud while driving by school? maybe it's
those lame asses who play distorted bass in the parking lot during lunch
break? well now you can, and all you need for equipment is wire cutters. by
now you must be saying "but brain smasher how do we do this?" the answer is
simple. i will first tell you a couple of rules to thieving that you must
follow to become a good thief.
        
 1. always wear dark colored clothing. (it's obvious isn't it?)
        
 2. get acquainted with the neighborhood.  drive around before you do the hit.
    look for other ways to get outta the neighborhood. find good hiding
    places.

 3. this will be the most important one of all: never go back!!!

 4. if you get chased, hop over walls into people's back yards, even hide in
    trash cans. or if you are good enough open up man hole covers in the 
    middle of the street and hide in there. (make sure you close the cover up
    also.

the next thing you should do is purchase, or find one of those cable guys or
phone guys work trucks and steal a pair, of GOOD QUALITY wire cutters. i can't
stress that enough. a good pair will not flex under pressure as you are
pushing them together. (craftsman makes a great pair.)

the next step is to find out where the person lives (figure it out). then
maybe you might want to check out his car at school to find out where
everything is. for example, where are his amps located? in the trunk? then
were is the trunk release? with your so called research done you can begin
your deed of destruction.

assuming he doesn't park in the garage, you are in good luck. if he has an
alarm don't worry about it, sometimes the alarms suck and you can get past
them. for example, lets say he has a shock sensor. well then don't hit the
fucking car. shock sensors need a hard shock for them to go off--not a rocking
motion. so if you can get into his car without 'shocking it', you will be
fine.

now look at his windows and find a place on the car where you can see the end
of the window. for example, on any late model camaro just examine the top of
the door. notice how there is no window jam for the window to slide into at
the top of the car? on most cars there is a jam that the window slides up into
when the window is rolled up, but on a camaro or firebird, the window goes up
and presses against a piece of weather stripping.

              ---------------------
              -                    -
              -      window         -
              -                      -
              -                       -
              ==========================
              =                         =
              =                          =
              =       door               =
              =                          =
              ============================

the - indicates that there is no window track or jam that the window goes into
at the top but in this illustration there is:

              =====================
              =                    =
              =                     =
              =--------------\       =
              =       window  \- - -  = 
              ==========================
              =                         =
              =                          =
              =       door               =
              =                          =
              ============================

now with that information you are ready. take the wire cutters and stick one
part of the jaw against the top part of the weather stripping, and push it
behind the glass. you might have to cut away some weather stripping to get
half the wire cutter in there. take some duct tape and rip off two pieces
that cover the whole window and stick them in an x across the glass. what
this does is when the windows cracks or spiders, the little shards of glass
wont get on the seat and cut up your knees.

              ---------------------
              -     xx      xx     -
   window-->  -       xx  xx        -
              -         xx  <------------Duct tape
              -      xx   xx          -
              ==========================
              =                         =
              =                          =
              =       door               =
              =                          =
              ============================

now just simply use both hands and squeeze the shit outta the window. if it
still doesn't break then you are a pussy and shouldn't do this anyway. it
might also help if you hold the cutters at any angle so the outside jaws are
only holding the window at the tip. now when squeezing (hard) try to wiggle
the cutters back and forth, left and right, but not too much since the cutters
need to have equal pressure on both sides.

now you're in and can enjoy a new stereo system.

ball's and shaft


=[fun at summer school]===============================================[h0und]=

summer school, well, sucks. just when i'm looking forward to some time off,
"your son has 24 unexcused absences in his first period class this year, he
will have to report to summer school." dammit. now, 4 hours a day, i'm stuck
at school. so i did what any reasonable anarchist would do, started to screw
the school over.

after recruiting 4 other students just as pissed as me, we first set out to
dismantle the school with screwdrivers. the second day of summer school,
things started falling apart. desks and teachers' chairs were collapsing when
sat in. we also unscrewed the hinges on the door to the staff lounge, injuring
the assistant principal.

aside from 4 hours of math each day, my parents insisted i take a bullshit
computer class for another hour. these teachers are *sad*. they don't know how
to do anything outside of windows, and i doubt any of them have ever seen the
inside of a pc. anyway, i brought my famous "200-in-1" disk to the computer lab
the third day. (200 virii on one disk, with a batch file that executes them
all.) i managed to infect 27 out of 35 computers. something like 10 have had
their fat wiped, others experienced random slowdowns and lockups.

now, mr. burrell (computer "guru") came to me with a problem. teachers were
sending him email on the staff's network, asking him computer questions he
couldn't answer. i, of course, volunteered to answer them for him. the first
was from mrs. baldwin, my bitch english teacher of 2 semesters. "i can't seem
to save anything to my computer disk, do you know what's wrong?" i then
remembered how i had served several hours of detention because of that whore.
i replied, asking her if she had any important files on the disk. "yes, i have
all of my students' grades on here." i told her, "your problems are coming
from electromagnetic fields coming from the asteroid belt, corporations all
over the world are having trouble. these fields can also erase the contents of
disks. to protect them, you can stack magnets on top of any disks you use.
electromagnetic fields hate that."

i had randy, one of my "team members", stick a dead fish into a locker and
super-glue it shut. this cleared out the social studies department for two
days, until they found out what the awful stench was. they had to punch
through the floor of the locker above the fish and remove it that way.

the same day, we all brought lighters and fluid to school, and started several
small fires each hour. the fire department sent an engine down 5 times that
day. however, each time, the fire was out before they got there. false alarms
result in fines, and our little escapade had cost the school several hundred
dollars.

there's an assembly this upcoming monday, we plan on ruining it by putting
smoke/stink bombs in the auditorium's ventilation system. stay tuned.


=[contact explosives]=========================================================

toolman managed to dig this up for the faithful readers of cds. enjoy.

Excerpt From rec.pyrotechnics.faq
It would be very handy to have the FAQ in it's entirety before creating this
substance.

CONTACT EXPLOSIVE

Nitrogen Tri-Iodide is a very unstable compound that decomposes
explosively with the slightest provocation. It is too unstable to have
any practical uses, but is often made for its novelty value.  Some books
describe uses for it in practical jokes etc. but in my experience it has
been far too unstable for this to be a feasible idea. Despite its common
name, the explosive compound is actually a complex between nitrogen
tri-iodide and ammonia, NI3.NH3 (nitrogen tri-iodide monamine).

Reagents:

Solid Iodine (I2)
Ammonia solution (NH4OH) - Use only pure, clear ammonia. Other solutions,
                           such as supermarket 'cloudy' ammonia, will not
                           give the desired product.


Place a few fine crystals of iodine in a filter paper. The best way to
make fine iodine crystals is to dissolve the iodine in a small quantity
of hot methanol (care: methanol is toxic and flammable. Heat on a steam
bath away from open flame. Use in a well-ventilated area.), and then pour
the solution into a container of ice-cold water. This will cause
extremely fine iodine crystals to precipitate out. Drain off the liquid
and wash the crystals with cold water. If this method is not possible,
crush the iodine as finely as possible.

Then filter ammonia through the iodine crystals. Use a small amount of
ammonia and refilter it, to reduce wastage. The smaller the pieces of
iodine the better the result, as more iodine will react if it has a
greater surface area. You will be able to recognize the NI3.NH3 by its
black colour, as opposed to the metallic purple of the iodine.

Reaction:       3I     +  5NH OH     --->  3NH I     +  NI .NH    +  5H O
                  2(s)       4  (aq)          4 (aq)      3   3(s)     2 (l)

When the NI3.NH3 decomposes it will leave brown or purple iodine stains.
These are difficult to remove normally, but can be removed with sodium
thiosulphate solution (photographic hypo). They will fade with time as
the iodine sublimes.


Safety aspects:

NI3.NH3: Despite the common misconception presented in many articles
         on NI3.NH3, it is NOT safe when wet. I have personally witnessed
         NI3.NH3 exploding while at the bottom of a 1000Ml plastic beaker
         full of water. NI3.NH3 can not be relied on not to decompose at
         any time. Even the action of air wafting past it can set it off.

         If you want to dispose of some NI3.NH3 once you have made it, it
         can be reacted safely with sodium hydroxide solution. NI3.NH3 is
         a potent high explosive, and should be treated with respect. Its
         power, instability and unpredictability require that only small
         batches be made. Do not make more than you can immediately use.
         Never attempt to store NI3.NH3.

         The detonation of NI3.NH3 releases iodine as a purple mist or
         vapour. This is toxic, so avoid breathing it. Toxicity data on
         NI3.NH3 is unknown, but I think it is safe to assume that eating
         or touching it would be a bad idea anyway.

Iodine:  Iodine sublimes easily at room temperature and is toxic -
         ingestion of 2-4g of iodine can be fatal. Make sure you are in a
         well-ventilated area, and avoid touching the iodine directly.

Ammonia: Again, use in a well-ventilated area as ammonia is not
         particularly pleasant to inhale. Ammonia is corrosive, so avoid
         skin contact, especially if using relatively concentrated
         solution. If skin contact occurs, wash off with water. Don't
         drink it.


=[satan's hacking story]==============================================[satan]=

well. i was sitting at my computer and on the irc. i was talking to some
friends of mine, and we were talking about this guy on #drugs who had banned
my friend. so, i said that i would goto that channel and see what was up. i
started talking to everyone, and then some guy (who will reamain anonymous)
started making fun of me. so i started to make fun of him back. and then he
kicked me off. big deal. i went back, and then he banned me. so, i did a
/whois on him. i found out that his net provider was spook.com. hmmmm. i
messaged him something like "kiss yer net life good-bye." and he started
laughing at me. the fun begins.

i met up with another friend a few days later, from l0pht. on the irc, and we
started talking about telnet hacking, and basic net hacking. he asked me if i
had any telnet sites that i wanted to hack. i said no. then he asked me if i
could give him my password and login so he could hack my provider. then i
remebered my friend from irc :). so, i gave him the telnet site. and he went
to check it out. He told me that it was a linux system (i hadnt been on there
yet). and he started asking me questions on how to log in to the system. we
finally got in, and we immediatly hacked root. we used a telnet root hack that
is too long to explain. but it worked. he then coded a program that would keep
root on the account that i made. we went through the entire system and
discovered that the guy who was from irc was sysadm of the place. so we went
through and looked in his directery and found a bunch of 'sex with animal
pics.' (i wished i had captured it, but didnt at tha time.) then we went
through and wiped out some of his logs. (nothing big.) we just wanted to save
that account, so we could have something to fuck with later.

at one time while we were fucking around with it, we screwed something up, and
it logged him, and everyone else connected to his provider off. so, we started
laughing. and then we fixed it and logged off, to see if our login would work.
it did, and then we went back to irc to make fun of his animal pics.

not really alot of hacking done. but it was surely fun. later that night, me
and the same guy teamed up with some other dudes, and then we took over #drugs
and banned everyone who came back on. it was fun. we really fucked up that
guy. i encourage all of you to hack spook.com when you're bored.


=[how to get root]====================================================[satan]=

this hack is only valid for SunOS 386i/4.01 systems. this is the funniest and
coolest and easiest way to hack root. ok. are you ready?

 $ rlogin -n root

wow!@#! that wasnt hard! thats it. really. no password required. thats it.

i have talked to people who have used this and he said it werked. i have
never seen this system before, but i know they do exist.

um. thats it. easy huh? well, i told you, its the easiest way to hack root.

=[how to make hydrogen]=============================================[toolman]=

the principle needed here is very simple. 2H2O+energy -> H2 + O2

the energy used here is simple dc current. the problem is how to capture the
hydrogen so it can be used (burning it is fun...) but although its lighter
than air property is nice for reducing explosion hazards in comparison to
natural gas for example. this property makes it rather difficult to contain.
real scientists with lots of money use a hoffman's apparatus; but this should
work just as well.


materials needed:

a dc powerpack or battery (preferably a big one)
some wire, platinum is best but copper works too.
2 tall see through drinking cups (not glass)
3 ft of plastic tubing. 
a large non-metal pan
water
an ionic substance (preferably sulfuric acid, although table salt works, but
dillutes hydrogen or oxygen gases with chlorine gas.)

fill large pan to the top with water. add a very small amount (2 drops) of
sulfuric acid to the water. make sure the acid is dilluted evenly in the
water. place a drinking cup upside down in the pan under the water and insert
the tubing into the bottom of the cup and up into the air. suck on tubing
until as much air as possible is drawn from inside the cup and it sinks in
the pan. repeat process with other cup.

note: do not suck any of the water-acid solution into your mouth as sulfuric
acid (even dilluted this much) is not good for your body. if any of the
solution makes contact with your body wash it off with lots of water. if you
feel a burning sensation apply a baking soda-water paste to the afflicted
area.

cut the wire into two pieces and strip about 1in. of insulation from each end
of the wires. bend each wire so that one end will be under a cup and the other
will be sticking well out of the water. (each wire gets its own cup.) connect
one of the power supply wires to each of the wires going under the cups. when
power is applyed you will see bubbles come from each of the wires. the more
rapid bubbling is hydrogen and the less rapid bubbling is oxygen. if neither
wire is bubbling add more acid, a drop at a time, near the glass (but not on
the glass). use the tubing to siphon the water down to about 1/2 and inch from
the bottom of the pan so the glasses will not tip when they become full.


=[closing comments]======================================================[cs]=

that does it for issue two. i hope you enjoyed yourself. and if you got a
spare moment, write an article. it doesn't cost you anything. you might as
well join cds if you have nothing better to do.

special one time offer. mike dietz is selling his 386-25mhz packard bell for
food! we saw him wandering down the street with a sign that said:

"i will sell computer for food."

i guess he is very hungry.
