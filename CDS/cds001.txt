=[who we are/contacting us]===================================================

currently cds is very small but growing. (mostly because this is the first
issue.) if you would like to join cds, or would like to submit an article,
you can contact me (cyber shadow) at:

 the shadow of cyberia
 602-451-8564
 [the nup isn't sabotage]

unfortunately i have lost my email address, mostly due to the fact that i
never paid for it. so you'll have to be creative when you try contacting me.

the easiest way to send me your article is on the irc. look for either _cs_
or a7, or anyone else who is listed as a writer for this zine. unfortunately
i don't get on the irc much anymore so good luck.


=[goals]======================================================================

the bbs scene is slowly dying. although most people will disagree, it is a
fact of life. as the www, aol, and irc grow each year, bulletin boards become
smaller and smaller.

a new breed of modem users have discovered a whole different world while using
their modem, and actually have the nerve to quit their net surfing, for a few
hours, to call up your bbs!

i consider that lame.

now that i have gotten that out in the open, knowing it has nothing to do
with this zine, i will explain the goals of cds.

cds is a free publication of hacking, phreaking, anarchy, coding, modding,
and art material.

now you are probably saying "hey, that's great. everything i ever wanted all
rolled up into one!"

and you are absolutely right...it is great. and to make it even better send
cds your articles or thoughts to be published and plundered around the world.

just make sure you have something that is interesting and is a related topic.
don't pull a mike dietz and send me an article like this:

 How to Make Rice Krispies Treats

 Ingredients
 -----------

 1/4 cup margarine or butter
 1 pkg. (10 oz., about 40)
 regular marshmallows or 4 cups miniature marshmallows
 6 cups Kelloggs's Rice Krispies cereal

 Directions
 ----------

 1. Melt margarine in large saucepan over low heat. Add marshmallows and stir
    until completely melted. Remove from heat.

 2. Add Rice Krispies cereal. Stir until well coated.

 3. Using buttered spatula or waxed paper, press mixture evenly into buttered
    13x9x2-inch pan. Cut into squares when cool.

sure that looks tasty, but it's just not what i'm looking for. yeah, yeah,
yeah, i know, i'm rambling. ok, on with the show.


=[special thanks]=============================================================

this zine would not have been possible without the support from the following
people:

 - a7
 - fulcrum
 - knightmare
 - purifier
 - vader
 - satan

thanks...i really appreciate everything each of you has done.

a mighty special thanks goes out to mike dietz for being such an innocent
victim. thanks man.

if you would like to contact mike dietz, he can be reached by email at:

 mike.dietz@dimension.parasol.wierius.com

or if you would like to send him email via fidonet, his address is:

 1:114/497
  
and as always, you can contact him by phone:

 602-860-1544

[of course, harassing people is bad, and cds does not condone or take
responsibility for your actions. so don't blame cds, or me, if you get
in trouble.]

i have included a file of mike so everyone can see how ugly he is. the
picture sucks, but then again, so does he.

and also a thanks goes out to thndrbolt of 602 for keeping me laughing for
hours on end. you are one funny guy.


=[this has absolutely nothing to do with anything]============================

just to clear things up, mike dietz is a lamer among lamuhs. you will probably
notice me dwelling on this one fact alone. now don't get me wrong here, i am
not obsessed. he does the stupidest things and to me he is very funny.

you are probably thinking, "why should i care about this 'mike dietz' lamer
anyway?"

i'm not saying you have to care, i'm not saying anyone has to care. all i want
to do is amuse you with his stupidity. i'm sure you will find something he
does, or i do to him, funny or informative.

a brief history...

for those of you who have never heard of the 5th dimension, it is one of the
lamest bbses ever put up. the number as of 06-07-96 is 602-451-8598. give it
a call and get a good laugh. he is currently running remote access on a:

whoa. that was gay. like i said before, this guy is very lame. i'm sure he is
going to change his whole bbs again, this due to the fact his h/d partition
was destroyed. maybe he shouldn't run 500 byte .com files--they might be
trojans. here is what happens when you call his board:

               THE 5th DiMENSiON BBS is temporarly down...
               NETMail via FidoNET can still be recieved
               Address: 1:114/497
               InterNET EMail can still be recieved at:

               This shouls only last untill 5-20-96 at the
               longest.  There was a partial HD crash and
               I am fixing it as fast as possible.

               Mike Dietz -- SysOp of THE 5th DiMENSiON BBS

then it hangs up. i wonder why?

anyway, his handle is black hole (aka sand demon). and if you ever do get
around to calling his board, tell 'em i sent ya.

alright, now that you have been totally amused, i'm sure you are more than
ready to read on...


=[news that just gets to ya]==================================================

someone handed me a newspaper clipping which had the article below circled.
you may find it interesting, you may not. i just thought that it was very
annoying that the "web surfer kiddies" of today are considered whiz kids.


        Niche markets...search engines...Web browsers.

        They might sound like terms punctuating the conversation of grad
students in management and computer science. But they're familiar territory
to three teens at Desert Mountain High School in Scottsdale who have formed
their own company to design Web pages for businesses wanting to jump on the
Internet.

        Mike and Pat Murray, both 17 and Mike Hitt, 16, are co-founders of
Tsunami Creations, and hope to ride the wave of Internet surfers to riches
before they even graduate from high school. They've already built web pages
for two Valley companies and are on the prowl for other customers who want to
circulate their messages in cyberspace.
                
        Like most teenage computer tutors, the three are largely self-taught
computer whizzes who get hired through word of mouth.

        They plan to legally form a limited partnership in June so they can
bring on their first employee, Devin Mahoney, a sophomore at Desert Mountain
who specializes in animated graphics.

        Many businesses are turning to whiz kids to help plug into the
computer age. Not only have a lot of youngsters been playing games and doing
homework on computers since they were old enough to guide a mouse, but also
they often work for less money than an adult while turning out as good a
product.

        Andy Rodriguez, executive producer for New Phoenix Filmworks, a
Scottsdale-based company that hired the Tsunami kids to design his Web site,
said he was struck by the professionalism of the new generation.

        "We were discussing the possibilities of making a scene from one of
our movies available on the net, and they were deferring to a friend of theirs
who was only 15 years old," Rodriquez said. "He was only about as tall my
knee, but he was spouting off about things like megahertz and how the movie
would be downloaded. It was not that sort of thing I learned about when I was
in high school."

        Rodriquez decided to hire the teens to build his Web site because they
had previously created computerized special effects for a movie he produced.
"We had other options, but we knew they were pretty reliable," he said. "They
can give me worldwide access as well as anyone else."


and as usual, i admire their ability to make money. what i don't admire is the
fact that they are considered genius because they can write in html. it is
a sore fact that adults are being pushed into the ever growing double click
era. unfortunately so are the children.

don't let this happen to you! become a hermit like me. live your whole life
locked in a one room apartment. code your own operating system. order chinese
food every day, and stay off the internet!


=[setting up a mock renegade bbs]=============================================

setting up a mock renegade bbs
[the fun way to get passwords]

by cs

why you ask? one reason only. to get a lamuh's password. through out my
bbsing (and my life) i have noticed one thing. the lamerz always use the same
passwords over and over, bbs after bbs. of all the boards that i have hacked
or stolen the users.dat file from, it would seem that the lamerz are really
stupid or don't know what a different password is.

this is where "you" come in. now it just so happens that you really hate this
guy. lets say his name is mike dietz. (a totally random name picked of
course.) and you want to destroy his bbsing life for ever.

step 1
------
the first thing you want to get, being the most important, is a phone line.
it is going to cost you about $50-60 to get it installed for the first time,
and about $15-20 dollars a month. if you already have a separate phone line,
contact the phone company and have the number changed--this will prevent
anyone who knows you to catch onto your scheme.

step 2
------
the second thing you need to do is get renegade. i suggest renegade because
it is very easy to setup and configure. it also shows you the users'
passwords. once you get renegade setup and configured "thus far" move on to
step three.

step 3
------
now that you have renegade running, you need to configure it so that mike
dietz will enjoy himself when he calls. for example lets just say mike dietz
really likes warez. setup the file areas like this:

 1   warez new uploads
 2   warez applications
 3   warez games
 4   warez utilities
 5   warez misc

then setup the message areas like this:

 1   warez talk
 2   warez elite requests
 3   warez flaming
 4   warez the scene

step 4
------
once you got that done start with the ansis. make sure they aren't too good
because you have to remember "this bbs isn't gonna stay up forever" and "mike
dietz is a fucking loser that likes warez." i would suggest something like
this for a main menu:
 
                          ÜÜÜ . ÜÜİ   ş   ÜÜÜÜÜ ÜÜÜ .
                          ßÜ.ßú ÛÛù   ÛÛ  ùÛÛ   ßÜ.ßú

Û   Ü                                                                     Ü   Û
 Û                                                                           Û
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

step 5
------
now that you have your bbs all setup and ready to go, it's time for mike dietz
to call. a good way to give him the number without actually telling him it, is
to post it on a bbs that you know he is on, usually in the bbs list.

when mike dietz calls make sure to chat with him. here is a sample of what a
conversation of you and him might look like:

 sysop breaking in for a chat:

 cs: mike dietz? what kind of fucking handle is that?
 md: excuse me!?! how rude!
 cs: heh. i am just messin with ya. get a grip dood.
 md: whatever
 cs: where did you get the number for this bbs?
 md: w'ell i calld a bbs called gay rites of amurica. and i saw it in a bbs
     list
 cs: hmmm. gay rites huh? so you're not into warez then?
 md: warz? no i'am not into that kindof stuff.
 cs: really? thats too bad because i don't charge here like on peter s.
     guild's bbs.
 md: wow! thts great! what do ihave to do?
 cs: just upload every once in a while. and post alot in the message base.
 md: how do i dothat? im not smrt enought to post in the messagebase.
 cs: i guess it really doesn't matter anyway. this bbs is fairly new.
 md: ok souns great!
 cs: alright let me validate you real quick.
 md: okk
 [you validate him with alt-v]
 cs: you are now elite mike dietz.
 md: neato! now i can bragg to nick coons about alll the wares i am goingto
     get
 cs: i'll let you go now.
 md: ttyl

 end of chat

step 6
------
wait a few days and then call the phone company and change your number. or if
you want you can change mike dietz's password on your bbs. this usually
confuses the hell out of most lamuhs.

so now what do you do you ask? well it's simple. you have mike dietz's
password and you know he always uses the same one. call a bbs and mass email
a message like the one below to everyone, including the sysop. and if that
bbs has fidonet make sure you post very disgusting, rude, and sexually
undesirable messages on it. and especially make sure you brag to the sysop
how 'leet you are.

 I AM THE ELITEST MOTHER FUCKER IN THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD!

 mike dietz
 THE 5th DiMENSiON
 602-860-0202

use the message above and you have about a 100% chance of getting mike dietz
kicked off any bbs of your choice.

this is a sure way to get almost anybody's password. although i recommend you
do it on a larger scale rather than just one user. this is for two reasons.
one being it is not cheap paying for a phone line and two it will save you
lots of time.

what's that you say? you can't see the user's password because cott lang
decided to improve renegade? ok, just make the user run a door. their password
is always written to the door.sys drop file.

njoy.


=[how to make a modern pay box]================================================

How To Make A Modern Pay Box

by PURiFiER

Ingredients:
------------

1 Call Forwarding service on the line

1 Set of Red Box Tones

The number to your prefix's Intercept operator (do some scanning
for this one)

How To:
-------

After you find the number to the intercept operator in
your prefix, use your call-forwarding and forward all calls to
her...this will make your phone stay off the hook(actually, now
it waits for a quarter to be dropped in)...you now have a pay
box... In Order To Call Out On This Line:You must use your Red
Box tones and generate the quarter dropping in...then,you can
make phone calls to people...as far as I know, this is fairly
safe, and they do not check much...Although I am not sure, I
think you can even make credit-card calls from a paybox
phone and not get traced...


=[ripping off your local library copy machine]=================================

ripping off your local library copy machine

by cyber shadow

after having the librarian refuse to let me check out a book, and reminding me
i had a 50 dollar library fine, i decided to take matters into my own hands.
checking my pockets i dug up a shiny quarter--this would be my saviour.

scanning the library i spotted the one machine that could help me out. ahh,
i thought, this book is really great, why don't i just make a copy of it.
then i won't have to check it out...

i wandered over to the copy machine and laid the book face down. taking the
quarter, i dropped it into the coin slot and watched as the digital display
registered 0.25. fearlessly i pushed the copy button, waited a second, and
then pressed the coin release button.

the machine spit the quarter out as my new copy was made. laughing briefly i
put the quarter back into the coin slot and made copy number two, then three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, ..., one hundred, ...

twenty minutes later the machine started beeping wildly. the librarian ran
to the copy machine and gave me an evil glare. "what are you doing!" she
demanded. "why is this copy machine out of paper!"

"how do i know you stupid slut. all i was doing was making a copy of this
book you wouldn't let me check out. shut the fuck up."

"oh, i'm sorry," the librarian said apologetically. "here's a quarter. go
try using the other copy machine." she handed me the quarter and crawled back
to her desk.

i looked at the stack of papers i had just made--all one hundred of them.
this is boring, i thought, i'm outta here. after thumbing through the fresh
copies, i picked out the page i needed and tossed the rest.


why it works?

it's real simple. just put your quarter in, press the big green copy button,
wait a second, then press the coin release button. the copy machine doesn't
communicate with the coin accepter very well and is the reason why it has
timing defect.

i've seen a few machines where the timing defect had been corrected. if this
happens, just take a bat, and um, you know what to do.

i would like to express my thanks to the people who own and manage the library
copy machines. you have saved me at least 20 dollars these last few months.

                               "Lamuhs of 6o2"
                             by  ---*/<nightmare

         We all know they're out there...calling BBSes just to play LORD.
Downloading their SHAREWARE. Wasting perfectly good money to call The Rock
Garden. They're lamers. Shit, we sure do seem to have our share of them here
in 6o2. If you've ever called Shadow of Cyberia, you've heard of Mike Dietz.
Or how about Vicious Rumor, the biggest wannabe-elite warez pud on the face of
the earth. Humorous captures, amusing editorials, and more await you in:

                   THE DICTIONARY OF LAMERS. Volume 1.

         Yeah, yeah. Sound the fucking trumpets or something. Anyway, here we
go. Keep in mind that this is in no order of lameness (which isn't a bad idea,
but anyway.) They are all equally stupid. Expect further installments, each
documenting a new lamer.

1. *Thunderbolt*

         I *had* to mention him first. This guy doesn't seem to understand
capitalization, spelling, punctuation, hygiene, dignity, or being a sysop.
First of all, he runs Wildcrap. Why, you ask? "Wildcat is commercial software.
The feds won't think that an elite bbs runs commercial software." (By the way,
I had to fix about 20 spelling errors in that one sentence.) What a loser. The
feds don't care what you're running. If they've got a pile of evidence against
your bbs, they're not gonna say "Oh, he's running Wildcat. Forget this case,
let's go investigate something else."

         Now, onto his spelling and grammar skills. A little capture, if you
will...

         Laf. He's getting try of running his bbs. Hmm...

         I used to be on a board called the Software Asylum. It ran
Synchronet. Which sucks as much as Wildcat. But that's another story. Anyway,
I started slamming him in the bases and calling him a moron, etc. He logged on
one day and replied: "i Am nutt a morron. wE wil see abut thatt." Or something
to that effect. I then realized that my account was locked out on his lame bbs.
Then get this: HE CALLS ME VOICE AFTER I TRY TO LOGON. Asks me why I called
him a moron. I could barely contain my laughter...I made up some bullshit story
about being in a bad mood. He bought it.

         About his skills as a sysop...I could've run a better bbs when I was
in 3rd grade. Thunderbolt thinks that anything worse than a 1:1 ul/dl ratio is
unreasonable. I kept a 1:2 and he took away all of my file credits and called
me a leech. Of course, if he had the sense to actually look at the Wildcrap
manual, he'd know how to set up the credit system for a 1:1 ratio.

         Nobody ever uploaded there either. Thunderfuck must've forgotten...
he'd set up a questionnaire you could fill out and get file credits from. After
a few months of wondering what was going on, he deleted it. Said it was lost in
some HD accident. Okay. This guy is such a dipshit.

=[Phuntrans]===================================================================

Phuntrans                        

by PURiFiER

Introduction
===========

The Phuntrans is a VERY simple transmitter which can be handy for all sorts
of things. It is quite small and can easily be put in a number of places. I
have successfully used it for tapping fones, getting inside info, blackmail and
other such things. The possibilities are endless. I will also include the
plans or an equally small receiver for your newly made toy. Use it for just about
anything. You can also make the transmitter and receiver together in one
box and use it as a walkie talkie.

Materials you will need
======================

(1) 9 volt battery with battery clip
(1) 25-mfd, 15 volt electrolytic capacitor
(2) .0047 mfd capacitors
(1) .022 mfd capacitor
(1) 51 pf capacitor
(1) 365 pf variable capacitor
(1) Transistor antenna coil
(1) 2N366 transistor
(1) 2N464 transistor
(1) 100k resistor
(1) 5.6k resistor
(1) 10k resistor
(1) 2meg potentiometer with SPST switch
 Some good wire, solder, soldering iron, board to put it on, box (optional)

Schematic for Phuntrans
===========================

This may get a tad confusing but just print it out and pay attention.

                    from 2meg pot.


Notes about the schematic
=========================

1.  GND means ground
2.  The GND near the switch and the GND by the 2meg potentiometer should be
    connected.
3.  Where you see:  )(
                    ()
                    )( it is the transistor antenna coil with 15 turns of
                       regular hook-up wire around it.
4.  The middle of the loop on the left side (the left of "()") you should
run a wire down to the "+" which has nothing attached to it. There is a .0047
capacitor on the correct piece of wire.
5.  For the microphone use a magnetic earphone (1k to 2k).
6.  Where you see "[!]" is the antenna. Use about 8 feet of wire to
broadcast approx 300ft. Part 15 of the FCC rules and regulation says you can't
broadcast over 300 feet without a license. (Hahaha). Use more wire for
an antenna for longer distances. (Attach it to the black wire on the fone
line for about a 250 foot antenna!)

Operation of the Phuntrans
==========================

This transmitter will send the signals over the AM radio band. You use the
variable capacitor to adjust what freq. you want to use. Find a good unused
freq. down at the lower end of the scale and you're set. Use the 2 meg pot.
to adjust gain. Just fuck with it until you get what sounds good. The switch
on the 2meg is for turning the Phuntrans on and off. When everything is
adjusted, turn on an AM radio adjust it to where you think the signal is. Have a
friend lay some shit thru the Box and tune in to it. That's all there is to it.
The plans for a simple receiver are shown below:

The Phuntrans receiver
======================

(1) 9 volt battery with battery clip
(1) 365 pf variable capacitor
(1) 51 pf capacitor
(1) 1N38B diode
(1) Transistor antenna coil
(1) 2N366 transistor
(1) SPST toggle switch
(1) 1k to 2k magnetic earphone

Closing statement
=================

This two devices can be built for under a total of $10.00. Not too bad.
Using these devices in illegal ways is your option. If you get caught, I accept
NO responsibility for your actions. This can be a lot of fun if used
correctly. Hook it up to the red wire on the phone line and it will send the
conversation over the air waves.

Enjoy!


=[how to get free stuff]=======================================================

How to get free stuff

by Fulcurm

Who says you have to pay for everything. Here are some tips to help you get
away with shoplifting and other tricks to keep your money where it belongs--
in your wallet.

.oO Shoplifting Oo.

- Overview

Here is one that almost anyone can pull off. There are some things to watch
out for though. The first thing you want to do is to wear the correct
clothing. Loose, baggy clothing with many pockets will work best. Don't wear
a ski mask, sometimes the employees get a little suspicious. Basically, if
you can't figure out what to wear go download some more warez.

- Location

Now that you dressed properly you want to find the ideal locations. Large
stores that don't have that much in the way of staff work well. Those huge
food stores that sell everything work too. Try to stay away from places in
malls, as they have too many people. Also, I would recommend that you stick
with stores that have long isles, which lessens the chance that someone will
walk by close to you and see what your up to.

- Security

There are some things to watch out for. Something that is common in
convenience stories are those convex mirrors that let the workers see most
of the store. Basically, if you can see them then they can see you. The
best way to beat these is to grab whatever you want and then go to a location
in the store where the mirrors don't show you and load up your pockets.
Most mirrors that are meant to be used as mirrors are of the convex type to
give the cashier or whatever a wide angle view of what's going on. If you see
any other type, it's a good bet that there is a camera behind it.

That brings us to hidden cameras. These are identified by mirrored domes in
the roof, or mirrored panels. Although cameras can be dangerous, it isn't
always a reason to find a new store. For one thing, they might be faking the
presence of the cameras. Knowing someone who works there helps, you can ask
them for the details of that stores particular system. Another thing is that
at most there will only be one person watching the cameras, if that many. So,
although they might be taping the whole store at once, you're only live for a
few seconds. Also, the whole store can't be covered. Frequently you can just
carry something to the end of an aisle, and pocket it there. Yes, they might
see it if the tapes are watched later on, but you're basically safe once you
leave the store.

One other security device is the magnetic tags that are put on the more
expensive items. Basically the point is that if you try to leave the store
with the item you'll set off the alarms. It's usually too hard to remove
the tag without destroying the item, so just go find another store. If you're
trying to take stuff that expensive you'd better know what you're doing.

- The Act

This is the simple part. The key to lifting something is to make it quick,
and not very obvious. Don't pick something out and look around in every
direction, this will look very suspicious. When you come into the store scope
out the security. Then decide what your going to take and where you're going
to pocket it. Now just walk to the product, pick it up, and if your planning
on snagging it there, turn around, check and pocket. The faster the better.
If you're going to another location the same thing goes, just walk, turn, and
pocket. Once you've got the item hidden you should leave the store pretty
soon, as if someone spotted you, you'll have a chance to escape before an
employee comes after you.

If your going snag something really small, like a pack of gum, the best way
is pick it up and start walking around with it. Hold it in your hand over
your pocket. When it's safe, just slide it in. Another method is to pick
up the gum, then get out your wallet or keys. Play around with them, and then
slide both things back into your pocket. If someone sees you they are likely
to assume that you already had it because it was with your keys or wallet,
which live in your pocket. A little psychology for you.

- Caught

If you get caught don't worry too much. If an employee comes up to you, remain
calm. When they ask you if you stole something say no. If they ask you to
empty your pockets say no. Give them allot of crap about your rights, and if
you're a minority, how much your taken advantage of. However, you don't want
them to call the police. Take them as far as possible, but if the police come
they do have the right to search you, and if they have you on tape you could
be in trouble. The best thing to do is if they won't let you go and they
are really going to call the police then you should just offer to pay them
with cash for what you had on you. If you cry and act like it's your first
time shoplifting then they will probably let you go, if you pay them.

.oO Free Keys Oo.

Need a copy of your keys? Need a copy of your neighbors keys? Well, Home
Depot will gladly make you a copy and pretty much give them away to you for
free. Take your keys and find a Home Depot, if you're lucky enough to have
one of them in your area. More than likely there will be a locksmith
booth in one of the aisles. Look for the row with all the door handles. Then
give the employee your keys. You'll get your keys back, and a paper envelope
containing your copies. All you have to do now is take the envelope somewhere
and open it, and slide those shiny new keys into your pocket. If the Home
Depot you're at is nice enough to provide public restrooms just go in there
and find yourself a stall. Just make sure you take the empty envelope out
of the bathroom, then you can just ditch it somewhere. Make good use of your
new keys.

.oO Free Luggage Locks Oo.

You know those little locks that are used to stop your zippers from coming
open? That's pretty much all they are good for, because a five year old can
break them open, but they're cool. Who cares though, your getting them
free. This one is easy enough for you warez puppies to understand. Just go
into a large store such as Service Merchandise or Sears, and go to the
luggage area. There you'll find the locks and the keys right on the bags.
Rip the keys out of the little plastic thing, unlock the lock, and take off.

.oO Free Books Oo.

Hey, the library can't stop you from taking a backpack inside can they? Your
taking your books in there to study right? Of course, they have those
alarms to stop satanic fiends from taking their books, but I'm going tell
you how to beat their security. The location of the magnetic device will
most likely be in the spine, or behind the pocket. Just take a few books and
head for the bathroom. There is almost always one in the children's section,
because you don't want little kids pissing their pants with all those Barney
books around. Take you knife and start ripping apart the books until you find
the devices. You may want to try a test run of the system first, where you
just carry a modified book out the door. If the alarm goes off you can just
say that you forgot to check it out. If you don't have a library card then
just go say you have to find your dad because he has the card. Good luck
starting your new book collection.

.oO Free Car Service Oo.

This one is my favorite. Tired of those bozos cheating the hell out of you
to fix your car? Want a new paint job or window tint? Well here is a method
you can use to get free service for your car. Go find a smaller repair or
paint shop where the cars that aren't being worked on are parked outside with
easy access. Then get copies of your car keys. That night steal the plates
of someone else's car. The next morning take your car into the shop and tell
them that you're in a real hurry to get to work and that they are authorized
to do whatever they have need to do so that your car is running in top shape.
Alternatively for a paint/tint shop tell them exactly what kind of job you
want done so they will have no questions. Fill out the forms with bogus info.
For the phone number make something up, or if you have a VMB created without
your real info that is even better, especially with a paint shop because they
will want to tell you when it's done. Of course you could always use a line
that has been disconnected, and tell the dumb guy that your phone got cutoff
and you'll call everyday to see if it's done. However, after you've determined
that your car is ready just walk into the lot at two in the morning and take
it. Switch the plates and your home free. Of course the shop will have a set of
your car keys, but they can't really do anything with them.


=[keeping a lamuh quiet]=======================================================

sir bob's story hour presents:
keeping a lamuh quiet
by cs
(also featuring a guest appearance by a7)

la.. la. la. la... la la la...

hello boys and girls, it's time again for another sir bob's story hour. today
we will be reading the story "keeping a lamuh quiet." 

"ahhhh, you don't remember this classic tale? that's too bad, because this one
is funnier than hell..."

Busy Box (bizee box) n. 1 this is good for lame BBS's as they tend not to call
out much, and it will remain undetected for a longer period of time.

it happened. the sysop of the 5th dimension, black hole, had pissed me off one
too many times. it was time to get even.

with the help of a7 we managed to get that infamous black wire trimmed and
extracted from a scrap phone cable, and eventually we had a half foot of thin,
copper wire. this would be the busy box.

our plans were simple. we would sneak over to black hole's house, open his
phone box, busy box both his phone lines, and then make a run for it.

packing all the necessary supplies (flashlight, screw drivers, beer, etc) we
hopped on our bikes and rode to his house. after careful inspection of his
back yard we ditched the bikes behind a bush, and slowly crept over to the
phone box's location.

a minute passed and we eventually found the box. as a7 handed me a screw
driver i noticed something strange, black hole's phone box was wide open!

we laughed briefly and then focused back onto the job at hand. very carefully
i unscrewed the screw holding the green wire and then unscrewed the screw
holding the red wire. a7 handed me the busy box and i began twisting it around
the red wire's pole, and then the green wire's pole.

the first line went smoothly and uninterrupted. when i got to the second line
i unscrewed the red and green screws and began twisting the busy box around
the two poles. then it happened. all the electricity jumped from the phone
line and into me. i became a human cellular antenna. (my only explanation of
this is black hole may had been using the phone at the time or a user was on
his bbs.)

it didn't take me long to recover and i finished wrapping the wire around the
two poles. i closed the phone box and locked it; after all we don't want
anybody playing with his phone line!

quietly retracing our steps we made way back to our bikes and headed home.
from there we called both his lines and noticed they were busy. the next day
we called the lines again and they were still busy. "that's strange," i said,
"they must have left a phone off the hook."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ok, Now you're really pissed.
The Neighborhood Lamer has gone one step too far this time.
It's time for the Busy Box.

1) What is The Busy Box?

    The Busy Box is the Simplest Box ever created. It is attached to the
outside of the person's house, in their telephone box. It Makes it So that
When any Fone inside That house is Picked up, No dial Tone is heard, and
no Calls can be Received, or Sent. This is Good for Lame BBS's as They Tend
not to call out much, and it will remain Undetected for a longer Period of
Time.

2) Sounds Great! What do I need?

A) One Phone Cord - 5 Inches or so
B) Alligator Clips (Optional)

3) Wow! That's it? Tell me More! How do I set It Up?

    Well,  Take your phone cord, and remove the Outer insulation. Now you
should have 4 wires inside of it, Red, Green, Black, And Yellow. All you need
for most things are Green and Red, so save those. Take either the Black or The
Yellow and strip about 3 Inches with a wire stripper or a Knife. Now cut off 3
inches of Uninsulated wire and, voila, you have a really thin wire. Now, take
this wire, and go to your neighbors back yard. Look for Their Power Box, Near
it should be a small grey (or beige, or some ugly color) box with the little
Bell on it. Open this up (it should come right off, if not, use a 7/15 Hex
Driver) Now inside you should find four more pegs. Look for the Pegs with
a Green or Red wire coming out of them. If you have a Beige Box, hook it
up to Make sure there Is a Dial Tone. If there is, Tie one end of your small
wire to the peg with the Green Wire coming out of it, and another to the one
with the Red coming out of it. Now use your beige box on it again, there should
be no dial tone, and pressing buttons should be ineffective. Congratulations,
you've disabled their fone line.

    Something you might want to try is to make the small wire longer, and stuff
    it in to the back of the box where there is a jungle of wires, so it will
be more unnoticed. The more discreet, the better.

- Some Pro's and Con's -

Pro's -
 Very Effective - Any Idiot Could Build it - Very Inexpensive - Easy to Install
Hard to Detect source of problem

Con's -
 Easy to Detect that there -IS- a problem (No dial tone when receiver is picked
 up)

    If anyone knows how to busy the line out, and leave a dial tone, Please
    let me know

=[top 10 boards of 602]========================================================

                    [ The top 10 boards of 602, by Vader ]

1. - Realm of Phantasy

Sysop:       Ozymandias
Board Type:  Warez
Software:    PCBoard
Nodes:       3
Number:      Not disclosed
NUP:         Not disclosed

        In the area of warez here in 602, this one, by far is the best.  
        Utilizing 3 lines, with people calling, transferring files, and posting 
        24 hours a day.  There are many reasons why this is not just another 
        big warez board.  There really is no real age limit on files, people 
        can upload and download files that are actually useful.  Not just 0-2 
        day old files.  There are also no ratios in place, you can get a 
        little out of the expected ratio with no problems.  The range of users 
        is also a plus.  Hard core warez people are not the only users on ROP.  

2. - POO

Sysop:       Trip 
Board Type:  Art
Software:    Renegade
Nodes:       1
Number:      Not disclosed
NUP   :      Not disclosed

        This is the most well-known board in 602.  People from around the 
        country (and probably the world) call this board all the time.  Why?
        Because it is WHQ to Apathy.  One of the largest groups in the
        art scene.  The amount of affils this board has is almost unlistable.
        The board was modded by acidic, and has ansis done by the likes of
        Lord Jazz, Misfit, ect...  Usually the only acceptable applicants are
        art people.

3. - White Lightning

Sysop:
Board Type:  Warez
Software:    Oblivion/2
Nodes:       2
Number:      Not disclosed
NUP:         Not disclosed

        Nothing really special about this place.  Just your usual big warez
        system.  2 nodes, 10 gigs, OBV/2.  But I really don't see anything
        negative about any of these things..  The users are generally people
        who are known in the warez community.

4. - Shadow of Cyberia

Sysop:       Cyber Shadow
Board Type:  Art/HPAV/Coding
Software:    Renegade
Nodes:       1
Number:      602-451-8564
NUP:         Not disclosed

        This place has alot to offer.  Great message bases, with topics 
        ranging from pascal coding to weed.  The same goes with files. Just
        about everything you'd want besides warez.  Lots of anarchy stuff,
        Zines (home of this zine, of course), virii, and coding related files.
        The board also has a lot of hacking and phreaking texts.  Well modded
        with original ansi done by the Cyber Shadow.  The user base is a 
        little dense, but the board is only 2 or 3 weeks old.  CS has also
        talked of the possibility of an additional line.

5. - Entropy

Sysop:       Point Man
Board Type:  Art/HP
Software:    Renegade
Nodes:       1
Number:      Not disclosed
NUP:         Not disclosed

        This BBS was designed by it's remote sysop, Clark, and he did a good
        job.  Ansi done by Trip, Misfit, and Clark.  A lot of great modding
        was done to this board, lots of light bars, and other goodies.  Many
        would have a hard time deciphering which software the board is using.
        The messages go in spirts, as does the sysop, sometimes you'll call
        and there will be 70 new messages, other times there will be 1 or 2.
        The board has a lot of art and modding packs.  It also has a lot of
        Zines, and H/P texts.

6. - The DeathStar

Sysop:       Vader
Board Type:  Warez/Art/HP/Coding
Software :   Renegade
Nodes:       1
Number:      602-507-0546
NUP:         Not disclosed

        Ummm, this is my board.  Good overall system.  Averages a healthy
        amount of posts.  The warez trading is a little weak, but there is
        a respectable collection online.  WHQ to a new Art/Coding group
        with the name DiRT.  I don't know if the group will last, but I can
        assure you, the board will.

7. - Vomitorium

Sysop:       Balls Wilson
Board Type:  ART/HP
Software:    Iniquity
Nodes:       1
Number:      Not disclosed
NUP:         Not disclosed

        This board should be #3 or #4...  the only thing holding it back is 
        its time restraint.  3pm to 7pm kinda sucks for a BBS.  That all 
        aside though, it has great art.  The sysop is Balls Wilson from 
        Apathy.  He has a unique ansi style, and it adds character to his 
        board.  The Vomitorium is also the home of JiveNet, an up and coming 
        602, and possibly national art oriented net.

8. - Genocide

Sysop:       Dinchak
Board Type:  Warez/HP/Coding
Software:    Renegade
Nodes:       1
Number:      Not disclosed
NUP:         Not disclosed

        Dinchak is the only person on this list who has been putting up boards 
        longer then I have.  Traditionally Genocide has been a warez board, 
        with an active message base.  He is slowly moving away from warez (as 
        have a lot of boards in 602) to more of a H/P board.  Genocide is WHQ 
        to ZOK a coding group.

9. - Den of Sin

Sysop:       MyKill
Board Type:  PD/Warez/Adult
Software:    Syncronet
Nodes:       1
Number:      220-0672
NUP:         None in place

        This board is really old.  You can tell when you call.  Users you've
        never heard of, ansi from thedraw fonts.  But, the board trades in
        a lot of warez, and racks in a lot of good messages.  And for all you
        perverts 2 adult CDs.  It's worth calling once and awhile, if you can
        ever get on.

10. - Starbase Command

Sysop:       The Admiral 
Board Type:  PD/light warez
Software:    PCBoard
Nodes:       1
Number:      936-3649
NUP:         None in place

        I never really liked the regular 1 menu based PCBoards.  That's why
        I like what the admiral has done to SBC.  He's modded it so that it
        looks and feels like an RG system.  Some other positives about SBC
        include:  good selection of PPEs and PCB utils, FidoNet (well, maybe)
        and it's leet area.  He has a very small selection of warez and adult
        files.  The board has very little usage.  


   This was kinda hard to do, since the selection of good boards is so slim.
The rumor is that 2 or possibly 3 good art oriented boards will be going up
this summer, so that should erase my problems.  Sorry to PC Connections and
The Source, but uh... your boards kinda suck, if I might say so. You guys have 
Lots of warez, gigs of storage space, but the boards have no character.  
   
   I'd like your input on how I did here, and I'm sure there are boards I 
missed. If you'd like to tell me your opinion, or tell me the number to a 
board I should look at you can reach me at:

=[lamuhs of 6o2 ii]============================================================

                               "Lamuhs of 6o2"
                             by  ---*/<nightmare

                      THE DICTIONARY OF LAMERS. Volume 2.

        This volume's lamer has been asking for something like this...for a
LONG time...

2. *Vicious Rumor*

        This guy is a dick, plain and simple. I can't count the number of
times I've wanted to hike to his house and shove a broom handle up his ass.
What makes it even worse is that he used to be a cool person.

        First of all, this faggot is lucky he wasn't caught by the feds for
trading warez on his bbs. The day he puts it up, he calls 3 or 4 PD bbses and
posts an ad in the damn auto messages for everyone to see. Such an idiot.

        I was looking for new bbses to call at the time, so I dialed it up.
He pulls me into chat after I'm done applying. I started to tell him how
fucking stupid it was to post the bbs number all over the place. He said he'd
done it before in Michigan or something like that. After a few more minutes
of me badgering him, the dumbfuck decided to go remove those ads.

        I was basically his first user. He was desperately in need of warez
and all...I probably uploaded about a hundred megs or so. The only thing he
had before me was Heretic. His only ware. Laugh. He's pleased as shit that I'm
uploading so much. I was doing ansis all the while for him too, absolutely
free. He said that I'd be his cosysop, and that he was really glad I started
calling and all of that bullshit.

        Only he didn't make me his cosysop. The next day I called, I find out
he's made the bbs 0-30 day only. Awwwwww shit. Only the lame are concerned
with speed. Then I find out, he took away all of my file credits. "This bbs is
0-30 day only now, and none of the stuff you uploaded was 0-30 day." Suck my
nuts. You didn't want 0-30 back then.

        It's like overnight he turned into a dipshit. He starts demanding ansi
from me constantly. "I'm getting tired of that one, make me a new one by
tomorrow." After setting his lame ass straight about the time it takes me to
do a good ansi, he started bitching. He used it as an excuse to call me a
leech, when all I'd downloaded in the last week was one program. He went and
chose 2 other guys as his cosysops.

        As if he wasn't lame enough. He made the bbs 0-3 day only. What an
idiot. Like anyone has a chance when you've only got one node. Then the
dumbass went out and joined some no-name courier group that uploaded 1 file in
a few weeks. Then he chose another. As I put it on RoP "VR changes courier
groups more often than he changes his underwear." Heh.

        Since his little groups weren't doing what he wanted, he got himself
a primenet account. After spending days of asking his users questions about
IRC, he started gankin warez from #fatefiles. So much each day that you'd have
to be lucky as hell to get on his bbs. The dipshit was waking up at like 4 am
to transfer warez...Such a loser. I stopped calling. The end.

***Summary***

Handle: Vicious Rumor (Spelled wrong. Another Thunderbolt, perhaps?)
Name: Tom
Address: Unknown
Phone #: Unknown
BBS Name: Breaking the Silence (Lame? Yah.)

        Sorry, no captures this time. I stopped calling too long ago. Warez
on and prosper.

How to Destroy someonez Life!
--by SATAN <AWAM>


      -*Destroy Someones Life*-

      Someone at yer school pissing you off? Yer Boss just fire you? Feel 
      like getting revenge, but dont know how? well, revenge can be tha
      ultimate payback, and when someone is pissing you off bad enuff, and
      you dont wanna kill 'em but make them suffer more, well, read on good
      reader cuz you will get revenge!

      OK, say theres these two girls at yer school, we will call them 
      Missy and Michelle Gilliland. Lets make Missy 15, and Michelle 16.
      OK, wow, looks like Michelle can drive! GEE! lets goto her house
      and take a look at her blue Honda Civic! well, we need an address, 
      so let say they live at 7708 West Villa Theresa Dr., Glendale AZ 
      85308. hmm. nice car, needs some werk...ok, take some magnesium strips
      <get them from yer school lab> and shove as many that will fit into
      tha lock, now light it and it will melt tha lock so tha key wont fit!
      Do tha same to their front-door! 

      Seriuosly, i think her dad William R Gilliland needs some new sex-toyz
      since he iz single...call any porn shop and order everything COD. my
      he will luv that!

      HMMM...ya know what?? i have been calling their number 938-7458, for
      awhile now and it iz always busy...hmm. LETS GIVE THEM CALL-WAITING!!
      well, call tha company and tell them that!! and they will ask for shit,
      well i gave it to you!

      I think that Micheal has too many Credit Cards...lets help him out and
      get rid of some! well, call up VISA/Mastercard/Discover whatever and 
      tell them that yer cards were stolen and want to IMMEDIATLY cancel them!
      ahhh, that will make Micheal happy :)

      Isnt it nearing Christmas?? lets send him a gift! hmm, magazine 
      subscriptions!! hmm, i think KKK news would be good, since Missy
      and Michelle hate rasism, they can learn who they are just hating! :)
      also, lets bill them to him! ya know, since hes got all that $$$

      Lets drop by with a surprise visit to their house! hmmm. see that 
      tan box on tha side of tha house? gee, that doesnt look good there
      lets put it where it would look better, like in tha living room!
      yank it off with a crowbar, C4, whatever it takes and throw it
      somwhere!!! they will thank you later!

      Didnt i see Missy Gilliland dealing drugs at Mountain Ridge High
      yesterday...My My, tha pigz should know this so they can do tha
      right thing! Missy will thank you after she gets out in like 10 yearz!

      Ya know what i think? i think the whole Gilliland family will like
      to be paged 486234756347562394 times at 2 in tha morning? dont you
      think so too? well, write a nifty pager script and start dialing!!

      Lets go back to tha Honda Civic...i think some crack/cocaine would fit
      nicely in tha trunk!! well, since Michelle burned me on a deal, i think
      it iz about time to call someone who carez like the GPD! dont worry
      Michelle, it is only 20 years, and hey you get to be with all tha blacks
      cuz they are tha ones stealing!! she will be happy!

      Hmmm. I think it is about time to actually HELP them out...why dont we
      send some food?? go out and slaughter yer favorite cat and mutialte it,
      send it to em in a box!!! that food will be put to good use!

      Whats that i say?? their dad has a pager????!!!?!? hmm, lets find out
      what # it iz...call them up and say you are a repair man and need tha
      # to fix or some shit, well, then if ya know how to hack Pagers, do it!
      <if not look for pagers.zip and D/L it> i think he is wasting too much
      $$$ on hiz pager, so lets help them out again, by cancleing his account!

      You see, now that i think of it, we werent DESTROYING peoples lifes, 
      we were _helping_ them!! well, i hope that you would never call or
      do this stuff to the good ol' Gillilands :) cuz that would be bad!!

that every newbie programmer dreams about. what is it you ask? ahhh it's
a fade routine.

this was written for quickbasic. to use compile the assembly code in tasm, or

=[wrap up]====================================================================

this concludes the first issue of children of a dying sun. i will probably be
coding an emag engine for the next issue, or i will release this issue again
after it has been compiled into and exe.

send any complaints or comments to the support bbs, which would be the shadow
of cyberia, and make sure you tell me where you got the number...
