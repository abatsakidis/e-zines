=[who we are/how to get in touch with us]======================================

we're bah-aack.

that's right, us "lamers" are at it again. we're still the same old cds,
except purifier and fulcrum have not been seen for months. i have a running
theory that mike dietz is taking us out one by one. at least he'll get me
last.

speaking of mike dietz, i heard it took him about an hour to take a card out
of a macintosh computer and install a program. uhh nevermind. you had to have
been there i guess.

cds wants articles from you (the reader). this is a free publication zine.
"what does that mean?!" you say? well it means that if you send me your
article, and it is comical and/or informative, i will put it in the next
latest issue.

unfortunately hound's hard drive crashed and he could not write an article
for this issue. (that's what he gets for running ms-dos.)

to get in touch with me you can leave me email at:

 sirbob@juno.com

or call the support bbs:

 the shadow of cyberia
 602-451-8564
 nup: sabotage

if you want you can worship the mighty goat god ghelia. that is the fastest
way to get in touch with me, but not very reliable.


=[issue number three!?]=======================================================

i'm just as surprised as you.. issue number three is out. that's a real scary
thought, considering i must have been on crack last issue. i had typoes
everywhere and the emag was a piece of crap. so i apologize.

in this issue prank calls are our speciality. so get ready for some really
funny transcripts..

And check this out. I finally got my shift key working. Now I can entrance you
with CaPiTaL letters. i enjoyed everything in lower case.. but it just gets
old sometimes. and i was sick and tired of retyping articles so they would be
consistent with all the rest. so if you notice some articles in lower case, or
UPPER CASE, or BoTH, just enjoy it.

aLERT! aLERT!
-------------

the command.com virus is going around again. if you see it in any directory
on your hard disk, delete it at once. it may tell you that it is read only;
that is just one of it's many tricks. you must use attrib to take off the read
only attribute.

known symptoms are infecting your hard drive with bill gate's bullshit called
microsoft. you may experience system freezes, less than 1 meg of conventional
memory, and notice strange directories like "c:\windows" created on your hard
disk.

also reported clones of this virus are msdos.sys and io.sys. a small script
language has been created for use with command.com. two files known to exist
are "config.sys" and "autoexec.bat".

f-prot will not find it, nor will mcaffe, or any other commercial virus
scanning utility.

once command.com and all other known clones have been deleted, reboot computer
at once. if your monitor reads "insert boot disk into drive a: and press any
key to continue" then the command.com virus was not successfully removed and
is still in memory.

to wipe command.com out of your memory, you must take a large magnet to your
hard disk drive and wait a few days until you are sure the memory is
destroyed. another method to erase your memory is to take out your simms/sips
and wash them under hot water. (usually boiling the memory in a large pot of
water works best.)

if any other known mutations of the command.com virus exist, please let cds
know at once. i have heard a rumour there was a new clone known as
"windows 95" going around..

=[email to the editor]========================================================

i got some constructive and informative email after releasing cds #2. i really
appreciate reading hate mail, it gives me a good laugh. this was by far the
funniest email i have ever gotten.

notice the higher superiority that you feel when you read two minutes hate
letter to me:

-<hate mail>------------------------------------------------------<hate mail>-
Date: x:xx am  xxx xxx xx, 1996        Number : xx of xx
From: Two Minutes Hate                 Base   : Private Mail
To  : Cyber Shadow                     Refer #: None
Subj: New User Application             Replies: None
Stat: Normal                           Origin : Local

Listen up.  I read your ezine.  Number 1 and 2.  You wanna stop blowing your 
horn and learn what you're talking about, you stick with me.  I ain't giving 
you references, I ain't telling you what BBS I run, I ain't telling you shit, 
and if you dial the number your caller ID says I'm on you'll get a PBX (so 
have fun with it).  Stop talking big and start making sense.

There is no 'rlogin' hack in any version of SunOS.  There is no 'telnet hack' 
that's too long to explain.  About the only truthful thing in your magazine is
the beating the BBS to death with a baseball bat.  Good old fashioned hacking,
right?  

So disallow me access because I'm not elite.  The fact is that elite people 
don't broadcast their new user password in a pathetic hacking ezine.  I'll be 
back in one form or another.

TMH
-<hate mail>------------------------------------------------------<hate mail>-

what i thought was funny was the fact that there is an rlogin sunos hack. do
you honestly think that we would put up something that doesn't work so you
would be discouraged?! i think that this "guru" should go back and try again.
because we tried it and it worked. so either we are on crack, or two minutes
hate is trying this rlogin hack from dos.

and what is their problem? they never would have been able to apply to my bbs
if i did not put the nup in cds.

and since when was cds elite?


-[aTTENTION!@$@! aTTENTION!@$@!]----------------------------------------------

if you would like to send me your hate mail, go ahead. nothing is stopping
you. actually i appreciate it. it lets us know what the readers of cds think.


=[the trip story]=============================================[figure it out]=

i sure hope trip doesn't read this. :)

this is a three part prank call. the whole idea was to call up trip, tell him
i was a tty operator, and then pretend to relay ewheet's conversation to him.
the reason i was acting like a tty operator is because ewheet is deaf.

just incase anyone is wondering, i was not the only person behind this
masterful scheme. several people helped me including twotone (a long gone
founder of thrust), xhenophyte, and balls wilson (an apathy member).

this had to be one of the funnier pranks i have ever done. and it's all true.
here is a short recap of the whole thing...

as usual i was bored. bored. bored. bored. so bored i wanted to scream. and
being the creative person i am, i hooked up a tape recorder to my phone and
called xhenophyte voice to chat with him.

we started talking about how we could do this and that to certain people, and
how it would be kewl to call 'em up and prank them. then trip came up in the
conversation and we began to draw out our little scheme.

after we worked out the details, we called up twotone three way and told him
our idea. i hadn't planned on being the tty operator, and since trip might
notice twotone's and xhenophyte's voice, i was given the job.

what we had planned was to call up trip and tell him ewheet was flying to
phoenix in a few days. then call back about a day later and tell him ewheet
was at the phoenix airport and wanted to meet trip somewhere in phoenix. (of
course this would all be acted out as a tty operator.)

some names have been changed to protect the innocent.

so here is the whole trip story. part 1, 2 and 3.


part 1:
-------

(dialing.. this is gonna be great..!@#)

cs=cyber shadow, trip=trip, mom=trip's mom

mom : hello?
cs  : hello?
cs  : this is a tty operator. my name is simon mchenry. may i talk to <trip's
      real name>?
mom : just a minute..

[long pause]

cs  : hello? is this <trip's real name>?
trip: yeah.
cs  : this is a tty operator, simon mchenry, and i am trying to connect you to
      <ewheet's real name>.
trip: oh, yeah.
cs  : he says that he is flying in to phoenix tomorrow and wants to know if
      you would like to meet him.
trip: oh yeah.
cs  : where would you like to meet him?
trip: what part of town are you going to be in <ewheet's real name>?
cs  : he says phoenix.
trip: what part of phoenix, do you know?
cs  : he says he doesn't know. what place would you recommend for him?
trip: there's probably a good place to meet him is metro center mall.
      <mumbles.. i can't understand the recording.>
cs  : he wants to know how to get there from the airport.
trip: ahh. metro center mall is at about 31st and dunlap. i'm not sure how to
      get there from the airport. can you hold on a second?
cs  : yes sir.

[short pause]

trip: hello?
cs  : hello?
trip: ok..
cs  : <ewheet's real name> says he will make it to metro center and he wanted
      to go over to your house after words. uhh huh.. would you like me to add
      anything else?
trip: tell him.. ask him if he can go on the irc right now.
cs  : he says that his computer is experiencing funny problems right now. his
      provider is not connecting. but he will try later.
trip: yeah.
cs  : uh huh.
trip: alright. tell him that he has my number and to call me tty when he gets
      to phoenix.
cs  : uh huh.
trip: and uh, we'll work out the details.
cs  : alright. thank you.
trip: alright. thank you. bye.


now that trip is buried deep within the prank, the next part is carried out
the next day.


part 2:
-------

(dialing.. don't forget *67)

cs=cyber shadow, trip=trip, mom=trip's mom

mom : hello.
cs  : yes, is <trip's real name> there?
mom : hold on. ... <trip's real name>!@#!@
cs  : hello?
cs  : hello, this is phoenix tty, i'm jeremy landovich, i'll be your tty
      translator.
trip: yes yes...
cs  : i have a call for you from <ewheet's real name>.
trip: yes..
cs  : he says he is at the airport and has a ride to metro center.
trip: oh ok. do you need directions? go ahead.
cs  : no, he says he does not. he has a ride and likes to know where you would
      like to meet him at.. in metro center.
trip: just out of curiosity who is your ride? go ahead.
cs  : a relative.
trip: ahh uhm, how long are you gonna be staying? go ahead.
cs  : a few days.
trip: uhm, how long are you gonna be able to hang out and stay, or for the
      next couple of days? go ahead.
cs  : he says that he will try to stay as long as possible with you but he has
      family business that he has to take care of.
trip: uhm ok, i will meet you in the food court area, it's on the upper level,
      uhm, there is like an arcade and stuff, and a whole bunch of little 
      restaurant areas. i'll meet you there. i'll be sitting at one of the
      tables, near the entrance way. hold on. i'll have on a large pair of
      grey pants and a shirt that says fifteen on it with a boy's face getting
      shot. go ahead.
cs  : ok he says that he will look for you, and he wants you to wait for until
      he gets there because he does not know how long it will take him, but he
      does have directions, and he knows how to get there, and he now knows
      what you are wearing.
trip: how will i identify you in case you don't notice me? go ahead.
cs  : he says he is wearing a green shirt, blue pants, and has blond hair.
trip: are you wearing your hat? go ahead.
cs  : uh no he is not.
trip: when should i leave to go there? because i live like really close to
      there. go ahead.
cs  : he says maybe in a half an hour.
trip: ok i'll go there in a half an hour and you can go with me pants
      shopping. go ahead. ... gotta get pants.
cs  : he says ok.
trip: alright i'll see you in about half and hour or so. go ahead.
cs  : he says see you soon.
trip: ok.. bye.
cs  : thank you.


trip is now under our control. the next part consists of twotone calling trip
up and checking to see if he is really gonna go to metro center mall.


part 3:
-------

(dialing the modem number for poo, which is the whq for apathy and is run by
trip. we were hoping trip would be there and pick up the phone. lucky us.)

tt=twotone, trip=trip

tt  : hey dude, pick up your phone. hey, trip, pick up your phone.
trip: what?
tt  : trip?
trip: yeah?
tt  : hey you wanna doom.
trip: no i'm just getting ready to go down to the mall and meet ewheet.
tt  : meet ewheet?!
trip: yeah, he's in town.
tt  : ohh, dude, how are you gonna talk to him?
trip: he can read lips, and he can kinda talk. and if not, i don't know if he
      has his laptop with him, but he has these wires that like, whenever
      someone says something it translates it into text. and what he types it
      says for him. so it's like really cool and stuff. and he might even have
      a pad and paper with him or something like that.
tt  : yeah
trip: but it will be cool. so, he's gonna be in town for a couple of days if
      <balls wilson's real name> wants to somehow get down here..
tt  : oh.
trip: because i know <balls wilson's real name> and him are good friends.
tt  : ok.
trip: alright.
tt  : alright.
trip: uhm, so if you talk to <balls wilson's real name> tell him ewheet is in
      town.
tt  : ok.
trip: and i'm gonna be hanging out with him today and he's gonna come back to
      my house.
tt  : how long is he gonna be in town?
trip: he said for a couple days or something. i don't know exactly how many.
      but he lives in ohio.. so.
tt  : shit
trip: alright dude well, i'm gonna finish cleaning up a bit and i'm gonna down
      to the mall and meet him.
tt  : ok.
trip: alright dude?
tt  : later.
trip: later.
tt  : bye.


this whole prank ended with trip going down to metro center and waiting for
ewheet. this has to be one of the all time best pranks since trip thought i
was really a tty operator, and everything worked out perfectly.

if you would like to be pranked by any member of cds, then send me your
number. or if you would like to call up a mattress expert, dial 1-800-matress
and ask for john.


=[interview with a virus coder]==========================================[cs]=

i was fortunate enough to interview a virus coder about the new michelangelo
virus, known commonly as mich96. here is the short i/o saga...

an idiot named i/o wanted to get on my board. twotone and i had called up
i/o earlier that month to interview him for a zine called 3600. of course i/o
fell for it and said pretty much that he was an idiot, and had no idea what
he was doing. (i/o sounds real funny on the phone. twotone asked i/o if he was
a faggot, and he replied "heeeeellllll nooooo..." it sounded like he wasn't
sure.)

i felt sorry for i/o. someone had told me he wanted to get on my bbs so bad,
that was all he ever talked about. i eventually let i/o apply and watched him
dink around on my bbs.

the first thing he did, while he was on, was upload a file called rgmaint.com,
which is supposed to be a variant of the old rgmaint.com that rewrote a
section of the rg overlay file. then he had the nerve to put his name on the
program. (because we all know that i/o didn't write a trojan or a virus.)

he also uploaded a file called "mich96.com" that was supposed to be the new
michelangelo 96 virus.

i couldn't stand it anymore. i had to break into chat with him and see what
his problem was. this is a piece of the chat i had with him..

[i/o had just uploaded the source code to rgmaint.com.]

cs: and you said you wrote that?
io: i used a gen then i modify that with bits and pieces of other things.,
cs: so you know assembly?
io: Little here little there...
cs: do you know the difference between "modifying" and "writing"?
io: Yes i should have put modified.
cs: you look very lame when you put your name on someone else's work.
io: True...
cs: and i know for a fact you hexed out the mich96..
io: Nope.
cs: then you wrote it all in assembly?
io: Nope...have the Sourse of The origanal mich. and put in MODIFIED BY: $#%
cs: hmm. what does the modified version do?
io: I told 3600...
cs: well i want you to tell me!@
io: ok, i just modified it more so that it would kill f-prot and thunderbolt,
    etc. and unload Vsafe from mem. then after it writes it self to mbr is
    totall fuckes up the disk on 02-14 instead of when ever.
cs: hmmm. and what part did you write?
io: the part where it fucks f=prot etc. and vsafe..and the mbr part.
cs: hmm. because i was wondering what the memory address identifier was for
    vsafe. what is it?
io: damn...i have to look at my source code file thing it is on Encrypt. Hd.
cs: uhm ok.. how does it disable vshield?
io: it goes it to the memory and wipe out the address givven,
cs: hmm. and it restores the memory back to the system?
io: Right.
cs: hmmmmmm. how does it fuck up f-prot?
io: When f-prot runs into it it "wipes" it out of existance.
cs: how does it beat the scan?
io: It finds where F-prot loaded into memory and wipe the mem.
cs: so if f-prot is loaded into memory, it crashes back to the os?
io: Yes.

[this is where i begin asking the bullshit questions. it is obvious he is
lying to me.]

cs: so the mich96 also deletes the efa in memory?
io: i would suspect i have not run it on my puter...:)
cs: it might.. i'm not sure, that's why i'm asking you these questions. uhm
    what happens to the 16k memory blocks? do they get moved back into xms or
    do they swap to disk?
io: If my mem serves me right it goes back to xms.
cs: oh ok, i see. hmm. this is very interesting. i've never really talked to a
    virii programmer.
io: Just a lil here and there...
cs: hmm. well i have lots of questions. the mich96 infects the last 20 bytes
    of the com file like the old one did, right?
io: Yes it is all the same but w/ my modifications.
cs: oh ok. yeah, i understand. hmm. how does it infect the .exe files?
io: EXE ok, thinking...first u have to know the area that exe file start...
    oops that is sys...fuk can;t member.
cs: hmm. what happens to the bios? does it get rewritten also?
    what i mean is, does it get modified?
io: I don't know w/ my modifications it might not.
cs: cuz i think the old mich did that..
io: It might like i said i really didn't "test" it on  a puter.
cs: hmmmm. does it hide in cmos memory so it doesn't get erased when the
    computer shuts down?
io: Yes that code should still be in there.
cs: what part of the memory, the beginning or end?
io: i think the end.
    am not sure.
cs: oh i see. yeah, i was wondering how big the mich is once it launches into
    memory? do you have an estimate?
io: it should be then same size as the old one in mem.
cs: really? so the code you wrote is so small that it doesn't even take up a
    kb of memory?
io: Hell no...not even close...
cs: that's really kewl. yeah, you will have to send me the source code, i am
    very interested.. i like looking at virii. (especially modified virii.) so
    where does the mich96 hide in conventional memory?
io: it should in theory load normaly like the old one...
cs: and the 12k block of memory is given back to the system? (or atleast
    that's what the os thinks.)
io: Yes.
cs: jeah, that's what i thought. hmmmm. i wonder if the mich96 mutates each
    time it spreads to a new .exe or .com file? does it change encryption?
io: I tried to put in a better encryption but it wouldn't accept it.
cs: why not?
io: STACK error or some shit like that.

[by now i knew he was lying. no virus writer on earth would even act the way
he was. naturally, being the nice guy i am, i decided to give him some help
with his virus. (of course, my help is wrong.)]

cs: you know, you can create more stack space.. i think. like tell it:

    .stack
    .stack
    .stack
    .stack
    (for as many 1kb as you need)
io: C00l, i wanted it to use the same amout just use my modifications.
    c00l, but i am more into hacking....:)
cs: uhm, so what all does the mich96 do when the alarm goes off?
io: that is when the fun starts the MBR get trashed....then the hd get fucked
    like normal) and then it in theory, unloads and dissapers.
cs: does it still spin the hard disk backwards and grind the head like the
    old mich did?
io: Yes..
cs: hmmmm. did you change any part of that?
io: Nope i liked that part.
cs: does the mich96 run under linux or unix?
io: To my knolege it might.
cs: hmmm. uhm, what about SwanOs unix versions?

[not sunos, but swanos.]

io: Not sure,,,in theory is should take out any and all puters in its path.
cs: and you wrote this in pascal right?
io: ASM
cs: hmm. what version of assembly? bearland?

[not borland, but bearland. hahaha.]

io: TASM borderland.

[now he thinks borland is really called borderland.]

cs: what version?
io: hold on will check..
cs: ok
io: 2.01
cs: borland is the author of tasm, right? or was that microsoft?
io: Borderland
cs: oh, yeah, i keep spelling that wrong. hehehe. hmm. oh, i remember now,
    does it infect the sfx cluster on the hard drive also? i've seen alot of
    virii do that. it's pretty tricky tho.
io: Not to my knowlege but it might.
cs: damn, cuz that is hard to repair. does it delete all four of the dos
    partitions too?
io: yes. and i could make it blow up the cpu if i wanted it to.
cs: how?
io: MOV DS,DS
cs: what does that do?
io: that is not accually cpu regs. but it would move the ds reg over itself
    over and over....till is blows.
cs: hmm. have you tried that yet?
io: no but i am thinking bout it.
cs: what kind of processor does it destroy? the 8078?
io: The main 80x86
cs: oh, what about the p7, p6, etc?
io: u mean the NPU?
cs: i was just wondering what kind of instruction set the processor needs?
io: oh, it will work with any and all.
cs: what is the npu?
io: Co-proccessor.
cs: oh, i see. hmmmmmmm. what else have you done? like what systems have you
    hacked? etc.
io: So far only 1 but i don't need to hack unless the sysop pisses me off..
    but this 1 was for fun he was sitting there watching me...
cs: what system?
io: A RG BBS
cs: so what was the system called?
io: 19th Hole gone now...but i got his sys Pw and droped to dos...i could have
    stole the users.dat and called them all up.
cs: hehe, that would have been great. how many users.dat files do you have?
io: None but can get First Onlines. but what would be the point..
cs: yeah, trooper is a kewl sysop. that wouldn't be right. did you hack
    knight's realm (starman's board) also?
io: Fuck StarFUCK...he is an asshole most of the time.
cs: are you gonna hack it?
io: Am on the verge of it...
cs: how are you going to do that?
io: using gSZ or DSZ or some prot...
cs: but what will that do?
io: Drop me to real dos and then del the users.dat after taking it and del the
    logs.
cs: but how i mean, how can you make dsz do that?
io: A simple hacking util.
cs: which one?
io: HAKBBS??.zip
cs: oh, sounds interesting. so does it only work for rg bbses?
io: Nope any and all that use .COM prots.
cs: hmm. what does it do to the internal prots, like the ones ra uses?
io: That might be a prob for certian prots but any w/ a COM file will work.
cs: oh ok. can you upload that file?
io: Don't have it it is on I-net tho.
cs: where on the i-net?

=[how to make exploding bullets]====================================[trooper]=

How to make exploding bullets
by trooper

Cartridge reloading skills are common knowledge... Get a cheap setup for about
100 bucks, and RTFM. The manuals are very conservative, and following simple
instruction will save you from having a face that looks like your ass. For
those who are unsure of what a reload is: It is a spent cartridge which has
been re-assembled to meet factory pressure and dimension specifications, for
use in a specific firearm. (Or: Home made bullets for yer gun.)


What you need:
--------------

[1] A reloading press. (A cheap LEE loader piece of shit is fine.)
[2] A grain scale or spoons. (Available at gun stores everywhere.)
[3] Gun powder. (Available in 1œ canisters for about 15 dollars.)
[4] Cartridge die set. (Duh- that is the same caliber as your weapon.)
[5] Primers, brass and bullets for the weapon.
[6] And a fucking gun... Large caliber revolver, ie: .38-.45LC works best.


Keep in mind- the assembled product is not a good choice of ammunition to
carry in the car if you are pulled over for some reason. There is a little
known, but strictly enforced law, called the 1934FLA, which outlaws
destructive articles such as explosive devices, automatic weapons and even
nunchuki! No shit...

For this example, we will use the .38 SPL. round. you can use it in a .38 or
.357 revolver or rifle, which makes it a good "all around" choice.


1) Recover spent brass from your favorite spot after a fun day of embedding
   lead into the side of a hill, or car door. (Damn neighbors!)

2) Re size and de-prime the case with your press setup. (You don't really
   need *any* reloading equipment for this project, but your cartridge will
   be a piece of shit, and will not feed reliably if you use a pin and
   pliers to manufacture the round.) Use a strong pin, or nail set to drop
   the spent primer if you are broke. Fuck re sizing it too for that matter,
   the cartridge will fit without re sizing in most cases, with a little
   applied force. (Cram the fucker in the chamber.)

3) Set a new primer. (A .38/.357 takes a WSP small pistil primer, they are
   sold in 100 unit packs, for about 1.80. (More on those later.) Without a
   press, simply force the primer in the flash hole with your finger, and
   beat it flush with the pocket, using an insulated handle of any given tool.
   (To prevent beating it to shit.) Try and get the primer in straight.
   Primers are very stable, and chances are that it will not explode. If it
   does, well... deal with it. Your ears may ring, and you will get minor
   flash burn, but that's about it.

4) This load used a 158GR. Hornady or Speer HP-LSW (Hollow point, lead
   semi-wadcutter) bullet. You may go the quick and dirty route, and simply
   buy a box of lead hollow point rounds also. (If you know nothing about
   reloaded ammunition, this is probably a good idea.)

   Why a lead hollow point?

   They are very easy to work with. The hollow cavity is all ready centered.
   this saves you the chore of trying to find the bullet's dead center, and
   using a 175" or .210" drill bit to do the same job.

The internal diameter of the HP cavity needs to be .175" or slightly larger.
This is the same diameter of the primers you purchased. The depth of the hole
is directly related to the type of warhead you desire. A simple cap insertion
will only need to be as deep as the primer's height. (3/16")


Various types of exploding projectiles:
---------------------------------------

A: Insert a primer in the modified cavity, so the bottom of your primer is
   faced out word. This setup will impact, make a little "POP" on impact, and
   fragment the ogive of the bullet slightly. (The Tip will frag.)

B: Same as above, with a small amount of gunpowder under the primer. This will
   increase the report of impact, in addition to adding a visible flash when
   the bullet detonates. (Good for setting off flammable devices at safe
   range... Try a small can of Gasoline for a target... Or a good friend's
   vehicular fuel tank. (For example.)

C: If you need a little AP capability with the device, drill the hole quite
   deep..3/8 to 1/4 inch. Insert the powder, primer, and a .177 caliber steel
   B.B. This will not only guarantee detonation or the primer; It will also
   act as the initial piercing function of the round. for best results, wrap
   the primer/BB group in Teflon tape. This will serve a dual purpose:
   Containing the primer/BB group, so maximum damage is achieved through
   penetration. Adding a lubrication substance to the round, so it will glide
   through materials like Metal, Nylon or... Kevlar.

Tech Note: The density of steel is greater than lead. Even if the bullet
deflects or fragments on impact, the inertia of the primer/BB group will still
penetrate deep within a given target. Since the Teflon tape will nearly
liquefy under extreme heat, it will act as a lubricator for the Primer/BB
group as it passes the barrier...  Since teflon reduces friction, momentum of
the BB is stable, and less inhibited.

Force the group into the cavity with your seater die, or just get creative and
ram it in there. Ammunition is highly stable, but as an added safety, do this
force feed with your bullet OUTSIDE of the case if you're reloading it; Or,
with factory ammunition, put a good layer of cloth under the case, so the
primer has some cushion when you're sticking the shit in there.


For the reloaders:
------------------

.38 Spl: 158gr LHP-SWC   4.3 to 4.5 Gr. Unique   or: 4.6 to 4.9 Gr. of Herco.
Light-Medium crimp, OAL: 1.460" (1.480 max.) Win or CCI Std. Pistol Primer.

.357: 158gr LHP-SWC (Use JHP with your own load data) 5.5 to 6.0 Gr. Unique.
Light-Medium crimp OAL: 1.570" Max  Win/CCI Primers


For the Quick and dirty:
------------------------

Purchase 158 Gr lead Semiwadcutter Hollow points from UMC or Winchester.
The loads will be ready for step 4a,4b & 4c.

If you do not have Gun powder, or are afraid to buy it from the local store,
use .22 rimfire cartridges or those firecrackers you've been saving.
Disassembly of a .22 RF is very simple and safe. Grab the lead bullet with
a pair of pliers, turn the bullet sideways while holding the rim of the
case. Pour the powder out, and use it. Remember: The .22 case will still
have a live Primer charge in the rim... You can do hasty blast caps with
them, but more on that later...

You have assembled the cartridge, and are ready to employ the device.
Remember, the bullet is top-heavy now. The maximum range will depend on how
well you did the job. After about 30 -50 yards, the projectile will begin a
terminal Yaw, and "key Hole" the target. This is a sub-standard situation,
as the device may malfunction if impacting sideways. You can determine the
maximum effective range in the field.

These rounds may be assembled with any caliber from 9mm to 454 Win. Mag.
Semi-auto weapons may not feed properly. Single loading may be needed. *DO
NOT!* go too crazy with 9mm rounds... The chamber pressures are easily changed
with extra bullet weight. Best bet: Never buy a semi-auto hand gun, unless it
is a .45  (More on that fact later.)


=[how to hook your phone up to a recorder]===============================[cs]=

how to hook your phone up to a recorder.


introduction
------------
hooking up your phone to a recording device is a must for phone prankers. this
device could be used as black mail, self protection, or to record your sick,
perverted prank calls.

one thing that i cannot stress the most is "do not have your phone plugged in
when you begin splicing wires!" if you touch negative and positive you will
get an enlightening experience. (the phone line is about 3 volts.)


material needed
---------------

one phone 
one speaker jack plus terminal strip (radio shack cat. no. 274-620a)
one 6-ft. (1.8m) audio cable (radio shack cat. no. 42-2444)
two 100k ohm resistors (cat. no. 271-1131)
two wires (red and green preferably)


step 1
------

inside the receiver part of your phone (the part you talk into) there should
be four wires that connect to four different connections.

 top view looking into open receiver
 
 .---------------.
 |   .-------.   |  you are going to connect the negative and positive wires
 |(1)|       |(2)|  (green and red) to (1) and (2). 
 |   |speaker|   |

 |   |       |   |
 |(3)`-------'(4)|
 `------| |------' 
        | |
            

step 2
------

connect the green wire to the ground connector and the red wire to the
positive connector on the speaker jack plus terminal strip. you may need to
solder it together (so you don't have a loose connection) and make sure the
positive and negative do not touch. don't forget to add the resistors or you
will get unpredictable results. (maybe when the phone rings it will give your
stereo an enlightening experience..?)

      to receiver
        ^      ^
        -      +

        |   | 
   =====|===|=====
   .....-...+.....  <--- speaker jack plus terminal strip
   =====(   )=====


step 3
------

now take your 6-ft of audio cable and plug one end into the speaker jack plus
terminal strip, and plug the other end into your stereo. (usually mic in.)

step 4
------

pick up the phone and dial someone you don't like. pop a tape into your tape
player and hit the record button. now you can prank the hell outta your victim
and play your work back later for your friends.


the end
-------

now that you can prank your worst enemies and best friends, make sure you tell
them where you learned how to make one of these phone recorders. don't forget
to scream "cds!" before you hang up with each of your phone prank calls.


=[how to make one fuckin rad ass bomb]========================[brain smasher]=

                how to make one fuckin rad ass bomb!!!
                        by the brain smasher


this bomb takes some time to build, but it will be well worth it! lets just
say when we built this bad boy and it blew up, we went back to look pieces of
it and there was absolutely nothing left!


you will need the following:
----------------------------

[1] epoxy resin (preferably 5 min or faster set time.)
[2] 2 washers (smaller the hole in the middle the better.)
[3] gun powder (the really fast burning kind.)
[4] cannon fuse or home made wick
[5] bb's from a bb gun or pellets
[6] door knob (like the ones at school, with a round type handle and only one
    opening. usually they are on the inside of the classroom.)
[7] mcdonald's drinking straw


the first thing you need to do is get all the above supplies. gun powder can
be made (not recommended though), or bought at a sporting goods store. epoxy
resin can be bought at a hard ware store or hobby store. washers again at the
hardware store. bb's at a sporting goods store. door knobs are the main
ingredient for this bomb. you will need to find a certain kind of knob that  
looks like this:


                             ,------,
                             [ []   ]  <--- against door
this is a lock thing. -------->[]   ]
this holds the knob to the   /       \
locking mechanism. just    /          \
press this in with a flat /             \   basically this is supposed to be
head screwdriver and     [               ]  round, but as long as it doesn't
pull on the knob it      [               ]  have a keyhole at the end it will
should come right out    [               ]  work.
                         \               /
                          \            /
                            \        /
                              \----/ <----- no keyhole, very important!


now, with the door knob handy, place it in a vise or something to hold it
while you work. start mixing up the epoxy resin and place liberal amounts on
the sides of the neck portion of the knob. get the appropriate size washer and
place it into the hole of the knob. you might need to have a second pair of
hands to hold the washer in place while the epoxy dries. place the washer in
like so:


                             ,------,
                             [E    E<---- epoxy resin 
               washer ------->******]
                            /E      E\
                           /           \
                          /             \   
                         [               ] 
                         [               ] 
                         [               ]  
                         \               /
                          \            /
                            \        /
                              \----/ 


now, with the washer epoxied, start to make your fuse. or if you already have
some insert it into the hole all the way to the bottom. cannon fuse is the
best here because it is waterproof, and it burns from the inside--not the out.
to put it into perspective if you threw the cannon fuse into a bucket of
water, it would still keep burning. so you can also place epoxy around the
fuse and it will still work.


you have 3 options:
-------------------

 1. get some cannon fuse and use that for an igniter.
 2. make your own fuse.
 3. buy some rocket engine ingiters! this is fun! you know the Estee's Rocket
    kind is about $2.00.


option 1: cannon fuse
---------------------

                               F
                               F
                             ,--F----,
                             [E F    E<---- epoxy resin
               washer ------->**F****]
                            /E  F    E\
                           /    F       \
                          /      F       \   
                         [       F       ] 
                         [       F       ] 
                         [       F       ]  
                         \        F      /
                          \       F    /
                            \     F  /
                              \----/ 


after you insert the cannon fuse, start to fill the knob with gun powder and
the bb's:


                               F
                             ,--F----,
                             [E F    E<---- epoxy resin
               washer ------->**F****]
                            /EggFggggE\
                           /ggggFggggggg\
                          /ggggggFggbbggg\   
            gun powder ---->gbbggFggggggg] 
               &         [gggggggFggbbbgg] 
              bb's       [ggggbbgFggggggg]  
                         \ggggbbggFgbbggg/
                          \gggggggFgggg/
                            \gggggFgg/
                              \----/ 


take the knob, filled with gun powder and bb's, and fill the rest of the neck
area with tons of epoxy resin. place the second washer thru the fuse and on
top of the first washer. make sure you completely seal the inside cavity in
the neck with epoxy, and seal the top washer on also.
                         
                               
                               F

                          /ggggggFggbbggg\   
            gun powder ---->gbbggFggggggg] 
               &         [gggggggFggbbbgg] 
              bb's       [ggggbbgFggggggg]  
                         \ggggbbggFgbbggg/
                          \gggggggFgggg/
                            \gggggFgg/
                              \----/ 


let this dry and then you are ready for some fun.


option 2: home made fuse
------------------------

make your fuse (since this isn't a file on how to make a fuse, i won't go into
it. you should know how to make one anyway.) before you drop in the fuse, cut
the mcdonald's straw about two inches in length, and then put it through the
first washer, and epoxy it into place. the straw protects the home made washer
and makes sure that the bomb will go off, and that the epoxy doesn't stop the
flow of the wick to the gunpowder.

                               
                     straw --->SFS

                            /EgSFSgggE\
                           /ggggFggggggg\

               &         [gggggggFggbbbgg] 
              bb's       [ggggbbgFggggggg]  
                         \ggggbbggFgbbggg/
                          \gggggggFgggg/
                            \gggggFgg/
                              \----/ 


option 3: rocket engine igniter
-------------------------------

these are great for igniters. they look something like this:


                             0<------- igniter catches fire for a brief second
                            / \        and then glows bright red.

                          [     ]<--- wires


just place this in instead of the wick. then when you are ready to use, just
hook up the igniter to a car battery, or some other type of battery.


                           to battery

It's just like Christmas!!!
-The guide to breaking into someone's house


ANYONE WHO GETS IN TROUBLE FOR THIS...IT'S THEIR OWN DAMN FAULT.  CDS AND
MYSELF ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYONE WHO GETS ARRESTED OR IN TROUBLE FOR 
TRYING ANYTHING LISTED IN THIS FILE.


So...your "friend" has a few things at his house that you like, eh? Well this
is exactly how you "borrow" them.

What you need is: [1]  mace--3 parts alcohol
                             1/2 parts iodine
                             1/2 parts salt
                             (not real mace, but it does the trick)
                  [2]  bb/pellet gun
                  [3]  ice pick
                  [4]  thick gloves

Ok...Now that you got the shit you need it's time to "borrow" those nice items
that your "friend" has.

1. Call the house and ring the doorbell a few times to make sure they're
   not home.

2. If they're gone, you've hit the jackpot!

3. Jump the fence into the back yard (or if the gate is unlocked that may
   be easier) whatever!

4. Oh shit! You didn't know they had a dog! I guess that's what the mace is
   for, eh? Just give him the mace and he'll leave you alone for a while.

5. Put the gloves on (if you haven't already).

6. Shoot the bb gun right above the window locks.

7. Push the ice pick through the hole (made by the bb gun) so you can unlock
   the window.

8. GET IN!!!

9. I recommend going to the bedroom first and getting a pillow case to put all
   your new toys into. And then hit the living room (there's cool shit there!)

10. Put the loot in the pillow case and get the phuck out! !*FAST*!

note: You should know what you are looking for and where it is before going.
       
      Never steal from your own neighborhood.
       
      If the house has an alarm...phuck it! Don't even try getting in!
      .
      .
      .
      .
      .
I hope you have fun with all your new toys!

Oh yea...One more thing I didn't really write this, some dude name Jim Meeker
did. Laters!


=[a short beige boxing story]=========================================[satan]=

Imagine this... another friday night with a few friends, no beer, and no
drugs. Boring right? Only boring until I busted out my beige box and other
boxing shit. 

Then the coolest beige boxing adventure started with me, Son of Sam, and 
another cool friend, who doesn't bbs, but drives. We started out at this one
losers house. This dude was about as cool as Missy...yes that bad. This dudes
name was John Knapp. (I forgot his number) Mike, the dude driving, got into a
fight with him earlier and beat his ass, and this John dude said he won and
was talking total shit about Mike.. so, we decided to beige box his house. 

When we got there, there was two telco boxes on the side of his house. That
confused me. Here's a 'lil ascii of what i saw:

        |-----------|
        |           |     |----|  I first opened the box on the left and saw
        |           |_____|    |  a normal telco box, so i started to hook up
        |           |-----|----|  the wires to the line. When I didn't get a
        |           |      ||     dial-tone, I got really confused. Then I
        |-----------|      ||     noticed a line running out the side. I 
            | |            ||     followed the line to a small 'lil box with
            | |            ||     the US West logo shit on it. So I popped the
            | |            ||     cover off and saw a similar sight. The only
            | |            ||     reason I can think of this is happening, is
                           ||     he lives in an older part of the
                                  neighborhood, so his telco system might have
                                  been outdated.

We then did our ring of numbers, calling 900's, pranking people (Missy was
in there of course.), and annoying a few select operators, we called the most
expensive party line and just left it off the hook. then we kicked back, had
a few beers and cigarettes, and I started to play with his sprinkler box. I
soon figured out how to use it and began turning it on and off. Then I set it
to start at 4am and go for 24 hours. man, that was fun. I then started to open
up his fuse box and played a 'lil bit in there. I found some more nifty things
to fuck up on the side of his house too. I ripped open his cable wire running
to his house, but I didn't wanna touch it or cut it--just in case. 

Then, we got fucko freaked out when we heard a gate/door open up. We booked it
back to our car and I dropped the fucko phone in the street and started to go,
but waited to see who it was.. it turned out it was a false alarm. So we went
back and called the operator. I said some shit in Spanish and she put me
through to the mexican operator. Since my Espanol vocabulary is limited to
'fuck you, dirty spic' and 'I want to mow your lawn for a beer', that
conversation didn't last long. I called back and tried to call friends, but
they were all asleep. So, I decided to prank Missy again. I called and got her
dad. I told him that i was receiving prank calls from his house. He then told
me that he was getting the same problems. I told him that if they didn't stop,
I would go over there and beat his ass. He then blabbered about how he was
gonna get the call traced and call the pigs. I told him to fuck off, and go
rape his daughter; He got mad and hung up. We then dialed some strangers and
harassed them. No big deal. We then left. Before we left i busy boxed his
house. 

We were so jittery, we went looking for some j0lt. No one had any, so we got
some Kick and went home. that was the most fucked up beige run i have ever
done... We got fucko scared cuz we kept hearing shit.

Just for yer enjoyment, here's a list of some good numbers to call.

1-602-938-7458          Missy Gilliland. tell her you want to fuck her up the
                        ass.
1-900-eat-butt          One of my favs. ($3 a min i think)
1-900-fuck-you          Gives you some more porn numbers.
1-214-618-8869          Just call it sometime and harass the people. :)

Those are a few that I call. I had one that cost $25 a call. For real. I will
dig it up and put it in another edition of cds. Till then, later.
