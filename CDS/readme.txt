children of a dying sun news
----------------------------
children of a dying sun is undertaking major construction. if you are looking
for the coded version of this issue, you won't find it. so don't ask me for
it!@#

one of the reasons i did not code this issue is because of the article
quality that eventually e-mags put out. i won't give any names, but i have
seen e-mags get close to death with the article substance while the code
quality increases. i'd rather have good articles over good code.

but, there will be an annual coded e-mag that will come out every so often. i
am not going to give out any dates as of yet, but expect to see a coded issue
soon. for now i plan on releasing single articles rather than entire issues.

if you have something to complain about, <cough>, then leave me email at:

sirbob@juno.com

other than that... enjoy.
