i have gotten several inquiries regarding who the leader of cds is. well,
that's a tough question. to answer: I AM NOT THE LEADER OF CDS, I ONLY EDIT
THIS ZINE. i started this zine and i make the final decisions for this zine,
but i do not run the group. i would have to say that everyone in cds is equal.

if you would like to get in touch with any of the authors/members of cds
individually instead of having to bother with me, then look below. i'm sure
that the other members of cds would love to hear from you.

pharcyde : pharcyde@bigfoot.com
zatan    : zatan@juno.com
undertow : [not disclosed??]
macwerm  : macwerm@hotmail.com
clark    : stargazr@imap1.asu.edu
j-dog    : j-dog@juno.com
cs       : sirbob@juno.com

and yes, i know, pharcyde changes his e-mail address each issue. i'm guessing
he's either carding his accounts or trying out providers.

[--part one--] [ the wit and wisdom of cs ]

i think the title says it all, this is just another intro. not much has
happened in the ever quiet 602 scene; the secret service gives us a call
every now and again, operators are filing complaints against an unknown and
ever growing gang named cds, and the readers of cds just can't get enough of
us.

i'd now like to take a moment of your time to show a little bit of my poetry.
these are two simple rules that every good phreakER should follow:

 never call a number twice
 unless you plan on acting nice
 don't ever hack a digit code
 sequentially or in a row

if you say that poem to yourself atleast three times a day you can be sure
that the police will go away.

anyway.

wouldn't it be neet0 if i wrote a war dialer? then i could name it neet0 and
it would do neet0 things. it would scan neet0 numbers and hack neet0 systems.
plus it would run from a neet0 script language. neet0.

if you would like to help design neet0, fill out the following infoform and
send it as e-mail to sirbob@juno.com.

---[ neet0 infoform ]---------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. i am an excellent coder and would like to submit some of my sample code for
   cds to review.

   [ ] yes, i code in both c++ and assembler
   [ ] no, i only know quickbasic

2. i am an art fag and would like to draw ansi for neet0.

   [ ] yES!
   [ ] nO eYE dONUT kNOW hOW tEW dRAW

3. neet0 should be run by an oop script language. (instead of running commands
   through a dos/windows command line, neet0 will be run from a script
   language giving the phreakER complete control.)

   [ ] yes
   [ ] no

4. neet0 should be unix compatible.

   [ ] yes
   [ ] no

5. should neet0 have fossil driver support? (such as x00, bnu, etc)

   [ ] yes, and hardware support too!@
   [ ] no

6. should neet0 be named "neet0"?

   [ ] yes

7. the source code should be released with neet0 so i can modify it and put my
   name on it.

   [ ] yes
   [ ] no

[--part two--] [ me and zatan harass kevin ]

due to popular request i have put an average conversation between me and zatan
in this issue. kevin begged us not to put the chat in this issue but we just
told him that CDS OWNED HIM and he didn't have a say in it.

zatan: hello?
cs   : this is cyber shadow.
zatan: hah4HAHAhAHaHaHAH! I AM SO ST0NED RIGHT NOW.
cs   : what are you doing?
zatan: oh man, me and my friends just beat the shit out of some telco guy.
       then i looted his truck and got another lineman's handset.
cs   : really?
zatan: yes... haHAHAHhahahHA. i'm harassing some dude named kevin on my other
       line.
cs   : who's kevin?
zatan: i don't know. HAHAhaHAAHahaHA. i just picked him out of the phone book.
cs   : put kevin on three way. i wanna talk to him.
zatan: ok

[clickety click click click]

kevin: ...and stop calling me day and night!
cs   : hello?
kevin: WHAT?!
cs   : is kevin there?
kevin: now who the HELL is this?
cs   : my name is anthony!
kevin: well anthony, WHAT do you want?
zatan: hAHAHaHAHAHAHAhaAHAHAHAH!!@#
cs   : i wanted to know if you live at 3489 w lynan?
zatan: haAHAH. i'm sooooooo st0ned.
kevin: you fucking punks, i'm calling the police right now.
zatan: we OWN the police.
cs   : kevin, would you pay for cds if it was mailed to your house?
kevin: cds? oh shit, i've heard about you guys.
zatan: we are not elite, we just have nothing better to do.
kevin: i'm sorry, i didn't mean anything i said. go ahead and call me all you
       want. here's my work phone number, and ALL my credit card numbers and
       calling card numbers.
cs   : too late kevin, CDS OWNS YOU.

[clickety click click click]

zatan: haHAHAAhaHAHA!@$!@
cs   : i just pulled all of kevin's info. his social security number is pretty
       easy to remember too.
zatan: oh geez. haHAAhaha.
cs   : anyway, you wanna trade toneloc logs?
zatan: yez. i have 30 exchanges done.
cs   : i made everyone at my work setup toneloc on their home computers and
       scan for me.
zatan: haHAHAHA. i'm about to pass out. i need to go.
cs   : ok bye
<click>


[--part three--] [ feedback ]

you'd be surprised at what people are saying about cds. i had the fortunate
opportunity to record conversations and statements of the following people.

"thanks to cds i'm now a big time courier for risc!" -BLaDE_DCC

"i've never read it and i already like it." -victimNET sysadmin

"who are those bastards that keep tagging CDS on our pay phones? we've tried
tracing their calls but they always seem to divert. NOT EVEN ANI WORKS!@# it's
hopeless... we'll never catch them." -uswest

"i\\\ tpye jsut fnie!!!!" -thndrbolt

"CDS DOES NOT OWN ME!" -mžriLyn

"when can i get this CDS tattoo taken off my forehead?" -anthony

"sorry, cds is already being used: cds@victim.net" -victimNET

"z3r0 d4y cds??? y3s!" -dinchak

"at first i was excited when my name was published in the phone book. it was
the greatest day of my life; it said to the world: i am independent. i am man.
then cds came along and destroyed my life. they said i was a completely random
victim and that they held no grudge against me. this is what i get for being
in the phone book. <sob>" -kevin

believe it or not cds finally got an ftp distro site. this time it's for real
too!#

ftp       : ftp.openix.com
directory : /ftp/phorce/cds

and as always you can give the support bbs a call:

name      : the shadow of cyberia
numb0r    : 602-451-8564

[if you would like the new user password for soc then leave e-mail at
sirbob@juno.com asking for it.]

as an added feature you can now call the support bbs and d/l all the back
issues of cds without having to apply as a new user first.

login     : cds
password  : issue reader

---

if you would like to apply as a distro site then fill out the application that
came with archive and send it to sirbob@juno.com immediately.

==============================================================================
one day i was sitting down frying my brain cells to a nice crisp when the
phone rang. (whoa) it was macwerm. he was flipping out and screaming. i
guessed that he either dropped some bad acid or that he just had the worse
experience of his life. then he went on to tell me that the secret service had
just called his house and left a message on his answering machine. the message
said that macwerm generated some credit card numbers and did something to
the internet provider dancris.com.

the first thing that i thought was that someone may be pranking him (it's fun
to pranx0r macwerm). then i asked for the number that the secret service left
on his machine; it was a 640 prefix, which is an fbi and secret service prefix
in 602.

that blew me away. he told me that his mom was on the phone with the agent.
hmmm, i thought, why would macwerm get busted for carding? he told me he
hadn't used a fake cc for about 6 months. then i remembered that i called him
about 3 days previous (on my cordless too... i must have been smoking crack)
and told him that i found an old log of mine from an auto-parts store and had
several working credit card numbers from it's database. so why hadn't the
secret service called me first? then my line rang:

me  : hello?
them: hello, may i speak to zatan?
me  : i'm sorry but he died in a car accident two days ago.
them: i am sorry to hear that.. may i speak to zatan's dad?
me  : i'm sorry, he died too.
them: then who am i speaking to?
me  : this is zatan's ghost.
them: well this is agent rick hambrick from the secret service.
me  : oh i see.. why are you calling?
them: well, it appears that zatan has been using stolen credit card numbers to
      buy drugs.
me  : oh, this is his father.. lemme tell you how much trouble he is gonna
      get in over this.
them: i thought you were dead?
me  : not anymore...
them: ok. we will have to visit your son to talk to him and make up lies about
      him so that he can get his computer taken away.
me  : whatever..
them: thank you for your time.
me  : fuck you nigger.
<click>

(wow. that was a close one.) then i remembered the little gt me and macwerm
had with gail thackery at our school. so i picked up the phone and dialed
1411 and got an operator. here's what happened:

op: this is a bitchy heroin-addicted operator, how may i fuck up your call?
me: yes i need the number for gail thackery; i'm going to call her and social
    engineer her info out of her. (read cs's article on how to do this =])
op: hold please...
op: i'm sorry, she isn't listed.
me: well, i know yer lying and if you do not give me her number i will destroy
    yer life.
op: oh really!?#$?!@# and how will you do that?
me: yer phone number is 938-7458 and you live at 7708 W Villa Theresa Dr, and
    yer name is missy gilliland..
op: HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT!@#$!%%^
me: give me her number bitch or yer life is over.
op: [gail thackery's number here]
me: thank you. have a nice day.
<click>

after that i decided to give my good friend a call and see what she was up to.
here's what went on:

me : hello. may i speak to gail thackery please?
her: this is her.
me : hello my name is KEVIN and i would like to know what the fuck is going
     on.
her: if you are going to harass me then i will hang up. i work for the
     government and i know how to press *69.
me : shut up bitch. i am beige boxing from the fbi headquarters.
her: oh i see. what are you talking about?
me : my friend just got a call from one of your pals down at the secret
     service and i want to know why.
her: who?
me : his name is peter bishop.
her: ohhhh... ok. well it appears your friend used some credit card numbers to
     buy a 256k simm for his mac.
me : hmm. well, i would like you to know that it was really me that did that,
     and he had nothing to do with it.
her: ok, may i have your name and address please?
me : why sure. [i give her kevin's info]
her: ok. i will get back to you.
<click>

(oh man, what fun.) i then saw a white van pull up into my driveway and two
choppers fly over head. i grabbed my hard drive and was going to cram it into
my microwave when 10 SWAT team members flew through my windows and wrestled me
to the ground. they took my hard drive and sat me down on the floor. i sat
there for three hours while they went through my room grabbing all of my
illegal things. they also raped my dog and made me watch; I WILL NEVER BREAK
THE LAW AGAIN.

i was then taken down to uswest's headquarters in phoenix. when i got to the
parking lot they blindfolded me and put me in a car. we drove for awhile and
then it felt like we were moving underground. they took the blindfold off and
i was in a dimly lit cave. there were tv's all over the place and a whole shit
load of tape players and cd recorders. i heard about 1000 phone conversations
going on at once, so i guess they were monitoring everyone's phone
conversation.

then i saw the root of all evil sitting behind a huge computer terminal
furiously typing on a keyboard. he turned to me and introduced himself as the
person who "looks over everything." i introduced myself as the person who
"hacks into everything." he laughed briefly and then took me into a small room
where he began interrogating me. he asked questions like "do you work for
japan?" and "are you a russian spy?" i told him no. this went on for many
hours. he eventually gave up and left. i went over to the only exit out and
tried to open the door. it was locked. i then pulled out my secret lock pick
set from inside my shoe and picked the door.

i snuck back into the main room with all the monitors and tape players and
was surprised to find two guards with assault rifles. they immediately noticed
my arrival and told me to put my hands behind my head. i then busted out with
my ereet zok ninja skillz and kicked their ass and locked them in the room i
had just snuck out of.

seizing the moment, i searched around and found a disk that said "pbx codes
and local test numbers." i grabbed it and threw it into my pocket. i then ran
to the elevator and saw a keypad that activated the door open mechanism. shit,
i thought, how will i get past this?! all the hacking stuff i had ever learned
was about to aid me in my greatest escape. i typed "12345" and the door
opened! i went up the elevator and hopped into a uswest van and drove into the
wild blue yonder.

when i got home i called macwerm on the phone. he told me that his mom was
going to ship him to a private school in england and that he would never see
a computer again. (oh well)

oh yeah. i forgot all about the disk i got. here is the directory tree of it:

666[ article : introduction to social engineering                         ]666
666[ author! : cs                                                         ]666
==============================================================================
welcome to the exciting world of social engineering. there have been several
frequently asked questions (faq) and text files written for social engineering
in the past, but most seem to be outdated. i do not guarantee that what you
read here will work 100% of the time; some methods have already been raped and
abused to a point of total destruction in certain parts of the globe. that is
why i have written this introduction: so you don't have to dive into the
phreaking world with a telco blind fold.

this tutorial demonstrates methods designed to aid your phreaking (and often
hacking) career. i have divided this article into 9 different sections, as you
can see below:

 1) looking up someone's information
 2) getting information over the phone
 3) creating internet accounts
 4) sysops and sysadmins
 5) scanning (frequency and phone)
 6) trading with friends
 7) further reading

if you are a beginner then i suggest practicing on hapless victims that happen
to be listed in the phone book. just call them up, tell them some bullshit
story, and see if you can get them to tell you anything worth while. (it's
also good to see if you can make them tell you their address, phone number,
etc and then check back in the phone book to see if you have a match.)
naturally, don't blame me or cds if you get a call from the phone company or
police department for harassing.


THE THREE RULES OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING <-- very important, do not skip this
part or you will regret ever being born.

 rule #1: always stay ahead of the conversation. if you let your opponent or
          victim start asking you questions then you have already lost the
          game.

 rule #2: you must sound convincing at all times. if your opponent or victim
          starts to doubt your authenticity then you might as well give up.

 rule #3: never let your guard down. if you think that you have become a god
          of social engineering, you will have a rude wake up call someday and
          have the feds knocking at your door. cover your tracks!


WHAT IS A HARMONIZER/VOICE CHANGER?

invest in a harmonizer if you are a serious social engineer. if you are not
good at tripping your voice out (ie making it sound deeper, higher, etc) then
you will most definitely enjoy using a harmonizer. there is no operator in
their right mind who would seriously believe a person who sounds like they are
12 over a person who sounds like they are 60.

[see the "further reading" section for harmonizer ordering information.]
  

YOU MISSED SOMETHING!

yes, you are absolutely right, i did miss something. and that something is
how to card. the reason i didn't put it in here is because carding has been
written about a thousand times by a thousand people. my advice to you is if
you want to seriously get into carding to get on an ftp site and download
every old and new carding text and read them. then go into #hack and start
asking around for help with carding. (well the #hack part is a joke. hehe...)

                               
---> now on with the show...  O/

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
looking up someone's information                                        part 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the easiest way to get someone's information once you know their full name is
to dial information and ask an operator. of course information won't always be
able to help you. now, thanks to the internet, you can look up someone's
information with the click of a button.

what happens when you ONLY have a phone number, but know nothing about the
person who owns the line? reverse phone books are great to have laying around,
but are difficult to come across. some "look up" programs on the internet will
allow you to do a reverse search by using the phone number instead of a name,
city, state, etc. and information operators won't always help you out, but it
never hurts to try.

here is a classic conversation between me and an information operator:

[ring... ring...]
operator: information. what city are you calling from?
cs      : new york, the city that never sleeps.
operator: how may i help you?
cs      : <big sigh>i'm searching for my long lost brother. we were separated
          at birth. just recently i got a mysterious message on my answering
          machine and they ONLY left a phone number. i've been calling the
          number but no one is answering. could you PLEASE tell me the name of
          the person who the phone is registered to?
operator: we aren't allowed to do that...
cs      : <crying>but he's my brother! both my parents are dead. he's the only
          family i have!
operator: well, i ok. i'll help you out this one time...

never argue with an operator. be nice to them so they give you what you want.
i know you're saying "BE NICE TO AN OPERATOR?!" and i agree it is a strange
concept, but that's what social engineering is all about. you are pretending
to be someone to get something. there will be plenty of other opportunities to
harass an operator.

after going through all that and ending up empty handed, it's definitely time
to give the CNA a call. i'm not about to go over CNA procedures here so you
might as well download an old text on it. this is only an introduction and if
you're calling up the CNA you might as well consider yourself above a novice.

getting information over the phone                                      part 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
and now for the real stuff. this is what social engineering is all about: how
you talk, how you act, and how you handle yourself. this section is divided
into four separate sub-sections:

 - lying
 - threatening
 - posing
 - reminiscing


[ section 1 ] [ lying ]

this is the easiest way to get information out of someone. everyone can lie,
and almost everyone can do a decent job at lying. lying is a broad subject and
generally fits into most social engineering areas. it is here only to remind
you that when you are socially engineering information out of your victim you
MUST ALWAYS LIE.

this is a true conversation of me and a guy named mike dietz. i'm putting it
here to show how easy it is to take advantage of someone with a little bit of
lying.

[ring... ring...]
md: hello?
cs: hi! remember me? i'm the guy that writes about you in cds.
md: <terror in voice> WHAT DO YOU WANT?
cs: i just called to apologize about all the mean stuff i've been doing to
    you and was wondering if you want to be my friend?
md: really?
cs: yes, i'm VERY sorry. <cough>
md: so you wanna hang out?
cs: actually, now that we're friends, what's your password on your bbs?
md: i use the same password on both my internet account and my bbs.
cs: well what is it?!
md: my password is "porno".
cs: thanks. and no, i can't hang out... i have to go and hack a bbs.
md: WAIT! let me tell you about my new porno tape i just ordered!
<click>


[ section 2 ] [ threatening ]

threatening, at times, can be very productive. if your victim has a clue they
will generally not fall for your devious schemes. but, on the other hand, if
you happen to be one of those people with a natural terror in your voice you
will most definitely succeed.

some things to remember when you are threatening your victims:

 - make your voice as demanding and terrifying as possible
 - do not threaten people from your home phone (threatening someone can be
   serious business)
 - sound convincing and stay ahead of the conversation
 - don't rush through your scheme, take your time
 - have everything setup first before calling your victim (nothing sounds
   worse than a threatening prank gone wrong)

below is an average threatening prank. this is only a basic example and in
reality would be much longer.

[ring... ring...]
victim: hello?
cs    : there is a bomb in your phone.
victim: what?
cs    : i am going to set the bomb off unless you give me your credit card
        numbers NOW!
victim: who is this?
cs    : i am a terrorist.
victim: i don't believe you.
cs    : just look out your window, that's me in the car.
victim: ahhhhhhh!
cs    : NOW GIVE ME YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBERS!
victim: please don't hurt me. here they are...


[ section 3 ] [ posing ]

the following irc log is true and really happened. this is a good example of
how to pose as someone else after your opponent thinks that you are
bullshitting them.

*** Whois Information for: blondfrog
***   Address     : Frog@line122.ebtech.net
***   IRCNAME     : I'm not telling

<blondfrog> why are you giving me a hard time
<blondfrog> i just emailed him last night
<turb0> i'm not giving you a hard time. i'm just trying to figure out what you
        need to ask robert
<blondfrog> i don't think its any of your business what we talk about
<turb0> have you ever met robert?
<blondfrog> no
<turb0> do you want to meet him?
<blondfrog> none of your business
<blondfrog> i said i wasn't home when he came here
<turb0> he's been talking about you
<turb0> said something about e-mail.. can't remember what exactly
<blondfrog> good try but i am far from stupid
<turb0> are you afraid to tell me your name? i'm going to tell robert about
        this.
<blondfrog> go for it
<blondfrog> but it doesn't concern you
<blondfrog> he will know who i am
<turb0> i'll make sure he doesn't give you what you wanted.
<blondfrog> i don't want anything
<turb0> oh really?
<blondfrog> just to touch base and say hello
<blondfrog> really
<turb0> that's not what robert said
<blondfrog> whats up your ass anyway?
<blondfrog> are you a female?
<blondfrog> jealous maybe
<blondfrog> good try
<turb0> i love robert and you can't have him
<blondfrog> but our conversations aren't like that really

<turb0> i know what you are trying to do!
<blondfrog> well for your info then....
<turb0> robert loves me too.
<blondfrog> he came to my hometown

[florida... shot in the dark.]

<blondfrog> nope
<blondfrog> your where? texas
<blondfrog> are you male or female?
<turb0> why do you keep wanting to know if i am male or female
<turb0> i've never been "hit on" in this place. hehe
<blondfrog> b/c your acting like your jealous
<blondfrog> thats not what i am doing
<turb0> i don't think you really know robert. if you did you wouldn't be
        asking me these questions.

pharcyde knows all about ordering services for people's phone lines. this is
how he poses to get anthony three way calling.

[ring... ring...]

pharcyde: 555-1234
operator: are you over 18?
pharcyde: yes i am.

pharcyde: thanks!


[ section 4 ] [ reminiscing ]

what's better than posing? reminiscing. it's fun to pretend to be someone's
old time friend and listen to them squirm uncomfortably because they just
can't remember who you are. what a great time to take advantage of them!@

[ring... ring...]
missy: hello?
cs   : may i speak with missy?
missy: this is her, who is this?
cs   : don't you recognize my voice?
missy: no.
cs   : oh. haha. this is fredrick von phreakyertelco.
missy: who?
cs   : remember me? we went to school together! i would always give you those
       catsup wrappers at lunch.
missy: uhm...
cs   : you said you loved me! and i thought you cared about me?
missy: [short pause] oh! fredrick!
cs   : yeah, that's me!
missy: what have you been doing lately?
cs   : well i work for a credit card company now.
missy: which one?
cs   : all of them. i have no life so i can work 24/7.
missy: that's interesting.
cs   : i saw your name come up on the computer. i've been thinking about you
       for a long time, and just got your number.
missy: really?
cs   : yes! but i gotta do my job real quick. can you read off your credit
       card numbers so i can confirm your credit with us?
missy: sure, hold on a second.
       ok, here they are... [she reads off ALL her credit card numbers]
cs   : yep, just as i suspected. you're account is fine.
missy: that's a relief.
cs   : so you wanna go out to lunch sometime? i'll pay, i just ran into some
       money.
missy: sure, when?
cs   : i don't know. i'll give you a call later. bye

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
creating internet accounts                                              part 3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
everyone wants to own their own piece of the internet. very few are unaware of
the simplicity and steps necessary to steal a shell account from an internet
provider. put away your hacking toys and forget your unix login defaults.
using expert persuasion even you can become a proud owner of a shell account.


[ step 1 ] [ creating i-net accounts ]

the very first step in getting an i-net account is to find and use the
information of a pre-selected victim. look in your phone book and choose
someone completely random or choose someone that you dislike. below is the
information that is generally asked for when applying (so expect it).

 [] first & last name
 [] address
 [] zip code
 [] phone number
 [] login
 [] password

if you happen to be a passive individual and do not want anyone to pay for
your account, or want only the internet provider to pay, then make up fake
information. accounts created with fake information generally last longer
because the bill gets lost in the mail.


[ step 2 ] [ creating i-net accounts ]

now that you have your account information and have practiced repeating it
over the phone (this is so you sound like you are who you say you are) then
call up your target internet provider.

for this example lets just say you choose to call victimNET. here is a sample
conversation of an account application.

[ring... ring...]
victimNET : thank you for calling victimNET. would you like to sign up for an
            account?
cs        : yES!
victimNET : what city are you calling from?
cs        : phoenix
victimNET : what would you like to use as a login?
cs        : hax0r
victimNET : and what would you like to use as a password?
cs        : 666cds
victimNET : would you like to hear our current prices and rates?
cs        : not really.
victimNET : well how would you like this account billed? credit card, checking
            account, or invoice?
cs        : hmmm. that's a tough decision. i can't seem to find my credit
            cards and my bank account is empty, so i'm gunna have to choose
            invoice.
victimNET : can i have your name please?
cs        : jerry farr
victimNET : what is your address?
cs        : 1234 east oak street
victimNET : and your zip code?
cs        : 66666
victimNET : what city did you say you were calling from?
cs        : phoenix... can't you remember anything?
victimNET : what is your phone number?
cs        : 555-8989
victimNET : ok sir, your account will be ready in about 2 to 4 hours. do you
            know what number to call to login?
cs        : yes... i've been stealing accounts from you guys for years!@
victimNET : what version of windows do you use?
cs        : i don't use windows, i use a terminal program in dos.
victimNET : do you even have windows installed on your computer?!?!
cs        : nO! the only reason i ever had it on my computer was so i could
            use a wardialer that only worked under windows.
victimNET : if you had windows then you could download the latest version of
            netscape from us. you'd like the internet in colors.
cs        : oh well...
victimNET : thank you for calling. enjoy your new account.
cs        : EYE W1LL ENJ0Y IT!@#
<click>


[ step 3 ] [ creating i-net accounts ]

a few last minute pointers.

[] *always* ask for invoice when given the option. invoice accounts will last
   the longest and will keep you out of trouble with the law. the worse that
   could happen is being stalked by a bill collector from hell. and having
   credit fraud put on your permanent record isn't exactly the easiest way to
   get a job later on in life.

[] sound convincing when making the account. make them believe that you are
   who you say you are. and if possible, recite your information to yourself
   beforehand so you are familiar with it. remember that if you live at 1234
   east oak street you aren't going to say "well uhm... i live at... hold, i
   dropped my paper... ok, i live at 1234 uhm west, no wait, east oak street."
   also, make your zip code consistent with your street address and city. i've
   run into a few internet providers who actually have software on their
   computer to check if your zip code matches your city and street address.

[] it is not smart to make an account from your home phone. sysadmins have a
   tendency to KNOW where you are calling from. but it is alright to call the
   account from your house once it has been broken in. this is because you
   can always claim: "well i talked to a guy on the irc who gave me the
   password to the account." i seriously doubt a sysadmin would believe that
   story if you made the account from your home phone. be aware that you are
   not always safe.

[] don't worry about your target internet provider tracing your calls, that
   is, if they do they can't do much. most providers don't even have the
   capabilities or know people at the phone company to pull your information.
   they'd rather just delete your account and forget it ever happened.

   but on the other hand you can never be sure unless you know all about your
   target internet provider. that is why research is important. it is also
   smart not to look suspicious or the sysadmins will check up on you and most
   likely find out who you are (see above). something to remember is not to
   mess with a sysadmin unless you know who they are first. 

   one of my friends got his info pulled by a sysadmin who later called him up
   and asked for the cracked passwd file that he stole. they didn't do
   anything to my friend (they even offered him a job) but they now have his
   home phone number and personal information and are watching him every
   single day of his life. (and btw, sysadmins like to read your e-mail too.)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sysops and sysadmins                                                    part 4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
socially engineering sysops and sysadmins is the most entertaining and
enjoyable thing to do in the entire world. not only do you get to humiliate
them, but you also have the opportunity to find out their vulnerable info,
like where they live, what they like to do on the weekends, etc.

lets pretend that there is a bbs called genocide, a totally random bbs picked
of course. the sysop is pissing you off and you'd like to get onto his system
to harass his users and basically trash everything. unfortunately you don't
know the new user password. it's a good thing that the sysop, who we'll call
dinchak, is always sitting at his computer terminal ready to break into chat.

but the question arises: how do you make dinchak chat with you? he's been
harassed numerous times and fears the bbsing community. here are a few basic
ideas to make the sysop break into chat:

 1) if the bbs has a shuttle menu with a chat option then use it.
 2) if you can leave the sysop e-mail then continually leave messages like:
    hello? hello? hello? hello? hello?
    i need to talk to you!
    warez
    CDS OWNS YOU
    dinchak, i know you are sitting there watching me...
 3) call back continually until dinchak takes his modem off the hook or chats
    with you.

great, dinchak finally broke into chat with you. this would be a typical
conversation:

dinchak: this is the sysop. what do you want?
me     : i was trying to figure out your new user password.
dinchak: who are you?
me     : my name is chris nowak and i found your number on the internet. i'd
         like to become a new user here.
dinchak: well chris, i'm sorry but i can't let you on here without the new
         user password. do you know it?
me     : i'm not much of a hacker, although i did bring nasa to it's knees. i
         was about to run a script to hack your new user password but i
         decided not to. i REALLY love your bbs.
dinchak: thanks.
me     : and if you let me become an active user on here i promise i'll upload
         warez day and night. if you like i can get an isdn line and hook it
         up to both your computer and mine to transfer warez at the speed of
         light!
dinchak: i dunno, you don't sound too reliable. this is not a warez bbs you
         know.
me     : hehehe. i get it, if you want to test my warez knowledge go right
         ahead. i know what RiSC stands for.
dinchak: ahhh... so you do know what warez are.
me     : yes, and i can get zero second zok warez!@#
dinchak: YOU CAN GET ZOK WAREZ?!?!?!
me     : yep. :)
dinchak: WOW! i'm sorry i kept you waiting. i'll let you apply.

now, once you are on the bbs, what next? dinchak obviously trusts you and
expects you to contribute to his bbs. he understands what ZOK represents in
the warez world and feels that if you can get zok warez then you are a god.
with all this into consideration it is time to pull out your favorite fake
warez generator and make a few dangerous games to upload.

after you have made a 10 meg game and placed a trojan in one of the
executables (that will destroy his h/d) upload the fake warez to his bbs and
tell him it's the latest version of lemmings. dinchak loves lemmings and will
be over joyed.

uhh oh. you forgot one thing: dinchak's voice number. good thing he's always
sitting at his computer ready to chat with you.

dinchak: you paged me?
me     : yes. are you interested in becoming an official zok distribution
         site?
dinchak: this is a dream come true!
me     : i just talked to the head senior and he thinks that your bbs would
         make a great addition to zok.
dinchak: what do i need to do?
me     : do you mind if i call you voice to talk about this further? my wrists
         are kind of sore from getting warez off the irc all day and my eyes
         are burning from staring at this 64 inch monitor.
dinchak: my voice number is 555-9876.
me     : i'll call you right back.
<click>

great! dinchak has fallen prey to your social engineering. it's time to give
him a call and see what he's up to.

[ring... ring...]
dinchak: yoe, this is dinchak.
me     : hey dinchak, i just chatted with you on your bbs.
dinchak: ok, so how do i become a zok distribution site?
me     : i'll have one of the zok seniors call your bbs...
dinchak: c00!
me     : so tell me, what internet provider do you use?
dinchak: i use victimNET.
me     : really? SO DO I!@#
dinchak: kewl, what is your login?
me     : root
dinchak: mine is dinchak@victimNET.com
me     : did you know that they make you put in a number first before your
         password on victimNET?
dinchak: no they don't... well, not on my password.
me     : what's your password?
dinchak: my password is "warez"
me     : hmm. well my password is "666CDS".
[mom   ] DINCHAK GET OFF THE PHONE AND COME MASSAGE MAWMY'S TOES!
dinchak: uhhhhh, my mom is yelling at me, i need to go now.
me     : bye
<click>

that was fairly easy... now that you have a shell account on victimNET it's
time to give them a buzz and tell the sysadmins exactly what you think about
them.

[ring... ring...]
victimNET: thank you for calling victimNET, how may we provide shitty service
           for your hard earned money?
me       : i'd like to speak with a sysadmin.
victimNET: one moment please.
[good music]
sysadmin : this is god, what can i do for you?
me       : hi, my name is dinchak and i'd like to know why you keep bestiality
           pictures in your shell?
sysadmin : [long pause] who the hell is this?!
me       : EYE SAID MUH NAME IZ DINCHAK!
sysadmin : hold on here buddy, how do you know i have bestiality pictures?
me       : i am an eleet unix hax0r.
sysadmin : are you saying that you hacked us?
me       : hahaha. i like the picture of the horse and the chicken.
sysadmin : you fucking punk. i'm going to trace this call right now.
me       : you can't trace this call.
sysadmin : why?!
me       : because i'm calling from inside this building!
sysadmin : what are you trying to pull?
me       : i was wondering if you can get me zero day porn?
sysadmin : ahh fuck you asshole. yeah that's right, fuck you like i fuck your
           mom.
me       : you have such a dirty mouth. i'm glad i recorded this conversation.
           i'll be glad to broadcast it on my pirate radio. maybe i'll send it
           to your boss...
sysadmin : you're going to regret this call.
me       : come and get me big boy!
<click>

geez. the sysadmin sounds pretty upset. it's a good thing you were calling
from dinchak's telco box outside his house; when they call you back they'll
get to talk to dinchak.

now for your last and final sysadmin/sysop humiliation. you just heard from
a friend that tweety (the victimNET sysadmin) is on the irc. using dinchak's
account you logon to victimNET and get on the irc.

<dinchak> i would like to give you some.
<tweety> you would? =]
<dinchak> sure. as a matter of fact here's my voice number. give me a call
          so we can talk about this further. my voice number is 555-9876.
<tweety> yeah i'll do that.
<dinchak> oh geez. i just remembered! my mom's using my voice line right now.
          you'll have to wait until she gets off before you can call me.
<tweety> here, just call me when your mom gets off. my number is 555-6666. i
         really need that porn.
<dinchak> sure will.
*** Signoff: dinchak (sucker...ahahhaha)

this was a great expedition. not only did you take advantage of dinchak but
you took advantage of a victimNET sysadmin. and having both their numbers
will come in handy for future harassing. don't forget to mention to them that

scanning (frequency and phone)                                          part 5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if you are a regular reader of cds then you most likely saw zatan's article
on frequency scanning in issue #5. if you didn't, then i shall recap. scanners
can pick up many interesting things such as fbi, fire/emergency, air planes,
and cell phone conversations. scanners are fairly inexpensive and can be
bought at places such as radio shack. if you enjoy listening to people talk on
the phone, and/or enjoy listening to personal information being given out over
the air waves (such as cc numbers, phone numbers, etc), then you should
definitely look into getting a scanner.

but what does owning a scanner have to do with social engineering? great
question.

here's the scenario. your neighbor, a few blocks away, just bought a portable
phone. this particular neighbor has been irritating you the past few months
and you feel it's time to repay the neighbor's hospitality.

with your scanner you can tune into their phone conversations and listen to
them stupidly give out their personal information.

[ring... ring...]
at&t : ding ding ding. AT&T!
missy: beep. [she pressed zero]
at&t : this is an underpaid at&t operator just waiting to fuck up your call.
missy: hi, my name is missy and i am having problems using my calling card
       number.
at&t : what is your calling card number?
missy: [she reads it off]
at&t : well the card is good. what kind of trouble are you having?
missy: i dunno. i'm stupid and can't use a touch tone phone.
at&t : i see... well i'm about to take a lunch break so i'm gunna have to hang
       up on you now.
missy: wait!
<click>

scanners are VERY useful. in the above example missy has told you her calling
card number and you didn't even have to ASK for it. it can't get any easier.

what about phone scanning?

that's another good question. since the advent of computers and phone, people
have been using the two interchangeably to do their bidding. for example, if
you needed to find a phone number in the 602 area code, and knew that the
particular number was in the 240 prefix, you probably wouldn't dial each
number starting from 0001-9999 on your phone. how would you solve this
problem?

if you were stupid you would ask your friends to dial the numbers for you,
while you dialed, so you could cover a larger area in a shorter amount of
time.

but since you are smart you have decided to get your favorite war dialer and
scan the 240 prefix, making your computer do all of the work for you.

what are some good war dialers to get started with?

toneloc
bluebeep
general dialer (thc)

is it illegal to scan numbers?

illegal is a broad term. if you were to get a call from a police department
they would inform you that you had dialed a number, and the occupants of the
number's residence are pressing charges against you for harassment. on the
other hand, if the phone company were to call you up they would ask you to
stop dialing numbers sequentially. for example, if you were to dial a business
suffix that was 1100-1200, then the phones in the building would ring one
after the other. (another reason to ALWAYS scan at night...)

a simple rule to remember when scanning: never call back unless you are
hacking their codes.

trading with friends                                                    part 6
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
trading with your friends is not only productive but gives you a warm feeling
inside knowing that you are giving out information about the phone company,
someone you dislike, or anything else that may be of importance.

[ring... ring...]
zatan: hello?
cs   : hey man!@#
zatan: hahAHAHaHAHAHAHA. i'm ALWAYS stoned.

zatan: sure... what do you want to trade for it?
cs   : you still have that list of pbx numbers and codes?
zatan: yah, haHAHAHAHAHhahA, but only about 30 of the codes work now. i burned
       out 15 of them last week.
cs   : ok, i'll stop by your house and trade you for them tonight.
zatan: alright.

the next irc capture isn't exactly a friendly trade but you get the idea. all
is fair in social engineering.

josh: i've never heard of that before. is it fast?
cs  : fast?! it's so fast you can load windows in under a second!
josh: <enthusiastic> well what do you want for it?
cs  : i'm looking for a nice little setup: a 17" monitor, about a 166 pentium
      processor, motherboard, 32 megs of ram, a tower case, and a keyboard.
josh: i have a computer just like that... but it's mine. i don't think i
      should trade it.
cs  : that's too bad, because this chip has a built in modem and can do
      calculations at the speed of light.
josh: sounds great! i will trade!      


the point of all this is to use your head and make others do things for you.
why should you scan for numbers with your dialer when you can make your
"friends" do it for you? after all, they are fascinated with the word
"phreaking" and would love to learn as much as possible. besides, there are
hundreds of idiots floating around that happen to have a code, number, or
something of value that they'll trade. happy trading.

666[ article : millenium pay phones                                       ]666
666[ author! : macwerm                                                    ]666
==============================================================================
the big question everyone is asking is what are millenium pay phones? this is
a short info article that will give you an overview of uswest's brand new
toy.

if you live in 602 or have uswest as your bell i'm sure you have seen a
millenium pay phone; they are black and have yellow trim. they have a large
LCD display that supports about 2 or 3 lines of text at a time. they can be
spotted at almost every new gas station, restaurant, and are virtually the
only thing uswest installs for pay phones anymore. (i especially see them at
circle k.)

[ a glance at the hardware ]

millenium pay phones are basically shitty personal computers. when the phone
is opened there are two vertical circuit boards with a 1200 or 2400 baud modem
inside, and a special type of ram. i'm almost positive that they have their
own operating system produced by uswest.

[ what kind of security do millenium pay phones have? ]

there is a keyhole on the left side of the phone and on the right. when the
linesman inserts his key on the left, he gets a prompt on the LCD display. he
must then enter the uswest universal code for the city (i believe) and then
his two digit PIN number. after that, he inserts another key into the right
side of the pay phone and the whole cover pops down (not to the side). when
the phone cover goes down, the linesman has 5 to 10 seconds to press a switch
or button that is in the top center back of the phone or an alarm goes off at
the switching station and/or the millenium phone patrol. (he can then do what
ever and i'm sure there is some kind of hardware he can attach for
diagnostics.)

to remove the cash box the tech inserts the key on the left and enters the
code and his PIN. he then uses his T key which he inserts into the T shaped
hole on the front lower right hand corner of the cash box. the cover then pops
down and he can remove the old box and replace it. the cash boxes are bright
orange and very impossible to break open without uswest's tools or techniques.

another thing that i've found about millenium pay phones are that their phone
line is always concealed. not once have i seen an exposed phone line, unlike
some regular uswest phones. i have seen a pay phone which happens to be in the
front of my high school; the phone is about three inches from the wall and the
line goes into the building. if you were to cut a line it would trigger yet
another alarm at the css.

[ some more facts about millenium pay phones ]

 - the dial tone is simulated. the phone is on a normal line and does not
   bother the switch until the money is collected. this means red box tones
   DO NOT work.

 - the look up tables are in the phone proving that they have a modem.

 - these pay phones are able to fix themselves. once after beating the shit
   out of one, an LCD said "this phone temporarily out of service." when
   returning a half an hour later it was fixed. so they might have the ability
   to dial into a repair center and download new software or alert them that
   that the phone needs repair.

   just to show that they love these things, i called the repair number and
   the tech showed up the next day! for home repair it takes them a whole
   week. i'm guessing they cost about 5-6 thousand each.

[ closing ]

most of this information was collected from our nice old linesman that repairs
them at my school--he loves answering my questions. there hasn't been any
known hardware hacks or ways to box calls off of these yet, but i'm still
searching.

==============================================================================
every phreaker's dream is to find a junction box, green tree, etc. these
massive phone boxes are where all the lines from the local neighborhood meet
and connect to the main line under the street that runs to the phone company.
these boxes will look similar to this:

                        ---------------------------
                        |            |            |
                        |            |            | you need a socket wrench
                        |            |            | that looks like this:
                        |            |            |         
                        |            |            |         /====\   
                        |            |            |         |    |
                        |           (*) <- bolt   |         \====/
                        |            [ <-- handle |             
                        |            |            |
                        |            |            |
                        |            |            |
                        |            |            |
                        |            |            |
                        |--------------------------

now, this is how you open one of these bitches up.

(1) first, grab your trusty socket wrench and find the right size socket.

(2) second, place your socket wrench onto the bolt and turn it the right while
    at the same time turning the handle to the left. this should open the
    double doors up.

this same procedure can be used on the back of the box. the back doors don't
hold as many lines as the front but it will make your boxing experience alot
safer.

congratulations, you are now in the box. it should look like this:

          |------------\|-------------------------|/------------|
          |             |*************************|             |
          |             |*************************|             |
          |             |*************************|             |
          |     (*)     |*************************|    (*)      |
          |     {       |*************************|     }       |
          |     {       |*************************|     }       |
          |     {       |*************************|     }       |
          |     /       |*************************|     \       |
          |    ]        |*************************|     [       |
          |             |*************************|             |
          |             |*************************|             |
          |             |*************************|             |
          |             |*************************|             |
          |-------------|-------------------------|-------------|

the little stars are the knobs that have phone lines going to them. on each
door there is a round wire holder that has a fat wire going to an alligator
clip. on this round wire holder there are two sockets that a lineman's handset
hooks onto. next, take the the large alligator clip and hook it onto one of
the knobs; you should hear a dial tone or if your are lucky people talking!
sometimes on the inside of the doors you will see telco notes like pbx
numbers, ani and local test numbers, and other good shit. (maybe even a love
notes).

junction boxing is by far the best way to box. this is complete and total
access to hundreds of lines at your finger tips. good luck and happy boxing!

i know you all missed me in cds #4 and #5 but i don't have access to a
computer very much anymore, and to make it up to everyone i'll explain two
things that every anarchist needs to know.
        
so your good "friend" is still fuckin' with you, eh? well, if blowing up his
pool filter (cds #2) or breaking into his house (cds #3) didn't work, then
it's time to fuck with his car. here are just a few things that you can to do
ruin all the expensive auto detailing he has done.

remove the windshield wiper blades and glue thumbtacks into them. boy does
that make a pretty design!

if you know when your "friend" is about to use the car, simply hold a lighter
underneath the door handle for a long time and wait until he grabs it.
"ohhhh...that had to hurt!" hehe.

take off the muffler and pour about a cup of gasoline into it and put it back
on. when the car starts you'll see one hell of a blow torch.

some classics:

 - sugar in the gas tank
 - stuff rags soaked in gas into the exhaust pipe and wonder why your "friend"
   has trouble breathing.

but the best, by far, would be the one that takes the most time and requires
help from other people. while you're breaking into your "friend's" house to
get their nice stereo why not just take their car apart and reassemble it in
their living room? NOW THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT!

now, if you're too stupid to do any of these fun ideas, try this: pop the hood
open and go "eeny, meeny, miny, MOE!" and just pull something.

there are tons more (like dynamite behind the dashboard, syphoning the gas
into the front seat, etc) but the best ones just come from long, hard
thinking.

but what if your "friend" doesn't own a car? then it's time to torture them
with TEAR GAS! tear gas doesn't require much work to make but it is VERY
dangerous. so be careful because i know how all you dumbasses are.

what you'll need to make tear gas:

 1. ring stands (2)
 2. alcohol burner
 3. erlenmeyer flask (300 ml.)
 4. clamps (2)
 5. rubber stopper
 6. glass tubing
 7. clamp holder
 8. condenser
 9. rubber tubing
 10. collecting flask
 11. air trap
 12. beaker (300 ml.)

other shit you'll need:

 1. 10 grams of glycerine
 2. 2 grams of sodium bisulfate
 3. distilled water

now that you've stolen all the necessary supplies from your local chemistry
department at a school and figured out how to set all of it up, you are ready
to begin.

1) you MUST wear a gas mask at ALL times.

2) in an open area, mix the glycerine with the sodium bisulfate in the
   erlenmeyer flask.

3) light the alcohol burner and gently heat the flask.

4) the solution will begin to bubble; the bubbles are the tear gas.

5) when the mixture begins to bubble the reaction is complete. remove the
   heat and dispose of the mixture. (the mixture must be disposed of because
   it is corrosive.)

6) the material that condenses and drips into the collecting flask is the tear
   gas. make sure it is capped tightly and stored in a safe place.

sorry that i couldn't be more detailed but i'm just as dumb as the next joe
when it comes to setting this stuff up, but you got and basics.

another thing that you could simply do is make an aluminum cup, or half of a
soda can and mix one chlorine tablet with an equal amount of .3 brake fluid,
or motor oil in the cup. then wait about three minutes and you have the "white
death". note: white death is chlorine gas so don't breath too much of it or it
just might kill you or burn your lungs.
        
just remember to always be careful and that cds and myself are not responsible
for your actions; and it's not illegal unless you get caught! latah.

thanks for reading this issue. if you have any questions, comments, or would
like to submit an article for an upcoming issue, you can contact me at:

sirbob@juno.com

the theme for this issue is the number sequence 666. i doubt you noticed 666
anywhere in this issue because it is 666 supposed to be a 666 subliminal 666
message 666. just for the record cds does not worship satan (or zatan) and we
are not a cult, but send your naked women and beer to us so we can plunder and
have our way with.

i know that this issue was long and i apologize for making you read so much.
personally i would rather have a file_id.diz and a little askee with the cds
logo in it. but unfortunately that's not how it works so i guess this issue is
going to remain huge forever.

according to my calculations issue number 7 is next. don't miss it or i will
be forced to hunt you down and show you pictures of people who don't read cds,
and you will surely change your mind about everything.
