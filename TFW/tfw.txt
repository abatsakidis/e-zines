FIRST EDITION JOKE...
OK, there was this duck, and he went into a bar and asked for water.  The bartender told 
him they don't serve water.  So the duck leaves, comes back and asks for some water.  The 
bartender tells him again they don't serve water.  So this happens like 5 more times, and 
the bartender starts getting fed up and says, "I am gonna nail those webbed feet of yours
to the floor if you ask for water again."  So the duck leaves comes back and asks the 
bartender "Do you have any nails?" The bartender replies,"NO! Get out of here." The duck
says,"In that case could I have some water?"

	     thanks to Mr. Skill's dad (aka TRC's Mom) for that one!

This game is exactly like RC Pro AM for the NES or OffRoad at the arcade.  Overall 
the game was pretty fucking cool. You can start on one of three levels and race your car 
from an overhead view, earning money and upgrading your car.  At the end, you get to race
"The Adversary" and then get your name in a top 10 list of racers.  This one kept us 
occupied for hours and hours. A DEFINITE download.  

	Playability -- 97%
		Easy to play easy to understand, win race get money.  Even the immigrants
		in razor could figure this one out.
	
	Ingenuity  -- 90% 
		Been out for other systems, but this is better...newer and CHEESE!
		A better version of OFFROAD.  
	
	Graphics & Sound -- 87%
		Graphics were good, but during the race...well average.  Sound adds to the 
		game.
	
	GamePlay -- 95%
		The game is cool...spent hours and hours and hours and hours....DEATH RALLY
		MUST MAKE MONEY....VROOOM

		     UNCLE HENRY'S PLAYHOUSE (c)Trilobyte [xx/46]
		     It's a horror adventure, not a kiddie game!

This game is hosted by the main character in The 7th Guest.  The Dollmaker has compiled 4
puzzles from each of Trilobytes games (7th Guest, 11th Hour, ClanDestiny) and a few new 
ones.  Nothing exciting, and not too scary.  If you like just playing the puzzles from
7th Guest, you might like this, but for 46 disks....do a crossword puzzle. Good graphics, 
but lacking in game play.

	Playability -- 68.2%
            	The game throws you in a puzzle and expects you to know what to do. 
		It's like throwing frogs in a blender and expecting cream cheese.  
	
	Ingenuity -- 50%
		Well...the DID add a few new puzzles, and they DID put them in a new 
		interface....but hell...

	Graphics & Sound  -- 90%
		Sound was decent...and the graphics are what you expect from trilobyte.
	
	GamePlay -- 80%
		Well...you played 7th Guest it was the same without a story line...wait 
		did 7th guest have one?

Well....if you thought you would get to play soccer, wrong.  You get to manage a team.
Sort of like....sim soccer or something.  You make money in pounds of course and buy more 
guys.  And then buy better guys.  The one redeeming factor of this release is HOSON.EXE.
RUN THIS FILE!
	
	Playability -- 60% 
		The mouse kept fucking up the screen, and unless you have managed a soccer

	Graphics/Sound -- 45%
		Graphics had a major bug with my mouse.  I wouldn't know if I am the only

		This is a game??  You watch these stick figures in uniforms kick a ball

Hmmm, can we say "JUST ANOTHER 3D GAME"?  Well everybody, you know those 3D games that 
we all know so well, guess what...there's another one!  I know, the 4.5 million other 3D 
+games just aren't enough for all you 3D freaks out there.  Calm down, strap on your drool
guards and get ready for some 3D...crap.  This game just doesn't do it for me, and I love
3D games.  You start off as this little submarine thing and then you turn into some walking 
thing...it just sucks.

	Playability -- 85%
		The game itself is very simple to understand except for one aspect, HOW 
		TO GET OUT OF THE LEVEL!  Other than that there are no problems with the 
		game play.  The controls are standard, nothin' all fucked up, the objective
		is just like any other 3D action game, kill everything and finish the level.
	
	Ingenuity -- 40%
		HA...should I even give this thing a rating?  I give you a run down on how
		original this game is.  It looks like a cross between mechwarrior and the
		little mermaid, except there are no other cool machines to kill like in 
		mechwarrior and there are no hot chicks in shell bikini's to stare at like in
		the little mermaid, or was that just me?  

	Graphics & Sound -- 80%
		The graphics in the game are pretty good.  The movement is smooth, unlike 
		alot of the 3D games if you get as good a resolution as this game.  The
		sounds are pretty good.  When you are in the land vehicle the game includes 
		what sounds like heavy machinary, namely your feet, hitting the ground.  I'd 
		have to say that the one redeeming quality of this game would have to be it's
		graphics.  The graphics are the only thing that make this game even slightly
		cool.

	GamePlay -- 55%
		BORING, BORING, BORING, BORING!!!  The game itself is just to BORING to be
		any fun.  There are some good things though, when you kill a shark it's dead
		body floats to the top of the water and there is some blood, but it comes 
		from the fish.  Other than that the only reason to play this game is if you
		like watching nothing happening on the screen and just holding down some 
		buttons.

	OH YEAH -- We forgot to mention that this game only kept ed occupied for about 15 
		   minutes or so, so you can judge from that.

Gee whiz, it's Donald Duck, er I mean "Maui Mallard."  Guess he decided to go incognito
in this platform game which resembles any other you might have played.  The game is easy
to pick up in regards to playability, and the sound and grafix are adequate, so if you want
some brainless fun, it's pretty good.  Jump and shoot, jump and shoot.  Did we forget to
mention it involves a lot of repetitive jumping and shooting.  If you're too cheap to own
a SNES, get it.

	Playability -- 94%
		Up, down, left, right, shoot.  It's that simple. 

	Ingenuity -- 50%
		Wow, a platform game where you hop around and kill things.  Been there, done
		that.

	Graphics & Sound -- 85% 
		Backgrounds are nicely done and scroll smoothly, and the character animation
		is pretty nice.  Sound is average, though not annoying.

	Gameplay - 87%				
		It's like a Nintendo game.  You'll start fiddling with it, and before you
		know it, you'll have been playing it for hours.  Best played while talking
		on the phone, especially when it's CyberPhreak yapping mindless drivel in
		your ear.

Hey kids, can you say "Commercialization?"  Another mindless platform game based off a
movie that already made a billion for Disney.  Not only is it a straight SNES to PC port,
it's not that good.  Sure each mission involves you doing different things, but some of
the missions are asinine, and instead of guiding Woody through them, you'll probably get
bored and play with another woody instead.

	Playability -- 78% 
		Pretty easy to pick up on, but moving around can be a pain in the ass
		occasionally.

	Ingenuity -- 55%
		While it is just another lame ass platform game, it does offer a variety
		of tasks.

	Graphics & Sound -- 75%
		In a small windows graphics looked pretty sharp, but increase the size and
		you pay the price.  Sound is ok, but there's nothing more annoying than
		some idiotic space hero screaming "To Space And Beeeeeyoooonnnnddddddd."

	Gameplay -- 40%
		Well the missions were just well, annoying.  They vary in difficulty,
		though most just fall in the annoying range.  The only one who might find
		this annoying game entertaining is your little brother, or a Razor member.
		Oh yeah, did we forget to mention this game is just damn annoying.

Ah Europe, how we love your charm, your people, your games that look like they were produced
on a $10 budget.  Originally a game for the Atari Jaguar, it's no wonder why that system
was purchased by a total of 6 people worldwide.  It's certainly original, but it's hard
to figure out as you run through screens in exciting 16 color VGA collecting these gremlin
things and avoiding mutants, as you try to get a weapon and do something, we're still not
sure what, with the Doomscale, but we're sure it somehow involves the penguins waddling
around.

	Playability -- 30%
		Well sure it looks easy, and you can walk around collecting and killing
		things, but out of 5 people, no one can figure out what the hell you do.

	Ingenuity -- 99%
		It sure as hell isn't like anything *WE'VE* ever seen.  Only a Euro...
		Must be something in the water.

	Graphics & Sound -- 50%
		Graphics on the title screens are ugly as shit, though once inside the game
		they improve somewhat.  The game didn't utter a sound as we smashed helpless
		penguins to death.

	Gameplay -- 10%
		We had more fun unzipping the game then we did playing it.

Yet another in the long line of Doom clones, only this one allows you to use a car in
addition to the normal "lone soldier" games.  The car handles just like a real car, and
is a neat addition to an otherwise drab game.  Multiplayer is pretty fun, as is typical of
first person shooters, but by yourself, it doesn't really stand out from the pack.  Ed
thinks you should wait for a car patch for Quake.

	Playability -- 70%
		It's challenging to master the controls.

	Ingenuity -- 60%
		It's Doom, but you do get to use a car.

	Graphics & Sound -- 83%
		Graphics weren't anything special, but do eject, it's worth watching.  Sound
		Sound was typical, nothing special.

	Gameplay -- 73%
		Aside from kill, kill, kill we can't figure much else to do, let alone

This is a cool side scrolling 2D beat em up, along the lines of Double Dragon, except this
is set in the middle ages.  Your character, however, has very few different moves besides
his standard slash, so it gets repetetive after a short while.  Graphics were nice, and
the background was richly detailed.  Aside from when you swing the sword too much and your
character temporarily passes out from exhaustion, it wasn't too bad, and it even caught
Ed's interest enough to warrant him playing it.

	Playability -- 85%
		Easy to figure out.  Hack, Slash, Duck, Jump.

	Ingenuity -- 70%
		While 2D beat em ups aren't new, this is the first one set in the middle
		ages that we've ever seen come out for the PC.

	Graphics & Sound -- 88%
		Nicely done character anims (the characters are digitized) and backgrounds,
                and it flows smoothly.  Sound isn't too bad, there's not really a score
		playing, just background sound effects to add to the environment.  You even
		hear the sound of your heart beating.

	Gameplay -- 64%
		While for the most part it's simple, there are some tricky jumps and
		maneuvers that are a pain in the ass.  It also gets boring after a very
		short time.

Well, um, to put it frankly, I fell asleep while playing this.  It's just another one of
TalonSoft's long line of Battleground titles where they like change the maps and text
between each one.  There are about 6 zillion buttons and stuff to choose from, so unless you
are about 60 and feel like messing around with this, we'd avoid it.

Everythning a gambler could want is here from card games, to slots, to roulette, etc.
This is definitely the best casino game we've seen (if you can call casino games good).
You can actually walk around the casino, look at still shots of other people and playing
the games.  Not bad for what it is, but how good do you really expect a game like this to
be?

What a rip!! 5 megs worth of real game, and 50 megs worth of fucking wavs.  If the wavs
were good then it would be ok, but it is cheesy background music...wililam tell overture
or some classical j0nx.  Anyways, 23 disks for this game well....isn't worth it.  Spend 
your time reading the history of the third reich.  It might be more interesting.

		Can't figure out what to do...but from what we saw it SUCKS!  It is an

Well it is a war game.  The graphics are ancient, but big and easy to see.  We played it for

I've talked to alot of people about this game, well actually two others, and both of them said
it sucked.  I had a very different opinion.  The game itself was just another 3D game.  Really
it was just a mix of Mechwarrior and Necrodome.  But even though it was just like any other 3D
game I found it kept me entertained for a couple of hours and I'm still not sick of it.  Once
you get the hang of it it turns out to be an alright game.

	Playability -- 65%
		The game itself wasn't really any different than any other 3D game, but much
		like Mechwarrior it has alot of keys that do alot of different things that if 
		you don't know you die.  I guess a really bad analogy for it is sticking TSR in
		a paper bag and hoping he'll find his way out. (HA...yeah right!)

	Ingenuity -- 30%
		Well, uhhh, sorry, but this is just another Mechwarrior type game.  The only
		original thing that this game had was the enemies, considering the mech 
		scenario.  The enemies are liek bugs and zombies and weird stuff like that....?

	Graphics & Sound -- 80%
		Bah, the game had those Necrodome graphics and the sound was just like every 
		other stupid 3D game.  The only pretty cool thing that I found was the way that the 
		barrels of the machine guns keep spinning, well I thought it was cool, ok?

	GamePlay -- 70%
		Sorry, but I'm not gonna bother wasting my time talking about this game's 
		gameplay.  It was exactly the same as every other 3D action game.  You go 
		around, kill every-body and then go to the next level.  Yeah...
