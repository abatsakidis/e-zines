SECOND EDITION JOKE...
        It was a beautiful day out.  A certain pair of uninhibitted people
        were feeling extra daring so they decided to go out to a field they
        knew of and get naked and have romping, wild sex.  When the couple
        arrived at the field they began to rip each others clothes off.
        Suddenly the woman stopped and said, "Wait, do you have any condoms?"
        The man looked at the woman in disbelief and replied, "Uhhh...no."
        Just then the man remembered that there happened to be a convenience
        store just around the corner.  Without thinking he began to sprint to
        the store not even worrying to get dressed.  As the man rushed to the
        store the woman screamed out behind him, "And get a pack of smokes,
        too!" When he reached the store he asked the immigrant behind the
        counter for a pack of condoms and a pack of cigarettes.  After
        getting what he had come for the man burst from the store, but to his
        surprise there were three nuns walking his way!  The man didn't know
        what to do.  He couldn't let the nuns see him like this!  Then, an
        idea came to him.  The man threw himself back against the wall
        outside the store, ending up right next to the vending machines,
        hiding the condoms and smokes behind his back.  As the nuns got
        closer they noticed the naked figure standing against the wall.  The
        first nun said, "My, my!  They do come up with the strangest ideas
        for these vending machines nowadays!"  Then the second nun said,
        "Hmmm...why don't we try it?"  They all thought this was a splendid
        idea, so they all got out a quarter to use in this new-looking
        machine.  After some deliberation they all agreed that the money was
        to be placed in the "mouth" of the machine, so the first nun put her

        quarter in the man's mouth.  "Uhhh...now what do I do?" asked the
        first nun.  "I think you pull that 'lever' down there," the third nun
        said pointing to his groin.  So, the first nun grabbed a hold of the
        'lever' and began to pull.  Not knowing what to do, the man put out
        the hand holding the condoms.  The other two nuns asked the first
        nun, "So what did you get?"  The first nun replied, "Hey, I got some
        condoms."  Seeing what the first nun got the second nun stepped up to
        the man.  She followed the same process, pulling the man's 'lever'
        yet again.  This time the man put out his other hand that had the
        cigarettes in it.  Again the other two nuns said, "So what did you
        get?"  "I got a pack of cigarettes," said the second nun.  By now the
        third nun was fairly anxious to have her turn at this nifty piece of
        'machinery'.  So she stepped up to the man, put her quarter in and
        commenced pulling of the lever.  Not having anything left to give,
        the man didn't know what to do, so he just stood there.  The other
        two nuns asked the third, "So what did you get?"  Nothing was
        happening so the nun kept on pulling and pulling and pulling...
        nothing was happening.  After a few minutes of yanking on the 'lever'
        the nun exclaimed, "Ahhh...."  "WHAT?  What did you get?" said the
        other two nuns.  "Oh...," said the third nun, "just some hand
        lotion."

Based on an upcoming movie, Space Jam is a basketball game with looney toon
characters.  This game sports some nice graphics, and easy gameplay.  However
we have yet to figure the purpose of the 30 meg sound file since we get no
sound no matter what we do.

        Playability -- 90%
                Was quite easy to figure out to use the arrow/ctrl/alt keys
                to pass/shoot/move.  The characters move like you would expect
                in a basketball game.

        Ingenuity -- 70%
                Seen it before....NBAJAM was the same type of game.  Space
                Jam added something with it's inbetween-quarter arcade games.
                You can play certain games during the breaks, but for what
                purpose we don't know.  It does not raise your score, or make
                your characters better....oh well.

        Graphics/Sound -- 75%
                We were upset that there was a 30 meg file eating the hdd 
                which didn't even give us music.  The graphics were a bit
                blurry, but eye appealing.  There was also 10 megs of
                credits at the end that was totally unneeded unless you want
                to know eveyone who works at acclaim by face.

        GamePlay -- 80%
                Well....it is basketball....games go by quickly...you don't
                get stats and stuff, so it is simple.  inbetween quarters
                there are arcade games with no purpose.  Overall this is a
                good game.

Wow, a really, really good 2D scrolling game!  I haven't seen one of these for
a very, very long time.  Sierra has the right idea.  In the game you are a guy
and some sort of minatuor-type beast, you switch on and off about every other   
level.  The game is really easy to understand and the graphics are very
nicely done.  If you like those great 2D games like Mario Bros. and that type
then this is a definite download.  I downloaded it thinking I was gonna have
another crappy game to review (cough-Mutant Penguins-cough), but to my
surprise the game was great.  It kept me entertained for almost an hour before
I remembered I had reviews to write...you know what they say.  "All play and
no work makes for no reviews."  And I know nobody would want that.

        Playability -- 95%
                This game could be figured out by anybody, and when I say
                anybody I mean a large rock with a piece of wet brocolli
                strapped to it could comprehend the way everything works.
                (But I'm not gonna make any promises to you guys in Razor.)
                I mean, come on, the game feeds you hint after hint on the
                easy level.  In other words, it's VERY EASY to play. (Just
                make sure you check which keys are which in the options!!!)

        Ingenuity -- 85%
                I don't ever remember a game where you were both a human and a
                beast.  I'm sure there were, but I would have to say that this
                is one of the best 2D games I've ever played.  The enemies are
                different from any others that I've seen, and the way the
                levels are layed out is new as well.  It's new.

        Graphics & Sound -- 85%
                The graphics in the game really rocked.  The background was
                cool, and the characters are just awesome!  The sounds were
                similar to other games of the 2D genre, but they were much
                better than the norm.  In general, the game was just cool.

        GamePlay -- 91%
                COOL, COOL, COOL...this is all I have to say.  I thought the
                game was really...COOL!  You have a mission for each level and
                you do it and end the level.  The only minor problem is the
                slight feeling of repetition, but it is very, VERY slight.

If you like to watch a whole bunch of big, hot, sweaty men whose muscles
ripple beneath their spandex outfits while they attempt to make an audience
think that they are really hurting each other then this is the game for you.
Yes, folks, it is the infamous wrestling game released yet again.  This game
has been put out in almost every format, game system, arcade, and now pc...
yeah.(He said unenthusiastically.)  When I downloaded this game I was pretty
sure that I knew exactly what the game was going to be like, but to my
surprise...wait, no, there was no surprise, I was right.  It's the same game!
If you haven't already played this game, or some variation of it, on any other
game system or in the arcade then I don't know where you've been for the past
decade.

        Playability -- 40%
                Hmmm...you don't know what the buttons are, you can't change
                them, and you have no idea what the "special" moves are.  The
                only thing that you do know is that you're supposed to beat up
                the other guy...BUT HOW???!!!

        Ingenuity -- 10%
                HAHAHA!!!  I can't even believe I'm writing anything in this
                section.  Sorry, but it's old.

        Graphics & Sound -- 20%
                The grahics were basically horrible.  It was like the 80's all
                over again.  Uh...can we say VGA?  The sounds were almost as
                bad.  Justa whole bunch of grunting and hitting noises.

        GamePlay -- 25%
                After I had finally figured out the keys and what they did I
                tried to play the game...wow, so much fun.  You have six or
                seven moves that I could figure out, and the computer is
                coming out with all the guns, although that might be six or
                seven moves as well for all I know.  I think I can sum the
                game up in two words...VERY BORING!

The poor polish programmer who left this game to razor in a time capsule ten 
years ago also left a small review which we are lucky enough to have.  We have
included it here....if you can't understand it, you probably aren't polish, 
and hence would not like the game.

This game was a shocker!!  Who would have thought Killer Instinct could be put
on a 2d scroller??  Well this is as close as you will come!  And for 9 disks, 
how could you go wrong?  By the way, if anyone beats Shadow Master's 150 hit
combo, tell him he sucks!! 

	Playability -- 90%
		Change the controls....helps alot.  Other than that, it is 
		easy as can be.  You beat up the bad guys.  

	Ingenuity  -- 83%
		Can't say I haven't seen this type of game before....10000
		times.  There are some new things though.  Like Combos. 
		Best part of the game is doing a 100 hit combo in holo mode!
	
	Graphics & Sound -- 75%
		Could have used some better sound!!  The sound of glass 
		breaking just is not one of my favorite...especially after 
		the 100th time!  Graphics were decent though.

	GamePlay -- 97%
		Awesome game....kept me occupied for HOURS.  Start a combo
		and watch all the bad guys die...fight bosses, move up levels.
		KILLER GAME!

This game is exactly like the one in the arcade where you sit down and have
the steering wheel and pedal.  Except you have a shitty little keyboard...
and less realistic...bleh.

		Without multiplayer...this game just well...sucks.  It is,

		Racing car game #999.  Nothing new here...derived from a 4 
		year old arcade racing game. 

	Graphics & Sound -- 60%
		The Graphics were made in 1992, and the music.bin file that 
		was included did nothing but take up 30 megs.  SFX were 
		nothing special.

	GamePlay -- 55%
		With no multiplayer...this game is boring as hell.  The whole
		fun of the arcade game was that you could crash your opponents
		to hell and back and laugh as they fell behind.  30 minutes
		after you get this game, it will be headed for the recycle 
		bin.

What can I say?  Jane's has made tons of flightsims already, and this one is
no different.  New planes, all true to life.  Can't seem to play the campaigns
in this game though....not like I wanted to.

	Playability -- 70%
		Just like any flight sim...much more fun with a joystick.  
		Shoot and fly around...cool! not.

	Ingenuity -- 50%
		Well I don't see much difference from any other jane's game.
		There was ATF, Nato Fighters, USNF Gold etc etc etc...all the
		same game with different planes. Fun.
	
	Graphics & Sound -- 75%
		They weren't bad...nothing to write home about...the planes

		Maybe I am not the guy to talk about flight sims, but I don't 
		like them.  This has multiplayer mode which is a plus, but 
		unless you buy the cd you can't have any Campaigns. Just

Nice little strategy game based on boat warfare.  You control some cities, and
you move build boats with money depending on your city's income.  Then you 
move around and kill the enemy boats and cities.  Pretty straight forward.

This game has to be one of the coolest games I've played in a long time.  
Imagine a cross between the motion and graphics of Magic Carpet and the idea
of Apache, but better, and you can start to understand the complete coolness
of this game.  You start off the game as a little helicopter and you fly all
over the place killing stuff and picking other stuff up like missiles and
health and cruise missles and smart bombs and ... well the list just goes on
and on.  Then, in later levels you are a little A.T.V. and you go around
killing more stuff, and you can even get into a helicopter from the A.T.V.
and vice versa.  This is a definite download this week!

	Playability -- 89%
		The only things to figure out in the game are the buttons and
		you don't even have to watch the screen that tells you what 
		your objectives are if you realize that all you have to do is
		follow the white arrow on the top of the screen and blow up 
		the things that have the red sights on them.  After you've 
		mastered those very difficult concepts (HA!) you've got
		the game down.

	Ingenuity -- 94%
		There have been alot of games out in the past and alot of 
		them have looked like previous games.  I mean, how many Doom 
		clones have there been?  But this isn't like anything I've 
		ever seen.  The only thing that even comes slightly close is 
		Magic Carpet, but there is just no way you could compare this
		to Magic Carpet...it's just way too COOL!!!
		
	Graphics & Sound -- 89%
		The graphics in the game are just way cool.  The only thing 
		that could have made the graphics any cooler in my opinion
		would have been a graphically rendered sky and the option to
		change views, even though the way the game changes the view 
		is really awesome anyway.  The sounds were great, very 	
		realistic.  There could have been some background music, but
		that would have been a minor request.

	GamePlay -- 88%
		The game itself rocks.  It's a bit difficult at first when 
		you don't really know how badly you get damaged and it gets 
		slightly frustrating because the game is harder than you 
		wold expect when you start, but it just adds to the addict-
		iveness.  Once, I was playing the game and I finally finished
		the level and checked the time on the level and i had been
		playing for OVER AN HOUR!!!

Thank God!!!  I thought that this game would never be fixed and I would have 
to go without playing one of my favorite games in the arcade on my pc, but
that wasn't the case.  This game, originally released in the arcade as Virtua
Cop, is almost the exact same as the arcade except for some minor changes.

	Playability -- 85%
		Point, shoot...it's as easy as that...sorta.  A big problem
		was reloading...we couldn't figure out how, but if we had
		bothered to watch the intro deal we would have figured it out.

		Seeing as though it came straight from the arcade and there 
		have been quite a few other shoot 'em ups...well...yeah.

OH MY GOD....This game sucked soooo bad....it hurt me to play it.  I am told
it is a role playing game, but you seem to float down to the ground where a
guy with a knife starts to slash you to bits while you punch him with your
fist that seemingly does nothing!  When you do manage to land a hit, the guy
screams out in some foreign language.  I ran away hoping the game would get
better, but I just ran into the water got out and suffocated...I dunno why.
