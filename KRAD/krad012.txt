####### Kewl,
### isn't it?

	KRAD is getting back on schedule.  Yes, we'll be 0-day again as soon
as you can blink your grotesque, bloated-from-staring-at-the-monitor-too-much-
for-way-too-long eyes 10 times!  
	Why, you ask?
		I dunno.  Just coz.

	KRAD.  It really is.

	We have an informative issue for you today.  Including....
		-Messages From The SuperHighWeigh
		-Warez Tradink Into the Year 2000
		-Why CEM Sux and We RulE!
		-The Truth About .ZIP and .ARJ
		-How to Build a Markerbomb
		-CrossDressing Fun

	I think we should talk newz first, though.  Because you see, I think
there have been a lot of busts lately, and I would like to touch on that 
issue.  All of the 0-day boards keep getting hit, leaving us with only 1-day,
2-day, and the few renegade 3-day boards!  Yuck!  What shall us 0-day 
mavericks do once our trading grounds disappear from the face of the phone 
lines?  I think that we should all be very careful from now on.  For instance,
on my board, it used to be that anyone could come on, download and upload all
of their warez, etc.  But now, I have made it harder!  Now, they have to use
a PASSWORD to get on!  Yes, every user has to create a password for himself to
use.   This way, not just everyone will get on.  Because when they create an
account, it'll be a lot harder, and most people probably won't want to go
through all that trouble just to create an account!  kewl, eh?
	I thought so.  Let me see, though.  I think that the 0-day scene is
becoming more and more rebellious, in that these one guys I saw, they were
actually peddling 1-day around to 0-day boards, and rebelling against the set
standards!  How is this possible?  I don't know, but it scares me.  It really
does.  All these busts, and 1-day on 0-day boards, when YOU KNOW that 0-day
boards are reserved for 0-day, and that only 1-day boards can get 1-day!  How
is it possible that the 0-day boards will eventually become 1-day, and then 
those will be busted, coz those one guys who bust people will think they're
0-day, and then you know what.  We'll be stuck with all 2-day boards!  This
is a disaster.  So here's the remedy:  Everyone make your users use a 
password!  I bet this will cut the busts in half, cause those guys who bust
people don't want to type the extra six characters.  It's too hard and you
know it!
	KRAD.  We tell the truth like it is, when it is.  0-day, every day.

	Ahh.  What to say to your moronic credit?  Yes, I have already gotten
away with it.  Go ahead.  Mail bomb me.  Is that as good as you can do?  Mail
bombing is just SO difficult to do, even harder to combat.  Besides that, 
you can't be too skilled at mail bombing (or anything else for that matter..)
It's obvious from your message you don't even know how to fakemail.
	Get a clue little boy.  Wait.. Even better.. To quote you:
			"I'm telling you,SCRAM!"

  P.S. Learn how to delete lines from files, instead of quoting the whole
       message.  I did not need to see my entire issue #7 quoted to me.
		Hint:  "dd" in vi, and ^K in Pico.
			Hope that helps.  You're probably new at this, though,
			aren't you.

	Whelp, dat's it so far!  I'll publish more mail as it comes in.

#$ Dah Year 2000!         @##@$
#)$(* By:  Futurist     ##$@@#$

	I have been studying the warez for a long time now, and I see that
definate things will have to be done in order to keep it alive well into the
future.  That's why I'm gonna talk about today how to keep the warez going on
into the year 2000 with no problems!  This should help everyone and stuff, as
we go into the next century!  
	Yes, as the year 2000 approaches, many obsticals face us in this, the
elite 0-day warez scene.  For instance, the threat of older warez.  I realize
that in a past KRAD issue, a philter was published.  This is a wonderful tool,
and I hope that all of you are smart enough to use it, because it will keep
out most of the old warez.
	But wait!  New technologies are creating a hazard for us, the 0-day
warez peddlers!  Suddenly, warez have been showing up that somehow said that
they were -8 day!  I was so excited that I almost masturbated before schedule
that day, but instead I decided to take a look at this, really new ware!  All
of a sudden, as I was looking, I realized that it wasn't new, but was a beta
version of Windows NT from 5 days ago!  I was dewmed!  My board would be 
ruined, and my warez philter didn't even catch it!  How was this possible?
Using some new technology, I bet it was some kind of virus, an evil soul 
reprogrammed the beta version to look like it was a -8 day ware!  
	What we'll need in the future are better warez philters, for one.

	The next problem is this "Super-Road."  I don't know what this thing
is, but I bet that if we got our warez on it, it might help us keep them 0-day
and very elite.  Because not too many people know about the Super-Road yet.
I hear that it is very hard to get on, and all of it is very unpublished.  So
if we got our 0-day on there, no one but the elitest of us would be able to
get it and that would be real cool!  So someone tell me how to get on this 
thingy!

	Our final obstical is the warez themselves!  What if, one day, all
the companies didn't realease any fresh new warez?  We'd ALL be dewmed, coz
all of our warez would be 1 day, and no one would have any 0-day!  We must 
keep the companies moving, and keep the SPA funded, so that the warez get out
on time when they're supposed to!  Cause if they don't, we'll be all messed
up and stuff!  Arrgghhh!!!

	Well, that's it.  If you follow these simple directions, you'll still
be trading warez just great in the future, too!

why CeM sux and we r00l.!             
by KiNG ZeRo            !
#!!!###!!!###!!!###!!!###

	CeM sucks because i say it does.  I have a lot of reasons why
it does so there!  I mean, they can't even release one issue a day, now
that isn't very close to 0-day warez!@$!  I know I know, you are saying
'the mighty krad hasn't been 0 day all the time', but the founder
was busy courriering the fast warez!$!@!  Give him a break guys~!@$
Either way, we have a better 0-day ratio than they dew!
	Another reason.  They say they are the only elite magazine in
the 3o3 area.  That is BS!@#  Look at us, then phear us, cuz we are 
more elite than th0se l00sers.  Thpptt (sticking my tongue out at you
forsythe).  There are other magz out there in 3o3 that are a lot better
than that crap CeM but I don't have time to read them since I courrier
as much as I dew.
	Forsythe wouldn't do a KRAD interview when we called him.  We were
also going to give him some phresh gnu warez but he wuz lame!!  The other
thing about them is that warez are alright and stuph, but they still
think they are the bestest out there in the underground.  Them haxors and
freaks are much scarier than us though, and are really much more elite
(please don't hax my 0 day bbs!).
	CeM keeps giving this list of warez b0ards but won't give numbers
out at all.  That is so lame!#$!  They say they want t0 see more warez,
but won't help you get on a board!  Course, I have a 0day account on
forsythes board and I will give you the number if you want.  They have
stale warez anyway.

	you say you have a life CeM crew?  You lie.  You just courrier
all day like the rest of us i bet.  You are old gnues, KRAD is on the
scene.

Here is some speks for you to look at and stuff:

TEST2  ARJ   163057 - 1min 09sec - ARJ - Maxumin Compression
TEST2  ZIP   164298 - 0min 37sec - ZIP - Maxumin Compression

	We kompressed some 0-day to test if .ZIP is better than .ARJ to prove
it, and we were not surprized at it!  This proves it!  HAHAH!
	We did 400K(RAD) of warez, and found dat dah .ZIP iz about 1K bigger
den dah .ARJ, but lookie here.  Dah .ARJ takes twice as long to do it and why?
I don't know, but I did some math:
	1K to send takes like maybe 1/4 of a second.  .ARJ saves 1K, but takes
around 30 seconds longer.  So with .ZIP, you can actually kourrier more warez
in the time it takez!  .ZIP iz kewl!  .ZIP-File Phil!  Use .ZIP!  .ZIP is dah
best!  FUQ EWE ARJ PH00L!!!  AHAHAHAHHAHAHAH!!!

@@@ How To Build 
@@@ A Markerbomb
@@@@ By: Sianyde
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

	Hi guys.  Well, I've been bombing for a long time now, and I'm a real
anarchist and stuff, and am real kewl, so I thought I'd tell you how to build
my bestest bestest bomb, it's called a markerbomb, and it blows ANYTHING up,
and is much better than any other bomb, cause it's so kewl that I just can't
believe how neeto it is!
	Okay, well, I tried lots of bombs, like this one with this stuff 
called "C4" and this one with fertilizer when I was in Oklahoma a few weeks
ago, but neither had very much effect.
	So then, I tried some of this stuff called "gunpowder," and I put it
in this really thick metal pipe, but it didn't do much.  That's when this
kewl idea hit me, and I decided to try and put it in a crayola marker.  I mean
just think about it.  Plastic will blow up much better than metal, coz it's
kewler, and also, kolourz will go everywhere coz it's a marker, and stuff!
Neet, eh?

	OKay, here's what you do?  First, you take the marker, and take out
the thing inside.  That's neeto, cause then you can rite on stuff.  Then, you
fill it with gunpowder.  Then, you open the cap, and light the tip in there,
and you run away real fast, cause soon it'll be like "boom" and that will be
kewl and it will blow stuff up and you'll be a real kewl anarchist like I am!

	Have fun!
