LYRICS: Back from the Grave
dictated by: Amerikan Junkie

--*--

Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
Darkness surrounds me
In his subterranean dwell

Evil forces caused by lust
No one to cry no one to tell
Haunting my demented mine
Happiness I'll never find


Back from the grave I don't know when
I wish that I could see you again
Yeah see you yeah see you again
Conqeeror of torn our hearts


Cooped up in a world of shades
And self-destructive greed
See them gather watch them part
See you one last time is all I need
