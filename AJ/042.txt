(************ I KILL WITH HOPES... )))))))))))))))*00ss000w

I kill with hopes...
to change the world.
all that those,
politcal pigs horde.

...and what do we get?
...not what we desrve.
I've had it up to here,
they've pinched my last nerve.

Im ready...

...sweating into my stich,
that motherfucker in abercrombie and fitch.

Look at him,
on his high horse,
hat with the pre ruffled brim.

All I see is blind red,
political bullshit is what my mind fed.
My heart beast races,
thinking of all those times,
and all those places.

Places I had my chance,
see the fear in your eyes with just one glance.
Evil darkness, asking me to dance.
Brainwashing my mind,
setting my trance.

But just take one more glance...

My face beats red,
politcial fucks,
all my mind said.

Kill, Rip, Torture;

...distort her...

Why did I have to end your life?
easy, look at your standards,
the way you raised your kids.
It wasnt you,
just the way you lived.

Does it make me any better?
No. only makes me worse,
I feel myself fading back,
plans seem to crack.

On you I feed,
just to watch you bleed;

And as I spit you out,
My eyes gleem and start to shout.

The hate I have for scum like you;
Of course, its what I had too do....

All the born in milioniares are to blame.
All the blonde bitches, and all their fucking fame.
All the political dicks,
All the innocent people they prick.
All the homeless on the street.
All the poor with out shoes on thier feet.

Which to save first?
Who deserves a ride in the hurst?

The solution is obvious,
my plans are devious.

Tricky, and deceit,
its you I desecrete.

You with the monarchy,
You that capitolize,
you that terrorize.

Ill slit your fucking throats,
all of you, your in the same boat.

Everyone who murders, lies, or steals,
soon your pain I shall feel.

For you are stricken,
by the greed that you thicken.

You think your sly,
but soon it is your very time to die....

All political vamps,
all prostitutes, and tramps.
All canadites and white trash,
first the nuke then a flash.

Twenty seconds you have to dash,
then inceneration from the back.
Its YOUR LIFE YOU HAD TO LACK.
SO GET PISSED AT THE PAYBACK,
IT WAS YOUR FOE,
THE ONLY THING YOU HAD TO SHOW,
YOUR BABY YOU HAD TO THROW,
NOW LIVING IN SOME FOSTER HOME.

YOU SHALL FUCKING DIE!
