  Joey swung the video camera around as he stared down at the
small lcd screen, "I cant believe we're doing this." "Man,
this is so fucked up, but so fucking funny at the same time."
Karma stated and gave a little laugh.

  "Shhh." came from Darin's mouth. They all turned toward the
scanner which was tuned into the local fire department frequency.
"Nothing but bullshit snow." Karma was annoyed. He lifted the 
partially smoked spliff to his lips and took a puff. As he exhaled
Joey turned the camera to Karma. 

***911 TO FD 13. WE GOTTA FD CODE 3-5 TO 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LN.***

  Karma jumped up, "LETS FUCKING GO. GRAB EVERYTHING!" Everyone
jumped up and took to the vehicle. Joey held the camera and
ran. As he did he spoke so that the camera could hear, "PROJECT
STAY PUFF, UNDERWAY." He jumped in his car. Karma followed, 
opening the door quickly to allow Darin in the back seat. Karma
jumped in. Joey handed the camera to Darin and they took off.

   "Which way?" questioned Joey. "4 blocks off of N. 73rd, youll 
make a right on Fadal Ave, and you will come to it." said Karma. 
Karma's heart was racing, as with everyone elses in the vehicle.
Darin stared at the lcd as they raced to the fire, "Fuck ya man,
this is going to be fucking hilarious." "Some old man is probably
gonna kick our ass." said Joey, as he laughed uncontrollably.

   Five minutes later they could see the fire truck lights shining
the houses across from the burning one. They parked on the corner,
and exited the car with a swiftness. Karma, and Joey ran up to
a window flaming on the side of the house. Darin stayed behind a 
tree not far away, and filmed the comedic spectacle. 

   The Firemen were busy pulling hoses off the truck, and hooking 
the pump up to the fire hydrant. The family sat a few feet off the 
curb as they watched their home burn. Karma and Joey shoved the hangers 
into the bag, and yanked them out, revealing snow white fluffy stay 
puff marshmellows. They neared the house, and commensed to roasting
marshmellows, while the hopes of the family, and their home went
up in flames.

   The owners of the home witnessed their spectacle. The man who
obviously owned the home rushed over to Karma yelling, "WHAT THE FUCK 
DO YOU THINK YOUR DOING YOU LITTLE FUCKING PRICK!?!?!?!" 

   "Why roasting marshmellows on burning hopes, dreams, and years of
work of course. It adds a peculiar flavor you just cant get any where
else. Why? You want one?" Karma questioned in a sarcastic manner. The 
man leaned back, and hit Karma on the side of the face. 

   Darin, having witness this event screamed, "COME ON, LETS GO!"
They all rushed to the vehicle, Joey eating freshly roasted marshmellows
the entire time as he ran. Darin laughed, and so did Karma as they took
off. Karma looked back, and could see the man shaking his fist in the
air like a redneck fucking fool. He grinned and knew their mission
was complete.
