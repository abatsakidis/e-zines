	            -[A Tao of Reaction]-


Someone very improtant once told me:

"You cannot change a person.
 You can only change the way that YOU, react to that person."

Makes sense doesnt it? I went on to read the 2000 page book
"Atlas Shrugged". I cant remember who it the author was, but
it put Reaction, and Change into perspective for me.

Reaction is the essence, it is the beginning of the
web of change. Even the TAO TE CHING supports this.

Chapter 41:

"The wise man hears of the TAO,
 and practices it diligently.
 The average man hears of the TAO,
 and half believes it, and half doubts it.
 The inferior person hears of the TAO,
 and he ROARS with laughter.

 For if he didnt laugh, it wouldnt be TAO."

The wise man heard the TAO, and he reacted to it, by 
practicing it diligently.

The inferior person heard the TAO, and reacted by laughing
at it. As well as changed his state of mind, by just laughing. 

It says if he had not reacted to it, it would not be the TAO.

Everything you do is a reaction. 

If you see something ugly,
you take note of it.
From there you either,
1) embrace it
or
2) turn away from it.

These are all reactions.

If you spy something to be beautiful,
you take not of it.
From there you either,
1) embrace it
or 
2) stand back and watch it from a distance.

Again, all reaction.

I also see that there is a fine line between Reaction and
reflex/nature/instinct.

If there is even a "fine line" there, it is very fine at that.
They still seem to support each other.

As it was said:

"You cannot change a person,
 you can only change the way that YOU react to that person."
                        
                                               -Billie Cryer

These few words contain so much vast blessing, it is unreal.

Please think about it.
