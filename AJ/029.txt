I have been in a state of recooperation after having quarelled with
the white demon for a few. The "white demon" is that of a gemini. It
consists of two essences, to form one whole:

	1) Its company, and addictive flavor.

	2) The will I have to indulge in it. 
	   Which I have aquired after getting
           to know the ole' bloke.

The white demon will befriend you, and betray you. You must have the virtue
of Self-Control, or the white demon will bite, and make you suffer.

	"Things seem greater in mass quantity.
	 But after awhile,
	 The mass is no longer great.
	 It is just a quantity."
