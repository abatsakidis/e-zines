  After recently viewing a television episode of Drew Carey,
my eyes were opened to the fact that we as human beings are
no strangers to the virtue of "whoring".

  We sacrafice ourselves for selfishness, and indugence 
every single day. Whether it be material possesions, such
as money. To other things, such as attention, and affection.

  Is the selfness of one not enough to sustain as single
soul? Must we overload ourselves with complex accessories,
and false security blankets?

  Are our minds so weak that we need the companionship
of another to help us stay sane? What happened to the 
instinctual nature, and self-fulfillment that came before
the ever so exalted "I"? What about the will to just "know"?
The sense of calmness, and easyness that companions the
still mind? The times your not trying to do, but rather
undo?

  We as human beings are lost...
