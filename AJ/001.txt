Anxiety Killing

Anxiety.....

What a fucked up problem. Especially having Axiety ABOUT your anxiety.
It has been trapping me lately. All day long. Why worry so much? And
why can't I help it?

I have never felt so inferior to my mind in my entire life. I have tried
and tried to take control, but nothing works. They say the production
of too much serotonin is the cause. But what the hell is causing me to
be producing too much serotonin? The partial answer to that is the
collapsing of my lung. Its got me shaken and thinking. 

Thinking....
thats the whole problem.

I look for problems, or pains, thus I find them more than a person 
usually might. I am making things out to be bigger than what they
really are, I REALIZE THIS.... so why can't I stop?

Maybe because the fact that the whole thing was "sponteneous". The fact
that it just happened, and nothing caused it, so it could happen again
the same way. Nothing I can do, or not do, is going to change that fact. 

Fear of the unknown......

That sucks.... badly. 

This anxiety is interfering with my work, and my home life.

Damn..... Damn..... Damn.....
