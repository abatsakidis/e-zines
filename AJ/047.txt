      TITLE: [- NOTHING IMPORTANT -]
      
-------------------


Sorry its been awhile since I last writ...


The moons have been full,
and the plagues hath been cast.
I have gone awry,
and my mind is but nothing.


My sorrows summon tears,
and my tears cause drought.


....this; since I last writ... my dear child I weep for us.
