I admit it, I am a console junkie. Everything
runs much faster, and much smoother. I suppose
some would call me "old school", but I'm not. I 
just happen to like console.

As well as being a console junkie, I like games
as well. Who doesnt? So, I play a few console games
as well. There are many games you can play on your
console. MANY. You can get virtually almost every
game out there, FOR FREE & LEGAL!

Many of these include Quake, Quake2, DOOM, Wolfenstien3D,
Heretic, and even HALF LIFE! And all these can be played
on your console, so long as your video card is setup
correct.

As well, I am going to review such games as ported versions 
of Q-Bert, Dopewars, Pong, Pacman, and even the ever eleet 
ported version of SCORCHED EARTH!

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
         DOPE WARS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dope wars is a text based game. And very complicated, and mind 
tingling.

Your a mean street dope dealer from The bronx in New York City, 
and your looking to make it too the top. You start off with 
$2000, and owing your Lone Shark $5,500. You have exactly one
month to do just this: 

Pay back your lone shark, and get a huge profit.

It lists prices of different "street drugs", such as cocaine,
weed, and acid. 

There are several different places you can go around New York,
such as The Bronx, Central Park, Manhattan, and even "The Ghetto".
Differnt drugs are priced differently all the time. You could be in
Manhattan one time, and Acid be $300, and a week later in the same
place Acid could be $3,000. (Catch the game yet?) Cops are always
busting people, making it prices of things more expensive, and sometimes
there is such a quanity, that they are dirt cheap.


GAME LAYOUT:

In the very top left hand corner you will see a date. You have exactly 30 days
from this date. (12-01-1984) 

Across from this in the center you will see the name of where you are @ currently.

Over on the far right, you will see "Space", this is how much you can hold of 
something, by default you can only hold 100, but people will ask to be hired so
that you may hold more.

Below this you will see two boxes, on the right it says "stats", this consists of:

-CASH: How much you currently have
-GUNS: How many guns you have (Which you can sell in the "Ghetto" @ Dans)
-Health: How much health you have
-Bank: How much cash you have in the bank (This is important, cause at the end
       of the game, your points come from how much $$ is in the Bank, not what
       you are holding. Your bank is located in The Bronx.)
-Debt: How much you owe your loneshark


When you start the game it is going to ask you for a name, put whatever.

Now, the next screen is where the Linux Console Version differs from every
other version:

**YOU CAN PLAY ON-LINE WITH OTHER PEOPLE BY CONNECTING TO DEFAULT SERVERS**

It is going to ask you:

             C>onnect to a different host and/or port                                                                               
             L>ist the servers on the metaserver, and select one                                                                    
             Q>uit (where you can start a server by typing                                                                          
                    dopewars -s < /dev/null & )                                                                                     
          or P>lay single-player ?    


Once you choose an option, you are on your way!


TIPS:

% Try and get your lone shark paid off as soon as possible, a good way to
  do this is by buying weed, or acid. 

% Dont buy Acid if it is over $1500, and never sell it for less than %100 profit

% Dont buy weed for over $200, and dont sell it for under $500

% Cocaine, Heroin, Weed, and Acid are the money makers in this game.

% Once you have a steady supply of cash, buy only cocaine.

% Do not sell the cocaine until they are buying it for over $50,000.


Thats it. Enjoy.
