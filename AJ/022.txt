  This morning I found myself asking, "Why the hell do people put their ICQ
numbers on their webcam images?". From my standpoint, I have enough people
messaging me; so then, why publicize your ICQ number?

  I feel this shows a sense of "desperate reaching". A sense of weakness.
I think anyone publicizing their ICQ number on their webcam image should
be taken off the page that they are on immediatly.

  By putting your ICQ number for everyone to see, you are leaving a translucent
message that states: "Im a fucking loser; someone please, please talk to me."
Thus people arent going to talk to you. I dont post my ICQ number, but yet
I cant stop people from finding it out. Its really kinda annoying.

  Hmm, so I wonder if I post my ICQ #, if people would stop messaging me?

  Even so, it should work.

[NOTE: The above DOES NOT EXCLUDE *AIM* nicks. Just
       replace "ICQ #" with "AIM NICK", and there
       have it.]
