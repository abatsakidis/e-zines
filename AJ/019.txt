Homophobia is not cool anymore. Very 1998.
I have anxiety because I was born with a
chemical imbalance that makes me nervous.
You have it because you're so full of useless,
unbridled hatred that you're driving yourself mad.
Lighten up mate... the way you present yourself
is a huge turn-off.

blah blah blah....

Im not homophobic. I have friends that are gay. I dislike homosexuals who
email me and claim that they are not gay, and then go on to tell me that my
vibe is "sexy" in hopes that they might get a piece of cyber sexual ass.

Thus my "damn homosexuals..."

[as in, they are a annoyance]

So...

1) Dont assume that you know me or my essence.

2) Im not filled with hatred, Im filled with joy. Read the Tao Te Ching,
maybe you will understand. (to every thing Good, there is a equal bad. Same
essence, Same face, Same Joy, different state of being)

3) My anxiety is caused my me fucking my mind up with drugs so many times
(ie Acid, and Heroin; mostly acid) that now I am suffering with the affects
of anxiety. It is well known that SOME people who would trip alot of acid,
have fucked up their chemical equllibrium, and now suffer from anxiety/panic
disorders.

4) Im sorry, I didnt know it was my purpose to turn the world on. (ie. I
dont give a fuck if Im turning you off. You just dont   understand me, and
very few do.)

5) Take your femenistic bullshit elsewhere, cause in the great words of Ian
from Minor Threat: "I dont wanna hear it".

6) Fuck You.
