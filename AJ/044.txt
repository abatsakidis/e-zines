SO you just had a birthday.
your 10 and at the store.
mommy wont get you that ice cream,
that you asked her so nicely for.
chunk a fit,
throw eminems on the floor.
get what you want,
till the bitch buys you more.

So now your 16,
heading down the wrong path,
gonna quit school cause you cant pass math.
Gotta use drugs,
just to help you cope,
you go off the line,
start snorting coke.

So now your 18,
your moms screaming "get the fuck out".[moms voice]
What? Where? You werent ready for this.
[moms voice]"Take your pout somewhere else and go shout."

So now your 21,
attempted to go back to school.
Same fucking math class,
made you feel like the same fucking fool.
Hanging out in bars,
stayin real late.
Getting really drunk,
looking for that hot chick to take home, and rape.

Now your 34,
all your family turned their back,
you got three kids,
your living in the ghetto,
now your addicted to crack.

Now your 45,
still cant make a dime.
Go get your welfare;
Find out you got cancer,
soon will be  your time.

Still cant support the family,
still smoking shmack.
What happened to the will and self motivation?
This is all you lack.

Now your 57,
had a bad time last eve.
Drop in on your dealer,
get your shit, and then youll leave.

Get ready to go, 
somethin goes bad,
turn your back to run,
a gun is what he had.
Only if you ran faster, 
the story is so sad.
Only if you made better choices,
maybe id still have a dad.
