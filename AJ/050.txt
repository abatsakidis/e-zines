INTRODUCTION

	So here it is... my window for you to see into the revelation
that has become my life... Pardon the parables, but to gain full
understanding into my not so fruitful life, this is how it must be writ.


                          - !FLEX SIG CV.CRUD! -


Times are bright,
but my light shines dark.
I am well...

I hear the voices,
and what they have to speak,
Telling me vile things,
and that I am weak.

Pissing me off,
more and more and more,
the realization flowing,
showimg me lifes a whore.

Self-Contradiction,
over and over again,
making me psychotic,
driving me insane...

As time lapses,
So does my memory.
I cant feel what I shout,
I bend my head as my mind pouts.

..and I think...

"Life is anal.
 As is the human mind...
 Moral to this story:

 Yourself you have to find."
