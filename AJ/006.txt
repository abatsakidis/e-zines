(PART I)

 After a long day at work, and getting off early, karma goes home
to rest his feet. He picks up the phone do give his girlfriend of
7 years the routine phone call to let her know he is home, and it is
time for them to meet up.
 His girlfriend, Kym, gets off 4 hours before him, and always goes home
to await his phone call. It has been the same routine for several years.
Karma picked up the phone, and dialed Kym's number. 
 *ring*ring*ring*, for 2 minutes he let the phone ring, but no answer. 
How odd he thought. He tried again... still no answer. So Karma decided
to go over to her house, and make sure everything was fine. 
 He turns the corner too her block, and there is another vehicle parked in 
the drive way. He doesnt reckognize it. "hmm", he thought too himself. So he
parks, and gets outta his car, and walks too the door. No need to knock, after 
dating someone for 7 years, you tend to accuire a key.
 Karma slowly, and quietly unlocked the door. He could hear pants, and moans
coming from the other room. He pulled out his .38 that he always has with him.
As he peaked into the room, he finds a stranger mounted on top of Kym. They were
having smooth sex, un acustomed to what Karma liked; roughness.
 Karma jumped into the room, and aimed the gun. Karma screamed, "WHAT THE FUCK!?!?"
And continued with, "YOUR A FUCKING SLUT...", and "YOU MOTHERFUCKER". All the 
while he pointing the gun at both of them.
 "Whats going on?", Karma questioned. "Put the gun down baby." Kym begged. "Fuck you
kunt, and dont call me baby, cause im not yours anymore bitch." stated Karma". "Did he
know about me?" asked Karma. "No." answered Kym. Karma looked to the nightstand. There
sat the picture of them kissing on their 5th year anniversery. "Yeah right," yelled 
Karma, "and your a fucking liar too? Stupid bitch". 
 Karma looked too the John, "Do you think im fucking stupid? Do you think you could 
actually get away with this?". "Man, I didnt know I swear, lemme go, PLEASE.", exclaimed
the John. "Hell no, you ARE going to die motherfucker, you arent going anywhere," Karma
stated, "Consider yourself already dead motherfucker." 
 Karma opened the closet on the right of him, while keeping an eye on the two. He pulled
out a few of hsi neck ties from a few years back. He threw them to Kym, "Tie him up.
Tie him good, your life depends on it. If you dont, Ill kill you too kunt."
 Kym obliged his request, and tied him up loyally. "His legs too", stated Karma. Again
she did the same. 
 "Good bye motherfucker", ***BAM***, Karma placed a hole in his frontal lobe. Karma turned
to Kym, "I always told you too end it first if you were going to cheat on me. You refused.
Good bye, and I love you." The shot rang out...

(PART II)

 Five years later, Karma is sitting in a Maximum Security Prison for the Murder of his 
Girlfriend and her lover. He is on Death Row in the L.S. Unit in Huntsville Texas. One
of the two Death Chambers that the have in Texas.
 The world is doing horrible. World War 3 started 2 days ago. Noone knows if Nuclear Warfare
is going to be a possiblity. Its not supposed too be, but scince the technology does exist,
it could be. 
 Karma hears the cell block bars slide open. Someone is coming down the hall. It is the 
Warden. "Listen up pukes," states the warden, "I got a oppurtunity for those of you who 
want it." "You know that the war just started, you also know that many people who were
drafted have dodged, and gone into hiding. This has caused a problem for the government.
Now since you are all condemed too die anyway, you have the choice of fighting on the front
lines, in the war. If you survive, when you come back, you will be put back into general
population, and your death penalty will be revoked." "Any volunteers?". "If you do, we 
will notify your family, they will be able to visit you ONCE with in the five days after you
volunteer, and then you wil be shipped on Con Air to your sanctioned military base. After
that they will do with you what they will. If you fail to listen too them, you will be
lethally injected immediatly, and your family will not witness your execution."
 "Ill do it." stated Karma quietly. His voice was filed with depression, and his heart with 
carelessness. He figured, if he could survive this, he could one: run, and stay in some
other country. Or two, get rid of his life sentance.

(PART III)

  Three weeks later, Karma was in South Africa. They had givin him a basic run down on
how to operate his basic weapons, and givin him a basic survival course. There was no time
for boot camp. America was everyones main target. Even a few of the Allied Countrys had 
blamed America for their economic collapses.
  Karma was to run basic operations. He succeeded in all suicide missions that they had 
givin him. Some of which he ran, or got into enemy camps and gained intellegence 
information. He was working up to something more than they had expected.
  One day, they were trying to extort amerikan hostages that a Mad Person had taken, along
with a school of South African children. Karma's team had three snipers setup, and a 
assault team ready to go. What Karma and them didnt know is that the one person that they 
thought was responsible was really five people, who were part of a revolutionary group.
  A crowd had gathered watching the stand off. A little girl and her mother stood off the
side a ways, but not out of danger. Karma took notice. When he did, he caught a glance of
a red beam moving up the daughters chest. Karma took off in a dash. When he did, one of 
Karma's snipers thought he was trying to get away, and go AWOL. Both snipers shot at the 
same time. Karma dove for the little girl. He landed with the girl alive in his hands.
  Karma however wasnt. He had taken a bullet in the bck of his head from his teams sniper, 
and takin another in throat from the revolutionarys. Karma gasped for breath twice they
said. They were suprised he even gasped. He was missing a full half of his head. He died
nearly instantly, grasping a picture of Kym. 
  The wind picked up, and with it so did the picture. It landed on the little girls mothers
leg. She picked it up, and kept it with her. When her daughter was older and older enough
to understand, the picture that came from the saint would be hers.

  Karmas life was out of the ordinary. In one place, he was a murderer, in the other, he was 
a hero and a saint. How can you judge him? You cant. Only God can.
