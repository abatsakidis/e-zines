   As I site here waiting for our network's 
internet backbone to get back up, I cant help
but me motivated to write about my only
complaint for the wireless technologies.

  Here at our company (www.centralsystems.com)
we have a wireless T1 that is T3 burstable on
a OC3 connection. Which rarely goes down, except
of course when human error is involved, and the 
jackass's that run the place screw something up,
or "accidentaly" un-route our IP's. 

(To clarify, they dont know shit about it. They
contract people out with the cheapest bid to do
the work for them, and they just make the profit
and put on a show like they know what they are
talking about. I watched the "co-owner" try and
PICO rc.d. Laugh at that why dont you.)

  As I was saying, they only complaint I have
is about the "hop" idea. Its kinda like a network
with BNC connectors. If one gets disconnected, the 
rest of the nodes from there on are disconnected as
well. 

  Well, this has happened to us today. A amp has
lost 60% of its power on one of their towers (or hop),
and hasn't technically disconnected or dropped us. 
It is just that the signal is so weak, that I cant
even get a web page to load, and they are having
ping reply's with 4-5 second responses.

  Dont get me wrong, wireless is probably the most
dependable service that exists. The only problem I
can depict is the hops. But you cant judge perfection,
correct?

So,

PROGNOSIS ANALYSIS:

         if $ISP = $SMART
         then
         $WIRELESS = $GOOD
         if $ISP =/= $SMART
         then
         $OWNER = $NEWJOB
