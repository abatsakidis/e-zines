Kansas

Song title
Carry On My Wayward Son

Album
? Lyrics

{Refrain}

Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more 

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high 

Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say 

{Refrain} 

Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know 

On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say 

{Refrain}
No! 

Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely heaven waits for you

Dust In The Wind


I close my eyes
only for a moment
and the moments gone
all my dreams
pass before my eyes a curiosity

dust in the wind
all we are dust in the wind Some old song

just a drop of water
in the endless see
all we do
crumbles to the ground
though we refuse to see

dust in the wind 

Now, don´t hang on
nothing last forever
but the earth and sky
it lips away 
And all my money won`t another minute buy 

Dust in the wind
all we are dust in the wind
dust in the wind
dust in the wind
