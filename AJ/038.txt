	"Damn I wish I had a cigarette..",

	"Ohh, no problem buddy, here ya go"


	This is the perfect example of Psychic Vamyprism. The definition would be, 

 a] A person who gets something from a discrete statement concerning need, instead of asking
    directly. 

	Psychic Vampyres show their inferiority by doing this. They are weak, afraid too ask
because of pride. Pride must be eliminated for these people in order to allow them too the
source to their being. If not, they will live shallow. By putting it in the form of a 
statement, that then tricks their mind into believing that the process of being declined has
been eliminated. 

	For some odd reason Psychic Vampyres feel shamed by straight out asking, and do not
realise that it shows exactly how weak, and vunerable that they really are. Then again, the
ones who know that they are psychic vampyres, they are smart, do not mind being told "no",
and are just trying to discretely get what they want out of you, by avoiding the asking 
stage, thus making themselves superior too yourself. Do not allow any psychic vampyre to
leech off you.

	The easiest way to fix a psychic vampyre is call them one. Explain exactly what they
have done. If they are a master, do not call them weak, for too a master, even to call is
too show your inferiority. As well, if they are truely a weak soul, tell them. Explain why
they made the statement the way they did, and make them rephrase it in a form of a question.
