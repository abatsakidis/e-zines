                            [- Amerika: Freedom My Ass -]

Arthur Gibbs, a Biloxi policeman, is quoted on CNN saying, "These kids want to express 
their freedom, but they can't do that because the police have it too controlled.". 

This brings up an interesting point. "These kids want to 'EXPRESS THEIR FREEDOM'"...

First he is suggesting that we all own a "freedom", agreed? America's constitution says 
so, correct? A FREEDOM THAT WE ARE ALLOWED TO EXPRESS, THROUGH THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

but wait a second...

"...but they can't do that because the police have it too controlled."

[I dont see a need to comment any more, except with this one last line]

Freedom my ass....
