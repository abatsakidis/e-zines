--------------------------------------


	Ok, in case most of you dont know, the Rheobus, put out by PCMODS.COM,
is a fan controller, that can control the fans, and variables speeds from a CDROM
bay, with a few knobs and LED's.

	I bought me one of these little suckers from heatsinkfactory.com for $59.95.
At first thought, I figured it would get here, all assembled, ready for the molex 
connectors to be plugged right in, so I could go.... wrong.

	The good new is little assembly is required. Too everything though, there is
bad news. The good news is, it was easy to assemble. You have to drill holes in one
of your bay covers; bad? wrong again. They give you a template so you can drill holes
if you switch cases so you "match"... how thoughtful.

	Now the bad part...

	Your leads you want running into the RheoBus WILL NOT BE LONG ENOUGH (with MAYBE 
the exception of the case fan). Thus, you wave to do alot of splicing, and taping. As well,
it does not connect to the RheoBus via a molex connector, they go in bare wire, and its still
easy.


	Overall, the rheobus is a good fan contrller. It controls 4 fans, and you cant beat 
that. Good job PC-MODS.

(I still however think you were more concerned with looks, rather than how its gonna fit 
together.)
