TRADE REGULATION

  Money sucks.... it's own pointless void of green paper nothingness causes stife,
and harsh feelings. Its use is literally no good. You own a peice of paper, stating
that for that peice of paper, the government has gold, that makes the bill that you
own worth what it is.

  The problem with this is there is no more gold. Its all gone, washed up, used up,
see ya. So what does that make that peice of paper that you own? NOT WORTH ANYTHING!
Not worth the lives that die over it, not worth with people and thier families that it
puts out in the street, not worth the vaccince you must have.

  So what happened to trade? Ill tell you, trade happened on a global scale. And the only
thing universally valuble is precious metals, and gold. So the goverment regulated these
things. And out the window went free trade, and indavidualistic trade; trade shows, and
trade posts. The people did gain something though; A thing called taxes.

  Yeah, Money just sucks. And trade just rocks. Lets say you need gas, you cant goto
your local Fina, and say, "Here, I got 3 new pairs of socks, some fine cotton, if you'll
give me 3 gallons of gas". YOU CANT DO THAT! And do you know why? Taxes...
The federal, and state gas taxes. 

  Thats not the way it should be. Because something like money came about, they took trade
away. Now that the money is not worth what it is said to be, we need to go back to trade. 
It will help the people regulate OUR government and take control. If everyone stopped buying
and started trading more, we could put a pinch on our economy, and force them to listen, or
break Amerika's fucking arm!!!

Trade rocks, Government suck.

Fuck em'.
