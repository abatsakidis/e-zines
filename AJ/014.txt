  "He's blaming me for blaming him...."

  "I didn't know.... let's tell his boss."

  Ahhh, the joys of office politics; and what lessons do
poltics teach, and serve? To act like your in the first
grade again, thats what. Instead of connecting with the
source of the dubbed "problem", you must instead connect
with that of a hire power.
 
  Kinda like being in the first grade again, when someone
called you a name. You told the teacher. But generally,
the teacher scolded you as well for being a "tattle tale". 

  Well, be glad to know once out of college, and in the 
real world, you wont have to worry about being scolded by
the teacher, instead, your encouraged to go to him/her. If
you have a problem, instead of writing a nice, but firm, I guess
it was a tiny smart assed letter to the source, and try to be
adults about the whole situation; go be a "tattle tale", and just 
ratt on them. 

  In the end, its all for the better....

  As well, all politics suck.

  co workers.
