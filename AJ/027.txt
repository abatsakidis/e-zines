HOW TO MAKE REAL CRACK

   This process is really simple. 


NEEDS:

1  shot glass
1  thing of cleaning ammonia
1  8-ball of cocaine
1  Blow dryer

	What you are going to need to do is, take the shot glass, and fill it half
way with the ammonia. Next take your 8-ball of cocaine, and dump it in the shot
glass with the ammonia. The cocaine will ball up at the bottom of the shot glass
without all the impurities.

	Next drain the shot glass of ammonia, and take the blow dryer. Hold the
blow dryer a good 6 inches away from the shot glass, and dry the cocaine, it will 
"rock up" as it drys. The ammonia evaporates easy, so it shouldnt take that long.
