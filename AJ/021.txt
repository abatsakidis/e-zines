Have you read any Tantras?
 
What about anything a little more esoteric, like Wiccan?
 
Oh, and are you Taoist, or you just like reading about it?

Im not anything, taoism is just good literature for me. Ive been reading it scince I was 13.
I did minor in Eastern thought for awhile in College, when I realized it was pointless. 
Literally.
 
Wicca is good shit. I dont believe it, but who am I to say what is true?

Its like, if  you see a motherfucker walking down the street flapping his arms... through 
his eyes, he truely believes he is flying.... I mean, REALLY TRUELY THINKS that he IS flying
...
 
how can you convince him that he isnt?
 
I cant classify myself....
 
to name would be to go against the Tao.
