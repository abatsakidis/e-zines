		----[-$tupid Fucking Fla$hlight Cop$-]----


 
(Eagle Security truck slowly pulls up. As he drives by, he gives me this
 stare. I give hime a chance to look away before I begin. He doesnt. Thus,
 the badmood I am in....)

<AJ> WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU STARING AT ASSHOLE?

(The jeep slows, eventually coming to slow stop. A short ass man, around 38+ 
 emerges from the vehicle. As he walks up he reaches to his waist, now you KNOW
 hes not going for a gun....)

<AJ> Dont even fucking think about shining a bright ass flashlight over here...

(he doesnt.)

<AJ> Is there a fucking problem or something?

<FakeCop> No Sir. We've been having alot of break ins into cars and things,

<AJ> So what, because Im standing outside, and I all of a sudden become a 
     suspicious person?

<FakeCop> Well, No sir. I...

<AJ> Did Hearell Realty hire you?

<FakeCop> No Sir.

<AJ> Then why are you here?

<FakeCop> Its on my route...

<AJ> Well, whos paying you to be here?

<FakeCop> I dont know, I just....

<AJ> Well then, leave.

(AJ's GF emerges from the apartment. She sees the security guard...)

<Lynn> Is there a problem?

<FakeCop> No, 

<AJ> Even if there was, what were you gonna do? Call the police... Someone
     WITH some authority... JackAss?

<AJ> Is there anything else?

<FakeCop> Uhm,

<AJ> Im going inside. I hate security guards.
