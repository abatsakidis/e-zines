  Most of the world is now joined together by invisible "cancer causing'
radio waves. Millions of bits of information pass over our heads every 
second. The most popular at the base of this telecommunication......

   Nokia Phones.

  There are many texts on programming your Nokia around the internet,
some have left out some information that I have found through my tests
and comparisons.

  Incase you havent up on programming your Nokia (I happen to own 3
ultra-trendy 5160's) in order to get into the option set for
programming your phone, you must punch *3001#12345# . This is the
default for most Nokia phones.

Short Programming Method:                                              |
                                                                       |
[To program a random A-Key on NAM1 type -> *#6391#                     |
 To program a default A-Key on NAM2 type -> *#6392#                    |
                                                                       |
 After entering either of these, the LCD will prompt you for your 10   |
 digit celullar Number. Enter the correct one. Then the phone will     |
 prompt for a System ID code. Enter the SID you have.                  |
                                                                       |
 After you press OK the phone will turn off, and on. Once back up,     |
 if you have no error, you are good to go.]                            |

  Second, in, I believe it is Issue 5 of b0g (Brotherhood of Gimps),
it says you can call 1-800-Nokia-2u "if you have the balls", and they
will give you a list of SOC #'s, this is incorrect. I have the balls, and I
I tried. Only the service has the SOC's NOT the company who manufactured 
the phone. SOC's are the number that decides what service you will be 
using in your area.

  Now, here is what some text do not explain>

**IF YOU BOUGHT YOUR PHONE FROM AT&T, YOU WILL NOT HAVE A OPTION TO SET
  THE SOC. IT IS PRESET, SPECIFICALLY FOR AT&T**

  It sucks, yes I know, considering I have two phones bought from AT&T, and
the only way to clone them, is to find another AT&T bought cell phone. It
sucks I know.

  As well, always remember, DO NOT CHANGE THE SETTINGS UNDER THE
NAM 1 -> Change Defaults. This goes for NAM 2 option as well. These are
your local settings, and your phone will not work if you change them.
