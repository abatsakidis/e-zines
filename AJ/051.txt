      TITLE: [- Counter-Strike: CV's Guide to Headshots -]

      
-------------------

INTRODUCTION

	So, I have decided to proclaim my self as a head shot guru, considering
according to HL Stats, my headshots percentage is around the 58-62% of my kills.
Thus, I figure that gives me the right, and experience to qualify me to write
one of these things...


		[ - CV's Guide To CS Headshots - ]


1) *OBVIOUSLY* ALWAYS carry your weapon at head level. You never know
   when youll round a corner and someone be right there. You pop off a
   few shots head level right in their face, your sure to get a head shot.

2) AIM WITH THE BOTTOM, OF THE TOP CROSSHAIR, WITH THE TIP TOP OF THEIR SKULL>>

3) With any Sub Machine gun weapon from long distances, give short round burst, 3-5 rounds if that.
   At mid range 5-10 rounds, and at short range 15 round bursts.

   With long barrelled rifles, give 5-10 round burst in long distance, 15 round mid range, and use
   a handgun in close proximity.

4) *DUH* Squatting while aiming, allows for better accuracy.


CONCLUSION

	These four simple rules, you should see your headshot percentage steadily increase. It
worked for me, why wouldnt it work for anyone else?
