	IDIOTS


Idiots are born,
Idiots are raised,
Idiots are inbreed,
Idiots whine when not praised.

Idiots grow,
Idiots hate,
Idiots date,
then Idiots mate.

A bastard is born to Idiot One,
While the bastard is turned away by Two.

Idiots dont pay child support,
Idiots make Idiot fathers,
by the age of Twenty-Two.

Idiots Struggle,
Idiots take life hard,
Idiots think,
then draw the wrong card.

Idiots surcome to the voices,
Idiots slam lifes door,
Idiots make Idiot boyfriends
 that like calling you a whore.

Idiots write stupid poems,
Idiots are twacked in their dome.

Idiots cheat,
Idiots lie,
It is better off that all Idiots die.

Idiots shout,
Idiots pout.

Idiots shoot back at cupid,
Idiots are so very fucking stupid.

Idiots get arrested,
Its always the idiot whos tested.

WHen the Idiots fail,
they generally just refused to prevail.

See, Idiots are smart,
only when they see light,
But Idiots are dark,
and refuse the bright.

Idiots are human,
Arent you?

I am a Idiot,
and you are too.
