->ATTACHMENTS

	Here lately I have been spreading my time out over the net.
I have been wondering onto new/old servers, and meeting lots of people.
(easy way of advertisement I suppose), needless, I have found dalnet quite
comforting. I have always been on smaller, servers that friends have owned.
I like big towns (Seattle), I like big servers (dalnet). 

	As I have stated, I have been advertising my website, which recently went
off line for a few day. I meet lots of chicks. Not a problem I thought too myself,
what the hell, you got some rediculously ugly bitch, on the other side of the screen,
trying to make herself seem hot, so what the hell, oppurunity for a little bit of fun.
(I have met non fuglies. SinDee.).

	Anyway, so these chicks view the cam, and they msg me, "your kinda cute". I 
never even considered that thought. Im use to hanging out with bums, and gutterpunks, 
and shes some rich white ass, trying to offer me a scapegoat: im "cute". 

	Ok, so I eat the shit up, blah blah blah. After 3 hours of knowing some bitch,
I get the vibe that shes trying to act like she ownz my ass... on IRC, thats the catcher.
I've never been too hot on IRC relationships, as a matter o fact, I despise the fuckers.
I make fun of anyone who lives 3000 miles away from their signifigant other, and met over
means of INTERNET RELAY CHAT. I will laugh at you too your face.

	As it goes, 2 chicks too be in particular. One wants me to put a prefix on my nick
like hers, and the other is just plain fucking looney. Telling me how hot I am and shit,
i heard you the first 4oo times trick.


	-> THE ANALYSiS

	People who get involved with IRC relationships, are lacking something in their life.
It could be, depression, feeling like a outkast, feeling insecure, feeling ugly [although
its true sometimes].. etc. ANY VUNERABLITY, that could subject them too a harsh
understanding or a shadowed life.

	The do seem too have somewhat of a REAL LifE, social life.. but most of their time
is spent on IRC, and browsing. They become attached REALLY quick, and you must be blunt
with them too let them know where you stand. 

	The ones who do get attached quikly seem too be suicidal, and a risk too theirselves,
not others. for some physical information, not all of them that are like this are ugly. Some
just seem too be highly depressed, such as school life sucks, or home life. Alot seem too 
be majorly bored. 

	Psychosis Prognosis is: Attachments Bad.
