_----_-__--> the art of non being

   non being is a way. example:

   Guy walks into room, and sits down next too his dog. The dog mutters:

  "I have seen ALL"

   The man gets up, and walks away KNOWING that the animal has NOT seen ALL.
Why? Because the dog speaks of SEEING ALL.

[now next night, same senario.]

  Guy walks into room, and sits down next too his dog. The dog mutters NOTHING [non].
Who is too say that the dog HASNT seen all?

If you speak OF, then you MUST NOT OF.
