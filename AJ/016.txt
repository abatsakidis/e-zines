THE SEARCH FOR ANIMAL CHIN

 In the 80's one of the first, if not the first
skateboarding movie came out. It was entitled
"The Search for Animal Chin", which starred the
original Bones Brigade. I remember buying this movie
when it came out very well.

 The story line was about a group of skaters in search
of a man named Animal Chin who was thought to be the
first skater. The master of the skateboard, and the
exalted and enightened one in the ways of a skateboard.
Every once and awhile though the movie you would catch
a glimpse at this old oriental mans shadow, as he rode by
on a skateboard.

 The skaters searched, and skated, all over the place. 
As they did, ramps JUST HAPPENED to be setup in the
middle of the road for them to skate, as they went. 
Kinda like the storyline of a cheap porno, where the girl
JUST HAPPENS to be on the side of the road, broken down, and
now wanting to have sex. But this is not the storyline, nor
the moral.

 The kids skate for days in search of their master to help
enlighten them in the ways of skateboarding. They are told
that he is hiding out in the Utopia of all ramps. They are
told of a myth, and where he might be staying. Still they
continue their search.

 In the end, they find no Animal Chin. He has lead them to 
what they were searching for.... enlightenment though enjoyment
of a hobby. Something they believe in. Something precious, and
the shows them the real reason they do it.... because they enjoy
it. Not for the money, not for the prosperity. 

 They do it because its what they know. 
 And what they know, is what they enjoy.

 You cannot truly know something, 
 unless you take interest in that something.
