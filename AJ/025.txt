PUT IN MY PLACE

What did you expect?
A simple hello?
What to say to that?
hell no...

When I heard your name,
all I had to exclaim,
my true feelings,
the true: FUCK YOU.

So I said it...
what did it accomadate?
Nothing... still,
just to mandate.

A closure in order,
by far I scream louder,
this time hear me,
this time do not fear.

Standing in front of me,
the reaction would have been the same.
Maybe even louder, harsher,
maybe not as tame.

Truthfully,
when and IF you are near.
Do not bother, I dont care,
You marching back down here,
I dont find it fair.

Enjoy the stamp you left in my life,
for it is the only thing you shall have,
enjoy the reaction you get from me...

I cant even find a reason,
why I sit here and waste time,
writing down feelings,
I didnt even think were mine.

Used....
thats how I felt.
Who got below whos belt?

At first I thought it was I,
now I know it was you.
You used me for practice,
and spit in my face when you were through.

Damn,

Now it all makes me smile.
I thought I was the one evil, and vile.
Put in my place by someone without a clue;

...put in my place by someone like you.
