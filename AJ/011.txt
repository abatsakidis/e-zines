ATDT$#>>>>#*!**!*@312.2.. Return of the Baud


  Today was the first day I have dialed out in about a year. I 
look back and remember te different times I went through to dial
out.

  My first modem was a External Hayes 900 baud. I never knew how 
much those initiation tones stuck in my head, how much they played 
a part. A signifigant role to which I am proud of, and much appreiciative
of. Today while I was dialing out, it was like a flash back on acid. The 
monochrome veiw, ascii charachter filled days of the BBS. FIDO... oh yes.

  What is still remains the same, is my days are still filled the same 
way. Reading text files, learning new shit, writing text files... 

Its a life style. 

Odd.

 Today dialing out is becomeing more and more uncommon, that with the
high bandwith connections, and fast paced face of technology. Someday
dialing out will be obsolete. Will those who remember like I do pay
tribute to the ATDT command?

 Most will forget, but I shall hold a memorial service....
