      TITLE: [- How Are YOU Feeling Today? -]
      
      
-------------------

The dark falleth deeper,
as the slumber for the sleeper.
As he dreams of days awake,
he gives his soul for wine and stake.

As he rises fromm his day,
he is hallow, weak, 
and cannot speak...

He will cast a shower of fire,
on every theif, cheater, and liar.

"I am guilty..."

          **BOW BEFORE THEE**

"On this knee I kneel and pray,
 that thou shalt take my will today."

          **SHALL YOU REPENT**
**HATH THOU BEEN BITTEN BY THE SERPENT**

"Thou hath been bitten once or twice,
 ...lost more than once, while rolling dice.
 So here I lay, right before you,
 To tell you just how much I adore you.

"I REPENT! SEND ME TO HELL, THATS WHERE
 I NEED TO BE SENT!
 WHAT GOOD AM I TO THOSE WHO DONT SIN,
 I HAVE LEARNED MY LESSONS FROM WHERE I
 HAVE BEEN...

 ...so cast me to the shadows below,
 dont you see this is where I deserve to go.
 I am inferior to HE!
 So please; 
 
 In your presence, make absent of thee.

 Im truely sorry for all that I have done, 
 So you see, I cant be in the presence of the one...

 ...who created Earth, Heaven, and the skys above."
