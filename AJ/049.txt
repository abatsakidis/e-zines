      TITLE: [- REVIEW: ATI RADEON 32 SDR -]
      
      
-------------------

	The ATI Radeon is a BADASS card. Not only does it run great for a PCI 
video card, but it is highly configurable (*WINK*). It runs the CHARISMA ENGINE, 
and pixel tapestry (TM), which reduces the heat greatly (*WINK,WINK*). Upon 
installing the card I could already tell the difference between it and the 3d 
prophet (AGP). It was more crisp, and ran much smoother. 

	Now, for the fun stuff. Go d/l yourself the RadeonTweaker. It tweaks out
all options for openGL, D3D, D3DII, etc. I have mine stable, over clocked @ 183.
The ATI Radeon generally is set to run 166. It could be over clocked more, if you
want to take the time to put a bigger heatsink on it. I just have my case open w/ a 
fan directly pointed at the card. I genrally run 40-70 fps (Frames Per Second), on
openGL supported games.

	This should tell you how well I dig the card.

	OVERALL RANKING: GREAT BUY. Cheap, and runs good.
