      TITLE: yet another conspiracy text

  REGARDING: The espionage case involving senior FBI 
             counterintelligence agent Robert Phillip 
             Hanssen

  OBJECTIVE: Present un-intellegent facts, w/ absolutly 
             no proof, and explain a theory of how Osama 
             Bin-Laden is actually the one behind the shit
             that has been stirred up between the US, and 
             Russia

-------------------


  In the latest stages of the case, the US is going back and forth with the
Russians expelling Russian and US diplomats, and considering them "persona non
grata".... making them no longer welcome in each others country. As well, each 
country is not claiming responsibility to the accusations.

  So whos to say that Robert Hanssen WASNT spying for Russia?? Whos to say that
he only THOUGHT it was Russia. Instead, suppose he was really gathering this
information for a indavidual buyer, who knew what he was doing. Maybe a enemy
of the US, wanting to somehow fuck the US over. But considering the guy is 
hiding in exile, and under alot of heat, he can't just directly attack the
US.

  It is said that Robert Phillip Hanssen was paid "...$1.4 million in cash, 
diamonds, and emaralds...". Diamonds, and Emeralds are mined quite heavily in
Afghanistan. The place of exile for Osama Bin-Laden. Besides, lets face it, 
$1.4 Million Dollars isnt what it used to be.  

  Really, it wouldnt be THAT hard to be a third party, and the one actually
behind the conflicts that have been aroused the past few months. All Bin-Laden
would need was a few contacts in Russia, which have contacts in the US.

  [HYPOTHETICAL SCENERIO]:

  Osama Bin-Laden gains Russian Intellegence contacts. He knows over the past
10 years the cold war has mearly quieted down, not ended. Bin-Laden tells his
contacts that he needs some information from the US. Which he NEEDS. Bin-Laden
alledgedly tried hiring "neo" of gH (Global Hell) to break into .gov sites and
retrieve specific 411. Bin-Laden supposivly offered him $10,000 for his sk1llz. 
$2000 up front, and the rest after the information had been delivered. 

(..and scince we all know neo is a fucking dork anyway, he could have never accomplished
 the tasks that were more than likely placed in front of him. Thats what Bin-Laden
 gets for trying to hire a silly little script bitch, just because attrition.org gave
 neo his own page for his defacements..)

  Bin-Laden gets what info he needs from a FBI spy (Hanssen). While Hanssen gracefully
gives up the documents, not knowing that they are actually going to a indavidual, and not
Russia. Bin-Laden then obtains KGB documents which hold Russian spy 411 in them, and mails 
it to the CIA, and FBI. Hanssen is taken down, along with a whole mess of spies, and shit 
is again started between US and Russia. While Bin-Laden cheerfully drinks his goats milk, 
and remains a anonymous third party.

  Its actually pretty strategical if you think about it. It would be a smart move on
Bin-Ladens part while remaining in exile. If ties between Russia and the US stooped 
low enough, it could aide Bin-Laden in obtaining nuclear documents from Russia (maybe
a willing supplier? or Coalation?). 

HRM.
