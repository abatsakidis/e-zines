Medicine = Bad

I have been taking medicine here lately for my
"severe" anxiety. i have been taking everything
from BuSpar, to Xanax.

Today was the first day for me to goto the 30 mg
BuSpar. I will never take 2 tablets a day again.
See these things chop in half. You take one in the
AM, and one in the PM. I think I about overdosed 
myself, or should I say, the instructions overdosed 
me.

Im still dizzier than you could ever imagine, with the
"Ohhh no, Im gonna puke" feel in the back of my throat.

Nausea isnt good at all. 

I know most people my age would want a doctor like mine
that prescribes everything under the moon, just for the
point of abusing it. But Im beyond that, Im all about
getting better. But instead, I get a Doctor who talks
with your for 2 seconds, lets you get no word in edge
edge wise, and makes no attempt to find the real troubles. 
Prescribes the "medicine" (in my case death I believe), and 
sends you on your merry little way to have another Xanaxed
month.

This just doesnt work for me.

Point is: Carefully choose your Doctor; Whether you want all
the medicine you can gulp down or not.
