In life, there are only two things to worry about,
whether you are well, or you are sick.

if you are well, there is nothing to worry about,
if you are sick, there are only two things to worry about,
whether you live, or you die.

If you live, then there is nothing to worry about,
if you, die, then there are two things to worry about,
whether you goto heaven, or goto hell.

if you goto heaven, there is nothing to worry about,
if you goto hell, youll be so damn busy shaking hands with friends,
that you wont have time to worry.
