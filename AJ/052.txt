 My Last Words To You

Whatever I should say,
It’d never have taken the pain away.
Whatever I do,
Un-thoughtful and cruel,
I would do to you.

I put you through so much,
As well… I weep.
Know that I love you,
In your dreams,  
And when you’re asleep.

I am sorry I had to do this,
I didn’t know which way to go.
Suicide as it is…
It just goes to show…

That I couldn’t live with what I know,

That “yes”, 

I am sorry.
