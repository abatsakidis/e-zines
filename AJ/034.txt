                              (i.e. Stupid Fucking Human)



* AJ sets down his cigarette.


<AJ> what a fucking waste.


* AJ picks up the long tube and inhaler and takes two puffs.


[The Doctor has diagnosed him with "acute bronchitis due to habitual behavior"]


* AJ waits 20 seconds, exhales, and picks back up his cigarette.


* AJ knows that any second, the atrovent is going to make him cough phlem
     from his lungs with a all mighty pain too follow from coughing all night
     the previous one.


* AJ quickly takes a drag off the cigarette.


<AJ> fuck.


* AJ begins leans back, the force building inside, and begins coughing vigorously...
     his face reddning even more with every gasp for breath, and body begging for 
     air.


[After what seems a short eternity, his inflammated chest calms]


* AJ picks up the colour changing glass peice that he had pre-loaded with some
  fine skunk, and takes a huge, instense rip, filling the ice loaded chamber at
  twice, and hurridly setting down the expensive peice (dont wanna break it... you
  know its coming).


* AJ rares back... the pressure forces him foward witha look of constipation on
  his face as he chokes on the massive amount of smoke.


!@#! insert some REALLY fucked up wheezing/coughing/gurgling noises here @#!!@#


[After a few moments of pain from his back and chest and shit...]


* AJ picks back up his cigarette, cautiously takes a very small taste, and inhales while
  carefully finishing this text file.
