    (A) %% welcome

        Hi there, I'm feelin awfully ho-hum this issue, not all that great.
    I just realized I'm not perfect, but no matter how hard I try, I will
    always be put down for not reaching *their* expectations.

        Boy, this is just one of those depressing moods, maybe i'll be in a
    better one next issue.  I dunno, who knows, not me? do you know?  Cause
    I'd sure like to know myself.

        Start reading before I drag you anymore down.

    (1) %% she saved my life, again - part 2

        damn, it wasnt her.  i should have figured anyway, i *knew*, back in
    the back of my head it wasnt.  but why did i continue?  why?

        there are so many i see each day, the young girls who have crushes,
    the older girls who want older guys .. and then theres the aquantence who
    you know from some passing moment, or perhaps longer.  she is not perfect
    for me, but she looks up to me.  am i settling for an imperfect girl for
    loss of the perfect one gone?  or is it love, disguised behind a clever
    mask of blemishes and imperfections?

        whatever it is i wish it would reveal itself.

        either way, i couldnt address her upfront, this is odd, this is much
    to uncomfortable .. is this for real?  in a world of plastic people and
    perfect love she would be nothing, and yet, she expects nothing more
    from me, then me.  she doesnt give up for loss of a massive build and
    great smile.  its a shame im so picky, this would be much easier.

        no matter how i dress it up, love can not be fabricated and it cant
    ever meet my expectations.  whatever love is, its to deep and to far
    from me to even begin to understand.  but for now, i must meet my innate
    instinctual passion for female companionship.  for i have locked myself
    into an iron box, and ever so badly wish to get out .. to meet her.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) %% nothings right

    i lied, i cheated, i stole
    my life means nothing .. anymore
    i cant get anything right, until now
    make me change, make me right
    make me strong, make me fight
    for my own establishment, of right & wrong

    ive been messing up, in the biggest ways
    now i live for nothing
    but that which i live to please
    cant stop pleasing them
    gotta start pleasing me

    ive dug myself this pit
    and thrown myself on in
    and locked my casket up
    and lost my self inside

    nothings right, but nothings wrong
    nothing there to make me strong
    nothing is what i fight for now,
    not for me, i fight for nothing.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) %% motivational dogma

         Ok, the 10 commandments should be followed .. agreed.  However, im
    begining to become seriously angry at the communist regime the US is
    becomming.  Why is it, that if I want to start a busniess in a small
    town, with my own money, the goverment should be involved?  Why should
    I have to sign 10,000 papers and pay 70% tax/funds on stuff I don't have
    any will to pay for in the first place? losers.

         And what about schooling.  Why should I be paying for some stupid
    ingrate wigger kid to go to school while my son/daughter is in a private
    school or homeschooling?  And if I were sending him/her to a public
    school, why should I pay you to mold his morals & values?  Your values
    and morals are worth shit, values are taught in the home, not from some
    faggot from San Fransisco. losers.

         The goverment shouldn't run the people, the people should run the
    goverment.  Liberal shroom eatin crazies shouldn't be.
