    (A) %% welcome

         Welcome, welcome friends, to Luna e-zine issue one.  Luna will be a
    monthly/bi-monthly electronic magazine dedicated to something I hold a
    deep love for.  Writing.  I can't promise you'll like it, I couldnt even
    say you'll slightly enjoy it.  But you might, and someone out there is
    bound to.  If not, it will have not been a failure, for I write not for
    you, I write for me.

         So with that in mind, I shall begin.

    (1) %% dog drool or the sellout

         A young man, around seventeen enters the room.  Skateboard in one
    hand, his hat in the other.  He sits down in a large room decorated with
    various posters, dirty clothes, old bottles and junk covers the floor.
    A small broken tv sits in the corner with an old nintendo.  The stereo
    is turned all the way up, blasting nofx, nearly shaking the house.

         The man tosses his skateboard down next to the matress on the floor
    and asks the rooms occupant to turn the music down.

         " Dude, I can't hear a thing, turn that shit down. "

         " Hey man, whats up, wanna go skate? "

         " No time, I got big news.  Wait till you hear this dude, You know
      that old man's dog round the block?  Well, I was just skating by and I
      saw him, only this time he wasn't on a damn chain.  I started to go
      back the other way when I heard something running up behind me.  So I
      turned around and sure enough the stupid mutt was on his way to chew
      my neck out.  I figured if I ran he would catch me for sure so I just
      stood still, damn if that dog got close enough I would bash it's head
      in with my board. "

         " So what happened? "

         " Thats when it got scary, when he was like five feet away from me
      he just stopped, like he was checking me out.  Then he did somethin
      I've never seen a dog do before, it was wacked out.  He grinned.  I
      don't get how he did it, but have you ever seen a dog grin before? He
      grinned then licked his teeth and ran back to his house.  It wasn't
      like a vague dog smile, it was like a human grin, scared the shit out
      of me. "

         " So what? "

         " So what!? I just saw a dog smilin at me man, whats with you. Its
      not like I'm on bloody lsd or somethin, it was spooky. "

         " Eh, no big deal. "

         " Moron. "

         And the boy just shrugged, grinned and licked his teeth.

    (2) %% Fear

    Terror of thought obscures reality,
    drops all emotion, animals we become.
    Fear takes over, controls the thought,
    adrenalin speaks, from it we appear.

    Come down to the place, where the old men march
    where the dogs run rabid, where the you get lost
    I am here, I am there, I am lost everwhere
    Get sucked in, get thrown out
    you live in fear, you live in doubt.

    True colors, underestimated we see,
    that shouldn't be you, that shouldn't be me.
    Bring out the angst, beat it to death,
    Drive to hell, then you will see,
    Fear is candid, fear is me.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) %% music for music sake
   
        Music is a melodical or sometimes not so melodical repetition of 
    sounds that come together to make a sound appealing to the senses.  That
    is a very rough interpretation of what I think music is.  Music changes
    the mood, it affects the overall effect of working and has the power to
    make some people just stand up and dance.

        It has the power to make people hurt each other, it soothes the 
    savage beast and it commands.  It is a force second only to words.  I
    say talk isn't cheap, I say chatter is cheap, talk is power.  Music is
    talk squared.  Music is toe-tappin, knee-slappin joy for the ears.  It
    gives me chills to contemplate the power of music.

        And yet, the opressive and annoying sanguines and cholerics, most of
    them anyway, would have us belive otherwise.  I have yet to meet a 
    strong phelgmatic or mellancholy that doesn't feel as I do about music.

        I appreciate and love music for music, it is a force that puts me in
    a state of euphoria to angst.  What have you been listening to?
