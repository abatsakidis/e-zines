    (1) %% same o'le story
        
        wow, a computer, he thought over in his mind as he stared blankly at    
    a black screen.  finally, a new toy.

        he played with the toy all the time, day in day out, figuring it out
    and learning new programs.  at first only for games, but then for the new
    peripheral he had discovered, the modem.  procomm plus! wow, this is neat,
    and lookie here, a bunch of phone numbers, i wonder what they are?

        so i dialed them up, and lo and behold, a bulletin board! wow! this is
    amazing, look mom, i can download neat games, talk to other people on the
    bulletin board with messages and even play games with other people online!
   
        but what is this? he remarked, as he scanned a list of bulletin boards,
    the relic, hmm that looks neat, why isnt it called the relic bbs?  hmm..
    so he called up the number, and saw something that would change his life.
    whats that! those pictures are amazing, that looks like an amazing artist
    painted it.  but its made up of little blocks,  hmm, thats weird.

        i couldnt get access to boards like that for months, but then i finally
    got in .. and i found things i never knew existed.  art packs full of the
    ansi picutres, digital music, and message bases that had really odd and
    different content.  these were people, my age! wow, this is fun, i would
    think to myself.  

        so he started his own ansi group, and his name was beginning to be
    recognized, he wouldnt stop there .. he wanted his own bulletin board, he
    wanted on the internet, and he wanted to be part of a group, finally.

    ---    
 
        two months later

        he was getting sick of the routine.  click on the monitor at 6am, check
    his mail on all the local bulletin boards, post some messages and go to
    school.  occasionally taking time out for a shower or maybe just some 
    deodorant before he left. 

        school was horrible.  no computers cept for the computer lab, and those
    all suck.  no internet, no irc, nothing to do but wait for the day to pass.

        finally it ended, 3pm out the door riding his bike as quickly as he
    could.  gotta start downloading that file before the other kids get back.
    phew, he made it.  no homework .. like usual, no time for homework.  right
    back into the room, closing the door behind him, turning off the lights ..
    cant see the screen as well without the lights off.  listening to music, he
    works with his bulletin board, ansi!! ansi!! i need ansi's!! quick, to irc!
    maybe someone will draw me some, i cant have all stuff by me, everyone will
    think im a lamer!

        the next door neighbor knocks on his window, .. hey, wanna go out and
    play basketball or something?  .. naw, no time for basketball, im working
    out a big ansi trade deal here, go away.  who needs friends, i got all the
    friends i want right here! on my screen! those idiots.

        9pm now, still working on the bulletin board, putting up some nets and
    still drawing ansi.  no time for dinner, i'll just eat some bread and 
    cheese, who needs to look good when your only friends are 5,000 miles away?
    
    ---    
 
        one year later

        negotiating big deal with huge ansi star, my board is huge@! none can
    compare.  ive destroyed my competitors, lied, cheated and stole from them
    all i could, theyre all gone now. hahaha

        he was at the top, no one could stop him, except, those older people 
    who lived with him.  and they did. .. .were taking away your modem son,
    youve become addicted and the privilige of having the modem is gone, take
    down your bulletin board, delete it, get rid of all those files for the
    bulletin board.  i never want to see it again.

        noooo! but i had to, they watched me get rid of the files, and i had
    but one backup, of which, was currupt.  and so i had become, all of my old
    friends from the outer world were gone, save one or two.  no one gave a
    DAMN about the internet, or me, or any of my invisible friends.

        and so he ventured outside, an odd feeling, into the sun.  but what was
    to become?  he wasn't a very hermit-like person by nature, he was big and
    strong, a tad overweight for his size but not obese at all, he had a great
    knowledge of the computer but resented it over the coming months.  
  
        i made friends again, finally, good friends, we did things like biking
    and basketball, but eventually i found my one true love.  skateboarding was
    truly a turning point in my life.  it got me outside, i didnt have to have
    a team to play, and i could do it virutally whenever i wanted.  i met other
    skaters over the next years, slimmed down, and started college early. 

        he had found his love, skateboarding fueled him, learning in school was
    once again a challenge and interesting, and he began to play guitar more
    and more, eventually starting a band.  

        it was one thing, a small thing at that, that took me down the right
    road.  adolescence sucks, mess up once, and your screwed for the rest of
    your young life, maybe even your whole life.

        he now knew what the computer had made of him, a harmless configuration
    of circuts and chips, a tool for the bettering of man, had taken him over.
    i am he, and i actually resent greatly what i have done in the past.  my
    innocence has been destroyed, and my love for the computer that might have
    been harnessed in the right way has caused a great hate for the computer
    in my mind.  its going away now more and more, as you see, i wrote this on
    a computer :) and again, im using it what it was meant to be used for. the
    bettering of mankind ( or a really cool toy ). i hope anyway.

    a peice of thread falls through the crack
    dont bother, its nothing, it wont be back
    and you wait, and you play and you humm a song
    i was coming back, building all along
    at first you were sad, i knew not why
    i made you scared & i made you cry
    i was back, and they knew why

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) %% chain reaction

    times end, dont start if you wont stop
    they will grow and grow and leave you 
    holdin up a mop
    cleanin up messes you left the other day
    fixin up the messes you never can repay
    theres only one thing, you just dont see
    stuff you do doesn't only affect me
    it messes up the people, who stopped and helped you be

    when its all over you should understand
    just why they stopped to lend a hand
    you couldnt see, you were blind with yourself
    reading stupid magazines, sittin on the can
    listening to losers, befriending baseles lies
    greeting the same people, who were pokin out your eyes

    but i saved myself and you should do the same
    i found out it was me, it was me who was to blame
    shame, fame, lame what is the difference
    you've been through em all, now you can see
