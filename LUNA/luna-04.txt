    (A) %% welcome

        Hello there, welcome again to luna, issue four.  So far the response
    hasn't been bad, I guess some people don't think I suck that bad.

        A lots been going on in my life, well, a lot is always going on in
    my life.  I guess thats good, I won't have any trouble coming up with
    things to write on.  But it's begining to take its tole on me, one of
    these days I'm gonna take a vacation, Chrismas I guess.

        A couple people have asked me why I release so frequently, well, my
    mood changes so frequently that I have to.  If I spent like a month on
    one issue I would be going back over and over it nitpicking and taking
    out half the stuff I wrote.  I usually write each issue in one sitting.
    They're not that big anyway.

        Anywho, get readin, if you want.

    (1) %% she saved my life, again

       as i stood there, a slight breeze blowing my hair, i couldnt help but
    to think of her.  the one who started it all.  the one who passes through
    my mind ten thousand times a second.

       shes standing right behind me.  i cant see her face but i can feel her
    presence.  i dont even know her name, damn, i wish i could say hello. why
    am i so weak.  does she know me?

       oh no, here she comes.  walking along, as an angel in flight.  not an
    angel, a girl, just a girl.  like all the others, they steal my heart
    without even knowing it, and shatter it by my own demeanor.

       whats this? shes signaling for me! why? what do i have that she should
    want, perhaps its money, or she wants to make fun of me.. thats gotta be
    it.

       hello .. i say, trying not to sound to pitiful.  i usually do.

       why do you always sit by yourself? she asks in a neutral tone, .. come
    sit with us.

       ok .. i answer in a hushed tone.  whats going on? why is she doing
    this, do they enjoy my presence? what do i bring to the group but taken
    space.  but perhaps, just perhaps, she wants me to sit with her, naw,
    that cant be it.

       maybe ill get lucky someday, maybe ill be myself, maybe this is that
    day.  maybe not.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) %% wheres all the mean people?

        Yeah, where are they!? I've met a lot of people, and most of them are
    pretty nice people.  Not angstful youths, not psycho gangsters, none of
    that.

        I think all you people who complain about everyone being jerks are so
    stuck to one side of the social spectrum when you try and confront those
    people who you think are mean, they see how extreme you are from them and
    treat you bad.

        I can get along with anyone.  From drunken black bums to nail through
    the head hardcore punkers.  I don't try and be something im not when I
    talk to people.

        Now there are some circumstances that just plain don't work like for
    instance, I couldn't just walk into s.c.la and befriend everyone.  But I
    most likely woudln't get myself into any trouble.  How is that possible?
    Well, I don't start any trouble.  When you walk into s.c.la with baggy
    jeans, dark glassed and your hat on backwards, your not going to get a
    warm reception, especially if your white.  However, if you walk in there
    like a normal person, smile and say hello to people, your likely to make
    friends with the locals instead of being a target.

        People by nature are not animals, don't treat them that way.

    (3) %% these people are stupid

    Recently while scanning the web I came across this little tidbit and it
    made me really depressed.  This is like 1/5 of the whole article, but it
    will give you an idea of what kind of people are out there.  Just a note
    to anyone who cares, im a Christian and dont do pot and I just want to
    say that this kind of extreme crap makes me sick.  It's just a bunch of
    quaker crazies that want to relate everything to satan.  These people
    are morons.

    -- begin bs --

     Through the innocently appearing guise of the "Natural Herbal High"
     called marijuana, satan has found an open doorway for invasion into
     the minds of millions of people. many a deceived christian has lost
     their salvation in christ through this deceptive device of the one
     whose purpose is to kill, steal, and destroy. the deceptive reasoning
     that satan uses is this: "god made plants for the benefit of man,
     marijuana is a plant, therefore god made it for the benefit of man. it
     opens up a person's mind so that they can flow in the spirit." the
     truth is that the spirit which this plant opens one up to is the
     spirit of the devil. this "innocent natural high" is really just the
     bait that the devil uses to captivate the soul (mind, will and
     emotions). the devil is the master of deception!!! read some case
     histories of those in mental wards, most of them started out so
     "innocently" on marijuana.

    -- end bs --

    And it goes on to talk about how pot is related to witchcraft, which by
    the way didn't make any sense, there was not one single even remotely
    direct relationship they even represented in the whole article.  I think
    they also wrote an article on how to churn butter and fix a broken wagon
    wheel too, hmm :)
