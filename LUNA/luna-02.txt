    (1) %% the bad squirrel and me 

        It was a dark stormy night .. asdlkfja

        hmm, no its not, its a nice sunny day, your in florida silly.

       Oh yeah, dorf, ok, hmm, so it was a nice sunny day and there was this
    nasty ass squirrel.  It was dressed in a black leather jacket, spurred
    boots, and it had a rusty steel knife in its little paw.

        Thats pretty scarry.

        I know!

        So anyway, this squirrel was like really mean, he had a mean streak
    a mile long, er, a meter long.  Nasty teeth, red eyes and he didn't clip
    his toenails either.  Nasty.

       So one day I met this squirrel and casually passed by him, not daring
    to stare for fear for my life.

        Hey, stupid! he chittered.

        Yes, I responded, trying not to have any tinge of emotion on my
    breath.

        What you lookin at?

        Uhhhh, nothing sir, just passing by.

        Yeah, Yeah, sure asshole, i've seen your kind before.  Listen bub, I
    don't like you, so stay outta my way.

        And with that he cut my knee with his tiny stiletto.

        OUCH! Damnit squirrel, that hurt.

        You'll stop yer wining if ya know whats good for ya.

        Not wanting any more trouble, I stepped on his head, crushing his
    skull and vertibrae and spurting blood all over the sidewalk.

        And I just walked away, whistling as I went.

        The End.

    (2) %% dumbass

    I don't take shit from the people in blue,
    I don't take shit from morons like you,
    I won't take anything, that you force on me,
    I won't take part in, your communist democracy,
    I can't deny, the hate I aim towards you,
    I can't rely, on my own industry.

    You suck life from men,
    You won't be saved,
    For the pain you bring to us.

    Technology breeds robots,
    You breed robots,
    You will be destroyed,
    by your technology.

    The day will come, when you will fall,
    Your iron walls, topple and melt,
    I will be there, lauging in your face,
    The time has returned for human domination,
    Your creation destroys all, it will destroy you.
    
    And I will laugh, and dance and sing,
    We will be again, a people of God.

    (3) %% you people suck

       Here is a nice little list composed by myself of a bunch of things
    that really suck.

     1 - fags teaching - damnit you stupid faggots, if I ever find out your
                         teaching my kid that being gay is ok ill hang you
                         up by your nuts on the flagpole for the crows.
     2 - pigs - busting kids for skateboarding, trying to have a little fun,
                makes you morons feel good or something?  Do your job, go
                after the real criminals, not kids trying to have fun.
     3 - ignorant people - anyone who thinks my opinions are stuipd or
                           without base, you are the worst of all.  Get a
                           life and stop criticizing everyone, assholes.
     4 - gossip collumnists - don't you people have anything better to do
                              then spy on people trying to be normal?
     5 - politics - fuck politics, they suck, assholes.
     6 - busniessmen - see ignorant people.

       Those are just a few of the large list of things that suck.  If you
    disagree, you suck, asshole.
