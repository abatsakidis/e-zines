This will be the last magazine under the name NERD.  No our magazine
isn't dieing, but we thought the name was lame!  So now we will be called
the Canadian Anarchists Militia, or the C.A. Militia.  We will not
start from issue 1, but will continue from the last issue of NERD.
So instead of it being C.A.M. issue 1, it will be C.A.M. issue4.
Don't worry, you can still reach us at our previous e-mail address,
for awhile, but we would prefer you use our new email address:

        CAMILITI@probfate.alive.ampr.ab.ca

So if you run a bbs, and have a directory for NERD magazine, change 
the name of the area to C.A. Militia.  

The magazine is starting to prosper, and we are ACCTUALLY GETTING 
EMAIL from all you readers out there in Cyberspace!  So that must
mean our issue 2 was a hit, and it was enjoyed by some people
out there!  Anyhow someone emailed me about setting up the internet
webpage, and by next month you should be able to access issues off
of our own webpage!  Well a web page is great, but what about all
you that don't have internet?  Well we have two boards here to 
serve you as our distribution sites:

Bethlehem               (403)477-2351           (Obv/2)
3d Relms                (403)436-0145           (Renegade)

Just let me remind you, just because the board distributes the
magazine, it dosn't make it a pir8 board.

Well we have a Microsoft Write version of this magazine with 
graphics, attached with the mag.. so tell me what you think of 
it!  All the vga graphics were done by me, because noone sent 
in any vga's.

As for the articals in this months issue, they were wipped up
by me in as short a time as I could ever have done them.  Here
is one thing I would like to say to Koei.. GET THAT DAMN PENTIUM,
AND CHUK OUT THAT 386 THAT FUCKED UP!!  Spiker assured me that
he has something in mind, but since he has no time his artical
won't be in here until next month.  So here is the magazine as
it is...

*NOTE*
Koei couldn't come through this month, so I had to through in a
backup artical.  Koei will be back next month with some original
explosives.. that you hopefully haven't heard of.  Enjoy this
lame artical.

___________
>>>INTRO<<<
^^^^^^^^^^^
        This month I have a Smoke Bomb recipe for all the people that 
love to cause confusion, or just need to get away fast, or to cause a 
distraction while you swipe the royal crown.  Well here is the Smoke 
bomb, but watch it when making this thing.  My friend burned his hand 
making this, cause he done it the wrong way.  This little toy is not
an acctual bomb, so don't make it because you hate your sister and want
to blow up her doll house.
_______________
>>>MATERIALS<<<
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        -Sugar
        -Potassium Nitrate (Peter Salt)
        -Small containers
        -Yarn
        -Gunpowder, or matches
        -Glass beaker of some sort
__________
>>>FUSE<<<
^^^^^^^^^^
        Like the Letter bomb in last months issue, you must prepare some
parts of the bomb before you make the main ingredient.  In the smoke bomb
you need to make the fuse before the smoke, because when we pour the smoke
mixture we must place the fuse into that mixutre causing the fuse to dry
inside the smoke bomb.  You can use this recipe, or Koei's from the first
artical.. his is more in depth:

        1. Take the yarn, and you can do one of two things, braid the yarn,
           or use the yarn straight.  I find that a tight braid works best.

        2. Now take the Gunpowder and mix afew drops of water into the 
           gun powder until it becomes a paste.  Rub the paste into the 
           yarn and let it dry.  You may also use matches as fuses as well.

        Don't use alcohol to make the fuse, it evaporates, dosn't burn well
and stinks when you finally get it lit.  Alcohol is also a cool flame meaning  
it might not even lite the smoke bomb.  Don't use gasoline, the gas will
evaporate on you.  You can use store bought fuses, if you can find them 
in edmonton, or fuses from firecrackers.  I recomend you make your own
fuses and test them out, a home made fuse is more reliable.
_______________
>>>PROCEDURE<<<
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        1. Take your glass beaker and fill it with 80 mL of sugar, and
           120 mL of Potassium nitrate(Peter Salt).  Mix them well.

        2. Heat this mixture over a low flame.  When the mixture starts to
           melt stir it through the hole process.  When the melted mixture 
           turns brownish in color it is ready.

        3. Pour the mixture into the small containers you have set aside, 
           and stick the fuses into them.

        Be careful you don't set this mixture on fire when you make it
because its not only very hot when the Peter Salt starts to burn, but 
causes extensive smoke damage.  If you make this right, one pound of 
this stuff will be able to fill a block with thick white smoke.  Don't 
buy the store made ones either, they barely make any smoke at all.  As
well, when melting make sure you use glass, my friend done it in a pot 
and his house was full of smoke, the metal pot turned red hot and ignited 
the mixture.  This mixture should make approx 5-8 smoke bombs.

*NOTE*
I through this in here cause Spiker didn't have enough time to
write an artical this month.  He was going to write about a 
bunch of viruses, and have some virus source codes in here.
But instead you'll get one of my first files I ever wrote.
Enjoy!

>>>What you need<<<
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        Super Soaker 20, 30, or 50 water gun
        butane lighter(Zippo or candle)
        Licopodium powder

If you are trying to find Licopodium powder you might want to try
your schools chem lab.  If you find it get as much as you can!  
If you stick a match into a pile of this it'll put the match out,
but if its spread thinly over a surface it burns big time!

Now fill the resivoir of your supersoaker full with water, and disolve
a punch of licopodium powder into it, but not to much; we don't want
the gun to clog up from a thick paste.  Now take a lighter or candle
and spray the supersoaker into the flame, now you have a homemade
flamethrower.

You may want to make a holder for your lighter(or candle) so you wouldn't 
have to hold it in your hand all the time, I recomend getting one of those 
yougart containers, take the cap and punch a hole in it, just so your 
lighter can fit in, make sure its tight.  Now use electric tape or duct 
tape tape the cap to the nosel, don't have the lighter too close to the 
nosel.  You may also want to cut a little off of each side of the cap to
be able to tape it into place properly.

        Just resently I have been on the "NET" again, and I hung
around all the old sites.  I done this all free!

        Free meaning no cost to me, or anyone else, exept for the
service I was using.  The service I was using was BIX, and it supports
ftp, telnet, VT100 lynx internet, as well as internet email.  It also
supports forums and other shit I didn't bother with.  What I used this
service mostly for was the Telnet, ftp, and Internet.  Here is how you
can access this fine service free!

        First you must find a credit card generator!  I suggest you
get Credit Master v4, but we will supply you with Credit Master v3.
Run the program and go to (G)enerate Cards.  All the numbers that
start with 4 are VISA, 5's are Master Card, and 6 I do belive its
Discovery card.  Well find a bank you would like to use, and then
hit the escape button.  You will be prompted to enter the number of
the bank.  Type in the number of the bank you have selected and you
will be prompted again.  This time you must select how many cards you
are to generate.  Don't generate more than 20 cards at a time, and
write them down.  I always generate 10 cards, but 20 max for all you
lil' carders out there.  This is so you use more than one bank for
carding.

        Now you must log into the system, using Tymnet.  The tymnet
dialup for the alberta area is:

   Phone Number --------Location-------- Speed -Provider- TXT IP ---Plans----
1. 403-264-5472 Calgary, AB ............ 9600  Tymnet*...  Y  -  Value  Unlim
2. 403-232-6653 Calgary, AB ............ 2400  Tymnet*...  Y  -  Value  Unlim
3. 403-484-4404 Edmonton, AB ........... 2400  Tymnet*...  Y  -  Value  Unlim
4. 403-487-9394 Edmonton, AB ........... 9600  Tymnet*...  Y  -  Value  Unlim
* Tymnet $9/hr surcharge applies Mon-Fri 6AM-6PM (except certain holidays).

This was taken from Delphi's data base, and the speeds are wrong, the
modems may have been upgraded.  Don't worry its your card that gets
charged the $9/hr surcharge not your own number.  This should help you,
but if you live outside of alberta I suggest you get a local number from
your computer store, or you may call long distance to any of these
numbers, type the letter "o" when a bunch of symbols cross your screen,
and for the user type "DELPHI".  Once connected to Delphi type in the
logon name "JOINDELPHI" and type anything for the passwords(you will
be prompted 3 times).  Enter a bunch of bogus information for everything
exept for your province and the phone number, but not your real home
number (eg. 403-555-5555).  After a bunch of screens you should get
prompted an area code.  This is where you get the tymnet dialups.
You should get a list like the one above.

        Anyhow call up your local Tymnet dialup and enter the letter
"o" when a bunch of characters come on your screen.  Then when prompted
for a user type "BIX".  When you get connected to bix type "new" and
create yourself a new account with a bunch of bogus, but realistic
information.  When asked for a Credit Card, select one of the cards
you generated(no spaces).  Finish the account.

        After it creates the account it should freeze up.  Well it
dosn't freeze up, it's just trying to verify your credit card, so
you should hang up and call back.  This time don't type new but type
in your account name you have picked, and your password.

        Well you are now in, but these accounts usually last for about
a few hours.  Some last over night, some get suspended before you
even log on.  It depends which Bank you select, different banks take
different lenghts of time to verify.  Fool around with the generators
and find a bank that takes a while to verify you.  Oh and don't worry
about being watched!
        Some services like Delphi don't let you onto their system untill
they verify your credit card, but look around and you might find afew
services that let you on before you are verifyed.
__________
>>>TIPS<<<
^^^^^^^^^^
        -Try big banks, they take longer.
        -Don't use the same bank more then 3 times in a row.
        -Don't try to sell acounts, well you can try.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In Edmonton not many H/p/a or Pir8 boards up, but we are planning
on getting a number or two for a couple pir8 boards in calgary

but hopefuly next month you will see a big change.

The list since December 1996.  All of these are local to EDMONTON:

3d Relms                        436-0145                (Renegade)

Unholy Ground                   417-1116                (Renegade)

These BBS(s) are back up again:

Super Unknown Archives          475-8197                (Unknown)

BBS(s) gone private, meaning you must now pay to get on:

Letter from Editor
------------------
A big hello to all the Elite out in this world of Anarchy, 
and Havoc.  Here is my beef:
Well this month I would like to stress how lame a certain
person that goes by the Name Poision Ice, is.  Well he is a
little mutherfuck, with crappy articals, and everything
he says is a deathwish!  His hobbie is to make enemies,
and get the crap beaten out of him.  Well I just had
to use this little space to express my hateful feelings
toward this jackass, whom I know personally.  Enjoy

                  EDMONTON HIGH SCHOOL ILLEGAL SHIT UPDATE!
                  -----------------------------------------
There is little on this section of the magazine to write about,
since our high schools aren't doing anything really illegal
anymore.  But we will keep posting information as it comes, as
well as information on the schools computer systems.  If you're
wondering, what is the use of having information about a stupid
school computer lab, here is a reason.
If you were to go visit any of these schools, and were to happen by
a computer lab, you would know ahead of time what hacker tools, notes,
codes, or devices to bring.  And then again there are people that
just want to know about different school systems.
Well we have a new school in here this month.. but not much on
it.
Well at Eastglen, the school of the Macintosh, the Mac Classics are
going to be taken out by the end of the school year.  So start
hopeing for a new lab of computers arriving.
At Queen E. the library has installed eight new Pentium 133mhz
computers running under windows 95, with internet access.  Some of
the computers have the issential plugins for the Netscape Navigator,
so you can access all those high tech web pages without difficulty.
These computers are built and ready for the internet, and as many
schools have, the newest Internet Nanny installed.
Our connection in Paul Kane High has little to inform us,
exept that there are three computer labs in his school.  Two labs are
made up of Compaq 486's, and the third lab is made up of 386's.
Well thats it for this month, the other schools stayed silent.  So
send in all your news about your school.

                              --------------
If you haven't heard of the gang North side yet, you must either
live in another city, or have no television.  The Northside gang's
logo is a big N with an S in the lower right hand corner.  Well anyhow
the cops nabbed some of the members of this gang, and here is what I
have from the story.  The lame cops came across some female in a hotel
and she lead them to a little house down in the north side of town,
around 137th avenue.  The news artical on itv went by so fast,
I might be wrong on the address.  There were 4 men arrested and
charged for the beating of a few people, the men were already wanted
so that will add to there court load.

                            BACKDOOR IN YOUR CHIP!
                            ----------------------
There is a rumor going around that IBM and Federal Agents are trying
to get the government to let them make a back door in the computer
processor alowing FEDERAL AGENTS to go into your computer either when
its off or on, and see what you have as in files, and what you have
been doing lately.  The government might reject this idea, but don't
get worried because this is just a rumor and may not be true.  This 
may be a rumor, just going around about the states.

                           BBS's goin Down by 2000
                          -------------------------
We got from a reliable source that works in and around microsoft that
by the year 2000 the government is going to try and shut down all the
BBS's, and leave a few BBS's watched by the government.  They say there
is too much pir8ing going around, and credit card numbers are being
passed through these bbs's.  They think this will have a better hold on
this type of crime.  This may only be for the U.S. since MicroSoft is a
U.S. company, but it may happen in Canada.  But this idea might fail
since pir8 boards are hard to come by if you arn't told the number.
This "reliable" source is also a new source that didn't speak with me but
a member of N.E.R.D. so it could be just another rumor.

                     Teleconferencing with N.E.R.D. members
                                and CATSlash.
                     ---------------------------------------
About the teleconference, we have figured out how we are going to
do this, but haven't worked out all the details yet.  For you 
who don't know what the hell I'm talking about I was refering 
to what was discussed in the November Issue (Issue 2).
Jeriatrick is awaiting some information before we can continue.
N.E.R.D. members don't worry, the conference will not be tapped
and listened into by Telus operators.  So you may discuss anything
you wish, just don't be an idiot and reveil your name or anyone
elses.
If you want to get into the action I sugest you contact either me
EleCtriK FirE or Jeriatrick to get in.  Remember you must be a
member of either CATSlash or N.E.R.D. to get in.  Don't bother
applying if you are a cop, we know how to verify you, and find out
if you are who you say you are.  Your chances of getting into
the group are slim, unless you are a personal friend/accuaintence
of someone in our group.  Longdistance teleconferencers are welcome
(Free of cost).

                          The Tellus Phone Company
                          ------------------------
Tellus if paranoied these days because of a phreaker that goes
by the name JIM CHAMZUK has been phreaking the operators again.
So if you were planning on going and screwing with the operator,
I wouldn't suggest doing that for a while.
On another note, if you don't already know this yet, when you dial
long distance from a payphone, you get the operator and not the
recorded message they had before.  So the red box is hard to use
if you have no change.  Have on you at least five cents when red
boxing.  Deposit the 5 cent coin and run the rest of the tones.
The operator won't run the call through if the payphone dosn't get
a coin into it, since the new payphones have a sensor in the 
machine, and it dosn't display the money for the operator.

                      Issue 2, November `96  File 4 of 7
                      ----------------------------------
In the RED BOX artical I said I would have the file "QUARTER.VOC"
in the archive.  Well to my dissmay the Rusty Bedsprings BBS is
no longer existent.  But it dosn't matter because I have a 
program for you BOXTONE v1.00 сeta version, attached to the
magazine.  It requires a Soundblaster card, enjoy.

                       Issue 2, November `96 File 3 of 7
                       ---------------------------------
Well here is an update on the artical.  The collecion agency sent 
my parents a little note saying I won't be prosecuted if they pay
a little sum of money to the K-mart chain.  It wasn't a large 
sum, but my parents didn't pay it to "teach me a lesson!"  Well
anyhow I will be going to civil court soon to recive my 
"punishment."  
Civil court is a normal court, exept without a judge or jury to 
convict you.  A bunch of civilians are picked, and they decide 
what should be done with you.  More on this as it happens.
