Yet another Negative Energy Remade Destructive issue out there on the
net.  We got a few new writers on here, and we have a few new members
as well.  We can't wait to get the new writers into our magazine
but we will have to get thier articals next month.  If you wish to
become a writer we would appreciate it if you would send in our
application before the end of the month.  We hope you enjoy this
issue.

The magazine is undergoing changes and we have desided we are going to
add an ansi art section to the magazine.  If you are an ammature artist
or a pro, we would like to see your talants, so draw up a sample of your
work and it will be placed in the magazine.  If you are a Gif artist,
or make RIP's send them in as well.  Another change we are doing with
the magazine is to make a Microsoft Write version of the magazine,
with graphic images and different colored fonts, giving the magazine
a better look and style.  Suggestions are welcome, and we hope you will
become apart of this magazine.  But don't fear there will always be a
text version out there.

The magazine has desided to set up the N.E.R.D. web page for a wider
area of distribution, and it should be up soon.  But as we all know
you need an internet supplier first, and of course find the funds
to pay them.  So if there is an internet supplier out there that
is willing to provide us with a web page for no or little cost,
we would be REALLY glad to hear from you.  I might set up a board on
an old 286 I have, and use my spare 14.4 modem, but I don't have any
cash right now for the line so it might be a while before we get the
board up.  So untill we get enough cash for an internet supplier, and
a line for the board, we will be uploading this magazine to the different
boards and internet sites instead.

Well in this issue we have:

  Making Fuse!  

  Hello. I agreed to write an artile for the creator of this magazine but
  have recently found myself rather short of time, and don't have as much 
  as required to type out too much for now, so i thought maybe a lesson
  on fuse would do for now, and probably something that will not be picked
  as an article in this magazine for some time. Alright first things first.
  You will need the following for this type of fuse:

  MATERIALS:
  1: Black powder FFFG grade.
  2: Parcel wrapping twine. <The thick white cotton type>
  3: Powder dextrin.
  4: Wood alcohol <methanol>


      Black Powder is easily gotted from gun stores, and costs maybe $5 to 
  $8 per pound. <Please note that homemade powder and substitutes usually
  won't give very good results in this case>. To make this fuse, you will 
  need what is called "Meal powder". To make this, all you have to do is 
  grind the black powder <One teaspoon at a time> in a mortar and pestle.
  <NOT the one used for oxidizers>. Grind it as fine as it will go, but
  take your time, GO EASY! Keep all the powders seperate from that which
  you are grinding.

      After the powder is ground, measure 1 pint of water and 8 ounces of
  alcohol into a large bowl. While stirring this mixture, add about two 
  tablespoons of dextrin. Stir until no lumps remain. Continue stirring 
  while slowly adding the meal powder a little at a time until the 
  mixture assumes the consistency of thin honey or molasses. Cut a 20
  foot length of parcel post twice and boil it clean water for about 
  5 minutes to remove any preservatives or other impurities that it might
  contain.

  After washing, stir the string into the black powder, but rememeber 
  to leave a bit sticking out of the bowl so you can pull it out with
  ease. Stir until the string has soaked well. Let it soak for about
  3 hours or so. After it has finished soaking, hang it out like a
  clothesline and remove access globs of mixture. The string should be
  bigger and round after this. Put on a bit of extra power while it is 
  still wet. Rememeber to catch the access in a pan so it can be used for 
  later. When the fuse is totally dry, store it in a cool place away from 
  any heat source! 

       Please note that this fuse is not waterproof! Do not, under any
  circumstances, Try to waterproof it with tape or anything else! This
  will cause it to burn from beggining to end instantly!!! Also, all fuses
  should be tested for burning rate. Measure off a foot and see how long
  it takes to burn down. Different batches of fuse will have a different
  burning rate...every time you make it...so test with every new batch.

       I will get more for the writer of this magazine later, I hope this
  is ok for now.

        Shoplifting can be a pain in the ass and yet save you a few bux as
well but only if your a smart shoplifter.  Me I was just arrested at the
K-Mart west exit in Northwood mall, today!  Here is how it happened, and
how to beat the fuckin mall security.

        Me and a friend have been shoplifting from these bitches for a while,
walking in to the store almost everyday.  Going to the same section, coming 
out with nothing in our hands, and leaving.  This wasn't what got me fucked 
over, the cameras they had posted up did!  

        I went "shopping" alone today, and I looked really suspisious!  I 
walked over and stood around a long time, got a bunch of shit then took off.  
I was being really careful, but not careful enough.  They caught me as I left 
the store.  They know they can't arrest you unless they have solid proof 
that your ripping them off.  If you have hidden an item, they can sometimes 
get you by that, but sometimes they can't.  So they wait untill you leave 
the store before they attack.  Why?  Because you can say, "I was going 
to pay for it, then you grabbed me!  I just put it there for now!"  So 
they need you to try and take off.  

        This sales person comes up to me and grabs me.  "Security, your
under arrest!"  The jerk takes me through the K-mart, passed the resturant,
and into the storage area.  There he turned me left and right into a little
room with a heavy steel door.  A prison cell in a store!  No just the 
security office.  There a desk sits, and two t.v's, radios, and a stack of
papers.  They made me sit in a chair opposite the door, in the left hand 
corner of the room.  They searched my belongings and took out the stuff, 
and read me my rights.  If you don't have anything on you then don't let 
them search your stuff, tell them they can't search you, and that you will 
only let the Edmonton Police search you.  When the cops do search you and 
your clean, you can complain to the store manager, or the chain and get
something for your troubles.  
                              
        The first thing the bitch done to scare me, and intimidate me was
pull out her set of nice silver handcuffs and put them on the desk.  If
its your first time being caught at anything don't worry, you won't wear
them.  They asked me a bunch of questions, and I answered them with nice 
short answers.  I sat there quietly with a sad, sorry, pityful look on my 
face trying to play with thier sympathy.  The bitch called the cop, and I 
had to wait.  The cop came and double checked all the information I gave
them.  The address, phone, mothers name, they asked it again to make sure 
I wasn't lieing.  Here is an important tip, never lie when you are caught 
or else they slap the cuffs on right away.  They took my picture and a 
picture of the goods.  Then the cop gave me two options.  One I either 
get charged, or because it was my first offence I get to say I'm guilty 
and I talk to a lawyer.  The lawyer sets up a bunch of community service 
hours for you and you don't get a record, or so they say.  But you don't 
get the hours if you have been caught doing something illegal before, and 
done hours for another crime.  Only then will you get charged right away, 
get the cuffs slaped on, and taken to court.  How ever I was taken to court
anyway.  They take you to court, and the court desided what to do with you.
You can apply for alternitive measures, which I of course am doing, but you 
may be rejected like my friend was for breaking a guys noise.
         
        The cop made me march out of the store with him.  He made me walk 
ahead of him, then asked if this has changed me, and would I lift again.  
He has to do this infront of all the people to get me screwed with the 
public watching.  He drove me home, and because my mom wasn't home he 
said he would call.  I thought it would be like the last time the cops 
said they would call, and forget, but sure as hell at six the phone rang.  
He cop told my mom I was caught shoplifted, and that he was coming over.  
But my mom told him she was going out for about an hour and a half, the 
cop said he would come by then.  But he came right after he hung up, 
thinking she was lieing, but my mom was gone anyhow so he left.  He 
stayed outside my house waiting to see if I lied about my mom already 
leaving, but when he saw she really was gone he left.
__________
>> TIPS <<
^^^^^^^^^^
        1. Always co-operate, they might let you off.  
        2. Don't lie, or speak rudely to the cop.
        3. Never say "What smells like bacon".
        4. When lifting always lift with a buddie.
        5. Buy something from the target area once in a while.
        6. If your being watched my personal and don't have 
           enough privacy to unload the loot, go buy something
           so they don't get fucked up on you.
        7. Always carry a few bux, and never anything illegal.
        8. Don't get caught.
        9. Better yet don't shoplift.

        When they do catch you don't be scared, walk quietly with them with
a normal peaceful look on your face.  No one noticed me while I was grabbed,
or pulled into the back room.  If the staff see you they don't care, they 
see this drill at least once a day.  All in all this wasn't too bad, just 
the next time I get caught I get a record and I go to court.  The only 
thing wrong with this is that I'm banned from all K-marts in canada for 
two years, and get community service.

I was in a chat with spiker once, and we got into a disscusion, and
he gave me the plans for a red box.  I trapped the teleconference
we had, and then asked if he would mind if he would come and 
write as a phreaker for N.E.R.D.  He agreed, and I disided to
place this into the magazine this issue.  This log has been
altered slightly to disguise the board this was done on, and
to shelter the people that loged on while we chatted.  Next month
we will have a REAL file from our good old buddie Spiker.. Enjoy
the reading folks.

Do you hack?
ФФФФФФ Message Sent...
[Spiker] Well, there are only about 3 REAL hackers on the planet.  Most of the
people you meet are posers.. Basically if anyone claimes to be a hacker, they
are not!
Yayayayaya, Phiber Optic and the other LOD, MOD members that got busted.
ФФФФФФ Message Sent...
See I read WIRED Magazine too! :)
ФФФФФФ Message Sent...
[Spiker] Yeah.. that sort of thing... All I know is how to get a few free phone
calls, and stuff like that.. (can even make a few tasty bombs <but I wouldn't
even if paid>)

K00l.. ya the free phone stuff is c00l, but I don't know how to do that.  THe bl
ue box is hard to make... and I don't know anything about electronics.
ФФФФФФ Message Sent...
[Spiker doesn't actually read wired, believe it or not.]
[Spiker] It is pretty easy to make one that'll work on the Edmonton phone
system.. Actually, the red box works mostly on the "Hearing Impaired" phones in
this city (they still use the old A.C.T.S. system).
Huh??
ФФФФФФ Message Sent...
[Spiker] The red-box (gives free calls on public (coin-opperated) telephones.
The red-box I know how to make will work on the Edmonton pay-phones with the
Volume adjustor (for people with hearing problems).
>spiker C00l... how do you make a red box?
ФФФФФФ Message Directed to Spiker...
[Spiker] Okay, wanna learn how?
>spiker Ya, of course! :)
ФФФФФФ Message Directed to Spiker...
[Spiker] Does your computer have a sound-card?
YA it has one
ФФФФФФ Message Sent...
[Spiker] Do you have access to the Internet?
No, I don't have access to the net.
ФФФФФФ Message Sent...
[Spiker] Hmm, well to make it you need a file called "Quarter.voc".. I uploaded
it once to Rusty Bedsprings BBS (XXX XXXX) and then you'll need abou $20 bux in
materials
[Spiker] First, go out and buy one "Hallmark digital recording greeting card)
from a hall mark store.. You'll also need a stereo or mono speaker plug in, an
STSC switch, and a speaker out of head phone.. Maybe a tape case too.
[Spiker] First open up the hallmark card and pull out all the guts, but don't
break any wires yet.
ya...
ФФФФФФ Message Sent...
[Spiker] Second, tag the wires going to the little paper switch, and not which
wires are record, and which are play.  They wire the wires to your STSC switch
and just lable the record and play sides.
[Spiker] Third, clip the wires to the speaker, and hook them up to your mono or
stereo mike jack.. Basically then you just plug that into the speaker outlet on
your soundcard, and get ready to make a recording.
ya..
ФФФФФФ Message Sent...
[Spiker] Once pluged in, flip the STSC switch to "record" and play the
"Quarter.voc" file a few times, (like for 4 bucks worth). ALso, vary the delsay
between playings so that it sounds natural (like you are strugling with your
change).
[Spiker] Okay, so now swich you STSC to the "Off" position and grab your
plastic tape case (just for containing the mess...
[Spiker] Now you can drill a hole about 1/4 inch in diameter into the side of
the tapecase, and also cut out a place for your STSC Switch.
[Spiker] Before grabbing your crazy-glue and sticking it all together, you need
to clip off your mono or stereo mike-jack and wire the leads into yor walkman
speaker..
[Spiker] Then you just glue your switch, speaker, microchip, and battery into
your tape case, and BINGO.. one Red-box.
[Spiker takes a bow!]

-------End log here----------------------------------------------------------

All right Spiker... well anyhow you don't need the rusty bedsprings number
becuase I have the file for you.  But if your computer can't run any
*.voc files you can use any *.wav file of a 25 cent tone.  Next month
Spiker tells me that he might tell us how to make some kinda switchy 
thing out of your remote, to control the traffic lights on your street.
See you can meet nice people in chat rooms!

>>A little Note<<
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Last month I had a few boards in here that were not pir8 boards, but
still elite boards.  I appologise to the sysops of these boards.  But
do not dispare, we acctually do have some good pir8 boards in the
4o3 so here are the few we have.

Here is a short list of the Pir8 Boards in the 4o3 that are up and working
since November 1996.  All of these are local to EDMONTON:

3d Relms                        436-0145                (Renegade)
Anthanum Rage                   478-0240                (Renegade)
Genocide node(1)                998-2641                (Renegade)
         node(2)                998-5049                (Renegade)
Node Zero                       478-1731                (Renegade)
Planet Mother Fucker            440-6697                (Renegade)

Here are a the boards that are _NOT_ pirate board related in any way, 
again sorry to the Sysops that complained:

Heart Of Darkness               (Ansi Board)    
pUnjab                          (Ansi Board)
Rebellion                       (Ansi Board)
Cathotic Pleasures              (Ansi Board)

These boards are no longer in service, so take them out of your
lists:

Tears Of Rage                   (Not Up)
Bethlehem                       (Not Up)
Super Unknown Archives          (Not Up)
Darkworld                       (Not Up)
Hell                            (Not Up)

If you have a Pir8 board, or a H/P/A/C/V board up and want it to be
displayed here, just drop us a line via E-mail:

                nerd@probfate.alive.ampr.ab.ca

Or if you wish to become a distro for our magazine, or if you wish

Letter from Editor
------------------
Our last writer for this section, Dejavu was let go resently, the 
reason was that he was moving away from us.  We may get him back, 
and yet again we may not.  So from now I will be doing this section
unless he comes back.  
We got quite a bit of news this month, but from brousing ourselves.  
The hacking, phreaking, and anarchist public desided they were to 
lazy to send in information.  So we are going to do most of the news 
ourselves, and if you want to send in any information we would be happy 
to take it and expand on the story.  
I was surprised at the amount of news there was this time, because
when I first sat down to write this section of the magazine I had
what looked like very little.  But then I gathered up all of the
conversations I have had with people over the past month, out of the
little space in my head that never stores what I learn at school, and
yet can give you a recipe for any type of explosive you want, out and 
started with the artical.  So finally I got it done, and took out the 
negative comment I had put here.
But yet another note I would like to stress is that we as albertans suck 
when it comes to illegal activity.  The occasional counterfitting, 
murder or rape and nothing else.  The telephone company sits back and 
relaxes, and the cops are sitting on their big fat asses, pigging out 
on dounuts!  There is almost no Hacking or phreaking activity here in 
edmonton to worry any of the two.  Of course the gang problem is rising 
for the cops, but the gangs just beat up on other gangs, or civilians.
There are a few people that make explosives, and homemade wepons as a 
hobbie, but no hackers or phreakers out there.  Well we want all the 
hackers/phreakers out there, however few there maybe, to drop us a line.  
Oh well enough with the bitching, enjoy the artical!

                  EDMONTON HIGH SCHOOL ILLEGAL SHIT UPDATE!
                  -----------------------------------------
This month we have very little on this topic.  It is extreamly difficult 
to write for a magazine if you have no information from the public.  
Luckly we have some information so its not down the drain, yet.
Our connection in Ainley dosn't care about computers so he/she dosn't
know what type they have there.  But we were able to find out that
a few friends of his/hers had been busted for carrying around counterfit 
bills.  As well many that go here do drugs, and if you want it you got it.
All in all not much shit in ainley.
At Queen E. not much to report, just a couple of fights this past month.
The computers have no access to the a:, because the CMOS was changed to
prevent students from bringing in disks.  But our connection in Queen E.
is working on cracking the password, or so he/she says.
At Eastglen we have our neigbourhood friendly hacker screwing with the
system.  Have you been noticing that you can now go in and alter the
computer settings this past month?  Well you can thank our MacHacker
for finding a hole, and alowing that.  He/she told us that the system
was running a program that protected the files, but with one flaw.  It
didn't protect itself.  So he screwed with the program and then with 
the network.  
As well we got an unreliable source(Poison Ice) telling us that there 
might be a gay teacher at Eastglen, so if a teacher of your own sex 
starts to come onto you, I would run.  But yet again it comes from the 
jerk Poison Ice, who has been wrong many a time before.  This was 
placed in here not because we discriminate against gays, but because
it helps make the magazine look biger.  The more we have the more
we provide.
No news from Vic. and Ross Shep this month, but we hope to get some
more information for you people that acctually care.  

                              The North Side
                              --------------
As you may have heared by now, there is a new gang out to hit the
streets of Edmonton.  The gang that calls itself the North Side, 
leaving its mark with a large N.S.  The gang is fairly large, and 
from what I hear is that they hang around the Colesium area.  Just 
resently the a transit stop or station(can't remember) was vandalized 
by this gang, boosting their popularity, with the medias help.  From
my friend and buddie's point of view he puts their work into these
simple words "It looks perty!"  All I wish is that this group pick 
up phreaking, or hacking.  An army of hackers that get the media
to print articals on "TELLUS CRASHED BY PHREAKER" or "HACKER, 
TERRORISING POLICE!" and then I will be fully satisfied.  Nice
job, but take up phreaking.. more interesting.  Just don't trash 
my neighborhood! :)

                     Teleconferencing with N.E.R.D. members
                                and CATSlash.
                     ---------------------------------------
I EleCtriK FirE and Jeriatrick(editor of Catslash Magazine), got together
and we desided that the 4o3 needs a teleconference for all the phreakers
and hackers out there.  So we want to set up a teleconference, either
2600hz or a plain old conference charged to some poor sucker, but
we need phreakers and hackers, or just willing members to call.  We 
haven't set it up yet but we are thinking about it, and we want your 
input on the subject.  When we set up the conference only members of 
CATSlash Magazine and N.E.R.D. H/P/A magazine will have access to the
conference.  To join fill out the N.E.R.D. application and where it asks
you to put why you want to join, just put the phreaker teleconference.
You will be required to have an genuine I.D. for member meets, and this
will be supplied to you.  Join as soon as possible, we don't want no
cops in there so we will have the offer open to all for a short while,
then it will be ref's only.  Jeriatrick and I are working out difficulties
on the subject, so it might be a month or two before the conference is
set up.  So get in now, or never.

                          The Tellus Phone Company
                          ------------------------
As you all should know by now, there is a new phone company in 
town that goes by the name Tellus.  This company is made up of 
two companies, EdTel and AGT.  If you haven't noticed yet, there
have been many Tellus personal going around and changing all of
the EdTel symbols to Tellus.  So next time you go to vandalize
a phone booth, stop buy a phone booth untouched by the Tellus 
jerks, and take home a bunch of soviners for yourself, then 
go vandalize a Tellus booth instead.  Some news report says 
that Tellus offers the lowest cost on long distance calls
then sprint, and AT&T, beating them by a few cents.  If you
are wondering why I didn't add UniTel is because AT&T bought 
them out.  AT&T is mainly a cellular phone service, so thier 
veichals aren't worth breaking into.  
The fools at Tellus payed a guy about a quarter of a million 
dollars just to draw up a logo of a stupid T!  These idiots 
have mearged most of their switching boards, giving phreakers
more oppourtunities to slip by undetected.  You may have noticed  
the nice skyscraper with the Tellus logo on it, its just thier 
office, so don't bother hanging around their much.
As well there is a nother telephone company from coming to 
edmonton from Ontario called Fonarola.  They have been supplying
some Albertains with cheap long distance calls for the past 
year already, but only to those that knew about it.  Well 
now they are coming to Edmonton to set up their lines, not      
rent but set up their own!  And since Tellus has their lines
set up along all the main streets, Fonarola is going to have
to set them up in back alleys.  We are not sure if Fonarola
is going to set up their lines in back alleys, but where else
can they?  So all you phreakers take to the streets and bring 
Tellus & Fonarola to its nees.

                         What Happened to Bell?
                         ----------------------
Well what did happen to Ma Bell?  This question plagued me for
a long time.  I keep reading all of these phreakers texts from
the 1980's and before, and it keeps refering to Ma Bell.  Not
AT&T, but Ma Bell.  Well what happened was AT&T Canada went 
and bought out all of Ma Bell.  So now the States operate with  
AT&T and so dose Canada.  Now since our economies are so great
more and more phone companies are springing up, each different
in its own way.  But I always wonder, if Ma Bell was still around,
would it have bought out AT&T?  Well we will never know will we.

                      Issue 1, October `96  File 2 of 6
                      ---------------------------------
This artical was on HACKING compuserve, and some information was
parialy wrong.  The telenet number that was given was legit, but
to type CIS into the telenet prompt was not.  The artical told
that it might work, and might not.  Well it dosn't work, but instead
I have gone out to get you a 1-800 number for you.  The one 1-800
number that I found is to a Compuserve service.  You call with your
modem and it helps you find a Compuserve near your area.  So all you
hackers out in Calgary, Leduc, Edmonton, Loidminster, and even
in Quebec(Tho we don't care for you, since you want to leave us
little asswipes!) can call it up and get your information.  The
presious number to this sacred place(ya right) is:

        1-800-FIND-CIS  (1-800-346-3247)

I'm not sure if this is to the Compuserve service, but when I called
by voice a modem picked up.  This was taken out of a two year old
1-800 bbs list.  Have fun hackin your way through this sleezy 
good for nothing service.


                           N.E.R.D. Special Report
                                October 1996
                           -----------------------
In october N.E.R.D. released a special report, on CATSlash member                                
Poision Ice.  The report was on how Poision Ice had his asshole 
put on backwards, and what N.E.R.D. was gonna do to him.  The
purpose of this special report was to get an appology out of
Poison Ice, and to scare the Hell out of him.  And it worked,
here is the "appology" poison ice sent us.  Some modifications
have been done because the idiot typed it up in Write:

  I Poision ice, of sound Phreaking mind and body, do totally take 
  back all of the insulting comments in issue 2 of cats magazine,
  I do apologize to electric fire and his N.E.R.D. magazine for any 
  harmful effects my article may of had.                  

                                                                 Signed, 
                                                             Poision ice 

I will first start off by saying no damage was done, because his 
artical sucked, and he isn't really known.  Second, it was really
halarious to see him but-kiss to us.  Third, to slaughter his
writing style.  As you can see there are many commas in the
paragraph, and only one period for the ending.  All in all we
at N.E.R.D. hope there are no hard fellings felt by Poision Ice,
and if there were we wouldn't really care because of all his 
"N.E.R.D. bashing"s latley.

I or N.E.R.D. in no way inforce or recomend violence, or vandilism, 
but I do persue a phreaking and hacking community.  I am saddened at 
the people that kill, and vandalize property.  Of course a telephone 
booth dosen't count in this case because its the property of blood 
thirsty, money crazed business men, that could offer the service for 
pennies!  All the bombs and home made wepons here you can make, and 
play with, but never with human life.
