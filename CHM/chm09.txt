This is maybe the 4th time I'm rewriting the intro!  Why you ask, well 
because I've been busy doing shit, and well been a little lazy.  Going
back to school has made me pretty busy, cause all I do now is "hang out"
with friends.  Only problem now is that shitty cold weather outside, so
I'm gonna be finding myself indoors alot, and probably on the computer.
This will be one of our worser issues here at CHM, since its been about
3 months I do belive since the last issue came out.. and some of my 
writers (CComp666, and TRON) are having setbacks(CComp lost his computer,
and TRON is busy with his own group the DarkSide Hackers).  

All right.. I need to get something straight with all the readers out there
in never nether land!  This group used to be called N.E.R.D., and when we
had a name change that wasn't only the magazine, but the group aswell.  
THERE IS NO MORE NERD, its the chm.  I hope this clears things up for
some people.

There have been a few complaints about the new webpage.. that the gif's
wern't loading properly.  Well it turns out this has been happening for
the people not using netscape.. but using the MicroSoft Internet explorer,
or comeing in through AOL.  I suggest using Netscape, and for the AOL
hackers you can setup Netscape through AOL, just goto the aol inet screen
and get the files.  But I do belive I have corrected the problems, but
you should still use NETSCAPE, its much better then the crap AOL uses, and
Microsoft explorer.  The new page uses FRAMES, but I will be getting a
new non frames page for you lynx users.

Sorry about our last issue.. for some reason the archive was damaged when
it was being uploaded to our ISP, then to the page.  It should be fixed,
so anyone that hasn't downloaded our latest issue(issue8), you can still
get it from Bethlehem, or our webpage at members.tripod.com/~havoc403/ 
and use netscape.

Well I'm gonna be doing another transformation to the magazine AGAIN,
so if you see things changeing over the course of time.. don't freak out.

Sorry fer being late.. here it is:

Earlier this month the idea for a pencil launcher came to mind.  I wasn't
thinking some crappy launcher that would poke the person, causeing a sting.
I was thinking something more lethal.  Then I saw one of my childhood toys
laying around, a G.I. Joe and its little rocket launcher.  The action figure
didn't intrest me as much as the rocket launcher(it fires peices of plastic
that look like a missle, for those that don't know).  I broke it open and
examined how it worked.  Hey I could do the same thing with a pencil, but
use a stronger spring.. say a spring from an air rifle.  I thought I would
take some sort of pipe that would fit a pencil or pen, and on the
end have a triger type mechanizm attached to the end of the pipe

                                                        (o=bolt)
like above.  This would all be held down on maybe a peice of wood, metal,
or strong plastic.  I would then put a slit in the pencil so when it was 
loaded it would hold in place until fired.  But then I decided this may
not be that great of a weapon(but you can use it if you want to fool 
around).  So I decided to go another route.

So get a peice of pipe that is twice as long as the pencil or pen(whatever
you will be using as ammo).  If you are going to use a variety of ammo
(pencils, pens, compases, erasers, nails, etc..) I suggest making one the 
lenght of the longest of the projectiles.  For this project you'll need 
the following:
        
        1   pipe that is twice as long as the ammo, and fits the ammo
            in the pipe so the ammo is nice and snug(not too snug).
        1   end cap for the pipe.
        1   Drill or anything that will make a hole in the pipe.
        And a bunch of gunpowder or your choice of explosive compound that
        won't shatter the pipe but launch your ammunition.
        Some matches.
        And a fuse or two.

Screw the end cap on to the pipe, and mark a spot on the pipe that is 2cm
away from the end cap. 
Next drill a hole through the pipe that would fit the fuse or big enough
to stick a match head in.
Now to load the weapon.  Take some fuse, and run it through the hole.  Then 
take some gunpowder and put it in the pipe over top of the fuse packing the
gunpowder down with the pencil.  There its loaded!
I suggest you test different ammounts of gunpowder until you find a quantity 
that you can handle, and that you like.  Start off with small portions, you
don't want to put too much and blow your hand off and get a face full of 
shrapnel.  
This is ready to use, but I would prefer having some sort of handle attached 
to the pipe(you'd probably want that too).  I'll let you figure out what you 
are going to use to make your handle.  Just make sure that the hole for the 
fuse is to the side and not on top.  So go and shoot at yer sister, or the
geek that sits at the front of the class.

So.. you now have two prototypes on a pencil gun(sounds lame eh?).  The 
gunpowder gun would be like a zip gun from the days of columbus.  Where the
steel shot would be replaced with a pencil.  
If you are caught with the gunpowder pencil launcher is considered a firearm,
so you will be charged.  I don't think the cop would charge you if he found 
the spring weapon on you.. unless you pissed him off and shot him or 
something.  Have phun with this mischivous toy.

Well I have a AT&T 3610, and a while back I went looking for information
on reprogramming it.  What I found was alot of information on nokia, 
motorola, and OKI 900's.. but nothing for my phone.  The only place
I found some information was on DR WHO's radiophone archive, and on there
they said the AT&T 3610 was like the NEC P100.  They were wrong, the 3610
is similar to the NEC P100, but different when it comes to the nam.  I tried 
many a time to get into test mode, but it wouldn't let me.  Well here is the 
correct procedure for getting into the AT&T 3610 test mode:

        1.  Turn cellphone ON
        2.  punch in the 4 digit lock code (default is 0000)
        3.  Then press FCN, 9
        4.  it should display 0000P, so type in another four zero's(0000)
            after the P
        5.  Then press FCN, MEM, 76
        6.  Press MEM, #01
        7.  Press MEM, #71
        8.  Press #, the 10 digit phone number(the new one), #
        9.  Now enter in a 4 digit lock code, then press #.  I suggest you
            leave it at 0000
        10. Now you enter in the service number for the company the guy
            has it regestered for, then hit the # key.  In the edmonton 
            area TELUS is 16391.
        11. Leave it at 05, and hit #
        12. It should say 0333, if your in edmonton.  Other wise just leave
            it alone, and hit #
        13. Press 1, #
        14. Press 1, #
        15. Press 1, and hold down the CLEAR button untill it says TEST
        16. Press MEM, #02

There now you have just changed the phone number, the ESN is the same.  If
you don't know what your ESN is, then read below.  Also you can only 
reprogram the phone number only three times, and then you need to get the
phone reset.  This isn't cloneing, but there are other options once you
get into test mode.

Here is a bit more info on the AT&T 3610 TEST MODE:
To get into test mode just do numbers 1-6.

Press MEM, #22 and you get the screen filled with 1's
Press MEM, #23 and you get a bunch of numbers in this fashion:
        1433-00
        1_ 1 4910
on your screen.
Press MEM, #24 and it tells you the ESN on your phone.
Press MEM, #26 and it displays:
        total  CA
        0020 1h59
on your screen.
Press MEM, #61 and it put a - infront of the 61.. you can only enter the 
numbers 0, and 1 without getting an error.  Then hit #.  

Thats it!  If you have an AT&T 3610 then this would be useful, if not then
its still good to have the info.

America Offline and Compuserve.... Working Together?

     In a recent move to improve their Modem:User ratio, AOL has made an
agreement with Compuserve which should theoretically help both companies.
And what's in this agreement?  Compuserve has agreed to allow AOL to use
their local access numbers in exchange for some of AOL's wonderful content.
     But behind all the smiles and handshakes, a more sinister plot is
unfolding.  AOL is planning to merge with one of the oldest online services
in the business, creating "a more diverse online content".  Really?
     With their recent blunder (charging an hourly rate for games), AOL has
angered many of it's oldest members.  And there is a rumor floating around
that they will soon start charging for chat rooms.  Does this mean that all
the Compuserve members that enjoy getting online with only 1 or 2 tries,
having their mail arive at it's destination in AT LEAST a day, and an online
community that is generally more intelligent and computer-literate will have
to endure AOL's tyranny?  Maybe, but I'm sure they won't just lie down and
let AOL's Führer, Steve Case, degrade and censor the online environment that
they're used to.
     Their hope is that the Supreme Court will rule that the merger violates
the anti-trust laws.  With their boasted 9,000,000 members, AOL  already has
a large percentage of the online population.  Add in Compuserve's members,
and an online monopoly will develop, discouraging competition (the bread and
butter of american business).
     If the merger is allowed, the only thing that will prevent the further
degradation of the internet will be Stevie's death (cross your fingers).

FAST FACT:  Steve Case originally had an account on Compuserve before
creating AOL.

A Call to AOL's Tech Support

     I called AOL's wonderful and helpful technical support 800 number the
other day because of the telemarketing calls I kept recieving, even after my
account was terminated.  I knew that they would be kind, helpful,
knowlegeable, and eager to assist me with my problem so I called my phone
company beforehand and asked them to monitor the call and fax me a
transcript.  (this is free, but nobody ever does it...) 
     After finally getting past the computer answering system I got a
friendly Tech.  It went like this...


AOL: Hello, thank you for calling America Online technical support.  My
     name is Jason.  May I have your first name?
Me:  ****
AOl: And your last name?
ME:  *******
AOL: OK, and what can I help you with?
ME:  Well, Jason, My account was terminated about 3 months ago, but I keep
     getting phone calls from you guys and I want it to stop.  What do I have
     to do?
AOL: Please hold while I transfer you to our billing department.  Your  
     transfer number is 061
ME:  Ok
     (3 minute pause while I listen to some kind of arabian rock)
AOL: Hello, America Online billing support, how can I help you?
ME:  Hi, my account has been cancelled and I want you people to stop calling
     me and trying to sell me computers.
AOL: Ok, can I have your screen name?
ME:  I don't have one anymore.  My screen name WAS Cynic7
AOL: Can you spell that?
ME:  C-Y-N-I-C-7
AOL: Please hold
     (.....)
AOL: Your screen name isn't listed in our database, can I have your phone
     number?
ME:  ***-****
AOL: Please hold
     (...........)
AOL: Your number has been taken off of our calling lists.
ME:  Ok, thank y....
AOL: But before you go, America Online would like to thank you for calling
     our Technical Support system and we would like to take a few minutes to 
     tell you about some of the new features that will soon be part of     
     version 4.0 of our software.
ME:  But I'm not a member anymo...
AOL: Along with the wonderful features that you already enjoy, AOL is proud 
     to welcome many new content providers including Busine...
ME:  HELLO!!  Have you been listening?  I said I'm not a member anymore.
AOL: Sir, we are required to tell you about the new version of our software.
ME:  I don't care what your script tells you to read to me, I don't want to 
     hear it.  This is the exact reason why I called in the first place.
AOL: Please calm down sir, we are doing everything we can to help you.
ME:  What!?  Put down the script and talk to me.
AOL: I am talking to you
ME:  No, you're reading to me.  Now tell me why I need to know about version 
     4.0 of you software when I'm not a member anymore.
AOL: (click)


Well, After my wonderful experience with them, I think I'm going to call much
more often (ordering pizzas and pulling pranks).  Oh yeah, and a few hours
later that same day, I got a call from AOL about their wonderful line of 
modems for sale...
                                      °

C|NET's Mailing lists

     I signed up for C|NET's "Download Dispatch" and several of their other
mailing lists because at the time, I thought they would be interesting.
After recieving several messages filled with the most boring drivel ever sent
through a phone cable, I decided that it wasn't worth the time to read. 
     Following their exact instructions for removing myself from their list,
I sent them my "remove" letter.  In response, I got an error message back
from their machine saying they couldn't find the newsletter that I mentioned.
     Now I don't give up easy, so I tried again several times; and got the
same response.  I wrote to the webmaster, and every other technical person on
the system but I never got a reply.
     It's been about a two weeks now and I'm stuck getting messages from
them every week because they won't let me out.

                               October 1997

IDIOTS!!!
     There are many things that annoy me, but nothing irks me as much as
people who try to talk about things they know nothing about.  Especially
AOLers...
     Yesterday I was talking to 'Jthaballer', one of my closest friends and
the ONLY person with whom I can talk about programming and feel like I'm on
the same level.  I don't know how, but we got off the subject and started
talking about email and my new address (Scorpion104@juno.com) when a complete
stranger who obviously was listening to us addresses me as "hey" and asks
"you have the internet?".  I tell him politely "I have ACCESS to the
internet, yes..." and he procedes to rattle off his AOL address as proud as
an 8-year-old would.
     Now everyone knows that I could care less about AOL and all the children
on the system so, of course, I made a comment like "why don't you get an ISP?
They're generally faster and a lot more reliable."  Thinking back, I wish I
had never made the comment...
     This guy, whoever he was, procedes to tell me that I am a complete
"dumbass" and that "AOL IS the internet".  As I stand silent, he continues to
make a fool of himself as he tells me "I'm a hacker on AOL.  I steal people's
passwords and mess up the chat rooms so if you ever see me, tell me who you
are so I don't fuck up your system."  Ummm... yeah...
     I'm sure the idiot doesn't even know how to use DOS so I humored him
until he left and "J" and I had a good laugh all day saying "I'll fuck up
your system biotch!!!".  Still, humor aside, I hate these posers on AOL who
think they're hackers because they can download and install a chatroom
scroller.
     I've also noticed that all my friends immediately assume that I'm
on AOL whenever I'm about to give out an address.  Several weeks ago, I had
a long conversation with a nice girl that I didn't know (and wanted to know
better) and I was going to give her my email address before we parted.  She
interrupts me and says "I don't like writing email because it's too
impersonal".  'That's cool' I think to myself...  'She sounds smart'...  "So
just meet me in a private room named 'foxygirl' around 8....."  Needlesss to
say, we're still strangers.
     AOL only survives through their subscribers' ignorance, so if AOL is all
they know, then they will remain loyal.  I think this is why people can be
online so long and still know nothing about how the internet works.  Sad...
                                    #

ABC NIGHTLY NEWS, October 5
     Tonight, ABC really displayed their ignorance during their news
broadcast.  Their story was about children being victims of people that they
meet in chat rooms on the INTERNET.  My head immediately snapped towards the 
TV screen and I saw the AOL 3.0 software displayed and throughout their
entire broadcast, they showed AOL chat rooms....  Topping off their story 
they said something like "The government is looking into how to make the
INTERNET safer for our children."
     HELLO!?  AOL is NOT the internet guys...  This kind of ignorance is 
exactly the reason why the INTERNET is getting such a bad wrap.  AOL is the
problem, not the internet... and until these idiots begin to realize that
there IS an online world outside of STEVIE'S domain, there will be more
attempts to censor those of us who have nothing to do with AOL.

³ Letter from Editor ³
À-------------------ÄÙ
I used to think IRC was the best.  Now IRC bores me.  You go on IRC, drop                                                        
into all your channels that you usually hang out in, and almost everyone
there is away.  And even if you do start a conversation it lasts only a
few minutes, and then it dies.  So don't expect to run into me on the
IRC too often, I have better things to do like.. anything but that.
                                                        -EleCtriK

                       IDIOT BANDITS WITHOUT A CAUSE!
                       ------------------------------
Durring the summer W.P. Wagner got in a hole bunch of new computers,
bandits with no life or brains decided they would break in and break
all the monitors on the computers.  Hey dickweed thats coming out of
the taxpayers pockets, and its maying BCOM richer!  If you were gonna
do something trash the school, and steal the computers.  Geez, a hole
lab of bran new computers and the fools decide to trash it, instead
of cashing in on it or bringing home a new system.  

A good friend of mine that has examined the situation trying to figure 
out how these bandits got in and out without being detected, or videotaped.
He noted that there are many video cameras and sencors all over the
school, and infront of the lab.  So he guesses these bandits came in
through a window.  

                               ANARCON CANCELLED
                               -----------------
ANARCON has been cancelled because of insufficient funding, it was
to be hosted by CATS, AAA, and maybe this group.  But since its not
gonna be up this year, and its too late anyhow(it would be freezing).
This sucks.

                       Hells Angels in Alberta a plus??
                       --------------------------------
Ever since the Hells Angels came into Alberta and took over the local
biker gang the GRIM REAPERS, and the drug market the drugs have been 
comming in better, and faster.  For all you addicts that would be a
plus, for the rest of us.. kewl!

                              NS BEING CLEANED UP?
                              --------------------
As it turns out the police are about to bust the NS up, acording to
CATSlash magazine the cops know who all the members in the group are,
and are about to bust them.  All the cops need is one more peice of
evidence.  

                            NS MOVING, HOOKERS MOVING
                            -------------------------
It turns out the cops are either scaring the NS out of EASTGLEN and
surrounding area, or the NS decided to move.  It is rumored that
the NS are leaving EASTGLEN and area, and moving on to VICTORIA
COMPOSITE HIGH.  And as the NS leaves, the hookers are being pushed
out of down town, and into BEVERLY!  You will still see some hookers
downtown, but you'll see more in the Highlands/beverly area.  This
information hasn't been confirmed, but it seems to be whats going on.

Cause CHM know where they are.  There is a method of dropping into shell
while you are logged as doing something else, but we'll abuse it for a
bit, run a few exploits, get root.. then tell you how to do it.  Stay
tuned to CHM.. which isn't so lame if you are mature enough to read it.

                                AREA CODE CHANGE
                                ----------------
TELUS plans on adding an AREA CODE to our good province of ALBERTA,
it is currently estimated that by the year 2000 Alberta will have
about 7.8 millon phone users.  Currently the 403 NPA can only support
8 millon numbers.  So comming into effect in 1999 TELUS is going to
add an area code, so everything NORTH of RED DEER will be 780 area code.
So by 1999 edmonton will no longer be in the 403, but 780.  Maybe the 
phone service will change as well, opening more bugs in RCMAC, MLAC,
PREMIS, and their DMS-100 switch.

                             WINTEL COMMUNICATIONS
                             ---------------------
Another long distance company is moving in to the market, WinTel 
communications who's slogan is "We're your 13cent connection"
offers longdistance across north america for only 13cents a minute
any day any time, excluding Alaska, Hawaii, and Mexico.  "No activation
Fees - save right away", no disconnection fees as well.. just give them
30 days notice.  But there is a minimum monthly payment of $9.95, so
if you don't call long distance your gonna have to wip out 10 bux.
Located in Vancouver B.C., it's parent company is London Telecom which
is situated in Ontario and has been in business for 9 years.  WinTel rents
Bell Canada's phone lines, and if you wish to call over sea's you use
your local telco's payment plans.  So if you call alot in Canada and the U.S.
WinTel is for you.. if not stick to Sprint or something.  For more info,
or if you just wanna fuck with them call WinTel at 1-888-266-1313 or in
vancouver 606-4944.

Ya well another issue finally done.  And late as usual.  This should have
been posted as a September issue instead of an August issue, cause its
only being released near the end of September.  Hey guess what, CHM is
now officialy a year old.. you can tell we obviously skipped a few issues
of the mag.  Oh, the new CHM logo on the NEW CHM page was done by [FRaUD],
and its so much better then the one I made! :)  

There won't be a September issue, cause its too late, so look for issue 10
to be labled October.  And if you want you can contribute to the magazine
just send mail to chm403@hotmail.com and have phun.

Now for a few insperational words for the newage anarchists out there:
If you don't have a cause to blow things up, remember Bill Gates is worth
at least $36 Billion last time I checked!  And I think he just moved into
a 16 million dollar house.
