        Hey all you hackers and phreakers, crackers and carders!  We have
desided to get together and make a magazine.  So instead of just keeping the
knowledge to ourselves, you will be getting it!
        One thing special about this Zine is that its for Canadians Mainly!
This magazine will also have alot of information on the 403 area code, why??
Cause we live here, and we wanted something close to home.  But we still want
all of the other Canadian area codes to pitch in, give us information, become
writers, connections, and test persons.  We still will exept U.S.A. anarchists
as well, but most of the stuff writen here will be about Canada.  But if you
have any news from the states that will affect Canadians, or is just useful
to know, send it in as well.
        N.E.R.D. is a magazine, but we courier some stuff that we think is
nessasary to get out there.  But this magazine needs you local hackers,
and phreakers to get together and educate fellow youngins, and others that
lack knowledge.  What N.E.R.D. wants mainly done is to get an army of
Anarchists in Canada, and in Alberta!  We want to have the phone company
on their toes because of us!  So lets build an army together.
        We will be covering many topics, on Hacking, phreaking, and terrorism
every month.  There will be at least one colum on explosives, hacking, and
possibly phreaking every month until we run out of information to give to
you, which I highly doubt.  Our magazine is small this month because we
didn't have enough time to get the rest of the stuff done by the end of the
month, and have it released to you by OCTOBER 1996.  Why, because this
magazine was setup in about a week, so our writing time was limited.  I had
to do most of the writing this issue, but next month there will be other
articals from the other writers.  So here are the great writers and thier
files:

        Or if you don't have an E-mail address you can mail your application
to NERD on this very fine board:

        NERD            Probable Fate (1) (403)447-4311
                                      (2) (403)451-1273

        This board is VERY busy, and you will be lucky to get on, so if you
have an email address it would be alot eaisier.

        We need writers, so anyone who is willing to write articals for us,
we would really appreciate it.  But remember it must be H/P/A related.

>>>INTRO<<<
^^^^^^^^^^^
        All right all you terrorists out there, a letter bomb thats a sure
bang (Litteraly).  I have looked around for a sure fire letter bomb... but
couldn't find one this side of the moon!  So I sat down with all of my filez
and set to work... and finally created a letter bomb that works ALL the time!
So here we go... the letter bomb!

        If you by eny chance use eny of this information, I will NOT be held
accountable for your stupidity, or eny of the actions you have taken.  This
means you now CAN NOT hold this file against me in court.
_________________
>>>INGREDIENTS<<<
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        -Iodine Crystals
        -Ammonia
        -Iron & Aluminum fillings
        -Envelope
        -Powdered Magnesium
_____________________
>>>TOUCH EXPLOSIVE<<<
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        All right this is the thingy you NEED to get done right, so make this
a couple times and try it out by wrapping it in newspaper and throughing it
at the ground.  This little mixture is what we will use as our fuse for our
letter bomb.  This is a sort of mild explosive, and can be dangerous if used
properly, and made properly.  This mixture when filtered can be deadly itself
in small amounts as well... so be careful not to dry it out before molding it
into the shape you need.

        (1) All right mix your IODINE CRYSTALS into ammonia until the iodine
        crystals will no longer dissolve into the ammonia.

        (2) Filter the ammonia through a filter made out of paper folded
        twice.

        (3)The resedue left in the filter is our touch explosive, you may
        chuck out the liquid, or filter it some more.

You can now dry it, but we need it moist when we make our bomb, so don't make
this till last.  When this is dry it will explode if there is any friction,
such as an envelope being teared open! ;)
___________________
>>>MILD THERMITE<<<
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        For the soft center in our chocolate we can use thermite, or black
powder... preferably thermite.  Don't use any of the other thermite recipes
that are out there, but this one instead.  Instead of rust in our thermite we
will be using iron fillings, because it works better for this type of work.
This mixture burns well in tight places... such as an envelope, and may even
explode causing the thermite to fly into victems face... causing severe
damage to victim, and by standers!

        - Mix 25%iron fillings with 75%aluminum fillings, have the thermite
        more or less powdered, NOT TOO POWDERED!
_____________________
>>>THE LETTER BOMB<<<
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        All right, take your envelope and take it apart so  the pattern is
laying flat on the table infront of you. Make your touch explosive now and
plaster it all over the inside of the envelope, and on the edges since this
is whatz going to hold the envelope together when you are done.  Take the
powdered magnesium that you have bought from a hardware store, or filed down
and spread it around the envelope as well... try NOT to get it on the edges
of the envelope... this is for better sealing of the envelope.  Now take the
thermite mixture and do the same with it, as you did with the magnesium.  Take
the envelope and seal it back together again, do this quickly because we don't
want our fuse to dry before we are done!  When the touch explosive dries the
envelope will be sealed.  When putting the envelope back together all the
access touch explosive that filters out through the edges when you are sealing
them THINLY together, put back into the envelope.  Now before you seal the top
of the envelope, add some more thermite to the letter... but not too much so
the letter isn't too thick.  Put a stamp on the package, and a fake company
return address on it.
___________________
>>>CLOSING NOTES<<<
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        This should work 99% of the time if you build it right.  You can use
black powder instead of the thermite and magnesium, add a bunch of pelets and
washers into the black powder(Gunpowder) and BANG.  Don't add too many pelets
when making this... if a letters too heavy it might be stoped.

>>>NOTES<<<
^^^^^^^^^^^
        This is for all you hackers out there, but mainly for the crackers
because you'll need to do some cracking here.  You will also need alot of
patience, cause this process takes some time.
_____________
>>>HACKING<<<
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Okay some background information on the subject... CompuServe started out as 
a little cheap crappy BBS, and as you already know has grown into this huge 
sleazy empire of shit it is now!  With giant message bases, on-line games, 
internet access, and a hole lot of other junk as well.  This system has
been plagued by hackers that have gotten into it, via someone elses 
account!  Well of course its usually REALLY hard to hack into a CompuServe 
user account, cause you don't know anything about the person your hacking, or 
the account number!  So we are gonna tell you all about it, even if you know 
nothing.  All you need is alot of spare time, and strategy.  First off you 
have to find a CompuServe number in your area, you could get if from a local 
list of bbs's in your area from your nearest computer store.  Now you log on, 
and you don't need to be a computer tech. to do it ether!  

Okay you've now called the number, your heart is beating, adrenalin is 
pumping, sweat beating down your face, and then your mom turns the football
game thats going on t.v. off and your back to your normal state!  Now pay 
attention to your computer, AND NOT THE DAMN T.V.!  Wait for the carrier 
connect.  Once you get connected press CTRL-C immediatly.  After this you 
have to press ENTER, and you should get a prompt simular to this:

Host name: 

Type CIS and then press enter, and you should get another prompt that looks 
like this:

User ID:

All the user ID's are two numbers seperated by a comma, an example would be
300000,40 but these are pretty hard to hack if you don't know enything about
the user, so try hacking a friends ID number first.  If you don't have eny 
friends on CompuServe then I recomend you try random numers and see if it 
gives you the password prompt.  If it give you the password prompt it means
you have run accross a user ID number!  You have now done half the work done,
now you must get the password for the ID number.  The password prompt should
look like this:

Passwrd:

CompuServe suggests you follow thier style of password protection, but it may
be different.  The pattern is WORD SYMBOL WORD, so an example could be:

Passwrd:FUCK#YOU(You won't acctually see it like this)

If you know the person of the account you are hacking, try his/her favorite 
sayings, stuff to do with his/her hobbie/s, favorite possesion, sex life,
job, etc as thier password.  

Once you get into the system, change the password immediatly to insure that
he won't change the password a few days after you hack his account.  You will
have the account all to yourself for about a month or so, cause the user will
have to send CompuServe $1.50 to get his password.  To change the password
just type GO PASSWORD at the prompt.  CompuServe is an okay BBS, if it weren't
run by a bunch of greedy basterds that want all your money!  

Some tips so you don't get caught onto:

1. Don't get involved in any of the on-line games.

2. Don't post any messages, unless you have to but even then don't post eny
   information about yourself. Don't even post what city or area code your 
   from cause they don't know unless you tell them.

3. Download anything you want, but I don't recomend uploading anything tho,
   they might sometimes be able to tell who you are by the files you upload.

4. Never Email yourself through them, or eny of your buddies eny information
   about yourself or anyone around you cause they screen the mail.

I don't know if this file has helped you in enything, but I do belive there
are some password crackers out there for CompuServe, I know there is a tool
for CompuServe out there called CompuDaze, but I think its for when you are
all ready loged in.  

They might have CompuServe hooked up to Telnet now so call the Telnet number
and press o when you get a bunch of charachters accross your screen.  Then
type in CIS it might get you there.  I haven't tryed yet so I don't know if 
it works.

Telnet Edmonton         9600bps         487-9394 

Next month it will be about ether DELPHI, or BIX.  So support the paper and 
send in your tips to:

Materials
---------
        -Package of plastic body Q-tips
        -Candle
        -box of momies pins

Procedure
---------
Okay, take the pack of Q-tips and cut of the end, and remember the longer the
dart is, the better it is!  Now take a pin, the one your mom uses for pinning
materials together, and shove it into the Q-tip's empty center head first.
Leave as much of the pin out as possible, all you need to do is have the pin
about 3 mm into the Q-tip for it to hold.

Now light your Candle, and pass the plastic that is around the head of the
pin through the flame about three times.  DO NOT KEEP IT IN THE FLAME, it 
will melt the plastic too much so the tip droops, and it will burn the plastic
making it look like the weirdest dart ever.  Pinch the partialy melted plastic
on both sides of the plastic, and make sure that the dart isn't bent, it can 
cause the dart to vear off course when you fire it.  The reason you have to 
pinch behind the pin head is so the pin dosn't slide further into the Q-tip 
after shooting it into a wall a couple times.  

For the blowgun you use a normal straw, so go steal some from McDonalds or
something.  

CLOSEING
-------
Don't shoot it at anyone, or animal cause it is very deadly.  Don't go showing
it around to people cause it is also illegal to make, or have.  Don't
give these out to enyone, or sell them to enyone, tell them how to make them
so they can't get you in trouble.  I gave one to somebody, and I got in BIG
trouble with the cops, so watch who you give the information out to as well.

                    EDMONTON HIGH SCHOOL COMPUTER UPDATE!
                    -------------------------------------
The computers at Eastglen are being screwed up by a the neighborhood
friendly MacHacker/Phreaker.  The crapy Network of Apple Macintosh Classics 
has been haveing their server crashing latly, and the computer teacher is 
going up the wall.  Eastglen hackers, hack away here cause they are 
jackasses, and wouldn't know what a computer is if it fell on thier heads.

The Computers at Queen Elezabeth are set up on the NOVELL 4.00 network system
and have afew pentiums, and some computers with win95.  This school has the
most protected computer system in all of edmonton!  Passwords here,
restrictions there.  They also have internet hooked up to some computers.
You can't access the run command in windows, or eny system files, but the
fools have Microsoft office, so use the customize icon at the top and add
it in, but take it out so the fucks don't get wind too fast.  The system
is setup alot like Ross Shepard's computer system, with f: as your file,
c: hard, and the rest are all the same.  Put something on X: its there on
Z:, Y:, K:,G: etc..

The Computers at Ross Shep. arn't as protected as Queen E.'s computers
but has its limits to users.  It is set up the same way Q.E's computers
are set up and has all the same programs as well.  For these computers you
and your friends might think class is too boring, well then go to z: drive
and into the directory of groups/cec/cec1 if it is still there.  In here
should be the network program session.exe but hidden and readonly.
EleCtriK FirE has put it in there, and on some of the computer's C: drive.
This is a messageing program for novell and can be run under windows.  I
suggest you try it out and copy it around to all the computers.  EleCtriK
FirE will have a file later on this subject.

The Computers at Vic. are 486's and have modem periods in the morning before
school starts, during lunch, and after school when you can call bbs's.  I
suggest you do all your hacking from the school system so you don't get
rolled, but check around.  The computer teachers here are said to acctually
contain knowledge of computers, so watch over your sholder when you are
screwing with the system.

Happy Hacking people, and we will have a Jr.High computer section next time
if we get enuff people to send us information.  Send in information about
your school system computers, and an update on the computers we have
posted here.

                      WITCH HUNTERS IN TOWN!  WATCH IT!
                      ---------------------------------
If you don't know who the witch hunters yet then you better.  Its like
the FBI, exept they are out only to catch HACKERS and PHREAKERS!  We
got a rumor saying they are the ones that have broken up the lasting
members of Leigons of Doom, and busted a bunch of other hackers and
phreakers.  Well it is rumored that they are now in Edmonton, and we
have wind that they are on most pir8 boards.  They pretend to be ELITE,
then when they get solid proof on you, they bust you.  But then again its
just a rumor.  The Magazine Canadian Anarchists Technology Society has been 
broken down to three people cause the rest got scared, but the number of 
people are climbing.  N.E.R.D. refuses to run and hide, and we will face 
the butfucks if they really do come to Alberta, and with the help of a 
few other groups we will take the fucks down, and maybe a block or two 
of power and phone services.
