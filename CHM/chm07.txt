This is a different type of cherry bomb, and is good for getting
peoples attention.  Well I'll tell you how to build a cherry bomb,
then tell you what to add to make quite an odd side affect.

First, get a ping pong ball and cut a hole in it, about 2 match heads
wide.  Make sure the hole is a hole, and not a slit; its a hell of a 
problem to get the thing to lite with a small hole.

Second, you fill it with Gunpowder(not clumps, powdered), and
try to have it packed with no spaces in the inside(for louder
affect).

Third, make a fuse; or buy one.  And stick it far into the bomb having
it stick out a bit.  This in itself dosn't always ignite the gunpowder 
well, so what I do is stick a match in just in case(leave some of the
match head sticking out.  You may also want to put some potassium nitrate
in the hole after the fuse is in(a little!).

Fourth, cover the plastic ping pong ball with nail polish, to seal any
small air holes there might be.

Now you lite it and run.

Ú--------------Ä¿
³ Modifications ³
À--------------ÄÙ
If you would like a moderate bang, with alot of smoke(really thick
grey smoke!), make the cherry bomb half gunpowder, and half rocket
powder.  You know model rockets, take to rocket engine and powder
the black stuff.  The rocket powder is what makes the smoke.

For more of a bang and less smoke you would have the gunpowder to
rocket powder 3:1.

For more smoke and less bang it would be 1:3, and so on.  But I 
wouldn't waste my time making a cherry out of only rocket powder, 
I don't know the results but my calculations say it would really 
suck, and might not even blow up.  But try to have at least one
rocket engine in the bomb.

If you want to hurt a bunch of people in a crowd I would put from
3 to 8 shot gun pellets(when unloading shotgun shells never through
out anything, everything is usable) at different places so when it
blows up it flys.  If you make this make sure you remember which ones
have the pellets; I forgot that I put pellets in a few of mine, and
when I went to detonate one for fun, I got hit with one of the pellets.
It dosn't really do anything big, just hurt like hell(from a far distance),
it also depends on how much gunpowder there is in the bomb.

Ú--------------Ä¿
³ Softball bomb ³
À--------------ÄÙ
Well here is just a thought, but you know those big soft balls?  You can
usualy find them durring softball season, I have like 5 of em that I 
collected one year.  This has not been tested but is a theory.

Pipe bombs are big explosives that cause alot of damage, well its not 
like your gonna bother going into a store, and buy a foot long pipe with
two end caps, thats just a little to suspisious.  Well you could do it,
just why look so suspisious when you can make a powerful fairly large
explosive at home out of a softball.  I don't know why they are called
soft balls, they are quite hard to me.  Well take a large nail, ice pick,
or anything that will punch a hole in the ball.  When this is done fill
it up with gunpowder and shrapnel.  Stick a fuse in it and there you have
a bomb alot more powderful then a cherry bomb, and something that comes 
pretty close to a pipe bomb.  Note that explosions can't be seen without
smoke, so if you want to see it, have rocket engine gun powder in it, at
least one engines worth(it needs not be powderd, it can be in chunks).

Remember that these things may be small, and fun; but they can blow 
away body parts very easily.

Winblows 95 is so easy to fuck up, a child can do it.  Thats another
one for the "explorer type", and a big fat ZERO in MicroSoft's face.
In making Win95 user friendly, and easy to use, its also easy to
fuck up(like I mentioned above).  This information would be more or
less be for a network of Win95 computers.  It is to my knowledge that
every high school in Edmonton will be equiped with at least one IBM lab 
of pentium computers.  Every High School library in edmonton will be
equiped with pentiums running Win95.  Isn't this a hard blow to the
crappy Apple Mac company.

Anyhow a main flaw in windows is that they made it user friendly! 
Bill Gates has totaly replaced the Mac with an IBM lookalike.  And 
if your school system has Encarta 95, 96, or 97 you can access 
restricted files easier, and with less difficulty.  It also hides 
the program when you have it minimized, usualy the programs running 
would be displayed at the bottom of the screen.  Encarta covers up the 
toolbar that displays the information.

What you would have to do is run encarta first, and goto the 
encyclopidia.  As you can tell it hasn't hidden the bottom 
toolbar yet, so once you have clicked on the encyclopida and
the previously lookedup topic is displayed, you must then
press the find button at the top of the screen.  This will
overlap the bottom toolbar, to hide any programs that you wish
to run.

Now you will have to select wich program you want to run, so
go to the toolbar at the top of the screen and select the icon at
the end of the bar.  Its a white i in side a blue circle.  After
selecting it a pulldown menu will appear, goto options on the pull
down menu.  A black like window should pull up with a bunch of 
options you can setup with encarta, click on the choose word 
processor option that is sitting separatly at the bottom of the
screen.  This should pull up a window that alows you to scan through
the computer(and network).  From here you can select any program
that you wish to run.

After selecting your program and quiting back to the encyclopidia,
you then goto the toolbar, and select the options pulldown menu.
From the options pulldown menu select Word Processor.  This will
run your program, that you have told encarta was your word 
processor.

This is ideal if you have no acess through your library computer to
do what you wish, and since you can't run windows applications through
dos.  A few ideas for what to put as the word processor would be either
one of these:

Command.com     Dos prompt.
telnet.exe      Telnet, ideal if your school has an ISDN internet 
                connection.  Should be in the windows directory.
                It may take some time to find if you don't know
                your school's system.
Misc Novell utilities.
Games you have downloaded off the net.

Hit ALT and TAB to switch between programs, to avoid being caught by
the evil librarian, or computer teacher.  Explore the possibilities
with this freedom.  

Ú--------------------Ä¿
³ Additional Win Tips ³
À--------------------ÄÙ
If your school has its group windows password protected, there is a
way to dissable it.  All you need to do is Edit the win.ini file.
Your win.ini file should have a command similar to this one:

        Load= nwpopup.exe;şsecgroup

If the load line in your win.ini file only has only one program in
it that will load when you run windows, your gonna have to take out
that file.  Secgroup is a password program for windows, and it is
configurable, I'll explain how to reset it next month.  But you want
it gone, so you would take out the command and only leave:

        Load= nwpopup.exe

The load line should be near the top of your win.ini file, with just
a few lines down.


Thats all this time around, next month we will talk about screwing with
windows 95, which is a hell of a lot easier to hack then win 3.X and dos.

                             The Potato Gun!
                            
Every wanted to make a cool firearm like weapon but didn't have the 
supplies because there these fucken strange ass things that are almost 
impossible to find?  If your one of them people this is the article for you.  
The potato gun is made up of house hold items, and easy to find things. 
 
Materials: 
- One Plastic Jar, anything of the size of a water bottle will do. must have 
unscrewable lid. 
- Plastic Tube (them golf bag tubes work the best) 
- One barbecue electric sparker thingy. 
- Duct Tape 
- Gasoline, or spraypaint 
- A Potato 
Ok, after you have all that shit, now its time to make the thing. 
 
First ya gotta cut a hole in the top of the container big enough for the 
plastic tube to fit through.  After the hole is cut, place the tube in so its 
sticking about 2 cm in the container.  Tape the tube to the container so its 
air tight.  Do the same with the barbecue lighter with the screw in side.  
Now your finished, unscrew the lid, put in the gas, load the potato through 
the tube, screw the top back on, and fire away!!  
 
Have Phun!!

³ Letter from Editor ³
À-------------------ÄÙ
Whats up with the Canadian phone systems?  Its a pain in the ass to
phreak from nowadays.  Many 800 diverters, and interesting numbers
are not available from Canada, although Canada's phone systems are
extremly up to date.  The U.S. have modern systems as well, but they
have a larger economy, which in turn draws many businesses to the 
U.S. giveing phreaks in the states more "Big Businesses" to phreak
from.  
I'm not saying we can't phreak from Canada, but we have many 
restrictions.  The Canadian phone companies, and the U.S. companies
should setup no boundries for North Ameriaca.  Cause its a pain in
the ass to have to reroute through multiple systems just to make a
simple call to an 800 pager!

                               ÚÄ Stabbing Ä¿
                               À-----------ÄÙ
Mobster gunned down!On June the 5th, a fued turned to violence at J.D. Brako School, in
Edmonton, Alberta.  Aparently there was an argument and a big crowed
gathered, and the boy took off.  Two other boys ran from the group in
persuite, and then the fleeing boy pulled a knife and stabbed one of
the boys.  The 16 year old was admited to hospital.

                         ÚÄ The Lunch Box Bandit Ä¿
                         À-----------------------ÄÙ
Modern day bank robberies are rarely commited, and when they are
done the robbers are caught efficiently.  But one such bank robber
nick named the Lunch Box bandit has gotten away with 10 bank robberies
to date.  

His unusual name was brought about because of his first robbery, when
he robbed the bank claiming that there was a bomb in the lunch box he
carried with him.  The police have no leads to who this might be, 
because he wears clever disguses and blends in well with crowds.

This bandit now has stopped using the box, but shows the clerks the
butt of a handgun.  Cops expect more banks to be hit by this robber,
and no he dosn't stick to one type of bank.  If the lunch box bandit
is out there, I would love to interview him or have a friendly chat.

                            ÚÄ Bandit Caught? Ä¿
                            À-----------------ÄÙ
Was the lunch box bandit caught?  The police think so.  The police
lay low waiting for the bandits next hit, and when he hit they 
responded within the minute.  Remember those pagers I told you
about that downtown was planning on setting up, well that was 
deffinatly used.
Philip Glen Knole was arrested outside the Chateau Lacome on
when he tryed to escape in there on Friday July 4th.  The police 
found a loaded full-auto handgun on his person, but no cash?  
The lunch box bandit has hit 11 banks to date, the 11th was
National Trust on 100st, also his bust.

In June Jonny Papila was gunned down, he was big with the Italian 
Mob.  The Roman Church didn't alow a full mass for him because of 
his criminal connections.  This was all in Ontario.
                                      
                           ÚÄ Grim Reaper Bust Ä¿
                           À-------------------ÄÙ
On June the 24th police from calgary, edmonton, and red deer stormed the
Grim Reapers abode.  40 members were captured, and are being charged with
trafficing of flesh(prostitution), and the odd batery.  Oh and not to 
mention the firearm charges.  

Alberta thinks that this is sending out a clear message that the Hells Angels
aren't welcome in alberta.  The Hells Angels are thinking of setting up a
chapple in Alberta.

There is a rumor that the Hells Angels were going to setup some type of
merge with the Grim Reapers, and the police think that this is going to
change the Hells Angels decision.  Hells Angels already own 90% of the
prostitution in B.C. and Alberta, pretty soon it will probably be 100%.

                    À--------------------------------ÄÙ
A member of the NS threatened a student at Eastglen known as Aeon
Flux to us in the anarchy scene.  There is no word so far if this
fool has acctually acted on his threat, and he probably won't.  
Just another "tuff" kid trying to act cool.

                            À-----------------ÄÙ
The Anarchist group from northern Alberta named the Vigilante Corp,
has recently elected a new leader for the group.  The Vigilante Corp
will be comeing out with some new text files, so look for up files
by this great group.  Finnaly Alberta is being repopulated by elite
anarchists, phreaks, and hacks.

                         ÚÄ Hackers Accessories! Ä¿
                         À-----------------------ÄÙ
I printed this when I was in Jr high, and just begining my h/p addiction,
and I just found this print out while going through a shitload of trash 
under my bed(I also found 5 bux, a pack of caps, and a hole shitload of 
trash.).  Well anyhow here it is:

HACKERS ACCESSORIES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to a common mode of dress, there is a similar set of tool of 
the trade which many hackers can be found carrying. Often a black satchel
(though many responses claimed green, no doubt in keeping with the hiking
boots and chamois shirts) or military surplus shoulder bag is filled to
overflowing with things which hackers must have to sustain their hacking
lives when separated from their computers. A typical inventory might look
like this:

        Notepad (legal or steno size)
        Multiple pens and pencils
        Various screwdrivers, hex keys, and torx drivers(for installing
          cards, and opening cases)
        The flashiest programmable calculator that a person could find. 
          These tend towards the HP (RPN) units, but there is a substantive
          minority using Casio algebraic units.  These should graph if at
          all possible.
        Floppy disks. A variety of floppies containing diagnostic tools, a
          current project being moved to a new machine, or the most recently
          aquired programs to be toyed with.
        {Cruft}, and lots of it. ATM receipts, old tests, source code print
          outs, unpaid bills, scraps of note paper with program ideas, {IP}
          numbers, and phone numbers on them, etc...
        A good pocket knife. Swiss Army-type knives with several tools are
          prevalent.
        Musical instrument. Harmonicas dominate this catagorie, though 
          DoN Nichols (dnichols@ceilidh.beartrack.com) apparently sports a
          penny whistle in his toolbelt.
        Multitester and/or logic probe.

More financialy equiped hackers can also be found with portable computers,
Apple Newtons or other {PDA} devices, and expensive versions of the 
multitester (Fluke, is an example of this). A properly equiped hacker can
continue to be immersed in a hack while sitting through an unusually broing
lecture, or while on the bus.

The C.H.M. in no way inforce or recomend violence, or vandilism, 
but I do persue a hacking and phreaking community.  I am saddened  
when people kill, and vandalize property.  Of course a telephone 
booth(booth not the acctual payphone) dosen't count in this case 
because its the property of blood thirsty, money crazed business 
men, that could offer the service for pennies!  All the explosives 
and home made wepons here you can make, and play with, but never 
play with human life.
