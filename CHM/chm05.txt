From Edmonton, Alberta.. bringing you the best mag in the 4o3!
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The magazine has been behind since january, and we barely got
that issue out.  It was released on Febuary the 15th, five days
before the febuary issue was to come out.  So we decided to skip
the febuary issue and concentrate on sending out the magazine
on march 20th instead.  So you would expect us to be caught up,
well we arn't!  Sorry to say, but this months issue came out
late again, so our appologies go out to the people that are pissed
cause I said it would be out by the 20th.

We are slowly getting into the latest technology and programs,
so if you see next months issue as an exe, don't freak out(unless
you've got a mac).  

The graphics in the magazine are sickening me so expect even more 
changes to the magazines format and graphics.  Eventually I'll find 
something that'll make me happy.

As for the webpage, I've got it up and fully running.  The graphics
aren't much to look at for now, but in a month or two I'll have the
page looking alot better.  If you don't know the webpage address its
http://www.anarchy-online.com/electrik/index.htm and yes the page gets
the mag before any bbs gets it, and well Bethlehem dosn't verify files
to quickly so get it off the web page if you can.  I suggest you check 
out the page as soon as possible, and add it in your web links if you 
run a hpa page.

Logical Explaination
 -------------------- -- -

         Now I'll answer the question that most of you have on the tip of your
 tounge : "What's a Plaid Box?!?!". The answer : A SIMPLE device that you can
 use to record your phone conversations. Notice the word simple is in caps,
 that means, just about ANYBODY with a brain ( and the equipment ) can make
 one. This file is NOT for people that already have a high-tech phone tapping
 system. It's for the rest of us who are cheap and aren't good at soldering or
 building things. I'm sure you might have heard people talking about devices
 that can record phone conversations ( mostly used for pranks ) or have seen
 ads for these.  That equipment is too expensive. You COULD record stuff with
 a beige box, but this method causes WAY too much background noise. OR, you
 COULD *waste* your time building something else ( and have to solder and 
 WORK! ). Or you could be lame, lazy and cheap and build a Plaid Box. Just so
 you know, the Plaid Box is not a physical cube :-) .

 How To Build It!
 ---------------- -- -

 What you need - A phone ( duh! )
                 Walkman earphones ( the small ones that fit IN your ears and
                 DON'T have that metal head band )
                 A Screwdriver
                 Pliars
                 Tape recorder

 You might need - A Police Car
                  A gun


 1      Take the pliars and squeze the outer plastic shell of the earphones
 and be careful not to break the insides. Sqeaze until you break the shell,
 then work your way around and take off the shell completly ( do this on both
 sides of the earphones ). AND DON'T CUT THE WIRES!

 2      Now you should have you should have two tiney little speakers. Take
 the cover off of the handheld part of the phone. You should have access to
 the phone's speaker now ( which emmits the sound , not the mike ). Take the
 two earphone speakers, face down ( wires up ) and lay them ON TOP of the
 phone's speaker. With the earphones' wires hanging off the side, replace the
 cover. It'll be a tight fit, but it shouldn't hurt anything.

 3      Plug the earphone's plug into the mike terminal on a tape recorder or
 stereo, and you're set!

 How To Use It ( I'll keep t short & simple )
 -------------------------------------------- -- -

 When you're ready to record whatever is on the phone, hit the RECORD button
 on the tape deck. If this doesn't work, you might not have a tape...

 Bright Ideas (or maybe not?)
 ---------------------------- -- -

 Here are some ideas for what you can do with your plaid box.

 Prank Calling -

 - Record your best pranks and give the tapes to your friends! (trusted ones)
 - Send a copy of the tape to the prank's victim.

 Blackmail -

 - Get someone to talk about cheating on their mate.
 - Record someone 'talking' behind his/her friend's back.
 - Get someone to make death threats.
 - Have someone talk bad about their boss.

 Legal Notice
 ------------ -- -

 I'm not responisble for what you do with the information in this file:
 if you screw up and break your earphones, it's YOUR fault, not mine.

How to Read Password Protected Lpage Guestbook Entries
                        by Storm of Death

Don't you hate it when you look at a guestbook and see that most of the 
entries are private? If the guestbook is on LPage, the largest free 
guestbook provider, there is a way around having to know the password! 
When you get a guestbook from them they ask you to put a link on your site 
to:
 
http://www.Lpage.com/wgb/utilities.dmb>http://www.Lpage.com/wgb/utilities.dmb

enter the guestbook name and it'll take you to a maintance page. Click on 
view guestbook oldest entries first and it'll show all the messages, private 
or not.

How to Get IP Numbers to The Computer You or Someone Else Is On Thou Lpage
                        by Storm of Death

This isn't really a secret as it says it will on the guestbook page, but it's 
useful to know. Go to:

http://www.Lpage.com/wgb/utilities.dmb>http://www.Lpage.com/wgb/utilities.dmb

then enter the guestbook name, tag on delete guestbook entries. You can't 
delete the entries without a password, but you can get the signers system 
stats. It'll tell you the IP Address, what Operating System, and what browser 
signed it.

How to Lock WindoZe 95 Up Via the Web
                        by Storm of Death

Put a link up to:

file://aux

It locks the machine up. Don't ask me what Aux is, because I don't know 
(I use an Amiga, I like crashing PC's [|B-)> ). It works!

Find Out What Information Can Be Obtained About Your 
Computer from the Internet
                        by Storm of Death

In your browser, go to:

and it will tell you about the computer your on. May not work on all 
machines, most of the PC's I've tried it on it worked though...

                      ************************************

If your school or work office network is running off of Novell Network you
may have a little escape from your boredom.  Now a days you tend to fall 
asleep in computer class, so instead of sleeping or typing up a "full block
letter" you can message to your buddie in the next room. 

One method of messaging is through novell's session program.  This is a dos 
based program, and everytime you send a message it beeps.  At some schools
you can't access file manager or the dos prompt through windows.  Some
schools like Queen E. have a novell programed menu that has a bunch of 
options like run windows, or run all the right type.  Well you must quit
this menu, and you do this by hitting the escape button(Esc).  At the
dos prompt you type "win session.exe"(without the quotation marks!).  This
will run windows and session at the same time, alowing you to switch back
and forth through programs, keeping you quietly hidden from the supervisor.

To send a message through session you must go down to the userlist option,
and from there select a user currently online.  If the user you are sending
the message to is in dos his/her computer will beep, and they will have to
press ctrl-enter to clear the message from either top or bottom of screen, 
and to continue working.  If they are in windows a little window will apear,
and most of the time when typing these shalow people look at there fingers
instead of the screen; so your message goes away once enter is pressed.

Another more efficient way of messageing is to use a windows based messageing
system.  Is there one?  Yes, but it requires some thinking to get to.
  1. I sugest you open notepad, but you can do this with word as well. 
  2. Select File at top of screen, then select the Open option.
  3. A window will pop up asking you what file to open.  We want the
  network command, located under the cancel button.
  4. Once the Network command has been selected another window will pop up,
  and you will have to select the button that has a sheet of paper on it;
  located under the menu bar along side a bunch of other commands.
  5. Select the server you are logged on, and there should be about 2
  servers there.  Select the server that has alot of users logged on, wich
  is shown in the little box next to the server options box under the graphic
  buttons.
  6. Go through the list and locate your friend, and click a box located
  just above the server select box, and its just below the graphic buttons.
  Here is where you type the message.  
  7. After message is typed you can either hit enter at the end of the line,
  or click on the send button located in the bottom right hand corner of
  the window.

This helps kill time, and its fun to talk to someone in a computer room on 
the other side of the school.  Just don't send a message to the supervisor!
A supervisor at Ross Shep was messaged and they found out about session and
they deleted the program.  You can still use the windows method when your
messageing.  Supervisors and teachers don't like you "fooling around" with
the network so I don't suggest you start showing off to your teacher.  Keep
it quiet as well, don't swear at a total stranger cause it tells them who
the message is from.

Enjoy, the fraud part 2 artical will be in next month.  Look for upcoming
tips on novell and other networks.

  Beige Boxing
ß--------------ß
Beige Boxing is one of the more primitive ways of phreaking, and maybe one
of the easiest.  Altho many phreaks start off beige boxing, they quickly
change to cellular fraud, and calling through pbx's; this is because it is
much simpler, you can call from where ever you are, and you don't need to
stand out in the rain, wind, snow, hiding behind a beige box on a main 
intersection.  But if you are a new phreak that isn't too patient(and
most of the newbies aren't patient), this method is for you.

  The Box Itself
ß----------------ß
First off if you haven't built your box yet your going to need a few parts,
and if you have a line mans handset or beige box skip this section.

  Modular Phone Jack            -The smaller box type jacks are best, and
                                can be purchased at any dollar store for $1.

  2 feet of Telus Wireing       -This can be picked up at a site the line
                                men have been working, they waste alot of
                                useful supplies.  Any good wire would do,
                                but we prefer this wire to any other since
                                its strong, and its not too stiff.

  1 Coda phone                  -These are good one peice phones, that don't
                                filter out bluebox tones, but in alberta and
                                many other places the company has gone digital
                                and tones no longer work, including the 2600.

        1. Take your Modular Jack and open it up.
        2. One end has the jack where the phone is plugged in, the other has
           a space where the wireing leaves the box.  Look at the modular 
           jack, you should see 6 screws whith different color wires going 
           to each.  What we need are the two screws on the end that are 
           red(ring) and green(tip).
        3. Unscrew the screws holding the red and green wires down, not all
           the way out fool!
        4. Take your 2 feet of Telus Wireing (AT&T, what ever), and cut it
           in half.  Strip about an inch off each end.
        5. Wrap one end of one wire to the red(if you have red and green you
           can hook them up red=red, green=green.  It dosn't matter); and 
           wrap one end of the other wire under the screw the green wire is
           going to.
        6. Now screw the screws back down holding the wireing in place.  At
           this point you can soder it all together, but I don't recomend
           doing this.
        7. Take the two wires and lay them out accross the space at the end,
           and seal the box up again with the two wires sticking out the end.
        8. At this point you can wrap your box up in black electrik tape, 
           this makes it look real nice.  The CHM dose this for all of its
           beige boxes, the model you are now building is the CHM model 5502.
        9. On the two wires hanging out you hook up your aligator clips.  You
           can either soder them on, or use the little screw to hold the wire
           in place.
        10.Now wrap the aligator clips with electric tape(the parts you'll be
           holding, not the hole clip).
        11.Get some neon paint and paint "CHM model 5502" as best you can on
           the beige box.
        12.Plug your phone into the jack.

  Using the box
ß---------------ß
You can go out and cut/file/blow-torch through a lock on one of the phone
boxes in your area, or where ever you are.  I would prefer to use a blow-
torch then fileing or cutting through the locks.  Blow-torches are fast
and easy, while fileing and cutting is hard and painfully slow.  It also
depends on the type of phone box your going to beige box.  There are those
big metalic green boxes that are about 4 feet tall and 4 feet wide, that
hold over 100 lines.  And then there are those small green boxes about 
2-3 feet high and 1 foot wide, that hold only a few lines that open with
a hex driver, but some have locks.

        1. Open Box
        2. Try finding a pair, you either will plug into them, or strip
           the wires and connect like that.  Should only take about 5 min
           to find a pair, 10 min at the most.
        3. If you are using a touch tone and it keeps doing pulse, switch 
           your wires and it should now be touch tone.
        4. Setup conferences, test loops, or if you have a laptop you can
           call those bbs's in places you couldn't call before cause calling
           to france would have been to expensive.

  Optional Method
ß-----------------ß
You can also beige box without haveing to open those big boxes.  You can
also hook up to the side of your victems house.  Under the gage meter there
should be two poles.  One should be going up into the gage, the other one
goes into the house, but has a panel that can be unscrewed.  Unscrew the
pannel, there should be various wires in the pole.  Leave the RED wire
alone, this is the power, meaning electricity, meaning instant death.  
Strip the BLACK wire with a pair of insulated wire strippers.  Now you
can go and phreak the hell out of your enemies line, or just a random
victem with a less chance of being caught.

  Closing
ß---------ß
Beige boxing is very simple, and many people already know about this simple
method of phreaking.  Just use your brains when doing this, you wouldn't
want to beige a t1 line, it'll melt your box and shoot over 3000 volts 
through you.  Untill next time.

This section is constantly changing, so if you have any ideas on

what you wouldn't mind seeing in the magazine you can send it in.
As well if you wish to get into any activities the CHM organizes,
and/or informs you of; you'll either have to be apart of the group,
or known on the underground.  So all of you that what to get into
the phreakers conference, stop bugging me!  You won't get in unless
you're a real phreak, or are on the underground scene.

                         Hookers hookers everywhere
                       ß----------------------------ß
"GET THE HELL OUT"; thats the attitude the people in a north end community
in Edmonton feel about the jon and hooker problem they have.  "Do you know 
how it feels when my children bring home used condoms and needles?" crys a 
poor mommy.  This is down on 118th ave, and around the 93st area.  Want a 
hooker or jon pick someone up there.  And remember to leave your condoms 
and and needles for the childrens collections.  You can't get rid of 
hookers just like you can't get rid of war, pollution, and the stench 
in a prison.  Why don't the community folk just move out, they can't 
kick out the hookers unless they kill every one of them.

I was chatting with da drug just recently and he told me to post some 
information in the magazine.  The first was, Brown nation never existed, 
it was made up by the media.  The second is that there is a new hacker gang 
started up called the cyberMAFIA.  The 4o3 is supposed to be their turf, 
this information is not certain.

                                 North Side
                               ß------------ß
NorthSide has been coming out full strong into the crime scene.  NS has
been around a while, and just recently decided to make some face.  Most
of NS is made up of natives with a bad attitude.  Just this past month
in Febuary two 15year old NS members were arrested for beating a man
almost to death outside the Abbotsfield mall.  The man needed 54 stiches
and is still recuperating.  NS graphitti may be found allover the city,
and on edmonton transit buses.
   
                  Hells Angels and Rock Machine Gang War
                ß----------------------------------------ß
The Hells Angels gang and the Rock Machine gang haven't been hitting it
off to well on the east side of Canada.  Just recently, on March the 14th 
to be exact, an explosion rocked a bar were the Rock Machine gang hung out.  
There has been multiple conflicts between the gangs, and the police told 
the media just a day before the bomb went off that they were putting more 
people on the gang problem in the area.  The police are using an 
intimidation tactic, following around the gangs members.  The members 
don't find their new shadow welcoming, and some have been arested for 
threatening the police officers.  More on this dispute as it comes.

                          Game Crack of the Month
                        ß-------------------------ß
I've decided to put in at least one game crack or hack in here per month,
if possible.  If you have a game patch, game registration numbers, cheats,
or walkthroughs send them in. 
Well this month the game is Microsoft Monstertruck Madness, for windows
95.  It requires at least 100 meg harddrive space, and 24 megs of ram to
run the program.  
  
  1. Borrow the cd off a friend and install the program on medium, this 
  has all the game components it needs to run without the cd.  Full install 
  is 200 megs, so thats 100 megs worth of video clips which you don't really 
  need.
  2. When it asks for a 10 digit registration number, fill the ten spaces up 
  with 2's.  
  3. Now click on the medium install button(medium sized truck) to install
  the game.
  4. Run the fucker and play like mad!

The game dosn't require the cd to run itself, all that you miss out is a 
bunch of video at the begining and inbetween; nothing too great.
Its almost like all the other simulators out there exept its got better
graphics, all it needs is to be able to do pop a wheelies.  You still 
have your general commands: V to change to many different views; P to 
pause; arrow keys to move.  
The game says it needs 24 megs of ram to run, so what you do is goto your
control panel folder, select system, then make it so virtual memmory's 
minimum was 10 megs, and maximum was 20 megs(for a 16 meg ram system).  
This runs the game without problems(it will still say the 24 meg ram shit),

                             Telus "pipe" piper
                           ß--------------------ß
You've heard of vandalizing Telus phone booths with spray paint, sludge
hammers, lighter + gas = singed payphone?  Now someone has taken phone
vandalizim to a new high.  Two phone booth bombings have occured,
the latest one on Febuary 20th, 1997.  The police think the crimes are
being commited by one person, tieing in 3 bombings in total.  The first
was in a garbage bin, which was probably a test site for this person or
persons.  The second was in a phone booth somewhere on the west side,
and the third one was in a phone booth right across from RossShep High
school.
It costs Telus $3000 to replace these booths, so the pipe bombs are doing
alot of damage.  My advice would be to use something that has equal or
more power, that will turn the booth into a nice fire ball after it
blows the shit sac up.  This might require combineing a few explosives,
or making a napalm kiss.
However the teen that planted these bombs has been caught, and the
media says the internet is to blame.  The net has nothing to do with 
this, if its not in your heart to blow something up, you won't do
it.

                     Loops, PBX's, Diverters and Dialups!
                   ß--------------------------------------ß
We are currently trying to map the phone systems of north america,
or at least our country.  So if you have stumbled apon any loops,
pbx's, diverters, or any dialups in the 403, or even in France, send
them into us.  The list won't be posted in the magazine, but will be
compiled into a newsletter and given to the people that supplied us
with any information conserning this subject, and of course the
phreakers of the CHM.  The list will not be given to just anyone, so
don't bother asking for the list, we don't need any of the numbers to
be abused.  So to get in on this you need to send in at least one loop,
pbx, diverter, or dialup that we don't have and could use.


                     The Phone Phreak's Ten Commandments!
                   ß--------------------------------------ß
I took this little segment of text from a magazine called The Phreaker's
handbook(TPH) Issue #1, Volume 1, written by Doctor Dissector.  Enjoy:

     I.  Box  thou  not over thine home telephone wires, for those who doest
will surely bring the wrath of the Chief Special Agent down upon thy head.
     II.  Speakest  thou  not of important matters over thine home telephone
wires, for to do so is to risk thine right of freedom.
     III.  Use  not  thine own name when speaking to other phreaks, for that
every third phreak is an FBI agent is well known.
     IV.  Let  not overly many people know that thy be a phreak, as to do so
is to use thine own self as a sacrificial lamb.
     V.  If thou be in school, strive to get thine self good grades, for the
authorities well know that scholars never break the law.
     VI.  If  thou  workest, try to be an employee and impressest thine boss
with  thine enthusiasm, for important employees are often saved by their own
bosses.
     VII.  Storest thou not thine stolen goodes in thine own home, for those
who  do are surely non-believers in the Bell System Security Forces, and are
not long for this world.
     VIII.  Attractest  thou  not  the  attention of the authorities, as the
less noticeable thou art, the better.
     IX.  Makest  sure  thine  friends  are instant amnesiacs and willst not
remember  thou  hast  called  illegally,  for  their  cooperation  with  the
authorities willst surely lessen thine time for freedom on this earth.
     X.  Supportest thou TAP, as it is thine newsletter, and without it, thy
work would be far more limited.
    
                     Cell fone Setup, and how its done
                   ß-----------------------------------ß
This is for all of you people that don't mind paying for a cell, but would
still go out and beige box to call long distance; or this would be for
someone that would like to find out some info on setting up a cell
and how its done(like me).
First you can buy a cell, or rent one from the phone company.  Cells usually
cost between $49-$1700, and the cells can be activated on the spot if it was
bought from an authorized telus dealer.  
Payment plans range from $29 to $200, depending on wether you are renting
a cell or are using a bought cell.  
The Telus people won't give anyone a cell, because once you get it 
activated there is no minimum spending.  So Telus dose a credit check
on you, to make sure you'll pay the bills.  If they don't find anything on
you they will ask for a job, call your employer
