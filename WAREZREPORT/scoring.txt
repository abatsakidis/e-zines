THE WARE REPORT - November '96 Scoring Summary (SCORING.TXT)

  * I have included a scoring section separate from the ware report.  This
    section of the report mainly points out individual successes, and lets
    you see who does what in the major groups.  All MVP and scoring awards
    will be given in this section only.

Comments:

    Prestige's team continued its incredibly productive output with another
  fabulous month as the group surged to victory.  Prozac, who was valuable in
  October for the group, proved himself even moreso in November, as he out-
  stripped all other suppliers with 11 originals for the month (and I do know
  that he picked up several more that were too large to transfer on his PC).
  Because of his gargantuan efforts, Prozac is most definitely the MVP this
  month for PSG, but he was by no means the only person throwing in a lot of
  effort.  In addition, Wolverine and CyberPhreak both get honorable mentions
  as both of these guys did a lot of cracks for the group.  Especially notable
  is the fact that this is CyberPhreak's first month cracking games, and
  despite that, he was able to crack 6 games of varying difficulty.  He also
  came through with a couple original supplies this month.  Several others in
  PSG also made huge efforts that did not net them an MVP award - Grudge, who
  cracked many of Prestige's games and even supplied one, Shadow Master, who,
  as usual provided a boost in original supplying and of course organization,
  and of course the new PSG rookies that did a nice job bringing in some nice
  titles.

    Hybrid appeared slow out of the gate, but a nice performance by both the
  Scandinavian and UK divisions of the group carried them into second place.
  Mad Turnip was the most impressive, cranking out 5 titles and cracking all
  of them himself, but Animal & Dogfriend turned in a solid performance as
  well, supplying & cracking 3 good titles this month.  In addition, Le Vey,
  Hot Tuna, and Phoenix all turned in performances valuable to the group.
  As usual, Mad Turnip wins the MVP for Hybrid with his outstanding supply in
  the UK, and Animal & Dogfriend win the honorable mention, helping to carry
  the group with solid, quality titles.

    Razor made an extremely mediocre showing this month, despite the release
  of the long-awaited Red Alert from Virgin.  Because of this, there are no
  honorable mentions for the group, but Beowulf wins the MVP for his great job
  on Red Alert as well as several other titles from Razor.  No one supplier
  sticks out for Razor this month, because they didn't release very much, but
  Hooligan and Dark Rebellion both contributed 2 titles to the group.

    Paradigm sat at the bottom of the pile again this month, due in large
  part to very poor cracking/ripping from this young group.  No one supplier
  sticks out in this group either, as they were only able to manage 5 games
  during the course of the month, perhaps PDM will have an MVP next month.

    In rookie scoring, Karrade performed admirably for Prestige, cranking out
  7 titles as part of their successful East Coast Supply Team.  Since joining
  Paradigm, however, he has not been able to beat the other PSG suppliers.  It
  remains to be seen if Karrade is just a "flash in the pan" or if he can have
  the mettle to be successful in the long term within another group.  However,
  a 7-release performance would make him a top supplier by any measure, so I
  feel that it would only be fair to give Karrade, a true rookie, the rookie
  of the month award.  Other top rookies included Q-Ball, who supplied 2 games
  this month, and CyberPhreak, who started a new chapter in his scene career
  as he cracked 6 games for Prestige.  Congratulations, guys!

  THE WARE REPORT - November '96 - Monthly Scoring Summary

  * Items in Parentheses are listed in the order of (Supply, Crack).
  * Credit is always given to only one supplier.  In some groups, this month
    PSG, there were several times when the same 2 guys were given credit for
    games.  I have tried to be fair and alternate the credit, first giving it
    to one supplier, then to the next.  Hopefully this system is equitable.
  * One point is awarded to an individual for a crack or supply.
  * Members who have not produced an original or crack in the last few years
    are considered rookies, as are of course newcomers.
