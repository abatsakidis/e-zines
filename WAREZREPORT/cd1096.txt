The Ware Report .. Official Rules ...

I.  Definitions.

    PLAYABLE - The game is cracked, and can be played by someone who speaks
    only English.
   
    COMPLETEABLE - The ware report does not go by the definition "playable."
    Because games must be ripped from CD, they must be COMPLETEABLE in order
    to be accepted.  This means that you don't rip out tracks, levels, or
    trivia questions in order to get a release out.  It's okay to take out
    sound, animations, and music, provided that these are not essential to
    the completion of the game as it was designed by the publishers.  Any
    other license taken at the group's discretion is subject to my review.

    DUPE - The game was released before, by another group.  Usually this
    means that the group released the game several hours too late, but this
    rule also applies if a group releases an update and tries to pass it off
    as a sequel.

    FAKE - An unplayable, or unfinished version of a game.

    CREDIT - Full credit means the group put out a new, completeable game,
    and cracked it properly the first time.  They receive all megabytes that
    are associated with the game as part of their group score.  Half credit
    means that the game came out badly cracked, or in need of a fix, but the
    group did fix it, so it only loses 1/2 of the megabytes.  Both full and
    half credit allow the group to retain the full release points for the
    game, in addition to whatever meggage has been awarded.  No credit means
    that the game was not completable, or released uncracked and fixed by
    a different group.  In this last case, the group receives 0 megabytes
    for the release, and 0 release points.  Screw-ups like that can really
    hurt your average for the month.

II.  Rules ...

  A.  SPA Compliance - This report is fully compliant with all the rules set
      forth by the SPA several months ago:

      1.  Only games of 50 disks or less will be considered.
      2.  Only final versions will be considered.
      3.  Only games completeable by English-speakers will be considered.

  B.  Extensions to SPA Compliance.

      1.  Only the first, completeable version will be considered.
      2.  Trainers, Patches, Upgrades & the like are not considered.
      3.  If a game is a DUPE or FAKE the group will not get credit.
      4.  If a game is released uncracked and later fixed by the releaser,
          the group gets 1/2 credit.  If another group fixes it, the
          original group gets no credit while the cracking group gets 1/2
          credit for the release.

  C.  The Ware Report Group Rating System - The group rating is based on
      3 things - number of releases, meggage of releases, and release rating.

      1.  Number of releases - Self-explanatory.
      2.  Meggage of releases - Self-explanatory.
      3.  Release ratings - The rating is a number, from 0 to 9, rating the
          game's importance to the scene.  This means that big, anticipated
          titles, which are of course more difficult competition, will get
          higher ratings than smaller titles from smaller publishers.  This
          explains why BattleCruiser 3000 got a 9 (the highest rating) while
          Death Rally only got an 8, even though Death Rally is more fun to
          play.  Quality of a release doesn't usually come into play on the
          rating, unless the game is a real "sleeper" (ie the original
          WarCraft) or a major disappointment.

       *  Rating Bonuses.  While I can't find a fair way to penalize groups
          for ripping games poorly, I CAN reward groups for ripping them
          properly.  This means that the smaller the rip, the higher the
          bonus points:

            1 - 10 disks .. +1.00               31 - 40 disks .. + 0.25
           11 - 20 disks .. +0.75               41 - 50 disks .. no bonus
           21 - 30 disks .. +0.50

       *  Group Rating Formula - The group rating is calculated as follows:

           (Sum of all Ratings+Bonuses)
           ---------------------------- * (Awarded Meggage) = Group Rating
            (Total Number of releases)

                              Should not have been released, as online

                              file in each of the 49 disks.  Re-released by
                              PSG the following day.
                             Third Reich - Originally released with a non-
                              working crack.  Fixed by PSG 2 hours later.

 Prestige - Comments ...

   For the second consecutive month, Prestige has reached the 24 release
 mark, a record set in early '95 by TDUJam.  This month, however, PSG did
 not just meet the record, but blew it out of the water, as the group
 totaled 36 releases for the month of October, averaging more than one
 title a day.  This kind of production has never been seen before on any
 platform, and this world record is sure to stand for some time.

   Releasing a wide variety of games, Prestige put out a lot of medium-
 range titles, such as Yahtzee for Win95, Third Reich PC, and Toy Story.
 In addition to the games of medium quality, Prestige hit big with hot
 titles like War Wind, BattleCruiser 3000, and Death Rally, all sure-fire
 hit releases.  Competitors in other groups who'd like to believe that PSG
 set the record by putting out a bunch of low-quality, budget titles, are
 really kidding themselves.  With titles like MicroSoft Golf 3.0, Cold
 Shadow, Hyper Blade, and others, its easy to see why Prestige is the #1
 group again this October.

   On the downside, PSG did make a few mistakes worth mentioning this
 month.  Third Reich PC was badly cracked, Meridian 59 was unplayable w/out
 a serial number (which could only be used once, so it was useless anyway),
 as it is playable through an online service only, and Pilot's ToyBox was
 released with the same RARchive in each of the 49 disks.  To PSG's credit,
 however, every fixable screw-up was fixed, promptly.  That might be small
 consolation to users who grabbed the initial release of Pilot's ToyBox,
 only to realize that they had grabbed the same disk 49 times, but its
 good to know that a group cares enough to fix its mistakes.

   The question now:  What has allowed PSG to be so sinfully successful
 for such an extended period of time?  PSG has been on top for 4 of the
 last 5 months, burying groups like Razor and RomLight beneath mountains
 of releases.  What is doing it for Prestige?  And can the mix of people
 producing this success continue to do so in the future?

   1.  Supplying.  Prestige has by far the most stable supply corps out of
       any of the major groups, even Zeus' Paradigm.  With more than 15
       proven suppliers (the highest number out of any group), Prestige is
       head and shoulders above the competition in the race for US titles.
       In Europe, Prestige is lacking, having pulled only one game in the
       last two months from that continent.

       Supply Rating (Europe)  - 1/10
       Supply Rating (US)      - 9/10

   2.  Cracking.  Prestige boasts the deepest cracking section across
       two continents of any of the major groups.  With Wolverine and
       Shadow Seeker as the chief US crackers, and Grudge as the high-
       powered specialist from Australia, Prestige can handle just about
       anything.  When those three are unable to provide a crack for a
       game, PSG can call on any of a number of European crackers, such
       as Tinox, LTD, Sternone, and Lost Soul.  Only Hybrid can boast
       cracking as good as Prestige's, but even they have their cracking
       based only in one continent.

       Cracking Rating (Europe) - 7/10 (Grudge, L.Soul, LTD, Tinox, Sternone)
       Cracking Rating (US)     - 9/10 (Wolverine, Shadow Seeker)

   3.  The "Winner" Factor.  Being a winner brings a lot of fans, and many
       of those fans can turn into quality members over time.  Prestige is
       a winner, and many of the members, such as Shadow Master, Wolverine,
       The Renegade Chemist, and others are known as being associated with
       winning groups.  INC was also known as a "winner" back in '90-92,
       and that is a big reason why the group was successful for so long.
       As a famous coach once said, "Winning is contagious.  So is losing."

 Noteworthy +'s and -'s ...

 (+) Both of RomLight's US suppliers, Andeveron and CyberPhreak, left for
     Prestige in early October.  This helped Prestige have the record
     month, as these guys supplied about 10 games between the two of them.

 (+) Prozac, Illusion's top US supplier, joined PSG in the middle of the
     month, and has already supplied the group with 4 or 5 good titles.
     His contributions have definitely been beneficial to the group, and
     he will continue to become more valuable over time.

 (+) Two former Razor 1911 suppliers, Pest and Karrade, have both moved
     over to Prestige.  Pest has been in retirement for some time and has
     yet to supply a game under the PSG banner, but Karrade has already
     proved valuable, supplying two huge titles for PSG in early November.

 (+) With the Christmas Rush in full swing, Prestige's supply methods will
     be more effective than ever before, which means lots of titles for all
     of Prestige's myriad of suppliers.  Individual successes promote
     group victories, and there will be lots of those successes this month.

 (-) Even though PSG is blowing the other groups away consistently, it is
     still making too many mistakes when releases come out.  Three mistakes
     in 36 releases might not sound like much, but its far worse than it
     could be.  Now that PSG has set an untouchable world record, it should
     slow down and concentrate on testing everything thoroughly before it
     goes out the door.

 (-) Although it acquired Sternone and The Undertaker from Razor's European
     division, Prestige has yet to make major inroads into the European
     software markets.  Until it does so, Prestige is relying on US titles
     alone to carry it through.

 Predictions & Summation ...

   Prestige has emerged victorious for another glorious month.  The only
 question remaining is, can they do it again?  The mix of suppliers and
 crackers in this group should be able to compete with anyone, barring a
 major catastrophe.  But will they be able to pull out another victory in
 November?

   My prediction is that yes, Prestige will once again be victorious in
 November, and without major personnel changes, I predict a victory in
 December as well.  The one word that you can use to describe Prestige is
 depth.  This is the deepest group that anybody's put together in a long
 time.  If one supplier or cracker goes AWOL, there are enough others to
 pick up the slack and move on.  In addition, Prestige's system is fund-
 amentally sound.  Suppliers that have been non-productive, or low-
 production in other groups have come on board and cranked out tons of
 titles under the Prestige banner.  That's a credit to the leadership,
 and as long as that leadership is in place, the group will run well.

 Prediction:  1st Place, 20-25 releases.

 Notes/Explanations        : Broken Sword - Uncracked; Hybrid fixed.

  Hybrid - Comments ...

    Hybrid is one of the few groups around that is fun to watch.  Quality
  cracks, nicely-packaged releases (complete with installers, intros, etc),
  and a little panache from the group's leadership make Hybrid a worthy
  adversary.  Its nice to see smaller groups like this one succeed on a big
  scale, turning in a strong 2nd place finish in October.

    As usual, Hybrid can thank Mad Turnip for its top finish, but he is by
  no means the only guy in the group doing anything.  Phoenix, Hybrid's top
  cracker, has come through time and time again as Hybrid put out 17 games
  for the month.  Only one of them needed a fix, as Broken Sword had a CD
  check that was not removed, but Hybrid handled it promptly.  And the ever-
  faithful Animal & Dogfriend came through several times this month as well.

    None of the games that HBD released in October were what I'd call "high
  profile" titles, at least in the US.  Broken Sword was a big hit as a
  quality adventure game, and Hybrid did put out several titles from Virgin
  and Sierra, but no major releases a la BattleCruiser 3000 (Prestige),
  Syndicate Wars (Paradigm), or Eradicator (Razor 1911).  However, the
  group made up for it by releasing a nice assortment of very playable
  titles.

    What makes Hybrid, a small group, so successful?

    1.  Supplying.  In most groups it would be considered a weakness, but
        Hybrid's one-sided supplying tends to be more of a strength than
        anything else.  Mad Turnip is what I'd call "the Zeus of Europe,"
        in that he's able to hit so many titles from so many different
        companies before they are commercially available.  Turnip domin-
        ates in England much as Zeus dominated in the US for a long time.
        Until someone learns his secrets, I suspect that Turnip will be
        the "King of England" for some time.  Additionally, Hybrid has
        the duo of Animal & Dogfriend in Denmark.  This pair bags 1-3
        games a month for Hybrid, and helps to put them over the top.

        Supply Rating (Europe)  - 9/10
        Supply Rating (US)      - 0/10

    2.  Cracking.  Hybrid has an excellent blend of crackers, with the
        top duo being Phoenix, an experienced cracker in England, and
        Cyber, a very skilled cracker in Sweden.  In addition to these
        two, which would probably be enough to get the group by, Hybrid
        has Replicator on hand, and even Mad Turnip and Hoson have
        successfully cracked many games.  With such a well of talented
        cracking to pull from, Hybrid has zero worries in that area.

        Cracking Rating (Europe) - 9/10 (Phoenix, Cyber, Repl., Turnip, Hoson,
                                         Animal, Dogfriend)
        Cracking Rating (US)     - 0/10

    3.  The "Small Group" factor.  Because Hybrid is a small operation,
        the members stay focused and motivated.  Hybrid doesn't really
        need anybody else to be successful, so they can be selective
        about who they ask to be a part of their group.  If the group
        is ever able to get a top US supplier to join their ranks, they
        will truly be a consistent threat.

  Noteworthy +'s and -'s ...

   (+) Mad Turnip's recent run-in with the British police doesn't seem to
       have affected his supply performance, as he once again led Hybrid to
       a great finish for the month.

   (+) Hybrid has conceded that couriers are an important part of the group,
       and have set up a small courier division.  This will help their WHQ
       internet site as well as the rapid spreading of all new HBD releases.
       The team already has helped, aiding in Hybrid's win on Scorched
       Planet, when they were duped by Razor 1911.

   (-) Hybrid has yet to make any major inroads into the US, which means
       that if Mad Turnip has a slow month, Hybrid has a bad one.

  Predictions & Summation ...

    Hybrid is a small group, perpetually poised on the brink of major victory.
  The pieces they are missing to complete their puzzle are in America.  If
  the group is able to recruit several top American suppliers, they could
  really be a number one contender every month.  As it is, nobody's too busy
  worrying about Hybrid, because everybody knows that all they can get are
  the UK releases.  We're willing to write those off, but when Hybrid does
  start to make inroads into the American supply markets, competition will
  most definitely get hotter.

    For the month of October, I'll stick with a prediction of 4th place, as
  I think it'll be considerably slower in Europe this month than it was in
  October.  I do think, however, that it'll be a very close 4th place, and
  the group might even beat Razor out of 3rd.  There won't be too many big
  losers in the month of November, with so many games coming out.

  Prediction:  4th place, 7-10 releases.

  ZEUS/Paradigm - Comments ...

    Paradigm is a new group, launched by the famous US supplier Zeus, the
  remnants of the defunct RomLight, and members of the German group, Dynasty.
  The group has cranked out several quality releases, and appears to be a
  force to be reckoned with for the rest of the year.

    After his departure from Prestige, there was a lot of speculation about
  what would happen to Zeus.  Would he hang it up, as he hinted he might be
  interested in retirement?  Would he join another group, as many groups
  were rumored to have propositioned him about joining?  Or would he start
  his own group?  Our questions were answered when Zeus decided to form a
  group, named after himself.


    The initial premise behind the formation of ZEUS was to find out if a
  small group could hang with the "big boys." as Zeus referred to the larger
  groups.  At first, his plan went successfully, with ZEUS putting out two
  titles from Maxis - SimCopter and SimGolf, and following those up with
  a major game - Syndicate Wars from Bullfrog/EA.  It later came out that
  SimCopter was a beta, and SimGolf didn't even work.  Perhaps his early
  mistakes are what discouraged him, but for whatever reason, Zeus chose
  to disband his group.

    Dynasty had been a successful group in Germany for quite some time.  A
  few months ago, the DNS guys joined up with Hybrid and helped them to a
  victory in August.  Because of internal trouble in Hybrid, the Dynasty
  members left and went back to their old label again.  When ZEUS made it
  public in the NFO file that the group would soon become a new one, the
  DNS guys were interested.  Clearly there was an opportunity here, for a
  group that had only a major US supplier, but no crackers, and no European
  suppliers.  So, the Dynasty members decided to team up with ZEUS and came
  up with the new group, Paradigm.

    There was still another group-entity floating about, a group of members
  who felt that they could still contribute to the scene, but were not in a
  good position to do so in their current group.  These guys were RomLight
  members, or what was left of RLT, anyway.  Seeing an opportunity to
  associate themselves with a good supplier, Holy Beast, Hemp Hoodlum, and
  the rest of the RomLight members jumped ship to Paradigm.  In fact, Holy
  Beast cracked PDM's inaugural release, FIFA '97.  It's pretty much common
  knowledge that Holy Beast is one of the better crackers around, and the
  fact that most of the originals that PDM will get will be inside titles
  from Zeus should allow him to crack many titles for the group.  The rest
  of the RLT members have yet to prove their worth to the group, but I
  imagine that they were brought on board for a reason, so expect to see
  something from them sometime soon.

  Assessments ...

    1.  Supplying.  PDM has one of the strongest US suppliers of all time
        in Zeus.  If he is operating at peak efficiency, Zeus can make it
        difficult on every other US supplier.  To date, we've not seen him
        really turn it on in '96.  That may change with the Christmas Rush,
        and more free time for him to work his magic.  In Europe, Paradigm
        will probably get 2-3 games a month from the Dynasty connection.
        However, PDM still lacks the East Coast supply team that they will
        need to compete with Prestige for the bulk of the US titles, but
        if Zeus gets on top of his game, they may not need it.

        Supply Rating (Europe)  - 2/10
        Supply Rating (US)      - 6/10

    2.  Cracking.  While the group does not have a large corps of crackers,
        the ones they do have should be enough to get them by unless they
        are in a race with another group.  Holy Beast can handle most of the
        protections thrown at him, but there is a speed factor involved.
        Again, the nature by which most of the originals are supplied to PDM
        will give Holy Beast an edge here.  But should PDM get a fast East
        Coast supplier, they will need a fast US cracker to complement him.

        Cracker Rating (Europe) - 5/10 (Holy Beast)
        Cracker Rating (USA)    - 0/10

    3.  The "ZEUS" Factor.  Because Zeus is such a famous supplier, he can
        attract a lot of quality people to his banner.  However, this factor
        can wear off if Zeus doesn't exploit his abilities and bag a bunch
        of major titles.  The group also benefits from the "New Group"
        Factor, which is also a magnet for good people.

  Noteworthy +'s and -'s ...

   (+) After months of inactivity, Zeus seems to be getting active again.
       He is the ultimate leader of Paradigm, and could carry it to victory
       single-handedly.

   (+) Paradigm has had early successes in both the US and Europe, which
       can only serve to bind the members in the group closer together.
       The best chemistry in a group is always attained when everyone is
       successful on an individual level.

   (-) Paradigm has already deviated from their initial promises.  The
       group initially promised "no mistakes, no budget releases," but
       hasn't yet lived up to that pledge.  Already, Paradigm has cracked
       a budget title (CyberDome) and there have been fixes out for FIFA's
       sound.

   (-) There are a number of members in the NFO file who don't seem to do
       anything.  This is not a problem to PDM's execution, per se, but it
       is certainly a turn-off for quality people who might want to join a
       new group.

  Predictions & Summation ...

    PDM is a group with a lot of potential.  I'm not sure exactly why Zeus
  chose to abandon his idea of a small group, as I really thought it could
  work out, in favor of a larger one.  In any case, what's done is done,
  and PDM has already shown a consistent performance.  If they can keep it
  up, cut the fat, and recruit a few more good US suppliers, as well as a
  good US cracker, PDM could really be a threat.  Of course, if Zeus is able
  to repeat his performance of the last two Christmas seasons, PDM may not
  need anyone else in order to blow out the competition.

    Because of Zeus's track record in November/December, and because PDM has
  the crackers to do it, I predict a 2nd place finish for PDM for the month
  of December.  I think they'll get out a lot of big titles, and impress a
  lot of people, but I don't think they'll put out the quantities necessary
  to be #1.

  Prediction: 2nd place, 10-15 releases.

  Razor 1911 - Comments ...

    By now, everybody's wanting to know if the rumors are true, if Razor's
  edge has been dulled by tough competition from Prestige and other groups.
  Although the answer is self-evident to many in the know, some of you may
  not realize the foreboding goings-on over at the Blade, so let's examine
  them, in detail.

    For starters, Razor has been beaten for the fifth consecutive month.
  Beaten badly, I might add.  While September's loss to Prestige was tough,
  it was certainly bearable, as even in defeat Razor was able to bring out
  a few great titles, such as MechWarrior II: Mercenaries and Madden '97.
  The month of October was nowhere near as rewarding for the Razor team.
  The group was able to manage only 4 legitimate releases, with 3 others
  coming out under the Razor banner falling by the wayside as fakes and/or
  dupe releases.  The biggest game Razor had this month, Eradicator, is by
  no means a bad title but is most definitely a forgettable one, as are
  all of the other games presented this month by the group.

    Why the reason for this dismal failure by the group?  There are a
  number of factors influencing Razor's poor performance:

    1.  Supplying.  Razor used to have several options where originals
        were concerned.  With competent suppliers in both the US and
        Europe, Razor could turn to one continent when the other failed
        them.  With the departure of The Undertaker to Prestige, and
        the resurgence of Mad Turnip of Hybrid, Razor no longer has the
        European option, so the group must rely on the North American
        supply team to bring home the bacon, something they have not
        been able to do since early in the year.  With Prestige's hot
        supply crew on the East Coast, and Zeus sucking up the inside
        originals from many of the major publishers, the competition
        has gotten much hotter for Razor, and they haven't been able
        to adjust to that.

        Supply Rating (Europe)   - 2/10
        Supply Rating (US)       - 3/10

    2.  Cracking.  I mentioned last month that Razor no longer had the
        edge in cracking, either, and this month they proved my point.
        Razor lost on two games because of poor cracking speed, one of
        those being HyperBlade, a US original, the other Scorched Planet,
        a game from the UK.  On HyperBlade, Razor actually put the thing
        out uncracked (by The Speed Racer's own admission!), hoping that
        by the time disk 50 was up on sites, disk 1, containing the crack,
        would be ready.  Unfortunately for Razor, Prestige had put the
        game out, fully cracked, about 45 minutes before Razor started to
        spread their uncracked version.  Scorched Planet wasn't quite as
        bad a beating, but Hybrid's cracking speed came through as they
        beat Razor everywhere, spreading the cracked version like wildfire
        shortly before Razor got theirs out.

        Cracking Rating (Europe) - 4/10 (Mod, Faceless, Bunter)
        Cracking Rating (US)     - 3/10 (Beowulf)

    3.  The TSR Factor - TSR's reputation is starting to catch up with
        him.  You can only blacklist so many people for leaving your group
        before others start to get the message.  Members of Razor are
        actually afraid to leave because they fear what consequences TSR's
        wrath may bring.  For those already in the group, you're out of
        luck.  But fear is not an attractive option to quality people in
        search of a group to join.

  Noteworthy +'s and -'s ...

  (+) The GEcko has remained active for a 2nd consecutive month, putting out
      a small Casino game from Sierra Online.  If he is able to spare much
      time for Razor, they will be a lot better off.

  (+) Egoistic Fate's board, Malevolance, was promoted to the Razor USHQ
      position.  This may get Ego more interested in helping the group win,
      and he supplied Amok, a game from GT, this month.

  (-) Blue Adept, Razor's release coordinator for several months, has left
      the group, disgusted with the poor performance and bad attitudes of
      its members.  Guys like this are important to the success of Razor,
      as a large number of Razor releases were to pass through Adept's hands.

  (-) Midnight Grave Digger (MGD), the premier FTP trader of the group, has
      left, unhappy about the low number and quality of releases.  The loss
      of MGD directly relates to Razor's recent struggles on the internet,
      as with him they would have had a better chance of winning on both of
      the losses they incurred.

  Predictions & Summation ...

    Razor has taken another beating this month, and this one will be tougher
  to swallow than the last.  The question now is if the group has the guts
  to bounce back from a bloody defeat, and if they do, does Razor have the
  resources to get back to number one?  November and December will yield
  the answers to these questions.

    My prediction is that Razor will bounce back from this overwhelming
  defeat at the hands of Prestige to make a decent 3rd place showing in
  November.  I don't think the group is about to die, but I do think that
  if they don't make at least a decent showing this month, December could
  be a very bad month for Razor.  More people are bound to leave soon, as
  a few are only holding on by a thread.

  Prediction:  3rd Place, 7-10 releases.

   Its been another eventful month in the scene, and it already looks like
 November will be just as much fun.  Prestige surged to a huge victory, once
 again, while Hybrid brought up second place with a dazzling show of European
 titles.  The surprise group of the month was of course Paradigm, formed from
 the ashes of a dead RomLight (incidentally, I predicted that RLT wouldn't
 make it into November in my last report, and guess what, it didn't!), Dynasty
 and ZEUS.  October saw Prestige set a new world record, the once-sharp blade
 at the bottom, and lots of releases in between.

 * Razor did not put down the real name for any of the games supplied this
   month, and none of the crackers were in a position to make an impressive
   showing, and with such a dismal performance it was clear to me that none
   of the organizers were putting forth enough work, so I didn't know who
   deserved the MVP for the month.

 The Official Ware Report MVP for October - Mad Turnip of Hybrid
                        Honorable Mention - Shadow Master of Paradigm

 What is an MVP?  The MVP is the person whose group could least bear the
 loss were he to leave.  Mad Turnip is the MVP in October because if it
 were not for him supplying 85%+ of Hybrid's titles, they'd barely be on
 the board.  Shadow Master is not as important to his group as Turnip is
 to his own, because if SMaster were to vanish, Prestige still has others
 who could keep Prestige at nearly the same levels of output as before.
 This absolutely, positively does NOT mean that if you were not selected
 as the MVP that you are not important to your group; it simply means that
 the MVP is most likely a person who carried the group for the whole month.

 * NOTES:  The report took longer than usual to put out because there were
           more games than usual, and because I've changed the format to add
           more commentary & analysis than ever before.  I hope the new
           format will allow you to get more insight into the major groups
           and what makes them tick.  Also please note that much of this
           commentary and stuff was written on or about November 3rd, so if
           any of it seems inaccurate now, I apologize.  I intend to stick
           with my original predictions about the groups, since they are
           the ones I made at the outset of the month, even though the month
           is now nearly 1/3rd over and the performances have not been what
           I expected.
