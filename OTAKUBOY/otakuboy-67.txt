   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

  This will come as a surprise, but everyday, OtakuBoy must
take off his clothes. I'm quite embarassed to admit it,
really. And yet I feel I must. Because when I take off my
clothes -- which consists of the spiffy outfit you see me
wearing on my way-cool megasite (www.otakuboy.com) -- I find
that I have to put on REAL clothes and go out and work at a
job. The point of all this is that I've just taken a new job
and I'm adjusting to the change in time schedule. Once I do,
which I imagine will only take one more week, OtakuBoy will
be back with his regular scheduled updates and outfit. Work
sucks.

-- PlayStation 2 Announced, the BEST stories - News
   Ok, ok. So the news is out there, right? So, who's
written the BEST stories about it, eh? WHO? WHO!??!?!?!?
THE Next-Generation Online story "the industry reacts" with
quotes from industry executives takes the cake. Beyond all
the tech specs, we get to hear what the game developers and
publisher think about this new machine. (Also, check out
Peter Molyneaux's (of Lionhead) prediction.) Second,
IGNPSX's PSX2 FAQ. Then Console Domain translates much of
techier notes of the announcements into plain English!
(Thank GOD!!!!! Not to say that Console Domain is God. Al-
though if someone erected a monument...) Oh, and a couple
of people have asked me to explain the PSX2's "backward
compatibility." Well, I'm going to leave that to this cool,
if a bit techy, explanation on Videogames.com.

-- Nikkei interviews Ken Kutaragi - Interview
   Well, you know, that Ken Kutaragi is like "father of
PlayStation." Well, he's like Grandfather of PlayStation2.
So, everyone wants to know what he thinks. EVERYONE! EVERY-
ONE!!!! Check out this interview on AsiaBizTech.

-- PSX2. The movies. - Movies
   Well, in a display of raw power (because a display of
cooked power wouldn't be as interesting), Sony showed off
movies made on the new PSX2 -- at least whatever guts there
are of it.  The movies have been ALL over the net and now
they're HERE in OtakuBoy, culled from all over the net.

-- Blast Radius - Review 
   Like DEFENDER? (Do you remember DEFENDER?) Then you'll
like BLAST RADIUS, so says GameCenter. It's like COLONY WARS
lite. Half the calories; 30% less fat. And best of all, it
won't make you sleepy. Try new BLAST RADIUS, from the makers
of Raisin Bran. I buy it for my family.

-- Dreamcast $189? - News/Rumor? 
   Ever notice how when a new system is gonna come out,
gaming mags start referring to prices as "price points?"
Suddenly, they start treating reading like they're retail-

with the $30.00 price point.) Anyway, GameFan caught a new
Dreamcast price point in the LATimes recently. Gotta get the
scrilla. Gotta getcha cash pay. C'mon! Got ta git it!
