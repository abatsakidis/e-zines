   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Wowza! I canna' believe all de news a-reportin' today! 
It's like someone took a biggie fries and put them in a 
salad shooter and pressed "go." It's like Robin Williams
once said: "My knees explode and my socks fall off." It's
like I'm making absolutely no sense.

        D r e a m c a s t  &  S a t u r n  (DC & SAT)

   But maybe this does make sense. You see, Sega's always
said that the Dreamcast had, like, major upgrade options. 
Major, man. Major! Like, for instance, DVD? Imagine this
scenario -- the PSX2 is announced and Sony's all happy that
not will their machine have 72 Megs of RAM (a current rumor,
see below OtakuBoyeees), it'll have DVD up de wazoo. Well,
then Sega smiles and says, "HAH! Take a look at our upgrade,
Dreamcasters! Full-on DVD and more RAM. HAH! Take that 
Sony." And Sony says, "CURSE YOU SEGAAAAAAAAAH!" Anyway,
GameSpot has the rumor/news straight from an industry pub
that Sega's got some o' these upgrades floatin' around 
their offices in Japan.

-- The Dreamcast to become a DVD machine? - News/Rumor?
-- http://headline.gamespot.com/news/99_02/09_vg_dvddc/index.html


   Wow! I really want a DVD player. I hope that I'll be 
able to rent Air Force One AND NiGHTS 2! Anyhoo, that's 
more of less rumor ya know. Over the weekend, Sega sup-
posedly made some big announcement about all kinds of
Euro-Dreamcast stuff. Like what? Well, how about a BLUE
Dreamcast logo? How a list o' launch titles? The news is
ALL over the Internet today. (In fact, I don't know who
broke the story first. I heard it from SegaX first! but
it seems like this d00d in Germany, who runs a site called
GAME-OVER sent mail to nearly every single gaming site out
there.) Anyhoo, if you want to quick skinny, check out
FGNOnline's story. It's quick and lists all the pertinent
facts. Gaming-Age's news is a little more extensive, but
what's really important here are the hands-on impressions
of MONACO GP buried within. (Oh, and there's a bit about 
the Euro Launch Date!)

-- "DC Rumor Reach Warpspeed"
-- http://www.gaming-age.com/news2/february99/020899h.htm (more hands-on, quite extensive, include Monaco GP first-impressions)


   Meanwhile, you want to check out SegaX even if you get
the rumor-news elsewhere. Cause the guys posted a mini-
interview with Sega Europe confirming some details, playing
'not sure' on others (WOW! Less than 97 no-comments?) Also,
9/9/99 seems to be a good Dreamcast Euro-date. But what
about America. Yeah, yeah. Everyone's been sayin' the same
date, but it seems like the Associated Press has a different
idea. SegaX has the summary of the AP story, and I've in-
cluded a link to the AP story belooooooooow.

   HARK! Are you still trying to download those Sonic menus
in English. STILL! Well, Sonic Zone tries to help. And, wow!
They even have screen shots and sound clips to aid you 
along. (Boo HOO! I can't seem to understand the darn sound
clip!)

   Yo yo yo! A shout out to all my Anime-lovin' homeys kick-
in' up on that west siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide! (Wow,
I think that actually sounds pretty good. Send criticisms to
Otakuboy@bigfoot.com.) Anyway, SENTIMENTAL GRAFITTI is 
comin! Honest and fer true! Just as ole Sega X, who seems to
have a big lock on the news today.

   Whoops! I'm not explaining myself fully. You see, 
SENTIMENTAL GRAFITTI is what they call one of those dating
games. You know! You pick your opposing (or simliar) gender,
the prospective dates all scroll across the screen in the
old Atari 2600 TARGET FUN type action. You shoot questions
as them as they go by -- "Wanna go on a date," "Wanna dance"
-- and after they all turn you down, the game's over. It's 
quite the challenge.

-- Sentimental Grafitti is comin' - News
-- http://www.segadreamcast.net/news/news_990209_sentgraf2.htm


   Yeah, yeah, yeah! REDLINE RACER is comin' to DC. It's the
super motorcyclin' arcade game. And SegaX has shots. 

-- Redline Racer is comin' - News/Shots
-- http://www.segadreamcast.net/news/news_990208_redlinedc.htm


   Meanwhile, IGNDreamcast has actually updated their site
two days in a row. I think Christ will be comin' soon. Any-
hoo, the ole boys got to check out POWER STONE recently,
and they have shots taken from a shoulder mounted camera.
Hehehehe... It's kinda fun to watch.

   What's this? An IGN64 link in the DC section? Am I in-

You see, at the very bottom of the READY 2 RUMBLE preview,
is a tiny note: It's comin' out for Dreamcast!

   I hope you didn't get all nervous over that silly news
about Dreamcast bein' all upgradable and stuff to DVD! Don't
worry about yo' pretty little heads. Cause word on PSX
Nation that the PSX2 is gonna come with 72 FRIKKIN MEGS!
(FRIKKEN MEGS are actually 156 pin chips that really 
scream! ;) Ah, well, it's all a rumor anyway.

   YOW! Super! SUPER! S U P E R ! feature on the POCKET
STATION over on Gaming-Age. So super, I like read the whole
thing nine times before I managed to simply copy the URL
and put it in O.O. Right. Right. Anyhoo, this feature goes
over everything PocketStation, from the outside all the way
to what you can do if you gots STREET FIGHTER ZERO 3. The
d00dz even have MP3 filez of the sound this little puppy
works up. Definitely worth the click.

   IGNPSX has a super ROLL CAGE interview. They ask the 
game a lot of questions, but there's not too much dialouge
really. I mean they ask the game a question and it sits
there... playing with itself. (Demo mode.) So, they got 
ahold of Chris Gibbs, Managing Director (he manages to
direct). The interview's all about ATD, their gameography,
how ROLL CAGE came out about (oh, you Sega Rally, you... 
you inspire the mighty game o' out lives). And always re-
member that OtakuBoy brought you news of the FIRST Roll
Cage interview, which I seen over on PlayStationFan. So,
I went there and found they have a new preview AND REVIEW!
And they're both on the same page! That's JUST JUST JUST
UN-NATURAL!

   Is NAMCO on the fence about which Next-Next-Generation
console to support? Will they support two? Three? Will they
create their own console? Will they leave the games busi-
ness all together and go into oven-mitts? (Hey, the Strohs
company just left the beer business, so anything's possi-
ble.) Anyway, all these questions and MORE in Kingboxer's
Rumors on PSXMax.

   Ah, wouldn't life be grand if U.S. game companies adver-
tised new games on the radio. Imagine driving down the 
street, bopping to Barry Manilow (wheeeeeeeen willl iiiiii

   Really, now. Is BUST-A-MOVE '99 all that and a bag of
Frito Scoops? Honest! Well, I can't tell what IGN is sayin'
in this preview on IGNPSX. It's a bit campy, a bit satiri-
cal, a bit cynical, a bit humorous, a bit callous, a bit
bittersweet, a bit sad, a bit loony, and a bit -- just a
touch -- anxious.

   Have you ever wanted to make your own fighter? Hey, that
sounds like a song Olivia Neutron-Bomb once sang: "Have
you never wanted to make your own fiiighter! Have you never
wanted to make a super stronger character that could grind
all other characters into the ground. Have you never let
someone else be strong?" Anyhoo, Game Informer previews 
FIGHTER MAKER! And I'm a might scared. I remember all those
"construction sets" on previous computers that didn't go
all that well. OH, this one was pretty cool: Anyone remember

   When E.F. Hutton talks, readers of this newsletter don't
listen. But when Nintendo talks, they do. And Nintendo has
spoken. (Tis time for another Mighty Lips comment, brought
to you by the prose-wranglers at Videogamers.com.) Nintendo
opened their mighty lips and said that POKEMONSNAP and
POKEMON STADIUM will come on N64! Woohoo! Details on IGN64.

Anyway, a big preview over on IGN64. Also on IGN 64, take
Take Mario Kart 64. Now add Looney Tunes characters and

   GameSpotUK interviews Peter Molyneux. He's the d00d that
used to head BullFrog, but now he's like at Lionhead. They
talk about the state of gaming, where the industry can go
and blah, blah, blah. Meanwhile, he also tired of the rising
cost of French Fries. (Actually, that's not in there. I'm
just grasping at straws. The truth: It's a decent interview
