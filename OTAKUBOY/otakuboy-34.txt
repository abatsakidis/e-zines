   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

    ConsoleCity is three (click) three (click) three (click)
three sites in one! First, there's PSXMax, a premier PSXsite
with all things PlayStation. (You have to check out
Kingboxer's Rumor Mill!) Then there's The Nth Dimension, 
with their oft-scoops on cool movies. And, finally, there's
Dreamcast Insider, which sticks to Dreamcast like cooked
rice sticks to a bride and groom. 

   OtakuBoy's always heading there for the latest info.
Why not you?

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Hey-ya folks! Couple of OtakuBoy-Business notes to get
through today.

   Firstly, remember how all those gaming sites took off 
for Thanksgivin' while, your good old friend OtakuBoy
stayed on-call because -- AHEM -- the videogame world also
extends to Europe and (especially) Japan where *GASP* they
don't celebrate Thanksgivin'. (I don't know if they eat
turkey.)

   Well, good old friend OtakuBoy has to take a couple of
days. Thursday, the next pub date, I'll publish a smaller
MUST-CLICKS newsletter. I won't publish on Saturday. 

   Why, you ask? I am going to Grand Isle, Louisiana on 
magazine article assignment.

   But, here's some good news! Are you interested in writing
this heah newsletter? SURE YOU ARE! In fact, you'd might
even be interested in writing a WHOLE section. Imagine, the
fame that comes with being an OtakuBoy Staff Member.

   Seriously, I am interviewing for staff positions and 
want _you_ to contact me for more info! Otakuboy@bigfoot.com

   So do it! DAMN IT!

   But enough of that... on to...

-----------

Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)


   ... "Turok 2!" Oh my GOD! What happened to make all this
Turok 2 stuff appear all of the sudden? Yeah, I know it's
been released, but take a look at all this: IGN64 interviews
Dave Dienstbier, Turok 2's Project Leader. (He put muzzles
on all the dinosaurs.:I ) It's a two-parter, both links are
below. Also, IGN64 probes the innards of the game to find
out if there are any bugs. (Seems some of them are freezing
up on people.) 64 Source has been hearing that the coupons
supposed to work with the purchase of Turok 2 (and Rogue
Squadron) aren't being honored. WHY?! And 64 Source also
has their own Initial Impression of the Dino-title.

   Nintendo, can you hear me? Can you feel me near you? 
Good! Then get off yer arse and make Metroid 64, will ya?
Details about the Web-Wide petition on 64 Source. Also on
64 Source, a bit of a preview (more newsy than preview-ish)
of "Pikachu Genki Dechu," the N64 Pokemon title. 

   "California Speedin'" on such-a spring-ish daaaaaay! 
FGNOnline has the release date (March) and IGN64 has movies
of the game play.

    Answer one question: How many three-foot Italian plumb-
ers do you know who love golf? Ok, answer another: Do you
ever feel like one when you play golf? You see, 64 Source
calls "Mario Golf 64" a 'totally realistic and immersive
experience.' Wow! So, I guess this means you will know what
it means to an Italian plumber-golfer. Anyway, check out
64 Source's news/preview.

   IGN64 has a big "South Park 64" preview, so big your 
monitor's likely to explode. So watch out -- that active
matrices are especially sharp! Also on IGN64... (Are you 
beginning to see a theme in the sites today -- IGN 64, 64
Source, IGN 64. What can I say?) Also on IGN 64, new pics
of "Neon Genesis Evangelion" and a review of "Golden Nugget
64," a gambling sim. A "gambling SIM?!" Their words, not
mine.

   Ooops... Sorry, I think the pattern's going to break...
Yeah, here it is: Videogamers.com reviews "Top Gear 
Overdrive." (No relation to Bachman Turner Overdrive or
Maxium Overdrive.) 

   GameBoy Euro-Asia publishes a number of cool items -- so
many I'm overwhelmed. Sob! First, they have news of a true
collectors items. A few lucky stiffs are going to get their
very own Panasonic GameBoy Color. Second, two -- count 'em
-- two Bomberman RPGs are set to come out in Japan, 
"Bomberman Quest" and "B-Daman." Third -- we're still at
GameBoy Euro-Asia -- a report from the Phillipines on how
the GameBoy Color is doin' over there.

   And here's more from GameBoy Euro-Asia (which, if you're
a GameBoy fan, you should just poke around for awhile). In
Japan, they're buying up clear shell and hazy colored Game
Boy Colors. GameBoy E-A has the pics. And last, the guys
have picked up the latest "Zelda DX" release date, December
14. (HEY! That's Yesterday!!! (or the day before)).

   GameBoy-Nintendo-finally, FGNOnline has news that "Las
Vegas Cool Hand," "Montezuma's Return," and "Rats!" have 
all been released to GameBoy Color. FGNOnline has a tiny
bit-o'-detail on each game.


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   SegaNet wonders -- ALOUD -- why Bernie Stolar, COO of
Sega of America, in his recent essay for the new Games
Business magazine, doesn't reveal or say anything. WHAT?! 
A company head saying nothing? Nooo.. Say it ain't so. 
But SegaNet's on to Stolar. They dissect and translate the
Stolar essay.

   Dreamcast import prices are starting to come down. De-
tails on that over at National Console Support. (Inciden-
tally, I should mention that they are not taking orders
anymore. Which may be why they lowered the price. (Hey! It's
free. But you can't order it anymore. Har!)) Meanwhile,
Dreamcast continues to sell in Japan! Wow. Details at
Dreamcaster.

   If you happen to work for a big company in Japan, do not
mess up. You'll get demoted publicly. One of the Sega-o'-
Japan heads found himself demoted after Dreamcast shortages
started poppin' up. GamersRepublic and GameSpot try to sort
out what happened.

   A couple of sites report that Nintendo head Yamauchi
"slams" Sega in a recent interview. I've read it. Is it a
slam? Well, in Japan, they slam you politely, I suppose. 
Anyway, I have two stories -- FGNOnline and Gaming-Age. I
suggest Gaming-Age for the bigger, more in-depth story.

   But maybe there could be a problem with Sega and 
Dreamcasts, as Yamauchi suggests. With the shortages, Sega
isn't having a real easy time of it. I know! Let's get the
Japanese press DRUNK! Sega's sending bottles of wine.
Gamers Republic has pictures. If you work for the American
press, though, Sega wants you to be on-time. Dreamcast
watches are poppin' up in U.S. editorial offices, and 
Gaming-Age prints pics of 'em.

   So... they call it VMS. I call it the Dreamcast PDA. 
Gaming-Age and SegaNet has pics showin' how "Climax Landers"
will use the device. And speaking of "Climax Landers," 
FGNOnline knows when it's gonna land.

   Next-Generation, among others, said last week that 
"Incoming" had gotten piss-poor reviews in the Japanese
press. Well, Dreamcaster says that ain't true. Anyway, I
gots you the Next-Gen piece and the Dreamcaster piece.

   Did you know you could attend the Shenmue conference over
the Internet? It's happening on December 19 (20 in Japan).
I found the news over at Dreamcast (who got it from SegaNet
-- see how incestuous this can all be?). Now you have links
to the Dreamcast story and the actual site where you can
listen in. (Hint: Don't tell your friends or you'll never
get a stream.)

   "Maken X," Nazis. Nazis, "Maken X." Everyone's all a-
titter over the use of Nazis in the game. SegaX has a gang
buster preview, while Atlus Japan launches the official
site. Over at DreamcastIGN, a big preview of "PowerStone."
And, Dreamcast-finally, a big preview, which is more like 
a review, of "Sega Rally 2." It's over at ConsoleDomain.


PlayStation (PSX) 

   Hey. Bay-bee. You can not pass up ze new detailz on
Fee-nal Fantasee 8. IGNPSX has news of new charactairs for
you and much lovey-poo. Also, ahem, Game Informer ('We
inform games!') has some pics, too.

   Is the "Legend of Lagaia" headed toward the U.S.? Yes,
oh, god YES! And Sony America is bein' soo secretive about
it. But PSXNation found out the truth. And speaking of truth
(or false), Kingboxer's back on PSXMax with rumors out my
wahzoo! PSX2 Developer Kits out to devlopers already? Oh,
do tell. Dooooo tell.

   IGNPSX snags an informal interview with the developer
of driver. (An informal interview, in journalism, is when
you, the reporter, go to a party where the subject (develop-
er) shows up. You harang him at the punch bowl where he
spits punch in your face. You then chase him down and pro-
mise not to print stuff about his mother like last time and
he (developer) grants you a few questions. It's all very
simple, really.)

   But here's an formal interview (where you sit down and
stuff) with Kev Shaw, PR Manager (OBJECTIVE ALERT!!) of 
Eutechnyx, developers of "Max Power Racer." It's over
at Game-Interviews.com.

   Woah! A demo and movies of "Saga Frontier" and "IS
Internal Section" on the new Japanese "Chocobo's Mysterious
Dungeon" disc? Yep. FGNOnline has the details. Remember
last issue where a site claimed to have found the sequel
to "Mega Man Legends?" Well, GameFan has the full story and,
YES, it is a sequel -- er, sorta. Meanwhile, check out
Gaming-Age for screens of a really frikkin' weird game,
"Tron and the Serverbots."

   Are you a member of PlayStation Underground? Me neither.
But apparently you're going to get some nice stuff if you
are. Details at PSXNation. 

   Game Informer previews "Bass Lander." IGNPSX breaks apart
the new "Bust-A-Move 3." Videogames.com finds what could be
the game that can claim no genre, "Irritating Stick." (How-
ever, the title, all of a sudden, sounds like an STD.) 
GamersRepublic shows us that we've come a lonnnng way from
Activision's Skiing for the Atari 2600 with their preview
of "Tricky Sliders." And Game-Online previews the new multi-
generational RPG, "Dragon Valor," comin' from Nammie-co.

   Get "Apocalypse" now! Get it? Apocalypse is a game title?
Apocalypse Now is a movie title? Ha. Well, if you get it, 
then I made the joke up. If you don't, then blame Console
Domain and their view of the UK version of "Apocalypse."
And more at Console Domain: A review of the UK version of
"Actua Soccer," and the Japanese version of "Ridge Racer
Type 4."

   IGNPSX reviews "Formula 1 '98," and could it be that
gameplay has been thrown into reverse? And PSX-finally,
GameCenter reviews "Bushido Blade 2." 


Multi-format

   Tired of running out to EB for Zelda only to come home
with "Busby 3d?" Then you need Videogames.com's guide for
Videogame Bargins! Yes, you do. 

   Sega X put together a nice report on all things Sega and
arcady. They have reviews of "House of The Dead 2," "The
Groovin' Flash Beat" and "Zombie Zone." Oh, you want to see
all of these.   

Cheers, folks.

             See a cool story? Send it to me!
