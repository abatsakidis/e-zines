Hi XXXXXX:

In regards to your request...

Ok, you've been removed. Below, I've pasted in your subscription request, just in case you don't remember subscribing.

In any case, I sincerely hope you enjoyed those issues you did get.

In fact, if you have a moment, could you tell me why you're unsubscribing? Maybe I could change something that would make the issues better for you? I really am trying to help you find cool videogaming stuff. 

Thanks again for your support. 

Cheers,

Mike Whalen

P.S. I've just launched a Web site <www.otakuboy.com>. It contains much of the same information, plus a bit more. That may be more to your liking.
