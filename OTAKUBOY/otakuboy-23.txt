   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   First, d00ds, a big thank-ya to those who've agreed to
answer The OtakuBoy Online Super-d00per Questionairre. Your
answer have been very helpful. And, I'm glad to know you
guys are out there reading my incessant prattle. ;) 

   If anyone else would like to participate, the survey is
a mere 17 questions long and most of it is e-z multiple
choice. Just send a message to OtakuBoy@bigfoot.com.

   Hey, you're gonna thank me tonight. There are so many
movies to download over the next day that if I came out
with a new ish of O.O. (that's OtakuBoy Online fer you
newbies) tomorrow, you'd still be downloading. You'd curse
me. I'd get the ping o' death from my bretheren.

Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   For instance, here's a big movie on Gaming-Age. It's a 
Dreamcast promo goin' out to retailers. Hey, it's only
10 megs. (Oh, you have to have Quicktime 3.0.) But it'll
spark yer fire to trust in Dreamcast. And speaking of trust,
you have to read the interview over on Gamespot with Sega
Chief Isao Okawa. "Trust in Sega," he says. Trust. Hmmm...
it's beginnin' to sound like a beg. I hope not.

   And why could it be something close to a beg? Well, there
are still concerns over how many Dreamcasts are gonna be 
available at launch. National Console Support talks about it 
from the importer's perspective, Sega's "partner shops"
talk about it from the Japanese retailers perspective, and 
then Sega responds (Those last two are on Sega X.) It's 
beginning to look like that the only way you can get a 
Dreamcast is to bob your head into a big vat of mashed po-
tatoes! And lookie there on Digita-Ages and GameFan! News
on how to do exactly that. 

   Still, you must trust in Dreamcast. Trust in Sega. 
Reuters News Service analyzes just what Dreamcast could do
for Sega and the videogamer.

   Famitsu, that little Japanese videogaming magazine with
the can-do attitude, rates a whole buncha Dreamcast titles.
Details at Gaming-Age. Also on Gaming-Age, the pronounce-
ment, 'Virtua Fighter 3tb is just too perfect." What could
they mean and why could that be disappointing? Dreamcaster.
net runs a piece of an interview about whether "Tiberian
Sun," that piece of the Command & Conquer universe, could
appear on Dreamcast. But, hey, now you know who you have
to bug if you really, really want it.

   Goodbye Segata Sanshiro! Huh? Um, I'm not really sure
what I mean. Apparently, he's this guy who does/did 
commercial for Saturn. Could this be the final death-bell
for Saturn? Details at Gamer's Republic. 

   And finally, go on to Sega's Japanese web site. They 
have a pic of Sonic that's kinda interesting. At least to
me. Hey, it's a much quicker download than a 10 megabyte
movie. ;P


Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   Speaking of movies, here's more of 'em! Plug in yer
T1s if ya got 'em. 

   IGN64 put up some new Zelda movies yesterday. So many
Zelda movies that they've been having a little problem
with the server. So, Nth Dimension helps you out with 
copies on their sorta traffic-free server. Ah, but Nth
Dimension surprises even more with two more movies added
to their "Turok 2" collection. And speaking of Turok 2,
check out GameFan for the release date. 

   More Zelda info as we near the release date. Foist, 
there just might be a Zelda shortage. But you didn't hear
it from me. You heard it from GameSpot. Then you heard 
from Game-Online the final U.K. release date. Finally,
Nintendo interviews Miyamoto about Zelda and all kinds of
other things. 

   Here's some good news. Many sites report GameBoy Color's
comin' early! Wow. So, check out that news at GameFan, then
go read a Super Feature on everything GameBoy Color at
Console Domain.

   Videogames.com runs really good feature on All-Things-
Pokemon. Movies, Videos, Games, Videogames, Umbrellas,
Sexual Aides, etc., etc., etc.

   I'm sorry, but "Oh my God, they've killed Kenny" has
finally reached the level of cliche. Everyone says it. I
can't stand it anymore. Please. Stop. In any case, check
out all the times it's repeated in news of the South Park
release date on Nth Dimension (in the news stories), the 
movies on IGN64, and the box art on N64 Gamer. (Ok, maybe
it's not exactly anywhere on the box art.)

  Woo hoo! More pics of "Mario Party" over on NintenDojo.
It's exciting. Too exciting for your average gamer. Also
at NintenDojo, a "Spacestation Silicon Valley Guide." Help
Evo return to his ego. (This play on words worked some
hours ago, but now IT'S GARBAGE!) GameCenter reviews
"WCW/NWO Revenge."

   Pretty soon, your N64 is going to like when you yell at
it. No, it still doesn't like hitting and it most certainly
doesn't like domination. Anyway, details on what you can
say to your N64 at GameFan. Also, now that the Expansion
Pak is really comin' out, check out the new icon that's
going to appear on participating box. It's at IGN64.


PlayStation (PSX) 

   It's the PSX2 FAQ, brought to you by IGNPSX. Actually,
it's more like a FRR (Frequently Repeated Rumors). GameFan
has news of the link between MPEG-2 and PSX2. Gaming-Age
brings news/rumor of a bit of a spat between VLabs and
Sony. What could this mean for PSX2. Maybe nothing. Such
is the way with rumors.

   And yet more movies to feast on. This time it's "Final
Fantasy 8!" They're all at Gaming-Age. Also, check out the
final Japanese release date on NCSX. 

   Hey, own a PC and a PSX? Well, then you HAVE TO OWN
a Dex Drive. I'm sssserious. It's probably the coolest
thing I've ever seen. (Ponder that for a moment.) Anyway,
details over at IGNPSX. Also on IGNPSX, how is "Street
Fighter Alpha 3" gonna use PocketStation? 

   Out of thin air pops "Eliminator" from Psygnosis. IGNPSX
has the details. And Digital-Ages brings news that "Lunar:
Silver Star Story Complete" has been delayed. So, they
encourage -- nay, BEG -- you to read their Super Preview.
See what you're going to miss for a little while longer.

   Videogames.com reviews "Assault: Retribution." And,
finally: We've mentioned reviews of this game before, but
here's a review of the U.K. version of "Team Losi RC
Racing."


Multi-format

   Ok all you importers. Yeah, I'm talking to the people
who have lots of money to throw around and aren't throwin'
it MY WAY! ;) GameSpot details the upcoming release over
dere. 

   Contributor Britain P. throws a cool link our way from
Capcom Japan. They're a bunch of greeting cards with new
art from current Capcom games. (Do you know Capcom actually
produced a RADIO SHOW about their games and stuff? JEEZ!
Why can't we do cool stuff like that?)

   Let's end with a rumor. Gaming-Age lists all the things
that could come out of Square real-soon-now.

     Special thanks to SpEcIaL CoNtRiBuToR - Britain P.
             See a cool story? Send it to me!
