Hey-ya new members!

Thank your fer joinin' OtakuBoy Online from 
ConsoleCity.com, UseNet, or where ever you've 
come from!

Briefly, here's what I do. I'm a rabid videogame
fan; can't get enough of 'em. So, I surf all the
good console videogaming sites everyday looking
for the best news, reviews, features, previews,
etc. I collect all the links to relevant content,
then I publish 'em to you three-days a week! I try
to help you keep up with the latest, best videogaming
news from all the sites.

Enough ado! Here's the lastest ish!

Welcome aboard!

Cheers,

OtakuBoy!
