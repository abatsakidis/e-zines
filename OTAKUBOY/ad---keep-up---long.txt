Who da fock can keep up with what's publishing on the console videogaming sites?

Every weekday they put up new reviews, news, features, etc., etc., etc. A lot of it is good stuff, you know -- stuff you want to see.

But there's just so much of it. You gotta surf the sites EVERY DAY to keep up, or you miss a lotta shit. Even if you manage to keep up with a couple of sites, you miss stuff on other sites -- good features and reviews. And this says nuthin' about the sites you might not know about.

Well, OtakuBoy Online newsletter surfs the console gaming sites five-days-a-week for the latest console news, reviews, previews, features, and all those lovely etceteras about the N64, Saturn, Dreamcast, PSX, and others.

Then, OtakuBoy publishes a convenient list o' links and narrative, pointing out the best-o'-the-best.

It's de-lightful. It's de-loverly. It's de-Otakuboy Online. And it's
de-free.
