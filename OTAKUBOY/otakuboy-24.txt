   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Hey guys! I am soooo excited today. Fer a couple-a rea-
sons. 

   First, the survery results keep rollin' in. I'm getting
so much cool feedback from you guys. Thanks a bunch. Now
what we need are more subscribers! Tell your friends. Tell
your enemies. The magic e-mail: Otakuboy@bigfoot.com.

   Secondly, this is most definitely Zelda weekend. The 
buzz is everywhere! Jeez! I want to buy 90 N64s and run
Zelda 64 all the time. I don't care about any other games.
My nerves are dancing at the thought of a Zelda on my TV
screen. I AM CUKCOO FOR ZELDA! HAahahahahHAHAHAHAH

-----------

Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   (For those of you who've been in a cave (and not the
Zelda-variety type cave), Zelda hits the streets in 2 days.
November 23.) I can't stand the hype anymore. Can you?

   And here's the grandest example of videogaming hype.
GameSpot is running a "Zelda Watch," publishing little news
notes everytime they get a report that an area has received
Zelda. So far, they've heard from Japan, Canada, and else-
where. I have three links to a few reports. Check the main
GameSpot news page periodically for more updates.

   Here's more hype from GameSpot and their family...
Sister site Videogames.com runs a huge Zelda preview, 
with much taken from EGM's recent romp into the new game.
(The romp will also appear in an upcoming EGM. EGM is part
of the Videogames.com, GameSpot, Ziff-Davis family. No one's
stealing here.) GameSpot also reports that rentals in Japan,
which are normally prohibited by videogame companies, are
now A-OK for Zelda 64. Feel the hype all the way down into
your bones...

   If you can't get enough of Zelda... For instance, if you
buy the game and your hands start shaking whenever you turn
off your N64, then maybe you want to consider the new crop
of Zelda merchandise. OBSCURE QUOTE ALERT: Use da Schwartz. 
Check out National Console Support for the details.

   But wait? You don't have an N64? Oh no. I'm truly sorry.
Well, maybe you're in luck. Apparently at least one retailer
hopes to cash in on Zelda weekend. Check out the info 
about a Super Deal at Gaming-Age. 

   And finally, what's Miyamoto gonna do next? Perhaps go
to Disney World? Perhaps star in a porn video? Find out at
GameSpot. 

   I guess it's also GameBoy Color weekend, although you'd
never know it. The machine is on its way to your store. 
Check out Gaming-Age for dates. Also, IGN64 profiles the 
upcoming 64GB which is going to hook your new GameBoy Color
up to your N64. For what purpose? Think about moving PokeMon
monsters between the machines. Wow!

   Speaking of Pokemon, GameSpot takes time off from their 
Zelda Watch to tell you about "Pokemon Cards," a coming-
soon title for ColorGB. Gaming-Age brings news of the
Official Pokemon Tournament out in California. I say: Go
out there so you can kick that smug smile offa Ash's face.
Do it! Do it! (Sorry, I don't know where that hidden anger 
came from (which confirms the "hidden-ness").)

   Superman accidentally received a Kryptonite enema at the
end of the week. Now, let's analyze this joke. Kryptonite
makes Supes weak, right? Therefore, if he received a
K-enema, he'd likely slow down a bit. So, what I'm really
telling you is that Superman has been delayed -- again. 
Details at Digital-Ages. (Boy, am I so NOT a comedian.)

   The Nth Dimension takes a pre-look at "Fox Sports College
Hoops '99." The ads are runnin' all over Fox, if you wanna
see it in action. New "Nightmare Creatures" movies over
on IGN64. Also on IGN64, a tiny preview of "Rampage: 
Universal Tour." And here's a kinda neat feature: Are you
chompin' at the bit to see all the latest box art? Then
go on over to NintenDojo's box art section. It's magically
box-licious.

   Here are some re-run items -- at least I think so. 
Digital-Ages reviews "Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon."
Nintendo Underground interviews Iguana about "South Park."

   Finally, here's what I call a Collecting Alert. Kentucky
Fried Chicken (KFC (PFK for you French folks)) is giving
away stuffed Pokemon. They're gonna be collector's items.
No doubt. It's always those damn limited edition fast-food
items that you didn't get (i.e. Star Wars glasses) that
bring money at some point. (Useless fact No. 1 : That's a
GameBoy Pocket the Colonel's playin' in the commercials.)
Check out Kentucky Fried Chicken's site for info. (I can't
believe I included this. ;)


PlayStation (PSX) 

   Continuing the PSX2 rumor mill: Console Domain runs what
they call "hot-news" on PSX2. It includes a bit of spe-
culation... so much I don't really know if the story is
announcement, fact, rumor or some giant mish-mash of all
three. Still, it is worth a click or two for all you PSX2
fanatics out there. ;)

   PSXMax opens a new section for those lucky stiffs with a
DexDrive. Don't know what the DexDrive is? It's basically a
bridge between your PSX and your PC that'll allow you to 
transfer saved files and all kinds of stuff. Now, PSXMax
makes a big public saved-game file swap. (Who wants to
bet on when we'll see some kind of pirating technology
based on DexDrive. Any takers? Anyone?)

   For those of you that don't know, Superman's gonna be
an N64 title AND a PSX title. And in case you didn't read
my note up in the N64 section, it's been delayed. (I wrote
a lame joke in the N64 section about Kryptonite enemas if
you wanna go see it up there. ;) Meanwhile, Gaming-Age re-
ports that "Civilizations 2" is comin' to PSX. Cool, huh?

   What is the fascination between videogaming and food?
Huh? First Dreamcast and mashed potatoes. Now Crash 
Bandicoot and stuffed crust pizzas? You've probably seen 
the ads already (where Crash bullhorns a family in a Pizza
Hut restaurant). Well, GameFan has the story behind the
marketing plan... and there's more to it than a screaming
Crash. Wanna win a PSX?

   Bounce 3.0 came out. Sorry. I mean to say that "Tomb
Raider 3" hits shelves this weekend. Wanna know the basics?
Read the preview at PSXMax. Wanna know a verdict on whether
it's any good (Yes, it is), then read the review at IGNPSX.
Also at IGNPSX, previews of Namco's "Ace Combat 3," and 
"Suikoden 2," now with new and improved Battle System! 

   Hey, I wrote a story for Digital Home Entertainment
magazine recently about arcade game emulators. I'm sorry,
but I LIKE classic games. So, I cringe at the thought of
"Pac-Man 3D." If you don't, then check out the preview
at PSXMax. Digital-Ages takes a look at "Sports Car GT." 
Warning: Bad pun alert. (You'll see what I mean.) IGNPSX
runs a terribly short, nearly what's-the-point story on
a "secret" fighter to come out of 989 Studios, "Okuden."
Can "Shadow Madness" smooth your RPG cravings? PSXMax
takes a pre-look at it.

   Yay! A nice "Brave Fencer Musashi" review. On GameFan.
Videogamers.com takes a long look at "Monster Rancher," which
is kinda like Sony's answer to Tamagotchi. (It looks really,
really neat, folks. Check out the way you make your
characters!) Gaming-Age looks at "TOCA Touring Car 
Championship." They say it deserves more coverage. Perhaps
it'll start people yelling, "TO-CA TO-CA TO-CA," ala Animal
House.

   Finally, if you've been waiting for the absolute best
price on a PSX. Maybe today's your lucky day. Gaming-Age
has details. And while you're at it, check out IGNPSX for
a little more detail on possible future PSX price drops. 
(There are quite a few other rumors here, too.) And make
sure you get your hands on Target Stores' videogame coupon
book. Details also at IGNPSX.


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   Not much play on this at other sites: Did you know that
a Dreamcast showed up at Comdex this week? Dreamcaster
has pictures and they're kinda worth the click. Nothing new
to see, but maybe pics of the first Dreamcast shown in 
the states? Also, if you're keeping a running tab on every
Dreamcast game that could come out for the system, then
you don't want to miss Hype.se's news about "Real Sound." 

   On the heels of the news that "Virtua Fighter 3: Team
Battle" is 'too arcade perfect,' Gaming-Age runs a very
nice side-by-side comparison of both games. Turns out there
might be a few more differences than Sega's willing to let
on. 

   Lots of news/analysis/speculation today on Sega's finan-
cial future. Really dry stuff, to be sure. Most financial
stuff is, if I do say so myself. Dreamcaster more or less
re-reports the Reuters article I ran a link to last ish, 
but they run down the info quickly. Nekkei Weekly brings
news of one way Sega plans to make money on Dreamcast. (Can
you say BONDS?) And, finally, Sega X pulls apart recent in-
terviews to show you Sega's Dreamcast sales "forecast." 
Could it be more proper to say "wishful thinking?" I hope
not. :(

   Really cool/nifty stuff on Sega Japan's Web site -- new
pics of "Buggy Heat" and "PenPen Tricelon," plus the planes
from "Aero Dancing." (By the way, in case you're wondering
how in the world I determined what the game was on the 
PenPen Tricelon page, I checked out the URL. Sometimes, it's
the only palce to find translated words. ;) Sega X has pics
of "Space Griffon." They're a bit grainy, but they're good
enough.

   Are you in Japan? Are you ANYWHERE near a Sega Joyopolis
Center? Then what in the heck are you doing reading this?
Get thee over there to play a Dreamcast! Details at 
Dreamcaster. However, if you're not in Japan and really,
really, really, really, (Really!) want a Dreamcast, then
you can finally get an idea of what you're going to pay
for one. Details at Sega X. 

  Cheers, folks. OtakuBoy is off to play more Duke Nukem:
Time To Kill.

             See a cool story? Send it to me!
