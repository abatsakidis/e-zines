   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

   Saturday/Sunday/Early Monday - The BORING day for Video-
game content based entertainment. So many things you want to
see, so many things you can't see. Ah, but NEWS broke Sunday
evening all the way from Japan that set many a gamer's hair
a spinning! (Can hair spin?) Below is the link to the BEST
story!

                 P l a y S t a t i o n (PSX)

-- !!!!!!!!! SONY PLAYSTATION 2 !!!!!!!!!!
   The Monday morning edition of the Nihon Keizai Shimbun
learned the PlayStation 2 is comin'. Nuff said. Go read.

-- Monster Rancher 2 - Preview/Review/News/uh..?
   The truth is, I don't know what to classify this as. May-
be it's a review. It's a look at MONSTER RANCHER 2 (MONSTER
FARM in good ole Japan) and what's different between the old
and the new. Then again, maybe it's a PREVIEW. Then again,
maybe it's news cause it announces the release.

-- T'ai Fu - Preview
   Every once in awhile, this game shows its wacky head then
quietly slips back into silence while we, a fighter crazed
videogaming nation, hopes that one day the game will finally
show up in stores. WELL WAIT NO mOrE! It looks like MARCH is
the month. And, according to GameFAN, T'AI FU has gotten a
major face lift. (Be sure to check out the movie, too!)

-- Takeshi Tatsuka, Capcom R&D - Mini-Interview
   Don't give the credit to Dimension-S! The guys spied this
full-on interview in the April '99 issue of Gamer's Republic.
But where you CAN credit Dimension-S, is they pulled out the
juciest bits. So... WOW! You don't have to even buy the mag!
-- http://www.dimension-s.com/sega-news/article.cfm?news_id=1415


-- Bernie Stolar, Sega exec - Mini-Interview
   This time, Dimension-S spots a cool interview in Games
Business, a trade magazine for videogame retailers. In the
interview, Stolar talks about how they're preparing retails
for the upcoming Dreamcast launch. And Dimension-S sums it
all up! VIVA LA DIMENSION-S!

-- Snowboarding SUPREME! - News/Pics
   WOW! Now this looks nice! Snowboarding down a powdery
slope, your butt in mid-air, etc. There's no "But what is
it" accompanying this update. This is a real snowboarding
game. Check out the PICS! (This completely senseless prattle
brought to you by Otakuboy.)

-- Power Stone, da Web Site - News/Site
   Lookie here! Over on Game Informer is a news item about a
new POWER STONE web site. Of course it's in Japanese, so
unless you happen to know Japanese you're not going to be
able to get around all that much. But, hey, the artwork is
pretty cool!

um, this comes from Game-Online ... and you need the Real

   Now this is neat. Right on the heels of the announcement
that GAME & WATCH GALLERY 3 will makes its way to GBC, comes
these sets of pics on GameBoy Euro-Asia. There's more like
the ones over to the left -- the old and the new. COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!

-- Pokemon GameBoy super-fresh! - News
   Seems like the special-edition Pokemon GameBoy went like
gangbusters in a Japanese Pokemon Center. (Isn't that COOL?
A whole store devoted to ONE FRIKKIN Videogame. Imagine! The
RESIDENT EVIL center? Or the MARIO BROS. center.) Check out
the eyewitness Pokemon GameBoy report on GameBoy Euro-Asia.
