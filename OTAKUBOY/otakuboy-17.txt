   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

Hi guys!

   This be a brief version of OB. Hope you read my 
"important message" fer the reasons why.

   Still, I couldn't stay away! I couldn't! Damn my health.

   So, here comes a briefer version of OtakuBoy... a series
of MUST CLICKS!

-----------
Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   Holy FOCK! Sega X takes the wraps off a lotta stuff.
First, ya gotta check out the Hong Kong packaging for 
Dreamcast. Why? ... Why not? Then check out new movies for
the Dreamcast Bootup, "Geist Force," "Blue Stinger," 
and "D2!" Dreamcast coverage here just rules, rules.


Nintendo 64 (N64)

   Hey, remember last week when we saw pics from the up-
coming "Mario Party?" (Sing it! "Goin' to a Mario Party.
Can't please everyone, but ya gotta please yerself.") 
Anyway, ole Videogames.com has a game synopsis. Meanwhile,
Link Awakens over on Color GameBoy. Videogames.com has the
scoop. 


PlayStation (PSX) 

   Oh, ya gotta check out the review of "MediEvil" over on
Videogames.com. Hey, if you win the game, you're dead. If
you don't, you're dead. Sorry to spoil it for ya. And this
last little bit, courtesy of PSXMax: turns out a certain
little ad campaign ain't doin' to well in the U.K. Find
out what the chainsaw buzz is about.


   See ya, folks. Updates to follow.
