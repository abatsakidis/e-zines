   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Woah! A super, super short ish today. I think this is
partly my fault, folks. I grabbed so many links on Saturday
that there were very few to grab today. Plus, you have to
add in the fact that many sites are re-running Zelda pre-
views. Today's the big Z-Day, you know.

-----------

Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   And of course, as I mentioned, the biggest stuff goin' on
today is -- yep, Zelda-mania. "Where is it," people are 
screaming. 

   Three sites, are running Zelda watches. Like tracking
Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, these sites list where the
little guy has shown up. The Nth Dimension is running a
big map of North America. (So far, only one dot lights up.)
GameSpot lists cities who've confirmed shipment. (I presume
stores have confirmed this. Could city governments be 
calling GameSpot?) And, finally, 64 Source list what they've
seen with their own eyes, heared with their own ears, and
received in their own e-mail boxes.

   In Zelda World Watch -- hey, I just coined that, ain't it
cool :I -- The Nth Dimesion has a graphic of the Japanese 
Zelda box art. (Why can't we have art like that?!) Plus,
Game-Online cofirms Zelda's UK release date. Jeez! Nearly
a month away, U.K. guys. But just wait, 256 MBit sweetness
will be your way, no doubt.

   Speaking of 256 MBit titles, Magic Box, the site that
gives your scrolling finger a work out, runs new pics from
"Mario Party," the Other-256MBit-Title. (Scroll  the page
til you reach the November 19 news.) 

   Nth Dimension found two more "Turok 2" movies, this time
of the fourth level. Links to Nth Dimensions server below.
Plus, IGN64 runs a really big Turok 2 preview, with links
to bunches of movies (most of them are the same) and pics.
Maybe if you haven't gotten to play the demo at your local
store you can ease your Turok 2 pangs. 

   NintenDojo goes out on a limb! How? They say that the
Japanese "Nintendo All-Star Dai-Rantou Smash Brothers"
game will simply become "Smash Brothers" in the U.S. Plus,
they run a preview of mostly pics. Pikachu never looked
more angry at Mario. Check out NintenDoJo.

   According to Game-Online, yer gonna be able try out some
"Wicked Surfing" in "Caesar's Palace" on Color GameBoy. 
Well, not exactly. but InterPlay has some plans for the 
little color portable with the will-do attitude.

   And finally, Nintendo zealots, you've got a friend at
the Detroit Free-Press. You do. You do.


PlayStation (PSX) 

   "Metal Gear Solid" is a winner in the U.S. Right? Right?
Of course it is. Was there ever any doubt. But, according
to a report on Game-Online, the U.K. is not so much of a 
shoo in. Check it out.

   More from Magic Box. Scrolling fingers at the ready!
First, check out new characters and a little bit of info
about the World Tour Mode in "Street Fighter Zero 3." Scroll
down til you see the first set of screen shots on the page.
Also, two new characters will appear in "Final Fantasy 8." 
Scroll down to just below the 'Giga Wing' pics. Magic Box
is an exceptional site for rumors and news. But this whole
stream-of-consciousness layout stuff's gotta stop! ;)

   Console Domain went PSX-Review crazy. Perhaps it's a
bit of a Zelda protest. "Hell nay! We won't play ZelDAY." 
Hmmm... Well, check out the reviews for "Test Drive Offroad
2," "Duke Nukem: Time To Kill," and "Oh no! More Lemmings."
Tell me if that Lemmings doesn't look like the original 
Amiga version.


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   Finally! Some news about what importin' a Dreamcast is
gonna set you back. It ain't pretty. But who needs a home
and groceries! Who needs indoor plumbing! Who says kids
need vaccinations! (Rubella turns you into a MAN!) Anyway,
damage details at National Console Support.

   And last but not least, news from three sites about a
possible "Jeff Gordon Racing." I like the Sega X story the
best. (Segadreamcast.net.)   

 Boy, I wasn't kiddin! OtakuBoy OUT!

             See a cool story? Send it to me!
