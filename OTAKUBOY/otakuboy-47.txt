=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   The phrase for the day is: "The World is Not Enough." Why
is it not enough? I cannot say. But someone can. Agent 007!

-----------

Nintendo 64 (N64)

   Yeah, boyeee. James "Pussy Galore" Bond is comin' back
to the movie world AND videogame world! But -- oh my -- it
looks like the new game won't be for the N64! Wait WAIT! 
Don't start a-cryin'. This "sequel" to Goldeneye 64 will
be for Nintendo's NEXT MACHINE?!?! Details on "The World is
Not Enough" at Game-Online!

   Ugh. I just had to put that bit o' news at the top. But
it was hard choice!, you know. RareNet, that super-cool site
for all things Rare ("Rare," as in developer-Rare) posted a
special on their site about everything comin' in 1999. That
shoulda been at the top. But who can ignore 007? Anyhoo,
RareNet tells you what to expect from them in 1999. Check
it out.

   Can you believe the number of times you see this on
Usenet? "Can anyone recommend what RPGs to buy for the
Nintendo 64?" Jeez. Well, folks, here's a FAQ, prepared by
the super cool people at 64 Source. 

   HaHA! Codes are fun. Codes are nice. Codes are cool when
you want a vice! Hmmm... Anyhoo... it's been said that you
can't do multiplayer co-operative play in "Turok 2!"
BALDERDASH, yells Nintendo Underground. And right on the
home page is a big, long code that proves it.

   Ah, the Nintendo Expansion Pak. Never before has such a
device inspired ogasmic bliss and have nothing to do with
vibration. What could I mean? Well, I really don't know. 
But I'm getting a little hot at what I see on IGN64 about
how Blizzard's "StarCraft" and Atari Games' "Gauntlet 
Legends" are gonna use the PAK. 

   Don't fret over the "WinBack" delay. Not when you can 
head on over to GA-Source for super new pics. They call
them "exclusives!" Speaking of exclusives, looks like Fatboy
Slim is gonna do the sound for "Roll Cage." A buncha sites
say this is a good thing, so I include it here in case you
think so.

   Couple-a DD items for you. Follow the bouncing ball! 64
Source declared the 64DD dead a couple of days ago when 
God, rock-hard-abs Miyamoto implied that the device would
not appear -- or maybe we were all reading into his
comments a bit too much. Well, 64 Source now says that DD
MUST be on because a game that started to be developed for
it, "Kyojin no Doshin," is STILL ON! Details at 64 Source.
And the second bit o' DD News? The DDexDrive is comin'!
DDetails at IGN64.

   AAAAAAAH, you Danes! You're soo lucky. You're the first
ones in the world who're gonna get their N64s packed with
games like Mario 64! I wish that would-a happened for me
SNIFF! 64 Source has this news and I've also included the
link in the 64 Source story to a picture of the so-called
"MarioPak!"

   IGN64 reviews "BattleTanx," and they say it's a quite
the game. Yes, it is. And Nintendojo says if you like pure
shooting games, you're bound to loooooove "Star Soldier:
Vanishing Earth." I don't know... looks kinds weird to me.
Check out Nintendojo's review.


GameBoy Color (GBC)

   What would you do if you could, all of a sudden, hook up
four GameBoys to your N64? How much would you pay? $100?
$200? But, wait. What if I included a set of steak knives!
NOW how much would you pay? Er... got carried away. 64 
Source pulls off the wraps and shows you "DT," a device 
that will allow GameBoys to be used in N64 games. Steak
knives not included.

   Both 64 Source and GameBoy Euro-Asia carry the news that
Dragon Quest is comin' to GameBoy really soon. The 64 
Source story covers a bit more about the developer while 
the GameBoy Euro-Asia story is pared down to the basics.

   Heh. First the Danes were lucky. Now the Japanese are
lucky. Why? Cause there's gonna be a couple a-special 
versions of GameBoy Color. Cool! Check out the pics at
GameBoy Euro-Asia. Also at GameBoy Euro-Asia, pretty darn
decent "artist's renderings" of what the upcoming rumblin',
vibratin' GameBoy "Pokemon Pinball" cart is gonna look like.


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   YES! YES! Infogrames' PC game "Outcast" will come to 
Dreamcast. Ok? Are you happy? Leave me alone! *sob*

   Ahem. Magic Box has more info on the "Powerstone" 
fighter. Check this out -- there will be NO guarding moves.
You can run away, though. Heheheheh. Also on Magic Box, a
whole list of the games that are gonna be compatible with
the upcoming PuruPuru Pak, Dreamcast's Rumbling, Dual-Shock-
ing PAK. 

   Well. Well. Well. Looks like there's a release date for
"Mahjong." So says Sega-Otaku. Couldn't find much informa-
tion on it. Even Sega-Otaku said it was an odd title.

   Sonic looks better in VGA! That's Very Glitzy Angora. 
Yes, just like Ed Wood, he looks good in Angora sweaters.
Wait, I'm getting a call. Hello? VGA is what? Computer
monitor hook-up for Dreamcast? That's what they meant by
Sonic looking better in VGA? OH! Well, who said? 
Katana-Edge. Oh, ok. G'bye.

   Speaking of looking better. YOU look better in Dreamcast
clothing. This news also on Katana-Edge.


PlayStation (PSX) 

   I had a problem tonight. No, this wasn't one of my nor-
mal problems. This one was special. I go to FGNOnline, 
right? And I see that "Unreal" is comin' to PSX! And I'm
like excited, right? And I'm like unable to see straight
beceause I'm really really excited!

  Then I'm like really really let down. Cause IGNPSX says
it ain't true. What's this about the same news organization
contradicting itself? Perhaps it's the same reporter with a
split personality. "Unreal is comin' out!" "SHUT UP! No it
isn't."

   But then I'm like really really excited again! After all
the WCWs, NWOs, and WWFs to come out, here comes word from
Gaming-Age that an ECW title is ON THE WAY! With Rob Van
Dam, Buh Bug Ray Dudley, Taz and more! YOINKS! Details
over on Gaming-Age.

   IGNPSX has an interview with Activision about the trials
and tribulations of translating RPGs -- or specifically
"Gurdian's Crusade!" And speaking of Activision, all of the
sites were a-titter over the deal that Activision will 
start distributing Psygnosis' stuff. Want the news? Get it
at PSXNation.

   "Tiger Woods" is a good game. Really. So good that E.A.
wants you to take your copy, put it in an envelope, and 
ship it back to E.A. What's the problem? Well, the game is
fine. It's just that somebody put -- er -- something besides
the game on the CD. Gaming-Age has the recall notice. Game
Informer tells you just a teensy bit about what's on the
disc.

   COOL! PSXMax has the Ridge Racer commercial direct from
Japan! Now it's on your screen. And you're playing it over
and over and over and over and over...

   Speaking of things playing over -- Gamers Republic has
a news/preview bit about the sequel to "Monster Farm 2."
Sure, you know this one. That's the weird game that allows
you to make monsters with audio CDs. Just plug 'em in, 
play, and you get a wacky monster. Well, there's a lot 
different in this upcoming sequel and Gamers Republic
details it all.

   Magic Box has new info on "Bust-A-Move 2." "How could it
be worth MY time," you scream at your monitor? (Not so loud.
Its self-esteem bruises easily.) Well, how about the game's
real title and some info on the characters?

   After that scintillating news about "Virtual Pool 64" in
the last issue, I know you're going to want to find out 
about "Jimmy White's Cueball 2." Was there a 1?

   "INVASION FROM BEYONNNNNNND!" How is it? IGNPSX reviews.
Then, checkout the new pics of "Chocobo Racing." It's on
IGNPSX, too. 

   GameFan reviews the Japanese "Tales of Phantasia." IGN
PSX previews "Star Axiom," the upcoming NAMCO shooter. The
story is more about the new pics they have. But it's cool.
Meanwhile, Next-Generation takes a look at the "Connectix
PSX Emulator for Macintosh." Does it live up to the hype?
And, PSX-finally -- This. Is. The. Review. Of. Jeopardy.
And. This. Really. Sucks. Says. GameCenter.


Multi-format & Misc

   An editorial on Console Domain looks at what we can
expect from sports games in 1999 and 2000. It's cool --
a look at how sports games have progressed in play, AI,
sound, etc., and where we could be goin'.

   Remember the story last week that Sony is gonna distri-
bute Bandai's WonderSwan porto-game system? Well, that's
all fine and everything. But what about GAMES, man? GAMES!
Well, Sony's gonna help out with those, too. IGNPSX has
the details.

   And more toys: This time it's everyone's favorite
lizard -- GEX! GameInformer has the info.


Site Announcement

   Hey! Someone sent in word of this site. It's run by an
Adrian Mules. He's created a "Visual Guide to Video Game
History." At first, I thought, "Yeah, yeah." But you know
what? It's really, really cool. This guy takes screen shots
of old and current games and then diagrams for you how the
different genres have evolved over time. It's really neat.

Cheers, folks.

       See a cool story? cool site? Send it to me!
