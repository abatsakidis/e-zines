   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Unlike so many sites out there, folksies, we'll be a-pub-
lishin' on Friday! Why? Well, what else ya gonna do this 
weekend? You're not going shopping, are you? That's kind of
like playing in traffic. ;)

-----------

Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   So why not stay in and play Zelda? That's what a lotta 
gamers are doing. Or, if you don't have it, you can read
about it on every single videogame site out there. 

   Oh, the Zeldas you have known. IGN64 recaps every single
Zelda ever to come out of Miyamoto's pum'kin head. Gaming-
Age looks at a day in the life of Zelda and EB and, OW!!!
Zelda has bugs? IGN64 tells you how to avoid them. (Ugh.
A console game with a bug is not a fun thing.) IGN64 also
runs down the differences between Zelda Gold and Zelda
Standard, and Gaming-Age has the story behind the KromeFX
Zelda Gold box. 

   The 4mb Expansion Pak debuted the other day. The second
story down on today's FGNOnline has a bit of info about it.
IGN64 reveals something special when the UK version "Buck
Bumble" appears. Seems like there's gonna be a bit of a
rumblin' pak when you turn it on. 

   Got an itch for financial info about Nintendo? They
released sales figures today, and all I gotta say is, "Holy
profits, GameBoy." Details at the FGNOnline -- third story
down.

   "South Park 64" gets previewed over at Gaming-Age. IGN64
previews the "Turok 2" multiplayer mode and Videogames.com
runs a Super Preview of the whole big mega-title. The 
Videogames.com preview is pretty comprehensive, and worth
the click if you haven't gotten enough of a Turok-2-Preview
fix.

   And Nintendo-64-finally, check out "Loony Toons: Space
Race." It's a preview on IGN64. (Lotsa good stuff there 
today.)


PlayStation (PSX) 

   And I lead, and lead, and lead, with more news about PSX2
and what it's gonna be. Gamespot catches a rumor of yet-
another-name for the system. "Playbase?" Sounds terrible to
me. Finally, some sites report that we won't see real PSX2
news until February. Oh jeez. When will it really come?
That news is best sought at IGNPSX.

   Gaming-Age and GameFan run stories about "ShockHammer,"
the new pad from Thrustmaster. I include the GameFan link
more as a way to get a couple of perspectives, but Gaming-
Age's piece is real nice and runs a picture. (You tell me
if this puppy looks like Dreamcast's controller.)

   Lots of, what I call, "Here comes" on the sites today.
Follow me. Here comes "R-Type." (FGNOnline - 10th story
down) Here comes "Rugrats." (Gaming-Age) Here comes 
"Sk8ing." (IGNPSX) Here comes "Knockout Kings." 
(Gamecenter) And, finally, here comes "Bust-A-Groove."
(FGNOnline - 13th story down)

   Gamecenter reviews "Pool Huster." I have a special fond-
ness for these type of games. No matter how hard they try,
these games just doesn't capture the pool experience. ;) 
Hype.se reviews "Formula 1 '98."

   Wanna buy a PSX for under a hundred bux? IGNPSX runs a
list of the stores offering deals this shopping weekend.


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   On MSNBC, Sega says they're going to kick ass and take
names. Believe 'em? Read the article and see how ya feel.
By the way, the piece contains a really nice bit about
Sega's company history and its history in the videogame
console wars. 

   Project Berkeley will appear with "Virtua Fighter 3tb" on
a demo disc. Nothing playable mind you, but Game-Online 
details what you will see. And speaking of VF3tb, all of a
sudden there's confusion about who is actually developing
the game. Is it AM2? Or someone else? Gamespot tries to 
clear it up.

   Gamers Republic is occasionally updating a nice feature
with pics of gamers as they experience Dreamcast. And one
thing to come out of the experiencing -- at least according
to Game-Online -- is that Japanese gamers just don't get 
"Pen Pen Tricelon." 

   National Console Support updates the trials and tribu-
lations of trying to be a Dreamcast import retailer. It's 
not a pretty picture; I have to warn you. And speaking of
import-things, Sega X tells you about the "Dreamcast CD,"
which has music tracks from commercials and whatnot. Also
at Sega X, the Dreamcast coupon. What is it? I'm not quite
sure. ;)

   "Dream Passport," the thing that's going to hook your
Dreamcast up to the online world, was officially unveiled
a day or so ago. Dreamcaster.net runs a press release that
details its innards. Also, on Dreamcast, a news item about
"Whiplash 2," coming to Dreamcast. (I gotta tell you,
though, that's ALL this story says. Nothing more.)

   Gamecenter picks up the story about Dreamcast and Comdex
that I told you about last Saturday. It's the second story
down in a feature about new gaming technologies.

   Remember the Dreamcast title "Virtual On?" Neither do I.
Well, apparently the name has changed (to protect the inno-
cent - ha ha) to "Frame Gride" and Canada Wired has a pre-
view. (Watch out though! Last time I surfed the page, none
of the graphics worked.) Lastly, Sega X previews "Magic
Sword X" and "Marionette Handler," simply two new Dreamcast
titles to come down the pipe.

   And here's one last Sega item to tickle your fancy, or
to frustrate you, depending on your opinion. Me? I'd like
to have these Sega World centers here in America. Check out
where Japanese gamers can play on Sega of Japan's Web site.


Multi-format

   The Earthworm Jims crawl in. The Earthwoms Jims crawl
out. In your console and out your pad. Developer Take 2
gets a crack at "Earthworm Jim 3D." Details on GameWEEK.

   It's Christmas, and lotsa company are goin' action fi-
gures crazy! Jeez. 6th story down on FGNOnline brings news
of new "Tomb Raider" figures. Gaming-Age reports on several
different figures to make it to the shelves. Finally, 
GameSpot has news of new figures based on "Metal Gear 
Solid." Cool.

   Finally, FGNOnline spied what could be a bit of CGI for
the upcoming Final Fantasy movie. Below, check out the link
to the FGN story and the link to Square's site.

   Happy Thanksgiving. 

             See a cool story? Send it to me!
