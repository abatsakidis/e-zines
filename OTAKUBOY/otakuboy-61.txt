   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   OTAKUBOY IS DARN TIRED, DAMMIT! I tell ya. Surfing all 
these sites and publishing the Web sites and sending out
newsletters is killin' me. KILLIN'! I'm gonna have to step
back a bit and see how to streamline everything without 
compromising on giving you guys good links. 

   Anyhoo, lots of nifty stuff tonight. Check out the 
FINAL FANTASY stuff. It still keeps on a-rollin. I really
like the launch report on RETokyo.

-----------

                 P l a y S t a t i o n (PSX)

-- Final Fantasy VII Launch Report - Feature
   This is a pretty neat report from the streets of Tokyo.
What was it like outside of Tokyo's game shops? BUSIER
THAN ZELDA! BUSIER THAN DREAMCAST! BUSIER THAN ANYTHING.
Word is that God appeared a couple of blocks away, but no
one moved! Also, check out the coverage of FINAL FANTASY
VIII ads around town!

-- Silent Hill FAQ - Feature 
   JEEZ! This game barely been released to previewers and
ALREADY here's a big, super FAQ with ASCII level maps and
everything. Beat the game before you even play it!
-- http://www.playstationfan.com/shfaq.txt


-- G Police: Weapons of Justice - Preview
   Yet another preview of G POLICE: WEAPONS OF JUSTICE. But
this time, our reviewer notes something disturbing about the
controls. Could they be dumbing it down? GOOD! I mean, jeez.
I'm afraid of the PSX2 controller! I think it's going to
have 101 buttons. That's what I've heard! (I'm kidding.)

-- Syphon Filter - Review 
   These reviews are going to start comin' in fast a furious
and while I won't carry ALL of them, I think these are espe-
cially good. Gaming-Age's takes you through the first
mission, almost in a walkthrough style. It really gives you
an idea about the action in the game. It's good. Read. Blub.
The IGNPSX one below is better if you want a big list of the
weapons on the game. The Next-Generation Online review,
focuses more on the game's pace and whether anything inter-
rupts it. The PlayStationFan review? Written by a gamer for
gamers. Lotsa of slang and quick looks at different game
aspects.

             What are people saying about the
              Multiverser role playing game?

    "The density of information is astounding--there
   is a lot of 'meat' to this, and very little fluff."
                 --I.R.H., California 


         This is the game that makes good use of
        all the crap that you bought in the past.

-- The Games of 4MB - Feature
   Let's face it. Yes, turn around a face it. Thank you. The
4MB Expansion PAK for the N64 is cool, right? 640x480 high-
resolution mode just kicks TOCK! Well, IGN64 produces a big
list of all the upcoming games to use the PAK and what
they'll use the PAK for. It's quite comprehensive.

-- Killer Instinct comin' back?!?!?! - Rumor
   Kingboxer, who usually does rumors for PSXMax, sent one
over to Nth Dimension last week. (They've been down.) Turns
out ole Rare may be considering a new version of KILLER
INSTINCT!! HOOFAH!

-- Rampage: Universal Tour - Preview
   WHAT?!?!! No diagonal punch? How the heck do they expect
us to play this game? Oh.. special moves, I see. I see. Any-
way, GameFAN takes a look at this upcoming game. Get this,
you're going to be able to rampage on Halley's Comet?
Hmmmm.... (I wonder how many people are still familiar with
this series? Let alone the FIRST arcade game?) Also, below,
yet another GameFAN movie!

-- More info on Duke Nukem Color GameBOY - News
   This article has a bit more to say about DUKE NUKEM for
the Color GameBOY. A little about how many levels, for one. 
Still no words on whether it'll be third-person, first-per-
son, or platform. Perhaps the game company doesn't want to
disappoint before the game comes out? ... WAIT!
Videogames.com has SHOTS! It's.... platform. Oh well, he
looks kinda cute. I also have a link to GameBoy Euro-Asia,
which displays three of the shots on the front page. No
clicking necessary.

-- Wario Land II - Review
   No. Wario can not die in this game. Honest. But, heh, the
puzzles are quite challenging. So challenging that some peo-
ple think their WARIO LAND II defective! HAH! And that's not
all GameBoy Euro-Asia says in this review.

-- Mr. Yoshihatas of Sting (Evolution) - Interview
   What do they talk about? Well, they touch briefly on
lotsa things. Why? Mainly because of the language barrier.
Heh. Well, they talk about EVOLUTION, Dreamcast, Sega (why
it's more popular in Japan than America). They also talk
about sushi and why those buffets are bad for you. Well,
I wish they talked about that.

-- AOU Show Report - Feature
   Yeah, man. IGNDreamcast went out to the AOU arcade show
and gots some really prime pics. They file a cool report,
too. So cool, that I'm like serious worked up. I just wish
they would have put the pictures IN the story instead of

The glossary is only completed to "L."

   They got it from Graffitti, a Japanese gaming site, who
got it from... Well, you've heard this joke before. Here's a
word of warning: This is NOT a playable demo. Rather STRIDER
2 showed up at the AOU arcade show in videotape. Ho hum. But,
hey, it's only a 1.8 meg movie and it does have some gameplay
elements. (Oh, the Gaming-Age link was slow for me.)
