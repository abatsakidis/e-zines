   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

    ConsoleCity is three (click) three (click) three (click)
three sites in one! First, there's PSXMax, a premier PSXsite
with all things PlayStation. (You have to check out
Kingboxer's Rumor Mill!) Then there's The Nth Dimension, 
with their oft-scoops on cool movies. And, finally, there's
Dreamcast Insider, which sticks to Dreamcast like cooked
rice sticks to a bride and groom. 

   OtakuBoy's always heading there for the latest info.
Why not you?

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Introducing the new PokeMon Sexually Transmitted Diseases
game for your Color GameBoy. Over 600 strains of virii, bac-
teria, and foriegn agents, all available through a simple
romp in Pokeland. Act now, and you'll get a Gold-Painted
stuffed Pikachu with the cart hidden somewhere in his pri-
vates. It's in stores now. Gotta catch 'em all! 

   HMmmmMMmMMMM... It seems like the sites have put away
their Dreamcasts and gone back to the old, fun stand-bys.
Namely the PSX! Ah, but if yer a PSX fan, you know; you
can't stay away for long. It's like nicotine, heroine,
crack. Gotta get my fix. Catch that, Pokemon.

PlayStation (PSX) 

   We've been hearing stories/rumors/whatevers about a new
anti-pirating chip that's going to destroying the entire
ModChipping Industy. Oh, I'm sorry. Did I actually call it
an 'industry?' Anyway, here's a bit of a difinitive story
from Nikkei, straight from Japan.

   IGNPSX button-holed a bunch of developers and asked them:
'When do YOU think the PSX2 will debut?' It was supposed to
be this secret, subterfuge, trick thingy that would get them
to reveal Sony's plans. Did it work? Well, they all gave
answers, and you can see them in IGNPSX's feature. Maybe
the answers are more of a wish date...

   And speaking of wishes (Segue Alert!) PlayStation.com
has lowered prices on games and stuff and now lets you
create a wish-book or registry so parents, grandparents,
girlfriends, wives, dogs, cats, cat burglers, stalkers,
etc. can buy you the gifts you want. (If you're surly,
you can use the gift-registry to sign up your enemies and
list only bad games. "What's this?! BUSBY 3D?! SHIIIII-
IIIIT!") Anyway, details @ GameFan.

   Please someone save Psygnosis! The Sony star is hurtin'
awful bad. Read about the latest effort to rescue them from 
financial brink at IGNPSX. FGNOnline's 1st 12/8 story reports
a bit of a shake-up in Sony Computer Entertainment Europe's
practices. (Seems they wanted a little too much control over
"rivals.") Details there. "Bust-A-Move 3" PSX has been
delayed. FGNOnline has de news, 6th story down.

   Is "Final Fight" on its way back to the arcade? Could it
even come back to the PSX? Speculation at Digital-Ages and
IGNPSX (more meat at IGN). Speaking of things comin' back,
how about a nice "Carmageddon" on your PSX? Wouldn't that
be nice? Read about the possibilities at Game-Online. And
what the HECK happened to "T'ai FU's" release? GameInformer
has the story!

   Guess who might swing on to the PSX? (It's really hard to
do a "Tarzan" yell with words, let alone ASCII. That was a 
hint, by the way.) Details at IGNPSX. Game-Online talks
about "Civilization 2's" shift to PSX. And remember that
game "Driver?" Kinda disappeared from the release radar
didn't it? FGNOnline reports that it's finally coming.

   Midway, uber-developer, runs their Gamers Day this week.
IGNPSX reports what the developer's bringin' to the PSX in
'99. Digital-Ages reports that there may be a problem get-
tin' "Rainbow Six" over to America. 

   Boy, are those "G-Police 2" cops gonna look trendy in
those Diesel duds. Really! What's Diesel? Ummm... a "trendy
outlet." Not being a trendy sort, I have no idea what they
mean. See if you can figure out the whole store at Game-
Online. Also on Game-Online: What's this? Sci-Fi Action
from Squaresoft? Huh? ;-D Check out the news about 
"CyberBORG."

   Poke. Poke. Poke. I poke your rib cage. You think you're
good at Tekken? Really? Yeah, right. Show me! (If you're in
Europe, anyway.) Check out news on Game-Online of a super-
competition. 

   Electronic Arts dropped by IGNPSX, so they say. (Right,
I'm sure they "stopped by." I'm surrrrrre it wasn't part of
a press tour or some other such silly thing. I'm sure they
were giving you "Sk8er" movies out of the kindness of their
heart. "No need to promote it," EA said. "We just LOVE our
IGNPSX.") Also at IGNPSX: "Uprising-X" movies.

   ConsoleCity's PSXMax reviews the "Street Boarders" im-
port, and the guy sure seems to like this skateboardin'
type game. And here's another review of an import: "R-Type
Delta!" Read all about it at Gaming-Age.

   "Rally Cross 2" rules. So says Gaming-Age. Check out
their review. Could it be that "Twisted Metal 3" is not any
better than 2? Uh oh. Details at PSXMax. Straight from 3DO,
it's "Pet in TV." Psuedo-Tamagotchi invades your PSX. But...
er, Mr. Pet, you're not lookin' to hot. That's what 
ConsoleDomain says. Check out the full review. Oh, and by
the way, Mr. "NCAA GameBreaker," you're nothin' but a two-
bit GameDay wanna be. That's what ConsoleDomain says! 

   I don't get the name Guilty Gear. How does that trans-
late, according to a PSXMax reader, into "arcade fighter."
Check out the Reader Review.


Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   Zelda. The author. If you can't enough of the game, if
you can't get enough of the characters and everything, then
it's time you picked up the novel. Details at FGNOnline.
Also, if you happen to have trouble finding Zelda in the UK, 
there's a reason. What? Ummmm... I think the Queen has been
buying them up? But that's my silly-American theory. "OOh,
I just think Zelda's the bomb, old chap-baby." - The Queen.
Anyway, Game-Online runs a more credible theory/story than
I can give.

   Mario's been showin' up in some strange places. Here's
a hint: Turn ons: Thick mustachios, cannelloni as big as all
get out. Turn offs: Men who are afraid to jump. Yeah. You
know what this means. Nintendo ads in Playboy. 64Source has
the story. And more about the BIG N: Seems like they're 
takin' a partner in Softimage. Details at FGNOnline.

   Midway Gamers Day goes on this week! Honest. Who's
coverin' it? IGN! They report what the BIG M plans for the
N64 in '99. Could Carmageddon head on to N64? Coooooool, eh?
Details at Game-Online. 

   Today, in a galaxy pretty close to you, "Star Wars:
Rogue Squadron" shipped today. All the sites have gone
Skywalker-nutsy. First, IGN64 previews the game and runs
a feature called "Tour De Tatooine," which is like a pic-
torial of Luke's planet. Next-Generation.com reviews the
game, and Nintendojo interviews the developer, Factor 5.

   Videogames.com, in a fit of preparation for the release
of "South Park 64" just days away, updates their big pre-
view. Mostly more pics. Nintendojo takes a preview-ish 
look at "Chamelon Twist 2." (Again, mostly pics.) IGN64
has more pics (!) of "Smash Brothers." Videogames.com
has pics (sigh) of "Mario Party."

   I am shocked! "War: Final Assault" is coming! Are you
shocked? I am. I called my parents. My Dad thought I was
Susan Sarandon and said I did a terrible job in Top Gun. 
IGN64 has a "Bust-A-Move DX" preview. (The DX stands for
Delightfully Xplosive.) ConsoleCity's The Nth Dimension
reports on a new RPG from Konami that's kinda like a Metal
Gear Solid for the N64. It's called "Hybrid Heaven."
Digital-Ages asks, "What the HECK is 'StarShot: Space
Circus.'" But they answer their own question. Check out
their preview.

   Aw, "Crusin' World," you're such a shallow game! Check
out GameCenter's review. Videogames.com takes a look at
"Tiger Woods '99." 

   GameBoy (Oy veh!) has news of new GameBoy games comin'
out -- "Las Vegas Cool Hand," "NFL Blitz," "Power Quest,"
"Rats" and "Shanghai Pocket" Just head on over to their
home page for the latest. Pics and everything! Also on
GameBoy (OH BOY!) new "Pitfall" and "Men in Black" movies!
And yet again on Game Boy (OH JESUS!) news about a device
called the Game Buddy, a battery pack that will run your
Game Boy Pocket for 22 hours! Scroll down the news page.

   GameBoy Euro-Asia has a few new pics of that nifty 
Pokemon STD... er, I mean Pokemon card game coming to 
GameBoy Color. It's the 2nd to last story in the Dec. 9
news.) Also, check out the Dec. 9's last news story: here
comes Goemon. This news on Game-Online: Interplay's gettin'
ready to smack GameBoy Color upside the head with games-
games-games. Check out. 


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   9-9-99 is more than a cryptic Beatles lyric! It's more 
than alot of 9s strung together. It could be THE magic
number for U.S. Dreamcasts. News/Rumor at DreamcastIGN.
Meanwhile, U.S. retailers already support the Dreamcast.
Check out Sega X for the full details.

   Sega-Otaku has the exact sales figures for Dreamcasts'
first weekend. It's just on the shadow side of 150,000. 
Go there for the full story. Also, check out the new pics
from launch day. Lotsa screamin' fans outside, ripping
their clothes off in the snow... Wait, was that Sega-Otaku
I was lookin' at? Anyway, they do have new launch pics. 
And again on Sega-Otaku, they take the Nintendo 64 and PSX,
put it side-by-side with a Dreamcast, take pictures, then
publish them to show you how big old Dreamy-boy is.

  IGN's coverin' Midway's uber-Gamers Day. What will Midway
bring to Dreamcast in '99? Check out DreamcastIGN. Also on
DreamcastIGN, news about "Pop'N Music." Sega-Otaku talks
about a lesser-known game, "Real Sound 2," and the D2 Demo
that's gonna be on the disc. "Climax Landers" was delayed.
Remember? Well, Sega-Otaku has a date, straight from the
publisher. 

   Are you DYING to know all the things you can collect in
PenPen? Then you have to see Gamer's Republic's feature 
with the big list. Then head over to Sega-Otaku for scans
of the manual. Wooohooo. (I'm writing 'Sega-Otaku' so much,
I'm beginning to feel like I'm caught in an Aerosmith song.)

   What's all this stuff about Sonic being delayed. No way,
jose. National Console Support has shipping dates from 
Tokyo distributors. 

   Sega X has Mo' Shenmue! Mo' Shenmue! Mo' Shenmue! Check
out their preview. Gaming-Age has new screens for "Virtual
On 2," and Sega X previews the title. Sega-Otaku has new
shots from "Get BASS" and Sega X previews "Gride Screen."

   Sega X looks at "Biohazard: Codename Veronica" (RESIDENT
EVIL!!!), they've got new pics from Konami's "Flight
Shooting," and the odd "Mercurius Pretty," which is actually
based on a 5 year old RPG. Hmmmm.. ConsoleDomain takes
their own lookie-loo-review at "Virtua Fighter 3: Team
Battle."

   Remember a long time ago, in a country far, far away
Capcom annouced "The Dungeon and Dragons Collection" for
Sega Saturn? Well, Gamers Republic says the project is
still alive! Speaking of things still slive, Sega's
trying to work out a deal to get a new batch of Game
Gears and Saturns on the market. A Game Gear at $30? A
Saturn at $50? Check out Digital-Ages for more info.


Multi-format

   GameCenter takes a look at the history of A.I. in Sports
Games. It's a real neat feature; take a look. National
Console Support hears about a new product: Dracula X 
(Castlevania) trading cards. Cool. 

   Speaking of Castlevania, ole Drac and Simon may be 
immortized in plastic! Details at Game Informer. And at 
IGNPSX, news that Gex may also be immortalized the same
way. Plus, Gex has the Kung-Fu Grip (tm).

Cheers, folks.

             See a cool story? Send it to me!
