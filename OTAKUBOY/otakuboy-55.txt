never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where

Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   Who cares, huh? As long as they keep goin' down! What do
I mean? Dreamcast import prices, silly! That's what the Web
is all a-titter about today. You can now buy a Dreamcast
for under $400. Wow! Isn't that a steeeeeel? I mean, now you
only have to put off toilet paper for two months instead of
four. (Hmmm... $400.00 worth of toilet paper?) Check out
Katana-Edge and FGNOnline for the info.

   But you just might want to wait a bit before you purchase
that Japanese DC. Because word keeps comin' out about the
U.S. Dreamcast launch. Lookie here: Over on Digital-Ages,
news about the launch titles. And yes, Ole Blue Ball is
in there, as is VF3tb!

   SegaX SCORES! They spy in an interview with Konami's
Jon Sloan that maybe... just maybe... METAL GEAR SOLID is
comin' to Dreamcast! SNAKE?! SNAAAAAAAAAAAAKE?!

   Sega-Otaku scores, too. They've translated all the "short
and to the point" character descriptions on UNDERCOVER's
official Web site. Go read 'em... should take you about two
seconds. ;) Also on Sega-Otaku, news about Senritsu No 
Bishou, Koei's 3D-adventure-o-plenty. Well, it's not much
"news," after all. Mostly pics and stuff scanned in from 
Famitsu. But, hey! Click, view, be happy.

   Why don't you just KICK MY BASS! Er... I don't know where
that joke was going. Anyhoo, SegaX has news up on the up-
coming GET BASS and the new fishing controller that you can 
use on it. How cool is that? (Incidentally, I told Chris
Johnston of Videogames.com yesterday that if you fish near
the old fishing pier in GET BASS, you find a body. He didn't
believe me. But it's TRUE, DAMMIT! ;)

   Over on Magic Box are shots of a new title, EXPENDABLE.
Digital-Ages reveals a couple Shenmue battle modes. And at
GameFan, all the young dudes, carry the news, that STREET
FIGHTER ZERO 3 is on its way to DC & SATURN!

   Hey, remember last week we talked about the little VMS
file you could download to hear all of SONIC ADVENTURE'S
menu commands in English? Well, Sonic Zone, the zone dedi-
cated to all things Sonicy, shows you how to do it. It's
the bomb. It's the H-Bomb.

   National Console Support posts a really neat review of
the Dreamcast VGA Box. You have to read it to see just how
much stuff you're missing in the games. They talk only
about SONIC ADVENTURE, but you can get an idea of just how
important it is to get this peripheral. Anyone got a spare
VGA monitor they can loan ole OtakuBOYEEEEEEEEEEEE!

   And speaking of peripherals, GameSpot takes a look
at the PURUPURU Pak & The Light Gun. (They do love you, af-
ter all!) Boy, these light guns look more real every year.
Just don't point this one at a cop. Mmmmm, k? Meanwhile,
Sega-Otaku runs a story on the Headset Microphone, the one
that's gonna turn your voice into stunning computer files,
ready to upload to Dreamcast's servers, ready to send to
your friend, and ready to make your friend send you back a
mail bomb cause he didn't like what you said.

   Jeez, already! What is this? VIRTUA FIGHTER 4 has been
showed to the arcade press? Yep. And SegaX has the scoopy.
Meanwhile, take a gander at the SUPER SPEED RACING Web site.
Ole Sega set it up. o'course it's in Japanese, but don't
let that stop ya from seeing da pretty pictures.

PlayStation (PSX)

   R-R-R-RALLY MASTERS! Next-Generation has an interview 
with Digital Illusions' CEO, Fredrik Liliegren. It's all 
about the genre and about how much better handling in such
driving games has become. Plus, of course, loads of info
on RALLY MASTERS! 

   Lots of people have all of a sudden took notice of RE:
Tokyo's super FINAL FANTASY VIII Special. For instance, 
Game Informer has taken out all the good pieces and put it
into one feature. Also, PSXNation takes about the pieces
about the PocketStation mini-games, as well as the vehicles
that you get to fool around with during the game. Read them
all. To your health. SLURP!

   So, long scwewy! See you in St. Louie-Louie. Also, see
you on the PlaySation as new Looney Tunes games come to
the PSX. So says PSXNation. But while that's scwewy, this
next item SUCKS! Huhuhuhuhuhuh. BEAVIS & BUTTHEAD's been
canned, according to FGNOnline. Has it been cancelled? Or
merely delayed. Only the guys who analyze the company's
quotes know for sure. Oh, and on PSXMax, news that MISSION
IMPOSSIBLE is headin' on to PSX! Waaahooooooooooo! I think.
Someone I talked to recently wants to know if it'll have a
lot of fog. :(

   IGNPSX has a couple of cool previews. First up is POINT
BLANK 2. And this game look really cool... all kinds-a fun
games. Fer instance, a stop watch is countin' down. You have
to shoot it as close to zero as possible. Cool, man. Next
preview is SHAO LIN. Yeah, yeah. We've seen it before. But
I like this one; it's bigger. It's got meat. And besides,
every single preview so far has mentioned the fact that
the artist who did Gundam 0083 is doing this one. So, I am
only assuming that you want to know this over and over and
over and over and over and over and over... ;)

   Three cheers for Web-news diggin' TANSU! The brother from
another country found a really big SaGa FRONTIER preview 
o'er on Videogames.com. You'll love it. Trust me. (Or trust
TANSU, anyway.) Meanwhile, Gaming-Age has a big preview of
PRINCE NASEEM BOXING. "Ahem. Excuse me ol' chap, I'm going
to punch your lights out. Thank you."

   Will UPRISING X give you an rising? Umm... No, says
Console Domain. Meanwhile, it don't look good for ASSAULT:
RETRIBUTION. At least not in Digital-Ages review. Yikes.


Nintendo 64 (N64)

   REPEAT PARAGRAPH ALERT! WOOP! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP!
R-R-R-RALLY MASTERS! Next-Generation has an interview 
with Digital Illusions' CEO, Fredrik Liliegren. It's all 
about the genre and about how much better handling in such
driving games has become. Plus, of course, loads of info
on RALLY MASTERS! (Hey, the game's comin' out on N64,
too.)

   Hey, IGN64 has a super feature detailing all the First-
Person shooters due out this year. Feast your thighs... er,
I mean your eyes. Sorry. Meanwhile over on Nintendo 
Underground, Matt Atwood from Capcom answers questions about
the future. "So, Matt. Howzitgoin'?" No comment. "Can you
tell us anything about Capcom?" No comment. "Is my butt 
green, Matt?" No comment. Ah, interviews. (Ahem. The inter-
view has good meat to it.)

   Yay! Star Wars Racer is a-GOOOOOOOO! So says IGN64. Also,
in the same story, a bit about the Toy Expo in Europe.

   It's sword fighting. It's puzzle solving. It's HYPE. 
What is it? It's an RPG-Adventure-Type-Game-Thingy. And it's
previewed over on IGN64. Also on IGN64, YES!!!!! WCW NITRO
is finallly comin' out. Here's a list o' wrestlers.

   64 Source reviews SMASH BROS. and they ask: Are the days
of N64 fighters sucking gone? It's awful quiet in here. De-
tails at 64 Sourece. Also on 64 Source, a bit update to 
their release list. Check it out.

   Pokemon fever is quite scary, ain't it? I mean, they've
got video games, tv shows... what's next?! A CARD GAME!
with booster packs and everything ala Magic The Gathering.
In fact it's Wizard's Of the Coast sellin' the stuff. De-
tails at both Game Informer. On GameBoy Euro-Asia, stuff
about Poke going BEANIE? Ugh.


GameBoy Color (GBC)

   Can you take a game like MISSION IMPOSSIBLE and squeeze
it into a GameBoy Color? Can ya? Sounds a like a MISSION
IMPOSSIBLE, don't it? (Hey, whenever someone writes or talks
about MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, it's required that you come up
with a pun based on that title.) Anyway, GBCDojo reports
that it IS comin' out... soon. 

   GameBoy Euro-Asia brings news of new GameBoy Color 
accessories. Put stuff on your GameBoy Color. Like a
Protector and Power Packs. You'll be glad you accessorized.
Meanwhile, there's a Pokemon Card Game for GameBoy Color in
Japan. PokeAbode has the details on it! (Very good walk-
through and all kinds o' stuff.)


Multi-Format & Misc

   COME GET SOMMMMME POPCORN! Come watch my moooooovie. 
That's my best ASCII Duke Nukem impression. Thank you. 
Check sent to otakuboy@bigfoot.com will be cashly prompt.
Anyway, FGNOnline has news on the upcoming movie... a bit
about the plot. (It invovles strippers! Why did I dink a
dat?! DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!)

   Over on Magic Box are a bunch o' pictures of new NEO
GEO POCKET games. And over on Game Informer, word that
NEO GEO POCKET is comin' to the U.S. Summer, d00dz. Summer.
Meanwhile, GameBoy Euro-Asia spied a print ad for NGP. 
Hey, you. I AM NOT BOY!

Cherrios, folks! (Rice Krispies, Cocoa Puffs, etc.)

       See a cool story? cool site? Send it to me!
