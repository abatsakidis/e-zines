   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   We -- meaning those lovable, huggable sites -- are nearly
back to full publishing schedule. Some sites came back early
this week in full force. Others? Well, they're still playing
smack-dong. "Smack-Dong" is trademarked OtakuBoy Industries.

   But this is good because that means you and me can slide
back into the videogame news hunting mode. So, put that ex-
tra hole in your belt and let's get started!

-----------

PlayStation (PSX) 

   Hey, remember the PocketStation? That little PDA-thingy
that's supposed to be the Dreamcast-VMS-Killer!! (Well, I
made that last part up.) It kinda disappeared from the re-
lease date radars a few weeks back. Next-Generation gets
the news behind the delay.   

   Lotsa sites are all abuzzed over an announcement about
a real, bonafide commerical (meaning you don't have to dis-
guise your IP Address, go to a site and download it and hope
no one saw you) PSX emulator for the Macintosh. Isn't this
weird?! Something ground-breaking appearing on a Macintosh?
(Sorry, let me wipe this bias off my face.) Whatever hap-
pened to PSYKE?! Anyway check out GameSpot for the info.

   You should vote for PSX Game of 1998. Why? Ummm.. I can't
think of a particular reason. Although exercising your God-
given right to form an opinion should strike you as the 
patriotric inspiring action it is! SALUTE! Go to Console
Domain and VOTE!

   Another thing to be all abuzzed about: The sequel to 
PaRappa! This time, it's "Jammaster Ramy" and he likes hard
rock. How hard do you think he'll make it? Will he sing 
Slayer's lovely ballads? How about early Metallica? Anyway,
Digital-Ages has the info. And in a quick import release
note: "R-Type Delta" debuted in Japan. Next-Generation has
some impressions. (They placed it in a sand box and made
impressions. GET iT!! HA! I kill me.)

   Hey! Did you know "Beavis And Butt-Head Do Hollywood" is
comin' to PSX?! I didn't! Well, Videogames.com has a super-
big preview. Really, really cool. Speaking of COOL: IGNPSX
has a big preview of "Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street 
Fighter," and they gots lots of movies, too! But here's a
NOT TOO COOL: "Samauri Legends" just doesn't sound all that
good. Details on GameFan.

   ConsoleCity has an import review today! Cool, eh? It's
"Ergheiz," a new RPG from Square. Speaking of reviews, 
GameCenter takes a look at "Bust-A-Groove!" FOUR X's?!?!


Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   OOoh Oooh! AaaH AH! "Donkey Kong 64" pounds onto the
net and the sites are all a-titter. (Pass the milk and Jun-
gle Juice!) First, check out 64Source's big news round-
up. (They also have news about "Beetle Adventure Racing"
and more.) Then check out Digital-Ages for the OFFICIAL
announcement from Nintendo.

   If you're dying (DYING!) to know how many N64s and what
not sold in Japan in the last month, then check out 64
Source. They've got the stats from Famitsu!
   
   You should vote for N64 Game of 1998. Why? Ummm.. I can't
think of a particular reason. Although exercising your God-
given right to form an opinion should strike you as the 
patriotric inspiring action it is! SALUTE! Go to Console
Domain and VOTE! (And yes, you have seen this paragraph
before.)

   64 Source found pics from the new "Toukon Road" comin'
to Japan awfully soon. Check out their story. Also, I've
included the link to the new pics page on Hudson's Japanese
Web site. And to wrap up this mega-update from 64 Source,
they review "South Park 64." Yeah, yeah, we've covered this
game before. BUT! (TOCKS) Lots of gamers have been complain-
in' about South Park's fog-problem. Maybe you wanna rethink
before you purchase...?

   Now this excites me. It gets me all tingly inside. All
dual-shocky. All rumbly. What am I talking about? Why I'm 
talking about Black and Decker's new line of power drills.
No, seriously, I'm talking about the new game comin' out
for GameBoy that's gonna make the whole durn thing vibrate!
Details at GameSpot.

   Is there really a 151st Pokemon? Could "Pokemon Yellow"
come over to the United States? Find out over on Nintendojo
GameBoy Dojo!

   Console Domain reviews "Turok 2" for GameBoy Color and,
I GOTTA tell ya, its some sucks. Yuk-a-doodle-doo. So,
instead, check out GameBoy Euro-Asia for a quick pic of 
the new Pokemon Playing Cards. Go fish!


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   SegaNet has a couple of cool, nifty, splenderific, hoo-
fah-ish, features! It's Sonic! The Knuckles and Amy Ad-
ventures. Oh no no no, there's more to Sonic Adventure than
just controllin' ole Blue Boy.

   Sega X brings news -- bad news unfortunately -- of two
more title delays. "Sega Rally 2" and "Climax Landers." I
am going to cry. WEEEEEEEEEEEP. But don't cry too much,
because the Sega X boys have some new news on the upcoming
RPG, "Lack of Love." (You know that's how I feel all the
time... lack of love. Sob.) And speaking of RPG's, check out
another new RPG, "Sengoku Turb" on Sega-Otaku.

   Also on Sega X, Yu Suzuki speaks a bit more about ShenMue
and all its wonderful glory. Then, head on over to Game-
Online, where the ole U.K. boys get down in the mud and 
pull apart all of Shenmue's concepts.

   "Reddog" comin' to Dreamcast? YES! It excites me so much,
I forgot what the game was about. Hmmmm... Anyway, details
on FGNOnline.

   Re:Tokyo and NCS have news about a Sega peripheral comin'
out that'll let lucky Dreamcasters hook up their systems to
VGA monitors! Watch Sonic blaze is crispy color.


Multi-format & Misc

   WOAH! BIIIIIIIIIIIIIG article on the upcoming Tokyo Game
Show. What could be there? When will it be? Will they sell
those nifty little BBQ weiners? All the answers on RE:Tokyo.

   What does the Gathering of Developers (aka GOD -- boy
what an ego-stroke) have in store for consoles? Check out
GameFan.

   And finally, look onto GameInformer for a way to play
games in your car. Oh, friends don't let friends play
while driving.  

Cheers, folks.
