   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   There's absolutely so much stuff today, that I'm at a 
loss to even comment on it. (The truth is, I can't think of
anything witty to say. But when can I ever?! BAWL!)   

-----------


PlayStation (PSX) 

   So, I'll just step aside and let Connectix do the talkin'
right here. You know Connectix. SURE you do! They're makers
of the new PlayStation emulator for the Mac! Are they cra-
zy? Are they insane? Do they want to stoke the fire that is
Sony? Well, IGNPSX asks 'em.

   Meanwhile, Next-Generation scores a pretty cool interview
today. They're talking with Tarrnie Williams, Jr., inventor
of the rotary engine. Ooops. Sorry, that's not what I meant.
It's Tarrnie Williams, Jr., producer of "Street Sk8er,"
which, you know, is comin' to the U.S. via EA. They all sit
down and talk about the translation and what not. 

   Quick! What's the next hot-to-trot/most anticipated title
of 1999? NO! It's not "Castlevania 64," and, NO!, it's not
"Barney, a Nosedive, and an Empty pool." It's "Dragon Quest
VII!" You did know it was comin' out this month, eh? Check
out GameSpot for the information. Also on GameSpot, a pretty
good news spot about the new Parappa, along with a video 
clip of the Japanese TV commercial.

   WOOHOOO! ("WOOHOOO!" trademarked OtakuBoy Industries. 
Trademarked "WOOHOOO!"s since 1753.) Digital-Ages has the
super-big list of Acclaim's '99 line up. And all I gotta
say -- at least as far as the PSX is concerned -- is...
"Let go-a my cheesy poofs!"

   Yes, UK Gamers! I relent! I GIVE IN! You can have "Silent
Hill" before Japan. I've pulled all the strings I can at
Konami and they're gonna do it. Yes, you have no one but
me to thank. Anyhoo, IGNPSX has that news. Oh, and if you're
a-in the "Silent Hill" mood, go check out an old preview of
it on Game Informer.

   NOOOOOO! Not Hello Kitty! Not on my PSX! NO NO NO! IGNPSX
has the gut-wrenching details. And just when you thought it
was safe to think you'd never see another Tetris, up pops
"The Next Tetris." Details on PSXNation. Also on PSXNation,
word that Keith Jackson is going to be the announcer in the
upcoming "NCAA Gamebreaker." Who's Keith? Well, I'm told
that if you follow the NCAA, you know. I don't, so I'll
just take their word for it.

   National Console Support explores the trials and tribu-
lations of trying to get the Japanese version of "Final
Fantasy VIII" to the states. (It ain't easy.) Meanwhile,
IGNPSX posts more art from the game AND news about a sup-
posedly famous Japanese pop-star gracing the soundtrack.
Could it be Minmei from Macross?

   Gaming-Age takes a look at "Deep Freeze." They call it
a Resident Evil type game, and this one's from Square no
less! Wow. Meanwhile, Videogames.com previews "Centipede."
OooOOOOoh. Centipede. You can't run away. C'mon, didn't any-
one buy and listen to the FULL Pac-Man Fever album? Oh, 
wait, that was just me. GameFan takes a look at "March 
Madness '99." Oh, those college sports games. How do I not
play thee; let me count the ways.

   Oh, also on GameFan, news of a brand-new PlayStation...
Well, sorta.. (NO! It's not PSX2. Nothing of the kind. Calm
down.)


Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   HOLY FRAK!! A sequel to "The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina
of Time?!" NO WAAAAY! And yet, Nintendojo says it might be
true. Meanwhile, if you're interested in another guide for 
the current Zelda, check out the new one over on
Videogames.com.

   sssssssshhhh... nintendojo has word of a secret project
for the n64 comin' up. but i didn't tell you about it...

  "MONSTER(RRR) Madness" is comin' to the N64! So says, 
Game-Online and IGN64. Read both. It's good for you. And 
eat your brocolli. 

   Sports madness hits the videogaming world today. First,
Derek Jeter slaps himself a contract to appear in the
upcoming "All Star Baseball 2000!" Details on GameFan. Also,
Ken Griffey's comin' back! Details on IGN64.

   Japanese gamers, rejoice! You have a launch date for 
"Smash Brothers," the cool Mario fighter. Meanwhile, Gaming-
Age takes a look at the current advertising campaign. Boy,
it's a freaky, freaky. Snap, crackle, pop! "Pokemon Snaps!"
It's a new game. Check out its details on FGN Online. 

   64 Source takes a look at "Shadowman." It's Dark, moody,
and oh, so chocolatey! IGN64 previews "Rayman 2: The Great
Escape." Could it be the great escape from the game sales-
person that tries to get you to buy this game? 

   And Nintendo-finally, GameSpot has a report about up-
coming episodes of Pokemon! Gotta tape 'em all!


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   Just a day after all the tittering about the delay on
"Sega Rally 2," many sites report that it ain't all that
bad after all. Hmmmm... Check out Sega-Otaku and SegaNet.
SegaNet's got a bit o' analysis about it. Back on Sega-
Otaku is word that lucky Japanese gamers will get to try
"Sega Rally 2" long before the sucker comes out. Also on
Sega-Otaku, news that the cool Dreamcast racing wheel is 
still on track. No pun intended.

   This is cool. SegaX's Dennis Day spends a day (or a mor-
ning, or an afternoon -- I don't really know) callin' all
kinds of Dreamcast developers to see what they're up to.
It's a feature. It's at SegaX! CLICK!

   Mothra just flew back onto your TV, and boy are his
wings tired. GamersRepublic has two reports: one about the
Dreamcast title and another about the VMS game. Woohooo!

   FGN Online has a vewwy, vewwy small story about "Stunt
Grand Prix" and how it's comin' to Dreamcast. Well, Next-
Generation interviews the developers. Ohboyohboyohboy! Also
on FGN Online, news about another new title "Worms
Armageddon." (Gotta tell you though... ain't much news in
that there story.) Check out SegaX for news on new-titles
"LA Riders" and "Fire Pro (da sequel!)."

   Sega-Otaku has a TON of new Shenmue shots -- like 63
of them, they say. (Don't know if they're all new. :) On
SegaNet, download Shenmue movies.

   Next-Generation posts their Sonic review, while SegaNet
continues to profile all the Sonic Adventure characters.
This time it's Big The Cat and E-102.

   YOWEEE! A bonafide Saturn review? Yep. This one comes 
from ConsoleDomain and it's about "Burning Rangers." You're
a fire fighter. You put out fires. Actually, it looks a lot
cooler than it sounds. Go see.

   What's this? A Sega site pulling out interview comments
from a Japanese magazine where Nintendo's chief talks about
Asian's financial problems and how his company is sufferin'?
Yep. SegaX has that news. (Hmmm.. I didn't see it on any
Nintendo sites.)

Multi-format & Misc

   GamersRepublic shows you the OFFFFFICIAL Tokyo Game Show
logo. It's cool... if you like that sorta thing. 

   Meanwhile, it looks like Bandai's gonna take its Wonder-
swan toys away from Sega and go home. (Sega was distibuting
them.) Details on GameFan. And speaking of Wonderswan, 
Nikkei reports that Konami's "Beatmania" is gonna appear on
the Wonderportable.

   Pretend I've just turned into Kenny Loggins. I sing:
Right in to the Re-hash zone. Gonna take ya right in toooo
the re-hash zoooooooooooooone! That's RIGHT, ol' Titus has
the rights to develop games based on the movie Top Gun. And
it just leaves me with one question:

      When   Will   That   Damn   Movie   Die  ?!?!

Cheers, folks.

             See a cool story? Send it to me!
