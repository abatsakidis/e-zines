   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online video game zines -- even on sites you've never heard
of before -- to scour out the best features, reviews, pre-
views, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where to get them
all. OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Hey folks. Do you realize how many damn vidgame zines are
out there? Jay-zus! And every week more guys get the pub-
bing bug in their pants and ejaculate even more zines. 
   Well, it is pretty cool to have all this cool info out
there. But who can read all that everyday? 
   That's where I, OtakuBoy, come in. I look out for the 
best stuff on the vidgame zine sites, pare it all down, and,
if you want more info, tell you where to get it. Hey, I 
don't report the news, I report what the news guys report.

   Itchin' to get your hands on that new Color Gameboy? Who
wouldn't want more 8-bit games, right? Well, check out
Dave's Classics for a couple of shots of Dragon Quest
Monsters (Jap) -- at least wrapped up in the news that
Virtual GameBoy, the zippy GB Emulator, will support color
games in 1.3. Joy!
  Oh, what, oh, what will Sony do? Everyone's just all 
a-titter about Dreamcast. And why not? It looks fuckin' 
cool! Even Sonic may have new found respect. IGN Dreamcast
takes the wraps off the news that Galleon -- developed by
Confounding Factor, ex-Core people -- will land on 
Dreamcast shortly after its PC debut. OH, you gotta read it
to believe it! Ign64's also showin' a picture of the limited
edition, gold _Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_ carts
coming soon from Nintendo. IGN64's news breaks down what
you gotta do to get this special cart -- and every retailer
seems to have their own package and qualifications! One
even demands castration! HONEST! Well, I lost my jewels
for a first edition of _BatMan: The Dark Knight Returns_,
so I suppose I won't be gettin' Gold. 
  Poor, BitchX. He/She/It ran with a story on 9.30 about EA
buying Blizzard and has been getting conflicting information 
ever since. PR people say one thing; EA people say another.
Maybe that's what you get when you run a gossip/rumor site.
I don't do that! No, sir! Not ME! Anywho, the latest report,
10.2, continues the fun Also, he's been playing Shogo, and
Epic's Tim Sweeny talks about the Unreal engine, among other
things this non-programmer don't know shit about. 
   I've got nine Unix boxes in my back room. They're just
sitting there collecting dust. Why? Because I can. Nyah. 
But now it looks like I'm gonna have ta fire 'em up again
to play Bonk's Revenge or some such nonsense. Emunews 
reports that VPCE/Unix 0.3f is not released. Where do you
get the Roms? Ah, now, that would be illegal. Emu News also
links to the new A/NES, an Amiga NES emu. An obsolete game
system on an obsolete computer? Who'da thunk it?

   [Management here: We apologize for OtakuBoy's proclamation 
that the Amiga is 'obsolete.' He doesn't know what he is
talking about and should be shot. Management thanks you.]

   I'm still pissed at my parents. A local video store went
out of business and drastically discounted everything --
including a cool ColecoVision. ONLY $10!!! I hate my parents!
Do you hear me! I HATE THEM! GameCenter proclaims the 
"classic ColecoVision top 10." Well, that's what we in the
writin' biz-ness call a bad headline. What they really mean
is: "The Top 10 Colecovision Games." Usually, I'd go and
read the article and give you the gist, but this time, I
won't spoil it fer ya.
   Hey, here's something that barely saw the light of day
anywhere else. Over on Oshi's Preview-Gamest, you can still
get a good look at NeoGeo Pocket. Don't know what it is?
Well, it's a pocket gaming system with a greyscale screen. 
Sounds a lot like GameBoy, don't it? Well, that's about 
all it is -- a Gameboy clone. And it's probably too little,
too late for SNK. 10.28's the Japanese release date. Oshi's
got cool pics of games, adverts, and more. He doesn't say
much about the product, but, hey, a picture's worth a
THOUSAND words. Right?
   Ah, this is a bit old, but what the hell. Re:Tokyo's got
a news-blurb about "Beatmania" that should be out as of 
10.1 for Japanese Playstations. We know this game better
as "Hip-Hop Mania," the arcade game with the turntable 
in which you have to scratch records and tap keyboards
to achieve "groove." Well, the cool thing about the
home Beatmania is that ASCII-Japan constructed a special
controller that looks very close to the original arcade
controller -- buttons, turntable, and all! If/when Hip-
Hop debuts on Playstation here, we could see the same 
controller. Cool. Re:Tokyo's got the latest.
   Hey, dudes. Sunday's usually a slow news day. But the 
sites are clock full o' stuff. Check out the links below.
