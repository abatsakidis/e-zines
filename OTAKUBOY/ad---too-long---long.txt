Do you realize that if you realllly wanted to keep up with all the console videogaming news, reviews, views, etc., that appears on the sites it would take hours every day? 

Every weekday (and some Saturdays!) they put up new reviews, news, features, etc., etc., etc. A lot of it is good stuff, you know -- stuff you want to see. Jeez. It just takes too durn LONG to find it all, not to mention actually finding what you like. 

Well, lookie here, OtakuBoy Online newsletter surfs over 40 console gaming sites every day for the latest news, reviews, previews, features, and all those lovely etceteras about the N64, Saturn, Dreamcast, PSX, and others.

OtakuBoy publishes a convenient list o' links and narrative, pointing out the best-o'-the-best. THREE-DAYS-A-WEEK! YOINKS!

It's de-lightful. It's de-loverly. It's de-Otakuboy Online. And it's
de-free.
