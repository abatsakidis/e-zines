   HAPPY BIIIIIRTHDAY TO SEGA X! Boy, this site is one of 
the kick-assingest, ball-bustingest, soap-latheringest Sega
sites out there. If you've never visited, you should.

-----------

Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   And to celebate -- er, I mean celebrate, the ole boys
are GIVING AWAY copies "Sega Rally 2" when it comes out.
There's just one catch. You have to win the contest first.
DAMMIT! Anyway, entry stuff at SegaX.

   In other Sega news, it still looks like there's gonna
be a Castlevania on the DC! WOOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO! Magic-
Box talked about it last week and now Konami is hintin' a-
might strongly at it. Wow. SMOOOOOOOCH, Konami. Details at
Next-Generation Online.

   Sega-Otaku has scans of "Monaco Grand Prix 2" print ads.
I can't read them, of course, but they look cool! And spea-
king of things looking cool, "Marvel Vs. Capcom" pics over
on Gaming-Age! 

   WHAT?! "Climax Landers" delayed again? I canna stand it,
laddies! Stop delayin' already and start releasin'! Details
on FGNOnline and Gaming-Age. (Oh, in the same FGN story, a
quick note from National Console Support that "House of The
Dead 2" has been delayed as well. BuMS!)

   SegaX brings on the new details tonight! First, new news
about "Under Cover." Hey, it's not much, but you at least
get to know the genre a bit. Also, what kind of peripherals
is NyKo gonna make? SegaX has the answer. And speaking of
peripherals, wanna know what the DC VGA adaptor's gonna look
like? Well, I've gotta link to to a pic!

   Hey, follow this one: The D2 demo will be delightfully
downloading. No, it doesn't make any sense. I'm just trying
to bring home the point that the D2 demo, coming out with
"Real Sound," will use the modem. Details on SegaNet.

   SegaX has a really good update about "Metropolis." They
also mention something about torturing a company representa-
tive, but don't go into HOW they tortured. I'll have to look
for a story on one of the bondage newsgroups. SegaX also has
new movies from "Evolution"!

   And in a bit o' Saturn news, National Console Support 
knows when Capcom's "Dungeons & Dragons Collection" is 
gonna be ready! COOOOOL!


PlayStation (PSX) 

   Undo that belt. Whip down those pants. Pull up that shirt
and starting surfin' on over to Re:Tokyo, dudes! Well, that
is, if you like "Final Fantasy VIII" and you want to read
their Special Report. It's PART 1 -- a prologue AND a list
of characters. And over on FGNOnline? News that there are
NO treasure chests in FF8?! OH GAWD!

   Oh, you lovable PSXNation. Samoooooch! You get the cool
news! Like info on what's new and comin' from 989 Studios.
"NFL Xtreme 2" and "Jet Moto 3." COOL! Check it out folks,
at PSX Nation.

   Hey! Are you in Japan? Do you want to buy a PSX? Then, 
Here. Have a price cut, whydon'cha! The story on the latest
PSX price cut at Nikkei!

   HEHE! PlayStations are SHOCKING! No, I don't mean they
have cool games. And no I'm not talking about the vibrating!
I'm saying they really do SHOCK! That's because the silly
plugs and things are cracked! So says a release on Sony's
Web site, which PSXMax and PSXNation both spied. (PSXNation
prints the full release!) Also shocking: "Ray Man 2" has 
been DELAYED! Details at GameFan.

   I'm tired of all this PlayStation 2 news. Yah, yeah. I'm
suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure it's comin' out this year.
Riiiiiiiiiiiiight, ConsoleDomain and Magic Box, I'm suuuuuu-
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure you guys heard Hudson Soft's
chief say that PSX2 was comin' out this year. Suuuuuuuuuuu-
uuuuuuuuuuuuure. Tell me another one. 

   BOING! It's Dance music! BOING! It's Chinese Astrology!
BOING! It's Tempest! What is it? Why, it's "IS Internal
Section!" And IGNPSX has a super new preview, guaranteed to
help you soil your shorts. And speaking of shorts, 
Videogames.com casts their pre-viewin'-ish eye on "Knockout
Kings 2" from EA. 

   Whoever heard of a POOL game with a story line? Well, 
Videogamers.com has. Honest! And they review it -- 
"Backstreet Billards." It's a story about a young man who
goes on a quest to find his lost stick. It's a jerker, all
the way.

   Ahem. ConsoleDomain takes a look at "Civilization II."
Can a game such as this transport over to a console. Huh?
Well, ConsoleDomain thinks so. PlayStationFAN takes a look
at "WCW/NWO tHuNDeR!"

   And speaking of PlayStationFan, take a look at the next
PlayStation, if you dare. Is it true? Hello? Art Bell? Are
you there?


Nintendo 64 (N64)

   Soooooooooo, how's "Fighting Force 64" doin'? Well, 
Nintendo Underground gets down to the bottom of it in their
interview with Core Design, makers and shakers-n-bakers
of FF64.

   Remember over the weekend the "news" about how the next
Bond game "The World is Not Enough" would be made for the
big N's NEXT-GENERATION console? Well, it turns out that 
maybe the N64 is enough after all. :(

   WooHOOO! "Gauntlet Legends" is at a whoppin' 35% com-
plete! Jay-SUS! Check out the latest pics at Game-Online.

   It's MORE! MORE! MORE! times 3! First, Acclaim's gonna
give you MORE wrestlers in the upcoming "WWF Attitude!"
Check out IGN64 for the info. Next, it's "MORE Rally 
Racing!" Also on IGN64. And then, over on Magic Box, it's 
MORE MORE MORE info on "Beetle Racing Adventure," like all
kinds of info about the tracks and scenery and stuff.

   OOoooh. What's Konami up to now? And don't try to play 
for time, IGN64, I want you to give it to us straight. NO
PUSSY-FOOTIN'! Anyhoo, find out what Konami is up to this
year on IGN64. Meanwhile, 64 Source has a big preview of
"Mario Party." And... ahem... I have to tell you about
something little ole me wrote. BLUSH! It's on Digital-Ages
and it's about Castlevania 64. Blush.

  N64-Finally, Nintendo's getting to be a might fruity these
days. Go see what I mean at Nintendo.com.


GameBoy Color (GBC)

   Wh-Wh-What?! No more black & white GameBoys? That's what
it looks like in a latest announcement from Nintendo! Check
out MagicBox and GameBoy Euro-Asia for the earth-shakin'
info. Rumble.

   Also on GameBoy Euro-Asia -- WHAT A COOOOOL DEVICE! It's
called the "GB Getter." It protects your GBC as you travel
about. But when you walk near a person with another GB 
Getter, the darn thing buzzes and lights up! Cool.

   GameBoyDojo has news on a version of "Ghosts & Goblins"
headin' toward GBC. Also, GameFan has a tiny note at the 
bottom of another news item -- "South Park" is comin' to
GameBoy! Also comin' it's "Space Station: Silicon Valley."
Check out FGNOnline for that info.

  And, finally, ConsoleDomain has a preview of "Prince of
Persia." 

Cheers, folks.

       See a cool story? cool site? Send it to me!
