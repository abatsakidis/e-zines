   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

    ConsoleCity is three (click) three (click) three (click)
three sites in one! First, there's PSXMax, a premier PSXsite
with all things PlayStation. (You have to check out
Kingboxer's Rumor Mill!) Then there's The Nth Dimension, 
with their oft-scoops on cool movies. And, finally, there's
Dreamcast Insider, which sticks to Dreamcast like cooked
rice sticks to a bride and groom. 

   OtakuBoy's always heading there for the latest info.
Why not you?

   Oy. OtakuBoy here, with a bunch of new subscribers on 
board courtesy of uber-site Console City. Check out their
sponsor message up above.

   I'm excited, d00dz. I can finally lead with PlayStation!
Yay! Lots and lots of links. Wooo hoo!   

-----------

PlayStation (PSX) 

   In fact, with a headline such as this next one, you'd
tar and feather me for NOT going with PlayStation first.

   What could it be? A FARGIN' Final Fantasy 8 MOVIE, 
fellers! Holy malarky! Jeez! I can't believe it. Gaming-Age,
I love you. Love? YES, LOVE! Here, let me show you...
ZIIIIIIP.

   Ahem. In other news, 110,000 UK PlayStations sold during a
recent week. The number is not Sony-confirmed but is rumored
to be close. And only Sony's hairdresser knows the reasons
why it happened. But that didn't stop Game-Online from stab-
bing at the whys.

   "Syphon Filter" has a date, according to FGN. But, ha-ha,
they don't tell us the date. Isn't that funny? Yeah, I can
see you laughing. PSXNation says it's February 1999. More
details there. GameWEEK runs a story about the Cool Boarders
Videogame Challenge coming soon. Meanwhile, Game-Online pre-
views the very British "Max Power Racing." (British as in,
it's somewhat based on a popular national magazine that
the English would know easily -- at least according to
Game-Online. Could you imagine such a thing here? Field &
Stream Power Bass Fishing? Yeah, I can imagine it, too.)

   Jeez! Could "Crash Bandicoot: WARPED" be any shorter? 3
hours is not a lot of game time. Of course if you suck-a-
doodle-do, like me, 3 hours translates to 30. Anyway, 
PSXMax reviews the new game. ConsoleDomain takes a look at
"Tiny Tank: Up Your Arsenal," and calls it 'resentfully
cute.' HA! And Game-Online reviews "Colony Wars: Vengeance."
Yeah, it's kinda old, but it's also kinda cool. (The game,
I mean. ;)

   And now for something completely... You know the rest.
PSXMax runs a story about videogames promotion in the 
Philippines. All you retailers out there could get some
pretty good ideas for your store! You're in the moneee. 
You're in the moneee.

Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   Are you a fan of the PC games "Synnergist?" Oh. Well, 
then, how about "Dark Angæl?" (I just don't know PC
games, but apparently the developer, Vicarious, does 
pretty good RPGs and they're comin' to the N64!) Details
over at IGN64.

   Take bowling and minature golf, throw it in a "space-age"
blender at hit puree. What do you get? According to Game-
Online, you get "Milo's Astro Lane." Check out news of the UK
version at Game-Online.

   Maybe Tom Clancy is the King of All Media? Really. Now
he's coming to the console world -- the N64 specifically.
And so is his developer Red Storm. Details at FGN. It's
today's second story.

   Oh, durn it. OtakuBoy made another boo-boo in Saturday's
Sleep-Deprivation Issue. IGN64 ran a nifty news story about
a game called WINBack that I thought was "Romance of The
Kingdom." It's not! It's "WINBack," a spy, action shooter
to take on the likes-a Goldeneye. Check it out at IGN64.
OtakuBoy has cut off a digit in regret.

   Anyway, also on IGN64, "Fox Sports College Hoops" is the
POOPS! Check out IGN64's review. And Gaming-Age wants to know,
did you find Mario in Zelda yet? Did ya? Check out the
titillating pictures on Gaming-Age.


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   Ah, Sega X. You can always count on them to have at 
least a few news and features published before anyone else
does. What devotion!

   For instance, here's what you can do there today!

*  Download the ENTIRE "Shenmue" video, all 6 megs of it.

*  Download screen shots for PowerStone and Seventh Cross.

*  Read about how Sega Europe will introduce the Dreamcast.

*  And, last but not least, read that PenPen is not the bad
   game everyone pretends it to be. Oh, no no! In fact, 
   "PenPen Tricelon" is the surprise hit of Dreamcast! (?!)
   Plus, download tons o' pics and movies.

      W                O                 W              !


Multi-format

   Very, very soon you could be playing Cricket and Rugby
on your game machine! Who says? EA Sports! That's who! And
FGNOnline wrote down every detail.

Cheers, folks.

             See a cool story? Send it to me!
