   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game zines -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to get them all.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   I swear! If you connect to OtakuBoy #3 to #4 , they
balance each other and float in the air. This is 
because this issue puts all the Dreamcast info way down
below to move other news and stuff up toward the top. Let's
give the other consoles some air today, mm-kay? 

-----------

   Lotsa sites had cars on the brain today. Why? I have
no clue. Peter Oliver reviews "R4 Ridge Racer" (PSX) at 
Consoledomain.com. (It's worth a read for the special 
feature in the game that ole Peter talks about.) More car
stuff at Videogames.com as Jeff Gerstmann reviews Crusin'
World (N64). (I just have to know. First, Crusin' USA.
Then, Crusin' World. What's next? Crusin' Hell? Where in
The World is Carmen Sandiego Crusin'? Crusin' Body Cavity
Search? How long can this go on? (this paragraph and the
Crusin'series)) Douglass Perry and IGN win best review of
the day. Douglass wrote a detailed Twisted Metal 3 review
where he proclaims it may be better than Vigilante 8! Oy
veh! There are also a whole bunch of links to screen
shots and movies. COOL!
   On to some other interesting stuff, mostly from FGN
Online, who had bang-up killer update this morning. First, 
they report new details about Castlevania 64, a title near
to OtakuBoy's heart. Secondly, also from FGN, Activision 
steps up to produce a new X-Men fighting title. Details
@ FGN. Check out Console City's PSXMax news for info about
a new version of PSX designed to foil chip modders, and for
info about a new line of Lara Croft action figures, inclu-
ding one with Lara in crotch-less panties. (Did I say that?
I meant a wet suit. You see, that's why you have to read it
from the source (Console City) to get the full story.)
Consoledomain.com reviews TimeShock, super pinball game
for PSX. Reviewer "Andrew L" is really impressed but one
thing befuddles the poor guy. Check it out. A couple sites
report that Mission Impossible, that silly N64 game, beat
the 1,000,000 sales mark. WHAT?!?! Digital-Ages has a good
"why theory." And James Fudge reports from Games.net news
about "voodoo-themed action game" Akuji the Heartless.
   There's a new Gameboy emu out. This news comes from...
Where else? Daves Classics. (He's capitalizing.) I don't
know if I really care about another GameBoy emu, but this
name -- BoyCott -- is just funny. Oh, if you're a-lookin'
for emu news, it's worth a surf to Insert Coin, especially
when you want news about Retrocade! Oh, don't know what
it is? Just a totally cool emu with full (coming) support
for sound, and extreme attention to one thing emus don't
pay much attention to -- original running speed. (Retro's
an arcade emu.) Insert Coin has good coverage of Retrocade.
   Ok, ok. Here's your Dreamcast. Not much big news
today. (As OtakuBoy Online and Vid-game site readers know,
yesterday Sega ran a big conference where they confirmed a
lot of stuff. E-mail Otakuboy@bigfoot.com for the stuff,
if you missed it.) There was, however a lot of fleshing out
and re-analysis. Dreamcast.IGN updated their site big-
time. What they say? Well, first, NAMCO has signed up to be
a DC player. (You see, Dreamcast.IGN quivers at the thought
of a DC Tekken 4.) Dreamcast.IGN also fleshes out a story
reported yesterday on numerous sites about Biohazard:
Code Veronica (Biohazard) for DC. But Dreamcast.IGN
pisses me off with the same story. On IGN's cover they say,
"we've seen it," and then, inside, cop out with "words
can't describe how beautiful it is." Baloney. Can you see
baloney? I can describe it!
   FGN reports that Crystal Dynamics has decided
against DC for some of its titles, unless... well, just
check it out. FGN also reports, with a little help from
DreamCaster.net (check there for the more detailed info)
that Web TV (SURPRISE!!!!!!!!!!!!) will become a player
in DreamCast's online ventures. Oh, will wonders never 
cease? Sega Otaku shows an interesting picture of the
Japanese DC final packaging, including a couple of
peripheral. (It seems like there's more in the shot, but
it's under a glass or plastic case and the overhead lights
blind.)
   And if you just haven't had enough Dreamcast, check out
Dreamcaster.net the laser pen Sega handed out at ECTS.
Sure to be a collector's item. And much more durable if
you want to do anything similiar to what Monica Lewinsky
did. Oh my.
   (oh and bitchx says dreamcast sux, yeah whatever)
