   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Lotsa questions roll in to the OtakuBoy e-mail box:
   Otaku-ster, do you like plaid? 

   Well, I can only answer this way: No. Rather, I like pat-
terns that look like computer chips. Lotsa silvery lines and
stuff. I like to sit in a dark room and think about the 
specs... what kinda processin' power does all that have BOY!
That gets me WOIKED UP!

-----------

PlayStation (PSX)

   Which is why I'm having a terrible time controlling my-
self while reading the story on Next-Generation Online,
which details all the specs of the upcomin' Toshiba-brand
chip. You know that everyone's like all excited that this
could be THE processin' power behind the next PlayStation.
Yep. Feel the titter on Next-Generation Online.

   And speaking of a-titter, Re:Tokyo continues their mind-
splitting special tribute to FINAL FANTASY VIII. Part 3
details stuff about the flying ship, a few more characters,
and a grand bit about the battle system. (No way to control
it. It's totally automatic. (Actually, that's not entirely
true. Rather those two sentences are song lyrics and some-
thing about the battle system reminded me of it.)) Oh, and
it talks a bit about the Chocobo PocketStation games.

   Uber-Contributor Tansu sent in this bit: Videogames.com
updated their preview of ALIEN RESURRECTION. And WHY did 
they do this? Because they love you, I think. Actually, it's
because GameSpot snagged an interview with Gary Sheinwald,
a producer over at Fox Interactive, A.R.'s developer. (I'm
sorry, Videogames.com doesn't love you.) I have two links,
one to the interview, one to the updated preview.

   You see, there's this super RPG called SaGa FRONTIER 2.
And, you see, a lot of people are excited. So, you see, 
OtakuBoy must find cool stuff on the Web. Well, Magic Box
has a really nice size preview of the game inside all the
other news bits Mr. Magic Box is known to post. This preview
has super amounts of info about the gameplay and LOTS of
pictures. Oh my. Also on Magic Box, new info on SNK's KING
OF FIGHTERS 98! 

   You see, I am down here in New Orleans. South Louisiana.
The "Sportsman's Paradise," they call it. Well, they call it
that because a lot of people around here like to fish. (I
just like to eat.) So, I'm sure we're all going to be a-tit-
tering over FISHERMAN'S BAIT, which is a-comin' out this
month from Konami. Hey, maybe you're interested in it, too?
Check out PSXMax for the info.

   Got Techu 2? How about Tenchu 3? 4? IGNPSX spies a news-
paper article in Japan that reports Sony is going to make
TENCHU a big ultra-huge series. Meanwhile, GameSpot spies
work that PERSONA 2: TUSMI is comin' out. This is an Atlus
RPG series based on MEGAMI TENSEI. Oh, come on! You know
what I mean. OH, stop foolin. (Pssst... anyone know what
this series is should e-mail me! Otakuboy@bigfoot.com :(

   Heh. GameInformer ran a preview of a Capcom snowboarding
game, TRICKY SLIDERS, waaaaay back on 1/19. Well, since 
then, they've found that a RESIDENT EVIL character -- a 
SECRET Resident Evil character no less -- will be in TRICKY
SLIDERS! I have two links: One to the story about the char-
acter, another to the preview. And speaking of previews,
IGNPSX previews BUST-A-MOVE 2.

   WOAH! More from TANSU! He ROCKS! First, the ole boy says
that over on Videogames.com is a super new preview of SILENT
HILL, Konami's upcoming Resident Evil killer (so they say).
Tansu, still on Videogames.com, also spies a preview of
NEEDS FOR SPEED: HIGH STAKES. I saw one on IGNPSX and I have
to say that the Videogames.com one has better info. Also
Tansu-Approved (I hope he'll write an introduction so you
guys no who I'm talking about!): A preview on Videogames.com
of LUFIA IIIL RUIN CHASERS. Watch how the previewer details
the long (and winding) road this RPG took to finally get to
the PlayStation.

   PSXMax previews GUARDIAN'S CRUSADE. They call it, the 
"cartoony" RPG. And I must say, they're right. Check it
out. Over on Game Informer, news about SHAO LIN, a FOUR
PLAYER FIGHTER. (Drawn by the man who drew Gundam 0083, for
you anime fans!) And, yes! Just like in the TV Series
KUNG FU, this game will have strength and agility test.
"It is said: One must not eat spicy food and stand next to
flame."

   Over the weekend, THREE people contacted OtakuBoy in ICQ
to tell him how excited they are that GRANDIA, the Saturn
RPG, is comin' to PlayStation. EXCITED, they are. So, ole
OtakuBoy's done some checking. I found an OLD review from 
back in da day when the game first debuted on Saturn. It's
on the old Videogames.com (when it was called NUKE).

   Heh. This is a neat review. PlayStationFAN has a mini-
review of the PAL version of Metal Gear Solid. Seems like
a UK mag has included the demo on a disc they sent out
recently. Check it out. Also on PlayStationFan, cool news
for anyone who likes the PlayStation. Read about the man
who changed his name to...

   Sony PlayStation.


===========OTAKUBOY SAY TO VISIT THIS DUDE, EH!=============
              What are people saying about the
               Multiverser role playing game?

            "Multiverser is great for everyone."
                  --Christopher R. Jones 

      This is the game that makes good use of all the
             crap that you bought in the past.

         http://members.aol.com/NagaWorld/mv.html 
============================================================


Nintendo 64 (N64)

   WWhat? A 64DD RRelease DDate? Yeah, yeah. We've heard
this one before haven't we? Well, Gaming-Age has another
date. *cynical sigh*

   IGN64 takes a long, cool look at HYBRID HEAVEN, what they
call a "futuristic" Metal Gear Solid and Konami's answer to
PARASITE EVE. Well. Well. It does look pretty cool. And the
story is a might interesting.

   A BIG NBA day over on Console Domain. They review BOTH
NBA JAM '99 and NBA LIVE '99. What's there to say about
JAM? "HEY! That AI is not very offensive!!!!" What's there
to say about the LIVE? "Hey you're HALF A PORT!"

   Nintendojo spied Yet Another Bug in Zelda (tm). Find out
how to get more bottles while fishin. And speaking of fish
and things food-ish, check out GameBoy Euro-Asia for POKEMON
FOOD pics! Gotta bite off all their heads and spit 'em down
the drain.


GameBoy Color (GBC)

   Speaking of GameBoy Euro-Asia, the ole boys have news
that CHESSMASTER is comin'. They's even gots pictures, too.
Boss! Also (today is a GameBoy Euro-Asia extravaganza!), 
Mario Golf to be 64GB compatible. Check out the pics. And,
finally, power up your GameBoy with these cool POKEMON
BATTERIES! Gotta hook the positive cable up to Pikachu's
head and the negative cable up to his bum.


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   Love that SegaX. The palsie-walsies of Sega-world have a
first-hand report on SEGA RALLY 2's modem play. It's Boss. 
It's also jiggy -- or somethin'. Oh, and SEGA RALLY 2 fans?
Fix your controllers. Seems over the weekend some people
have been finding out just how fragile their Dreamcast
controllers can be while playing SR2. Sega2000 tells you how
to fix it!

   UNDERCOVER un-wrapped! That's what SegaX did when they
found out more news on the mysterious title. Also on SegaX,
get yourself a Sun Heroic Tan. It's a mech game. 

   I can tell you first hand that in the far east, MAHJONG
is a big deal, high stakes game. But will it be so on 
Dreamcast's VMS?! Check out Dimention-S for info on that
and all the other card type games comin. Speakin' of VMS,
check out Gaming-Age for a pic of the SHENMUE VMS game. 
(Hey, it really came from Magic Box, but you don't have to
do a lot of scrollin' on Gaming-Age.) Another VMS-News-Note,
Magic Box reports that soon you'll be able to download a 
small file to your VMS and when you play it during SONIC,
it will explain the menu items IN ENGLISH! 

   Sega-Otaku has a big preview of POP N MUSIC. Heh. Check
out the cool references to that old board game, Trouble. 
It's Pop-O-Matic fun! Over on a fan site I spied over the
weekend, a tiny preview of GRANDIA 2 for Dreamcast. (You
see, this ties in with that GRANDIA stuff in the PSX sec-
tion. I is clever or something.)

   Lower your heads. Gaming-Age reviews what could be the
very last U.S. Saturn title MAGIC KNIGHT RAYEARTH, an RPG.
And, Dreamcast-finally, a page from Sega's Web site about
PUYO PUYO. It's entirely Japanese, but the graphics are 
cool.


Multi-Format & Misc

   Hey! We barely ever put stuff about the super secret
NUON console. So, here's a interview posted on VideogameNews
with Jeff Minter of Llamasoft. He talks about NUON AND
TEMPEST 3000!

   Go to Gaming-Age to check out all the available colors
for Neo-Geo Pocket. Boy, they look a might cool. And spea-
king of NGPocket, check out Magic Box for more info on
KING OF FIGHTER ROUND 2. They've got good pics, too.


Site Announcement

   WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Console City relaunched
Dreamcast Insider the other day. Some of you may remember
this site from earlier OtakuBoys. But, if I may say so, this
D.I. was never updated much. Now they've got a new staff
and everything!

   Also in the site announcement list, a COOL COLL site 
that focuses square on gaming soundtracks. Yep, all those
CD's you occasionally spy that are like the soundtrack to
Street Fighter? Well, this site has links to ALL of them
with reviews, previews and everything. You gotta check it
out. It's called Soundtrack Central.


Cherrios, folks! (Rice Krispies, Cocoa Puffs, etc.)

       See a cool story? cool site? Send it to me!
