   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

   YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW! Lots of nifty, nifty stuff about the 
PSX2 tonight! Super, super stuff. I'm so excite, I just 
messed my pants. Hmmm... I wonder if the laundromat is open
this late?

-- A confirmation? PSX2 to be revealed?? - News
   Hmmmm.. PSXMax reports that CJNN, a computing magazine in
Japan, has said that Sony WILL introduce a prototype at the
big-wig convention in March. I'm horribly septible. I'm
skeptical, too. Also, my butt hurts. (Where did that come
from?) You see, guys, lots of people have been wondering
whether we'll see the PSX2 here. Is CJNN just goin' out on
a limb?

-- Sony speaks to EETimes - News
   Well, well, well. Looks like Sony doesn't understand the
idea that LOOSE LIPS, SINK SHIPS! (Heh. That's really funny.
But you have to understand the context of the phrase. -
Literary OtakuBoy.) Anyhoo, a couple of Sony engineers,
including Ken Kutaragi, spoke on their new chip to EETimes
and revealed what they'd like to do.

-- FF8, Square and the NEXT consoles! - News
   Well, well, well. Good ole GameSpot spies an article with
quotes from Square's head. He talks about the PlayStation,
the next PlayStation, FF8 and what the next RPGs could look
like. It's the kind of mind-blowing quotes you've come to
expect from the videogaming world.

-- WOW! Designer Diary for MK:SF - Interview
   This is huge. Block off nine bazillion hours to read, ok?
Videogames.com calls it a Designer Diary, but it's more like
a really long interview with members of the MORTAL KOMBAT:
SPECIAL FORCES design team. Really extensive. Eep. Read.
Consume.

   FGNOnline reports that Enix has delayed DRAGON QUEST VII!
NOOOOOOOOOO! Why GOD? WHY?!?!?! Check out FGNOnline for the
details. Don't fret too much, though. Check out GameFan for
links to brand new movies of the game in ACTION! Mr. De 
Mille, I'm ready for my CLOSE UP!

-- Shadow Madness - Movie/Preview
   Do you like games that seem to be clones of others? I
don't know if that's true, but GameFan says SHADOW MADNESS
is a clone of FFVII. See if you agree. They have a movie.
RPGamer has the introduction movie!

-- Guardian's Crusade - Review
   Knight? Meet Baby. Treat Baby right and he'll be like a
Pokemon, turn into something and kick your enemies' butts.
Also, make sure you look in every nook and cranny, even
where the sun don't shine. Those toys you're gonna find
everywhere can help you out in the long run. Don't know what
I'm talking about? It's GUARDIAN'S CRUSADE, a wacky RPG.
Console Domain reviews. The one on GameCenter is good one,
too, with a few thoughts from the translators.

I like it. And I give you my battle-worn, stretch-marked

-- Dragon Quest? - News
   This is an example of what OTAKUBOY tries to do for you.
GameFan ran a story about someone from ENIX, creator of the
Dragon Quest series, noting on a radio show that he'd like
to see DRAGON QUEST I - III on GameBoy Color. But, GameFan
said, this was only a wish. Well, kids, GameInformer has
pics. Maybe it's all a hoax, but the GameInformer pics look
pretty good.
