   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Oh Ho HO! Short issue tonight folks. Lotta sites took
the whole weekend off. Wish I could do that! WEEEEEEEEP!

-----------

PlayStation (PSX) 

   IGNPSX runs a little features that links to all the IGN
previews of 1999 PSX titles. Wow! 


Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   Nintendojo has a couple of nifty pieces tonight. First,
a report on the NEW titles comin' from Utopia. One's called
"Montezuma's Revenge," a port of a PC title. And no, it has
nothing to do with gastro-intestinal problems. The second
feature -- or news story -- explains how the upcoming "Micro
Machines 64" will support 8!!!! simultaneous players! WOW!

   IGN64 updates their "Castlevania 64" preview with some 
new pics and stuff. Worth seeing? Yeah, especially if you
like the obligatory clock towers in every Castlevania game.

   The Nth Dimension (BACK FROM SERVER PURGATORY -- details
there) reviews "WCW VS. nWo Revenge." And I know nothing
about wrestling, so I'm not gonna comment at all!

   Cool! Decent bit of GameBoy Color stuff tonight. First,
Console Domain reviews "Zelda DX" and "Tetris DX," now in
their full colorized glory! Nintendojo's GBC section reviews
"The Game & Watch Gallery 2." Don't remember the Game &
Watches? Oh, they were the little LCD games you could buy
back in the 80s. Really cool. At least >I< think so! (Of
course, every game is cool, when you're an OTAKUBOY!)


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   Lotsa stuff on Sega X tonight for your Dreamcast fetish.
First, they reprint an interview from Asia Biztech who 
talked towith Irimajiri, a Sega d00d, who spoke on the
Dreamcast's chances. 

   Also? A new Sonic walkthrough. This time, it's the 
Knuckles character.

   Also? A story about Dreamcast promotions in Japan!

   Ah, Sega X. Good to the last byte.


Multi-format & Misc

   Hype.se comes out of their slumber to feature something
really big -- a multi-format listing of every game comin'
in 1999! COOOOOOL! Get your 1999 videogame bearings there!

Cheers, folks.

             See a cool story? Send it to me!
