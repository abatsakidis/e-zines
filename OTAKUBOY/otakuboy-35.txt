   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

    ConsoleCity is three (click) three (click) three (click)
three sites in one! First, there's PSXMax, a premier PSXsite
with all things PlayStation. (You have to check out
Kingboxer's Rumor Mill!) Then there's The Nth Dimension, 
with their oft-scoops on cool movies. And, finally, there's
Dreamcast Insider, which sticks to Dreamcast like cooked
rice sticks to a bride and groom. 

   OtakuBoy's always heading there for the latest info.
Why not you?

   Hiya folksies!

   OtakuBoy here with a quick-quick version of today's best
videogaming links! "MUST-CLICK-WEBBY," I call it, with apolo-
gies to NBC. Hey Iraq! Boom.

   Don't forget! OtakuBoy wants YOU to join the staff. 
Honest! Details at OtakuBoy@bigfoot.com.

-----------

Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   So, what's this I hear about a NEW Nintendo? The N2000?
Maybe the N2001? Oh, we've heard it all before from Nintendo
though. So many products. So much vapor-ware. Sony Play
Station/Super Nintendo CD-ROM, anyone? Anyway, IGN64 prints
some comments from Nintendo's chief about their next steps.

   Alright! Bomberman's bursting (with apologies to Iraq)
back on to the N64. IGN64 has the details. 

   GameFan casts a preview eye on "Re-Volt. Get this: You
drive an RV car around all kinds of cool tracks -- like
an arcade! And what's that on the screen in the background?
POLE POSITION? Check out GameFan for the preview.

   Ever had a hankerin' to encase your Pocket GameBoy in
rubber? Suuuure, you have. "oooh, gameboy-baby. i want you
in between mah sheets, all wrapped up in that rubber you be
havin' on!" Anyway, if you've ever wondered how a G-Shock
GameBoy might look, head on over to GameBoy Euro-Asia. 


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   "Street Fighter EX 2" comin' Dreamcast? GameSpot has
very skimpy details and a denial from Capcom. (Hey, does
this even qualify as a rumor? 'We heard Capcom will make
blueberry biscuits. Capcom's says no, but we heard it!')

   Sonic goes 56k! Honest. Looks like folks in Japan will
be able to put their Passport modems to good use while 
playin' with ole Blue Boy. Swap characters and all that 
cool stuff. GameSpot's got the story.

   And what's this? "Tetris 4D?" Tetris in the Fourth
Dimension? The Doctor would be proud! "Quick! To the 
Tardis!" Well, what does 4D mean, exactly? Check out
the preview at SegaX, uber-Sega site.


PlayStation (PSX) 

   Capcom sez: "Hey, PlayStation, you're like sooo un-cool,
you know what I mean? We've just, like, used up all of your
power and stuff and we ain't gonna do no more games on you
no more!" REALLY?! It's one of the many rumors that good
old KingBoxer has in his new installment on Console City's
PSXMax!

   What happens when She-Hulk rips off her bikini top? Why,
she uses it as a weapon against the Street Fighters, you
silly goose! IGNPSX has the preview of the upcoming Capcom
classic! (See? It ain't even out and it's already a classic!
Wow! What a triumph!)

   Speaking of Street Fighter, GameCenter.com reviews the
"Street Fighter Collection." Dying to play Street Fighters
old and new? Dying to master every single Street Fighter
game? Dying to punch-kick-punch until the wee-hours? Dying 
to... er, sorry.


Multi-format

   Hey, it seems like arcade and console technologies are
comin' so close together with new gadgets like Dreamcast
right? Well, in case you're interested in what's comin'
down to the arcade, Game-Online previews "Dragon
Valor." Lots of big pics, so bring all 56 of your K's. 

Cheers, folks.

             See a cool story? Send it to me!
