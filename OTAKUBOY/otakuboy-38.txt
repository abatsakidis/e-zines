   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Hello dere!

   First, I have some GREAT news to counter last ish's bad
news. ConsoleCity is BACK! No, OtakuBOYEEE didn't err. At
the time, ConsoleCity people told me the site was gone. 

   But they suddenly got a hosting offer. So, they'll be 
comin' back! I'll let you know when.

   How wuz yer Christmas? I gots a N64, Zelda, and MediEvil
for my PSX. Oh my, I am quite the busy Otaku. MediEvil is 
fun, but I'm not sure of how to beat that Stained Glass
Beast! Zelda is amazing, but why does Nintendo have to 
stick in those classic bloopy SOOOO-Nintendo sounds?

Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   But while I'm having fun trekkin' through Zelda's merry
world, I'd much rather be one of the lucky bastards playin'
Sonic Adventure for Dreamcast this weeked. For those of you
that don't know it, blue-boy launched himself in Japan a
couple-a days ago. Sega-Otaku has the story of the launch
with one cool picture.

   Since the launch, a bunch of sites have posted their 
"hands ons," "first-impressions," etc. -- Console Domain,
Sega-Otaku, SegaNet, SegaX, and GameSpot. If you want length
and detail, I suggest Console Domain, Sega-Otaku, and 
Sega X. If you want cool pics and movies, check out SegaNet
and Gaming-Age. Want REAL BRIEF? GameSpot. (To be sure, 
though, GameSpot doesn't pretend to review the title, they're
just telling you they have it.)

   Only a couple of sites noted the Christmas Day easter-egg
in Sonic Adventure -- GameFan, among them. (A Christmas tree
appears right inside the game!) A big kudos, however, goes
to Sega X, for posting a nifty picture of it in their
hands-on review. And speaking of seeing things Sonic-ish,
check out Sega-Otaku's look at the Sonic Manual!

   A couple of new titles snuck in under the Christmas dead-
line. SegaX has news of Panasonic/Sega's "Web Mystery." Not
much is known on it yet, so don't go lookin' for a big pre-
view. Also, not much is known about the new "Under Cover,"
which showed up in a magazine ad in Japan. GameSpot has that
news.


Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   Nintendojo suddenly realized how many controllers were
available for the N64. So, they put them all together and
created reviews for each them. It's a feature entitled, 
"It's ALL in The Control!" And, jeez, why the heck do we 
have so many controllers for the N64?

   64Source wraps up their Turok 2, Project Leader Inter-
view on their site. Speaking of interviews, IGN64 talks 
with Bill Goldberg of the WCW. There's a lot of grunting,
so a glossary is included. (Haha! Just kidding. Please don't
hurt MEEEEEEEEEEEE!) 

   IGN64 pontificates and fornicates (er.. hmmm) about why
the N64 is not selling in Europe. It's more than an editor-
ial, more than a feature, it's gosh-darn trolling material!
Get out yer flame-throwers. (For those of you who don't know
what "trolling" is, it's when a UseNet for forum participant
pops into a newsgroup -- N64, for example -- and says, "I
think the PSX RULEZZZZZZZZZZ, D00dz!" Usually such messages
are followed by 956 messages from people who disagree with
the person. What the well-intended repliers don't realize,
though, is that the original poster INTENDED to cause a
ruckus. He's "trolling" for a flame-fest.)

   Speaking of N64 sales, both GameFan and Gamespot report
on the recent Japanese console-sales numbers. GameFan says
that the N64 shows a better showing, but don't provide any
historical numbers. Still, it's good to see where you fav
console places.

   Hey, did you get Zelda for Christmas like me? Well, 
Nintendojo is not one to let a good bug go unnoticed, and
if you head on over to their Web site this weekend, you'll
get a list of the latest bugs. NO, the background graphics
are NOT supposed to occasionally blink out.

   IGN64 has a nice big preview of "Perfect Dark," with new
shots straight from the RARE site. Nintendojo takes a look
at "Looney Tunes Space Race!"

   In GameBoy news, GameBoy Euro-Asia reports about a couple
of things from uber-develop, Atlus -- first, a new RPG for
GameBoy Color and, er... , a weird game called "Hamster
Paradise." It's Tamagotchi with domesticated rodents! COOL!


PlayStation (PSX) 

   And this could possibly be the tiniest PlayStation sec-
tion ever in O.O. 

   First, if you just happened to have gotten your first
PlayStation this Christmas -- or even recently -- I recom-
mend the "PlayStation for Dummies" feature of on Videogames.

   Second, PlayStationFAN has a new interview with Hideo
Kojima, project director for "Metal Gear Solid."

   Third, Game-Online gets what they call an "exclusive"
from Psygnosis about "Kingsely," their new in-development
title. This is an especially good article if you're tired
of all the durn bad news coming from Psygnosis.

of your game boxes? Some of them have a big "T" for in-
stance. These are ratings. Wanna know more about the organi-

thingy. ;)
