   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game zines -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to get them all.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Apparently, there were no compromising photos of Sonic
and Crash in the Tokyo Game Show's men's room. I think
they were erased, though. Art Bell?! Where are you?!
   Hey, don't forget to tell your friends about OtakuBoy.
While you're at it, tell your enemies! It's not a dis-
cussion list. The little buggers can't bother you here.
   Lots of nifty, nifty stuff today. Now that Dreamcast
was the first to step out, were hearing more and more about
PSX2 and, now, the next Nintendo?! Oh my! Let the NEXT3
(cubed) Generation wars begin!

-----------

   As we led yesterday with rumors of a new Playstation
(PSX), so now we must lead with a very brief story on 
Fastest Gaming News (FGN) about a new Nintendo! Now,
what could we name this one? Nintendo 128? Nintendo "Haha
we still don't like CD-Rom" Entertainment System? 
REM-Sleep (Get it? Dreamcast? REM-Sleep? AHAHAHAHAH!)
   In other big news, "Turok 2" shows up on, of all places,
Nintendo in-store demos. Many sites carry this news, but
64 Source goes out to see it -- and gives you their im-
pressions. Speaking of things on TV, Videogames.Com spies
a Japanese television ad for "Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina
of Time." What are their thoughts? Details there. 
   Today is a day for numbers, too. 64 Source reports on
sales rankings at retail stores in Southwest. How scien-
tific is this? I'm afraid you'll have to ask them. :P Also,
N64Gamer (NEW SITE To OTAKUBOY!) posts Nintendo cart rental
rankings in their 10.9 news. GameBoy shows it's true colors
on FGN. Well, not exactly. You can see text in FGN's story,
but that's about it, fellas. 
   On to reviews and thingies: NintenDOJO has a small but
full-a-pics preview of "Hype." You could call it hype for
Hype! Ha! I kill me! IGN64 runs a very good feature on 
"Rush 2" and its stunt mode. I think IGN64 advocates a 
whole game-a this stuff. Tell me if that's what they 
mean: Otakuboy@bigfoot.com. Game Assault runs with another
good review. This time it's "Banjo Kazooie." Now, if these
reviews could just come out much sooner, but I undress.
   Oh, and if you're dying to write your own Zelda adven-
ture, you simply must head on over to Hyrule: The Land of
Zelda 64 and contribute to their on-going, graffitti-
inspired, story-fest. Will Link manage to clear his nasal
passages? Tune in tomorrow! (E-mail "Link Mucus Samples,"
properly labelled, to Otakuboy@bigfoot.com.)
   GameFan claims -- claims -- that Playstation2 (PSX2) is
closer than we think. Do you believe them? E-Mail me! 
Meanwhile, Sony tries damage control. This is how it goes:
"Dreamcast is sucky because red is the color of fire and 
no one likes fire except cavemen and they're all dead." 
Believe me? Nah. GameFan runs an analysis of Sony's "answer"
to recent Sega announcements.
   IGNPSX runs a nifty, updated list of PSX Dual Shock 
Titles. The list keeps growing. (Personal note: "Metal Gear
Solid" rulez because of Dual Shock.) Videogames.com runs
preview shots of the upcoming "Alien Ressurection," from
FOX! And IGNPSX runs a wee-bit-of-a-story on "Monster
Rancher 2". Check out the preview of "The Diabolical
Adventures of Tofu." No, wait. I mean "Tobu." I'm
terribly sorry. There's no going back and changing stuff
once it's in print, though. Console City's PSXMax slathers
up the tofu for you. Ooh, and they also have a preview of
"Uprising X." Check it out.
   Hey, does "Ninja" live up to the hype? Don't ask me;
ask IGNPSX's reviewer, who apparently had a few choice words
with the master of stealth. And if you're up for something
a little differerent, HardCoreGaming checks out "Pool
Hustler." (Note to review sites: When you run a review,
run a screen shot. Please. Dear God, when will the no-shot 
pages end?!)
   Two -- count 'em -- TWO sites show off a new "Sonic
Adventure" movie. Videogames.com and IGNDreamcast. I gotta
be honest: I didn't download the IGNDreamcast movie. It 
says it's friggin' 14 MeGs! But if ya got a OC-48 runnin'
into your house, it might be tolerable. ;) Videogames.com's
copy is manageable -- 'bout three megs. But the picture is
smaller, so watch out. Oh, and another piece of advice:
When you play this movie, you want to turn your sound all
the way up to number 'ZERO!' It's typical music. "Hey,
we're part of the new, hip 'Heavy Metal' movement. We know
what gets kids excited about Sonic because we strain our
voices! Hire us for corporate work!" 
   The Tokyo Game Show stuff continues to roll in. When
will it end? When there's another industry event to cover,
you silly man! First, SegaX shows pictures of the new
Dreamcast CD cases. Anything special about them? E-mail
me. GameFan goes where Videogames.com went, where IGN went,
etc, with more "player-reviews" of Dreamcast titles. Ah,
maybe you just want to click GameFan's new package of
"Virtua Fighter 3" shots. And, to perhaps end the Tokyo
Game Show stuff once and for all -- right? right? -- 
Dreamcaster.net runs a "recap."
   And finally, speaking of Dreamcaster.net, they pull
the rug out from under Sega and question whether the
infamous "E3 Shooter" (Geist Force) was a fake?! How
could they--? WHY would they--? Who coulda--? 
   What's this? OddWorld at the Oscars? Games.net 
runs a story about the unlikely hero's appearance
next to the guy in gold. GameCenter profiles Super
Developer (tm) ToysforBob, makers of the fan-ta-bu-
lously cool titles "Archon," "Star Control," and
"The Unholy War." 
   And last, but not least: The Nth Dimension opens
up a new section: Desktop Themes! If you love playing
"dress-up" with Windows 95 or 98 (and you love (mostly)
Nintendo stuff), then this section is for you.
   Confidentially, I like my Super Suck 9000 Desktop Theme
just fiiiiine.
