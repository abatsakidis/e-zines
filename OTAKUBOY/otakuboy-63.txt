   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Ok, ok, ok. This is getting a wee bit ridiculous. I don't
know if Konami REALLY said this, but Game Informer says that
Konami said they're changing people's lives with DANCE DANCE
REVOLUTION? Well, I did feel a bit more pep after I finished
playing... but what's this about memory cards?


-----------

                 P l a y S t a t i o n (PSX)

-- Konami loves you. - News
   Konami says that by allowing you to insert your memory
cards into the arcade DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION, they are
changing people's live. Hmmmm... anyway. You can do this
memory card thing and more. Check out the details on GR.

-- PSX2 Release Date? - News
   Hmmmm... EDGE Magazine, U.K.'s brand videogaming mega-
opolis-zine, says the the PSX2 will be in Japan by year end.
:) Ok. Well, then, ahm, check out FGNOnline to see what
Sony UK sez to that.

-- "PSX2 Release Date?" 


-- Colony Wars 3 - News
   Goodie, goodie! GameFan says they've confirmed through
Psygnosis that COLONY WARS 3 is comin'! Wooohoooooooooooo!
They also drop a neat little tidbit (read: rumor) about
COLONY WARS 4. Oh what, oh what, console could that be for
... oh what oh what?
-- http://www.gamefan.com/newhotinfo/hotinfo.asp?storyid=477


-- Play Apocalypse or Mecha Gouki? - Rumor?
   Apocalypse? Mecha Gouki? Tooti Fruti? Scratch that last
one. Gamer's Republic hears that you can play those first
two characters somewhere in MARVEL SUPER HEROES vs. STREET
FIGHTER. Hmmm.. all you guys out there who have an incredi-
ble knack for finding secret stuff, get to FINDIN'!
-- http://www.gamersrepublic.com/02_22_1999n2.html


-- X-Men - Preview
   Ok, ok, so it's only 40% done and it seems like its been
development since Marvel published their first X-Men comic.
But Activision's X-MEN is comin'. It's comin'. Just as
Videogames.com, who got to play one. They report.
-- http://www.videogames.com/psx/fight/xmn/


-- Silent Hill - Review
   Yep. I gotta agree with this 8.8 here. SILENT HILL IS a
good game. It's a maddingly difficult, methinks. But it's by
far and away the neatest game to come along since Resident
Evil. Anyway, ConsoleCity's PSXMax reviews. Videogames.com
reviews also and their review looks at how well SH did the
whole horror thing. Plus they render a verdict -- why can't
you find good tasting chocolates in Whitman boxes? (Transla-
tion: Is it as good as RESIDENT EVIL?)

-- More on BIOHAZARD for N64 - News
   GameSpot has more news about BIOHAZARD: RESIDENT EVIL for
the N64. Mostly stuff about the title and a little bit about
the plot. I guess dem Capcommers are keepin' this one to
themselves for now. :(
-- http://headline.gamespot.com/news/99_02/22_vg_evil/index.html


-- Last Legion UX - Preview
   Heck, from that title, you wouldn't know that this is a
full-on, death battle, hoopla, shiiiite, full-metal-jacket,
cahuna, mecha fight to the death. But it is. It is. (Key:
Profound music. Fade to black. And.... CLICK!)
-- http://ign64.ign.com/previews/2191.html 


-- Lode Runner 3D - Preview
   Ok! Videogames.com previews LODE RUNNER 3D and unlike
they interview over at IGN64 last week, they take you
strictly through the game -- what's in it, what you're gonna
play, etc. Plus, loads of shots! LOADS! LOADS! (What are
loads, anyway?)
-- http://www.videogames.com/n64/puzcla/lode64/


-- All-Star Tennis '99 - Review
   What is with the Nintendo 64 these days? Mario fights
against his N-Brethren. NOW you can play Bomb Tennis in
which your ball leaves a bomb in its wake? What is this
machine becoming? What happened to cute, cuddly? Oh yeah,
that sucks. Game Informer has a hands on this game.

-- Powerprokun Pocket - News 
   Hmmm... it don't sound like no baseball game I ever hoid
of! And, yet, it is! IT IS! It's Konami's latest and it
looks like they're gonna let you transport player statistics
from your GBC to POWERFUL PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL on your N64.
Details on GR.

-- Spawn's... well... kinda cute - News/Preview
   Game Informer has news and pics about SPAWN comin' out
for GBC. And I gotta tell ya that it looks a might weird. I
mean, SPAWN's a really bad guy. Always has been. But on the
GBC, you just wanna pick him up and cuddle him. Well, maybe
that's a little too much. :(

-- A Saturn emulated on a DC? - Rumor
   This is cool. Word is Sega is workin' on a Saturn emu-
lator for the Dreamcast. And why NOT?! I mean, they could
then keep releasing Saturn games, saturate their resources
and markets, confuse consumers, and make everyone buy PSX2s!
Just kidding. But it would be neat to play all those old
Saturn titles. Sigh.
