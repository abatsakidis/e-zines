   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game zines -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to get them all.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Lots of mixed stuff today. But now that the Tokyo Game
Show is in full gear, we're starting to see better details
about upcoming Dreamcast stuff. Dreamcast, Shmeamcast. I am
so tired of DreamCast. I want the system; don't get 
OtakuBoy wrong. But it's hard to wade through the sites and
get at other things of import. Still, your fearless OtakuBoy
even braved an impaired Earthlink connection today find 
good stuff... and find he did.

-----------

   Let's start with the N64 this time. Poor N64. With all
the Dreamcast info, they've been pushed aside and squashed
under the very feet of the gaming press. STOMP! Photo cap-
tion seen at Tokyo Game Show: Bloody Mario staggers to 
feet after mob of Dreamcast-huntin' press chase Sega
President.
   Big review of "NASCAR '99" over at Videogames.com last 
night. Not much that's terribly interesting in it -- from
my point of view -- but, for all you racing fans, here's 
another racing title. Plus, the reviewer has a stunning
revelation for those of you who are just barely interested
in Nascar. Couple of dinosaur games made the videogame
sites today... Well, they're very nearly the same title. ;)
The Nth Dimension reviews "Turok: Dinosaur Hunter," while 
IGN64 previews Turok 2: Seeds of Evil. This "preview" is
damn near a review; it's that detailed. Be sure you check 
it out. And I can't help but be wowed by the screen shots!
I had to make sure I was looking at an N64 site and not a
PC site. Videogames.com runs with a preview of "BattleTanx,"
a new game from 3D0. The game's premise is just really
freaky. Also, IGN64 reviews "Crusin' World." Remember?
Videogames.com just did that one, too. So, maybe you want
to compare reviews and reviewers? 

   We must start off PSX coverage with news of friendly-
neighborhood pirate busts. FGN covers an announcement 
from Sony about one such bust in Miami. GameAssault
reports on a similar event in Singapore. Apparently, 
they arrested Arthur C. Clarke.. NO NO NO NO! I'm 
Kidding! 
   Hey! Wanna know all about PSX2? Yeah, me too. OtakuBoy
spy a fan page that has all the PSX2 rumors-2-date,
including possible technical stats. Gotta tell you, though,
the idea that the PSX2 is going to be the size and shape of
a dildo, I think, is way off. IGNPSX covers EA's side of 
the story on the decision not to publish Thrill Kill. 
Apparently, it's too bloody or some nonsense. HAH! Check 
it out. Videogames.com also has a set of new PSX "Driver"
screens. Looks like a car chase game to me. But if that 
doesn't grab you, at least the cool "History of Metal
Gear" feature will. Find out about Snake, Liquid Snake,
The Nation of Outer Heaven, The Fox Hound Space Seals,
and more. This, of course, is on the heels of the
excitement over "Metal Gear Solid." (Metal Gear Hollow
turned out to be vaporware.) ConsoleDomain runs a preview
on Square's upcoming RPG Xenogears. It's got a LATE October
release. So, there's not much time to even read a preview.
Oh, and HEY!!!! what's this? Elevator Action for PSX? True?
Not? This and other rumors compiled by KingBoxer at 
ConsoleDomain. Oh, one last item: Remember "Military 
Madness," a strategy game for the TurboGrafx? Yeah,
neither do I. And yet there's a sequel on hand for PSX.
Check out Videogames.com.

   Ok, Dreamcast otaku. Ready for your daily dose? Hope you
got a few days free to check out all these links.
   Fastest Gaming News (FGN) publishes a slew of what can
best be called "player reviews." They're not exactly re-
views; they're too cursory. And they're not exactly pre-
views; no screens. But a "roving reporter" gets a quick
play of "Godzilla Generations," "July" (what an odd
name!), and "Pen Pen Triathalon," which FGN touts as DC's
answer to Diddy Kong Racing. Incidentally, the "July"
review drops a very unfortunate bombshell. (Can a bomb-
shell be "fortunate?")
   Here's a fortunate bombshell. :) Videogames.com drops
a bunch of "Biohazard: Code Name Veronica" (RESIDENT EVIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) screens today. Oh, you gotta see.
Much better than yesterday's cop-out "words can't
describe" from FGN. Still FGN today steps up with some
great details on "Geist Force." (OtakuBoy readers will
remember that Videogames.com reported they saw a print ad
for Geist Force, at that time an unannounced title.)
FGN also keeps hitting with some major stories, including
sourced info on a Virtua Fighter RPG, and info that
"Incoming Alert" will be available at DC's launch date. 
Also, at FGN (told you they "rule" today), check out their
report on how Sega will market DC in Japan.
   ConsoleDomain hits with some very good specials and news
reports on DC. First, they're just really nice guys for
breaking up all the DC release info (machine and games)
into an easy-2-read table with prices and release dates. 
Very cool. Also, they do a simply bang-up, good report of
Sega's DC unveiling in Europe. But, notice the little
discrepency between Sega's Japan and Europe remarks on
whether Sonic will be ready at DC launch? What could it
mean? Send answers to Otakuboy@bigfoot.com. Also, check out
ConsoleDomain's report on all the DC games to come so far.
Very good details.
   Console City's Dreamcast Insider breaks down, in "easy to
read" language, DC's specs. Tell me if you understand it.
Dreamcaster.net runs a story about a DC game that 
will accomodate up to 1,000 players! And more?! WOW! (Well,
maybe not. It has to WORK!) Also, Dreamcaster.net separates
the facts from the fiction, the wheat from the chaff, and
various other cliches which, ultimately, mean showing only
the facts. These facts are: Who DC's true competition?
It's not who you think. It's not! IT'S NOT! Finally,
IGNDreamcast repots how Godzilla will run in that little
PDA/LCD thing.

   Whew, boy are my arms tired. Here comes the home
stretch -- staccato pace. Keep up!
  EA drops prices on some of the sports titles. Which
ones? FGN! Also, FGN covers a report that Psygnosis 
shuts down a Manchester, England office! GameCenter
runs a neat feature on what games top developers would
bring with them to a desert island. And, this one from a
reader: Did you know people STILL develop for the Jaguar?!
WOW! Well, apparently, though, there's a real hang-up on
a much anticipated BattleSphere. Details at Jaguar Dome.

OtakuBYE!
