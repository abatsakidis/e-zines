   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online video game zines -- even on sites you've never heard
of before -- to scour out the best features, reviews, pre-
views, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where to get them
all. OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================
   OtakuBoy sometime start to type and he not know where he
go. OtakuBoy have bad cold. Fans of OtakuBoy must forgive.
   Still, OtakuBoy find lots of cool stuff on the sites 
today, even one item about Pokemon on a little known site
with a .se designation. And, hey, Videogames.com pubbed some
pretty cool stuff today. Looks like IGN slept today -- at
least as of 5p eastern. Not much new on their site! But
the sleeper will awaken! Three bars of soap to the first
person who names that quote.

   Look dudes and dudettes, I want to make this newsletter
better fer ya. So send some comments at my e-mail address:
Otakuboy@bigfoot.com

   And, hey, if you work for one of those vid-gaming sites,
e-mail some news about what you're gonna pub in the future:

   Ladies and Gentlemen, feast your eyes on a full-on walk-
through of the supercool Playstation RPG Parasite Eve on
Videogames.Com, written by Expert Gamer Staffer Andrew
Baran. Pay no attention to the magazine subscription sales-
man behind the virtual curtain; this walk-through's got
some good shit. Did you know that certain sounds cue you 
to make certain actions? How about that the closer you are
to your target, the more damage you do. Yeah, well you
probably knew that. But there's an equal amount of stuff
in here you don't know and they've drawn up some cool
level maps. And, besides, it's cheaper than that durn
strategy guide. Also, buried in Gamespot's news is a new
DreamCast title that has apparently slipped in under
the Japanese media radar. It's called GeistForce, "a 
cinematic sci-fi shooting game set on a fictional
planet," according to Videogames.com's Yutaka Ohbuchi. A
quick glance around the sites shows that Gamespot is the
only one reporting this, so feast your eyes! Also, check
out the preview for the new PSX Lemmings.
   OHOOHOHOH COOL! Retro Radio just posted a new episode.
Don't know about Retro Radio?? It's an online radio show
(RealAudio G2 enabled) all about the emu-scene, hosted
by Shane Monroe. It's a pretty sparse episode, to be sure,
but it's got some very cool information for those who
want to start a arcade game collection. Shane doesn't have
the streaming file up, so you gotta download the archive
file ('bout 30 mins at 28.8) so, maybe you wanna wait 'til
he gets the stream or the text transcript up.
   It bears repeating again: "I AM NOT A PROGRAMMER!" Ahem.
Still, whenever you put the word "war" on something -- even
if it's something I don't understand -- I'm gonna read it.
So, the 3D ENGINE WARS continue on GamingInsider. Mike
Dussault, the lead programmer at LithTech, responds to
Tim Sweeney's letter. Please send plain-language version
to Otakuboy@bigfoot.com.
   More Wars! This time, though, it's the 3D Sound Wars. 
Gamecenter.com runs a round-up on 3D Sound. What to buy,
where to buy, etc. But, if you're dyin' for a little more
of a technical peek, check out Mr. Propeller-Head's stun-
ningly easy-to-understand prose. Oh my, it is like sex! 
   Hype.se's got a pretty cool story on Pokemon Madness --
at least how the Japanese fellers go fer it. They also 
summarize a list of the Pokemon games to come, including
one for 64DD? Don't hold you breath, Hype.se. 
   And how do I know that? Because I am OtakuGod in 
OtakuBoy clothes. No, seriously, digital-ages posts an
editorial about "N64-DD, the fading hope." D.A.'s Scott
Man lists three reasons why there won't be a N64-DD. 1.
Multiple Delays; 2. All companies have pulled out of 
development; 3. The 4MB Pak will be relased. From these
three reasons, Scott gives some pretty damning conclusions.
I've always wondered why they named it "DD." Whenever I see
that, I don't think of videogames. ;)
