   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   OtakuBoy watched his first Pokemon episode today -- and 
he's still reeling from the Japanese-ness of the whole 
show. How is it that a trip causes a person to leap 900
feet into the air? And why won't that little tan monster
talk ENGLISH! ENGLISH, you bug!
   I'm really kidding. Pokemon grabbed my interest
and everyone here should try to see it -- at least once.
You too will believe a man can trip on an acorn and launch
900 feet into the air. Oy veh.

Pocket-Station-On-The-Brain. That's the theme for Sony
coverage on many of the sites. If Playstation means you
it's a station you play with, does PocketStation mean
it's a station you put in your pocket? ;P IGNPSX has
a nice story on the whole sensation, but they don't re-list
the titles. You're gonna have to go to Game Fan for that.
Read both. Print 'em out. Stuff 'em your pocket.
   Can your heart stand the anxiety likely to come from 
this idea? Videogames.com decides to release a "Quake
screen a day" to celebrate the new "Quake" for PSX. The
first one appeared last night. Tonight... Well, you know
the drill. Since that's likely to be over quickly, bop on
over to IGNPSX to see what they got in their "Rugrats"
preview. 
   Could it be that Dig Dug has been reincarnated? Well,
Videogames.com thinks so in their super cool preview of 
Vermin. See if you can figure out all the similarities and
e-mail 'em to otakuboy@bigfoot.com. "Colorful phrase-o-
the-day" goes to Console Domain and their review of 
"Buggy." "PLOPS FROM THE SKY?!" I think I can say that 
without spoiling the review. Meanwhile, Videogames.com
reviews "X Games Pro Boarder." 
   Will there be a Nude Code in Tomb Raider 3? Excuse me
while I head to the restroom to take care of -- ahh --
something. Thank you. All better now. Check out GameFan
for the latest. Actually the story has something to do
with Lara's new wardrobe, but as soon as I saw "nude code"
... well, you know. 
   Oh, hey, back to Pokemon. Nintendo launched their new
Pokemon site. Details are... Well, there are NO details
on SixtyFour.com, but there is a convenient link. And
speaking of things that make the GameBoy go spitter-spat,
Midway will support Color GameBoy in a big way. Details
at Digital-Ages.
   Side rant: I have decided that some things shouldn't
be done. If you're playing AD&D, you shouldn't attack a 
Red Dragon with a morning star. Bad idea. Simliarly,
Nintendojo wonders if "Fighting Force 64" is bad idea.
Videogames.com has a nifty preview of "Jest," that game
that says, "I'm funny, laugh at me." IGN64 runs with a 
preview of "O.D.T." (Or Die Trying). And SixtyFour.com
carries news of Nintendo ending another counterfeit 
problem. Oh, when will those pirates learn, huh?
   Ok, OK, I'm wrong! There's still Tokyo Game Show stuff
coming down about Dreamcast. First, apparently Neo Geo
Pocket will link to Dreamcast. Why? Ummm... you have to 
check out both Digital-Ages and GameFan for the goods.
I guess for SNK, "if you can't beat 'em, link to 'em."
Meanwhile, SegaX runs a very nice sourced story about how
Sega may answer to a sudden appearance of PSX2. 
   Will "Akolyte" come over to Dreamcast? Well, 
Dreamcaster.net thinks so. And to prove it, they sent their
spies into a chat room to see what they developers had to
say about a possible port. If you've ever wanted to play
a title with characters that look like Weebles that could,
if you pushed hard enough, fall down, then, please, head
over to Videogames.com and their preview of "Sengoku Turb,"
latest Dreamcast title out da box. 
   GameFan runs a news story about Sega of America's first
release for Dreamcast? What is it? I'm not going to spoil
it for you. Sorry. Oh, and if you've a hankerin' for a 
pic of WebTV and Dreamcast, check it out at SegaX!
   Oh, and one last note: If you're a frequent buying 
member at EB, then check out FGNOnline for an oh-so
special offer. 
   Otakuboy -- who is, as of today, suffering from 
pneumonia -- out.
