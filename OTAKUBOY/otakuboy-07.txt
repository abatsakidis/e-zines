   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the
online console video game zines -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to get them all.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Well, Tokyo Game Show (TGS) came and went (9th-11th) and
pictures and stuff still roll in -- ever so slowly. It's
almost like people have sent this stuff via trusty Sea
Mail. Why no "live" reports? I guess it's just too ex-
pensive to treat TGS like E3.
   Either way, lots of cool stuff today, but all of it
mixed. No big themes today and, finally, some N64 stuff.

-----------

   PSX stuff leads with more speculation/rumor on PSX2.
You know, it occurs to me that since we're starting to
see so much speculation about PSX2, there may actually
be something to all this hoopla. Well, feast your
little ole' eyes on FGN's latest sourced story about
PSX2. But, please, clean up after you've finished reading.
   We all know that Square has some massive CGI talents.
I mean, these things are huge. I saw them once in a dark
alley, a pen-light my only light source, and I could never
find the end. Ugh. Well, for the poor schlops that didn't
get to see FFVIII at the Tokyo Game Show, Square showed
off their "talents" so everyone could see. Details at
IGNPSX.
   Do Lara Croft's breasts bounce longer in "Tomb Raider 3?"
Console Domain tries to answer that question as well as
a few more important questions in their preview. (Here's
a very important question: Are Lara's calves any firmer?)
The classic game Archon and Star Control collide in
"The Unholy War," according to a review on GameCenter.
(It does seem awfully similar to Archon, but that's
friggin' COOL! OtakuBoy say!)
   Reviewer Joe Fielder takes a look at "Wild 9" for PSX and
Console Domain pulls off the fur for a quick look at
"Tai Fu: Wrath of The Tiger." This one looks really cool,
especially if you're into Chinese stuff. And PSXlast, but
certainly not PSXleast, Hype.se steps up with a review of
"CoolBoarders 3."
   Why is Nintendo so quiet during the Dreamcast hype? 64
Source has some ideas in a new editoral. I think, maybe,
they're just scared. Yeah, they're a little yella! IGN64
runs a small, but good piece on "Castlevania 64" stuff
shown at Tokyo Game Show. (Konami was there, if not
Nintendo.) And speaking of Konami, they show off a new
RPG, "Hybrid Heaven." Alpha state, so there's not too
much to see, but for what it's worth, IGN64 has the goods.
   Important question Number 2: How is it that reviewer
Tim Stevens hpt his cool while reviewing "Gex 64?" I don't
know. He almost pulled off a very important piece
of his N64. Check out Console Domain for more. OH, WAIT!
Here's what Nintendo's involved with during the Tokyo
Game Show. Games.Net runs a news item about Nintendo
settling with a Taiwanese counterfeiter. Or maybe, Nin's
sending review copies of F-Zero X to Game Assault. You
know, F-Zero X could almost be classified as an "old game,"
but Game Assault's review is very detailed and nice. Check
it out.
   OtakuBoy prediction #1: Now that Tokyo Game Show is
over, we should less and less Dreamcast stuff until launch.
Ah, I don't know what the heck I'm talking about.
   Despite OtakuBoy's name, OtakuBoy does not read Japanese.
This means OtakuBoy has to simply click and click and click
when it comes to Japanese sites. Still, check out the
links on The Sonic Team portion of Sega Japan. Pretty cool.
   Gamespot does what other sites have done before. They
run "player reviews" of Dreamcast titles at Tokyo Game
Show. Don't discount this, though, simply because IGN did
this earlier! Gamespot's roving reporter managed to get
his hands on a title snuck in at the last minute -- and
it had NO TITLE OR NOTHING! WOWEE WOWOWOW! Meanwhile,
IGNDreamcast proclaims "Sonic Adventure" a "blockbuster."
What could they mean? Details there.
   Console Domain overviews Dreamcast hardware. It's a
little bit about all the hardware, including some more
info on the Dreamcast keyboard, which I haven't seen
many other places. Console City's Dreamcast Insider
also has news of a "Coolboarders" game on Dreamcast.
Can it be true?
   And here's something very cool... Well, maybe not.
Dreamcaster.net runs a link to some errant directory on
some Japanese server. In this directory are, presumably,
pictures of the Tokyo Game Show. I say "presumably"
because so many of them are TERRIBLE! But why does
OtakuBoy list this source if the pictures are terrible?
Because OtakuBoy needs filler. Just kidding. If you like
to see "my weekend at Tokyo Game Show" type photos, then
this is the place to go. And, to be sure, I didn't get a
chance to look at all of them. There could be a picture
of Sonic in a compromising position with Crash Bandicoot.
"Hey-ya Crash, I've heard your the best!" "You know it,
blue boy!"

      [Management smacks OtakuBoy upside the head.]

   OW! Management bastards.
   GameFan runs a nice little round-up of all that went
on at Tokyo Game Show. No big bombshells -- (yep, you've
seen it all!) -- but maybe it's nice for a wrap up.
Meanwhile, Re:Tokyo runs some really nice stories and
pictures from the show. They haven't updated their site
since 10.9 and I'm anxiously awaiting. The pictures they
do have are very good.
   Videogames.com takes apart "Soul Calibur," bit by bit.
There are some parts that I simply must caution you from.
These are things no average gamer should see. They're
just TOO DAMN NAUGHTY! I'm being silly. This is a good
guide/review because it gives little known tidbits, like
the differences between Calibur and Soul Edge.
   Still, if you want something a little more light-hearted
(dim-witted?) check out the wonder that is "WonderSwan,"
Bandai's new handheld console. A news item, and spiffy
picture, runs on Digital-Ages.
   My Brain, my brain, my brain aches. OtakuBoy out.
