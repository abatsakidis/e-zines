   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Oh my, we're startin' to hear lotsa Dreamcast news about
now. Heck! It's only -- what? -- ten or twelve days before 
the little guy's supposed to make his Japanese debut. Oh
how I wish I could line up with all those other Japanese
gamer-d00ds outside their fav videogame stores and slap
my 80 bazillion yen on the counter. "Give me a Dreamcast,
m'man! Straight up!" (By the way, have you seen the pockets
one needs to carry 80 bazillion yet? That's a big pocket.
Magnum pockets.)

-----------

Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   Hey, remember that cool interview with a "Blue Stinger"
producer Sega X ran translated from EDGE Magazine? Well,
the Super Cool d00ds there run two more interviews. This
time they're from Game Weekly! All translated for yer
one-handed enjoyment. 

   Sonic/Dreamcast demos have hit stores. Honest! But, 
what's this crap? This joystick don't move Sonic! What
th-? Check out Game-Online for the shocking, sad news.
And another bad-news-type-surprise. Couple-a news outlets
report there are problems with gettin' enough chippy-chip-
chip sets out there. Details on News.com!

   Ah, but crap. Forget all that news. Much more exciting
stuff over on Gaming Age about secret launch titles! And
speaking of new titles, check out IGNDreamcast's news on a
Dreamcast sequel to "Chakan: The Forever Man." You know 
Chakan! That Super-Mega-Genesis-Blockbuster. I don't remem-
ber it either. It's "Black & White" Preview day over at 
Console Domain. Check out this title -- and if you figure
out what it is, please tell me. I'm perplexed! And finally,
ya gotta check out all the up-2-date specifics on the 
console over at GameCenter. A super-duper report. 


Nintendo 64 (N64)

   I've watched all the recent episodes of Pokemon and, I
gotta tell you, Ash is fallin' down on the job. He's sup-
posed to keep Pikachu fit. But this little guy's growin'
quite a tire! Steel-belted Radial, right around the mid-
section. Well, you can use yer mid-section to slim down
Pikachu's. Check out Nintendo.com for the details.

   Hey, does this qualify as bad news? Nah! Nintendo's just
preparin' for Dreamcast's Japanese arrival right? IGN64 has
news of a Japan-N64 price drop. Only 90 bazillion yen in-
stead of 100. Big pockets still necessary. And while yer
pickin' up yer new Japanese N64, pick up Zelda 64. Why?
Because The Seattle Times says it's a PlayStation KILLER!
Killer, man, killer! Don't wanna go all the way to Japan
for Zelda? (Why not? What's yer problem?) Then check out
all the cool voucher/coupon thingy-specials comin' to yer
local Target stores. Details at IGN64. Also, find out the
real info on how many Zelda Gold and regular carts are
comin' out and get a good idea of how long it's going to
take you to finish the game. Details at Digital-Ages.

   How does it feel to have a couple of "BattleTanx" roll
over yer legs? Snap. Snap. Ow. OW! Well, you'll get to find
out for real soon. Check out all the cool BattleTanx-info
at NintenDojo. Then Nth Dimension goes "NFL Quarterback Club
'99" nutty with their Super Preview (tm). But they're not
nearly as nutty as IGN64. What the heck's goin' on over
there? Every other story just happens to be about -- you
guess it -- Quarterback club. Still, they're worth seein'
cause they fill in some details the Console City report
doesn't.

   Get F-Zero X. Or get N. Or get out. Or get bent. Or
get the review of "F-Zero X" at The Nth Dimension. Do rats
fart? That's what Digital-Ages wants to know in their re-
view of "Space Station: Silicon Valley." Also, the question
of the day at Nth Dimension's reviews is: Is "Hybrid Heaven"
RPG Heaven? Don't. Make. Me. Type. Ha-Ha.


PlayStation (PSX) 

   Finally, a way to check the re-bounce rate on Lara's
breasts. "HOW, DEAR GOD?! PLEASE TELL ME! I'VE GOT TO KNOW!
OH PLEASE, HELP ME. I AM SWEATING. OH JEEZ! WHAT'S THIS
PUDDLE? MY GOD HELP!" you ask? Check out Videogames.com
Super-"Tomb-Raider-III"-Preview for the entire story. But
maybe it's a big mass of "Twisted Metal 3" that floats yer
umm... boat. Lots of sites are all a-buzzin' over the game's
release, but only Videogamers.com gives you a guide. Ask
for it by name. By the way, it was a hard decision, but
in the end Lara's breasts won top billing over rumors on 
Sega X about PSX2 games IN DEVELOPMENT! What's this doing
on a Sega site, you ask? Ummmm.... don't know. What do
you think the PSX2 should be named? PlayStation 2? PSX
2k? Ha-Ha-Nintendo-You-Suck-A-Doodle-Doo? Well, Next
Generation has an idea what it may actually be called.

   Hehehe.. Lotsa news about ads today. First, Capcom's
gonna put a cap in yer Telly when they run all kinds of
Resident Evil ads. Details at PSXNation. Also at PSXNation:
could there be MORE Play-Stay-Shun ads on the way? My God!
I seem them only ever five minutes now. 

   What's goin' on in Tokyo? Lotsa stuff. Fortunately, 
IGNPSX focuses on the videogaming stuff. It brings lotsa 
previews on specific titles. :) Speaking of previews, 
Parappa may become a Grand Parappa. Details at PSXNation.

   "Brave Fencer" is out. Are your tingling? Then check out
the review of Next Generation Oh? No tingle. Well, if
you don't really care, then check out the included demo disc
for a special-special treat. Don't say I didn't warn you if
you miss out. 

   Inside Games has news of a new game called "Apocalypse."
What is it? Ah, I won't spoil it. Check out the cool, new,
super, great, wonderful RPG "Shadow Madness." And while
you're in the RPG mood, IGNPSX has news from Activision of
a possible new way to develop RPG characters. It's really
kinda neat.

   You're only a gamer, in a guilded "RollCage." What is it?
It's a new soft-drink ... I mean, game, from Psygnosis. PC
and PlayStation, yesiree. GameFan has both a preview and a
bunch-a pictures. 

   Hex-Turn. Hex-Turn. That's the just of "Brigandine." 
Well, I'm biased. I don't like that game. Ugh. But check
out the review over at Console Domain. Reviewer Tim Stevens
has a bone to pick with "Test Drive 5." And we're finally
past the "Metal Gear Solid" review stage and into walk-
throughs and guides. But before you spoil it for yourself,
check out GameFan's FAQ.


Multi-format

   HAHAHAH! Wotta punny writer! Check out the "Acclaim to
Fame" (woohoooooo) on GameCenter. Lotsa sneak-peeks on new
titles because Acclaim stopped by GameCenter's offices.
And just like IGN64 from a few weeks ago, send yer congrats
to irule-usuck@gamecenter.com. They deserve your congrats,
and yer bows. ;)

   Capcom's gettin' a might-upset at importers these days.
Sendin' letters, makin' threats. It's kinda like interviews
on wrestlin' shows. Check out all the news at Gaming-Age.

   Finally, wanna read some news about a new "Tempest?" I
knew that you did. It's at Gaming-Age.

O.B. Out.

  Thanks to Contributors Tara Calishain and Wizard. See a 
      cool story? Send it to me! Otakuboy@bigfoot.com
