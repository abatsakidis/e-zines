   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Everyone's all a-titter -- sorry -- over "Tomb Raider 3." 
Seems as if the game's gonna be out in time for turkey. I
even went through my old E3 stuff just to pull out that Lara
centerfold one of the mags ran at the time. Wow. Nothing 
gets me more hot than polygons. I can now see what many a-
sex starved gamer has for the girl. 15 degree angles. Ooh,
baby.

-----------

Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   But I've so much Lara on the brain that I'm going to 
practice a bit of delayed-gratification. Trust me. The
psychologists say it's good for you. Instead, I'm gonna go
at it with Dreamcast. 

   Woah! A Super Cool Dreamcast promo movie that's goin'
around Japan somehow plops on Gaming-Age! How did they
do it? Who cares! Just download the 10 meg Quicktime
previewin'-puppy. And speaking of cool previews, check out
the news about "Project Berkeley" over at Videogames.com.
Oh, in a totally unrelated piece of Dreamcast news (HAHA!),
Sega announces pricing for the online action Dreamcast
owners are gonna experience in a few weeks. Details at 
Videogames.com

   Naomi and Dreamcast sittin' in a tree, I N T E R F A C I
N G. Sorry, bad joke on an even worse ditty. Still, Sega X
has and interview with some Sega people abouth the super-
cool Naomi arcade board and what may happen when it gets its
ever-loving mitts on the Dreamcast. And speaking of inter-
facin' technologies and exciting possibilities, Gaming-Age
has news of a Sega-something that may compete with the new
Color GameBoy.

   Ah, I knew I couldn't avoid her. She had to crop up some-
where, right? The creator of Tomb Raider speaks about 
Dreamcast. Will Lara's breasts bounce on Dreamcast in full-
on, textured 3D? If you've simply had yer fill of Lara, then
try and find out what 'Hidekazu-mania' be. I canna figure it
out, Cap'n. Is it contagious? Airborne? Details at
Next-Generation. Also, there's a blue stain on the walls of
The New York Daily News as they dissect Sonic to see what
the quick-bugger could do for Dreamcast. 

   This deserves it's own paragraph: Gaming-Age goes nutsy
with previews and pics. Check out the latest shots and stuff
on Evolution, Sonic, Tetris 4D, and PowerStone. All 
Dreamcast. Wow. Can you see the love in my eyes?

PlayStation (PSX) 

   Super-contributor Wizard sent in lotsa PSX goodies today
for you. He's a real PSX-URL-huntin'-d00d. He's obsessed!
Obsessed! Prozac perscription on the way, Wizard. 

   First, he sends note of an interview at Videogamers.com.
A Super-Interview, in fact, with Dreamworks and the people
behind "Small Soldiers." See the movie. Play the game.
Eat the cookies. Down the malt liquor. It's merchandising at
its best. 

   "What exactly IS 'Sentinel Returns,' anyway," Wizard 
asked? I don't know. I went to the review on Videogames.com
and I can't figure it out -- neither can the review. So,
here's a more graspable game: "Brave Fencer." Wizzie says
to check out the profile at Gaming-Age! Also, check out
a super-review of "Crash Bandicoot 3." And speaking of 
Crash, Videogames.com put together a big guide to the game.
Watch out. Thar be spoilers in dem dar guide. Also, why
watch TV waiting (in vain?) for those new "Resident Evil"
ads to appear when you can download 'em from IGNPSX?

   Ok, folks I won't hold you off anymore. I'm sorry. Please
forgive me! here's the word on Lara and "Tomb Raider 3."
Turns out she might have a bit to do with corn bread stuf-
fing and gizzards. Details at GameFan and Videogames.com.
Happy? Thank you.

   Wow! All these previews are gonna keep your butt plas-
tered to yer chair all weekend. I understand a few online
stores sell spatulas, should you get in real trouble. Start
at IGNPSX and their list upcoming Atlus titles. "Oh, Atlus.
Bring your titles hither." Then, PSXMax has an update to 
their "Ridge Racer 4" preview. Re:Tokyo has info on a new 
Square RPG sequel (say that 200 times fast), "Saga Frontier
II." Also at Re:Tokyo, preview of "PS Dragon Valor." Want
reviews? PSXMax has 'em, it seems, of "Dragon Dice" and 
"Bust-A-Groove."

   Lotsa games went gold today. Details at FGN. Just keep
scrollin' down the screen til you "gold" over and over 
again. And speaking of sites that make you scroll, third
story down on Magic Box brings news about a Sony-induced
threat to Pokemon. Yeah, Pikachu. Sony's gonna kick yer
little butt. 

   Ha ha. I got Hasbro's "Centipede" in the mail today. ;)
Actually, I got to play the thing at E3. If you wanna know
more about it, check out the OFFICIAL Web site. 


Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   All these Zelda nuts have it wrong. It's GameBoy Color
that's gonna be the PSX-Killer. So says 64Source. Meanwhile,
Videogames.com celebrates the 50 best GameBoy games. Go
see if you agree with them. No one asked me to vote. I guess
you didn't get to vote either, huh?

   I don't buy this GB Color as PSX-Killer, though. Yeah,
it's cool and all. But I think if anything's got a chance
to harm PSX, it's Zelda. And other thinks so to. First,
check out the "Miyamoto-san" interview of Videogames.com.
Then 64 Source and Gaming-Age brings news of how the
title's reviewin' in Japan. Cool. Then it's a full-on
preview at IGN64.

   In Console-space, no one can send you bug patches. Too 
bad. Looks like that's gonna piss off some "QB Club" play-
ers. Details at Gaming-Age. NintenDojo runs a super-long
interview with the people behind "Twisted Edge." Snowboar-
ding, man. Snowboarding. Meanwhile, IGN64 runs news of a
"secret" N64 title. Of course, it's not much of a secret 
anymore. Thank GOD they didn't say, "Best Kept Secret."

   64Source runs a preview of "South Park." It's more like
an update, but it's cool! Nintendo Underground reviews
"WipeOut 64" and a Gamecenter reviewer says, "my wrist was
all tired and sore." Eyuh. What could he mean? Oh, maybe
he's just reviewin' the "Reality Quest" Glove thingy. Also,
wanna know when stuff's comin' out? 64Source updates their
release list

   And finally, could this Nintendo/Pringles thingies be
collector's items?

Multi-format

   Lastly, but not leastly, here's a quick fun item. The
first Star Wars: Episode 1 movie posters. Coool.

See you Monday.


     Thanks to Wizard. See a cool story? Send it to me!
