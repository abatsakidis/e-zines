              P l a y S t a t i o n (PSX & PSY)

-- PSY? 'Y' not? - News
   According to a report on GameFAN, the code name for the
PSX2 is PSY. Hmm... it's not going to be easy typing that.
I'm so used to typing PSX2. PSX2. PSY PSY PSY. It sounds
like a code for a college course more than the code name of
a hot new game system. PSY 1001 - Psychology  - "Explores
the professor's nether regions." Also in this story are the
current companies working for PSY and games in-development!

   Worried that the roster in NBA LIVE '99 is getting a bit
musty? PEW! Well, WORRY No MORE, MY FINE-FEATHERED FRIEND!!!

roster for ya. This is cool, too. Think of all the ways

-- MAYHEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - News
   60 WCW wrestlers?! WOW! That's amazing, sister babe!
That's just over the top. And yet that's what you're gonna
get to play in EA's upcoming WCW MAYHEM. Check out the
details at Digital-Ages.

-- HA HA! You can't emulate on Windows... - News
   ... for 20 days that is. Sony finally got a little edge
over the other d00dz in their battler to stop the VIRTUAL
GAME STATION emulator. This time, it'll be 20 days before
the Windows version can come out. Big deal!
-- http://www.consoledomain.com/news/index.html#604


-- DINO CRISIS MOVIESSSSSSSSSS! - Movie
   Yeah, BOY!!!!!!!!!!! DINO CRISIS really kiCKS ToCK! And
what kicks tock even more is how one of the guys in the
video didn't want this footage recorded! Maybe this should
be called GAME DEVELOPER CRISIS? DARN IT! It's only 10
seconds! Not cool.
-- http://www.consoledomain.com/news/index.html#609


-- Ape Escape - Preview
   I still say The Great Grape Ape was the most underrated
cartoon character in history!! So, I'm just going to pretend
that the Ape in APE ESCAPE is the Great Grape Ape. Now,
lookie here on Game Online. Here's a great preview of the
next Crash/Spyro-esque game.
-- http://www.game-online.com/cfdocs/site/news/newstemp.cfm?newsid=1458


-- Legend of Lagaia - Preview
   Sony started mailin' out demo discs of LEGEND OF LAGAIA
this week. And WHY NOT?! It's a cool RPG. So says me. So
says PSXMax. So go check this out. I especially like how
they've critiqued the overall translation. It gives me
gooseybumps.

-- Shao Lin - Preview
   Hey, I really appreciate GameFAN going over SHAO LIN.
What a neat game, eh? But.. what's this? This review talks
about "brawlin'" and compares the game to THRILL KILL?
Hmmm... either GameFAN don't know what a SHAO LIN is, or the
game developers don't.

-- K-1: Revenge - Review
   Around the world (except for the United States), K-1 is
like super popular. Oh? You don't know what K-1 is. Well,
then I suggest you go away. No! Seriously, K-1 combines like
all kinds of fighting styles into several rounds of cool,
kick ass (pun) fun. ANd K-1: REVENGE is like a game about
that! So, go read this GameCenter review!!
-- http://www.gamecenter.com/Consoles/Sony/K1revenge/


-- WOW! Busted Fiberglass - Review
   Get it? You see, DEAD IN THE WATER, is like TWISTED
METAL. Yeah, yeah. Very nice. Except, this time, you're in a
BOAT! A big, hulking boat -- ON water even! And so the play
on words -- TWISTED METAL... BUSTED FIBERGLASS. You see?
It's really very simple. And very funny if I do say so
myself, and I do say so myself. I just did. GameFAN's review
praises DitW as they call it.

-- Pro Pinball Big Race USA - Review
   It even has the cliched reference to The Who's PINBALL
WIZARD! No, seriously, PRO PINBALL BIG RACE USA sounds like
a really good implementation of pinball on a console --
FINALLY! Anyone remember those weird TG-16 pinball games? I
remember one: When you hit the ball to the top of the table,
the bottom half flashed off the screen, the top half taking
its place. This wasn't so bad, of course, except when you
had a ball bouncing between the halfway point on the table
and your screen would flash and flicker between the the two
halves of the table over and over again. Hehehe.. that was
a game, let me tell you. So, anyway Console Domain reviews.
-- http://www.consoledomain.com/psx/reviews/Pro_Pinball_Big_Race_USA.html


-- Final Fantasy VIII - Review
   Yeah, we've seen these before, but it's so cool when a
site waits awhile before posting their review. Why? Because
they get to stand out from everyone else! SO, if you haven't
seen a FF8 review yet, it's time to read your little butt
off.

-- Have Flightstick? Get GameStick - Review
   Well, you don't have to have to Flightstick. The
FlightStick is a PC controller that's like cool for flight
games and stuff. (Hence, the name. Clever marketing!) Well,
GameCenter reviews the console cousin, the GAMESTICK! (BAD
MARKETING! BAD BAD! NAME NOT GOOD! BAD!)

-- Jus' give yo' best ATTITUDE! - Preview
   Heck, WHOLE SITES have been devoted to this title. Every-
one can't wait til it comes out! YES, EVERYONE! Even folks
who don't particularly like wrestling want this game. How do
I know? Because, darn it, I'm a journalist! And I speak with authoritatisism. All journalists know better than you.

the upcoming DUKE NUKEM for GameBoy Color! Do you agree? NO
WAY!!!! Not me! I want full-on, first-person, big-time, shoot-em-now-screw-the-questions action. Yeah, yeah, DUKEY
