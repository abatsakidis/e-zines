   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   I have some terrible news. (No!! It's not about me... not
this time.) Console City has passed on. Regular readers of
O.O. will know that I often visit Console City's sites, The
Nth Dimension, PSXMax, and Dreamcast Insider. 

   Earlier this year, Web hosting services started to dump
them. Quite simply, they transferred too many bytes a day --
too many to exist on a server with other accounts. But the
site didn't make enough money to purchase their own Web
server. So, when the latest hoster turned them off, the
guys, according to MikeB of PSXMax, decided to go their
separate ways.

   PSXMax will live again in GAGame's upcoming console 
section which is set to debut around January 1. I have no
word on the fate of The Nth Dimension or Dreamcast Insider.
(Though, DCI had not updated for well over a month.)

   If this were TV, you'd see the CC logo and a fade to
black...

Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   ... and then the mayhem would resume.

   And speaking of crying... many "Turok 2" players have
been droppin' big cow tears all over their N64s. Their
games have been crashing! Well, the problem has been
located. Next-Generation Online has the story.

   Woah! Couple of big interviews to keep ya busy until you
rip open your new N64 carts on Christmas Day. Nintendo
Underground interviews Rick Raymo, one of the guys working
on the upcoming "Duke Nukem: Zero Hour." 64Source has an
interview with David Dienstibier, "Turok 2" Project Manger.
If you think you've read his name before -- yes, you have.
The guy's been giving lots of interviews lately. 

   After you've finished ripping open those N64 carts on
Christmas, you just might want to check Gamespot for their
big list of Nintendo's '99 releases. You can then turn in
your list for next year.

   "Winback." No, it's not a code-name for Windows invading
your PC. It's a new shooter comin' out in Summer '99 from
Koei. And Videogames.com has a preview. Meanwhile, IGN64
previews "Triple Play 2000," and baseball players look
mighty fine in 3d, I must say. (Well, I don't _have to_ say,
I suppose.)

   Here are a couple of NO WAYs for you. Follow along, 
you'll see what I mean: NO WAY, 64 Source, "Dual Heroes"
can't be THAT bad! (Check out their review.) NO WAY, 
GameCenter, "A Bug's Life" can't be THAT bad! (Check out
their review.) This next one's not a NO WAY -- at least
not right away: Nintendojo gives their first (cautiously
optimistic) impressions of "Rogue Squadron."

   Oh, I can hear you laughing already. You know what I'm
going to say. Yeah, you do. It's possible to transfer your
GameBoy Camera pics to your PC. Don't believe me? Jeez. 
Go check out Nintendojo's GameBoy section for the details,
please. Also, once you've finished reading that, scroll down
a bit to the news story about "Twoubling Times," the new
Loony Toons GameBoy Color game. Cool screen shot.

   Just when you thought you'd be the first person to beat
"Zelda DX" (GameBoy Color) and post a guide, someone scoops
you. Sorry to have to be the one to tell you that a GameBoy
Euro-Asia contibutor posted one. It's on the news page. See
that big spot o' black space. It's text. Highlight it.

   N64-finally, IGN64 has the latest pic of the Mario Party
box! Kinda neat to see new boxes, eh?


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   It's ShenMue out Da Wazoo, even though today is O-Fish-
Shially Sonic Day! (Poor Sonic. Weep with me for a second,
won't you?)

   Dreamcaster.net has a first-person account of the ShenMue
conference. Join their Japanese correspondent as he boards
the train to Yokohama. (Didn't Eric Clapton sing that? "By
the time we got to Yokohama, the conference had just 
begun.") Sega-Otaku posts some of the shots that came over
the Webcam during the conference's Internet broadcast. IGN
Dreamcast puts together its package of coverage -- a moment
-by-moment account, pics of the game play, and what they
call "detail" pics of the scenery, characters, etc. And
Sega X takes a long hard look at the protagonist, Ryo
Hatsuki.

   In a special effort to track every single Dreamcast that
leaves Sega, Sega-Otaku posts a report/review about the
Asian Dreamcast. Ah, but there's something a little more
significant about this one -- like a manual and box in 
English! Wow!

   Remember recently one site reported that Famitsu said
Sonic Adventure was terrible? Then another site said that
the review didn't say that at all? Well, Next-Generation
Online tries to clear up this whole mess by explaining
Famitsu's review.

   And speaking of reviews, SegaX plugs their ears into the
Sonic music CD. They list the tracks and give their im-
pressions. Neat.

   And speaking of neat, news from Sega Otaku about how
to walk on water in "Virtua Fighter 3:Team Battle." They
say it's a bug, but I'd call that a divine feature!


PlayStation (PSX) 

   For whom doth Lara's breasts bounce? They bounce for 
thee. Honest. Anyway, check out the "Tomb Raider III" guide
and walkthrough over on Videogames.com.

   What are the top PSX peripherals of 1998? IGNPSX reports.
(Surprisingly, neither the Super-PSX-Male-Suck, nor the
French-PSX-Tingly-Parts made the list. Hmmm...)

    PlayStation sales have hit 50 million worldwide. 50
MILLION. Can you imagine? Game-Online has the news. And
Squaresoft has to be happy. With 50 million PlayStations 
out there, pre-sells for "Final Fantasy 8" should be brisk.
GameSpot has that news.

    Pirates and Mod-Chippers! Sony wants your collective
butt. And they've donated money to several organizations 
whose job it is to hunt you down. Ugh. Details at GameFan.
Speaking of fates worse than death, GameFan reports on 
the ultimate fate of Konami's "Survivor: Day One." Also on
GameFan, Namco throws its hat into the PocketStation ring.
Batter up and check out how their new baseball title may
use the PDA.

    Ulp. Here's another NO WAY. NO WAY, ConsoleDomain, "Eggs
of Steel" can't be THAT bad! (Check out their review.) And
Videogamers.com wants to know, "Can ANYONE Stop Mr. Domino?"
Perhaps their reviewer can.


Multi-format & Misc

   Finally, GameCenter revists the 3DO console and calls it
"The 3DO Experience." It's the story of the machines that
really never were. 

Cheers, folks.

             See a cool story? Send it to me!
