   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game zines -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to get them all.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   OtakuBoy tired. OtakuBoy note much said about Dreamcast.
OtakuBoy must shave hands now. OtakuBoy not know what he
say to anyone.
   Seriously, a huge ish today. Lots of cool stuff to see.
Hope the next 90 bazillion hours are free.

   Well, it stands to reason why everyone's got DreamCast 
in their pants today. Sega Japan confirmed release dates,
prices, game schedule, and more more more! Videogames.Com
/Electronic Gaming Monthly ran a pretty hefty news piece
with an almost timed tick-by-tock run of the events. This
happened first; this happened second, etc. GameWEEK did
a more analytical view of the whole matter, drawing more
attention to the fact that Sonic Adventure will not be
available at LAUNCH! SegaNet, inside their own DC coverage 
(speaking of Sonic), reports a little bit about player
reviews for Sonic Adventure. And what else does SegaNet
have for DC fans? Well, if you don't care 'bout anything
but games, they broke down the release dates for ya.
   Did not find any of this information on Fastest Game
News Online. I am losing faith. Ah, but they hit with a
lesser-known tid bit. The new Capcom Resident Evil/
BioHazard installment, "Biohazard Code Veronica" will 
be exclusively on DC. Aaaah. How refreshing. 
   Oh, and some amazingly funny one-liner quotes came out
of today's coverage, too. All quotes; all quotes. We can
not fault site writers for these. But, oh, my, they're to
DIE FOR! First, Sega says that Dreamcast will be "less
than a pair of Nike golf shoes." HAHAHAHAHHA ha ha.. ahem.
Anyway, the second one comes from Mr. Okamoto, creator
of Veronica. "Dreamcast is the machine which makes all
creators dreams come true." Er.. Hmm...
   Please forward names of comedy writers to:

   Another big theme last night and today seems to be the
Japanese release of Koei's Destrega, a new "i'm-a gonna
kick yer ass" game. Videogames.Com's got an import review
by James Mielke who doesn't like it all too much. But
you gotta read to believe, as I say. If you don't want
no opinions, check out GameFan. They do a preview.
Digital-Ages throws their own spin on the topic, too, but
only they report -- gasp -- that Destrega WILL COME TO
THE STATES! Hoopla! HOOPLA! How many fighting games does
this make? 500 BILLION?!
   And, believe me (hand on heart), I know you're all 
dying to see a Quicktime movie of the new Blue Stinger
action-adventure-rpg-fighting-children's-adult's-porn-
playful-buttchompin game. Whew. Videogames.Com ran a small
news story last night about how a QT movie would be 
released, then updated the story to include the link to
the movie.
   IGN's got a cool look at multiplayer PSX games. A
must-read? Ah.. well, it's nice for the list of all the
current and upcoming multiplayer PSX games. And right on
the heels of Console Domain's proclamation that Madden '99
is "the best ever!" Videogames.com loves you to want them
with their look at games that will never be imported. This
trail-blazing, mouth-searin' list includes titles that
need to stay away, titles that you might want to import
yourself, and ones that you should. Check out "BASTARD!!"
for PSX; it looks a might funny!
   And speaking of funny -- Lara Croft's gettin' a bum
wipe.. er rap from a movie critic. IGN reports that a
lesser-known site, Dark Horizons, and an even-lesser-
known critic report that there aresome serious reser-
vations about the Tomb Raider script. Uh Oh. Could this
movie go the way of the Fanatasic Four? Could it
become a porn title? Womb Raider? Boob Raider? Anyway,
I gots links to both IGN coverage and Dark Horizon's
critique... MINOR SPOILERS!
   And, finally, whew, Videogames.Com has a report about
Toys R Us and their apparent price-slicing on Tamagotchis.
Only thing I have to say is: FURBY HAS ARRIVED! MOOOHAHAHA-
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA

[Management responds: Shut up, OtakuBoy. Management also
asks you to visit a site with reprints of a few video-
game ads from the 70's and 80's. Details below. Also,
BitchX notes that GT Interactive will acquire Legend 
Entertainment. Management thanks you. Good night.]
