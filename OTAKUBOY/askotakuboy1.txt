=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   It's time for the FIRST edition of Ask OtakuBoy, the
question and answer newsletter where OtakuBoy readers
get confused into thinking OtakuBoy's a videogaming
expert or something. Ha HAH! Just kidding. 

   Frequently, I get mail from people wanting to know
how to reach a certain level in a game or where to find
the latest info on a game. And so... here's that forum.

   Send your questions to: Otakuboy@bigfoot.com

Hey, when is Pokemon Stadium coming out for N64?
Also, can you tell me some stuff about it?

And OTAKUBOY SAY:

This will give you a larger preview of the game. But,
essentially, it's a Pokemon fighter! Look at the animated
show. Watch how ASH sends Pikachu to do battle with other
Pokemon he encounters. This is what you're going to do
in Pokemon Stadium. The "C" button will be programmed
with the specific Pokemon's special attacks. Press it
and watch the carnage in full-on 3D!

Also, the 64GB Pak is supposed to come with it, which
will allow you to bring on raised Pokemon from your
GameBoy! Yeah.

As for a release date, it looks like there's no
specific launch date so far.

64Source says "1999." IGN64 says "TBA" (To Be Announced).

I NEED YOUR HELP!!!! 
Today I got this new game for GameBoy, James Bond 007,
and I'm stuck in the second mission, Kurdistan. In the
Kabarret I can't go to the Courtyard and get the Lamp,
because the guardian tells me "This is a registered
area" or something.

This is a link to a walkthrough. Read this and it'll
tell you how to get through the game.

This link shows some codes and hints.

   Thus ends the first issue of Ask OtakuBoy. I hope you
enjoyed this splendiferous journey.
