   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Ah HA! Ah HA! Good news, fellers! Console City is BACK!
Yes, they're back! Well, PSXMax is. The Nth Dimension will
follow soon.

   Oh NO! Oh NO! Bad news, fellers! Sega-Otaku is DOWN!
No, they're down! Well, they're down temporarily. Seems the
good ole boys were hacked something fierce! But keep watch
out soon!

   HooRAH! HooRAH! Good news, fellers! PlayStation is BACK!
Yes, it's back!

-----------


PlayStation (PSX) 

   Back as the TOP section again. Hoorah! "OtakuBoy would
like to thank Sony, without whose money this wouldn't be
possible!" Just kidding. I don't get paid. Who'd pay me?

   Instead, they pay guys like the ones at Hammerhead 
Studios. And, get this, they pay them to take a good video-
game, like "Quake II," and bring it to the PlayStation. 
Wotta job that is, huh? Anyhoo, IGNPSX has an interview
with them about the trials and tribulations of portin' ole
Quake-boy.

   And with Console City's comin' back, so comes old
KingBoxer, the clown-prince of rumor-mongering. What's this?
"Street Fighter EX2" not comin' to PSX? What's THIS? 
"Policenauts" finally comin' to the states? (Bless you,
Hideo fans!) And WHAT'S THIS?! "Gran Tourismo 2" to be
the PSX2 launch title?! Holy-fark-a-roooonie! Check out
PSXMax for the details.

   Speaking of PSX2, IGNPSX reaches way down into their...
erm... pants(?) to find a November story about Toshiba, a
chip set, and the PSX2. It's a love-fest. Bring the lubri-
cation.

   (and in a wee, tiny news note, hype.se says that 'wipeout
3' is comin'. go there for details. shhhhhhh...)

   AHEM! Did you see GameCenter's "T'ai Fu" review in the 
last issue? No? Well, here's a preview from Game-Online. 
Think it's too late to read a preview? AH! But this a pre-
view from the UK! A different culture; a different perspec-
tive. Different Web links. The OtakuBoy WEIGH!

   Videogames.com import-reviews "Smash Court 2," the long-
awaited (?!) sequel to "Smash Court." (It's a Tennis game,
in case ya don't know.) Also, check out Cheat Planet for
the latest codes/cheats on "Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street
Fighter." Cool, de la cool.


Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   Martini & Rossi, ASTI-SPUMANTI. It's de bubbly...
BELLA! (Sorry, I've been seeing that commercial so often,
I can't get it out of my head.)

   What I also can't get out of my head is Japan. Tokyo,
more specifically. Ah, the videogamer's mecca. I must make
a pilgrimage there. I must. Maybe that's why Nintendojo
reports tonight (and every week-month-year) on the game-
goings-on in Nippon. Check out Nintendojo for the 1998
Nippon wrap up!

   IGN64 has a bunch a-new movies for you to download. 
First, they do a full-on preview of "Monaco Grand Prix,"
the sequel to F-1 Racing. And they's gots some movies.
Cool, man. Then, they have "first movies" of "Blades of
Steel," the super new ice hockey game. You put yer right
foot in; you pur yer right foot out. You do the ice-hockey
ice-pockey and you turn yerself around...

   WOW! Game-Online, those self-startin' UK gamers, have a
big preview of "Duke Nukem Zero Hour." Yes! Yes! And in 
a, perhaps, less anticipated preview, Videogames.com takes
a look at "Hype: The Time Quest." The premise: You're a 
knight. You're short. You're cute. Three things every game
needs, eh?

   YAY! "Zelda" CHEATS! Go to Cheat Planet. (Don't tell any
body you're goin' though. I got accosted tonight in a chat
room fer likin' cheats.) And in a bit of a joke, check out
the new "Glover" cheats! Wooooooo Hooooooooooooooooooo!

   In GameBoy news, apparently, there have been lotsa 
pirated copies of "Shutokou" floatin' around. Singapore's
got 'em. Do you? Check out the story and pics on GameBoy
Euro-Asia, uber GameBoy site. 


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   And the Sonic movies just keep onnnnn comin'! Sega X
has super movies showing Sonic's Amy and Knuckles. And Sega
Net has super long .MPEGs of a bunch of the levels. Down-
load, man. 

   Sega X also throws some new tips on how to beat the ole
game. Also on Sega X, the guys take a gander at the so-
called "Dream Points." They're kinda like Proof-of-Purchase
stickers we have here in the U.S. Collect enough points and
get fabulous prizes! Sega X details it all fer ya.

   "House of The Dead 2" is comin'! WOOOOHOOO! (Um, I've
actually never played the arcade version.) Anyhoo, National
Console Support has the story, confirmed through their dis-
tributors, while Sega X has a similar story. But they gots
screen shots!

   After all the reviews, it seems silly to put in this
First Impression from Dreamcaster.net. And yet, maybe it's
the Final First Impression of "Sonic Adventure" ever? Kinda
like Final Fantasy VIII! (How can it be FINAL and 8?) Like
the final day of 1998, it's all very special.

   Meanwhile, Sega X runs their review of Sonic A, as does
Videogames.com. Videogames.com also review onward to
"Tetris 4D."

   And Dreamcast-finally, take a look at Dreamcaster.net's
Release list. It's quite up-to-date, methinks.

   Oh! Wait! I found another site I think youse guys ought
to visit. It's run by a Japanese student (in Japan) whose
like really into Dreamcast. The whole site's in English,
too!
