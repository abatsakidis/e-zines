unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

   Oh MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can't believe all the PSX stuff today. I'm just foaming
at the mouth. I can't contain it all; my head's going to
blow (president clinton). Sorry, that joke was uncalled
for.
   In any case, there is an awful lot of PSX stuff today.
Lots of previews, reviews, news... Everything! But there's
also one little N64 items that 's sure you blow (heheh)
your mind.

-----------

   In fact, let's lead with N64 and that little item
that's gonna blow your mind this evening. Just a little 
interview with Titus, developers of the upcoming "Superman"
title. It's over on NintenDojo. Check it out. FGNOnline
reports that "Body Harvest" is coming out! They are real
skimpy on any details, I guess figuring everyone already
knows about it since it's been in development for three-
and-a-half years. So, I found a nice preview for ya at
Videogames.com.
   Oh, remember "Quest 64?" Sure, ya do. I do, too. Well,
can you believe that the Japanese version has yet to
be released? Well, I don't know if that's exactly true,
but 64 Source has news on a game based on it that's set
to hit Japan.
   I remembered this game yesterday from my NES days. You
raced little cars around twisty turvy tracks and, occa-
sionally, you could pick rockets and all kinds of stuff to
do away with your opponents! YES! RC Pro Am Racing! Re-
member? Well, guess what's destined to hit N64? No, not
RC Pro Am, but something similar. Details at 64 Source.
Meanwhile, N64 Gamer has the goods on the wrestlers
destined to be in the upcoming "WWF Attitude."
   Worried the little Pokemon critters won't make the
grade in the U.S. I say: B.S.! So does FGNOnline! They've
gots numbers to prove it. And when you're done with that,
check out news about a "Turok 2" comic book on 64Source!
   You know, it's not that I'm trying to hurt the PSX
fans in the audience, it's just that there's so much PSX
stuff today that if I were to put it up top (or in the 
middle) it would put the newsletter off-balance; it's
center of gravity would shift. Next thing you know, I'm
being sued by unfortunate souls whose Otakuboy fell on 
their heads. I'm not risking it, fella. We'll get to PSX
a little later
   So, on to Dreamcast and a super nifty feature on IGN
Dreamcast that lists every single title done and in-
development title, each with a small descriptive blurb
designed to satisfy that gnawing Dreamcast hunger. (IGN
Dreamcast REALLY satisfies!) Then head on over to 
Dreamcaster.net and check out second titles coming from
Game Arts and Warp. Also on Dreamcaster.net: a tiny
story that maybe, just maybe, "Virtua Fighter RPG"
is a hoax or vaporware or piss-you-off-ware.
   Meanwhile, I've been trying, like the dickens --
Charles Dickens -- to find you a content filled news
story about Namco's new arcade board and how to relates
to Dreamcast. I CAN'T FIND ONE. Everyone has these tiny
stories ranging from "Namco has a new arcade board, cha
cha cha," to "Namco has a new arcade board, cha cha cha,
sir!" So, I've pulled together the best three stories --
from Digital Ages, Dreamcaster.net, and SegaX. Check them
all out for facts, analysis, and cha cha cha!
   And in Saturn info: Capcom just may have lost its 
patience with the machine. What do you I mean? I don't
mean anything. But Digital Ages does.
   Ok all you PSX groupies! (I count myself among your
breast-heavin' brethren.) First, we've been seeing a lot
of Tokyo Game Show stuff, but most of it focuses on the
Sega CreamFest. So, what about a Tokyo Game Show wrap-up
from the PSX-perspective? PSXMax puts on Sega-blinders
for you and pulls out all the Sony stuff. Also on PSXMax:
Kingboxer is back with a new set of rumors, including a
news of a new fighter or two. (Why can't they have "lover"
games? Say a game where you take someone out on a date.
Ah, what fun.)
   Capcom visited IGNPSX today -- and mowed every employee
down. No, seriously, they brought "Street Fighter Alpha 3"
with them. IGNPSX has a tiny review and a set of shots.
Bless Console Domain's heart for writing two blockbuster
previews today -- they're damn near reviews. Find out
the info on "Populous: The Beginning" and "Starcon!" And
if you like to play contrast-and-compare, please head
on over to Gamepost for ANOTHER preview of Populous.
   Hype.se previews "RC Stunt Copter." The game seemed so
silly I had to include a link to the preview! ;) Also,
Videogames.com rams you upside yo' head with two cool
previews: Shots of the upcoming RPG powerhouse "Suikoden 2"
and shots and a movie of "Twisted Metal 3." Want my advice?
Skip Twisted Metal shots; go for the movie. 
   Hehehehe. Videogames.com also has an import-review of 
"All Japan Woman Pro Wrestling." I won't tell you how the
review went, but I say wait for "All Japan Woman Pro Mud
Wrestling" and "All Japan Woman Pro Jello Wrestling." Ah,
brings back the good ole' days, don't it? I mean "Activision
Classics." Digital Ages reviews. Meanwhile, Videogames.com
runs a review of "Bomberman World," the first PSX 
Bomberman Title. 
   Dum-de-dum... OH! Here's a couple of last minute items.
FGNOnline has news of the release of "Duke Nukem: Time To
Kill," and on a possible "Lego Racers" for PSX? Wow!
   Gamespot runs the full story on a Psygnosis shop-
closings in England. And -- GASP -- Square closes an
FMV shop? Say it ain't so, FGNOnline!
   Uncontrolled. Unhinged. Uninspirational. This is 
Otakuboy. And I am history.
