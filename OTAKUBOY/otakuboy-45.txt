   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   OtakuBoy is OtakuSad tonight. :( Pardon this self-indul-
gence for a second. Our beloved family pet has disappeared.
No, I'm not kidding. We heard a cat scream or caterwaul or
something, got up to look for her, and we haven't been able
to locate her since. It's terrible not knowing...

   May you not have the same thing happen to your pet.

   Sorry to have opened on such a bad note, but it's been a
hard day's night. And I might be a little off.

   Ahem.

-----------

Nintendo 64 (N64)

   You drop the bomb on me, baby. That's what many a-press
member thought as they heard Acclaim mention in an investor
conference a new SEQUEL to Turok 2? And, get this? It's comin
in December! Oh, my. Hey, maybe this version of Turok won't
have mysterious crashes!

   Miyamoto. The man. The legend. The rock hard abs. In
GameSpot TV's streaming-video interview, you can almost
touch his abs. Shudder. Check out GameSpot TV.

   Soooooooo... what's bein' released in Japan these days?
IGN64 takes a look and provides a detailed release date list.

   Hey! Did you know that "Vigilante 8" on the N64 is gonna
have a .5? OH, that doesn't make much sense, does it? Well,
I mean that N64 Vigilante 8 players will get extra levels!
Details at Gamers Republic.

   SOSA? What is that? Oh, yeah, he played basketball? Eh?
So, then why is EA puttin' him in "Tripe Play 2000." Oh, I
tell ya. This crazy industry. It is to laugh. Basketball
players in baseball games. They shoulda put that soccer play-
er McGwire in. Yeah. Chuckle.

   Meanwhile, lotsa sites are a-titter about the new "Top
Gear X" comin' soon. Yep, the racer is back. FGNOnline has
a big dose of details. Speaking of Back -- or, in this case,
'pushed back' -- GameFan reports that "WinBack" has been de-
layed.

   Lotsa sites announced that "SnowBoard Kids 2" is comin'.
But GameFan has a cool preview. Check it out. Meanwhile,
over on RareNet, a better quality pic from "Donkey Kong 64."
(Actually, the name of the game might be 'Donkey Kong Coun-
try 64.' Ah. Who knows?)

   Can someone tell me why the d00d in "Jet Force Gemini"
looks like Mega Man? Anyhoo, 64 Source has a preview, com-
plete with new pics from RareNet.

   Videogames.com has a super big "Rogue Squadron" game 
guide. Lotsa Usenetters have been crying over this game. 
"How do you defeat the walkers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Well, here it is. And don't use so many exclamation points
next time.

   From The Nth Dimension comes this quick news note: Do
you wanna see "DragonBallZ 64?" Well, then you gotta sign
the petition! Send e-mail already!


GameBoy Color (GBC)

   Hey, we mentioned here earlier that a buncha new Pokemon
are comin', right? Er.. I hoped we mentioned it. Anyway, in
case you wanna know, GameBoy Euro-Asia has put together a
reeeeeeeeeeeeel nice FAQ about the upcomin' carts. Gotta
catch 'em all, and then gold and silver plate 'em.

   GBCDojo reports on "Carrot Crazy," the new Looney Tunes
title starring Bugsy Siegel. Sorry, I mean Bugs Bunny. Mean-
while GameBoy Euro-Asia reports that "Bust-A-Move 3" WILL
appear on GameBoy Color. And on Game Informer, news that
"NHL Blads of Steel '99" and "NBA In The Zone '99" are 
comin'. 

   Oh? You wanna GameBoy review? Wellll, Gaming-Age reviews
"Oddworld Adventures." How's that?


PlayStation (PSX) 

   Uh oh. Remember the 32X? It was a game enhancing peri-
pheral for the Genesis. Really, it was a stop gap between 
16 and 32 bit. PlayStation was comin'. Sega had to keep the
Genesis d00dz in the ranks. Sooo, come out with something 
that'll keep 'em around, right?
   Well, it was cool! But people wanted new consoles! And
now IGNPSX has a big report about some kind of PSX 1.5?
Please. No. Please! Just release the 128-bit PSX!
PLEEEEEZE!

   Oh, dear. All kinds-a places on the Web reported that
Sony was suing Connectix over their PSX emulator for the
Macintosh. Well, 'taint true! So says Connectix through
GameSpot. Also on GameSpot, a "hands-on" review of the emu-
lator. (So, what would a hands-off review be? 'I sat there
and thought 'start,' but it didn't work. 2.8!)

   Yehawww! When "Tomorrow Never Dies" hits the PSX, it's 
gonna have MULTIPLAYER! Wee hooooo. Check out FGNOnline for
the info.

(REPEAT PARAGRAPH WARNING)
   SOSA? What is that? Oh, yeah, he played basketball? Eh?
So, then why is EA puttin' him in "Tripe Play 2000." Oh, I
tell ya. This crazy industry. It is to laugh. Basketball
players in baseball games. They shoulda put that soccer play-
er McGwire in. Yeah. Chuckle.

   Dance! Dance! Dance! "Dance Dance Revolution," Konami's
super arcade title, is comin' to PSX! Konami hopes you'll
practice at home with the included foot peddles and go
perform at the arcade. I wonder if it has a waltz?

   FGNOnline reports there are TWO new "Final Fantasy VIII"
characters -- Ward Zaback and Kiros Seagul. You can find 
out a little about them on the site. Meanwhile, over on
Gamers Republic, news that Japanese FF8 pre-orders are
gettin way outta hand!

   Hey, PSX-ers! I hope you're not too upset about the
upcomin' "Castlevania 64." Well, if you are, take a look
at the "Legend of The Vampire Hunter." Maybe it's enough
to satisfy that craving... chOMP! Gamers Republic.

   Vidoegames.com reviews "Ehrgeiz," the super new "Square
Fighter" in Japan. On GameFan -- it's not a stick and it
doesn't really irritate me, so why's it called "Irritating
Stick?" GameFan has that review. Over on GameCenter, a re-
viewer is none too happy with "Twisted Metal 3." But, then
again, he says up front he's never been happy with it. 
OtakuBoy lets you know the bias BEFORE you go in to the
review! ;) And Videogamers.com takes a look at the "no
batteries version" of the Mad Catz Dual Force Analog
Controller. (Say that really fast.)

   PSX-Finally, why not make sure you beat "Crash
Bandicoot 3?" Check out Game Informer's game guide!


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   SOA talks DC on MSNBC ASAP. D-Tails on Sega X. (Trans-
lation: Sega of America talked about the Dreamcast to 
MSNBC. Sega X has a report.)

   WOW! "NiGHTS 2" comin' to Dreamcast? Apparently, a 
Chinese game paper Game Weekly thinks so. And they say the
Sonic Team is behind it! Check out FGNOnline for more.

   And here's news about other things that might be comin'
to Dreamcast. "Street Fighter Zero 3?" Details on Sega-
Otaku. "Rally Championship '99?" Details on Dreamcaster.

   But we do know that "Climax Landers" is comin' at some
point. Well, Magic Box has a bit more about the plot. Just
remember, you gotta do some scrollin' to find it! I provide
a clue.

   100,000 on the Internet via Dreamcast?! What in the world
are they doing? I KNOW! They're SENDING ME ICQ CHAT REQUESTS
AlL NiGhT LoOnG! Anyway, Nikkei has the info. Meanwhile, if
you'd like to know more about the modem inside the Dreamcast
check out the story on Katana-Edge. 

   Hey! SegaNet has an MPEG of the new "Sega Rally 2" ad
runnin' in Japan. It's really, really cool. Worth the down-
load. Not only for the in-game sequence, but you get to 
see the ending Dreamcast tag-line. Something a-kin to "Play-
Stay-Shun."

   SegaX reviews -- get this -- the VMS system. This is a 
really cool review. Check it out. Meanwhile, SegaNet takes
a look at Shenmue, the marketing engine. It's all about the
extra stuff you're gonna be able to buy.


Multi-format & Misc

   Hey! Wanna know what the producer of the PokeMon TV 
series and movies is up to in Japan? It's a pretty cool
feature over on Nikkei Weekly.

   And lastly, I just like the name of this mag... NEO
GEO FREAK! Heheheheheh. I am a GAME FREAK! (I'm a freak of
many other types, too, but I digress.)

Cheers, folks.

             See a cool story? Send it to me!
