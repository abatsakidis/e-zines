Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   YeS!! Guess what debuted! YeS! It's SEGA RALLY 2, and the
net is all a-titter over it. Yes, there's a lot of a-titting
going on.

   First, check out SegaX for their reviews. If for any-
thing, go here for all the durn pics! They've got TONS of
them. Second, head on over to National Console Support for
their quick first impression. I especially like this one 
because they dwell (lovingly -- it's almost like a caress!)
on how the controller handles. Next, Dimension-S has their
review. It's a really big, pos-o-tive review with the phrase
"MUST HAVE" involved. Finally, head on back to SegaX for
their manual scans. 

   Whoops. One last item. On FGNOnline is a look at the
latest Famitsu SEGA RALLY 2 ratings. Turns out the little
racer got a pretty good score! 

   COOL! Over on Game-Online is news that the NAOMI arcade
board debuted at a tradeshow in the last day! You see, Game-
Online is in the U.K. and so was the show, so they were in
P-rime position to see it. They've got pics and everything.
(Oh, and in case you don't know WHY I'm talking about this
in the Dreamcast section... The NAOMI is pretty much the
arcade cousin of the Dreamcast. So, nearly any game built
for NAOMI can port to Dreamcast easily. Note, though, I said
NEARLY any. Several NAOMIs can be linked together for whiz-
bang arcade power. Several Dreamcasts can not be linked
together for whiz-bang console power.)

   Ahem. ReTokyo has a nifty story about KOEI's upcoming
titles. Not all that many pictures, except one teaser pic
of NANATSU NO HIKAN, a kinda life-style RPG. Check out the
male's legs in the shot. Are those straws or WHAT?!

   WOW! SHENMUE VMS game to pop on Sega's Web site on the
February 14? WOW! This news comes from Magic Box and re-
ported all over the Web, including the place I grabbed a
link -- Katana-Edge! Anyhoo, if you're one of the lucky bums
to have a Dreamcast AND a VMS, then you're gonna be able to
play a bit of Shenmue before anyone else does! Meanwhile,
check out Digital-Ages for a look into a nifty place you're
gonna be able to travel to in the SHENMUE world. Think
Outrun. Think Space Harrier.

   Ahhh... Here's a title we haven't heard from in awhile.
BLUE STINGER! SegaX has new pics. Over on Digital-Ages, a
tiny list of all the titles compatible with Sega's new VGA-
box. 

   Next-Generation Online has a super big preview of 
POWERSTONE! Actually, truth be told... It sucks. Just kid-
ding. But there is a lot of stuff you've seen all over the
Web before. But.. and here's the kicker.. Next-Generation
Online runs through all the characters! COOL!

   And speaking of previews, SegaX has a great preview of
MARIONETTE HANDLER! This one looks really, really cool. 
Classic mecha stuff... if you like mecha. And I like mecha.
Did I mention I like mecha? 

   Videogamenews.com -- which actually hasn't launched yet
-- runs an interview with a supposed Sega developer about
the Dreamcast kits. Hey, who really knows if it's true, but
the guy/gal seems to know what he/she's talking about. Yes,
indeedy-do. So, anyhoo, the site hasn't launched, but I 
have the interim IP address. 

   And Dreamcast/Sega finally, check out the news on 
National Console Support about the new Sega SGX system. Oh?
Don't know what it is? Where've you been? (Where've I been?)
It's a coin-operated Saturn comin' to an arcade near you...
hopefully.


===========OTAKUBOY SAY TO VISIT THIS DUDE, EH!=============
              What are people saying about the
               Multiverser role playing game?

     "This game has got the most promise as anything
        I have seen in 20 years and I'll stand by
           every word of it. Great work guys."
                --Grover Penn, RPGNet 

      This is the game that makes good use of all the
             crap that you bought in the past.

Nintendo 64 (N64)

   If you ever pop your head into Usenet, you're bound to
see the question...
  
   duds, iam nintindo 64 player and id like to want to play
nintindo 64 games on my computer. do u duds know where i
cn get a cool emilator so i can play nintindo 64 on my 
computer?

   Well, wait no more my misspelling friend. Someone FINALLY
wrote an emulator. And you know what? The durn thing works!
Check out IGN64 for the info, who's absolutely aghast over
the whole thing. Also at IGN64, a quick news bite about a
supposed N64 modem. (Yay! N64 owners can meet Dreamcast
owners in chat rooms and yell at each other! ALL RIGHT!!!)

   Hey, you know QUAKE II is comin' out soon for the N64,
right? RIGHT?! Well, Console Domain has some cool pics of
the action. (I suppose if you've been playing Quake II on
your PC, you won't be all that impressed. It's looks the
same to me!) Anyhoo, IGN64 has some MARIO PARTY movies!
Watch out though; they're kinda buried at the bottom of
a large preview.

   FGNOnline has the news that LODE RUNNER 3D is comin' to
N64! Heh... I think I kinda spoiled the story, cause that's
all it says, really. Anyhoo, check out FGNOnline if you 
want no more info. Meanwhile, Digital-Ages wonders if SMASH
BROTHERS is really comin' to the U.S. (Seems ole Nintendo
denied the rumors that it wasn't coming... but didn't say 
it was either.) IGN64 says it looks like FIGHTING FORCE
ain't comin' after all! What the dilly, yo? 

   Game-Online has a super-illustrated (meaning lots o' 
pics) preview of RALLY MASTERS, a cool racer. Right now,
it's a PC title, but an N64 version is planned. Check it
out.

   Hey, remember that CASTLEVANIA 64 debuted this week. And
lots o' sites have reviews. IGN64 has the largest, but you
have to watch out -- much of it is a re-print of a previous
preview. (Hey, that previous preview was durn good with lots
of info. I'm just warnin' ya in case you read it already.)
Nintendojo has a review, and the reviewer seems particularly
good at catching technical flaws. (Broken mirrors that mys-
teriously mend themselves?) And, finally, Videogames.com
has their review. The reviewer seems to have a bit of a chip
on his shoulder. That's my take. But it _is_ positive over-
all.

   Gotta tape 'em all. Yes, yes, another Pokemon story. 
Seems like KIDS WB has picked it up and will start airing
new and used episodes in February. Go to IGN64 for the info.


GameBoy Color (GBC)

   GameBoy Euro-Asia spied a nifty side-by-side spec-compar-
ison of GameBoy Color and Neo Geo Pocket. Wow! It looks like
the Pocket has the GBC beat technically. But what can you
PLAY on the pocket? Ahem.

   Console Domain has a tiny preview of CONKER'S POCKET
TALES, an RPG. Check out the pics. 

   GameBoy Euro-Asia reviews RATS, a pretty strange 2D plat-
former that looks familiar... Yes, it's familiar. It's like
uhm... no! This isn't MAPPY is it? Over on GameBoyDojo, see
the LAS VEGAS COOL HAND review. Yuk. (Sorry, personal opin-
ion.)


PlayStation (PSX)

   I got a message the other day from someone who wanted to
know if I was a PlayStation hater. To his credit, he hadn't
seen the newsletter yet. I guess he was wondering if I was 
gonna bash any systems! NOOOOO! I love ALL consoles. ALL
consoles! ALL! Even the old ones. They're all worth owning,
all worth playing. Yes.

   But maybe a couple of you might fault me for not putting
this next news waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay at the top. 
GameFan sticks out its neck and gives up a PlayStation 2
arrival date. They even classify it as HOT INFO. Seems like
they found a "nice juicy bit o' info" in some other story
that points to a certain date. Welll... I am skeptical.
Sorry.

   Here's one reason why: Over on PSXNation, THEY have a 
story about Sony and Ken "Seed of PlayStation" Kutaragi
appearing at a technical show in the near future. PSXNation
seems to think that, among the new technology Kutaragi is
bound to talk about, they will announce PlayStation 2. 
Then, over on GameSpot, news about a new OS that looks to
be the OS for PSX2! Really? I'm skeptical. No, I'm cynical!

   JEEZ! PlayStation Fan just keeps on getting GOOD inter-
views! I can't believe it. This one's with Chris Gibbs, 
Managing Director at ATD. They talk about Rollcage -- devel-
opment, artwork, playability, long nights alone with a bot-
tle of Vasaline. It's actually quite profound. ;) It's a
cool interview. GOTTA READ 'EM ALL!

   PocketStation finally debuted to Japan! And.. DURN! ..
they're all sold out already! None left! NONE! N.O.N.E.
Retailers don't know when they're gonna get any more.
Check out Console Domain for the news.

   Well, DUH! DUh! Guess who's suing Connectix, makers of
the PlayStation emulator for Mac. IGNPSX has this info and
they investigate Sony's claims of Connectix harming the
"PlayStation experience." Ahem. Meanwhile, PSXNation has
news of a new version of the emulator.

   Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey! Guess who's brining GRANDIA to the
U.S.! SONY! Why is that a big deal? Because the gaming sites
SAY it is! And who am I to question? No, seriously, the 
reason for it is that GRANDIA, for those who don't know, is
a Saturn RPG.

   IGNPSX has what they call "first details" on GRAN TURISMO
2!! It's pretty good, 2. Meanwhile, PSXMax has news that 
Sony has just registered "granturismo2.com" with InterNIC.
Here comes a cool Web site, folks. Fo'sho! 

   Cooooool... Word from Magic Box is that Dreamworks is
preparing JURRASIC PARK: WARPATH for PlayStation. A friend
o' mine says TRESPASSER on the PC is super, super easy. 
Hopefully this one'll be hard. (Why am I hoping for that?!)
Meanwhile, FGNOnline posts the new features to the upcoming
WWF ATTITUDE -- multiple camera angles, new "weapons," and
more. Meanwhile, over on IGNPSX, news that QUAKE II for the
PSX has been DELAYED! FRAK!!

   Re:Tokyo profiles two new "fishing controllers" for the
PSX that are gonna work with all those nifty fishing games.
Also in the same story, a preview of every single fishing
game out and coming-out. It's multi-platform, though. So,
watch out.

   REPEAT, BUT SLIGHTLY EDITED, PARAGRAPH ALERT! Game-Online
has a super-illustrated (meaning lots o' pics) preview of
RALLY MASTERS, a cool racer. Right now, it's a PC title, but
a PSX version is planned. Check it out. 

   A "90" for STREET FIGHTER ZERO 3? Yes, says Gaming-Age.
Check out their review.

   And here's something really neat for all you long-time
Square fans. Gaming-Age runs a special about the OGOPOGO
EXAMINER, Square's old company newsletter. And they've even
gots pics!


Multi-Format & Misc

   ANOTHER REPEAT, BUT SLIGHTLY-EDITED, PARAGRAPH ALERT!
Re:Tokyo profiles two new "fishing controllers" that are
gonna work with all those nifty fishing games. Also in the
same story, a preview of every single fishing game out and
coming-out.
