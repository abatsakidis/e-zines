   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Wot Da FLOCK?! What's with all this Nintendo news? I 
can't believe it! Even sites that don't cover Nintendo re-
registered their domain names to include "nintendo" in them!

   Ok, I'm kidding on that last part.

-----------

Nintendo 64 (N64)

   But I'm not kidding about all this Nintendo stuff. I 
really can't believe it. No, I won't believe it! Don't try
to make me believe it! DON'T!

   64 Source pulls out a pair of scissors and runs around
the room. Fortunately no one was hurt. Well, no one except
a poor issue of Next Generation, whose articles were stab-
bed and cut into tiny little pieces. However some sentences
survived intact. They're on 64 Source. First piece? A bit
from Miyamoto (youamoto, wouldn'tyouliketobeamoto,too) about
portions of the Zelda game that were made for the 64DD and
how they might appear in a special edition Zelda game next
year. The second piece? The status of Mario 64. I can sum
it up one word: NOWHERE! Speaking of Miyamoto, the ole puppy
is gonna be at the Computer Game Developer's Conference. 
What's he gonna say? Who will cater? And will he order from
the local red light district? Find out about it all at
Nth-Dimension. Or you can read Nintendo's press release!

   Gaming-Age picked up on a news-bit, a nasty one. Capcom
is NOT behind the upcoming N64 version of Biohazard/Resident
Evil! Nope! Unlike reports to the contrary, it seems that
some unknown developer's doin' it! NO! Speaking of things
reported to the contrary, we've heard that "Turok 3" is 
comin'.. but HOLD THE HORSES, says Acclaim! Yes, there will
be a "Turok 3." But by this Christmas? The spokesperson 
then proceeded to laugh. Check out FGNOnline for that bit o'
news. In other Acclaim news, looks like a "South Park 64"
sequel is in the works. IGN64 has the details. And this
just in: Instead of fixing the Turok engine, the next ver-
sion of South Park will be called "South Park, Foggy South
Park."

   In other big gaming news, many sites picked up a story
from www.countingdown.com -- about up-coming Star Wars
titles that will coincide with the release of The
Phantom Menace later this year. A racer for the N64? "Pod
Racer?" News from Skywalker Ranch on GameFan and Game
Informer. Game Informer's story is bigger, more fleshed out,
methinks.

   This one's confusing. Try to follow along. "Virtual Pool
64" debuted in December. It is OUT! But Game-Online says
Interplay will release it soon! So, what's this? Well, seems
like ole Interplay will release it in the U.K. this year!
So, all your U.K.-ites! Check out the newsbit on Game-Online
and the review on IGN64!

   Oh, my my. Oh HELL YES! Videogames.com previews "Beetle
Adventure Racing." Lotsa sites talk about it today, but I
like the preview there. Meanwhile, we've read that "WinBACK"
has been delayed until -- like -- fall! Well, Game Informer
has a pretty nifty preview! And GI tells you that the game
will be worth the wait. 

   And N64-Finally, Nintendo Underground takes a stab -- or
is that g-string -- at what the next Nintendo will look 
like! And let me, for a second, offer some subject lines
for those of you who believe this and will post to Usenet
asking if its true.

"I LIKE THE NEW NINTENDO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"IS this neww nintendo TRUTH?!?!?!?!"
"va-va-va-vooooooooooooooooooooooooom"


GameBoy Color (GBC)

   WOW! Lotsa cool stuff on GameBoy Euro-Asia tonight! Very
cool! I can't believe it! Oh, I'm sick! UGH! All the foll-
owing comes from their site!

   Live from the Skywalker Ranch! It's rumors about Phantom
Menance games on GameBoy -- specifically the RPG that's
supposed to be in-development.

   Pokemon keeps on comin'! WHEN WILL IT STOP! Please. ;)
Anyhoo, check out the information on "Pokemon Pinball!"
Gotta hit 'em all with a flipper. (The phrase can be bent
to fit any means!)

   WOAH! You've got to check out the color in the upcoming
"Bust-A-Move 3!" Certainly the best color GameBoy Color has
seen yet! "COITANLY!" -- Curly

   Also, a quick news note about "Ganbare Goemon." Yeah, the
semi-cool blue-haired ninja-go-lucky comes to GameBoy in his
first RPG!


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   Oh, how OtakuBoy loves interviews. Picking the brains of
the industry elite. Makes me long for the days when I devel-
oped award-winning, mega-selling Atari 2600 games. Yes, 
folks. I rule.

   Anyway, SegaX has the cool interview o' the night this 
time! It's an interview with Team 17. They're doing "Worms
Armageddon" among other things. Check out SegaX for the Q&A.
Also on SegaX, a NEW D2 Movie!

   Speaking of new movies, Console Domain has a new 
"Shenmue" movie and Dreamcaster has new "Evolution" movies! 
And wrapping up the eye-candy links, Sega X has pics of the
upcoming "Marvel vs. Capcom!" Gotta fight 'em all. (Sorry,
I'm still thinking about Pokemon.)

   Are you bugged with the glitches in "Sonic Adventure?"
I WISH I could be. Anyway, I didn't know there were glit-
ches. But apparently Sega thinks so -- camera angles and
stuff. So, they're going to fix 'em before ole blue boy
comes to the U.S. (Sonic! You're my hero!) Quick news note
on Console Domain, a bigger story over on SegaNet.

   The Puru Puru is on the way! (Readers of OtakuBoy will
notice the similarity of "puru puru" to "puri puri." This
is because game sites frequently change the spelling of 
Japanese names just enough to confuse the world.) Anyway,
this is the device that will rumble and shock, much like 
the current Rumble Pak and Dual Shock. FGNOnline has news
about its release!

   The sequel to "Death Crimson" has been confirmed for 
Dreamcast! So says Sega X! This is good news... unless of
course you think the original sucked. SegaX doesn't think
so, but GameSpot does. So, pick the one that best suits
your own opinion.

   Meanwhile, Katana-Edge hears Midway's "Hydro Thunder"
will make an appearance on Dreamcast. Cool. Check out the
info there. Dreamcaster hears that another of Rage's super-
cool PC games, "Expendable," will make its way to DC. Check
out info and pics on Dreamcaster. 

   And this one deserves its own space. SegaX hears that 
maybe, possibly, perhaps Konami is dreaming up a Castlevania
for Dreamcast?!?!? COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!

   Videogames.com has some super cool Japanese title re-
views. They take a long look at "Incoming" and "Seventh
Cross." 

   Meanwhile, in a tiny bit o' Saturn news -- FGNOnline re-
ports that "Dungeon & Dragons Collection" for Saturn is fin-
ally comin'! Long live the Saturn! Long live all game 
machines! Viva la games!


PlayStation (PSX) 

   "PaRappa 2" looks cool! Wanna know how I know that? Cause
GameSpot has pics! Also on GameSpot, a report that the up-
coming "Final Fantasy Collection" will come with all kinds
of new art and tuff. And again on GameSpot, news about 
"Odekake Chocobo" a game for the upcoming PocketStation!

   And speaking of PocketStation, check out "Pi to Mail." 
It's gonna allow you to send something like mail between
PocketStations. Incidentally, this story has some cool pho-
tos of the PocketStation ad running in Japan.

   Hey! "Gengis Khan IV" is comin' to Japan! Cool. What is
it? Hey, OtakuBoy can't know everything. (Well, yeah he can,
but he falls down on this one.) However, I do know about
Pepsiman! He's the lovable d00d in Japanese Pepsi ads. Well, 
he's comin to PSX in Japan! COOL!

   AND PSX-Finally, PSXNation previews "Blast Radius," an
upcoming shooter from Psygnosis.


Multi-format & Misc

   Run! Don't walk to your mouse button and Re:Tokyo. They
check out "Comic Market 55," a super cool fan convention!
VIVA LA FANS! Check out the pics, too.

   Euro-Asia GameBoy reports: When is WonderSwan gonna be
available in Japan? Also, see the cool pic of it. That's
one stylish little thingy.

Cheers, folks.

             See a cool story? Send it to me!
