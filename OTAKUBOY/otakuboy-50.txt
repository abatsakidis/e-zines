   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Welp, Dreamcast comes out at the top again. So many cool
thingies on the Web tonight. It's like there's a party in 
my mouth and everyone's invited! 

-----------

Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   And speaking of my mouth... Er... No, that joke's not
going anywhere. Anyway, this is the COOOLEST THING I'VE
EVER FOUND on the Dreamcast sites. It's from a new member
of the OtakuBoy library -- Dimension-S. They have a "Sonic
Jukebox" which features all the nifty tunes in SONIC
ADVENTURE. They're all in RealAudio format, so ya gotta have
RealPlayer or some junk to play it. COOL!

   Here's something else that's cool. Rabid-Readers (tm) of
OtakuBoy know that I visit National Console Support for news
about Japanese games. Right? Well, SegaX has a super cool
interview with the owner, Peter Mui. They talk about the
importing scene, how the Dreamcast has done so far, what
games and stuff are really hot now, everything! EVERYTHING!
Check it out at Sega X.

   Lots o' POWERSTONE info tonight. I canna believe it. 
First Gamer's Republic slapped together a pretty nifty pre-
view of the title with some new pics. (Hey, it looks like
I'm gonna be able to throw furniture in this game. HAHA, 
MOM! I told you all that practice would help me! Mean-
while, FGNOnline has word about the game's release date.
Seems ole Capcom likes the U.S. Dreamcast launch date?
It's on FGNOnline.

   WOOOOHOOOOOOOO! New CLIMAX LANDERS pictures! Straight
from the mouths of Sega-Otaku. Over on SegaX, new info and
the overview of AERODANCERS. That's one we haven't heard 
from in awhile. Also on Sega X, they score some early 
concept sketches for BERSERK! It's a better story if you
want to know the insides of a game's concept stage, me-
thinks.

   Next-Generation Online has the latest Dreamcast software
sales figures. Not too shabby. But then again, I think even
one sale is "not too shabby," so wot da heck do I know?

   Over on FGNOnline is a tiny bit o' news that U.S. ver-
sions of SONIC ADVENTURE and SHENMUE are already in devel-
opment for U.S. Dreamcasts! What's going to change in them?
Not much, especially in SHENMUE! Check out FGNOnline.

   And if all this Dreamcast news makes you weak in your
backside. (I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR WALLET, PEOPLE! Don't 
accuse me of writing racy stuff here.) Head on over to SegaX
for a big list of all the Web Dreamcast importers and their
current prices.

   Dreamcast FINALLY, hankering to take a look at the hard-
ware box Dreamcast developers use to make cool games? A pic
of it's over on Dreamcaster!

Nintendo 64 (N64)

   Ha HA! In the just a few measly months (those months 
ought to get innoculated for the measlies), you're gonna
have to catch 100 more of 'em! Don't know what I mean?! It's
POKEMON, silly! Check out FGNOnline for the latest. Mean-
while, over on IGN64, take a look at POKEMON SNAP. It's 
Pokemon with all the 3D trimmings. And, get this, the main
point of the game is to go on a photo safari? Hmmm. Anyway,
in case you don't like Pokemon, IGN64 has a picture of a
staff member expressing his love for Pikachu. It's a might
sick, let me tell ya.

   Oh, ya gotta love the Net. First the license for the
new James Bond game THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH was handed to
Rare and Nintendo. THEN we hear that the new game is for
Nintendo's NEXT machine (N2000?). THEN we hear that it's
going to be developed for the N64 after all! NOW we hear
that neither Nintendo nor Rare will get their developin'
hands on it! MGM will, BABY! MGM! Details on IGN64.

   IGN64 also scores a neat interview with Darren Falcus,
Managing Director for SHADOW MAN. Read what he has to say
about how great he is... I mean, how great the title is.
What's in the interview? Well how about the SHADOW MAN ain't
no cute, cuddly game. In fact, Falcus calls it "psychologi-
cally disturbing!" That's what I NEED! Details on IGN64.
Also on IGN64, a look at KYOJIN NO DOSHIN. HEH! You giant,
you. 

   64 Source has the latest Japanese retails numbers and
HOLY FRAK!!!!!! Look at the GameBoy Color, baby, shootin'
its way past everyone! YOIKS! Also on 64 Source, a blast
to the past with a FAQ on WAVE RACE 64.


GameBoy Color (GBC)

   In an OtakuBoy issue that has the COOLEST THING I HAVE
EVER FOUND... I've also found the worse, I'm sorry to say.
Folks, hold on to your white, puffy hats... The Smurfs are
back. Yes. So says GameBoy Color Fan, a new site to the
O.O. roster. The game? SMURFS NIGHTMARE. And it is a night-
mare. For US! Details there.

   Having trouble finding the right girl? Not sure what to
say when you spill your maple syrup collection all over a
female friend's favorite blouse? Well, maybe TOKIMEKI 
MEMORIAL can help you. It's Konami's favorite dating game.
And NOW it's comin' to GameBoy Color. So says GameBoy
Euro-Asia.

   Some other things on GameBoy Euro-Asia: Pics and word
that TOP GEAR POCKET is heading to GBC. So is POYON DUNGEON
ROOM and OODOROBOU JING, which is kinda like a Pokemon game.
Also, if you're fan of both Doraemon Comics AND Mario Kart,
then you're gonna wanna know about DORAEMON KART 2!


PlayStation (PSX)

   OOooooOOoOoooOOooOOh Next-Generation Online has a LARGE
preview of SILENT HILL, which is supposed to be Konami's
Resident Evil killer. Yeah, yeah, everyone wants to kill
Resident Evil. *sigh*

   From the artist of Ki Ki's Delivery Service comes JADE
COCOON: THE STORY OF TAMAMAYU. It's a NEW RPG, and GameFan
has the latest info. (Heck, the ONLY info!)

   Meanwhile, if you're looking for something to wrap your
brain around, how about a nice game of Chess? The W.O.P.R.
would approve. That's why CHESSMASTER MILLENIUM (guaranteed
to help destroy the world in the year 2000) is comin'. So
is PANZER GENERAL, the SSI war strategy title. This news
comes from IGNPSX. Also o IGNPSX, new pics from RACING
LAGOON from Square. A racer and an RPG? How can that be?

   Hmmmm.... I am wary. So wary. This next "news" makes me
wary. GameFan reports that UNREAL is comin' to the PSX. 
Really? This is what FGNOnline said last week -- then re-
tracted it. So, take it with a grain o' salt fellers. 

   Console Domain has a preview of SPORTS CAR GT. It's 
comin' soon, but no one knows much about it. :( I am going
to CRY! In the meantime, I'll check out these graphics;
they look COOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!

   GameCenter reviews APOCALYPSE and -- WOAH -- the dude
gives it FIVE X's! Jeez! Can it be that good? Meanwhile,
Videogames.com has a bigtime review of SUIKODEN II. They
say it's soo much like the original... Well, maybe that's
a Good Thing (tm).

   
Multi-Format & Misc

   Wanna learn how to collect games? Well, GameCenter'll
tell ya! (Quick note: This is more about PC games than any-
thing, but game collecting can extend to all kinds of 
places -- even places your hands shouldn't go.) Ahem.

   And, finally, check out Gamers Republic for the latest
word on Neo Geo Pocket confirmed games! It's mostly the
stuff we've seen in other places, but they've got COOL pics!

Cherrioes, folks! (Rice Krispies, Cocoa Puffs, etc.)

       See a cool story? cool site? Send it to me!
