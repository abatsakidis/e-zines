   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game zines -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to get them all.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Here's a mild revelation: The Nth Dimension proclaims
this week the "slowest news week" in the history of their
Web site. What was Nintendo thinking, eh? I suppose with
all the Dreamcast stupor going on, they figured they lay
low instead of competing with it.
  But that makes guys like me have to weigh down their
e-newsletters with Dreamcast stuff. :) 
   Well, shut my mouth. VERY little Dreamcast stuff 
today. Two items, really. Nintendo64 weighs in second
with a couple more. Playstation makes OtakuBoy top
heavy with all its news.

   OH, I teased you so well yesterday with those tantil-
izing PSX2 rumors. Now FGN reports on a European trade
paper's report (never believe that the press doesn't feed
off each other -- even the gaming press) that the 
PlayStation 2 will be shown... Well, just check it out at
FGN. Meanwhile, IGNPSX writes about the layout of Sony's
booth at the Tokyo Game Show. (Why won't these guys send
back lots of pictures? DAMN!)
   Videogames.com reviews "Duke Nukem Time to Kill." 
'Dukey,' as he's affectionately known around OtakuHQ, was
the first PC game I really -- REALLY -- liked. So, OtakuBoy
is real excited about DNTTK. But is Videogames.Com? Check 
it out. ConsoleDomain steps up with news about a new Dual
Force Steering Wheel for Dual Shock enabled racing titles.
You see, when you run into the railing (or off-road), you
get a mild electric shock! ;) Keneda over at ConsoleCity,
checks out "G Darius." And Digital-Ages previews Test Drive
5, due out soon.
   And we've shirked are RPG bretheren way too long here
at OtakuBoy. So, here's a nifty survey at ConsoleCity. Hey,
RPG Players! Let your voice be heard to three guys in a 
basement! I'm kidding; I'm kidding. Also, the Nice Guy
aware goes to Josh Walker. The guy knows how to read 
Japanese, so he goes on Square Japanese site and translates
info on a new RPG, "Another Mind." Watch out, though! The
bugger is FMV (Full Motion Video).
   Remember! The Nth Source says that this week has been
the slowest N64 news week! And it's true. Poor Mario. He
has to resort to playing with himself in the tub while 
everyone buzzes about DreamCast.
  But Nth Dimension missed this nifty item: GameWEEK
reports on news about a novel based on the upcoming
Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time! COOL! Read about
Link while you drop a few of your own. Sorry, that was 
really way outta line.
  And here's a .. er.. kinda N64-related bit. 64Source
does a big feature on Pokemon. They frame it a little
different though, asking: Is "GameBoy Pokemon" a success?
Then they go on a talk about all kinds of other Pokemon
related stuff.
   The Daily ReamCast: (oops, an unfortunately misspell)
IGNDreamcast shows off a small story about what's in Sega's
booth at the Tokyo Game Show. (AGAIN! WHERE ARE THE FARGIN'
PICTURES?!) And ConsoleCity shows up with a preview of 
"Virtua Figher 3." It looks really, really cool.
   Videogames.com runs with a feature on the best and worst
peripherals for all systems. Some of the best ideas turned
out to give the worst pain or something like that. It's a
good tip sheet on what to avoid and what to buy. And 
GameFan opens up "GEX The Videogame Archive." Where they
claim to have the "exclusive database of reviews, previews,
codes, pictures, videoclips," nippleclamps, wax, etc. Check
it out.
   Short one today fellers. Lots of people must-a took the
day off. :) And speaking of days off! I'll see you back 
here Monday! OtakuBoy out.
