   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Otakuboy say: What's wrong with red, blue, green, orange,
yellow, or even black? Why oh, why do companies have to 
gravitate their pretty little coloring heads to white or
pearl or gray? And even the "gunmetal gray" is getting old.
Why can't we have a console in a cool primary color? One
that screams from the shelf? BUY ME, YOU BASTARD! MY COLORED
BOTTOM IS WORTH YOUR HARD EARNED GREENS!

-----------

   With that yelled, I scream: WHY DOES DREAMCAST HAVE TO BE
THIS COLOR?! IGNDreamcast pipes up with some news on the
U.S. Dreamcast's color scheme? It's a rumor right now,
folks, but see why I scream so loudly.
   Meanwhile, some interesting news from Gaming-Age about a 
two year long RPG played in near real-time. How is this 
possible? How could it noT get boring? Go to Gaming-Age.
Speaking of RPGs-in-the-making, Yu Suzuki sneaks a couple
comments into the Japanese press on what it's like
to program for Dreamcast. GameFan has Suzuki's comments.
And from our Overkill file: Gaming-Age reports that Sega
will create a "Tetris" title for Dreamcast? Huh? Isn't 
that a lot like using a flame-thrower to make toast? 
   Sega X begins a cool feature - "Reputable Importers!"
[my title] Go there for an up-to-date list of whose gonna
be able to get Dreamcast for ya next month. Meanwhile,
check out the new D2 movies posted by none other than 
Gaming-Age. (Boy, they're really firing on all cylinders
today, aren't they! Cool site. Cool, cool, cool site!)
   Lots and lots of Dreamcast previews today... and more
to come, for sure, as we get closer to the Japanese launch.
First, Digital-Ages has a Super Preview (tm) of "Virtua
Figher 3 Team Battle." Yeah, yeah, I know what you're 
sayin: "I've seen it all before." But they've got new info!
Trust me. Meanwhile, Sega X reports on something to be 
included in each copy of VF3tb. And Videogames.com answers
Sega's claim that Dreamcast is "above Model 3 specs" and
what that means for VF3tb.
   Gaming-Age's got the goods on "Puyo Puyo." Hey, puyo
puyo my finger. Huhuh.. (Little Beavis and Butthead for ya.)
IGNDreamcast has news about a game, "Akihabara Denno-Gumi
Pies," which sounds an awful lot like the "dating game"
sites were reportin' about yesterday. IGNDreamcast has
some cursory information on GETBASS, in case you missed
the coverage from other sites. And, wrapping up Dreamcast
info, Sega X has a really good preview of "Evolution," a
razzle-dazzle RPG. 
   Rumors be flyin' today on the PSX sites. Check out 
PSXMax and the weekly gossip from Kingboxer, whose got
news on a new.. T-t-t-t-ekk ... No, I can't say it. I
just can't spoil it, fer ya. After ya finished, check out 
Off-The-Record at IGNPSX. 
   Ah, but this ain't no rumor: HardcoreGaming talks to
Larry Galka, Activision Producer of "Techu: Stealth
Assassins." 
   Hey, lookie here, it's nearly November and Square 
finalizes their release schedule for 1998. Feel the too-
little-too-late irony at IGNPSX. And PSXNation snoops
around Internic to find out what Sony might have in store
for ya. They've found a couple of note. And still more news
on "Street Fighter Alpha 3." This time it's Digital-Ages
with a bit of new news.
   Pop Quiz: If a game has "dismembered bodies, profanity,
and murder," what rating will it likely get? FGNOnline
has the rating-answer for "Clock Tower Two." Couple of
sites note EA's public confirmation they will keep the
X Games license. Tagged onto this at IGNPSX, a few shots
of "Pro Boarder." They promise a full preview tomorrow,
so stay tuned to OtakuBoy! We'll have the link.
   Sites have gone all Asteroids-c-c-c-crazy today! 
PSXNation's got news and a preview. IGNPSX carries a 
preview. Want concise? Go to PSXNation. Want in-depth? 
Go to IGNPSX. Ah, but you might want to try PSXNation 
first anyway. They've got the goods on developer 8th
Wonder's first PSX title. It's something to do with globes,
collecting, fondling, etc. And IGNPSX answers the question:
What's blurry and could kill "Gran Tourismo?" Plus,
Videogamers.com previews "Backstreet Billiards."
   ConsoleDomain wants you to know that "Spyro" is NOT a
kiddie game. So, STOP IT! Just STOP sayin' it is. Check
out their review. Also, Videogames.com review "Metal Gear
Solid." Wow! It really is a short game. I didn't believe it
before now. (Psssst.. type www.metalgear.com into your
browser. Just for fun.)
   Uh Oh. Usually, I'm an optimistic Otaku. Honest. I'm
optimisticking all over people's clothes, their lawns.
But I can't be optimistic about IGN64's latest report
on N64 Japanese sales numbers. What could it mean, fellow
N64-Otaku?! :( But always look on the brighter side, I 
say. Ignore that news and head to 64 Source for details
on the latest N64 releases. Get 'N' or Get Out! Plus,
64 Source reports who's gonna appear in "Ogre Battle."
Gotta catch 'em all! (Sorry, got carried away.)
   Remember that 80's song that went, "Peeeeeee-ka-booooo?"
Well, I have a new song: "Piiiiiii-ka-chuuuuuu!" Sing it!
It promotes health, honest! What could also promote health
is a set of Pokemon episodes for your VCR! Gotta buy 'em
all! And just in time for Halloween, The Nth Dimension
carries a new "Body Harvest" movie. Ah, download it.
It's only 6 mb.
   Just when you thought there couldn't be any more var-
iations on Tetris, here comes "Magical Tetris." Details at
FGN! And just what is "Tokimeki?" Gaming-Age knows. Check 
out their Preview. 
   IGN64 reviews Boring Arts... I mean, "Deadly Arts." My
apologies! And, WOW, 64 Source reviews "Madden '99!" Wowee!
Check it out.
   Hey, FGNOnline reports a famous character will be
coming to a console near you. I won't spoil it, but I will
say, Aye yiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyi! 64 Souce takes a look
at the history of and possible future finishing moves in
Fighters. (Warning: Nintendo slant/bias.) And Gaming-Age
has more "Final Fantasy VIII" pics! Cool!
   Otakuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuboy. Out.
