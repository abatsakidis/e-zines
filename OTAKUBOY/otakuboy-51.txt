Nintendo 64 (N64)

   Hehyahahhahaa. Over on Gaming-Age. Heyukhahahahahaha!

   Ahem. Meanwhile, IGN64 has a news-ish preview of --
get this -- a four player Tetris? Heh. TETRIS 64 is comin'.
IGN64 has the details.

   Yoiks! Looks like when WCW/nWo REVENGE hits Japan, it's
gonna have a lot more stuff in it than the U.S. version.
How much stuff? A LOT OF STUFF! Just ask Gaming-Age. And
speaking of expanded stuff, CASTLEVANIA 64's comin' out in
a day or two and GameSpot's got an interview with Konami
about it. Er... I'm not gonna lie. I wrote it.

   SHADOW MAN preview on IGN. Boy, does this game look like
the coolest thing you've ever seen or what? Oh yeah? Don't
believe me. Go and download the movies. (They say they're
the "first movies," but then again everyone says that.)

   Alright! Super review of SMASH BROTHERS over on Console
Domain. Viva la Console Domain with their bad selves and
their quick reviewin' type people. And, by the way, it's
just kinda hard to put Mario into a fighter and think of
him as a lean mean fightin' machine. He's just so darned
CUTE! Now, Samus? Link? Ah, now they look like ass kickers.

   And speaking of cute, more Pokemon episodes have been 
confirmed by the production company! Gotta tape 'em all.
Or if you miss an episode, you gotta rent 'em all, then
you gotta watch 'em all. Then you gotta tell your friends
about 'em all... Etc.

GameBoy Color (GBC)

   Hey, we've been hearin' a lot about the upcoming SUPER
MARIO BROS. for GameBoy Color. And why not? Retro-gaming is
IN, d00d. Well, everyone's also been a-titter about how 
much this new SMB looks like the NES one o' old. Game 
Informer decided to get to the bottom of it. Check out the
comparison pics in their preview. And then when you're
finished, go check out a little site on GeoCities.com. 
GameBoy Euro-Asia found it. Its author says that SUPER
MARIO is on DRUGS! 

   Meanwhile, MARIO GOLF is comin' to GBC. Check out Gaming-
Age for the latest. (Short, short story.)

   GamersRepublic wants you to stretch your legs and slide
in to their nice, comfy preview of BEATMANIA. They've got
lots of pictures -- ah, but don't go for them. (We've seen
'em all over the place before.) Go for the big paragraphs
filled with all kinds of game details.

   New review alert! GameBoy Euro-Asia takes a look at the
import PUYO PUYO SUN! 


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   Woah! Score ONE for Dimension-S! The d00ds get into a 
good interview like thingy with "Jez" of Sega Enterprises
and the Argonaut Group. They talk about the Dreamcast, about
Sega, about unwashed lederhosen, which -- ahm -- I under-
stand Mr. Jez likes an awful lot. ;) Excuse me for a second,
the lawyers are crowding in...

   Last issue, I sent you a link to the SONIC JUKEBOX! Re-
member? Well, maybe you can't hear what those durn singers
are sayin. So, SegaNet put together a bunch-a lyric sheets.
Follow the bouncing Sonic and sing along! Also on SegaNet,
more stuff about CASTLEVANIA for the DC. Could it be true?
Well, SegaNet thinks so...

   Dreamcaster says GOODBYE! ACK! What happened? Seems like
the guys just can't continue anymore. Ah, this has happened
before. I mean a site saying, "We can't continue," and then
some hosting service comes in and offers help. So,
Dreamcaster fans, don't fret too hard yet. Anyhoo, way at
the bottom of this story, they say GRAND THEFT AUTO is
comin' to DC!

   Interviewer: So, Mr. Sega. What would you like to say
to European videogaming shops that import Dreamcasts? Sega:
Ya BASTADS! We'll MURDERLIZE YA! Ahem. Sega tells Euro-im-
porters to stop selling Dreamcast. SegaX has the details.

   A tiny bit of POWERSTONE news from Magic Box. Looks like
you're gonna be able to download new VMS games from the
Internet. Now... this is for the JAPANESE version, remember.
Who knows what'll happen when it comes here. Anyhooo, full
details over on Magic Box.

   Heh. This is really a Neo Geo Pocket story. Gaming-Age
takes a look at the new KING OF FIGHTERS R-2 ... what type
of fighters will be in it and from which KoFs. And then,
smack dab in the middle, a little note about how all this
might play out with the Dreamcast. Er, you do remember that
the Neo Geo Pocket and DC software are compatible, eh?

   So, who's it gonna be to give Sega-heads their DC-
Internet in the UK? British Telecom? Or Cable Wireless?
FGNOnline has all the details on this gory fight. Also on
FGNOnline, news that FRAME GRIDE will make it's appearance
at the Tokyo Game Show in March. And speaking of the 
Tokyo Game Show, seems like ole Namco is gonna show up 
with three DC titles -- SOUL CALIBER, TIME CRISIS 2,
TEKKEN 3 -- under their arms.

   SegaX has a cool minute-long video clip from EVOLUTION.
And just when you thought there could be no more, they whap
you over the head with their full-on review of SENGOKU TURB.

   Buy Sega. Earn Points. Buy TV. At least Magic Box says
you can do this. Go see.


PlayStation (PSX)

   Finally! RE:Tokyo runs part 2 of the FINAL FANTASY 8
special. This time they take a look at lot of the different
processes in the game -- like the battle system. Oh, FF8,
BATTLE ME!

   IGNPSX spotted something in an obscure publication (well,
it's not all that obscure, but how many people you know read
EETimes) about the PSX 2. Well, it's kinda about the PSX2.
Seems ole Toshiba has developed a new MIPS processor tech-
nology. Could this be the horsepower behind the next 
PlayStation? Details on IGNPSX.

   GamesRepublic reports that a NEW KING OF FIGHTERS is in
development for PSX! Cool. This is a really nice preview,
by the way, for a title just-announced. Check it out.

   ALIENS VS. PREDATOR delayed?! REALLY?! Aye, says Digital-
Ages. Incidentally, GameSpot says this ain't no delay; 
rather, it's been NIXED! Which one could it be? Who knows?

   You know MONSTER FARM 2 is comin' soon. Now, go read 
about the HUGE marketing campaign that's gonna push it. 
Details on Nikkei.

   IGNPSX previews RC STUNT COPTER, while Videogames.com
previews ACE COMBAT 3: ELECTROSPHERE. And then, wrapping
up the previews, Game Informer takes a look at the upcoming
RESIDENT EVIL 2 Toy LINE! 

   Hey, do you want a PlayStation with an iMac-like
casing? Then go on over to National Console Support for
details. 


Multi-Format & Misc

   Hey, up in the Dreamcast section, I made note of the new
KING OF FIGHTERS R-2 coming to Neo Geo Pocket. If you're
NOT a Dreamcast fan, but you're a Neo Geo Pocket fan,
then it's ok to look at this -- it's a Neo Geo Pocket GAME!
And it's on Gaming-Age.


Site Announcement

   A quick thanks to Carlo of PSXMax. He pointed out to me
after the last issue that they had recently linked to a
pretty cool site in Japan. I checked it out and it IS 
cool. It's devoted to RIDGE RACER TYPE 4. And it's in 
ENGLISH! (Even if this newsletter isn't!)


Cherrioes, folks! (Rice Krispies, Cocoa Puffs, etc.)

       See a cool story? cool site? Send it to me!
