   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Oy. I is soooo tired. Under a few deadlines this weekend,
even considered shortening up O.O. tonight so I could get to
bed.

   But once I started pokin' around the sites, I got excited
at all the cool stuff out there. So here's a full-on version
of O.O. -- as there should be.

-----------

Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   Let's start off the Nintendo today. Dreamcast has had the
top spot for far too long. Harumph. N64 rules! ;)

   IGN64 has an interview with Eurocom about the new Duke
Nukem game, "Zero Hour." Lots o' pics, too. Jeez. The game
looks very nice -- almost too nice. Hmmmm...

   Nintendojo does something really cool. They go out to 
their newsstands around the UK, pick up every N64 magazine
and review them. WoW! I like UK videogame magazines. If
you do, then check this out.

   Bad news. Barely an outline exists for the new version
of Super Mario 64 2. So, it seems the new "Hey, that's-a
spicy-a meatball" game won't be comin' anytime soon. Check
out the full details at IGN64.

   And why will there be no Super Mario 64 2 soon? Because
Miyamoto spent all of his time on Zelda! Good thing, too.
Reports coming in -- you can get the full details at Game-
Online -- say this game may be saving the N64.

   Ah, the name "Romance of The Kingdom" sound sooo familiar
but I just can't remember where I heard it. :( Either here
are a ton o' pics on IGN64. Nintendojo has a preview of
"Twisted Edge Snowboarding," while 64 Source previews 
"Mystical Ninja: Goeman 2" and Gaming-Age takes an import-
look at "Samauri Showdown 64 II," which has just debuted in 
Japan.

   Hey, Rayman! Eat your -- uh -- Ray out. Yeah. "Tonic
Trouble" is comin' and IGN64 has the preview. ASCII's
"Airboardin' USA' get its guts previewed over on Nintendojo,
and it looks like an alternative to the DexDrive and 
GameShark is coming -- an all-in-one-unit, called the 
XPloder! Details IGN64

   And speaking of DexDrive, Gaming-Age reviews the device
for both N64 and PlayStation.

   Videogames.com reviews "Turok 2: Seeds of Evil!" And 
this is NOT that silly in-store demo. It's the real McCoy.
IGN64 takes a look at S.C.A.R.S. (Cars based on animals?
Huh?) 64 Sources reviews "Buck Bumble," while Gaming-Age
peppers their site with more "Zelda DX" for Color Gameboy
pics and info. Includes a Super-Nifty (tm) pic of the box!


PlayStation (PSX) 

   IGNPSX publishes their oft-run rumor column, Off the 
Record. Top developers with PSX2 Dev kits? The PocketStation
PDA PSX compatible? These questions and more answered! Well,
they're not _really_ answered; we're talkin' rumors here!

   You know, I just took a look at my list o' links here
and so many of them are from IGN! Jeez! I can't believe it.
Well, first, here's news that the PC RPG "DarkStone" may
head on over to PSX very soon. Will "ToeJam and Earl" come
anytime soon? Umm... no! IGNPSX previews "Rampage: Universal
Tour," Square's FIRST third-person shooter, "Ace Combat 3,"
ASCII's "Galerians" (which they say is another Resident Evil
-- yeah, riiiight. ;) and "D.I.R.T." And hey, they also
reviewed "Knockout Kings" and "Rollcage." (Ok, Rollcage is
more of a preview, but it's nicely sectioned. OH, and 
GameFan takes a look at it, too, but they're calling it
a REview!)

   Gaming-Age takes a look at the DexDrive for the PSX and
N64 and National Console Support puts up a really balanced,
objective review of the Jogcon Racing Controller and "Ridge
Race Type 4."


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   You know, just because I put the Dreamcast stuff at the
bottom in this ish doesn't mean there's less of it. :) In
fact, the news lines are a-blazin' with all kinds of news.

   But some of it is not good. Delays are startin' to come
in. Climax Landers will be delayed (details at Dreamcaster),
and rumors persist that Sonic will be delayed. Now, Sega of
Japan has pulled the plug on Sonic pre-orders. Uh oh. 
Detilas at GameFan.

   Sega Otaku has been hearing from frustrated gamers that
many Dreamcast consoles are simply dying 4 to 5 hours into
play. Completely kaputsky. Check out Sega Otaku for more
details. And finally, 64 Source (a Nintendo site, remem-
ber) questions whether Sega is really doing as well as it
claims.

   OH, but stop that weepin'! Here comes a new game called
"Expendable." Details over on Sega X. And more good news
from Sega X -- confirmation from Sega of Europe of avail-
ability and pricing for Dreamcast's romp across the older
continent. September. September. 

   How many times in a week will GameSpot have to update
their Dreamcast FAQ? Well, we're in Day 2 and here comes
the Dreamcast FAQ 1.1! Check out GameSpot for the latest.

   KDD Corporation and Sega will build their own little
piece of the Internet for Dreamcast users. Check out
Dreamcaster for details.

   Sega X takes a look at how the Dreamcast version of 
"POD 2" will differ from the current PC version. Also on 
Sega X, new info and pics on the upcoming "Psychic Force
2012." 

   GameFan has new "Aerodancers" pics, and this are really
good in-game pics. Not CGI models anymore. Also on GameFan,
new "Buggy Heat" pics. (I also gave you the link to the
developer's Web site.)

   Game-Online takes a review-ish look at "Pen Pen Tri-Ice-
Lon." The Console Domain lads detail the day they received
their own Dreamcast. And, finally, Sega Otaku publishes
pictures of a special edition of Dreamcast.


Multi-format

   Hey, who would win in a fight between "Zelda" and "Metal
Gear Solid?" Well, Videogamers.com tries to find out. And,
OtakuBoy-Finally, Gaming-Age publishes pics of the upcoming
"Samauri Showdown" for Neo Geo Pocket.


   This ultra un-inspired, done at 3 in the morning, issue
brought to you by NoDoz Caffeine Pills. Remember, NoDoz
keeps you awake, but does nothing for your creative center.

Cheers, folks.
