   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   [This is a brief version of OtakuBoy. Ole OtakuBoy has a
bit of an unknown lung problem. Oy, his poor videogames! He
canna hardly do anything in a day! But he drags his sore-
covered, bloody body over to the keyboard to make sure you
have a series of Must-Clicks, every once in awhile. As soon
as OtakuBoy recovers, he will resume a five-day-a-week pub-
lising schedule. He! Will! Return!]

   Must Click P.C.! MUST CLICK P.C.! 
-----------

PlayStation (PSX) 

   MUST Click PSX! You gotta click on over to Gaming-Age
and their "Final Fantasy VIII" and "Final Fantasy: The 
Motion Picture!" Remember, though, there are some racy 
scenes in the movie. So, when you see it, bring your over-
coat and remember Paul Reubens. Anyway, after you've mopped
up the druel from reading that story, head on over to 
PSXMax, for an even-handed look at "The Unholy War." 


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   MUST Click Dreamcast! Well, it's not all Dreamcast. If
you remember the show Bonanza, then maybe you can under-
stand the in-joke over on Videogamers.com's Dreamcast
Bonanza. They show off pics of new games. Then, head on
over to Gaming-Age for a review of one of Saturn's coffin's
nails, "Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter." Oh, that
was unfair. I love all consoles equally.


Nintendo 64 (N64)

   I searched high and low for a good-un N64 thingy to 
tell you guys about. So, here it be: A Super-FAQ (tm) for
"F-Zero X." You're dyin' to read it; I know.


Multi-format

   Finally, one last link: The Magic Box Web site is awe-
some for small bits of news and rumor on every single 
console system. So, go there, tear off your clothes, and
bounce around in the text and pics.
