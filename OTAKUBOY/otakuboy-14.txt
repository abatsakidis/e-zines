   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

   Hey, let's start out with this bit about Otakuboy Online. 
We're now on ICQ! So, if You Seek Me, then I Seek You. Chat
me when ya wanna talk. I loves all my little subscriber-like
fellers. ICQ# 21176515
   Two big PSX releases cap news on many sites today. So, 
with that come reviews and all kinds of cool stuff. Oh I
love that low-level hum that comes from a PSX a-runnin'.

-----------
   And nothing says PSX-luvin' more than a mod chip to run
all those cool import titles. But what's this? Maybe you
don't need one anymore? This might put billions of base-
ment mod-chippers outta work! Details at PSXNation. Here's
something else that says PSX-luvin': a lizard with big
boobies. PSXNation also carries news of a playmate coming
(or is that cumming) to "GEX3." And, BOY-EEEEEEEE! 
PSXNation hits again with a list of upcoming titles from
Super Developer (tm) 989.
   Metal Gear Solid officially debutes tomorrow, and for 
the event, Gaming-Age interviews Dave Hodgeson. Who's he?
I don't know. Just some writer dude who wrote the new 
Metal Gear Solid Strategy Guide. Q: "Hey, Dave, why is 
your book so cool?" A: "Well, I can answer that, Gaming-Age.
I am cool. Ergo any book I write is cool." Meanwhile, 
PSXNation (there's that name again!) believes that with
Duke Nukem, it's Time To Cheat! Check out new codes at 
PSXNation.
   Could it be? Could it be that my heart has finally 
found a soul-mate in a decent boxing game for PSX? Well,
Gamecenter thinks so, as they preview "Knockout Kings."
Here's that preview of "X Games Pro Boarders" IGNPSX
promised so well yesterday. In the words of the previewer,
it's "the bomb." Lastly, in previews, can anyone find out
for me if there's mention of a "Vanna Nude Code" in IGNPSX's
preview of "Wheel of Fortune?" Send answers to Otakuboy!
   "Xenogears" debuts and Gaming-Age says that it could be
the BEST RPG of 1998? Well, there aren't that many months
left. IGNPSX also reviews the game, but I like Gaming-Age's
deeper dig into the game's philosophy. 
   Is "S.C.A.R.S." another title for Teenage Mutant Anthro-
pomorphic Automobiles? Ask GameCenter and their reviewer.
And if you're not interested in turning yourself into a 
car, then maybe you just wanna be a bad guy who kills 
humans? Yes! YES! That's for me, baby. (I've been rejected
one too many times!!!!!!) ;) Check out IGNPSX's review of
"Kagero: Deception 2."
   What's the deal with "The Fifth Element?" This movie is
so old and NOW we see a game for it? Jeez. Check out two
reviews at Hardcoregaming.com and Videogames.com.
   Sega X totally bombs the Web-waves with site updates 
last night and today. All kinds of new Dreamcast stuff! For
instance, they got three new totally cool movies from Tokyo
Game Show. And, believe me, these are new. NOTHING you've
seen before. They've got new Sonic, Sega Rally, and Godzilla
movies. Check 'em out.
   Sega X also carries some other cool stuff: First, they
ask: why ya gotta be so "Black and White" in yer thinking?
As they profile the new DC title so much like Populous. 
They also ask: is Dreamcast upgradable? (I'd like to comment
on this, but -- darn it -- I'd just spoil the story fer ya.)
And, finally, if that weren't enough, Sega X has a special
note for Japanese residents who want Dreamcast! It's started,
folks. Trust in Sega.
   Two other sites chime in with some news of note. FGNOnline
chases a problem with Dreamcast development kits and, what
could possibly be the last nail in the coffin for U.S.
Saturns, Game Assault reports on Toys R' Us' "last call." 
But if you don't like bad news, don't read it! Instead, 
read Videogames.com's new review of "Shining Force III - 
Part 3." Is it "the bomb?"
   What's this? A new "Pocket Monster Stadium?" Where's
the FIRST ONE?! 64 Source has the news. And speaking of 
64 Source, Desmond pours water on this whole "N64 ain't
sellin' well in Japan" malarky. Just go see what he says.
Those numbers are BALDERDASH, he tells ya! BALDERDASH!
   But cheer up, N64 troopers! The history of Nintendo is
full of highs and lows. No need to worry now! In fact, why
not catch up on the "History of Nintendo" at Nintendo 
Underground. They update their blockbuster feature with the
third and final installment. (But is it ever really final?)
Also on Nintendo Underground, find out what's gonna happen
to "Vigilante 8" when it comes over to the N64. The 
Underground guys interview Adrian Stephens of Luxoflux.
(It's a counter-top cleaner, too!)  
   You're Milo. You have a weird bowling alley. What
do you do? You get 64Source to preview "Milo Astro Lanes."
Oh, and if you like to hunt Dinosaurs! Well, then you're
"Turok 2" and you get a preview on IGN64. Or you're 
Cartman and you like Cheesy Poofs. Then you get yer mug
up on Videogames.com.
   Is it a SIM or a Racer? (Only it's hair-dresser knows
for SURE!) That's what IGN64 wants to know in its review
of "Nascar '99." Why not help them out with thoughts of 
your own? And, yeah, man! The Nth Dimension re-
views super bone-crusher "NFL Blitz!" 
   Finally, in Nintendo stuffs, Crave annoucnces how
they be supportin' the Color GameBoy-EEEE. It's on N64
Gamer!
   Look, Game-Online tells you what to buy in '99. There's
no need to look elsewhere. Don't even try. Just part your
butt on this site, read, then buy. 'nuff said, right?
Gamecenter reviews the "Naki Universal Steering Wheel" for
N64, PSX, and SAT. Watch out! You might run off the road
if you buy it. 
   Also, one final note. Doug Erickson has a frog. He calls
it "Arcade Port Myths." Watch as he dissects his frog. The
guts do glisten, so. Read his Gaming-Age opinion.
  OB Out.
