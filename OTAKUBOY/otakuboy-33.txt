   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

    ConsoleCity is three (click) three (click) three (click)
three sites in one! First, there's PSXMax, a premier PSXsite
with all things PlayStation. (You have to check out
Kingboxer's Rumor Mill!) Then there's The Nth Dimension, 
with their oft-scoops on cool movies. And, finally, there's
Dreamcast Insider, which sticks to Dreamcast like cooked
rice sticks to a bride and groom. 

   OtakuBoy's always heading there for the latest info.
Why not you?

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   It's one of those days when nothing really sticks out.
Lots of news. Lots of reviews. Lots of previews. Oh, of 
course there are important news bits here and there...

-----------

PlayStation (PSX) 

   For instance, here's a shocker from the government. It
turns out some PSX's are zappin' the be-jeesus out of some
gamers. (NO, Bobby, you didn't accidentally set your Dual
Shock too high.) See the details at IGN64. (Ha! Isn't
that funny? An N64 site reporting about zapping PSXs. Oh,
how fun.)

   PlayStation's sales are goin' gang busters... according
to Sony. Well, the figures do come from an independent 
source. GameFan gives a more objective look at the numbers,
but IGNPSX has a real meaty story, one that's not neces-
sarily PSX-pro. Of course, if you're a PSX Rabid Fan (tm),
just believe me when I say, "10 bazillion PSXs were sold
in the last few hours. Honest."

   In light of this news, however, comes weepy, sad news. 
Firstly, FGNOnline reports a story in the Japanese press
that claims the Japanese videogame industry is slowing
down. (Of course, this could have no affect on the U.S.
videogame industry, but why ruin a good downer story
with something hopeful?) Details at FGNOnline. Psygnosis
is having some reeeeeel troubles, much worse than reported
recently. IGNPSX has the pink-slipped details. And, if
that weren't enough, the PocketStation's Japan release
has been delayed one month. I have two links. One from
IGN PSX, another from Nikkei. Want the news right from
the country it affects? Go to Nikkei.

   I hoped you kinda glazed over that information, cause
there's lotsa good news to report, too. For instance, re-
member that damn "PaperBoy" arcade game with the handlebars?
Well, it's comin' to PSX! (It's comin' to N64, too, but we
won't mention that here.. oh wait, I just did.) Gaming-Age
reports that "Final Fantasy VI" (U.S. FF3) is comin' to
PlayStation with a few added surprises. Atlus Japan's RPG
"Thousand Arms" is comin' over to the states. Details at 
IGNPSX.

   In a quick bit o' import news, PSXNation reports that
"Capcom Generations: 1942" ain't comin' to the U.S. Is this
punishment for importing all those Marvel Vs. SF Saturn
games? ;) More details at PSXNation.

   IGNPSX has a reeeealy big preview of "G-Police 2." It
looks to be a lot better than the foist one. IGNPSX also
previews "Marvel Vs. X-Men." (Sorry, I don't get it. It 
looks so Genesis to me.) Oh, GameInformer says it knows what
form the sequel to "Mega Man Legends" will take.  

   Next-Generation DOT COM takes out their Japanese playin'
hands and reviews the import of "Ridge Racer Type 4." While
the review is good, I'd go for the movies. PSXMax reviews
the import "B.L.U.E. Legend of Water." (Good thing it's not
G.R.E.E.N. or B.R.O.W.N. water.) Also on PSXMax's import-
review hit parade, "Tobal 2." They call it, "the thinking-
man's fighter." 

   In "Jeopardy," when you answer a question incorrectly,
Alex pulls down his pants and wiggles his free-willy in
your face. That's a rumor. Is it true? Oh... um... ah...
no. At least the review over on IGNPSX doesn't mention it.
What's this? A _good_ puzzle game. Liars. That's all IGNPSX
could be in their review of "Roll Away."

   GameFan reviews "Tomb Raider 3." Why so late? I dunno.
But it's a nice lead in to another story that Lara's Third
Romp is awfully buggy. Details on that at IGNPSX. Also
at IGNPSX (did I mention they have a LOT of material today),
The review of "Kensei: Sacred Fist." And after you read it,
you might just call it "sucky fist."

   Console Domain takes a look at an odd bugger -- "Rosco
McQueen Firefighter Extreme." You are Dudley-do-right with
a penchant for fighting fires. Also, Hype.se reviews "Brave
Fencer Musashi," for those who want a review from the conti-
nent. 

Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   GameSpot spied a Yamauchi (Head o' Nintendo) interview
in the Japanese press. And -- WOW -- he's actually defending
the N64. Read the surprising twist of opinion at GameSpot.

   Videogames.com updates their "Castlevania 64" section
with new clips and a really large bit of information on the
game. Wow. Wow. Wow. Speaking of "wow," The Nth Dimension
publishes the "South Park 64" commercial, airin' on TV about
now. 

   "Turok 2" broke free today. Hear it roar? Roar. GameFan
has news of the release, Next-Generation.com reviews the
game, and IGN64 has a few comments from the Turok 2 project
leader about 64DD and the 4MB Expansion PAK. 

   Remember that damn "PaperBoy" arcade game with the
handlebars? Well, it's comin' to N64! (It's comin' to PSX,
too, but we won't mention that here.. oh wait, I feel like
I already wrote these words. Weird. ;) RareNet runs a fea-
ture called the Top Ten Reasons Perfect Dark is THE Game of
'99. Is it a Feature? Or a Joke? I classified it as both. 
I am clever. Here's a couple of news items about "Gauntlet
Legends," and you have to reallly examine your biases to
decide which story to read. Digital-Ages is pissed that
the game won't be in High-Res Mode. If you're apart of the
Committee to Promote Games in High-Res mode, then you want
to join the bitch session. If however, you want to read
something from a site that played the 10% completed game,
then you want IGN64. Choose wisely.

   Retailers in the UK have had enough. "Nintendo! You suck-
a-doodle-do for not sending enough Zeldas!" Details at
FGNOnline. Game-Online has a statement from a UK distributor
admitting their responsibility in the whole debacle. Mean-
while, way over in Japan, Famitsu reports the super sales 
numbers Zelda's reaching. Details on that at 64 Source. 
(They have it all in a nice chart, too. But some of the
numbers are NOT lining up properly. Watch out.) Gaming-Age
says that Miyamoto is into his next project --- but doesn't
know what it is. Perhaps he's gone for a high-calonic? Just
a thought. But of more importance at Gaming-Age, movies 
from the upcoming "Zelda DX."

   GameSpot has a smallish, but decent preview of "Mario
Golf 64." IGN64 asks, "Remember 'Snowboard Kids'?' Well,
here comes 'Snowboard Kids 2.'" IGN64 has the preview. 
Luke, I am your father. Oh, and IGN64 reviewed your game,
"Star Wars: Rogue Squadron."

   Over at GameSpot, Matthew Paul of Crave Entertainment
talks about the highs and lows of developing for the machine
we know and love, GameBoy Color. ASCII ships their "Super
LightBOY!" Details at FGNOnline. GameSpot runs news that
"Tokimemo" and "Beatmania" are coming to the little, color-
ized bugger.

   Really cool stuff on Euro-Asia GameBoy. First, they have
links to Pokemon and GameBoy Commercial AVIs. Download and
be merry, dammit. Also, a side-by-side comparison of the
U.S. and German "Harvest Moon" boxes. And lastly, a big
whopper of a review of "Robot Ponkottsu," a title that ain't
goin' anywhere but Japan. Sniff. :(

   Oh, in case you doubt the powerhouse that is Donkey
Kong, here's news from GameWEEK that the animated series
is, like, NUMBER ONE (?!) in daytime children's entertain-
ment or some such. Wow.


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   Sega Otaku has a neat little feature on their site that
compares prices for imported Dreamcasts from all the major
Web importers. 

   One of those importers is National Console Support, and
they have a really neat story about the history section on
the "Virtua Fighter 3: Team Battle" disc. On the disc, you
can find out all kinds of cool-io stuff about the develop-
ment of the entire Virtua Fighter series -- and National
Console Support details it all on their site. Also on NCS,
news that there are an awful lot of defective Dreamcasts.
Uh Oh.

   Sega Otaku spies an interview in an obscure Japanese
newspaper with one of the Sega-heads. They've translated it
fer you! GameSpot reports that "D2" has been bumped and
reveals details about "Real Sound." (Just what the heck
kinda game is this?) Details at GameSpot. After news that
Blue Stinger has been delayed, new news that the game will
a go PuriPuri (DC Rumble Pak) when it finally comes out. 
Also, Sega Otaku reports developer Seta is ready to do
Dreamcast. (Seta does Dreamcast. Sounds like a neat title
for a porno movie.)

   Woah! SegaX has a movie ripped outta "Virtua Fighter 3:
Team Battle!" It's a Gold vs. Dural clip. Download it.
Also a must-download, a "Powerstone" movie on IGNDreamcast.
"Bye-bye Street Fighter," they say. Really?

   In new game news, imagine running around in a game world
where four other characters, all AI-controlled, run around
the same world in real time, helping you out, but affecting
how/if you win the game. Imagine! Digital-Ages and Gamers
Republic reports on this new "Carrier." (Gamers Republic
runs a MUCH bigger story. Want short and sweet? D-A.) Gaming-
Age and Sega Otaku both take a very special look at "Maken
X." (Remember? This is the game that has Nazi's in it.) 
Read stories on both sites for a full preview.

   Dreamcaster runs a tiny story about the NEC Power VR2.
This is only important in that this PC card is more or less
an easy way to port games between Dreamcast and PC. 
Dreamcaster runs a link to Sharkyextreme.com which has pics
of popular PC titles running under the new card. 

   Did you know that the weird locomotive title "Densha De
Go!" will come with a pedometer? No, it doesn't measure
kiddies. It does a bunch of other things which Gamers 
Republic has detailed. Also on Gamers Republic, more info
on "Evolution" including three movies. Wooohoooooooooooooo!
Plus, check out the "Shen Mue" TV Ad! Gamers Republic, yet
again.

   And Dreamcast-finally, Sega Otaku reports that Yukawa
Hisekazu, a Sega d00d, is kinda weird, but famous. There's
more at Sega Otaku.


Multi-format

   A new Square title? "Racing Lagoon?" Wow. Check out
Gaming-Age for the skimpy details. Also on Gaming-Age,
news about the "Final Fight Revenge" arcade trial. In
fact, d00dz, they get to play and.. well, it kinda sux. 

   IGNPSX goes gangbusters over "NBA Showtime," the NFL
Blitz of the NBA world. (They also wonder, whether it
will get ported to home machines.) Also, Solid Snake
has indeed been immortalized in action-figgy plastic and
rubber, and IGNPSX has pics!

Cheers, folks.

             See a cool story? Send it to me!
