        The best news from the best vid-gaming sites

   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Here's what I hate about surfing around...

   Slow freakin' Ad servers. I don't mind ads. Nope. In 
fact, all those nifty colors and stuff are kinda cool. But,
PLEASE, IGN, upgrade your over-taxed ad server. Jeez. It is
so annoying when their pages stop loading because it's hung
waiting for //adserver. to respond. Eventually, of course, 
it times out. But only eventually.

   That's not the only reason I'm late.

   The other reason is I've been meeting with several people
who are going to help make OtakuBoy bigger! REALLY BIG! No, I 
don't mean bigger newsletters in your mailbox. Actually,
it'll mean shorter newsletters in your mail box -- if you 
want. All kinds of things. Now I know why those durn game
companies never say anything. I'm afraid if I tell you some-
thing's going to happen and it doesn't, then I'm a buffoon! :(

Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   And speaking of things that may be happening, a few sites
are reporting this evening that there is a final date for
the U.S. launch of Dreamcast. Ummm... I don't buy it myself.
Actually, I know the guy at one of the sites -- Videogamers
-- and he feels pretty good about it. So, does Sega-Otaku.
9/9/99. But could it be? Could it? I'm skeptible. And
skeptical. Oh, could this be the answer to my Dream(cast)s.

   HOLY FRAAAAK! 500,000 Dreamcasts shipped? Could this be
shades o' PlayStation success? (Remember, though, this is
DCs SHIPPED, not sold. Big 'um difference.) Anyway, check
out the latest number crunching at ConsoleDomain. 

   And just when you thought it was safe to believe your
console wouldn't try to turn itself into a PC, Sega-Otaku
uncovers some news that a Dreamcast hard drive and printer
are on the way. Save your scores! Surf the net! Print out
pictures of Sonic in compromising positions with Crash 
Bandicoot. (You know I'm de best, blue boy! What's my
name?! WHAT'S MY NAME!!!!!!!!!!!!)

   SegaX uncovers lotsa good stuff tonight! Check out pics
of the "Undercover" and "D2" magazine ads. Ah, they're 
kinda silly to me. (Hey, I was an art director for a game
company!) Anyway, SegaX ALSO has "Sengoku Turb" movies!
Honest and for TRUE! You might just download in your pants.
(Thanks to Comedy Central.)

   Next-Generation Online has an update on the development
of PowerStone. Mostly stuff about howzit goin'. Nothing 
much about the game itself. If you want that, they you 
gotta head over to Katana-Edge. These guys think they've
figured out how the VMS will work in the game. They even
have PICS of the VMS game!!!!!! Viva la Katana-Edge!

   Ahem. Here's something that might never make it to DC.
So, sez a lot of sites, including FGNOnline. It's "Ferrari."
Word has it that it's going to use FOUR Naomi arcade boards
YOIKS-A-DOODLE-DOOOOO! They can't stuff all those in no 
Dreamcast! Also on FGNOnline-boyEEEE, Sega explains why 
"Sega Rally 2" has slipped. (Little bit o' modem problems.)

   Hey, computer-monitor-owning-d00d! Remember last week I
sent you a pic of the VGA box for Dreamcast? Wellll, Sega-
Otaku has a bit more about the device -- how it works and
stuff. I've also got the picture link in case you want to
see it again. (It's stunning. It's like Cindy Crawford,
Winona Ryder, and Gillian Anderson all stuffed into a case
of plastic.) 

   Back over on SegaX, the guys says the CEO of Video System
tells 'em that he LIKES Dreamcast and he's going to develop
for it by hook or by crook! (Yes, he really said that! 
HONEST!) Check out the word at Sega X. 

   Lotsa Dreamcast Midway news for ya. First, Game-Online
has to some pretty good pics of "Hydro Thunder." It's a boat
game, to simplify it. Also, you wanna check out the GameSpot
story about Midway's DC schedule. LOTSA new games coming
out, including a Mortal Kombat! Yoinks!

   The "Shining Force" Premium Disc is gonna have lots of 
cool stuff on it -- full renders of the major Shining Force
characters, a tiny game of sorts, commercials, and MORE MORE
MORE! Check out National Console Support for the info on
this disc.

   Yeah, yeah. Koei's been saying they're gonna KILL
Resident Evil! Suure. And this game on Dreamcaster is 
supposed to do it? Really? Story also has news of other
Koei titles in development. (Short, short story, though.)


PlayStation (PSX) 

   OY VEH! A super, super interview with 3DO's Kudo Tsunoda
about "Uprising X." Worth the click! Must CLICK PC! OY! OY!
(These guys really get good interviews. Watch out for them!)

   DO-TELLS: "Diablo 2" on the PSX? Do tell, PSX Nation.
"Ehrgeiz" is coming? Do tell, Gaming-Age. The new Parappa
is called "UM Jammer LAMMY," Laddie? Do tell, IGNPSX. AND
"Vigilante 8 Second Offense" is coming?! Do tell, PSXNation.
Do tell! DO TELL!

   Hey, word is that "Final Fantasy VIII" is gonna have some
serious security on it. This means, fellow importers, that 
you can't run it on your US Playstations! NO! Well, hold
yer horses. National Console Support reports.

   In other big release news, MORE about "WipeOut 3." When's
it comin' out? What's it gonna do? What's it gonna have?
Inquiring minds want to know. And PSXMax and Hype.se both
have the news. (More quick specifics at HYPE!)

   MIDWAY RELASES! Boy, they're really hittin' the CD-ROM
burners these days aren't they? Anyway, check out the Game-
Online and Gamespot for the list o' games comin' out.
GameSpot got a more exclusive preview, so they gots more
details. What? You want titles? Ok, how about "Mortal
Kombat: Special For-es?" Not enough? Try cool retro-
titles, "Toobin'," and "720."

   Magic Box has news that "Mystic Ark Marboroshi Gekji" 
will hit the PSX soon from Enix. To be honest, I don't know
a durn thing about, but the Magic Box d00d says it's like a
really famous RPG!

   Now, THIS is famous! Videogames.com previews "ALIEN
RESURRECTION." (Huh? Why so late? No, not Videogames.com!
I'm talking about developer Argonaut!) Didn't this movie
come out the same year as Casablanca? (Here's looking at
your alien-incubating face, kid.)

   Hold on to your review-readin' hats! GameFan is goin' on
a "Syphon World" WHIRRRRL! They say it's a perfect blend of
GoldenEye and Mission: Impossible? How can that be possible?
Anyway, ConsoleDomain takes a look at "Roll Away" and asks,
could it be better than Spice World? Why ask that? Same
developer, kiddies.


Nintendo 64 (N64)

   Oh Ho HO! It's a rare, big Rare extravaganza. It's a 
little history, a little philosophy, a little "Oh, Rare, I
want to have your children. Please ravage me! OH, RARE!" 
But only just a little. It's on Nintendo Underground.

   YOIKS! "Mortal Kombat" is comin' to N64! Youch! And, just
like a previous MK, this one ain't gonna be no straight
fighter. IGN's got a pretty good preview, I must say. But
Midway stopped by GameSpot because -- Well, because if you
are GameSpot, people stop by and give you exclusives. You
just rule.

   Ah, but IGN64 has COOL movies of "Smash Brothers." 
SA-MASH Brothers. This looks really cool. Link fightin'
Samus. Ha HA! Link, you die a slow, painful death. Tri-force
or not. Anyway, movies on IGN64. And it's also got a cool
list of characters, levels and everything. It's a real
preview, Osh-Kosh B'Gosh.

   Tired of playing WCW, WWF, NWO, ETC? Well, here's where
yer next wrestlin' fix'll come from. So says, Gaming-Age.
It's "Toukon Road 2." G-A's got lots of pics and stuff.

   YAY! "Superman" is finally gonna land! YAY! I can't wait.
It's comin' real soon, according to GameFan. (Check out the
cool joke about Supes flying more like a seagull. Oh wait,
that's not funny.)

   NEW! From the makers of Puyo Puyo, comes a game with a
mystery more mysterious than its name, "Mystery Dungeon."
Check out the mystifying details on 64 Source.

   Do the Mario! Swing your arms, from side-to-side. Let's
do the Mario. C'mon everybody! Er. Hmm... Sorry. Anyhoo,
IGN64 profiles -- in two parts -- all there is to know about
"Mario Party." Wow! 64 MINI-Games! 

   WOOHOOOO! It's "Gauntlet Legeds!" It's a preview! It's
PICS! It's IGN64. It's BAD GRAMMAR! Ahem. IGN64 also pre-
views "Micro Machines 64 Turbo." (Durn. It looks pretty 
cool, somehow. It's strangely alllllurrring.) Then, IGN64
previews "Mystical Ninja Goemon 2," AND reviews "Star
Soldier: Vanishing Earth." Viva la IGN64!

   Oh, and 64Source just updated they super-mongous release
list.


GameBoy Color (GBC)

   WOW! "Super Mario Bros." really looks the same on GameBoy
Color as it did on the NES! Wow! Don't believe me? Check 
out ConsoleDomain, who says that Nintendo says that some
developer says that some little birdie told them it's comin
to the Color-Portable.

   And more new GameBoy releases. This news come from uber-
site GameBoy Euro-Asia. I've also included the direct links
to Nintendo's site, which has info on each game. Also from
GameBoy Euro-Asia, news that "Pokemon Gold" and "Pokemon
Silver" have been delayed. D'OH! But don't fret, cause The
Big 'N' is holding a contest! You could win all of the
plush, super-soft Pokemon beanies that Kentucky Fried 
Chicken had been selling for awhile. Details on Nintendo's
site.

   And here's news about MORE titles comin' soon. Jeez. 
GameFan reports that "Monopoly," "Centipede," "Breakout,"
"Frogger," and "Battleship" are ALLL comin from Take Two
Interactive! Wow. Full details on GameFan.


Multi-Format & Misc

   Y'know, usually I don't carry any emulator news. So, may-
be this is more like a Public Service Announcement. Right?
Well, anyhoo, PlayStationFan has an anonymous report that
the IDSA may put up a Web site to capture emulator and rom
downloaders. Could it be true? YOU DECIDE! (Art Bell?!)

   WOAH! Lotsa portable news today. Foist, the WonderSwan
release news on GameFan -- prices, release titles, etc. 
Then, over on GamersRepublic, a NeoGeo Pocket release date.
(Also a cool pic of one hooked up to a Dreamcast!) And
then, on Gaming-Age, news about the CONFIRMED NGP titles!

   And lastly -- get this -- ole Bandai's starting their
own online network with all kinds of card games and stuff.
Hehehehehe. Hohohohohoho. Well, maybe they can pull it off.
It's called "Lalabit!" Details on Gamers Republic and
(from the horse's mouth's country-of-origin) Nikkei! 

Tatabit for now.

   Oh, WAIT! One last thing. Mr. Maktos, of Maktos Trans-
lations, has moved. Don't know him? This guy is cool, man,
cool. He goes into Japanese newsgroups and translates
messages. They're all up on his now moved Web site. 

       See a cool story? cool site? Send it to me!
