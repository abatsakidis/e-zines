   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================
   Hey! I'm trying out some new layout options today. Like
it? Don't? E-mail me at otakuboy@bigfoot.com. 

   More super, super stuff from NintenDojo today. I can
hardly keep myself from soiling... um, never mind. In fact,
I had my mind made up that I would start today's issue with
PSX stuff...
   
-----------

Nintendo 64 (N64)

   But I can't! I can't; I tell ya. N64 stuff is just too 
damned exciting! Must. Report. First. Can't. Help. It.

   NintenDojo interviews super cool translator, Dan Owsen.
He's the guy making Zelda speak English. Check out the long,
well-worth-reading interview at NintenDoJo. It's pretty
spoiler-proof, so don't worry. But IGN64 also updates their
minor-spoiler laden Hyrule Times. This one's gots spoilins,
so you gotta watch out. What kinda spoilins? Well, how 
about little tidbits on how to play the game? Spoily enough?

   IGN64 drops names today. Konami. Konami. Konami. Alright
already, so they dropped by yer offices and showed you all
kinds of cool stuff. Look, it's not a good visit until they
bring girls with large boobies, ok? Enough! Anyway, IGN64,
who's just so great cuz Konami dropped by... Did I mention 
that Konami dropped by IGN64? Yeah, they did. With previews
of "Castlevania64," "Hybrid Heaven" (a new SF RPG), "Blades
of Steel" (Hockey. No relation to Buns of Steel), and 
"Mystical Ninja." And this is all brought to you because
Konami stopped by IGN64.

   64 Source is 64-errific (boy, that sucks) with new pics
from "Ogre Battle 3," Hudson's "Robot Ponkotsu," "Getter
Love," and "64 Wars!" Meanwhile, 64 Source updates their 
Super Cool (tm) RPG FAQ. You can find out info on a lot of
the games whose pics 64 Source is previewin' today. 

   You didn't hear this from me, but N64Gamer has a very
lewd picture of Superman on their site. I didn't know such
things could be drawn on today's game boxes. Oh my, SuperMan
stripping. Check it out there. Meanwhile, if you like 
basketball and you like NBA In The Zone and you like N64, then
you are the RIGHT TARGET for Viper's review of "NBA In The
Zone." Of course, he thinks it should be "NBA In The Blur,"
but he digresses.


PlayStation (PSX) 

   Famitsu, that wild-and-crazy Japanese magazine, tops
the news at IGNPSX. Why? Because while everyone else wallows
over N64's supposedly paltry Japanese sales , PSX is ridin'
high dudes! And not only that, but since Sony dropped the
PSX price to $129, people have been buyin' like it's crack!
(Well, it is in a way.) GameFan's got that story.

   Konami announces their 1999 line up at IGNPSX. (Apparent-
ly, they'll stop by there, too.) Guess what? "Fisherman's
Bait" is only the list! Cool. I am sooooooooooo happy.
Meanwhile, PSXNation hits with some interesting news
tiems. First, Sony has a "spooky Halloween treat" for you.
OOooOOOooh. Scary. Also, what's this? "Rally Cross 2" will
not be multi-tappable? Say it ain't so, PSXNation! "Bust-
A-Groove" lives, according to FGNOnline.

   They always say in the news biz that reportin' uncom-
firmed stuff always gets the reporter in the end. Well, 
Digital-Ages reports of a serious delay with "X-Men 3D
Fighter," from Activision. But FGNOnline says that, maybe,
the rumor is not all it's cracked up to be. Who's right?
Only Activision's hair-dresser knows for sure!

   Remember yesterday when I talked about a way to play 
imports without mod chips? Well, here's another story, this
time from PSXMax. And, according to them, all you need is
a certain product and a hunka-hunka metal. And speaking of
hunks of metal, news of "Solider" and Southpeak sit on
GameWEEK waitin' for you to come-a get it. Meanwhile, ole
Richard Roundtree -- I'm talkin' 'bout Shaft -- will
make his vocal debut in a new version of "Akuji: The
Heartless." Details at Digital-Ages. Meanwhile, Gaming-Age
has a new movie of "Chocobo Racing!" Woo hooooo!

   Have you ever wondered just how PocketStation's gonna
work with a game? Well, wonder no more, fellers. Check out
Magic Box and their news about "Aquarium." GamePro has a
Super Preview (tm) of "Omikron." What could it be? Check
it out. Well, there's no one here who can't get what the
IGNPSX preview of "Jeopardy" is about.

   Metal Gear Solid launched today. Of course, you knew 
that. Well, IGNPSX reviews it and, I think, it's one of the
better reviews out there. Digital-Ages fools around with
"Tenchu: Stealth Assassins." This one looks so cool, I'm 
ready to stealth on outta here and get one. Console Domain
reviews "Colin McRae Rally." GameFan says that "NHL '99" is
"gravy." (What kind? Low-fat? Chunky-style?) Hardcoregaming
says you might wanna run away from "Test Drive 5" and you
might want keep your dollars away from "Activision 
Classics." KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   Ok, here's some bad news: Apparently there's like an 
issue or something with a chip or some other inside the
Dreamcast that Sega can't, like, get quick enough. So, there
may not be as many DCs available at Japanese launch. Check
out Gaming-Age for the info.

   But screw that news! We want news of new games! Previews!
and REVIEWS!

   First, on Dreamcaster.net, you find out that "Galleon" 
is confirmed. Yippee! Hooray! Ha AH! But... ow... there's
a problem. Details there. Gaming-Age puts up a new MPEG
of "Puyo Puyo," and you gotta see it. And Digital-Ages
has some brand spankin' (OW!!!) new pics of "Virtua Fighter
3 Team Battle." 

   Can it be true? A couple of Saturn items of note? Gaming-
Age review "Capcom Generation 2." It's pretty cool... or so
it seems to this lay-reviewer. Also, on Digital-Ages, it 
looks like (SNIFF!!) "Biohazard II" will say 'bi-bi' to 
Saturn.


Multi-Platform & Miscellaneous

   Hey, SNK's gettin' a lot of press over this "Neo Geo
Pocket" thing. RE:Tokyo takes a look at it, fo' sure. But
while the system has barely born it's bosom to the world,
here's news from Game-Online of a "Neo Geo Pocket COLOR?!"

   Hey, I'm Otakuboy. And in the words of Dan Rather: 
BURRRRRRRRRRRP!
