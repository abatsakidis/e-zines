   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Ah, Tom Cruise. That rugged face. Those manly hands. 
Who'da ever think that out of those mighty lips (mighty lips
phrasing courtesy of Videogamers.com) would come a simple,
yet poignant phrase...

                        " I have the need...
                        the NEED FOR SPEED. "
-----------

PlayStation (PSX)

   Yes, folksies. NEED FOR SPEED 4 has been announced. So
says GameSpot, whose got a super big preview. And check 
this cool bit out: This time, you get to be the cop. YOINKS!
And a high-stakes mode where you can lose your car. "Hey,
Kinicke! We're racin' for PINKS!" Check out GameSpot.

   YOW!!! Check out all these new FINAL FANTASY VIII shots 
on RPGamer. This news comes from Super-Reader TANSU, who
says I need to have more RPG content in here. And so it 
will be done, Mr. Tansu! It WILL BE DONE! 

   Gamespot asks: "So, Sony. Why sue Connectix, huh huh?"
Sony say: "Look you slobbering punk! We don't like emula-
tors! And get that finger our of your ear. You don't know 
where that finger's been!!" No, seriously, GaneSpot's got
an impromptu interview with a Sony lawyer and Connectix over
this whole Macintosh emulation thing. Plus, another news
bit -- a PC version is in the woiks. (with apologies to 
Bugs Bunny)

   And speaking of things in the woiks, IGNPSX reports that
a different kinda DexDrive is comin' soon. It's called the
Data Deck and it's gonna have its OWN format AND read Dex
Drive stuff! HOOFAH! Details a IGNPSX!

   Hey! Darien, super duper Usenet contributor (Find him in
a Usenet Flame-Fest near you!) buttonholed me in ICQ the 
other night to tell me that SYPHON FILTER was the coolest
game he's ever seen... much better than Metal Gear Solid,
Metal Gear Transparant ... EVEN METAL GEAR OPAQUE! So, I
went about the Web to search for something... and found a
preview on GameCenter. It's decent. Good description of the
game. But it's from a press event. So, a lot of the quotes
are the typical, "Syphon Filter is ready to take on the 
world!!!" (By the way, for all your doubting-thomasses out
there, Darien works for Software, Etc. and was able to take
home the just un-wrapped in-store demo disc.)

   Next-Generation Online has a big preview of LEGACY OF 
KAIN: SOUL REAVER. What a cool story line. Wings, vats of
poison, different planes of existance. It's just like a 
visit to my cousin's house! 

   IGNPSX profiles JADE COCOON: THE STORY OF TAMAMAYU. And
get this: They think it just might be a Final Fantasy
killer. hehehehehehHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA  HOHOHOHOHOHO HAHAH
MWAHAHAHAHA! Er... excuse me. Anyway, the whole thing about
trapping animals and using their powers is pretty ... um ...
well, I guess unoriginal about now. (Pokemon.) Still it 
does sound interesting. So, check out the preview. 

   Hey, here's another one from Tansu. (You see, Mr. Tansu
loves RPGs. He wasn't so sure for awhile. And what, pray
tell, changed his mind? Final Fantasy VII!) Anyhoo, Tansu
says you should check out the LEGEND OF LAGAIA import re-
view. 

   PSX-finally. Oh, Capcom. You are so lovely. Especially
when you give away FREE GAMES!!!!!!!! Check out PlayStation
Fan for news of a Buy-Two-Get-One-Free promotion starting
up.

Nintendo 64 (N64)

   Speaking of mighty lips, whose lips could be mightier 
than Shigeru Miyamoto's about now. When he talks, people
listen. This is why, I suppose, IGN64 is running an lip-
flappin' interview with the man himself. (Interestingly,
Game Interviews.com says they've seen some of these answers
before. So all may not be new here.)

   Could it be? CARMAGEDDON comin' for the N64! YES! YES!
YYYYYYYESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS! This of 
the 64-bit carnage! Details on GameSpot. And speaking of
64-bit carnage, check out the super new pictures of DUKE
NUKEM: ZERO HOUR on Nintendo Underground.

   Uh oh. As soon as someone breaks through all the crap
out there and makes an emulator that works, IGN64 has to
ruin the whole idea by giving it press. *sigh* The developer
has back-tracked away from it... read the details on IGN64.

   Is QUEST2 comin' out after all? Well, apparently someone
spread rumors during the week that it might not. FGNOnline 
says that ain't so. And so does the company that's makin'
it! Cool.

   Back on IGN64: I don't see this as good news for Contra
OR Metal Gear. You see, Konami shelved the N64 Contra pro-
ject recently. Bad news. But then IGN64 asks: "How about 
some Metal Gear." And Konami says, 'Well, we're concerned
about sagging N64 Japanese sales.' From this IGN64 gets the
idea that Metal Gear Solid is comin' out for the N64. Well,
er... I'm not so sure that this is true. So, please read it
and tell me I'm wrong!!

   Last week I spied a story that WCW/nWo REVENGE would get
a major face lift when it hit Japan. Rememeber? Well, bully
for 64 Source, he breaks down every single little, itty, 
bitty, tiny, miniscule, minute, eeking, bit o' detail out
it. The ENTIRE roster of wrestlers, too!

   Gaming-Age has a TINY preview of the multiplayer arena
for VIGILANTE 8. And they're quick to point out how much 
this looks like a Miyamoto world. His mighty lips have
flapped a wind so strong it affects Activision. Also on
the preview run, GameCenter takes a look at PENNY RACERS.
Just like the SYPHON FILTER preview up above, this one's
got lotsa press release sounding quotes.

   And N64-finally, another review of Castlevania 64! S00per
D00per!


GameBoy Color (GBC)

   GameBoy rumble. GameBoy shock. GameBoy feel good. But 
the first rumblin', shockin', feel-goodin' GameBoy game to
hit the U.S. won't be POKEMON PINBALL. Nope. That honor goes
to Japan. U.S.? We're gonna get TOP GEAR. Check out GameBoy
Euro-Asia for the details.

   Over on Gamers Republic? A super preview of TOKIMEKI 
MEMORIAL, that super dating game comin' out soon. "Shall we
dance?" "No you fat #%$!" Game over.


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   You're shinin' star. No matter who ya are. But if you're
9/9/99 you might not be shinin' for long. So says FGNOnline
who hears that Sega is backin' away from the 9/9/99 U.S.
Dreamcast date that the Web's been all a-titter about 
recently. To boo hoo? Or not to boo hoo? That is the ques-
tion FGNOnline wants to answer.

   Peter Oliver, super editor at Console Domain, sent late
word today that they uploaded their own SEGA RALLY 2 review.
I just read it, and I fear for Peter's sanity. How can some-
one fall so in love with a game? It's just unnatural! It
says right in some holy book somewhere that man must not
lay with game! And yet Peter just SHIRKS it all. Check out
his review.

   On the heels (and the shins and the ankles) of the recent
SEGA RALLY 2 reviews, Dimension-S and Seganet get some SUPER
SR2 movies! Woweee-wow-wow! But, watch out! They can be a 
might long. ADSL lines welcome! Vacancies! AAA discounts
accepted. (What the heck am I talkin' about?)

   Super SPEED racing! Yes, it's the next racer comin' to
Dreamcast like real soon now. (Fortunately, for us folks 
that remember Commodore, real soon now does not mean the
same thing.) Anyway, Gamers Republic and SegaX both have
good previews. So read 'em both. And Dreamcast-finally, 
take a ganderin' look at SUNRISE TOMATOES! ... Oh, sorry.
I mean SUNRISE HEROES! It's a TINY preview at Gaming-Age.
Think Gundam, mmmmm-k?


Multi-Format & Misc

   And, finally-finally, The Classic Gaming Expo is a-comin'
back! YES! It was a big hit last year with all kinds of old
programmers and games and stuff. So, this one is gonna be
cool. I think I'll forgo E3 for it.

NOT.

Cherrios, folks! (Rice Krispies, Cocoa Puffs, etc.)

       See a cool story? cool site? Send it to me!

              What are people saying about the
               Multiverser role playing game?

                "It was money well spent."
            --Breton Stron, Valkyrie Magazine 

      This is the game that makes good use of all the
             crap that you bought in the past.
