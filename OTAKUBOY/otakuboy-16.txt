   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Hey, I forgot ta mention last ish about a new sponsor 
here at OtakuBoy. It's Gaming Central! They're pretty cool,
dude, cool. You go there, right, and they've got this big
list o' links to all the best videogaming sites. And the 
only reason I know they're the "best videogaming sites" is
because readers vote for the best. So, the one at the top
of the list is the very best 'cause readers voted fer it!
Gaming Central's also got a cool list of newsletters -- 
featurin' your's truly. So, check'em out when you get a
chance.

   Slow news day, folkies. But lotsa cool Dreamcast stuff
to download and play til yer face turns blue. A little
of it BAD NEWS! What is this? International Downer Day?

-----------
Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   And what's bad news? Sega's already stopped Dreamcast
pre-orders! Details at FGN Online. Well, maybe that's good
news cause that means people _really_ want Dreamcast. Still,
this can only be bad news: Capcom cancels "Street Fighter
Zero 3" for Saturn. Bye, bye Saturn. Cancels comin' in 
almost daily now. WEEEEEEEEEEP!

   But maybe that's ok? Why would Sega want both Saturn and
Dreamcast out there. Sega never makes mistakes! Never!
Never! Right? Well, Dreamcaster.net runs a nice examination
of Dreamcast's real competition. It's long, though, so 
watch out. Also at Dreamcast, news about confirmation on
"Evenstar!" I am creaming at the thought... ;)

   Hey, man, Sega X kicks ass again! New movies of "Virtua
Fighter 3 Team Battle," "Climax Landers," and "Evolution."
Collect the entire set! Then, head on over to to 
Videogames.com to see new pics from CRI's "Buggy Heat." 
Apparently, this is a game about cars going into heat. Like
cats, they purr alot and stick their asses in the air.
Honest and fer TRUE! ;)
   

Nintendo 64 (N64)

   Just how close is this whole console race thing, really.
IGN64 tries a new spin on some old numbers. Ho hum. But
if you're a N64 fan, and you like numbers, then their
new analysis is for you! 

   Heh. Now this is interesting. A strategy guide for an
in-store demo. Yeah, that's sure to make the Toys B We
employees happy. Nevertheless, if you're dying to be the
first on your block to beat the in-store "Turok 2" demo,
then head on over to Turok.com. Nintendojo runs part two
of their interview with the translator type d00d that
works on Zelda. Link's privates revealed! You'll get a
rise outta this, boyeeeeee.

   Nintendo Underground has an interesting preview. A couple
of .wavs of "Perfect Dark." I didn't hear them folks, but
some people say the sound's none too good. But, sure, you're
dying to hear it! A Super Preview (tm) of SuperMan over on
IGN64. Long description of what to expect in the game, plus
movies and pics. Wowee wow wow! IGN64 also has news of a
new Tetris that reacts to you! 64 Source has some initial
impressions of Color GameBoy. Some cat over in Hong Kong
got his paws on one. Meow. And scroll down a bit on this
page at 64 Source to see new pics of "Mario Party."

   Hey, everyone's been all a-titter ('a-titter' copyright
OtakuBoy Online 1998, all rights preserved) over "Body
Harvest," so IGN64 tells you to get over it and just
decide whether you want to buy the puppy or not. Read their
review. Also, enter the "crystal kingdom" over at Gamecenter
and their review of "Glover," the story of the white glove
than ran away from Michael Jackson's home.


PlayStation (PSX) 

   "THERE IS NO HONOR IN A DELAY," said the Klingon game
developer to the gaming press-dude. "AND YET, I FEAR WE
MUST!" IGNPSX has news of when/where/why "Star Trek:
Klingon Academy." Meanwhile, Capcom got a wee bit pissed
at all the Web reports about "Resident Evil" and Dreamcast.
Hey, trust me! It's a PSX story after all. Check out 
PSXMax for details. And Bust-A-Move comes to the U.S.?
Gaming-Age has the scoop.

   Woah, a whole set of new "Street Fighter Alpha 3" pics!
Cool! Cool! I wanna see movies, though. At least animated
.gifs. C'mon guys. Anyway, new pics at Videogames.com. And
if you're ready to run out your house and scream "Densha
De GO!" (This game apparently has something to do with
steam-engines.) Then you're gonna wanna check out Magic Box
for their preview. IGNPSX runs a gangbuster preview of 
"Shogun Assassins," which is about feudal Japan. Feudal
Japan, for those of you who don't know, has to do with kids
who've waited in line ALL DAY to order a Dreamcast only to
find out Sega pulled the pre-order plug! Those Japanese get
downright feudal when that happens. No, seriously, the game
looks really good. Check it out. More previews: Gaming-Age
has a bit more information on the next WWF game. Ole Bubba
over at GameFan previews "Twisted Metal 3." And 
Videogames.com previews a Tiger Woods golfy-type game. 

   Whoops. Almost forget this one. Gamecenter reviews 
"G Darius." Ah, 16-bit lookin' shooters. I must be in 
heaven. 


Multi-Platform & Miscellaneous

   Who are all the characters in the upcoming "King of
Fighters" for Neo Geo Pocket? The world may never know. But
you will if you go to Digital-Ages. And speaking of Neo
Geo Pocket, Sega X has news of new games comin' out. Also,
FGNOnline speculates on a U.S. release date. Viva la gray-
scale portable game machines!

   Oh, and I don't normally carry stuff about coin-ops, but
gaming-age has a pretty cool preview of "Star Wars Trilogy,"
an upcomin' arcade game. Why might you wanna know about 
this? Well, it may appear on Dreamcast. You never, never 
know.

   See you Monday, kiddies.
