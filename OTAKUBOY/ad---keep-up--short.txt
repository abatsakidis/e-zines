Jeez! Who da hell can keep up with all the new reviews, news, features, etc., etc., etc., published several times a day to each of the sites?

OtakuBoy Online newsletter surfs over 40 console gaming sites every day for the latest news, reviews, previews, features, and all those lovely etceteras about the N64, Saturn, Dreamcast, PSX, and others, then publishes a convenient list o' links and narrative, pointing out the best-o'-the-best. THREE-DAYS-A-WEEK! YOINKS!

It's de-lightful. It's de-loverly. It's de-Otakuboy Online. And it's
de-free.
