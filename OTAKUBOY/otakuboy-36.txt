   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

    ConsoleCity is three (click) three (click) three (click)
three sites in one! First, there's PSXMax, a premier PSXsite
with all things PlayStation. (You have to check out
Kingboxer's Rumor Mill!) Then there's The Nth Dimension, 
with their oft-scoops on cool movies. And, finally, there's
Dreamcast Insider, which sticks to Dreamcast like cooked
rice sticks to a bride and groom. 

   OtakuBoy's always heading there for the latest info.
Why not you?

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Overheard on the fishing pier: "Hey. You play any of that
Link feller?" "Fersure, fersure. That fishin parts a mighty
realistic. I was waiting fer the tide to start pulling out
and the snappers to zoom by. he-yuk."

   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Thanks for the break, fellas!
OtakuBoy went on down to Grand Isle, Louisiana, tore into 
the little fishies and shrimpies with his OtakuTeeth and
scared the residents so bad, they jumped in their fishing
boats and shrimp trawlers and headed way into the Gulf of
Mexico. What I do? What I do?

-----------

Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   Well, well, well. What have we here? A big ShenMue con-
ference? Really? Certainly nothing came of it, right? Pro-
bably some big wigs sayin' how ShenMue is going to be the
best game ever -- move over Sonic, move over Zelda, move
over Busby. ShenMue's in town. Ho-hum. (Low-grade sarcasm.
An OtakuBoy Brand Weapon since 1893.) Well, if you want
to read/hear/see the latest check out coverage on Sega-
Otaku and SegaX! Both have huge packages available. (They
both have good packages, Otaku's weigh a teensy bit heavier
at 13 stories.) Finally, see the Sega of America press re-
lease over on Sega X.

   Weekly Famitsu, the Japanese Videogame magazine that many
a-U.S. videogame magazine editor gazes lustily at, (the
coverage so firm, the editorials so supple) published a 
bunch of Dreamcast game reviews -- "Sonic," "Tetris 4D,"
and "Seventh Cross." Here's a hint: Sonic's the only one
that got high-regards. Dreamcaster and Gaming-Age carry the
results. And in case you don't care what Famitsu says about
Seventh Cross, SegaX has some new pics.

   A bunch-a sites say: "We've gone VMS CRAAAAAZY! Hohoho!"
(VMS is that little PDA/Tamagotchi lookin' thingy in the
Dreamcast controller, for those not in-the-know.) First,
GamersRepublic reports on a "secret" VMS game buried deep
in "Sonic Adventure." National Console Supports talks about
the new "Mothra" VMS game and how it's gonna link into 
Sonic. Finally, SegaX reports how the "Climax Landers" will
use VMS.


Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   Let's start the carnage with new, specific details on 
"Castlevania 64." Belmont bits into Drac's ass one more
time. IGN64 has a big preview -- and a movie! Download
and be merry. Fa-la-la-la-laaaaa.

   Remember last week IGN64 said that all kinds-a people
were writin' in to say that their "Turok 2" was a crashin?
Well, it turns out there may not be any problems with Turok
2 after all. Yep. Seems like Acclaim can't get the game to
crash... But Wait This Expansion Pak's awful hot! An update]
at IGN64.

   Fan of Japanese Wrestling Games? Yeah. Who wouldn't be
right? Well, it looks like a new one's coming down the
pike. Say this title really fast: "New Japan Pro Wrestling
Fighting Spirit Flame Guide 2." (N.J.P.W.F.S.F.G. 2, for
short!) Now, go read about it at IGN 64.

   64 Source tries to find out if all the racism, all the
profanity, all the profundity that is "Ogre Battle 3." Will
make it to the states in tact. Follow 64 Source as they 
look for the real truth!

   GameBoy (Oh Jeez!) merged with Nintendojo over the week-
end. Yeah. Hurrah! So, over on Nintendojo today, news that
GameBoy Color is kickin' ass in sales. They getting plumb
hard to find! Details over at Nintendojo.

   (Speaking of Color GameBoy, OtakuBoy spied a working
demo over at WalMart. WOW! The color is so vibrant, so
crisp. I threw my N64 and PSX in the trash -- virgin
sacrafices to the GBC God!)


PlayStation (PSX) 

   Hark the Preview Angels Sing! Glory toooo VIDEOGAMES.COM!
For their super preview of "Final Fantasy VIII." Love them
a long, long time. 

   Two -- two, two -- sources confirm that "WipeOut 3" is
in the works! Details at IGNPSX. 

   Famitsu -- the pinnacle of Videogame mag, according to
the Videogames Magazines' Jaded Editors Union of America --
rates "Street Fighter Zero 3," "Chocobo Mysterious Dungeon
2" and "Suikoden 2." Check out the Japanese-numbers and
find out what they Japanese-mean at Gaming-Age (not
Japanese).

   Gosh! Is Rampage really all the great that we should be
hearing about ANOTHER sequel? Oh, please, tell me it ain't
so, GameFan. I said tell me it _ain't_ so!

   IGNPSX reports that the Galaga hoards -- from the old
videogame, remember? -- are comin' to the PlayStation in
a gamme called "Star Ixiom." Check out the News/Preview.
Also on IGN PSX, a News/Preview of "Saga Frontier 2" with
specific news about how the characters and storyline will
expand over several generations.

   Do you doubt that a full sim like "Civilization 2" could
really make it on a console? Even one as versatile as the
PSX? Welllll... Gaming-Age begs to differ in their preview.

   Become a Gorgonite. Kick Ass. Win. The three simple di-
rectives for "Small Soliders." GameCenter has a full-on
review! 4 X's! Man! FOUR!

Cheers, folks.

             See a cool story? Send it to me!
