   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

   IF YOU haven't tried out OtakuBOY.com, then you GOTTA!
It's more fun than a sack full of dead rats! 

   No, seriously. You will notice that this issue is quite
short. That's because the newsletter now lists only the most
important stuff three-days-a-week, while the Web site now
lists EVERYTHING as soon every day! WOW! It's like major 
cool with a big stick and stuff. 

   Huh?

-- G Police: Weapons of Justice - Preview

   SUPER COOL preview of G POLICE: WEAPONS OF JUSTICE on
Videogames.com. I especially like what Psygnosis has come
up with to take care of that pesky graphics pop-up problem
in the first G POLICE. Think wireframes, then renders.

   How would you like a fighter where the all the characters
seem to act about the same in every respect? Sound um...
well... positively boring. (Or good, depending on whether
you SUCK at fighters like me.) Well, IGNPSX looks at
DESTREGA and they're none too pleased.

-- HEEEY! My Main MAN! - Speech

   Er... I hope you can forgive the cheesy title. :( You
see, Peter Main of Nintendo spoke at the 1999 Toy Fair and,
well, he's the MAIN MAN! Sorry, that joke's gone nowhere.
Anyhoo, it's a really long speech that goes into the de-
tails of the industry. Read it all if you want, but IGN64
has posted next to the full interview, the news about the
new games contained in the speech near the top. Check it
OUTTTTTTTTT!
