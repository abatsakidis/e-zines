   Frequently, I get mail from people wanting to know
how to reach a certain level in a game or where to find
the latest info on a game. As if I'm a videogaming expert or
something... Ah, but I can find good content on the Web. So,
here it is!

Hi, I'm in the last boss in xenogears, Deus and his four
pals, and I don't know how to kill him the four enemies
before him are too strong, I'm in level 80 and I cannot
see a strategy to rip him off, could you help me?

And OTAKUBOY SAY:

Ah! Do you mean THIS Deus?

Boss Fight #74: Deus
Location: Deus
HP: With 0 Sub-Bosses destroyed, 75,000
         1-3 Sub-Bosses, 52,000
         4 Sub Bosses, 40,000
EXP: ???
Gold: 0
Treasures: None
Attacks: Starry Night, Halve HP, Ultimate Break, Cosmic Crush
Recommended Level: Anything above 75 is great.  The higher the
better!

Whew. Looks like a sonuva-bitch. Fortunately, LightRanma
has created a super Boss FAQ for problems such as these.

-- STAMATIS SEZ:

Now I need your help for the game GoldenEye in N64. Is there
any code or cheat that allows me to pass the levels without
playing them?


And OTAKUBOY SAY:

GoldenEye's cheats don't work like a lot of cheats do.
Cheats are unlocked as you play the game.

For instance:
Level 1 - Dam      Paintball Mode       Secret Agent    2:40

This means you have to be playing "Secret Agent" level and
reach this point in the game before can operate the "Paint-
ball Mode" cheat. (What that is, I'm not sure.)

Treyman355's Cheat FAQ should help you understand all you
have to do.

The GameShark allows you to do a lot more with cheats. Ah, 
but there's a catch: YOU HAVE TO HAVE A GAMESHARK! :) And
there's still no skip around the levels cheat.

-- DUDEK SEZ:
hey I have a question for you it is on the game cruse'n USA
is there any shorcuts or any thing like that? 


And OTAKUBOY SAY:

What do you mean by "shortcuts?" In Crusin' USA, a shortcut
could mean cuttin' through an IOWA cornfield to win the
game. If that's what you mean, then, no, there aren't any.
If, on the other hand, you mean a code -- then, no, there
aren't any. Most codes and cheats in C'USA allow you to
unlock new cars, start a race as a school bus, and more. 

But if you got a GameShark -- ho ho ho! -- you can get
unlimited time, which is darn near a shortcut, if I do say
so myself. But you do have to check to see whether you have
C'USA, C'USA v1.1, or C'USA v1.2.
