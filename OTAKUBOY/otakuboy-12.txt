   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Folks! I have found the eighth wonder of the world! Yes! 
And this eighth wonder is more important than consoles and
videogaming. It's called HEALTH! OtakuBoy nearly didn't make
it with today's issue of Otakuboy Online, what with his real
world visit to an E.R. yesterday. But fear not, faithful
readers! OtakuBoy is just as devoted as you are to video-
games. They will not take my dual-shock from my hands--
unless its over my rotting corpse! 
   
-----------

   And speaking of rotting corpses and dual-shocks, PSX,
once again, weighs in first with lots and lots of stuff
to see. (I'm not sure where rotting corpses fit in with
all this, but perhaps there'll be an opening somehwere.)
   AH! Here we go: rotting corpses are sure to be found 
once you read Videogames.com's "Metal Gear Solid" strategy
guide. They promise a "rundown of weapons," "gameplay
tactics," and more. Wowee wow wow! And FGN Online has an
account of how many Metal Gear Solid ads'll run during 
this holiday season.
   But maybe Metal Gear Solid's not exactly your speed.
(Can't imagine why!) Maybe you're into RPGs? Ok, Console
Domain runs a pretty good round-up on all the known-info
about "Final Fantasy VIII," the most anticipated event
since the O.J. Simpson criminal trial verdict.
   PSX Previews run pretty tiny today, though lotsa sites
run new shots of "Street Fighter Alpha 3." I suggest
IGNPSX's coverage. Videogames.com posts a set of shots for
"G Police: Weapons of Justice." 
   Console Domain runs their trademarked 2nd opinion on 
another title -- this one, "Moto Racer 2." Will it make
you want to sink a hog between your legs? (yuk) Find out
at Console Domain. PSXMax reviews "ThunderForce V," and
Digital-Ages asks you to come along and ride on the "Armored 
Core: Project Phantasma" voyage. Their review details the
works about the game. And IGNPSX runs a Super Review (TM)
of "Team Losi: RC Racer!"
   Oh, and maybe you're too young to remember this: Way
back in the early 70's, lotsa Star Trek fans wrote stories
under a theme (or genre?) called "Kirk & Spock." The point?
Kirk and Spock doin' it on the transporter pad. Well, it
wasn't long before ALL Fan-fiction had that dubious moniker
placed on it. That's what I remembered when I saw PSXMax's
Fan Fiction section. Not that there are any Kirk-and-Spock
type stories there, mind you. 
   Oh my God, Nintendo Underground interviews the developers
of "South Park." 'dem bastards! (Heheh.. check out the URL.
Nintendo Underground has moved servers.) The Nth Dimension
says it's got a brand-spakin' new Zelda64 movie. In
fact, they say it's so exclusive, they're worried about
breakin' servers. So, check The Nth Dimension for the la-
test ftp-locale. Meanwhile, Game-Online reports on
a 90% version the Zelda64 shown in Germany.
   Could it be a prediction for the real World Series? Two
sites mention the results of an "All Star Baseball '99"
tournament between the Yanks and the Padres. If you want
a quick news item, check out FGNOnline. More in-depth? Ya
gotta go to Game Assault.
   And wrapping up cool N64 content: Can you guess what
type of game runs under the title: "Legend of The River
King?" I betcha I can -- but I saw the preview over at
NintenDojo, so I have an unfair advantage.
   Couple of nifty Dreamcast notes today, from 
Dreamcaster.net and Sega's Japan web site. First, a game
that looks great but has a terribly uninspiring name --
"GET BASS" -- gets exposed on both sites. OH, and remember
last week when I said "I wish there were 'lover games.'?"
This was an attempt at a joke. Ahem. Anyway, here comes
a "dating game" for Dreamcast, "Pa ta Pies!" Details, again,
at Dreamcaster.net and Sega Japan's web site.
   Wow wee wowo wow! Games.Net has a super big story about
MDK2 for Dreamcast. Other sites carried this info, but
Games.Net knocks you over the head with all they know. 
   GameAssault tries to bring order to chaos. A task too
large? Welll, they're only bringing order to the increa-
singly chaotic world of title releases. On GameAssult, you
find a nifty table -- color coded, for your brain's con-
venience -- with all the latest release dates. Multi-
platform, too. Give GameAssault a round of applause. CLAP!
But if all your care about are wrestling games and their
release dates, then it's better to run on over to IGNPSX.
Don't let the site name fool you, this is a complete list
of every wrestling-game-to-come for every platform. And
speaking of "every platform," Game Center runs a preview
of a PC version of "NBA Live '99." Contrast and compare to
any future versions! Also, Digital-Ages runs a preview of
"C3: Grand Car Racing." This one's got some real car specs!
   And finally, two new commentaries grace the digital air-
waves. First, Console Domain asks, "What's missing from
Sports games?" Huh? HUH? What do you think? Then, 
Videogames.com supports EA's decision about "Thrill Kill?"
Say it ain't so.
   Say it ain't so. I gotta go. c ya l8r d00dz...
