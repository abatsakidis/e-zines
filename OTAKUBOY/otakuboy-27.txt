   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

   Hey-ya. The neat thing about the Web, folksies, is it's
all the way world-wide. You know what I'm sayin? This means
while we here in the U.S. are stuffing our faces with turkey
and tomato sauce and spaghetti (hey, I come from an Italian
family), every other country is workin! 

-----------

Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   Especially Japan. And even if they weren't, they'd head
out today because ... YES! ... It's "D-day," the day 
Dreamcast storms Japanese shores. 

  Game-Online publishes a Super Dreamcast Package -- seems
like the guys at the site got their hands on one through a
local retailer/importer. First, they explain everything
about the machine -- the boot sequence, the size, the launch
titles, then they give their impressions about each of the
games. Then they file a report about launch day in Japan
and include a nice pic of a game shop. Finally, they wrap
up the U.K. import scene, especially the extreme prices
a gamer will have to pay if they want Dreamcast. Also,
they have a brief note about a U.K. retailer that has/had
the consoles in-stock. 

   Sega X talks about what it was like in Japan on Dreamcast
Day. Dreamcaster.net reports on what D-Day did for Sega and
Hitachi stock. Sega X waxes Resident-Evil-hopeful by reprin-
ting an interview with Capcom about "Biohazard" and whether
the title will ever appear on Dreamcast. 

   GameSpot lights up the news with word that Konami will
bring two titles to Dreamcast -- "Flight Shooting" and
"Pop'N Music." Details, sketchy as they are, at the site.
Also at GameSpot, word a game which will use voice recog-
nition. Seems like you'll be able to teach a fish with a
human face. "Project Berkely" has an official name. I have
two links for you: One to the story on Dreamcaster.net and 
another to Sega Japan's web site where you can see the
titling graphics. 

   Speaking of Sega Japan, they launched a buncha-buncha
burnin' Web sites today to correspond with the launch. I've
included links to sites that use some English on them and
one of the pages links to everywhere else on the site. I
especially recommend the What's New page.


PlayStation (PSX) 

   Not to be outdone by that mean ole Dreamcast, there are
quite a few PSX things to see, links to click.

   IGNPSX takes a lookin at games that shouldn't exist, 
complete with PlayStation boxes are doctored up. Marketing
speak: The graphics are first rate and the text is both
delightful and deloverly. This feature is a laugh-riot
comedy that's sure to delight for generations to come. Feh.
Anyway, check it out.

   King "of rumors" Boxer slaps some more rumors on PSXMax.
Stuff like... PSX down to $109? A new Metal Gear Solid?
Details at PSXMax.

   When you head over to Digital-Ages and GameSpot to check
out Square's new "trippy" shooter, remember to NOT eat the
brown acid. (I'm warning you.) Seriously, this is a new
shooter that looks a might weird. Digital-Ages has facts
and analysis, but GameSpot's got pics!

   GameFan says the bitch is back in its preview of "Ridge
Racer Type 4." (The author goes on about some woman from
previous titles returning in this installment.) 
Videogames.com reviews "Abe's Exoddus" and says that if 
you hated the first Abe, you might want to check out this
new one. ConsoleDomain checks out the Euro version of
Capcom's "Pocket Fighter," a 2D fighter. What? 2D? Ah, 
don't let that dissaude you from this title. Check out the
interesting gameplay that involves special moves, colored
bars -- an gems?

   When you're player misses a damn easy shot in "NBA Live
'99," they don't like it. How do I know? Because ConsoleCity
says in their review that you can see it on their faces.
GameFan reviews the little "Tiny Tank" that could, "Tales
of Destiny," and "Rally Cross 2." (Here's their warning
about Rally Cross 2: You think the first one was difficult?
You ain't seen nothin.)


Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   Nintendo sites slept today... zzzzzzzzzzzz. Very little
to report. 

   Videogames.com runs a very nice feature called, "The
Legend of Miyamoto." (He done Zelda, for those of you that
don't know.) Speaking of Zelda, are you already tired of
the fact that there just don't seem to be enough carts to
go around? There _is_ a problem. See the proposed solution
at Nintendo's Web site.

   GameFan takes a look at "South Park. A real review, man!
In what other game could you use urine-soaked snowballs to
fend off enemies?

   Videogames.com previews "Penny Racers," which is.. umm..
quite a bit like Mario Kart. Gee, that's it.


Multi-format

   Finally, Videogames.com runs a very nice Holiday Buyer's
Guide. Very nice. Check this out: You can actually send 
a wish-list e-mail to unsuspecting family members. I can
think of two things to put on my list:

1. Nintendo 64
2. Zelda 64

Cheers, folks! OtakuBoy out!

             See a cool story? Send it to me!
