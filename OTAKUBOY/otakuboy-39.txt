   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   OtakuBoy done erred. I made a mistake. I said last ish 
that I couldn't wait to wrap my meaty hands around a 
Dreamcast controller and play Sonic. Remember? 

   Well, I regret sayin' that! Yeah, I do. Why? Because 
the amount of Sonic stuff out there tonight is un-be-leave-
able! Jeez!

-----------

Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   And it disappoints me, too. Cause I wanted to lead with
PSX stuff. But who can ignore all this?

   Check out the full review o' "Sonic Adventure" at Console
Domain. I like this one -- it's really long and really 
detailed. You'll love it, too. (Or maybe not, if you like
short stuff.) Inside the review are teeeeny reviews (tm)
about the games inside Sonic. But SegaNet pulls 'em out a 
bit more and gives them their own reviews. Check out their
site for word on the VMS "Chaos Breeding" game, and Sonic
Pinball. (NO! Not Spinball Sonic.) 

   Last night, I sent out an OTAKUBOY BULLETIN about Sega X
and their Sonic walkthrough. Well, in case you missed it,
the link's here, too. Also, SegaNet has posted a level
guide. Not as visual as the Sega X guide, but worth the 
read. Yeah, d00d, yeah.

   Grab a hold of your T1 and start downloadin'! Lots and
lots of new Sonic movies tonight from Sega X and SegaNet.
Sega X's movies are from the game while SegaNet focus on
the Tails portion of the game. And lastly, on Sega X, 
pictures of the secret Sonic character. Boy, he's freaky
lookin'! (WHO'S FREAKY LOOKIN'?!?! - Secret Sonic Character)

   Hehehe... oh the debate continues. I gotta stop laughing
to myself without telling you what's going on. Ahem. In this
case, I'm laughing because for awhile now, there's been a 
big debate across many sites -- large blunt objects have
been involved -- about whether you can indeed use the 
Dreamcast Passport software and Modem outside Japan. Well,
the debate goes on. Console Domain shows you exactly how
you can use it. Bear in mind, though, I am an unlucky
bastard. Therefore, I can not confirm this on my own
Dreamcast. CAUSE I DON'T HAVE ONE! *SOB* :(

   HEY!!! Look HERE! Sorry, usually I'd put a super inter-
view such as this way at the top of a section. But with
all that Sonic stuff... Anyway, GaGames has a really nift
interview with Greg Zeschuk, President and CEO of Bioware
Corp. Not impressed? Think "MDK2!" Think Dreamcast! Now
click, man. CLICK!

   Couple of First Impressions for you -- both from Sega X,
uber Sega site! They impress firstly on "Incoming" and 
"Seventh Cross." They both got bad reviews in Famitsu, 
though... Gaming-Age and SegaNet have word that "Marvel vs.
Capcom" is comin' to Dreamcast. Wooohooo! SheHulk and Mega
Man sit in a tree. K.i.s.s.i.n.g. 

   Do you still have a hold of that T1? Well, a 56k-er will
do for all the new screen shots on the Web tonight. First,
Dreamcaster has new shots from "Evolution," "Power Stone,"
"Aerodancers," and "Buggy Heat." Gaming-Age and SegaNet
have new "ShenMue" pics -- some SUPER HI-RES! And even more
screens in the form of "Frame Gride," from GameSpot.

   Speaking of GameSpot, they take a super-brief look at
"Kitahe: Heading North." If you're a fan of those Japanese
dating games, then you're going to love this one!

   And Dreamcast-finally, the guys at National Console 
Support have cover shots of the new Dreamcast Fan magazine.


PlayStation (PSX) 

   Darn it! I LOVE my PSX! LOVE IT! *SOB* I just can't make
you the last OtakuBoy section again. No NO NO! I can't.]
*WEEP*

   IGNPSX runs a collection of the "top" IGNPSX reviews for
1998. So, if you're a fan of IGNPSX, or if you're a fan of
IGNPSX reviews, or if you're a fan of reviews, or if you're
a fan of words, or if you're a fan of language, or if you're
a fan of the PlayStation, or if you're a fan of synaptic
activity, then you want to check this out.

   PSXNation brings the release date (psst - March/April 
1999) for "Legend of Legaia," while Game-Online has a super
preview of the new kid-boxer on the block "Prince Naseem
Boxing." 

   G'ameC'enter reviews "T'ai F'u." And Re:Tokyo takes a
tiny look at the new "Space Invaders 2000" released in
Japan. It's the 20th anniversary of the game that sparked 
the videogame revolution -- and loads of radio shows like
Art Bell's Coast-To-Coast. ;)


Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   "BattleTanx" is comin' out TOMORROW, big fellas! Do ya
think we'll see the same kinda lines we saw for Zelda? Any-
hoo, Nintendojo has an interview with Michael Mendheim,
Creative Director and Lead Designer, and IGN64 updates 
their preview.

   Hey, did you know Miyamoto won an award recently? Yep,
he sure did -- for being such a swell videogame-makin'
machine. Check out the news at Re:Tokyo. 

   64Source is gettin' a little suspicous. I mean, how many
PSXs have been sold. REALLLLY! They pull apart recent num-
bers and show you why they aren't all that and a bag o'
chips. (The 'bag o' chips' hip phrase brought to you by 
OtakuBoy Online. Witty phrases since the Aztec Empire.)

   Yippeee! Hoooray! A new "Bomberman!" Check out GameSpot
for the details. And speaking of bombs (hey, I needed a 
segue), ConsoleDomain shows you how to walk all over and
through "Turok 2." And 64 Source publishes all the latest
review numbers from Famitsu on Japanese N64 powerhouses
"Ganbare Goemon 2," "Chameleon Twist 2," "Snowspeeder," and
"Toukon Road."

   Surely, you "Jest" -- Videogames.com previews the up-
coming N64 title. Videogamers.com takes a look at the "ASCII
Wheel 64," the super cool steering wheel. Race your way to 
victory!!!!! (I still need a code. I suck at games.) And
speaking of CODES (now, this segue works), Videogames.com
has new codes for "South Park!"

   Over on GameBoy Euro-Asia, check into their "Zelda DX
Hints, Tips & Cheats Companion." After all, you want to 
beat the game in mere hours, don't you? Also on GameBoy
Euro-Asia, a super review of "Shanghai Pocket." 

   And GameBoy-finally, two new Web sites debut for the
upcoming Looney Tunes games, "Twouble" and "Carrot Crazy."
Also, check out the info on "Bugs Bunny - Heroin Junkie."
Just Kiddin'. Hehehehe.


Multi-format & Misc

   Hey, hey, hey! Namco is gettin' ready to produce ANIME?!
REALLY?! Oh, oh my. I am sweating in anticipation. Please,
someone hand me a Kleenex while you read the info on 
RE:Tokyo. Oh, oh, oh dear.

   Miyamoto wasn't the only videogame d00d to win an award
recently. Check out the entire award round-up at RE:Tokyo.

   Meanwhile over on Nikkei Weekly, the full story about
Square, their Final Fantasy series, and the movie comin'
reeeeeeeeeeeeeel soon now. ;)

   And, lastly, hook up your N64/PSX/DC/SAT/2600 (just kid-
ding on that last one) to your computer monitor! It's called
JAM, and you'll love it. I think that's what Digital-Ages
means in their review. 

  Oh, here's one last item. Matt McDevitt, uber Japanese
translator, runs a Web site in which he's translated
messages from Japanese newsgroups. It's really cool to read
all the different comments and remarks from Japanese gamers.
Check out Matt's site! PLEASE! (He promised not to beat me
up if I posted this.)


Cheers, folks.

             See a cool story? Send it to me!
