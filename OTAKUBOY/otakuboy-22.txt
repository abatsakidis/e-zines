   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   Blessed be! I mean videogame sites that aren't graphics
heavy. Like Gamespot's news page. Ah, what fun not to wait
like you have to do NintenDojo. Jeez! Good thing the 
Nintendo stuff today was super-cool. I was almost gonna
bail!

-----------

Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   Ah, I'd never do that to you! Never! It's cool links I'm
after. And I'll download all the graphics I have to to make
sure you get cool links!

   And, boy, did I have to be patient today with all the
"Turok 2" graphics-heavy stuff. NintenDoJo runs an interview
with one of the developer-team members. Get all the behind
the scenes info you could want. Afterwards, Nth Dimension 
set up a bunch of movies for you to look at. (And believe 
me, after running to the fourth store to see the Turok 2
demo only to find that either the controller don't work or
the TV ain't turned on, I'm happy to get ANYTHING! Never
come to New Orleans to play in-store games. I warn you!)
Anyway, check out the four movies at Nth Dimension. And
finally, just to hold on the bad news at long as I can,
IGN64 repots that Turok 2's ship date has slipped. Buggers!

   Sing this Monkees song: Here it commmmes. Comin' down
that street. Settin' up on the store shelves. All throughout
EBeeee! Hey, hey, It's Zelda! Just one week til it's around!
Some say it'll be too expensive. Oh just go and plunk yer
money downnnnnnnnn. Ahem. GameFan tries to hype you up for
the launch some more. And if you think Zelda's not enough of
a reason to buy a Nintendo this year or next, Game-Online
gives you more reasons to buy a N64 in '99. And, hey, go
read Nekkei Net Daily News' reports about Nintendo's pretax
profits after. They're up! Of course, their sales are down,
too. Maybe your N64 and/or Zelda purchase will help the 
bottom line.

   Pokemon rage hits again! Why? Does Pikachu spark amorous
feelings in the hearts of men? In the loins of men? Well,
the toys hit New York (details at GameSpot), Pikachu sets
Japanese hearts ablaze (also at GameSpot) and "Pokemon
Stadium" for the N64 seems a might weird (at IGN64).

   Check your pulse when you turn on yer N64 and "South
Park" in the coming months. Why? Videogame "stuns" aren't
very nice. Detials at IGN64. "Extreme-G2" ships early!
Why? Apparently the publisher's a glutton for punishment.
"F-Zero X" is gonna KICK ITS ASS! Anyway, check out the
news story at IGN64 and then the review at Videogames.com

   Remember last week we talked about a fighter where Mario
was a character? Oh what FUN! This puppy's fer real! It's
called "Nintendo All-Star Dai-Rantou Smash Brothers," and
Mario ain't the only you can use to FINISH yer opponent. 
(Rumor has it that Mario secret weapon is a wet noodle. But
you didn't hear this from me.) News at IGN64 and GameSpot.
PICS at GameSpot. Meanwhile, IGN64 has news of a "Rugrats
Board Game." And, finally, check out the "NBA Live '99"
review at GameFan!

Viva la N64!


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   First, da bad news Dreamcast brothers: Well, maybe it's
not all that bad. Digital-Ages regurgitates all the current
problems plaguing Dreamcast. And just like real regurgiata-
tin', it all smells. P.U. ;) 

   But this smells sweet, baby! Sega X has an interview with
Shoichiro Irimajiri. Who's that? Ummm... a importanto d00d
over at Sega. See why he thinks Dreamcast is gonna lay waste
to this entire console Earth. And could there be anything
that would make Dreamcast games sweeter? Yeah, boy! A new
arcade board. Details at Dreamcaster.

   What's this? "Virtua Fighter 4" on the way? I just can't
believe it somehow. Looks like I picked the wrong week to
stop sniffing glue. Details (?) at Sega X. Also at Sega X
(and also at Dreamcaster), links to Sonic movies and sounds
from Sonic CD! Listen to Sonic make hot, passionate ... 
gaming sounds! Yeah, that's it.

   More "Project Berkeley" pics. This time it's Gaming-Age
with the pic-news. They've also got super cool pics of
"Aerodancers," the really wack-wack-wacky flying sim. (Ac-
tully, it's not all that wacky. Sorry, I got carried away.)
And here's something else that's not wacky. Download big,
hulking, hi-res "Virta Fighter 3tb" characters for your
Windows backgrounds.

   And pretend Lassie just walked in the room. RUFF! There's
gonna be a new Game Gear? RUFF! It's gonna be in color? 
RUFF!!! It's gonna be 32-bit?! GROWWWLLLL SNAP! Ow! OW, Not
BITE! BIT! BIT! Jeez! Go to Digital-Ages fer the info.

PlayStation (PSX) 

   On to PSX where more and more PSX2 news oozes down the
rumor pipe. IGNPSX runs some news-speculation while FGN
Online (remember, ya gotta scroll on this blasted site)
hears that developer kits are goin' out. Ha! I'll believe
it when I can develop on it.

   IGNPSX's is spot-lightin' Capcom today. See all the games
YOU can ask for this Christmas/X-Mas/Hanukkah. (Um, I can
ask for twelve Capcom games, if I want.)

   Also at IGNPSX, a Super Preview (patent pending) of
"Final Fantasy VIII." Seems the guys got a hold of the demo
disc floatin' around these days. But wait... what's this? 
A delay? And what?! A $65 price tag?!?! Oh great gobs of 
goo. ("Great Gobs of Goo" appears courtesy of the old "O.G.
Whiz Presents Tubby" comic books.) Details at Gaming-Age.
Ah, but I am clever. I smushed (not smashed) the bad news
around good. First the Super Preview and now news of a
"Final Fantasy IX?!?!" (That's '9', for all you mono-
linguals.) And then, just to sweeten the deal, here's the
full o-fish-shal news of the Final Fantasy movie! Hoo HOO!

   It's Bomberman, the re-mix. Just like Celine Dion's hits,
a re-mix is worth all your dollahs. Details at Gaming-Age.
"Hardball '99" shoots out da bullpen (details: GameWEEK). 
Meanwhile, Game-Online notes all the sequels comin' out in
'99. And speakin' o' sequels! Check out sequels "Broken
Sword II," and "Tower II." All at Videogames.com.

   Hey, "Grand Theft Auto" hits a MILLLLLLLLION sold today!
WOW! Check GameFan! Remember that link I gave you to 
Centipede last time? Well, I fergot to mention that the
little bugger (pun intended) is comin' to PSX. WOW! GameFan
previews. 

   But here's a preview worth as many clicks as you can
muster, mister. In fact, click doubly so. "G-Police 2!"
Game-Online! Click-CLICK! Videogames.com previews "WCW
Thunder." (It's Thunderiffic!) And Sony tries to make thun-
der with a super boxing title. Where to find out more? 
IGNPSX.

   More on Roll Cage today. It's at Game-Online. Speaking 
of things that roll (and twist), check out the review of 
"Asteroids" on IGNPSX. "Apocalypse" reviewed on Game-Online,
then on Videogames.com, read the heart pitter-pattering re-
view of "Street Fighter Collection 2." 

   IGNPSX runs a super cool guide/faq/code thingy on "Armored
Core: Project Phantasma." Come along and ride on my Project
Phantasma voyage.

   Where has Rod Nakamoto gone? You know Rod. (No, not your
Rod.) He's the guy that's did "Prophecy" and "Secret Ops."
Game Fan tracked 'im down...

   Bye-ya, sweet-hawts! OtakuBoy out.

             See a cool story? Send it to me!
