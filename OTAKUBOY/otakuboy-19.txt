   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

     I am back, folks, and I have extra brain capacity. This
I am sure of! Yes! How do I know? Well, I can't get my hair
cut because of my illness; I may infect der barber. So, my
hair has grown taller and taller and, I'm assuming, it's 
because my brain has increased in size. Either that or I
have the biggest hair helmet this side of Barry Gibb.

    Some quick OtakuNews. We (I have multiple personalities)
are back, yes. But, for now, we're onna a three-day-a-week
schedule. Too little time on my hands. T-t-t-t-tickin' away.
We may switch back to five soon. 

-----------

PlayStation (PSX) 

   Or it could be that my hair has grown because I'm so ex-
cited about the news that someone is working on a chipset
for PSX2! Who? Sheesh. You know better than to ask me.
Instead, go and ask Videogames.com. Meanwhile, all this
PSX2 rumor-mongering is balderdash, ain't it? I mean, it
ain't comin' for a long, long time. Right? Check out 
IGNPSX's Off-The-Cuff rumor mill. And other rumors such as
"Final Fantasy VIII" comin' early! And, if that's not enough
of the rumor-stuffs. Check out PSXMax and Kingboxer's latest
set of rumors. "Rival Schools 2?" Hmmmm...
   
   Oh jeez. Yet another "Street Fighter Alpha" preview.
This time it's over at Digital-Ages. Rehash the fun. But,
hey, any news is good news, right? Well, any news about
"Final Fantasy VIII" _is_ good news. And Gaming-Age checks
in with news of new characters. Also at Gaming-Age,
more Quake pics. Stare at the 2d fun tonight!

   As the ad says, "Craaaaaash is training for his greatest
adventure yet." How does Videogames.com rate this dog's
return? Check it out. Gaming-Age checks out "Future Cop
LAPD." (Why can't there be a past cop? Think of it. You,
the outlaw West, and a six shooter. And we can give do it
in stunning 4-bit graphics to complete the effect.)

   Console Domain has a preview of "Small Soldiers." Is it
un-spectacular? Check it out. Oh, yes, they call it 
"Streak." It likes to show off it's source code. Ahem. And
GameFan review's Streak's performance. And lastly, IGNPSX
reviews "NBA (it's-all-the-way) LIVE '99," the nutty PSX
game with the can-do attitude. 

   Oh, one last thing. Wanna bring "Policenauts" and/or
"Snatcher" to PSX? Yeah!! YEAH!! Well, it ain't comin'. 
Unless, of course, you sign the virtu-petition. GameFan
runs the link to the site; I give you the actual link.
So, click and sign. While you're at it, sign several times.
(There's no way to verify it anyway.)


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   Oh what does Shinya Nishigaki, infamous "Blue Stinger"
producer, have to say for himself? In fabulous Sega-X-o'
vision, feast your eyes on an interview, reprinted from 
EDGE magazine. GAMECENTER runs a Super, Super Preview (tm)
of all things Dreamcast, including the "company line," 
interviews, and all kinds of other stuff. Worth your hard-
earned clicks.

   WOW! Sega Japan posted a bunch of "Virtua Fighter 3tb"
movies. You gotta, gotta download them. (Just scroll down
near the bottom of the screen to find them.) Meanwhile,
ole' Jaz at IGNDreamcast got to play the sucka. Console
Domains runs a Super-Big-Preview-Wrap-Up-Super-Big-Re-Cap-
Thingy (also (tm)) of Sonic Adventure, and Gaming-Age has
even more Sonic pics, scanned (ripped?) from Dreamcast
Magazine. 

   Hmmm... And here's an odd one. A review, on 
Dreamcaster.net, of "Turok 2" for N64. HUH?! What's this 
schlep doin' in Dreamcast stuff? Well, if you scroll down
to the very very bottom, you see a quote that considers
the portability of Turok 2 PC to Dreamcast. (Dreamcast,
for those of you who don't know (?!?!?!), has much of it's
system based on Windoze CE. EEEEEEEEEEP!)


Nintendo 64 (N64)

   Hey, let's continue the "Turok 2" bonanza! Console Domain
runs an in-store demo preview/review. (Is it a Preview or
a Review? Only its HTML coder can tell.) Meanwhile, The Nth
Dimension runs a preview of "Night Creatures." 

   What's this? Everyone's got Star Wars on the virtual-
brain, especially IGN64. They run separate stories detail-
ing the ships, characters and other aspects of both "Star
Wars: Rogue Squadron" and the way-far-away-but-nevertheless-
upcoming "Pod Racer," based on the new Star Wars movie. All
these links oughta keep you busy til both games come out.
If you happen to be the one person that can't stand Star
Wars, 64 Source has a great preview of "Ogre Battle 3." I
mean, this is a really good preview. If you don't check
this out, you go to bed without any supper.

   While I was away, Nintendo launched a bunch-a Web sites.
Among them? F-Zero and Zelda64. Details at 64 Source. And
speaking of Zelda, Nintendo Underground wants to make sure
YOU can spot the right box when looking for the Zelda gold
cart. So, they posted picture of it from a sales circular
they spied. Rumors floatin' around that you'll get a chance
to FINISH MARIO! Don't know what I mean? Think: fighters. 
Think: Mortal Kombat. Think: Mario. Now, Click: 64 Source.

   And one last thing: The Vibe over at Nintendo Underground
wants to know why everyone hates Luigi. I don't. I'd love
to tell you about the night Me, Luigi, and cannoli had some
fun... but I'm running out of time. 

 
Multi-format

   Whatever happened to "Busby 3D" for Saturn. I tell ya.
I stay up many a-night trying to answer that question.
Many a-night. (Of course, it could have been all that
caffeine. No, it's Busby and Saturn.) Anyway, 
Videogames.com introduces you to the Graveyard -- games
that didn't make it to your console. Also at Videogames.com,
the History of Final Fantasy! Could it be the Final History
of Final Fantasy?

   RE:Tokyo continues their coverage of The Handheld Wars
with two new updates -- Sony's PDA and WONDERSWAN. Both of
which will hit Japan very soon. Which one will be under
YOUR Christmas tree. (Yeah, I think it'll be GameBoy Color,
too.) While that happens, videogame sales are goin' through
the ROOF! Details and GameWEEK. IGN launches a Super
Christmas Guide (I'm afraid this title is (tm  Imagine
Games Network)). 

   What's with all this movie news?! First, I gotta tell
you about a game near to MY heart. Gaming-Age, in conjunc-
tion junction (what's your function) with Aint-It-Cool-News,
bring news of a CASTLEVANIA MOVIE?! Holy Macroni! Plus,
both GameFAN and Digital-Age cover news of a Final Fantasy
movie. Oh my! The Silver Screen's about to turn CONSOLE!

OtakuBoy out. See you Wednesday.
