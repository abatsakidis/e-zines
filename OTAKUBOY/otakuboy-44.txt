   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   It occurred to me tonight that I have to explain some-
thing about OtakuBoy's layout. 

   Sometimes in the links you see a third line and some-
thing in quotes. It looks like this:

-- [Description]
-- [Web Address]
-- ["xxxxxxxx"]

   The first two lines are the ones you see every single 
issue. But the third line is special. Some sites, unfortun-
ately, don't offer a direct link to some stories. Usually
these are news items. Instead, they construct a page with
all the stories, and you're supposed to scroll down in
order to to see everything.
 
   OtakuBoy prides himself (he also touches himself, but
that's another story) on providing you with direct links
to stories. But I can't give you a direct link on these
sites. So, the quote in the third line is either the
story's headline or the first few words. (Some sites
highlight the first few words.) So, when you go to the
site, just scroll down until you see those words.

   I've played around with different ideas and this seems
to work. But if you don't agree, send me mail! 

                  Otakuboy@bigfoot.com

   Also, we have a NEW section today! GameBoy Color!

-----------

PlayStation (PSX) 

   Many sites are a-titter over the new "Final Fantasy
Collection" comin' to PSX reeely soon. You see, "Final 
Fantasy Collection" is going to have a bunch-a earlier FF
titles. Gamers Republic has the news of all those titles,
AND news about a limited edition FF clock comin' out.

   And speakin' of Final Fantasy (although this news is
about "Final Fantasy VIII") Gamespot has news of the nifty
card game inside the new RPG!

   News about the Connectix PSX Emulator for Macintosh keeps
on-a goin'. IGNPSX has the second part of the COOL interview
with Connectix about the emulator AND a first-impressions
piece with screen shots! And on PSXMax? The other shoe drops.
Sony files suit! (Well, duh.)

   GO a-fishin' on your PSX and you'll get your "B.A.S.S."
kicked. Hmmm.. this pun worked a lot better in my head. A-
HEM! Anyway, GameFan has news on the upcoming THQ title. 
Meanwhile, IGNPSX has news about Namco's "Point Blank Range
2." 

   OOH! Couple of nifty new Japanese titles comin' out.
First, GamersRepublic looks at "Waku Puyo Dungeon." It's an
RPG. Wanna import it? PSXNation looks at "Pocket MuuMuu." 
Gotta tell you... didn't quite understand this one. :(

   PSX-FINALLY!! Digital-Ages has a bad case of the 
"Asteroids." Maybe that's why they review on their site
tonight? Check it out!


Nintendo 64 (N64)

   WOAH! What's this?!?!? "Resident Evil 64?" Biohazard co-
min' to Nintendo 64? No way... and yet, IGN64 says it's 
true. (Actually, Capcom says it's true in a Japanese inter-
view.) Check out IGN64 for the full info.

   Could it be? "Zelda 64" bigger than Adam Sandler? Yes,
it's true. (Sorry, Sandler fans.) Actually, I don't know if
Zelda's really BIGGER than Sandler. But it is bigger than
some motion pictures. Check out the money-train press re-
lease on Nintendo.com.

   Soooooo, with "GoldenEye 64" such a big deal, IGN64 
wants to know, who's gonna get the publishing deal for the
next Bond film. A bit o' news, a bit o' analysis... it's 
all on IGN64.

   Nintendojo has a BIG preview of "Carmageddon 64." They
even gots (so they say) "rare" pics. Who am I to say? Mean-
while, IGN64 has a big preview of "Animaniac's Ten Pin
Alley." If Milo's Astro Lanes didn't do anything for you,
maybe this one will?

   64 Source takes a review-ish like look at "Wetrix!" Heck,
64 Source goes so far as to call it a "sleeper." Does this
mean it's knocking off on the job? That it's lazy? Hmmmm...
Meanwhile, check out Videogamers.com for their review of
the "Memory Pak X4." And they say it's like the best memory
pak for the N64 anywhere!

   AHA! Here's a couple fun links. First, IGN64 has news
about a wacky "Battletanx" commercial that's sure to cure
the Pokemon cutie-wootie-pie in you. Also, Nintendojo's
Box Art section has been updated with new art from "NBA Jam
'99," "NHL Breakaway '99" and "Vigilante 8." Man, you might
wanna check out the whole section. There's so much art 
there. 


GameBoy Color (GBC)

   WOW! A new section. GameBoy Color deserves its own sec-
tion. All consoles are one with me. I love every console!

   GameBoy Euro-Asia has a great little piece stuck right
in the middle of their News Flash! about the Pokemon card
game from Wizard's Of The Coast, makers of Magic The Lather-
ing. Anyhoo, not only do you get to read news about the new
card game, but you also get to read some first impressions!
Also on GameBoy Euro-Asia, news that "Duke Nukem" is coming
to the little color portable that could. Plus, GameBoy Euro-
Asia lists the latest releases.

   GameSpot also takes a look at recent and upcoming titles!
Viva la GameBoy COLOR!


Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   Ahem. Asia Biz-Tech has a really good interview with 
Sega-exec Shoichiro Irimajiri about how the Dreamcast is
gonna grab 50% of the market. Don't believe me that he said
that? Go ahead. I'll wait here while you read it....
......... told you.

   OOh la la! SegaNet has news of a new super title called
"Super Speed Racing" comin' to the Super new Dreamcast. Oh,
I love new titles. Also on SegaNet, a bit of an editorial.
How will the DC enter Australia? In the same editorial, the
last bell tolls for the Saturn. :(

   Sega-Otaku reports that "Real Sound 2" has been delayed
a few weeks! NO! Why, GOD WHY!! Meanwhile, could 1/28 be
"Sega Rally 2's" magic number? Check out Gaming-Age. (They
also take a guess about when import shops should get it.) 

   So, which titles will be ported from PC to DC? Sega-
Otaku lists the latest. 

   Over on SegaX, two super new Sonic Adventure walk-
throughs. This time? It's Tails and Amy! I love Amy. (Love?
Yes, love. But she has spurned me.) Also on SegaX, super
movies from "Shenmue" with in-game footage! And, Dreamcast-
finally, (and SegaX-finally), check out the Dreamcast
English manual scans!


Multi-format & Misc

   Hey, remember how Sega distributed the WonderSwan and
many sites noted last week how Bandai took the wonder-porta-
ble from Sega distribution? Well guess who got it. Yep,
SONY! Check out Gaming-Age for the info.

   FGN Online reports that "software-based" Metal Gear Solid
trading cards are coming. Print them out and show your 
friends!


New Sites

   Hey! Couple-a new sites came to my attention this week.
Pretty cool! 

   First, here's a new Videogaming Trading list. Tired of
all those auctions and bad traders? Ah, so am I. So am I.
TESTIFY! Can I get a witness and stuff?! Anyway, Shanna
launches a Videogame Trading list on OneList! Check it out.

   Also, Zelda-fan, Shane, loves his Zelda. How much? Ummm..
Well, when I asked him about his page, he got just a little
too excited. That's all I can say. 

Cheers, folks.

             See a cool story? Send it to me!
