   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   I'm SO SORRY! (There, I promised I'd never start a news-
letter with those three words, but I had to this time so I
thought I'd just get it outta the way first and foremostly.)
Anyway, there are many reasons why you're staring at a 
terribly late issue. Mostly, though, it's about writing a 
feature story for a magazine which had to be in the ready
this week. Lots of work. I missed looking for cool stories.
Good thing I got to it today!!!

-- WOOOHOOO! GUNDAM MOVIE - Movie
   Boy, it's such a long running series, that Gundam. It
just keep goin' and goin'. I guess it just translates well
from anime to game. Dunno. Anyhoo, check out this GUNDAM
SIDE STORY MPEG! Hey, the links go to the same movie; one's
just a mirror. SegaX has quite a bit about how the game will
run, too!

-- WOOOOHOOOOOO! BLUE STINGER MOVIE! - Movie/Pics
   Meanwhile, and super happy hooray especially, here's a
new BLUE STINGER MOVIE, courtesy of Minaduki, super Japanese
videogame site. (And pointed out to me by GameFAN!) Oh, it's
like 14 MEGS! So, if that's too much, check out the
IGNDreamcast link for a buncha pics.

-- Puyo-Puyo 4 - Preview
   Dimension takes off the wraps of PUYO-PUYO 4 and I gotta
tell you -- I haven't seen all that much of 3! WHAT
HAPPENED?!? Anyway, looks like much of the same blobby fun.

-- Power Stone - Review/Movie
   COOL! We're starting to see POWER STONE reviews and
that's darn nifty, sister-babe. That's what I say. Tell me
what I say. Anyway, check out this review. It's pretty good
and really rips into the so-called fight-mechanics of 3D
fighters. SegaX? Well, those guys love everything Sega, now
don't they! THAT'S WHY THEY RULE! No, seriously, they take a
look at POWER STONE and how it falls within the current
genre of fighters. But what's more important is there super
cool 1 minute long movie! Meanwhile, check out the POWER
STONE FAQ on Dimension-S!

-- A BUG in FF8?!?! - News
   Yoiks! Word is there's a problem in FINAL FANTASY VIII.
Something to do with clearing a certain area in a certain
amount of time. Oh, I don't know if I understand it cause I
don't have the game!!! So, go read this news item on
GameSpot, which also gives you a tip on how to avoid it!

-- The PlayStation Meeting - Recap/Buzz-starter
   GameFAN kinda rekindles the fire about what could happen
at the big-wig Sony meeting next week. Will they announce
the PlayStation2? Can developers start talking about the
supposed PSX2 development kits floating about? Well Sony
move away from electronics and into birth-control devices.
GameFan explores all the possibilites and THEN SOME!

-- DINO CRISIS! - News
   Cool! This sounds better than that TRESPASSER stuff! You
basically like run away from Dinos. They suck, especially
when they eat you. Durn it. Gaming-Age has a nice story, but
I like IGNPSX's better. They've got LOADS o' info on the
plot. Could be a new Lara in the making? Check out the se-
cond link which has some pictures. (The IGNPSX link has
pics, too.) Notice any similarities between Jurassic Park
and DINO CRISIS? Hmmm....

-- Final Fantasy VIII's Guardian Force Summons - Movies
   A neat idea, whose time has come. We will sell no wine

collection of the Guardian Force summons in FINAL FANTASY
VIII. Bring along your T-1.

-- Have pointy head? Touch things. - Japanese Game Preview
   What is the SEGARE IGIRI? Someone tell me. No, seriously,

games, but not a-one MONSTER TRUCK battle game! And that's
where MONSTER TRUCK MADNESS comes in! That's right! Super,
dooper, electric para-trooper cool signalfying MONSTER TRUCK

new fighter.

   Nintendojo is in EARLY! N2000 is comin. What will its

Nintendojo opens up a section dedicated to the next Nintendo
machine. And here's a cool feature... Nintendo suddnely re-
gistered a bunch of domains... Hmmm....

   This is pretty neat. Ever wanted to make music on your
GameBoy? Sure you have. You've sat up long nights, turning
your GBC on and off, hoping against hope that some mystery
music-making menu will come up. But it didn't so you fired up
your old Commodore 64 and Music Construction Set. And as your
tears dropped on the keyboard, you wished aloud for a GameBoy
music composer. WELL WAIT NO MORE MY WATERY-EYED FRIEND!

in therapy. Anyway check out the news on GameSpot.
