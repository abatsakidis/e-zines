-- ANOTHER Sonic Adventure VMS Game - News 

   Famitsu Weekly and S.A. teamed up in a sense to put out
a brand-spanking new SONIC ADVENTURE VMS game. This time,
you gotta look for a REAL hedgehog. I can't BELIEVE IT?!
Real hedgehogs don't look like SONIC! :(

-- Does UbiSoft have a PSX2 up their sleeve? - News/Rumor?

   Well, well, well. Looks like UbiSoft loosened their lips
a bit and said that the next RAYMAN will hit Dreamcast AND
PSX2. How is this possible? Next-Generation investigates.

-- A bit on a PSX invitation-only meeting - News

   Next-Generation has a report about an invitation-only
meeting where Sony promises to show some nifty stuff. This
is the best story I've seen about it, which is all over the
Web. Has a bit o' analysis and all kinds of stuff. Plus,
they called a bunch a-developers to ask them about it and
they've changed their answer to the question about having a
PSX2 kit. Ooopsies.

-- A more reliable way to defeat Mod-Chip lockout? - News

   BOY! You REALLY gotta wanna play FF8 for this $78 dollar
solution. Digital-Ages reports on a NEW way to beat that
Square/FF8 mod-chip breaker. Meanwhile, Gaming-Age hears a
report that the Phantom Mod Chip will work, while the Shark
codes a lot of sites have been reporting work... but not for
long. You see, FF8 does a LOT of checks and at some point
the codes fail. Wow. They reallllly didn't want this title
imported and/or pirated!

-- Tales of Destiny - RPG Review

   Riddle me this... (Or answer me this. I've always wanted
to say "riddle me this.") Let's say you buy an RPG today
that's a sequel to a fairly popular RPG from a previous
generation o' consoles. This NEW RPG, which runs on some
pretty sophisticated hardware, looks an awful lot like it
was drawn for that older console. Does this bother you? Or
is the RPG's STORY the thing? Well, IGNPSX reviews TALES OF
DESTINY, the sequel to Tales of Phantasia on the SNES and
while they say the game is cool, the graphics are very SNES.
Does this bother you? It bothers our "guest editor."

-- NCAA March Madness '99 - Review

   Even in Console Domain's review of NCAA Final Four, NCAA
MARCH MADNESS '99 was mentioned as a much better game. And
it does seem pretty cool. Why? I don't know. ;) Actually
 it seems put together better. Go see GameCenter's XXXX
review. (That's Four X's, not QUAD-X porn, you sickie.)

-- Nintendo's next machine in 2001? - News

   Lotsa sites reportin' that Peter Main, who did a speech
at the annual toy fair.. yeah, you remember the IGN64 link
I carried below.. says that the next Nintendo would appear
around 2001. Read this short bit about it and Nintendo
Underground. But you know, fellers, I gotta tell ya that
I didn't read this the same way. I think he was speaking
generally, not specifically. But, hey, that's my take.

-- Duke Nukem: Zero Hour - Preview-Movie 

   Ok Ok Ok. The MAIN reason to go here is the super cool,
new Dukey Nukey movies. Lots of 'em, too. One, "Naughty,
naughty Duke," is "uncensored." Oooh weee, ooh. (Durn it.
I'm still chuggin' along at 28.8. I can't download the thing
fast enough. Oh, I got it. Umm.. it's uncensored, but not
shocking.) Anyway, the MAIN reason to go is for the movies.
But the preview on the same page is top-rate.

-- Ninja Gaiden - Poll/Revisted-News

   Now THIS is a way to do a news story. A few days ago,
all the Web world was a-titter over Tecmo's poll about a new
NINJA GAIDEN. I carried the link figuring a lot of you would
remember. And maybe you HAVE! But jeez, I don't remember
that anyone really told us what the series had been about.
(It's an OLD NES game series.) Well, Videogames.com does
this in their newsbit about Tecmo's poll. And just in case
you don't remember that earlier news, Tecmo is running a
poll on their Web site: Would you buy another NINJA GAIDEN?

   Whoopsies. Turns out it's NOT flattery when you take the

in a game. A few retired baseball players have filed suit
against several developers. YOINKSEEE! Check out
Next-Generation for the details.
