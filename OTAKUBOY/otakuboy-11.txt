   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   I love PSXFans. I do. Please believe me! You see, I've
been feeling guilty ever since I put PSX news at the bottom
of last ish and then made a big deal of it. I am crying
on the inside. Hear me weep. Wavs available soon!
   Meanwhile, there's some seriously exciting news on the
N64 front today, carried in multiple places. Plus, the 
features ought to keep you busy for the next few days. Read
'em and weep. (Don't know why I just wrote that. I suppose
I was trying to tie the second paragraph to the first, 
somehow. And I like weeping.)
   
-----------

   So, we're gonna start with PSX at the top! YAY! But,
you know what? There's not a lotta stuff today. But what
there is rulez... For instance, Game-Online has a 
rumor/news about a possible first title for PSX2?! WOW!
You must check this out. 
   "Attack of the Slanted Tokyo Game Show Stories" contin-
ues today with IGNPSX's round-up on everything Square. What
was in their booth? How long did it take to get through
the line to play "Final Fantasy VIII?" It's all on IGNPSX.
   "Chocobo Racing." Hmmm... Sounds like to should have
something to do with chocolate. Maybe it does. Yer gonna
half ta read the preview over at IGNPSX. 
   Hype.se runs a pretty decent review of "Wild9" and it
turns out that those commercials running all-friggin' day
on Comedy Central are probably more wild than the game. 
IGNPSX runs a really good moxie-review of "Duke Nukem:
Time To Kill." It's got "moxie" cause it's got several
impressions inside. It's like a Christmas present. Unwrap
it tonight!
   Also, a quick news note on FGNOnline about the rocky
release of Asteroids. Hey, that sentence contains more than
a pun; it's a clue!
   Watch out for SPOILERS! That's the theme of today's N64
coverage. Why? Because Zelda Headquarters posts a review/
walkthrough of "Zelda: The Ocarina of Time's" first few
levels. Those lucky guys got to play a 90%-finished ver-
sion. But, hey, I don't blame you if you don't want to 
see. So, head on over to IGN64's "The Hyrule Times," which
answers a few of the more nagging, but less spoiling,
questions.
   NintenDojo carries an update to the preview of "Extreme
G2." Don't know what it is? Oh, it's one of those motorbike-
missles-kill-other-players game. On the site, you'll find
a few pics and a little note about the game. Meanwhile,
IGN64 carries a super cool preview (I am trying to trade-
mark that phrase) of "Duke Nukem: Zero Hour's" 4-player
mode. And Gaming-Age Busts-a-preview to "Bust-a-Move 3."
   Score another good review for GameAssault! They just
do balanced reviews -- they don't tear into developers,
they don't rip genres to pieces. They're cool. I will send
them a love letter. This time, feel the reviewer-objec-
tivity when they look at "F1 World Grand Prix." And spea-
king of racing games, "Roadster '98" rolled off the track
today. Details at FGN Online.
   And finally, in GameBoy news, The Nth Dimensions has
the story about Mulan hitting the little grey-scale screen
with the can-do attitude. Is it color? Is it Super? Check
the story out to find out.
   Virtua Fighter puts da smack down on Dreamcast news
today. First, everyone's buzzing about the VF RPG. Will it
come out? WHEN will it come out? What the hell is a VF
RPG?! Dreamcaster.net and Game-Online each has a news item.
Then you wanna know about Virtua Fighter 3, right? So, go
to Hardcoregaming's Segaholic for that info. Meanwhile, 
Videogames.com has a very brief interview with Yu Suzuki,
part of the VF series development team. (Warning: He don't
say much, really. Most insiders never go on public record
with anything exciting. Bastards.)
   Dreamcaster.net tracks down all the various DreamCast
movies available and provides links to them from their
Web site. Dreamcast Insider has news that'll make you
scream, "What the F?! My Dreamcast is purring!" And here's
a bit of sad news: Lara's breast may not bounce for 
Dreamcast. Details at Game-Online. Also at Game-Online:
Seven new Dreamcast developers announced.
   Hey, remember a while back when Otakuboy told you
about a site that ran a preview of "Pen Pen Triathalon?"
I guess it's just very hard to translate Japanese. The
REAL title -- which started appearing on sites this week --
is "Pen Pen Tri-ICE-alon." Sorry for the confusion. 
Videogames.com runs a preview of the snazzy new title. 
Is there a chance "Shogo" will appear on Dreamcast? 
Dreamcaster.net sends their spies into the chat rooms 
for the skinny (and the fatty).
   Videogames.com updates their "History of Konami." That
ones going to be in perpetual rewrites. I think Konami's
gonna be around for awhile. RE:Tokyo updates their Tokyo
Game Show coverage -- and it's cool. It's only one story,
but they have some of the best show pictures I've seen --
and a whole buncha lotta them. Hoofah. 
   PSXMax runs a feature on game endings. Why are some
shitty? Why are some cool? What makes a good ending? Why
should you care? Has anyone seen my tube of Didi Seven?
And, then, GameFan asks: Hard Games or Easy Games? Which
is better? This sounds like a topic for a Science Fiction
convention.
   OH, and one last note: 64Source has the goods on "Speed
Buster!" Go Speed Buster. GOOOOOOO! Don't let the name
of the site fool you. "Speed Buster" is destined to be 
multi-platform. Hmm... I wonder if "Speed Buster" puts
you in the driver's seat of State Police vehicle? 
   Bye, Kiddies. See you Monday.
