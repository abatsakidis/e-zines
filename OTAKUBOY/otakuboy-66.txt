   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

  This will come as a surprise, but everyday, OtakuBoy must take off his clothes. I'm quite embarassed to admit it, really. And yet I feel I must. Because when I take off my clothes -- which consists of the spiffy outfit you see me wearing on my way-cool megasite (www.otakuboy.com) -- I find that I have to put on REAL clothes and go out and work at a job. The point of all this is that I've just taken a new job and I'm adjusting to the change in time schedule. Once I do, which I imagine will only take one more week, OtakuBoy will be back with his regular scheduled updates and outfit. Work sucks.

-- PlayStation 2 Announced, the BEST stories - News
   Ok, ok. So the news is out there, right? So, who's written the BEST stories about it, eh? WHO? WHO!??!?!?!? THE IGNPSX story with quotes from industry executives takes the cake. Beyond all the tech specs, we get to hear what the game developers and publisher think about this new machine. (I think you can guess the general reaction.) Second, IGNPSX again with a PSX2 FAQ. Then Console Domain translates much of techier notes of the announcements into plain English! (Thank GOD!!!!! Not to say that Console Domain is God. Although if someone erected a monument...)

-- Side note! Old Peripherials WILL work w/PSX2 - News
   Yes, yes, yes. After you've saved up those hard earned dollars to buy all your peripherals, it's DARN pissy to find out that you can't use 'em when you buy that hot new game machine. Well, NEVER FEAR when you have a PSX2 by your side. And, hey, this will be good when you buy those new colorized Dual Shock controllers!

-- PSX2. The movies. - Movies
   Well, in a raw display of power (because a cooked display of power wouldn't be as interesting), Sony showed off movies made on the new PSX2 -- at least whatever guts there are of it.  The movies have been ALL over the net and now they're HERE in OtakuBoy, culled from all over the net.

-- Side-by-Side Demo comparisons - Pics
   Ok, ok. So, the PSX2 is great and all that. But we all remember the excitement in our pants when the Dreamcast demos started a comin' out. So, how do the new PSX2 demo screens look when compared to the Dreamcast demo images? (Er... if you're a Dreamcast fan, watch out for Sega-Otaku's proclamation that this thing will run over Dreamcast. ...)

-- I can't believe I ate the WHOLE polygon! - Opinion
   Yes, this is the PSX2 dissenting view. Well, not really. It's more an opinion that all these large polygon numbers people are throwing around about the next PlayStation are really a buncha hogwash! And I ain't washing no hog! I have no idea what that means.

-- PSX2 developers kits to appear! - News/Rumor
   Harumph. In light of the last coupla days events, this hardly seems worth mentioning, but, heck-o-deckly-doo, it's a great thing to know that we're finally going to get to see them.

-- Legacy of Kain: SOUL REAVER!!!! - MOVIE!!
   Ahh, you're gonna want popcorn for this one. Why? Cause this game keeps getting pushed back and any new movie is a good movie. (Except for, maybe, a movie that says, "Insert Game Clip here.")

-- Oddworld Abe's Exoddus! - Review
   Ok, someone PLEEEEEEZE tell me that this is different from Lemmings? I mean, it sure sounds like Lemmings -- a whole helluva lot like Lemmings. Lead the poor Mudokons to safety through puzzles. The only things these guys don't do is say "Let's Go" at the beginning of a level, and "Oh NO" when you set them all to blow up. 
-- http://www.consoledomain.com/psx/reviews/Oddworld_Abes_Exoddus.html

-- Blast Radius - Review
   Like DEFENDER? (Do you remember DEFENDER?) Then you'll like BLAST RADIUS, so says GameCenter. It's like COLONY WARS lite. Half the calories; 30% less fat. And best of all, it won't make you sleepy. Try new BLAST RADIUS, from the makers of Raisin Bran. I buy it for my family.

-- HA! Take THAT PART 3!!!!!!!!!!! - One-Way Interview
   Hehe... Bernie Stolar, exec o' Sega of America, alerted the media c a couple of days ago that he would hold a conference call to talk about the future of gaming or some such stuff. Anyway, it was a one-way call. Many reporters could be heared screaming into the phone: "HEY! You BASTARD!" "WHY ARE YOU IGNORING ME, THIS IS YOUR OLD PAL SMITTY FROM IGN!" and "BERNIEEEEEEE, BERNIEEEEEE! My EDITOR NEEDS ANECDOTES THAT SELLLLLLLLLL!" Anyway, Dreamcast Insider publishes all the call's highlights -- minus the screams.

-- Dreamcast $189? - News/Rumor?
   Ever notice how when a new system is gonna come out, gaming mags start referring to prices and "price points?" Suddenly, they start treating reading like they're retailers! (This game is sure to move your customers to buy! What with the $30.00 price point.) Anyway, GameFan caught a new Dreamcast price point in the LATimes recently. Gotta get the scrilla. Gotta getcha cash pay. C'mon! Got ta git it!

-- Multiplayer Turok? Turok 3 on N2000? - Rumors
   One source says... one source says... Could it be that the source is the reporter's grandmother? "Why, yes, Johnny. I believe Turok 3 will appear on Nintendo's next console." "THANKS GRANDMA! I just needed a source." Anyhoo, IGN64 has uncovered new details about upcoming TUROKs -- like a multiplayer game at the end of '99? And T3 on N2000? Hmmm...
-- http://ign64.ign.com/news/7177.html

-- Reviews after your own butt - News
   First-impressions are pretty cool, eh? I mean, you get to get an idea about what the game is about, whether it's going to be fun, without having to dive into all the minutae of whether the fuzziness of the small cursor in the deep background is AS FUZZY as the cursor on a previous incarnation of the game which appeared in some arcade nine years ago. So, with that in mind, it's time to take a look at VIGILANTE 8, BEETLE ADVENTURE RACING, GOEMON, FIGHTING FORCE 64, and HYDRO THUNDER. And who's the winner for me? Welp, BAR sounds cool.
