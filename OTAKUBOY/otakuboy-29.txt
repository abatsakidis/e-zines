   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

   Hey, d00ds, I'm starting to see all kinds of vanity 
domain names these days. psxrocks.com, dreamcastrules.com
my-dog's-better-than-your-dog.com. I think they're all
available through IGN! Hoofah.

   The Dreamcast train keeps a rollin'. Lots a reviews and
pics and all kinds of stuff today.

-----------

Dreamcast & Saturn (DC & SAT)

   But first, da bad news: Sonic might be delayed, maybe
til January. Is it true? No one knows, but Gaming-Age has
the rumor. Also, you can classify this under rumor, but it's
likely true. EB is already started to take pre-orders. Wow!
Details at Sega-Otaku. Meanwhile, at Dreamcast, news that
350,000 more Dreamcasts are on the way to Japanese stores.

   GameSpot has a new "Dreamcast FAQ." It's not bad, but
when they get into questions about the future such as the
date of U.S. release, etc., then they don't say much because
that info's not available! So, maybe it's kinda early. But
it's a really nice set of questions that'll be updated 
often. Meanwhile, GameSpot has a "Closer Look at Dreamcast,"
with all kinds-a movies to download. Dreamcast, can you
hear me? Can you feel me near you?

   See here! Inside "Virtua Fighter 3: Team Battle" is a 
demo disc, and on that demo disc is an interview with Yu
Suzuki. (Ed Yamaha was unavailable, as was Mr. H. Davidson.)
DreamcastIGN, as they're calling themselves now, details
the interview for you! Also, National Console Support de-
tails, what I call, the Dreamcast's bodily noises. Stuff
like how loud the fan is, the music during boot-up, etc.

   Did you know that if you buy a Dreamcast it comes with
an Internet-thingy? Of course you did! But did you know
it _can_ be used in the U.S.? FGNOnline (5th story down)
has a short, crisp paragraph detailing what you have to do.

   There's a new face at Sega of America today. It's blue
has large thorns, and the owner's known to take off running
at a moments notice. Just kidding. A news sales-type d00d
who will help launch Dreamcast in the U.S. (Oh, boy! It's
coming! It's COMING!) Details about the new man with the
plan at Dreamcaster.

   "Blue Stinger" and "Sting's Evolution" is delayed. Also,
Sting, the rock star, has delayed his own evolution, pals
say. Er.. sorry. Anyway, the two Dreamcast titles are in-
deed delayed. Details at Dreamcaster. Meanwhile, Gaming-Age
carries the apology from Climax Graphics' detailing why
they had to delay "Blue Stinger." Finally, Sega X inter-
views Climax's Shinya Nishigaki. No mention of a delay;
musta been before the announcement.

   DreamcastIGN shows you that when you put "nazi" in a 
title people will click. I did, and saw that a new game,
"Maken X" from Titus, has Nazi enemies in it. Umm... Maybe
I'm missing something. Didn't Castle Wolfenstein have 
Nazis in it? What's the big deal? Details at DreamcastIGN.

   A Sega X previewer loses it -- big time. He apparently
got his mitts on "July," and hates it. Maybe 'hates' is too
nice-a word. Jeez. Konami will debut a new shooter called
"Flight Shooter." DreamcastIGN has a preview, Videogames.com
has a number of pictures. On Gaming-Age, new pics of 
"Aerodancers." Feast your eyes.

   Virtua Fighter 3tb is out, as you know, and reviews are
a pourin' in. Here are some comments. "100% arcade form."
"The best fighting game. Period." And "It's everything we
have hoped for and more." My God? Do drugs come in every
box? I have two reviews -- one one Digital-Ages, one on
GameFan. Meanwhile, Videogames.com posts more VF3tb pics
and Sega-Otaku has scans of the manual.

   And speaking of manuals, Sega-Otaku scans the Dreamcast
manual. Can you read it? Not me! Not me!

   Videogames.com has a mega pics update, by the way, of
call kinds of Dreamcast titles -- ShenMu, Pop'N Music, and
SeaMan. Run, run, surf, surf -- if you like to look at pics.

   GameFan and Sega-Otaku review "Godzilla." Sega-Otaku
reviews "Pen Pen Tri-ice-lon." (The game whose translated
name seems to change as many times as release dates.) 

   And here's a quick flash-back for Sega fans: Gaming-Age
interviews Ed Annunziata. He's doing "Tiny Tank" now for
PSX, but this is the guy who did ECCO! Ah, I remember that
time I had the bends...


Nintendo (N64, GameBoy)

   Big news from Nintendo Co. Ltd. Japan east Asia, etc.
today. Hiroshi Yamauchi will retire -- in 2002. He put in
his 4 year notice. (God, I wonder if all employees are
required to put in 4 year notices before they quit.) Details
at Gaming-Age.

   ReTokyo wakes up for their weekly update with a very nice
pictorial story from a street corner in Japan on Zelda-
launch day. Cool. Cool. Cool. Lots of pics of people holding
up their Zelda's triumphantly. Speaking of Zelda, isn't it
about time we started seeing Guide-tos? Well, here's one
at Digital-Ages.

   In a console gaming world where the Gods are silly silly
babies, her courage will change the gaming world. Or
something. Xena's gonna get a shot on the N64. Details at
IGN64. On FGNOnline today: What's RARE been up to? It's
the 1st story, right on top.

   Here comes Spidey. The Web crawler with the inferiority
complex will makes his Webby Way to N64 via Activision. I'm
psyched! I'm getting my N64 for Christmas. Details on 
64 Source (decent story), GameFan (better) and GameWEEK
(industry perspective). Speaking of Marvel characters, X-Men
are coming, too. A BIG preview over at IGN64.

   Nintendojo broke the news about Miyamoto's next project,
his "programming" thingy. But I couldn't get to the site
the other day, so I put it off. Here's the link, finally.
(I have the most trouble with this site.) NintendojoAlso,
pics from "RayMan 2."

   So, what does the new N64 game "Pikachu Genki Dechu,"
translate to? "Pikachu is feeling fine!" Of course he is!
That puppy's loaded. Read the preview of the title where
he stars all on his lonesome. IGN64 has the goods. Also
on IGN64, pics from "All-Star Tennis 64." 

   "XG2" ain't the bomb. So says reviewer Joe Fielder on
Videogames.com. 

   And some GameBoy stuff for ya: Bug's Life debuts. De-
tails on GameFan. GameSpot has a couple of pics of "Pokemon
Card GB," a GameBoy Color Pokemon game -- kind of a card
game. On GameBoy (Oy veh!), news that the current GameBoy
GameShark will NOT work on your new GameBoy Color. Details
in the second story under December 2 news. GameBoy Euro-
Asia has news about someone from Crave Entertainment setting
up a new chat channel on IRC.

   Finally, is Nintendo gay? You decide. (It's something I
saw on Usenet over the week. Heheheheh.)


PlayStation (PSX) 

   Gaming-Age has some new, quick PSX2 info. Don't say
much, but what all can you say when the main people (ie
Sony) ain't talkin'? But the story has some new about
the new PSX2 chip and the IEEE conference next year.

   Kingboxer's back on PSXMax! WOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOO!
And he's gossipy-er than ever. What's this? A developer
for PSX2? A sell out for "Ridge Racer 4?" Read all
the rumors at PSXMax.

   Once again, the Gaming-Age Ed Annunziata interview 
comes back up for air! Why, well it _is_ about "Tiny Tank"
after all.

   Capcom announces a port of "Marvel vs. SF!" Use Hulk's
bad breath to kill everyone -- that's my secret code to you.
Details at GameFan and Digital-Ages. I recommend the GameFan
piece. Speaking of Marvel, Spidey's a shoo in for PSX. Read
all about it at IGNPSX.

   Here comes "Ace Fighter 3" from Namco -- no doubt to 
show up first in Japan. Re:Tokyo has all the rising sun 
details. Digital-Ages reports that "Silent Hill," the
Konami HORRRRRRORR game has a Japanse release date.   

   IGNPSX has preview movies of "Street Fighter Alpha 3."
Hoofah! Worth the download, every precious bit. Bugs Bunny
looooks so cute in 3D! Check out the preview of "Lost in
Time" on IGNPSX. Also on IGNPSX, the preview of "Syphon
Thriller." (They call it a thriller. And, boy, am I
thrilled.) GameFan has info on the game that used to
be Knight and Baby in Japan. It will become "Guardian's
Crusade" here, and GameFan has the preview. 

   GameSpot gots their lucky hands on "Ridge Racer 4." Wow!
They review it in short order, too. And National Console
Support has pics of the Japanese boxes.

   Asteroids, Schmasteroids, says Videogamers.com's review.
And if you LOVE the Rugrats TV show, then, um, you might
not love the game. Details at IGNPSX. And, yet another link
for IGNPSX -- a review of Mr. Domino.

Multi-format

   GameCenter takes a look at every snowboarding game known
to exist. It's a pretty good feature, but they don't look
at how old skiing games influence snowboarding -- something
I would have liked. But if you're a fan of the genre, ya
gotta go!

   Game-Online posts a "console wars" chart for the UK.
Which console leads in the UK? Details at Game-Online.

   Finally, GameBoy Euro-Asia breaks the GameBoy ranks
to give you a big feature about the WonderSwan handheld!

Cheers, folks.

             See a cool story? Send it to me!
