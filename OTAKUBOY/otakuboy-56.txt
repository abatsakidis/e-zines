   OtakuBoy loves you. OtakuBoy cares. That's why OtakuBoy 
unleashes his virtual scrubbing bubbles onto all the 
online console video game sites -- even on sites you've
never heard of before -- to scour out the best features,
reviews, previews, and news. Then OtakuBoy tells you where
to go get them.
   OtakuBoy loves you. Now, love OtakuBoy back.

=OtakuBoy Speaketh =========================================

   I am going to try something today that I hope you'll 
like. Yep. Yep. Yeppers. I am going to tinker a bit with the
format of OtakuBoy Online. Let me know if you like, or don't
like.

   All of this is in preparation for www.otakuboy.com. 
(Which is a bit operational. At least you can see the spiffy
design.) You see, on this new-fangled Otakuboy.com, I'll be
a-publishin' all this info you see here to the Web. Wow. 
It'll be sooper-dooper! Then, when the e-mail newsletters 
come out, they'll be shorter, containing only the cream! The
best o' the best. I'm out of cliches. 

   It'll all be exciting. Yeah. Fo'sho.

   What's also exciting is this super-super interview over
on SegaX with Sarah Dixon, business guru of Bizarre 
Creations. Don't know who dey be? Think F1 CHAMPIONSHIP
EDITION. Now, you remember. Welp, they're working on 
FURBALLS and METROPOLIS now. Sega X gets down to their skins
to see what makes Bizarre Creations tick!

   Hey, remember last week when ole National Console Support
did an impromptu review of the Dreamcast VGA Box? They said
like Sonic looked all cool and stuff. Well, GameSpot has

   Word is that Sega is all set to debut STRIDER 2 at the
AOU arcade show, soon. So says GameFan! Also, DEAD OR ALIVE

   WOW! a POWER STONE commercial has shown its mug on
Japanese TV! COOL! Fortunately, sites like GameFan have the
movie. Also, National Console Support has one lonely POWER
STONE pic. One sad, lonely POWER STONE pic. But do not weep
for the POWER STONE pic. He'll be happy if you go and see
him for a bit. (Hey! That rhymes!) (P.S. There's also a
MAKEN X video, but it's not a commerical. Boring, if ya ask
me.)

How else could you have fun. And, hey, while you're at SegaX,
check out these pics of SEGA RALLY 2 in network play mode.
It's sure to stun you. (Hmm.. looks like Sega Rally 2 in
regular play mode.) AND SegaX also has a list of EVERY

   Ummm... what? Is this Off-Track Betting for kiddies? Sega
Otaku profiles (in real short form, folks, not much is known
about this game) DIGITAL HORSE RACING. You see, silly me
thought you were gonna be a jockey. But nooooooooo. You get
to go to the horse track, look at the horsies stats, place
your bet, and then, when you lose, get beat up in the back
by Vinnie, to whom you promised the winnings. Be on the 
lookout for the secret mode where you get to sling bourbon
in the nearby bar. The meter off to the side indicates how
much emotional pain you've managed to dull.

arcade game HYDRO THUNDER would make its way to Dreamycast.
Well, IGNDreamcast finally got the news. Hah HAA! Anyhoo, 
they road-trip out to a local arcade and play the arcade 
game and then, in dreamy fashion, dream a little dream of 
what this game might look like when it gets to Dreamycast.

   SCORE ONE! for Connectix. You see, big, bad Sony tried
to slap a mean-old injunction on Connectix's PlayStation 
emulator. Poor Connectix. SOooo misunderstood. Anyhoo, a
judge said, "Like no way d00dz." And then pulled out a
Powerbook from under his robe WITH THE EMULATOR ON IT!!!!!
(Just kidding.) Anyway, GameFan has news about the failed
injunction AND a response from Sony.

   WOW! Are you a Mortal Kombat fan? Do you wish you could
make money from your obsession, especially after having to
spend $70.00 a month on a Prozac prescription to combat the
obsessive thoughts? Where am I going with this? I have no
clue. Anyhoo, check out this great interview with John
Tobias, Lead Designer (yes, he's made of LEAD) on MORTAL
KOMBAT: SPECIAL FORCES. (What's so special about it? It's 
just another group of people that beat another group of
people up. Oh. Well, I guess you have to read the interview

   For those of you who've played any pen-and-paper based
RPG, you know that you can get experience in all kinds of
ways. INCLUDING staying away from a fight you've no business
getting yourself into. Well, IGNPSX is surprised you can do
this in FINAL FANTASY VIII. It's part of their update on the
game which is comin' like THIS WEEK, folks! Feel the ex-
citement. And while we're on the subject of FINAL FANTASY,
check out the news on RPGamer about the upcoming FINAL 
FANTASY MOVIE. Actually, it's mostly a link to another 
story in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin. But they've got a cool

   A buncha sites report that an online store (I didn't note
which) had an upcoming game in its list called A WEEK IN 
SOUTH PARK. Sounds, cool, huh? Well, everyone reported it.
GameFan called Acclaim and they said it's been scrapped.

   Try not to pee. And while you're at it, would you please
use your farts to propel yourself into the air, please? 
Thank you. Am I NUTS?! I'll answer that question later, but

   WOW! Already! A SYPHON FILTER review. It's over on 
PlayStationFAN. (In fact, the good ole Webmaster himself
buttonholed me in ICQ to tell me that it was the BEST GAME
HE'S EVER PLAYED. Well, maybe I'm embellishing it a bit. 
But it's fun, dammit. (The game, I mean.) Also, take a

   The question is: Why is BEETLE ADVENTURE RACING an N64-

   Well, lookie what we have here. It looks like Nintendo
may sue those emulatin' d00dz that IGN64 profiled last week.
Power of the press, right? Actually Nintendo says that the
d00dz (and if you program emus, you qualify as a d00d --
zeros and all) must have cracked Nintendo's security scheme.
And that ain't too cool. Check out the story at Gaming-Age.

   Har har har! This is kinda funny. On 64 Source's Web

that Smash Brothers is comin' to U.S. N64s in April. This
