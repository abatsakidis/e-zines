                      (please do not read the following)

        Ok, well I've got to work on a lengthy essay this weekend so...

        ...no editor's note.  Sorry.

        Hey wait, that was an editor's note, wasn't it?

        In fact, so was that and so is this.  I can write anything I like
and it will still be the "editor's note."  Not bad, not bad!

        I'll have to keep this in mind...

 `q                                 by BMC                                 p'

Once upon a time there was a young ____ (boy/girl) named ______, and ___
(he/she) had _____ hair and beautiful _____ eyes and was about ____ tall
and _________________________ and oh wasn't ___ (he/she) the ____ (girl/boy)
of your dreams?  Of course ___ (he/she) was.

___ (He/She) was perfectly ideal because of ___ (his/her) tendancies to
______ like ______ and also ___________ a bit of _______.  But the thing
that really made you fall in love with ___ (him/her) was ___ (his/her)
unusual (and extremely charming) tendancy to ____________________________.
___ (He/She) was really something special.  I know that now, and if you
don't know it yet then you're missing out on the best thing that's ever
happened to you.

But here's the problem.  You are in the present while ___ (he/she) is in the
past (actually, if you ask ___ (him/her), ___ (he/she) would boldly state
that ___ (he/she) is in the present and you are in the future.  But don't
worry, because this love can transcend time).

Here comes the scary part, and I hope it's scary enough for you (while at
the same time not being too scary for you, because that would make you feel
uncomfortable and end up hating me).

One day in the (past/present) to your (present/future), an evil old _____
came calling and wanted to _____ the charming protagonist who by now every
single one of us has become madly in love with because of our.... umm, I
mean your special love for them.  Heh.

"NO!" said _____, "I'm not going to let an evil old ______ like you _______
a young protagonist like me, especially not _______!!!"  The evil old
______'s plans hadn't been so specific before, but _______'s protests had
given ______ some new (and evil evil EVIL) ideas.

________ worried that the evil old _______ would ________ and _________ and
________ and then proceed to _______ and _________ and then follow that up
with a bit more ________.

________________ ________________ ________________  (Insert artistic
metaphors and character development here)

Suddenly, the reader (YOU), felt a strong sense of sympathy for ________ and
decided to do stop being a passive reader and get involved and do
the ________ thing (which, ironically, in this case was the ________ thing)!

Once you got involved in the story, all hell broke loose and _______________
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________
_____________.

In the end, ________________________________________________________________
(order was restored and everyone learned a lot about livin and a little bout
love/the forces of evil rose and blanketed the world in a cloak of sin), and
everybody ________________ (lived happily/died in excruciating pain).

All except for ______, who will forever serve as a reminder
that ___________________________________________________________.

______________ (The End./ To Be Continued...) 

p.s. if  you find yourself not being able to fill this shit in, there's
something wrong with your imagination!  But don't worry, because I love your
sorry ass anyway, and so did _______... in ___ (his/her) own special way.

Is an exit sign an open declaration
of your right to leave at any time?
Is it a well known porthole
to escape theatres in which you may otherwise be trapped?
Does it give you the option
to rise up
and run through levered doors
into freedom. . . 
if you suddenly feel smothered or claustrophobic
due to the oppressive atmosphere of the building
in which you stiffly sit.


Does an exit sign,
hanging smugly from ceiling or mounted above door,
give you that feeling
-you can flee the constant order of the chairs so neatly lined row after row 
and dash into the streets of the city which you will soon find are no better 
because they too are cluttered with order. . . . . . .


Clinging to a wall,
does it guarantee protection
from the potential extinction of yourself
- caused by fire or other such danger -
or help YOU 
to break out of dull life that holds you to sit,
to stare blankly (yes blankly, never enthusiastically)
into grey space. . . . . . . 
Glowing, beaming - red or orange - a beacon
DOES an exit sign MEAN exit?


Or is the well known (obligatory, regulatory) sign
simply a sarcastic reminder. . .  that there is
No way out.
