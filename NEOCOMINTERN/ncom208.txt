                                EDITOR'S NOTE
                        (please DO read the following)
  
  Things just keep getting better for me every day since I took it upon
  myself to help destroy BMC and send him packing.  Life's never been better
  for ol' Cog.

  Every person I pass on the street seems to know that I, Cog, am the editor
  of this Comintern.  Just to be sure, I shout out the same at them.

  It goes a little like this:

  "I AM THE EDITOR OF THE NEO-COMINTERN ELECTRONIC MAGAZINE AND BMC IS NOT!"

  The typical reaction goes a little like this:

  "Well, it's about time!"

  It's been great.  But you know what else is great?  These next two
  articles!  Enjoy, friends.  Let's see what falls off the vine so that we
  can then create sweet, blinding Comintern Wine.

                                                                       ,o$o

  You told me that you want to be a Breeders song

  You think you're so weird that it tires me, Mr. "I'm so abstract I want to
  be a song."  I think the song was "has anyone seen the iguana" and that
  would be just like you to pick a song like that.  And then be it.  Now
  you'll probably say "that wasn't the song at all," and "you weren't even
  listening to me!"  Pout, yeah that's it, stick your bottom lip out a
  little further, a little lower.  Do I even need to roll my eyes this time
  or can you anticipate my disgust?

  Stop the car.  Just stop it.  I'll make you get out.  I'll leave you here
  on 33rd street in front of the furniture store that has the really lame
  commercials on T.V.  I'll make you walk home, you bet.

  Stupid BMC.  I sent him to England instead.  He thinks he'll get the
  better of me by leaving me stranded on 33rd.  But we'll just see him how
  long it takes to walk all the way home from London!

  tee hee

  (p.s. I miss BMC)

  strawberries are conceited    they always want you to remember them long
  after you've eaten the last one in the bowl    my mom use to sprinkle
  sugar over them until they were soaked in their own juice like blood
  strawberries are over dramatic    they like to pretend they're a
  Shakespearean tragedy     falling all over themselves with dialogue
  the seeds get stuck in my teeth for hours    i've always hated flossing

  i tell this to a friend and she thinks oranges are worse     first you
  have to peel them    work for them    they always have such tough skin,
  never open up to you   and once you have them peeled the first bite you
  take has them dripping all over your brand new suit   they're just
  screaming for attention, always wanting to be noticed     you just know
  they weren't part of the cool crowd in high school

  i've been trying to eat a lot of bananas to get more potassium    what is
  with the name banana?     such a redundant fruit and so completely absent
  minded    i have heard they are prone to alzheimer's as they  get older
  always repeating their own name, trying desperately to remember how it
  sounds, what the letters look like      banananananana

  you say apples are the most complacent fruit    never give you any
  trouble, never rocking the boat     i think you say this because they
  remind you of you     you've never looked in the fruit drawer in my fridge
  have you     full of rotting apples with big brown bruises all  over their
  shinny red peel    every suburban family buys a bag or two of apples and
  they sit so nicely in the fridge    they are the forgotten fruit    the
  exoticism left centuries ago and no one really wants them    now you can
  find them in a tree in your backyard     we have a crabapple tree in ours
  i step on sour apples on the deck every day in the fall    they squish
  between my toes    feel like mud

  i ask my mother about her favorite fruit     she mentions the pomegranate
  it surprises you, she says, when we are curled up in her bed after a night
  swim      my hair soaking my father's pillow it looks like such a simple
  fruit      but then you open it up and there are all these seeds that look
  like tiny chunks of flesh    they nestle softly inside safe little pouches
  a pomegranate has a million little secrets buried underneath its skin
