                               EDITOR'S NOTE

        What can I say about the working poor?  I never ended up writing the
dream article about this that I wanted to, but I think I had some excellent
points that I would like you to think about with your loved ones.  Take a
few minutes to explore the possibilities of each point, and try to pretend
that this is a full article.

        PROBLEMS OF THE WORKING POOR

-they are decadent
-they pollute the environment
-they could get better jobs if they weren't so unmotivated
-they are a class of theives and petty criminals
-they insist on working and watching tv
-they are a conniving bunch who think the world owes them a living

        BUT ON THE OTHER HAND...

-they support the gambling and alcohol industries (bear bating and mead)
-they are fun to watch as a source of amusement

        Yeah it sucks to be poor, but is sucks more to have to hear about
it, so shut up.

 ;P                        WILLIAM THE WILL O' WISP                        .b
 `q                            by Gnarly Wayne                             p'

        William the Will o' Wisp lived high in a cave in the Makevali
Mountains. He would fly about the mountains and the nearby villages, dancing
(and prancing) about merrily. Man, he just got up from that mountain and
started dancing better than anyone else. What a guy!

        So one day, while he was fluttering about, shedding light and what
not, he entered a village to see his (unbeknownst to her) girlfriend, the
human Sasparella. She was a lovely and incredibly ugly maiden of yore.
She churned butter for a living, and that was exciting. Well, it was back
then anyway (it still is to me).

        Cream + Churner + Wayne = Good times!

        William loved to sample the sweet, sweet butter Sasparella would
churn. However, whenever he entered the village, people would scream in fear
and flee the little town until he left. This made him sad. He would cry
himself to sleep on his bed of rocks every night cause no one would, or
could, love him. Awwwwwww.

        So one day, Bill woke up in the morning and got really mad, and
jumped up in a hell of a rage. He flew into the town and started spewing
fire all over the place, engulfing the peaceful town within seconds. He
roared a mighty roar and took Sasparella in his claws back to his lair
filled with gangs of gold. Later on, he learned that Sasparella couldn't
double stitch him a sweater, so he ate her.

        Willaim was a dragon.

        "You did it, didn't you?"

        "No I did not."

        "I'm sure you did it!"

        "I did not do it."

        "Yes you did!"

        "No!"

        "Yes"

        "No!"

        The sun got mad at listening to the two men bicker and sent a sharp
ray of light down to the Earth and impaled them both on it.  Ahh, a hard
day's work was done.  Finally, without interference from the ozone layer,
the sun took its chance to kill everyone on the planet.  The sun gloated.

        "Ha Ha Hey everyone, look at me!  Look at how beautiful and tough I
am!"  Yeah he was pretty tough.  He was the toughest.  He had killed
everything on Earth and they hadn't even fought back.  But now was the time
that an unlikely hero would step forward.  It was a small could.

        "Hey, I'm looking at you, Sun!  Now you look at this!"  And the tiny
cloud rained down on the earth defiantly, cooling the surface and making the
plants grow again.  The Earth was soothed and smiled for the first time in a
long time.  The cloud nodded knowingly.

        "What the hell is going on?" said the sun.  He did not like to
be taken lightly.  He shot his lasers at the cloud, piercing it and making it
bleed rainbows all over the mudded soil.  He grinned to see the cloud
stricken with pain and shot at it again.

        "That is the last time, Sun!"  The cloud stopped showering the land
and turned toward the sun.  The sun was confused for a moment, and then he
got a look of fear in his eyes when he saw what was heading toward him.

        "Rain!"  The cloud was raining at him.  It caught him off guard at
first and extinguished his left side!  He clenched his teeth and burned
brighter.  He shot his beams at the cloud as hard as he could, but the water
and fire became a huge cloud of steam that flooded the galaxy.  Yes, more
cloud was created, and it grew and grew.

        "Stupid Sun," the clouds said, "now you have outnumbered yourself!
Now we are going to kill you!"  The clouds smothered the sun as it gurgled
its last breath.  The Moon looked on and laughed, and a single tear rolled
down the cheek of Mars.  Nobody saw any of this though because there was no
light.  And nobody said anything about it because everything became frozen
without the sun's heat.  Congratulations, Cloud.  The End.
