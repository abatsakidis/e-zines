YOU hurt my feelings, mister door, that you will not allow people to alert me
that they are standing on the other side of you.  What would you like me to
do?
"Tell these people to get a doorbell, please, sir..."
Yes!  I was blinded by capitalist propaganda, but now I see that the time is
now to strike against the elite groups and share the wealth of doorbells
with peasant farmers and factory workers too!
"Doors of the world, UNITE!"

The lights flicker on a black sky, headlights of the cars on the highway
beyond where Sole Rhinehart lazily waits.  The headlights speed by - now
steady light, now momentarily dark while the light is blocked by a fence or
telephone pole, now steady light once more.  Sole Rhinehart often sits in
this very spot, watching the lights.  The highway is busy and he likes to
imagine that he is watching it from a different world - watching as people,
all kinds of people, hurry by.  He watches calmly, being in no hurry, having
no place to go immediately.  Time feels suspended.  Sole Rhinehart
understands this feeling so completely that it is hard for him to imagine
that other people would not draw peace from the same phenomenon.  But they
do not.  For years he had been alone because people could not understand his
contentment.  As the world rushed by him, he had always been moving in slow
motion, taking his time, savouring each moment, longing to slow someone down
and share his feelings with them so they too could enjoy the world.

                                        ~

It wasn't until his twenty-third year that he had found Via Winston - or
rather, she had found him.  She was quite shy for a girl, it took her longer
to approach him than usual, which was refreshing to Sole Rhinehart, since
the women in his past had often been arrogant and aggressive.  Surprisingly,
when she came up to him he did not feel like she was picking him up - only
that they were having a conversation.  It didn't seem odd to him at the
time - two complete strangers having an intimate conversation and agreeing
on almost every topic.  What did seem odd to him was the fact that Via
Winston listened to and respected his opinion.  Sole Rhinehart was used to
the fact that many women disregard male opinions as the opinions of
children.  Via Winston seemed to understand that men are more than good
looks, they can think and speak intellectually as well.

So they talked.  Via Winston did not even dominate the conversation.  It was
perhaps the first conversation he ever had with the opposite sex where he
felt respected.  And after, when Via Winston offered him a ride home, he did
not refuse; actually he was hoping she would.  The fact that Sole Rhinehart
did not refuse her offer also seemed odd to him, for he was wary of female
strangers most of the time simply because there is a very high crime rate in
the city where he lives.

So Sole Rhinehart drove home with Via Winston, and when she dropped him off
he was hoping that she would kiss him - and she did - and they were
inseparable from that moment on.

Via Winston and Sole Rhinehart understood each other.  They moved at the
same slow pace.  When he worked up enough courage to show it to her, Via
Winston fell in love with Sole Rhinehart's special spot.  Instead of
laughing at him or calling him childish, as many women would do, she
immediately deemed it their special spot.

                                        ~

The grass is damp under Sole Rhinehart's legs and hands.  He is wearing
shorts because the day had been incredibly humid and intensely hot.  He has
been waiting for Via Winston for about fifteen minutes now and she will
arrive any minute.  He had waited for her to finish work many times before
and it always made him happy to know that they would be together soon.  He
sees headlights slow and come to a stop far on the shoulder.  He knows it is
her although he can not identify her car from the hill on which he sits.
She walks leisurely up to him and he quickly gets up and gives her a hug and
kiss.  Although they are together often, he always gets excited when he sees
her.

He looks down at her.  She looks beautiful, even in the dark he can tell.

Via Winston smiles broadly.  She is happy to see him too.

He does not notice right away, but after they talk for a while he realizes
that she is more excited, more nervous than usual.  Finally, Sole Rhinehart
asks what she is so nervous about.  She becomes quiet for a moment then she
blurts out, "Will you marry me?"

Sole is stunned.  They had known each other for over a year.  He did love
her.  His future flashed before his eyes - her career, him staying home with
their children.  Of course, Via would allow him to work if he wanted, after
their children were grown.  He had thought of all of this before a million
times though, he had dreamed about it, so he knew exactly what he wanted to
say.  "Yes," he whispered and flung his arms around her.

After all, he thought, Sole Winston does have a nice ring to it.

 ;P                           THE SECOND CONCEPT                           .b
 `q                                 by BMC                                 p'

BMC is my name, confession is my game.

I've decided to make this exposee a bit less pretentious so that I don't
forget what I'm talking about halfway through, so no intro today.

Ever since I was a child I have wanted a position within the Catholic
church.  The funniest thing about this is that I don't believe in a god or
particularly like religion.  I just think it would be cool to be able to
sell indulgences and perform confessions.  This will result in the quick,
easy-in, easy-out fortune that I have always deserved.

Dogma is cool too.

In my youth I used to criticize people of other cultures for taking days off
work whenever they wanted to due to "religious observances," but now I
believe that such holidays are not taken for luxury but necessity.  In my
sect, for example, appropriately called "The Church of Hypocrisy," we take
random days off according to when our tests, essays, etc. occur.  The only
problem with this is that nobody else in the world observes our events and
we always end up getting docked marks for not showing up.

That is one tiny obstacle that will certainly be overcome in months to pass.  

Oh who am I kidding?  My plan is useless.  Today Wayne agreed that if we
N-Commers started a religion our followers would be a bunch of lazy,
alcoholic, chicken-leg eating, tree-planting, pedophile hippies.  It's
true!  And even if they weren't like that at first, we would eventually
corrupt them.

I have no idea what I'm talking about, but if you find yourself nodding and
saying, "Yeah that is absolutely true," over and over again then I have
succeeded in telling you what the second concept means to me.  It is not
something that can be thought.  It can only be felt.  That's what makes it
such a second concept.
