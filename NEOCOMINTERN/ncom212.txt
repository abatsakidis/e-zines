                                EDITOR'S NOTE
                      (please do not read the following)
  
  Hello, microfriends and megafriends!  This is The BMC, your pal and editor
  of The Neo-Comintern, here to welcome you back to the most wonderful,
  super-subversive socialist satire publication this side of Moonbase Luna.
  With a bit of love, tenderness, and ass-kicking, all of our most beloved
  writers have gotten together, resealed pacts of old, and organized to
  unleash many more of the kind of articles and fiction that you can only
  find within these hallowed files of text.

  Some wonder where the N has been for the past THREE MONTHS.  On the other
  side of the Styx, my friend.  The Neo-Comintern has wandered into the dark
  world, seen what it has to offer, set it on fire with some serious pyro,
  and then flown out in V formation.  Once upon a time, around issue 207,
  The Neo-Comintern needed a new editor to hold the bag, erh, lead the
  magazine into a new glorious era.  Brave writers stepped to the forefront,
  threw down the gauntlet, pledged allegiance, and promised to struggle
  valiantly to improve writing standards, expand territory, and write K-rad
  editor's notes.  With such a variety of competent and passionate geniuses
  to choose from, there was only one way that anything could possibly go
  wrong.

  A monkey wrench in the cogs.  Or, as fate did have it, a Cog in the monkey
  wrench (monkey wrench here being a metaphor for editorship of The
  Neo-Comintern Online Magazine).  Things seemed to be going quite well at
  first, as The High Cog had no shortage of high-quality articles to choose
  from.  In fact, issues 209-211 all have a whopping THREE articles in
  them.  That's a record.  In celebration, Cog killed the zine.

  When I got back from summer vacation in the village of Gotham, I found
  that Cog had pulled the plug.  I had planned on taking the editorship over
  again when I got home, but now I found that there was no zine to come back
  to.  Furthermore, in an act of brutal betrayal, Cog had changed the name
  of The Neo-Comintern to The Neo-COGmintern.  So what was I to do?

  After three months of careful plotting and meditation, I decided to bring
  the Neo-Comintern back from its early grave and release issue 212.  And so
  we begin the greatest era ever witnessed in the history of literature.
  The submissions for future issues are, at this point, the best that we
  have ever received.  Look out for hot hot hot hits from your favourite
  writers, and perhaps even a few surprises from the wonderful writing
  community of Textus, Internetia.

  This is probably our best issue yet, for the simple fact that all of the
  writers have gotten together to reveal a bit about themselves and
  entertain your sweet souls at the same time.  This is an interview issue.

  I would like you to try this.  Read this issue, read up on your favourite
  writers, get to know them, love them if you must, hate them if you wish.
  Harness the power of 100 dreams.  Build the skyrocket.  Let's make some
  friends.  Let's be trapped in an apartment.  Let's get straight As.  This
  is The Neo-Comintern.  This is solid gold in ASCII format.  This is
  something special, something to share, something to keep in a small box in
  a secret place.

  And this night, my friends, is one extremely hallowed evening.
 
  Olympia!

                                                                       ,o$o

  AE  - Ladies and gentlemen, for my first trick today, I will attempt
        something dangerous, mind-boggling and impossible for a mortal man.
        Yes, that's right, I plan on entering the world and mind of the
        notorious B.M.C., and escaping unharmed!  And now, to business.

        Well, BMC, let's kick this of with a hypothetical - if you could
        choose, where would this interview be conducted, what would you be
        wearing, and what drink would you be holding in your hand?  Oh yeah,
        and who'd be asking the questions?  Obviously, I'd be first pick,
        but if I had a better offer - Alyson Hannigan, for example - who'd
        come off the pine?

  BMC - If this interview was hypothetical, I would start off by being
        more intelligent, slick-sounding, and witty than I naturally am
        (-1).  You would be yourself too, but a couple of inches taller.  Or
        maybe you would be a ghost.  I'd be wearing my usual outfit, a white
        tuxedo, and I would be holding a jewel-encrusted cane in my right
        hand.  This would leave my left hand free to hold a kitchen glass
        filled with the dirtiest Kentucky bourbon I could find.  The
        interview would be conducted in a subway car, or maybe a Subway
        restaurant.  I think that would be the ideal scenario, or at least
        pretty close to it.

  AE  - You've confirmed my previous opinion that you're quite the stylish
        character.  Do you feel like you act as a role model to your
        contemporaries?  Would you in fact encourage them to perceive you in
        that light?  On a personal level, I can affirm that you have been a
        positive influence in my life.  I would even go so far as to say
        that on occasion, you have been the candle guiding me through the
        night.  Does this disturb you?

  BMC - It always feels good to be told that I am a positive influence,
        especially when just a few years ago I was an unerringly negative
        person.  I liked to binge drink, be rude and pushy, and generally
        not take anyone else's feelings into consideration.  Thinking back
        on my past, I see all kinds of misogynist, racist, homophobic,
        anthropocentric, inhumane, and other uncompassionate undertones that
        were integrated into my thoughts and language without my
        realization.  As much as I hate all of my past incarnations, life
        has proven to me to be a useful demonstration of how I can improve
        myself in increments if I struggle against ignorance and sincerely
        try to be less selfish.  I'm not claiming that the way I am now is
        an end-result, either.  I'm fully aware that I am full of
        philosophical flaws, a great deal of which I hope to identify and
        eliminate over the course of my lifetime.

        As far as the combination of writing and positive attitude go, I
        have to admit that I don't know the answers.  I just try to do my
        best not to be unintentionally ignorant.  Intentional ignorance can
        be funny when readers identify it as satire, but otherwise it just
        upsets people who do not detect the irony.  When Komrade B died we
        released two special issues.  In the first tribute issue we released
        an obituary that was written in a completely serious tone and then
        followed it  up with a second article making fun of Komrade B and
        claiming that we murdered him.  People didn't think it was funny,
        and the issue probably earned more hate mail than any other.  An
        ex-girlfriend e-mailed me after she read it just to tell me she
        hated me.  The next week, we released a second tribute issue with
        more jabs at the life, death, and virility of the B.  I've strayed
        from the point, but I think I was going to say that if you are going
        to write an article, you have to know what you are talking about.
        Even when you're writing satire, your ignorance needs to be
        rooted in intelligence.

        As for whether or not I would call myself a role model or expect
        others to see me as one, I try not to worry too much about what
        readers think of me on a personal level.  I only care about what the
        reader gets out of the things I write and publish.  I do want to
        promote certain things.  I think that independent media, education,
        and a lifestyle based on compassion are all steps toward a better
        world.  I want to help the community by helping these causes.  But
        as for the way others perceive me, I feel ok with leaving that up to
        them.  I'm not trying to live up to any particular image.  In fact,
        this question makes me wonder if my writing voice seems a bit
        incomprehensible since I often adopt varying personas for different
        articles/stories.  Maybe that's the most accurate representation of
        a person - one who is always changing and whose moods and attitudes
        fluctuate.  I don't know.  I just try to be natural.

        As for being the candle in your life, I'm honoured.  Maybe Elton
        John will write a special song for me.  He hasn't released a new
        version of the song he wrote for Marilyn Monroe for a few years now.
        It seems to me I live my life like a candle in the wind.  I detest
        Elton John and that song(s).

  AE  - Hmm. So you feel that your writing is a form of community service?
        That through your writing, you can highlight things that may be
        important in benefiting society?  History shows us the one man can
        change the world; do you believe are one such man?  Or was your
        point that my question was stupid?

  BMC - I don't think your question was stupid.  Some wise person once told
        me there's no such thing as a stupid question.  I don't personally
        believe it, but nonetheless, you're doing ok.

        As for one person changing the world (note that I didn't say "man"
        because I believe that non-men can also make differences in the
        world), I do think that it can be done.  I believe that everyone can
        change the world.  What's more, I believe that everyone does change
        the world.  We all do our own things, we all have our spheres of
        influence, we all make a degree of change - even if that change is
        only within ourselves.

        Like, for example, do you recycle or not?  If you change your mind
        on that issue, you are making a difference.  I think those people
        who seem to change the world on their own are for the most part just
        agreeing with things that are socially popular and then adding a few
        ideas of their own.  1917, for example.

        Lenin didn't create revolution.  People hated feudalism, hated the
        war, hated being peasants, so Lenin simply organized the
        revolution.  I think organizers are important.  I think it's
        important to get ideas straight.  That can be a way in which writing
        is useful.

        But really, I don't consider my writing to be politically oriented
        enough to be the next Marx or Lenin.  I also don't think one person
        can single-handedly change the world.  But we all can do something,
        and that's what I'm trying to do.

  AE  - You previously mentioned Elton John.  Actually, Elton John is my
        three thousand, four hundred and fifty-first favourite performer,
        coming in behind the likes of the Standard Model, Psychotic Banana
        Combine Harvesters, and Sonz of Prozac.  Can you tell me something
        about life as a rap star?

  BMC - I've been rapping for over 4 years now, and you must the first
        person, besides myself, to call me a rap star.  I always fancied
        myself a rapper in high school, even though I couldn't afford a mic
        or any recording equipment.  It was pretty pathetic, but still,
        people would call me Boss or Boss M.C., and that was good enough
        for me.  I ended up writing 5 or 6 songs, but without recording
        equipment it just fizzled out.

        In 1998, Gnarly Wayne and I heard some mp3s of some 12 year old kid
        rapping over MIDIs.  He called himself Prozac.  Deciding that this
        was the worst music ever recorded, we were first humiliated to be
        human beings, but then intrigued by this terrible terrible music.
        Realizing that we could also rap over MIDIs, we formed a parody
        group called Sons of Prozac.

        We recorded 8 songs over MIDI and actually started gaining some
        popularity.  We went to play a show in Edmonton, but by the time we
        were supposed to go on, Gnarly Wayne was tired and didn't want to go
        rap anymore.  Around this time we started recording stuff on music
        other than MIDI.  We recorded The Blair Witch Project, a song that
        went up to #8 on the mp3.com rap charts.  We did about 40 songs in
        total as the SoP.  We wouldn't practice, and then we'd use the first
        vocal take where we got all the way through the lyrics, no matter
        how bad it sounded.  That's why we have some verses where we're
        laughing through the whole thing and we kept them anyway because the
        flow was tight.

        Gnarly Wayne and I got to rap with some of mp3 rap's superstars.
        Pimp Daddy Welfare, John Cocaine, Scrilla Tee, Schukey, T-Nasty, The
        White Mystery, DollaZ, and of course any friend of ours that wanted
        to appear on a SoP track.  Cog, Komrade B, i like trees, and
        McPhisto were just a few of these folks.  It was always fun for me,
        right until the point where we jammed up in the middle of "Around
        the Wayne Girl" and "AG&G" in 2000.  That was about the end of the
        SoP.  We recorded a couple more songs together, but most of what I
        did after that was in other projects.

        Since then I've guested on a half dozen tracks, and in 2001 I
        co-founded a G-rated, family rap group called The Sunshine Squad.
        In the SS I rap as MC Friend, along with my homies J-Hugs, Ladybug,
        and Joey the Unicorn.  Joey has recently gone AWOL, so we're looking
        for a new fourth.  Our first track, "Be Nice," took about a year in
        production, and our current song, "Read Books" is about half done.
        These days I rap as a hobby - but I'll still rap ya socks off.

        At the height of popularity, being a rapper was really cool.  But
        the more I did in that area, the more other areas of my life got
        ignored.  It's always good to have side projects to fuck around
        with; that keeps you well-oiled for the main projects.  When the
        side projects start becoming main projects, that's when you're
        living in a world of illusion.  That's what being a rap star is
        like.

  AE  - You probably don't really have much time for side projects, do you?
        I mean, not only are you the public face of the Neo-Comintern, but
        you manage to release regularly AND frequently(!!).  On top of that,
        you've taken over from Mogel as the KING OF TEXT and you spend quite
        a large amount of time looking after, encouraging and cajoling your
        devoted subjects.  I know you're also a tertiary student and you've
        been described as the greatest pilot in the universe.  What else can
        you do?  What else DO you do?  Are you a masterful pianist, or a
        talented hockey player, or a drug runner for the Sicilian Mafia?

  BMC - What else do I do? Well firstly I would like to mention that the
        Neo-Comintern has not been releasing regularly for awhile.  I mean,
        this whole summer has left me without computer and it's making it
        quite hard for me to get anything worthwhile done.  I'm typing to
        you from a computer lab in Fredericton, New Brunswick, where I am
        told I live now.  Heckat and I are sleeping on an air mattress at
        nights and we're hoping that it takes less than another week for our
        furniture to arrive.

        As for this "king of text" comment, I don't know if any such thing
        exists.  While working with the Current Text Scene website I have
        considered myself to be more of an administrator and facilitator
        than a king.  But then again, I've always considered it to be more
        of a text community than a text hierarchy.  But sure, "king" sounds
        cool.  Who am I kidding?  Being a king is great.  But really, at
        this time linear is the main administrator/organizer of The Current
        Text Scene, so that makes me more like a counselor, or perhaps it
        makes linear like the REGENT OF TEXT.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure
        about anything anymore.

        As for being a student, I'm starting classes today (Sept 9th, 2002)
        at the University of New Brunswick.  I've already been to my Intro
        to Latin class, and in 18 minutes I will be sitting squarely in my
        Canadian Novel class.  I'm taking five classes this term, and I'm
        also hoping to play a part in the editing of UNB's student literary
        magazine, QWERTY (like the keyboard, get it?)!

        As far as being the greatest pilot in the universe, if you mean
        flying an aeroplane then you are misinformed.  However, if you mean
        a pilot of the imagination, destination: inner space, you are
        absolutely correct and wonderfully flattering.

        Other projects for me?  I just finished recording the base tracks
        for a radio play with Melatonin before I left Saskatoon.  It's
        called "The Joel And Jared Show", and I'll try to have it done as
        soon as possible.  I'm also a member of positive-message rap group
        The Sunshine Squad.  I hip and hop as rapper MC Friend, encouraging
        the young people of the world to do things like "Be Nice" and
        "Read Books".  Other than writing, rapping, talking, administrating,
        and being a student, I am also proficient in blowing up air
        mattresses in the middle of the night and walking for several hours
        per day (time permitting).  I've been thinking of hosting a radio
        show on the campus  station.  It would be an old-school hip-hop/rap
        show, and from time-to-time it would feature groundbreaking radio
        plays written by and featuring me.  But then again, I don't know if
        I have the time for another project right now.  I'll probably be
        spending the next month or two just trying to get the apartment in
        decent shape.  Our place is 10 metres away from the world's longest
        walking bridge.  Isn't that cool?  Come and visit us whenever you
        like.

  AE  - Well, then, maybe I will visit New Brunswick sometime.  I was almost
        Canadian, you know, and recently I've been thinking about studying
        abroad.  I gotta confess, though, I don't really know much about
        Canada.  (New Brunswick is in Canada, right?)  I'm not sure I even
        know any Canadian novelists.  Who might I have heard of?  Of course,
        you've probably never heard of any Australian authors, have you?

  BMC - Yes, by all means, it's not a bad place to stay.  Our couch might
        not be the most comfortable, but you can always buy us a futon if
        you really want to.  Actually, the couch isn't all that bad.  It's
        better than the air mattress that Heckat and I were sleeping on for
        the first couple of weeks.  Especially on the last night, when the
        cat decided it would be a good idea to punch a bunch of holes in
        it.  It's a weird feeling, to be sleeping on an uninflated air
        mattress.  You're just going through the motions, you know?  The air
        mattress isn't really doing you any good, but to lay on the floor
        would be a type of defeat that would be too depressing to sleep
        through.  So you just lay on this rubber sheet and lie to yourself.

        I didn't know that you were almost Canadian.  I was almost Canadian
        too, but I was born in Saskatchewan.  I didn't find out until later
        years that Canada really only includes Ontario and Quebec.  I think
        that the people of B.C. and Alberta are also on the verge of being
        recognized as legitimate Canadian citizens.  I'm not sure if New
        Brunswick is in Canada.  I think the coins here are the same as the
        ones in Saskatchewan.  I'm not sure if that means anything, though.

        All this talk of Canadian and Australian authors is maddening to me.
        No, I've never heard of any Canadian novelists.  None from Australia
        either.  Robert Drewe?  Randolph Stowe?  Peter Carey?  I'd be lying
        if I said I knew who these authors were.  And I'd be lying if I said
        I'd heard of Mordecai Richler, Margaret Atwood, Guy Vanderhaeghe, or
        W.O. Mitchell.  I just looked all of these names up on the internet.
        I know nothing about novelists.  I have nothing against the novel as
        a genre, but I would never read one for pleasure or delight.  Maybe
        they will interest me someday, but for now I prefer short fiction
        and the creative article.  I think that a novel often requires more
        time than I can afford, and tries to sustain my emotional investment
        for too long.  I am a busy and fickle person.  And lazy.  And
        stupid.  But seriously, another thing about the novel that doesn't
        quite work for me is that works of that genre are often too firmly
        rooted in realism.  I like writing that is more experimental, and
        that wacky slackiness is more commonly a trait of shorter works.
        Like the stuff in your zine, for example.  You're Australian, and
        I've heard of you.  I've  also heard of Aerialisticish and Abyss.

        So do I really need to know any more?  You don't have to answer if
        you think it might hurt my feelings.

  AE  - By the way, how long is the world's longest walking bridge?

  BMC - 581 metres, I've been told.  I've never checked it myself, but I
        think the measurement is more or less accurate.

  AE  - OK.  Getting back to, well, me, I should inform you that you've just
        named three of Australia's finest writers.  What is your opinion of
        CLiT, by the way?  Other than that we seem a bit slack.  Obviously,
        we tried as hard as possible to copy the Neo-Comintern without
        making it look like we were copying the Neo-Comintern.  Hmm.  And
        while I'm still talking about me, let me ask you: who was around
        making neither love nor war, but text, way back in February, 1998?

  BMC - I always enjoy most of CliT.  My favourite part is when you print my
        poem and then in the next issue you do your own version of it three
        times over, but do it in a more original and more good way.  It
        really blows me out of the water.  Great job of shattering my
        self-esteem.  But seriously, I loved it when you did that.  As far
        as the CLiT being a copy of The N-Com, I never really noticed that.
        I mean CLiT is funny, and interesting, and there are a variety of
        writers who have their own loveable styles and voices, so I think
        those are at least three ways in which it is completely different
        from The Neo-Comintern.  CLiT and The N-Com are both zines, they
        both are in text format, they both have editors with egos and
        oft-broken hearts.  So they're not unlike any other zines, really.
        But hey, if you want to give The N-Com credit for something, that's
        fine by me.

        Who was making text in 98?  Well there were other text zines in
        operation, but I never read much of them around that time.  I liked
        HOE and Texas Chainsaw Magazine back in 1995.  In 2000 I became
        involved with the textfile community.  During that 5-year gap, I
        have no idea what happened.  Zines were being made, suckas was
        getting sprayed - in other words we were getting paid.  But I can
        speak for myself, Komrade B, Gnarly Wayne, and Cog when I say that 4
        of the finest sons of text were working day in and day out to create
        something that, like vintage wine, got sweeter with age.  Or is it
        better?  I don't know.  I can't afford wine.

  AE  - You seem to mention Saskatchewan quite frequently in your writing,
        and your mention of Canadian author W.O. Mitchell leads me to ask
        this next question.  Would you mind telling us something about your
        childhood, a brief yet tragic glimpse of which has been seen in
        Installment One of the Neo-Comintern magazine?

  BMC - Do I mention Saskatchewan frequently?  I never really noticed that.
        I did notice that I've been mentioning Fredericton in
        recently-written articles, but I thought that was novelty.  OK, I
        admit it, I loved living in Saskatchewan, except for the evil
        politics of the right wing government which is actually the furthest
        supposedly-left-wing party in the province.  That's bullshit.
        Regressive tax cuts ain't shit.  That anger is what inspired the
        Weekly Capitalist a couple of years ago.  But yeah, Saskatchewan is
        tha bomb in many ways.  Nice and dry.  But then again, I haven't
        gotten nosebleeds since I got to Fredericton.  Not that I got them
        in Saskatchewan either, but...

        My childhood.  I actually did wear the plastic label from a 5-Star
        Whisky bottle as a sheriff's badge when I was in grade 2 or so.  I
        also had a bottle cap collection consisting mostly of Boh, Colt 45,
        and Pilsner.  I remember sitting in a box while looking at a picture
        of myself sitting in that same box, and thinking that I had entered
        some kind of infinite loop.  That was at about age 3 - the first
        time my mind was totally fucking blown.  I think that's about it.
        That stuff and then I was working on the N-Com.  I think there are
        more gaps in my biography than there are parts that actually exist.
        All of the times I took a shower just seem to combine into one
        lifelong shower image now, so there's about a full year that was
        meaningless.  And 2 years talking on the phone as a teenager.
        I hate phones.  And showers.

  AE  - How was the Neo-Comintern born?  Or would it be more correct if I
        queried the beginnings of the original Comintern?  I know that with
        CLiT, it was a little strange because none of my friends even knew
        about the existence of textfiles, and by 2000, `the scene' had
        probably seen better times.  Did you experience the same sort of
        thing?  Or were there other Canadian zine-sters you were associated
        with?

  BMC - The original Comintern was the 3rd International, the Communist
        International, or the Comintern.  It was a soviet project launched
        in 1919 to spread positive communist vibes around the world.  Then
        in 1995 there was a new Comintern - our Comintern.  I wrote the
        first article while sitting in my grade 11 math class.  It was just
        a little blurb about the mistrust that our society has of the words
        communism and socialism, and how that mistrust is based on
        brainwashing, specifically by the capitalist media.  It's strange.
        There are plenty of people that hear the word communist and
        associate it with the bogeyman.  So I figured if there was one thing
        I could do in the world, it would be to educate people on the
        topic.  The only thing I hadn't taken into consideration was
        educating myself first.  So the result is a few articles that have a
        lot of heart in them but are underdeveloped and not really worth the
        read.  I'm embarassed to look back on those first few writings now,
        but I'm glad that I once wrote them, because they led the way for
        the situation that I am currently appreciating.

        The 1995 zine was put together so that I could spread my message as
        far and wide as could be done via BBS distribution.  I think there
        were 3 or 4 BBSes in the city who carried the Comintern, resulting
        in a readership of 30 or so per issue.  And dammit, that was good
        enough for me.  So I kept writing and putting them up on the
        internet.  Then a few contributors came along, and eventually
        Komrade B joined in and sunk the boat.  No, he didn't.  I'm kidding.
        Actually there were a few things.  Personal problems, etc.  But we
        blasted out 15 issues in 2 or 3 months.  We were hot.  And then
        it was over.  And then 3 years later it wasn't over anymore.  And 4
        years after that, it's still not over.

        I think that Gnarly Wayne, Cog and I were all readers of text.
        There was a local BBS that brought a bunch of texts in from across
        North America.  We got to read lots of the greats.  But when we got
        going again in 1998, we weren't aware that there were any text zines
        around anymore.  We did have mentors in the independent writing
        world, absurdist writers from a zine called Y'Know, Incorporated
        Press <www.yip.org>.  But as for the text scene, I must say that
        when the N-Com started up I had no idea that there were other text
        zines.  I didn't really care.  Then one day I saw the Current Text
        Scene page, was surprised, and sent Mogel a line asking him where he
        got off not having the N-Com up on the site.  He was also surprised
        to find out there was a zine with 100 issues that he had never heard
        of.  A meeting of the obscure was happening.  And now I am an
        advocate for text zines.  Free press, unlimited distribution, no
        censorship or sponsorship.  What could be better?

  AE  - I know what could be better!  Any chance that I could find out just
        how bad the first issue of the Neo-Comintern was?  Was an original
        copy kept, or do the articles `The Working Class' and `Equality for
        All' live on only in the minds of yourself and Komrade B?

  BMC - What was the first issue of The Neo-Comintern is still online.
        Issue 3 was actually the first issue we wrote, and then we lost the
        articles, only to find them again after releasing 2 more issues.
        Issue 1 was pretty half-hearted.  We just sat down and started
        typing with no intention or purpose.  So it turned out pretty
        meaningless and disappointing.  But what was intended to be issue #1
        is still up there, and I would suggest that you read it.
        <http://www.neo-comintern.com/archives/ncom003.txt> But as for
        ncom001.txt, that has long been erased and destroyed.  Of course,
        every N-Com writer probably has a copy of the issue on their hard
        drive, but that's pretty much off limits unless you are a hacker
        supreme.  But trust me, you don't really want to read it.  It's
        mostly about orcs and bugbears and how they are to be the champions
        of a new era of global socialism.

        I've always been jealous of zines that have a really good first
        issue.  Do you think it would be a good idea to make a new first
        issue?  I kind of like that idea.  Maybe all of the writers could
        talk about video games and monsters.  Pretend we're still living
        in that era.  That might be fun.  What do you think?

  AE  - That's cheating!  Sometimes I surf back through the extensive CLiT
        episode catalogue, and some of the stuff seriously makes me cringe.
        And besides, I LIKE those first issues of the N-Com.

  BMC - Searching through old N-Com issues makes me cringe too.  Like,
        issues 1-200.  But seriously, there are many things I've written and
        look back at, wondering "Hey, why did I ever put that in there?"
        Sometimes I feel like printing something that's not quite as good as
        it should be, just because the zine needs an article or because I
        owe someone a favour or because I really want one of my own articles
        to be good so badly that I convince myself that it is even though it
        is not.  Those are the worst, because I look back on them a year or
        two later and feel stupid, not just because I wrote something boring
        or sloppy, but because I fooled myself into believing that it was
        good enough.  The N-Com audience deserves better than that.  So I
        try to be honest with myself about what is better and what is worse.

        The print issues of The N-Com consist of the best of the online
        magazine, revised and edited once more, just to slick em up that
        much more.  So everything in there has been edited at least 3 or 4
        times, and most of the articles by those writers who are most
        concerned with quality have been looked at to see if anything can be
        changed, added, or subtracted to make it better. Some people don't
        want to revise their articles because they are convinced that they
        are fine as they are, and if their artistic vision has been met, I
        leave that to them.  But one advantage the print issues have is that
        they are released two years after the original writing of the
        articles.  So no matter what makes it to the online magazine, we
        have two years to distance ourselves from the writing a bit and take
        a more objective look at it.  If the print zine succeeds, I consider
        those all to be contributing factors.

        I'm working on issue 7 right now, and for this issue I am drawing
        articles from online issues 126-150.  "Planette" will be in this
        issue, and if you recall, it was Heckat's first article in the
        N-Com, back in 130.  It's weird, because it feels like we're writing
        and publishing online in one timeline, and releasing print issues in
        another parallel timeline.  But my point was... oh yes, while I
        might be ashamed of a few things that have been in the online
        magazine, the print magazine has the benefits of time, objectivity,
        selection, and revision.  So I would say that I stand by pretty much
        everything that has appeared in print, with the possible exceptions
        of some of the editor's notes (issue 3) and some of the articles
        (Voyage to Atlantis, Issue 2).

  AE  - Here's something I've always been curious about: What's it like
        living next door to America?  Is she the next-door neighbour from
        hell, or is she the affluent charmer that brings you round a baked
        cake and some fresh fruit every so often?

  BMC - Oh boy, the eternal question.  How does the slave regard the
        plantation owner?  It's hard to say.  People in different parts of
        Canada have different opinions of North American politics.  Some
        people, particularly those in Alberta and Ontario (the industrial
        centres), have a "Bring it on! We can be right-wing too!" attitude.
        Saskatchewan and Manitoba are the prairie provinces.  Some people
        there feel resentment toward the USA because they see it as a threat
        to their way of life and, being the underdogs of Canada, with no say
        in federal politics, they feel they can do nothing but watch it
        happen.  This creates frustration in some and apathy in others.  In
        Quebec the Francophones don't want to be influenced by
        Anglo-Canadian culture, let alone Anglo culture of the American
        variety.  Here in New Brunswick it's hard to say.  I'm new here, and
        most of the people I've met are from other provinces.  I think
        people here are nice.  They're friendly.  There are maple leaves
        here, unlike in Saskatoon where there are none.  I'd always thought
        that the maple leaf was a thing that was made up, simply invented
        for the Canadian flag.  Now I've seen a maple leaf and I know
        they're real.  Now I know I live in Canada.  Yeah, Capitalism,
        American Manifest Destiny, and Globalization are all things that I
        hate that seem to have home bases in the USA, but that's an easy
        target.  Everyone knows American policy is about global domination
        under a capitalist regime, and everyone hates it.

        I think all you need is a conscience to know that it is wrong to
        exploit people in order to live luxuriously on the fruits of their
        labour.  But I haven't thought about it for a long time.

        I also think there is a problem with anthropomorphizing America.  It
        makes it seem like American policy is representative of the desires
        of the American people.  We all know that the capitalist nations
        such as the USA and Canada are geared to satisfying corporate
        interests, not the interests of the citizens.  So just to make it
        clear, it is American policy that I despise, not American citizens.
        I care about people, I care about people in every country.  That is
        why I am opposed to violence and oppression.  But by the same note I
        am also opposed to the violent and the oppressors.  So I am against
        capitalist and imperialist nations.  In other words, I am disturbed
        by American policies insofar that they are not in the best interests
        of the people of the world, but I think that Canadian policies are
        faulty in their lack of concern for common people, and, in fact,
        their desire to exploit them.

  AE  - So what's the point?  All we need is a conscience - but exploitation
        and indifference to it remains, and grows.  We're destroying the
        Earth, war is everywhere, and sooper doopers no longer cost 15c at
        the canteen.  In Catch-22, Yossarian said that if everyone felt one
        way, then he'd be a damn fool to feel any other way.  Is it time to
        give up, get high, and sleep with the best friend's lady friend?

  BMC - What's the point, you ask?  Well it depends what you're talking
        about.  If you're talking about a pencil, I would say the point is
        the lead.  If you're talking about one of the N-Com writers, I'd say
        the point is on the top of their head.  If you're talking about
        life, I'd say that we all have to create our own objectives in order
        to give purpose to our lives.  If you're talking about the point of
        compassion, caring, social consciousness, I'd say the bettering of
        the state of affairs in the world and the benefit of the world and
        the life on it.  If a person considers none of this to be important,
        they are doomed to find meaningfulness only within the scope of
        their own lonely thoughts.

        Indifference does exist in this world, but we must choose whether
        to personally adopt it or not.  But I think there is a very simple
        equation; conscience plus strength equals passion.  That's all there
        is to it.  If you have no conscience, you have no concern for the
        good of the world.  If you are depressed or lack the confidence that
        your actions are meaningful, your weakness prevents you from
        following your conscience.  And you can deceive yourself, tell
        yourself that these things aren't important, just to get yourself
        off the hook from thinking about them or doing anything about them.

        Seriously, how hard is it not to waste things?  Anyone with self-
        control can do that.  How hard is it to care about other people?
        Anyone with a shred of self-confidence can do that.  So do something
        about it.  Live the life.  Let people know what you think, inform
        people, build solidarity.  Community is important.  Do all of that
        stuff, and devote some energy to it.  And if you're not doing
        anything positive, at least try not to do anything negative.
        Hurting, wasting, exploiting, taking up too much space.  If you
        can't affect things for the better then wonder why you're affecting
        them at all.  There is no justification for apathy.

        At the same time, there's nothing wrong with occasionally relaxing,
        taking out the hash pipe, making some sweet love, and shelling out
        30p for some candy corn.  Relaxing is a good way to replenish your
        energy.

        But there are lots of people who care about making a difference.
        They're regular people, common people.  When media and government
        are ruled by corporate interests, we don't get a very good idea
        about what kind of real people there in the world, doing good
        things.  Find out about them.  Let them know about you.  Share your
        ideas.  Write a zine.  Write something for the Neo-Comintern.

  AE  - Well, Sir BMC, you've greatly restored my faith in humankind.  I no
        longer believe that we'll all be dead within the next two years.
        Maybe I'll even have a kid one day, a little boy named Joel.  He
        will be a wise king, and beloved by many.  On that note, where do
        you see yourself in ten years?  Twenty years?  Fifty years?  What
        does the future hold for the BMC?  Do you worry about what's to
        come, not just for yourself, but for society in general?  And I'm
        sure you've already thought about it, so maybe you could tell us
        where I'm headed.  I'm a bit unsure whether I want to be an
        international rock star or Mr. Britney Spears.

  BMC - Well it's good to know that I'm of some use to somebody.  You just
        keep that chin up!

        What will I be doing in the future?  Good question.  I'm not sure
        how I define my future.  If I'm still working on the N-Com in 10
        years, we'll be at around issue 700.  If not, I'll be doing
        something else.  In 20 years I hope to still be writing, but to be
        better at it.  In fifty years?  I'm not sure how long my life
        expectancy should be.  75?  I'll never make it.  Other than writing,
        I'm prepared to accept a variety of possible outcomes.  I'd like to
        get a digree in Englitch with an MA in creative writing and a PhD
        in early modern English publishing.  I'll probably be with Heckat,
        unless linear ends up stealing her from me.

        And you?  You'll probably wind up sleeping on our couch and
        pretending to look for a job.  Either that or getting trapped in
        stasis for three million years.

        And society in general?  I hope to see a more egalitarian society
        where education is free and animals are safe from molestation and
        slaughter.  And, of course, more N-Com readers.  Like, at least 10
        more.

  AE  - Do you believe in marriage?  What about kids?  When I'm feeling a
        touch cynical, I'll argue that people who have kids are
        irresponsible and selfish.  Any ideas?  I know you're with Heckat at
        the moment, but if the pictures on the internet are true, you're a
        bit of a ladies man, aren't you (possibly a porn star)?

  BMC - I believe that marriage and children exist.  I'm not sure how I feel
        about them, though.

        I know that I wouldn't want to stay in a relationship that wasn't
        working just because of a legal bond.  Legal bonds are for leases
        and insurance claims and all of those other unpleasant things.  You
        should be with someone because you love them and because the
        relationship is mutually beneficial; if the relationship falls apart
        it shouldn't be forcefully held together by some artificial outside
        force.  If nobody ever got married, nobody would ever get divorced
        either.  It just doesn't seem natural to tie yourself to another
        person for the rest of your life and commit to stick with them, even
        if circumstances change for the worse.  If a relationship stays
        together, it should be due to love, concern, and effort -- not just
        a contractual obligation.  But some people like it.  Some people,
        like ada's parents, have been married for a long time and get along
        with each other.  That's cool.  But at the same time, I'm sure they
        don't have to constantly remind each other of the contract.  I have
        a feeling they'd be together whether they were married or not.

        I also have a problem with marriage in that it seems to be a
        heterosexuals-only club.  Not fair.  I mean things are changing to
        allow for the legal recognition of homosexual marriages, but it all
        makes me wonder why we as a society are so hung up on marriage.
        It's all based on ancient cult ceremonies where a woman is
        transferred from her father's possession to her husband's.  It's all
        about ownership, possession, and all that stuff.  I'm not sure how I
        feel about that.  It seems a bit oppressive.

        Children.  They're cute.  But there's an overpopulation problem.  We
        need to either stop having so many children or come up with a new
        way of feeding the world.  There is widespread famine already, and
        we're just adding to it.  That doesn't seem very responsible.  If we
        stopped feeding grain to animals and then killing them and eating
        them, we could feed a lot more people with the grain than with the
        cow.  So why not do that?  Cause we fuckin feel like it, I guess.
        But still, we need to come up with some solutions for famine, and
        the key to this problem will be to purge ourselves of our own greed
        and decadence.

        And now straight from this into the "ladies' man" allegations.  I'm
        not sure how to answer this.  Sure I've gone on a couple of dates
        before.  I'm not sure what pictures you're talking about, but I'm
        sure that at least half of them are doctored.  I'm sure you've read
        a few of my articles about the pain of rejection, but right now I
        only know about the prosperity that can come with an honest
        relationship.

  AE  - Will we ever recapture the golden days of TEOS, where you were a
        hotshot pilot and a fearless leader ("What a guy!"), and I was a
        competant sidekick, adventurer and sex machine (A guy can always
        dream, right?)?

  BMC - I remember we liked the game TEOS so much that from December 4th,
        2000 to August 22nd, 2001, we released 75 issues of an ezine called
        "TEOS weekly," which talked about the strategies, mysteries, and
        tall tall tales of "TEOS".  TEOS, or The Exploration of Space, was a
        terribly brilliant game that drew in some of the greatest minds of
        the new millennium.

        Hmm.  I think the last time you talked to me about TEOS was when you
        asked  me if I wanted to write another "TEOS weekly" article for a
        special CLiT TEOS-weekly-reunion-issue.  The next day I sent you
        3000 words of my thoughts on TEOS and all I ever learned from it.  I
        never heard anything from you again.  What happened to that?

  AE  - Hey, who's interviewing who, here?  It's still happening,
        in my mind, anyway.  Stick around, brother.  TEOS was great, though,
        wasn't it?  I should thank you, for introducing me to TEOS, and also
        for publishing some of my stuff in the N-Com, and your encouragement
        of CLiT.  Does this sound like a wrap-up?  I think so.  Any final
        words of inspiration for your people, BMC?  Something sure to bring
        a tear person's eye and a song to their heart?  Something witty yet
        information?  Something I could get shaved into the back of my head?

  BMC - I think you're interviewing me.  I'm not sure anymore.

        As far as your Neo-Comintern submissions go, I am pleased with all
        of them and I am honoured that you have been interested in being
        published in the zine.  I hope to publish many more of your stories
        and articles in the future.  The Neo-Comintern has been very lucky
        in that the contributions have always been top-notch, edgy,
        inspired, and energetic.  It's that kind of stuff that makes for
        good zines.

        Final words of inspiration for my people?  I guess that depends on
        who my people are.  But since they're my people, I'd just like to
        say, "Thank you for being my people."

        A tear to a person's eye?  ada has been here visiting Heckat and I
        in Fredericton, but she's leaving today.

        A song to the heart?  Joe Blades and Ian LeTourneau have been kind
        enough to invite Heckat and I to be on their radio show on November
        12th.  The University of New Brunswick's student newspaper, The
        Brunswickan, will also be publishing an article about The
        Neo-Comintern and Backyard Ashes.  Issue 7 of The Neo-Comintern
        Print Magazine is in the works and should be out this winter break.
        So there is lots of good Neo-Comintern news for the near future.

        Witty yet information?  When speaking Latin, "Scribo ergo sum"
        means "I write, therefore I am."

        Something to get shaved into the back of your head? "N-Com #212,"
        or, "r.i.p. TRIPE."

  AE  - It's been a pleasure, Mr. BMC.  I've gained valuable insight into
        your psyche and I'm sure this will be advantageous to me when we're
        vying for control of the multiverse (or when we play chess,
        whichever is sooner).  I'd love to stay longer, but as one Latin man
        to another: cum homine de cane debeo congredi.  Die dulci fruere!

                                                                       ,o$o

  BMC   - Hey aster, how are bobby and suzy?

  aster - BOB AND SUZY ARE DEAD

          YOU ARE MEAN

  BMC   - I'm sorry.  Are you ok?

  aster - THEYVE BEEN DEAD FOR YEARS

          YOU SUCK

  BMC   - Please forgive me.  Let's try some more questions and answers.
          I'll give you a list of words, and I'd like you to tell me which
          you like and which you do not like, saying a few words about
          each.

          hroses - 
          timmy -
          joe - 
          flowers - 
          OrangeBird -
          BadPeople - 
          GoodPeople - 
          the sun - 
          bots - 

  aster - youre evil!!  why do you have to say words that hurt me?

  BMC   - OK, let's try another angle.  How long have you been writing, and
          what zines and projects have you been involved with?

  aster - ive been writing for ezines since late 1997.  when i turned
          three.  ive written in soe, hoe, dto, anada, and a bunch of
          others.  like yours.  and mine.  yeah.  flam was started in the
          spring of 98 as a school project.

  BMC   - What were the guidelines for the project?

  aster - we had to make websites.  they had to include certain easy things
          like pictures and inside and outside links and colors and stuff
          like that.  i was in 8th grade.  most of the projects didnt
          actually get put on the web but i put mine on geocities because it
          was a real thing.  a lot of kids cheated and used word to
          fabricate the HTML for them or something.

  BMC   - How many issues of FLAM did you create as part of the project, and
          what kind of grade did you get on it?

  aster - only the first four or five issues were during the project.  we
          didnt really get much of a grade since i went to a weird private
          school that didnt really give grades at the time.
 
  BMC   - How do you feel after you write a new article?

  aster - like i felt before i wrote it.

  BMC   - Well then maybe I should be asking you how you feel before you
          write an article.

  aster - TERMITES

  BMC   - ???

          ???

          ???

          So what was it that made you start writing?

  aster - i dont remember.

  BMC   - Is there anything of particular interest that you do remember and
          would like to talk about?

  aster - i dont know.

  BMC   - What have you been up to in the last 15 minutes?

  aster - i just ate dinner.  i helped make it before that.  seinfeld was on
          in the background, i think.

  BMC   - What do you think about supper as a meal in general?  It's weird,
          isn't it?

  aster - *Shrug*  im usually hungry by the time it comes around.  good time
          to get in your vegetables too.

  aster - hi.  this is an interview between aster and Melatonin.

          whats your favorite color?

  Meltn - I refuse to answer this question on the grounds that I might
          incriminate myself, and also on the grounds that I already
          answered it in one of my crappier N-Com articles.

          (P.S. It's brown.)

  aster - have you ever been to china?  do you like pears?  have you ever
          fed a termite?

  Meltn - I travel to China every night on a stolen carpet, but I always
          get lost somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean.

          I do like pears, but I don't trust them.  I think they're fascist.

          As a child, I thought termites were responsible for the holes in
          the ozone layer.  When I told this to a guy from Greenpeace, he
          laughed in my face and I started to cry.  Actually, that last
          part's not true; he laughed back at his office and I wept alone in
          the bathroom.

          Anyway, what were we talking about again?

  aster - tomatos.  once i found an abandoned sock on a beach.  its name was
          joe and it was mad it was abandoned.  would you be mad if you were
          abandoned?

          are you a toaster oven?

  Meltn - First, I am abandoned, but for Bande a part.

          And now I'm sad, like a sock without a shoe.

          A toaster oven?  Why yes, aren't you?

  aster - thats confusing.  i dont understand.  and NO of COURSE im not a
          toaster!! i would never be one of those EVER EVER.  NEVER.  its a
          fact, i just wouldnt.

          gosh.

  Meltn - I'm not a toaster oven either.  I just said I was so I'd look
          cool.  Oh dear, I always mess everything up.

          When I made that bet with the guys, aster, it was before I knew
          the real you, but once I got to know the real you, I realized just
          how special the real you really is.

  aster - youre not a toaster?!?!?!  then what are you??  an orange?  a
          monster?  a cave??  a dark, deep, spooky, cold and damp cave?
          scary!  are you?

  Meltn - If I knew what I was then I probably wouldn't be writing to you
          right now.  I'd be out being.  At the moment, though, I think I'm
          an amalgam of a ghost, a robot, a monster, an alien, and a
          rowboat, all blended up and poured into a convenient,
          easy-to-identify human container.

  aster - those are a lot of things to be, all in one.

          :/

          i mean, ive BEEN a lot of different things... but not ALL IN ONE
          like that.

  Meltn - It's fun, you should try it.  Membership is $49.99 the first year,
          and then $24.99 every year after that.  Bring your own equipment,
          though.

  aster - i used to take ballet.

          have you ever taken ballet?

  Meltn - Real boys don't take ballet and besides, I move like a robot.

          I know a girl who wears dark lipstick when she dances.  She told
          me this.  Actually, she told her friend, and I listened in.

  aster - "on this day which began as execution day and sure enough became
          execution day!"

  Meltn - Confused.  Can't process.

  aster - 15 is not my lucky number.  is 15 your lucky number?
          ehehaheheaheaea

  Meltn - 15 is neither my lucky number nor my unlucky number.  It is a
          neutral number in a long list of other neutral numbers.  And
          that's about all I'll say about that.

          Is someone keeping track of all these questions?  Do you want the
          rest of my sandwich?

  aster - youre so silly.

  Meltn - Silly, LIKE A FOX!

  aster - what kind is your sandwhich?

  Meltn - It has lettuce on it.  It's good to eat the colour green.

  aster - does your sandwhich have anything else on it?  like meat?  or
          mayonaise?  mustard?  tomato?  peanut butter?  what kind of bread
          is it on?  i AM sort of hungry.

  Meltn - What's that?  My sandwich?  No, I just finished it.  Sorry, did
          you want some?  You should have said something.

  aster - have you ever taken yoga?

  Meltn - No, but Margarina Cataclysma has.  You should interview her next.
          I last saw her lifting up mountains and looking for change.

  aster - she sounds scary, with the lifting mountains and all.  yikes.

  Meltn - Margarina is groovy like wallpaper in a shower.  You'd like her.

  aster - have you ever been to seattle, washington?  have you ever been to
          tucson?  what about mexico?  what about south america?

  Meltn - Nope, nope, nope, and nope.

  aster - i want almonds.  do you like almonds?  i like them.  i like
          cashews too.  do you like peanuts or cashews better?  what about
          brazil nuts?  i dont like those too much.

  Meltn - Nuts to these questions, I say.

  aster - what do you eat for breakfast in the morning?

  Meltn - I sleep in the morning and eat breakfast at night.

          And now I think I hear my publicist telling me this interview is
          over.

          It's been charming, though.  Don't ever change, aster, unless it's
          for the better.  And even then, resist it to the last.

                                                                       ,o$o

  Meltn - Hello Spite, Melatonin here.  This is the sound of me sitting down
          to interview you. 

          <insert sound> 

          Ahem.  All right then, let's begin. 

          Having recently re-read  "Cats", your article about quitting, I
          suddenly find myself wandering the streets at night with no sense
          of purpose or direction.  "What's the point in doing anything?" I
          now think to myself.  "Spite is right.  Just quit.  In fact, don't
          even begin." 

          Anyway, what can I do to snap out of this funk?  Help! 

  Spite - Well, the first thing you need to do in order to snap out of your
          funk is to quit being in a funk.  Just quit wandering around
          without any purpose or direction.  You could buy yourself a map of
          the area and draw out a walking route which would, essentially,
          give you some direction.  And as for a purpose, go to the nearest
          7-11 and buy yourself a Big Gulp while you're out there walking
          around.

  Meltn - Maps, huh?  I don't like maps very much, but I suppose I could 
          draw my own, including only the places I like to go.  Hmm, that 
          could work. 

          Anyway, moving on.  How did you first meet the BMC and how did he 
          rope you into writing for the Comintern? 

  Spite - I had the distinct pleasure of meeting the BMC a few years ago,
          when I was living in Saskatoon.  We started out talking on ICQ,
          and then decided to meet in person.  We used to have Goldeneye
          tournaments and browse the fine video selection at Source at 4am
          with Cog.  I'm not really sure how I ended up writing for the
          Comintern, but I remember that my first article was about gypsy
          oppression.  After writing a few more articles, the BMC asked me
          to be a regular contributor.  I still haven't written as much as I
          initially agreed to, but I'm working on it.  

  Meltn - Who won the most tournaments?  Who's N64 was it?  Did BMC spend 
          the entire time talking about Mega Man?  Did Cog spend the entire 
          time talking about Dragon's Lair 2? 

  Spite - I think that the winning was pretty well split between Cog and
          BMC.  They liked to gang up on me and kick my ass, especially when
          we played in Golden Gun mode.  I don't remember ever hearing Cog
          talk about Dragon's Lair 2, but he would go on for hours about how
          he was the master of the "Mole Tunnels."  We used to have theme
          tournaments, and one of the best ones was playing Slappers Only
          all night.  The N64 belonged to my ex-boyfriend, Cory, but we
          would never let him play because we all hated him. 

  Meltn - [Question deleted.]  Be honest. 

  Spite - [Answer deleted.]

  Meltn - I think that last question was stupid.  Do you think it was
          stupid?  Can I delete it?

  Spite - I don't think it was particularly stupid.  I don't really know
          that much about [CENSORED], but I remember what [CENSORED] so I
          based my answer on that.  You can delete it if you like. 

  Meltn - Thanks, Spite.  By the way, I had to censor your last answer on 
          account of you made reference to the stupid parts of the previous 
          question, which kind of defeats the purpose of deleting the stupid 
          question. 

          Can you tell me three childhood anecdotes and/or three writing 
          anecdotes and/or some combination of the two? 

  Spite - I can't really think of anything in particular from my childhood,
          as I have tried to repress as much of that as possible, but I've
          come up with a few things. 

          -I loved the movie E.T. when I was a kid.  My parents bought me a 
           plastic E.T. doll for my 3rd birthday, the hard plastic kind that 
           wasn't particularly cuddly and was quite ugly.  I adored it but I
           was also terribly afraid of it.  So much that I would insist it
           be kept in the livingroom toy box at night.  I would make sure my
           parents had closed him up in the toy box every night before I
           would go to bed.

          -When I started third grade at a new school, I had never played 
           volleyball.  It was part of the Gym class program at the new
           schooland I turned out to be quite terrible.  Especially at
           serving the ball.  I could never manage to make my right hand
           connect to the ball in my left hand.  My teacher got quite fed up
           with watching my pathetic attempts and she came over to help me
           out.  She stood behind me and held the ball in front of me,
           intending for me to serve the ball.  I missed completely and
           punched her square in the mouth instead.  It was a good hit,
           too.  I managed to bruise her gums and almost knock out one of
           her front teeth.

          -I once gave an entire French presentation to a class with my fly 
           down.  I noticed a few people laughing and whispering, but I
           figured it had something to do with what I was talking about.  It
           wasn't until I finally finished my presentation and sat down that
           one of my friends was good enough to enlighten me on the
           situation.

  Meltn - Hmm, those all sound pretty depressing.  Don't you have any good 
          childhood memories?  For example, that time you and Beth roasted
          hot dogs in your backyard on your 8th birthday. 

  Spite - That sounds like it would be a nice memory to have, but my
          birthday is in December and so I doubt we'd have been roasting
          anything in the backyard.  I did go on a cool ride at an amusement
          park so many times I threw up when I was a kid.  That was pretty
          fun.

  Meltn - What is your favourite Harvey Keitel movie? 

  Spite - My favorite Harvey Keitel movie is definitely "Bad Lieutenant."
          I watched it with BMC a couple years ago. 

  Meltn - What is your favourite movie NOT starring Harvey Keitel? 

  Spite - My favorite movie not starring Harvey is "Fear and Loathing in
          Las Vegas."  I've seen it five or six times now and I still love
          it.

  Meltn - How did you arrive at the name Spite? 

  Spite - A friend of mine once referred to me as  "sugar and spite and 
          everything nice."  That, and I bitch a lot. 

  Meltn - I was sitting in a big tent the other day, waiting to clean up 
          garbage with BMC, Heckat, and Cog, and I asked them what my next 
          question should be.  This is what they said.  "Spite is really 
          easy-going -- you can ask her anything."  "Dig deep."  "Ask her
          why she got married." 

  Spite - Well, I got married for pretty well all the same reasons most
          people get married.  I love my husband and wanted to make an
          official commitment to him.  We also realised that because we are
          from different countries that we'd have to get married in order to
          be able to live in the same place. 

  Meltn - Do you consider yourself easy-going, or is the entire N-Com 
          staff a pack of liars? 

  Spite - I do consider myself pretty easy-going.  Perhaps a little too 
          easy-going for my own good sometimes. 

  Meltn - If both TRIPE and the Neo-Comintern were drowning in the ocean 
          and you had but one life preserver to throw, which text-based
          e-zine would you save and which would you let die a horrible,
          gurgling death? 

  Spite - I would save the N-Com, I think. 

  Meltn - Were there any good questions that I forgot to ask?  If so, 
          answer them now as if I hadn't. 

  Spite - Is there any such thing as a good question? 

  Meltn - ? 

  Spite - ! 

                                                                       ,o$o

  Spite - I've noticed that you are the only dead writer among us at the
          N-Com.  Has your death had a positive or negative impact on your
          writing?
 
  Kom B - Interesting question, I have never really dwelled on how my death
          has impacted my ability or style of writing.  I guess I was more
          preoccupied with the fact that I was dead.  However, now that I
          think on it, it would seem that it has, in the fact I have written
          very little, but when I have written something it has been the
          sort of usual low calibre rhetoric that people were used to when I
          was alive.
 
  Spite - In issue 83, Junior Haagis mentions a condition you refer to as
          "70's Style Banana-Tits."  Could you explain that condition?
 
  Kom B - At first I was quite confused by your question.  Let's just say if
          this interview was in person I'd probably have to end it.
          However, it's not, so I was able to read the articles in question
          to actually see what in fact this condition was...
 
          At first I immediately thought back to my days in the pornography
          industry circa 1976, when I was a grip for some of their
          productions. Not one of my best years but one I still remember
          fondly.
 
          As to the actual condition -- beats me... I'm too lean to suffer
          such a condition, and besides the first article contradicts the
          second so the question lies in who you believe.
 
  Spite - There seems to be a bit of confusion surrounding the circumstances
          of your death.  I've read that you committed suicide and also that
          you were run over by a car.  How did you really die?
 
  Kom B - I was also pushed off a house.  I can understand the confusion.
          The only thing I can reply with is more confusion.  You see, I
          died all those deaths and none of them.  The Comintern has never
          been about one particular dimension or even the physical world.
          It's not so much how I died that is important, because it achieved
          the same result (My death).
 
  Spite - Do you consider yourself a ghost?  Do you ever haunt anyone to
          pass the time?
 
  Kom B - Ghosts are a strange topic.  Most dead people I know are offended
          by that descriptor.  As for haunting, now I cannot say I have done
          that in my past time.  The dead are more pre-occupied with other
          more important activities, such as wailing, moaning, and howling.
          So as you can see, with all that going on, who has time to haunt
          some dude in Texas?
 
  Spite - I was once fortunate enough to enjoy a private viewing of your
          feature film Mang Slaughter.  Do you think there will ever be a
          sequel?
 
  Kom B - I will assume by saying Mang Slaughter that you are actually
          referring to the trilogy we made back in 94.  We attempted to make
          a fourth movie, more like an epic; however maturity and time
          (Actually we could not find the right combination of drugs)
          prevented us from completing it.  However, I think the stock
          footage of me jumping off the house and dancing on some hill still
          exists somewhere.
 
          I think it would be fun to complete the epic in the future, but
          still using the stock footage from the original taping, just so
          people can become confused at how we suddenly age, and how High
          Cog cut off all his hair thus putting away the label of King of
          the Rubbies!  But, more importantly, we can hype the movie by
          saying it took 10 years to make.

  Spite - You've been with the N-Com since its beginning, known back then
          simply as the Comintern.  How did the whole thing begin?
 
  Kom B - Good question.  I wasn't there right from beginning.  BMC had done
          a few issues of the Comintern himself, and the zine was simply a
          hardcore socialist publication.  In that way that he has he
          managed to convince so many others, I took up the keyboard and
          wrote some stuff about who knows what.  He read and said something
          along the lines of Tripe.... Needless to say it was in the next
          installment, and the idea for Tripe magazine was also born.
 
  Spite - How does the Neo-Comintern compare to the Comintern?  Are there m
          any differences between the two?
 
  Kom B - One is newer then the other.  The Comintern was a little more
          serious at times, at little more stupid at times.  We were
          younger, less wise, and under the influence of various substances.
          I can't say the calibre of the Comintern approaches anything near
          what you read today, but some of the original zine work appears in
          early issues of the Neo-Comintern.
 
  Spite - What were the early days like?  Did you enjoy writing for the
          Comintern?
 
  Kom B - The Comintern was not something you enjoyed.  BMC demanded
          ruthless efficiency and plus there was a bitter feud with High Cog
          and D.J. Gnarly that threatened to spill over into civil war.  It
          was a wild time of instability and ideas.  We were lucky to get
          down what we could.  The ideas for "Hey Young World!" spawned from
          those times.
 
  Spite - What brought on the transition from Comintern to Neo-Comintern? 
 
  Kom B - After a few years of doing nothing we decided to resurrect the
          zine.  It was new thus the label Neo-Comintern.  We took the
          elements we liked best from the original Comintern and
          concentrated on those.  You can still see our desires to lash out
          against capitalism and fascism, however with each issue it becomes
          less pronounced, more subtle, until you can hardly notice it at
          all.  Except for when the capitalist monster took over....
 
  Spite - Do you have any insight as to what the future holds for the N-Com? 
 
  Kom B - Tripe is the future.  It's time we got on board the mass media
          wagon and spewed less facts, less insights, and more about
          nothing.  Its brain fodder for the 21st century go'er.  No more
          asinine attempts to be witty; we are not going to pretend
          anymore (or proof read for that matter).  It's TRIPE magazine and
          we love it.

  Spite - There seems to be a rather sordid tale in circulation right now
          concerning you, six ounces of gin, and a delerium induced fit of
          vomiting upon the bed of an unidentified N-Com member.  Is there
          any truth to this?  Perhaps you can set the record straight and
          let everyone know what really happened.

  Kom B - Well I cannot deny this tale, but there was also beer involved.
          The attempts to ratify the "Hey Young World" series into a
          fruitful culmination proved too much for me, and I succumbed to
          the pressure by vomiting profusely.  Of course it was at BMC's, so
          I don't feel that guilty about it.

  Spite - Is the maiden Carlene from the Atlantis stories based on a real
          woman?

  Kom B - A great question. I spoke with BMC about Carlene recently and
          apparently she was a real girl and I loved her very much.  When I
          was told of this I remembered a firey girl with a blank expression
          in her eyes.  So in other words yes she was a real girl, but she
          was so much more than simply that.

  Spite - The King of the Moon has fallen ill, and appointed you regent.  In
          what ways would you abuse your newly bestowed powers?

  Kom B - Interesting.  It would depend on which king.  The Anti-King
          Jamulous Remus?  Or the foul King N'mblor of the MoOn MOonStarS?
          Being king of the monsters my first decree would be a banquet in
          which all MoON creatures will attend.  From there I would probably
          have the cooks kill all of them so I could consume their flesh.
          After that I don't know -- I'd probably jack up the price of MoON
          trinkets 300%.

  Spite - Are you afraid of anything in particular?  If so, what is it and
          why?

  Kom B - A Prince of Atlantis has nothing he need fear except losing
          memory of his royal past.  I endured that for many a year so I
          have lived my greatest and by surviving I have become quite
          powerful (Except when drinking then I become a vomiting mess).

  Spite - And finally, what do you think is your purpose here on Earth?  Do
          you have any plans on fulfilling your purpose?

  Kom B - Mortals have no purpose.  No thought, no idea, no invention we
          devise will survive the test of time.  Teach a kid to read?  Nah,
          he will only die and your efforts will be in vain.  We merely
          exist and my goal in life is to do just that.  Exist....

          Thank you for your time.

                                                                       ,o$o

  Komrade B - What would you want put on your tombstone?  Any epitaph, if
              you will.

  Jet Jag   - Since I don't have an original bone in my body, I shall simply
              rip off a saying oft quoted about Lord Byron -- Mad, bad, and
              dangerous to know.  I think that covers *moi* most
              succulently.

  Komrade B - Tell me of your father.  Did he ever strike you down for
              insolence?

  Jet Jag   - There I go, I promised myself that I wouldn't cry.  My father
              was a drunken lout; a filthy run of the mill warlord type.  I
              hated the son of a bitch, especially since I knew I was a
              greater ruler than he could ever be.  He tired of my sarcasm
              and hateful looks.  After one party where the retched bastard
              had drunk a lot of tawny port, he took offense at one of my
              snide remarks and *attempted* to strike me down.  He clumsily
              lumbered about and nearly fell upon his own sword.  It amused
              me to mock him in front of his subjects who were at the
              reception.  Everything I've ever done was to erase his name
              from the memory of the earth.

              Wait.  That wasn't me.  That was Alexander the Great and his
              father.  My father was murdered by the invaders, they kept me
              as a puppet ruler till I turned 13 and had them all
              slaughtered by the royal guards whom I had struck a deal with.

              Uh, that wasn't me either.  That was Ivan the Terrible.
              Fuck!  I have to stop identifying with historical personages.
              Can I get back to you on this question?

  Komrade B - Do you ever lie and steal?  What's the coolest thing you have
              stolen?

  Jet Jag   - Lying and stealing is all part of the dictator/evil CEO game.
              As for the coolest thing I've ever stolen was that phoenix
              egg, but that's one of those stories in which you had to be
              there.  I'll instead cater to the rabble by saying the coolest
              thing I've ever stolen was their hearts.  *blech!*

  Komrade B - Will you be involved in BMC's latest effort, TRIPE?  Something
              tells me it's going to be fantastic.

  Jet Jag   - I have not been asked, but as usual someone in the textfiles
              scene hath stunted *moi* inspiration.  I was all ready to
              destroy TCAHR and create a "latest effort" of my own of such
              diabolical brilliance that I would out-evil the tomes of
              Lucifer Himself.  What should have been introduced to
              thunderous applause would now be greeted by whispers of
              "copycat" and "ass-kissing wanker."  I shall bid my time and
              wait to launch my own latest effort.  Instead, I shall
              continue with my efforts of destroying TCAHR with late,
              idiotic issues and nonsensical ranting.

              I am, after all, like Nero and TCAHR is my Rome.  It is mine
              to burn.

  Komrade B - What is the most embarrassing CD in your music collection?

  Jet Jag   - Oh that's as easy as it is mortifying.  It's  "Through The
              Rainbow -- Music To The Seven Chakras" by Morten Alexander
              Joramo.  I brought this at this place in Chicago named "Two
              Doors".  Two Doors is a place in Chicago where you can buy
              candles, oils, jewelry, books and whatnots of a flaky New Age
              nature.  To my incredible shame, I've spent a lot of money
              there buying supplies for occult gobbly-gook in my search for
              "enlightenment."

              Anywho, about the CD.  Imagine the ideas behind a major
              Eastern philosophy stripped of its culture and packaged for
              the suburbanite set.  Now set it to elevator musak.

  Komrade B - Do you find it strange that you are being interviewed by an
              entity that for all intents and purposes is actually dead?
              Your thoughts on the matter...

  Jet Jag   - It's not so strange when you realize that you're interviewing
              a persona created specifically for the TCAHR e-zine that
              doesn't actually jibe with the ideas, attitude, or ethics of
              its creator.  I like to think the Jet Jaguar persona is way
              better at achieving my agendas than I would be.  Just because
              I like to think it doesn't mean it's true though.

              The dead interviewing an invention.  Oh, brave new world that
              has such people in it!

  Komrade B - Who is the Greatest Blues Musician of all time?

  Jet Jag   - You put me in a bind with this question.  Whenever I think of
              the Blues, I think of Jazz and Rock and Roll.  These three
              musical disciplines contain various style within themselves as
              well as overlap with each other.  I'm going to throw out a few
              names before I tell you my personal favorite.  Kind of a
              respectful "shouts out": Cab Calloway, Count Basie, B.B. King,
              Jimi Hendrix, Janice Joplin, Eric Clapton, Billie Holiday,
              Elvis Presley, Sinead O'Connor, John Popper, John Lee Hooker,
              Stevie Ray Vaughn, Billy Joel, The Beatles, Stevie Wonder and
              Mel Torme.  It's hard to choose what is Blues, what is Jazz,
              and what is Rock 'N' Roll sometimes.  Where do you put someone
              like Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder, or Sinead O'Connor?  Even
              some of The Cure's stuff can qualify as Jazz.

              My personal favorite will probably go down as the most hated
              Blues musician ever.  You may have never heard Ike Turner
              play, but you probably seen "What's Love Got To Do With It"
              starring Angela Bassett as the battered Tina Turner.  That
              movie made Ike an object of hatred to those who've never seen
              the man jam.  I'm not saying that Ike wasn't a sadistic
              wife-beating savage, but it doesn't overshadow his talent.
              It's dangerous to confuse ability with morality.  The man is a
              genius who helped the careers of two of my favorite rock and
              roll musicians: Jimi and Janice.

  Komrade B - Being a cartoon watcher, give me your opinions on Dr. Cats and
              Home Movies if you have seen them before.

  Jet Jag   - Haven't seen them, my cartoon tastes are horribly mainstream.
              If it doesn't play on Saturday or Sunday morning, isn't
              marketed towards children and meant to suck their parents'
              wallets dry, I haven't seen them.

  Komrade B - Do you believe Orwell's book 1984 is a realistic
              interpretation of a possible future?

  Jet Jag   - Future?  You mean this isn't it?

              I think "Brave New World" is a more apt prediction for the
              United States, Canada, and certain parts of Europe.  The
              greatest triumph of a capitalistic government is in using
              goods and services to bedazzle its citizens.  Our standards of
              success are so strongly based on beauty and money that we buy
              these goods and services as a way to show what level of
              society we belong to as well as to be perceived as
              attractive.  We can show our worth according to colors,
              fabrics, and brand names.  Who gives a damn about the real
              person?  We'd accept the reincarnation of Hitler into our
              homes if he were wearing a Brooks Brothers or Armani suit.

              Although "1984" and "Brave New World" are satires, Orwell's
              book fails by stating that a fascist government would destroy
              beauty to enslave its citizens.  That is absolutely
              ridiculous; beauty is the greatest enslaver of all.  A look
              into the history of our species will attest to that.

  Komrade B - What would you say to the young world out there?
   
  Jet Jag   - Jet Jaguar would now answer back with his special brand of
              right-wing flavored socialism (now with 10% percent more
              sarcasm!).  The Persona behind Jet Jaguar would sit back with
              a bottle of Jack Daniels, a pack of Marlbros and think about
              his answer.

              I, Persona, just turned 28.  Not an old age by objective
              standards, but in an age where music, art and technology
              morph and date humans so quickly I am old enough.  Now if you
              are a reader of my journals, you realize that the problems I
              deal with are the problems that would be expected of someone
              10 years older than I.  I've had a busy life in the support
              of others as well as self-denial which only led to an
              arrested development.  (I'd give all the exciting details
              about drug dealing, military life, degrading sex and
              boheimism, but this is your final question.  You didn't ask.
              Muahhaha.)

              And so my advice to the young world is...

              Be selfish.  Your joy, so long as it doesn't personally hurt
              anyone, is key.

              Have lots of sex with many men and women.  Experiment
              often -- how can you know you don't like sucking dick if you
              never have?

              Music is a fountain of youth.  The beginning of disgust and
              prejudice against music is the beginning of old age.

              Play.  The saddest part of growing up is the forgetting of
              the enjoyment of running headlong into the streets while
              yelling and laughing with no rule to stop you.

              Explore creative egomania.  To quote Crowley  "Invoke often.
              Inflame thyself with power."

              Perhaps you'll someday feel your destiny and your family's
              role for you clash.  You'll feel like savagely attacking your
              family to protect your destiny (Which is your self-created
              child -- you created it yourself out of fantasy dust, didn't
              you?), although the consequences will seem grim.  Screw your
              courage to your sticking post and take them out.  Hard.

              I think if I would have follow my own advice, I would have
              become a fully-functional adult human being.  Instead I
              remain...

  THE ADA INTERVIEW:

  In which our heroine is forced to endure and defend her life against
  irritating, unoriginal questions maliciously asked by the textfile
  villian, Jet Jaguar. Our story begins...

  Jet - Well, you certainly made me research a lot for this interview.  I
        wasn't prepared to read so much about Canadian personalities.  Being
        an USAmerican, I believe I own everything and don't understand much
        about anything outside our borders.

        What are your feelings about the far-reaching USAmerican culture and
        its almost complete ignorance about Canadian culture?

  ada - well, i guess i don't think much about it.  every so often i do and
        it irritates me but i think i've been brainwashed by the canadian
        government (aka the media) to not really notice or ignore the fact
        that canada has such a small impact on the us.  and like most
        canadians, i think i foster the hope that this isn't really true,
        and that the us really does have more of an idea of what goes on up
        here, not just that living in saskatoon means i drive my sled dogs
        to school and that i live in an igloo.  i'm pretty lucky to live in
        a farily culturally diverse and artsy city which is why it's so
        great to be a writer here... plus it's cheap to live!

        p.s. you're right, you do own everything, even me...

  Jet - What Canadian artists, musicians and writers do you recommend to
        someone absolutely ignorant about all things Canadian.

  ada - well, this is an excellent question jet, and i'm glad you asked it.
        i'll just make a list. hawksley workman, lorna crozier, robert
        kroetsch, marilyn dumont, warren cariou, alison caulder, margaret
        atwood, jon clark, brecken hancock, judith krause, the tragically
        hip, barenaked ladies, joni mitchell, jared peace, barbara klar, tim
        lilburn, patrick lane, erika quiring, etc

        etc...

  Jet - A lot of wannabees cop the poet's laurels without ever studying
        the works, techniques or history of established poets or poetry.
        Let's play about with the questions that separate the poets from the
        posuers.

        What is your personal philosophy in the writing of verse?

  ada - hmmm, well can it be possible that i don't have a philosophy about
        verse at all?  i hate to leave you hanging jet...

        i asked my family how i should answer this... here is what they
        said...

        my brother - 'verse sucks' or 'verse rocks' (depending on your
        opinion.  if questioned further, just respond with 'i'm answering
        with a minimalist attitude')

        my father - 'verse-what?'

        my sister - 'would you shut up!'

  Jet - Who are your inspirations?

  ada - judith krause, anne szumiglaski, margaret atwood, robert kroetsch,
        hawksley workman, lorna crozier, etc etc.  pretty much every
        writer/musician i listed earlier has inpiried or influenced me in
        some way or another.  the poets i've worked with personally are the
        ones who get the most credit for inspiration, aka judith krause.

  Jet - What is the ideal situation/place to get your writing mojo working?

  ada - that's kind of a tough one since my mojo changes depending on my
        mood.

        since i got my computer, about six months ago, i've been getting my
        mojo on with it almost every night.  it's pretty hot shit, i'm
        telling you.  my best situation (or at least what seemed to work
        this summer) is coming home drunk at three in the morning and
        writing until four or five.  however, a coffee shop works well for
        me, especially when i am travelling.  i'm also very fond of
        greyhound buses, and are in debt to them for some of the poems i've
        written.

  Jet - I decided, on my own, with no twisting of my arm to ask you
        questions about your zine, "Backyard Ashes."  (Interviewer's note:
        BMC, you owe me 500 pesos next time we're in Tijuana.)  The reviews
        I've found admire the strength of the chosen material.

        How did the idea for Backyard Ashes come about?

  ada - well, i won't regergitate the entire editors notes from the first
        issue, but basically it came out of the last class of our
        introduction to creative writing.  this is where i met brecken (and
        some other fine writers mentioned above) and on this last class we
        threw around the idea of a writing co-op... getting the writers in
        the class together to publish our own work. this idea fell apart
        somewhat as we all went our seperate ways, but brecken and i were
        quite adamant to get started, and after six months of
        procastination, and six months of hardcore working, we produced the
        first issue of backyard ashes and launched it at a local
        bookstore... it's been a roller coaster ride since and we've never
        looked back...

  Jet - If I were a potential Backyard Ashes writer, what should I know
        about its submission standards?

  ada - we take poetry, prose and artwork... we hope for some literary
        experimentation, but it's hard to say what the standards are because
        it really depends on how we feel about each individual piece
        submitted.  i wouldn't say we have a particular method of choosing
        what goes in... like most poets, i think we just know what we like,
        and what we consider to be 'good writing.'

        oh, and you have to buy us beer

  Jet - What is your rejection rate?

  ada - hmmmm, well, lets just say sometimes we need to solicit work from
        writers we know are good.

  Jet - An interesting thing of note to those who have read your work for
        N-Com and for Backyard Ashes is that you seem to go over and rewrite
        your work.  The piece "stories for fruit" in Backyard Ashes is
        longer and more full than "stories for fruit" in N-Com.  The word
        "cacophony," first word in your ambitious "Ada's Top 200 Words of
        All Time" (N-Com #200) receives its own spotlight in N-Com #210's
        "Cacophony."

        How important do you find it to go over and/or rewrite past
        material?

  ada - well, to be honest jet, i didn't think i was the type to go over and
        rewrite past work, but you do make a good point.  these might have
        been special cases because i knew that stories for fruit wasn't
        finished when i sent it to the n-com, i was also pretty sure that it
        wasn't done when i put it in backyard ashes.  i still plan to add to
        it, just because it has been one of the most interesting and fun
        pieces i've worked on and has so far recieved the most postive
        feedback.  in terms of the article 'cacophony,' well, i'm just in
        love with that word.  and since it is my favorite, i figured it just
        needed an article all on it's own.

        for the most part though, i tend to write a piece, edit it, work on
        it and then finish it and not go back to it.  i think that's why i
        started to write poetry in the first place... because i can finish
        it.

  Jet - Is there any difference in the work you consider doing for N-Com and
        the work you do for Backyard Ashes?

  ada - definitely, although i can see a slight merge between the two
        (stories for fruit being a good example).  i think my writing style
        is much more developed now than it was six months or a year ago, and
        it can be hard to remove myself from a style i'm most comfortable
        in.  backyard ashes is the magazine i feel that represents the style
        i am most comfortable writing in, and the n-com is the magazine that
        allows me to deviate from that style and challenges me to think
        outside the box i've built for myself.  i see backyard ashes as
        having a more traditional and modern literary content (if that makes
        sense!) which tends to be what my influences are, whereas the n-com
        lets me go off the wall which is really fun for me.  the n-com
        reminds me why i write in the first place, because it's fun... it's
        entertainment.

        it's really important for my writing that i submit to both magazines
        because they are so different.  that way i can stretch myself as a
        writer.

  Jet - Do you have any secret works hiding in some dark, mysterious place
        that you will never, EVER print? (Feel free to print them here.)

  ada - i do have some secret writing... i keep everything i've done since
        i started writing in grade nine... i have disks full of the most
        awful shit you will ever read...

  Jet - I didn't notice until I was typing up these questions that you
        dabble in photography as well and have a pretty fab eye when it
        comes to that as well.  Poetry, prose, photography -- you're pretty
        well-rounded it comes to the arts.  So I began to wonder about
        everything else.

        What are your non-art intellectual pursuits?

  ada - my non-art intellectual pursuit would be the women and gender
        studies degree i'm currently trying to achieve.  i took last year
        off to figure out what i wanted to do with myself and my life and i
        realized that i want to continue an education in writing and women's
        studies, so i'm back at school working towards these goals.  i'm
        also thinking of going to the university of victoria and getting a
        bfa in creative writing, but we'll see what happens.  i see the
        humanities, social sciences and the arts all interconnected though,
        so it's hard for me to see anything as simply an 'intellectual
        pursuit'... i'm also lucky enough to have a mother who is a
        research scientist and has been very good at showing me the art in
        science.  i also love to dance... that was just a side note.

  Jet - It's a big world full of -isms.  (IE: Socialism, Conservatism,
        Paganism, Feminism, Bananaism.)  What kind of -isms are you guilty
        of?

  ada - well i've been known to be guilty of bananaism... and apparently i'm
        all about feminism too... oh and socialism... and for any of you old
        ally mcbeal fans, i'm a great fan of fishisms and mcbealisms...

  Jet - What's the definition of a realistic good time to ada?

  ada - any time hanging out with my closest friends, cooking a good old
        fashioned stir fry with yams, listening to a little hawksley, or
        some daniel johnson, maybe camping, makin movies, canoeing, going
        out dancing, feeling the love... you know it.

  Jet - What's the fantasy verison of a good time to ada?

  ada - at this point, probably sleeping with someone i know ill never be
        able to sleep with again...

  Jet - What questions should I have asked that I missed out on and shall
        now never know the answers to?

  ada - hey, what is this... now i have to be the interviewer too?... nice
        try jet... pawning off your job on me...

  Jet - Finally, have you now or ever been a member of the Communist party?

  ada - yes, and i'm a member of the gay and lesbian association for some
        reason... for any of you who didn't get that reference, you're not
        worthy.

                                                                       ,o$o

  ada - hi linear,

        it's good to meet you....in an abstract sort of way!  i am your
        interviewer for the n-com's special issue.  i actually have only
        read a couple of your articles so far since i am fairly new to the
        neo-comintern staff, but i especially enjoyed your article in the
        top ten issue, top ten bible quotes.  i was traveling in ontario at
        the time, and took that issue on the bus with me to toronto one
        afternoon.....i found yours amusing to the point where i was
        laughing out loud much to the dismay of the other passengers.
        anyway, i was impressed with your work and when the bmc suggested
        this special interview issue, i put in a request to interview you.

        but of course i have been struggling as to where to even start, so i
        figured i should at least e-mail you a friendly hello so we can
        establish some dialogue and you will know that i exist and i am your
        secret admirer....er, interviewer.

        so now i'm off to check out your zine and see what else i can learn
        about you before i begin asking you questions.  i'm also trying to
        hurry up and finish my page for the lexia of fame, so if you so
        desire, you can find out who i am.

        anyway, i hope you're having a good summer so far, and i'll write
        you again very soon.

        ada:)
	
  lin - Hello there!  Great to hear from my adm...interviewer!  (reminds me
        that my slacker self needs to get to work on his interview).
        Anyway, to help you out with doing some "research" on what I've
        written, i'll point you here:
        http://www.phonelosers.net/linear/writing.html a site that lists all
        my published texts (at least that i can still remember).  Please
        keep in mind that some of these are horrible (i started IR when i
        was but freshman at upland high school, i believe).  There's some
        nuggets of linear-goodness in there somewhere, however.
  
        I hope you enjoy your choice in interviewee (even though we were not
        suppose to choose who we interviewed, you rebel!).  I'm not the best
        conversationalist in the world, but I'll try and do my best provide
        a somewhat entertaining interview.  I'll be sure to check out your
        page when you're finished.  That should be fun.  Also, if you ever
        want to contact me on AIM or whatever, a lot of contact info is
        provided in my signature.
  
        I much look forward to hearing from you again!

  ada - hi linear,

        well, i've recently been checking out impulse reality and have had a
        fun time reading your articles.  there are so many thing i want to
        ask you, but i think i'm going to spend a day coming up with a few
        important questions to start.  cog gave me the idea of asking one
        question at a time so you wouldn't feel overwhelmed and could give
        each question your fullest answer.....i liked that idea, so that's
        what i'll be doing.  like i said, i really liked a lot of your
        articles, my favorites (out of the ones i've read so far, which are
        about three-quarters, i plan to read the rest later today) are: shh!
        it's secret!, kung fu timothy, conflagration, junior high, haiku's
        are fun, lovable satan, and an open response to a former writer.
        these are great articles and provided me with a lot of things to
        think about (and laugh about).  anyway, i imagine i'll send you the
        first question sometime today, or tomorrow, but for now i'm going to
        compile my thoughts together in some kind of order.

        talk to you soon!!

        ada
 
  lin - Hi there!
  
        I'm glad you're enjoying my articles (at least some one does!).  I'm
        really pleased to learn you like "ssh!"... that is definitely one my
        favorites of mine.  That and "Loneliness; A Poorly Written
        Tragedy" -- If I can be so pretentious as to have favorites of my
        own work (: (and pretentiousness is something I'm good at!)
 
        I'm excited to be interviewed!  It makes me feel important, teehee.
        Plus you seem like you'll be a fun interviewer!  So I'm looking
        forward to it.
  
        Okay, good to see you're still alive!
  
        BEST WISHES!@$#
        linear/jared

  ada - okay guys, here is where i misplace a bit of dialogue, so i'll throw
        you right into the interview....

        do you think of your writing as a hobby or a passion?

  lin - Hrm, interesting question.  I suppose I'd have to answer with
        "neither."  My logic might get a little strange here, but... Writing
        has always just been something I've *done*.  Not necessarily a hobby
        or a passion.  From as early of an age as I can remember, I've been
        writing.  And even when I wasn't *really* writing coherently, I'd
        put weird thought fragments down on notebook paper to help sort out
        what I was thinking - I'm generally a pretty confused guy (I showed
        one of these pages to a girl I was with at the time.  Her response
        was something along the lines of "I don't like that at all.  You're
        kind of frightening," teehee!).  So just as I can't really classify
        breathing or eating as a hobby/passion (because they're simply
        things I -do-), I can't classify writing (as it is also something I
        just -do-).  GET IT?

  ada - what is your favorite food?

  lin - The easy answer to give here is "vegan food!"  Being a vegan, I'm
        somewhat limited to what I can eat.  But if you want a little more
        of a specific answer, I guess I'm pretty fond of Mexican food.  But
        I'm not a picky vegan.  As long as it's not derived from animals,
        I'll probably enjoy it.  I've said the word "vegan" a lot, haven't
        I?  Just so I can say I've said vegan 6 times in this answer;
        vegan.

  ada - what is your favorite song/singer/band?

  lin - I still consider myself involved with the punk scene, though lately
        I haven't been listening to much punk (perhaps my musical taste is
        evolving).  My favorite band rotates quite a bit, so I never have a
        favorite band for very long.  Currently, I guess I'd have to say
        that the Violent Femmes are my favorite band.  I've also been
        listening to a lot of Hefner, Steppenwolf, NIN, Modest Mouse, and a
        lot of 60's music lately.  That doesn't mean those are my favorite
        bands, I've just been listening to them a lot lately.  See, I
        haven't even mentioned one punk band yet.  But I'll make up for it
        right here: My favorite song would probably be "Science of Myth" by
        Screeching Weasel.  I suppose Screeching Weasel is relatively punk.
        But yeah, I'm into all sorts of music lately, a lot of indie and
        older stuff.  Even the Beatles.  Psh, and I call myself punk.
        Running close behind "Science of Myth" for my favorite song are the
        songs "Mint Car" and "Cut Here" (both by The Cure).  I like the Cure
        a lot.
  
        WARNING: INSIDE JOKE BELOW!!

        Cut Here -loves- Mint Car.

  ada - what is your favorite thing to do alone?

  lin - I like to write poetry.  Or meditate.  Or read poetry.  Read
        anything.  Sadly, I've been wasting a lot of my free time sleeping
        lately.  I'm quite fond of sleep, but I just don't like not getting
        things done.  Sleep is counterrevolutionary!

  ada - what is your favorite thing to do with others?

  lin - I haven't had much time to be with others lately (what with my job),
        so any time I do *any*thing with others is pretty nice.  Lately,
        just sitting around with my friends and doing nothing but listening
        to weird music has equaled enjoyment and good times.  I just
        recently over the past few months fell in with a small group of
        amazing people who are really special to me.  This is the first time
        I've felt so much a "part" of a group of people.  I used to (still
        do?) have (mild?) social anxiety, and I'm not really use to such an
        empowering feeling like that of belonging.  Am I rambling?

  ada - do you fall in love easily?

  lin - No.  Well, maybe.  Okay, yes.  I suppose.  I'm in love currently,
        but I don't like it.  Let me start over - I love the feeling that
        love brings, and I love being able to give myself away to someone.
        But I'm so sick of the eventual inevitable hurt that love has
        traditionally brought to me (linear is no stranger to broken hearts,
        folks).  Honestly though, I believe that love is the ultimate act of
        revolution.  It's definitely something we all need to strive for,
        even if you're a cowardly cynic like me who thinks hurt is all there
        is out there (hey, it can't just be a coincidence that "I
        -HEART-YOU" sounds so much like "I HURT YOU," right?).  Love is
        empowering.  Embrace it!

  ada - what has been the closest you have gotten to a utopian
        existence/society?

  lin - Allow me to get corny here... The first time -she- fell asleep in my
        arms is the closest I've ever been to a perfect utopian existence.
        I came to realize the truth behind the statement that "even a rotten
        creep can have moments sweet and pure."  The honesty of it hit me
        hard as I got to watch her beautiful face rest.  There have been
        plenty of similarly amazing moments with her since then as well, but
        this one will always stand out for some reason.  I remember when
        everyday was -that- amazing with her.  Don't get me wrong.  Every
        moment with her is still the best moment of my life, but lately,
        though everything's still just like a dream, there's times when I
        realize just how scared I am about what is going to happen with us
        (if anything, most likely nothing).  I'm rambling and getting mushy
        and retarded, aren't I?
 
  ada - i am curious as to why you actively reject religion as an
        institution, yet are a practicing buddhist.  could you give me your
        thoughts on this?

  lin - Teehee, good question.  Sure, just go ahead and point out all my
        logistical flaws!  I suppose that the best way to answer this is
        to deny that Buddhism is a religion.  Buddhism is based on
        philosophy, not dogma and rituals and belief in supernatural
        craziness.  So really, Buddhism is simply a philosophy (well, most
        Mahayana sects, at least).  The main reason I reject religion is
        all the suffering it has, and continues, to cause.  Once you make
        a big superfriend in the sky to worship and obey, suddenly
        everyone feels it's okay to kill, persecute, and torture in the
        name of their own concept of this superfriend.  Buddha was not a
        god, nor did he preach/practice a belief in a higher deity.  Such
        things do not further us spiritually.  Buddhism is the only major
        "religion" that has spread worldwide with no social coercion!  It
        is very accepting of other religions (unlike me!), and welcomes
        evolving interpretations and ways of practice within itself.  This
        isn't to say there are not other religions out there that are
        non-deity based as well, they just don't make as much sense to me
        philosophically or spiritually.

  ada - it would have been funny if in kung fu timothy, in one of the last
        stanzas instead of saying 'he got to his feet,' saying 'he got to
        his foot.'  would you agree or disagree?  (this is by no means a
        criticism, i thought the article was great, however i found that
        idea funny)

  lin - That was nawleed's doing, so you can blame him.  But actually, I
        disagree with you.  I like the way it is, simply because of the line
        that reads "...momentarily ignoring the fact that he only had one
        leg..." which still makes me laugh, over two years after it's
        writing.  Had we just said he jumped to his feet without any
        explanation, that would indeed be a plot-hole and we'd have to
        retire from the writing world forever, banished in shame.  However,
        I do see the humor in the phrase "jumped to his foot."  By the way,
        no offense taken, I like writing suggestions and even the occasional
        criticisms, constructive or not.  I'm a feedback whore!

  ada - what do you feel is the best article/piece you've ever written and
        why? (this is your big chance to blatantly brag about yourself!)

  lin - I would like to say that "shh, it's secret!" is my favorite, but as
        it stands now, there's a stigma of heartbreak attached to it.  See,
        in the beginning of this interview (as this interview has taken a
        period of weeks to complete), I mentioned something about being in
        love, and how I was sure I was going to be hurt.  Well, that part of
        the interview is already outdated, as that girl did, indeed, lead me
        to heartache!  No surprises, at least.

        Anyway, "shh, it's secret" was written about this girl many moons
        ago.  I like it because it's probably one of the most raw things
        I've written.  I wrote it around 2 in the morning in an email to
        her, and it was all direct.  She told me she liked it a lot, and I
        guess it was that email that convinced her I was a good writer.
        Anyway, it wasn't until a while afterwards that I decided that it
        should be published, and BMC stuck it in the N-Com.  So perhaps the
        reason it's so good, or at least so good to me, is because it wasn't
        written with the intention of being seen by loads of people, just
        one girl.  So there was nothing I was hiding in there (that's not to
        say I normally "hide" stuff from my readers, but there's always the
        chance I subconsciously censor myself - which hopefully I don't).
        Anyway, I really like "shh, it's secret," even if holly doesn't
        really like me.  Teehee!

  ada - how would you say your political beliefs have affected your writing?
        would you say that everything you write has a specific message
        directed at the reader?  have you ever written with no real purpose,
        only to experiment with the words themselves?

  lin - Although I'd consider myself very politically active, I don't really
        tend to mix my politics and writing too much.  At least not the
        stuff I've published online (at least I don't think I do).  I've
        written for political hardcopy zines before and written political
        poetry and articles, but you don't really see much of that in _ir_
        (except for crap like "Censor Me, Censor You," which was written
        before I really knew how to write).  I mean, I just don't see _ir_
        as a political zine (though at first I tried to take it in that
        direction, posting files "appreciated by me," written by other
        authors, that tended to be heavily political.  That phase died out
        really early on in the zine).  Most stuff I write started out as me
        just being bored and writing because there was nothing else to do,
        and sometimes the ending or direction a text takes is a delightful
        surprise to me.  Such is the case with "el duck!" in which I simply
        just got bored of writing half way through.  That story had a lot of
        potential, despite its retarded silliness, but I just couldn't bear
        to complete it.  I guess it's times like those that I'm writing just
        to experiment with words, in a sense.

  ada - one of my favorite pieces of yours is shh! it's secret!, published
        in the n-com's 198th issue.  i really liked the thought process of
        the narrator, the letter writing style, and how the emotion is
        conveyed.  do you find it easy or challenging to write about love,
        and other complex emotions?

  lin - Well, we've already touched on this a bit!  I don't really find it
        too challenging, in fact in all honesty, 70% of my writing (mainly
        poetry) is about love (I'm a hopeless romantic).  You just don't see
        these because they aren't published, but rather lost in the pages of
        my notebook.  So I don't really find it difficult to write about
        these emotions, but sometimes is sure is hard re-reading them after
        some traumatizing heartbreak, teehee.

  ada - do you find you label yourself into a particular genre of writing,
        i.e. poet, short fiction writer, etc.?  if so, which genre would you
        consider yourself to write predominantly in.  if not, where do you
        think your writing style fits in?

  lin - I guess mainly I'm a poet (I just don't really publish my poetry).
        Besides that, I'm not too sure how to define my writing.  But I
        always liked the idea of writing being "raw" and unpolished.  So if
        I have to fit into any style of writing, I hope it's "raw."  Besides
        that, I hope to be honest.  Even if I'm writing about kids with one
        legs and whore-mothers.

  ada - do you tend to write from your own perspective?

  lin - Sometimes.  But that can get me in trouble on those times I don't
        write in my perspective.  I remember some time after I wrote
        "Lovable Satan," some kid kept trying to "convince" me to drink
        alcohol.  I had to explain to him that yes, I have had alcohol
        before, yes, I do enjoy it, and no, just because the character in
        "Lovable Satan" hadn't even touched a drop of alcohol didn't mean I
        hadn't.  This isn't me bragging about alcohol consumption by the
        way (if you read "Only HACKERS Can Talk To linear," you know that
        people who talk about HOW MUCH THEY DRINK, HOW DRUNK THEY ARE just
        annoy me.  I was just using this instance as an example).

  ada - do you have the secret to happiness?

  lin - Yes, but so do you.

  ada - and that's all she wrote....well, all i wrote!!!  sorry this is so
        chaotic, i just have a million things to do before tomorrow...please
        forgive me!!!

  lin - You are forgiven!

  ada - THE END....

        hoped you enjoyed linear, you crazy n-com fans!!!

                                                                       ,o$o

  Margie - Dear Linear,

           I see that I too get questions!  I have been dilemma-ing over the
           past few days, writing questions to send to my interviewee.  I am
           glad to receive yours, I think they are a good set of questions,
           and I am excited to answer them.  Thus:

  linear - How'd you get such a creative alias?

  Margie - Well, I really don't remember.  I remember the time and place (a
           dank dark apartment on Superior St., in Victoria, BC), and what I
           was doing at the time, which was studying, and wishing dearly
           that I was less peripheral (as I said, Victoria BC, dank dark
           apartment on Superior St.).  Margarina, because it plays on the
           good old saintly names (Mary, Margaret, Magdalene, Madagascar)
           and is simultaneously un-real, and Cataclysma because she needed
           a last name that was slightly less grotty, a last name that would
           pick her up out of the gutter.

  linear - How long have you been apart of the text scene?

  Margie - I have always been apart from the text scene.  

  linear - What initially drew you into the text scene, and more generally,
           the online world?

  Margie - I don't know anything about the text scene.  Aside from an
           initial euphoric nose-dive into the internet,

           I have tried to dissociate myself from that putrifient morphing
           corpse, and I do try to limit my time there.  That said, I like
           it very much, and on rainy days or on days when I have burning
           questions, I like to go there and fiddle around.   

  linear - What is your relation to BMC?

  Margie - We are friends.  As you know, I rescued him from the hands of
           capitalism, once (it happens often; he is in her clutches), and
           so he really owes me a huge debt.  BMC and I live in the same
           town.  Sometimes he takes me out for lunch.  He likes french
           fries.  He talks a lot, drives erratically, and wears a Canadian
           Army parka, zipped up to the chin, even in the summer.  He
           dislikes Pantera.  He always has a smile.

  linear - Have you always enjoyed writing? When did you start?

  Margie - I have always enjoyed writing.  I was a precocious and prodigious
           reader, and so it naturally progressed into writing.  When I was
           in grade five, I wrote an anthropomorphic poem about chimpanzees
           and stuff which amused me greatly.  I wish I could remember it
           properly.  My mother might have the "manuscript" somewhere. 

  linear - What inspires you as a writer?

  Margie - There are a few circumstances: One, as a product of mulling
           things over, in the course of the day, whilst talking to myself,
           I might come across a phrase that sticks, or a particular wording
           that things seem to naturally flow around and from.  That is the
           miraculous creative event, it is kind of pure.  Two, because I
           have been reading something, some writer's work, and feel like
           writing something, and therefore what comes out of my fingers
           onto the screen may somehow imitate what I've read; may be homage
           to the individual or school that I have been reading.  Three, a
           need to explicate feelings/ideas as particularly as possible (the
           case that we are operating under right now).  Whether something
           in particular, some state or object or sense, will inspire, I
           cannot say or predict.  I guess I have certain preoccupations,
           and goals, and stuff, and if some experience that I have touches
           on that, then it probably gets wrote about.  Grocery stores,
           dogs, pigeons, yellow, a sneer, yelling, infirmity, Eurocrats,
           idylls.

  linear - Other than the text scene, what are your interests? 

  Margie - I have been learning French, that takes up quite a bit of time,
           what with reading and all.  I am also learning Chinese, that
           doesn't take up so much time because I haven't done any work
           there for, oh, a week.  I am interested in the grass-roots, in
           art, in creation, in obfuscation, in verity.  I am interested
           in the processes things undergo.  I have been working on a simple
           little biology degree for ages; I might develop an interest in
           biological statistics, just to justify myself.  I am an haphazard
           student of environments- urban, animal, forest, other
           specialized.  I like grammar, punctuation, semantics, etymology,
           and orthography.  Metal K. Dick is giving me lessons in the
           subject of Geography.  I have lately become interested in the
           politicization of individuals in a society which does not favour
           action, despite an ostensibly democratic system.  I have been an
           anarchist and an atheist since the 10th grade -- the Satanists
           from my homeroom and I argued about what was better, "Blizzard of
           Oz" or "Too Dark Park" -turns out we were both right.  I am an
           inveterate cinephile.  I am interested in modern and long ago
           cultures.  I will someday open a soup kitchen, and am gathering
           recipes for just this purpose.  I like martial arts.  I am an
           advocate of physical activity and a partisan of intellectual
           cooperation.  I like randomness but suspect that it is no
           substitute for concerted effort.

  linear - I've always considered "Cultural Deconstruction For Beginners" to
           be your greatest work, but BMC tells me that by the time it was
           printed in a hardcopy edition of the Neo-Comintern, you were
           embarrassed by it.  Can you justify this embarrassment in the
           face of such entertaining text?

  Margie - Yes, it is a crappy poem.  I also enjoy it, but I wrote it, of
           course I like it.  But it is a heavy handed manipulation of some
           imprecise, vague, huge concepts, none of which I really
           understand.  I can't really even properly define these sorts of
           post-modern ideas, let alone pontificate on topics.  I don't
           consider it but a step on some sort of personal poetic staircase,
           and as such it should maybe come with a disclaimer. 

  linear - What gave you the idea to start your advice columns?

  Margie - I think BMC wanted me to write something and I didn't want to
           write about Atlantis or turds or anything at all creative or
           real, and I didn't have any really good ideas, but I knew that if
           I wrote advice columns, that even though they were ostensibly
           about the questionner's problems, they would be mostly about me
           and my ideas: "Yes, that's all very fine and well, charming
           reader, now how about *me*??"

  linear - How'd you get so damn good at giving out advice?

  Margie - I have been an idiot for a million years.  

  linear - Remember that time you gave me advice?

  Margie - Not at all.  I don't have my hard-drive here.  ack.  Here I am, a
           truly callous jerk.  What did you ask?  How did I respond?  I
           remember not, Horatio.  Please remind me!

  linear - Oh. It didn't work.  What do you have to say for yourself?

  Margie - Um, I wish I knew what I'a telled you. 

  linear - Besides the Neo-Comintern, what other text 'zines do you enjoy?

  Margie - Well, lately, I have been very much not near computers, and so
           have not really looked at anything at all, there.  For the last
           few days I have been reading "Le Monde Diplomatique;" it is a
           leftish monthly newspaper, a pillar of the world press:
           http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/  Apparently the "Guardian
           Weekly" does an English language version of it.  Haven't checked,
           yet.  This month there is quite a bit of stuff about Africa.  A
           while ago, we bought a Marxist quarterly called "Contretemps",
           with essays on the rationales used to justify the wars, lately.
           The French seem to really like the traditional printing press
           type of thing.  There seems to be a good infrastructure which
           facilitates this sort of thing, unlike in the new world.  

  linear - This is a shameless plug: Your thoughts on that marvelous 'zine
           Impulse Reality?

  Margie - Well, I have to go back, I was there today, for the first time,
           for three minutes, at the internet cafe, and so I didn't get a
           chance to do it justice.  There were some appealing tag-lines, I
           want to read further.  What do you think I should download to
           floppy next time I'm at the internet cafe?  Perhaps things that
           you think I'd be interested in, knowing me as you do (now), or
           things that you think are most interesting, or representative.    

  linear - Have you ever written for 'zines other than the N-Com?

  Margie - NO, may I?  I thought that I had become the exclusive property of
           The BMC (tm registered)!

  linear - How's life in Europe?

  Margie - Pretty good, rainy here in Belgique.  Reside in heart of
           burgeoning Eurocratic district, central Brussels, this month.
           Brussels has only 900 thousand people, did you know?  It is truly
           a small town.  Most of the traditional occupants (the Flemish)
           have moved out to avoid the unsightly ridiculousness of the EU,
           the immigrants, and what have you.  It is an interesting,
           ghost-town-ish place.  Lots of things to explore, see, touch,
           look at.  Also the long-time world capital of la bande dessinee
           (comix), as you know.

  linear - Ever plan on returning home?

  Margie - July 18, 2002.  

  linear - Am I hip? C'mon, be honest.

  Margie - Yes.  You mustn't worry about this question.  You are as hip as
           the day you were born.  You are as hip as a bug on a leaf.  You
           are as hip as a shadow.  You are as hip as an infectious
           disease.  You are as hip as the fastest man on earth.  You are as
           hip as your mother, and the billions of generations that preceded
           you.  You are as hip as everyone in the world wants to be.  You
           are as hip as that old man who walks half-bent over, with a cane
           in each hand, and the funny pants.  You are as hip as Robert
           Crumb's brother.  Hip schmip.  

  linear - I'm giving you this space to discuss (in great detail if need be)
           anything you feel should have been addressed but wasn't, due to
           my poor interview skills, and the circumstances surrounding this
           interview. What do you have to say for yourself, missy?

  Margie - The following is an un-paid public service announcement:  

           Are you a greedy bastard?  I would like to remind each of you
           that the world is a precarious and delicate place, much like a
           flower or the delicate leg of a bug.  It is as nice as a baby
           puppy and as special as the most unique snowflake.  It is
           inhabited by a million thousand zillion creatures, all of whom
           are very precious, as are you.  So do something, dammit.

           What I have for you next is a Paranoid Fantasy, the 98th in a
           randomly numbered series.  There is some debate, around here, as
           to whether it has any redeeming value.

          Paranoid Fantasy #98.

           I am the kid who had the seizures.  But it wasn't like they
           said.  It had nothing to do with the game.  It wasn't because I
           played all the time.  I didn't play that much.  People said that
           my parents were lenient, too lenient.  That's not true.  I didn't
           play the game that much.  And also people were saying that I
           didn't eat healthy food.  But that is a lie too.  It wasn't like
           they said it was at all.

           My dad wasn't at home.  Our dad.  He was at work.  My mom works
           too, but only on Tuesdays.  The rest of the time she takes care
           of us.  It wasn't Tuesday though, she was there with me.  My
           brother was at school most of the day, probably.  I wasn't in
           school yet.  I was only three.  He was 8.

           People say that I can't remember it because I was too small but
           they are wrong.  I remember perfectly well.  I remember that it
           was a sunny day.  The windows were open.  I used to count red
           cars sometimes on the freeway.

           My family is normal.  Except for we are not the same as families
           are supposed to be.  Which is apparently the problem.  We are not
           natural and it shorted out my brain.  That's not true.

           We have a lot of stuff.  We are not really rich, but we have
           things because that is what money is for.  You buy the stuff you
           want with it.  And my mother says that if not for us that her
           purpose on this earth would be nothing, and my father too.  She
           would be a nothing otherwise.

           She is not a small woman.  I mean, she is short, but she has big
           muscles.  She is the one that saved me.  She pushed me out of the
           way just in time.  My dad says that it is because of her that we
           are like we are.  Her family comes from the north.  My dad says
           that they are cunning and strong, but not very fast, which is a
           weird combination.  He says that I'm the same way.  But my
           brother is not.  This he told me later.  Since then my dad says
           that he has to come home earlier on the weekdays.

           What happened was this.  I was waiting for my brother to come
           home.  My mother was sitting at the table, she was writing
           something.  I was walking back and forth.  Sometimes I sing, and
           I think I was singing.  The television was on and I was singing
           to it.

           My mother too.  Then my brother got home and my mother made him a
           soup bowl and then that took some time but I wanted him to play.
           He hit me on the head with his book while he was eating, because
           I was holding his leg and I was bugging him.  My mom told me to
           go watch t.v. while she talked to my brother.  So I did, but I
           put in the game cause its better than t.v., and then I picked Ork
           cause I like his eyes and the way he jumps, and then we were
           running, and I remember that, but I don't remember anything else
           after that.  That's all I remember.

           I didn't have to go to school even the next year when the other
           kids my age did, not for a long time, cause I was still in the
           machine.  I couldn't wear any clothes because it was too hot.  My
           mom tried to read me books but she didn't really know what it was
           like.  I tried to touch her on the cheek so that she would feel
           better, but it gave her a shock, and so then I just curled up
           near the edge where she was.  She slept on the floor next to me
           for a long time.

           I was very glad because my vital signs were low.  I tried to give
           her the thumbs up sometimes so she'd know that I was still good.
           My brother said that I was a zombie but I know that I am on the
           good side, even if I wear a mask.  I am glad that we won.

           The End.

                                                                       ,o$o

  Margie - What are your vital statistics?  

  Bu Joe - Well I live in Canada, I've just turned 18, I'm a boy; a sexy
           one.  I'm not the type that would steal your wallet, push you
           into a mud pile, then lead an old lady to walk over you so her
           shoes won't get dirty, and then push her off of you into the
           mud.  There's no need for those kinds of shenanigans, you know?
           I'd just rather ask you to help me help her or do it myself.

  Margie - How do you see the Neo-Comintern relative to your own grand plan? 

  Bu Joe - I see the N-Com as a good way to share some of my ideas and
           stories with a lot of people.  Like I could write this radical,
           totally out there story and people would read it, instead of
           turning up their noses.  It really is a wacky zine.

  Margie - Is writing a temporary passtime while you prepare yourself for a
           family and a house and two point 3 dogs and a satellite dish?  

  Bu Joe - Simply, it's just one spectacular place to vent.  I try to throw
           away everything, my insecurities, and worries, just try to open
           myself up and let it pour out.  I just might create something
           that will let me share the things I have learned with others, but
           I don't think I've done that yet.

  Margie - Do you share the mandate of the Neo-Comintern's editorial
           "staff," which as far as I can tell, and this might be a
           bastardization of a summary, is to disseminate revolutionary
           vibes via absurdity?  Or, have you been told something different?  

  Bu Joe - I 100% think that as a race we need to stop and rethink what we
           REALLY want to achieve and how we're going to do it.  Does that
           answer your question?

  Margie - Where do you get your information?  Be specific with regard to
           the sources themselves, their frequency, quantity, the duration
           of your interactions with them, the accuracy of the information
           you glean from each of them, and of course quality: 

           -independent pamphleteers
           -newspapers
           -radio
           -television
           -network advertising (bus shelters, freeway signs, magazines,
            etc.)
           -books
           -internet
           -dinner table conversations
           -direct observation
            etc.

  Bu Joe - I just look around and see, I guess.  I don't have like a ritual
           where I have to read a certain paper to tell me what's happening.
           I kind of like just get little tidbits here and there from
           what's around me.
  
  Margie - What are your observations on the publishing industry? 

  Bu Joe - LOTS of people are trying to get published.

  Margie - Is it necessary for individuals (such as you or your neighbor) to
           be politicized in this era, or is it enough to live a good life? 

  Bu Joe - I think it depends on the person.  I myself need to be, but a lot
           of other people would rather just ignore it, let someone else do
           it, which kind of sucks because I think if everyone was a little
           more in tune they might have a very different view on things.

  Margie - When you write are you concerned with:

           -audience perception (being amusing, etc.)
           -clear presentation of topic
           -intentional obfuscation of topic for stylistic reasons
           -word play
           -entertaining yourself
           -purging yourself of some idea which has been pestering/plagueing
            you
           -carrying on a grand tradition
           -experimentation
           -pleasing the editor/disturbing the editor
           -interpreting your own cosmos
           -interpreting the general cosmos
            etc.

  Bu Joe - Well the first draft I worry about nothing but getting the words
           out of my head, for me and me alone.  Then if I feel like sharing
           I will go through it and tweak for the reader.  I'd really like
           to write a story that allowed me to solve something for myself
           and the reader to learn from my problem and either work out one
           of their problems or avoid one.  Words can trigger emotions and
           feelings and I'd really like to master that.

  Margie - From reading the works of your contemporaries, what trends will
           predominate within this world of words in the years to come as
           everyone matures?  What do you hope to observe coming out of this
           milieu?

  Bu Joe - AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. I hope that
           writing will forever be a way to share knowledge and entertain.
           Hahaha what a dumb answer.

  Margie - (Question from Metal K. Dick) What is your favorite story about
           fascists?

  Bu Joe - WWII, I love it.  I can't get enough of it.  It's the most
           interesting topic in history next to the French Revolution.

  Margie - Do you see fascists everywhere -- lurking behind parked cars,
           peeking around your soda cup, thronging the pub on the corner,
           backward-masking lyrics and perverting nature? 

  Bu Joe - I do, but not your nazi type, the ones that judge without
           knowledge and slander without reason.  I'm sure you know the
           type.

  Margie - Is it possible to become more or less cynical?  If so, how would
           one move in either direction?  Does cynicism accompany maturity?

  Bu Joe - Well I think people can change anything except their shoe size.
           I think if a cynical person could feel and see that being cynical
           just isn't really a good way to live a life they could change but
           the best way is a karma realization/slap in the face.

  Margie - Who is your hero?  

  Bu Joe - My best friend.  I have learned many a great thing from that man.

  Margie - If you had a problem and couldn't figure out how to solve it,
           what would you do? 

  Bu Joe - I'd ask my friends and hope they could help me with it.

  Margie - I realize that this interview is not as fun as if, some person
           from the Neo-Comintern "staff" was giggling at you while drinking
           all of your gin, but I can only try.  Is there anything else you
           would like to say for your self?  Perhaps there is something that
           you would like to expound upon a bit?  What are your personal
           obsessions?

  Bu Joe - I just want to spread the joy.

  Margie - You strike me as a cheerful fellow.  Why are you so dard blamed
           cheerful?

  Bu Joe - Well I just see the beauty of life, I guess.  I have my grumpy
           days like everyone else, but I figure there's better things to be
           done then walk around pissed off and in turn pissing off others.

  Margie - This plan of the editorial "staff," to get us to communicate and
           bring us closer together, what, do you think it will work? 

  Bu Joe - Perhaps, but nonetheless I have enjoyed it.

  Margie - You have removed your works from public display -- the links are
           dead, folks.  Is this because you are, and I surely hope that you
           are not, discouraged?  Have you changed immensely?  In what ways?  

  Bu Joe - Well the sites sort of naturally got lost; at first I was sad,
           but then sort of happy.  I didn't really like the way I had
           written some of the articles; the message I believe in, but the
           quality of the writing I don't like.  If, say by magic, they
           reappeared, I wouldn't be bothered; I just might like to revise.
           lol
  
  Margie - What have you been working on lately? 

  Bu Joe - I REALLY want to write a play.

  Margie - What do you think about this fact:  Eighty percent of college
           freshies believe that they will be millionaires at some point in
           their lifetime.

  Bu Joe - I think they thought that before they got to college.

  Margie - What do you think about this fact:  As you know, the inhabitants
           of the Americas suffered terrible tragic losses after European
           contact, due to smallpox and influenza.  Some historians think
           that, in return (as it were), native Americans gave their new
           friends syphilis to take back to Europe with them.  Additionally,
           and not fatally, of course, but bizarrely, the native Americans
           did not have pubic or other body hair until same era.  The
           genetic material for the characteristic is also transmitted by a
           virus, integrating into the host genome at the time of puberty.  

  Bu Joe - *hums the twilight zone theme*  Freaky.

  Margie - What do you think about this fact: Five of the world's richest
           people belong to the Walton family. 

  Bu Joe - Who the hell are the Waltons?  Seriously.

  Margie - If you could go anywhere in the world for one year, where would
           you go, and why?  What circumstances would have to transpire in
           order for you to do this?

  Bu Joe - Now I say France, but I've never been there so I can't say if I'd
           like to stay.  I'd really enjoy backpacking Europe though; I just
           love the look of European cities.  I'd just need to get there and
           be able to survive while I am there.  Getting back might be a
           good idea too.

  Margie - What would you sacrifice for the sake of something more
           important?

  Bu Joe - My life.

  Margie - What about this world, this world we live in, most impresses
           you?

  Bu Joe - The potential we all have to really understand a lot of things
           more important than a comfortable retirement.  And the beauty of
           life, I really can't get over how marvelous life is.

  Margie - You say that you are sometimes a socialist.  Are your views and
           opinions still evolving? 

  Bu Joe - Yes, very much so.  Everyday I learn SO many new things.  I don't
           really know if I am a socialist or not.  I want people not to
           have to worry about nonsense and have to feel pain over nonsense
           too.  I'd like us all to understand that we have so much to learn
           from each other.  And I think that we are truly equal in the way
           that we all have the same mind capable of the same things.  Yes
           some people are smarter than others, but if you meet them with an
           open mind you'll see that their knowledge can become your
           knowledge and that goes back to my saying that we really can
           learn a lot from each other; I think that creates the equality,
           the fact that we're all conscious to learn our own life lessons
           and maybe teach a few along the way.

  Margie - Does it drive you slightly crazy: the lag time between 1998 and
           today?

  Bu Joe - Nah, I'm really lovin every second of it, even the seconds I
           hate, I later love.

  Margie - Why drink cola at all? 

  Bu Joe - I like how it bubbles in my mouth, but GO WATER!  It's one of the
           sources of life, you know.

                                                                       ,o$o

  Bu Joe - Can you tell us about the lovely city of Saskatoon you call home
           and all the goods on yourself?

  Heckat - Well, both fortunately and unfortunately, my home is not
           Saskatoon anymore.  At least, my physical home isn't Saskatoon
           (but Saskatoon will always be the home of my heart).  Right now,
           I hang my cat in Fredericton, New Brunswick.  Oh, I guess the
           saying is "I hang my hat."  I don't have a hat though.  I also
           don't really "hang" my cat.  It's just a saying.

           I love Saskatoon although many people hate it, including the
           people who live there.  It is a cold city in the winter and it
           sits in the middle of the prairies.  A lot of people hate the
           prairies but I don't.  A creative writing professor of mine once
           said, "Living on the prairies is like having the top of your head
           taken off with a can opener."  He meant that the prairies are the
           best place to let your brain out of its protective casing and run
           free.  Flat land breeds creativity.  No ceiling, no bars.
           Space.

           One good thing about Saskatoon is this grotto-style house on
           University Drive that I would like to live in some day.  I have
           never been inside but I've walked by it many times.  It's a dark
           olive green with huge windows in the front.

           But actually, the best part about Saskatoon is my friends there
           and the University of Saskatchewan.  My friends in Saskatoon are
           more like my family.  All of them are part of the N-Com scene.
           We make supper together.  Hang out in Melatonin's backyard making
           a fire.  Go out drinking.  Make movies together.  Go camping.
           Recite various scenes from movies.  Give each other long lectures
           on our passion of the day.  (sometimes we even invite Cog along).
           ada and I make our own zine together (Backyard Ashes) that I talk
           to linear about later in this interview.  The other thing I love
           is the U of S.  But actually, that's because of the people there.
           Oh, don't get me wrong, the buildings are excellent and old, but
           the people are the best.  All my favourite professors are there 
           and my favourite grad students too.  Oh, and I had a wonderful 
           apartment there too.  The best ever.

           But now I live in Fredericton.  I hate my landlord for one.  And
           I don't like the classes I'm taking at the university here.  And
           the library sucks.  Other than that, the people are very nice.  I
           already have some friends here even though I've only been here
           one month.  The city is BEAUTIFUL.  That's the best part about
           it.  It's woodsy and small and the squirrels run free.  I like
           the grad students and one professor so far.

           The "goods" on me are as follows.  I'm a girl (er, woman, er guy
           - apparently the word "guy" is now gender neutral).  BMC and I
           are, how do you call it?, an "item."  We live together in
           Fredericton and we have one small grey cat named Rahula.  I'm
           currently getting my Ph.D. in English literature and I'm writing
           my thesis on Canadian Women's speculative fiction.  That's all
           the boring stuff about the writer behind the persona.

  Bu Joe - What are some of your plans as a writer?  I know you go to
           university; do you think you'll ever teach English?  Or any
           subject?

  Heckat - My plans as a writer are twofold.  I want to write poetry
           primarily.  I would like to have a book of my own stuff someday.
           My other goal is to publish academic articles.  I have one
           article that a journal is reviewing for the second time.  So
           it'll probably get published there.

           Hmm, this reminds me of a story.  I love the anthology "The
           Year's Best in Fantasy and Horror."  One year I read a story by
           Kelly Link; it was called "Travels with the Snow Queen."  I LOVED
           that story.  I photocopied it and gave copies of it to my
           friends.  Kelly Link became my new hero.  Then, last April, I
           went to this conference in the United States.  It was a science
           fiction conference and guess who was there?  That's right.  Kelly
           Link.  She read one of her stories in one of the sessions at the
           conference.  I wanted to meet her a lot, but I was too shy.  Now
           here's where the story gets good.  I went to the book room and I
           saw a bunch of independently published print zines!  This was
           soooo exciting for me and I kept wishing that BMC had come along
           with me to the conference.  I didn't have money to buy the zines,
           so I had to wait until later.  On the last day of the conference
           I went to buy copies of the magazines.  When I got there I saw
           Kelly Link and she was with this guy and they were taking all
           the copies of the zines away!  I was sad that I didn't get a
           chance to buy one, but I decided to approach them and talk to
           them.  It turned out that they produce a lot of their own
           publications and that the story "Travels with the Snow Queen" was
           first published in a zine!  Wow!  The guy that Kelly Link was
           with turned out to be her husband and he is very involved in the
           underground publishing scene in the United States.  We've kept in
           touch ever since and ada and I published one of his poems in the
           latest issue of Backyard Ashes.  So, I guess the point of this
           story is that the world is really small and independent
           publishing is really important, so keep supporting the N-Com and
           other small-press publications that you love.

           Oh yeah, and I was supposed to talk about teaching too.  Yeah, I
           want to teach someday.  I want to bring science fiction into the
           classroom.  I'd love to get a job at a university when I finish
           my Ph.D.

  Bu Joe - I remember BMC mentioning you were writing a paper on
           Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus and might have something to share
           on some sexist issues.  Do you?

  Heckat - Yeah, that was my Master's thesis actually.  I analyzed gender
           roles in the play and how stereotypes of femininity and
           masculinity are destructive to individuals as well as society as
           a whole.  This still holds true for our time.  We haven't, by
           far, overcome the notion that women are somehow, because of
           biology, inferior to men.  I believe firmly in gender equality.
           I hate it when women are belittled by either being turned into
           one-dimensional sex-objects or condemned and hated because they
           don't meet male expectations of who they should be.  Sexist and
           misogynist attitudes actually make no sense to me at all.  I
           can't really understand where the idea that women are inferior to
           men comes from.  It seems perfectly apparent to me that some
           women are smarter, stronger, more emotionally capable, and more
           insightful than some men.  Of course, some men are smarter,
           stronger, more emotionally capable, and more insightful than some
           women.  Individuals cannot be defined by stereotypes, especially
           when a person is confronted on a daily basis with exceptions to
           the stereotype.  I think that a lot of people don't realize that
           these gendered expectations are destructive to men as well as to
           women.  Many men don't fit into the alpha-male stereotype - take
           your pick: the football-playing muscleman, the toughguy, the sex
           addict, the cutting-edge business executive.  Most of these roles
           are condescending to men, moulding them into uncontrollable,
           violent, power-hungry animals with no emotional stability.

           In short, I guess I have a lot to say about sexism.  I'm not sure
           that I can change anybody's mind with an answer to one interview
           question.  I wish, though, in general, that people would think
           more about the gendered construction of their own identity.  (For
           instance, I'll address one of my own confrontations with sexism
           in the next question.)

  Bu Joe - I recently found out that Margarina planted trees and was
           wondering if you've ever wanted to go plant trees?

  Heckat - I thought about it for a while.  I don't know, I don't think it's
           really the thing for me.  I like the thought of physical work in
           theory, but I guess I choose intellectual work instead pretty
           much 100% of the time.  Margarina is really unique because she
           does both intellectual and physical work; I admire her for that.

           I used to think if I was a man I would probably be a carpenter.
           I realized, however, that I was being sexist.  I assumed that if
           I was a man I wouldn't be able to do anything but use my muscles.
           I thought that if I was a man I probably wouldn't be smart
           anymore and wouldn't want to go to school.  I realized later that
           if I was a man I would probably NOT be a carpenter (even though
           it sounds like a great job because you get to work outside on
           houses all summer with your shirt off and get a great tan) but I
           would probably be doing the same thing I am now.  Because I'd be
           the same person inside.  But I'd be a man.

  Bu Joe - Do know Gnarly Wayne personally?  And can you make some comments
           on his apparent drinking problem?

  Heckat - Oh, hmm.  I'm not sure what to say about Gnarly Wayne.  Do you
           know that we used to go to high school together?  Weird.  He
           moved away and I didn't see him again for a long time.  Then, I
           met BMC at university years later and I found out that he was
           friends with Wayne and that Wayne from high school was the same
           Wayne as Gnarly Wayne from the N-Com.  Coincidence?  Who knows.

           I don't know anything about Wayne's supposed drinking problem.  I
           don't think it bothers him if people think he's an alcoholic
           because he seems to promote the idea himself.

  Bu Joe - Do you ever want to have children?  And if so would you name them
           strange names?  Like ones that are really out there?

  Heckat - Wow, I had this really weird dream last night that BMC and I had
           a daughter but we kept forgetting about her.  We would go to
           school in the morning and leave the baby by herself.  I would run
           into BMC at university and ask him, "Did you feed the baby this
           morning?"  And he would say, "No, I thought you did."  It was
           weird.  We didn't name the baby anything at all.  She was ignored
           and nameless.  I woke up quite horrified and scared and now I
           might be off the idea of children for life.

           But, actually I might want to have children some day.  I think it
           would be pretty great actually.  One of my profs just had a baby
           and I ran into her today when she was with him.  He was sitting
           on the floor playing with her keys and he was the sweetest
           thing.  Then he crawled over to the garbage can and started to
           eat the plastic bag.  That was cool.

           I used to think that if I had kids I would have a boy and I would
           name him Ivy.  Everybody hated that name except me and I was
           obsessed with it.  My grandma said to me once, "If you name a boy
           a girl's name he'll turn out to be a sissy."  Yeah, my
           grandmother wasn't a very critical thinker.  She liked those
           gender roles as tightly traditional as they get.  I liked the
           idea of having a son whose name would tell people that his
           parents didn't care about gender.  I've since changed my mind
           about the name Ivy.  Not because of my philosophy, that's still
           the same, but I just don't like the name Ivy anymore.

           It might be funny to name children as if their names were
           aliases.  Like I could name my son Phalanx or something.  I tried
           to get BMC to agree to name our future boy-child d'Artagnan, but
           he didn't want to name a kid after the fourth member of the three
           musketeers.  That would be like dooming the kid to a lifetime of
           being an outsider.  My brother once said that if he had a kid he
           would name it Unit-9.

           Right now I have a file on my computer called "names I like."  In
           it are names of pets and maybe children too.  My next cat's name
           will be Coyote.  I also like Ghazal, Syracuse and Prufrock as pet
           names.  Moriarity might be cool for a cat.  For a girl, I like
           Genevieve and Astrid.  For a boy, hmm, I'm just not sure
           anymore.  All my past ideas haven't added up to much.  BMC says
           he likes Vladimir, Igor, and Tennessee Williams.  It looks like
           we have some negotiating to do.

  Bu Joe - What would you rather drive? 

           A) A purple station wagon with a bunch of purple sequins on the
           outside, purple fun fur lining, a hot pink fun fur steering wheel
           and a giant hot pink caterpillar on the top.

           B) A Volkswagen beetle, that was airbrushed to look like a giant
           skull, with blood stained tires, fake bodies parts all over,
           blood splatters, a giant metal spike mohawk and a Mack truck
           horn.

  Heckat - Can't I just have a bicycle built for two?

  Bu Joe - Do you consider yourself a politically active person?  If yes,
           what are some of your views?

  Heckat - I don't think I can legitimately call myself politically active
           in all good conscience.  I'm very interested in politics and
           social consciousness, but I get very disheartened at the cynical
           world full of power-grubbing greedy capitalists so I mostly stay
           out of it.  I used to be a member of the supposed left-wing
           political party in Canada, the NDP.  I voted in a local
           leadership election for the candidate who would have implemented
           a lot of wonderful changes in Saskatchewan.  She didn't win, of
           course.  The man who did win is OK, but he's pretty
           conservative.  Nothing much changed after he got elected and so I
           didn't renew my membership.

           I've been to peace rallies and peace marches, but I started to
           become very frustrated at the lack of impact those actions have
           in the world.  Basically, the option I feel I'm left with is
           individualistic and microcosmic.  I try to do my best to live up
           to my ideals.  This involves really minor things like recycling
           and not eating meat.  It also means that I have to speak up when
           I feel that something goes against my beliefs and I have to think
           about the impact of my actions on the world and I have to analyze
           the impact of actions that other people take.  I don't believe in
           telling other people what to do, but I do believe that you have
           to stand up for what you believe in.  I think that if you explain
           to people the philosophy behind your way of life they'll be more
           receptive to your ideas.  I'm not into conversion or mission work
           (both religious words that I believe can also apply to any
           situation where a group of people tries to force their beliefs on
           another group of people or on an individual); these seem to me
           like forms of colonization.  It seems like common sense to me,
           though, that we would all want to live in a world free from
           poverty, desperation, and economic fundamentalism.

  Bu Joe - Chocolate or Vanilla?  Coke or Pepsi?  Rare steak or Tofu?
           McDonalds or Burger King?

  Heckat - I like chocolate soy milk, but I hate chocolate ice cream.  I
           like vanilla breakfast drinks, but I hate vanilla air
           fresheners.  I like strawberry old-fashioned soda.

           What are Coke and Pepsi?  Just kidding, I like no-name cola.

           Rare steak?  Does anybody actually eat that stuff?  I'll take
           Tofu.

           Hmmm, I've eaten at both McDonalds and Burger King.  I don't like
           to support either of them though.  They both have veggie-burgers
           now, which is good, but somehow I don't think that means that
           either corporation is enlightened.

                                           *

  Margie - Hi Heckat!  I know you are a thoughtful person!  What impression
           do you have of Bu Joe after reading his interview?  If you could
           ask him one question, what would it be?

  Heckat - I think that Bu Joe should write for HOE because he's certainly a
           Hog Of Entropy.  Oh, but HOE isn't around anymore. . . come to
           think of it, that release-rate seems like the perfect pace for Bu
           Joe.  hee hee

           But seriously, it's difficult for me to think of a question that
           I would ask Bu Joe because I really like all the questions that
           you asked him.  Especially the ones about fascists.  I feel like
           copping out and asking something like "If your mother were a
           hippopotamus and your father were a giraffe, what kind of animal
           would you be?"  Or, "What colour is your favourite pair of
           socks?"  Maybe, just maybe, if I wanted to be really cheezy
           philosophical I would ask him what his number one reason for
           getting out of bed in the morning is.  This is particularly
           relevant for those days when a person doesn't want to get out of
           bed, when they would rather spend the entire day sleeping and
           hiding from the world.  I would want to know whether or not he
           actually gets up on those days or whether he continues sleeping.
           And I would also want to know, if he DOES get out of bed, what he
           thinks of that finally helps him to make that leap from under the
           sheets to under the shower.

           OK, but last, I would REALLY ask him if he's ever heard the
           saying "the proof is in the pudding" and if it means anything to
           him.

  Margie - Ok, Heckat, what is your secret for living in peace and
           harmony?

  Heckat - Peace and harmony?  I don't think I've ever quite mastered that
           lifestyle.  Oh, that's not fair because I'm just being bitter
           because I'm stressed out right now and tired and I'm a bit
           lonely.  The real answer to the question resides in Saskatoon.  I
           think my life before I moved to Fredericton was pretty utopic.  I
           especially liked it when you and Metal K. came back from Europe
           and I got to hang out with you guys.  The summer was terribly
           hectic and I wrote a lot of academic stuff and I had to spend a
           lot of time in my office, but in my off-hours I got to be with
           people I love.  AHHH that sounds so goofy, but I do believe that
           the secret for living in peace and harmony has GOT to be
           community.  There's no doubt about that in my mind.  That's what
           I've missed the most since BMC and I moved to Fredericton.  I
           feel so "individual" here.  There's power in numbers, so they
           say.  For me, that power isn't about ruling the world (although
           if the N-Com staff DID rule the world things might be a lot
           better than they are now), but it is about empowering our
           community to be strong, get the most out of life, and thrive
           happily.

  Margie - What are the characteristics of a superior human being?

  Heckat - I once saw an episode of "The Outer Limits" where this guy had
           nanobots injected into his bloodstream and they started improving
           his body, making him into a superior human being.  At first,
           everything was great for him.  His muscles started developing;
           his cardiovascular system became strong; he grew hair where he
           used to be bald.  Then, however, things started getting weird.
           Because he was doing a lot of underwater swimming, the nanobots
           constructed gills for him so that he could breathe underwater AND
           on land.  He even got eyes in the back of his head!  It was
           gross!  I guess we can chalk this up to another cautionary tale
           about the dangers of human interference with nature.

  Margie - Please describe for me, using words, keeping gestures to a
           minimum and neglecting the noun of the thing, the living organism
           nearest you at this instant.

  Heckat - There is a certain noun that lives with me who was lying on the
           linen trunk a minute ago.  She has since trotted off to the
           kitchen to see if she can get some lovely crunchy food to eat.
           You may feel that because I used a form of the verb "to trot" I
           am speaking of a horse.  But you would be mistaken.

  linear - What inspired you to start your hardcopy zine Backyard Ashes?

  Heckat - ada and BMC and I first met in a creative writing class.  BMC
           showed us a print copy of the N-Com to show off and flirt and
           make us want to be friends with him.  It worked.  After that we
           always wanted our own print zine, but we wanted to improve on his
           model so that we could get better friends than him.

  linear - For those of us who don't know, maybe you should explain what
           exactly the zine is, and what its goals are.

  Heckat - I'm not sure if ada will be asked this or not, so this might
           cover ground that has already, well, been covered, but here goes
           nothing.  Backyard Ashes is a poetry/fiction/art zine that has
           now released three issues.  We generally put out an issue every
           six months.  Our next issue is due in December.  If anyone out
           there is sick and tired of submitting to the Neo-Comintern, they
           can submit their poetry and short stories and black and white art
           to us!!!  Hee hee, I didn't really mean to subvert the N-Com
           there.

           Our goals are fairly diverse at the moment.  Our manifest mandate
           is to publish writers who are in limbo, who haven't broken out
           into the "legitimate" world of literary publication, and to
           create community for isolated voices.  We also like to have a lot
           of fun.  In the future, we'd like to maybe procure some funding
           grants, improve the look of the zine with a colour cover page,
           and receive more submissions.  The zine is pretty nice I think.
           The format is working for us so far and we've received a lot of
           compliments on layout and design.

           I'm sure BMC would help us out by providing a link to our website
           on the "Friends of the N-Com" page, but, alas, we do not have a
           website yet.  Cog was supposed to make one for us and we took him
           out for supper in anticipation of all his hard work (we wanted to
           thank him in advance) but he never delivered the finished
           product!  We still hope to have a website in the near future.
           Keep a lookout for the link.

  linear - What would you say are the advantages of a hardcopy medium as
           opposed to an electronic based one?

  Heckat - Hmm, that's hard for me to say.  The internet definitely has the
           advantage of making information available to a huge audience;
           however, sometimes it can be difficult to draw that audience
           because surfing the net is often like sifting through a garbage
           heap.  Print mediums are friendly because you can hold them and
           read them in bed and spill coffee or soup on them.  Each magazine
           is a little artifact because there are a limited number of them.
           I like that.

           To tell you the truth, though, the reason ada and I produce a
           hardcopy zine instead of an electronic zine is that neither of us
           are that good with webdesign.  We can come out with a
           sharp-looking print zine that is more aesthetically appealing
           than most other hard-copy zines, but we wouldn't be able to
           produce something comparable if we had to work with html code.
           Oh, one other thing is that with a print zine there isn't the
           same pressure to publish one issue a week.  It seems electronic
           zines have to be updated fairly quickly or people lose interest
           in them (maybe it's also a sign that their editors have lost
           interest).  With a print zine, a bi-annual publication is
           standard.  It gives us time to receive submissions, go through
           them, have a dialogue with our contributors, and format the zine
           until it looks great.

           In short, I think it's best to try to combine the mediums.  I
           like the way the N-Com is both an electronic zine and a hardcopy
           zine.  ada and I would also like to blend the benefits of the
           internet with our zine by getting a webpage that could inform
           people of the print, how to order, submit, etc.

  linear - If I was over at your house, and BMC wasn't around, would you
           sleep with me?

  Heckat - Yes.

           Oops, did I answer that too quickly?  I mean, BMC and I have, how
           do you call it, an "open" relationship.  So I don't think he
           would mind, even if he was around.

           OK, OK, actually Lancelot, Arthur and I don't have an open
           relationship, but I'm not sure how to answer this question
           because, to tell you the truth, I have a huge crush on you.  By
           asking me this, linear dear, you've set my heart a flutter and
           taken my breath away.  I've always fantasized about moving down
           to the south-west coast, becoming your California girl, and going
           on the dole - smoking pot, surfing all day, and lazing around
           your Beverly Hills 90210-style condo on the beach.

           Ah, but I know these dreams can only come true when I close my
           eyes in bed at night.  You're too popular with the girls, linear,
           and I know you would only break my heart.  I think, then, that
           I'll have to settle for BMC for now.  Yes, he's witty; yes, he's
           handsome; and yes, he's even good in bed; but, oh, he never
           cleans up after himself.  You know what I mean?

  linear - What is the editorial process like? How do you decide what makes
           it and what doesn't?

  Heckat - ada and I go over everything together.  Our process is fairly
           unscientific.  We take what we like and we pass up what we don't
           particularly like.  Sometimes one of us likes something and the
           other doesn't.  We usually have a bit of a debate at that time,
           going over our viewpoints.  In the end, we make a decision we
           both agree on.  We work by consensus.  Most of the time we meet
           at one of our homes.  Sometimes we order pizza and stare at the
           guy across the courtyard lifting weights in his apartment.
           Sometimes it's too hot outside and so we go out for ice cream or
           swim in ada's pool instead of working.  We've also been known to
           talk, laugh, drink beer, gossip, tell secrets about boys, make
           supper, or commiserate about our problems with our friend Jen
           instead of working.  Those things happen, but in the end we
           always meet our deadlines somehow.  We're both very dedicated to
           the zine.  This third issue really proved that to me.  In the
           middle of the summer I was working on my thesis, studying for a
           French exam, getting ready to move, and trying to tie up the
           loose ends at my job.  ada was equally busy.  We still managed,
           in the midst of chaos, to come out with what we both feel is a
           brilliant issue.

  linear - What's the cost to produce something like Backyard Ashes?  Do you
           usually end up profiting, breaking even, or losing income?

  Heckat - We ALWAYS lose money!  That's the nature of the publishing
           world.  Unless you have someone filling your pocket with money
           (i.e. the government or business advertising), you're going to
           have to do your best with the loose change you've got kicking
           around.  Having two investors rather than one helps.  ada and I
           split all our costs.  The zine usually costs around $1 per issue
           to produce.  Our last print-run was 300.  We sell the zine for
           $3, but, of course, we don't sell even close to half of them, let
           alone all of them.  We give a lot of them away to interested
           parties, family, contributors, etc.  We give them away to
           potential contributors sometimes.  Our launch is our most
           successful way to get back some of the money we spent.  Usually
           we have a pretty good turnout.  I think we got back $80 for issue
           #2.  We were very happy with that.  It helps with the cost of the
           next zine and we can use it to mail letters or buy supplies, like
           a long-reach stapler.
  
  linear - How long can you hold your breath?

  Heckat - When I was a kid, my grandparents had a pool.  I became a very
           good swimmer at a young age because they lived across the street
           from us.  My grandpa would watch me practice swimming.  My
           favourite thing to practice was swimming the length of the pool
           underwater.  By the time I was four or so I could swim a lap
           without taking one breath.  After I had mastered that task, I had
           a new goal.  I wanted to swim one lap of the pool underwater in
           less than 1 second.  I had no idea how long a second was.  I
           hadn't learned to tell time yet.  All I knew was that a second
           was very short and that if I could swim a lap in one second
           underwater, then I would be a contender for Olympic glory, no
           less than a hero, and I would win honour for my family name.

           Anyway, I practiced over and over again, each time asking my
           grandpa, "Was I under a second that time?"  To my dismay, he
           ALWAYS said, "Not yet."  In this way, he neither encouraged me by
           letting me believe I had achieved my goal, nor comforted me by
           explaining that I could never swim an underwater lap in less than
           a second because the task was impossible for any human.
           Futhermore, when I got frustrated with his regular answer and
           asked him to elaborate - "But how close was I?" - he would
           respond, "Pretty close."  As a result, I continued practicing
           until I was blue with cold and I came back day after day to the
           same routine.  Because I was a child who could not tell time, I
           was a victim to my grandfather's special brand of sadism.

           I would like to believe that my grandfather acted this way
           because, like me, he did not know how long a second was.  I'd
           like to believe that he did not know how to tell time.
           Unfortunately, like literacy, I know that the realities of
           temporal linearity were taught my grandfather at a young age.  I
           can only guess that my grandfather played this sick game with me
           because he is an evil bastard who manipulates people for his own
           benefit and entertainment.
 
           p.s. I just timed myself and I can hold my breath for 90 seconds.

  linear - If one wanted to, say, obtain a copy of Backyard Ashes, how would
           they go about doing so?

  Heckat - Good question!  Each zine costs $3.  We also take trades.  If
           you'd like a copy, send a trade zine or a cheque to:

           Backyard Ashes
           34 MacKenzie Crescent
           Saskatoon, Saskatchewan S7J 2R5
           Canada

           People can also get in touch with us at our e-mail address,
           backyard_ashes@hotmail.com, to chat, to discuss zine issues, and
           to proclaim their love for us.

  linear - If God is all-powerful, can he create a zine so abstract that not
           even he can "get it?"

  Heckat - First, to answer your question, I would have to concede to the
           "if" that not only is God all-powerful, but "he" is also male.  I
           don't think I can do that linear.

           OK, but seriously, to humour you, I'll concede to these points.
           IF we live in a universe where God is omnipotent, then, yes, I
           think he could make a zine so abstract that not even he could
           "get it."  The proof of this is humanity itself.  If this God you
           speak of is the one who set this world a-turnin' then I think he
           has confounded himself.  I would put forth "the bible" as the
           actual "zine" of God that God can't "get."  I would like to add
           at this point that I am referring to the Judeo-Christian God when
           I speak of "God" in this context because he is the only male,
           omnipotent God that I can think of.  Other religions don't
           conceptualize divinity in this way, and I don't conceptualize
           divinity in this way, so I must resort to previous models.

           Anyway, back to my point.  The bible is a zine that not even God
           can understand.  I am not concerned with the contradictions,
           re-tellings, and general insanity of the bible in proving this
           case.  If God is omnipotent then perhaps these things make sense
           to him in a way that they cannot to us.  However, what God failed
           to understand, and we can find this written in the bible, is how
           he could make a perfect being in his own image that was still
           able to misbehave and become alienated from paradise.  Even
           taking into account free choice, God's humans (being perfect)
           should have made the RIGHT choice (or, at least, the choice that
           God had decided would be right because he made them in his own
           image!).  This is a contradiction without solution.  Boo God.

                                                                       ,o$o

  Heckat - Why did you decide to start CLiT?  Are most of the writers
           friends of yours in "real" life or did you meet a lot of them
           over that new-fangled invention called "the internet"?

  AlterE - I started CLiT because it seemed like a good idea at the time -
           something fun to keep me occupied.  I dragged Aerialisticish into
           doing it because he was the only person I could think of crazy
           enough to also think it was a good idea.  Now, of course, CLiT
           has expanded into a global company hellbent on world domination.
           I know most of the other writers, and I also know they all love
           me.  I'm a really nice guy, ya know?

  Heckat - Hey, it's funny that you should mention that you're a really nice
           guy because I notice that a lot of e-zine editors reassure their
           readers that they love them - in accordance with your "nice
           guyness" you write "I love you" to readers on the mainpage of
           CLiT.  Do you have a theory about why e-zine editors might be
           particularly inclined to spout words of affection to their
           audience members?

  AlterE - In real life, people are forever telling me that I'm the nicest
           guy they've met.  Or maybe I'm forever telling people I'm the
           nicest guy I know.  I forget.  I think I get a kick out of being
           nice - that's my thing, because I have no personality.  Online, I
           probably picked up a thing or two from other e-zine writers, who,
           as you mention, just wanna be loved!  Maybe because it's a lot
           easier to get away with saying "I love you" on the net than in
           the Big Bad World?  Maybe we're all just lovely, happy, caring
           people?  Maybe we were all abused as children.  I refuse to
           comment on my own situation.

  Heckat - Abused children?  That would explain a lot.  The BMC always says
           "all e-zine writers are in the same boat, or should I say, the
           same BED!  hahahahahahah."  This brings me to my next question.
           In your article "Top 5 Reasons Why I Would Like to Kick the BMC's
           Arse," you promise a follow-up article to be entitled "Top 5
           Reasons Why I Would Like to Make Love to the BMC on a deserted
           Beach."  Alas, this article has never been published.
           Ironically, in the same article, you criticize BMC for not doing
           the promised Esperanto follow-up to his guide: "Everything You
           Ever Wanted to Know About Being Elite."  I think, in order to
           avoid being a hypocrite yourself, you should reveal at least one
           of your reasons for wanting to make love to the BMC.

  AlterE - Under normal circumstances, my dear Heckat, I would be most
           unwilling to provide a sneak preview of an article that is still
           under construction.  Yes, that is correct, the promised piece is
           well on its way to completion, and is expected to be released in
           the second quarter of 2010.  However, I am anxious to preserve my
           reputation for integrity, intensity and intelligence (oh, it's
           true), and I am willing to summarize reason number three for
           you.  The BMC has been like a mother and a father to me during
           various times in my troubled youth, and one reason I wished to
           make love to the BMC on a deserted beach was simply to express my
           sincere gratitude for the guidance he provided.  Apparently,
           similar feelings can be shown with a box of chocolates or even
           just a handshake (imagine that!), but hey, what would I know?
           I'm just a little kid.

  Heckat - Hmmm, the idea of your love interest in BMC has sparked another
           question in my imagination, only it's of a more serious nature.
           Ever since I read N-Com issue 194 I've been wondering how things
           turned out between you and Alyson.  Did you patch things up?

  AlterE - I had this weird dream last night.  I was in a classroom in
           Africa, and the teacher told me none of the kids could afford new
           shoes, so I gave my shoes to this kid who was wearing cool navy
           blue Pumas with green laces.  Then I was walking down the street
           and I was really hungry, and I walked past this restaurant, and
           someone called out my name.  I poked my head through the door,
           and some of my old work-mates were having dinner!  I sat down,
           and we all ate a lot of vegetables.  The girl sitting two seats
           down offered to take me to the airport, and I was grateful.

           It's weird, you know?  Six weeks and four days, more than six
           months ago, and she's still offering me a ride to the airport.
           That doesn't really answer your question, but you're the first
           person I've had the chance to tell about this dream!  We never
           patched things up, and I guess we're not even friends now, not
           _real_ friends (if that's possible), but when I see her at uni
           I'll smile and say hi, cos I'm a nice polite little boy, and I'll
           let her tell me how she got glandular fever from this guy I'm
           friends with, and it's all good.

           No, really.

  Heckat - Wow, that's really sad.  I remember hoping that you two would get
           back together after reading the love theme issue of the N-Com.
           However, I also remember thinking that maybe, if things didn't
           work themselves out, you would get together with that "red-haired
           antichrist" you had a crush on in N-Com issue 159.  So, what ever
           happened to that flame?  Are you still in love with her?

  AlterE - Unfortunately, that red-headed antichrist and Alyson are the same
           person.  So, in hindsight, I was young and stupid.  Now I'm
           still young and stupid, but on top of that, I am bitter and
           jaded, so the experience has proved to be a rewarding one.

  Heckat - AHH!  The same person!  BMC warned me that this might be the
           case, but I stubbornly proceeded to ask the question anyway.  Do
           you still work together?

  AlterE - Interestingly, the place where I used to work with the red-headed
           antichrist has closed down, despite being a large Japanese
           department store. Thus, that entire period of my life amounted to
           shit.  Can I say shit?

  Heckat - Well you can't exactly "say" shit, but you CAN type it if you
           like.  Hahahahahah.  OK, that was a lame joke to ease the
           tension.  Here's another one: What would you respond to
           Asadersialle's claim in issue 10 of CliT that you are "Perverted,
           obsessive, & ha[ve] a fascination with girls about ten years
           old"?

  AlterE - *Laugh* She can say what she likes.  I always teased her
           mercilessly in real life.  She's a good kid, is Asadersialle.  I
           don't think I'm perverted.  I'm such a nice little boy,
           remember?  I probably can't argue about obsessive, though.
           Sometimes I just get hooked on things.  At the moment, I'm into
           the Electric Soft Parade, William Gibson, and procrastination.  I
           must admit, I have in the past been known to have a fascination
           for a ten year old girl.  I was in grade 4 at the time, and wow,
           was she cute!  She never knew I existed.

  Heckat - What about now?  Are you dating anyone at the moment? 

  AlterE - Currently, I'm going out with a girl from uni.  It's fun, and I
           know that when she breaks up with me, it won't be because she's
           tired of me, but because I'm moving to Manchester to become a
           rock star.

  Heckat - A rock star?  In Manchester?  She'd be a fool to break up with
           the next huge hit out of that northern industrial town.  Hmmm, I
           just thought of something.  I noticed that you quote the theme
           from Red Dwarf on Clit's News Page: "Fun, fun fun! In the sun,
           sun sun!"  Is quoting the theme from Red Dwarf intentional, or is
           it just a coincidence?  If you are a fan, do you think that,
           after you move to the UK and become a famous rock star in
           Manchester, you will use your loads of influence to revitalize
           the show by re-recording its theme song on your 5th album?

  AlterE - I love Red Dwarf!  People think I am weird because I go to my
           friends' places and watch every Red Dwarf episode or an entire
           series of Buffy (Those people come too, but they still think I am
           weird).  I am still hanging out for the Red Dwarf movie that was
           promised to me, oh-so long ago.

           I've thought about making the theme song the ringtone for my
           phone, but I've always dreamed of doing a cover of the "Om
           Song."  Man, that was a groovy tune!

  Heckat - I love Red Dwarf too!  BMC and I just finished watching the last
           season.  I'm sad that there aren't any more episodes.  Do you
           like science fiction in general, or is that show an odd exception
           for you?

  AlterE - I like science fiction.  I'm like your run-of-the-mill geek,
           right!?  I grew up reading anything I could get my hands on, and
           a lot of that seems to end up being science fiction or fantasy.
           But a lot of it isn't.  Go figure!  As far as television goes,
           Red Dwarf is the only sci-fi show I'll go out of my way to watch,
           but I don't watch much TV.  I'm just a poor uneducated kid from
           the western suburbs, struggling to make a dime.

  Heckat - Well, the fact that you're a starving student (don't think I'm
           fooled by your claim that you are "uneducated;" I know that you
           go someplace called "uni," which I believe translates as
           "university" over on this side of the world) might explain why
           you play BBS games.  Aside from shallow pockets, do you think
           that your love of Red Dwarf influenced your love of TEOS?

  AlterE - I started playing TEOS after reading the TEOS Weekly e-zine.  BMC
           and Bu Joe made the game seem so cool!  I don't think any of the
           issues of TEOS Weekly are still around, though.  I played for
           awhile with BMC, Bu Joe, Gnarly Wayne and even Aerialisticish
           until we had taken over the galaxy, but by then we'd lost
           everyone except the BMC and I.  It was a bittersweet victory, and
           the very thought of it still brings a tear to the eye.

  Heckat - Do you still play TEOS?  If not, would you play again if you
           could beat BMC and this time be named Best Pilot in the Universe
           instead of him?

  AlterE - I started a new round but, somehow, it wasn't the same.  Ah,
           we'll never see days like again, not for many a millenia.

  Heckat - What was the name of your weapons officer?

  AlterE - Weapons officer?  Why, the one and only Buffy Anne Summers, of
           course, and my Navigations Officer was the always-sexy Willow
           Rosenburg.  Wild times indeed!

  Heckat - Now that we're on the subject of names, I'm curious about the
           history of CLiT's writers' names.  I can't pronounce them!

  AlterE - What's wrong with AlterEcho?  Aren't you studying for a PhD?!

  Heckat - Ouch!  OK, that was supposed to be a joke.  I wasn't expecting
           you to insult my intelligence.  Anyway, I wasn't talking about
           your own name, only names like Aerialisticish, Asadersialle,
           etc.  Why do you make everyone choose a name starting with "A?"
           Do you think this is oppressive?

  AlterE - Initially, I told Aerialisticish that his name had to start with
           'A.'  I'd already decided that the first issue would be sponsored
           by that letter!  Asadersialle just decided she wanted that
           particular name, but PipeScream (now Anon) was the next writer.
           People just thought they'd continue the tradition and utilise the
           power and elegance involved with 'A.'  What a marvellous,
           marvellous letter.  So the only person I ever oppressed was
           Aerialisticish, but that's what I keep him around for.  Although
           at one stage, I considered asking the next posse of writers to
           start their handles with a 'B,' and the group after that with a
           'C.'  Instant hierarchy!  It could have indicated age, salary,
           company benefits and overall class.  It would have been
           beautiful, no?

  Heckat - No?  Yes!  Speaking of hierarchy, I hope you'll forgive me, but
           I'd like to get serious for a bit and ask you some questions
           about your personal beliefs.  I'll start with an issue that's
           been on my mind since reading the first few issues of CLiT.  In
           issue 4 you share the article "an open letter" and in issue 7 you
           share "Us3d And Abus3d."   I'm wondering now what your views on
           sexual equality are and if you think that sexualizing women /
           condemning women in the way you do in those article is harmless
           fun or whether it is politically charged.

           Along the same lines, in issue 7 you state that "Jonathon the
           Igloo was GAY, and I don't like him."  Do you dislike like
           Jonathon because he is not heterosexual, or do you dislike him
           for some other reason?

  AlterE - In the beginning, CLiT was just a bit of fun.  I'd just
           discovered text, and I liked the way it was often reckless and
           crude.  I don't believe that any of those examples point to me
           being sexist or homophobic.  Politically incorrect statements
           have a particular shock value, don't you think?  I believe in
           equality, hope for it, pray for it, whether it be sexual, racial,
           or economic.  On the other hand, it's easy to fall into thinking
           patterns that discriminate against certain groups of people.
           Women are bad drivers.  New Zealanders have sex with sheep.  The
           Jews killed Christ.  Americans are obese, arrogant, self-centred
           destructive bastards who will hopefully be wiped out soon.

           I'm not really answering your question, am I?  I guess I'd say
           that I believe in fairness and justice.  Men and women are
           different, right?  I mean, I know they are - we studied males and
           females in year 7.  But people are people.  I believe that the
           best person should be chosen for the job, regardless of gender.
           I don't believe that Serena Williams should get as much money for
           winning the Australian open as Pete Sampras.  I think my mum
           cooks better food than my dad.

           I don't really know much about feminist theories, or politics, or
           anything really, but I know what I believe.  I also know what I
           like.  And right now, I'm liking a Bacon & Egg McMuffin and the
           gorgeous face of Alyson Hannigan.

  Heckat - Just for the record, I have to say that I don't share your
           viewpoints on sexism and heterosexism.  But, hey, this interview
           isn't about me; it's about you.  On that note, I'd like to
           continue with the subject of gender politics for a moment, I
           wonder about your statement in issue 20 of CLiT that "Real men
           don't cry."  I know you were grieving at the time over the end of
           your relationship with Alyson, but I wonder if this is how you
           really feel about the gender-role you have to play because you
           happen to be male.

  AlterE - It's just a line, isn't it?  I like lines!  I would have much
           rather been stoic about the whole thing than as cut up as I was.
           That's all there is to it, really.  Crying is supposed to be good
           for your soul, or something, but I'll save my tears for when it's
           time to truly mourn.  Like when Radiohead start releasing country
           music.  Until then, I'll try and stay cheerful, even when the
           chips are down and the hair is messy.  Don't touch the hair!

  Heckat - OK, I understand that you want to try to stay cheerful, but I
           also know that you are often sad in your articles and that there
           are things in this world that bother you.  This dilemma - is it
           really possible to stay cheerful when you recognize so many
           problems in the world - reminds me of a question you asked the
           BMC.

           I heard through the grapevine that you asked BMC whether it is
           wise, or worth it, to fight for ideals in this world of
           apathetic, greedy, and insatiable people-bots searching for
           lasting happiness, although they pursue instantaneous
           gratification.  (Well, that's not exactly what you asked, it's my
           re-interpretation of the question).  But, ultimately, your point,
           I believe, was that it is foolish to pursue ideals that a small
           minority of people in this world hold.  Should we not, as you put
           it, "give up, get high, and sleep with the best friend's lady
           friend?"  This question gave BMC a lot of trouble because he
           hates to get down on idealism.  Of course, even in his answer, he
           remains faithful to his code.  But I wonder now what you would
           answer to your own question, especially in light of what you say
           in CLiT, issue 4: "Aerialisticish keeps telling me that we can't
           be communists. I don't care what he says - and to prove it, from
           here on in all staff members of CLiT shall be referred to as
           'Comrade.'"  Even taking into account that you were joking at
           that time and only enforced the use of the title "Comrade" for
           the one issue, I wonder: Are you ready to take off your
           revolutionary glasses, put on some with a roseish hue, and stab
           your best friend in the back in order to have a good time?

  AlterE - I think I care about things too much.  I get really, really angry
           when George Bush is making speeches on TV.  I can't stand rank
           stupidity.  I hate it when the little man gets ripped off by the
           big corporation.  Sometimes I wonder why I do care so much.  Not
           many of my friends think about these things the way I think about
           them, if at all.  I'll probably be dead before the consequences
           of this generation's actions really make themselves clear.  It'd
           be nice, I think, not to worry about any of this stuff, to just
           live week to week, pub to pub, one woman to the next.  Maybe
           ignorance truly is bliss.  I don't think it's possible for me,
           just yet.

           I have a current theory concerning the idealism of young people.
           One day I'll be old and too busy with a career to think about
           things that aren't within my personal bubble.  I told my mum that
           old people are the problem, and that if we culled everyone over
           30 (except her, of course) we wouldn't be facing the same
           problems.  Different problems, of course.  We might be more
           worried about shortages of skateboards and Playstations, and the
           dominance of MacDonalds.  We'd never be faced with war, or the
           continuing degradation of the environment, or wrinkles.  So
           there.

  Heckat - So there!  OK, I believe you've given the last word on that
           issue.  Maybe you can settle another.  This one's a mystery that
           needs solving.  Ever since N-Com issue 189 I've been wondering
           where the tomatoes are.  Any hints?

  AlterE - Sometimes I lie in bed at night and think about those tomatoes.
           I doubt I'll ever hear much about them again, but I'm still
           convinced that somewhere, somehow, Pedro will exact his revenge
           on the heartless John.

  Heckat - Pedro, heartless John, and the N-Com aside, let's get back to
           your own magazine for a minute.  How do you feel CLiT has evolved
           over the course of its 23 issues?

  AlterE - Hmm.  That's a toughie.  I'd hope the quality of writing has
           increased.  Certainly, the addition of each new writer adds
           something different.  I hope that overall we haven't changed too
           much.  A few issues ago, a reader said CLiT had lost its zing.
           That bothered me a bit.  Hopefully I'll never hear that comment
           again!  On the other hand, people still email me and ask what a
           CLiT is, and where they can find it.  Some things never change.
           I guess there's been a little bit of a difference in subject
           matter, thanks to me.  But that's cool too.  I'm happy when the
           writers are happy and when the readers are entertained.  We're
           only 23 episodes in - in terms of a Buffy, that's not even one
           season!  The plan is to stick around for some time yet, if that's
           ok with the people.  Ask me again after issue 123.

  Heckat - On behalf of the anxious audience, I'd like to ask you when the
           next issue of CLiT will be released.  And - so that you can voice
           your experiences with balancing a magazine and school and a job
           etc (fill in whatever else you are involved in) - could you
           explain how you cope with the pressures of the world while
           maintaining your own passions.

  AlterE - It's tough.  Right now, I should be doing an assignment.  It's
           due tomorrow, I've barely looked at it, I haven't started, and
           I'm not actually sure I know how to do it.  Still, that's the way
           with most of my assignments these days.  It's not much fun
           because at high school I was always a high achiever, and now I'm
           on scholarship, so I have certain academic standards that need to
           be maintained.  I've got a little bit more time than last
           semester, because the department store I worked in closed down,
           so my only source of income is tutoring.  I play bass in a band,
           and we've just finished the hockey season.  I want to do
           everything!  I just take things one day at a time, which is good
           in theory, but not pretty when assignments need three weeks worth
           of work.  There's a tonguetwister for you.

           CLiT should be out soon.  It'll be a smallish issue, methinx, and
           I just need a bit of time to pull it all together.  I don't know
           what's up with the Cr00.  They've all gone AWOL on me, and
           they're all notoriously bad emailers.  Or maybe they just don't
           like me.

           In any case, CLiT will exist in some form or other, and will
           coming soon to an http://clit.freeshell.org near YOU!

  Heckat - I'll be keeping an eye out, and I'm sure all the readers of this
           interview issue will too.  Well, I only have one question left,
           and I don't think there's any easy way to ask it, so here
           goes. . . I once heard that Australians' hair grows up instead of
           down and that their heads grow beneath their shoulders.  I also
           heard that you don't have ice cream because on the other side of
           the equator it's hot all the time (like hell) so hot that the ice
           cream melts before you can eat it.  And you don't have
           refrigerators because you're stupid.  Can you confirm or deny
           these rumours?

  AlterE - Obviously it wouldn't be in Australia's best interests for me to
           either categorically confirm or deny those particular
           allegations.  Let me see what I can do for you though. . .
           Speaking personally, I would have to agree that my hair grows
           up.  It looks like I'm wearing a big black wig, like a member of
           The Strokes or something!  Either that or Willis from Different
           Strokes.  I'm stupid too, but we have a fridge.  What's up with
           fridges?  They always make so much noise in the middle of the
           night.  Our freezer makes less noise, and freezers are better
           than fridges, right?  Because they keep things cooler.  LIKE ICE
           CREAM.  I like Cookies and Cream ice cream the most!  So you're
           wrong.  Nyah!  We have ice cream, it's just that we never get to
           eat any, because we have to feed it to our pet kangaroo that
           lives in the laundry.  That we ride to school.  Called Bruce.

           It's fun living here in the bush!  We eat damper and worms all
           the time, and convict uniforms are IN!  One day I want to catch a
           space ship to the north of the Equator, so I can see REAL
           CIVILISATION, but for now I'll stay downunder, cos I do look
           pretty silly with my head below my shoulders.

                                                                       ,o$o

  Wayne - I'm here tonight with famous N-Com writer and winner of the 18th
          Annual 16 metre skeet shooting contest, Gnarly Wayne.  So, Gnarly
          Wayne, how are you doing?

  Wayne - Aiight.

  Wayne - So, it is rumoured that you enjoy alcohol, most times to the
          farmost extreme of human endurance.

  Wayne - Beleed dat.

  Wayne - So, tell us one your experience with this "alcohol."

  Wayne - One time, I drank so much that I vomited eleventy times until I
          was down to about 40% water in my body.  Then I decided to drink
          more alcohol, which, of course, proved to be an excellent idea.

  Wayne - I don't know if that's really cool or really pathetic.

  Wayne - It's a little of both (gives the wink and the gun).

  Wayne - Any good tales to tell of when you and any others drank together?

  Wayne - Well, 98% of the time I drink by myself because everyone else are
          idiots.  But I remember this one time I passed out on BMC's
          kitchen floor while he and Komrade B went to get some pizza.  I do
          not recall if I got some of the pizza (probably not).

  Wayne - Are all your stories like this?

  Wayne - Of course not.  One time I passed out in a park.  I lost my hat in
          the same night.

  Wayne - *sigh* Do you have any interesting alcohol stories?

  Wayne - These are interesting, moron.  In a thousand years, it's stories
          like these that will make the bulk of new religious text.  The
          religion will be called Gnarlainity and followers will be called
          Waynites.  Communion will be done with one and a half ounce shots
          of Captain Morgan and the offical theme song will be "Do You Wanna
          Go To The Liquor Store" by Mixmaster Spade.

  Wayne - You seem to have put quite a bit of thought into this.

  Wayne - Actually, I just made it up now.  Doesn't mean it won't happen
          though.  In fact, odds are that it will happen.

  Wayne - How could you possibly think that?

  Wayne - Think about it.  Why is Christianity so popular?  Because it's one
          of the few religions that allow alcohol to be consumed.  They even
          worked it into their rituals.  If a religion was BASED around
          alcohol, you best believe peeps would be all over that isht like
          white on rice.

  Wayne - Your ramblings are frighteningly logical.

  Wayne - BEHOLD THE POWER OF ALCOHOL! Werd.

  Wayne - Care to add anything before I end this interview?

  Wayne - Interview? I thought you were some woman trying to pick me up.

  Wayne - Well, don't you remember last week when I set up this interview
          and then confirmed a few days later?

  Wayne -  ....

  Wayne - And I'm a guy, by the way. How could possibly think I was a woman?
          I have a brush cut, hairy legs, and a beard.  And I'm you.

  Wayne - ....

  Wayne - *sigh* Are you passed out, G-Dub?

  Wayne - I think I'm blind.
