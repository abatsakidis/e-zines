  Am I addicted to the low word count, low everything articles?  I thought
  not.  I thought the 100 word articles would be fun, then the 50 worders,
  then the 25 worders, and finally the ten worders.  Cog asked me, BEGGED
  me not to do any more theme issues like that.  And then last week I
  couldn't help but write ten 3-sentence stories.  That was it.  I had it
  out of my system, I swear.  It was all gone.  Everything was ok!

  But then, but then, but then.  After writing my feminist philosophy final
  on Monday, Jen and ada and I all got together and drank beers to
  celebrate (even though Jen and I were the only ones writing the test, I
  think ada was just looking for an excuse).  Anyway, we all ended up pretty
  much passing out at Jen's, and when we woke up, still intoxicated, ada
  sprung THE QUESTION.

  "So, why don't we write a bunch of 1-word articles?"

  So we did.  As soon as I get this issue online, I'm seeking rehab.
