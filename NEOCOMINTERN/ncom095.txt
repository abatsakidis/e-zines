        Well, it has recently come to my attention that today is the
Neo-Comintern's second anniversary.  I think that is pretty neat, don't you?
But really, if I could do anything in the world, I would go two years into
the past and chenge the date of the first release to Valentines day!  Then I
would also change the title from The Comintern to The Love, and Cog never
ever would have been able to talk me out of it.  Dammit!  I can't believe
that ever I let that fellow talk me out of doing that!  Cause you know what?
You can't tell me what to do!  You can't tell me anymore!  You're not the
boss of me!  I can do whatever I want and I will!  So all I have to say
is LA LA LA February 14th haHAhHAAH THE LOVE THE LOVE, motherfucker!
                        THE LOVE!  LOVE IT!  in joy.

 `q                                by BMC                                  p'

        I'd like to take a few minutes of your time to tell you what I think
of numbers.  Most people hold a neutral view on them, but I am strongly
opposed to numbers because of the problems they cause in our society.  You
may think me naive for discussing it, but I am very serious about this and I
believe that my hatred is well justified.

        I remember the days before they created numbers.  Children were
safe on the streets at night and if you needed shelter there was always an
open door.  Life was good.  One day someone came into town and started
singing the praises of some new thing called "numbers," and we were all
doomed.

        He taught the children about numbers first, because the older folk
were set in their ways.  As the word spread, though, everybody got in on the
action.  Unfortunately, by the time the people found out what they had given
into society had already crumbled.  Most realized the problems that had been
caused, but a certain mob-mentality existed that made the masses smite any
who opposed the system.

        Well, society, the time is now, so revolt and we will see a drastic
change in our surroundings!

        The first thing we would lose would be the menacing creature that
we call time.  Though many consider it ridiculous to hate the concept of
time, I am completely convinced that our lives would be fuller if we lived
without it.  I have been informed by a brilliant sciencetist that human
beings are on a 25 hour cycle and that our days are only 24 hours long.  A
human being is supposed to have 16 hours of consciousness followed by 9
hours of sleep.  Repetition of this pattern would have us waking up an hour
later every day.  Every twenty-four days we would be waking up at 8:00AM.
If we got rid of numbers we got rid of time we would finally be able to live
our lives in health and happiness, but apparently Mr. Number-Man wasn't
concerned with that when he made them.

        Then we'd get rid of temperatures.  This would be great, cause then
radio and tv shows would spend more time playing songs and showing movies
instead of the boring stuff.  Plus this would cut down the terrible small
talk people have in the summer.  Instead of saying, "It's supposed to go
up to 35 tomorrow but I think it will go up to 36," they will just say,
"God damn is it ever hot."  Us celcius folk don't really need thermometers
anyway as long as we know when water is freezing and when it is boiling.

        We'd have to get rid of waist measurements on pants, so I suppose
that we'd have to either try everything in the store on or maybe just start
wearing togas and loose robes like they did in the old days.  Either that
or we'd all be naked.  It doesn't really matter either way to me.  All I know
is that is seems to cost too much for a pair of pants, so screw it anyway.

        Screw all money.  Did the guy who created numbers know that he was
creating crapitalism?  And I think we all know what is wrong with this
economic system, so I will not dwell on it for fear of being berated for
slanging rhetoric.

        But since we are on the topic of man versus man, we can take a look
at scoring systems.  Games are a waste of time and should not be played by
any but the high ranking government officials, but for some reason they have
been legalized and made popular in our society.  Games instill a sense of
competition in players and spectators, and these tendancies carry through
into the real world.  We could do a better job of surviving as a species if
we shared with each other instead of competing to gain materials in excess
of what are actually need.  For some reason people seem to want more.  More
food rotting in the fridge, more money sitting unused in a bank account,
more cars in the driveway than there are people in the house.  Or we could
give the things we need to those who do need them.  Ahh, but why bother?

        We'd get rid of percentages on tests and I could go to school and
study hard and be rewarded with a greater understanding of the subject I
have taken and either a passing or failing mark.  My sociology professor
has informed the class that 90% of the students in our rather large class
are going to recieve marks between sixty and sixty-five percent on every
test from the beginning of the year to the end, so that basically means that
taking the class will make our overall averages drop no matter how hard we
study.

        We'd lose the concept of age, and I would welcome it very much.  No
longer would we make a judgement about someone based on the amount of
moments they have spent on the Earth in comparison to our own.  This would
be nice in a relationship, because instead of judging compatibility in terns
of age difference we could base it on things like interests, intelligence
levels, and emotional maturity.  This may seem ridiculous to some, but I
do believe that age does not make a difference when falling in love or
making a decision to pursue a relationship with someone.  Maybe I'm just
fucked in the head though.  Most people seem to think so anyway.

        After we get rid of time, temperature, heat, pants, percentages,
scores, money, and we will be in a new dark ages.  In fact, they will
be much darker than the original dark ages because we'd have to get rid of
all of our technology and head for the caves.  It would be fun though,
because there would be no concept of zero so we would have no desire for
anything that was not in our presence.  The next step would be to get rid
of language, and the final step would be to cease reproducing altogether.
Yeah, I freely admit that I am a genious, and if you want to e-mail me for
more enlitenment you know the address.
