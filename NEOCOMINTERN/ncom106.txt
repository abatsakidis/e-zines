                               EDITOR'S NOTE

        Well if there's one thing The Comintern is all about, it's the second
dimension.  The concept of dimensions is amazing and also underrated, so
without further ado, here's our tribute to them.

 ;P                               JAMES 2D                                 .b

        James 2D was totally lost in the SECOND dimenssion. All his friends
(but ciuyld they really be called friends?) would make fiznun iof him all
the rhiznyme. "Stupud 2D flat head face" theyw ouwldk called him.ha HA
I did it too. But now I know it was wrong, specially since James 2d adtook
his gat and shot su people up. Uh! But not me cause I live in a dioffferent
town. ja HA hajems 2D. You can't catc h,e. Oh wait, he catch me but ai just
said Jeah~! and joined his gang cause that was the secret password, but dont'
tell no one that the password is Jeah! So ajMea 2D and his p-osse fucking
toock aboerrver central ciry and was macking on therm hoes when Peaches ca,e
and said "James 2D! You are aab ae boy, trying to take over the \wiznorld."
He said "Shut up., beeothc!" i said "oh my god,. she's givin me action."
The action love came in and fucking scut shit u p and I was all hypa and all
dat but fucking Peaches told james 2D to vecome 3D but he was a fucking rebel
without a pause and he said "No waY! mang, I'm going 1D caUSE i ckepp it
real." So james 2d become James 1D but no one could ever see him so he was
dumb in doing that. i took over his pimpin ring even though James 1D was
screaming at me, but it was in 1 dimentions so I didn't hear him. There;s
a reawon why 1 demisnsopns doesn't exists in relity , stupud JHames 1D.
Insteadm iu become Waybne 4D abnd surpassed all logic and spritiaul thought
sas  of the present. i was so deep.... Deep? Deeper than Atlantis.
Deeper than the muthafuckas who pray to yha  masses. whivh isn't me so I was
mad, I team uped with tha BMC and gave him the exact same powers as Prince
Namor had cause I knwe he liked himm cept I put the wings that are normally
on his feet on his penis, cause that is what I saw the most of anyway. Lick!
after sucking winged cock for a coupel of minutes, James 5D (he had gained
powers while I was sucking dick), chal;lenged hme title. I satd "jeah" cause
that was the custom. BMC also asais "Jeah!" but he did it with a capital
cause he did it with autohotiyt. I swug back an 100 ounce of alcohol and
prepared to do abattle. IO had a drums tick and a large mottled bish.
BMC was armed with Imperious Rex and a paring knifge. Jeah, we werew set.
Wjhe took on a n amry of 1,0000 ,emme and came out only with a few mortal
wounds but we werre immoral so it was all cool. james 5D was defeated at last
which was good cause nop one really liked him in the first place. He had
dumb crules about shit o no one cared about and we like dto part so everypne
voted us in. We exectued James 2D on March 31, Ajkdj and everyone laughed.
So don't live in 2D or the same thing with;ll most likely happen to you.
Woerd!

 ;P                             FINGERS OF FOUR                            .b

        Forefinger.  I have always loved that word.  Forefinger,

        "Raise your forefinger, Spock."

        Sometimes I wish I had four fingers because then I would have four
forefingers, but I guess somebody never had the forethought to finger about
that.  Four.  It was four o'clock, and my forefinger was getting itchy.
"Four," I said, "I shall go forth into the fourth dimension of my
forefinger."  Then I fingered myself.  "For shame, for shame," I said to
myself, "for I have five forefingers and four on my other hand and there is
also another one.  One time, once, one time I could have forgotten about my
finger, but for now I would have to forego any further attempts to raise my
finger.  I foresaw what must be done.  I cut off my fourth finger, and my
fifth became my fourth and now I live happily among the forefingers of my
four fingers.
