                               EDITOR'S NOTE

	Oh my god, I opened up the local campus newspaper, and to my surprise
they had the following to say about the Neo-Comintern:

        "hi there, i'm a reviewer for the sheaf, and this is waht i have to 
say abuot the N-Com. it's stupid, infantile, the writers obsess about 
obviously peurile issues, and their mastery of language is half-assed at 
best. love, the sheaf. (sic all)"

	In response, Margarina Cataclysma was quoted by The Neo-Comintern as 
saying, "UH, Yeah, OK.  What would YOU rather read, stupid sheaf-head? 
Boring shit about school or other -actually INTERESTING FUNNY- stuff?  You 
fucking nazi whore.  I hate the sheaf.  It reports stuff two weeks late. 
GAH!  I don't even want to think about this.  Piss off." 

	Margarina was also quick to add, "Once a clot is formed, contraction 
of the platelets trapped within the clot shrinks the fibrin meshwork, 
pulling the edges of the damaged vessel closer together.  During clot 
retraction, fluid is squeezed from the clot...."

	There you have it - the critics have spoken.

Front Door of the N-Com Hedquarters
   You arrive at a run down shack. You can hear Sons of Prozac playing from
within. It's sounds as if it is playing live.

- enter door

Foyer of the N-Com Headquarters
   A gold chandelier hangs from the impressive 60-foot high ceiling.
Priceless paintings hang from every wall, and in every corner of this four-
cornered room, a large pile of gems lies. A large staircase heads up to
the second level.

A figure starts to walk down the staircase to you. It is one of the highly
respected writers of the N-Com, the High Cog!  He greets you with open arms.

Anyway, you go up the stairs and find a long hallway with two doors in it.
One is labelled "Lair of the BMC" and the other is labelled "Wayne's Drinking
Emporium".

- enter Drinking Emporium

Wayne's Drunk Emporium
   As you enter this diamond-filled room, you see a Wayne sitting in a
lawn chair, drinking Gin and Socko.  He is reading the holy Quran.  He offers
you a drink.

- accept drink

After several hours of drinking, you are very drunk with Wayne.
You have won the game!

- Cool

Just kidding, there is more.

- More drinking?

No.  Wayne kicks you out cause he wants to drink by himself.

- OK, go to the BMC thingie instead

The dangerous "Lair of the BMC"? oooooh!

- Yeah, whatever.

Lair of da BMC
   BMC is busy penning another pro-capitalism masterpiece when you stumble
in upon him. "What is this?", the BMC screams. "An intruder!"
Suddenly, you are surrounded by 17 gold men!

oh..... whoops.
A BMC whips out his penis cage and dons it.
A BMC is glowing brightly!
A BMC has grown!
A BMC is enchanting!

- hide from BMC

A BMC is easily fooled!
You are now hiding from a BMC.

- hide until BMC dies

But a BMC is immortal! Why don't you pick a more plausible course of action?

- like what?

Like destroying all the print copies of the Neo-Comintern, including ones
already sold, then formating his hard drive, effectively destroying the
Neo-Comintern.

- OK.

A BMC stops you!
A BMC is glaring at you!
A BMC raises his fist!
A BMC sells you some lemonade in a crystal glass!
You lose 20 golds.
A BMC kills you!
Game is over.

Naw, I'm sick of it.

 ;P                                WICCAPORN                               .b
 `q                                 by BMC                                 p'

        Cog wrote a timeless classic back in good ol' issue 58, and it went
by the name of "Art Review".  This article changed the Comintern forever, and
the two remaining fans referred to the article simply as "Wiccaporn".  Ever
since the issue was put up on the site, we have recieved tons of mail asking
exactly what wiccaporn is, how to find it, and if we will please remove the 
article from our site.  Surprisingly, it seems that about 50% of people have 
wiccaporn on their hard drive without even knowing it.  So in the interests 
of the pornography connoisseur, here is our guide to determining whether a 
picture is regular pornography or wiccaporn.


1) Is it attractive at all?

   If so, it is probably not wiccaporn. 

2)i) Is there a body piercing?

     If so, it could possibly be wiccaporn.

  ii) Is it an action piercing shot?

      If so, it is likely wiccaporn.

  iii) Is the flesh being pierced by human teeth?

       If so, it is probably wiccaporn.

3) Is there an animal in the picture? (Chris Otsig does count as a non-human
   animal)

   If so, it could be be wiccaporn.

4)i) Is there blood in the picture?

     If so, it could be wiccaporn.

  ii) Is it human blood?
      
      If so, it is likely wiccaporn.
      If not, it is probably wiccaporn.

5) Does Cog get aroused by and masturbate while looking at it?

   If so, it is definitely wiccaporn.
