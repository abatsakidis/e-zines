                      THE LOST PAGES OF THE COMINTERN

        This was originally written by yours truly in the cold winter of
'95.  If anyone remembers BBS's and online door games, this is for you.
Here's a trip down memory lane.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                  BLORD

        I like to play BLORD.  I play it on The Gateway Through Time BBS.
I like to be a magician, and I killed the Red Dragon twice already.  My
favorite part is when you type JENNIE in the forest and it asks you to
describe her.  I have a girlfriend, also named Jenny, and she plays BLORD
too.  We can have sex in the game, and some day we might get married in
the game.  Jenny likes BLORD too, but she sometimes dies.  I sometimes die
too.  Seth Able must be smart, cause he sure made a good game.  You can kill
monsters and people in that game, and you can steal weapons from people.
If I keep killing the Red Dragon, though, why does he keep coming back?
That Really makes me mad.  And that's why I hate to play BLORD.



                             BLORD Part II

        Lots of people play BLORD.  I don't know why.  They must be real
bored.  I used to play BLORD on Club Paradise, but that was a couple of days
ago.  I mean, a couple of years ago.  But now I play it on Gateway.  BLORD
is a lot better now than it used to be.  But it was still OK back then, but
I don't think it was registered.  I play BLORD because it takes me back to
another time and place where people were magicians and barbarians, and you
could still go out and kill a dragon, then you could go home and turn some
lead into gold.  But I still don't know why other people play BLORD.



                            BLORD Part III

        I'm not sure, but I think my girlfriend's brother, Kevin, plays
BLORD.  I know that he used to like Usurper.  I used to like Usurper too,
and so did my girlfriend.  We were pretty good at that game.  We played it
on Gateway Through Time, but one day it got reset so we played BLORD instead,
and we never turned back.  I used to play The Pit on International, but I
still like BLORD better than that.  There is an EGA program for The Pit.
BLORD has a RIP program, but it dosen't work for me.  One time I read a FAQ
on BLORD, and it was pretty good.  The End



                           BLORD Part IIII

        A Poem To BLORD By Boss MC The Bard

        "...Blord makes me happy, and sometimes sad..."
        "...Sometimes I get sad when I am killed bad..."
        "...I lose a game and my blood runs cold..."
        "...I look around for a sack of gold..."

        "...I bought a new weapon and someone thieved it.."
        "...I cried for many hours and grieved it..."
        "...I got my ass killed by the Red Dragon with speed..."
        "...then got pissed on a quart of mead..."
        The song makes you happy, yet sad.
        YOU GO AND PLAY BLORD!


                               BLORD Part V

        Why do they call it BLORD?  Once upon a time, on Club Paradise,
there was a menu with about 50 games.  Each game had a letter or number
beside it.  Lord had a B beside it and it looked like BLORD.  So I've
called it BLORD ever since then for the rest of my life.  Now I'd like to
take the time to thank The California Kid for once having BLORD on his menu.
P.S.  He says he has the most recent version of BLORD, but I'll keep playing
on Gateway Through Time, cause I already killed the Red Dragon twice.


                              BLORD Part VI

        I have to thank Seth Able for creating BLORD, a positive game that
promotes world peace and protection of the environment, but I have one
question.  Why should Seth have 20 billion dollars to go out and do whatever
he wants to do while the only entertainment I can afford is to sit in my
basemant and play his bloody game?  It dosen't cost him anything to reproduce
the game, but he still expects me to pay his registration fee.  Why should
this zillionaire expect a poor chap like me to provide him with his cash?
I think that sucks.  But what really sucks is the parasites that make BLORD
add-ons and still expect to get 5 dollars for their shitty 12 byte program.
Maybe I should expect people to register The Comintern, but I guess that
would be really fucking disgusting.  I hate you, Seth Able Robinson, for
all of the trouble you cause.
