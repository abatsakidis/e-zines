                 *:>            ODE TO BEN          <:*
           A Love Poem To Our VERY Special Friend and Mentor

Ben makes the sky light up pink when it's not pink
Ben lights our smoke and pours us a drink

Ben can change our outlook on life with a smile
He can warm up a room, make it cozy all the while

He works well with others, and likes to make friends
He lights upp a screen with every sentence he ends.  *:>

NO other three characters generate the love he does
He's our HOMBRE, our PAL, best light image there ever was

When he feels you are lonely, he kisses your mind
no better asterisk, colon and triangular bracket will you ever find

When Ben is sad it brings a tear to your eye   *:<
It saddens and hurts me to see poor Ben cry    >;*

He cures us of suffering, hunger and pain
He is our beacon that shines through the rain

Ben is our savior, whose salvation gives us indomitable spirit
WHen faced with adversity, we no longer fear it

We've all loved him since Ben knows when,
I LOVE BEN! WE ALL LOVE BEN!

                                 I Need You
                               By Gnarly Wayne

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               

After the first day we met, you've been on my mind
Now I've finally found the love I've been trying to find.
Everytime I see you, I get such a thrill
I just have to have you, even if it's against my will.
Come to me now, I don't how much more I can stand
I'm trying real hard, to be a real man.
We don't need anyone else, just you and me
When we're together in harmony, it's like ecstasy.
Ooo, baby, you know you make me feel warm inside
I've got a love for you I just can't hide.

I need you ...
I need you ...

You come in so much variety, I just can't choose
And I think of you much more than just plain booze.
I love how you smell when I open you up
A tear comes to my eye as I fill up my cup.
I give you a kiss as I swallow you down
Knowing in a few minutes, I'll be acting like a clown.
It's just what you do to me, I love it so
I'll be acting all foolish, wherever we go.
Give me a taste, you're so harsh, bitter-sweet
And after a few more, I'll be face down on concrete.
As soon as you're in me, I'm having a ball
I love you more than a man who is 2 feet tall.
