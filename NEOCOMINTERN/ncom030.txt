        "Who is it that black nigga dat they call Ren Ya fuck wid me
ya gotta fuck wid a mack ten."

        That line says it all for Ren's music.  If you heard that line on the
street it meant your ass.  Now he is the bitch made nigga killer.  To me that
isn't as scary, but let's take it back to the beginning.  Let's take it back
to 79.

        Ren was a young pup fresh outta high school when superstar recruiter
Eazy-E was putting togetha a group called The Rainbow All-Stars.  Ren never
looked back from there on in.

        Although Eazy-E was the heart of the group, it was Ren's rap that
I remember best.  His lines and verses were the catchiest, and by far the
most beloved by people world-wide.   I remember when he bellowed these lines:

        "Lights start flashin behind me, BUT they're scared of a nigga so
they mace me to blind me, BUT that shit don't work I just laugh cuz it gives
them a hint not to step in my path."

        I mean, you can't listen to that and not find a tear at your eye.
When Ren is laughing at the police I find myself laughing too, because it's a
big joke to me.

        I don't need to talk about this though.  You all know what Ren has
done in Compton on the Ruthless label, but I encourage you right now to go
buy all four of his CD's, and the NWA's as well, so you can see how he has
progressed from what he was.  Fresh out of High School and in NWA to a solo
artist inspired by his trip to mystic Atlantis.

       It all started back in 93. I was riding a giant squid and came by the
L.A. Harbor and Ren was chillin down at the LBC.  I abducted him and he was
terrified.  I threatened to kill him if he was not silent.

        Since my prehistoric squid monster was hungry and wanted food I was
contemplating feeding him, but I had come for a reason.  King Namor had
wanted more Atlantean influence in West Coast rap and our previous endeavor
with Drizzay and Snoop had met with terrible failure.

       I took Ren to Cavercus, knowing he was not ready for the beauty that
is Atlantis.  The Sea Elves were very hospitable with him, offering him many
of their daughters and allowing him to hunt Sea Weegy with the Males in which
he killed many.

       As Ren adjusted to life in the sea I made him more comfortable to the
idea of being our rap agent in L.A.  We wrote a couple of songs on the way to
Atlantis and when we arrived he was truly inspired.  He met Atlantis'
greatest musical hero, Chistopher Cross, and gained much knowledge in the
taste of Atlantis.  We assured him that although his style would have to
change a bit, we would make sure that our secret agent goons would make sure
his music would succeed.

      Alas, I made two terrible mistakes.  First I attempted to make him the
bitch made nigga killa, and then I got him to do a song with Snoop which was
really bad.  I tried to change things for the better by giving Snoop to
Master P and by doing so dooming his musical empire, but I think the damage
is done to Ren.  He is barely coherent, and what he does say I can't
understand.  Ah well, there is always Drizzay to fall back on.

"We gonna cut yo head off and fuck you wit' a broom stick."
 
Ahhh, the wit that is M.C. Ren (aka the Villian in Black, aka the Ruthless
Villian, aka Lorenzo Patterson). This article will only focus on the release
of his album "Kizz my Black Azz" and not on the other shame-filled albums he
has done.
 
Kizz my Black Azz
-----------------
 
First off, on the inside leaflet of the album, M.C. Ren is shown kissing
his middle fingers as if to say "Fuck you". I think he is, in fact, licking
his fingers to get some Bar-B-Q sauce off of them. Anywayne, black to da 
musick. 
 
In "Intro: Check it out y'all", Ren introduces himself as the black
nigga that they call Ren. He also informs us that niggaz from Kompton
murder muthafuckas. He also enjoys grabbing the nine and the clip, and go 
bucking up shit. Another piece of information that Ren shares with us is that
the definition of a ruthless gangsta is, in actuality, villian. So, as you 
can tell strictly from the instrumental first song, Ren is a kind, friendly
scholar who enjoys physical activity and playing with his toys.
 
The next selection, "Behind the Scenes", gives us a peek into Ren's psyche.
Ren likes to pretend he is in high school and chase around the most
"innocent"-looking girls who are not so innocent. He dishes forth a tale
of such a girl. He follows her around in school, drooling. He then follows
her home to watch her masterbate, have sex with the neighbor, then the dad,
then the mom. I don't know if Ren knows this or not, but incest is not cool
or the "in" thing to do. And it's illegal. But Ren is such a nasty Compton
gangsta, he doesn't care. But Ren's not satisfied with vouyering, oh no.
As Ren and his ten crew members watch through the window, Ren can't just
sit there because,
 
"I was too much of a man,
so I jumped in through the window with my dick in my hand."
 
You would think the shards of broken glass entering M.C. Ren's unprotected
dick would affect M.C. Ren's love-making ability. But you'd be wrong.
 
The third track, "Final Frontier", is just a basic bragfest with Ren telling
everyone "Fuck you", "Get da bozack", "Gimme da nut", ect. Peeping the video
would show you that M.C. Ren handles very well a Mac 10.
 
On da flipside, "In the Alley", Ren talks about the alley behind his house
that he plays in. Even though it is fraught with danger and evils, Ren is
a knight of Compton and slays these evils eazily with his Mac 10. A lot of
other crap happens in the alley, but it's too confusing to make out. Ren
should stay home, drink tea, and download 0-day porn from the "Net".
 
The next killer song, "Hound Dogz", is about Ren's childhood dog, Woof.
He would go to high school dances with Woof and the good looking girls
would look down upon Ren and Woof cause all Ren drove was his two feet, or,
in Woof's case, his three feet. But the tables turned around and Ren is
making all the hoes jump onto his wayyaooo. Anywayne, as the song progresses,
you find out that Woof is, indeed, Yella. Ren also talks about the homiez
that dissed him, but now he's making records, the tables turned once again.
Now these foos' talk to him like an hour every day. Hmmm.. unless there is
only a few people calling Ren each day, this would seem to take up a lot of
his spare time, possibly even cutting into sleeping time, record cuttin'
time, ho slappi' time, and nigga killin' time. I mean, even if only 23
people called him for an hour every day, that would one hour for everything
else in Ron's life. A more likely story is that NO ONE calls Ren, except
for Yella, who Ren doesn't want to hang out with anywayne. In fact, no
one from N.W.A. want to hang with Yella. The real reason Eazy-E died is
that he commited suicide just to get rid of Yella. Damn you, Yella.
 
The last song, "Kizz my Black Azz", is just another rant song but it still
kicks azz. One line in particular needs to be pondered. For instance, Ren 
must have incredibly strong pubic hairs.
 
Quote "Quit swinging on my dick hairs" Unquote
 
Now, considering that average person that Ren hates is 160 pounds, that
is much weight. I tested this on myself and found my dick hairs could only
withstand about 58 pounds before breaking off.
 
 
I would elaborate a lot more, but deadlines are deadlines and I must submit
to the vicious tyrant that is mein editor.

                                                                           :
          .      .     .    .   .  . .. ...................................;

 
        In 1988 when MC Ren was cutting a multi-platinum album with NWA he
was laying ground for some of the most mysognystic and violent music ever
recorded.  Yes, Lorenzo Patterson took hatred of women to a much more
involved level, and he has the millions of dollars to prove it.

        Back in the 80's, the black nigga that they call Ren made his mark in
Calm-ton as a fighter and hater.  These quotes will illustrate his opinion
of our mothers, sisters, and daughters:


        "throw your hands in the air and let me see you slap a ho"

        "her bottom lips was hangin as she started fingerbangin"

        "ya little ho hurry up and suck my DICK!"

        "walkin home from school I saw her suckin a nigga's dick under the
bleachers"

        "put ya lips on my big chocolate Twinkie(R)"

       -or Ren's new love song, "Voyage to Compton":

       "fuck yo ass in the tub, rub my dick with vasoline"


        When Ren wasn't threatening the female race, he was occasionally
exchanging insults with other rappers such as Ice Cube and Snoop Doggy Dog.
Because he is now teaming up with the rappers just mentioned, the question is
raised; "Is rap fake?"  

        MC Ren's new album, "Ruthless For Life" is a paradox.  The first
thing I have to mention is the title track which is rap's answer to American
Pie.  Ren kicks things off by explaining what has passed in the last 10 years
and how his niche in the industry has come full circle.  Full circle indeed,
but the circle in reality is a sphere where the same point will never be
touched twice.

        A very interesting track on RFL is "Who In The F***", a song where
Ren makes note several times of the fact that he is recording in Texas with
rappers from the Suave House.  The entire album, in fact, seems to be a
collection of songs with definite secondary themes.  Each track is recorded
at a different studio from the others, and each track features different
co-writers.  Ren gets an unusual amount of help on this album.  Since the
begining of his solo career, he hadn't ever relied on cameos until now.  Is
Ren running out of steam, or simply trying something new?

        The solution to the ruthless enigma which is MC Ren is that he was
simply not as marketable in the gangsta rap genre as Ice Cube, Drizzay, Snop,
or Poof Dady have been.  The reason for this is that Ren is still the same
person as he was 10 years ago.

        As you've noticed, his rap style has changed slightly, but his
attitude remains the same.  Ren has proven over the years to have been
willing, even eager to offend.  This in itself is not something which begs
for popularity.

        On his new album, Ren raps with Cube and Snop in a confident display
of willingness to offend fans with tactics; not merely critics through
offensive lyrics.

        Ren's attitude:  Instead of catering to a target audience, he will
destroy them; reshaping and reconstructing them in his own image.  Yes, Ren
is still the bitch made nigga killa.

        Though some may raise the "sellout" flag to Ren, he says it best:

        "I'm just a Compton Nigga"

        This quote is from his new smash single, Voyage To Atlantis, arrgh, I
mean Voyage To Compton.  Ren is not elusive.  Ren isn't merely rapping about
how much money he has pilfered from the fans.  Ren is rapping about his
roots, albeit with a hit and miss turnout.  Yes, though Ren has never had a
"solid" album (yet), he does amaze lyrically more often than not!


        A few more amazing quotes from Ren which did not fit into the
article; yes, Ren's TOP ELEVEN:
                                      
        "I only hang out with G's, cause they don't give a diznam: to make it
clear, they don't give a damn"

        "now this is a bitch that made STRAIGHT AAAAAAAAAAAs!"

        "I don't give a damn if niggas is fightin in the crowd"

        "yo what's up this is Lorenzo Patterson I'm callin from Compton"

        "the show ain't over till the black nigga sings"

        "ruthless gangsta, definition: villain.  You can lock up your shit;
he's still stealin!"

        "if I wanted to I could hit you with my third eye"

        "bitches wanna fuck me while I'm in the Suave House"

        "...and did the D.O.C. get his voice back"

        "puttin wack records in the makes by using R&B fuckin' singers in the
god damned breaks"

        "I'm a threat so get a cold rag and wipe ya neck!"

        The End

Oh by the way, Ren says "southwest connection" in this album, so maybe he is
a sellout.
