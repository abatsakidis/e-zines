  Here again it's the N-Com with the knowledge you can't find in college.
  Within the characters of this textfile you will find many things.  You
  will find more spirituality and mysticism than you ever thought could be
  discovered on a computer screen.  Next you will learn a valuable lesson
  about capitalism and how wonderful it is.  Finally, if you still don't
  know what time it is, you'll find out how the devices of time can rock the
  house without a doubt.  Have you heard of our sordid past?  FUCK FUCK FUCK
  fuck me, fuck me up, fuck me over, fuck me on the phone,
  fuck me two times baby, fuck me any way you like, fuck my world,
  I love fuck 'n roll.

  One day Buddha decided that he had spent too much time being an ascetic.
  He came to this conclusion when he looked at himself in a pool's
  reflection and could see his spine from the front.  What's more, he could
  see through his spine as well.

  "That's it," said Buddha.  "I'm finah get my grub on."

  Buddha put on his Halloween costume from the year before when he went as a
  spirit and sat under a tree in a woman's yard.  When the woman came out of
  the house to smoke a blunt, Buddha popped out from behind the tree and
  said, "Let's do dis."

  This woman was like, "Who dis?"

  Buddha was like, "I'm the spirit of the tree, foo-el.  Now pass the
  joint."  But the woman had already finished off the whole thing so it was
  too late.  Instead, she gave Buddha a bowl - not of weed, but of rice!

  And when he was done eating, Buddha simply said "Word."  He had attained
  enlightenment.

                                                                       ,o$o

  I planned to write an article for The Neo-Comintern about the relation of 
  humanity to a cruel, uncaring universe.  Why bother?  Advertising is
  rapidly gobbling up every inch of free space in the world, so I deleted
  the whole thing.  Articles are passe; branded "content" is IN IN IN.  Ever
  one to keep up with the times, my new, improved "article" is an
  advertisment.  Viva Coca-Cola.  Jigga what.

  |Personals|

  --Men Seeking Women--

  and water by candlelight, long walks down cell block "D," and passionately 
  dropping the soap.  I'll rock your world, girl.  I'll rock it harder than
  I rocked that fucker at the liquor store.  That is if I were guilty, which
  I'm not.  Free handsewn pot mitt with every inquiry.

  video games, fetching beer for my man, and having sex all night, every
  night.  (full disclosure: none of that was true)

  drinking overpriced margaritas and listening to shitty eurodance music?

     +McThanks!  No need to worry about taxes anymore -- I don't make enough
      to pay them!

  I've recently been approached by many a persons telling me "Yo, G. Wang, I
  know what candy to eat and what isht to use when I injure myself, but what
  I really want to know is what is the best device to tell time and to alarm
  me when I need to be awoken."  To this I replied "JEAH!" and proceeded to
  reserch the best ways to tell time.  Obviously.  Though I suppose you got
  that from the title so really this is just a waste of space, much like
  most of my articles.


  Position of Sun via Eyesight: obviously this is the worst out of all.  If
  it was any bloody good, people wouldn't have invented other time telling
  devices.  Though if you look closely enough into the sun, you can see a
  baby.  Sometimes he will giggle at you, and when he does, you become one
  with the universe, which is cool enough but doesn't tell you the correct
  time.

  Rank: C (because of Baby Sun)


  Sundial Watch: I never got how these worked.  They seemed to work grand on
  Flintstones, but when I made one it was always wrong unless I was facing
  North, which I usually am not.  And it didn't come with an alarm.  I guess
  that's why whatever race made these watches died out.  HahHAhAHAHhaha on
  that race.

  Rank: D-


  Clocks with hour and minute hands (sometimes second hand): Yeah!  These
  are cool because you can get funny things like Goofy with his crazy hands
  going all over the place.  Though the second hand is always a red stick.
  It'd be cool if they made it his leg or something.  LOOK AT THAT CRAZY
  LEG!  IT'S MAKING A FULL ROTATION EVERY MINUTE! Flavour Flav wore a plain
  one of these clocks around his neck, much like I do.  Everyone says I'm
  /<-rad with it on, but I assume they are laughing behind my back (not
  caring cause I know the correct time).

  Rank: B-


  Digital Alarm Clocks: These are so accurate (as long as you set it right)
  that its not even funny.  My alarm goes like this:

  "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"

  I hate it sooooooo much.  Even if I hear it when I am already awake, it
  sends shivers down my spine.  I hate that noise so much, but am way far
  too lazy/cheap/stupid to buy a new one.  "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
  How would you like to wake up to that every single fucking day.
  "AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH" There is no God.  I would like one that you could
  download mp3 or wav files to.  I'd pick the beginning of "Blackman in
  Effect" or possibly the old "Spiderman" theme song.  That way I could just
  get up and dance my wayne into the shower.

  Rank: C-


  Greenwich Synchronization via Internet: This is just stupid.  Everyone
  knows that the Internet is just a fad, so don't waste your 0 dollars on
  using this.  Get a good solid club instead.

  Rank: F+


  Asking Someone: this is good if you want to meet someone, which most
  people don't, or maybe they just don't want to meet me.  *giggle*  Anywho,
  people are morons that can't tell time anyway, so this is a waste of time,
  just like telling time is.  Who really cares in the long run?

  Rank: Who cares about time? Not me. I don't really do anything anywayne
  that requires me to notice time.


  Use this article in good or bad health, I don't really care.
