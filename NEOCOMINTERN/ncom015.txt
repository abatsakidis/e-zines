        So, now that Digital Underground is putting out a new album, it's
time for the N-Com's RAP SAGA to continue with a write-up in tribute to
Greg Jacobs (AKA the entire D.U. crew).  What can one say about this group?
Are they old school, new school, R&B, or hip-hop?

        Well, to be quite serious they are all, yet none of these.  Digital
Underground is a group that started out with many fresh ideas and hard raps,
but slowly shifted to expose their lack of a message.  Hear me straight, I
have always loved their songs.  I remember the summer vacation in British
Columbia when I learned every word to songs such as "Freaks of The Industry"
and "Sex Packets".  That album, "Sex Packets", was visible in every store
and gas station between Saskatoon and Kelowna.  It was that smash hit "The
Humpty Dance" which had every record store in Western Canada selling the
LP in triple digits.

        Their fat funk samples have always instantly attracted new recruits
to their modern funk mob, but I'm not sure if DU or their engineer was aware
that the heavy bass within these "fat funk samples" would not be able to be
reproduced on most sound systems, especially on factory car stereos of 1989
Hyundai Excel (the official motor vehicle of the Seoul Olympics), and
portable home stereo systems, commonly known as "walker mans".  Fortunately,
most Digital Underground fans have a minimum of 10" woofers in their sound
systems.

        Some people think that ghetto blasters have a lot of bass potential,
but according to our underground Communist lab reports, 16 D batteries in a
piece of machinery held 1 inch from the human ear orafice do not increase the
bass.  In fact, you need approximately 5 meters between the bass source and
the reciever to achieve full sound effect.

        Digital Underground warns, "Triple slippin MC's will be verbally
raped".  I would like to add that they will also be physically raped, not
only by Shock G, but also by Humpty Hump.

        Shock G and Humpty Hump are the same person.  Who told you that
back in '91?  The same guy who declared that Healie from Dragon Warrior 4
had hands under his feelers!  Ha Ha Ha that's right!  That's right!  I won't
get into DW4 right now, but maybe you'll see that in a future platinum issue.
Let's find out what my girlfriend has to say about this...

        "Yo yo yo the only thing I have to say about DU is that I think it
is really funny ha ha when my boyfriend imitates Humpty Hump.  It makes me
laugh.  I also think it's quite strange that although this band's name is
DIGITAL Underground, they recorded it least this album on an analogue 24
track." (Hear "Rhymin' On The Funk")

        I'd start to get into their other albums, but I only have "Sex
Packets" to inspire me right now.  I have all of the others, but they are in
a crate in a secret location 3,500 km from where I am currently.  One thing I
will say, however, is that "Nuttin Dis Funky" reminds me of Ernie's rubber
duckie for obvious reasons.  Also, when I was making out with my first
girlfriend, a song called "Flowin on the D-Line", or something to that
effect, was my favorite song.  Hmmm, I also remember buying a P.M. Dawn
album around that time.  One of the first times I ever went to the U.S., I
saw the video for "Do what You Like".  One of the few gifts I ever purchased
for a friend was Gnarly Wayne's Christmas present "The Body Hat Syndrome",
an album I've still never heard to this day.  All seemingly unrelated
incedences, yet the bond of DU and BMC is the relating factor between all.

        Digital Underground, to be brief, was a group that busted onto the
scene with flavour unrivled by any other hip-hop band of the time.
Eventually, though, they just ran out of things to say.  Shock G once said,
"George will be the first to tell you when the funk's gone".  George Clinton
has never spoken to me in my life, so I'm not going to wait to hear his words
before I categorize D.U. as being former greats, like Eazy-E and Randy
Carlyle of the Winnipeg Jets.

        One thing that can not be argued, though, is the power behind their
first album.  The atmosphere it set, the feelings it stirred, and the images
it created are factors that could have left no fan's life unchanged.  In an
era of heavy metal and gangsta rap music, this truly creative art was as
refreshing and inspirational as it was def.  Word.

                               BODY HAT REVIEW
                               by Gnarly Wayne

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        "You're in the danger zone.."

        Digital Underground entered a different type of danger zone when they
released The Body-Hat Syndrome. The zone of slipping off. With the release of
this album, D.U. seems to be going the way of most rappers did in the year
1993 ... away from the real and going to the green.  I haven't listened to
anything more recent than Body Hat, so I can't be sure.

This album isn't bad, in fact, if it was released by a new rap name, I might
even say it was quite good by 1993 standards.  Since it is the Undergound,
though, I must say it is disappointing.  It simply cannot compare with Sex
Packets, This is an Erect P_nis Release, or Sons of the P.

        The beats and rhymes are alright, but it didn't take me to a
different dimension or I didn't feel the tension like with the other albums.
I will give a review on a few selections than I will get bored and write
something ... or get drunk, I haven't decided yet.


Intermission: I feel I must include this song because it is really good.
Course, the only reason it is good is because it is just a little 
weenie mix of cuts taken from previous albums. But nice nonetheless.

Shake & Bake: This songs makes me want to eat chicken, then throw it up
again.

Jerkit Circus: This is a made up thing, like Sex Packets (yes, Sex Packets
are fake). Still, it makes me want to set up a similiar circus in my 
bedroom, so I usually do.

Wassup Wit the Luv: The "hit" song off the album which just is really bad.
It's a typical ghetto awareness song which makes me want to listen to
something else. The only good thing about this song is that they say
"Boo-Yakka!"

I'm sorry, I can't review anymore songs as I have just put in Sex Packets.
I lasted as long as I could.
