                      (please do not read the following)

  The Neo-Comintern offers a friendly kick in the central nervous system.
  One glance of the articles herein and your will shall be sweetly sapped,
  your mind blissfully shattered, and your heart lovingly torn from your
  baw-dy.  There are some negative effects as well, but these are mostly
  minor and barely life threatening.  Together, in combination, they result
  in one great N-Com issue.  Believe it - or don't!

 `q                                by BMC                                  p'

  Eat, flower, eat!  I command you to eat, absorb, sprout teeth.  EVOLVE
  damn you and eat or you will surely go hungry and I will die.  You look
  at me, or do you look?  I can only see one eye and perhaps you can see
  all or none, but you root firmly in your dirt as I root loosely on my
  clothes and shoes and am held to the Earth by nothing but gravity.  I can
  levitate if I wish to - you cannot.  You can do nothing, it seems, but be
  held, and be beheld by me.  And though I choose not to float I assure you
  that if I did there would be no tightly-wrapped soil to stop me.

  I am free, you are bound, helpless, and this makes me your master.  I
  could kill you now but then, Machiavellianly, I realize that to kill you
  would allow me to be master no more.

  And I look at you with contempt and spite.  I can crush you, but I cannot
  force you to obey.  You look at me, I imagine, stemmed cyclope, with
  resistance and passivity.  I can do everything but command you and

  now

  I wonder which of us is superior.  Is it me, with mobile body, or you - 
  -with no conscious being
  -no hopes
  -no desires
  -but no longing
  -no lack of contentment, for it is contentment that we humans truly
   struggle for.  Or is it simply
  -a lack of lack of contentment

  I don't know, I am incapable of understanding.  And I'm beginning to
  think that you might be capable of understanding, but don't care either
  way.  Is this enlightenment?  If so, you may be succeeding at changing my
  mind on the issue.

 ;P                        THE FRUIT SALAD ANALOGY                         .b
 `q                               by Heckat                                p'

  the fruit salad gathered on my tongue like an assembly of villagers from 
  medieval times rioting on their landlord's front step.  the custard was a 
  flatterer, trying to sweeten me up, trying to convince me to be fair to
  the fruit as i ate it.  the strawberries and blueberries were like
  colourful, beautiful entertainers - trying to cheer me up, and out of my
  harsh behaviour.  the bananas were the filler.  they stood around for the
  moral support of the other villagers, but basically they were just
  bodies.  the melons, now they were the violent ones - threatening me with
  their sharp taste - burning crosses on my front lawn.
