        Not really.  Let's just say that Doctor Bombay is something else.
Ever since he got his PHD in moving the crowd, he has been climbing the
charts in Sweden and some other nordic countries.  Download his MP3's and
make fun of them!  After you have done that, devote a moment of thought to
the very real possibility of a MoOn bridge as described by Komrade B.  Paix!

        I vividly remember the fall of 1998 when the world seemed fresh for
the taking.  My mind was open and would soon be changed for ever as I heard
the crystal clear voice of Doctor Bombay ringing out through the land of
Canada.  In a sense, that was my last year as a child and my first as a man.

        "Calla-calla-cutta-cutta-cutta-ehhhhh-ohhhhh-ehhh-ohhhh"

        I never knew where Doctor Bombay's voice ended and my mind began,
but I knew that it was time for me to begin committing a series of murders
in his name.  But don't blame me for that, because I was young and
vulnerable, and Doctor Bombay was the voice of all of us; the voice of
Generation X.

        Doctor Bombay spoke to the heavy-hearted teenaged dissidents who were
now all twentysomething.  What was amazing was not that he carried the world
with his hard-hitting anthem, "Calcutta", but that he spoke with an authority
that had never been met by greats such as Lincoln, King, Kennedy (from MTV),
or Hitler.

        When Doctor Bombay started out in the ghettos of Watts, California,
critics such as Leonard Maltin and The High Cog feared the influence he might
have on the nations' youngsters.  Bombay, however, persevered with time, and
eventually infected 74% of the world with his lessons of hard-earned peace
and love.  With The Doctor as a figurehead in the political system, goths
were given a reason to smile, and punks' hearts melted.

        But what about the personal side of Doctor Bombay?  Well, he had
started out in 1987 with hopes of gaining money through record sales, which
he would in turn donate to charities such as "Tabs For Tots" and the
"Communist Global Empire".  He was married at the age of 14 to his younger
sister, Bezsheena.  At the tender age of 25 he came out with his smash hit,
"Calcutta", a song which sold exactly 10 million copies.  With that money,
Doctor Bombay built Saskatoon's first hospital so people wouldn't have to fly
to iNDONESIA in case of a medical emergency.

        Doctor Bombay found himself at the top of the world in late 1999, but
then something happened which was as mysterious as Doctor Bombay was popular.
For some reason, success had destroyed Doctor Bombay, and as he found himself
alone at the top, there was nothing left for him to do but begin abusing
solvents and womanizing.  Nobody knows what was the cause of this sudden
shift in interests, but we can be quite certain about its effect on the fans.

        While record sales nearly came to a halt, Doctor Bombay began to
have after-concert parties, which were actually drunken orgies where his
remaining "fans" were encouraged to heavily indulge in some of the most
potent drugs known to pharmacists.

        After a period of time, some concerned friends of Doctor Bombay sent
him for drug rehabilitation, where he killed himself.

        When Doctor Bombay committed suicide, the entire world was shaken.
Three-thousand of his fans/cult followers comitted mass suicide in
Tiennamon Square.  What, if anything, have we learned from the saga of Doctor
Bombay?  Nothing.

          .      .     .    .   .  . .. ...................................;

        The moon it is a mistress to us all as it has been for all men
through out the ages.  I Love the moon, but she is to me a pristine virgin
and she is sullied by a foul species that treats her like a dirty whore.  The
MOoN MONSTARS have ruled her white valleys and grey seas for as long as life
has clung to this rock we live on.  They are evil!  I know it to be true even
though I have seen no acts of evil.

        I know in my heart that they must be contained, or they shall destroy
us.  Oh I have seen no plans of destruction, but I have tasted their flesh
and understand their ways better then any other mortal.

        How do we destroy them you ask?  I do not know, but I'll deal with
that problem when I get to it.  The main problem is getting there.   The only
solution is to build a bridge.  I'll get Wozniak and Sons to clear the land
and bitter city workers to build it.  Then in 4 - 6 weeks the bridge will be
complete and I will send hordes across to deal with "THE MOoN MONSTAR
SOLUTION".

        The bridge will be made of wooden planks bonded together by bamboo
and mud.   No steel shall be implemented, because all of it will be used to
make two sub-water boats.

        Once the bridge breaks the atmosphere the bridge will float because
there will be no gravity and the bridge will consist of solely bamboo and
water.  Then in four weeks the bridge will reach the moon's orbit, (Hey you
said 4 - 6 weeks what happened to the other two weeks?)  The extra two weeks
are in case the moon is not where it is suppose to be and we have to wait
for it to come.  See, I thought of everything!

        SO when it is built and everything is in place, if my physic
calculations are correct once you clear the earth's atmosphere you merely
have to jump to the moon.  (Yes it is that simple)  And if what astro-nauts
and MOoN MONSTARS have told me is true, we can breathe the air on the moon,
and swim in its grey, choppy waters.

        Thank you.
