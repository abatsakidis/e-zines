                                EDITOR'S NOTE
                      (PLEASE DO NOT EAT THE FOLLOWING!) 

  I was hauling a claw-footed bathtub across the Painted Desert when BMC
  came riding up to me on a grey pony.  "What up?" said he.  "I've been
  thoroughly swamped with my various BMC activities, for example, learning
  how to surf.  Can you help me out, old chap, and write up a guest editor's
  note for this week's Comintern?"

  "I don't know, BMC," I said.  "I'm kind of busy myself, what with me 
  hauling this bathtub across the desert for no reason whatsoever." 

  BMC stared at me, unimpressed.  He plucked his monocle from his eye and
  began to polish it with the sleeve of his coat.

  "Surfing, Melatonin, surfing," he whispered, then gave the pony a kick in
  the ribs and went riding off into the sunset.

  "Oh dear," I thought, and climbed into the tub.  "This is awful.  Now BMC
  hates me and will never let me write for his magazine again."  I felt
  horrible.  I wanted to kill myself.  I decided to drown myself in the
  bathtub just to make BMC feel bad.  I turned on the taps but nothing came
  out -- not because I was in the middle of the desert, as you might think,
  but because the pipes were clogged.  I increased the water pressure until
  the tub gave a low groan and a clump of soggy paper came blasting from the
  tap.  I picked it up and began to read the story below, a harrowing look
  into Komrade B's love for BMC.

  After I was finished, I felt a lot better.  Thanks Komrade B!  Your pain
  and anguish really cheered me up!  Good work.

                                                                       ,o$o

  (The following correspondence was carried through last fall between myself
  and the BMC)


  Dear BMC,

  I would like to apologize for my behaviour last week.  I know I told you I
  was depressed and I saw no point in living anymore, and I think I was
  pushed over the edge when you never responded to my cry for help, which 
  in turn led me into trying to kill myself.

  Obviously by writing this letter I am informing you of my failure to end
  my life and as such I would wish to apologize for my failure and I assure
  you the next time will be a success, but for now allow me to explain.

  I figured the best way to end it would be to make it look like an accident
  so my loved ones could get insurance money, so I took an axe to the
  natural gas line in the basement and then waited patiently for the room to
  fill with the smelly gas until the point where I figured the pilot light
  in the furnace would kick in igniting the gas and blowing the house (and
  myself) to kingdom come...

  However it was unseasonably warm that week and therefore the furnace did
  not kick in.  Quickly realizing my predicament I began to frantically
  search my pockets for a lighter or perhaps even matches.  Finding none I
  resigned myself to failure and began to proceed up the stairs, when it
  dawned upon me that I could not breathe natural gas and if the room filled
  up with enough gas I would fall asleep from lack of oxygen and never wake
  up again...

  Pleased with my new ploy I proceeded to sit on the floor waiting for that
  eternal sleep.  However the gas did not make me sleepy in fact it gave me
  a splitting headache... Hating headaches even more so then I hated life I
  resigned myself to flee from the basement and to call the gas company to
  fix my gas line.

  Needless to say they made a big issue out of the whole thing, and even
  yelled at me.  To top it off they gave me a bill for 400 bucks to fix the
  gas line.  Boy now I wish I really was dead...

  Sincerely,
  K-B


  Dear BMC,

  Well another week has passed and unfortunately for the both of us I am
  still alive and somewhat well... This weekend I attempted suicide yet
  again, and yet again it was a horrible failure.  I was watching that movie
  called "One Crazy Summer" or whatever on TBS.  You know that guy that
  calls into the radio show and then the radio falls into the tub and he
  dies?  Well I was thinking to myself that was the way to go, not only did
  it look painless but it was funny too.  I mean I figure if I am going to
  take my life I should at least try to make it funny for those who survive
  me, right?

  So anyway I ran a hot bath, with a bunch of bubbles (because I like
  bubbles) and some of those bath beads (because I like soft supple skin).
  I hopped in the tub and proceeded to play around.  You know those things
  everybody does in the tub. Like take all the bubbles and put them on your
  face and pretend you have a big white beard?  I was pretending I was Santa
  Claus and making children smile by giving them gifts.  After the moment
  was over I realized I was not in fact Santa and that I would never make
  children smile.  Properly depressed I proceed to lift the toaster and
  dropped it in the tub....

  I thought I felt something and then I opened my eyes.  I was still in the
  tub, and my first thoughts were that I was dead and if I got out of the
  tub I would turn and see my dead body.  However that was not the case and
  I quickly realized that the breaker must have tripped downstairs.  Annoyed
  by my failure I resolved that I would flip the breaker and insure my death
  however in a state of dismay I forgot to dry myself and my wet feet
  slipped out from under me in the hallway causing me to fall hard on my
  back, thus throwing it out of whack.  Unable to move for nearly three
  hours I finally managed to get the paramedics over to my place and they
  took me to the hospital.

  So anyway I'm now stuck here for like two months or something.  Not only
  do I have a bad back but apparently the toaster electrocuted me enough to
  render me sterile.  Now considering the situation I am in perhaps that is
  of no consequence; however, it bothers me that I cannot have children
  should I decide in the future that I wish to procreate.

  I can't get out of this bed and there is absolutely nothing around me that
  I can use to kill myself.  I tried to strangle myself with that buzzer you
  call the nurses with.  I wrapped the cord around my neck and tightened it
  however when I passed out my hands loosened and I kept waking up.  The
  doctors told me the only thing I succeeded in doing was giving myself a
  bit of brain damage from depriving my brain from oxygen.

  From there on in my attempts have become more pathetic and futile.  I
  tried stabbing myself with the plastic fork from my lunch.  I tried
  throwing hot soup in my face (thinking back, I'm not sure what I had hoped
  to accomplish with that one).  I tried bribing the janitor to give me some
  Draino so I could whip up one of my famous suicide cocktails.  Of course
  lacking money at the moment he declined to oblige me.

  So needless to say this letter is a cry for help.  Not the sort of help
  where you convince me its better to live, but the kind of help where you
  help me to die.  I need some things.  Like maybe some rope, some poison,
  maybe some knives, or some of those mosquitoes with West Nile virus.  I
  don't know... whatever kills fairly quickly.  I mean, I don't want you to
  bring any cancer.  That looks long and painful.  Well, I won't tell you
  what to do - you're fairly smart, I'm sure you'll figure something out.

  With Love,
  L'Homme B

  Warning: A capitalist plot to threaten your health.

  If you are part of the impoverished masses, I assume that you eat fast
  food from time to time if not exclusively.  It is a travesty in itself
  that most of us are forced to buy this cheap and greasy food whenever we
  lack the time or money to go to the grocery store and cook our own meals,
  but it's not just the greasy food that destroys my heart.

  If you look at a food chart, you'll notice that there are four or five
  food groups.  Strangely, meat and dairy are two of these food groups even
  though neither of them are any good for you and would be better replaced
  by other protein and calcium containing foods that are not so high in
  fat.  Just ignore this section if you're skinny.  In fact, stop reading
  this whole thing if you're skinny, or at least if you're healthy, because
  you probably don't eat enough fast food for it to matter anyway.

  Now when you go into the fast food outlet you will find that there are
  three fast food groups:  meat, fries, and pop.  Alternatively, some fast
  fooders have vegetarian burgers on their menu, which are really the only
  things worth eating, especially if you are a vegetarian or don't like all
  of the disgusting health side effects of ingesting greasy ground beef.

  Now there's this thing called a "meal" that you can order, and in this
  meal you get a burger and a drink and fries for a rate slightly lower than
  if you were to buy all three separately.  So here comes the problem.  What
  if you want to have the price benefits of a "meal," but don't believe that
  a meal should have to contain starchy, grease-soaked, strips of potato?
  The problem here is that unlike the burger, which at least has some
  nutrients to go along with the fat, cancer, etc., fries have NOTHING good
  for you in them.  They are mere filler, filling your stomach with space
  and bad things.  So why are we encouraged to order fries at every meal?

  Fries are cheap.  Fast food restaurants have the highest margin of profit
  on fries because potatoes cost nothing.  The only thing that they make
  more money on is pop, and I'm not sure about this but there may actually
  be more nutrients in pop than there is in fries.  So next time you order a
  meal, don't feel pressured to buy fries.  They're not good for you, and I
  believe that their existence is leading to the downfall of our society.
