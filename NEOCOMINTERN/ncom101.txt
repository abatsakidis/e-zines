                               EDITOR'S NOTE

        In this episode we're going to reminisce over you.  Yes I'm talking
to you, Neo-Comintern.  You who has allowed us to fill your pixels for a
beautiful 100 issues.  In this special installment (they're all pretty
special, actually) we are all going to take turns listing our favorite
articles that have made the page.  I'm going to start off by listing the
favorites that I have written, and then we will continue in, uh...
alphebetical order!  Jeah.

 ;P                              BMC'S TOP 5                               .b
 `q                                by BMC                                  p'
   `nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn'

        If I had to pick my five favorite articles, it would be a difficult
task.  I love them all as though they were my children, but some of them are
good children and some are bad children.  Some of them get to come out on
picnics with me and some don't even get to be in the family photos.  So
without further ado, here are the three, erh, I mean FIVE favorite articles
in my life.


5) Love's For Losers (Issue 90)

        It has been said be some readers of The Comintern that reading our
articles are similar to going on an acid trip.  Well, writing this article
was similar to an acid trip for me, I suppose partially because I was on acid
when I wrote it.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not an acid-head or anything, it
was my first time taking the substance, and this is the article that
resulted from it.  What I like about the article was that I chose an unlikely
target and ranted against it like it was nobody's business.  Whether read as
a bitter tirade against the concept of love or an ironic piece, the readers
love this one, and so do I.

4) How To Eliminate Unemployment In Eastern Canada (Issue 80)

        Cog and I wrote this during a coffee session at Saskatoon's beloved
all-night restaurant/gas station that we call The Voy.  It started off just
by goofin around about the Maritimes, and somewhere along the way it turned
into a fictional story of time travel.  I still don't gets it, but I luvs it!

3) Proteus VS Poseidon: The First Battle (Issue 55)

        Inspired by fatigue and alcohol, the late Komrade B and I co-wrote
this article and dedicated it to our one true love, Carlene.  We had written
several articles detailing Atlantis before this, but as the story reads,
"never have the tales been told with its two favorite sons together."  I know
that is grammatically incorrect and that it should have said "by its two
favorite..." but what can be said about that?  We were (are) young and
foolish and doing our best so shut the hell up.

2) The Wedding of Poseidon (Issue 70)

        Number two of the collaberative Tales of Atlantis tales, but number
one in my heart, this one has everything I've ever wanted to read in a short
story.  Love, anger, magic, passion, battle, and beautiful irony.  In this
magical tale we explore the childhood of the Atlantean heroes and come
closer to revealing the story behind the mysterious Weegie Knight.  Rest
assured that it will all be explained in time, and someday his time will
come to shine in the spotlight.  I hope I haven't given too much away.

1) Playing Make Believe (Issue 92)

        I always figured that we would stop doing The Comintern at issue 91.
When we finally got there I realized how little we had accomplished and how
much we had left to do.  I became inspired for a moment, and in that brief
period I penned the message that I feel lays behind all of my articles if you
cut through the irony.  The message is simple, and if I could get everyone
in the world to read one of my articles, this would be it.  It means a lot to
me, and so do you.


        Well those are my three favorite articles.  Make sure to read them
over and over again.  Thanks you.

   `nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn'

        Cog never wrote a top 5.  I guess that means his articles suck.

 `q                            by Gnarly Wayne                             p'
   `nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn'

    You might be saying to yourself, "Wow, Wayne, how can you possibly pick
your top 5 favorite articles of all time?"  To that I would respond, "How
about I get drunk?"  To that you would respond, "Aiight, bet."

    So I'm drunk and finally going to pick my top 5 favorite articles of all
time.


    #5: Why BRE is Better than Sex (Issue 65)

    This article is great if you've ever played the game Barren Realms Elite.
If you haven't, you won't be able to appreciate most of the humor in this
article.  Actually, now that I look at the work that I've done, most of it
is humor relating to inside jokes or totally obscure subjects.  Like I said
once before, "I'm not writting these articles for the general public's
enjoyment, I'm writting them for BMC's enjoyment."


    #4: MC Ren (Issue 45)

    All the Ren articles where funny in their own way.  I really enjoy
poking fun at the one form of music I truly love.  Hey, if you can't make fun
of something you love, why bother loving it all at?  Or something like that?


    #3: The Moose and I (Issue 76)

    Deviant from my normal writings, The Moose and I explores a whole new
realm of Wayne.  Guess what!  I wasn't sober when I wrote this either.  The
Moose and I is everything I believe in and nothing all at once, or some
fucking shiznit like dat.


    #2: Umar, Alfonso, and Bzarhands Saga (Issues 56, 59, 67, 68, 72, 84, 97)

    These stories were all completely and utterly freestyled on ICQ chat.
I guess that's why I love them so.
        
        P.S. I did some shrooms with Bzarhands last weekend and off in the
distance, Umar built a rainbarrel while I cried into the wind.


    #1: Tea Trek (Issues 43-44)

    There was another tea article where a bunch of rappers have tea
together, but I can't find it.  Tea Trek is my all time fav (at least in
this minute).  It combines humor that any Trekkie can get, with a nice
underlay of inside jokes and Zombies4Life humor.

(note: You can find Wayne's "other tea article," entitled Verbal Tea, in
issue 47 -BMC)


  d""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""b.
 ;P                          KOMRADE B'S TOP 5                             .b
 `q                      by The Late Sir Komrade B                         p'
   `nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn'

        #5: The Path to Drunkeness

        The Path to Drunkeness article first graced The Comintern in issue
Number 2, back on February 19th, 1998.  I believe this article really
captures the spirit of the revolution in the early days.  We were, as the
article implies, mostly drunk, and we liked to drink gin with cranberry
juice.  In fact, I wrote this article while very intoxicated on Gin, so read
and in joy.


        #4: Back To The Feudal Times

        Back To The Feudal Times always brings a smile to my face when I
read it.  It debuted in The Comintern, but also appeared in the
Neo-Comintern on March 30th, 1998 in installment #9.  It was one of the
first articles I ever wrote for The Comintern, and it bags on one of my
biggest pet peeves... education.  Returning to the past would be grand.  All
of us have thought about it, now see how it would unfold.  Fight the powers
that be, my friends.


        #3: My Quest For Racial Aspirations

        I wrote this article right after I wrote my number one article of
all time.  I think the creative juices were still flowing a bit.  I found
this article to be satisfying, if not very good.  What makes it better is
that it was based on a true story that occured early in my life.  To
expirence the drama, head on over to installment #59 which debuted on April
19th, 1999.


        #2: Sea Monstars (Not to be confused with sea monsters)

        The pundits consider this article to be one of my finer works.  It
even graced the pages of one of the Neo-Comintern hardcopies.  If you are
a long time reader of The Comintern, then you could say that on July 26, 1998
in installment #27 The Comintern lost all credibility.


        #1: My Conversion to Judiasm

        As an accomplished writer, I find that creativity comes in spurts,
and this article came in one of those spurts.  As I was writing it, I found
myself thinking this was a platinum hit, and I believe I was right.  BMC
even said readers wrote in expressing their pleasure, but he could have been
just flattering.  If you want to see the cream of my crop then look no
further then Installment #91 which debuted on January 4th, 2000 (I think I
died shortly after its release).
