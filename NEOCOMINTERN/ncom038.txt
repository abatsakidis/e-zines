        Racism evolves from ignorance. In order to bring awareness about
zombies, and to stop zombie racism, I have compiled a short piece on zombies'
and their plight.

        Zombies are created from the corpses of humanoids or even animals.
As long as the flesh has not totally decomposed (this would create a
skeleton), an evil cleric of at least 5th level can "resurrect" the corpse
into a zombie.  This cleric can then either control this zombie to do his
will or let the zombie loose into civilization to make his wayne thru life.
If the evil cleric happens to die, all zombies under his control are released
from his cruel reign.

        When a zombie first enters society, it will be confused and
disorientated.  All it is used to is shambling around and attacking stuff.
It will take awhile for the zombie to adjust to this new lifestyle, but you
can help ease the zombie into a common lifestyle but treating him like any
other person.

        This is more difficult than a person may think.  It is difficult to
understand what they are saying, they usually don't smell the greatest, and
their clothes are mediocre at best.  This is because no one will take the
time to tell them the boundaries and taboos of society.

Common misconceptions about zombies:

- zombies don't have feelings.
- zombies don't play well with others.
- zombies have a hard time adapting to a democracy.
- zombies don't know how to party.

        The list goes on.  To give you more insight to zombies, I conducted
an interview with a zombie of the highest esteem, Sir Ronald Hampton,
Esquire.

Me: "So, Sir Ronald, in being a zombie and having to face the ignorance that
     stems from being a zombie, please paraphrase the magnificent story on
     how you became knighted."

Ron: "Nnneeaarrghhh.  RAAAAAR!  uuughhhnnneerraa.  yyyeeeeeeellllla.  ark.
      baaarrrrcraaannnbeerrrryyyy.  Peace!"

Me: "Fascinating.  In all your travels, local and abroad, what is the most
     extreme case you've ever come across?"

Ron: "Wwaaaarrggggg.  nnnrrrraarrrmm.  aaahhhwwttt, aaaxxxxxxx.  dookkkk.
      oooohhhh rraaaappppppp eeennnnn stiiiiiiinnnnee."

Me: "Really?  I'd never expect that from a cantelope.  Carrying on, is it 
     true that all zombies are adamantine supporters of left-wing thought?"

Ron: "Tttaaagggggyesooooollll.  Doooo krruucccusss biiiiizzzzzz ma ma." 

Me: "Werd!  I hear ya.  How do you feel about the society for the living
     impaired I've created, EFIL4SEIBMOZ?"

Ron: "I think it's great."

Me: "Thank you, Sir Ronald, for a most entertaining interview."

        According to a poll taken recently after I thought of it, an
astonishing 94% of employers said they were happy with their zombie
employees.  In fact, an amazing 72% said that zombies were better workers
than a human.  They don't need sleep, never complain, and can be paid less
due to a grossly misinformative legislature.

        Unfortunetly, 89% of companies without zombies currently on the
payroll said they would not hire a zombie.  This cannot be taken to court
under job discrimination either, as the law does not currently see zombies as
having any rights.  Well, if you cut them, do they not bleed?  If you punch
them, do they not feel pain?  If you ....  uhhhh I guess not.

Anywayne, be nice to zombies or we'll ... I mean, they'll eat you alive!

        Have you ever seen a goblin?  Probably not, but now upon the thought,
you sincerely wish you had.  Not many people have ever seen a true life
goblin, but I have encountered several of them in the dense forests of
Nottingham, including a rare red goblin named Gobbie Gee, whom I claimed as
my own personal pet, forerunner of communism within the goblin community, and
chief mascot of the N-Com.

        Gobbie Gee is a simple creature, with a grade 3 education, and a
basic understanding of bowing and fletching.  He is rather happy go lucky
despite the fact that I beat him in regular intervals of 2 hours.  He may be
only four feet tall, but he seems to intimidate young and old ladies as we
walk through the downtown streets of Cincinnati, Nebraska.

        I trained him from a sapling (yes, he was once a tree), at first by
months of starving and beating him.  After a while, he started to take on
goblinesque characteristics, and one day he was flesh and blood.  It was
quite mysterious indeed.  All that I can remember of that fall of 1763 is
that I saw a black flash in the sky as Gobbie Gee took life from the gods.

        At that time, I was known by the pseudonym of Marquis de Sade, and
I was a young radical preparing for the industrial revolution which I knew
would make us all rich by the vast production of copper.  It was not until
years later that I began sodomizing young goblins and 17 year old girls.

        At around that time, Gobbie Gee and I also co-wrote the bible.  That
Sodom and Gomorrah story was his idea, not mine.  He also suggested adding
a second half to the book based on the life of some guy named Jesus, but upon
hearing his idea I instantly slit his gobblie throat.  Then I took his
fictional stories of "Jesus" and incorporated them in what would become one
of the best selling books of all time.

        Sometimes when I look at the night's red sky, I envision Gobbie Gee,
and as he whispers at me "be my valentine", I break down and cry tears of
blood for him.
