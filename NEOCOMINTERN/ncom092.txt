                               EDITOR'S NOTE

        Now is the day for smooth awareness.

        Heading into the new whatever and also into another era of The
Comintern means a lot to me.  I never ever would have expected to surpass
ninety-one issues back when we started.  In fact, I used to say that we
would probably end at issue ninety-one.  When I used to get frustrated, when
the issues weren't selling, when I couldn't get the print zine going on
schedule, when the ideas weren't coming, I used to say, "as soon as we hit
91, that's it."

        Well I guess I lied about that.  Here's issue 92 and a new day for
the Comintern.  Since this occasion is so special to me, I have tried writing
something a little bit different for all of the beloved readers.  I hope you
enjoy it as we have enjoyed your patronage and feedback over the first 91.

        The Wayne the Wayne the wiggitty wiggitty wiggitty Wayne has a
grievance with the A&E channel.  He didn't appreciate their top 100
biographies special that featured the most important people of the
millennium, so he has rewritten the top 10.  I think he was mostly pissed off
because Leonardo Da Vinci wasn't high enough on their list, but I will leave
that for you to decide.

        Read, read, read, and watch the Neo-Comintern as we prove ourselves
to be what Toni referred to as "the Alpha that hath no Omega."

        Nothing is smoother than smooth awareness.

 ;P                         PLAYING MAKE BELIEVE                           .b
 `q                                by BMC                                  p'

        It seems that amidst the hustle and bustle of the 00's, people in
society have lost track of what it takes to be happy.  It seems that
somewhere along the way the ideal of striving for happiness and contentment
has been lost and replaced in a struggle to see who can gain the greatest
excess of wealth.  Note that I call it an excess, because I believe that
having more money and goods than we need benefits us in no way.  It seems
that the freedom to financially succeed or fail is the biggest source of
undue stress in a capitalist society.  Ninety percent of the population is
going to fail financially and the remaining ten percent is going to exploit
their labour.  Since there is no realistic way that we can get ahead in
life, why do we even bother?  Why do we bust our asses at the minimum wage
jobs when we could be making the same amount collecting welfare?  Why do we
work for low wages when we know that the fruits of our labour puts more
money in the bank account of our employer than into our own wallet?  The
simple answer is that it is self-defeating to live our lives in the niches
that society has placed us in, so instead we should break from the pattern
and live life as individuals.

        Since we have no hope for success in the capitalist system we must
instead seek success in terms of leading the most satisfying life we possibly
can.  This probably doesn't mean working 60 hours a week for minimun wage
plus time-and-a-half for the overtime.  It means choosing what you really
want to be doing in life and doing it no matter how it affects your financial
position on the wealth-o-meter.  Think of what you would be doing for a
living if every job paid the same amount.

        Now you should have your dream job in mind, so the next step is to
wipe from your mind the propaganda that the only way you can be successful
is to make lots of money.  Give up on the tomorrow that never comes, and
begin to live life for today.  Strive for your goal.  If you keep it in mind
then you will not be conquered by false visions of wealth or the trickery
of the capitalists.  You can have happiness today, you just have to toggle
the switch inside of your mind.

        Enjoy the present.  Spend this year as though it were your last.

        Plato spoke of a metaphorical cave of darkness that we all live in.
We spend our entire lives chained to the floor with our backs to the mouth
of the cave.  On the back wall of the cave we can see the shadows of trees,
birds, and other shadow-casting things.  From these shadows we attempt to
determine what life means, but the sensory input we recieve remains severely
limited.  Imagine that one day you become free from the chains.  You leave
the cave and see the bright lights, the beautiful colours, the night sky,
the rushing water and the breezy meadows.  You return to the cave to share
your knowledge with the rest, but they are unable to understand you.  Some
refuse to believe, some are frightened, some are angered.  You have become a
part of the real world, you have seen for yourself and become an individual,
and now you can never be content or accepted within the cave for the rest of
your life.  The world has become yours, and you can never return to the
darkness.  This cave can represent any form of enlightenment, any freedom of
the mind, and this is what we should strive for as human beings.  The mouth
of the cave, the secret to happiness.

        There are a few things better than having money.  The best of all
things is happiness, because it conquers all other things.  No problem is a
serious one to a person who maintains a positive attitude.

        There are two kinds of happiness.  The artificial stuff can be
gained by acquiring a new possession, falling in love, listening to a new
song, using drugs, watching a movie, or forgetting about your problems in
some other way.  These are all temporary, because they dissolve once the
novelty has been lost.  There is another kind of happiness which is much more
powerful, and this is what the crazies refer to as being high on life.  It
seems like the more we struggle for the unattainable goal of climbing the
ladder of capitalism the less aware we become of our personal power as human
beings.  We have the power to make other people happy, we have the power to
control ourselves, we have the power to fight in whatever battles we choose,
we have the right to follow the beat of whichever drum we think has the
funkiest beat.  We have the power to be happy today.  We have the power to be
content now, yet continue to work toward our dreams.

        We can enjoy the beauty of nature.  We can taste the plants which
grow from the fertile earth.  We can play make-believe.  We can hug each
other.  We can dream.  We can love ourselves.

        We can.

        We will.

 ;P                THE TOP 10 BIOGRAPHIES OF THE MILLILLINIEUM             .b
 `q                            by Gnarly Wayne                             p'
   `nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn'

        I recently saw A & E's Top 25 or 100 or whatever biographies of the
last thousand years and found it to be horribly Americanized and unjust.
Since I don't want to think of 25 or 100 biographies to do, I'm going to do
the top 10, bastardized Wayne-style.

10. Alan Reed: Man, Reeds voice is the most recognizable voice in the whole
        world.  Years after his tragic trip to Suburabia, he still makes me
        laugh.  Espcially when he says things like "A ha ha ha" and "How'd ya
        like a snootful of this?" (referring to his fist).

9. Captain Commando: When it's time to smackdown the evil plans of an evil
        fiend, you know who's up in that action.  But who are you?
        I'm ........ "Captain Commando".

8. Goosey Loosey: The pivotal character in the most influential story of the
        millillinieim (I forgot what it's called).  Goosey Loosey tells
        Foxy Loxy what the real deal is, showing us that, we too, can all
        say stuff to other people.

7. Prozac: The unknowing (still) mentor to the great empire of the Sons of
        Prozac, whose vast realm quickly spread over the planets of the
        galaxy in "The Time of Rhyme and Spreadin" of 2089-2108.
        (oops, sorry.. that's next millillinieim).

6. Ant Banks: Bringing more joy than possible to the world through music,
        Ant Banks totally rocked the 14th century and single handedly brought
        an end to the Dark Ages.

5. Athena Asamiya: "She's just a little girl, with powers inside..... burning
        bright."  Pyscho Soldier has done much for the cause of peace and
        love, fighting through many enemies in an arena like setting.  When
        she won the KOF tournament in 1201, she won love for the world to
        share, and she got some golds as well.

4. Planetary Master Mista Iggy: His iron fisted rule over the barren realms
        in 1674 helped keep peace in the land and take all the baronies into
        a new age.  While Mista Iggy was Planetary Master, the world enjoyed
        many new technological breakthroughs, both medicinal and industrial.
        While the planet was not focused on war, but on peace, the pirates
        of the barren realms were all but crushed.  Unfortunetly, Mista
        Iggy' rule came to an end in 1745 when he became bored and abdicated.
        One never know what happened to him.  Rumor has it that just before
        his abdication, he discovered the secret of immortality.  One can
        only hope that he will resurface and take what is rightfully his.
        (Rumors are spreading that Mista Iggy has resurfaced in Trinidad)

3. Emporer Shen Nung: Even though Shen Nung's dynasty was in the 27th
        century BC, the discovery of tea continues to be the single most
        important discovery ever.  Century after century, tea continues to
        rock my fucking ass.

2. Ron Jeremy: Ron Jeremy rules!

1. Da Vinci: This cool cat has done it all man.  Artist, inventor,
        philosopher, scientist, hardcore emcee, ladies dream......
        nothing can keep a good Da Vinci down.  This awesome dude probably
        even invented the printing press, only to have it stolen by that
        fucker, Steve Guttenburg.  In fact, while I'm being completely
        ignorant, I think Da Vinci invented and painted everything and
        everyone else just stole it from him.  I hope Da Vinci comes back
        in a huge Mech Warrior and beats the crap out of all the scientists
        and artists.  And he give extra beats to people who didn't think he
        should get the #1 spot in A & E's Biographies of the millillieium.
        (Whew, I'm safe.)
