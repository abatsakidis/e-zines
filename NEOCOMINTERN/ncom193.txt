  True Story of this Morning:

  Sunday morning is when Neo-Comintern issues are put together.  As I woke
  up this morning, I was feeling a bit sluggish because I had only slept for
  five hours last night.  As I proceeded to N-Com HQ, I created a layout and
  editor's note in my head.  But, as you all know, when composing intricate
  webs within the brain, one must be able to stay in a flexible and
  heightened state.  When pushing one's reasoning to the outstretches, any
  little distraction can increase the tension, eventually snapping the
  strand of thought.

  Ahem.  I got here, N-Com HQ, and guess what?  I found out that there is a
  blackout.  It could be hours before I reach a computer.  If this message
  reaches you, please know that my death was not in vain.  It warns about
  the blahblahblah of somethingsomethingsomething.

  Right?

  Right?

  Actually, my point was that it broke my train of thought.  So there I was,
  sitting around and waiting for the power to go on, when I decided to look
  at some notes I had written on my portable notetaking device.  There I
  beheld some amazing words that I had indeed written, but did not remember
  writing.  It takes me back to a time of approximately two weeks ago.
  Please come on this voyage through time with me:

  [Two weeks ago:]

  I got my wisdom teeth pulled.  All of them.  When I was given Ibuprofin
  and T3 with my antibiotics, I believed that I was supposed to take them
  every six hours along with the antibiotics.  Apparently you are only
  supposed to take them as needed, so I spent the first week high off my ass
  on codeine and painkillers.  I don't remember anything that happened that
  week.

  It all started in the office.  They gave me this gas that made me laugh
  and I didn't even know why I was laughing.  Then they gave me a needle and
  I closed my eyes and it seemed like the next time I opened them was when I
  was in the next room.  But I actually got my teeth pulled out, holes
  drilled in my jaw, the skin of my gums peeled back like a cap, and all that
  stuff.  I didn't remember a thing.  Apparently, another thing that I
  didn't remember was an important note that I wrote to myself on my
  portable notetaking device.  I only use this device when I get ideas for
  stories, so I know this was supposed to be an article, poem, or short
  story.  Can you tell which?


    [Untitled Work, composed in drug-induced blackout]

  While I admit that this work is not my best, it certainly ranks among
  those that are the most peculiar.  On that note, I think you will agree
  with me that the recently discovered work is much better as an editor's
  note than as a column.  In this issue you will get a chance to read two
  pieces, one by Amhed Balfouni, and one by Melatonin.  Both of these
  writers are bold, poetic, and also quite strange.  These guys are real
  N-Com superstars, so I'll leave the rest of the issue to them.

  the matamore of Bobadil
  he were a very pretty fellow
  with his bit of Ribband on his sleeve
  and his poison pen yellow

  bless you Sir 'a was a good man
  in a bad time Sir
  round about he drove
  mad as any March hare Sir
  yet who would not be so mad
  in quest of a Spanish Main
  it were a long time pissing out
  the conflagration in Pudding Lane
  he waked as out of a bad dream
  the signification of which was
  Mallarmé or Frost his woodchuck
  or his navigator's art
  until at last slept out at door
  my gallant gentleman no more

                               ALLERGY GLASSES
                     (From the Odd Life of Jonny Strange)
 -    -   -  - -- -------======{by Melatonin}=======------- -- -  -   -    -

  Like all men, the man began as a boy, and the boy was born into a world 
  overrun by corporate slogans and capitalist propaganda.  At first it 
  didn't bother him, or, if it did, it did so only slightly.  A rash 
  here, a bit of a cough there.  Nothing his parents couldn't dismiss as 
  the traditional, minor illnesses of a newborn babe.  But at five the 
  symptoms increased -- mumps, measles, the flu every day at school, 
  swollen glands during Saturday morning cartoons.  Finally the boy's 
  parents took their son to an allergist and after a comprehensive series 
  of specialized tests, it was soon determined that Jonny Strange, only 
  child of Bob and Ella Strange, was, in fact, allergic to advertising. 

  That was twenty years ago, and after a long hard life lived mostly 
  indoors, in dank basement cellars and cramped, mothy attics, free from 
  TVs, radios, magazines, labels, and any other object that could 
  infiltrate Jonny's sloganless world, a change finally came. Bob and 
  Ella passed from old age within weeks of each other, and poor Jonny, 
  sheltered, pale, and utterly out of the cultural loop, found himself 
  confronted first with an endless onslaught of bills, and later the 
  sleepless vigilance of the repo man. 

  Our hero was given a scant two weeks to reintigrate into society, which 
  would seem like a stretch, given this eccentric tale, but Jonny had a 
  secret up his sleeve.  Having spent the bulk of his life lost 
  and forgotten in the cracks of society, he had developed a key skill: 
  scavenger invention, culled to perfection out of years of boredom and 
  isolation.  Jonny could build almost anything out of anything, and it 
  was this that he fell back on now, in his time of utmost crisis.  All 
  that stood between him and freedom was a pair of glasses, pieced 
  together from boxes of broken electronics and bits of rusted machinery, 
  that, like a mute button for the world, had the amazing ability of 
  "blocking out" every piece of advertising society could throw at him.  

  And so Jonny placed the finishing touches on his priceless invention 
  and, trembling with fear and anticipation, tried them on for the first 
  time one chilly autumn night. With clutched chest he quickly stumbled 
  into his parents' old bedroom and peered deep, deep into his father's 
  classic Coca-Cola mirror -- an act that under any other circumstance 
  would have been suicidal.  Jonny stared and waited, counting the 
  seconds and sweating all over.  Finally, after a full minute, the first 
  symptom appeared.  A nose bleed, black and warm.  Jonny wiped the two 
  running lines aside and leaned in, challenging the mirror, his mind 
  reeling with the wonderful, terrible wait.  But in the end there were 
  no more problems, and Jonny, drunk with the joy of newfound freedom, 
  threw his head back and yelled to the Heavens, "My invention has 
  worked. Oh thank you, thank you, my invention has worked!" 

  And the next day, after eight thankless hours on the job, the repo man 
  stopped into his favourite bar for a cold mug of beer, bearing with him 
  strange stories of a mysterious man-child who whistled a happy tune as 
  he lost his home forever.
