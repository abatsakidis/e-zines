        When walking down the street two days ago I saw a face that looked
very much like the face of Komrade B.  It looked so much like him, in fact,
that when I passed it I said "Hey Berry, how's it goin?" and he said "Pretty
good, man!"  Was it an angel?

        It is impossible to mess with it.  It creates and destroys
everything.  It is more powerful than God, more respected than Jesus, yet
slightly less popular than the Beatles.  It is everyone's deepest fear
and their most explicit sexual fantasy.  It is as peaceful as sleep, yet as
disturbing as a premature awakening to a fire alarm.  It is so amazing that
it can not be fully described from a technical perspective.  It is the tree,
it is the star, it is the blade of grass.  It is MASTERBALL!  Oh no wait, it
is the atom.

        It makes up everything, yet it is nothing by itself.  It is a single
letter in a manuscript, a pixel on a screen, a speck of dust on a planet.
It is a particle less than a speck of dust in the entire universe, but it is
also every every particle, comprising every speck of dust and everything else
as well.  It is the common bond that comprises every human being.  It is the
soul.  It is what makes us up, it is what leaves our bodies without our
knowledge, and when it leaves it is replaced by more of itself.  It is not
only the Earth and the moon, but everything in between.

        When we see nothing we see the atom.  When we look through the clear
air, we are looking through atoms.  Is this actually science?  WOW.  I guess
it makes sense, but it's still kinda shitty if you ask me.  I guess that for
those of us who aren't sciencetists, science might as well be the popular
religion of the day.  I have never seen any proof of any of this stuff, but
I really want to believe in my friend the atom.  SOmebody has got to show me
one of those microscopes that you can see atoms with sometime.  Then they
will have to prove to me that the machine works and that what I'm looking at
is actually an atom.  And then they have to convince me that my eyes are not
decieving me and that I am actually standing in the room with them and
looking through the microscope.  I just have to make sure it is reality and
not an illusion, dream, fantasy, or something else.  That's all I ask!

        Ok, that's pretty much all I ASKED for... until last Thursday.  This
guy told me (and I won't reveal his name because he is a former Nazi war
criminal) that there is only one atom, and it whips around the whole universe
and comprises everything!  Apparently is works the same way as it does in the
comic book where the superb hero is able to run to the other side of the room
fast enough that he can beat the speed of light and look at the reflection
coming from where he was standing.  So now it turns out that there is this
one over-worked atom just zipping all over the damn place and doing all the
work!  The guy had some good points, but I don't remember them.  You'll just
have to trust me on this one.

        So where does that leave us with the atom?  The acknowledgement of
this damn atom means that the sun, the earth, the people, the plates, the
stove, the face, the second face, and hickory sticks are all made of this one
stupid particle!  So if that is all we are, what fucking difference does it
make if some girl gets pregnant, if some team wins a sporting event, or if
people live or die?  It's just one stupid atom anyway.  You know what?
I don't care anymore.  I'm sick of microanalyzing things, cause this is where
it leads every single time without fail.  Nihilism.  If you have been paying
close attention to what you have been reading, you are probably feeling
pretty crappy right now too, so I'll end this article off with a little song
to cheer you up.

                 Chimes, chimes, chimes, chimes, 1, 2, 3.
             Chimes, chimes, chimes, chimes, will you marry me?

                                     Paix!

        Hey, I just thought of something else.  Even though atoms give us all
that crappy stuff like close relation to all physical objects and a sense of
nihilism, they also work with lots of life after death theories.  The notion
of a soul seems to work because your essence, your atoms, continue to exist
forever.  In that sense, we are all immortal.  Reincarnation also works,
because all of the atoms that we lose eventually become part of other
organisms.  Those are two beliefs that I have heard of, and it seems logical
for me to believe in them now tha I believe in atoms.  That cheers me up a
bit.  If anyone wants to discuss atoms with me, I will be availiable (in
some form or another) until the end of eternity, so drop me a line.

One day as Alfonso was fixing rain barrels (and some of them still had
rain in them.... what a nut!), Umar came over with a whole truckload of
illegal drugs.

"Yo, Al, Can I Start This?", he said.

"Doo dat shit, phukk dat beetch.", replied Alfonso.

After doing two rain barrel bowls worth of various drugs, they started
feeling good.

"Man, I need another toke for my third eye", said Alfonso.

"Why oh why?", Umar giggled uncontrolably.

They both heard a knock on the door, but the signal from their brain to
their legs was taking a really long time.

The knocking continued however.

After a couple more knocks (and 1 scream) the door suddenly blasted into
3 large fragments and from the dusty entranceway stepped in a man.

Named Bzarhands.

"Hey, guys.... what up?", he quipped.

"Druuuuugggggs", slurred Umar.

"Druegars!?!?!?? HERE?!?!?!?!", shrugged Bzarhands.

Flames spew forth from his hands as he took off in a cloud of fire and ash.

He flew around the ceiling light for awhile cause he thought it was the moon
and that's how he navigated at night.

But he ran into the fridge and flopped on the floor for awhile.

Umar and Alfonso laughed.

Me too.

THE END
Buy my baking soda!
