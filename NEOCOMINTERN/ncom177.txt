        Whoo!  Happy Rememberance, Y'all!  Whoooooooooooo!  Have a great
        day!  Let's have some fun tonight, make a chicken tonight even
        though we are vegetarians!  Get drunk even though we are
        alcoholics!  And do some wild-ass crazy shit just because we can!

 -    -   -  - -- -------========={by BMC}==========------- -- -  -   -    -

  So how about a thump of the chest in support of the primate savages that
  beat their balls against the enemy and pommel their foes in defence of our
  village's banana supply.

  But nobody's going to buy that bullshit.  We know there is no ballsy
  protector like there was in those times.  There are no heroes of war like
  Napoleon.  That's because these leaders are never out on the battlefield.

  First of all, we must compare all of the legendary warriors such as
  Ghengis Kahn, Hannibal, Charlemagne, etc., all of whom engaged in battle
  alongside their troops, to the bunch of utter cowards who sit in a
  distant location and commands their hired soldiers to press buttons that
  will murder civilians.  Well pardon me for saying that there is something
  much more heartless and inhumane about this type of war than there is in
  the kind that we romanticize.  An email-gets sent across to a computer in
  a distant land saying, "Nuclear bombing will commence in 30 seconds."
  How would you spend those thirty seconds?  Would you cry?  Would you
  think of people you missed.  Would you think of dying a virgin or at
  least one who has been unwillingly chaste for too long?  Would you think
  of what projects you were working on and how it was a waste of time doing
  them?  Would you just slide into the destruction of civilization along
  with the morality of our unfairly chosen and unjustifiably powerful
  figureheads?  Why does one small group of powerful people that are
  chosen unfairly by the elites of society have complete power over all of
  us?  And before you say that the vote is equal and that one person
  equals one vote and therefore it is not just elites that choose who gets
  in, ask yourself this: Would someone win an election if they could not
  afford a campaign manager or supporters?  Without a chance to make
  themselves known to everyone?  Without a real  chance for competition, as
  the working class person finds themselves: without a chance to determine
  their own path.

  You think I am digressing, and perhaps I am, but look at these cold
  warriors who never engage in battle and think about why there aren't
  warriors anymore.  Warriors, like workers, cannot hold power without
  owning the machinery, in this case the machinery of war.  Richer country =
  better weapons.  So the richer country can wipe out another country,
  sending a fraction of the people over there.

  I was just thinking about something else.  I have lived in Saskatoon for
  24 years, the same amount as hours in a day, and in the same
  neighbourhood since I was born.  I usually hate that, but I still
  wouldn't want to find out one day that I have to evacuate the city
  because some other country's government was about to come and destroy
  the 109 years of development that is Saskatoon City.  Furthermore, they
  would be destroying Factoria, which would wind up with Cog's spiral into
  nihilism and VLT gambling, ultimately destroying his spirit along with
  his soul (I imagine his body is invulnerable).  Oh god, you see it is
  hard for me to stick to this topic because it is so painful -  I make
  light of it so that I can muster the bravery to think of the terrible
  atrocity that I must now think about.

  If they told me that I had to leave, that I had to evacuate my city, how
  would I feel?  I would kill myself.  No, I wouldn't, I'm not brave and
  selfish enough for that.  I think I would be the kind who would be in
  denial.  I would think, "Well they never said what day they would bomb,
  so maybe I can stay in the city for one more day."  To be quite honest, I
  don't know what the fuck I'd do.  I've never thought about this before,
  and I think it is a really horrible and painful thing to try to
  visualize, and, to be honest, it is quite devastating.  I don't
  understand how people can do this.  How people can be so cold as to kill
  someone in another country without having to stir and without
  understanding what it is like on the other side.  To me, that is a sign
  of a decision maker who is not wise.  The heroic decision makers are
  those who are notorious for their compassion.

  Bah, none of this is making sense.  It is stuff that I wanted to express,
  but it all came out at the same time and, quite pathetically, it never
  actually said anything of importance.  There is no way I can explain my
  horror for war and hatred for the cowardly warrior poseurs who have not a
  god damned thing to add to our society but the threat of the murder of
  civilians like us, the masses!  Gaddammit, in out media-inspired quest for
  individuality, we're forgetting about the "us," the community of people
  that this world holds but segments through tools such as the mainstream
  media and emphasis on the nuclear family.

  In closing, I would like to make a plea that people like me be free from
  getting murdered just because they live in the wrong fucking country.




                                                   But they have
                                           !!  /   done nothing!

                            kill them first.


  By all means, celebrate this Remembrance Day, but if you do, acknowledge
  that you are in denial.

  The fact is that we don't have to remember the past in order to think of
  the atrocities of war.  We can just turn on any news channel to hear how
  the crusade for oil fares.  If there is something for us to remember on
  November 11th, isn't supposed to be how shitty war is and how we don't
  want people off in other countries killing innocent people for the purpose
  of making money?

  So this is what I am Remembering on this day.  That war is inhumane.  That
  I will gladly pay a few more cents per litre if it means that people don't
  have to be murdered for it.  Yes, we need to see an end to terrorism, but
  that should not be achieved through terrorism.  The means are ends in
  themselves, man.  We don't need to do this.

  What do people in other countries do when we are celebrating the eleventh
  hour?

  You know what the end of the war reminds me of?  That big wall they used
  to separate people in Germany.

  When we celebrate Remembrance Day we wear faux bullet-wounds on our
  chests that are made of environmentally unfriendly plastic but would
  smell like opiates.

  Canada vignettes
  Don't show the war crimes we committed
  No war is won without war crimes
  AN ATOMIC BOMB IN HIROSHIMA
  How do they celebrate Remembrance Day?
  They have more dead than we do, so their celebration must be even more
  regal.
  Or maybe they don't deal with it as we do.

  Huzzah for all the wars we've fought and God bless the souls of the people
  who leapt at the chance to go overseas to kill for the Empire.

  "But it's not a celebration," says one as they watch the special program
  or go toward the congregation or walk in the national parade, "it's a
  time to remember."

  I hate holidays, and I hate being told when to remember, what to remember,
  and how to go about all of it.  How far can we allow society to shape our
  minds?  Why must we revere war in order to fit in?  Why is our society so
  geared toward fitting in?  I have a mind of my own, and I can choose to
  think about whatever I want.

  -I don't want to think about the 61% I got because I didn't study
  -I don't want to think about violence
  -I don't want to think about people being beaten to death by mobs
  -I don't want to think about how many people have had to be murdered so
   that our government hasn't had to compromise
  -I don't want to think about being shot in the face, burned alive, or
   eaten by dogs
  -I don't want to think of the bloody, warry past

(and now, back to reality...)

  And what the fuck was I thinking of back then?  Where was I in the world
  that the last thing I remembered about war was World War two?  Germany
  this and that?  Well what about Kosovo?  What the fuck about that?  God
  dammit I am such a fucking hypocrite to look at this world and want to
  make things better when I can't even acknowledge how fucking terrible
  they are.  Maybe it's time for a slap of reality to wipe that apathy
  away.  Who knows?


  note to self:
  Is it enough to just hate war and put it out of your mind?  No!  Show some
  fucking courage!  Stand up to end war you fucking hypocrite!  I will never
  respect you until you do!
