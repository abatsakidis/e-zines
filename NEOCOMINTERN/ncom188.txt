  From the depths of France, Margarina Cataclysma has managaed to send a
  message to her adoring Neo-Comintern readers.  Unortunately, I believe
  there has been a mix-up and that we got the wrong letter through some sort
  of unlucky error.  Nevertheless, the letter is here for your reading
  pleasure, and it is my sincere hope that someone somewhere in Paris,
  reading a letter to N-Com readers, decides (for some reason) to offer
  Margarina a job.  

  And that's all I have to say.  I'm tapdancing my way out of here!

                            A LETTER FROM FRANCE           
 -    -   -  - -- -------={by Margarina Cataclysma}=------- -- -  -   -    - 

  Merchant,

  Archetypical Petty-Bourgeois,

  Parasite upon PURE THOUGHT,

  I salute you, you without knowledge of what circumstances contrived to put 
  us each in our respective places,

  To my detriment, and possibly to your great dismay, but also possibly not, 
  I am without a valid working Visa, here in France.  However, and this is
  the crucial point, my ineligibility to work does not imply unwillingness
  to work.  In fact, I am eager, and it is for this reason I am writing you
  now.

  I should like to begin with a discussion of my assets; that is to say, the
  skills I possess, by which your firm might profit.  My early years (by
  which I mean the years prior to this year) were spent in Canada.  I have a
  facile and fluid grasp of all the English languages, which, as you must
  know, are spoken by all denizens of the illustrious Commonwealth, as well
  as residents of the American republic and refined souls everywhere.
  Indeed, English has become something of a lingua franca.  My French,
  however, is rotten (although, as you must know, this tongue is also spoken
  amongst many Canadians including, shamefully, my own family, who
  detestably neglected to instruct me in the Arts of this dialect).  When I
  say rotten, I mean improving by leaps and bounds, and in fact I intend
  that your customers, should you give me the privilege, will aid my
  progress.  Of course language is the most rudimentary skill -- merely a
  clumsy means of making contact with the eternal values of the mind -- and
  I shall speak no more of it.

  It is no exaggeration to say that I am exceedingly well read, yet have
  never wasted my time reading when I could be out of doors.  Moreover, I am
  a partisan of intellectual coöperation.  Hugo wrote: "sous la forme
  imprimée, la pensée est impérissable, volatile, indestructible. Du temps
  de l'architecture, elle se faisait montagne, maintenant elle se fait
  troupe d'oiseaux, s'éparpille aux quatre vents, occupe tous les points de
  l'espace.  On peut démolir une masse, non extirper l'ubiquité.  Vienne le
  déluge, la montagne disparaît, mais les oiseaux volent encore."  I am the
  four winds, scattering the little birds of wisdom, while I fear you are
  the mountain, rained on.

  In terms of the more mundane aspects of this job, I have full
  comprehension of the alphabetical system of organization.  I also have
  some numeracy, and if occasion or whim demands I make fabulous graphs,
  including those with multiple coördinate axes.  I do not expect you to
  make full use of my talents.  On my previous visit I observed disorderly
  piles of hastily written pulps; the improbable persistence of these
  intemperate conditions, especially in view of property values in this
  Sodom and the flaccidity of your so-called customer base -- all this
  convinces me that you cannot expect very much from your employees.
  Indeed, not being familiar with persons of my caliber, you can have no
  basis for expecting more than the most mongreloid [by which I mean a
  canine of uncertain parentage] fumblings.

  It must be apparent by now that my skills are incomparable.  Therefore, it
  remains only to negotiate a salary.  It might well be tolerable to sit
  with you, crazy eights or whatever it is that you do to while away your
  time, all the while pulling in 'triple digits'.  Probably, it is
  unreasonable of me to expect, dream, such glory.  I daresay, if permitted
  some hours amongst your aging bestsellers, I would be content to remove
  one or two, liberating space for the more erudite titles I will suggest,
  thus reviving the public's flagging interest in your stock.  As you can
  see, my purpose is multiplicitous.

  Do not insult me with more questions on related topics.  If you remain
  curious, but find yourself unable to infer what little other information
  you might like to have, remember that in fact I am merely seeking
  employment.  Do not for an instant entertain fantasies that I might assist
  in the production of tedious offspring that you may or may not dream of
  installing in this dim world, later to infect them with your obviously
  peculiar brand of nightmare.

  Prepare yourself for my visit, perhaps by clearing your agenda in the
  afternoon of Tuesday week, and we shall have a brief conference.  Do not 
  trouble yourself about the exact hour since prescience is impossible in 
  these matters.

  (I am not yet sufficiently acquainted with you to have settled on an 
  appropriate closing.  Until then, I remain,)


  Margarina Cataclysma

  He stopped for a moment as he opened the small door.  He looked around,
  saw the slurpee machine, the rows of chips and chocolate bars,
  advertisements plastered on the walls, and the clerk behind the counter.
  He scanned for familiar faces, saw none, and committed himself to that
  most heinous act.

  He put the styrofoam cup in the door, closed it, and pressed the one
  minute button.

  As he gazed in to see the cup of noodles on the rotating plate, he caught
  his own reflection in the glass.  He turned away quickly, unable to stand
  the sight of himself.  He had once been a chef, but after the convenience
  store opened up next to the restaurant he worked in, business was slow and
  they had to lay him off.  Now, in a final twist of irony, he had spent his
  last dollar in the very store that had ruined his life.

  When his supper was ready, he unwrapped the plastic fork, preparing to eat
  what would be his last meal.
