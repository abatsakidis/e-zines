        In the 15,000th turn, the denizens of the faceless world found
themselves reaching the limits of their borders and exploring the last of
the barren realms.  Since the entire world was settled and all of the
monarchs had signed peace treaties, there was no choice but to conquer
through interplanetary ops.  Technology was high and industry was low, and
as man ventured forth into space, they crossed paths several times with the
evil space pirates known as The Solarians.

        The Solarians were frighteningly small, about the size of a thousand
angels dancing on the head of a pin, and it was rumoured that had come from
a distant place called the Solar Realms Elite.  They attacked in hoardes
of millions, and destroyed explorers with their cunning and special form of
attack.  They were so small that if one drew his sabre (not to be confused
with an S3 Sabre), he could easily cut an atom in half, causing a chain
reaction that destroyed anything larger than a Solarian Battle Cruiser.

        They sent messages to the world of barren realms, threatening to
either dominate or destroy the world.  The Communist Global Empire found
itself in great peril, and called on its allies, the Efil4seibmoz
Organization and the Duchy Of Atlantis.  The alliance was powerful, and the
Barons of the barren realms were ready to defend against that Solarian
Gooie Kablooie ops.  A fleet of zombies were sent into space in an attempt
to reason with the Solarians, or at least stall them while the realms
gathered their collective resources together in order to thwart the Solarian
onslaught.

        The world joined together to achieve greater things by tightening
the collectivist ideals that personify a successful dominion.  Coastal and
urban regions were alltogether abolished, and new industrial territories were
purchased from the bank of the world.  This actually resulted in a new flat
tax, and the consumer suffered, because the sad reality of barren realms was
that you could not sell land as you can on the planet Earth.  Despite this
ridiculous dissimilarity from the real world, the good people of the planet
were united not only physically, but also spiritually, through the new
achievements of society as a whole.  Working together raised the spirit and
nationalist pride in the race, and before long armies were being manufactured
at a reasonable rate.

        Tragedy came later that turn, when the masses learned that the
Zombies were unsuccessful and had been murdered savagely, but morale was
still high and production remained at 103%.  This continued until one of the
overpaid scientists leaked a story to the press about how a percentage can
not possibly be over 100% without being an abstract number as opposed to a
concrete one.  This reflected on the production level, and it slowly returned
to 100%.

        As the Solarians were preparing to strike, the land of many realms
struck first with an hundred thousand of troops, jets, and tanks.  The troops
and tanks had difficulty attacking the creatures because they were in space,
and most of the jets just crashed into each other because they all tried to
take off at the same time.  The world was left defenceless, waiting for the
Solarians to strike.

The End

P.S.  The Solarians burned up when they entered the atmosphere.

        It was like any day, any time of the year.  Farmers were toiling
extra hard in the soil to retrieve every last morsel to feed the capital,
which was home to over 14 billion!

        As the turn drew towards the end, farmers were finishing up their
last minutes of toil before the tax collectors drew in to purchase their food
wares.  A light rumbling gathered in the distance.  At first a few of the
farmers meandering in the square exclaimed that the collectors were coming
early, but everyone knew that to be a lie.  The collectors would come from
the East, not the West.

        As that thought drew to a close, the farmers scattered as thousands
of foot, jet, and tank soldiers stormed over the countryside headed to the
East.  Everything in their path became a fiery inferno as the army destroyed
all in it's path.  Man, Women, and child alike died in their wake, and then
from the East a new army came to meet the invaders head on.  The empires army
had come to staunch the flow of the attackers.  Casualties were many, but
eventually the invaders progress stopped and they turned back.  As small
victory had been won, but at a great cost.

	Many prisoners were taken in the assault, never to be seen again, and
the border shrank as many more regions had been taken.  Such was the life of
the Spacian peasant.  Often troubled, but never boring.  A pathetic existence
of serfdom and poverty admidst a war torn land.

        Many peasants on the border had been talking.  Plans of heading out
with one of the millions of travelers that head out each turn to the safer,
more prosperous plains in the Duchy of Atlantis became more and more the talk
as Spacians alike had their robber baron lord Proteus turn his back on them,
and leave them as picking to royal territories of the queen.

	Yes the Duchy of Atlantis was ruled by the handsome Prince of Whales.
The Marquis d'la Homme b, and from his hand spewed the stuff of dreams.
Money, security, prosperity.  All could be had by a man who wished to work
for it.  Pride came into play though, for these people were Spacians, and
Spacians never surrendered, even when they received repeated ass kickings
from everyone.  It was better to pick up the pieces and start over.

	Spacian dreams began back in 74 when the people at Solarus and the
Solarian empire suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of The Komradery, who
in turn were defeated.  The region remained unclaimed until Sasazander
claimed the land and Created Spacia with himself as lord of the SPaCiaNs.
Unfortunately for him he was not ambitious enough and a young upstart named
Proteus moved in and slew the baron and placed the bloody crown upon his
head.

	The young usurper began a reign of terror upon the realms and grew
rich and powerful from the conquests, and soon the Queendom began to speak of
a new terror upon its borders.

        Namor, not to be outdone by his enemy, sent his favorite son to the
surface world not more then a week ago to start his own realm and to battle
Proteus to death.  Granted a small duchy near the border of Spacia, the young
Prince gathered much wealth and soon amassed a large army.  Proteus at first
attempted to destroy the Prince early on, but he was not in store for the
young Atlanteans ferocity and savy battle command which destroyed Proteus'
ground forces and rendered him on the defense.

	Within a week over thirty billion peasants have found their way into
the duchy and Atlantean forces continue to pound on Spacian defenses. Rumours
circulate that Proteus true to his laziness has fled the realm in search of
easier opportunities and has once again succumbed to the forces of Atlantis.

Thank YOu.

        Mechanoids are a most vile and evil breed of pirates.  They are very
alike to the Humans, but they are comprised out of high sophisticated
equipment.  Their numbers are quite small, but not a single Mechanoid has
been captured or destroyed.  Any troopers a barony may capture on a Mechanoid
attack run are mearly citizens of their own barony, completely brainwashed
and under the control of the Mechanoids.  This process is easily reversed
after capture, however, and the citizens can continue their normal life,
completely unware of what has transpired.  The leader of the Mechanoids is
rumored to be of such power that it can actually run TWO games of Rap Blord
at the same in a "multi-tasking" enviroment.  The Mechanoids are easily the
most technologically advanced race, using weapons and equipment unlike
anything the Barren Realms have ever seen.  If a baron could make an alliance
with these pirates, the battle for Realms would be swayed greatly.
Unfortunetly, the goals of the Mechanoids cannot be grasped, as their attacks
have no rhyme or reason.  They have never issued a public statement or made
us aware of any of their plans.  They simply steal from baronies.  They have
been known to abduct citizens and perform bizarre experiments on them for
reasons unknown.  From the small amount of data that has been compiled on the
Mechanoids over the years, the baronies have been able to find out a little
about the Mechanoid themselves.  Forms of the Mechanoids seem to vary
greatly, dependant on purpose.  A Mechanoid "heart & soul", so to speak,
consists only of a tiny microchip.  This chip can be inserted into various
physical beings.  For instance, a Mechanoid surveillance only spy is no
bigger than a fly, and in fact looks much like a fly.  A Mechanoid sabotage
spy can transform and augment himself to a number of different forms.  The
typical Mechanoid soldier is a 9 foot beast of metal and weaponry.  Even
Mechanoid tanks are simply large robots, clad in armorment.  If the
Mechanoids do have a goal of taking over the Barren Realms, it will surely be
the most devestating and horrific war the Realms have ever seen.  Only time
will tell..
