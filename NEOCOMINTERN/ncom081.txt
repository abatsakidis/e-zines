        I don't even know what's going on with this one.  There is this
weird interview thing, and I think it is real but I am not sure.  When I
asked Junior Haagis if it was real or not he just kinda growled at me and
made me feel like my life was in danger.  It was kinda funny in a scary
way!  Well, enjoy!

Neo-Comintern: Sooo...you're Castro?

Castro: Jes. Fidel Castro.

NC: Get outta here! The guy?

Castro:  No really.

NC: You just look like him, right?

Castro: No. I am he.

NC: You just got his beard. Isn't that it?

Castro: Please. You call me here. For interview. Make wise with the time.
        I very busy man.

NC: Uhhhhh-huhhhhh...ah-hahhhhhhhh! Hm?

Castro: Excuse me?

NC: You are realy him. Aren't you?!

Castro: (sigh) Jes!

NC: Can you imagine? Me here with you? 'Castro'?

Castro: ........

NC: What d'you suppose my deceased father, dead and buried, might say to me
    today seeing me with Fidel Castro? Huh?!

Castro: I..suppose..I never knew the man...

NC: Hm?

Castro: 'Congratulations'?

Neo Comintern: He'd say,"ATTABOYYYYYY!!YEAH!!...ATTABOYYYYY!!". He's quite a
               character, in'it he?

Castro:...Uh, again..

NC: Hey!...Is that skin cancer?

Castro: What?!!

NC: (pointing) Right there. Skin cancer, right?

Castro: (looking)...That's Luis Arsalan! My advisor!

NC: So is he dangerous?

Castro: No!

NC: Malignant? 

Castro: Shuddup!!

NC: Hey!...Sss'happenin?!!

Castro: I thought you were a well respected socialist publication!

NC: Tell me,..Cubists or Cubans?

Castro: Who are you?!!

NC: 'Harper's Bizarre' once called you, "an Aries with bold conceptual
     outlooks". Comments?

Castro: I'll...kill you!!

NC: Bold outlooks indeed. Be honest..whilst maintaining a communist regime'
    on the verge of third world status in this day and age, can seemingly
    outdated neo-communist ideals combat today's economy?

Castro: Fucking KILL YOU!!!

NC: What do you see will become of Cuba in the next century...?

Castro: Il puta!!

NC: Reflections on your recent Papal visit...?

Castro: Il endio grande PUTA!!!

NC: Well that's 20. (Shit, I was just gettin' warmed up!)

        After Komrade B had been sodomized, he found his way back to the ship
where I was waiting with a beautiful harlot.  I was just ending my
appointment with her when Komrade B trundled his way into our vehicle and
friend.  Things were once again calm after I had slain the foul Jingis Khan.
As we entered the water, Komrade B spoke to me, bewildered, "What exactly
are we doing here?"

        Thinking that he was talking about something at least mildly
intelligent, I replied, "Komrade, through ignorance, myth, and finally
science, no man has ever known if there was a purpose for humanity."

        Komrade B looked befuddled.  He obviously had no idea what I was
talking about as he stared off into space as a member of an audience, enticed
by a hypnotist's spell.  I slapped him across the face twice, one forward
and one backward, and then he looked at me and seemed to register thought as
though he were nearly intelligible.  From what I understood, he was trying to
tell me that our adventures to this point had not completely made sense.

        "How come we aren't achieving the goals set out to do, but we
continue to advance through our plot of adventuring?"

        Komrade B began to laugh stupidly, so I beat him and told him that
he was forbidden to speak through the rest of our journies, or that I would
murder him.

        That night I slept soundly, and the next day we were again toward
Atlantis to bring them news of our success.
