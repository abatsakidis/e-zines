  I'm told that this issue of the N-Com is "special."  Of course, that
  promise has been made many times before in the history of this e-zine, but
  Cog would have us believe that this "special" issue is "specialler" than
  all others that came before.  I'm wondering right now whether or not to
  believe him.  Frankly, I'm getting downright sick of promises that never
  are delivered.  For instance, tonight I happened to turn on some version
  of Law & Order for a few minutes and I was treated to an advertisement for
  the 11 o'clock evening news.  The ad said that the news would reveal "why
  these wild ponies had to be driven from their island home."  Wild ponies!
  Island home!  I was hooked, needless to say.  I love ponies, and, while I
  don't necessarily love islands in their abstract form, the notion of this
  particular island of wild ponies intrigued me.  It reminded me of a
  cartoon I used to watch when I was babysitting a little boy named
  Mitchell.  The cartoon was called "Puff the Magic Dragon."  That dragon
  had a home on an island named Honalee (sp?).  He left the island to help a
  little boy who couldn't speak, but, when he returned, he found that his
  home had been destroyed by miserable creatures with perpetual colds.
  Aside from the fact that chicken soup will instantaneously cure any cold,
  I learned that some islands are home to wonderful creatures (like Puff)
  and are fun to learn about on TV.  So, even though I didn't want to hear
  about soldiers returning home from the battlefields in foreign countries
  where they slaughtered hundreds of innocent civilians, I endured the
  entire half hour of news, impatiently awaiting the time when I would learn
  about these poor ponies who were losing their paradisiacal free horsy
  home.  To my utter outrage, THEY WERE NOT EVEN MENTIONED ONCE!  Not even
  in passing.  Not even to say they had run out of time to tell me about
  them.  Not even to say it had all been a hoax meant to hoodwink me into
  watching the news where I had to see people bowing to the pope and kissing
  him and going crazy!  NO!  Terrible, terrible, terrible.  My ponies were
  nowhere to be seen or heard and I will never know what became of them.

  So, let this be a lesson for you.  Before you read this issue, understand
  what you'll be getting yourself into.  It isn't necessarily "special."  It
  won't necessarily change your life.  It won't solve the mystery of the
  immigrating ponies.  What it will do is fill you with anxiety, dread, and
  self-loathing.  But, come to think of it, maybe it's worth reading for
  those reasons alone.

  To Whom It May Concern:  (aka cog)


  I am writing in regards to the call for submissions for the 'special
  issue' due out next week.  I can't say I'm particularly happy with the
  insinuation that the articles I have written up until this time have not
  been special.  I discussed this over the phone with bmc and hearing how
  upset I was, he urged me to write a letter of complaint listing what my
  concerns were.  He said he would not want to lose my articles over this.
  I have been a staff writer since January 2002 and have written articles
  for many theme issues including the famous 187, and 200.  bmc has
  solicited me personally to write articles for him and he has always
  regarded them as special.  In fact, just the other day, he said to me,
  'ada, I don't really know what I would do without your contributions to
  the neo-comintern...your articles are really special.'  I find it very
  ironic that bmc would say that to me, and suddenly cog has decided to
  produce a 'special' issue.

  But then I got to thinking....did bmc just say this to me so that I would
  write a letter of complaint to cog?  Was he just secretly egging me on so
  that cog would lose power?  Was this just some brilliant scheme to kick
  cog out and get bmc back in the driver's seat?  Was I just a meaningless
  pawn in the midst of a dangerous game, a double crossing conspiracy?

  sniff.....

  I'm hurt guys, real hurt......


  un-sincerely,

  My father owned a briefcase
  One day we cracked it open
  Filled with soap and porn it was
  We laughed until we woke him.
  Into the room the door he snapped
  With a voice so ripped it choked him
  Our dirty hands he washed he washed
  Our dirty fingers broken.
