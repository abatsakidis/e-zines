                               EDITOR'S NOTE
        
Have you ever noticed that there are both good things and bad things?  I came
to this realization the other day and it blew my mine.  Then I realized that
I wasn't sure if good and bad things really were.

I am ashamed to admit that what I think and what I know are two different
things, and I am also ashamed of my shame.

Sometimes my thoughts are like a fast horizontal fall through a 2D tunnel
with trimentional lines flying by.

I am writing this text because the world-at-large requested that something
be written about the recent phenomenon known by its fans as "MONSTER PORN,"
something that nearly defies explanation.  MONSTER PORN can be roughly
described as a spectacle... a horrendous spectacle.  Sickening, twisted,
gory and appealing, all in one.  I am talking about pictures that explicitly
show acts of intercourse between werewolves, skeletons, Frankensteins, and
non-sequitor red-faced (and undoubtedly evil) creatures.

Many of you are familiar with these creatures, and perhaps your children
have even been exposed to these frightfully sexual creatures of the night.
I have seen images of a werewolf fellating a green Frankenstein-like
monster, a devil-beast receiving one of a skeleton's more choice bones, and
that same skeleton bobbling upon AN ACTUAL LIVING HUMAN BEING!  With only
images to go on, I concocted a story that I believe exposes the real
situation in the MONSTER PORN industry.

First a skeleton and red devil fall in love and they decide that they want
to collect images of their first encounter together.  Believing that it
would be uncomfortable to have a stranger along with them, they ask their
mutual friend, a werewolf, if she will take pictures for them.  Of course
the werewolf says yes.  Bonds of friendship run deep between the undead and
the magically evil, so the response has been presupposed.  The werewolf is
told to free her schedule for tonight because the plan is to meet at the old
abandoned haunted castle and create some of the most wonderful and ghastly
frames ever recorded.

The werewolf loads up with film and the red devil and the skeleton begin to
fall in love with each other in front of the camera's eye.  The skeleton
fondles the breast of the red devil as he embraces her from behind.
Suddenly - and without warning - a Frankenstein-monster-type rises from a
wicker basket and demands that the werewolf give him oral sex.  The werewolf
appeases him and the Frankenstein groans and raises his arms in a zombie-
like trance to show his approval.

At this point there are two separate love-scenes going on, and neither
interlaces with the other in any way.  I am not certain if the acts are
happening concurrently or consecutively, but a mysterious frame appears, and
in this frame the skeleton is performing oral sex on a male figure.  The
only other male in the castle is the newly-awakened Frankenstein and at this
point things become very confusing.  There is no mention of homosexual
tendencies in Mary Shelley's account of the great green daemon, lover and
statesman, so something has gone wrong, either with the sequence or with my
account of the story thus far.

NOTE: because of the sexual ambiguity of the skeleton, I theorize that it is
possible that a second skeleton, who acted as liaison between the
skeleton/red devil couple and the werewolf photographer might also be
present at the photo shoot and presenting Frankenstein with pleasure.  This
is unverified, however, because there is no proof - that is, the two
skeletons are never seen together in the same picture.

At this point Frankenstein is no longer seen in the series.  This seems to
support the theory that he has been seduced by the male skeleton and is
attempting to deal with this development in his sexuality.  It is also
possible that he has just gone back to sleep in the wicker coffin or perhaps
he is operating the camera.  In the upcoming pictures we see the red devil,
the werewolf, and the skeleton intertwining.  The phone begins to ring and
this disturbs the monsters so the werewolf gets up and answers the phone in
her own vile, pornographic way.  The series photographer follows her into
the waiting room and we come to the understanding that she is enjoying the
call very much.  Maybe the person on the other end of the line is telling
her that there is a full moon to-night.

NOTE:  I have theorized that a sixth party may also be present at the photo
shoot.  This sixth person is a vampire who is present in many of the photos,
but unseen.  The photographer was unaware that these creatures are unable to
be photographed, and the pictures including the vampire didn't turn out
quite the way they were supposed to.  The basis for this theory is that we
see several pictures of the werewolf posing nude by herself, and since all
of the other pictures in the series are action shots it seems unlikely that
the photographer would intentionally take these oddball pictures.  I believe
that there is something much more disturbing going on in these pictures, but
we are (luckily?) unable to see it.  On the other hand this remains
theoretical because there is no visual proof that the vampire was ever
actually there.

NOTE:  in all of these observations it is presupposed that at any given time
the camera is being operated by one of the members of the monster group.
This is supported by the fact that there is no group photo and no four
(five?  six?) monsters are ever seen at the same time.  It is possible,
however, that there is a SEVENTH monster who chooses to never step in front
of the camera.  Though it is ridiculous to speculate on this, I believe it
could be a ghost, a dragon, or a dodecahedron.

The cameramonster returns to the various corners of the castle where all of
the monsters seem to have finished up and they lay exhausted in a pile of
fur and horns.  A glorious end to a gory spectacle, and they're done in time
to flee for shelter before dawn breaks.  Who would have known that being a
monster could be such an erotic experience?  The educated viewer, perhaps...
and this handful of very lucky hideous monsters.

When I sent copies to my friend Margarina, she said, "Hey those aren't
monsters, they're just people with masks on."  Shocked and frightened by
this, I frantically sought the truth.  I needed to know what MONSTER PORN is
all about, what makes it tick, what makes it so popular and why the monsters
do it.  Then I read the first part of this article and my beliefs were
reconfirmed.  Praise Odin for the ability to believe everything I read!  I
still had to know though... why would they do it?  Why do the monsters take
these pictures and send them around the world, and why is MONSTER PORN
becoming so fabulously popular?
 
Then I realized the answer to all of it was quite simple.  The monsters are
in love!  The monsters, who we labeled as being evil and yes, perhaps even
unable to love, have proven us wrong.  They have challenged our notions of
what true love really is and shown us that beauty can exist in many more
forms than we are conditioned to recognize.  Love is for everybody, even
monsters.  We realize that when we decided that because human pornography
can never be beautiful, pornography involving monsters must, by nature, be
even more obscene... we made a terrible mistake.

The monsters have forgiven us, but can we ever forgive... ourselves?

That is the rollercoaster we all go on as we experience MONSTER PORN for our
first time, and this reporter hopes that the ride will never end.  If these
monsters dare to continue to be so loving and to share their love with us,
we are luckier for it.

MONSTER PORN is a fast-growing trend and I believe that a great deal of the
genre's popularity is due to the powerful political statement it makes.  No
other form of pornography has the courage to deliver such hard-hitting
social commentary.  I dare any critic to defy this calculation.  In fact,
I'll stake my... everything on it!  The link is there.  The people want
MONSTER PORN.  The people want change.

Don't believe me?  In September 1999, MONSTER PORN was at 30% and in
September 2000 it was up to 70%!  That's a forty per cent increase!  Figures
like that don't lie.

I believe that summarizes the phenomenon of MONSTER PORN and provides you
with enough information to decide for yourself whether to peruse this form
of art or not.  If you would like to recieve pictures of monsters having
sex with each other, ICQ me at 29981964 or E me at thebmc@home.com.  Peace!

tell you that all you have to do is stop and examine where exactly he or she 
has decided to shove metal into her skin.

"But Scrilla," I can hear you saying, "That can't possibly be all that there 
is to it!"

Oh but it is.  And it's all right here.


[Note: Scrilla Tee takes no responsibility for the accuracy of the following 
statements]

Ear Rings:  "I love to accessorize, don’t you?  I think it’s, like, totally 
worth it to endure a little pain just to make my ear lobes pretty!  Y’know?"

Lots of Ear Rings:  "Ha!  I am a very frightening person!!!  My multiple ear 
piercings frighten you, yes?  Run away all you old people!  Fear me!"

Eyebrow Ring:  "Not only am I frightening you, but I am cutting edge as 
well.  I am Generation X."

And there you have it.  I have to go now, a mob of coffee shop twerps are 
about to kick my ass.
