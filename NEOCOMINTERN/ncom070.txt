        Another platinum hit.  I like writing the stories of Atlantis.  They
are definitely my favorite to do, and I think they keep getting better.
Well, maybe they get worse.  But either way, this one should still be OK and
well worth the cover price.  Enjoy.

        P.S. I have just been told by our judges that they are, in fact,
             getting worse.

        P.P.S. I have also been informed that we are in a slum.

        A few years after the end of the first bloody battle between the
heros of Atlantis and the devils of Cavercus things were slow and Poseidon
finally had the opportunity to live a happy life as benevolent king rather
than playing the role of general.  During this new time of peace, Poseidon
decided to wed the fair Carlene.  The bastard Namor had already passed the
phase of tadpole and had grown legs with which he could swim and battle, and
the era had come when he would be bastard no longer.

        Poseidon looked into the unnaturally green eyes of Carlene and fell
in love once again.  From the day he first impregnated her she had seemed to
age not one single day.  On the day before her 18th birthday, Poseidon swept
her up onto the dry lands of Lemuria and gave three Weegie bulls as a sin
offering to a group of swamp hags in exchange for the eternal youth of the
sea nymph Carlene.  After that day she never aged past seventeen years,
and she maintained that young age all throughout her years, even as she grew
old and died.

        Soon after leaving the hags of Lemuria, Carlene went into labour.  A 
boy was delivered, and he was born with his eyes open.  The wetnurse
exclaimed the unualness of such an occurence.  Carlene replied, "My child is
no ordinary being.  He is to be a man and leader of an empire.  I shall call
him Namor."  The population had mixed feelings for this birth.  It was their
king's son, but he had not acknowledged the child, nor had he married the
maiden that bore the child.  Poseidon was engrossed in a war with the evil
minions of Ry'leh, and the resurgence of the daring braggart, Proteus.
            
        Proteus and his allies in Ry'leh were eventually vanquished, and the
twin empires of Ry'Leh and Cavercus had been completely reduced to ruins.
The citizens of the city-states continued to live, toil, and prosper as if
they were completely unaware that their surroundings had been so completely
and utterly destroyed.  The only person who noticed was Proteus, and he was
filled with hate and anger toward his true foe, Poseidon.  Proteus began to
dream of his next plot to destroy the mighty sea king once and for all.

        At this same time, Poseidon was gazing into the Carlene's eyes, and
the nymph stared back, anticipating his next words.  "Wilst thou marry me,
my lovely.... queen?"  Carlene stared at him blankly for several minutes,
and Poseidon repeated the words again.  Again Carlene did not respond, and
the king realized that she had fallen asleep.   He awoke her with a powerful
backhand, and when he asked the words again she was reduced to tears, and
any Atlantean historean is aware of what her answer was.

        The next day preparations for the wedding had begun.  Carlene and her
handmermaids were preparing invitations. They killed millions of clams and
shellfish to use their shells to prepare the invitations.  When the
invitations were complete, they were tossed into the currents and carried to
the furthest reaches of the empire.

        Meanwhile, Posedon was sitting on the iron throne of Cronos gazing
into nothing, his thoughts trained on things only he could know about.  The
advisors were becoming angered by his decadence, and began to question his
ability to rule.  The king was a great warrior, the finest the nation had
ever known, but the advisors had strong doubts about his ability as a builder
and bureaucrat.

        Proteus, the covert operator that he was, heard of the peoples'
disatification  with their king, so he began to hatch a plan.  He visited the
sages of Thera in the city of Agrapuristan, and asked for something that
would help him dispose of the Atlantean king.  The sages (no friends of
Atlantis) had a strong desire to have influence below the dark waters, and
decided to help Proteus.

        For ten thousand gold and 13 years of life, Proteus obtained a
powerful potion that was sure to destroy the king of Atlantis.  With potion
in hand, Proteus cackled with delight and headed to the capital with his
invitation in his other hand.

        The wedding began in the early afternoon that day.  The congregation
gathered, and the crowd was filled with admiring subjects.  There were
hundreds of races of sea creatures present, from the well dressed Sea Weegies
to the weeping masses of starfish and lobstars.  On the upper echelon sat
Poseidon's high council of advisors, which consisted mainly of blue whales
and crayfish.  There were also some jellyfish and manta rays, but they were
of minority and Poseidon rarely considered their ideas.  The advisors
discussed Poseidon's failure to provide positive leadership in times of
peace, and they made mentions of revolting against the great king and
implementing a new system which they referred to as "communism".  The time,
they decided, was to be at the wedding reception.

        Suddenly the sirenes started singing the grand imperial wedding
march, and a hush fell over the crown.  The red carpets were unrolled, and
the groom's party came out of the back room.  Poseidon was the first to
travel down the path that led to the sea-altar, riding his royal weegie which
was cloaked in the royal red cape.  This weegie was a special hybrid and
sported both feelers on which it walked and arms with which it could utilize
tools but not arm itself with weapons.  It was a master sculptor but it's
main purpose was to carry the king to the alter and then have its throat slit
to commence the wedding ritual.  Poseidon was adorned in his golden circlet
engraved with icons depicting the seven contests of the maiden Carlene.
He was also wearing his royal cape, under which he was completely naked
except for the traditional penis circlet and cape.  After the moment of awe
passed, the crowd looked at the party of Poseidon and was amazed to see who
was in the place of best man.

        It was Proteus.

        Everyone at first was shocked to see Proteus strutting down the aisle
towards the king.  Proteus wore the ancient garment of best men, by wearing
nothing but a soiled loin cloth and a silver sword.  His circlet was adorned
with the battles between Atlantis and many of his love making exploits.
Though some did not understand this seemingly unlikely choice in a best man,
Poseidon and Proteus paused and reflected on things past.  Poseidon reflected
on the years of youth when they played together in the waterfalls and gysers
of the sea.  Everything was beautiful, but one day they split paths.  It was
a lazy summer evening, and as they rode weegie bulls into the late hours of
the day, Proteus suggested that the two of them become horribly evil.
Poseidon rejected the proposal and eventually went on to replace Cronos as
king of the sea.

        Poseidon looked at Proteus and wondered what his childhood friend
was thinking about.  Proteus smiled as he fingered the vile of elixir which
he hid under his loincloth and contemplated the mayhem which would ensue
when he utilized this mysterious potion later that evening.  The king clasped
the young Proteus tightly and kissed him.  Then the future queen came down
the aisle.

        Nobody paid much attention to Carlene as she came down the isle,
because Proteus and Poseidon were at their boyhood games.  Carlene wore a
gown of slimy sea shells and algae.  This outfit was considered by the upper
caste to be the pinacle in fashion.  It really showed off the maiden's
youthfulness and innocence.

        The wedding went as any royal wedding would. The vows were spoken and
the couple embraced. Proteus spent most of his time hitting on the bride and
her maidens.  When the vows were said, Poseidon, angered by Proteus' attempts
on his wife, did something brash.  He made out with his bride in a sully like
manner.  Posiedon then removed his gold circlet and made love to his bride in
front of Proteus and the nation.  He mocked Proteus indicating that he
probably had a full erection and no maiden to satisfy his lust.  Proteus
proved that he did indeed have an erection, and that, yes, he intended
to do something about it.  Just as he lifted the soiled loin cloth a large
electric eel coiled itself around his balls and released an intense shock
of electricity that made Proteus hop.  As the eel released every last volt in
its frail body, Proteus writhed in pain on the sea floor, and Poseidon pulled
out of his bride and ejaculated on the face of the incapacitated Proteus.

        There was an hour before the reception and the people went their
seperate ways.  The denizens of the sea went home and went about their
regular business of tilling the field and producing armour for the Atlantean
knights.  Poseidon and Carlene went to the royal castle where he would be
introduced to Namor, his young son.  The nobles went into a secret meeting
where they created plans to overthrow the imperial king later that night,
and Proteus slinked off into the dark recesses of the Hall of Dionysus
where the reception would be held later that evening.  His plans were evil,
and he could have been heard laughing as he walked toward the punch bowl and
uncapped the foul potion which he had acquired from the sages of Thera.

        As Proteus was tainting the beverages that would be served that
night, Poseidon was being introduced to his son who was bastard-no-more.
These are the events that transpired.

        Posiedon looked into the eyes of his son, and realized for the first
time the legitimacy of the child. He declared "Today you are my son!" He then
kissed his son full on the mouth in the Atlantean tradition.

        Later, the party began and the people started filing in.  Proteus
watched from a secret hiding spot as the noblemen filed in and began
discussing the royal wedding and how beautiful the spectacle was.  There
was not much else that occured at these parties, which were very dry and
boring and usually ended at around nine o'clock when most of the people were
beginning to get headaches and some of the more tempermental men began to
beat each other unconscious.  This would be another of those parties, only
this one would end with the appointment of a new high council.  Poseidon and
Carlene entered the room and the crowd began to applaud.

        Speeches were made and terrible jokes were told, and the night began
to grow extremely boring.  The main ceremony was over, and it was time for
the few hours of socializing and mingling that would lead into the brutal
betrayal and murder that excited the hearts of the advisors.

        Proteus ran and hid behind another curtain and watched as the guests
began to drink the potion.  Unfortunately, his throat became parched and he
left his hiding spot and drank several glasses of punch until his thirst
left.  It was at this point that he realized his error.  The room began
spinning and the peoples faces began to blur.  "Oh well at least the wretched
people of Atlantis shall suffer as well!"  Little did Proteus realize that
all he introduced to the people was the art of gettin down.  Everyone became
intoxicated from the potion later called alcohol.  The people that were
planning to kill the king soon began to have way too much fun and thoughts of
murder left their minds. Proteus began to vomit later, and spent most of the
night on the floor, except for when he got up to find a smoke and
administered oral sex to the weegie knight.  He could not light the cigarette
though, because he was under water, and fire under water is impossible.

        The Baron Holmes decided to follow the usual and began attacking
people, but instead of the usual using of fists he began kicking people and
it was a delight to all involved.

        The Weegie Knight kicked Proteus's inert body into the air and it
slowly floated down onto some sea elephants that were fucking. Proteus got
caught between them and awoke horrified.

        Samuel Dae Lewis, The empires jokester, played a practical joke on
the drunken unexpecting best man Proteus.  He took a flaming stick and lit
Proteus' coattails on fire.  Proteus did not realize the flames were there
until the singed his bum and gave him third degree burns, much to everyone's
delight.

        Even the queen Carlene became intoxicated by the end of the night,
and she went around kissing some of the attractive bachelors of the party.
Poseidon became angry and cut off every body part that Carlene would kiss.
Some men lost their heads and some merely had their lips and tongues cut
off.  Proteus became jealous of all the atention that Carlene was recieveing,
so he began kissing the men of the empire too, and when he kissed the
infamous Weegie Knight, the beast struck him repeatedly on the head until he
was once again unconscious.  Then he woke up to see that Carlene was
administering oral sex upon a blurry figure.  Proteus attepmted to regain
Poseidon's favour by lunging at the figure to cut off his man-root, but as
he realized that the man was in fact Poseidon he faltered, and slipped on the
semen of the sea elephant and slid into a deep crevice of the sea where
the water pressure was so great that he once again found himself slipping
into unconsciousness.

         Later the next day Proteus awoke on the plankton fields south of
Atlantis with a bundle under his arm.  Figuring it was nothing but things he
stole from the palace he headed home.  When the bundle began squirming he was
confused and opened it.  Inside was a young confused three year-old boy named
Namor.  Proteus gave a sly grin and an evil plot grew inside his brain.  For
over a week he trained the boy in the art of attack.  Proteus was sure the
boy would be able to beat his father in battle and take the throne, and then
he could rule through the boy.  The boy, at the end of the week, was calling
his trainer Uncie Proteus and he became skilled at the art of the swimming
head butt.  Proteus deemed him to be ready.

        Taking the boy back to the palace he walked into the throne room much
to the dismay of the king. "I have your son, King Poseidon!"  With that he
unleashed Namor on his father.  The child gained speed as he prepared for
the dangerous head butt.  He gained confidence as he drew nearer.  He knew
the head butt would be dangerous because he rammed Proteus from behind a
couple days ago and nearly crippled him.  As he drew within ten feet he
screamed the phrase "Imperious Rex," his very first words.  Alas, his little
legs could not build the needed momentum and the king easily stepped aside
and placed his son in a head lock until he passed out, and then sent him to
his room with no supper.

        Then Poseidon stared into the eyes of his best man until Proteus
began to cry uncontrollably.  "Y-Y-You destroyed my emipre," said Proteus.
Poseidon, being the powerful and loving king that he is forgave Proteus and
gave him a handful of sea-flowers.  Proteus accepted, and when he smelled
them he began to go into shock because he was extremely allergic to them.
Poseidon smiled.  Carlene smiled.  The couple was inseperable, and their
love blosommed and strengthened as they watched Proteus suffer in pain on the
courtroom floor.  A few days later the couple became bored with watching
Poseidon's childhood blood brother in his incapacitated state, so they asked
the Weegie Knight to remove him from the kingdom.  The task should have
taken a matter of hours, but the knight didn't return for days.  Poseidon
tried to question him about what took him so long and why his armour was
covered with foreign fluids, but the knight was all about smiles, and uttered
not a word.

        The End.
