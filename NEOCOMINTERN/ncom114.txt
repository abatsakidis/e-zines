Captain's Log
Stardate: 187.4

The year is Two-Thousand, the situation impossible.  I look around myself
and I am met with danger at every angle.  To the South there is death, to
the East alcoholism, the West holds sodomy and lechery, and to the North...
to the North there is safety, but that is the easy way out, isn't it?

I am stranded here in a place light hours away from Comintern Headquarters,
and I must fight the monster myself because my crew has gone missing.  They
mentioned something about being busy with other stuff, but I would use the
word "disappearance" for the full feel of where they have, for lack of a
better word, disappeared to.  What has become of them?  Has the monster
gotten them?

THE MONSTER: I know nothing of these creatures but that they seem to hunt
alone and trap their prey with false promises.  The monster tends to lure and
psychologically paralyze, then feed off of the power produced by the victim's
body until they reach the age of 65 and are boxed and filed away.  This beast
is called... Capitalism!

Has this monster destroyed my crew?  I don't think we will find out in this
Installment, but I will not rest until I face that monster and make it
accountable for its actions.

Captain's Log
Stardate: Armageddon

This Eden-like planet is very much like Earth, but it is more polluted and
all of the human beings have been replaced by drones and monsters.  Will I
find my crew here, or will I only find death?  My body and mind are weak.  I
have been seeking for months and so far I have found no answers.  End
recording.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suddenly a guy in a white ape costume and a horn on the top of his head
jumped out from behind a rock and I recognized him as a Capitalism monster.
I quickly looked around for a hand phaser or a good solid club, but I found
neither.  Well actually I did see a good solid club but it was in the hand
of the Capitalism monster and he was coming after me with it.

I waited until he was within double-axe-handle-smash-to-the-shoulder range
and then I gave him a quick and unexpected double axe handle to the shoulder.
I expected the monster to fall into unconsciousness as they usually do but
something was wrong this time.  Could the Capitalism monster possibly be an
evil robot?  If so, that would show me for ever trusting technology!

As I was daydreaming about robots and shit, the monster kicked the gun out
of my hand (yes this is an intentional continuity error) and then kicked me
in the face.  I pretended to be wounded, and as the monster crouched down to
help me I threw some sand in its face and got up and kicked it between the
legs repeatedly until it fell down.  Then I did a move that looked like a
high jump leap, and somehow this hurt the monster too.

I was tired from battle so I stopped to breathe for a second.  Then I saw the
monster stand up, looking full of energy.  Well I guess I didn't have much
of a chance at this point unless I would have been able to wrestle the good
solid club out of the grasp of the Capitalism monster.  No such luck.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Epilogue: The monster beat me up and made me become a Capitalist.  Then it
made me write this final article detailing my disgrace and turn the
Neo-Comintern over to him (yes I found out the hard way that it is male).
From this point forward I'm not sure what he will do so just make sure to
listen to him because I have been wrong and Capitalism is reall

        (Monster's note: this is supposed to symbolize dripping blood
because I have destroyed the BMC's way of life by showing him the advantages
of Capitalism)
