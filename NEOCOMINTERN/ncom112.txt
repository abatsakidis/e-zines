                               EDITOR'S NOTE

        I believe that last year we kicked the summer off with a tribute to
Bones.  This summer we've been a bit lazy, so instead of writing an article
based on an entire person, I have written one to a single letter instead.
Note that when I say single letter I intend to apply that this letter is
available and ready for the taking, but back off cause I saw her first!  I
love you, B.

        *cough* well anyway, Wayne has given us the gift of another James 2D
sequel.  I would just like to note that these seem to be getting more and
more bizarre as Wayne plummets into the depths of insanity.  Yes, I fear for
his life, but what can I do?  Take him to the hospital?  Sorry, I don't have
a car.  Anyway, I heard they were closing all of the hospitals in some sort
of plan that the governments are refering to as "Alabama-North."  I have no
idea what that means, and I'm pretty sure it is meant to inspire feelings of
prejudice, but I don't think they would do something bad like that!

        Anyway, Wayne's screaming something to himself in the other world, so
I should go over there and let him out.  Peace!

 `q                                  by BMC                                p'

        Now everybody knows I've loved B for a long time, and this is my
special tribute article to her, erh, I mean it.

        The letter B is number two in the alphabet, but number one in my
heart.  B, also known as Beta, is an extremely multipurposed letter, and one
of the only that is able to stand on its own in many situations.  Examples:

        -Beta VCRs use smaller tapes and are of higher quality than VHS ones.
        -Vitamin B is really good for you, and you would probably get sick
         if you never had any.
        -B is the symbol for Boron.  Boron is cool, even though it only took
         the #14 spot on my top 15 atoms list.
        -B is a great musical note, appropriate for nearly any song.
        -B is a type of blood, and it is even more delicious than O.
        -Bees fly around and make honey, and that tastes really good!
        -Spelling Bees kick ass, especially when lots of the words have the
         letter B in them.

        B is the only voiced bilabial explosive.  This makes it every
linguist's cream dream, and even if you aren't into morphology or semantics
it should still please you enough to make you mildly aroused if not
combusting violently with orgasm.

        B is the allstar of the world of letters, towering over the other 25
and subjecting them to its cruel but benevolent whims.  One of B's most
important purposes is to stand at the beginning of words and give them that
beautiful and punchy beginning.  Examples:

        -Box
        -Blood
        -Boss
        -Bang
        -Boo!

        I promise you that none of those are made up.  They are all authentic
words that just sound wonderful.  B also begins the names of some of those
people you love the most (eg. BMC).  But B can also be used effectively in
the middle of words.  Don't believe me?  Examples:

        -double
        -abacus
        -establish

        Even better, there are some words that feature two Bs in a row!

        -nibble
        -pebble

        What raw power from the greatest letter in existence.  Last but most
importantly, B can be used as a way to end a word with a spark of life.
When B is placed on the far right of a word, the result is a grand finale
of both primal force and magnanamous honour.  Examples:

        -drab
        -slab
        -flab
        -pab

        And I'm sure you've noticed that those are all lower case Bs, which
brings me to my next point.  The letter B looks great, doesn't it?  First
there is that lower case b, which seems to me to bear more resemblence to a
human being than any other letter in the English language.  It's cute, it's
innocent, it makes me happy and proud to be alive.

        Out of all of the letters of the alphabet, there is no other one
whose capital version looks like a grown-up version of the lower case.  Look
at this, all of a sudden that cute b has matured in front of our eyes, and
now there is the blossomed B.  There is no doubt that we are looking at the
sexiest letter ever carved into stone.  Look at it, it is gorgeous.  B
excites and arouses me for many reasons.  In fact, I am proud to declare that
I throb every time I see one.

        From a certain angle B looks like a woman's voluptuous breasts, and
this turns me on to no end.  I mean, every time I see a naked woman it
reminds me of the letter B and I am in paradise.  When I make love to a
human being, you know it is the letter B that I'm dreaming of.  But I am
true to you, B, I am true in my own way.  I love you, B.  Never forget me.

 ;P                                JAMES 2G                                .b

   `nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn'

        James 2G (related closely to James 2D), in fact, so close that
they were the same person but in different dimensions. James 2G was a playa
at heart, but a lover at brain. He sold rock to Johnny Coke, whom would
easily take the fall for any bust. yeah, yeah.

       Jame4s 2G funked it up with tha old schopol posse. Meaning, he hung
wity Tha Biggity boggioty Bo$$ Mc and Tha riggity boiggity DeeJa Gnalry Wayn
After laying down 17 tracks, Jamnes 2FG decided to visitin is brother James
2D. They were on bad speaking terms since the great catacltysm of 0 AD, but
since then James 2G forgave tghhe itrrehensible actions of his brotyher. he
broguht a gift of 200 myrrhs which instanly coused James 2D to soil his
pantz.

       friebnz once again, they concoted plans to rule to known dimesnion,.z.
James 2D pointed out theat he ruled the SECOND dimension and James rukles the
GEE dimesnoipns. That left one dimensions left, I think. I don;t jknow. I
don't do well wioth all these dimesn isons, cause I have 0 imaginatiuons.

       BUT~! I suppiose IO could  ake uop a few made up ones. How about the
demo sions of parrelelel muthafuckas and tge dimensions of frankfurters~!
I wished I lived uin the frankfurter dimensions. Jeah. That was the next
traget of the James. frankfurters are loved by everyone, includeing me,.
ESPECIALLTY ME!
