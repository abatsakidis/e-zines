                          A TO THE MOTHERFUCKIN K
                                  By BMC

        I was digging through my old school rap tapes the other day, and I
came across a jewel callled "Squeeze The Trigger" by Ice-T.  This song was
among the first "Gangsta Rap" songs, and it teaches an important lesson.
It defends gangsta rap in ways that are still relevant to today's gangsta
rap.  More importantly, Ice-T not only says Fuck Tha Police in this song.
In 1987, The Ice had more to say.  He speaks out on a wide variety of
government issues, making a solid case for himself and in the defence of the
crime rhyme.

        Halfway through the song, a mock news report takes the critisms of
rap music to another level:

        "Violence erupts at a Los Angeles hip hop concert; rap music blamed
fro violence.  Violence erupts at a New York hockey game; hockey blamed for
violence.  Violence breaks out at a European soccer game; soccer blamed for
violence.  Violence breaks out at a nuclear peace rally; peace blamed for
violence.

        The point is that the government will find a scapegoat for any
failure by pointing the finger at little groups whose ideals are never
explained to the masses.

        Back to the giddy as the song starts:

        "yo evil what's up man? They be buggin, they wpn't play our records
on the radio, man, say we violent man, they need to look at the news, you
know what I'm sayin?  'smight need to kill that noise!  Man what you doin
with that up under your shirt?  Ahh man, it's time we put some head out,
word!  Let's get busy E, come on homeboy, squeeze the trigger."

        Ice-T speaks powerfully, though through broken english.  He unleashes
his almost brutally raw emotions upon anyone who has ventured into the world
of the rhyme syndicate.  This quote sounds like an Emcee and a DJ going out
to perpetrate a random act of violence, but as you hear the lyrics, Ice-T
smoothly changes your mind and directs your mind toward the real injustice.
Intelligent Ice shows the meaning of Antidisestablishmentarianism and
Communist ideology through lyrics which touch and dwell on many topics, such
as these:

It all starts off as a braggadocious act of senseless violence:

        "Rampage on stage. My crew's in a rage.  Found the uzi but missed
the 12 gauge"

Suddenly the previously mentioned weapons are exposed as metaphors:

        "My mind's a riot gun, there ain't none bigger.  'Bout to unload
the ammo- E squeeze the trigger"

        "They say I'm violent, they should watch their TV"

        Ice-T defends his art with the valid point that his music is a
reflection of the social situation, not vice-versa, as many critics and
christians have tried to argue.  At this point, the listener understands
"life in LA ain't no cup of tea", and perhaps pointing the finger at rap
was just a red herring to throw off the zealots who need to protest
something.  The question is, who were the people who dove into the face
of gangsta rappers?

        "Has it ever occured to you the president may be the one who wants
you dead?

        Was the government trying to save the ears of children from
profanity, or were they trying to clean up this raw news before we white
middle class folks became aware of the gang and drug epidemics that the
government fuel, not fight?  Why does the government promote hard times
in ghettos?  Why do they try to crush the black proletariat's right to
express an SOS to the masses?  If the masses heard this music, there might
be cause to protest and demand equality for all.  The government of the USA
has been found guilty of unlawful inprisonment through poverty, censorship
of art, and is now trying to cut off the message, the scream for help.
The message from one prole to the world, from Ice-T to you.

        "Paid my dues to the streets, took my hard knocks, disrespected
by snobs"

        "Like a panther I prowl, like a lion I growl, learn to see behind my
back like the head of an owl"

        "cops hate kids, kids hate cops, cops kill kids with warning shots.
what is crime and what is not? what is justice? I think I forgot!"

        "No matter the lies we all know who's wrong
         Homeless sleep on the city streets
         Waitin to die with nothing to eat
         While rich politicians soak their feet
         In the pools at their ten million buck retreats
         People hate people for color of face
         No one had a choice in the race we were placed
         A brother in Queens was beaten and chased
         Murdered cold in the streets, a goddamed disgrace
         Just because of his race his life went to waste
         And not one went to jail when the court heard the case
         Justice or corruption? it's all interlaced
         How can you swallow this? I can't stand the taste!"

        It's hard to say exactly how much Ice knew about the class struggle,
but it's obvious that he knows a damn lot about the end product.  He relates
to the more fortunate his struggle, and the struggle of millions like him in
the fascist Amerika.  One thing Ice-T knows is what the problems are and
what needs to be changed as an end result.  One thing I know is that he is
right.  The problems need to be solved by any means necessary.

        As for censorship and condemnation of rap, we can clearly see that
this song is not profane.  The true profanity is that these lyrics,
unfortunately, are not fiction.  These crimes against man come true, and the
message is stopped more times than it goes free.

        It is impossible to understand the transformations that Ice-T has
gone through in the last 11 years, but when Ice-T succomed to the whims of
"the powers that be", a true champion and hero of the underlying Communist
nation was lost.  I will now end my review with the immortal words the Ice
wove at the finale of Squeeze the Trigger:

        Most MC's today ain't got nothin to say.  A to the mother fuckin K!
