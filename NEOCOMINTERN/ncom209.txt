                        (please DO read the following)
  
  Apparently, they're now reading the Neo-Comintern on Mars!  You see what
  happens when I'm the editor?  I get things done.

  You know who else gets things done?  That's right.

  So anyways, we've got a bit of a treat for you this week.  Yeah, we've
  gone a little old-timey (aka 'old-skewell') with this installment
  featuring the three original non-BMC writers on the N-Com staff.

  It was a little difficult to pull off, really.  I had to summon Komrade B
  with a "weegie" board.  I had to sober Wayne up in order to let him get
  freshly drunk.  And I actually had to write an article.

  Tough stuff!  Enjoy!

  In all cultures, in all lands, and all throughout time, humans and
  non-humans have greeted each other in some fashion.  There are almost as
  many ways to greet a person as there are ways to leave them.  I've been
  compiling data since 1985 and finally have enough to put together this
  article on the best and blurst ways to greet someone.


  Handshake: A staple greeting in Western culture, but very dangerous.
  Maybe not dangerous, but disgusting.  I mean, for 90% of the people out
  there, you KNOW where their hands have been (in their pants).  Not to
  mention that this is the greeting that activates the time-tested and
  totally lame hand buzzer joke, which Uncle Rob insists on doing EVERY TIME
  I visit him.

  Rating: C-


  Bow: The staple of the EAST SIIIIDE!  This one works for me.  No touching
  and no eye contact.  This one has "classic" written all over it.  Remember
  also to look at their shoes.

  Rating: A


  Smile: They say a smile a day brightens up the day or something like that
  and they are correct.  I've always thought that when someone is smiling,
  they are at least two to three times better looking than when in not
  smiling mode.  Even people I would normally consider not that great
  looking all of a sudden reach mediocre status when they smile.  The only
  problem with this is that when a girl smiles at me I always assume they
  want to sleep with me.  Then they usually do.

  Rating: B+


  Nod: Hands down my fav.  Nothing wraps up the greeting experience more
  than a simple nod.  It's easy to do and can be used to greet friends and
  strangers alike.  There is just something so sincere about a nod.  For
  instance, say you have climbed the capitalist ladder high enough that you
  are forced to wear "dress" clothes to work.  So you are walking to work in
  your stupidly expensive clothing and you see a guy picking up garbage in
  his dirty coveralls.  If you ignore him, you are just being rude.  If you
  shake his hand, hug him, or any other one listed here, you could be
  mistaken for being condescending to him.  Only the nod gives the simple
  message "Hey, I respect you for what you do.  I realize that you are
  providing a service that is needed for the community.  In fact, I am even
  a little jealous because your job is down to earth and I just make money
  for some old man who already has a lot of money."  Combining a smile with
  a nod works well too, but do not use the smile by itself.  It is
  condescending.

  Rating: A+


  Hug: Mixed feelings on this one.  I'm all down with hugging people you
  either love or are very close to.  Yes, that includes same gender as well.
  My problem is with giving hugs to people who are almost complete strangers
  to you.  It cheapens the hug, not unlike how the word love has lost
  meaning because everyone uses it to describe everything they like.
  Especially annoying are the guys who go hunting for hugs, like some kind
  of lame hug hunter.

  Rating: B-


  Verbal: Usually "Hello", but if you know the person well enough, you
  can use the venerable "Hi".  As of late, I'll been putting spins on this
  and using phrases like "Good day" and "Top of the mornin' to ya".  For
  good friends, you can also insert an insult at the end.  Gnarly Wayne
  almost always uses this particular tactic.  Examples are "Hello, moron",
  "Hey, jerk", and "Top of the mornin' to ya, fuckface."

  Rating: B


  High Five: This used to be cool, but then Seinfeld said it wasn't, so now
  it isn't.  I remember trying to look cool doing this but then missing and
  making me look even more loserish.  The worst was missing once, laughing,
  and then missing on the second attempt.  If you attempted a third attempt
  after the second miss, you might as well tattoo "Kick my ass constantly
  and continually" on your forehead.

  Rating: C-


  Overhead Wave: This wave is highly utilized by moms and grandmoms alike.
  In theory it is quite sound but, once again, mothers and grandmothers have
  to ruin everything.  Not only do they totally overdo their waving and end
  up looking like some maniac orangutan but they insist on screeching out
  "Yoo Hoo! Over here!" like the frantic flailing of their limbs wasn't
  enough.  After you make eye contact so that they know you see them, if you
  so much as glance to the side, the whole process starts over again.  Geez,
  YEAH, I saw you the first time.  You're not some goddamn chameleon that is
  going to blend back into the crowd just because I happened to turn my head
  for two seconds.  A normal overhead wave would have ranked fairly high,
  but because of overzealous parents, it loses two whole grades.

  Rating: C-


  That is all for now and remember to use these in good or bad health.

                                                                       ,o$o

  So this weekend I caved and broke my movie boycott.  Sheer boredom seems
  to have more sway than my core values I suppose.

  The four movies in question were Scooby Doo, Insomnia, Mothman Prophecy,
  and Sam I am.

  Okay, I figure I could have selected better movies in which to break my
  stance on non-movie watching.  However, that's what was there so let's
  just drop it, alright?


  SCOOBY DOO

  First off, Scooby Doo.  This wasn't nearly as cool as one would think.
  Shaggy was almost a carbon copy of the cartoon.  Hank was Prince Jr. (nuff
  said), Daphne was pretty hot, and Velma...well in spite of the geeky
  exterior she was even better then Daphne, but lets not go there.

  Scooby Doo sucked.  He didn't even look real and he wasn't nearly as
  cowardly in the movie.  The villains and the mystery were not in line with
  the cartoon either.  Without spoiling the movie here is the guideline for
  the cartoon.

  The Mystery Bus goes to some out of the way place in a scary setting.

  They meet two guys.

  They see the monster.

  Shaggy and Scooby run around while the monster chases them.

  Daphne gets captured, Velma loses her glasses...

  They capture the monster and it turns out he's one of the first two people
  they met with the other guy being the victim of the whole scheme.


  In the movie they went to an amusement park full of people!  What?

  They met several guys.

  Shaggy and Scooby were chased a little bit but for the most part they just
  wrestled with each other.

  The culprits were numerous and not nearly as obvious as the cartoon.


  INSOMNIA

  Insomnia is that movie with Pacino and Robin Williams playing the bad guy.
  Pacino is a murder cop from L.A. that for some reason is sent up to Alaska
  to solve a murder.  Plus he did some bad stuff and L.A., and because it's
  always sunny in Alaska he can't sleep.

  Pacino's character might not have been able to sleep, but I sure was able
  to.  And that's no small feat considering I was sitting in a hot, sweaty
  car watching the movie. I woke up just in time to see everybody die.


  THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES

  The Mothman Prophecies was about some sort of moth-like creature that
  gives prophecies of future events to certain people for whatever reason.
  On the back of the DVD it says that the mothman gave Richard Gere's wife
  some sort of prophecy before she died and then two years later he receives
  prophecies when his car breaks down in a strange town.

  Well, when I actually watched the movie it appeared that instead of giving
  his wife a prophecy, the mothman killed her.  Then Gere's character sulked
  for two years before he met the mothman who started telling him about a
  disaster.

  I just couldn't follow the storyline.  Not because it was complex or
  confusing, though.  No, the reason I could not follow it was because I
  kept thinking (and suggesting aloud) that the townspeople should build a
  big bonfire.  If the creature was in fact a moth, it would be compelled
  towards the flames.  From there they could push it into the fire, or if
  luck was on their side it would simply fly into the flames.

  The logic behind that was if the mothman was dead he could no longer
  predict future events, and therefore they would not happen. Simple enough.


  SAM I AM

  Sam I Am.  This is that movie with Sean Penn playing a mentally challenged
  character. The box says the following: "A movie about Sam, a man who
  struggles to do the things you do with ease.  It's one of the great
  struggles of the heart."

  So, basically the movie was about some guy that struggled to achieve the
  mundane.  For instance:

  1. Eating soup without spilling 85% of it on his crotch.
  2. Petting a cat from the top of the creatures head downwards towards its
     tail.  Not simply pressing hard on the animal and rubbing in any sort
     of direction that met Sam's fancy.
  3. Running down a hallway without falling down any stairs or tripping on
     the floor.
  4. Going to the store with the intention of buying milk and bread and
     actually buying those items instead of soy sauce and lichen seeds.
  5. Successfully fermenting honey in his bath tub and making a top notch
     mead (one of my favourite parts of the movie).
  6. Forgetting to take his medication which causes him to run nude on the
     street until he comes upon a child whom he pummels and then steals the
     child's bike.  What's more human than that?
  7. Watching Will and Grace and getting 24 minutes of non-stop laughs.
     (Funny stuff.  You actually get to watch Sam watch the whole episode.
     During the commercial break when most people get up to go to the
     bathroom, Sam merely soiled himself on the couch and sat quietly until
     the show resumed.)
  8. Being in a plane which starts to go down.  Sam takes the controls from
     the dead pilot and the plane immediately bursts into flames.
  9. Reducing his drooling by 46%.

  So as you can see, Sam I Am (or I am Sam -- I can't remember) was my
  favourite of the four movies, in that I actually did not see that movie
  and just made up the stuff that happened in it.  Of course, the movie was
  in my hands and I could have watched it, but I would be just disappointing
  myself as I already had the perfect Sam I Am already in my head.

                                                                       ,o$o

  The day began.  That day was 2002.

  Kit pushed the button which rotated his body into the sitting position.
  As he did, he remembered the days when he used to use his hands for that
  purpose.  Those times were simpler and much more boring.

  His bedroom was made of steel and crystal.  So was his bathroom.  In fact,
  his whole world was made from steel and crystal.  At least, to Kit it was.

  Kit pushed the button that fully awakened him.  Then he decided to eat
  breakfast.

  As Kit was eating a healthy breakfast of tin-rivets and gasoline, he
  pushed the button that made him sigh.  "Oh Kit," he sighed, "when are you
  going to find what you seek..."

  "Today?  Tomorrow?  MAYBE SOMETIME AFTER I FINISH EATING BREAKFAST?  I
  don't KNOW!" answered Kit.  "I'm busy right now, in case you didn't
  notice!  EATING BREAKFAST."

  Kit pushed 'puree' then 'liquefy'.  He was full now.

  Kit rinsed his plate and put it in the sink.  He'd started himself
  thinking now.

  "When WILL I find it?" he wondered.

  He looked out the window and decided he would push THAT button when the
  time came.

  Kit sat down on the couch and pushed the button that turned the television
  on.  This button was on the TV.

  After he was done watching 'Ghostbusters', Kit decided to push the button
  that made him decide to go to the park.

  Once at the park, children screamed and ran from him.  His parents saw him
  and disavowed any knowledge of him.  A dog urinated on his wooden shoes.
  A gang of toughs lit him ablaze and rapped him with a knotty pine branch.
  But Kit tried to give an impression that he was having fun regardless of
  these unpleasant developments.

  All who saw him that day at the park say that he appeared to be enjoying
  himself.  Even when he was on fire, Kit could be quite convincing.

  As dark began to settle in the sky, Kit looked to the heavens and wished
  on the first star he saw.

  "Star light, star bright.  First star I see tonight.  I wish I may, I wish
  I might...have the wish I wish tonight," Kit wished.  He knew you couldn't
  say the wish out loud, or it wouldn't come true...

  "I wish I'd find what I was looking for."  Kit said this out loud by
  mistake, thereby assuring that he never would find ANYTHING.

  Later, as Kit was at home eating his dinner of tinfoil and fire, he
  realized his slip-up.  He pushed the button that made a tear march a path
  down his cheek.

  Kit was struck aghast by this.  "So it was all ... for NOTHING?  All of
  it," Kit whispered, "was useless."

  Kit went to his crystal bedroom and crawled onto the bed.  The button that
  made a tear march down his cheek was stuck, so Kit was bawling now.  He
  couldn't believe it!  Everything in his life -- everything that had led up
  to that one moment was rendered void with that one slip up in the park.
  And he'd been so careful!  Why now?  Why Kit?

  Kit pushed the button that made him die a natural death.  "Perhaps THIS
  was what I was looking for," he said with his last breath.

  However, as the life began to leave Kit's body he heard a voice.

  "No, Kit.  That was not what you were looking for.  You were actually
  looking for your bankbook.  And it's under the phonebook in the drawer in
  the kitchen.  You left it there last week.  Remember?"

  Kit remembered now.

  "...and if you hadn't been so stupid and said your wish out loud, you
  would have found it on Saturday.  But since you fucked up, you're dying.
  Why didn't you ever push the button that made you stop being stupid, Kit?"

  Kit was ashamed, but beginning to become annoyed.  But he was also
  finishing becoming dead.

  Kit's last thought was of some kind of noodles.  It was not very profound
  nor even very appropriate.
