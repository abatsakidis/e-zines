                                EDITOR'S NOTE
                      (please do not read the following)

        I get a few emails every week from people telling me how much they
hate my editor's notes.  They're not much of notes or anything.  They're
just stupid stuff crammed into this thing at the beginning of every issue.
They are almost never interesting or sensible, and they never ever impress
anyone or make anyone happy.  I have been told that if I were to write a
message consisting of "Amy rules" then at least one person will enjoy it.
But is that something that you would expect me to do?  No.

        Hey wait a minute, you're one of those people that hates these
things anyway, so why should I care?

        I've been passing around the idea of releasing a new Neo-Comintern
issue every six hours.  It has been agreed that doing so would keep all the
N-Commies busy and it would also provide certain undisclosed people with
nearly-constant reading.  On top of that I would make millions from all of
the pop-up ad banners on the site, etc.  The only problem with that is that
in the pursuit of keeping content up I would have to kidnap and torture more
writers and on top of that I would have to type meaningless drivel such as
this "editor's note" you are now reading for hours and hours and hours.

        So that would just compound the problem.  I give up - I guess I'll
just stick to doing what I do best.  Nothing.

Hello, how are you again?

That's the sound of the BMC talking to itself.

It told me a story the other day - a story about the place between wake and 
sleep, and not the other way around - this was the beginning of trance and 
not the end.  Now the BMC, a personal friend of mine, told me that where 
one might find a state between the conscious and the subconscious called 
the semiconscious, one BMC came upon a crossroads, or a mirror, where able 
to talk with itself.  By the flowing stream of tears I could be certain 
that this story was the product of true experience and not simply a fab.

In the midst of the soul the BMC met with the BMC, they say.  

.Face-to-face - or rather - mind-to-minD.

Here was a place where the BMC and the BMC chatted for minutes.  Carefully 
calculated words projected from the conscious and were returned by strange 
and unexpected answers from the subconscious.  Thinking, unthinking, 
swirling in chaotic harmony, a spiritual equivalent to what hydrogen and 
oxygen feel in the instant before they become water.  What did they feel?  
Kinship?  Love?  Unity?  Strangeness?  Ambiguity?  Neither BMC nor I could 
say for certain.  In sadness one knows nothing - and two know no more.

sad and slow

oh love we whistled to an air

who can brook bespoke the fair
