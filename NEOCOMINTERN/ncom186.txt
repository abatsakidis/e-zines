  Today it was requested of me that I write 4000 words on the concept of
  socialism.  What an odd request, isn't it?  It sounds a bit too much like
  work for my liking.  Maybe I'll do it the next time I have a week free.
  I think I've got a holiday coming up in 2005.  But for now, I'll say ten
  words on socialism.

  Socialism in the house!  Word.  Say socialism what what?  Jeah.

  That leaves 3990 words.

 -    -   -  - -- -------========{by Heckat}========------- -- -  -   -    - 

  beak:

  imagine a fishhook, a sickled
  hunting blade, a razor's edge stained
  black with blood, a limb, a plier,
  a wrench for getting things out of
  tight places, a thin, lipless maw that
  speaks flat notes into the wind

  remove it.  use it as a claw,
  as a hinge to fasten the door on your 
  two-year-old's playhouse,
  use it as a second mouth to swallow
  all those dead things you've been
  avoiding to clean up


  tongue:

  another animal, a snake,
  lives in crow's mouth
  its wet surface is a mirror
  reflecting the ugliest parts of
  the world back on itself
  once rootless, it lies harmless
  use it as bait to catch fish


  eyes:

  orbs distinguished by their absenses
  (no eggshell whites
  licking the corner of his lid,
  no irises capping a coloured
  ring around the pupil's abyss)
  they could be raisins, or deep pools
  of liquid, or planets, or the charcoal
  set of marbles you carried around
  in your pocket as an eight-year-old child

  only maybe there isn't anything there at all
  just two shadows shielding crow skeleton
  from scavengers


  wing:

  navigational device, "wheels," 
  the quickest way out of here
  only a pair will do 
  coat of black feathers (use those to
  make a boa for your niece's birthday gift)
  small, brittle bones remembering flight


  feet:

  textured roots, claws, the way
  crow clings to the branches
  of trees and digs in
  are these the worst parts of crow?
  his dirty, scratching toes?

  crow leaves footprints on our skin,
  marks his pacing beside our eyes
  our faces learn to reflect a lifetime
  of living with crow


  epilogue:

  crow's tender parts
  make tasty delicacies - the neck,
  the heart, the liver - serve
  him at dinner parties
  as an appetizer

  the rest of him can be used
  in magic potions (turn you to
  stone, make you fall in love,
  split your tail in half to make
  legs) or can quite nicely be
  used in pie

  Confessor:  My son, Love hates this vice above
  all others, and it should be avoided for that
  reason.  Boasting is to be despised in general.
  I will give you an example - here is a story:

  Ahem.

  The first king of Lombardy, Albinus, was a
  great warrior who battled against many other
  kings.  Once he fought a war against Gurmonde,
  who was the mighty king of the Gepidi; but not
  mighty enough to prevent Albinus from
  slaughtering him in the field.  Neither sword
  nor shield could save Gurmonde from getting his
  head cut off.  Albinus decapitated him, took
  the top of his skull - the brain-pan - and
  decided to make a cup out of it as a symbol of
  his victory in battle.

  After Albinus had won the battle and taken
  control of the land, claiming it as his own, he
  discovered Gurmonde's daughter.  She was the
  Maiden Rosemounde, renowned for her beauty,
  youth, and liveliness.  Albinus fell in love
  with her immediately, pursued her hotly, and
  eventually they were wedded.  From this point
  forward they stayed together, deeply in love
  with one another.  But, when they were at the
  highest point of love, Venus turned the wheel
  of fortune so they fell.

  Listen - the king had many things: wealth,
  worship, health, and a peaceful rule, and no
  enemies; life seemed perfect.  He decided to
  host a festival for Rosemounde's benefit, so
  that she could be introduced to all of the
  lords who served under his rule.  The king
  ordered his servants to quickly send out
  letters and dispatch messengers, and to get
  everything ready for the festival.  The king's
  royal horses were trained for jousting and
  tournament, and garments embroidered with
  pearls were prepared for the big event.

  When the time came, the lords arrived all
  dressed their best.  They battled for
  superiority in jousting and fighting in
  tournaments of combat.  The lords had a great
  time and forgot their worries.

  After the games, they came into the king's hall
  for a feast.  The knights were seated and
  served in order of superiority, and then prizes
  were given out as the heralds announced the
  victors of the games.  After this, knights at
  the high tables and at the low tables began to
  speak of pursuits of war and of love, and
  everyone had something to add to the
  conversation.

  Their cheer affected the king in such a way
  that he began to dwell on his own conquest
  until he was overwhelmed with pride.  He
  looked over and saw the cup off to the side,
  the cup he had made out of Gurmonde's head
  (as you have heard) after he killed him.  The
  brain-pan, as it were, had been layered in gold
  and set with large gems.  It was well-crafted
  and stood on a base of polished gold.  The cup
  was engraved in the most masterful way and
  freshly polished as well.  One could not have
  identified it as a skull at all, but would
  rather have thought it to be a griffin's
  egg (4).                                         (4) Griffin's Egg: a

  taken away - "...and fetch me that one," he
  said.  On his command, the skull was fetched
  and filled with wine.  So he asked Rosemounde
  to begin the feast with a toast.  "Drink with
  thy father, dame," he said, and she did as he
  requested.  She happily lifted the skull from
  the table and drank, having no idea what sort
  of cup it was that she was drinking from.  And
  then all out, the king announced to everyone
  that Rosemounde was drinking from her father's
  skull.  He did this to demonstrate his feat of
  battle to the lords, and also to brag about how
  he had won the love of the girl whose life
  began in that same skull.

  The room was saturated with the king's pride as
  everyone talked about it, but Rosemounde
  remained silent, thinking about the unkind
  pride that made the king boast that he had
  killed her father, carved out his brain, made a
  goblet from his skull, and tricked her into
  drinking from it.  She remained calm until
  dinner was over; then, she pretended she was
  ill.  When she got to her chamber, she spoke
  with her trustworthy maid and let her know what
  was the matter, on the condition that the maid
  wouldn't tell anybody.

  The queen promised to give her maid, Glodeside,
  wealth and fame in exchange for her help.
  Glodeside was to help avenge the queen upon the
  king, who caused her to drink in this manner
  (among the noblemen, as insult to both
  Rosemounde and her father).  Rosemounde was so
  furious about it that she determined she could
  never be happy until she could be certain that
  he would not be able to boast in such a way
  ever again.

  And so the queen and Glodeside came to an
  agreement, finally deciding on a plan.  They
  determined that they must get some valiant
  knight to help them kill the king.  With this
  in mind, they began to consider how they could
  recruit Helmege into their scheme.  Helmege was
  the king's wine bottler (5), a proud and lively  (5) Wine Bottler:
  young knight who was passionately in love with   translated from the Middle

  The next night the queen went in Glodeside's     chosen the word "bottler"
  place, entered the dark room, and made true      to avoid an anachronistic
  love with Helmege.  In keeping with the code     reading of the term.  At

  Glodeside).  And afterward, the queen lay at     observation that "the
  Helmege's side and told him who she really was   butler did it."
  and what he must do for her.

  She said, "Helmege, I am thy queen, and now
  thy love shall be proved.  For the one on whom
  you have wrought your will you shall repay,
  either by punishment and torture or by carrying
  out the deed I wish you to commit.  And if you
  will, do as I desire and keep it secret, for
  ever after I shall be at your will - I and all
  I possess."

  Helmage had fallen into a wild rage of love,
  which no man can control.  He was unable to
  resist, and he agreed to follow the queen's
  orders.  And so the wheel of fortune had spun
  awry, and there was no longer any chance that
  things would work out.

  The conspirators planned a scheme that was so
  brilliantly cunning that the king was dead
  within awhile; however, it was not quite so
  cunning that they could get away with it.  So
  they considered their options: either to flee
  or get caught.  They packed up the king's royal
  treasury (and many other things), assembled an
  entourage, and fled by ship.

  From that point, they sailed straight until
  they came to Ravenna where they asked the duke
  for his help.  The duke abided by their wishes,
  giving them a place to stay, but when he heard
  what they had done he prepared some poison for
  them.  They drank it, and got what they
  deserved - death.  And all of this was the
  result of proud boasting.

  Therefore, a man is better off not to assess
  himself on behalf of others.  Doing so may
  easily tarnish his reputation.  Don't brag
  about your conquests.  A man who tries to make
  a name for himself in order to become known for
  deeds of war or love will always fail due to
  bragging.  In conquest that is fought either
  with weapons or for love, a man must restrain
  his loose tongue, or, like a key, it will
  unlock him.
