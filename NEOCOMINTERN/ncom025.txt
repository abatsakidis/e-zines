                                   DJ YELLA
                               THE BEATS MASTER
                                    By BMC

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      
        This article is a tribute to one of the finest DJs of all time,
Yella.  Though many things have been said about this musical genius,
certain things will not be mentioned in this article.  There will be no
mention of his former groups or members thereof.  DJ Yella, this onez fa you.

        Yella is a gangsta rap pioneer who has played the background his
entire career.  He has been DJ, producer, and occasionally spoken-word
artist, doing an excellent job at all of them.  His cuts are some of the
freshest ever squeezed out of vinyl plates.  Unlike other "DJs" who can only
program drum beats, Yella has been a true asset to every project he has been
involved in.

        Yella was the opposite of the "braggadocios rapper" image.  He is
one of the few artists who perform for love of the music.  While most 90's
rappers fought amongst themselves for an inch of the spotlight, Yella stayed
sensibly in the comfort zone, working hard and enjoying the ride.  Because
of his reclusiveness, little is known about the man once dubbed "The Beats
Master" by Komrade B.

        Although Yella has been referred to by certain fan-bases as the Ringo
of his former group, he is the only one who was never dissed during the 90's
L.A. rap wars.  Note that Yella was in the center of this battle, but was
more civilized than to bicker with his former band members.

        One thing no fan can dispute is that the name Antoine "Yella" Carraby
is a true mark of quality on an LP.  I have never heard an album, a song,
even a note that did not please my ears when Yella had something to do with
it.  Yella is a class act, and everything he touches turns to gold.

         Except of course for his solo album, "One Mo Nigga 2 Go", which
was a record store bomb.  This is not a rap album.  It is not what fans were
expecting or wanting, but I think it is still an interesting album and is one
that should be added to the collection of any true Yella fan.  The proceeds
from sales apparently go to a good cause.  

        For Tha E.  Man, that's one painful song to listen to.  Is it rap,
singing, both, or neither?  One thing that can be said is that it is garbage.
It was obviously written with good intentions, but it sounds horrible.
Actually, most of the solo album is pretty creaky, but there are a few brief
moments of gold.  I'm sorry Yella, I had to tell it like it was.

        Yella having sex.  If that sentence disturbed you, skip song 18.

        So I figured that I'd get the "For Tha E" single.  Yep, five mixes of
For Tha E.  If you play tracks 5 and 4 at the same time something cool
happens, but I'm not allowed to reveal exactly what that is.
       
        Anyway, maybe Yella can't write a song like some of his allies could,
but he's still the best DJ and true Communist south of Massey.  Word.
