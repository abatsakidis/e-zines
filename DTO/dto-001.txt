 undecided
 why must it be that i act in two personalities?
 one, a well-lived, wise person.
 or another, a child with no common sense.
 it never makes a decision.
 i don't think it can.
 i don't think it will.
 why must i be one with undecided people living
 inside me?
 why does it come at the wrong time?
 the wrong personality that is.
 i wish once that it will make up its mind.
 the question is:
 which one is my true, rightful person?
 i guess i will know when it tells me.
 no one cares to find out, except me.

        why anyone would let me, of all people, introduce a new 'zine is
 beyond me, but, here i am.  ahh.

        greetings & salutations, kids.  it's nice to see you all again.

        i sure don't miss writing as much as i thought i did, you know.

        mogel gave me this list of things to cover here, so, let me get right
 to it ;

        a) who are we?

        we're the doomed to obscurity posse, silly.  i would hope you know
 that already.  
 
        you people never cease to amaze me.
 
        in case you truely are that clueless, i guess it wouldn't hurt to go
 over it _one_ more time.  first, let's make with the d2o staff.

        i guess i'm a good place to start.  i'm black francis.  i'm a writer.
 i've written for a few different 'zines, drawn for a few art groups 
 (something i'm really not that proud of), and somewhere along the line, i 
 managed to run a semi-popular 'zine dubbed "pEz monthly".  maybe you've 
 heard of it.

        "no."

        next up is good ol' mogel.  in case you've been locked in a closet
 for the past few months, you've probably heard his name muttered before.
 mogel is also a writer and has written for such prestegious t-file funsters
 such as cdc & vas.  mogel was also the president of a pretty large and 
 fairly successful t-file group named hoe.  hoe managed to to spawn ninety 
 issues of pure unadulterated zaniness before it's unexpected demise early 
 last month.  he's a wacky guy, that mogel.

        "whatever."

        swoon.  it's eerie.  yeah, so, eerie is a doodleboy.  big whoop.  the
 boy can write.  i bet you didn't know that, eh?  eh?  or maybe you did.
 while not jumping in and out of big-time ansi groups such as acid or 
 spastic, eerie has managed to run _two_ extremely successful e-mags.  number
 uno; ace - the music e-mag and number dos; undergrown - the ansi scene 
 related e-mag with some wit and intelligence thrown into the mix which had 
 quickly become a cult classic before it's premature death after only ten 
 issues.  eerie also has a really funny french accent.  tee hee!

        "make me an ansi."

        last but certainly not least is our little fuzzy pal, murmur.  um.
 well, umm, he was the vice president of my 'zine, and, umm, he wrote for
 bah a few times.  i guess that's it.
 
        he likes donuts.

        "what a lame ass."

        b) why are we here?

        who the hell knows?

        screw you.
        
        c) what is dto all about?

        well, in a nutshell, doomed to obscurity is a 'zine of the poeople.
 yeah.  or something like that.  whatever.

        doomed to obscurity is a 'zine that will _basically_ publish anything
 humorous, educational, though-provoking, informative, or anything even 
 slightly entertaining.  as long as it's not poetry, it's all good.

        doomed to obscurity is an independant publication that _relys_ on 
 submissions from people like _you_.  if there's something you want to say
 and get off your chest or whatever - you've certainly come to the right 
 place.  wether it be a short story you have written or an all out rant, 
 we're interested in publishing it.  if you're interested in submitting or 
 writing on a regular basis - check out the dto info file for more 
 extra-tasty-crispy-valueable information file for details.

        we also hope to pick up a few chicks along the way.

        d) how did this whole elite deal come about?

        well, it's a real long story, but i'll try to make it a big ass 
 run-on sentence just because i think i love you.

        mogel ran hoe i ran pez james hetfield runs std and he formerly ran
 milk and milk & tea then i killed pez and mogel killed hoe and james 
 hetfield killed std and mogel asked james hetfield and i if we wanted to 
 start a 'zine together and we all agreed and we couldn't decide on a name so
 jamesy quit and started his own 'zine nihilism monthly and then eerie wanted
 to join and so we hooked up with him and then we made murmur a president as
 well so we could basically round it off to four guys and here we are now.

        e) what are your goals for this 'zine?

        two words - geraldo!

        oh shit.  that's only one word.

 +-- dto --+

        well, woo hoo.  that was a barrel of monkeys.  i guess we're all
 finished, then.  got any more questions?  tough shit.  i really don't care.

        anywho, it's been a blast.  you kids enjoy yourselves.

 + dto spotlight on - james hetfield
 
 james hetfield; writer - james hetfield is so elite, he's sneaky pete.  his
        garfield figure and his yellow eyes keep the women far, far away.
        very few can say they have the charisma that james hetfield has,
        mainly because those that do tend to be small insects.  in the near
        future, james hetfield will be rapidly changing the meet the growing
        demands of a changing global environment.  meanwhile, he will be
        watching reruns of rerun on "what's happenin' now?" and eating lots
        of skittles.  "skittles has fur!" - official fod [tm] rumor

 + submitted by - james hetfield

        i've always hated this time of year.  all the people going off to
 college.  everyone all sad and stuff about leaving their friends behind.
 bah.  humbug.  i don't have any friends to leave behind.
        
        this is also the time of year that the most 'zines die and the
 most writers stop writing.  well, good for them.  leaves less competition.
 i'm tired of hearing people whine and moan about the scene.  maybe they'll
 all leave.
        
        unfortunately, soon will be the time that the most new kids get
 into the scene.  they never have any writing talent.  humbug.  i hate them
 all.

 +-- dto --+

        i woke up that night to a chill running down my spine.  i looked
 up, and above me was some type of apparition!  i jumped out of bed, trying
 to get away from it, but it followed me where ever i went.
        
        "hetfield... james hetfield..." it moaned in its breathy voice.
        
        "what? what do you want with me??" i yelled in fear.  it held
 it's ground.  
        
        "i am the ghost of guido sanchez.." it shrieked.
        
        "guido? is that you?! i thought you were... well, you are..."
        
        "i am trapped on this planet to walk the streets every night
 because of my crimes to the scene..."
        
        "your crimes to the scene?  but guido, you were one of the best
 writers..."
        
        "save yourself, while you can!  tonight you will be visited by
 three ghosts.  each will show you a different time.  heed their words, 
 hetfield, for they are your only salvation... otherwise you will end up
 like me... mee... meee..." he howled as he exited the room.

 +-- dto --+

        i must have fallen asleep for a while, because when i woke up
 my alarm clock was blaring.  i didn't remember setting it.  the time was
 12am. midnight.
        
        i felt a light breeze pass me.  i looked up, and there was a man
 dressed in white robes.  he had long, black hair, with a streak of purple
 in it.  
        
        "epic? is that you?" i asked him.
        
        "it is i, the ghost of 'zines past.  i used to be one of your 
 favorite writers, james hetfield..."
        
        "you certainly were! those articles about sea monkies were
 great!" i said as i smiled.
        
        "alas, james hetfield... i am here to show you the days of 'zines
 past... take my hand...."

 +-- dto --+

        "what's this? blah headquarters???"
        
        "yes, james hetfield, blah itself.."
        
        "wow! i've never seen this before!!!"
        
        guido sanchez was sitting at his computer, typing away.  he was
 drawing out an ascii portrait of bob dobbs, with the title on it "why
 we all exist".  chessman was at another computer writing "a clockwork
 banana".  
        
        "this was your beginnings, james hetfield.. trying desperately
 to get into blah, and failing miserably..."
        
        "don't i know it.  i was such a bad writer then... my stories were
 silly, but really bad..."
        
        "they might have been bad, james hetfield, but you had fun writing
 them, did you not?"
        
        "well, yes...but..."
        
        "and do you have fun writing anymore, james hetfield?"
        
        "well..."
        
        "take my hand, james hetfield."

 +-- dto --+

        "i totally forgot about this!  this is a chi-chis in chicago!
 look, there i am, sitting next to guido and connie and the melter, a guy
 that wrote for za/\/!"
        
        "yes, james hetfield, those were good times, were they not?"
        
        "you bet... and there connie is, getting yelled at by mall 
 rent-a-cops!"
        
        "a topic for a later blah file, wasn't it?"
        
        "yeah, it was... hey! there's nyarlathotep!" 
        
        "one of the writers that wrote the most for your zines, am
 i correct, james hetfield?"
        
        "yeah...wow.  the memories."
        
        "take my hand, james hetfield."

 +-- dto --+

        "hooey! look! there's me at my computer, typing out blah-die.txt!"
        
        "yes, the file that was never issued, but somehow got to every
 blah distro sight, right james hetfield?"
        
        "yeah.. it was an exact copy of the death of superman, word for
 word... that was great..."
        
        "take my hand, james hetfield..."

 +-- dto --+

        "james hetfield, this will be your last trip in 'zines past.
 do you recognize this?"
        
        "yeah!  this is my house!  i'm looking through all the milk
 files on my computer... some were horrible, but some were great... god,
 those days were so wonderful... everything was happy and bright... epic,
 don't make me go back, i just want to stay here forever..."
        
        "we must go back, james hetfield.  take my hand..."

 +-- dto --+

        i found myself in my bed.  i tried to doze off for a while, but
 soon i heard a voice above me.
        
        "james hetfield... james hetfield..."
        
        "what? huh? who are you?"
        
        "i am gumby, the ghost of 'zines present.  you must come with
 me and envision my visions."
        
        "uhm.. ok."
        
        "take my hand, james hetfield."

 +-- dto --+

        "oh.  hee.  yuck.  this is where i wrote all my std files.  they
 were so pointless.  some of them were good writing, but the idea of just
 starting the group out of thin air was really stupid of me.  hardly anyone
 wrote for it."
        
        "yes, james hetfield, that is because the sun is like the moon."

        "what?"
        
        "nevermind.  take my hand, james hetfield."

 +-- dto --+

        "hahaha! there's mogel finishing up hoe4_95!  that was one of the
 greatest packs a 'zine could ever have!"
        
        "yes, james hetfield, and what happened next?"
        
        "oh.  well mogel got sick of hoe and wanted me to run it, then
 he killed it soon afterwards."
        
        "yes.  you are correct james hetfield.  take my hand."

 +-- dto --+

        "that's black francis... writing his gumpy epilogue to pez_025...
 that was such a great 'zine too... all the best 'zines are just dying out...
 i'm out of the scene, black francis is out of the scene, mogel seems to be
 out of the scene...
        
        "light is the opposite of darkness, james hetfield."
        
        "yes... so?"
        
        "take my hand, james hetfield."

 +-- dto --+

        "oh heh.  these were the hoe vs. gasp fights on the network.  they
 were pretty funny, but really stupid too."
        
        "yes they were, james hetfield.  where is gasp now?"
        
        "it's dead..."
        
        "and where is hoe now, james hetfield?"
        
        "it's dead... why are you making me do this?  bring me back, i 
 want no more part of this.. i can't take it any longer!"
        
        "you have to see it all.  take my hand, james hetfield."

 +-- dto --+

        "oh no.  bring me back now, gumby.  bring me back.  i can't take
 any more of this."
        
        "no. what do you see, james hetfield?"
        
        "it's guido... he's fucking his girlfriend... and hacking a unix
 board at the same time... whatever happened to his creativity?  why did he
 decide to leave the scene?  look what's happened to him now... he just hax
 and fux... gumby, let me leave already, i've seen enough..."
        
        "very well.  take my hand, james hetfield."

 +-- dto --+

        my alarm clock woke me up again.  the time was 2am.  
        
        "wake up, james hetfield, we've got work to do."
        
        "who... what?  pip? is that you?"
        
        "yes it is, james hetfield.  i am the ghost of 'zines future.  i was
 such a bad writer in my day, that they made me see the future of writing to
 see what i should have been doing.  this is my punishment.  now it's time to
 see yours.  take my hand, james hetfield."

 +-- dto --+

        "aghghghg! what's that?"
        
        "that's mogel, james hetfield."
        
        "but...but... he's so fat!"
        
        "when he decided to let hoe die, his life went to pot.  he now sits
 around and eats bon-bons and doritos all day and watches soap operas."
        
        "oh god.. mogel? what have you done to yourself?!?!"
        
        "take my hand, james hetfield."

 +-- dto --+

        "oh... no... who is that?"
        
        "that's black francis."
        
        "no... no.. whats...whats..."
        
        "a homeless woman lived by him, that used to take baths in the river
 by his house.  after black francis gave up on pez, he had way too much free
 time.  he's spend his days by that river, throwing rocks at her all day
 long.  so one day she bought a gun and shot him in the head six times, and
 threw him in the river with her.  he was never found.  this is his rotting
 body after 6 months."
        
        "take me away, pip, take me away please... i cannot see any more..."
        
        "we have one vision left to see, james hetfield."
        
        "i cant' handle it! please don't make me!"
        
        "you have to see it, james hetfield, take my hand."
        
        "no! i won't do it! ... these are pictures of the future, right?  i
 can change these visions, right?  this won't necessarily be my fate, will it
 pip?"
        
        "take my hand, james hetfield."

 +-- dto --+

        "noooooo. nooooooo!!!! ahhhhhhhh!"
        
        "yes, james hetfield.  it's you.  it's you working in an executive
 office somewhere in chicago.  you make 7.50 an hour and work 60 hours a 
 week to support your wife and two children.  you have no creativity left
 inside of you.  your a pawn of the establishment, james hetfield."
        
        "god... pip.. i can change, right?  this is only the future that
 is set right now, correct?  i can change my outcome, can't i???"
        
        "you have seen enough, james hetfield.  take my hand."
        
        "i can change, pip, i can change!!!!!"
        
        "take my hand, james hetfield."

 +-- dto --+

        my alarm clock went off.  it was 6am.  i went directly to my computer
  and wrote 5 straight wacky files.  they weren't that good, but they kept me
  happy.  i can change.  i will change.
        
        i called up m0g and frannie that day, and i pain-stakingly somehow
  convinced them to form a new group.  and this group will keep us from what
  we are destined to have our fate be.  we will change the future.

 shadow tao; writer - even while living in the presence of his loving
        conservative parents, tao has become a true factor in the politics of
        the world.  while many people look to him as one of the true
        spiritual guides of the planet, he actually has nothing more than a
        high school diploma.  this student/guru spends his time typing out
        odd stories and weird tales to amuse himself and others.  shadow tao
        is quickly becoming a force to be reckoned with, as illinois has
        quickly fallen under his message "the internet does _not_ have *chat
        rooms*, that is america online, you morons..." he is attending the
        prestigious illinois wesleyan university (also attended by the
        more-than-notable murmur) and is a computer science major.  he is
        hoping to take a minor role within the up-and-coming 'mogel-world.'

 + how to become a conservative nut for love and money!@!@
 + propaganda by - shadow tao

        has your social life lost it's greater meaning?  do you sit at home
 and wonder what you *could* be doing to help america?  join the conservative
 religious right!  we're the majority, no matter how many people object!

        when you join us:

 1. you'll be assimilated into the group!  right in the comfort and 
    convenience of your own home!

 2. you won't have to think anymore!  just repeat what everyone else says!

 3. you'll have a reason to distrust officials and lie on your taxes, 'cause
    you'll be persecuted by the government!  (even though we control the
    senate and house, the government is operated by the bureaucratic satanist
    liberals, don't you know?)

 4. you'll get a nifty hat!

 5. you can make neat-o conspiracies! (more to come)

 6. your party is _the_ party of _god_! yes, the holy father is a republican!
    (says so in the bible)

 7. shitloads of monkeys!  rhesus! baboon! gibbon! we got 'em all!

 8. the opportunity to oppress peoples here and abroad; all in the name of
    'the american way.'

 9. we've got all the cash!

 10. monkeys!  don't forget the monkeys! big nosed, hairy boobed,
     pink-intestine-covered-buttocks monkeys!

        join now and you'll be able to afford the new tax jockeying.  you
 belong to us!  remember: even if you don't join, in a few years, we'll own
 your property anyway.  and then, we'll rent it to you at three times the
 going rate!

        "how?" you ask?  it's a four step process!

 1. we get a cause.  we find something that really challenges the fundamental
    principals of the constitution.  like "free thought" and "people who
    disagree."  or "having to treat aliens like human beings" and "not being
    able to call foreigners spickywopkrautchinkn"

 2. we beat the hell out of it.  fax your congressman 10 to 10,000 times a
    day!  make sure to do it at night so that he can't open his door in the
    morning.  (btw: if you _do_ elect a woman, make sure it's a good lookin'
    one, 'cuz we don't want ugly fat chicks in congress!)

 3. we find a conspiracy.  the world is full of these beauties.  just pick
    one and run with it.  be sure to be current, though.  example:  when the
    whole davidian deal started, an appropriate party comment would be:
      
      a. i think we should try to figure out what they actually believe.
      b. bomb the fuckers.  commies from hell.  guy thinks he's jesus, fer
         crissakes!
      c. maybe having tanks there is making this worse.
      d. connie chung! aww yeah, i'll hoist her anchor, baby!
         <wink, wink, nudge, nudge>

        answer:  b.  well, d is good.  yeah, d!@

        one year after the davidian assault, the party comment would be:

      a. our alien overlords came down to dictate to our puppet government
         what to do.
      b. it was all a big mistake.
      c. my ferrari is in the shop. <sigh>
      d. vince foster actually led the raid, and hillary shot him in cold
         blood to prevent his damning testimony.

        answer:  c.  (but there were a _lot_ that answered d and a!)

 4. we sell it, sell it, sell it!  pieces of david koresh's skull!  pictures
    of the u.n. invasion force!  do-it-yourself militia kit!  guns!  bombs!
    hatred!  pro-life!  christianity!  we have it all!  (remember, we're not
    hypocrites, we're an oppressed group that is crucified by the liberal
    media!)

        join us for the money; we have all the cash.

        join us for the love; we have all the monkeys.
 
        join now!

 + dto spotlight on - mogel
 
 mogel; co-editor, president type - born under poor conditions, the 
        mysterious figure known as "mogel" has set forth upon an intricate 
        and "fool-proof" plan to climb the social and economic ladders of 
        america, only to eventually dominate the world.  according to him,
        this 'mogel-world' will "become a reality in our lifetimes.  well, 
        that is if the government doesn't stop me."  currently, mogel writes
        contrived fiction and message-encoded essays on everything known to 
        man.  yes, even turnips.  mogel's last e'zine project was the 
        illustrious 'zine hoe, an anthology of the life and times of each and
        every member of congress.  mogel refuses to comment on _any_ of the 
        rumors about his past affiliations with any sort of hacker community
        and any of his run-ins with the law.  all we know for certain about 
        this mogel is that he is a philadelphia native attending some college
        in new york as a film major, and that he is very, very dangerous.

        plop!
        
        i rolled off my bed and onto the floor.  thump went my body.  my eyes
 blinked open.

        "three ayyy emmm" blinks the bright red numbers on my annoying clock.
 it was a pretty crappy clock.  then again, i was never one to care much
 about clocks.  after all, it did what i needed; it told the time in bright
 digital numbers, and it had that always-important eleven-minute snooze
 button that was my friend and deadliest enemy at the same time.  i had
 dueled with that clock many a morning!  realizing that i had actually
 dedicated this much thought to a damn clock would normally bother me, but
 that's okay right now 'cause i'm here now at three in the morning lying on
 my floor and i don't have anything better to do but have my goofy mind
 wander.

        yep, i do have a goofy mind.  my emotions do that big stupid yo-yo
 bouncy-bounce action every few hours and i can hate myself and love myself
 in the same sitting.  i think too much.  i over kill.  i obsess.  i don't do
 my laundry.  i guess it's just my personality.  i like to think about things
 that aren't actually important to my every-day life.  i'm a self-destruction
 souflee, babycakes!  my life is falling to pieces, but "hey!  i found the
 coolest pocket lint!"  the irony moves on and on with me because i _know_
 that i've got all kinds of important ideas to spew than so many other morons
 out there that actually _do_ have the chance to be heard, but say nothing of
 any value.  and here i am doing nothing, wasting away my life in a computer
 obsession.  sometimes i feel like i've lost everything.

        and i look at me, i'm 19 years old, and i'm here.  there's people
 that go to [insert excellent academic college here] and think and learn
 these wonderful thoughts and ideas and they never actually _use_ them,
 except to write papers for their class.  what a wonderful world we live in
 that the _only_ reason we learn something is to do well in that class.  not
 so, you say?  ah, it happens all the time.  we live in a bullshit world
 where it's implicitly become the national expectation to become a doctor or
 lawyer.  doctors; who can charge whatever they want.  lawyers; we actually
 encourage people to become assholes.

        hey!   a congested justice system in this country is fun!  let me sue
 you 'cause you looked at me funny.

        "who can solve my problems?"  
        
        "someone bigger than me!"
        
        "who can i blame?"
        
        "someone else!"

        woo-woo!  what a fun game!  it's easy, baby!  play along!

        in today's world we have _50%_ of kids going into the hopeful state
 that they too can become part of the wacky field of _entertainment_, 'cause
 they know that many entertainers today can make a fortune with virtually no
 talent.  amazing, you say?  it happens all the time.

        gettin' sick of this train of thought, i pull my tired self up off
 the floor and go to my bathroom to pee.  it's funny that i can get up like
 this.  it seems like i have such a natural love for sleep.  maybe it's just
 an escape.  i never bothered to analyze it really, which amazes me, 'cause i
 usually make myself puke with over-analysis.

        random thoughts are fun.  it's a morning thing.

        i'm such a rebel 'cause i'm the most normal person alive.

        don't get me wrong, it's not like i'm a complete dimwit.  sure i've
 basically amounted to nothing in my life, but you must remember that most
 people have, so it's okay!  i'm more hip than those gen-x punks.  i've got
 so much slack they can't even fuckin' conceive of it.  whee!  yeah, it is
 pretty immature to compare your patheticness to other people just to feel
 better, but i mean i'm not all that immature.  i don't play with my
 transformers anymore.  i've passed my comic book phase.  i don't even
 understand what the hell the appeal is with the power rangers.  but wait!
 i'm not an adult!  adults _suck_!  they limit themselves!  you can't trust
 them!  they're not fun anymore!

        yeah!   i'm so hip it _hurts_.
        
        hey!  what if there's a naked girl in the bathroom waiting for me?!

        i turn on the light.  damn.  no naked girl.  but i do get a chance to
 see the cockroaches scatter.  oh boy!

        it feels like i haven't slept in days.  

        "hypothesis: i'm a worthless moron," i mumble.  "why am i a worthless
 moron?" i actually stop myself for a moment to ask.  i proceed to step on a
 cockroach and react quite disgusted.

        "because," i start "i can rationalize the right thing to do forever
 in an infinite number of ways, but i never seem to gather up the motivation
 to run out and do what's important."
        
        of course, there is that morning hyperbole thing.

        having peed a full 2 minutes and turning the toilet water a very dark
 amber, i flush.  you didn't want to know that, you say?  good.  that makes
 two of us.  sometimes all i know is that i know nothing.  hey.  someone
 famous said that.

        "fuck plato," i mutter to myself and head back to my room.  i get
 back on my bed and i realize that i can't sleep.  damnit.  i can _always_
 sleep.  what the hell is my friggin' problem?!  what do i want?  something
 was definitely on my mind.  then it hit me how bad my lack of motivation for
 _everything_ really was.  did i care about anything anymore?  i'm just a big
 stupid sack 'o flesh that means nothing.  okay, okay.  enough of this
 thought.  what the hell do i want this *minute*?  money?  not really.  love?
 maybe.  sex?  couldn't hurt.  fame?  oh yeah!  that's it!

        ten-thousand screaming girls clutching themselves at my feet.  it
 would be an honor just to fuckin' see my face.  i want every guy to phear me
 and every girl to want me; i want one very special girl to *love* me.  but
 then again, who doesn't want this?  and i'm sittin' here realizing that
 typing these characters on this screen do nothing to accomplish that, and i
 continue writing this sentence and it's gettin' pounded deeper into my mind
 that i'm just venting.  what am i accomplishing here?  is this just a
 pathetic psychological babble to get rid of a little stress.  did anyone
 care?  did anyone relate?  what the hell am i doing here?  shouldn't i be
 outside making good conversation with my friends?  the days of my life pass
 so quickly i can't even stop for a minute and enjoy anything.  wait.  that
 sounded familiar.

        "fuck socrates," i say in a fit.

        i'm gettin' all giddy.  i'm gettin' into a spaz.  i'm starting to get
 rootin' tootin' mad 'cause i'm sitting here in the middle of the night
 staring at the friggin' ceiling and i'm bored.  i'm bored senseless.

        don't hate me 'cause i am just so k-rad.

        "you should never fear death," someone said to me.  i don't!  i
 don't!  you've gotta be special.  you've gotta do somethin'.  you've gotta
 be somethin'.  hut!  hut!  make that mark, boy!  without struggle there is
 no progress!  don't forget it!

        "fuck douglas!" i say.  i'm boppin' in a tissy now.

        i remember hearing about a guy that was so crazy that he loved to
 have problems.  the man was so damn happy, that he was getting bored and
 _looked forward_ to problems just to break the monotony of his life.  maybe
 happiness = boredom.  they say the smarter you get the more depressed you
 get.  well, i'm fuckin' einstein, baby!  feel my brain!  rub it!  caress it!
 make it part of you!  you'll _dream_ of having the sexy funk-brain that i 
 got when i was born!

        love me.

        "that mogel is so full of shit!  die!"

        it's pretty ironic that someone like me has never found love.  i
 _beg_ for it, but i never find it.  i've never really connected to any girl
 i've ever gone out with.  i've never 'truly' loved anyone, and yet i love
 everyone in the world.  isn't this sick?
 
       i'm gettin' pretty pissy now, so i snap and punch myself hard in the
 left eye.  ouch!  i've got a black eye now.  "it'll go away," i mutter to
 myself.  i've got problems.  maybe i can fix them like that man.  yeah!  i
 can fix my problems up real good!

        i jump up and run out of my room in a fury.  i leap down the stairs,
 four-at-a-time, and i run outside, making sure to nab my quick-bag of
 assorted rad snacks.  it's all quiet outside, and i wanna stop to enjoy it,
 but no-way-jose 'cause i got stuff to do.  i bop over to my backyard and
 climb up my ladder.  it would be neat to have a flash light, but i'm too hip 
 or that sorta of thing, and i'm in a rush to get up.  a small collection of
 ding-dongs accidentally flop out of my back, but there's no turning back,
 baby!

        i'm crazy!  i'm wacky!  i'm zany!  i'm nuts-o!

        i get up to the roof and i'm lookin' over the edge and it's amazing.
 here's my house.  here's my neighborhood.  here's my city.  here's my life.

        "fuck you!@#!@#!@#!@#!#@#!@!@!@#!@#!#!@@#!@!!1" i scream out to the
 world at the top of my lung and i'm lovin' every minute of it.  a light
 turns on and someone pokes their head out their window and craftfully says
 to me "shut up!"

        "fuck _you_!" i say to them.  i peg a twinkie and score a direct hit
 on the guy's bald, yuppie head.

        "die!" i say, "you fuckin' suck!"

        the guy retreats with a puzzled look on his face and he goes back to
 sleep.  he is instilled with _phear_!  my anarkee is complete!

        "fuck you!@##@!@#@!" i repeat again.

        no response.  bliss.  i pompously devour a box of sunnydoodles.  i am
 at peace.  i am finally free.

 stat: private netmail                  origin : 27 jul 95  19:32:28

    you know, when i got the phearnet application pack and saw

            "phearnet, the most exciting thing since soup"
                                        -m0g

 i thought that this net might have some potential entertainment value, that
 the people who run it have a sense of humor. but having been in phearnet, i
 realize that you people are some of the most anal, dickfaced elitist 
 bastards in the computer world.

    you people should lighten up and learn to joke around a little. i can
 have intelligent conversation in my history class at school. why should i 
 spend my message writing time making sure everything is perfect and the 
 message is intelligent? why should i spend my time deleting mail left by 
 users who spent their message writing time leaving those messages. nobody's 
 perfect, asshole.

    i hope you and your rich little pals have a good time writing intelligent
 messages to each other like a bunch of harvard geeks. without bottled
 violence. i'll be out with friends laughing at cripples, winos, and 
 especially geeks like you and the people on your net. having a good time.

    maybe i'll even publish a 'zine. a real zine, none of this retarded
 e-zine shit. a 'zine that interests people whose hobbies don't include 
 sitting on the computer all day and arguing about what is a lame post.

    fuck you.

 + the question of representative democracy
 + submitted by - murmur

        i'm not going to amble on endlessly about this; i just want to get a
 couple ideas out, and let people think about them.

        what is the purpose of a representative democracy, in a simple sense?
 even simpler, what is the purpose of the representative?  basically, he/she
 represents his/her constituents by functioning at a higher level to get
 things done for those constituents.  a plurality of votes, in most cases, is
 what elects a representative to his/her office.

        without going into mindless detail, an interesting question that has
 recently been posed once again stands out:  should the representative vote
 in such a way that it falls in line with the constituents wishes?  a
 majority of the constituents wishes?  what if the representative disagrees?
 what if the people are simply completely wrong?

        this comes up now because of the renewed bosnian question.  people
 don't want to send in american forces; so far as i'm concerned, we have no
 other option at this point. , but i'm not going to debate that.  the thing
 is:  no matter what, the two options are send in troops or don't.  no
 halfways anymore.  and here's the thing:  presented with a troops yes,
 troops no question, people will say no.  so what should our president, our
 congress do?

        for argument's sake i'm going to say the right thing to do is send
 troops in; this is being used as an argument and i'm not preaching about
 bosnia.

        the question becomes one of priorities:  do the wishes of the people
 outweigh the concept of doing what's right?  if the people vote to do things
 the wrong way, should the government do the right thing anyways, because
 it's right?

        i don't want to get too in depth, but think about that:  would you
 rather your president did the right thing or what the majority of the
 population wanted?  which is "constitutional"?  what's the correct recourse?

        i say right overrules majority.  that's me.  what about you?  this is
 an important question, especially when it comes time to vote, which many of
 us already legally do and many more of us soon will.  do you want a
 man/woman that will abide by the people's wishes above all else, or that
 will do what's "right" above all else, in such a situation?

        just food for thought.

 eerie; president-type, writer - eerie lives somewhere up there in canada. we
        don't know where exactly. actually it seems like he doesn't even know
        where he lives. all we know is that he is under high observation at 
        some asylum.  his favorite sentence is "the best way to get rid of 
        suicidal tendencies is to blow your head out."   he spends his days 
        wishing he was thurston moore, which is kind of pathetic. the two 
        things he does best are: saying "hey! don't fuck with my nigguh 
        okay?" with an american accent and breaking guitar strings. his main
        project for the future is to become an alternative rock star, marry a
        pseudo punkette and get rid of his suicidal tendencies.

 + piss them off
 + submitted by - eerie

        okay, this is kind of a little guide about how to get parents and
 other stuck-up people to be pissed off at you.  follow it and be glad i 
 wrote it, cuz who would have been loser enough to write _this_?!

        a) _the basics_.  of course, the first things to do are pretty 
 simple, you've prolly done them all already, which is e-wheat.  first: you
 need to get a funky haircut.  grow your hair long, dye it green or just 
 shave it off, but do something.  second: get some tees.  violent tees, if 
 possible.  with alot of blood on them.  and skulls, maybe.  a "legalize it" 
 tee is always a must too.  don't wash your jeans.  don't wash yourself at 
 all.  okay, now you look dirty.  well, no, actually you don't, but stuck-up 
 conservative piece of shit lamer people will think that you are dirty.  
 there, you pissed them off.  congratulations, but keep on.  three: music.  
 play it loud.  don't listen to any easy-listening stuff.  if possible, and 
 even if you don't like it at all, listen to death metal stuff.  (or white 
 zombie, cf ftg#2 or #3, i don't remember but that was a nifty artikul) play 
 it even louder.  if you have an electric guitar, play it loud too.  play 
 the guitar and the death metal tapes all at the same time.  buy a drum and 
 play it the loudest.

        b) _religion_.  be an atheist.  better even, be a buddhist or a 
 muslim.  follow the cult _religiously_.  you need it.  i mean, you can have
 your hair dyed green, sometimes it just won't do it.  you need something 
 more shocking: religion.  well, actually, you can even fake it.  it's not 
 like anyone cares.  just try to look really really really involved.  if it's
 not even enough, then just join a sect..  be a jehovah witness.  knock at 
 your parent's door every morning at 5am to tell them about how to be saved.

        c) _sex_.  even if you don't, say that you have alot of it.  
 publicly.  support free distribution of condoms in schools.  support 
 condom-free sexual intercourses.  support homosexuality, incest, necrophilia
 and bestiality.  better even, be one of those.  have your little sister tell 
 your mom you had sex with her and she liked it.  say that cemetaries are the 
 most erotic places you know.  kiss your dog on the mouth for at least a 
 minute while your parents are looking.  funkier even, be a homosexual.  if 
 you are a guy, well everytime you go out say that you went at paul's, or 
 whoever the name, make sure it's a guy name, always the same.  sleep over at 
 his house.  after a month or two, "break up" and act depressed.  your 
 parents will go bezerk.  you don't even need to actually fuck with the guy.
 just fake it.  well if you want to, go for it.  it will only be more 
 realistic.

        d) _opinions_.  support everything they don't support, and vice 
 versa.  this is rather simple.  explain people that you believe in violent 
 anarchy.  tell them that the schools should teach children how to build 
 bombs.  now you pissed them off.  what was the point?  there was none.  it 
 was just fun.  i mean, why be nice with stuck-up people?  i'd rather be 
 hypocritical a bit so it gives me a good laugh when i see how they react.
 it's only a big game, but you're the only one who gnoze.

        make good use of this e-wheat information.  take care.

 eightball; writer - this is the first 'zine in which any of 8ball's work has
        been/will be released.  however, eightball is far from a newbie.  
        this modem warrior has been at the fringes of "the scene" for roughly
        six or seven years.  he has been writing stories and poems (damn 
        better than gasp, although that's not notably a difficult feat) 
        since he was old enough to write.  he currently resides in a suburb 
        of philadelphia, pa, where he continues to work on fresh ideas for 
        dto.

        "welcome to ihop.  my name is <insert stupid generic name here>, and
 i'll be your server today."

        the words; pounding in my head.  the boy, no older than 16, wipes the
 droplets of sweat from his forehead as he scribbles down yet another order. 
 this mere child, not yet old enough to vote for the legislators that decide
 the fate of his well-being, has been pressed into a life of servitude.  
 gazing around the restaurant, he sighs in relief on noticing that his 
 manager is not present.  one little slip-up could mean termination.  

        i observe his movements for a while. he moves with determination; 
 with pride.  why is he here today, taking orders from white trash scum?  why
 does he remain within these walls, giving his all for pennies and dimes?  i
 ponder the answers to these questions while munching imitation scrambled 
 eggs, powder-mixed pancakes, and the innards of animals who eat their own 
 feces.

        this boy is a member of the "working class".  he works 12 hour shifts
 of back-breaking labor for four dollars an hour?  but just think of how 
 proud his parents must be of their growing son, earning his keep at a local
 eatery.

        international house of pancakes:  where a raise is the height you fly
 to when they kick you in the ass; where job security means your father is
 the general manager; where meals are free for employees, but you have to pay
 to make a phone call home.

        his smile fading slowly as he takes yet another order, the boy
 ignores the sneers and jeers of his "friends" hanging out across the street.
 "why can't *i* be out there?" he questions the air.

        "smile! you're working at ihop!"  the boy turns around quickly, to
 see his shift manager writing him up again.  

        "sorry, sir.  i enjoy working here.  i really do!"

        "then haul your ass away from the window!  you have three tables 
 waiting for their orders to be taken!"

        "yes, sir."

        muttering to no one in particular, he trudges along slowly, like a 
 puppy after its daily beating from a poor master.  

        "welcome to ihop. my name is <generic name>,  and i  will be your
 server for today.  may i take your order, sir?"

        the man to whom the questions are directed looks up, as if noticing
 for the first time that he's in a restaurant.  "yes, uhh... i'll have the 
 'rooty tooty fresh 'n fruity combo', with a side of scrapple, and a large
 mountain dew.  dear?"

        the man's companion, a striking woman in her forties, responds
 softly, with one of those accents you just can't place, "i'll have a large
 salad and.... a small orange juice."

        the boy waits for a minute, and says "will that be all?"

        "no, no..  a kiddie platter of eggs and bacon for each of the 
 children," answers the woman.

        the boy looks around him; confused. "ma'am, children?"  they have no
 children!

        "yes... over-easy for frank, scrambled for little jessa."

        "yes, ma'am."  the bewildered waiter enters the list into the
 computer data-base at the rail.  "man," the boy thinks to himself, "i need 
 to stop staying up so late.  i'm starting to see things."
        
 +-- dto --+

        who am i, you may be wondering?  i'm a "service assistant", doomed to
 the same shit-hours and shit-pay as the waiter aforementioned.  and yes, i
 too work at ihop.  i make $5.50 an hour, plus tips, and i'm the highest paid 
 "service assistant" in the whole place?  that's right.  i bus tables, wash
 dishes, assist the cooks, clean the bathrooms, mop and vacuum the floors,
 and the list goes on and on.  why?  because i, too, strive for the "american 
 dream".  what's the american dream?  come on, now!  m-o-n-e-y.  i degrade 
 myself 72 hours a week to bring home a $300 paycheck every week.  

        and i, like every other teenager in this society, ends up spending
 the whole damn thing every weekend.  oh, but there's so much out there to 
 buy... some new clothes?  sure!  drugs?  why the fuck not? i'm already 
 fucked up enough as it is.  that's why i don't watch t.v.  i'd go into 
 debt... t.v. is one big commercial.  they want the hard-working members of 
 the lower middle class to spend their hard-earned cash on this product and 
 that.  
        
        it all comes down to this:  everyone wants money.  why do we need
 money so badly?  because money is power.  you have the power to buy a new 
 shirt - now you can laugh at the people who can't afford to.  power!@!@  use
 it to go see a movie?  well, you're one up on the loser who can't afford to 
 take his girlfriend anywhere... you're out every fucking night!  power!!! 

        we, the working class, just keep getting sucked in farther and 
 farther.  your father has a lease to pay every month for that brand new
 lexus (don't forget - i live on the main line of the philly area!), so he 
 can't afford to buy food.  your mom needs a new dress, so you have to buy 
 your own school supplies.  because - we work!  and since we work, our 
 parents figure we have nothing important to want to spend our money on, so
 we might as well buy stupid things.  "a car? haha, you're only 16." "a 
 down payment on a house? but you have 4 years of college before that?"  

        speaking of college... now what would your parents say if you wanted
 to, say, drop out of high school, get your ged, and start writing freelance 
 for a local paper?  they'd say this: "but you need an education for any job 
 out there.  you need to get a job where you can make money."  

        "but what if i think i can do it without going to college?"

        "no son/daughter of mine is going to be a drop-out junkie!"

        so... they want "what's best for you", huh?  they think, "we're poor,
 and money means happiness, so that's the best thing for our child."  well let
 me tell  you something dad,  money may be power in this society, but neither
 money nor power mean happiness...  because what does someone want when they 
 have *some* power?  they want more.  am i the only one who sees this as a 
 never-ending cycle, where happiness just isn't to be seen?  if i want to 
 spend my life in a cardboard box in the middle of china town, composing pad
 poetry and drawing stupid cartoons to support my drug problem, who cares??
 if i'm happy, truly happy, then what do i need large sums of money for?

        if you get one thing out of this file, i hope its that you should do
 whatever you want. do what will make you happy.  don't live your life to 
 make other's happy.  just make sure to remember this:  live for you.

 + where have all my children gone?  a reflection in six movements
 + submitted by - murmur

        alright, you little pantywaists.  it's time to take a reflective
 look in the mirror.  to accomplish this, we'll use six distinct movements.

 1 --> put your left foot in.  now, do you see a problem?  you should.  you
       should notice your left foot, jammed up against the mirror.  what?
       you're not using a full wall mirror?  you're an idiot.  you already
       fail.
 
 2 --> check your tonsils for phlegmy oozy yuck.  is there white crud on
       your tonsils?  it sucks, doesn't it?

 3 --> turn around, and gaze as best you can over your right shoulder.  is
       your ass too large?  if so, diet, you damn wildebeest.

 4 --> jam your nose close enough to the mirror to see nose hairs.  now,
       that's marvy.  can you *see* them little snotties on your nose hairs?
       can you?  sure you can!  you're a better person for it!

 5 --> make many funny faces.  if you're frightened by yourself, go sell
       yourself, fast man, to the highest clown.

 6 --> stand tall.  if you bump your head on the ceiling, sell me your
       volkswagen!

        now that you've taken a reflective look at yourself in six movements,
 let's see what we've determined.  are you demented?  do you eat your pinto
 beans by themselves, or smothered in potatoes to alleviate the awful taste?
 do you even know what a pinto bean looks like?  how about a 78 ford pinto?
 ever been in one that's exploded?  how about a gremlin?  those gremlins
 were uglier than satan, but still got you from new york to shabbona.
 it's nice to see that with just a little coercion anyone can feel a
 whole lot better.  don't you feel better?  i feel so much better i'm going
 to eat your children, and you'll be left asking, 'where have all my
 children gone?' and i'll say 'to my belly, where they belong, the dirty
 little whores.'

                nirvana, frank black, shellac, dinosaur jr,
                green day, etc.
        him ->  you fucking poseur!!!
        
        + real world scenario border ends

        i'm being honest, shit like that actually happens to me.  i've 
 compiled ten of the biggest trends of today for your brain to soak up.  
 thank me later, when all your friends hail you as god.

        1.  call everyone who isn't a clone of yourself a "poseur", "prep", 
            "redneck", or "loser".  it's similar to stereotyping, but even 
            worse.  (example:  "look at his clothes, he's wearing shorts!  
                                fucking prep!")
        
        2.  pull your underwear up into your ass so the stripe at the top
            is a little above your shorts/pants.  fuck the wedgie you get, 
            it's all for style!
    
        3.  wear the "kurt cobain 1942-1994" t-shirts.  boohoo, the 
            spokesman of our generation died. let's wear his t-shirt, 
            because exploiting dead people is a trendy thing to do.
        
        4.  have your wallet attached to your pants by a long as shit 
            dog-chain.  make sure you don't trip over the chain, because 
            if you do, you're not cool.
    
        5.  when people ask you what type of music you like, tell them indie
            rock.  then tell them how cool your new bush cd is.
    
        6.  if someone asks you what your favorite tv show is, tell them
            it's "friends".  nobody actually likes that show, it's just
            been marketed as a "trendy" show, so you gotta tell everyone
            you love it.
             
        7.  smoke a lot of pot, because pot is pretty trendy.  if you tell
            everyone that you hallucinated while you were high, they'll 
            think you're a god.

        8.  write a lot of angst poetry.  make all your friends read it.
            they'll crown you as the next messiah.

        9.  bitch about your favorite bands becoming popular.  lie and tell
            everyone that you were listening to them in their garage days.
            no one will ever know you first saw them on mtv alternative 
            nation.

        10. tell everyone that i'm your best friend, because i am the god
            of being trendy.
    
        there you go.  impress your friends, become the high school stud.
 it's the cool thing to do.

        "my hair, it is the eat!" poor oswald was losing grasp, losing his
 touch of karma.  the inflappable mister jacoby was much more receptive to
 this influx of fresh insolvency.  alas, poor frannie, i knew your sheep
 well.  "fight this generation, man!" but oswald was frantically drowning
 in his own frantic self-pity.  "my hair, it is the meat!"  he would not be
 rescued by mister jacoby today, who hungrily thirsted over the periodicals
 in the burnt out doctor's waiting room.  "shut up, you childish lug nut."
 "my hair, it is the sweet!" and oswald was at the breaking point, the
 lavender slowly oozing out of his cranial cavity.  "who do you think i am,
 a muddy old jesus?"  alas, poor frannie, i knew your sheep well.  "my hair,
 it is the eat!" cried oswald, and he slipped, backsliding fearlessly.

 a strange face.

 we have met before.
 i cannot recall the

 maybe it was in dreams.
 when our souls passed
 each other.
 it has jointed us forever.
 we will never see each
 on this land.
 our hearts and souls will
 be one until the end of time.
