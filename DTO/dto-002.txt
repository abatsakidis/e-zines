 painful thoughts dance in my head.
 maybe i should go ance with the dead.
 many people have taken this path.
 some more famous than others.
 a few rock stars, a son, a daughter,
 or maybe even your mother.
 this choice solves nothing.
 it has nothing to prove.
 it's a big cry for attention when
 you are in a bad mood.
 everyone thinks that this is the
 answer.
 but, when you lie awake in your bed
 asking yourself if a gum to your head
 will make you feel good again.
 shrug it off and get some much needed
 rest.

        it's like there's a party in my pants - & everyone's invited!

        well, welcome back.  if you are coming back, that is.  this could 
 very well be the first issue of _doomed to obscurity_ that you've ever read.
 most likely it's not, though.  i mean, this is only the second issue.  but 
 see, chances are that you've read issue one.

        "shut up, lamer."

        anywho, let me remind you kids of something before i begin - _doomed
 to obscurity_ is a _monthly_ 'zine.  you know, like, every 29-31 days.  
 yeah, monthly.  now, if i'm going to release it early (which, i assure you,
 will not happen often if it does at all), i'm going to release it at my own
 leisure.

        what am i getting at?  i will say this once & only once - DON'T BUG 
 ME FOR THE LATEST ISSUE.  THIS MEANS _YOU_.

        ok.  now that i've got _that_ out of my system.

        oh yeah.  important news here :  um.  ok, i've decided that i really
 don't like running a board.  yeah.  took me a while to figure that one out,
 i guess.  so, basically, what this means is : no tacoland.  no tacoland 
 means, bing, no _doomed to obscurity_ whq.

       eek.

       now, somewhere along the line, i was stuck with the task of finding a
 new whq.  the very first idea to pop into my little mind was to make dto
 totally internet oriented.  kill the middleman & not even use a whq.  then i 
 realized that there are still some deprived folk out there who don't have
 internet access.

        shit.  ok ..

        next, i searched high & low for someone who ran a board (preferably
 a 'zine board) & had actually heard of _doomed to obscurity_ (finding 
 someone who _liked_ it was a whole other story).  much to my surprise, i had
 no luck.  no luck, whatsoever.

        double shit.  alright ..

        now i began to panic.  i began looking for a half-way decent board in
 _my_ area code that had even a _hint_ of 'zines online.  then, amazingly
 enough, i get some e-mail :

 +-----+

 doomed to obscurity or whatever... no need to upload it, I already got it on
 irc..... the board it said to call (i forget it) but the nup was dreams are
 free... well that board hasn't been pickin up for.. like... 3 days since i
 tried callin it.... I'd just like to say black francis you are like god and
 stuff.... um.. if you'd be so cool, call my board or zip up all the red's
 and pez's and give 'em to me... I think I got up to reading red #8... right
 after the interview with you and somebody....

 "is that a banana in your pocket or you just happy to see me"
 "oh this? that's a banana"

 call my board paste!
 215.862.5894
 by the way were you the dood that was obsessed with
 woodchucks? If you are I suggest special help
 heh heh but it was pretty cool

 d a r k a n g e l

 +-----+

        this kids timing was uncanny.  it amazed me.  so, anywho, i asked the
 dewd, like, "dewd!@  do yew wanna be, like, dto whq?" & being the smart 
 fellow he is, he accepted.

        so, after delaying the release of this issue a tad & getting some
 things straight, paste is officially crowed _doomed to obscurity_ whq.

        man, that's a load off my back.

        (_doomed to obscurity_ writers & hopefuls continue reading.  
 everyone else - leave the room)

        now, you may or may not be wondering, "dewd, what da phunk am i gonna
 do about mah submissions & them pesky ell-dee billz?"

        well, there's not much _you_ can do.  once again, here are your 
 options :
        1) upload all submissions to _doomed to obscurity_ whq - paste (the 
 number is listed at the bottom of this file & in the dto informational 
 file).
        you can either setup your own account there or use the dto guest
 account, "snuffkins".  the password is "snoopy" (don't ask me - i don't run
 the place).  this gives you access to all of the dto restricted areas & will
 help you avoid the trouble of creating an account & waiting for access.
        
        _or_
        
        2) mail all of your submissions to dto@lavadome.jetbbs.com.

        (everyone begin reading again)

        anywho, the whole crew did a super-bang-up job with this issue.  i
 sincerely hope you enjoy it, fuck-face.

 + the most elite bbs in the world
 + submitted by - murmur

        edgar had grown quite disgusted with the warez scene.  he'd been a
 warez trader since the ripe age of 13 (first he had been an annoying little
 geek on chat boards).  edgar became widely known and regarded in warez
 circles as having the fastest and best warez.  but, edgar was 18 now, and
 was growing tired of exchanging copyrighted software.  sure, he was on top
 of the game, but he'd come to realize his associates were morons.  still,
 he liked getting the games first, and he didn't want to completely blow it
 off.
        
        edgar ran a rather well-known elite warez board in the 414 area code.
 414 wasn't the most widely known area on the map, but it wasn't a slouch
 either.  people from coast to coast knew that when they dealt with edgar
 (glassshard to his warez buddies) they were dealing with an important
 individual, and they all went out of their way to butter him up.
        
        this all ended when a new influx of youngsters eager for the latest
 doom wads and simulators plowed into the scene with a complete lack of
 respect.  people called edgar's board and leeched it dry as best they
 could.  edgar got pissed and cut off all leeches and trimmed down his user
 list but the trend swept across the scene and suddenly no one was uploading
 but everyone was downloading.
        
        finally, edgar had had enough.  he decided his days as warez courier
 were over.  he was discussing his decision with one of his friends, ray
 (airraid) when edgar said, 'hell, ray, if i'm going to run another board,
 i'm going to run a board you can only log onto locally, just to keep the
 fuckin' lame-ass 12-year-olds away.'
        
        ray thought the idea was brilliant.  'edgar, that's it.  you'll have
 the most elite bbs in the whole damn country.  you work on a new board, 
 i'll go out and spread the word.  a local-logon-only board.  then, after
 time, when a couple of us real people have come over, logged on, we can
 drop the whole warez bit, and run a *real* fucking bbs.  if you *ever* want 
 access, you have to log on locally *first*.'
        
        edgar thought ray had lost his mind, but he agreed.  edgar said he'd
 have his new board ready at 7 a.m. monday, and he would keep it open during
 specified hours during the week for local visitors.  he thought maybe,
 maybe ray and frank and charlie would show up, maybe some adventurous warez
 kiddie if ray bothered to get the word out.
        
        at the very least, edgar decided to impress ray by setting up one
 hell of an amazing board.  using *sophisticated* techniques edgar
 personalized his creation, no outlet, into one of the best set-up boards
 the area had ever seen.  it would be a waste, he thought, when only four
 people got a chance to see it.
        
        among other things, he altered the upload and download commands so
 that instead of initiating protocols downloads would be to the 3.5" a:
 drive, uploads from.  edgar imagined some dipshit coming with 27 disks to
 "download" windows 95 from him.  the whole idea seemed rather novel, and,
 at the very least, it would get old timers in the scene talking about what
 was wrong with things again.
        
        come 4 p.m. monday, ray and charlie had paid a visit to edgar.  ray
 was amazed at the setup.  'shit, man, you should put that up for everyone!'
 but edgar was firm.  charlie said he'd never seen another bbs set up so 
 well and if he had to log on locally, he would, at least once a week.  
 edgar laughed at them both.
        
        by tuesday night frank had stopped by, drew had stopped by, and ray
 came back with some kid named joe.  everyone was raving about the setup.
 edgar called a local message board on wednesday and found out quite a
 discussion was being whipped up about no outlet.  by thursday night alan
 and ralph had come by, and a couple little warez kiddies had too.  edgar
 had more users on no outlet in four days than some boards had gotten in a
 month, and they all had to log on locally!
        
        the warez kiddies were so impressed they kept coming back, armed with
 their tdks, 3ms, and basfs.  edgar decided to go ahead and add active
 message bases if people were going to *use* the system.  they did.  and,
 even more impressive, they posted.  they brought warez *with* them.  edgar
 was stunned as his user base hit 50 and his message bases displayed more
 activity than any other board in town.
        
        within a month no outlet was the hottest commodity of all.  at least
 ten people would visit daily, sometimes arriving in such bunches edgar
 couldn't accommodate them all well, so he started charging them for snacks.
 and they paid.  in fact, people started hanging out in front of edgar's
 house.  ray and charlie and frank were almost always there; they had all
 met new girlfriends, stolen from little warez kiddies who brought their
 'cool gurlz' with them.
        
        edgar was going insane.  the number of visitors a day was reaching
 the hundreds.  people were fighting for the computer.  edgar could only
 either shut the computer down or open it up for calls, hoping people would
 go away.
        
        at first he tried letting calls come in.  but the people kept on
 coming.  people that didn't know the first thing about computers were
 coming for edgar's bologna sandwiches.  he grew angry and frustrated, as
 now his warez were of no use to him.  his computer was completely occupied,
 24 hours a day.
        
        finally, over three months after no outlet opened, a freak hard drive
 crash silenced the board.  when the board itself died, some people still
 came, but in smaller and smaller numbers.  suddenly even the bologna lovers
 went away, and edgar was by himself.  ray came by one day that week with his
 latest score, a 14 year-old redhead.  'too bad about no outlet, man.'  but
 edgar wasn't so disappointed.  'man, it was driving me wild. lemme tell you
 what i learned from this mess.'  and thus he proceeded:
        
        'i always thought, you know, talking to people over a computer, that
 was kind of weird.  then no outlet happened, and look.  all these computer
 people start talking to each other in person, having a hell of a lot more
 fun than they would at home, typing away.  but they're all here, primarily,
 to type away to get my warez.  it's so weird.  and then people show up,
 people without computers, because they're such fucking losers.  ray, all 
 these people were losers.  we're losers.  but it's done now, and i'm out,
 and i realize, hell, i'm going out and living.  somehow no outlet proved
 that it's more fun with a whole shitload of people.. although it was a pain
 in the ass for me, keeping my eye on the grubby little thieves.'
        
        'my warez days are over, old man.  i'm getting rid of it.  i've got
 my windows95, my word, my pinball, my qedit registered, what else the hell
 do i need, eh?  heh.  i need to get out, away from the fuckin' computer.
 the computer, that one computer it seems, brought all these weirdos here,
 here, my house, to do god knows what, with their warez, and then all these
 extra weirdos, and they were all here for no good reason, and when that
 reason died, it took forever to get rid of them.  these people have no
 damn minds, they just keep coming back to the same old cheap shit.  enough.
 i'm movin' on.'
        
        ray found edgar's words moving, moving indeed.  'that's great, edgar,
 that's abso-fucking-rific.  but, what are you going to do with yourself
 now?'
        
        'i'm starting a text file group, ray.'

        anytime is the right time for anarchy!  what a better way to enjoy
 your day than toppling the government & liberating the opressed!

 +-----+        
        
        now, see, i am anarchy _incarnate_.  when people think of anarchy - 
 they automatically think of me.  well, nine times out of ten they do, at 
 least.  
 
        anywho, whenever someone has an anarchy related question, who do they
 turn to?  me, of course!  90% of the time, i'm asked the same thing :

        "frannie, how can i sock it to the man with minimal effort & 
 thought?"

        why, that's an easy one!  i have enough simple do-it-yourself anarchy
 tips to fill a book, and, since i enjoy helping out my fellow freedom 
 fighter oh-so-much, i'm going to share one with you today!

        for informational purposes only, of course!

        here's what you do, find someone you wish to inflict anarchy upon
 (ie - a police officer piggy ham sandwich oink-oink motherfucker!) & 
 approach them.  try not to look suspicious & most importantly - stay calm.
 they'll know something's up if you're sweating like roger ebert.
 
        tell them to repeat the following phrase three times fast :
 
        "one smart fellow.  he felt smart."

        then, the unsuspecting victim will attempt to repeat the phrase as
 told, eventually slipping-up and saying :
        
        "one fart smellow.  he smelt fart."

        then, quickly, run away shouting something along the lines of, "down 
 with oppression!  anarchists of the world - unite!" so that you may take 
 your anarchy elsewhere without being supressed by the man!

        congratulations - you have just inflicted anarchy!

 + hiroshima revisted
 + submitted by - shadow tao                

        i figured because of the anniversary of the bombing of hiroshima and
 all, that i should write an article about it.  i just wanted to let you all
 know how i see things.
 
        i live in a retirement community.  i don't live in an area populated
 by a huge percentage of senior citizens.  i don't live in an area that is
 surrounded by retirement communities.  i live _on_ the grounds of a
 retirement community.  my father's job requires it.  anyway, this means that
 i am forced to interact with a greater percentage of wwii vets than, say,
 your common 19 year old.  these people who live around me say that the
 current view of the bombing of hiroshima is a disgrace.  they say it is a
 disgrace to the memory of the people who died fighting wwii.  they see it
 from the point of view that is shared by a majority of their peers.
 
        "america the good and just," they say with a glimmer of patriotism in
 their eye.

        the japanese, understandably, don't share that view.  every time pbs
 runs a documentary about hiroshima, they always show a child.  a child,
 through the repercussions of the atomic bomb, that has lost all hope of a
 normal life.  a child that grows into a scarred adult, who ages into a
 deformed senior.  through the horrible and awesome power of the atom, these
 children have been destroyed.

        unfortunately, like a lot of things, both of these views are right.
 but, in the very fact that they *are* points of view, they are blind to the
 greater truth of the atrocities of war.

        almost every wwii age vet views his actions through the lens of 50's
 american propaganda.  everyone knew what hitler was doing to the jews.
 everyone knew the evil actions of the japanese military.  what everyone
 didn't know was that even though these countries had to be stopped, it still
 didn't make the war just.  we were not "god's army" marching off into hell.
 we were not "the forces of justice" liberating the oppressed masses.  we
 committed the same acts and did the same evil.  we crusaded and killed
 innocents.  we conquered other lands.  we oppressed people.
     
        the returning soldiers and generals came home to a grand welcome.
 there were treated as heros and role models.  somehow, during all this
 flag-waving and kafuffle, the warriors somehow attached the acts that they
 did to the cause they fought for.  the bombing of cities and industries in
 foreign lands no longer stained their minds.  the burning of the jews
 somehow began to outweigh the 50,000 people that had been vaporized only
 weeks before in a manner so horrible that even hitler himself could not pull
 off.  the horrible torture and experimentation was somehow more painful,
 even more so than the thousands in japan whose skin began to fall off from
 flash burns.  the bombing of london was somehow more sinful, more sinful
 than even the incendiary carpetbombing of major japanese cities.  the threat
 of the nazi empire was the greatest threat to democracy the world had ever
 known.  it somehow even overshadowed the empire of fear brought by the atom
 bomb, the greatest threat to human life that the world had ever known.

        the japanese have felt the sting of the american military.  the great
 atom bomb dropped onto their peaceful city, vaporizing thousands of peaceful
 civilians.  thousands of children were killed instantly.  thousands of
 children, who spent considerable amounts of time stabbing straw dummies made
 like soldiers.  we were to believe that we had killed the innocent children.

        in this war, there were no innocents.

        the japanese had become the greatest military power in all of the
 pacific.  they had conquered great portions of china and the philippines, as
 well as innumerable islands.  they had conquered and murdered, tortured and
 destroyed in ways that are almost too gruesome to think.  they had done so
 through the efforts of a thoroughly militaristic populace.  even the
 americans paled at the comparison of the cause within the japanese empire.
 the citizenry supported the war.  yet they were "innocent civilians."

        my point is this:

        there was no "right" cause or "right" side to be on.  we all became
 murderous barbarians.  it was clear that we had to stop hitler.  it was
 clear that we had to do _something_.  what wasn't clear, apparently, is that
 the ways is just as important as the means.  we oppressed to stop the
 oppressors.  we murdered to stop the murderers.  we bombed the shit out of
 german cities, killing hundreds of thousands, only to overrun the city with
 tanks, claiming to have 'liberated the people.'  we fought a war against a
 madman burning jews, only to end it by incinerating the japanese.

        we became the very thing we fought against, and somehow, gained a
 sense of righteousness in the process.  there was no winners, no victors, no
 world-wide happiness.  war is pointless and idiotic, and the faster we come
 to realizing that fact, the faster we can work towards a true and lasting
 peace.

 + barium enema
 + submitted by - eightball

        interesting title, you may notice.  well, if you've ever had one, i'm
 sure you're cringing right now.  enema:  (n) when some man you don't know
 decides to infiltrate your anus with a tube.    barium: yummy unidentifiable
 white "stuff".  together, they cause hundreds of americans yearly extreme
 pain and discomfort.  

        picture yourself entering a hospital.  your general practitioner (or
 pediatrician for you kiddies) told you that the procedures today would be 
 necessary to figure out what exactly is wrong with your digestive tract.  you 
 complained about acid indigestion, heartburn, reflux,  etc.  he suggested 
 this rather inexpensive procedure.  so here you are... 

        you arrive in a waiting room, where a female (its always a member of
 the opposite sex who comes to make sure everything's ok) nurse escorts you
 to the changing room, so you can slap on your rad hospital threads.  she 
 then tells you to drink whats contained within a sealed bottle.  upon 
 opening the bottle, you discover that this mysterious substance is some 
 sort of carbonated pink juice.  ..oh, and it smells horrible.  but, you have
 to drink this, so you might as well get started.  you shudder as wave after 
 wave of disgust roll over your body.  but hey - a chick gave it to you! 

        anyway... so after about, say, 20 minutes, she comes back and takes 
 you to an examining room.  now, i don't know about you, but when a 20-some
 year old girl asks you to lift your cheeks (by the way, you're not wearing
 any underwear, so you're not sure exactly what she can see), it's not a 
 typical day.
 
        now... let's assess the situation here.  you're  lying down, in some
 strange hospital, with a young woman who's applying lubricant to your 
 sphincter.  embarrassing?  no way!  you're too elite for that.  so after 5 
 minutes of easing this gel into your asshole, a thoroughly humiliating 
 experience, the doctor finally comes in.  he explains a little more about 
 what's going to happen. you do not like what you hear.  he flips a screen on
 next to you, and proceeds to insert a long tube into your behind.  first 
 feeling:  discomfort.   hell, that's being light - all out fucking pain,
 man.  suddenly,  your bowels are suddenly feeling quite bloated.  yes, he's 
 turned the tube on,  and you're feeling barium entering your lower digestive
 system.  he tells  you you can watch your intestines expand on the viewer 
 adjacent your bed.   damn,  there's nothing like having gallons of a foreign
 substance travelling the opposite way through your body. 

        after 10  minutes, you feel  as if you've eaten out burger king four
 days in a row without going to the bathroom.  finally, he extracts the tube,
 but maintains that you have to continue to clench your sphincter  so no 
 liquid will escape.  now, you're still watching your intestines on this 
 screen (how the hell are they monitoring the insides of you, anyway?!?!?),
 and you're practically in tears, begging to be let to go to the restroom.

        at last, you're permitted to run (and i mean run!) to the bathrooms 
 (which, of course, are on the other side of the hospital),  and let it all
 out.  but man, you've never shit like this before... its  like pissing 
 liquid from the wrong hole.  and when you go to wipe, you can't even tell if
 there's any barium to collect, because its  white!  

        on your way out, the nurse smiles at you, and leans over to you, 
 whispering, "don't worry,  i didn't look."

 - yeah right -

 + logic shmogic
 + submitted by - mogel

        arlen spector is my hero.

        i sit here everyday thinking about my confused past life.  you know,
 the one i used to have before i was wiped clean.  sometimes i really wonder
 if i was crazy.  i had a million thoughts everyday from the simple to the
 complex - all intertwining, multiplying, splitting, shitting, and merging.
 it's all a big blur to me now.  life is just a big blur.  i forgot why i was
 even put on this earth.  there's no irony here.  don't look for it.
        
        people always are asking what their purpose in life was..."who am i?
 why am i here?" they would always wine like little nitwits from the
 generation of the 24th letter in the alphabet.  i just snickered and sat
 quietly arrogant to myself - for i could honestly say at one time, i knew
 the answers to life.
 
        well, that was until i forgot it.

        i remember little peices of what once once my purpose in life.  some
 insignifgant ramblings i used to have about not wanting to be labeled as
 anything.  but that couldn't have been it.  i certainly could not have
 thought so illogically!

        yes, my life was a shit hole of stupidity until i found logic.
 sometimes i even wonder if i found logic or if logic found me.  it doesn't
 matter anymore, however, since i had grasped the force that was to be my
 entrance and escape from the world at the same time.  logic was an amazing
 force - it was like discovering one day you have super powers.  like one
 day getting blasted with gamma-rays and gaining a new un-human ability.
 people don't understand logic the way i do, but i use that to my advantage.
 i used to be one of them.  one of the sheep.

        how could i have missed such an easy paradox?  the mere fact of not
 wanting to be labeled is a label!  how stupid.  everyone knows that the
 world is finite.  there's just so much you can do and that's it.  no more.
 it's pathetic and pointless to fight logic, isn't it?  i mean, logic tells
 us we cannot say things like "the are no absolutes."  of coarse, we all know
 that that statement is an absolute - creating a paradox that we just
 couldn't deal with in a logical society.

        fortunatly, whatever past life and past thoughts i had were just
 that.  the past.  i have learned through a good solid college education,
 law school, and grasping the full force of logic how many things in life
 actually pointless!

        for example, i have learned that hope is one major thing that is
 totally pointless and a waste of time.  it's all an illusion to care about
 what's going to happen, since obviously whatever is going to happen to one
 will happen anyway, whether they dream about it or not.  it's just a waste
 of precious energy.

        love is also a waste of time.  people that marry out of love are
 illogical and stupid.  after all, we all know that the logical purpose of
 marriage and relationships are to create a family that will benefit society
 as a whole.  what does love have to do with that?!  the answer is obvious:
 nothing.  love, like hope, is a waste of time as is just another human
 behavior that is a socially patterned defect that we need to systematically
 erase.

        and the most common and equally stupid illogical human behavior is
 compassion.  this is something that simply cripples progress.  any 
 intelligent or successful business, person, or organization will tell you
 that when you spend your time piddling around for the benefit of others, it
 only makes you weaker.  logic tells us that only the strong will survive,
 so fuck everyone else but yourself.

        the day i was finally bathed in the light of logic ans wisdom, i was
 granted serveral insites about my ignorant, moronic past life.  after
 further pondering i then discovered the whole idea of having a "purpose in
 life" was a completly illogical idea, since there is obviously never a way
 that any human could actually figure out what their "reason for living" was,
 unless, of coarse they were about to die.

        what could i have possibly been thinking?!  didn't i know these
 things?  logic is so basic, so obvious.  logic makes everything total
 perfectly senseable.  yellow is not the color yellow because mr. john yellow
 said it was.  yellow is yellow because it is truth.  logic is all truth.
 and we all know there is no hiding from the truth, no matter how scary.

        thankfully, through the glorious higher education that was logic, i
 have learned that my former life was just a waste of hoping flesh.  i can
 hardly even conceive of the disgusting things i used to do.  i used to have
 dreams, thoughts, feelings, and (get this) - i used to write about my
 feelings.  what an ilogical, wasteful loser i was!  everyone knows that all
 modern writing is complelely stolen from other writers of the past.  why
 must we slow down progress by just repeating the old?

        my entire past life has been joyfully washed away.  i can now sit
 back in my roofless bmw by the beach.  it's great to have the weekend off
 from washington.  yes, i know that taking a vacation slows down the progress
 of my job a bit, but i feel in the long term it is more logical to relax.
 for then i will be more regenerated for work!  yes, logic is wonderful. 
 whoever said logic takes you places you don't want to go was full of shit. 
 logic is a great tool that makes everything have a meaningless meaning.  i
 fuck myself daily with logic and smile.

 dear mogel,
         
        i think i have taken a lethal dose of dto.  i called up the posion
 control center and ask 'what should i do?  i think i had too much dto.'
 they told me to read the label, but i couldn't find one.  then they said to
 call the manufacturer, and i told them i didn't have his number.  they
 couldn't help.  isn't this drug approved by the food & drug administraion?
 that's exactly what it is, a drug.  i want more and more but there is only a
 limited supply.  can you help?  i search out 0-day all day long.  when i am
 not looking for 0-day i have this urge for pork products and little candies.
 i tried to substitute dto with other t-files, but i am overwhelmed with
 naseau and vomit.  nothing compares to dto.  i want more.  i need more.
 tell me how i may help my problem!

        often revolve around stupid people and how they react in today's

        technology, the media, and of course the inpho-sewper-dewper-highway.
        im2k's favorite past time is finding very stupid high school girls

        "biff!  quick - get on aol!  we need to surf the net!"

        "yeah!  we're _cyberpunks_!"

        <sigh>

        i've arrived upon the conclusion recently that everything that was
 golden and wonderful in the past of the internet is basically lost forever.
 i suppose i'm a pretty stubborn guy, but i had this dwindling hope that
 somehow the "stupid" of the internet would just be ignored.  unfortuntly,
 as more and more people jump onto the "information i-want-my-mtv-freeway"
 cyberspaceical nonsense, i feel it's utterly hopeless at this point.

        bandwidth hurts.  it weems!  eventually prodigy and aol and a
 thousand other slave services will have full internet access.  it's really
 only a matter of time.  things can only get worse.

        "what exactly is the problem?"  many people ask.  the problem is that
 the internet's foundation was based on the exchange of "valued" information
 and communication.  now the word i used there, "valued," i suppose might
 lead the clever devil's advocate to point out the subjective nature of the
 word.  i suppose you're right.  what is defined as "important" and not is
 quite hard to define.  however, i think there comes a point where the
 obvious nature of stupidity comes in.  there must be some slap-in-the-face
 truth.
 
        i guess that the internet's current direction of massive
 commercialisation and political attention can only increase almost
 exponentially.  very soon it's estimated that 10% of america will have an
 internet e-mail address _at least_.  that means _one out of ten people_ 
 in this entire country can be reached by computer.
 
        is this good or is this bad?  it's again, multi-sided issue.  it _is_
 a good thing that technology is going to be linking everyone in the world
 together ultimately (well, anyone that can get to a computer.  i seriously
 doubt i'm going to engange in any philiosophical discussions from a starving
 ethiopian any time soon).  however, taking in everyone in the world
 basically means taking in people all the way from rocket scientists to
 the fuctionally moronic.  and, sadly, this destroys the very fabric of what
 the internet was meant to be.
 
        i remember a time when i could get on usenet and read hundreds of
 grand messages filled with insightful conversation and debate (okay, well,
 *many* of the newsgroups were at least..heh).  now i can't even stand to
 read them at all anymore.  every time i get on, i see more and more posts
 consisting of:

        ultimatly, the people that _are_ doing something productive and
 meaningful on the internet will be pushed out.

        especially with such stupid, lame things coming into popularity, like
 iphone.  jesus.
 
        "it's just like irc except there's voices."
        
        do we really need _another_ irc?  irc is already the epidome of
 stupid.
 
 *slick* r u female?
 *milt0n* got the squeaky 800#?
 *janes* lamer!
 *pinkman* you're in #hack? how do you hack prodigy???!

        do people really make these things for the purpose of entertaining
 bored little computer geek kids?  please tell me no.  if it's a yes, then
 shoot me now.

        and of course, we come to the big mother of glowing mass-appeal - the
 world wide web.  someone find me my prosac.  quick!

        the world wide web is what really becons the people.  it gathers the
 most attention.  "mosaic" (with it's little globe for that oh-so-cyberspace
 affect), "netscape", and other web browsers (prodigy, aol, and other slave
 services have versions, too!  joy!) give people a typical wind0ze
 "point-and-click" visual "user-friendly" fighting chance at boucing around
 visually through the www.  i suppose the visual vs. text based debate
 has been a constant for quite a white in the computer world, however, as
 people like bill gate's scramble to make even _more_ money, i can only see
 much more of this.

        the problem with the world wide web is that's it's ultimatly a big,
 slow waste.  it attracts the same basic simple-minded crowd that aol and
 prodigy does in essense.  there are exceptions, but i've heard the
 expression "well guys, i'm off to surf the net!" one to many times to take
 this lightly.  user friendly is _not_ good if it's limited, and most of the
 time, that's what the case is.  www included.

        and just take a look at the www.  what is it really?  every joe-bob
 moron loser get's a chance to set up infinate homepages till the cow's come
 home.  "come visit my home page, man!"  gee, i can't want to see a thousand
 _more_ stupid large gifs and redundant links to yet another web page full of
 a thousand redundant more "kewl links" that go back to the same 15 pages.
 ya gotta love it.  may the force be with you, future html writers.
 
        let's just also make this clear - you can do whatever you want on the
 internet _without_ the www.  ever hear of gopher?
 
        "but i like pretty pictures!"

        i ache.  ultimately, in the end you realize that all this is going to
 happen anyway, so you just lose hope.  the internet hype will explode a
 jillion times more than it is today, even more people will hop on "the net."
 we'll see a whole slew of commercialisation, legal battles, and media
 stories.  we can only pray that ultimatly, after all this change has taken
 place that will happen over the next ten years and onward, that the internet
 will still be relativly "free."  i imagine i'll still be along for the ride,
 as depressing as it is.

        i was paging through the latest issue of wired the other day.  as i
 did, it seemed if something was coming to me.  the ads were becoming more
 asinine as the page-flipping continued.  the bright mtv-ish style of print
 was getting to be a little annoying.  then it came.

        "adults are just big, stupid children."

        well, anyway, back to page flipping through this *ahem* magazine.

        if you ever feel like flushing 5 bucks down the toilet, contact the
 people at wired.com and they'll make sure that you do it in the ugliest
 possible way.  if they have something to say, can they just write it?  no.
 let's make it bright orange on a blue gradient background.  then, cover it
 with little netscape icons and put an irrelevant little quote on it.
 preferably by some scientist/surfer/philosopher who is also a cyber-jock.

                        + the helsinki killer ball +

        when finnish sculptor markus copper was a child, he enjoyed playing
 videogames and watching movies like blade runner and alien.  now, at 26,
 he's making his own monsters.  copper's most terrifying kinetic sculpture is
 juggernaut, an enormous steel ball that weighs as much as two cars.  it has
 a motor, motion sensors, a juicy battery, and the mind of a psycho killer.
 ### ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ kind of like the republican
 ###                                              party.
 it hunts you.  if you don't jump aside, you'll be trampled under it. and it
 won't stop until the battery is dead.
 ### ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ it _is_ the republican party!

        copper says he's not concerned about injuring people.  accidents can
 happen, but folks know what they're about to face.  juggernaut is stored
 behind a steel fence in helsinki, and anybody who wants to play with the
 killer ball must unleash it first.  the message is obvious: this experience
 might just take your life.          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ howbout: everybody! let's play with the steel ball of death!

        copper's next project?  "bombs.  i want to make bombs."

 idiotic, yet curiously interesting enough to read.

        when the business world began to take notice of the internet and
 communications technology, it seemed as if a horrible revolution had begun.
 this revolution promised sales and markets at a stunning rate; something
 that the regular media could no longer provide.  soon after, internet
 services grew around the country, bringing all of this bit-stream world to
 our backdoor.

        then marketing came into play.

        people began to realize the potential of the net as an advertising
 media.  every small company with time to spare set up a homepage on the web.
 corporations began to investigate the inet in attempts to keep up with the
 times.  eventually, a media niche occurred and investors saw dollar signs;
 "wired" was born.  the computer world did a purple-on-green shudder.

        wired was something of a techno-culture phenomenon.  it presented
 itself to readers as the definitive product of the internet sub-culture.  it
 tried to educate others as to what direction our little world was heading.
 it brought to the world bright pictures of techno-innovation.  it attempted
 to draw pictures of internet cultures for the rest of the world.  but in
 doing so, it had ignored one of the real purposes of the internet and
 corrupted itself in the process.

        wired attempted to bring old-school thinking into new-world
 applications. it brought the capitalistic ways of subscriptions and
 promotions to a new realm of possibilities.  this bastardized form contained
 the news of the net, accompanied by marketing for official "wired" gear, a
 pay-per-play music preview system, and literally thousands of ads.  this
 magazine is now the perfect picture of hypocrisy: it sells you information
 from the internet; a network that is practically designed around the freedom
 of information.

        in a move to capture new yuppie-users, the 'zine has decided to go
 mainstream and leave the techno-nerds behind.  subscribers who had
 previously ignored the magazines information marketing for the issues it
 addressed were slowly alienated by the newer target audience.  wired, with
 every passing issue, became less and less 'cutting-edge cyber-culture' and
 more and more 'mr. smith gets aol.'  this corruption became unforgivable as
 this move invaded every section in the magazine.  "jargon watch" no longer
 was purely "net"; it now included industries that weren't even within the
 realm of internet.  articles became little more than staff-written ads for
 products.  "street cred" was, itself, no longer credible.  everyone within
 the mag helped to promote the idea of 'conservative-business-techno-chic.'

        somewhere in the background, what the adults had labled 
 'techno-geeks' were laughing quietly.  middle-age men who would not know 
 linux from doom ii danced across the pages; each presenting himself as 
 'cyber-cool.'

        this whole "hey-everybody-i'm-trendy-cuz-i-surf-the-net" craze
 appears to be an idea concocted by a story-hungry media.  this modem-powered
 bandwagon has taken off in ways that even ms-bill ("i'm everywhere!") could
 never have imagined. every soundbyte and feature clip on computers was
 pulled from file.  local computer experts are featured constantly on the
 evening news:

        "is _your_ computer hacker safe?"

        "how to protect your children from perversion on the internet."

        "how to make sure you don't actually have to watch your own kids and
 still be able to let the computer do it for you."

        (okay, okay, i made that one up, but it fits the idea.)

        my point is this:

        our precious little world is changing.  it is being changed by
 parents who cannot begin to comprehend the world of the internet.  it is
 being changed by congressmen who want to satisfy angry legislation-happy
 constituents.  it is being changed by politicians like big booby dole, who
 don't even have experience with the things they want to constrict and bind
 with law.  it is being changed by magazines like wired, who try to apply
 their greed to the internet.  it is being mainstreamed; it is being boxed,
 shipped, advertised and sold.

        we cannot feed the hypocrisy of magazines like wired.  they preach
 the rights and freedom of the internet, and out of the other side of their
 mouth, they help to build the very concepts that take away those rights.
 they claim to support the freedom of information and speech, but they
 promote family activities within the net; an area not meant for the
 babysitting of small children. they have become the ultimate symbol of the
 90's computer industry:  a view of both sides of an issue, favoring the
 oppressed _and_ the oppressor.

  + why lollapalooza sucks
  + submitted by - fake scorpion

        i don't know exactly why i'm writing this, considering a few of my
 favorite musicians are going to be at this year's lollapalooza.  i'm a bit
 saddened by them giving into this institution of mtv, but hey... if i was
 offered a couple million, i'm sure i'd do it too.

        actually, lollapalooza does present a day of fun.  i went last year,
 and i'll be going this year as well.  so what's so bad about it?  to put it 
 bluntly, the people.  lollapalooza = fashionable/trendy to most of the mtv 
 generation.

        the reasons i attend lollapalooza differ from many other's reasons
 for going.  and anyone who differs from me is a prick, right?  i'm sure 
 that's how i'm coming across, but i do have a point, just listen.
 
        before school ended this year, a couple of people who knew me only as
 "weird" asked if i was going to attend this year's lollapalooza.  i told 
 them i was.  i asked if they were, and they said definitely, they told me 
 that they had already bought tickets.  i was cool with that until they asked 
 me who was going to be playing.  they didn't have a clue.

        i go to these festivals because of the bands, not because it's the
 cool thing to do.  most of the people that attend lollapalooza are just
 there because it's fashionable.  they are there to buy the t-shirts to brag 
 to all their friends about being at the cool event of the summer.

        i heard that the first lollapalooza wasn't like that.  it figures
 though... people are afraid to try anything that isn't accepted by everyone 
 else.  i dislike not lollapalooza, but what it stands for.  i don't really 
 blame perry farrell for this, i blame god, err whoops i mean mtv.  
 lollapalooza has become an institution of the majority.
