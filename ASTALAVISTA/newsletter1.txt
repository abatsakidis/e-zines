[ SERIOUS SECURITY FLAW IN CISCO'S NETWORK SOFTWARE ]

Cisco Systems Inc. has announced that they have found a serious Security
Flaw in their Network Software, that could literally disable any of the
devices running their Interwork Operation System software.The devices could
be forced to stop processing(routing) any traffic by the time a complete
restart is done.

More information on the problem can be found at:

http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,1196606,00.asp
http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1105_2-1026518.html
http://www.ecommercetimes.com/perl/story/31142.html
http://biz.yahoo.com/djus/030718/1313000600_1.html

Astalavista's Comments:

Most of the Internet traffic worldwide is handled by Cisco's Networking
Products, so you can imagine the effects of this flaw if it's not properly
taken care of.Cisco has released a free software upgrade that fixes the 
flaw, but, as always, it's up to the Administrators to take care of their
network before someone else does so.Cisco Systems Inc. has released a
Security Advisory where you can also find information on how to obtain the
free software upgrade.Locate the Advisory here:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20030717-blocked.shtml

[ ZONEALARM FACES A SERIOUS SECURITY FLAW IN ITS FREEWARE VERSION ]

ZoneAlarm is believed to be the world's most popular firewall for home pcs
and in spite of the many other freeware firewalls on the market, it's still the 
most preferred one.However, a recent post on the Bugtraq's Mailing List
indicates a serious flaw in the firewall's core design and the way the
Windows OS operates which results in millions of affected users.

The actual BugTraq's post can be found here:

http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/326371

Further information on the news can be located at:

http://www.spywareinfo.com/articles/zonelabs/exploit_hoax.php 

Astalavista's Comments:

Indeed, ZoneAlarm is used by millions of Windows users worldwide so you can
imagine the scale of the impact for all of them.ZoneAlarm's Executives 
blame the Windows OS for the flaw and said that the problem is not in the
way their firewall operates.The steps taken by the Executives can be 
defined as a highly inappropriate marketing strategy which could lead to the 
loss of thousands of ZoneAlarm users as everyone hates to be forced
in order to purchase a product.You have the right the choose your personal
firewall instead of being forced to use one by the industry, so visit the
following URL and learn more about various personal firewalls:

[ THE DEFACEMENT CHALLENGE ]

Defacers and Defacements groups have organized a "Defacement Contest" where
the main goal was to deface as many web sites as possible within six hours.
After they have released the info to the public, there has been enormous
scan attempts for known vulnerabilities worldwide.

The Contest's Official Site can be found here:

http://www.defacers-challenge.com/

http://www.vnunet.com/News/1142169

Astalavista's Comments:

A Defacement Contest?! I am amazed by the number of people who still deface
web sites, erase sensitive data and cause damage, and what's left when
they are all united.Conducting a basic psychological profile of the whole
"contest" and the individuals involved, you will see a large number of guys
who are up to running exploits and defacing web sites only, a group of
people who monitor the Security Scene, challenges, seminars, contests, organized by
the real experts, and want to contribute with
what they can - defacing web sites and scanning for known vulnerabilities.
They just want to be a part of something, to be accepted by the community 
which is OK, but if they are spending their time and resources on other
much more productive and useful activities.I wonder what's next, maybe a
"Mass Trojans Infection Challenge" ?! 

[ THE FUTURE OF TAI UNDER QUESTION ]

The Terrorism Information Awareness Program is facing funds problems due to
Senators who have proposed eliminating all money for the Pentagon's program
on creating a computerized terrorism surveillance program.

TAI's Official Web Site can be found here:

Astalavista's Comment:

Is BigBrother really going to stop watching us?! I don't think so! And I'm
sure that those who are into conspiracies might even define this as
an attempt to take the public attention away from the actual progress on
the project.And even in case that the project is shut down, the Pentagon
will come up with another, less expensive, even more productive solution,
on how to monitor the citizens and potential terrorist activities.

[ GOVERNMENT TAKES SERIOUS MEASURES TO PROTECT CUSTOMER'S DATA ]

The United States Federal Trade Commission has decided to take serious 
measures and to pursue companies that promise increased security in order
to obtain personal information, but not to deliver it.

You can find more information on this issue at the following URL:

http://www.securityfocus.com/columnists/171

Astalavista's Comment:

The average Internet user doesn't think twice before giving away personal
information when asked for such and it's probably because of the lack of
understanding on how is this information later used, how insecure it is
stored etc.FTC's effort on this issue should be highlighted though it's
the company's/organization's responsibility to provide the users with a
a high level of security, if they want to succeed in the electronic 
marketplace.

04. Free Security Consultation
   --------------------------

Did you ever have a Security related question but weren't sure where to 
direct it to? This is what the "Free Security Consultation" section was created for.
Due to the high number of Security concerning e-mails we keep getting on a
daily basis, we have decided to start a free of charge service and offer
it to our subscribers.Whenever you have a Security related question you are
advised to direct it to us and within several days you will receive a qualified
response from one of our Security experts.The ones we consider as the most
interesting and useful for everyone we'll publish at the Newsletter.
Neither your e-mail, nor your name will be mentioned anywhere.

Direct all of your Security questions to security [at] frame4.com

Below are this month's questions, thank you very much for your interest!

---------
Question: Hello! I used to surf the net using a dial-up connection, but
I've recently got hold of an ADSL one.I think that being online all the time increases
the chance of getting hacked and this is my biggest concern about
this kind of connection.For my protection I use Norton Anti-Virus and my
favorite firewall is ZoneAlarm.I believe I'm quite an experienced at using
this firewall though I believe there's still a lot to learn.My question is,
can you provide me with more info on how to securely configure it;are there
any online security tests where I can see is it really that effective as I
think it is? Thanks a lot for your time, keep up the good work Astalavista!

-------
Answer: Indeed, your ADSL represents threat not only to the personal/sensitive
data you hold, but to the whole world as well.That's why it should be properly
protected even before connecting it to the Internet.Having an Anti-Virus
scanner and a personal firewall increases your level of Security though these
measures could be absolutely pointless in case that you are not behaving
securely while using the Internet.Concerning your ZoneAlarm question, I would
advise you to take a look at the following paper:

http://www.myonlinesecurity.com/articles/20020514_001.htm

And here's a list of online Security tests, where you can evaluate your 
current level of Security, but keep in mind that these tests are not always
accurate meaning they can't provide you with a complete answer to your
question.

I hope we've helped you in some way, if you have any other questions do not
hesitate to contact us at security [at] frame4.com

---------
Question: Congratulations on your portal!I've started using it every day
and I must say that I'm impressed by its comprehensive content.Although
I'm sure you're getting thousands of e-mails daily, mostly about submissions,
I have a question and I don't know where to ask for the answer, so I've decided
to mail it to you with the hope that you'll be able to reply.Thanks a lot!

A couple of months ago the company I work for enforced E-mail Security
Policy on all levels of the organization.My concern is that my e-mail is
being read and the sites I visit are monitored which is something I define
as personal information as I believe I can distinguish user-friendly from
possibly dangerous web site.How do I protect my personal information and
the confidentiality of my e-mail correspondence?

-------
Answer: Thanks for your comments, we really appreciate getting such kind
words concerning the work we've done, and be sure there will be many more 
new features on Astalavista in the next couple of months, that's for sure!

Security Policies are needed in order to improve the Security within the
organization and you're advised to follow them.On your e-mail monitoring
concern, get hold of PGP and start encrypting your correspondence, a process
that will protect your e-mails for sure.On the web site's monitoring
it would be best to talk with someone from the ITSecurity department in order
to get more information on how and why web visits are monitored, they should
provide you with this info without any problems.

Get PGP at:

http://www.pgpi.org/

---------
Question: Hi folks! Though the file I've submitted wasn't written by me,
I hope I helped the visitors of your site as the paper is really good!
I have a question regarding linux security and it would be great if you
have the time and mail me back with a small response.I've always been a
Windows user but now I'm turning to Linux.It's a completely new OS to me
and I'm still learning its basics though I believe I'm progressing pretty
fast.I would like to know more about linux security, how to protect my computer
configure firewall etc. as my ADSL connection was often targeted by hackers
when I was using Windows and I don't even have a firewall on my linux at
the moment.Thanks a lot!

-------
Answer: The paper is truly excellent, thanks a lot for submitting it!
As you are new to Linux but have an ADSL connection and not a clue about
Linux Security, I would advise you to learn more about the OS's Security
before connecting it to the Internet, otherwise you're exposing all of your
sensitive data, while on the other hand your connection and computer could
be used to commit further illegal activities.When you have at least
the basic Security measures in place, then you can connect to the Internet
and start playing around with the other Security issues discussed in the papers
I'm going to recommend you.

receives a qualified response from one of our experts but keep in mind that
we get thousands of e-mails daily and be patient.

05. Enterprise Security Issues
   --------------------------

In today's world of high speed communications, of companies completely
relying on the Internet to make business and increase productivity, we've
decided that there should be a special section for corporate security where

06. Home Users Security Issues
   --------------------------

Due to the high number of e-mails we keep getting from novice users, we've
decided that it would be a very good idea to provide those with their very
special section discussing various aspects of Information Security in a 
non-technical way, while on the other hand increase their current knowledge
level.Enjoy yourself!

- Tips For Protecting Your Home PC -

Hundreds of new users connect to the Internet every day.Most of these are
not only new to the Internet but to general Security concepts as well.The
only measure they've heard about for protection against hackers is the 
anti-virus scanner and the personal firewall.The idea of this article is to
recommend various Security strategies for their Home PC's.

01.Physical Security is an issue that you should take very seriously if you want
to limit or eliminate possible local security problems.Set up a reasonable
BIOS password and have your screensaver password protected.

02.Having an Anti-Virus software would be a wise idea as well, though you 
should limit the downloads from untrusted and potentially dangerous web
sites to the minumum.Make sure you update the software at least twice per
month and scan every file before you run it.

03.Always use the latest version of your software, visit the vendor's web site
and check for regular updates as new security bugs appear very often.

04.Install a decent firewall and learn how it works in order to modify and get
the maximum out of it.Remember that firewalls are not a complete solution to
your security though they are very useful.Browse through various firewall
products and choose the one that perfectly fits your needs.

http://www.firewallguide.com/software.htm

05.When you're away from the computer and have no Internet related background
programs running, you're advised to physically disconnect your modem from the
computer.

06.Backup! Do backup your sensitive data so in case a security problem
appears and somehow damages the data, you'll be still able to use it after
a clean reinstall of the system is done.

07.Encrypt your e-mails and your important data, so in case of an intrusion
the attacker won't be able to get hold of this information.
Locate PGP at http://www.pgpi.org/

08.Pay additional attention as far as any chat applications are concerned.
These are often the source of malicious code(viruses/trojans/worms)infection.

09.Whenever your e-mail has a secure log in(SSL)option, take advantage of it
as it will limit the chance of someone sniffing your accounting data(login+password).

10.When reading e-mails, disable ActiveX, Java etc. a good idea would be to
"Go Offline" while reading any messages so that a malicious program won't be
able to get autostarted.

07. Meet the Security Scene
   -----------------------

In this section you are going to meet famous people, security experts and
all the folks who contribute to the growth of the community in some way.
We hope that you'll enjoy these interviews and that you'll learn a lot of
interesting information through this section.In this issue we've interviewed
Proge from progenic.com a site I'm sure you're all aware of.

----------------------------------------
Interview with Proge, Founder of Progenic
http://www.progenic.com/

Astalavista: To those who still don't know of Progenic.com, give us a brief
introduction of the whole idea and its history?

Proge: Basically it all started in back in 98, we just made software for
the fun of it and stuck it up on a webpage, mostly pretty simple stuff.It
was a fun time but as the scene grew, things got a little out of hand, and
when FakeSurf (the first automated surfing tool) was released we had legal
threats from Alladvantage, lost our sponsorship that was paying for the
bandwidth and were flooded with people wanting nothing more than a quick
buck.I think that's when everyone decided enough was enough, and we took
the site behind closed doors, I left the toplist up on Progenic.com because
it's a scene I came from and I don't want to see it die.At the moment I'm
working on more constructive things like DownSeek.com, it's more satisfying to
create something that helps people.

Astalavista: As being on the Scene for such a long time, what is your 
opinion on today's Security threats, home and corporate users face every
day?

Proge: There are usually two reasons why you become a target, automated
software scanning your system for known exploits that you should have 
patched, or you've made yourself a target.If someone wants to break into
your system then unless you have a dedication to security, that window
between an exploit and a patch is going to get you.Even if you stay on top
of things, it can still be a battle.
According to Microsoft 'the only truly secure computer is the one buried
in concrete, with the power turned off and the network cable cut' and you
probably run their operating system.

Astalavista: Is Security through Education the perfect model for any 
organization?

Proge: Definitely!I'm still amazed that there are programmers and sys-amins
out there, who think functionality first, security second or not at all.You
need to understand hacking to understand Security, you know the reasons why
you lock your door at night, why you set an alarm, but do you know why you
have a firewall or an intrusion detection system, or did it just sound like
a good idea when you got a glossy leaflet warning you about 'hackers' and
asking your money? You can't just install a product and forget about
Security, but that's what the industry tries to sell.Security is a constant
threat and it isn't game over until you lose.

Astalavista: How real you think is the threat of CyberTerrorism?

Proge: With people like we have in power it gets more real.Like I said,
if you make yourself a target, you've got a problem.

Astalavista: Is BigBrother really watching us, and what's the actual
meaning of the word 'privacy' nowadays ?

Proge: A good question, they're definitely watching us but to what degree,
who knows.It doesn't hurt to have a healthy paranoia.
There're two sides to the privacy argument really.Either you're worried
that government/business is overstepping the mark and intruding on your
personal life for their own benefit, or you've got something to hide.
Unfortunately privacy is being marketed at those with something to hide,
you've seen the ads, cheating on your wife? Grooming underage kids? Erase
your history, don't get caught etc.It's ironic that there are more ethics
in a scene that is largely banded a threat to Security than there are in
government and business.

Astalavista: Thanks for your time, Proge.

Proge: You're welcome!
