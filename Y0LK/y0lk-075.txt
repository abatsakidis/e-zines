> "The clumsy postman invades woodlawn"
> by James Hetfield [dt0, doodz!]

	It was the elite of times, it was the lame of times.  It was
a time of great couriering, it was a time of great stagnency.  It was
a time of multi-colored blocks; it was a time of LCD monitors.  It was
woodlawn; slinkyland.  
	The population of the town of slinkyland was approx. 7.  All the
local citizens, therefore, noticed any strangers in woodlawn; slinkyville.  
And on this day, friday december the 34th, there certainly was a stranger 
in woodlawn; slinkyville.  there was also some custard, but perhaps that 
wasn't so important.  in fact, it's not really important at all.
	"I am clumsy postman and everyone will feel my wrath as i use
my trip technique on you!" he roared as he entered the small town of
woodlawn; slinkyville.
	belial, a local patron, heard his battle cry and quickly ran
to his next door neighbor's, cerkit, to tell him about the dangerous
monstrosity.  of course, to call belial a local patron is kind of goofy,
but that's quite all right.  
	"do0d this is like bad." cerkit said, after taking a few more
hits to cope with the situation.  cerkit would one day learn to lay off
those louisville sluggers.
	"we've got to stop him!  metalchic is our only hope!" belial 
whined, as he ready the chic-signal.
	a very large picture of an iron lurked above the clouds of
woodlawn; slinkyville.  The patrons now knew something was wrong.  it was 
probably the overflowing toilet in the local monastery where belial and 
cerkit occassionally played monk, but it could have been something else.
	"don't worry, woodlawn; slinkyville!  I'll be right there!" 
metalchic said to herself as she saw the signal in the clouds.  she had to 
put on her hero-outfit first, which was basically just a rush t-shirt and
some jeans.

* * *

	life is pathetic.  gimme a break.  there are NO heroes. how
many times do I have to tell you people this?  so what.  so what if
someone is stronger, or smarter, or what not.  they won't get any farther
into the ground when they die then you will.  hey, clyclone rangers, listen
up.  for this story is about all of us.  this isn't just a silly tidbit from
a fictional writer.  no.  this is real, babycakes.

* * *

	"metalchic, eh?  well, taste the fury of the air mail!" clumsy
postal man said, as he whipped his shrueken-sharp letters at metalchic.
	"aHa! i am made of metal! you cannot harm me with your petty
attacks!" metalchic retorted, letters clanking off her torso.
	"surely then you shall phear the snail mail delay blast!" clumsy
postman cried, as he shot a bolt of power at metalchic, freezing her in
time.  lucky time@!#
	"nonONONONOnNLnOnONNO now how will i get my new issues of slinky?!"
metalchic whined, not able to move a muscle.  

* * *

	i know what you're thinking, if she couldn't move a muscle, how
could she whine?  well, shut up, jackass.

* * *
	
	"mohahahaha! i owns your codes now, metalchic!" clumsy postman
maniacially laughed as he turned for his next targets, the patrons of
woodlawn; slinkyville.

* * * 

	picture yourself in a field.  picture yourself letting your hair
down in that field, feeling a light breeze across your face in that field.
picture yourself leaning slightly on someone you love, as a breeze lightly
touches your cheeck in that field.  picture yourself eating a nice pack
of gourmet pez[tm] while you lean slightly on someone you love as a light
breeze kisses you on the cheeck in a beautiful field.  Picture yourself
breaking the heart of your girlfriend as you lean slightly on someone you
love as a light breeze touches you lightly on the cheeck in that field.
but first, picture yourself getting shot in the stomach because your 
girlfriend was alanis moresette as you lean slightly on someone you love
as a light breeze fucks your ear in that beautiful field.  picture yourself
getting someone you love pregnant and having flipper babies because you
have no more prostate glands because your girlfriend who was alanis 
moresette kicked you too hard in the nuts after a light breeze fucked your
ear so hard it blew our your eardrum in a beautiful field.

* * *

	"now it is your turn, cerkit!  feel the wrath of PRIORITY MAIL!"
clumsy postal man said, whipping out his prized package.
	Unfortunately, clumsy postman tripped on his shoelaces and impaled
himself on that priority letter, bringing this story to an unexpected close.
sorry, batman. 
	however, the end was not quite there.  something still gloomed over
the story like a dark cloud, not enabling the story to reach it's expected
end.  was it the relationships between the characters?  was it the lack of
inside jokes?  was it mogel looming over the keyboard?  or was it that we
hadn't yet added a section of pip-bashing.  yeah!  that's it!

* * *

	i was somewhere between heaven and hell when i realized the meaning of
why all us scumsucking bags of flesh parade around the earth.  but that's not
important now.  what _is_ important is the fact that your mom is one tubby,
fat peice of shit.  yeah, that's right, i'm talking to YOU.  shut the hell up
already.  talk, talk, talk.  you just flap and flap and flap your lips like a
fuckin' humming bird, but i know the deal.
	there's nothing in the world like peeing against the wind.

* * *

	pip arrived on the scene.
	"i'm an idiot," he muttered and felt a kick.
	"ok!  ok!  i'm a BIG idiot!" he retorted.
	all was peaceful.  until...

* * *

	isn't it ironic?  don't you think?

* * *

	"hey," said belial, "we forgot about metalchic!"
	yes, they had forgotten about metalchic, still frozen in time.
	"we should help her!" said pip.
	"i guess so," said cerkit, so they sat and discussed what to do.
	then they realized that metalchic was an attractive young lady and
whoever saved her first she would probably be indebted to. 
	"oh, i just remembered this can of gasoline," said cerkit.  cerkit
threw the gasoline on metalchic, freeing her from space-time.  however, she
was covered with gasoline, so she didn't feel indebted to cerkit, but just
hugged him.

* * *

	it's like raaaaiiiiin, on your wedding day...

* * *

	"i'm going to go start a new 'zine now," said pip.
	and all was happy in woodlawn; slinkyville.

--(note)--------------------------------------------------------------------
