(-------(y0lk number forty-two)---------------------------------------------)

  i'd just like to clear up a few things first (after reading dto number six)

  [a] y0lk releases, oh, about every week. (if that)
  [b] y0lk does suck.
  [c] dto is fucking awesome.

  just thought i'd like to clear that up. i've never really read any dto's
until about a week ago. i read them all in one night, and god, they were
fucking awesome.

  highlights: that cheeze dude's 'in the ghetto' story
              eerie's editorials
              that leeza talk show episode

  those are the best dto moments, no question about it.

(-------(fidonet)-----------------------------------------------------------)

  does anybody out there read fidonet? you should. it can be, sometimes, very
amusing. i read the bbs_carnival echo quite often (bbs software discussion).
there are basically two things discussed.

  [1] telegard vs. renegade
  [2] why 3l1t3 H4qU0RZ SuQ@!

  it gets sickening. i never realized how stupid people that had never really
been exposed to any scene besides the pd scene were about everything outside
of it. the people are so fucking ignorant.

  'anybody that is running obv/2 is a fucking elite dork.'

  i couldn't believe it!@ obv/2 is a COMMERCIAL PRODUCT, and the people think
that because lots of art boards run it, it's only for elite people. however,
they have no argument for why so many elite boards run pcboard.

  grr.. idiots.

(-------(internet)----------------------------------------------------------)

  i recently got an internet hookup to my board (so to speak). it is
obviously not full internet, nor a direct connection, but nonetheless, it is
still very cool.

  what it is: unlimited newsgroups, and user@erebus.magsystems.com internet
email address's for all the users on my board.

  why this is cool: newsgroups are really cool. i love alt.ascii-art (i think
that's what it's called..) and alt.fan.howard.stern. there are thousands of
newsgroups that you can request. very cool. it's also cool because you can
have, hypothetically, as many internet email address's as you want.. i can
just make a new user on my board, say DOODIE-HEAD. if somebody sends internet
email to DOODIE-HEAD@erebus.magsystems.com, it goes into his mailbox. i think
it's pretty cool to be able to make an 'internet address' whenever you want
(not that i do..). heh. it's also cool because the email is FAST.

  well, enough about the internet. btw, if you want any more info on this,
send email to hooch@erebus.magsystems.com.. ;>

(-------(windows)-----------------------------------------------------------)

  grr. i tried to install win95 on my server last week, and it didn't work.
grrr!! i got lantastic working, but for some fucking reason, the chipset that
was shipped with the dell p90's when i got them is slightly incompatible with
win95. what does that mean, you might ask? well, it means, basically, that
a modem will not work properly under dos applications under win95. that means
- you guessed it - my mailer won't initialize, and neither will terminate.

  ugh!! i wanna play games!@@#

  oh well, warp is stable. and i like it, too. i just got object desktop for
it, hopefully that will be cool. but i still wanna play games. <sniff, sniff>

(-------(y0lknet)-----------------------------------------------------------)

misfit's board "pOo!@" is in it, as is mindcrime's "alderAAn" and belial's
