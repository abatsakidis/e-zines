              y0lk #99: the badness steps out and takes a solo

---(y0lk)---------------------------------------------------------------------
the y0lk executive intro - phorce
---(y0lk)---------------------------------------------------------------------

         welcome to y0lk, issue number 99!@  i'm your host, phorce.

         y0lk, as you might have noticed, has recently celebrated its one-year
 anniversary (7/27) AND is nearing its one hundredth issue.  both of these
 being quite large accomplishments, we'd like to celebrate the style y0lk
 upheld in those first great 100 issues which i'm sure you've all read.

         see, with the advent of this y0lk's new century, we hope to make
 everything much more "quality" here at y0lk.  away with the "bad writing"
 we've been charactized by recently.  as the new era approaches, the evils
 of the previous era must be cleansed before we can continue.

         so, since mogel grabbed control of y0lk #100 (grrr), y0lk #99 was
 chosen to be the final resting place for all this bad stuff i've had sitting
 around in my submissions directory for so long.  this issue is the last you
 will see of badness in y0lk.  badness, but in a good sense of the word, that
 is.  there's a certain "dada-ness" in all this badness.

         who can forget the finesse of big hurt's "big hurt is ruler of the
 earth!"  do you still remember "fuck your tv"  and "eye yam stain?"  how
 about hooch's constant references to doing things to one's anus?  all of
 these, great classics they were - surely to be remembered and revered in the
 future as the greatest works of literature ever written.  in the great words
 of jesus, that son of god, himself:

         "the kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in
 three measures of flour, till it was all leavened."
                                                 -- matthew 13.33

         y0lk is that leaven; hidden from most, obscure in the great measures
 of flour that try to oppress us, but still winning out over them all, to
 expand and become a great, godly thing, almost as great as that big valhalla
 in the sky.

         yes, dear friends - y0lkliness is next to godliness.

         with all that said and done, here's what's planned for you tonight.
 we've pulled out all the stops for ya.  we've got some choice big hurt
 material, some writing by the younger siblings of zinesters, and a surprise
 guest or two!@  you'll love it, believe me.

         now on with the y0lk.

 .y0lk. [ who is big hurt? ] .xXx.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  well of course ya know that i'm big hurt by now. anyhow. i've been around
  the art scene for awhile now. i've been in many of grOups, such as vor,
  cia, fire, etc. and now i'm in ink and a lit grOup called spin. i'm also
  running my own emag, called blOtch, which is a production of ink.

  i've done ascii, ansi, and now i've decided to write. had my own 'zine
  called turb0 until it died and become an emag, blOtch.  i was in
  thrust, before the merge of thrust and apathy and was never included into
  the merge, along with many of other ex-thrust membas.

  i've also tried doin music and sum of it hasnt turned out all so bad. who
  knows where i will go.

 .y0lk. [ lub it, like it, have it ] .xXx.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  yum. lets all have sum spam. ya can use it in a thousand different ways. it
  is so eReet. ya can cook it, nuke it, smell it, grill it and put it on sum
  buns and have a spamburger.

  what would we do wit out spam. would the world as we know it, no longer go
  on, cuz we dont have that delicious and tasty thing called spam.


--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 .y0lk. [ the world ] .xXx.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  yes, the world would go on. the world doesnt rotate around spam, it rotates
  around the great one. which is big hurt, the mentor, the boss, the great.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 .y0lk. [ i'm elite ] .xXx.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  too think that i'm writting fer y0lk, the best 'zine out there. so i must be
  the most elite person on the face of this earth. well maybe not the most
  elite, i ferget trip of apathy.blah.blah.etc and creed cum before me.

  arent zines so great.

  anyway, i think i'm gonna do a run down on some zines that i've
  picked up on `the net' and all of the `boards'. here i go, i
  guess.

  we've got slinky. which is ran by that funky guy named belial. dont
  know how to pronouse it, cuz i'm kinda dumb, stupid, or whatever ya
  wanna call it. i got the very very very first ishue of slinky. it
  was kewlio and i give it two thumbs up.

  speaking of rad. i betta whiped that dung off my tennis shoes. and
  we got sum guy that suggested a name to belial and ended up using
  the name fer his own 'zine. that 'zine guy would be mercuri. damn!
  wish i knew how to say that also.

  then we got three guys or sumthang like that, called loOpy, stig,
  and mistawho started a 'zine called dogma. they currently have
  two ishues out, at least when i wrote this article they did.
  these guys are all kewl and there 'zine even shows it.

  wow there is quite a few zines out there and i havent even covered half
  of them. sum arent as elite as y0lk or others out there, but hey ya have
  to give them credit.

i'm here trapped in my house and have no life - big hurt

 broken machine

i've been so busy in the past couple of weeks. school finally ended. too think
i would have fucked around for about a couple weeks before realizing that i
had no life. but, not this summer. 

i have a job. i have baseball. and as soon as school got out, i started my own
little project to stardom. i started a band. sorta of like trent reznor did
nine inch nails. i got sick of my friends. they didn't have any gear to even
get songs going. i didn't need any gear. i had my computer.

so i started right away and started doing songs on my computer. i'm making a 
demo tape as soon as i get a 8-track recording/mixing machine from someone or
somewhere. i've already contacted a few record labels and some are wanting to
hear my stuff. that shows how desperate they are.

my band, broken machine, only has one person right now. that is fine. i like
working by myself. it is how trent reznor started out. he did fine. since he
is a major influence in the music i'm making, maybe it is best that i do 
follow in his footsteps. 

don't get me wrong that i didn't have fun the first weekend that school got
out. because i sure did. my mom is starting to let me stay out later and 
later every night i want to do something. so she is giving me more freedom 
and can trust me. 

and here is the big shocker of the day. i have decided to kill yellow journal.
if someone would like to continue it, then do so, otherwise it is offically
dead. i will putting all of my efforts of writing into y0lk from now on. i may
not be writing that much for y0lk either, but i will try from time to time, 
since i will be busy all of the time this summer with baseball, work, and
with the broken machine project.

a young lad named hat, a sun god, and a big missile - phorce
---(y0lk)---------------------------------------------------------------------

        young hat opened his bedroom window and reveled in the sunshine.  all
was good.  the sun upon his eyes told hat that today was, as usual, another
day; the sun, like him, had decided to get up and make the lives of everyone
he/it would meet a little brighter.

        "the sun has decided to rise today?  this is good," hat remarked to
himself.

        hat felt that great "morning feeling" that he always had around this
time.  beaming (again, much like the sun), hat quickly bathed and dressed.
he pranced down the stairs, singing a song to himself and feeling content in
the knowledge that, in a dozen hours or so, the sun would be replaced with
pale moonlight.

        this seems a normal assumption for most people; the regular cycle of
day to night is more or less a given.  thus, it was not strange that hat would
guess the sun would set and give way to the moon that night.

        unfortunately, hat was wrong.

        ra, the sun god, was mad, and wasn't about to go to sleep angry.

        "WHY HAVE YOU NOT PRAISED ME?" it screamed in rage.  "HAVE I NOT
SHINED BRIGHT FOR YOU, THROUGH THE AGES?  WAS I NOT THE ONE WHO BIRTHED YOU?
AM I NOT THE REASON FOR YOUR EXISTENCE?"

        after hearing ra speak out so loudly (which was very surprising for
most), humankind felt a little guilty and embarassed for not really getting
into the spirit of _praising_ ra for the last few thousand years or so.

        "HAS HUMANKIND FORGOTTON ABOUT ME, RA, THE CREATOR OF LIFE?  I BROUGHT
YOU, FOOLISH MORTALS, OUT OF THE OOZE!  BOW TO ME BEFORE I SEND YOU BACK TO
THE SAME OOZE FROM WHICH YOU CAME!"

        unfortunately for this deity, this "ra" character was quite obviously
a threat to national and global security.  special covert strike teams were
quickly assembled as ra's demands became greater and louder.  the intensity
of ra's annoyance at humanity had become so great that cases of "instant skin
cancer" on very clear and sunny days had been reported.  the pentagon finally
agreed on a plan.

        their plan was as follows:

        fire a large missile at the sun.
        
        hat, looking outside his tinted bedroom window into the permanent
sunshine, could see the large missile silo opening from his bedroom window.
he also could also see the gargantuan missile inside, ready to be fired.

        "that's one big missile," hat remarked to himself.

        hat watched as the missile took off, into the sky.

        ra, too, watched the missile lift off towards him.  ra was, as most
would be if a large missile was rapidly approaching one's self, annoyed.

        ra decided to destroy the foul, ungrateful humans living on the world
it had shined so brightly on.  with one mighty swoop, earth was gone.

        and the last words young hat heard before he was blasted (ironically)
into ash by the same rays that had previously given him life were:

        "EXISTENCE IS FUTILE."

     Okay I'm a bit upset (understandably so, as I'm sure you'll agree). I
didn't get too many entrys to that spontaneous contest I made in the last
issue I wrote (read it over to refresh your memory).  The fact of the matter
is: I got NO entrys. That's right. Zero. YOU COULDN'T EVEN PUT IN ONE FUCKIN
ENTRY TO MAKE ME FEEL GOOD, HUH?!! Okay, you wanna play like that ... I'll
play like that, fuckball. I will personally hunt down and kill each and every
y0lk reader (yes, all three of you). Then, I will kill your families, friends,
neighbors, pets. Oh, you bastards, you say "Go on! Kill me. If I had friends
and family I wouldn't be reading y0lk!"  You think you're trickey, dontcha?
We'll see who has the last laugh!@ Ha!@  I will now only answer to the name
"Mutter, the y0lk-reader hunter!"

     umm... Gee, I never thought it'd be so hard to think of a transition
between subjects ...

     So, anywaze, one late night I saw phorce on IRC (only it wasn't phorce
... oooo-weeee-oooo) and I thought well, gee, this is weird.  Phorce's account
is logged in but he's in IRC with the name "Istigkeit".  It took me a while to
figure out that this was in fact his sister (who used to go by the handle
"moonbeam"). So here, an exclusive interview with phorce's sister (well,
kinda)!

         ya know?
<mutter> Have you ever seen "The Net"?
<mutter> ya know, the movie with sandra bullock... anyways, its not important
<Istigkeit> yes i saw it! tell me seriously who you are!
<mutter> our whole lives are on the computer, ya know?
<Istigkeit> shut up, i know shit about this computer. my life is not in any
            way on it.
<mutter> Im watching you RIGHT NOW!@#!@ Don't sit so close to the monitor!!
         heheh
<Istigkeit> shut up. PLEASE! who are you!!!!!!!!
<mutter> okay...i gotta get going...cya later. nice to meet me!:)
<Istigkeit> no you are not leaving NOW WHO THE HELL ARE YOU????? please, i
            just want to know if i know you or not. Please? :(

<_Raven_> Quit stalking my woman
<mutter> you got it, man

*** Signoff: mutter (blah)

-----------------------end convo!#---------------------------------------------

Obviously, she has a little romance going on with _Raven_, thus the
reference to her as "my woman." I laughed out loud when I got that one.
 Stay tuned for further developements in the Istigkeit + Raven
 "situation"! w00, gossip. err.

Anywaze...

---(it ended there.)----------------------------------------------------------

 wow.  my sister has quite a mouth, it seems.

 if you see her, don't be a stranger if you see Istigkeit (phorce@openix.com)

 she'll hate me for that.  heh.

 one of the power boxes had melted, and every time the low end of the P.A.
 would rumble, it would jiggle the cord and all power onstage would just shut
 off and turn back on. If you have a sampler, that means you're down for a
 minute. And if you have tape deck, ahem, that means it stops. But, I think
 because we were an "electric" band, everyone was just waiting for us to fuck
 up onstage. So this started happening and: "Hello, does anybody know what's
 going on?" A voice from backstage: "No, but I think it'w working now." Turn
 to crowd: "Okay, hey, we suck, so here's the next song." And ten seconds 
 into it, every time he hit the kick drum, there it went. Turn back around: 
 "This is the biggest show we've ever played, does anyone know what the fuck
 is wrong?" Voice from backstage: "We think we have it!" Turn to the crowd:
 "Okay, one more time," and ...

 Keyboard Magazine: So what did you do?

 Trent Reznor: We smashed all the gear, and ran to the bus.

 Readers Note:

 Anyways, that hellish incident took place in Phoenix, Arizona. Arizona is
 the stat that I live in, just in case you didn't know. And if you don't give
 a fuck, then you shouldn't have read my readers note.

      We have a web page, a vmb, and a book.. featuring poupey stories
     -----------------++++++++++++++++++++__________-----+++++++_-----
                               THE STORY SO FAR!!
               Nybar crisscrosses the globe performing his stick juggling act.
              He can do it verrrrrryyyyyyy well. But sometimes he comes to a
             hick state. This is the story of Nybar's visit to one of those
            Redneck States.
      *******************************************************************
                  After performing my amazing stick-juggling act.. I went
                 to shake hands with the audience. There was this one crazy,
                Bell-bottom redneck, who came up to me and said.. "HOW DO YOU
               DO IT?!? HOW DO YOU DO IT?!?! HOW MAKE STICKS FLY?!!??!" then,
              I decided to do my snake dancing act, sing a light song, and
             hit him with a big stick as the conclusion. So I started dancing
            . "Magggggiiiiiiiiicccccccc (duh duh duh dahh) the magiccc.. to
           make sticks perforrrmm.." "SHUT THE HELL UP AND TELL ME!" "REDNECK
          , BEER SWILLIN BASTAGE! CHICKEN HERDIN WONDER!!!!" "OK!! TAKE THIS!
         " <he takes out a rusty shovel and hits me with it.. mortally
        wounding me> "Should... havee.... shot yer ass.... the second I saw
       you... <redneck steps out of the shadows> MERCURI!!" <I die.. this
      story now features Mercuri.>

                             MY <long dist> REVENGE ON MERCURI!
                             (mercuri's perspective)
                   It had been a hard day at the farm. My little cow bessy
                  Had been giving skim milk, and pork and beans was getting
                 More and more tasteless. After a couple years of wondering
                what was wrong with me.. somone told me "YOU IDIOT! YOU ARE
               OBVIOUSLY DEPRESSED!! WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM." it was
              my duck. I obviously WAS crazy, so I moved to the big city.
             I got a job as a lecturer.. mainly thing like "IF MY GRAN-PAPA
            WAS ALIVE.. HE'D BE DISGUSTED AT THE FILTH IN MODERN `ZINES! TAKE
           THE PADDLE TO ALL OF YOU HE WOULD!!! <HICKKKKKKK>" Then I noticed
          something strange about someone I met on the street. HE LOOKED
         EXZACTLY THE SAME AS SOME GUY I HAD KILLED A YEAR AGO. He was waring
         an arm band that said "K.ill S.tupid R.ednecks.. KSR, so  THAT WAS
          what the KSR was. At the time, I didn't know that the guy was
           forming a red neck elimination force. Nope.. I am pretty damn
            stupid in things like that. So I decided to send in a membership
              card. A few weeks later, there was some knocking at the door,
               and a very farmiliar voice said "Hey.. you're in the club!"
                So I opened the door. The second I did I was shot.

(issue number 99)                    y0lk                    (july 30th, 1996)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% "99 baby"

well we are one issue away from 100. what makes it so special is i get to do
the very last two digit issue of y0lk ever. big deal. 

% kojak doesn't like what he sees in y0lk

actually kojak's writings in the previous issue (98 if you're dumb) i thought
were very helpful to y0lk. though i never correct my own mistakes, i'm going
to try to start to do that. one reason is that i makes my writings a lower
standard than they should be if i went back and took the time to see what is
wrong with an article.

but, as a 17-year-old-teen i don't have that much time. i'm either playing
baseball, working as an umpire, working on my music, or in my free time, which
i don't have much of these days, trying to spend time with friends that i've
hardly ever seen since the last week of school. 

% teenage life

a teenage life can be hard. everyone will go through it. you've got so many
things you have to do. then you have the things that you want to do. then you
have your parents bugging you. 

i live with my mom. though i don't see her that much, since she works days and
i play baseball at nights and work at night, when i do see her i do get upset
of something she says. why? 

because she tries to keep me her little kid. i get sick of it and ignore her
or yell back at her. why? 

i'll tell you why i *yell* back at her. because she simply gets on my nerves.

lots of things get on my nerves. like how people treat each other. either it
be on the internet or in *real* life. i hate how people treat other people. i
mean, i try not to shit on people because i know shit will always fly back in
my face. 

for 17-year-old-male-teen i'm probably more sensitive, kind and caring than
the next 17-year-old-male-teen. why is this? it probably is the way that my
parents raised me. it is probably the way i see the world and think about other
people.

guys think it is wrong to be sensitive. actually, it is fine. that is one 
reason i write poetry and songs. it is good to write peotry. it gets ride of
the stress and makes you feel better, if you write about something that was
bothering you at the moment.

i've written poetry and songs about almost anything: sex, anger, suicide,
murder, hate, love, happiness. but i mostly write about the bad things. the
reason for that is that it lets me get the anger out about those things and
not hurt anyone that made me mad. and i try to live the happy moments.

though i like to think of myself as a happy person, i do have the depressed
moments in my life. but, i would sure like to be surrounded by a bunch of good
friends.

% buh-bye

well, i'm done with this issue. get ready for the 100th issue.

<tMM> "dont' tell me what to do, just don't"
<tMM> yeah
<tMM> i know that.
<tMM> and there is no sicilian family
<tMM> a bunch of families might constitute a mafia from sicily
<hurt> tmm; how do you know? how did you find out about that?
<tMM> but there is no one unified mafia
<tMM> I JUST TOLD YOU
<tMM> my grandfather has friends.
<tMM> i am not in it.
<jobu> um. does anyone know if rj said anything about kansas? he was supposed
       to pick up some fireworks and other shit
<tMM> he once was.
<tMM> he told me a lot of stuff
<tMM> because i asked.
<hurt> tmm; did you just ask your grandfathers friends. 
<tMM> no
<tMM> i asked my grandfather.
<hurt> is he there right now.
<jobu> hey crank!
<crank> yeah?
<jobu> did he say anything about kansas?
<Gaurdian> So, uh.
<Gaurdian> Anyway.
<Gaurdian> What good is being in the mafia supposed to do you, anyway?
<tMM> with me?
<tMM> nope
<tMM> he still lives in cincinnati
<tMM> i don't live there anymore.
<crank> oh, uh, he said hurt was on the way, so I assume he's heading
        elsewhere, but he didn't specify.
<tMM> he's going to have hitmen get rj
<jobu> ok.  cool shit
<hurt> then how can you ask him the question of is there family by that name.
       you cant. so dont go jumping the gun.
<crank> but you may have to, hurt! ha ha!
<tMM> uhm
<tMM> i didn't jump a gun
<tMM> i used to talk to him about families
<tMM> and it just so happens that
<tMM> in THE GODFATHER
<tMM> there was a family called the corleone family that some people called
      the SICILIAN mafia
<tMM> i asked him if that was true
<tMM> he said there is no unity in the mafia
<tMM> just a bunch of families looking out for themselves
<hurt> tmm; cool it. it is a expression.
<tMM> hurt: what is an expression
<Vanir> he just doesn't understand. when rj goes, it's not just a fit of rage.
<jobu> hey! remember what rj did to that revrend guy?
<jobu> haha. god he couldn't even walk withougt pissing his pants
<crank> you know, I bet hurt doesn't believe any of this.
<crank> that's the best part.
<tMM> hurt: don't change your story
<hurt> tmm; well guess what. you caught me lieing. which you probably already
       knew. but, thanks to you, i learned alot about the italian mafia. but,
       i really do have a friend that is part italian and his father's whole
       enter family is in it, except for his father.
<crank> it's too bad we won't be getting a picture of hurt's face when rj shows
        up .. well, before it's broken, that is.
<tMM> wow
<Vanir> he plans everything weeks in advance. that gives him a lot of time to
        get people together...
<tMM> that was hard.
<crank> hey, it's good to admit to that stuff.
<hurt> crank; i know.
<Gaurdian> You're not going to find a hitman who's gonna do a job for you,
           hurt.  You little punk.
<tMM> why don't you do it yourself
<jobu> he couldnt take rj!@#
<jobu> FUCK!
<jobu> hahahahahahhahahAHAH
<Vanir> that still doesn't change the fact that rj is coming to fuck you up
        man. you may have been lying but we're not....
<hurt> guardian; my friends drug dealer has hitmen, which my friend could
       hire for free. since he buys so much.
<Gaurdian> Ha.
<Gaurdian> That's just talk.
<tMM> oooh
<tMM> it's a brother-thang
<tMM> hurt is all talk
<Gaurdian> They'll say stuff like that, but they won't follow through.
<tMM> he's nothing
<crank> "oh, sure I'll off a guy for you! what, oh, no charge. you sell me so
        much shit, man, this one's free!#"
<Vanir> this guy's a moron.
<Gaurdian> Nothing comes free.
<Vanir> err... a dead moron...
<hurt> tmm; everyone is all talk. 
<tMM> i am not
<Vanir> buy one hit get one free
<Gaurdian> Ha.  I really would kill for free... just once.  I'd like to follow
           someone around for a few weeks, ya know.  Watch their house.  Never
           use cars, just go on foot...  That'd just rule.  Figure out when
           they come and go... when they're alone...
<tMM> i mean every word i say here
<tMM> and back up my words.
<tMM> and do not lie
<tMM> that doesn't constitute "all talk."
<hurt> tmm; so i lied. i sinned. i have no god to forgive me. i dont give a
       rats ass. i have my own beliefs.
<tMM> which are?
<crank> your beliefs won't save your body, hurt.
<hurt> tmm; i dont feel like talking about them with you.
<jobu> FUCK FUCK FUCK
<tMM> you better make your peace with god before rj gets there
<tMM> because you are going to see him quick
<jobu> THE WHOLE FUCKING DOORFRAME IS FUCKING RUINED
<tMM> both rj and god.

       talking. i'm so wonderful.

        is. don't blame me if my brother is fucking psycho.

this is the end of the log. see they even said they were going to edit it. i
believe i got part of the edited version. you can tell kaynine who logged 
this was playing a joke on me when he logs off and then relogs on to capture
the rest. there was a part left out between that time that i said he was full
of crap and he aint going to get me. i went along with his shit. so i'm
clearing that up with everyone right now.
