y0lk #65: UNSOPHISTICATED FASCIST BASTARDS.  YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ME.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        aren't you getting tired of this yet?

--(slaughterhouse)-------------------------------------------------------------
hehe... this was my first k-rad lit.  i still think it's pretty funny.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

               Blood is dripping from my teeth,
                    Sweat drips off my brow
               I just went to the slaughterhouse
                    And ripped apart a cow

               I know that most you people use
                     A chainsaw or a gun
               But what my problem is with that
                    It's Just not any fun!

                  First I like to mangle it
                     Then I like to maim
                 Then I shatter all its bones
                  And make the moo-cow lame

                I take the scissors from my bag
                 And then the cow doth shudder
                   For what I am about to do
                    Is rip apart his udder!

               By now, I hope, the cow is dead
                      My victory so sweet
                But what I need at that point
                 Is a quarter pound of meat!

               I do not use a knife or fork,
                    I just begin to chew
               I do think that this gentle beast
                  Has mooed its final moo...

--(stabbed)--------------------------------------------------------------------
uhm, i dunno.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been shot
I have been stabbed
There's no escape
From what i've had

I try to feel
But there's no pain
Wish i could hurt
Am i insane?

These numbing scolds
Of higher ones
These wretched cries
Killed a thousand sons

But all the hurt
Becomes a haze
Over and over
A thousand Days

The wound won't heal
It's much too late
I struggle hard
To dodge my fate

I've killed myself
But i can't die
And hopes and dreams
Become the lies

I wish you luck
My hopeful friend
You live your joy
As I reach the end.

--(untitled)-------------------------------------------------------------------
uhh, i think this poem has something to do with some hallucinogen.  i don't
know.  weird.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hopeless little fuck
Living off of dirt
Buried in this muck
Buried in this hurt

Maybe he is gifted
Maybe he is strong
Maybe this young shit has
Never done us wrong

Maybe he should die
Maybe i'm a fascist
Living off of lies
Trapped in this elastic

Look at all the bugs
Falling off the ceiling
Maybe i'm just nuts
Maybe this has meaning

Shoes are filled with blood
Making all my socks red
Maybe slinging mud
Maybe throwing hot lead

Teeth are falling out
Crumbling into paper
Maybe scream or shout
Maybe i should hate her

When i was a dog
I blew up my friend's house
Then i was a log
So i killed a field mouse

Maybe i'm insane
Instead of being crazy
Maybe i'll be tame
Then i won't be lazy

All these words may rhyme
But then i would be scary
Maybe she's sublime
Maybe i'm just hairy

Who the hell am i?
Why do owls hoot?
Why do flowers die?
What's electric grapefruit?

Stagnent pools of sand
Swirling in my closet
Used to have a hand
Then i think i lost it
