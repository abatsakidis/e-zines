<=======<introduction>======================================================>
you might be saying to yourself, `boy, my life sure needs some sprucing up!'
well, this y0lk issue is a life-saver. not only will it give you a great idea
to propose to your local school board, but it will tell you a great way to
have fun with some free time after school.

<=======<bathing with siblings>=============================================>
i'm against it.

<=======<nap-time>==========================================================>
i'm totally serious about this. i say, for at least one period out of every
day, there should be nap-time in high school. you'd all go into this nice,
quiet room, where there'd be little tents and comfortable mats setup all over
the place. you go into your tent, play some soft music of your choice, and
nap for an hour. wouldn't this be great? wouldn't this solve all of our every
day problems? you could have gym right after it, so after people woke up,
they could run around and get their energy out.

the thing you might be saying is, `hell, not every kid could handle a
nap-time period. they'd be fighting, restless, and nobody could get to
sleep!' well, not if it's supervised correctly. have a couple teachers in
the room supervising [they could read a book], and, most importantly, IT'S
A PRIVELAGE. YES, IT'S AN ELECTIVE. if you're not good, you can't take
nap-time anymore. if you're a good boy or girl, and you really go to sleep,
then have fun and take nap-time instead of a study.

is this a great idea or what!?

<=======<prank_the_dog>=====================================================>
now, on to a more serious topic. i have a great idea. ok.. here's the deal.
everyone call the y0lk vmb - 800-314-8885 box #842 - and leave the following
information:

your phone number
the name of a cat or dog in your house
your last name

ok, here's what me and creed will do [or i will do]. i will call your house,
let's say your dog's name is Blorboo. And your last name is Jablowme. OK,
your Mom or Dad, or hell, even you pick up.

"Hello, may I speak to your pet, Blorboo Jablowme?"

"Excuse me?"

This will be hilarious. We will request to speak to your pet, and say that
it called yesterday and scheduled a mossage [sp], or something like that.

ok, so the idea isn't that great.

i think it would be funny.

<=======<interview_with_radman>=============================================>
i asked radman a few questions once on irc, but he never /msg'ed me back.

what an asshole.

<=======<y0lk_info!@>=======================================================>
i'm never afraid to make a shameless plug for my board, erebus. 201-762-1373.
the y0lk whq.. lots o' tfiles, all the y0lk releases the minute, no SECOND,
they come out. just mention y0lk in the letter to the sysops and you will
instantly be validated.

and as a bonus, if you type in your feedback:

I WAS THE MAN WHO NEEDED TO HAVE CEMENT REMOVED FROM INSIDE MY ASS.

you will be given elite-o access.

in the next y0lk info, i will re-print a full copy of the entire newspaper
report about this whole cement incident. have a good day.
