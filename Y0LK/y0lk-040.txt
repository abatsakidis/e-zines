 .oOo. ( shoes ) .oOo.
--+------------------------------------------------- ----- ---- +-- -+-

  you guessed it.

  i'm gonna talk about shoes of all kinds. why am i gonna do this. cuz
  i really feel like talking about shoes.

  everyone wheres them. shoes are there to protect are feet from the cold
  and hot weather. also there are many different kinds of shoes and
  companies that supply them.

  there are boots, tennis shoes, wrestling shoes, etc.

  then you got companies like nike, rebook, pony, etc.

  right now, i'm wearing a pair of old, black, raggidy, torn-up, smelly,
  crusty nike tennis shoes.

  then right next to my heavily padded wooden chair is the rebook big hurt
  preseason shoes. they named the shoes afta me of course. actually, not
  really, that is where i got the handle. one day i was looking at the
  back of my shoes and said hey, i'm gonna change my handle to big hurt.

 .oOo. ( parents ) .oOo.
--+------------------------------------------------- ----- ---- +-- -+-

  parents. they have you and they are there for you. but sometimes they
  get on yer nerves and they sometimes never understand the things you
  tell them or what you do.

  then they wonder why we dont come to them fer help or when we need to
  talk to someone.

  here is typical conversation when i dont feel like really talking to
  my mom.

  the setting in in my living room, sitting on the couch in front of my
  black television set, watching x-files. my mom has jus came home from
  doing something at here office, fer all i know she could be stealing
  gov't information. but thay any of my business, even if she tells me.

  mom; `i'm home.'
  hurt; `so whats yer point'. that is where i messed up, i should've hid
  under the couch wit my remote control and when she turned off the tv, i
  would turn it back on. this would've confused her. but i cant fit under
  the couch, so that screwed that idea to hell.

  mom; `well i love you.'
  hurt; `okay.' that was a betta attempt at ignoring her.

  mom; `well i'm back from the office. i put the stuff into the computer
       and copied the papers that needed to be copied. what are you
       doing?'

  [i ignored her for a while]

  mom; `what are you watching?'

  [ i ignored her for while more, then said something at commerical break]

  hurt; `when did you get home?'
  mom; `havent you heard a word that i said.'

  hurt; `not really. when did you get home?'

  [this really pissed her off]

  mom; `well, i've been home for the past 5 minutes.'
  hurt; `oh really. didnt notice you sitting there.'

  [x-files come back on and then i ignore her once again as she tries to
   speak to me, but i cant hear anything, except for something in the
   background that sounds like this: blah blah, blah blah, blah, i'm
   going to my room now.]

 .oOo. ( beef beef what fer lunch? ) .oOo.
--+------------------------------------------------- ----- ---- +-- -+-

  while i was about ready to finish off this ishue of y0lk, my friend
  came to my house and i said `ya wanna go to monglian beef'. so i said
  why not, i needed to get something in my stomach soon anyways. so we
  went to the mall and went in about a five dollar meal, which i got
  beef, turkey, chicken, and pork all in one single serving, along with
  some chinese noodles. they cooked it on this giant round heated cooking
  device and did this crazy chinese stuff to cook it and put it back in
  the bowl.

  then i got some coke and sat down wit my friends and at my meal. then we
  went to compusa to cause some trouble. we had some guy go into the back
  room to get a big monitor and then we left before he came back out. so
  i guess you could say that me and my friends are very evil arent we.

 .oOo. ( i am ruler of da earth ) .oOo.
--+------------------------------------------------- ----- ---- +-- -+-

  i, big hurt, am ruler of this earth. if you walk on this earth, then i
  own you. simple as that. everyone follows the laws of `creedism', cuz
  i said so. creed is second in command of this earth, so if he tells you
  to do something, you must do what he says.

  i know some people might disagree and agrue against my point of view and
  beliefs, but it is simple as that. you must follow the written laws of
  `creedism'.

  if you dont follow these laws of the religion, then you shall follow
  the punishment behind them.

  you ask how i gained so much power in so short of time. well, that is what
  i am about to tell you, so dont stOp me.

  i gained all of my power cuz i was sitting on the crapper one night trying
  to get that dung out my bunghole. you know the ones that jus dont seem to
  wanna come out and you have to push and push and push and then it finally
  comes out, but part of it breaks off.

  anywayz, god came to me when i takin a pooppy break and said, `big hurt, my
  son, i have been gone fer a very long, long time. i'm giving you the
  powers of the earth and you shall be the ruler of this beautiful that
  people are trying to destroy and take over. i will help you whenever you
  need it, but you will need to apoint someone second in command that is
  trust worthy.'

  so i thought fer a few minutes and decided that i get to apoint the
  person second in command. a few names ran across my mind, like _trip_,
  creed, mercuri, nd, fk, etc and i then i decided creed, cuz he gave me
  a chance to write a y0lk ishue fer him.

  so there you go. i'm a the ruler of this earth, cuz i was told i was the
  ruler from gOd himself.
