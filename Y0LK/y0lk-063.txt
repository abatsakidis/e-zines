y0lk #63: ELiTE LiT from the master himself
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        BaLLiSTiCK oF TYPHoiD PReSeNTS:  BLeeD.LiT, a TYPHoiD PRoDuCTioN.

        yeah, so i used to write poems for ansi groups.  everyone has a past.
for those who didn't already know, i didn't just pick up a computer one day and
start writing e-zines.  i followed a long, traumatic progression of computer
activity.  from door games, to warez, to lit, to ansi, to ascii, and THEN to
my current situation.  so all i am today, all that i stand for in the C0MPUT3R
UNDERGR0UND, is all just one big accident.  good for me.

        looking back on my humiliating past, i figured it would be a good idea
to release some of my old poems in a y0lk issue.  so here i am, and here it is.
on with the issue.

        just a note before i start... this isn't even close to all the LiT i've
released, just a randomly-selected compilation.  if anyone's actually
interested, maybe someday i'll release my entire poetry archive.  or whatever
i can find.  and one more thing: remember i was only 10-13 years old when i was
writing this stuff, so go easy on me =)

--(dark)-----------------------------------------------------------------------
uhh, dark.  i dunno.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

close to death
all is grey
hold my breath
now I pray

all alone
i see a face
eyes like stone
death I can taste

am i dead?
is this a dream?
all is red.
none is what it seems.

a cold chill
a dim light
a fresh kill
on a cold night

i lose my hope
i then let go
death is near...
that i know

my stream of life
shall disappear
no battles fought
no struggles here

and then it ends
there is no more
my soul slips by
i close the door.

--(birth of the dark one)------------------------------------------------------
look.  the satan theme traces back into my earlier days.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alone at night
A dim light
The mother forlorn
When the devil was born

She cries and cries
Tears of blood
In her eyes
Evil she must love

She looks in fear
With the softness of lace
The devil looks back
At its mother's face

Its eyes light up
When it all becomes real
It strikes its mother down
His fate was sealed.

--(emperor)--------------------------------------------------------------------
let's be crude & angry for a moment.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All hail me
The emperor of shit
Look at all my crap
As i control you with it

My kingdom of dirt
Is the realm of the naive
Here is my shit
Get down on your knees

And in your dreams
You pray and wish
"One day I'll have
a kingdom of shit."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        uhm, yeah.  i decided to release a whole bunch of these and split the
files into three parts, so, y0lk #'s 63-65 will be stupid poetry.  yay me.
