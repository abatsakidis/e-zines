 - ( intro ) - -/-/-/----------------------------------------------------------

 well, i got really bored. and i'm waiting for my friend to pick up before
 school starts. i will probably have to continue this later, but "it's all
 good."

 as you have noticed i've been gone from writing y0lk's for about three months.
 why you ask? well, it is quite simple. i went off into hiding for awhile to
 think of new ideas text zine. well, for some odd reason i name for the zine
 popped into my head and well, then ideas for things to put in their. and i
 also got writers, that left me. but, that is okay. just for you, that haven't
 been following my zine, it is called yellow journal and the third issue was
 just released. so get up off your ass and like get it.

 - ( school ) - -/-/-----------------------------------------------------------

 since i have nothing better to do until baseball practice and while i'm 
 downloading some files off of the internet, i've decided to tell you about
 my wonderful day at school today.

 my friend picked me up shortly after i started the issue earlier today. we
 got into his truck and listen to some music and shortly after that we 
 arrived at the school. he parked his truck and that was that. we went to get
 something to eat and talk to some friends before the long day of bullshiting
 started.

 the bell rang and it was off to first hour. everything went smooth first 
 hour and we even got to start drawing pictures in class about things and
 events that happend during the 1950's (what a long time ago that was).

 the bell rang, went to drop my bag and seattle mariners hat off next door,
 which is my second hour classroom. by this time i had to take a major piss,
 so i headed for the bathroom (maybe i should have took a piss at home before
 school started). 

 second hour started. i watched the morning announcments and got to work on
 a paper on current issues in the news. my second hour teacher is also my 
 school baseball coach and summer ball baseball coach. after all of that
 stupid work, i talked to him for awhile and then the bell rang once again
 letting us go to our next class.

 third hour started and i have the brother of the girl i like sitting up sit
 up and across to my right. he is pretty cool and i'm starting to treat him
 a little bit nicer, just in case for some weird reason i hook up with his
 sister. i slept for most of the notes and got the last three examples or so
 of the notes. the teacher gives us the homework and a take home quiz that is
 due this friday. after i sleep for awhile more, i wake up and talk to 
 everyone around me to make conversation, then that fucking bell rings again.

 fourth hour was really basic. i enter class, sit down for awhile, then get up
 to see if i can go to the computer lab and bullshit my way to get out of
 homeroom. within a few minutes i'm sitting on my ass playing a computer game
 called pyro II (if you want it, e-mail me. it is cool). 

 fifth hour begins. we hand in homework and notes. she starts talking about
 the stupid questions, then i dose off into a world of dreams. a place where
 fantasies come true. well, i walk up and it is time to go to lunch. 

 lunch time. though i'm hungry a little bit, but feeling not-so-great, i 
 decided to just get a snickers bar and a coke. i sit down and eat about half
 of the candy bar and throw the rest away. drink the rest of my coke and 
 dispose of the can. the people i play hacky sack with everyday arrive and we
 bust out a hacky sack and start to hack it up.

 lunch is over and it is time to go to computer programming. since i'm not
 feeling good still, i decided to not do any work and walk around class and
 talk to my fellow classmates. they elect to do the same thing and fuck around
 with me. almost the whole class doesnt do anything. that is how you can tell
 it is almost of the end of the school year (thank god!@#$).

 time to go to eighth hour. woa, this is probably one of the best hours of the
 day besides homeroom and my first two hours. why you ask. well, remember that
 female human being that i said i liked earlier in my wonderful story? yes, 
 she is in this hour. 

 she has blonde hair, blue eyes, she is slim and musclar. she has a nice 
 buttock =]. for all of you guys out their that are saying, "tell us about
 her boobs!" well, they are not-so-big-but-decent-size. her face is like 
 silk and she hsa this look of a happy and beautiful women. for awhile i've
 been meaning to get her number after i give her signs and she smiles back, 
 but i always lose her in the crowd after class. today that same thing 
 happened. 

 i tried this little trick that i read on the internet to make a girl show
 you "some ass" (as they say). well, i was suprised to see the technique work
 so well. since she was wearing a knee high dress, when she somewhat bent over
 to lean against the podium, it was a sight to see. you could see her well 
 figured buttock in front of me. not to far away, but one of my friends head
 was in the way and everyone was enjoy themselves. i think they all owe me
 a lot for what i got her to do. the bell rang and class was over for today
 and of course i lost her in the halls again when leaving school (sucks!@$%).

 i went home with my friend, but this time i had to sit in the back of the
 truck. i got home within a few minutes of leaving school, because my friend
 was racing at top speeds trying to flip me out of the back of his truck. i
 opened the door and the house was empty. i went into the kitchen and got 
 something to eat and filled up my 64 ounce cup with water (to clean out my
 body for when i take a drug test. well not really, but for baseball today).
 and then i decided to sit down a tell you my day. and here i am.

 - ( me ) -/-/-/---------------------------------------------------------------

 well, remember i left y0lk. hooch said something that i've thought about and
 have decided to come back and write for y0lk a little bit more often. i'm
 going to try my best to continue to write for y0lk as often as i can. since
 i will have to balance that with yellow journal, baseball and the last part
 of school year.

 after school is over, everything will be a lot easier to do. but, i will lose
 a lot of sleep from little social gatherings with my good friends and late
 night baseball games. 

 i'm here for y0lk, if their here for me.

 (so maybe a fwe y0lk members, could like write a few stories for yellow 
 journal. hint. hint.)

 - ( the end ) -/-/-/----------------------------------------------------------

 i felt this was a good issue. you learned a little bit more about me and why
 i was gone. anyways, talk to me sometime on irc, in #zines or email me at
 lowen@goodnet.com. well, this is big hurt saying quits for this issue of
 that most outstanding zine, Y0LK.
