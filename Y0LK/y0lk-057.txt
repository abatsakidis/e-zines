        Right now I'm gonna write something that is totally not in the style
 of RAD because I feel like writing something different.  Something that
 dives into my inner soul and reveals my inner psych to the masses, but
 looking into my soul I have discovered that I don't have one.  Don't get me
 wrong I haven't sold it to the devil or anything... I think.  Oh well maybe
 I did but I was probably lacking sleep at the moment.  See I did it again,
 I've been masking my true feelings with humor for so long that I don't have
 any anymore.  At first I was kind of pist but then I realized that my lack
 of soul would ultimately aid in my becoming dictator and ruling this ball
 of mud we call home.
        Eventually though I guess that the realization of me not becoming
 dictator will make me go insane or something.  Oh well, everyones got to
 have a dream.  Mine just happens to be the thing that has shaped my life
 over the past few years and is ultimately the excuse I use for many of my
 unexplainable actions.  Not to other people of course but to my self.

    "Stop it a great world leader wouldn't act like that."

    "It's good that you don't have anything that actually means something
     to you.  This way when you become dictator you won't have any
     remorse."

       When I was a small child I masked my emotions because I simply wasn't
 strong enough to deal with them.  I was constantly under the pressure of
 having to prove myself no matter what I was doing.  Even now I have no
 ability whatsoever to actually write about what I feel.  Now how the hell am
 I supposed to write songs about my angst and be in an alternative band?  I
 think that Mercuri has also been through a similar situation, but he's even
 farther into it than me.  I've never seen him write something that was
 actually true to him.  Or maybe he isn't like that and I should really speak
 for myself.  Or maybe I'm not making any sense at all and I'll just delete
 this like I have every other file I've ever written during one of my little
 emotional spats.  The latter is probably the solution as to why I'm writing
 this piece of crap, well fuck it even though I've deleted all of the others
 I'm gonna finish it.  Even if I don't delete it it's not going into RAD
 because it's not our style, maybe I should have Merc submit it to another
 zine for me.  Maybe I just don't feel the meaning anymore afterwords because
 I have to write it down just to get it out of my system.  Even now I'm not
 getting out what I'm truly feeling, I'm just not capable of doing it
 anymore.  If I ever was.  Damn it's a good thing I don't write for DTO.
