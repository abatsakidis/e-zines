 mentos!  the freedom giver!
  as told by: minty fresh mercuri
         boy, my last dto doodamabobber was just so fun, i've decided
 to write another one!  dont hit page down just yet, this might just
 be funny.
         ok, it's lunchtime at high school right?  so, i make my
 to the gas station and pick up a slice of pizza.  but this gas
 station is special, they have a bouncer, he makes sure no one
 shoplifts by letting only 3.75 people in at once.  and he takes
 your recipt on the way out.

         anyway, enough about fred.  my mouth didnt feel so fresh,
 so went up to the square (its a square, huh huh), and strutted
 into the local newstand.  i went to grab my usual skittles ($.45)
 but something caught my eye, it was, mentos! ($.55)

         they were beatiful.  they looked so graceful just sitting
 thier.  i bought them.  but this was no ordinary buy.  i went up
 to the register, smiled a toothy smile, held the mentos in my
 thumb and index finger.  and said ``mentos!'' mocking the voice
 in the commercial, he could only smile and laugh thinking about that
 fresh feeling i would soon receive.

         i walked outside.  frantically opening the chewey mint
 candy's wrapper.  and popped one in my mouth.  ``damn!  this are
 good!''  i said with joyful abandon.

         the street light was green and it was raining.  i had a
 mentos!  i went nutty.  i ran across the street flaunting my
 mentos as if it were a pass to lawlessness.  the people in the
 car could only laugh at that fresh feeling we all get when we pop
 a mentos!  i like to think they let me get away with this stuff
 because it reminds them of their childhood and oh, how they
 enjoyed the mentos, oh so much.  but the i say to myself ``wait,
 their just mentos! you dont need reason!''

         it was time to head back to school, i had to pass another
 street.  on the way i walked passed a lady with an umbrella, so
 i said ``hi!'' and held the mentos! between my thumb and index
 finger and said ``mentos!  the freshmaker!'' (once again
 cleverly mocking the tv voice)

         so i had to cross another street.  a snapple (made from
 the best stuff on earth) truck passeed was coming.  i saw the
 ``M A C K'' logo coming closer, i took a chance, ran, held my
 mentos in that oh, so special way.  and the driver laughed.
 (no doubt questioning the freshness of his own breath)

         i made it to school.  modeling the mentos and it's handy
 carrying case to the students coming out for c lunch.  the only
 thing they could yell was ``the freshmaker!''  and  ``hey!
 punk!  gimmie one before i kick your ass!''  but they didnt,
 because mentos allow everyone to just have fun.  making my way
 back to spanish class, i was tardy, the teacher said ``jesus,
 (my spanish name) you are tardy.''  i didnt say a word, i just
 held the mentos between my thumb and index finger.  and she
 laughed and said ``nevermind.''  the kid infront of me turned
 around and said, ``jesus!  you got mentos!  jesus has mentos!''

         everyone i saw in the halls, i just had to do it, i had
 to show them my prize i bought for 55 cents that had brought me
 so much hapiness.  so i would mock the man in the commercial and
 say ``mentos!  the freshmaker!''.  i went to pull one out, and a
 senior i never saw before said ``hey!  you got the freshmaker!''
 i laughed and said ``of course!''.

         in 6th hour some bastard offered me a starburst candy for
 one mentos mint, i could laugh at him as he questioned the
 freshness his mint gave him.

         alas, i had finished the entire recomended serving size
 (the whole damn thing ofcourse!).  and i wistfully threw away
 the wrapper that had contained the chewy mint candy.

         but thiers always a tommorow!  and i'm buying 2 fuckers
 tommorow!  i will be *so* damn fresh.

         long live mentos! - jwapienn@pla-net.net
