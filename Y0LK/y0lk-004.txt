           yolk: a young man, an infant , a yak... all living in sin
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

yolk number four.  well, as a tribute to our four-issue anniversary, i learned
how to say "yolk number four" in 8 languages.  isn't that great?

well, on with the issue.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
this paragraph is dedicated to epidemic, cuz he wants me to dedicate it to him
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

epidemic is on the phone with me.  he says "hey stain, can you dedicate a y0lk
paragraph to me?  and i said "uh.. yeah."

well just for you, i'm dedicating this paragraph.  here ya go.

YOU SUCK!!!! WHAT KIND OF LAME DORK WOULD WANT TO BE MENTIONED IN SUCH A STUPID
MAGAZINE?!?!?  GET A DAMN LIFE MAN, YOU TOTALLY SUCK!!!

just between friends.  a tribute to epidemic.

he doesn't really suck... i just didn't know what kind of paragraph he wanted
dedicated to him.  bleh

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  oops!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

just a little editors note:  in y0lk #3, i wrote over 100 lines without
reminding the readers how much we suck.  i also went on and wrote quite a few
paragraphs with a purpose, about canada.  i'd just like to apologize, it won't
happen again.  i fully regret straying from routine and acting like a real
writer.

recently, the great mogel expressed some appoval of y0lk magazine.  i'd just
like to thank mogel for his moral support, and if you could all turn off your
monitors for a moment of silence here... may mogel regain his sanity soon.

in tribute, i'd like to do a mogel-ish HPA paragraph.  actually i'm just doing
it cuz i'm bored and i have some more space to fill.

      again, and think a little
4998: repeat if necessary.

we are from sweden
we acted like we were techno gods
because we had a number one record, yeah,
now everyone hates us
pop rock lives on

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               let's review
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

this issue, we humiliated epidemic, apologized for the last issue, paid tribute
to mogel, instructed anarchists on destroying the world, gave our readers a
direct order of suicide, and glorified a crappy swedish pop band.  i think i
deserve a nice pat on the back with a salami.

thank you.
