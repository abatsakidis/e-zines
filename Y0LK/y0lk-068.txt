        look at that big, beautiful ascii.  y0lk-bl3ss1ngs go to... umm...
some wacky guy in #tatoo.

        argh, i forgot his nick already.

--[anyway.  intro time!#]-----------------------------------------------------

        i go to church.

        *every* sunday.

        don't ask me why.  my father comes from a family of scrict, practicing
presbyterians.  so, we go to the presbyterian church every sunday.  my mother
comes from taiwan, and she didn't really have much religion above your every-
day customs/rituals or something.  like eating a certain meal of rice on a
certain day.  she's a presbyterian too, now.

        i don't really like going to church, but i've been forced to go ever
since i was born.  hmph.  it's interesting, watching them presbyterians and
their rituals, and i usually find something to occupy myself with during this
time.

        right now i am reading the book of revelation.  as a subgenius
minister (another reason i feel out-of-place in church), i feel i should know
what other religions are saying about X-day (the apocolypse).

        last week, however, i wrote puppet plays.  my sister has these little
"fuzzy friends," as she calls them, that she's had since she was but a young
child.  (she's 14 now.)  we had to put on a puppet show for the 3-year-old son
of some friends of our family (his birthday).

        the cast:
        polly, the pelican
        daisy, the panda
        cheesy, the mouse
        funky, the monkey
        ralph, the black bear.
        (the child's name is "matthew.")

        the following is a product of one of these sunday mornings.  all
"ereet spellings" are transcribed straight from the original pencil.

--["first try"]---------------------------------------------------------------

cheesy:         y0e.  eye yAm a m0use, y0e.
funky:          yEp.  yew sURe aRe.
polly:          wEwP.
ralph:          DeR ... eYe Be a BeAr.
daisy:          HeY-0.  eye yAm a BeaR, tew.  a PanN-dAh.
ralph:          HEy, tHaT "pandah" acti0n is puRty RaD, y0e.
daisy:          Yah, eye be mOre rAd thaN yEw.

(my sister scribbles in: "try it again seriously")

--["second try"]--------------------------------------------------------------

                          why is the rain blue?
                             (a puppet play)
                        by rev. c. chris erway, esq.

cheesy:         why is the rain blue?
funky:          just because, dumbo.

                                  (finis)

(my sister pokes me in the ribs)

--["third try"]---------------------------------------------------------------

                           "ALF for president"

funky:          ALF is my hero.
cheesy:         me tew.
ralph:          let's make him president.
daisy:          okay.  look, a voting booth.
funky:          yay.

                               (the end)

(sister again shoves, then writes: "the search for the birthday present")

--["fourth try"]--------------------------------------------------------------

                      "The Search for matthew's present."

cheesy:         where's matt's present, yo?
ralph:          umm.
daisy:          i ate it.
funky:          dumbo.

                                 (the end)

(sister gets mad)

--["fifth try (and, luckily, the last)"]--------------------------------------

                     "the search for presents, part deux"

cheesy:         okay, i have a knife.
daisy:          ouch.
funky:          here is the present.
daisy:          oww.  you cut open my stomach.
cheesy:         here ya go.  right next to the pancreas.

                                (Fin)
