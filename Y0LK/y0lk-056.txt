_Animal cruelty causes ban_ - Friday, March 29, 1996 - The Weekend Vidette p19

   EAST BERNARD, Texas (AP) - Four high school baseball players charged with
beating a cat to death were kicked off their team.

   East Berbard Independent School District Superintendent Nancy McNeal decided
to ban the youths after they were arrested on animal cruelty charges Wednesday.

   "Based on the serious nature of this offens, the four who were involved in
the killing of the cat will be removed frmo the baseball team for the remainder
of this season," McNeal said.

   The teenagers signed statements admitting they killed the tabby on March 16.

   Ryan Walter, Britt Sensat, and Danny Crane, all 17, and a 16 year old
juvenile were charged with the Class A misdemeanor and released on personal
recognizance bonds. If convicted, they would face up to a year in jail and a
$4,000 fine.

   The cat, known as Tiger, was an adopted pet of sorts at Koym Field, the park
used by the East Bernard High School team.

   Three of the athletes told authorities they putthe cat in a bag AND PUMMELED
IT WITH BASEBALL BATS. The fourth player said he ran over the cat WITH A PICKUP
TRUCK.

   Three other players who were present but did not participate in the beating
will be allowed to remain on the team. They face no criminal charges.

   Police said the players gave no reason for the killing other than they were
tired of THE CAT DEFECATING ON THE BASEBALL FIELD.
