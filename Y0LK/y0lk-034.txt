                                                        fuck you (y0lk #34)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
fuck you. no, really, fuck you. i haven't written a y0lk in a while, and it's
mainly because of the experiences i've had in the zine scene lately (all, of
course, taking place on the infamous IRC and y0lknet!@# [shameless plug]).

anyway. i was on irc. and like, tut, rattle, hal08, and a few other regulars
were there. oh yeah, pip too (this was a while ago).

anyway, firstly, i had never heard of some net that they were talking about,
which was supposed to be 'THE' zine net. oh my gawd, i didn't know the name!

LAYMUR!@#*(!&@#

so they banned me from #zines (pip did).

anyway, ok, so pip calms down and lets me back in, in all of my lameness.
then i said 'the zine scene is pointless.' because it is. who the fuck cares
about this stupid zine sheeit. i just write em, just to talk. i dunno. no
big deal, i'm not really getting anything out of it.

anyway. tut got really angry instantly, and thus, i was banned for the rest
of the night (that was the last time i was on #zines in the past few weeks,
i believe, too).

you know what? this really does piss me off. the zine scene are supposed to
be the people that have basically been 'through all the otehr scenes.' the
zine scene people are supposed to hate the elite guys, the ansi guys, etc..
they're supposed to be the most intelligent, the most open to ideas, etc.

you know what? they're not. they're the same bunch of uptight assholes that
are in every other scene. it pisses me off. just because i don't know about
some stupid k-rad net, i get booted. that's ridiculous.

oh yeah!@ another thing, rattle said i was a 'bandwagon' laymur. i don't
deny it. i prefer to look at it as my evolution, though. i started out not
knowing ANYTHING about ANYTHING in the elite scene. then i sorta learned
a little, then got caught up in the art scene, went back to elite, got
caught up in hpavc, etc.. that cycle went on, going from elite to art to
hpavc. until i realized how stupid all of them were. now i just get what i
need from each scene (ie, if i need a util, i'll call up a warez board i
still have access to, or if i want the new aciddraw i'll call an art board,
etc..)

anyway, my other point is that rattle is also a 'bandwagon' laymur. in fact,
most people are. what's the big deal? he did the same shit i did. at one
point his board was very arty, then he got some more warez for it, and now
he's apparently the zine-god. well fuck that. don't throw stones when yer
living in glass houses, biznatch.

welp, i'm glad i got that off my chest. i hope i get some response to this,
too. i would've liked to have argued all of this in #zines, but, alas, i was
banned.

and, yes, i'm bitter.
