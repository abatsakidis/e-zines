ummm...this y0lk is gonna suck. So the kind people of y0lk might see how
much it sucks, decide to deny any knowledge of this issue, do
their best to erase it from any and all records and kill anyone that
knows of it's existence ...but we know better, don't we? The truth cannot
be suppressed any longer! extraterrestrials are real and living in my
backyard. 1984 is now, mutha' fucka.

 y0lk thoughts -- a poem
 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
y0lk, you are the first thing i want to see in the morning
and the last when i pass out at night
You are like a fresh, new comedian
who's bombing on stage
but not really since people are laughing
but they are laughing at you...not with you.
but any laughter is good laughter, right?
no?? umm...then who cares what they think...BASTARDS!@#
THEY WILL ALL CRUMBLE BENEATH THE MIGHTY y0lk!@#
THE WAR HAS BEGUN!

                    -- anonymous


okay, that's what those of us in AA call an "icebreaker".

-------<get on with the issue already>----------------------------------------

I think those messages are supposed to indicate the voice of y0lk or
something. Maybe the voice of God...maybe one of my many schizophrenic
personalities. I have many personalities...but they're all identical
so it gets kinda confusing.

-------<PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE MAN BEHIND THE CURTAIN!>----------------------

w00...a wizard of oz reference. That movie was pretty cool. It's about
this chick that took too much nutmeg and started seeing wild shit. I
dunno...i really never got the wizard of oz. It musta been pretty cool
when it came out. Ya know, going to the movies and seeing color for the
first time. Of course some little fucker would probably get to you
before then and blow it for you.

    "...the best part is when she opens the door and it's all in
    COLOR@!#"

    "You fucker. You ruined the best part."

life's like that.

------------<you bore me like a mutha'>---------------------------------------

Who the fuck are you to judge me? Who the fuck ARE you? Shut the hell up
until you can tell me who you are, and how your messages keep appearing
on my screen.

------------------<my name is jim, and its a secret>--------------------------

uh huh.

Another cool thing about the wiz--

----<i like long walks on the beach, holding hands under the sta-- >----------

okay, shut the fuck up, mutha'bitch.

---------------------<tee hee>------------------------------------------------

As I was saying...a cool thing about that movie is in one scene you are
supposedly able to see a munchkin hanging himself in the background! How
funny is that?! A fucking munchkin goes bouncing up and down on a rope
in the background. Oh, jeez. Don't believe me? I've never seen it but
they tell me you are able to see him bounce down (very blurry) in the
background of somewhere around where the witch throws a fireball at the
scarecrow. gotta love those midgets.

----------<that's like that dead kid in three men and a baby>-----------------

Jim, don't even get me started. That was such a publicity stunt it's not
even funny...

-----------------<ya never know>----------------------------------------------

yuppers. I love midgets. Especially when they are screaming and jumping
up and down.  You hafta picture it...then you'd see what i mean.
woo00oo.  A lotta things I think are funny you hafta picture in your
mind.

-----------< ya mean like a midget eating a cantaloupe?>----------------------

AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!@# You got the secret word for today:
                    Cantaloupe!!
                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^
woooooo0000000ooooooo0000000ooooo00000oooo!!

Anyone remember pee-wee's playhouse? That show was fucked up...

--------<connect the dots...La la la la!@>------------------------------------

But, alas, pee-wee did something that kinda destroyed his career as
Saturday morn's most annoying TV personality and, well, that was that.

Last I saw he was a vampire in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

----------< >shudder< >-------------------------------------------------------

yea. life's like that.

Oh well, jim, thanks for being here tonight.

-------------< no prob >------------------------------------------------------
