             oO0 fun on the phone (no h/p content though!) 0Oo

hi kids, i'm bored as hell. so i thought i would write another y0lk issue. 
personally, i hate my last submission but oh well, we all make mistakes. 
(except for rodrigo sanchez, the 13 year old exchange student from my school 
that will graduate when he is 14)

anyways i just got home from work.  work sucked when i got there but then my 
supervisor left so i made it more interesting.  let me tell you about my 3 
hours at work.


-My day at work-
-by ideal-

Let me start off by explaining my job to you all.  I punch into the time 
clock at about 5:00 pm and then it's fun fun fun until 8:00 {*writer's note 
- the last part about fun was meant to be a HUGE dose of sarcasm.  If you 
did not realize this, you are dumb and should be skinned alive, dipped in 
salt, and fed to starving cows.*}.  What i do at work has got to be the most
boring, un-eventful thing in america.  I call up complete strangers on the 
phone and read them this pre-made script that talks about a symphony or 
theatre company (depends on what we're calling for at the time) and my goal 
is to get them to give me as much money as i possibly can.  Usually i end up
with nothing cuz i suck at it and then i go home.  So, other than the 
periodical crazy person or argument i have with the people i call, my job 
sucks unless i do something about it.  Today i tried to do something about 
it and it was one of those rare occasions that it actually worked.

I walked throught the big double doors at 5:00, watched my punch-card get 
swallowed by the clock and spit back up with a brand new tattoo on it, and 
then i took my place at my little cubicle <sp?>.  Today i noticed that they 
happened to place me in the far back corner where no one else was sitting.
"Hmm.. kinda nice" i thought.  That way no one will bug me or listen to how 
well i give the script.  Well, you can probably guess that sitting there got 
old real fast.

Lucky day!  my supervisor left at 6:00 so that meant that there was no 
chance that anyone was listening in on my phone line.  So, i peeled my butt 
from my chair and strolled ever-so-slowly into the kitchen.  when i got 
there, i made a bee-line for the snack machine.  I saw inside: twix, m&m's, 
chocolate chip cookies, Mr. Goodbar, Snicker's, etc..  I was pissed! not 
only was i at work, but there was nothing good to eat for me cuz i fucking 
hate chocolate!  GRR!

When i got back to my cubicle, i was still grumbling to myself about how 
much chocolate sucks.  I looked at my computer screen to see the name of 
the next person i was calling.  her name was Kim Janox.  I decided to try 
something i had once seen in an old movie. the conversation went like this.

:Kim:  hello, Janox's!

:me:   Kim???? is that you?!?!?

:Kim:  Uh, yeah.  Who's this?

:me:   It's jake!  Jake Dern.

:Kim:  ummm..... uh...

:me:   oh come on!  you don't remember?  we went to high school together!

:Kim:  hmm... jake sounds familiar..  uhmm...

:me:   remember, i sat in the front row in math class junior year!

:Kim:  oh! hmmm??..  <pause>  Oh yeah! now i remember you, how's it goin?

[i couldn't believe this was working! i thought that she was going to hang 
up on me for sure. but since she didn't i could have fun!]

:me:   oh, i'm good.  I was just in town for a while and thought i would 
       look you up and say hi.  so what do you do now? i haven't heard 
       anything from you since forever!

:Kim:  Oh, i'm a doctor now!  pediatrition.  How bout you?

:me:   I'm a distribution manager for a rock band.  Maybe you've heard of 
       them... Smashing Pumpkins??

:Kim:  No, sorry, but that sounds great!

:me:   yeah it is! I get to travel alot you know.  

[the conversation was getting to conversational and boring so i set my plan 
into motion.]

:me:   Hey, i haven't been here in a long time, where's a good place to eat?

:Kim:  Westy's pub is good.  they have an excellent chicken sandwich!

:me:   oh really?  where is it?

:Kim:  [She gives me the address really fast so i didn't write it down]  you
       know where that is?

:me:   oh, yeah, i know where that is.   are you busy tonight?

:Kim:  no, why?

;me:   you wanna meet me there in an hour and catch up on old times?

:Kim:  sure, 1 hour?  should i dress up?

:me:   if you want, i'll be in a business suit since i just got out of a 
       meeting.  i'll reserve a table for two under my name.

:Kim:  ok, see ya there, bye

:me:   bye

[click]

i couldn't believe that it had actually worked!  Work was starting to look 
up.  I had a lady that was about 1000 miles away (we call LD) going to a 
restaurant somewhere to meet a friend she never had!

After that, i started talking shit to some other people just to keep my 
intrest up and to keep me awake.  I also left some pretty cool answering 
machine messages.  If ya want to know about em, tell, me and i'll write em 
for future y0lk issues.  i don't feel like typing up anymore today.

                           oO0 the end foo' 0Oo
