y0lk #51: the prince of darkness versus some guy named dave
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Dave turned on his external modem.

  Loading his pirated copy of Qmodem Pro, Dave was automatically connected to
  his Internet provider, which was autodialed in his init string.

      "b33p b30p bl30p b000000333333sssshhhhhhhhh!@"

      "Ahh .. music to my ears."

  Welcome to Elitenet, w4r3zd00d.
  You have mail.

      "Screw muh mail .. i want w4r3z!@"

  <bash$> [/u8/w/w4r3zd00d] cd .w4r3z
  <bash$> [/u8/w/w4r3zd00d/.w4r3z] ls

  NO CARRIER

  Dave dug into his warez.  All sorts of warez.  Games, apps, cracks, oh, he
  had it all.  Dave was happy.  Then, Dave's phone rang.

      "Uhm .. y0e?"

      "y0e, Dave.  Something wrong?"

      "No .. just not used to talking to people. Ya know. Like, live voices."

      "This is Satan, Dave."

      "Not another lame, inside-jokey Satan story .."

      "Yup."

      "Just what do you want, you big k-rad guy you.  If its my warez, baq off,
  can't have em."

      "I don't want your warez.  But I do want to talk to you about them."

      "I'm listening, d00d."

      "Dave, warez are bad. B4D B4D B4D.  You don't wanna go to Hell, do you?
  I'd make you my personal ass scratcher."

      "3l173!@$% Wait'll I tell the guys in #0day3l1tekr4dw4r3z i get to
  scratch Satan's ass!@%&"

      "Uhm .. no.  I only said that to get your hopes up."

      "But, I L0V3 you, man ..."

      "Yer not touching my ass, Dave."

  Dave begins to sob uncontrollably.

      "Knock it off, before I h4x0r your account."

  Dave promptly shut up.

      "Dave, if you don't stop your bad warez habits,  I'm going to have to
  torment you in Hell."

      "You can't do shi to me ... I lived through the Great Warez Depression
  of '92, the Warez Market Crash of '94 .. I'll be fine."

      "As you wish, Dave.  I'll just torment you now.  Goodbye, Dave."

      "Uhm, how ya gonna --"

  <cliq!@>

  Dave shrugged off his brush with such massive eliteness, and went back to his
  warez.  After couriering his new warez to 10 warez boards, he signed back on
  his Internet account.

  login : w4r3zd00d
  password : kr4dw4r3z
  Login Incorrect

      "Damn Satan .. thinks he can take awat my account.  FUQ H1M.  I'll just
  make another."

  Dave quickly hacked a new account.

  <bash$> [/u2/e/el173guy] irc

  Daved logged onto irc, and headed for one of his favorite channels.
