struggle wif the giant pink elephant.

by, lucifer!@

I sit back and watch tv.  I am looking at the nordic (tm) rider, on
channel 17.  Since i am such a fat load, I decide to invest in the
nordic track rider.

I sit back once again.  This time, with the phone in my hand.  I
dail the toll free number, is it hacked or legit?  The lady answers the
phone.

" nordic track rider line, extension #2, may I help you? "

" Yes, Id like to order a nordic track rider. "

" Give me your k0dez sir. "

" Uhm, here you are mam. ", I spit out my Mastercard number.

" Expect the package in 10 or less working days sir, thank you for calling. "

" Bye. "


I sit back, yes again,  but this time it is different.  I sleep.
I dream of this giant pink elephant.  God only knows what it means, I
struggle with the dream for the next 10 days.

10 days go by.

I get up, wow, this time im not sitting back.  I walk to the front door,
I notice a giant brown package, I carry it into the living room.  The
package is unusually heavy, I think to myself,

" damn. the nordic track rider on tv is supposed to be small enough to
fit under a bed, and light enough to carry to a friends house. "

" hmmmm.... "

I sit back.  I look at the large brown box, sitting in the middle of the
room,  I feel the suspense gripping my lower abdominal muscles,

" Time to work out. ", I think to myself.

I get up, and waddle my fat ass over to the large brown box.  I glance at it
once more, then decide to rip it open.

I rip it open,  inside i expected to find my nordic track rider(tm). I don't.
Instead of my Rider, I discover that there is a Giant pink elephant inside
the box.  I scream in sheer terror, only because the fact that pink elephants
dont exist.

I black out, i dont know what happened, but i believe that the pink elephant
stamped on my head, or hit me with its large nose.  But, thats besides the
point.  I also wonder why my left leg is wet.

I try to move, but i can't.  I am tied to the chair I have laid back in all
my life.

I try to scream, but my mouth is gagged.  I see a pink elephant standing
over me,  I see a foot rise above my head.  The foot smashes down.

I feel pain. I feel pain once again.

The zookeeper stirs up all the elephants, the purple ones first, and the
pink one last.

The pink elephant wakes up to the zookeepers pounding on the cage, shivers,
and thinks to himself,

" geez, those humans are wierd and scary! "
