 -- ( yes, i'm back again ) --

 it's me again. that wonderful y0lk guru, big hurt. also, known as the big
 ouchy man and just plain ol' hurt. if you are just tunning into the world
 of y0lk then guess what, i returned in issue number 89. but, if you wanna
 find out why i left in the first place, then you will have to grab all of
 them to find out why. so har har har.

 -- ( see, i'm a talking divider ) --

 my dividers can talk like everyone elses. so har har har.

 -- ( y0lktv ) --

 coming to a station near you. we've got y0lktv. look for it this summer. but
 here are some shows you will see on the new channel.

 the creed show - hosted by that wacky y0lk member, creed. he has guest stars
                  and looney contests that the audience can win. if you're in  
                  the audience you might be able to win your own "the creed
                  show" t-shirt, along with a bag fool of y0lktv and y0lk 
                  goodies in a bag. woo woo.

 the music hour - other than playing music videos between every show and one
                  at every commerical break, we've got the music hour, were
                  we play the hottest and latest music to come out. 

 the toons hour - the first week, we will have a double edge chalked filled
                  with this show. since cartoons just plain out rule. since
                  you can make them do whatever you want. also, in the first
                  week. you can make up a script and send it in. the best one
                  will win and will be made up and put on the show.

 yellow journal - well, since big hurt threated us, we had to put his show
                  on the air. and he wanted it to be called yellow journal,
                  so that his zine name would get recognized more. hurt will
                  babble about anything dealing with his zine to the colors
                  of his boxer shorts.

 the zine world - yes, we've got the zine world. were we stick a bunch of 
                  established zine peoples, two somewhat established zine
                  writers, along with smuck that we find off of the street
                  corner. they all will be put into an apartment or house
                  for a couple months until they all go insane or make the
                  best zine ever.

 today in zines - today in zines is a news show that updates you everyday 
                  about the zine scene and about the people in the zine 
                  scene. you might find out the foods that mogel eats or
                  what type of girlies trip hangs out with or even find out 
                  how big hurt really is.

 -- ( fruitopia caps ) --

 there is a big thing going around about fruitopia caps. they are starting to
 scarse. they are like a gold nugget and they are sure hard to come by. they
 are silver caps that can you get into places, get you free stuff, and get
 you discounts on special items. 

 you might even be able to use them to get the girl that you like to marry you
 and pay for your honeymoon. 

 "woa$# i got a fruitopia cap!#$@"

 to think we got a new currency laying right under our noses. get ride of the
 paper money and silver coins. all we have to do is collect a shit load of 
 fruitopia caps and then when they decide to switch over the currency, the
 ones that were smart and took my advise will be thilthy rich bastards. 
 probably richier than that computer geek, bill gates (unless he does the
 same).

 -- ( good bye ) --

 i'm sorry to say that mr divider and me have to go. but stay tuned in and 
 look for me to write in another issue of y0lk soon. and mr divider will 
 have a new style, so you will have to definitely come back and see that.

 *** big hurt, y0lk pImp
