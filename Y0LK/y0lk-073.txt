yabba-dabba do, scooby-dooby do, and many other mysteries of life
---(HANDLE)-------------------------------------------------------------------


        Hey man how's it going?  Wow, nothings really going on in my life
 right now, so I thought I'd just write something and hope I stumble into
 some amusing *anticdotes*.

 *Wow I wonder if that's how you spell it?  I've never actually used that
  word in a sentence before now.

---(this should be amusing)---------------------------------------------------

        Just read on, it might not be to bad.

        Okay, so right now I'm sitting in my room listening to the radio and
 writing this, man am I the life of the party.  Any girls out there want to
 get with a guy that lays around all day?  Um, I guess probably not.  I
 really should go out and do something...damn.  Well I tried to think of
 something to do, but I couldn't think of anything that doesn't involve doing
 unentertaining things with people that I don't like.

        "Ain't anybody gonna get up here and love my ass?" -Jim Morrison

        Hey what do you know, I put a quote in.  Now it's a real t-file.
 Let's see, I could always go uptown and hang around with the hippies, who
 seem to live there.  Good thing I've got you, it's lonely on top.  Sometimes
 I wish I wasn't intelligent enough to see that everyone around me is a bunch
 of morons, and then I could just go about being a moron and not even notice.
 Well, to late for that.  I remember when I first read a zine, it was hoe,
 mogels old zine.  Mercuri gave em to me and I read 1-90 in my spare time the
 next few days.  I was actually astonished that there were other young people
 who had thoughts in their heads.  Well at least thoughts that weren't about
 smoking pot and breaking stuff.  Bunch of rejects.

        Wow, now I think I'll write a sweet little poem.

 incense burning
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 peaceful protest in the lawn,
 gleaming ember in their eyes,
 beads drop like bombs on a wartorn city,
 peace is shattered by the sound of screams,
 trips are ruined by the smell of burning flesh,
 police search the scene and find one thing,
 incense burning.

        Get it?  It was autobiographical.  It was about me burning hippies.
 Man those silly hippies, they sure are funny to look at.  Wow, I really
 can't write poems can I?  Oh well I've never done it before and never intend
 to do it again.  Damn I'm sick of all these girls hanging outside my window,
 it's a bitch being me.  But then again it's kind of easy when you listen to
 the G'd up sound.  

 Go Ricki!  Go Ricki!  Go Ricki!  Go Ricki!  Go Ricki!  Go Ricki!  Go Ricki!
 Go Ricki!  Go Ricki!  Go Ricki!  Go Ricki!  Go Ricki!  Go Ricki!  Go Ricki!

---(using the patented y0lk dividers huh?  real original)---------------------

        Why's the divider line always gotta be so bitchy?

        Oh well, I guess it's my fault really.  I do have complete control
over what it says.

---(HANDLE is one sexy mama)--------------------------------------------------

        That's better, hmm...maybe you all would like to hear a little about
 what my lifes like.  If not just skip over this portion.  I wonder if I'm
 feeling really negative right now or if that's just the effect writing for
 y0lk has on you?  Issue y0lk as a depressant?  The ideas got potential.

        I find it really sad that the gene pool that spawned me is so
 corrupted.  My dad's side of the family is all losers and alcoholics and my
 mother comes from a long line of hicks from southern Indiana.

        ( Where that whole Indiana = Hick, thing came from )

        But that is not what I wish to talk about on this occasion today.  My
 mom's not a hillbilly or anything but she is in fact an idiot.  She has
 absolutely no idea what's going on around her at any time, yet she insists
 on trying to tell verybody what to do.  A perfect example of this is what
 just happened a few minutes ago.  I was watching TV and listening to the
 radio at the same time, being the multi talented person that I am.  Now keep
 in mind the television was in fact louder than the radio.  My idiot mother
 yells up the stairs for me to turn it down.  Assuming "it"  being the TV
 I pick up the remote and lower the volume.  Thirty seconds later once again
 she yells... no wait a second she doesn't scream she shreaks.  It's the
 scariest thing I've ever experienced and the first time Mercuri heard it I
 had to let him borrow some underwear.  Okay, so once again she shreiks this
 time saying...

        "I thought I told you to turn that down!"

        "I did."

        "No you didn't!"

        "Yes I did, in fact I turned it off."

        "Then how come I can still hear it."

        "Because you live in a magic world with houses made from gumdrops."
         -man am I oh so witty

         Then she storms up into my room and turns the radio off.

         "This shits to damn loud!"

         "You can stop yelling now your in my room."

         "Next time I tell you to turn it down, do it!"

         "I assumed you were talking about the TV."

         Going down stairs I look over at my radio and notice that the volume
 was set at the lowest possible level that it could be.  Now this is just an
 example, this is in no way why I think she's a moron.  She has the reading
 level of a fifth grader and the comprehension level of an infant.  But still
 she insists that she is better than everybody, just because she owns a
 restaurant.  Which in fact is owned by my stepfather.  My stepdad's not all
 that stupid but he does dance around the house sticking his thumbs up in the
 air, and he didn't finish high school. _Every_ day for the past six months
 she has asked me what channel "Seinfeld" is on, the other day she asked me
 how to spell "lawyer".  There is really no hope for her, I have just realized
 that I can't express how idiotic she is in a T-file.  It just comes out as
 little trivial things, but you have to understand that these little things
 are piled up upon each other and they never stop.  Next to my stepsister who
 is the child of these two morons, she is the stupidest person I've met in my
 life.

---(your family sucks)--------------------------------------------------------

  And now a story by, of course, me, entitled "All Dog Bites Go To Heaven".
It's pretty much an inside joke, but oh well, you might find some humor in it.

        "Is it okay if I drop you off here right across the street from your
 house Ed?"

        "Whatdoya think Ed's to stooopid to cross a street?!"

        Stepping out of the car in discus Ed, the local retard does a 360 to
 survey his surroundings.  Quickly the car speeds away, the driver obviously
 intimidated by big Ed.  "Where the hell is Ed?"

 (fifteen minutes later)

        Hudling close to his new found friend a retard clothed in garbage
 bags and string starts to cry.  "Do you think I'll ever find my way home
 Woofy?"

        "Arf, arf, woof, bark!"

        "Don't give me any lip Woofy."

        Furious at Ed's backtalk Woofy turns his head and casually bites him
 on the shoulder.

        "Ah, Woofy bit me!  Stupid ass organic matter!"

        Startled at the big man's fit of rage Woofy runs down the alley and
 quickly disapears around a corner.  "Damn Woofy, now how am I supposed to
 find my way home?"

        Wandering down the street Ed begins to notice everyone staring at
 him.

        "What are you all staring at?!"

        Walking even further Ed comes up to a bum sitting on the corner.

        "Do you know how I can get home?"

        "Ed junior drives a truck."

        "What are you talking about you old bum?!  Fuck you!  Piece of shit!"

        Twenty minutes later that same retard is seen sitting on a corner
 playing a harmonica.

        "I've got the blues, I've got blues.  I got the stupid person
 dropped me off to far away from my house, then woofy bit me on the shoulder,
 and now I can't find my way home, blues."

        Getting up and walking down the street Ed notices a building on fire
 so he rushes to the scene, but just as he tries to enter the burning
 building he sees a giant worm.

        "Hmmm, maybe I should pet that cute giant worm with the fangs."
 Thinks Ed to himself.

        "Ow, that stupid worm bit me!"  Suddenly Ed feels a little queezy and
 he falls to the ground.  Suddenly he opens his eyes and realizes that he's
 hovering above his body.

        "What's this, Ed's dead?  Must be that stupid dogbite!"

        Traveling down a hallway of pure light Ed comes to a set of white
 gates and an old man in a robe.

        "Hello Ed, please repent all sins."

        "Ed doesn't do repenting!"

        "Please Ed, it's necesary if your going to get into heaven."

        Angry Ed grabs the gates with bost hands and begins to bend the bars
 around.

        "Just cheap bars!"

        Ed notices a vortex opening under him, but he can't move.  Suddenly
 he begins falling and after a few minutes his scenery begins to change.
 Finally he hits the ground and looks around to see that he is in a small
 cave.  Looking in front of him Ed sees a large demon with a pitchfork.

        "What do you think you scare Ed or something?"

        "I am satan Ed, it is in your best interests to be nice to me."

        "Ed doesn't be nice to anyone, I'll beat your ass you stupid fag."

        "You know Ed, that's a nice butt you've got there."

        "Ugh, your disgusting."

        "Can I touch your breasts?"

        "Get away from Ed you stupid fag!"

        Pounding Satan into oblivion Ed looks around at Hell and realizes
 that he's finally at home.

        "Looks like Ed's the new 'Prince of Darkness'."

        Looking down at his shoulder Ed notices that the little purple flap
 of skin has left his body and is floating upward.

        "Looks like all dogbites really do go to heaven."

---(the killer awoke before dawn...)-----------------------------------------


        Loo Loo the birdie wanted to stop the oppression.  For years
 badminton equipment had been treated with disrespect.  This file is in
 memorial to Loo Loo the birdie who not only refused to give up her seat at
 the front of the bus but did so much more in the time that she was alive.

        July 14, 1948:

        Loo Loo the birdie is born to her mother and father, Mr. and Mrs.
 Louie the Lightning bug.  Loo Loo soon became an inspiration to us all when
 just as a child she refused to be smacked back and forth but demamded that
 she and badminton equipment everywhere be treated with respect.

        Since Loo Loo set the pace for other protestors badminton equipment
 has gained equality among it's peers.  No more kneeling before all of those
 damn balls.  No, now rackets and birdies would be able to prosper in the
 real world.  Birdies never conformed and took the shape of a ball, and even
 then when they damned thereselves to a life of being shunned, they rose
 above it all and demanded respect from their sports equipment peers.  That
 is of course until the new world order led by Gary the Basketball outlawed
 any sports equipment not being in the form of a ball.  That's when the
 purging started.  Man did Loo Loo and her comrades disapear pretty quick
 after that.  In conclusion I spit on you Loo Loo and all of your other
 badminton brethern who just gave up when things started to get difficult.
 In your later years you became a disgrace to your family, and to all of us
 who knew and loved you.

        However Louie the Lightning Bug, I am infatuated by your beauty.  If
 your ever at home feeling a little lonely just give me a call and I'll take
 you out and show you a good time.  Maybe you can give me some tips on how to
 "play it safe" around electricity.  And then I can take you home and rock
 your world.

        This statement should not, however be mistakenly directed towards
 Louie the Lima Bean, because I find Louie the Lima Bean to be a worthless
 slob that doesn't deserve to be alive.  So Louie, if you are listening, I
 in no way want to have sexual contact with you or any of your cousins.  In
 my opinion you don't deserve to live and I could really just spit on you for
 reading this you big piece of poop.

        That is all for my documentary on Loo Loo the birdie, I hope that you
 have enjoyed it and it has given you a greater sense of smell.  Now, the
 next time you have to do a report on Loo Loo or her father Louie the
 Lightning Bug you will have something to copy from.  But this should in no
 way be used as information for a report on Louie the Lima Bean, because even
 bad press gives him recognition and I just don't want to be a part of that.

---(...he put his boots on)----------------------------------------------------

        wow this things getting pretty long.  unfortunately for you i've got
nothing better to do so i'm going to ramble on a little more.  if you don't
like it then why the hell have you read this far already?  okay, enough with
the "i suck"  negativity i'm taking it to far.

---(i really love this guy)----------------------------------------------------

        Poop, that's right I said poop comrade.  Well Johnny there's only one
 thing I can say to that, poop.  Well comrade poop is a very funny word but
 apparently you haven't discovered the frivolous bounty of the word ka-ka. Oh
 Johnny your such a juvenile, I can't believe that you'd poopy poop over by
 the doody fart fart booger stinky poop.  Oh but I would you stinky monkey
 chicken choker poo-poo head stinky poop fart snot diarreah butt juice stinky
 stink family feud fart toejam stinky stink.

---(can i have your autograph?)-----------------------------------------------

        wow this is getting kind of freaky, i wonder who this whole seperate
entity divider thingy is anyway?  maybe he's some kind of pissed off old guy.
or maybe it's jerry garcia's spirit, mad because he's an idiot.  yeah that's
it, it's the dirty hippy.

---(i was never dir...)-------------------------------------------------------

        i don't have to listen to your crap you stupid hippy, i own you.  wow
i'm sort of a visionary.  attention all y0lk writers, take control of the
smart-ass divider line, you have to put up with his crap no longer.  wow i
think i've just cured "y0lk depression syndrom"  all by myself.

---(...)----------------------------------------------------------------------

        well, well i think my ramblings are finally coming to an end.  bye-bye
everybody, hope you don't feel cheated for spending your time on this.  wait
a second, no i don't

---(poopy suit)---------------------------------------------------------------

---(samurai-notes time!#)-----------------------------------------------------

look, i *know* that this is completely unnecessary.  why do i continue this
long-dead y0lk tradition?  because i *care* about the old practices of y0lk.

gosh, it sounds like y0lk is a culture or something.  euugh.

or... call our world headquarters, erebus, at 201-762-1373.  k-rad.

*or*... look for "y0lkb0t" on irc, efnet.  type "@y0lk (number)" for y0lks.

_OR_... ATTENTION y0lkies!#  join the y0lk mailing list!#  chat about y0lk
and all them other zines, too!#  email listserv@magsystems.com with the line
"subscribe y0lk" in the body of the message.

don't you feel like you're getting a little too much information here?
couldn't we just show our ftp site and shut up?  it's just sad that we
have to advertise all our cheap media at the bottom of every textfile
like this.  what a bunch of losers we are.
