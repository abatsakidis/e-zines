*** y0lk writer's interview form! yay! ***
person being interviewed:


briefly describe yourself as you would like to be seen by our loving public.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

my thoughts and views are so insane no one can understand them. i don't
exactly know what you mean by this, creed. do you mean physically or mentally?
i don't get it.

okay, well, i will make a breif list of my goals:

        * become some sort of totalitarian ruler of a nation

what events does an average day consist of in your life?
--------------------------------------------------------

        driving around suburbia and honking my horn at joggers and people
doing yard work and waving at them, especially if i don't know them. of
course i do other things with a very select group friends, but i won't get
into that. i also use the internet for about an hour. i go to sleep around
midnight - one in the morning; if i get more than six hours sleep i get cranky.


where does your nickname/handle come from and why did you pick it?
------------------------------------------------------------------

i modified the greco-roman god's name "mercury" so i could type it ELiTE-ly
on local BBSs.... MERCURi.

how long have you been writing for e-zines like y0lk, and why?
--------------------------------------------------------------

        since issue 31. because dto rejected me. i used to think dto was a
good zine.

what is your favorite e-zine of all time, and why?!
-----------------------------------------------------------

radioactive aardvark dung - because it's mine.
my second favorite, however, is uXu (underground experts united)... it
really gets me to thinking after i read a release of theirs... i love it; and
the gnn is my swedish counterpart.

who is your favorite e-zine writer, and WHY?!
---------------------------------------------

styx is my favorite writer. i think it's because we're alike in a lot of
ways.

who is your favorite y0lk writer, and WHY?!#$!#$!@#
---------------------------------------------------

well, since styx wrote #105... i must say styx is my favorite writer.
why?: see above.

what in god's name inspired you to write for y0lk?
--------------------------------------------------

nothing. i wrote for dto but dto rejected me. so i threw i dart and sent
it to creed.

if you were a bee, and creed was a flower, would you pollenate him?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

no, i don't like race-mixing. HEHE :)

if you were left alone in a dark room with mogel, what would you do to him?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

i would find him and then ask him to assist me in finding some way
to light up the room.

do you have any witty comments to conclude with?
------------------------------------------------

no.

hehehe. was that witty? :) :)
