 "cultural inclination?"
 by - mirrorhead

        it seems to be our nations fate to concentrate on stupid things.  why
 do the ignorant, when it comes to tv, get hooked on media icons?

        i was sitting at my house watching tv, when that damned budweiser
 commercial comes on.
 
        that damn frog!@
 
        what makes market analysts think that people will buy their product
 because of an icon in their ads.  yet, people find it cute.  they find it
 creative.  cute?  maybe.  creative?  possibly.  pointless in advertising for
 _beer_?   yup.

        when people buy a product i hope, i mean really hope, those
 ridiculous commercials have no influence when picking a brand name. whether
 it's beer, or _any_ product.

        so i ponder :
 
        what does a frog have to do with a beer?
 
        q : does a frog drink beer?   
        a : if it did..  it-   well, no.
        q : does a frog make beer?
        a : golly, i hope not.
        q : does a frog buy beer?
        a : bah.  plain silly, they don't live past 21.
        q : does or _should_ a frog of all things be used as a marketing tool
            for beer?
        a : !!!!!
 
        my goodness. 
 
        and people buy articles of clothing promoting those mascots of
 commercialism.  hats and t-shirts with the bud frog on it.  i was with my
 friend in a mall.  i left him alone for 5 minutes.  lordy, _5_ minutes!  and
 he couldn't resist.  when i came back he was sportin' a brand new $19.95
 t-shirt that had that bud frog on it.

        "egads!@   you b0nehead!#" said i.

        and proceeded to remove an arm from a nearby mannequin, and beat him
 profusely.

        it's not just bud.

        chester the cheeta.  a cheeta eats cheese?  gasp!

        a red dog?   i don't know of any dogs that are red.  i think.
        
        and that bunny.  energizer.  oh, that bunny.  shudder goes me.  it's
 so evil!#  so spooky!@  a rabbit powered by a battery!$   simply ghastly.

        so i ponder yet again :

        what does a _bunny_ have to do with batteries?

        q : does a bunny make batteries?
        a : eek!
        q : does a bunny use batteries for energy?
        a : proposterous!@
        q : therefore should a _bunny_ be used as a marketing tool for
            battries?
        a: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

        hm, well wait.  i missed the obvious.  why the hell is the rabbit
 pink?

        shrug.

        it's the media's determination to take advantage of people's
 ignorance. people see a bunny for batteries.  "aw!@  a bunny!  how cute!
 let's go buy a carton of batteries!#"   what the fuck.   people see a frog.
 "hey that's funny! tee-hee!  i want some beer."   i can't believe people
 fall for that. i'd love to see a plain commercial.  a picture of the product
 and why it's good, nothing special.  a silent commercial, maybe.  no michael
 jordans, or deion sanders, joe montanas.

        i don't care if you're not only the president, but also a client. 
 
        i don't care if mikey likes it.

        if you're reading this you probably have a good chunk of clue in you.
 raw intelligence.   you don't fall for this do you?   i didn't think so.
 keep up the good work.  don't turn into an ignorant fool.
 
        see past the media, and what they stand for : taking advantage of
 american ignorance.  stop letting the media, especially tv, make america's
 destiny : ignorance.

        just needed to get that off my chest.
