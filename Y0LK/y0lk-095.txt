-=ð[Opening Riddle]ð=--------------------------------------------------------

jane ordered something at a restraunt that had five a's.
what was it?@!#  (answer at end of y0lk.  if i forget, it's
not my fault... for some reason)

-=ð[hey sphrog, these divider thingies seem more r4d than usual...]ð=--------

that's because i found one of those ass-key chart things that tells me which
keys to press to become more and more 31337.

-=ð[poetry corner]ð=---------------------------------------------------------

my room has a futon in it
it has three stuffed fish on it

it's not because i'm psycho
or because i love fish

it's because my mom's psycho
and she got them for me.

when she got them, i said "thanks mom, thanks a lot for the fish."

one night, i heard the fish walking around
but it wasn't because i'm psycho
or because they were walking around

it's because my mom was walking around downstairs
and i was hearing her.

if you arrange the fish the right way, it looks like they're having sex.

                                                    ..fin..

-=ð[two zine guys outside blimpie]ð=-----------------------------------------

namely me and phorce

it starts to rain

phorce: raining.
sphrog: yup.
phorce: what's all this water falling from the sky?
sphrog: yeah...  what the hell is this?
phorce: someone stop it.
sphrog: man...  someone's gonna get hurt.
phorce: wakk.
sphrog: it's a conspiracy i tell you.
phorce: nods.
sphrog: those people in washington prolly have something to do with this.
phorce: yup.
sphrog: i disapprove.


-=ð[dogs have penises too]ð=-------------------------------------------------

most things that are male have penises.  girl dogs don't have penises.

-=ð[convo with the momz]ð=---------------------------------------------------

report cards came home... this conversation inevitably ensues:

momz: hmm...   c- in math?  what's goin' on?
mike: uhm...
momz: "is inconsistant in effort?"  what does THAT mean?
mike: that means that i don't produce a consistant amount of effort.
momz: that's not good...  C+ in HISTORY!@?#  what happened?
mike: she's a rediculous grader...  that was the highest grade in the class!@#
      (translation: this is an outright lie, but i always have to use this
      excuse at least once.)
momz: why don't i believe that?
mike: coughcuzit'saliecoughcough
momz: what was that?
mike: something stuck in my throat.

.. pause ..

momz: you need to spend less time on the computer.
mike: ugh... here we go again... (translation: i'm a loser... it's my job, and
      nothing you say will change my mind.)
momz: and you need to go get help in math... (translation: you're dumb as a
      rock...  get helpz)

..phone rings..

momz: (into phone) hello?    dunno...  (to me) "mike, are you doing anything
      friday night? the smiths (name has been changed) want you to babysit."
mike: i'm uhm...  going to great adventure that day, dunno when I'm gettin
      home.   (translation: of course not...  i'm a loser. i'm getting home
      at six thirty, but you don't know that, and i don't wanna babysit...)
momz: (into phone) well...  talk to him  ::hands the phone to me::

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=phone convo=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=--==-=-=

mike: yeallow...
smith: yeah... i was wondering if you wanted to babysit friday night...
mike: welp.. i'm going to great adventure that day during school, and I don't
      know what time i'm gettin' home.
smith: aah... so you don't know if you're getting home before 8:30?
mike: nope... and I don't wanna commit... (translation:  i'm getting home at
      6:30, and I don't wanna babysit)
smith: okay...  well...  thanks anyway.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=end phone convo=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

momz (who was listening): you DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GETTING HOME!@?#  it
     CAN'T be too late...
mike: they wanted me to go over at 6:00.
momz: so what are you gonna do when you get home, go on the computer?
mike: dunno.
momz: i'm serious. (translation: you're pathetic...  get a fuckin' life)
mike: i might go to this ska thing... (translation: "i might MAKE SOMETHING UP
      to make you feel better.")
momz: right....

.. i walk upstairs ..
