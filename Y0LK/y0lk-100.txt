 Dear YOlkmasta,

 I've been browsing yOlks, sampling a few issues and have really enjoyed it.
 YOlks is very refreshing and the writing is totally insane.  I like it a lot
 and plan on visiting again to read more.

 I'm interested in speaking with you regarding alt.youth.media, an exhibition
 that The New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York is presenting in
 Septmeber. The exhibition will look at youth culture through an examination
 of alternative publications, videos, and on-line projects. The exhibition
 will include screening areas where videos will be continuously viewed,
 computers for websites and CD ROM projects and a zine reading and publishing
 area.

 I would enjoy getting in touch with you to discuss yOlks and how it could be
 included in the exhibition.  Please contact me at 212-XXX-XXXX or send me
 e-mail at aym2@thorn.net.  I look forward to hearing from you!

 Sincerely,

 Melanie Franklin

        TOP TEN METHODS TO OVERKILL A JOKE

        10. Repeat the joke.
         9. Repeat again!
         8. Repeat it one more time!
         7. Repeat it again!
         6. You should probably repeat this joke again for the full affect.
         5. Try repeating the joke again.
         4. Repeat it!
         3. At this point, you've probably already overkilled it hehehe!# :)
         2. Repeat the joke again!

 seriously, fuck. i'm fucken pissed at all the #zines kids. all they do is
 sit there and idle all day and say shit.

 there, the other day bF was on #zines, and i asked him when the new rice
 was coming out and he said "FUCK YOU JERKFACE", except he couldn't ban me
 because he didn't have ops.  actually, no one had ops.

 also, gaurdian won't put me on snuffyii, and this sucks.  fuck you gaurdian.
 even though i have ops on y0lkb0t, i want SnuffyII action too!!!@@  anyway,
 the bots are always banned in #zines, and when they're here, they don't
 have ops. that's the dto people again. fuck you murmur and tao.  you all
 suck!!!

 so anyhow, zines suck. i just read dto and it was pretty bad. too long and
 too serioius. then again there's y0lk that's good. but hey, we're gonna be
 in an exposition in a museum, or so creed said. creed is pretty rad. i mean,
 y0lk is dumb and all, but it's entertainment. you #zines kids don't 
 understand what entertainment is. you're so stupid.

 so i just went in #y0lk the other day but no one was there. tough shit. i
 came back in #zines and no one was talking except bF, but i don't remember
 what he was talking about.

 then mogel came in the channel and asked me to write for dto. wow!! that's
 pretty rad!

 so yeah, dto is pretty good. but y0lk is better, even if it's dumb.

 so uh yeah.

 i think i'm gonna stop this here.

 maybe.

 or maybe not.

 gee, this is turning into a murmur article.  but well, dto is good.

  _i am the ruler of the whole universe_
  a text file written by BIG HURT

        2day was an ok day.
        
        i got up, i put on my supperman underoo pajamas, went to the
 bathroom, and made some applejax. i started eating them real slow, when i
 noticed the time. i was gonna be late, so i slurped down my serial and
 went 2 skewl.

        i really don't like skewl very much, but i got to go to batting
 practice which is always pretty phun.

        there's this lowd kid on my baseball team that always talks a bout
 reliegion and distracts me when i'm trying to concentricate. people that
 talk during those times are annoying. my feelings on religion are .. well, i
 think trent reznor said it best -

        "god is dead
         and no one cares
         if there is a hell
         i'll see you they're"

        i think that this song means that god died and that in trent reznor's
 opinion no one really gives a shit, but then again he doesn't deny the idea
 that there could be a hell, which is the opposite of heavenf, and that he
 will go there and see you. but, then again, i'm not in trent reznor's head,
 so maybe i don't know what it means! man, i wish there is a hell 'cause i've
 never met trent reznor in my life and i sure wish i could!!

        anyhow, this kid got hit in the head with the ball and hee! it was
 phunny (he got a head like a hole!!  hehehe...)

        so i went home and i watched x-filez and my mom kept talking the hole
 time. sometimes its so boring on friday night. i had nothing to do today.
 its knot like im a geek or nothin i just didn't have any plans. plans,
 that's what counts. if you have plans you'll go someware in life. i don't do
 2 many drugs or drink but sometimes its nice to get you're mind off problems
 and to forget wear you are. then again those who do drugs will go noware in
 life.

        i herd trent is on drugs, but my opinion is that it's just a rumor.

        i tried to right again for my little zine, yellow journal, but
 the whisper virus fucked up my turbo pascal 7.0. this sucks, now i can't
 code. i like to code. especially in upper case. coding will get you far in
 life. baseball too.

        the other day my dad asked me 2 rite a program that makes the family
 budget and it was nice to do it. this kind of program require special skills.
 i almost did it, i think. but then again my tp7 crashed. i will finish it
 later. until then i'll go do some more batting.

        i gotta jet now.  l8r.

 by: peewee the hacker chicken

        fuckin' worms - do i ever hate them!  the other day, i saw that worm
 & told him, "hey worm, i'm a hacker chicken, so you gotta lemme eat you" but
 the motherfucker doesn't even answer & acts dead.  but since i'm clever, i
 ate it anyway.  *YUCK*  it was dead for real!!@!@  those damn worms can't
 just look dead or alive or something, they always confuse the hell outta me.
 fuck those worms, i say.

 >>>> how to card a nest
 by: egghead ernie

        a lot of chickens ask me "how do i card a nest???" & say "ernie, i
 will pay you ten eggs for a my very own carded nest!!!", & i gladly take
 their eggs, for they are stupid, stupid chickens.

        i know that the whole nest-carding scene is going to totally flame me
 for this, but now with my help - YOU can card your OWN nests, free!

        carding a nest is very easy.  all you need to do is to sneak into
 your pharmer's house in the middle of the night or in the day, & look into
 his wallet.  take his "VISA" or "MASTERCARD" number, name, & expiration
 date, & flutter over to the nearest payphone.

        i suggest calling 1-800-DIGI-EGG for the fastest & most reliable nest
 service.  they don't put any of that spit or moldy twigs or anything you
 find in those "low grade" nests.

        you - *beep*beep*beep*beep* (redboxing!)
   operator - can i help you?
        you - yes, i would like to order your premium nest model, please.
   operator - ok, please give me your information.  that will be four
              "bucks".
        you - pharmer phil.  9443-3245-2534-3413.  expires 12/96.
   operator - ok, your nest is on its way!!!!
        you - thanks!

        see how calm & relaxed i was the entire time?  this is the additude
 you *must* have when carding your own nests.  oh, & remember - you're a
 chicken so you can't get caught!  ha ha!

 by: plummy pam

        you can't do it.  pharmers fucking suck.  fuck you, pharmer.

        sometimes if you peck them in the foot *just* at the right moment,
 while they are feeding you, you can get them to accidently spill *extra*
 food for you!  awesome!

        lady death is my friend.  my feathers are black.  my beak is pierced.

        being a chicken in the ninetees sucks.  life will lead you to death.
 seriously, what's a chicken can hope?  we just get fed, fed, fed (notice the
 word here?  "fed") until we get to the slaughterhouse & die.

        MY BLOOD WILL SOIL THEIR SLAUGHTERING MACHINES!@!!  THEY WILL NOT
 GET AWAY WITH ME!

        don't get me wrong.  i'm a real goth.  i KNOW life.  i KNOW death.
 i know everything.  i pick by night.  i sleep all day.  i am a night owl -
 er, bad pun.

        anyhow, tonight there's a concert of nine inch eggs & roosters of

 them!??

        look at me, i just typed myself doing something & responding to what
 i just said.  maybe it's time for something really clever ..

        'cause i mean, you know, 'zines ..

        i mean they come, they go & all.  i've seen many a story written 
 where the characters would just blow up at the end because the writer had no
 clue how to end it all.
