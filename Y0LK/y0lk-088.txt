=={Hi ideal!}================================================================

Wow, I'm bored.  So bored that i decided to write another y0lk issue.
Let me tell you a little about my weekend.  I've been sitting at home all
weekend sick as hell.  Snifflin' and Sneezin' with snot hangin' outta my nose,
I've been talking on IRC and some local boards almost non-stop.  I'm such a
loser.

=={I said HI IDEAL!}=========================================================

Oh, hi divider!  how are you today?

=={not too bad, yourself?}===================================================

Ugh, i'm talking to the divider! what's my problem??  I must be sicker than
I thought.  So, divider, what's next on the agenda?

=={PHAN MALE!}===============================================================

oh yeah!  Ok faithful y0lkers, sit back and enjoy the fan mail i have
recieved.

=={Letter #1}================================================================

Dear y0lk,

Hi, my name is Fred Palmencheri and I have to admit that i am a y0lk addict.
The other day, my boss came into my office and saw me reading y0lk and he
asked me "Is that y0lk???!"  When he found out that it was, he gave me a
promotion and a brand new office on the top floor.  Y0lk made me a very happy
man.  I guess my boss must like y0lk too.

P.S. That guy ideal is amazing.  He is one of the main resons that i read
     y0lk.

                                        sincerely,
                                                  Fred Palmencheri

Fred,

We're all very happy that you like y0lk so much.  Chances are your boss
doesn't really like y0lk.  It's probably just the fact that he doesn't
understand y0lk.  And people (especially employers) fear what they don't
understand.  Your boss took one look at y0lk and noticed that you were
reading something way beyond his comprehension level.  That caused him to
fear you.  So remember, if we stop publishing y0lk, your out of a job! So
we expect you to send half of every paycheck to ideal's PO box in order to
keep us alive.
                                        y0lk

=={Letter #2}================================================================

y0lk,

I'm not sure if you are aware of the immense strength of your `zine.  The
other day i was walking through an alley on my way home from the annual
Spam-a-thon when this man came up to me and tried to mug me.  He shot at me
with his gun but luckily, i had my latest copy of y0lk in my breast pocket.
y0lk stopped the bullet and allowed me to run home safely.  Unfortunately
my copy of y0lk now has a huge bullet hole through it.

                                        Thanks y0lk,
                                                    Jasmine Blue

Jasmine,

I cannot believe the nerve you have.  You put y0lk before your life???
You don't understand the emotional strain you have put on every y0lk writer
down here at y0lk central.  If you ever blasphemy again like that we will be
forced to put raw spinach down your pants and continuously throw burrs at in
your hair.  You should be dead!

                                        y0lk

=={Letter #3}================================================================

Mo Fo's,

Yo, dis is Tyrone.  I jus' wunted you to know how much I hate you!  I'm out

watch yer back, cuz i ain't trippin.
                                        Tyrone

[this letter triggered my curiosity.  So i gave our friend Tyrone a call on
the phone and here is the shake-down of what happened to him.  He and his
friend Harvey Chan were sitting around one day and this following play is an
account of what happened.]

[Tyrone]: Yo nigguh, Let's go to the stoe!

[Harvey Chan]: Ahso!

[Tyrone]: What da fuck you call me rice boy?  Yo fo bettah not trip me daz
          jive no mo' or i'll bust a cap in your triz-azz!

[Harvey C.]: Oh no!  no disrespect to you T-Bone san.  I finish waxing flore
             and we go to the stove!

[Tyrone]: The stoe!  not da stove!  Damn! whazzup wit' yer squinty eye ass
          anyway?  You be trippin or what?  And what the fuck you doin'
          waxin' the floe?  Allz we does here is sit and play dize foo!  Now
          git yer ass up off that floe befoe i whoop yer funky li'l chinese
          ass!

[Harvey C.]: Oh, Ahso! Ai-ya!  so sorry Mr. T-Bone san! now we go to the
             stove?

[Tyrone]:  The stoe nigguh!  The stoe, not some mutha fuckin stove!  I'z swear,
           you ain't nevah funna be down wit's da dog pound if you don't
           start lernin' sumptin!  Now grab yer glock G, we'z gonna go on a
           Ghetto Grocery spree!

[Harvey C.]: They have soy sauce and Chung Lai Fu in the getto stove?  I need
             for my wok!

[Tyrone]: Yeah, of courz we'z gonna walk!  now get yer slany-ass over here so
          i can teach you bout the glock!

[Harvey hurries over and pulls a pocket watch out of his over-sized, gangster
coat]

[Tyrone]: What the fuck is that negro?  Who cares what time it is?

[Harvey C.]: Oh, this is my clock.  You say get clock, so i get clock!  You no
             think this good clock?

[Tyrone]: Man! Put that shit away!  I said your...forgit it, let's jus go man.

[They both pull their extra baggy gangsta' pants halfway down ther ass' and
start to walk with style down to the store.  When they get there, a goofy
looking, scrawny, smelly kid in torn jeans and a dirty T-shirt is standing
outside.  On his head, he is wearing a hat that says "ask me about y0lk"]

[Harvey C.]: Oh, yolk!  I need eggs for my stir fry.  Thank you most
             honorable...

[y0lk]: CHING CHONG FUN!  CHOO HAI!

[Harvey C.]: You no funny yolk man!  I talk speak good english talk!

[Tyrone]: Yo homes, what's y0lk?  Dat some kinda chronic?  Dat would be tha
          shit.

[y0lk]: Uh... yeah, it's da shit! *hehe*

[Tyrone]: Fresh! how much for a dimer?

[y0lk]: Uhm...$20!

[Tyrone]:  cool, gimme one man! Here's the dead prez's!  Yo, what's yer name?

[y0lk]: why?

[Tyrone]: So I can beat yer ass if yer selling me some funky ass shit!

[y0lk]: Oh, well, in that case, my name's g3cko.

[Tyrone]: Awright foo, gimme da shit

[y0lk hands over and issue of y0lk]

[Tyrone]: What is this? you playin'?

[y0lk]: uh, no... the *shit* is in the paper.

[Harvey C.]: So we roll up paper and smoke?  then we get a, what you call...
             Fuzz???

[y0lk]: Uh... sure, if you want.  well, see ya.

[y0lk boy runs off with his $20]


Dear Tyrone,

I am truly sorry for our friend's ignorance.  We here at y0lk do not know who
it is that sold you the y0lk.  But we see now that it was a rip off.  If you
could just send in the additional $20 to ideal's PO box, everything will be ok.

                                        y0lk


Imagine that, one of our own, selling y0lk for a mere $20.  If we ever find
out who pulled this stunt, we will tar and feather him.  Remember y0lk staff,
if you peddle y0lk, $40 is the lowest we will go.

=={end it please}============================================================

woah! haven't seen you in a while divider!
well, i'm still sniffling but i think i have successfully channeled all of my
stupidity through another great y0lk issue.  bye.

ideal's e-mail address is kevin@mixcom.com

=={samurainotes}=============================================================

sometimes i worry about myself getting to power-crazy up here in these ivory
towers of the y0lk building.  but i usually quench these worries by writing
a few meaningless notes in other people's work.
