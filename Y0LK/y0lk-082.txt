 "journey into the mind of a no-brained counterculturist"
 by - taraxis

        i'm bored and i'm not feeling cool(tm).  all my friends are cool(tm)
 except me.  waaaah!  john is a r0xin' anarkist (he dumps chemicals into the
 toilets in school and stuff) and pete's got twenty nine earrings and dyes
 his hair indian corn yellow, but i'm nothing.  sure, i have my ripped jeans
 and pearl jam shirt (9 out of 10 guns prefer kids to crayons or something
 like that who cares i'm still cool(tm), but i'm lacking something.  i don't
 have an identity.  i _need_ a fucking identity!@$##!$  i need to rebel(tm)
 then i will rock!  so i get my pen out and make a list of stuff to do so
 that all the girlies will love me:

 1 - fuck sex.
 2 - fuck religion.
 3 - fuck school.
 4 - fuck mom and dad.
 5 - fuck the government.

        oh boy now i'm excited!  this is going great!  i mean, this is the
 shit!  see?  i'm on my way to identity nirvana already.  oops nirvana sucks,
 i'm sorry.  i've always thought they sucked, even though i bought all their
 cd's, which i throw away now.  i start now to consider my list more
 carefully...

 1) fuck sex

        dammit those fuckin' hippies beat me to it.  argh!@!$#  but maybe
 i'll tell everyone i'm bisexual and love tori amos... this has potential.  i
 circle this on my list.

 2) fuck religion

        shit i can't do that, all my friends are either atheists or wiccans,
 so that's not original.  and forget believing in god, that's just not
 cool(tm).

        money hungry asses on tv say they believe in god.  i'm not a money
 hungry asshole.  therefore, i don't say i believe in god.

        makes perfect sense to me.

 3) fuck school

        fuckin'-a!  no one likes school.  "school is not cool(tm)."  jeff
 tells me school is just a place where ultra-rightists make us feel bad and
 rape our minds, and jeff knows what's going on - just look at his black
 painted fingernails!  anyway, that's not new.  i continue my search for the
 cause of the world's failure...

 4) fuck mom and dad

        confound it everyone cool(tm) hates their parents.  even though i'm
 alone in the world i can't say that because i'll be called a poser.  fuck.

 5) fuck the government

        yes!  the government is the cause of all my problems!  yippie!
 tommorow i'll go get a "the american government blows goats" shirt and show
 it off to everyone!  i rock!@!$  oh fucking fuck fuck-headed piece of fuck
 shitties!  dave already hates the government.  damn.  double damn.  and for
 a moment, i was cool(tm).  i was a person man!@#

        i sit in despair and wonder what i can do.  should i be silent and
 wait for people to ask me about my really deep thoughts?  or maybe i can go
 "hmmmm..." every five or ten minutes.  it just isn't fair.  i'll never be
 cool(tm).  (some stupid song is playing on the radio)  maybe i'll kill
 myself!  yes!  then people will always wonder what soulful things i was
 thinking, boy they'll be sorry then, huh?  (what a dumb song.)  i've run out
 of options.  i lay my head down on the table and start to cry.

        "you let me violate you..."

        wha?  what's this?

        "you let me penetrate you..."

        suddenly it hits me like a bolt of lightning!  this song... this song
 is the key to cool(tm)ness and popularity!  yes!  i'll be the first one in
 town with the shirt!  um wait who the hell is this band anyway?  they've
 probably got a kicking name like, "nuclear spaghetti biscuits" or "toad
 lick buttplugs"!!!  maybe i'll be thrown out of school for wearing their
 shirt! that would be so cool(tm)!

        "i wanna fuck you like an animal!"

        i nearly collapse on the floor in orgasmic delight!!@#  this is what
 i've always been waiting for!  i want it so bad!  so bad!  i'm so cool(tm)
 now!!!  yes!!@#$

        "i wanna feel you from the inside!"

        this is too much to bear!  i shut off the radio and run to the
 nearest tune town to buy the "i wanna fuck you like an animal" song and some
 t-shirts.  the guy working told me the name of the band but i was so
 engrossed in thoughts of how cool(tm) i'd be tomorrow that wasn't really
 paying attention to him.

        tomorrow in school when pete and dave ask me about my cool(tm) new
 shirt i'll tell them about the ultra-cool(tm) new song i've heard.  of
 course, it's only new to them because i've liked nine witch tails for years.
