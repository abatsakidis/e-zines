 the story of carla (mogel)
--(woo!# mogel!#)-------------------------------------------------------------

carla had problems.

there were very few things carla was capable of doing, or feeling. carla
was incapable of feeling love, as her dad had molested her as a young girl.
he would rape her on a nightly basis, and shout words at her, meant only
to degrade her, such as "worthless" and "silly looking."

carla was also incapable of holding down a steady job. ever since her first
boss tried to cop a feel, she couldn't trust male authorities, and since
everyone knows males run the world, she gave up hope of ever earning an
honest living.

sometimes, if she tried hard enough, she could ALMOST belive in God, but
never quite really. on her first trip to church, the pastor tried to
convince the crowd that God was an orange oompa loompa who sold hot dogs at
Wrigley Field. If that wasn't enough, when she went to confession, the
priest could not help himself from laughing hysterically when she confided
in him that she had often pee'd her pants during silent reading time in 
kindergarden.

carla had many problems. but there was ONE thing she was good at, and that
was baking cookies. she had won every bake-off contest she had ever entered.
well, that is until the incident. she was competing in a bake off, and one 
of the more sneaky competitors had slipped rat poison in her dough, causing
her to be disqualified and taken to jail.

i once met carla. there was only one thing i could think of to say ...

"sucks to be you."
