y0lk #64: creed's k-rad lit archives, volume two
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        uhh, more poems.  i hope you enjoy them, which you won't, so... i
apologize in advance, i guess.

--(morbid state)---------------------------------------------------------------
heh.  my dad found this handwritten on the floor and asked me about it.  not a
very comfortable situation for me.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sitting here
still enraged
normal life
becomes a haze
must destroy
must devour
i must kill
until the final hour
there is no heaven
there is no hell
nothing's poor
nothing's well
who am i
who are you
what is old
what is new
there is no life
there is no death
it all is here
but nothing's left
i do not love
i do not hate
i simply live
in a morbid state.

--(appendix)-------------------------------------------------------------------
here's a little humor for you.  i was feeling a little giddy when i wrote this,
i suppose.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scalpel.
Scissors.
Forceps.
Gun.
Appendectomies are fun!

Cut that motherfucker up,
Tear his ass apart.
Rip that bastard's colon out!
(Death by internal fart)

"Jones, don't pull that thing too hard!"
"Jones, you fucking twit!"
"Jones, that thing don't twist that way!"
"Don't do that, man....
                       OH, SHIT.

--(realm of kaos)--------------------------------------------------------------
apocalyptic stuff.  and, yeah, i spelled 'kaos' wrong intentionally.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The midnight sky lit up with fire
Missiles in the air
Welcome to this foul realm
Enter if you dare.

There is no hope for those of you
That choose this place to dwell
The ReaLM oF KaoS, my poor friend
Is one large living hell.

We've seen it all, we don't fear death
There's nothing left to fear
We know the fight will surely end
We know the end is near.

Blood doth drip from my bare hands
I just did kill a man
In deep red oceans, filled with blood
Is where that i now stand.

I scream out loud into the air
But no one hears my cry
Or maybe it's that they don't care
They know the end it nigh

Escape is futile in this realm
There's no one left to save us
Please, god save me from this land,
This deathly ReaLM oF KaoS!
