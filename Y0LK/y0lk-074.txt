-=[this is my y0lk...]=------------------------------------------------------

did I mention I love you as I love my own mother?

-=[let's get started]=------------------------------------------------------

First of all, you don't know me (if you're like most people)...  see, the way
I figure it, there are billions of people in the world and only
a few know me...  certainly not more than three.  So, let's assume for a
second that you're reading what I'm sayin' simply because it says "y0lk" in
the file name.

-=[dafuck was the point of that?]=-------------------------------------------

don't know.

-=[story about quiche]=------------------------------------------------------

i THINK you pronounce that KEESH, but i don't know, and i prolly never will...

************************************
FUCK THE WORLD (3133t enuff for ya?)
************************************

okay, so this guy (we'll call him Rodham) walks into a room, and he sits down
next to his quiche.  this guy's prolly different that most guys, because he
doesn't eat quiche, he BONDS with it.  This is how the conversation
progresses:

Rodham: hey man...  how's it goin?
Quiche: (author's note: hey, rodham and quiche have the same amount of
         letters#!@$(*&! and I didn't even plan it that way!@!#... now
         all this stuff will line up real nice... w0o0o0o!@#)
Quiche: ...
Rodham: got anything you'd like to...  SAY!!@?
Quiche: ...
Rodham: c'mon man...  ANYTHING?
Quiche: ...
Rodham: don't even TRY to pull this one again...
Quiche: ...
Rodham: man... a simple "THANK YOU" would be FINE
Quiche: ...
Rodham: fuck...  why are you actin' like I didn't give you any beer?
Quiche: ...
Rodham: man...  i'm gonna stop wastin' beer on you if you don't appreciate
        it...
Quiche: ...
Rodham: ::leaves in frustration::

-=[are you kidding me?]=-----------------------------------------------------

hey man...  that guy rodham...  he really DID give his quiche beer...

-=[this is old now]=---------------------------------------------------------

            how to make your own flowers that smell good:

stuff you need:
        colored paper
        duct tape
        pipe cleaners
        flower pot (or a cup)
        dirt (kitty litter)
        TEEN SPIRIT deodorant
        an acid aab (or two)

how to do it:

1) take some colored paper, and RIP the SHIT out of it, until it looks like
   pretty little flower petals.
2) take the duct tape, make a ball.
3) stick the petals to the ball of duct tape.
4) put a pipe cleaner in the duct tape ball.
5) fill the 'flower pot' with 'dirt', and stick the flower in it.
6) fuck... i forgot to tell you to put the deodorant all over the paper...
   you can try to do it at this point, but it would have been a lot easier
   BEFORE you ripped it up.
7) good, now drop acid.
8) isn't that a FUCKING PRETTY FLOWER?!?!?

        NOTE:  i can't be held responsible if you get arrested, your flower
        looks like its melting or anything... deal with it.

-=[gourds]=------------------------------------------------------------------

you prolly don't know what a gourd is...   well, get ready, because you're
about to find out...

ya know when you were a little kid, and you went pumpkin-getting, and they had
those fuckin' weird looking pumpkins pumpkins with deformities and stuff?
those are gourds.
        (NOTE: some pumpkin farms are built on nuclear waste... in this case, these
        they really ARE pumpkins...  do not be alarmed.)

-=[that had a point, you say?]=----------------------------------------------

yep...  now I'm going to tell you what to do with gourds...

-=[WHaT To Do WiTH GouRDS]=--------------------------------------------------

okay, this may not seem worth it, but remember, you can usually get gourds
pretty cheap, because hey, who wants a deformed pumpkin?

1) Get a gourd...  HELL, get SEVERAL gourds, (they're cheap, remember)
2) Bring it home, and wait for six months or so.
3) Pick up the gourd, and shake it.
4) Pretty cool, huh?                 

NOW, the explanation, for those of you who don't care enough to try it:

when you have a gourd for a LoOoOoNG time (don't ASK me how I know this),
it turns into a rattle... when you pick it up, and shake it, it has
stuff inside that WASN'T THERE BEFORE, that shakes around...

-=[WHaT To Do WiTH GouRDS iF You WoRSHiP SaTaN]=-----------------------------

steps one and two are the same as they were in "WHaT To Do WiTH GouRDS", so
I won't repeat them...  I'll just start with three... kay?

3) Soak the gourd in gasoline.
4) Drill a hole in the gourd, and put a large explosive charge inside.
5) Put a fuse on your explosive charge, and put the whole thing on the
   doorstep of someone you hate.
6) knock on the door, and light the fuse.
7) Watch as flaming pellets are embedded into the flesh of your arch enemy.
8) Run like hell.

-=[how long are these things supposed to be, anyway?]=-----------------------

at this point you have two options....  i'll include instructions on the
execution of each.

1) 'keep writing, phrog...  you're FUNNY AS HELL...'

INSTRUCTIONS:  okay... just keep reading (there can't be too much more anyway)

2) 'so far, i'm not impressed.'

INSTRUCTIONS:  bail out now, it can't get much better from here.

3) 'this shit sux0rs... i can't believe i've read this phar..."

INSTRUCTIONS: not 3133t enough for ya?  well...  PHUCK Y0U.  Stop Reading.

-=[my name is Jake]=---------------------------------------------------------

         Hi, my name is Jake...  I was born in a lumber yard when I was Six,
and I had to kill squirrels with my pellet gun to stay alive.  My father
was a pimp, and my mother was a lumberjack.  I'm real fucked up now, because
I think I was born when I was six.  Although I am a male, I have breast
cancer.  I don't have any money, and I don't know where to sleep tonight...
Can I come over your house?
                                THE END

 DISCLAIMER: this story has no plot, no climax, no point, and is basically
 pretty bad, but you can't blame me, because i....  have a disclaimer.
 oh yeah, and that breast cancer reference...  that wasn't meant to offen--
 actually...  if you're offended by that, fuck you... you don't deserve to
 be alive.

-=[aight... that was REAL bad]=----------------------------------------------

 nod... i got bored, and I ended it...

-=[this is the last little divider thing]=-----------------------------------

 i never had oral sex with a eleven year old.





                                                               ..fin..

-=[unnecessary note]=-------------------------------------------------------

        lieutenant halftrack never went bald; only slightly insane.

        GOSH, I LOVE BEING A HEAD SAMURAI.
