        a play.  i feel like writing a play.  of course, i have no idea why;
it probably comes from some influence given to me by a play i've read in some
recent time... but who cares.  i feel like writing a play, about ziners.
a dorky thing to do; yes it is.  it's been done a thousand times; yes it has.
but, as you've heard me say before, i really don't give a rat's ass about
y0lk; so forget it.  yeah.  so here it is.  here's my play.

--(yay)----------------------------------------------------------------------

- ACT ONE -

.. scene one ..

        creed and trip are sitting in an empty bowling emporium, talking.

creed:          uhm, you came all the way to new jersey just to be at this
                stupid y0lk party.

trip:           yeah, man!!#@$

creed:          I GUESS THAT'S WHY THEY CALL YOU TRIP!

trip:           HAR HAR HAR.

creed:          well, thanks.

trip:           no problem, mang.  i'd travel any distance to be at a
                y0lkfest!

creed:          i can't tell you how much of a loser you are.

trip:           guh.  we're all losers.  that's the tag you take when you
                become a zine person.  i'm a loser, and i'm damn proud of it.

        two freaky kids gallop in, screaming.

creed:          oh, great.  i suppose this is the rest of the 201 squad.

trip:           bleah.

        the freaks calm down and present themselves.

hooch:          uhm, hi.  i'm hooch.

phorce:         and i'm his trusty sidekick, fallout boy!

creed:          hey phorce.

hooch:          uh.  why the hell did we decide to meet in a bowling alley?

creed:          bowling rules man!@##

hooch:          we're not gonna actually bowl, are we?

creed:          uh, no.

        much rejoicing follows.

trip:           so.  uhm.  what now?

        loud crashing noises come from above.

phorce:         uhm, what the hell is on the roof?

trip:           reindeer!@#

hooch:          <snore>

        the roof collapses, and two men dressed in ninja gear come crashing
        down from the roof.

creed:          gad!@$  it's the japanese hitmen, they've found me!@!

trip:           no, it's the mighty morphin power rangers!!#@

        the ninjas approach and strike a pose.

belial:         no, it is us.  we represent the avalon dojo of 908.

edicius:        good to see you.

hooch:          <drool>

creed:          uhm, you went out and bought ninja costumes, and set up this
                crap on the roof just to surprise us?

belial:         yeah!@  we rule, eh?!

creed:          you people spend way too much time on zine life.

edicius:        i bought these throwing stars, too!  check 'em out!

        edicius whips out three chinese throwing stars, and throws them in
        random directions.  one hits hooch in the back.

hooch:          gah!@#!@#  what the hell happened?  where am i?!!@?$

trip:           you are in the united nations board room, doctor jones.
                welcome.

phorce:         nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.

creed:          yeah.  well.  is this it?  i don't think anyone else is
                coming.

belial:         i guess not.

        there is a dramatic pause, and a loud rumbling noise outside.

creed:          ack!@#! what the hell is that?!?!

        the crowd dashes outside to see what's going on.

.. scene two ..

        the ziners, arriving outside, are greeted by an enormous spaceship
        landing.

creed:          what in god's name is that?!

phorce:         oooh!!! aaahhhh!!@@!#$@#%

        theme from 2001

belial:         it could only be one man.

trip:           englebert humperdink?

edicius:        WHOA!$@$!  nobody told me englebert humperdink was coming!@#
                is he gonna sing?!@#?

phorce:         yeah!@#  this rules!@#!@# y0lkfest kicks ass!@#@

        <highfives>

        the spacecraft lands, out comes a three foot man, somewhat resembling
        buddha.

mogel:          greetings.

creed:          AAAAAAH!!#@$$!*#@$!*@#$&#@*$&

trip:           it's an antwerp!@  kill it!@#@$%%

creed:          AAAAAAAAAAAAH!@#*!@$!@$!*&!*#&%*#@%&!*#&%

phorce:         it's godzilla!

hooch:          dot novasys dot com.

creed:          AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH#@$!$@(!*$!($*!(@*!$!@(*$

edicius:        someone kick creed or something.

        belial ninja-kicks creed in the face, creed passes out.

mogel:          hi guys.

trip:           greetings, grandmaster m.

mercuri:        poi is a gooey purple substance that is considered a culinary
                delight in most parts of hawaii.  i like poi.

mogel:          uhm, it's cold out here, and the plot's dwindling.  let's go
                inside.

        exeunt.

.. scene three ..

        the crowd is wreaking havoc inside the abandoned bowling emporium.
        belial and trip are trying to shove phorce into the ball return,
        hooch is trying to get the knife out of his back, mogel is playing
        with his silly laptop, creed is passed out on the floor.

mogel:          i glued my feet to the ceiling.  eat sand.

trip:           moo.  that's what cows say.  they say, "mooooooo" and the
                farmers just sit there.  cows are silly.

        creed awakens.

mogel:          hi creed.

creed:          AAAAH!@$)!*#$% oh, hi mogel.  i didn't expect you to come.

        the group re-gathers, upon finding that phorce is just a little too
        big to fit in the ball return.

trip:           hey, creed woke up.

belial:         hi creed.

phorce:         uh, guys, i can't feel my arm.  i think you broke some blood
                vessels or something.

creed:          sorry, i must have dozed off or something.  so.  how is
                everybody?

phorce:         my hand is turning blue.

creed:          uhm, this bowling alley is boring.  let's go eat somewhere.
                anyone got a car?

        <silence>

creed:          uhm, let's walk.  walking is more fun than yahtzee, except
                when you play australian-style.

        everybody leaves.  yay.

.. scene four ..

        the crowd is sitting in a booth at a diner.  mogel is playing with
        his laptop, trying to compile a dto special-release.  belial and trip
        are trying to see how many pringles they can fit down phorce's pants.
        hooch is trying to get the throwing star out of his back.  edicius
        is mushing cheese between his toes.  creed is just-a whistlin' dixie.

trip:           uh, food.  someone get a waitress.

phorce:         yoo-hoo!@$  waitress!@#$

        a gum-smacking waitress approaches.

waitress:       yeah, what do you all want?

mogel:          RRRRRRRR-RABBIT STEW!@#!@#!@%(!#&%*!#&%

phorce:         grape jell-o, please.

trip:           one live cow, por favor.

hooch:          i'd like a rotten corpse, al dente.

belial:         give me mozzarella sticks or give me death.

waitress:       yo.  is that all?

mahatma ghandi: touch me, love me, feel my tender, yet bony breasts.  love
                them.  worship me.  i am ghandi.

waitress:       ok, then.  15 minutes.

        waiter leaves.

creed:          m0gm0gm0gm0gm0gm0gm0gm0gm0gm0gm0gm0g.

        satan rushes through the door, looks around the diner.  upon seeing
        the ziners at a table, he approaches and speaks.

satan:          hey guys.

creed:          hey satan.

<r0oth4x0r>     dcc me saten

satan:          uhm, creed.  can i borrow a couple bucks, i need gas money.

belial:         don't do it, man!@@!# he's trying to con you out of your
                soul!@#!!$

creed:          uhm... sure, satan.  have a seat, i'll buy you some food.

satan:          thanks, man.

        satan sits down with the group.

waitress:       ok, here's your food.  one soup, one grape jell-o, one live
                cow, one rotten corpse, and one order of mozzarella sticks.

hooch:          i ordered that al dente, you whore!@#%@#%

satan:          it's ok, man.  i'll take care of her.

        satan incinerates the waitress.  the group gnarls down their food.

edicius:        yum.  that was food.

creed:          yep.  what now?

satan:          let's go to 7-11.

        everybody stands up and leave.

mogel:          i'm not done with my soup!@$!% bastards!@$@$^

.. scene five ..

        the crowd is at a 7-11.  everyone is drinking out of the slurpee
        machine.

hooch:          glugglugglugglugglugglugglug.

trip:           h3y guys!@#!@# satan iz here!@#!@# wh0a!@# elete!@$#

phorce:         my arm just fell off, guys.  maybe we should get an ambulance
                or something.

indian clerk:   are you boys going to buy something or are you just going to
                drink out of my slurpee machine all night?

        satan incinerates the clerk.  mogel takes the stand as clerk and
        starts to play with the 7-11 store computer.

kris:           my name is d-a-double d-y-m-a-c, there ain't another brother
                bad as me.

trip:           this is boring.  i'm going to make a bomb.

        trip begins the construction of a bomb in the corner of the store.

mogel:          d00dz!@#  i've almost hacked root on this ware!@$$ eleete!$

hooch:          glugglugglugglugglugglugglugglugglugglug.

belial:         uhm, hooch is starting to get bigger.  he's drinking a lot
                of that slurpee stuff.  black cherry, too.  that flavor
                sucks.

talking cow:    i believe that eastern european nations shifting to a
                free-market economy may not actually be a good idea.

trip:           the bomb is complete.  seeing as the plot of this story is
                completely dead, i guess i'll blow this joint up.

mogel:          wait!@$# d00dz!@$ i'm almost done k0ding this virus!@$ and
                i gotta upload tha dig-dug game!@!@#!
