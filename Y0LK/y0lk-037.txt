y0lk #37: careening through cyberspace at a slug-like rate
---(yay)-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        ello... this is creed again, apparently the other y0lk writers have
given up writing, and i am hereby responsible for y0lk entirely.  once again,
we are in a state of slug-like motion... the zine is toiled over by our one
remaining writer, me, at a pace that you hyperactive zine-types cannot stand.
i would feel bad about that if i cared how you felt.  aww.

        i was just looking over some of our remarkable issue titles in the
y0lk oh-so-convenient index, and i realized something.  in issue number 16,
"how to blow your nuts out with cornstarch and orangina," i did not tell youze
how to blow your nuts out with cornstarch and orangina!  you have my humblest
apology.  and, due to this recently-recognized disappointment i have given
you, i present the secret to mankind's prevailance.  how to blow your nuts out
with cornstarch and orangina.

SPECIAL ANRKi SECTION: how to blow your nuts out with cornstarch and orangina
---(ElETe)---------------------------------------------------------------------

what yew will need: cornstarch                     01/03/96 (miercoles) 12:53pm
                    a bottle of orangina                     ElETe aUtHr: creed
                    a standard u.s. army hand grenade

        STEP 0NE: take your orangina bottle.  examine the fine texture and
                  shape of it.  after you have adequately savored the quality
                  of the bottle, drink the orangina.  it is tasty, is it not?

        STEP TW0: fill the orangina bottle with cornstarch and put the cap back
                  on.  put it on a bookshelf, or some other place where you can
                  see it.  now you have a beautiful orangina bottle, filled
                  cornstarch!  praise the gods!  praise m0gel!

        STEP THREE: pull the pin out of the hand grenade and drop it down your
                    pants.  wait about 3.5 seconds for impact, and KAB00M!
                    hopefully, the explosion will blow your nuts out.

        STEP F0UR: relax, and enjoy the results of your project.  your nuts
                   have been blown out entirely, and you have a wonderful
                   orangina bottle filled with cornstarch to look at.  yay!

        i understand, that may have been a bit too etweet for you to handle.
i'll give you a few seconds to catch your breath.

---(puff)----------------------------------------------------------------------

        well, now you know the true secret.  great.  i am made of shamrocks.
geez, i have nothing left to say, and yet, i feel like i need to write more for
this issue.  a lot more.  well, i just read two issues of cDc, given to me by
mogel.  they were pretty good... as usual, i didn't read all of them, just
select parts that looked cool.  and what i did read was consistently neat-o.
so i guess i'm just like everyone else now.  i'm writing a zine so i can be
like a cDc elito.  bah.  dto is better.

---(woo)-----------------------------------------------------------------------

        i am el cid!  master of light!  protector of the righteous people of
nicaragua!  i wear a blue spandex suit and a big yellow cape!  i am skilled in
the arts of karate!

        yep, under the influence of uncontrollable boredom, i now reveal my
alternate identity.  the popular hispanic superhero known as EL CID, protector
of the righteous, is actually just me in a blue spandex jogging suit and a cape
i bought at a retail store.  i hope you are not too shocked to know that all
the y0lks you have read in the past have been overseen by the mighty el cid.
sorry.

---(woo again)-----------------------------------------------------------------

        i'm sad to say that this issue is running out of steam, so i'm going to
conclude it early.  don't be too disappointed.  sorry.  bye.
