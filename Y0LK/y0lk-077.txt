 .. horror story ..
 .. by: one eared bunny ..

        new, yet somewhat familiar.  he was waiting for this moment all his
 life.  he was near the top, close enough to chew the gum on the bottom of
 the _real_ executives' shoes.  with this glory, came money, which mostly
 went to his over-priced apartment, & which he really did not take a
 liking to.  his neighbors were noisy, the location was far from his work,
 & the only reason he stayed was to keep his image, for this was the
 living that contained the supposed elitists of society.  as for the
 apartment itself, it was quaint, dark, & dejected, to match the exterior,
 as well as the city.  despite the fact that he despised his apartment, he
 often left out into the city, spending little time inside, so it bothered
 him none.

        for months he kept with the same rhythm, until winter.  the city
 became dull & cold, & not being able to keep from the effects to the
 human body, he became very ill.  he was missing work, almost to the point
 where he would loose his job.  this also meant he couldn't get out of his
 apartment.  sleep was minimal, for his neighbors kept their routines,
 making, what seemed to him, as much noise as they were capable of.  this
 went on for a week, until he was fed up, more with the apartment above him
 than anyone or anywhere else.  it almost sounded as if they were remodeling
 it.  he could do one of two things; go ask the supervisor what was going on,
 or go up to the floor above & see for himself, like a man.  well, he of
 course went to go get an employee.

        "morning sir, what can i do for you?" you could tell he was new,
 perhaps today his first day on the job.

        "i have a complaint about the apartment above me.  they seem to be
 making large amounts of noise, which prevent me from getting any sleep."
 his voice was course from the work of the flu residing inside him.

        "what apartment do you live in sir?"

        "floor three, apartment seven."

        "that would be apartment four-seven that you're complaining about
 then?" he nodded, with a slight cough, more as if he was clearing his 
 throat.  the employee flips through a booklet of what was obviously a list
 of people living within, "sorry sir, nobody lives in apartment four-seven
 at this current moment, should i have someone go check out the rest of the
 floor for you?"

        "are they remodeling it by any chance?"

        he flips through a few more pages, "sorry.  sure you don't want
 anyone to check it out?"

        "thanks, but that's quite all right.  maybe it's just this flu
 getting to me," trying to make a joke out it.

        "no problem, if you need anything else, just call."

        since he was out of his apartment, he took it upon himself to go
 look, even though he needed to go lay down, for the dreadful disease he had
 was keeping up to worthiness, making him weak.  perhaps he should have had
 someone else check it out.

        he had made it, & the noise was louder than ever up here, it seemed
 odd that nobody else would report it, assuming they too, were hearing it.
 perhaps he was going mad, becoming an insane freak from staying in day after
 day.  the stress was getting to him, he had to get this over with & get
 back to his apartment to rest.  he knocked on the door, it opened a bit for
 it had not been closed all the way in the first place.  he peaked in, seeing
 no one.  however, something did catch his eye.

        the light was very bright, he had to squint to see the surroundings
 of the apartment.  papers, what seemed to be clothing, & rotten, what he
 hoped was, food, were all about.  it was a regular mess.  at risk of
 violating apartment policy, he went to get help again, he did not want to
 intrude on whoever's party was going on.  he again went downstairs.

        "hello again sir." the employee was almost too cheerful.

        "on second thought, can you have someone check that apartment out for
 me?"

        "sure.  by the way, you are aware that you can call down here, no
 need to walk this far in your condition."

        he wanted to hit him, & show him what condition he was in.  instead,
trying to sound least sarcastic as possible, "thanks for the reminder."

        "well, i'm not busy right now, i could go check it for you?"

        "if you mind, may i accompany you?"

        "not at all, be my guest."

        they both headed towards the fourth floor.  when him & the employee
 approached, it was quiet.  they both entered the apartment, the empty 
 apartment.  nothing, nobody was there.  indeed, he was going mad. 

        "sorry sir, nothings here, perhaps you should go lay down for
 awhile."

        he felt as if the he was receiving an i told you so.  either way, 
 "perhaps you're right, i need some sleep."

        "very well sir.  need help getting to your apartment?"

        as nice as the employee was being, or attempting to be, he couldn't
 stand the service, he wanted to be left alone, especially now.  "no thanks,
 i am going to sit for a minute."

        "all right sir, well i must get back to my post, hope you get well."

        he sat down on the uncomfortable couch waiting on his breath to come
 back.  while doing so, the noise returned.  there was no way he could sit
 now.  he got up & took a look, he remembered the door being locked, but as
 before, the door wasn't even closed all the way.  the apartment had return
 to it's previous condition, more in the middle of the process.  items were
 being tossed from where the light was being emitted, & landing in about
 the same place he remembered seeing them.

        he was going to get to the bottom of this.  he entered the bright,
 messy room, the wall was missing, it was either an oversized lamp or a
 portal of some sort.  he walked up to the light, staring it down.  he was
 dripping with sweat, his bones were shaking, & the fear in his eyes was
 beyond evident.  he stepped through against all sensible thought, &
 everything disappeared.

        no phear. 

        he finished up, with an affirmative nod, "very good jenson, but do 
 you really think it'll fit on a t-shirt?"
