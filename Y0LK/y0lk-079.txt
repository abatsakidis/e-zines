 "the ewok rant"
 by - taraxis
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------        

        there's been a lot of yapping amongst movie buffs about the upcoming
 star wars movies.  most people think they will be incredible movies since
 the original three were, but i have doubts.  why?  because return of the
 jedi ended on a flop for two reasons : luke skywalker & the damn ewoks.
 i'll save pretty farm boy for another article, but it's time for the cute
 little furry endorians to phear@#$!

        in case anyone has missed this movie, it ends like this.  the rebel
 alliance launches a massive assault on the death star, a fierce new
 battlestation built by the empire, an evil, dictatorial regime.  in order to
 fly into the death star & destroy it, the rebels need to detonate the shield
 generator protecting it on a near-by moon.  there they meet the ewoks, a
 cute little tribe of munchkins who help them accomplish this.  the ewoks &
 the rebels win & blow the generator, & the rebels go on to win the movie &
 deal a crushing blow to the empire.

        lucas & co. messed up big time with the ewoks.  they suck big time,
 & i can tell you why.  first of all, they are cute.  cute things suck, like
 ex-girlfriends.  racoons are cute, but they'll bite your finger off.  ouch!
 second, can you imagine the stink that would eminate from an entire tribe of
 furry woodl& creatures?  *ugh*  yet princess leia never complained at all.
 maybe alderaans have no sense of smell, or maybe princess leia smelled just
 as terrible.  no where in any of the three movies were any of the characters
 shown taking showers, except luke after he was found half-dead in the show &
 stuck in an animal, but his bath was only for medical reasons.

        the most glaring problem though is toward the end of rotj.  perhaps
 this stupidity can be best shown by the following :

                ewoks                           the empire on endor
 -------------------------------------------------------------------

 number:         a tribe.                        a few legions.

 size:           a couple feet.                  man-sized.

 armor:          fur.                            high-tech lightweight
                                                 battle armor.

 weapons:        arrows, rocks.                  high-precision laser
                                                 rifles.

 training:       archery & rock throwing.      years of elite training.

 additional
 equipment:      a few logs.                     a few at-st's, spitting
                                                 hot blasts of firey
                                                 death.

 greatest
 achievement:    a nice village with a great     a shield generator
                 system of ladders & bridged.  capable of protecting an
                                                 object 160 miles in dia-
                                                 meter (the death star).

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

        obviously, the empire should have totally dominated the ewoks.  but
 no!  the lameness here should not even have to be explained.  but i'll do it
 anyway with a few points.

        1) arrows can't go through battle armor.

        2) the force with which an ewok can chuck a rock is minimal to
           begin with.

        3) tossed stones can not penetrate battle armor.

        the death star brings up another issue : fallout!&*#!&  the thing
 blew up.  it is silly to think that the entire 160-mile diameter sphere
 disintegrated into miniscule pieces that would burn up in the atmosphere.
 what about radiation?  the thing had a huge fusion reactor.  doesn't that
 count for anything?  the entire planet should have been reduced to either
 ash or a barren landscape.  it is not unreasonable to think that at least a
 50-mile wide cube of the death star would survive & crash to the surface.
 it would not be going that fast, but it wouldn't need to.  the last thing
 any surviving imperials on the station would see as they hit the ground
 would be a smiling, rejoicing ewok, because it was built right above their
 village.

        if they make any movies that take place after return of the jedi, i
 hope that they first redo the ending to it.  ewoks - lose!  rebel
 alliance - lose!  that little punk-ass skywalker should die too, along with
 his furry companions.  what a dumb ending to the greatest movies of all
 time.
