y0lk #98: what i've seen of y0lk really sucks (kojak)
---(y0lk #98)-----------------------------------------------------------------

        okay. here's the deal.  i decided to write a y0lk explaining to the
y0lk readership why a lot of what you're reading isn't that good.  i'm not
here to advertise another zine, and i'm not here to chastize anyone in
particular.  but what i am going to say is that what i've seen of y0lk really
sucks.

        i myself have been writing paper zines for almost a year now, and
reading/writing e'zines for just as long or longer.  no, that's *not* a long
time, i'll agree with you.  but it's enough time for me to get a simple idea
of what's right and what's wrong in the publishing of zines.

        i have long been exposed (both in stuff sent in for review in my paper
zine and e'zines i've read) to bad writing that really shows no pretense of
thought.  i've long put up with this type of writing, because i figure that
there will always be someone who doesn't write well who wants an outlet.
where will this person find an outlet if it weren't for bad zines?

        i'm not going to say that i like my writing.  most of the stuff i
write i pick apart in my mind hundreds of times, and a lot of the stuff in
draft#1 doesnt make it by draft#5 or 6.  that's what re-writes are for; to
*correct your mistakes*.  i do.  you should.  do you?  think about it.

        back to the bad zines & writing: consider the average intelligence
of humans.  now take that intelligence level and grapple with the fact that
50% of our race is WORSE OFF, intellectually.  really makes you wanna cry,
doesn't it?  well, so does a lot of the writing i see in bad zines/e'zines.
and sometimes, from what i've seen, y0lk is no exception to this rule.

        i really wish that a magazine or e'zine would continue with the
integrity that it sets out.  a standard of quality.  i know that when i write,
i try my hardest to create something that others can respect - something that
i can read .. something people can learn from.  i know that most zine writers,
if not all, have those same intentions when they start - skill or not.  those
that do have the skill sometimes lose their patience with their work and lose
their standards, and some writers just don't have the skill at all.  i am not
going to place myself in either category, nor will i try to place anyone else
in one.  that's for you, the y0lk reader to decide.  but, as an added note for
general zine writers and e'zine writers;  please think about what you're
saying.  what you're trying to say.  because if it doesn't really have a
point - why waste everyone's time?

        as a general note to the e'zine community.. everybody and their mother
has had to have a zine in the past few months.  i know, spring fever gets
everyone excited about their writing - but let's work towards a common goal.
there are a few zines, and you know which ones they are, that meet or exceed
the goals they set for themselves.  let's put our collective talents together
to make those zines better.  i would rather read one lengthy, quality zine
than several shorter spur-of-the-moment bad zines.  just because you're a
writer doesn't mean you have to have your own e'zine.

        now, i myself will soon fall prey to the need to have my own zine -
for i have found someone who is completely compatible with me (not a girl-
friend, silly!#), both in writing and personality styles.  you will see it.
you will hopefully enjoy it.  but there is one thing that i will be sure to
do, and that's ASSURE QUALITY CONTROL.  please, when you're considering
writing for y0lk or another other zine, keep those three words in the back of
your mind.  thank you.

---(samurai's note)-----------------------------------------------------------

        a rebuttal:

        yes, errors, mistakes, bad writing - they plague us all.  however, i
feel that y0lk has taken this "badness" and made it into something much better:
a truly subgenius or dada ideal of "good is bad."  prime examples are cheesy
(ed wood) sci-fi movies (cult classics like "plan nine from outer space," "mars
needs women," and "panic in year zero"), girlie17 and gumby poetry - you can't
help but be entertained by the like.

        every now and then, however, y0lk gets some good stuff.  y0lk, having
no submissions policy (but not for long..), can't help it.  the reader takes
an active role in "sorting out the shit."  don't like the unbridled, never-
before-written-of teen angst of our y0lk "rookie writers?"  well..

        FUCK YOU.

        sometimes it can be entertaining.
