%%%%%%%%%%% y0lk #25: ethereal experiences for perverted pyromaniacs %%%%%%%%%%
--(dog)------------------------------------------------------------------------

        well, this isn't very y0lkish, but i have to write about it.  last
night a very strange thing happened to me.

        i was sitting at the computer, playing some mud, and listening to the
song "pets" by porno for pyros on the radio.  the song was coming in quite
normally, actually a bit clear for the radio... and it began and ended as it
would have normally, but after the song something strange happened.  i realized
that i wasn't listening to the radio.  the house was completely silent, being
it 12:00 at night.

        but the strange thing is... i heard the whole damn song!  it just
orchestrated in my head, and it was very weird.  i was tapping my foot against
the monitor and enjoying the song and everything... but i wasn't listening to
it, just imagining... quite a vivid imagination, i guess.

        anyway, i had to write about it.  that's where i got the title,
"ethereal experiences for perverted pyromaniacs."  it's a stupid title, i know.
all the titles are stupid.  i'm stupid.

--(aww)------------------------------------------------------------------------

        in reference to hooch's complaint about dos editor and reading my
issues, use acidview to view, aciddraw to write.  they're great.  plus high
ascii is right there if you're writing.  i know.  i'm a stupid little
doodleboy.

        y0lk #25, wow.  we're 1/4 of the way there to 100 issues.  that's
materialism.  race through the course of the zine, leave the quality to those
who care.  bah.  we're getting to 100.  we shall outdo hoe by letting them
outdo us.  that didn't make sense, even to me.

--(squished ziners)------------------------------------------------------------

        there are these band lockers at school.  well, this is hard to explain,
but they're big enough to put maybe one small body.  like those midgets at
school that look like visiting kindergarteners, but it turns out they're
seniors... well...

        anyway, i was bored today.  so were my friends.  so i squished myself
in one of these band lockers, and motioned for the smallest of us to join me.
he squished in next to me, and after about 5 minutes worth of struggle, we got
the door closed.  yay!

        but that's not the half of it.  we sat around for a while and decided
to try to fit another friend in.  so i got in with the original friend, and we
sat in the same positions, as the third of us climbed in.  he contorted his
body so well.  i could hear his joints crack like tree branches.  and he got
in!  it was amazing.  his head was in my ass.  and we stayed there for 10
minutes, mostly because we couldn't get out.  some schmuck locked us in.

        HIS HEAD WAS IN MY ASS FOR TEN MINUTES.

--(ahhhhh)---------------------------------------------------------------------

        you know something?  i live for meaninglessness.  pip is god, black
francis is a weiner.  no joke.  if i liked quality writing, i'd join dto.
so catch on to the new fad, kids!  it's cool to be a dork!  it's okay if you
suck!  see, that's why i like edicius and jonas.  that's why we all do.  well,
i hope we all do.

        if we all don't, fuck you.  honestly, i can't ever finish a dto issue.
i could hardly ever finish a hoe issue.  but gasp i could finish.  gasp ruled
cuz pip honestly, HONESTLY, _HONESTLY_ didn't care.  just like myself.  heh.
where the hell is pip, anyway?

--(drunk as fuck, naked in a ditch somewhere with his dick in his hands)-------

        ohh yeah... well.  that was some exclusive shit up there.  if you don't
know about the early '95 zine scene, you're lost.  but i hope that touched some
of the big zine writers out there who spend hours on zines and say they don't
give a fuck.  because they do.

        heh, i'm dumping shit on people that work hard.  is that communism?
well, close to it.  not really.  ugh, shut up dave.

--(yeah, shut up dave)---------------------------------------------------------

        ok, fine.  bye.

        (french movie ending)
