y0lk #94: spinsane's story
--(phear it)-----------------------------------------------------------------

I have a nice story to tell...  Its fairly boring, and its
definately pointless.  It fits in with y0lk well. Phear it.
Notice there are no dividers in this text. Thats because I'm 
elite.
I choose not to use dividers.. instead, I use little penises, 
penii if you will... pointed at a disco dancer. Sure, you 
_could_ say that is a divider, but then I'd call you a l4m3r 
w4nn4b3 31337 h4X0r and beat your ass..
no i wouldn't.. I'm lame.
I'd get mad though.

Maybe. If I was tired, I'd hit my computer.

If I was drunk, I could yell "jOO FucKiNG commiE bAShhhstad.." 
and throw my bottle of Jim Beam at the computer screen, 
breaking the bottle into a thousand pieces of elite glass.

I see how these y0lk guys do it.. This is easier than my sister
(who BTW, I am willing to trade for phat ansis and/or kr3d1t5 
for warez. Mail me  carne@cas.usf.edu )

I thought I had a story to tell... But I decided against it.
Why waste my k-kool story of computer espionage, high powered 
weapons and kinky, leather bound sex for this issue of y0lk? I 
almost have enough of this bullshit to get release as an elito
debut in y0lk.

You have to love the y0lk crew, we're an honest bunch. 
Well, I am at least. I'm letting you know that this is total 
crap.  Hooch would say it wasn't, steal all your money and 
cough a big wad of phlegm at you. =)

um.. damn, this is like 39 lines already. phat.

I've noticed that a large ammount of #ansi banditos are ravers.
This is a good thing. Ravers are cool. Because we promote a 
promiscuos lifestyle, filled with drugs, cute little easy 
chicks and dancing under the influence of ecstacy. If you are 
a self-professed druggie, and haven't done ecstacy, you're 
missing out. It is by far the best drug out there. It roXors.

I like "Interactive" Porno games. I have an 80 meg HDD, nO 
cd-rom, 4 megs of ram and a key board with a broken enter key, 
so its hard for me to use any of them. BUT! I just got one 
called "Interactive Gerls: Teresa" or something. 

Boy. Its a really lame "game". Let me explain the plot.
Teresa comes to your house.
The only option you have is to take her coat.
Then you have a conversation.
The only question you can ask her that leads anywhere is "Do 
        phear my 0-d4y p0rn0 m0vi3z?" (or something).
She then fingers herself (this is a good part)
Then she showers, and you pick 3 gifts for her out of a whopping
        7 total!!!! Yes! 7 TOTAL GIFTS AT YOUR DISPOSAL!! pHEEL
        THE INTERACTIVITY@!@#$@$!@
Then something else happens.
(get the hand lotion ready now)
You give her the gifts. And she either turns you down or 
        fuxors you.

Thats it.

exit the realm of the 0-d4y p0rn0 g4m3

8=========/o>=====|) _0>   <-- this one is wearing sunglasses
          /\         <\   

Thats about all I can think of.
I wish I was as cool as hooch (h00ch i mean), or creed. 
They're funny.
I just whack out to the Jetsons. DawT3r jOOd-3!#!@ jAne the 
whore..<cool theme music>.

Are there any good cartoons on now days? I haven't watched 
them in like years. But back in the day, Transformers, and 
MASK were tearing shit up. Now its just .. hmm.. I dunnno.. I 
can't even name a cartoon now. Maybe like, porno cartoons.. 
those rock. Fritz the Cat is cool. He's 0 Day cool. Everyone 
should join channel #fritz and change there nicks to fritz1, 
fritz2, etc.. and go spread the word of pOrnOgraphy.

eye yam out of skewl.
phear

What else.... hmmm... If I was a robot.. I think I'd have cool 
buzzsaws for hands. That way I could go up to people and cut 
em up. And I could rob payphones, and ph34x0r. And I could cut 
cheese logs, and throw them at people. No wait, i couldn't 
throw them at people. I need opposable thumbs AND buzzsaws.. 
then I could whack off and throw stuff...

QUESTIONS FOR THE ELITE... A SERIES

Do robots jizz motor oil.

Why is it that eyes in pictures are always looking at me?

Is my 2 inch erect penis really normal, or is my mom playing
        with my head?

Why are other people's sisters always fine. And 10 years old.

How come weiner dogs are so cool? Is it because they have 
        weiner in there names? Or because they trade warez?

How come I write such pointless, stupid shit, although I'm 17 
        and should have much more maturity than this?

How come at night, I hear aliens in my head fighting?

Is that normal?

If you get that too, email me...
