        more y0lk.  what more could you POSSIBLY ask for?  i, personally,
can't think of anything more... worthwhile than y0lk.  life-enriching
experiences.  maybe not YOURS, but mine.. i'm sure that when i apply for a
job, someone's going to say, "You used to write for Y0LK?!  I know you!@!"

-------------------------------------------------------------: yah, rite :---

        no, really and truly.. i mean, think about it.  in the future, we're
gonna rule the world!  the dial-kinder of today will be the ruff-and-tuff
corporate leaders of tomorrow!  millions of ex-dork-now-a-millionaire bill
gates types will run the world of tomorrow!

1. Get a liquid medicine bottle such as Robitussin (R), Empty half of the
Bottle and then put Bleach in the bottle, and then when someone trys
to take the medicine! They're dead.

2. Get some rat poison and put it into a pepper container in a resturant or
any other place, and then when someone trys to put it on there food, DEAD!

3. This way to poison reqiures a HOT day and someone who likes to TAN alot!
Get a bottle of there favorite sun block or whatever and dillute it with
water, After they fall asleep or anything in the sun thinking that they will
control the burn! They are going to get sun poison!

-If you are thinking about joining or having your bbs distro for ViGiLaNTe
iNC. call Interactive BBS (201)340-21XX and leave a message on the matrix
to the sysop reguarding Vi and Look for the apps, hopefully by then
we will have you be able to download the apps from the matrix

        that individual's handle has been changed to protect his privacy..
i don't think that the individual who wrote that file would like to admit to
his lame past.

        yes, i liked the sun poison part too.

        Now, this is my plans to make a bomb from butwipe paper.

Here it is!

Materials:

 matches
 a used, clean toilet paper roll
 some toilet paper, unuser
 some plastic coated playing cards
---------------------------------------
1. Go outside, unless you have really
extensive home insurance

2. Make sure toilet paper roll is clean (has no toilet paper on it.)

3. Rip four playing cards (It will not
   work if they're not plastic-coated)

4. Stuff shredded cards inside middle oftoilet paper roll

5. Shred a little toilet paper

6. Place toilet paper equally on both
sides in roll

7. Light toilet paper inside roll

8. Run

Note: of course, this will work better
if you have soaked cards in gasoline.
This is not necessary, but it will blow
up better!

----------------------------------------------------------: WOW!@!@!@!@! :---

        GO TO SCHOOL AND TRY THAT RIGHT NOW!!! YEAH!!!  ANNARKIE!! YEAH!!
THAT'S IT!!!

-------------------------------------------------------------: surprise! :---

        i used to be a member of that group.

        not surprised?

        oh well.  i didn't write anything, anyway.. i think i was on senior
staff, or something.  i was gonna write.

        one more?  okay.  then i go to sleep.

                     **** Getting Past Caller-ID!! ****
                                nomeD .rD

        Are you tired of pranking people and then having them call you back
saying something like "I've got your number." Well, big fuckin' deal- i've
got yours too.  Anyway, back to the point.  No more Caller ID to interrupt
your much enjoyed phone pranks!!

                              ## HOW IT WORKS ##

        Just pick up the phone, and when you get the dial tone, press
*67 (If you have a rotary or pulse-dial phone, press 1167), wait for
another dial tone, and dial your call!!

                              @@ WHAT HAPPENS @@

        Instead of your # showing up on their little caller-ID thing,
instead of your number, it says "PRIVATE".  Simple Enough!!

                      BEST OF ALL, IT'S TOTALLY FREE!!!!!

Also, IT blocks Call Return (*69) so they can't call you back!


                              %% DRAWBACKS %%

        Only a few setbacks here:

1.  There is now Caller-ID Block BLOCK, where if you try to call someone
    using caller-id block, and they have the Caller-ID Block BLOCK, you
    get a recording saying the person doesn't accept calls with caller-ID
    block.

2.  If the person has Call Block, Select Forward, or Ultra Forward, there
    are still ways they can get your #, but 99% of the people who have it
    have no clue how to get your # from it, so don't worry.

3.  They can always use Call Trace (*57) and log your # to Ma Bell's trace
    log.  But don't fret, the phone co. requires at least 3 traces before
    they can give it to the cops.  So don't prank TOO many times!!

                                                Have Fun!!

--------------------------------------------------------: one more thing :---


        don't try to find out who these people are.  if you can figure out
who these people are, i'd be surprised as i did my best to try to protect
their identities.  i believe they've all changed their handles since then.
in fact, i just realized that i'm probably the only one on the memberlist
that never changed my handle.  i'm forever cursed as being on the ViGiLaNTe
iNCoRPoRaTeD memberlist.  ack.  i guess that's just another handicap i'll
have to conquer on my way to being *MORE* k-rad than i already am.

-------------------------------------------------------------: toot toot :---

        oh.  and *NO*, "LLiK DaoR" *ISN'T* what radman used to call himself
before he quit hp and started that little art project he's still working on..
what'd he call it?  LSD or something?  i fergot.. oh well, it's not really
important anyway.

time for me to go beddy-bye.  damn.  i need a DIZ.  ack.. that'll suck.

note to creed:

i made the index so that us dos-edit readers can read the whole thing. grr..

----------------------------------------------------------------: index! :---

umm... have you thought of putting it with three columns, like number, title,
then AUTHOR?  the part of the index that says "1-8 is by creed, 12, 13, 15 by
hooch," is kinda.. ummm.. weird.  i dunno.. maybe only put indexes every 5 or
10 issues.. or maybe.. i have no idea what my point is. well, do something
with the index.  title: citrus fruit for sale
