y0lk         "the arcade avenger"     (yeah right, this isn't a dto rip-off)
number 80:   by - shadow tao          

        i had just finished throwing discus at a track meet, so i decided
 that on my way home, i would stop at a mall.  there was no real reason, i
 guess.  just a brainwashed consumer zombified into returning to the
 capatalist mother ship.  i made my way across the parking lot and onto one
 of the side ramps/entrances. i stood there for a second deliberating where i
 should visit first.

        i was 16, i headed for the arcade.

        i had been going to quite a few track meets that month, and hadn't
 been in the arcade in a while.  the first thing one does when trying to
 catch up for lost time in an arcade is scan for new games.  scan.  scan.
 there's one.

        'samurai spirit,' i believe it was called.

        basic japanese-style fighting game.  i picked a guy with big hair.
 first enemy is always the putz.  win one.  win two.  on to the second
 challenge.  clinkclink.  "newuh chawangerr!!" (it had a bad japanese
 accent.)

        i looked down, and there he was.  he couldn't have been more than,
 say, 10.  a little white punk with neon clothes.  and a speech impediment.
 he opened his mouth, and out poured the ancient challenge of arcade lore:

        "ahm donna kicks yo ath." (it was a severe speech impediment)

        the gloves were off.  he chose a kabuki-looking character with a huge
 tounge.  it was the eternal struggle:  big hair vs. steven tyler.  

        we started off with basic combo-search moves.  we both ran through
 our mnemonic libraries of mortal kombat and street fighter moves, only to
 find that early on in the first battle, he was severely kicking my ath.  it
 was just a game.  a mere game.  but as anyone who has ever taken an arcade
 challenge, these were just words.  it's not just a game, it's your
 techno-manliness.

        yes, just like every other thing we males do, an arcade challenge
 with a stranger is a measurement of manhood.  i couldn't lose to this 10
 year old.  i would never be able to look at a screen again.

        the second round went a little better.  the kid and i were both down
 to about a micron of health.  unfortunately, a background character ran by
 at that second and threw a bomb at him.  a bomb that, fortunately for me, he
 did not see.  boom.  round two to elvis man.

        by the start of round three, i had somehow tensed my innards to the
 point of vomiting.  the pulse of the challenge was racing through my veins,
 yanking every bit of strength i had into my hands.  we started with common
 opening moves.  he made a few good hits, i retaliated with a barrage of
 attacks.  we were both nearing death, but unlike my opponents character, my
 character was actually turning red.

        ironicly, so was i.

        "awwyeah. i'm kickin yo ath.  i'm so cool, i'm hoth.  wath my fisths
 of fyuwee.  kickin' yo ath.  whoopin' yo big fath ath.  wathout lardath."

        let me explain the motive behind what exactly next, so it doesn't
 seem that i was being an even bigger asshole than i was.  i was deeply into
 discus training with my father, who was an old pro at discus.  one of the
 things that my father had shown me early in my discus career was the
 technique of 'release.'  the release of a discus wasn't just the simple
 motion of letting go.  it was the technique of storing energy in the pit of
 your stomach during warm-up.  that energy is then distributed through your
 body during your in-ring movements and some breathing techniques.  when it
 was actually time to throw the discus, the energy would explode throughout
 your body and into the discus.  with this explosion, somehow, a murderous
 scream would erupt from deep in your stomach.  people who i competed against
 would sometimes be intimidated by this scream that they would not throw.
 some of them wouldn't even stay around me.  it was such a physically
 exhausting process that sometimes i would pass out from the exertion.  it
 takes a lot of control to harness the power of the release technique, and
 control was still something i was working on.

        how unfortunate for that 10 year old.

        i had somehow started the release technique unconciously.  my
 breathing became labored.  my muscles were tensed beyond their usual
 capacity.  i was focused on beating the living shit out of this little
 child, whether it was on the screen or otherwise.

        then, somehow, i found a serious combo.  my character became engulfed
 in flame, swooping down onto the big-tongued kabuki warrior like a flaming
 sword from hell.  that was the end of kabuki.

        that also happened to be the moment i lost control of all that
 energy.  i let out one of the awefullest banshee screams i have ever heard
 in my entire life.  the last i saw of that little kid, he was running for
 the exit, dripping all the way.

        oddly, i felt powerful again.  i had destroyed a little kid in a
 video game and managed to scare him to urination in the process.  nevermind
 that i was standing in a puddle of this little boys fear.

        i was avenged.
