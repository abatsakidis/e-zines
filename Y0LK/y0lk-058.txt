 "my place, or yours?"
 submitted by - mercuri

        dinner at my house, to me, is the most dreaded part of the day.  my
 dad has this silly notion in his head that he is _funny_.  he constantly
 bombards me with 'jokes' trying to earn my respect or something, not sure.
 every night, it never fails, the conversation goes something like this;

        "hey jay.. what's up?"

        "nothing much..."

        at this point, if the TV's not on, i insist it's goes on to break the
 silence.

        "ow!@  god!  that's hot!"  i say...

        "you always cook it to hot.. hun!"  exclaims my father (which is the
 truth)

        while i let the food cool off, my dad tries for some more winning
 conversation...

        "anything happen at school today?"

        "nope."

        he know's that is always the answer, because if i told him what
 happened, he'd probably fall into a state of shock.. that's how he is...
 one time i told him about a fight there was in school, man, what a mistake,
 I was there answering questions for another half-hour.

        Now that the rite's of the table have passed, food has cooled, school
 question's ask.. this is what happened today.

        "mmm.. hun, this is great!"  dad

        "and it's good for you, too!" mom

        ( it's salmon loaf, smells like crap, i won't touch it. )

        "you should have some, jay!"

        "that's okay, if my nose doesn't trust it, my stomach won't."

        "oh.. c'mon, put some catsup on it!  mask the smell!"  dad

        "that's disgusting." me

        "it was a joke!  you never laugh at my jokes!"  dad

        "say something funny, and i'll laugh." me

        "you used to laugh at my jokes."  dad

        "they _used_ to be funny."  me

        "no really though, you should try this catsup, it's delicious!" dad

        "give me a glass." me (sarcastically.)

        "what kind of catsup is this honey?" dad

        "heinz." mom

        "get it more often." dad

        "we get it all the time." mom

        "we must have got a good batch this time!" dadc says proudly

        "i can't beleive it!  he doesn't laugh at my jokes!" he tells my
 mother happily...

        <looks at me> "he's not laughing!"  dad

        "IT'S NOT FUNNY!"  me

        all of what you have seen?  loop it.  loop it five to ten more times,
 and that's our conversation, we go back and forth, forth and back.
