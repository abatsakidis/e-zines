             HOW TO REALLY USE THAT SPIFFY MONOPOLY MONEY
DANGER: *                                        Thursday,3/05, 12:00pm
FUN: ****                                        WHAT YOU NEED: a monopoly set

DISCLAIMER: uhm.. you can only pull this off if you be 31337. if your
            eliteness level is not 255+ dont even think about this. i
            am just offering this for information and stuff.

WHAT TO DO: ok doodz, you have probably heard about the new hundred dollar
            bill. the cool thing about the bill is that even though it is
            talked about, most quickee mart attendants have never seen this.
            also, since they generally have an iq lower than the monetary
            value of the bill itself, they quite easilly fall for this
            true haq. ok, go to the toy store any buy a game of monopoly.
            rip open the package and take out the cash... thats right,
            you are rich! go down to the local quickee mart and whip out a
            nice 100 dollar bill. the conversation should go something like
            this...

            quickie mart guy: what?! you think i be stupid?
            yoo: wot do you mean?
            qmg: you expect me to take funny money for those nudy magz n beer?
            yoo: funny money? dood, havent you heard?
            qmg: heard what?
            yoo: the gnu 100 dollar bill... its on the news and stuff..
            qmg: ok dood, thats cool, sorry.
            yoo: no prob.

            now at this point, you know the guy pumps gas all day (inhaling
            those healthy gasoline fumes). so what does a good anarchist do?
            take advantage of the situation!

            yoo: hey man, you like the new bills?
            qmg: yeah man, those are really unique!
            yoo: dood, i got the bunch of these bills.. there wont be any
                 more 'round here for quite a while. i have a lot here,
                 and i wouldnt mind trading wif you..
            qmg: no way man? i have about 800 bux here, would you mind?
            yoo: of course not, im a nice guy!
            qmg: wait till i show my freinds.. they will be so jealous!

THE END: its the end.. go on... have some fun!
