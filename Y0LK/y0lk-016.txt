y0lk number #sixteen: how to blow your nuts out with cornstarch and orangina
--(cool!)----------------------------------------------------------------------

        helloooooo... it's creed again with another classic y0lk issue!  damn,
ain't that exciting!  two issues in a row!  woo woo!

--(well, not really)-----------------------------------------------------------

        yeah, i see your point.  getting excited about a y0lk issue, heh.
well.  bite me.  okay.
        geez, i'm just dazzled here.  i don't know what to write about.  just
thinking out loud, as usual.  maybe if i keep typing what i think, something
cool will come out.
        HAH!  there's a knee-slapper.  implying that i might think something
cool... heh.  implying that i might think something at all is pretty risky.
w0o!  the zine's heating up now, folks!  can you feel the excitement?  woo hoo!

--(i'm shaking in muh boots!)--------------------------------------------------

        well, considering that i've had an hpa wannabe section in the last
three issues i've written, i'm not going to write one again for a while.

--(awwwwwwww...)---------------------------------------------------------------

        sorry, but you know me, i'm the editor... i need to maintain y0lk's
integrity.
        HAH!  i give 'em by the dozen, kids!  y0lk, integrity... eh?  eh?  w0o!

--(gimme some of those global domination plans, broda-man!)--------------------

        hmm... okay.

                      MY PLANS TO OVERTHROW THE SCENE

        must i bother with this?  i have your clothes, you are at my mercy!!!
naked, kissing and licking at the heels of your god!!!  i kick ass now!  i own
da scene!  all you people are naked, and there's nothing you can do about it!!!
yer ded!  ded i tell you!

--(whoa.  you're right)--------------------------------------------------------

        i am right.  you're all doomed.  sitting at your computers, naked,
reading y0lk hopelessly. maybe if you write a y0lk issue, i'll give you your
clothes back.
        hmm... isn't it ironic that this issue is called "how to blow your nuts
out with cornstarch and orangina," and i'm announcing my withdrawal from hpa
thingies?  very weird.
        i might mention that y0lk has a new infofile.  mentions something about
the ftp site, i think.  blah, who cares.
        and as long as we're on y0lk news, y0lknet may be going up soon, a huge
net with 3, yes 3, message bases.  hook yerself up.  the echo thingies are
configged, all we need is a world headquarters.  call my vmb if you're
interested.  1-800-314-8885 box 842.  woO!
        and last, and least... hooch said he loved my last issue.  he thought
the god thing was hilarious.  just thought i'd let you know.  i didn't really
think it was a strong point in the issue, but who cares.
        i keep getting this feeling that i'm writing y0lk #17 or something...
like i haven't realized that another issue has been released.  heh.

--(okay, pick a topic, let's go!)----------------------------------------------

        sorry.  well, i guess i'll do fake irc quotes for a bit.  nothing
else on my mind.

--(yay)------------------------------------------------------------------------

<rm^acid> acid is merging with flow, a 607 group, to form FLACiD.

<forceten> ice is merging with ROC to form RiCE.

<m0rph^_> actually, the ^_ at the end of my handle represents an ancient rune
          found in western asia, which after studying in detail, archaeologists
          have determined to mean K-RAD.

<creed> y0lk, y0lk, y0lk.  get it right before i beat you to death with a
        spoon.

<mogel> actually, there are two mogels.  i'm the calm one.
<mogel> sHuT uP#(%*@#(%* dON't tEll thEm aBout mE@(#*@(#$*@#($*@#(*

<boogeyman> hey everyone
<creed> aaaah@(#*$(!#@*$!(#$*#@(* go away!
<boogeyman> creed: boo! =)
*** boogeyman has been kicked off channel #zines by creed: (my mommy says
you're not real!!!) ***
<creed> whew, he almost got me that time.
*boogeyman* just watch it, man... the next time i see those feet down on the
            ground to get a glass of water, BLAM!

--(that boogeyman thing was stupid)--------------------------------------------

        yeah, that was pretty dumb.  they were all pretty stupid.  even worse
than last time.  well.  who cares, i'm outa space.  bye.

--(chief shephard's note)------------------------------------------------------

        hey, it's me hooch! haha. this was a pretty pathetic article, except
for the irc quotes, which were hilarious. that boogeyman thing had me
laughing out loud. boy, those group merger names weren't funny one bit,
though. anyway, y0lk will be having a y0lknet coming up soon. i would be whq,
but, i don't want to be. err. yeah. anyway, have fun. and write for y0lk!@
