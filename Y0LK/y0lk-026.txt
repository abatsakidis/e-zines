-----------------------------------------------------------------(thazzit)--

wow.  that was fun.

i deleted most of the uninteresting chatter.. like "you got kool sitez?" and
"somone gimmie they're passwd feil!!!!"

that kramer guy is funny.

a greet goes out to those boyz at TdS, especially GRiM, who didn't try to
flood me or kill me or something, and, in fact, thought i was funny.

also, if you see Ctalkobt, give'em a piece of your mind and reprimand him for
trying to flood your fave zine writer phorce.  his whois info said he was
god@tayco.vnet.net - so go kill'em.

thanx to Prezz, WhiteStph, tut, __ed__, din, GaTeKeePR, FL, and JoeBoy.

isn't tut a zines guy?  what's he doing in #warez?

--------------------------------------------------------(A Fun Zine Game!)--

can YOU find the names of the four stooges? (yes, all FOUR.) one of them just
happened to be REAL, and i decided to add the other three in the zine just
for fun.  using the Search/Find function counts as cheating.

-----------------------------------------------------------(editorz notez)--

wow, i just got 3 y0lk issues in a row.  now i have to package all of them.
damn.  so fuck the shepherd's notes, i'm getting these released.  by the way,
y0lk has a new ftp site.  look in y0lk.nfo for details.
