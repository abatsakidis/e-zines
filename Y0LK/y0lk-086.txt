                   .a[The Life Of A Demented Sysop]a.
               .a[by Spoony(aka spoonman of Australia)]a.

   Yes! I am a self-confessed sysop. What is so special about that? Well I
was born a sysop! You see there are two types of sysops, wannabe sysops and
born sysops (like me).

   Wannabe sysops are usually little 14year old kids trying to scam some new
warez, or middleaged newish-to-modemers trying to make sense of their worth-
less lives or corporate minded losers trying to make a profit. Their boards
usually close (unless they are making a profit) within 6months for many
reasons, none of which are worth discussing here as wannabe sysop's boards
should be avoided at all costs.

   Born sysops live for their boards and callers, pleasing them is like ple-
asing themselves, every call is like an injection of life and if the board
happens to close down it always comes back up. A born sysop cannot live life
to its fullest unless he/she is running a BBS.

   A sysops life in general is a thankless one! Yes we do live for our users.
If I hear that a couple of users are looking for info on something or some
files on a topic then first thing that I do is jump on the net and find it to
add to the filebase. Then theres my file binges every couple of days (or at
the very least weekly) when I hit the net or other boards and leech 20 to 100
(sometimes more!) new files, just so my users will be happy!

   And if any users has a suggestion a born sysop will more often than not
follow up and implement it. Geez we have no life!

   Then there are the users that logon and use up their download limits and
logoff, what? no uploads? no messages? no actual interaction with the sysop or
other users? thats right! a leech! grr!

   And there is nothing worse than to come home in the afternoon (or wake up
in the morning) only to find that their beloved board has been crashed for
hours and nobody has been able to call and logon! ARGH!!

   Another thing that pisses off sysops.... actually thats enough of what can
and always does piss off a sysop as the list could go on forever! How about I
divulge some little known secrets about how your sysop gets back at annoying
users? these are generations old tricks that have been passed down from sysop
to sysop!

   Things that sysops like doing (usually to annoying users or any user, it
all depends on how bored the sysop is!):

        -Aborting downlods
        -Editing the archive that someone is downloading (ie. with edit) and
         corrupting it (works best on BIG archives!)
        -Hitting pause during a download or anytime while the user is online
         so the user thinks the BBS has crashed... BBS's do not REALLY crash
         its just the sysop on the pause key!
        -Picking up the telephone, yelling, and hangin up. This will either
         give the user a severe case of line noise and in 30seconds or so
         everything is back to normal or it will simply give line noise and
         hangup.
        -Posting the users details on newsgroups or in iRC (phone numbers,
         real names, sexual prefences etc :)
        -Posting messages to and from users (ie. setting them up).
        -Just reading private mail, a sysop can get alot of incriminating
         information this way!
        -Hanging up on a user just before they do soemthing important (such
         as replying to a message or downloading a file they wanted). This
         not only makes the user call back and waste more money but it also
         increases the total system calls!
        -Many other things depending on the type of BBS software are at the
         disposal of the sysop (such as line noise generators and so on).

   So next time you are on a BBS and something strange happens or you start
getting phone calls at 3am look no further than your favourite sysop, we are
ruthless bastards so watch out!

   By the way if you would like to experience any of these tricks give my
board a ring on +61-8-2810568 or after August on +61-8-82810568 or why not
email me at spoonman@tolstoi.saccii.net.au (send me your favourite text file!)
and checkout my homepage at http://tolstoi.saccii.net.au/~spoonman (if your
bored it may amuse you for 5minutes!).

   But anyway, cya later and keep y0lking!

        Spoony.
