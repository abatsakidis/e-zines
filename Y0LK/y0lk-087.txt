 "little johnny carptenter"

        little johnny carpenter stepped off the school bus & instead of 
 heading straight home, as he usually did, he decided to take a shortcut 
 through the woods.  about two minutes into his journey, johnny ran into an
 elf sitting upon a rock; deep in thought.  startled, yet filled with
 youthful curiousity, little johnny carpenter approached the creature.
        "excuse me, mister .. " he said in an almost-whisper, " .. but, are 
 you an elf?"
        "yes.  yes, i am."
        "do you live in these woods?"
        "yes.  yes, i do."
        "how come?  how come you don't live with the rest of the townsfolk?"
        "well, little boy; i'm scared."
        "scared of what?"
        "exploitation."
        puzzled, johnny inched even closer to the creature & hesitantly sat 
 down next to him on the rock.
        "what ever do you mean, 'exploitation'?"
        "well, kid, quite frankly, i don't want to have my face plastered
 onto t-shirts, lunch boxes, saturday morning television cartoons, *or*
 sugar-coated breakfast cereals.  i don't want to be just another elf whose
 time has come & gone.  i don't want my own sitcom.  i don't want my own
 feature film."
        "but, that would never happen here, in trucksville.  you'd be free to 
 come & go & live & work amongst the other citizens.  you could get a
 full-time job with my father at the garage & move into the barn until you 
 could afford a place of your own."
        "oh, give it up, kid.  i am not your corporate whore.  i have morals, 
 convictions, & they're certainly not for sale.  i have respect for myself,
 boy, & i'm not going to let some greasy hollywood agent take that away from
 me."
        then, little johnny carpenter began talking to the elf about
 marketing, trading, stocks, bonds, buying, selling, promotions, merchandise,
 & the vast, almost neverending, market that layed overseas.
        sure, johnny carpenter couldn't beat jessica zglinksky in a spelling
 bee, but he sure did know business.
        a little over an hour later, johnny & the elf shook hands & left the
 woods together, as business partners.  after a few unsuccesful attempts at
 daytime drama, the elf left for hollywood to persue his "true" calling;
 children's programming.
        "elf's corner" ran for almost twenty consecutive years on network
 television & successfully spawned it's own line of children's clothing & an
 amusement park, in the process.  little johnny carptenter, however, was not
 so lucky.
        almost thirty years after their initial confrontation in the woods,
 johnny carpenter became an alcoholic & an avid cocaine user.  spending what
 little money he earned on cheap wine & expensive prostitutes (or was that
 the other way around?), johnny was forced to declare bankruptcy & move in
 with his grandmother.  last time he was seen alive, he was seen in the adult
 movie section of the local cap'n video (tm).
        despite all of this, the town of trucksville erected a plaque in town
 square to honor little johnny carpenter.  it was small, sure, but it was a
 testament to the greatest business prodigy to ever step foot in their quaint
 little community.
