 'twas the night before 2600 when all through the lines
 not a d00d was couriering, they were all paying fines.
 the modems were disconnected from the 'puters with care
 in fear that demonseed elite soon would be there.
 the warez were all given the "hidden" attribute
 in case he checked the subdirectories and not just the root.
 and I felt all warm and toasty as I settled into my bed,
 but that might have been from the bottles of Red.
 when from my computer there came a terrible noise,
 i sprang from my bed to check on my toys.
 away to my desk I flew like an arrow,
 and I saw a sight that chilled to the marrow.
 the svga monitor was enveloped in mud
 and the ergonomic keyboard was sticky with blood.
 when, what to my horrified eyes should appear,
 but a big monster truck (my heart filled with fear!).
 the driver of the beast burned with such horrible heat,
 i knew in a moment it was demonseed elite.
 faster than my highest baud, towards me he drove.
 when I heard his voice, under my bed I dove.
 "come out, come out, my pathetic warez d00d.
 your lame, little body shall be my food.

 you've been a waste for years, so you'll die tonight.
 bow humbly before me, as it's useless to fight."
 i feared a great torture, since i am so weak,
 and came out from my bed and kneeled at his feet.
 peering up at my doom, i was filled with much fright.
 he was shrouded in darkness and his eyes flared with light.
 my mind filled with images of macabre tortures and traumas.
 i knew i'd be punished for my misplacement of commas.
 it's really not my fault, i was never taught how,
 so i put them after every few words in everything i typed .. up 'til now.
 the being towered over me, a grin on his face.
 i gasped at the sight and my heart missed its pace.
 "you've been a pitiful lamer.  you'll now meet your death."
 upon hearing this, i ceased my breath.
 "my god," i thought.  "i'm going to die.
 will he boil me in oil and leave me to fry?
 will he punch out my eyes and drill through my brain?
 or will he spare me and leave my warez in the rain?
 oh no, that's too horrible.  that's a fate worse than death.
 i'd rather lose my life or my mind to crystal meth."
 looking down 'pon me, the demon spoke to my ears:
 "i can see your thoughts.  i feast on your fears.
 i've decided to spare you.  i'll give you a chance.
 your warez shall be destroyed .. along with your pants."
 so taking hold of my keyboard, i saw the worst i'd ever see
 as the great demonseed elite typed "format c:"
 and grabbing my trousers off of the chair
 he wrapped my disk holder in them and threw both in the air.
 "powers great and mighty, justice be thy name.
 take the warez and these pants and set them aflame."
 and then my trembling body did observe
 a sight that did shatter my very last nerve.
 the disks and the pants were engulfed in fire.
 my life, my mind, my only desire
 were being destroyed in view of my eyes.
 and the last sounds i did hear that night were my whimpers and cries.
 i am told by my neighbors that a terrible voice spoke loud with might:
 "you can't run.  you can't ride.  
 you can't escape.  you can't hide.
 i'll always know who's lame and who's not
 who writes t-files and who plays with bots.
 you won't see me coming, but i'll see your fears.
 i'll feast of your anger, your hopes, and your tears.
 as i bring justice in the night."
