y0lk #55: campbell's chicken-noodle soup omen of death
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        well.  y0lk.  we've released quite a few issues in the last couple'a
days, i guess the little zine is picking up.  or not.  shrug.  while writing
issue #50, i realized something rilly neat-o about y0lk: some of the old things
i wrote weren't actually that bad.  so, in honor of the old-style hip y0lk of
old, i present this issue.  the retro-silly issue.

HOW TO LOOK LIKE A PUNK ANARCHIST

auth0r: creed                                                     time: 11:05pm
date: 03/20/96                                                    %%%%%%%%%%%%%

you will need: 1 carving knife
               1 brick
               1 friend (or parent)


DISCLAIMER:  HaHaHaHaHa WHo CaReZ!@#$ eYe HaTe FeDZ@!$!@$!$%


        ok d0odz, for those of you that aren't quite punk yet from years of
hardk0re anarchist experience, here's a little t-file i whipped up so you kidz
can look more like myself.

        first, take your carving knife and cut a few gashes in your face & chestarea.  this will make you look like you have gotten into a lot of fights with
cops n' stuff so people will like you.  if you aren't into the pain thing, ask
your friend (or parent) to die you down and do it for you.  when you are
finished, you should have 8-10 deep bleeding wounds, which will soon develop
into cool scars.  i suggest that you sit down and rest for a while, so when you
pass out you don't hit your head or anything.

        when you regain consciousness and feel like walking again, take the
knife (still got it?) and cut a few fingers off.  if you are the daring type,
try sawing off a leg and/or foot.

WARNING: DO NOT SAW OFF YOUR OWN HEAD.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU WILL LOSE FLOW OF
         BLOOD & OXYGEN TO YOUR BRAIN, AND YOU WILL (MOST LIKELY) DIE.  IF YOU
         ARE INTERESTED IN DEATH, SEE EARLIER ISSUES OF Y0LK FOR INFORMATION ON
         HOW TO DESTROY YOURSELF.

        ok, now you're done with the knife.  what you want to do now is stand
about five paces away from your friend (or parent) and have him/her throw the
brick directly at your face.  repeat this process until you have about one
handful of teeth to show your friends.

        okay, so now you're a k-rad rebel teenage anarchist.  i suggest, for
your first act of duty, you look for the textfiles "how to get arrested" and
"guns for goths."  HaVe PHuN!@%&%*@!&#*&

--(w0o)------------------------------------------------------------------------

        sigh.  have i lost my goofy flair?  i dunno.  i'd like some feedback on
this issue, if it's possible.  i dunno how i did.  however, we at y0lk hold one
secret that protects us from humiliation & worrying about not doing well on our
writing...

        we still don't care.                                       (nyah nyah!)
