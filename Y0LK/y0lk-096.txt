=========[ cOsmic revelations, fever induced flashbacks, and pedOphilia ]=======
================================================================================
I decided to conform to y0lk standard t-phile format. No more anarchy and
elite penii shooting jizz at stick men for me.  I feel like a sell out. No
wait, I AM a sellout.

=========[ yOu are just a lamer ]===============================================
Thats damn right I'm a lamer. I invented 0 day lameness.. I release shareware
games, I use TheDraw (c) Fonts in my ascii, I like punk rock, I like to report
pir8 b04rdZ to the SPA, etc, etc... I could go on and on, but that is even more
boring than the rest of the shit I write.

=========[ this is fucking retarded ]===========================================
you've got a good point.

I noticed that fevers are a very cool thing.

I was at work today and it was fun.
Working at a photo lab has its advantages, which should be painfully obvious to
anyone out there. First of all, I get the usual run of pornographic pictures of
chicks doing wierd shit. Normally, we're supposed to not print that stuff.

However, I have a cool boss.

You may have heard of him.

Rad Man of ACid Productions (c)

=========[ wOW! o-D4y eLITe!#!@ yOU wORK fOR rADmAN!@# ]========================
Yes, I know, it is extremely cool
RadMan and I have a secret group of elite pedophile traders which we supply with0-day pedoporn from our phOtOlAb. Its called "RazOr 1912: pOrn Sextion".

Damn, this is really dumb.

=========[ you're damn skippy it is ]===========================================
"you're damn skippy"? Where the hell did that saying come from?

=========[ I'm from the midwest...  ]===========================================
I see.. Thats ok.. Lots of cool people are from the Midwest... Like..
hmm...
That one dood, with the Lobster Hands... "LObster Boy".. He's from like Ohio
probably. Speaking of Ohio... Wh0dini is from Ohio.
Coincidence? I really doubt it.

=========[ get to the hallucination dammit ]====================================
Sorry.
As the title of this y0lk suggests, this is somewhat about fever induced flash-
backs. In fact this whole thing has been written under the influence of a very
high, very elite, {very sexxee, underage and very elite} fever.  I can feel
the house music bleeding in my head.

=========[ "bleeding in your head"@$!@$ wTF? ]==================================
I've noticed that people who've done a lot of acid in their lives talk like
that a lot... Make weird, irrelevant statements about pointless shit.
Maybe its a computer dork thing.
How many computer people really do acid?
I used to do a lot of acid. I regret it.
But I like to see fish floating in bubbles of neon sadness

=========[ SHUT THE FUCK UP!#@!#!@#!@# ]========================================
Oh yeah. Um.. I was driving home from work today, and the road was moving.
This was because of the fever. Maybe it was because, according to Reverend
Bobito Gustavonous of Rome who fortold this in 8023 Bc, today is the first
day of the eLiTE eQUINoX..

It is a time to be merry my brothers.
Bask in your eliteness... for soon it is time between people who like to use
the "Web" and we h4x0rz to commence. There will be much bloodshed, there will
be much anarchy...

=========[ zzz ]================================================================
My inside sources told me that domino's pizza is really own by Intergalactic
Space Mafiosos...
Thats why it sucks so much.
Damn foriegners.
