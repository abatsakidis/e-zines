Hmmmm, what can I say? April wasn't that exciting. Hehe, except getting 
chased by Bell security, but that's another story. On with the ranting!

greetz: greetz? you want greetz? well fuck you, no one deserves greetz this
        month! ha! :D

I'm sick of all of these AoLamers that claim that they can hack. What the
fuck do AoL'ers know about hacking? I do admit, there are a few (and i mean
very, very few) cool AoLers, but most of them are just lame.

An example of this is when i was reading alt.2600 the other day (i know, 
alt.2600 is stupid, but i needed a good laugh), when i came across what had
to be the fucking dorkiest post to there ever. It went a little like this:

>Title: Can I run SATAN from AOL?
>
>Hi, I was wondering if there was a way to run SATAN from AOL.
>Thanks,
>
>BiLLy THe HaCKeR

(well, somethin like that) I mean, how fucking dumb do you have to be to ask
that question? It just shows the mental ability of AoLamers.

Another thing, there's a group on there called CiA (not the art group, some
lame WaReZ d00dz) that just totally sucks. They claim that they are 'ReaL
eLeeT h4ck3r d00dz'.  Man, they are so lame. They put out a bbs listing with
MY BBS ON IT. They said I had warez on my board. um.......NO! what the fuck
have they been smokin? I got at least 100 (no fucking joke) AoLamers calling
24/7 asking for warez. Finally, I just got sick of it and posted a giant 
No-AoLamers ansi instead of the feedback option. 

To show you how blatently stupid they are, one didn't even know what a 
handle was!!#*@# He said, 'come on, tell me, i'm a quick learner'. uGH! what
a loser!$$#@#

Luckilly I think they have gotten the point and have stopped calling.

I am really getting pissed at people not handing in their articles. I mean,
it's not that hard to get at least one t-file out a month, is it? Is it too
much to ask? Fuck, I run a board, write about 3 t-files a month, make asciis,
get a 4.o, and still have time for my girlfriend. Geesh. Not saying that
I'm perfect (shit, that's too funny), because no one is, but at least you guys
can hand in yer fucking articles on time, if at all!

NOTICE: All articles are due by the 20th of every month now, because the 25th
doesn't give me enough time to edit everything and still make it out on the
1st of the next month.

Please try to get all of yer articles in by the 20th... thanx...

PHi newz

Well, we gained some cool new writers this month, Blue Balls and Dr Hate. They
have previously both written for DnA magazine, and Blue Balls is (was?) in
BGR (are they still alive, or is it just Mr. Sandman?).  Also, this ish rEk
wrote two pretty cool articles, including one that's gonna be a continued
thing i guess called 'United States of Anarchy'.  hmmmmmm, what else?

Oh yeah, we got a few more distros this month, thanx to rEk.  Check em out if
yer local to one of em.  All of them are really badass boards (especally
tPt :D).

No word from RiCo, because Midnight Maniac's bbs has been down for a while,
due to a mysterious hardware problem with his comp... But, in the tradition
of EK comes another lame group! Yes folks, there is actually a group that
might take the lameness prize from those RiCo!  They call themselves CiA
(see above rant about their shitty bbs list), and supposedly can hack AoL.
Who the fuck would want to hack AoL though? What do they want, more shareware?
Well, actually no, they are all little warez pupps, trading games and such
on their /<-rad carded accounts.  To all CiA members, GET A FUCKING LIFE!

Also, we decided to take out the archive stuff this month and forever unless
people actually write in saying that they want it. I felt that it took up too
much space, and you can get that stuff on any good h/p board anyway.

Oh well. I have really nothing more to say about PHi news this issue. Look fer
issue o5 though. its gonna r00l! We might be going every other month because
lack of submissions wtc, and plus i dont wanna get burned out so quick.

I hate the IRS. They totally rip everyone off. Yeah it's cool to have money
for schools and shit, but they take too much from hardworking people.  Do you
know that they actually take a bigger percent of money from you, depending
on how much you make?  i.e. a guy makin 30,000bux a year pays like 7%, and a 
guy making 60,000bux a year pays 13% or somethin like that, that's prolly not 
right, but it's somethin like that.  uGH! Government is just lame.  We should
live in anarchy.

Welcome to PHi NEWz and Review. This day in PHi history: NOTHING HAPPENED! 
alright...well lets see whats been goin down with the crew. We did some 
spring cleaning on the board the other day. Weve decided to go "Eliete" or 
what ever its called now. We deleted all the lamerz (sorry roadkill, you 
suck!). Were supposedly going "underground" and are gonna be total 
hack/phreak, but somehow it dont believe it (no offence tb). 

Lemme see, i guess we got a bunch of new affils and stuff. I think we got RKL 
to join, but they changed there name to something diffrent. umm..Lemme see, 
NPC has joined up with us, so watch for upcomming anarchy paks to be released 
from PHi/NPC. 

Apprently DFT died, cause Death Adder couldnt deal with running an art group. 
I say GOOD RIDDENS! the world doesnt need another art group! Art groups are 
st00pid, all it is, iz a bunch of fuck up with way to much time on tere hands 
and egoz the size of fucking texas!

Enigma Klan is gone. We havent heard much from them, though there was an 
interesting discussion about EK on Sac Cable a few weeks back, but it dies 
quickly because rico could support himself with only 10 fake accounts 
supporting him, and the other 1500 BBS users laughing in his face. 

Lemme think, oh yeah i went to Cake the other night, it was pretty slick.
Though there were way to many people in such a small place. they played some 
killer stuff, i like "Shut the fuck up" but i donno who its by...i know its 
not a Cake song though. Jackpot SUCKS a fat one. i hate them with a fucking 
passion. i wanted to just go up on stage and beat the hell out of the 
singer...but i didnt..

My HD crashed the other day...but i fixed it. I lost ALL my killer filez, 
so im kinda bummed..

PHi might be putting a sever on the net soon. phruwt.sac-co.k12.ca.us so 
look for that in the next few months. We do need donations if anybody would 
like to contribute hi-speed modems (14.4k or up) to us, or external HD's or 
even BIG-ASS internal ones would be nice. im planning on getting a 730meg 
drive in the next few days (i hope). if you know anything about MachTen and 
its setup for UseNet and PPP could you please email me. thanks.

Weed hasnt killed anything lately. thank god.

Midnight Maniac is down temoraraly because his disk drive is skrewed.

i got deleted from AoL (oh big loss...)

Hermes Killer 3 is available from The PHRuWT Tree or Technicolor Highway BBS.

FTP: ftp.netcom.com /pub/fi/filbert - phruwt archive for hacking shit!

I can be found on IRC almost all day on #phruwt (/msg filbot hello - my bot )
or on #macwarez or in #uudw or #cake

boogeyman can be found at his new home: boogeymn@psyber.com or his home 
away from home on IRC #ansi

Well that about does it for this edition of PHi NEWz and Review...

i hate freshmen. i hate little fucking kidz who think there so fucking 
k-rad kewl. i just wanna beat the living fuck outa all of them. Listen to 
this. last night we went to coffie and i met this girl there that i saw at 
the Cake show (which btw was hella lame cause people were moshing to Cake and 
that just ruined the whole damn thing), so i was talking to her and shes all 
hey wanna go to kava with me and my friends. I said yeah sure. So i got in 
there car and we were talkin and the whole fucking time KEVIN CLARK 
(916.791.2026 - call him, fuck with him, bill long distance phone calls to 
China to him) - (who if you ever meet i suggest beating the fuck out of) was 
jumping up and down on my bumper and he fucked it up. He put big as dents in 
it. i told the fucker to stop but he woldnt listen. Now hes gonna have to pay 
for it cause i got hella busted. if that iznt the most fucked up thing. Im 
hella nice to him and i take him like ANYWHERE he wants to go, and all i get 
iz dents in my car and a "fuck you, im not gonna pay for it."

Fuckin lamer. im gonna kick his ass next time i see him. hes skared of me. 
He called me this morning and tried to applogize for doing it. fuck that, he 
souldnt have done it in the first place. Well back to the story, so we ALL 
drove to Kava (another kewl coffie shop in old roseville) and we were sitting 
there and joel (the ONLY kewl person in the car that night) met some more 
people we knew and so we started talking again. Well my lamer friends start 
whining "we wanna leave, this sucks" and shit like that. So tey decide to 
go piss on my car! fuck that. I left just to stop those assholes from doing 
anymore damage to it.

It was gonna be a hella killer night, we were gonna go to a party as well...
but the idiots ruined it all. now im NOT allowed to drive anywhere EVER again, 
i cant get my new HD i need (if anybody wants to donate a 730meg HD to me id 
appreciate it..) and im basicly stuck at home now till hell freezes over. 
fucking krazy.

fucker just called me again. said "fuck you. im not paying for it. i didnt do 
it. nobody saw me do it." LIAR. i saw him, joel saw him, the girls saw him. WE 
ALL SAW him but his gay lovers BRENADN HANCOCK (916.797.1187 - call him, fuck 
with him, bill LD to him..it ok with me, i dont care what you people do with 
there nummbers) and JARED COOK (donno his number) claim that they didnt see 
anything at all..wonder why? probably cause kevins dick was in there mouth!

I hate little kidz. i cant say that enough. i wish they would fucking GROW up 
and realize that they have to be responsable for what they do, and they cant 
just fuck with other peoples shit and expect them to do nothing about it.

If anybody has any good ideas for revenge, lemme know. im willing to do just 
about anything short of killing the bastards.

Wanna know what else pisses me off? AOL. I was on there the other day (yeah 
yeah i dont wanna hear it). that place annoys the fuck out of me. how can you 
like it? its SOOOOOO LAME! everybody there is a fucking dork. the all think 
there some kinda modem godz or something. I was in one "room" and they were 
talking about satan, and they didnt have a clue what the fuck they were saying. 
One guys all "I tried to click on it, but all it did was open up a text file" i 
just wanted to hurt them! 

Steve Case fucks monkeys, dogs, pigeons, small barnyard critters, pigs, ducks, 
geese, cats, fish, seals, small fluffly microscopic critters that live on moldy 
bread...

Well anyway, that place does have one good side, one hell of a warez trade. my 
god! i was there for less than 20 minutes and i have a mailbox full of at least 
200 megz of shit. Im talking Code Worrior Gold, C++ 7.0, Virex 5.5, 
Civilization, 40 megs of hacking shit, MAOHELL betaz, AOL admin software, Beta 
AOL software, System 7.5, Windows 95 the full release, QuickKeys, Second Sight 
BBS, NovaLink Pro 4.0b and about 45 other things.. it was krazy!

alright welcome to my review of our local modem scene..and other local shit....

to start id like to say that marathon with more than 2 people kicks fucking 
ass..!!
we play the other day at weed's house with 3 people (me, boogeyman, weed) and 
it just plain ruled. the thing that sucked though was that we had to go get 
phonenet adapters and shit from CompU-got-taken...hehe..well as the story goes, 
we "borrowed" a few things that we WAY over priced...oh yeah boogeyman hacked 
the store computer. theyve got some kinda modem dialup to the other stores. 
though our hacking spree didnt last long cause people we looking at us. we were 
standing infront of a computer with BIG stickers that said "employees only" and 
shit like that...well we got what we needed and it was slick shit. that game 
files over a network. i got my ass kicked, but not as bad as boogeyman. on on 
level when we decided to quit, he was at -45...heheheh even i dont suck that 
bad.

well back to the issue at hand...the local scene. i found a k-rad h/p board 
the other day. it sucked. i got deleted because i suggested that they use the 
hot keys menu not the tpye-till-you-die-menu that comes with PA 09b15. the 
board its self sucked. the ansi sucked, the people sucked. the messages lacked 
substance, or should i say the board lacked messages. the only atantage would 
be that its 28.8kbps, but that doesnt matter cause i havent got a 28.8.

tPt has been active. maily due to CiA's posting of a warez bbs list in which 
the board was listed, but everybody knows THERE ARE NO WAREZ on the PHRuWT tree 
so i dont know why people call looking for them. it was kinda funny, tb changed 
the "feedback" option from the login shuttle to a disconnect so they would try 
and get an account and get bumped..heheh lamers deserve it.

lemme se what else. Weed's boards been doing good. he keeps complaing about 
not enough HD space, but he has like 700 megs, and 600 of them are full of 
crap. he put the ENTIRE 125 meg system 7.5 CD-ROM on his HD just for the phuck 
of it. and he complains about lack of space?? fuckin crazy...

If we didnt mention our trashing trip in the last issue i will tell the story 
again...we went to the local telco and tried to get in, well tb and lenex 
decide to take apart the electric gate opener...that was smart because 
security comes...so we ditch back to the car and drive around the corner and 
stop cause we see some ungaurded trash cans..well things just get ugly. 
somebody saw them try and bolt cut it so they come running out, lenex like an 
idiot runs for it...security comes running around the corner and its a full 
on chase..like in movies and shit. i drove a ways and they ran and got in the 
car and we took off..it was hella kewl. but LENEX the idiot almost got us 
busted...

FILBERTS MISC HACK OF THE MONTH:

do you have system 7.1 still?
like more ram?
do you use Ram Doubler v1.0.1?
well now you can have 9 times the ram. its that easy. just take resedit and 
open that bitch up. in the 1st resource in the second row (PREF Resource) 
you gotta open that one. browse through it. you will find a string like: 
$000200 or something damn similar. it should be the only one that looks like 
that. change the 2 to a 9 and restart for 9 times the ram. it kinda slows your 
computer down and can possibly crash your system or cause strange bugs and 
shit to appear..at least mine did, but thats not the only thing i changed :) so 
i recomend just doing that and nothing should happen.

FILBERTS SOFTWARE REVIEW:

[MachTen 2.1.1]

It sounds good, but in reality it sucks a fat one. its a good idea, but the 
people who made it didnt do a very good job. it conflicts with just about 
everything, it doesnt work with VM, or ram doubler, it barley works even then. 
you need like 8 megs o HARDWARE RAM for it run good, you need at least 35 megs 
to install it and probably sevral hundred if not sevral gigs to run a good site.
the pppd setup is almost impossible, and it doesnt work half the time. 

the text files are in a "special" format which you need to use a special 
application to decode. that makes editing the passwd file offline a pain in 
the ass.a good thing though is that it is a rather good copy of a BSD unix 
system and it run pretty smoothly after you get past the 10,000 bugs and other 
glitches that cause your system to freeze and die.

if you do decide to get it abd try it, be sure to get the update to 2.1.1g 
which is available from there ftp site: ftp.tenon.com. it fixes SOME of the 
bugs but not many, though by the time YOU read this it may be years, and it 
might work one hell of a lot better, but as for now it doesnt.

NOTE: this is from my experience with it. if yours worked the first time 
GREAT! im fucking hapy for you. if you have something youd like to share 
lemme know.

WHAT WE NEED:

What we need is a fucking 16 color ansi program. im tired of having to make 
multi-screens in ansi muse and cut and paste them together in teachtext. its 
fucking annoying as hell. i think somebody should make one and make it now! i 
tried but i couldnt do it because i lack programming skill..heheh..so do it, 
it cant be that hard.

what it should have:

16 colors
scroll able screen size (up  and down)
auto fonts (like The Draw)
ability to make circles (like it does boxes in ansi mouse)
better animation tools (i hate the way ansi mouse fucks up all the time)
easier to  use "ansi pallet" (like ansi creator has)
auto shade ability (so you dont have to fumble with it)
pick the like source for auto shade (wouldnt that be neat)

if somebody could do all that, we would have the most kick ass ansi creator on
planet fucking earth! but noooooo..nobody wants to take the few hours and code 
it out..cause there LAZY! do it or ill hunt you down and kill you! well maybe 
not kill you...but it hurt you real bad..


thats all folks...see yeah next time...

At Ease For Work Groups Esoterica and More 

By Moral Phibre


My experience with the nefarious At Ease for Workgroups (AEfW) comes from two
years of being on both sides of the fence.  Here are some nifty things about
AEfW:

Before you begin:
AEfW can create a log file of everything that was done, so watch out.  You
can't even have the machine generate this file unless you have
adminsistrator's priviledges, so wacth out.  If you have the resources, copy
the system onto an external drive, hack around, and then replace the system,
covering your tracks.

(1)  Ways to crash a system using Norton.  
      AEfW when installed creates a "shadow" partition.  If you run Norton
Disk Doctor, you can see this partition...It has a screwed up name, and if
you examine it, it will say that the drive is screwed,a nd that there is all
sorts of stuff you need to fix.  If you try to fix even one thing on this At
Ease partition, YOU WILL SCREW UP THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.  When you restart, the
machine will NOT boot up off the drive, and you must boot up off a different
drive, and reinstall a driver.  BTW, All the Apple Tech Support people I've
talked to deny that AEfW does this, but it really does, so check it out
sometime.  Just be careful not to try to "fix" anything :-)

(2)  Unlock
   Included with your purchase is a disk called At Ease Utilities.  On there
is a program called Unlock.    Thing is, you need a password to use unlock.
 How do you get it?  Call up Apple, and tell them that you have a machine
with a damaged driver, and since AEfW locks this, you can't do anything.
 Then you give them your serial number for the software.  They give you a
code which you type in, and it unlocks the disk.  This code changes weekly!
 If you manage to steal a copy of the registration and the disk, then you
might want to use this to hacke through, but otherwise forget it, because
there are many easier ways.  I won't go into these, becasue they've already
been beaten to death before, and there is no sense in me repeating them.

(3)  Uninstall
      As long as you are stealling disks, steal disk number one of the
install disks.  "What da ph*ck?!?" you are saying right now, "Why would I
ph*kin want to unstall that sh*t on my computer."  You don't, dumbass!  If
you insert the install disk in, then hold down the option key, the pull down
menu changes from install to deinstall!  It's been a little while since I've
done this, so it might be the command key, but I am like 90% sure it is
option.  Just select deinstall, and your problems are gone.  You need to run
this in order to get rid of the program, because if you thorugh it in the
trash you just fuck up the system, cause of those hidden partitions I told
you about.  If you don't remember that then you must be stoned :-)

(4)  Conflicts
   In my experience, AEfW sucks!  It can cause major problems, and besides,
FoolProof is much better.  One of these conflicts is that LocalPathx when
installed for a month or two, then causes problems (like the machine taking
15-20 mintues to start up!, or random crashing)  This can be repaired by
getting rid of the software and reinstalling, or just getting rid of At Ease
:-)  If you can install LocalPath onto a whole load of machines, it will make
the Sys Admin crazy, if they don't know where to look.    Speaking of
FoolProof, the two can be run together, but it is really not a pleasant thing
because they cause all sorts of trouble.

(5)  Starting up off a boot volume
   Apple say that you can't boot up from a different volum if you use AEfW.
 This is wrong.  Although I have had little success in using a disk to start
it up, you can use the system CD-ROM that comes with most late-model macs
that have CD-ROMS.  Out the bugger in and hold down
delete-option-command-shift (D-O-C-S) to boot off of it instead.  Wait a
couple minutes and you will see the familiar At Ease folder.  By now you are
thinking that it didn't work, because here is At Ease...Just click the button
"Go to finder' and you're there, with No AEfW.  If you are lucky, then At
Ease  might even be on the disk, and you can de-install it then!

(6) How AEfW deals with files 'n applications
     One sneaky thing about At Ease is that it will let you open a document
that "belongs" to any application on the hard drive, even if that application
is not available to you through At Ease.  This can be helpful, if you need to
type up reports, and the only machine available is a CD-ROM workstation that
only lets you run reference CD's (but the librarian uses Claris Works or
whatever to type stuff up on off hours).  Just insert a disk containing a
file from that program, and then open it.  Now you can create new files,
whatever.   One good way to do this is to use Apple File Exchange to bury a
game deep somewhere, and then put a saved game on a disk.  That way, only
those who know can use it, and you are less likely to be caught.

(7)  Annoying things sysops face:

*  People taking loads of screen-snapshots (Shift-Command-3) and filling up
the volume.

*  Take screen snapshots of trying to break into the Administrator account.

*  Running Res Edit and modifiying the At Ease Preferences File, so that it
ways things like "Sacrifice a disk to the great Jobs".

*  Using Apple File Exchange to put programs into the the setups folders in
the System's folder, so that grade school kids get access to stuff like Ooze
E-Zine.

*  Reverse the process so people can't run anything :-)

*  Create an obscene startup screen about certain teachers been members of
NAMBLA and then put it into the startup folder using Apple File Exchange  :-)

Use your imagination, be creative, and most of all, don't get caught.

hey all you hacks and phreaks... since lack of texts from me in the last ish 
i thought i'd do some for this one :D. hope you enjoy...

Good places to trash:

Telefone Co (duh)
Large Businesses
Department Stores
Banks
Credit Card Companies
Computer Manufactures (hardware or software)

Well, it really depends on where the fuck to go by what you are lookin for.
Mostly for cc#'s look at banks and suck because they have a very loose 
sekurity team if one at all.  Telco places are usually a no-no unless you
are james friggin bond or somethin.

Supplies you'll need:

Car (necessity)
Bolt Cutters
3 people or so (never more than 4 or 5 though)
Your Phreak Kit (look in this issue for supplies)

It's a really good idea to go during the day to scope out the site you are 
gonna hit.  This way you can see what you are up against.  Mostly I have
found that big corps and banks are the easiest to hit.  I've even seen people
just go up in the daytime and trash.  Pretty funny.  It also helps if you are
in your hobo-gear when you go, therefore people won't suspect anything.

*NOTE: Be sure you know when trash-day is around where you are going. It's
       hella lame to be out trashing and find nothing.

When it's nightime drive on up to your desired dumpster.  Have two people
in the car circle the can, keeping a lookout for baddies.  Have the other
two people hop out and one go into the can.  The other should just look out
for the car and the phedz. After you are in the can, look for paper trash, not
food trash.  Food trash is all yicky and gross.  Grab the paper (be careful,
they can be VERY heavy) and wait for the car. Once in, shoot off like a 
motherphucka and sort your prize.  You are likely to find fonebills, cc#'s,
logins, etc.  There is an unlimited number of things that you can find.

Anyways, if you have any questions or comments mail my ass...

                              ====================



In this article I'm going to try and put together all the info you need to
make a successful phreaking kit to use when you go on those box-hunts and
trash runs or whatever you like to do...Also I will explain some techniques
on exploring various telco things.  Note: this is definately not a manual,
but it seemed like an appropraite title...

Whatchu gonna need:
===================

-    Backpack     :  I reccommend a black cloth type with many pockets...
-    Box(es)      :  Beige, Red, and maybe a Goldbox are always good.
-    Ratchets     :  7/16" for boxes and 3/8" for underground types.
-    Screwdrivers :  Variety - S, M, L. Regular and Phillips heads.
-    Flashlight   :  Mini-maglite with red-lens thingy.
-    Gloves       :  Not wise to leave fingerprints...
-    Pen&Notepad  :  Use a PEN cause pencils can brake.
-    PocketKnife  :  For stripping fone wires, etc...
-    Lighter      :  See bombs.
-    Bomb(s)      :  Smokebomb, whatever else you might need for a getaway
-    Mask         :  Cover your face when in manholes, cover from gestapo.
-    Marker       :  Tag PHi on every box you can see >:D
-    Repellant    :  Mace or pepperspray. Use on gestapo or fuckheads...
-    Bolt Cutters :  To go where no phreak has gone before... :)
-    Crowbar      :  Manholes, manholes, manholes... Everyone should have one!
-    Telco ID Card:  See Below...


Making a Telco ID Card:
=======================

To make a telco id card first try to find a telco guy on the side of the road
or in your neighborhood somewhere. Ask him to see his card. Most likely he'll 
show it to you and ask you why. Just tell him that you were going to call his
boss and say how nice of a person he is or some bullshit like that. After that,
go home and find print up a card on your comp (color is good) that looks like
the one you just have seen. (They look different so I'm not gonna tell what
one looks like, you'll have to figure it out for yourself) If you can't see
a card, just go and print up a card with the logo of your telco company on it.
Slap a picture of yourself on there, add an id # and a name, and go get that 
bitch laminated!

This is a handy thing to have on you, since if someone stops you you can say you work for ____ Bell. This has saved us many times...


Exploring Telco Sites:
======================

A good place to check out is the nearest telco truckyard. There, if open, the
truckyard houses lots of telco vans, trucks etc. and you can walk right in and
take what you want. We don't advise doing this, because you are walking on 
THEIR turf and stealing stuff. I suggest looking out for grey whales in your 
neighborhood or around when you are out driving or whatever. Then, when the
dumbass is off working on something, or taking a leak you can just walk right 
up and take what you need. It is cool to catch them going in a quickiemart or 
something, because they usually leave their window rolled down or door 
unlocked.  

Usually the toolbelt is on the back of the seat in the front. It has the test
set and various tools in it that you would just love to have. The manuals are
mostly always in the glovebox or between the passenger and driver seats.


Telco Boxes:
============

I'm not going to go into detail about telco boxes in this issue, because this
you probably all know a little about already from experience.

Use your imagination when exploring telco boxes. Call a 9oo# on one line, and
splice it into another line. Wire tons of lines together with the included
spool of wire. Hell take the wire, I don't give a shit. We usually like to 
leave little messages for the telco guys in there. Hehehe, my favorite is 
still, 'Have a nice day. (Signed) Phiber Optik.' hehe, I can just imagine the
guy freaking out and pissing his pants.

Trashing:
=========

I would go into detail on this, but read article 4.oo4 by myself of trashing.


Conclusion:
===========

Well, that about sums it up for this article by me. If you have any questions,
comments, etc. shove em...

Part 2.This months easy made bomb.
Part 3.Information Every Stoner Should Know.
Part 4.Whats up next time.

           PART 1. STEALING, HOW TO DO IT AND NOT GET CAUGHT.


As a veteran thief, I pass on my hints and tips to all that follow in my foot
steps.

As a thief you must ALWAYS be aware of your surroundings, look for asshole
workers, Rent-a-pigz (security), under cover narcs (There are lotz of
these in TARGET), and cameras (cameras=GET OUT AND FIND A BETTER STORE).
always make shure you have a place to ditch the stash if it gets hot so you
can get it later. If they have those stupid ass security sensors no problemo!
Always make sure to look for the trigger to the alarm (Little white stickers
are most common). Wearing a jacket with long sleaves and hidden pockets are
a good uniform for stealing. Say you want a candy bar, just push it up into
your sleeve and walk out! For bigger things you can always stick um in your
hidden compartment or your crotch (NEVER steal a 40 and stick it in your
crotch, I learned my lesson). Always make sure no one is around when you steal
because most people are fucking rats. A good way to steal is to switch the
price stickers on the item with a real cheap sticker.  -Thats All....


                   PART 2. THIS MONTHS EASY MADE BOMB.


This month you all will learn the all mighty ETCHANT BOMB (my favorite).

WHAT TA GET!:
1 16oz bottle of ARCHER PC BOARD ETCHANT from Radio Shack for $2.89
Foil
1 or 2 liter bottle
A squeezable bottle. (optional but nice to have)

NOW TA DO!:
First you need to prepare the etchant for use by putting it in a squeezable
bottle so you can put it in the 1 or 2 liter bottle. Start by putting it in
a old mustard or ketchup bottle (or something simular). Now you need to
dilute it with water to control the reaction time. I put about 1/2 a cup of
water in and then it takes about 40 seconds to go but you can control the
reaction time by the amount of water.

Cut a 1foot by 1foot piece of foil.

Tear it up into 1in wide by 2in long strips.

Drop the foil strips into the empty bottle until it is 1/4 full.

Take it to where you want to detonate it, Take off the cap, fill it about an
inch full of etchant, cap it quikly and shake it quikly so all the foil gets
covered with the etchant, throw it or set it down but make shure your at least
15 feet away, and kick back and watch it blow!


               PART 3. INFORMATION EVERY STONER SHOULD KNOW!

Easy ways to get bigger hits of your joint:

1.Take the tube of a metal pencil and stick your joint in one end and hit the
other (you will be inhaling pure smoke and no air!).
2.Make a fist around the joint and make a hole on the other end of your fist
and take some mega hits!
3.Wrap the top of a match book around one end for power hits!
4.Same with credits cards and Zig Zag covers.

I found that if you go down town and ask the homeless to hook you up you
always get a fat hookup (unless you got a 5 buck an once hookup like me!).

Always put a little bud in the tube of your pipe so after about a week the bud
is so fucking resinated.....


                            PART 4. NEXT MONTH
Another easy bomb!
More stoner stuff!
I havent decided what else so your just gonna have to fuckin read it to find
out!

I DON'T GIVE A FLYING FUCK WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS INFO. AS LONG AS YOUR SHIT
DON'T COME BACK ON ME.. -ReK- nPc.PHRuWT.ASiA.CravE
Holes in Phone Systems beginning January 1, 1995...


North American Numbering Plan (NANP)
====================================

In the next six years, more than a dozen area codes throughout North American 
will be unable to meet customer demands (attachment 1).  The reason for this 
is due to the rapid emergence of different methods of communication such as 
cellular phones, faxes, data lines, pagers, and other personal communication 
devices.  It is not uncommon for the typical business person to have three or 
four telephone numbers reserved for their personal use.  This along with the 
steady increase in overall population has put a drain on the pool of existing 
telephone numbers.  To combat the dearth of numbers, the current North American 
Numbering Plan is being revised.


Interchangeable Area Codes
--------------------------
At the heart of the original NANP is a N(0/1)X-NXX-XXXX dialing format.  In 
this scheme, N is equal to any digit between 2 and 9, the second digit of the 
area code is limited to either a 0 or 1, and X is equal to any digit between 0 
and 9.  As a result of these restrictions, the area code pool has been limited 
to 160 codes (144 geographic plus 16 service codes).

Under the revised NANP, the format will become NXX-NXX-XXXX where N is any 
digit between 2 and 9, and X is any digit between 0 and 9.  This will allow the 
creation of 640 new area codes.  Because it will be possible for both the area 
code and central office codes to be identical, this facet of NANP expansion is 
commonly referred to as Interchangeable Numbering Plan Area or INPA.


Expanded Carrier Identification Code (CIC)
------------------------------------------
In addition to INPA, the Carrier Access Codes will also be expanded.  To 
access a preferred long-distance carrier today, the required dialing sequence 
follows a 10XXX format.  The letters XXX are unique, 3-digit identifiers 
assigned to a particular carrier.  For example, 10288 is AT&T’s code, 10222 is 
MCI’s, and 10333 is Sprint’s. 

With the newly revised NANP, the current 10XXX format will be changed to 
101XXXX.  This change is expected to take effect in mid 1995.


International Calling Procedures
--------------------------------
Currently, placing an international call from the United States requires a 
country code plus a 12-digit maximum number.  To increase number availability, 
this requirement will be expanded to include a country code plus a 15-digit 
maximum.  This change is planned to take effect late in 1996.


Dialing Plans
-------------
Under this revised numbering scheme, callers who currently dial 1-NXX-XXXX to 
reach someone in their own area code (intra-state call) may not get through.  
This is because where interchangeable area codes have been activated, it would 
be possible for callers dialing a 10-digit number to be connected to the wrong 
number due to the network switch reading the “1” plus seven digits as a valid 
call.

To combat this, callers will need to dial “1” plus ten digits for all direct 
dialed calls other than local calls within the home area code (intra-state).

Local Calls = NXX-XXXX
Intra-State Calls = 1-NXX-NXX-XXXX or 0-NXX-NXX-XXXX
Inter-State Calls = 1-NXX-NXX-XXXX or 0-NXX-NXX-XXXX

Numbers not affected by NANP changes are 700, 800, and 900 numbers, 411 and 
1-411 information numbers, 911 emergency numbers, 0 and 0+ operator assist 
numbers, directory assistance, and local calls remain 7 digits.


Impact
------
Virtually all PBX and call accounting systems in use today will need some 
degree of either software or hardware upgrades to accommodate NANP expansion 
changes.  Since these systems have been programmed for compatibility with the 
original NANP, new area codes and dialing schemes will not be recognized.

In addition to PBXs and call accounting equipment, the following is a list of 
equipment which will be affected by NANP expasion:

   Centrix services
   Automatic route selection tables
   Least cost routing tables
   Station message detail recording rating tables
   Automatic dialing equipment
   Computer dial-back devices
   Alarm dialers
   Security systems
   Speed call lists
   Fax machines
   Private paging networks
   Call forwarding numbers
   Telephone answering equipment
   Modems
   Private networks

PBX equipment modifications will differ from one manufacturer to another but 
in most cases, a simple software modification to the memory and area code 
database would be made.  The central processing unit of some switches may need 
to be upgraded since more processing speed will be needed to execute a search 
on the larger database of number combinations while memory increases may be 
necessary to handle increase data processing, routing and billing information.


Consequences
------------
For those businesses who are unaware of NANP implications or those who choose 
to ignore them, the consequences can be quite costly as in the hospitality, 
health care, and education institutions where telephone systems often act as 
an important revenue source.

PBX systems will not be able to recognize an INPA being dialed and therefore, 
block the call; without being programmed to identify one number as a toll call 
and another being local, facilities may lose toll costs; if the call accounting 
system is not upgraded, it may not keep track of toll and international calls 
and managers may not have the ability to detect unusual call patterns which 
often indicate toll fraud; toll restriction tables will not be updated and pay 
per service and other frequently abused numbers will not be blocked.

-=- Phoney Phreak of PHi -=-			Improved Silver Box

	After looking at the box plans that were available on 
silver boxes, and deciding that they weren't all that useful, 
I've written this short phile on a method to make a generic 
silver box, which should work on most phones. Although its 
only been tested on desk type phones, the principals can be 
applied to any touch-tone phone.

Intro.
	A silver box is a device that can produce the Dual Tone 
Multifrequency (DTMF) tones that are associated with an 
extended keypad.  That is gives you four extra buttons 
(labeled A, B, C and D), which are not normally assessable.  
If you want to know what these frequencies are look in the 
alt.2600 FAQ.

Basic Principle
	The DTMF tone is generated by an IC which sends dual 
tones down the phone line.  One of the tones (the low 
frequency one) corresponds to the row on the keypad, and the 
other (the high frequency one) corresponds to the column on 
the keypad.  So when a key is pressed on the keypad the tone 
you hear is made up of two separate tones.  On a normal 
keypad there are four rows (labeled R1 to R4) and 3 columns 
(labeled C1 to C3).  If the button "1" is pressed this is 
indicated by output from R1 and C1.  These outputs are fed 
into the DTMF generator, which produces the correct tones 
according to row and column inputs.  On all the DTMF 
generators I've encountered there is also an input for C4 
(for example with the DTMF generator TCM5087 this is pin 7), 
so all one has to do to generate the correct tones 
corresponding to A, B, C or D is send a signal into R1-C4 to 
generate A, R2-C4 to generate B and so on.

Putting this into Practice

You'll Need:
		A Phone (make it cheap, say from Goodwill, about 
$5.  Desk ones work best)
		4 DPDT switches
		Some wire
		Solder
		Volt/Ohm meter is also useful

	First thing to do is take apart the phone, and you 
should find several sections in there.  The ones of interest 
are 1) the keypad and
2) the DTMF generator.  The DTMF generator will be the chip 
nearest the keypad, and will have a 3.579 MHz crystal wired 
to it.
	After you've identified the parts you need to look at 
the keypad.  There will be at least 8 pins with the keypad, 
one carrying the signal in, the 7 out (4 rows and 3 columns).  
Sometimes there are 9 pins, with the ninth pin used for C4, 
but isn't wired up.  You'll want to identify which of the 
pins is carrying the signal into the keypad.  One method to 
do this which I use, and is quick, is to plug the phone in 
and with a voltmeter connect one clip to earth (say that wire 
on the plastic sheet which goes around the keypad) and then 
test each pin connecting the keypad.  One will give you a 
signal of about 3.2V (this may vary).  This pin is the live 
pin (it was pin 5 on the ones I've used).  Know you want to 
find outwhat the other pins are for.  Put the meter into 
resistance mode and connect one clip to the live pin.  Then 
hold down key "1" and test the other pins for no resistance.  
This will give you 2 "hits", R1 and C1.  Go through the other 
keys until you have the pins for R1-4 and C1-3.  An 
alternative method is to pull the keypad apart and follow the 
wiring around and figure it out that way (not very elegant 
though).

	Now we want to follow the pinouts to the DTMF generator 
and find out which pin they go into.  This should present no 
problem as there are no components between the pins of the 
keypad and the chip.  You'll notice that the chip inputs seem 
to go in order, i.e. R1-14, R2-13, R3-12 and R4-11.  This may 
help you find out where C4 goes (look at C1, C2, and C3).  If 
that doesn't appear to be working try looking for a pin on 
the chip that goes nowhere.  This will be C4.  Alternatively 
if your phone has a 9-pin output from the keypad, follow the 
unconnected pin, and this will lead to C4.

	You should now have enough information to put together a 
silver box.  To complete the box take the 4 switches and 
connect them to the live pin (all 8, its easiest to run one 
wire from the connection between the keypad and the printed 
circuit board and one pin of one switch, then connect each 
pin in series with the one next to it ie 1 to 2, 2 to 3....7 
to 8.  Then for switch one (A) run one output to R1 and the 
other to C4 (again its easiest to solder the wire to R1 at 
the connection between the keypad and the printed circuit 
board).  A quick crude diagram would look like this:

        R1              R2              R3            R4
        |                |      C4       |             |
        |                |       |       |             |
        |  _____________ | ______|______ | ___________ | _
        \  \             \  \            \  \          \  \
         \  \  A          \  \  B         \  \  C       \  \  D
          \  \             \  \            \  \          \  \
        |  |             |   |           |   |         |   |
        |  |             |   |           |   |         |   |
        |  |             |   |           |   |         |   |
        ____________________________________________________
                                 |
                                 | 
                                 |
                              Live Pin

	Then just take the keypad plate in the phone and cut 4 
holes for each of the switches to go through, and reassemble 
the phone, which should now be a fully working silver box.

	If anyone has question/queries/comments/threats/sisters 
phonenumber I can be reached on the PHRuWt mailing list.  For 
a more information check out Understanding Telephone 
Electronics by Stephen J. Bigelow for a nice introduction on 
how a phone works.

hello. im sure by now we all have heard stories about the warez trade on AOL. 

We'll this is a personal account of exactly what goes on there. sevral weeks 
ago i was at a local book store when i saw a copy of MacWorld with an AOL disk 
attached to the front of it. well itd been a fucking long time (like almost a 
year) sence i was last on AOL so i decided id take another look and see if i 
liked it. so i grabed the mag, walked to the far side of the store and slipped 
out the side door into the night (well twilight..it was almost dark). i 
quickly drove home (god its great to drive) and went to set it up and check 
out what was new. the software installed quickly and was pretty much the same 
from the pevious time i used. well i logged in using a TCP connection cause 
its "local" access number is long distance and a 800 number is free..:) i 
proceeded to fill out the info sheet with bogus info about a  supposedly real
person, based on some info i found while trashing. i gave them a name, a REAL 
address, of who i dont know and a credit card and within minutes i was online 
enjoying my new 10 free hours at somebody elses expense.. i remembered about 
the warez trade and quickly went to "macwarez" thsome of the people knew who i
was and had read the zine so i was accepted quickly into there group. with in 
minutes i was asked to join a massmailing..i said "yeah sure what is it?" they
said that was how the distributed the warez and by getting on the "list" id 
recieve them all..so i signed up. i got kinda bored and left to get something 
to eat, and when i came back i went to read my new mail. ialmost shit myself 
when i saw what was there...over 200 megs of shit! this is just what i can 
remember off the top of my head! now dont get me wrong about this, im not out 
to get these people in trouble, im just here to show you what's going on.

What might you ask is AOL doing about this? i say nothing. they would like you 
to believe that there stopping the warez trade but there is no way in hell 
they possibly can. with probably over 100 people with FAKE accounts with other 
peoples credit cards using there own or even hacked accounts...theres no way 
you can stop them. thats the beauty of it all, there is nothing anybody can 
really do about it.

This is the latest word i hear AOL is "in development" of call tracing 
software. hahaha yeah right. your gonna have to dig through 1,000,000+ users 
phone records + god knows how many calls per day to the system, just to track 
down a "warez d00d?" fuck that. besides, they dont even have direct dialups, 
everything goes through sprintnet...that makes it even harder. what about the 
people who use TCP connetions like i did? then not only do they have to dig 
through there own phone records and log files, but throgh the system that 
connected's phone records and logs. i doubt that catching 1 single person, or 
even 10 people is worth the possible MILLIONS of dollars and HUNDREDS if not 
THOUSANDS of hours of reading logs you may have to send a ware or two to get 
on the list, but sometimes you dont. just try and social engeneer your way 
onto a list if they want files. dont give i now if you are successful, get all 
the files as FAST as you can out of your mailbox. they will sit there for 5 
days after theyve been read, but your acount will not last that long. you have 
at the most 48 to 72 hours before somebody like Steve Case catches on that 
your account iz fake and you get bumped. thats why you if you're unsuccessful 
and are mad, get even. forward a log of all the conversation in the room to 
steve case and skrew over all the assholes in the channel. or if you wanna be 
especially mean, take all there warez and still skrew them over. ehhehe thats 
what id do. tell them once you get all there shit that your a nark if your 
gonna go do that last bit, i suggest you DONOT use your regular net/bbs handle. 
you wouldnt want word to get out that your a nark. the way to identify who 
people are is by there names. if you see the following in the room, you will 
*xxx*    - where XXX is a group name, that person is afiled with XXX (ex: 
fbtPHi dont quote me on that exactly, but thats kinda what i noticed. so now 
you know the basics of AOL warez tradin. go and have a good time and remember, 
if you get anything kewl, forward it to me or find me on IRC and DCC it to 
me...:) ehehhe
