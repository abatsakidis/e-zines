        I

We are the hungry men
We are the stuffed men
Sitting together
Plates full with pasta. Alas!
Our dried napkins, when
we chew together
Are quiet and meaningless
As cream in dark coffee
Or crying over spilled milk
In our dry bakery

Shape without form, shade without color,
fallen bread, cakes without icing:
Those who have crossed 
With fathomed eyes, to the bakery's other Kingdom
Remember us - if at all - not as lost
Violent bakers, but only 
As the hungry men
The stuffed men.
         
        II

Donuts I dare not eat in dreams
In Candyland's dream kingdom
These do not appear: 
There, the bread is 
baked on a broken bread rack
There, is a gumdrop swinging
And sugar is
In the pastry's filling
More scrumptious and more sweet
Than an apple pie.

Let me be no nearer
In Candyland's dream kingdom 
Let me also eat
such deliberate desserts
Ice Cream, Chocolate, Crossed Popsicles
In a store
Behaving as the bakery behaves
No sweeter-

Not that final meeting 
In the pastry kingdom

        III

This is the Bakery Land
This is Candy Land
Here the gingerbread images
Are raised, here they reveive 
The reeces pieces of a worker's hand
Under the smell of an apple pie.

Is it like this
In pastry's other kingdom
Eating alone
At the hour when we are
munching with hunger pangs
Lips that would kiss
Form prayers to broken twinkies.

        IV

The eggs are not here
There are no eggs here
In this valley of dying poultry
IN this hungry valley
This half-eaten omlet of our lost chickens.
In this last of eating places
We gorge together
And avoid speech
Gathered on this plate of the china set

Restless, unless
The forks reappear
As the perpetual pastry
Multifoliate frosting rose
Of sugar's twilight kingdom
The hope only
of empty calories.

Here we go round the bakers square
Bakers square bakers square
Here we go round the bakers square
At seven o'clock in the morning.

Between the HoHos
And the cupcakes
Between the sno balls
And the zingers
Falls the twinkies
                                    For thine is the King Pastry

Between the cookies 
And the cakes
All the sugars with sweet surprize;
All the things I like to bake
Falls the twinkies
                                    Life is very sweet

Between the apple pie
And the pumpkin pie
Between the cherry pie
And the lemon meringue pie
Between the key lime pie
And the strawberry rhubarb pie
Falls the twinkies
                                    For thine is the King Pastry

For Thine is
Life is
For Thine is Baklava

This is the way the breakfast ends
This is the way the breakfast ends
This is the way the breakfast ends
Not with a bang but a clogged artery.
