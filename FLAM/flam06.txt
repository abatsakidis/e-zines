it took me very long to write that poem.

oh dear.

here is a quote, taht i collected.

"they munch on small colored balls of fruit flavored grain, like trix.  
rabbits like trix.  but they can't have it because the trix kids steal 
it away, and i think that jamesy's brother is a trix are for kids kid, 
though jamesy isn't"
