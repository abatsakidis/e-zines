a story:

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

by me.

once apon a time there was a little happy red potato named TIMMY. TIMMY
was a wonderful lad. his favorite color was brown and he liked many 
things. he enjoyed writing stories and singing songs and scolding the
sun. once day timmy met a nice flower named aster. timmy and aster 
became bestest friends there ever was. they played games and drank water
and read books together. one day, timmy decided to go downstairs. aster
warned him that there were boogiemen down the stairs and that he should
stay in the room with her, where the boogiemen could not get him. he
did nto listen to her. she cried and screamed and tryed to convince him
to stay but he did not. as he was walking down the stairs he tripped
and hit his head. when little timmy came back aster was at first very
happy to find him live. but then she saw something was wrong. he looked
different. his favorite color was no longer brown. now his favorite color
was green or some such. he was no longer timmy. he was MOGEL. MOGEL had 
KILLED timmy. aster was very upset, even more so when evil mogel denied
ever having known of timmy's existance. 

mogel is now known as "MOGEL-EVIL-TIMMY-KILLER"

the end.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA


that was a most true story.

i think now i will go put flowers on timmy's grave.

goodbye.

bytheway, 9 is a wonderful number.
