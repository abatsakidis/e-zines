"my sister is dumb"
by lisa, the shoelace

i hate it when my sister kisses me. she thinks shes a flower. and she 
calls her friend mogel, Timmy. yes he is! god! yes he is! gosh. what? 
heheheheh my sister acts like a three year old, she also thinks shes 
three. shes not three. ok ok. iam my sister's favorite sister. miranda 
is my sisters least favorite sister. i won my soccer game today. it was 
fun. i got one whole very special fun joy happy-go-lucky goal. that bit 
was added. by aster. once apon a time a girl named longface was walking 
by a river when all of a sudden a huge aster plant started huging and 
kissing here. the end. the moral of the story is she shouldn't walk by 
asters. hint hint.
