The Dirty House
by Phairgirl

I was thirsty.  But we have no clean cups.  We haven't had any clean 
cups in months, because nobody does the dishes.  The dishes are stacked 
all over the kitchen--in the sink, by the sink, in the drainer, on the 
table, and on two countertops.  There are even some dishes in the 
livingroom and in people's bedrooms.

So I went into the bathroom and I stuck my head under the faucet to get 
a drink of water.  My cat came in and got jealous.  He has his own bowl 
of water on the floor.  But he HATES the bowl of water.  He has some 
kind of strange bowl paranoia.  He only likes to drink water out of the 
faucet.  So I moved over and he started drinking out of the faucet.

I walked out of the bathroom and I stared at the dishes again.  I looked 
at the bowl of water on the floor.  I walked over, knelt down, and took 
a drink.
