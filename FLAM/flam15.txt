Aster, this is "Fish and Flowers" by oregano


   I like fish and I like flowers.  One time I was fishing and I
used flowers as bait and I caught bright, rainbow fish and one
time I went to the dock and got all the fish guts from the
fishermen and used them as fertilizer in my garden and I had the
best garden ever, with super-big flowers that were as colorful
as a parade and as scented as a candle shop.
    But best of all is when I love fish or flowers separately.  I
like to pick flowers and look at them.  But if they get too close
then the flowers grab my nose and sting me with their little
pointy things in the middle of the flower.
   When I look at fish they like to wiggle in my hand and they
want to jump back in the lake, but I am too much for them and I
look at them and they look at me. I can hear them in my bucket
right now.  If you keep a lake fish in a bucket it is like you
have a monster with you.  They thump the sides of the bucket and
swish all the water and it is almost scary and you are afraid
that if you reached in the bucket they would hurt you.  They
don't hurt, but they are storng and tricky, but they are also
fishy and good.  Goodness, a fish.
  i wish I could tell you more about flowers.  I wish I could
tell you more about fish.  But they have their secrets and I have
said enough.  Now I am going to walk through the park's garden to
go to the lake.  Enjoy.
