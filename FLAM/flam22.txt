_______________________________________________________

hi.

i am 3 years old.

remember me.


here is a story. it has a beginning, and middle, and an end. it also has 
characters, a scene, and a plot (of sorts.)

here it is:

doorknobs, doors, and the car in the alley
by aster (thats me!)

one day, as phil the cat was walking to the store, he met a man named john 
fruit. john fruit lived in  the room above the store. his walls were painted 
and pinned apon in various ways. as he saw fit. over his bed was a large 
cutout of the word "bird".  he liked his walls very much. he could not say 
the same for his ceilings. they were bare. and white. and most uninteresting.
when phiol the cat got to conversing with john, they found they had alot in 
common. they both enjoyed horse races and candy corn. they also were both 
masters oh t'ai chi, their favorite pastime. they both worked in umbrella 
stores, phil, in the one on second street with the black giants and tuesday 
specials. john worked in a used umbrella store. both wore shop-aprons and 
ball caps on their heads.
soon phil and john were the best of friends. they did most everything 
together. they visited the horse racers and got each other candy corn for 
their birthdays, september 29th.  it was the same, you see.
one day while they were walking past the umbrella giant, phils workplace, 
they decided to move to alaska. so phil rushed into his store to tell his 
boss he was quiting. while inside, a crazy gun man walked in and killed the 
13 people in the store. when john saw thiws he was devistated. he sulked all 
the time and was never happy because he had lossed his best friend EVER. 
lets see, now i need an end.
john decided to move to alaska anyway, which had been his friend's dyeing 
wish. of sorts. when he got off the large airplane into alaska he ran into a 
little blind mouse called bob. they had many things in common and lived
happily ever after.

the end.
