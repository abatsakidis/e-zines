once apon a time a little bird called orange-bird went for a walk. on her 
walk orange-bird met a very nice little squrel called purple. purple and 
orange became very very good friends.  int he the summer, they went 
swimming in the big lake together, and in the winter they had snow ball 
fights.  once day purple decided to go on a long journey.  orange missed 
purple very much, so much that she became sick.  her mommy took care of 
her and tried to make her better again, but could not.  meanwhile, purple 
was having a great time on his trip.  he had met some very interesting 
people like bob the deer and mister gore, the little red mouse.  purple 
was having such a fun time that he forgot about orange altogether.  one 
day, purple decided he wanted to go home and visit his family.

when he arived at his house, purple fell asleep because he was SO tired 
from travleding.  orange-bird had heard that he was back and could not 
wait to go see him, so she visited his house.  because he was sound 
asleep she sat on a stone and waited.  purple was SO tired, and slept 
for SO long that orange turned tos tone while she was waiting.  When 
purple awoke, he found the pretty statue and figured someone had left it 
as a homecoming gift, he still did not remember orange.

As he was walking through the town, many people asked if he had visited 
his good old friend yet. he still did not remember whatthey were talking 
about, so he ignored them.


the end.
