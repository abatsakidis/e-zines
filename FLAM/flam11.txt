the bird
by dip

once apon a time there was a magnificent bird.  it had gold wings and
purple eyes. its feet were yellow with black spots and its tail was 
bright green.  its name was "Dirb". it is a very ware bird, indeed.
the last sighting of one was over 330,780,429,782 years ago.  no
one knows if there are any left deep in the suberbs of southern
californea.  but scientists have not given up hope. they say that
even though these birds have absolutly NO social skills...and cannot
fly or hunt for food or defend them selves, there is still a slight
chance for survival.  
others are skeptical, a mister robert marten claims that there is no way 
one could still be living in the outskirts of places such as Pasadena, 
	"i have lived here all my  life, aye, andhave yet to see one, 
	aye, and i go walking all the time, aye, and look up in the 
	trees, aye, where birds would be, aye, so, aye, no, aye, i don;t 
	see at as a posibillity, aye."
	"but mister marten, the Dirb cannot fly, how would it get up in
	the trees?"
	"Aye!"
so, as you can see there is much debate as to the extinction of this rare
treasure, the Dirb.
