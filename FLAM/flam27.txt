word of the day:

FAVORITE - to eat sheep, and roast them in bananas and blood sauce.

---------------------

	Once apon a time, in the land of most far away and most distant, 
there lived a young princess named Katie.  Katie was the most most 
alot-est beautiful princess in the land.  She wore many pretty dresses 
that were shiny and gold covered and beaded and lacey.  She wore silver 
jewelry with garnets and diamonds and emeralds and many more pretty shiny 
things.  Her hair was a pretty pink color, with blue polka dots.

	One day, while princess Katie was walking through the castle 
gardens and looking at all the pretty flowers- asters and roses and orchids
 and tulips and daisys and other sorts of pretty colors and leaves and 
living things,- she met a young chipmonk who was quite out of luck.  You 
see, the young chipmonk had lost many of his things to a bad game of 
cards, and he did this often. so the good princess Katie took him into 
her house and spoiled him rotten.

	Now, they spent two happy years together and the little chipmonk 
fell quite in love with the princess Katie.  but she was blind and dumb 
and did not know.  When another handsom young prince came to her house to 
ask for her hand in marriage, she accepted.  She soon left the chipmonk 
and her home, forgetting about him entirely.

	This made the little chipmonk very sad. it also made him very 
mad, so mad that the first time he could, he went to her new home and 
murdered her new husband.  She hated him for this and killed him to.  
Then she was tried and hung for murder and then a big asteroid came and 
killed everyone.

THE END
