"Luther, The Strong Mouse"
by Timmy

        Well, I think that it's only appropriate that I tell you about
 myself before I write a story.  My name is Timothy.  I chose this name
 tonight.  You see, I bumped my head and I can not for the life of me
 remember a single thing about who I am.  So, I guess I have to start over.
 The person who I used to be has really bad taste.  His room is a mess.
 And he must have smelled like a potato.  Yuck.

        _LUTHER: THE STORY OF THE STRONG, HAPPY MOUSE_

        Once upon a time, there was a very special mouse.  He had very
 strong legs and was able to climb up 10 hills a day without getting tired.
 All the other mice looked up to this mouse.  His name was Luther.  His
 favorite color was brown, the best color around.  He ate lobster.  He wrote
 in his diary sometimes, too.

        "DEAR DIARY," he'd write.  "I LIKE BEING SO STRONG.  IT'S VERY NICE."

        He would feel good each and every day of his life, until one day,
 two weeks ago, a VERY large bird.. a CROW.. came to town.  The crowe was
 MUCH stronger than the mouse, but the mouse was too self-confident to
 notice.

        "Hey Luther," said the crow, "I challenge you to a wing-wrestling
 match."

        "You will most certainly lose, Crow," Luther spouted out.  He
 flexed his arms and showed all his muscles.  "oooooh!" all the mice said,
 in awe.

        "If I win, I get to EAT you, Luther!" The Crow cackled.

        "I will not lose," Luther assured everyone.

        "Okay, put your wing on the table and let's get to it!" the crow
 demanded!

        "Wait.  I don't have a wing!  I have arms and legs!" The mouse said.

        "It looks like I automatically WIN!" The Crow declared, and ate up
 ALL THE MICE EVERYWHERE.  HE ATE UP EVERY SINGLE MOUSE AND GOT VERY FAT BUT
 HE WAS HAPPY.
