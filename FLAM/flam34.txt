"Pickle in a Pickle"
by oregano

     Once upon a time there was a pickle who could not talk. He
walked into a store and said, "Hi, I am a pickle and I would like
a bag of cherries." Except he was not able to talk, something is
wrong in this story; but still he got some cherries, but I forgot
how.  Also I forgot that the pickle had no legs and so there was
no way he could walk into the store. Maybe I have it all wrong
and the pickle who could not walk and who could not talk did not
get any cherries.
     Wait here.
     Wait.
     Okay?
     I am going to ask my Mom.
     This will be very quick.
     Wait.
     Okay, I just asked her and she said she saw the pickle
eating a bag of cherries and she was not sure how he got them and
she said she is really busy right now and she might remember
later and that right now you and me should go downstairs and
watch TV or she is going to have to make it nap time and I am not
really tired right now.
