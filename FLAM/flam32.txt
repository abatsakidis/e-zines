Run-on Sentence

   One fine day as I was walking through the park, I came upon a hrose who told me that I was to continue walking until I met another hrose, so I did, and I eventually met the second hrose, who looked at me funny, but I didn't say anything because he was very big, but certainly not as big as the biggest hrose I saw,  and I spoke some kind words, and he looked at me once before jumping in the air and screaming that I have to go find the magical garden, so I did, and when I found it, I picked from it a magical yellow aster and put it in my pocket, and with a smile on my face, I left the park to go to Becky's house, where I delivered the aster, and she smiled and a hrose broke in, and I smote it with my magical hrose-slaying sword, and the hrose turned to dust with a shriek, and then Becky said, "My hero!" and then Becky said, "My hero!" and with that, we left her house and flew to Saturn in our spacecraft.
