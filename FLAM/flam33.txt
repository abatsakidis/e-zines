"scared to wake"

And scared to wake 
    from childhood dreams
    we built imaginations
    from what we had seen
    then moved away
    to some place free
    across the mountains
    to the eastern sea
    to the halls of learning
    physics, astronomy, and maths
    to office buildings of towering glass.

"unimpressed day"

on this unimpressed day
whose nights seem like all others
monotonous and slow
but nearly over
as the sky lightens
outside the window
and you will know it is morning
when the seagulls begin to perch
tapping with beak and wing
the plasticky window pane of glass
and almost soon
the sun will rise
as you examine
the empty coffee pot
and the loud hissing
of steam from beside the stove
and roll over again
with your eyes firmly closed

______


she moves through the fair 
and it seems darker there 
in the corner where she stood 
where the air's grown colder 
and there lingers 
the fragrance of death 
across the carnival rides 
and merry go rounds 
her face becomes a vision 
that will someday reappear 
in the photographs i took 
of the corner where she stood 
and i will remember her 
the little lonely girl 
that moved through the fair
