"I don't think talk." 
by BMC


I don't know.  I.  I percieve.  I judge.  I try to understand.
I know nothing outside of I.  I am this tall.  I am this smart.  I am this
and I am not this.  I do not care to define 'this'.  I care.  I am not
worried.  I am one.  I am more.  I am not you.  I am waiting for the
computer.  I am not there.  I am here.  I recognize.  I don't care.  I
walk.  I sit.  I look cool sometimes.  I seem perfect.  I do not
understand contentment.  I am selfish.  I want to sleep.  I forget what
colours look good on me.  I don't have time.  I need to learn.  I must be
faster.  I  must be smarter.  I must do better.  I must not die or give
up.  I must repeat.  I.
