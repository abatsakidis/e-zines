                            "Pretty Stones"

	Wanda discovered the place where all happiness comes from. She 
was was walking up a cool stream, looking for pretty stones for her 
pretty stone collection. Wanda moved big rocks aside as she came to 
them, looking underneath for small, prettier stones and she accidently 
moved aside a big stone that held back happiness. She looked with glee 
as all the happiness that was trapped by the stone was released and went 
flying into the world. 
	The next morning she woke up and all the newspapers had headlines 
which were happy. She read them all and was happy herself that she caused
all the happiness to be let out. 
	But a week later, Wanda noticed that the headlines each day were 
lass and less happy. The headlines became angry then angrier. 
	Wanda went back to the stream and walked up it, past all sorts of 
pretty rocks. She found the place where happiness comes from. She saw that
all the happiness that had built up was gone, there was no more in 
reserve, moving the rock had released a lot of happiness but now there was
no more to go out. 
	Wanda rolled the stone back to its original place, blocking where 
happiness comes from, but not cutting it off. Balance was restored in a 
few days and happiness was back in the world in its normal amount. 
	Now Wanda only rolls back the stone twice a year. Once on 
Christmas so everyone can be happy together, and once on her birthday, 
so she can have the happiest birthdays ever.
