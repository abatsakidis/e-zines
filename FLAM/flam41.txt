itchy people tend to itch other people even when they dont want to be
itched or scratched or touched in any kind of manner gentle or sticky or
not.

when they get out we better go, toward the country where the horses and
things live.  i dont know.  nevermind.  magazine clippings would fit so
well here:

      See.  Here fits a triangle shaped bit of red, with blue stripes.

         .
            .
...............

but not white too.  and less blue even, it gets to obvious.  oblivious.
oblivion.  

is that bad?

Yes, Very Bad.
