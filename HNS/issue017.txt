General security news 
-------------------------------- 


HOW TO ELIMINATE SECURITY THREATS 
The majority of successful attacks on computer systems via the Internet can 
be traced to exploitation of one of a small number of security flaws. Most of 
the systems compromised in the Solar Sunrise Pentagon hacking incident were 
attacked through a single vulnerability. A related flaw was exploited to break 
into many of the computers later used in massive distributed denial of service 
attacks.

DNS SECURITY IN AUSTRALIA 
Australian Internet security company DeMorgan released a document which is 
revealing the state of DNS security within Australia at the present moment. 
The reult - "Of the total number of servers tested, 75% were discovered to be 
vulnerable to DoS attacks though misconfigurations and/or inappropriate version 
of bind being used whilst 52% were discovered to be vulnerable to root 
compromise from inappropriate version of bind being used". Thanks to Craig 
Wright for sending in the papers.

HACKERS AS A RESOURCE 
Earlier this month, Kevin Mitnick told CIO magazine that hiring hackers is the 
best way for companies to learn about security threats. The magazine says its 
poll of corporate CIOs found nearly one in three willing to hire Mitnick to advise 
them on security preparedness.

any type of problem in its systems and has not received any form of complaint 
from clients that has to do with the supposed virus".

VBS PLAN WORM 
Plan.A is a new e-mail spreading worm that has been seen in the wild in US. The 
worm spreads through e-mail using Microsoft Outlook. It arrives as an e-mail with 
either randomly generated text subject line or the following: "us president and 
fbi secrets =please visit => (http://www.2600.com)<=" (original message is in 
caps lock).

LINUX 101: BASIC NETWORK SECURITY 
"Enterprise-wide security strategies require far more explanation than I can possibly 
include in a 101 series (or even a single article), so I'll just run through a simple 
method of locking down a machine on a LAN that is not behind a firewall and that 
needs quick and cheap protection from unwanted guests. Oh yes; I'll also keep in 
mind you'll be doing so with limited Linux knowledge."

FIGHTING CYBERCRIME 
"It is essential to establish a swift and efficient system of international 
cooperation ... (in) the fight against crime in a computer environment," the 
ministers from 41 European nations including Russia said in a communique.

MEDIA PROMOTION 
The Register published a good rant on "the video trojan", where they speak of 
the company who found it as "an opportunistic security firm in quest of free 
advertising in the form of media attention".

WINN's WAR AGAINST THE NET 
In a column on ZDNet's Interactive week, Lewis Z. Koch commented on Winn 
Schwartau's newest book called "Cybershock - Surviving Hackers, Phreakers, 
Identity Thieves, Internet Terrorists and Weapons of Mass Disruption". It is "slick 
attempt to terrorize the reader about the dangers of the Internet and the 
fearsome, loathsome 'hackers' who lurk within marks a new low" - Koch writes.

CYBERAGENTS a.k.a BOTS 
In March 2000, Ray Parks, leader of Sandia's government and corporate computer 
defence testing, and his Red Team attacked a five computer network at Sandia

failed. The cyberagents, without outside assistance, held off four, experienced, 
human hackers for 16 hours.

commercial firewall product in 1990."

Security issues 
---------------------- 

IE 5 Cross-frame security vulnerability 
Internet Explorer 5.01 under Windows 98 (suppose all other versions are also 
vulnerable) allows circumventing "Cross frame security policy" by accessing 
the DOM of documents using JavaScript, IFRAME and WebBrowser control. 
This exposes the whole DOM of the target document and opens lots of 
security risks. This allows reading local files, reading files from any host, 
window spoofing, getting cookies, etc

Kdelibs vulnerability for setuid KDE applications 
There is a very serious vulnerability in the way KDE starts applications that allows 
local users to take over any file in the system by exploiting setuid root KDE 
application. The only vulnerable application shipped with OpenLinux is kISDN, but 
third party software might be vulnerable too. 
Link: < http://net-security.org/cgi-bin/bugs/fullnews.cgi?newsid960371104,7613, > 


ColdFusion Web Application Server DoS attack 
A denial of service vulnerability exists within the Allaire ColdFusion web application 
server which allows an attacker to overwhelm the web server and deny legitimate 
web page requests. 
Link: < http://net-security.org/cgi-bin/bugs/fullnews.cgi?newsid960482396,65647, > 


Sendmail Workaround for Linux Capabilities Bug 
The Sendmail Consortium and Sendmail, Inc. has been informed of aserious problem 
in the Linux kernel that can be used to get rootaccess. This is not a sendmail security 
problem, although sendmailis one of the vectors for this attack.

Allaire Security Bulletin (ASB00-14) 
Allaire has recently been notified by Foundstone, Inc. (see Revisions section below 
for contact information) of a denial of service attack against an unprotected 
installation of the ColdFusion Administrator. This issue only affects ColdFusion 
Servers that have not followed Allaire's recommendations in the Allaire Security 
Best Practices article 10954. The article is available at the link below.

Patch Available for "Remote Registry Access Authentication" Vulnerability 
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in Microsoft(r) 
Windows NT 4.0. Under certain conditions, the vulnerability could be used to 
cause a Windows NT 4.0 machine to fail. 
Link: < http://net-security.org/cgi-bin/bugs/fullnews.cgi?newsid960556276,81353, > 


Reporting Security Issues to Microsoft 
Microsoft security staff posted to BugTraq some information about what you should 
do if you found a security vulnerability in one of their products.

Flaws in the SSL transaction handling of Netscape 
There are some flaws in the SSL transaction handling of Netscape Version 4.72 
which could compromise encrypted SSL sessions. This update upgrades Netscape 
to version 4.73, which also fixes some annoying crashes during common usage. 
Upgrade to the new version is recommended.
