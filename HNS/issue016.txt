General security news 
-------------------------------- 

BURGLAR ALARM CATCHES ATTACKERS ON THE NET 
The service gives European companies the opportunity to outsource network intrusion detection instead 
of relying on internal security experts. Defcom showed off its flagship European "alarm centre" in Stockholm 
Monday -- from which a company's network security can remotely monitored - and said that similar centres 
are currently being tested in London and Berlin, and will be operational there after the summer.

LINUX SECURITY WEEK 
Issue number 5 of Linux Security Week has been released. Last week, the major topic of concern

DOMAIN HIJACKERS TARGET INTERNET.COM 
The would-be hijackers succeeded in forcing a change in the public Internic record for internet.com. 
As of mid-day, the WHOIS record for internet.com incorrectly listed BCS Inc. of Montreal, QC as 
the domain name owner. The domain name root records were not changed and traffic to the site was 
not affected. internet.com technical staff was assured by NSI that the DNS records would not be 
re-directed and the mistake would be rectified within hours.

Security issues 
---------------------- 

Remote DoS attack in Real Networks Real Server 
The Ussr Labs team has recently discovered a memory problem in the RealServer 7 Server (patched 
and non-patched). What happens is, by performing an attack sending specially-malformed information 
to the RealServer HTTP Port(default is 8080), the process containing the services will stop responding 
Link: < http://net-security.org/cgi-bin/bugs/fullnews.cgi?newsid959866097,16888, > 


Allegro-Software-RomPager vulnerable to DoS 
Allegro-Software-RomPager is an http server which is used in network hardware like switches to provide 
a web interface to remotely configure your hardware. It seems that sending an incorrect request to the 
switch will cause the http server to crash and then crashing the actual switch. I only tested this on a 
D-Link DES-3224+ however there are other companies which use the Allegro software for their devices.

Patch and Tool Available for "Protected Store Key Length" Vulnerability 
Microsoft has released a patch and a tool that eliminate a security vulnerability in Microsoft Windows 
2000. The vulnerability could make it easier for a malicious user who had complete control over a 
Windows 2000 machine to compromise users' sensitive information. 
Link: < http://net-security.org/cgi-bin/bugs/fullnews.cgi?newsid960034461,28982, > 


Fix for DoS in Real Networks RealServer 7 
"This afternoon a BugTraq/USSR Advisory notice was released announcing that a Denial of Service 
attack was found in the RealServer 7. We have found and fixed the problem. This particular exploit 
utilizes a bug in the URL parsing for the ViewSource feature. View Source allows source content and 
media file information on enabled RealServers to be displayed in a Web browser. The server's 
auto-restart feature will successfully determine that a problem has occurred and will restart the server 
in approximately120 seconds"...

Majordomo removed from Debian 
The majordomo package as shipped in the non-free section accompanying Debian GNU/Linux 2.1/slink 
allows any local user to trick majordomo into executing arbitrary code or to create or write files as the 
majordomo user anywhere on the filesystem. 
This is a documented issue and the advised work around it to either have no untrusted users on a 
system running majordomo or to use a setuid wrapper that the MTA delivery agent can run. 
suboptimal solution. We feel that those options are not a good solution, but unfortunately the 
majordomo license does not allow us to fix these problems and distribute a fixed version. As a 
result we have decided to remove majordomo from our archives.

Linux-Mandrake bind update 
Problem: By default bind is launched as user and group root. This setting can give the possibility to 
easily exploit vulnerabities in bind.

Linux-Mandrake Xlockmore security update 
In order to perform the password-check xlock must be setuid root and have access to the 
shadowed passwd file. In the xlockmore distributions versions prior to 4.16.1, a buffer overflow 
vulnerability was present in xlock that permitted a user to view parts of the shadowed passwd file 
Link: < http://net-security.org/cgi-bin/bugs/fullnews.cgi?newsid960210254,39590, > 


Patch Available for "SSL Certificate Validation" Vulnerabilities 
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates two security vulnerabilities in Microsoft Internet 
Explorer. The vulnerabilities involve how IE handles digital certificates; under a very daunting set 
of circumstances, they could allow a malicious web site operator to pose as a trusted web site. 
Link: < http://net-security.org/cgi-bin/bugs/fullnews.cgi?newsid960293460,80221, > 


FW-1 IP Fragmentation Vulnerability 
"...CPU mysteriously hits 100% utilization, system locks up. Some systems may also crash, 
depending on OS type... I have reason to believe that every installation of FW-1 is vulnerable, 
regardless of Operating System type or version/patch level of the FW-1 installation. However, 
this has only been tested and confirmed with ver 4.1 SP1 on the Nokia, and ver 4.1 on NT and 
Solarix x86 platform." Paper by Lance Spitzner.
