DEMONIZING CRYPTOGRAPHY
Judging from recent headlines, one would think cryptography is responsible for 
all current evils, from child pornography to global terrorism. But is it really 
something to fear?

HACKING EXPOSED REVIEW
If you spend enough time with Hacking Exposed, you could probably learn 
enough to start hacking networks yourself, although anyone else who has 
the book could probably learn enough to stop you. The fact is, if you really 
want to protect your network, you’ll need more information than any one 
book can hold. But if you want a head start on keeping your network safe, 
make sure Hacking Exposed is on your bookshelf.

BUSH FORWARDS CLINTON INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY REPORT
The Bush administration has forwarded to Congress a report on the Clinton 
administration's efforts to protect the nation's most critical computer systems 
from cyber-attack. The 200-page study was completed more than a week 
before Bill Clinton left office, but never was signed by Clinton or forwarded 
to Congress, as required by law.

SHOCKS WITH PHONE BILLS
Annette Leech received quite an unpleasant surprise when she was informed 
that $700 of calls had been rung up on her phone in a single afternoon. Watch 
out what are you downloading, because there are lot of programs that dial sex 
lines through your computer.

VIERIKA WORM
F-Secure has issued a level two alert to users of its Radar virus alerting 
service this morning. The firm has warned about a visual basic worm called 
Vierika, which is known to be circulating "in the wild." As usual with VBS 
viruses, F-Secure said that this worm spreads like LoveLetter. The firm said 
it consists of two different script parts: one that arrives in an MS-Outlook 
message as an attachment and another that is available on a Web site.

SURVEY: BREACHES DRIVE SECURITY UPGRADES
A major security breach within a company is the single greatest catalyst for 
effecting increased security measures across that organization, according to 
the results of a recently released survey from IDC. Other big drivers of increased 
security measures include the growth in Internet usage and the trend toward 
mobile computing, according to IDC. A majority of the 1,000 companies that 
responded to the survey identified viruses as the most common security problem,
with 90% saying they had been hit by a virus. The other most common security 
problem was unauthorized use of system resources and data.

CHECK POINT FIREWALL-1 ON LINUX, PART TWO
This article is the second in a series of three by SecurityFocus writer David "Del" 
Elson that looks at Check Point Firewall-1 for Linux. The first article consisted of 
a brief introductory overview of Firewall-1, and a discussion of installation, 
post-installation tasks, as well as single and multi-system installations. This 
installment will cover Firewall-1 concepts such as network objects, firewall 
rules, address translation rules, and NAT, as well as features and limitations 
of Firewall-1. The final article will then discuss aspects of Firewall-1 such as 
file and directory layout, rulesets, migrating existing Firewall-1 installation to 
Linux, and back-up and standby configurations.

FBI ROOTS OWN SYSTEMS TO FIND SPY'S BACKDOOR
The FBI is systematically searching for evidence that suspected double agent 
Robert Hanssen, who has computer programming skills, compromised systems 
at the Bureau and/or the State Department with some manner of malicious 
backdoor. "The jury is still out as to what he was able to do," the official is 
quoted as saying. But "because of the possibilities, we’ve got to take a look." 
Hanssen had the highest security clearance, which gave him access to 
extremely sensitive data. The FBI fears that he might have enabled Russian 
spies to access secure systems used by the FBI, State and other agencies.

CREDIT CARD INFO STOLEN FROM BIBLIOFIND?
After Bibliofind web site got defaced past month, internal investigation showed 
that attacker(s) had access to Bibliofind server from October 2000 and 
February 2001. Company's representative said all 98,000 customers will 
be notified of the incident via e-mail.

A TOOL FOR COLD MIRRORING OF SOLARIS SYSTEM DISKS
Minimum downtime and prevention of data loss is important for most system 
administrators. The traditional solution is to use backups or RAID to cover for 
disk failures. We describe an alternative for "cold mirroring" of system disks - 
it mounts a spare disk, copies files to the spare, installs a boot block and 
copies over a new vfstab. This creates a fully updated bootable spare disk. 
The administrator is notified of success/failure by syslog or email. This tool, 
called mirror_boot.sh, has been tested on several Solaris versions.

TOP 50 THINGS TO KNOW TO PASS SAIR EXAM 101
As I mentioned last month, you must pass four Sair exams to become a Linux 
Certified Administrator (LCA). One of the four exams is the Installation and 
Configuration 101 exam; passing this exam will earn you the designation of 
Linux Certified Professional (LCP). All of the Sair exams are available through 
Prometric testing centers. The following is a list of 50 key points to know for 
Exam 101. There is some overlap between the topics listed here and those I 
mentioned for the LPI 101 and 102 exams, due to the fact that they are 
competing certifications on the same topics.

SECURITY CONSULTANTS TO BE LICENSED
IT security consultants could soon join wheel-clampers and bouncers in 
having to apply for licences. The UK government's Private Security Industry 
Bill proposes the creation of an authority to set standards of conduct and 
training for consultants, and to carry out inspections. The Security Industry 
Authority would check a consultant's background for any criminal record 
before issuing a licence. It would also keep a public register, and establish 
a voluntary body of approved contractors.

NEW ZEALAND PHREAKING CASE
Borislav Misic arrived in New Zealand in April 1998 from Yugoslavia and a year 
later was granted refugee status. He was convicted on two counts of fraud 
and one count of forgery involving the use of a piece of "blue boxing" software 
to make 80,000 minutes of international calls using Telecom's Home Country 
Direct service. There are debates over there regarding wheter he did anything 
wrong according to the New Zealand law.

GERMANY SKEPTICAL ON US PLANS
German industry and the German government responded with skepticism to 
the news of US plans to build a national defense shield, or firewall, against 
attacks on data networks.

EMAIL SNOOPING CODE OF PRACTICE DELAYED
The Data Protection Registrar's code of practice for surveillance in the 
workplace has been delayed due to the large number of responses from 
a public consultation. The code of practice is vital for clarifying what 
employees and employers are entitled to do in the workplace following 
several pieces of new legislation. The controversial and flawed RIP Act 
opens up the possibility of widespread email and phone surveillance. But 
this has also to tie in with the Human Rights Act, which enshrines the 
right to reasonable privacy, and the Data Protection Act, which insists 
that data is recovered "in a fair and proportionate manner".

CARNIVORE, CYBERCRIME TAKE PRIME TIME
Carnivore, cryptography and cybercrime are just a few of the topics on tap 
this week at the Computers Freedom and Privacy Conference 2001 concerning 
recent developments in Internet policy and civil liberties. The conference will 
feature a forum for privacy watchdogs, free-speech activists and human-rights 
specialists to discuss how the Internet is changing society.

NAKEDWIFE VIRUS HITS U.S. MILITARY, COMPANIES
A virus advertising itself as an e-mailed photo of someone's wife has started 
infecting computers in Europe and the United States and may have started 
spreading from the U.S. military. Four different antivirus software companies 
have reported that at least 68 organizations have computers infected by 
the virus.

WHY HOTMAIL USERS GET SO MUCH SPAM
Hotmail has come under criticism for placing its subscribers' email addresses on 
a public Internet directory site when they sign up for the service, making them 
easy prey for spammers, something that has got under the skin of privacy 
activists. Unless users opt-out by checking a box on Hotmail's registration form, 
their addresses can rapidly enter spammers' databases, as Infospace's privacy 
protection methods can be bypassed using a number of methods.

POWER GRIDS COULD BE VULNERABLE TO "HACKERS"
Nationwide rolling blackouts could have a devastating impact on the economy, 
but experts also fear that the stress being placed on the nation's power grid 
could make it more susceptible to disruptions from hackers. In California's Silicon 
Valley, large Internet data centers have been blamed for stressing the region's 
power grid beyond what its Korean War-era design can handle. Now, other 
states, including Oregon, Utah and Washington, are preparing for possible 
rolling blackouts.

THE GREAT SECURITY DEBATE: LINUX VS. WINDOWS
Microsoft operating systems have often been attacked for their vulnerability, 
but the perception that the software titan's systems are insecure is changing 
as the company shores up its servers and applications. Meanwhile, supposedly 
stronger Unix and Linux systems have suffered security breaches of their own.

HACKER GROUP FINDS FAULTS IN CRACK CHALLENGE
Hacker advocacy group 2600 Australia has called on a Perth company to honor 
its promise to donate $US1 million to charity after its network security device 
remained uncracked after a 30-day public trial. 2600 Australia yesterday 
criticised the company's decision to move the cracking challenge into a 
second phase, which was to have launched on the company's website.

SECUREWAVE - STUFF MS SHOULD HAVE DONE
"Like many people, I use Microsoft products on a regular basis, but having 
spent as much or more (probably more) time in Unix, I find certain things 
frustrating. In the Unix world, I take for granted the ability to set permissions 
on files and devices. While NT and 2000 have file permissions, you cannot easily 
restrict users' access to communications ports and removable media, for example. 
I also want to be able to restrict what users can and cannot run. There are a 
number of ways to do this in Unix, with varying degrees of difficulty to 
implement and of effectiveness."

ANTI-VIRUS COMPANY BLASTS MEDIA FOR SCARE TACTICS
Susan Orbuch, spokesperson for Trend Micro, told Newsbytes misinformation 
about viruses is more dangerous than the bugs themselves. "There is a vast 
body of knowledge and folklore out there, much of which is incorrect," said 
Orbuch. "The end user is constantly exposed to misinformation and myths 
by the media and by popular fiction such as movies, TV and novels."

RUNNING SNORT ON IIS WEB SERVERS PART 2
Snort is an rule-based intrusion detection system that monitors network traffic 
by applying rules based on known attack signatures. However, in addition to 
guarding against known attacks, it is vital that an IDS be able to detect new 
or lesser-known exploits. In this article, SecurityFocus writer Mark Burnett 
introduces three strategies that will enable administrators to set up Snort to 
detect new or obscure exploits. These strategies include: monitoring outgoing 
traffic, establishing command-based rules and watching for traffic from online 
scanning sites.

ESCAN CONTENT CHECKING
eScan is a comprehensive Content Security and Traffic Scanning software 
package that checks the content in the e-mails, the attachment files and 
all the web pages. The checks are made for viruses, restricted words & 
phrases and embedded objects such as Java applets etc. before these 
reach the recipient.

DESCRAMBLE THAT DVD IN 7 LINES
Descrambling DVDs just got even easier, thanks to a pair of MIT programmers. 
Using only seven lines of Perl code, Keith Winstein and Marc Horowitz have 
created the shortest-yet method to remove the thin layer of encryption that 
is designed to prevent people - including Linux users - from watching DVDs 
without proper authorization.

CARNEGIE MELLON AND EIA JOIN FORCES
The Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) has formed a new alliance with the 
nation's top federally funded computer security group in an effort to help 
companies evade computer security threats online. The new partnership, 
dubbed the Internet Security Alliance, will draw upon the collaborative 
efforts of EIA member companies and computer security experts at Carnegie 
Mellon's Software Engineering Institute in Pittsburgh, the same unit that hosts 
the university's CERT Centers, a research and development organization 
sponsored by the Department of Defense.

MITNICK: IDENTITY THEFT EASY AS PIE
Thanks to lame online security measures, stealing an individual's identity is like 
taking candy from a baby, said Kevin Mitnick. Passwords, user names and other 
data used by financial institutions and utility companies to verify identity, such 
as an account holder's Social Security number, driver's license information and 
mother's maiden name, are readily accessible in myriad databases on the Web, 
according to Mitnick.

URL, URL, LITTLE DO WE KNOW THEE
Today we will look closer at URLs and the associated security implications. 
"Interesting" ways of using them have been known by spammers for a while, 
but now the KB spoof and the February issue of Crypto-Gram have made 
the Internet community more aware of what URLs can do.

ZEN AND THE ART OF BREAKING SECURITY - PART II
There are cases in which "gentle" techniques like timing or power analyses are 
not enough to fulfill the attacker's goal. Or the goal itself is not to break the 
protection scheme but to break through it, to the end target the mechanism 
is protecting, in a modern reenactment of Alexander the Great's "solution" to 
the Gordian knot. Enter failure-inducing attacks, in which the technique is to 
induce a failure in the very protection mechanism itself.

NSA AND FBI BIG WINNERS AT BIG BROTHER AWARDS
The great and the good, when it comes to privacy invasion, have been 
"honoured" for their efforts to mess up life for the rest on us online. Privacy 
International last night handed out "Big Brother" awards to government 
agencies, companies and initiatives which have done most to invade 
personal privacy. The National Security Agency, the US government's 
signals intelligence arm, took a lifetime menace award for "clipper, 
Echelon and 50 years of spying". In a separate category, the FBI's 
Carnivore email surveillance system was judged the most invasive 
proposal of the year.

FEDS ESCALATE WARNING ABOUT E-COMMERCE HACKS
The federal government's central computer-crime bureau reported that there 
is an ongoing and organized series of hacker attacks against e-commerce Web 
sites that has resulted in the theft of more than 1 million individual credit-card 
numbers. The National Infrastructure Protection Center said it has been working 
with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Secret Service 
for several months on the investigation and has identified more than 40 victim 
sites in 20 states.

LEVY RECOUNTS THE HISTORY OF PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY
What are the roots of cryptography, and how has it evolved over the last 30 
years? In this month's Bill's Bookshelf, Bill Rosenblatt reviews Steven Levy's 
new book on the history of public key cryptography, and finds it to be a 
balanced and engaging work.

DIFFERENT APPROACH TO INTRUSION DETECTION
A security firm has put together two intrusion detection products to create 
technology it says takes a different approach to defending against hack attacks. 
CentraxICE, from security integrator Articon-Integralis, is positioned as a product 
which provides "defence in depth" from hack attacks beyond that offered by 
firewalls. It is designed to defend against packet floods - attempts to break 
into systems by bombarding an organisation's Web server with traffic and 
thereby overwhelming an organisation's defences.

UNCOVERING THE SECRETS OF SE LINUX: PART 1
In an uncharacteristic move, the U.S. National Security Agency recently 
released a security-enhanced version of Linux - code and all - to the open 
source community. This dW-exclusive article takes a first look at this 
unexpected development - what it means and what's to come - and 
delves into the architecture of SE Linux.

MICROSOFT CO-OPTS OPEN SOURCE APPROACH
In a major extension of corporate policy, Microsoft has quietly started a 
program to provide selected large enterprise customers with copies of the 
source code for Windows 2000 (Professional, Server, Advanced Server and

LAWYERS WITH HACKING SKILLS
With online and other various computer attacks against companies becoming 
increasingly common, corporate lawyers are arming themselves with new 
technical skills. "Ultimate Hacking: Hands On," a new crash course offered by 
the security-consulting firm Foundstone, will teach lawyers about common 
cybercrimes by re-enacting them in the classroom. Lawyers will come out of 
the course a bit more dangerous than when they walked in. Among the new 
skills they'll acquire is the ability to create a backdoor into a company's 
system using a remote-access Trojan, an application that allows crackers 
to gain access to restricted networks.

CRYPTOGRAPHY TOOLS: ARE THEY REALLY ONLY FOR CROOKS?
"Are there crypto success stories out there? I suspect that the kinds of shops 
using crypto are also the kinds of shops that don't talk about their work, but I 
hope some of you will write and tell me that crypto is working for your company, 
and how so. Until I'm convinced otherwise, I have to stick with the position that 
crypto is just more trouble than it's worth, and that it's likely to lull you into a 
false sense of security."

EU ENCRYPTION SYSTEM NOT BROKEN
Paranoia is alive and well at the European Union Commission, which has been 
forced to officially deny its encryption system has been compromised by the 
NSA. Fears of eavesdropping by the ultra-secretive US spy agency grew out 
of comments by a Commission employee, Briton Desmond Perkins, who told a 
EU Parliamentary committee of regular but unsuccessful attempts by the NSA 
to crack the Commission's encryption system.

All vulnerabilities are located at:
http://net-security.org/text/bugs


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TROJANED REALITY FUSION APPLICATION
The executable rfupd.exe included in the Reality Fusion products bundled with 
many popular cameras sends data to 204.176.10.168 port 80 every time you 
use the app, reboot your computer or change configuration.

SLIMSERVE HTTPD DIRECTORY TRAVERSAL
it is possible to view dir. and (download) files outside of the wwwroot directory.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/983755986,60952,.shtml


BROKER FTP SERVER 5.0 VULNERABILITY
Users can break out of their root directory and list directories. Depending on 
the priv. you have other commands like delete maybe executed outside of 
the home. directory.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/983756002,47106,.shtml


REMOTE BUFFER OVERFLOW IN POST-QUERY
The overflow condition is *very* easily exploitable, since the code actually 
supplies the pointer to the exploit code itself, odd as it maye seem. The 
pointer thusly does not need to be second-guessed at all, making life much 
easier for crackers.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/983838961,73107,.shtml


VULNERABILITIES IN CURRENT IRCD'S TKSERV
There are 3 major bugs in the current IRCd distribution (as used on the IRCnet 
for example). The included service daemon 'tkserv' (tkserv.c v1.3.0 and all 
previous versions) suffers from:
a) remote exploitable buffer overflow while querying tklines
b) memory leck due to strdup'ing a string and not freeing the mem
c) format string bug while reading the ircd's config file
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/983839093,38311,.shtml


SUSE LINUX - CUPS UPDATE
A SuSE-internal security audit conducted by Sebastian Krahmer and Thomas 
Biege revealed several overflows as well as insecure file handling. These bugs 
have been fixed by adding length-checks and securing the file-access.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/983840455,45873,.shtml


DEBIAN LINUX - SUDO BUFFER OVERFLOW
Todd Miller announced a new version of sudo which corrects a buffer overflow 
that could potentially be used to gain root privilages on the local system. This 
bugfix has been backported to the version which was used in Debian GNU/Linux 
2.2. The most recent advisory covering sudo missed one architecture that was 
released with 2.2. Therefore this advisory is only an addition to DSA 031-1 and 
only adds the relevant package for the powerpc architecture.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/983880197,9394,.shtml


DEBIAN LINUX - REMOTE DOS IN PROFTPD
In Debian Security Advisory DSA 029-1 we have reported several vulnerabilities 
in proftpd that have been fixed.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/983880227,72205,.shtml


DEBIAN LINUX - MGETTY UPDATE
In Debian Security Advisory DSA 011-1 we have reported insecure creation of 
temporary files in the mgetty package that have been fixed.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/983880279,18936,.shtml


DEBIAN LINUX - PROFTPD UPDATE
The following problems have been reported for the version of proftpd in Debian 
2.2 (potato): 
1. There is a configuration error in the postinst script, when the user enters 
'yes', when asked if anonymous access should be enabled. The postinst script 
wrongly leaves the 'run as uid/gid root' configuration option in /etc/proftpd.conf, 
and adds a 'run as uid/gid nobody' option that has no effect. 
2. There is a bug that comes up when /var is a symlink, and proftpd is restarted. 
When stopping proftpd, the /var symlink is removed; when it's started again a 
file named /var is created.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/983965297,39939,.shtml


LINUX MANDRAKE - JOE UPDATE
The joe text editor looks for configuration files in the current working directory, 
the user's home directory, and finally in /etc/joe. A malicious user could create 
their own .joerc configuration file and attempt to get other users to use it. If 
this were to happen, the user could potentially execute malicious commands 
with their own user ID and privileges. This update removes joe's ability to use

DEBIAN LINUX - EPERL BUFFER OVERFLOW
Fumitoshi Ukai and Denis Barbier have found several potential buffer overflow 
bugs in our version of ePerl as distributed in all of our distributions. When eperl 
is installed setuid root, it can switch to the UID/GID of the scripts owner. 
Although Debian doesn't ship the program setuid root, this is a useful feature 
which people may have activated locally. When the program is used as 
/usr/lib/cgi-bin/nph-eperl the bugs could lead into a remote vulnerability as well.

INDEXU AUTHENTICATION BYPASS
INDEXU uses a web frontend to manage every database it uses. The admin 
section is located in /admin. When you login there it asks for a user name 
and password (defaults to admin/admin). Once you log in it sets a cookie 
with the following format: 
host.where.indexu.is.installed TRUE / FALSE 1388494785 cooki e_admin_authenticated 1
This cookie will (or should be) deleted when the current session finis hes, and is 
used to determine whether you are an admin or not.

WEBSWEEPER INFINITE HTTP REQUEST DOS
The Websweeper application from Baltimore Technologies is vulnerable to a 
Denial of Service attack. Malicious usage can lead to the application crashing.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/984082157,92183,.shtml


VULNERABILITY IN NOVELL NETWARE
Novell Netware allows a user to log into a Novell Network by using a Printer 
Server as the username. By default, Novell Print Servers have blank passwords. 
In addition, Novell Print Servers do not have intruder detection capability as a 
user account would, so they are vulnerable to a brute force attack without risk 
of account lockout. When a Print Server is logged into as a User, the account 
will have the same rights as are assigned to the container that it resides in.

result in execution of arbitrary code encoded in the message.
