WORLD OF SPIES GETS PORTAL 
While the secrets of the Russian secret services aren’t likely to be made available 
to the general public anytime soon, a curious person can now turn to a new 
Internet portal, www.agentura.ru, to make basic inroads into the murky world 
of spies. "We’re counting on the big existing interest in this topic and we want 
to fill in the information vacuum," said Andrei Soldatov, a political journalist with 
the influential Izvestia daily, who together with his father - Alexei Soldatov, 
president of the Relcom Internet provider - started the portal.

MORE ON CARNIVORE 
Several prominent universities have rejected the U.S. Justice Department's 
appeal to universities to test an electronic eavesdropping device known as 
Carnivore. Researchers from four universities have complained that the 
department has too much control over the review, and their public comments 
have prompted a fifth university to ignore the department's request.

720 WEB SITES DEFACED 
Some of the sites remain defaced early Monday morning, with an anti-racism 
message left by the hacker, who calls him or herself "piffy." Piffy belongs to a 
group known as the RootShellHackers.

INTRODUCTION TO ENCRYPTION 
Joshua Ryder did a good job with this introductive article. It goes from the 
very basics of explaining what encryption is ("Encryption is the process of 
converting data from one form into ciphertext"), and goes along with some 
basic examples of how encryption works.

A FEW RECIPES FOR EASIER FIREWALLS 
"Every day, we hear of damage caused by viruses, of new exploits through 
which crackers compromise systems. For those of us in the information technology 
restaurant business, these are challenging times. We must be ever vigilant. A 
good firewall, then, is an excellent beginning. But how to do it simply is the question..."

QAZ.TROJAN 
This new backdoor Trojan allows attackers to access and control an infected 
system. TROJ_QAZ was initially distributed as "Notepad.exe" but might also 
appear with different filenames. Once an infected file is executed, TROJ_QAZ 
modifies the Windows registry so that it becomes active every time Windows 
is started. TROJ_QAZ also renames the original "notepad.exe" file to 
"note.com" and then copies itself as "notepad.exe" to the Windows folder. 
This way, the Trojan is also launched every time a user runs Notepad. 
TROJ_QAZ also attempts to spread itself to other shared drives on local 
networks.

MASSIVE DDOS? 
Attackers are using the rcp.statd and wu-ftpd vulnerabilities to ready 
another distributed Denial of Service attack. MSNBC is reporting there are 
at least 560 computers infected.

SMARTCARDS BENEFIT FROM BIOMETRICS 
Fingerprint authentication specialist Veridicom has announced a new combined 
smartcard reader and fingerprint scanner that is designed to improve smartcard 
authentication systems by replacing passwords with biometric security. Analyst 
firm Gartner Group recently reported that each year firms spend $350 per user 
managing password issues.

AN INTERVIEW WITH PIMPSHIZ 
"I met pimpshiz in the time span that Observers has been up, sometime in 
the last two years, when the news reports broke about "pimpshiz" having 
been responsible for the widespread defacement of websites in a protest over 
the potential closing of Napster. I wondered if it was the same individual we 
here at observers knew, and to my shock it was."

EXPLOITATION OF RCP.STATD AND WU-FTPD VULNERABILITIES 
Sites involved in related incidents are reporting finding hosts compromised 
through one of these two vulnerabilities. In several cases, hundreds of 
compromised hosts have been involved in single incidents. Intruders appear to 
be using automated tools to probe for and exploit vulnerable hosts on a 
widespread scale. A large majority of the compromised hosts involved in this 
activity have been running various versions of Red Hat Linux. Insecure default 
configurations in some versions, especially with respect to the vulnerable 
rpc.statd service often being enabled during automated installation and upgrade 
processes, have contributed to the widespread success of these attacks.

PGP "UNHASHED SUBPACKET" PROBLEM - SERIOUS? 
"I've been studying the UNIX source code for PGP 6.5.1i, and it seems to me 
that the "unauthorized ADK" bug could be just one manifestation of what may 
in fact be a far more serious problem.As best I can tell, PGP's that implement 
the new (version-4) data format do not appear to care whether ANY signature 
subpacket is in the hashed section of the signature or not. If I'm right, the 
signature hashing mechanism can be bypassed completely, and ANY info in 
ANY version-4 signature (not just ARR/ADK info) can be easily forged by a 
malicious attacker."

SECURITY SCANNERS 
"There are various tools available for Linux system scanning and intrusion 
detection. I will explain some of the very famous tools available. I have 
divided the scanners into three categories: Host Scanners, Network Scanners, 
and Intrusion Scanners."

LINUX COMMUNITY SNUBS SDMI HACKER CHALLENGE 
The Linux Journal is sponsoring a boycott of the Secure Digital Music Initiative 
hacking challenge, which promises to pay $10,000 to any hacker who strips 
out the watermark from a digital song. Some Linux lovers say the record industry 
is using the hackers as a "free consulting" service to help it crack down on 
legal uses of music in the future, in an attempt to exert unprecedented control 
over when and where people play songs.

REPORTS RAISE QUESTIONS OVER WEB SECURITY 
Fresh doubt has been cast on the security of using the Internet for commercial 
purposes after several high-profile Web sites were targeted by attackers. Two 
separate reports say that while consumers may prefer to use e-mail rather than 
the telephone, inefficient and insecure systems mean they often have to resort 
to the telephone anyway.

MICHIGAN "ANTI-HACKER" LAW'S FIRST FELONY CHARGES 
Attorney General Jennifer Granholm today announced that she has filed felony 
criminal charges against two Michigan men each accused of unlawfully entering 
a third-party computer system. The charges are the first under a Michigan 
law which makes the unauthorized alteration, damage or use of a computer 
system a felony.

NEW TECHNOLOGY TRACKS, KILLS DOS ATTACKS AT ISP LEVEL 
With the DoS attacks on the rise, four University of Washington computer 
networking experts formed a company, called Asta Networks, aimed at protecting 
websites from assaults. Stefan Savage, a Ph.D. candidate whose research is 
at the center of Asta's technology, said he and his computer science advisors 
decided they could have a greater impact on the industry by forming a company 
rather than by writing papers.

ONLINE FRAUDSTERS FLEECE UK ETAILERS 
Online crime pays, according to a report published today by Experian. The global 
information solutions group claims nine out of ten efraudsters aren't caught and 
are simply getting away with it. The survey reveals that when it comes to 
checking the authenticity of credit card transactions, many of Britain's etailers 
are lax. The survey of 800 British etailers found that many online authentication 
systems were wanting and most relied on manual systems to check credit card 
details.

E-SIGNATURE ACT 
Some deals are still done with a signature on the dotted line, even with the 
advent of the Net. San Francisco-based LeaseExchange can process a rental 
request in less than a minute, but it can take days to execute leases – that 
is, getting everyone to sign the paperwork. CEO Aaron Ross admits it's "a very 
inefficient process right now." He's eager to see whether authentication 
technologies will speed things up without harming customer relationships.

Security issues 
--------------- 

All vulnerabilities are located at: 
http://net-security.org/text/bugs 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER PLUGIN ISSUE 
WebSphere uses the HTTP Host: header to decide which WAS Virtual Host will 
service a particular request. If you send huge amounts of data in the Host: 
request header. Depending on how many bytes were in the Host: header, you 
could cause the web server process to fault on either signal 11 (SIGSEGV) or 
signal 10 (SIGBUS). 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/969275035,75755,.shtml 


INTERNET SHOPPER'S MAIL SERVER OPEN RELAY BUG 
Internet Shopper Ltd's Mail Server can be made to accept and handle mail for 
non-local sites. The version involved is Internet Shopper Ltd's Mail Server v3.02.13 
Exploit: The use of the semi-colon in the "mail from" command will allow mail to 
be sent to machine that aren't local. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/969274960,45311,.shtml 


MDAEMON WEB SERVICES HEAP OVERFLOW DoS 
The Mdaemon Worldclient on TCP port 3000 and the Mdaemon Webconfig on 
TCP port 3001 both contain the same vulnerability. If a certain request is sent 
to the web service, it results in a heap overflow, crashing the service with a 
Dr. Watson access violation. This appears to be a general problem in the way 
that Mdaemon handles these kinds of URLs, so if other Mdaemon web services 
are used, those are probably vulnerable as well. The reason that the before 
mentioned services were tested is that they are enabled in a default installation. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/969274876,97962,.shtml 


VULNERABILITY IN CAMSHOT SERVER 
CamShot is a web server that serves up web pages containing time stamped 
images captured from a video camera. This product contains a remotely 
exploitable security vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to gain elevated 
privileges on the remote system. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/969156843,52782,.shtml 


MICROSOFT'S NTML PATCH RE-RELEASED 
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in the 
telnet client that ships with Microsoft(r) Windows 2000. The vulnerability could, 
under certain circumstances, allow a malicious user to obtain cryptographically 
protected logon credentials from another user. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/969156774,38080,.shtml 


SAMBAR SERVER SEARCH CGI VULNERABILITY 
The vulnerability occurs in the search.dll Sambar ISAPI Search shipped with this 
product. This dynamic link loader does not check on the 'query' parameter that 
is parsed to the server, therefore by constructing a malformed URL we are able 
to view the contents of the server, all folders, and files. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/969156650,43479,.shtml 


RED HAT LINUX - FORMAT STRING EXPLOIT IN SCREEN 
Screen allows the user to overload the visual bell with a text message that can 
be set by the user. This text message is handled as a format string, instead of 
as a pure string, so maliciously written format strings are allowed to overwrite 
the stack. Since screen in Red Hat Linux 5.2 and earlier releases was setuid 
root, this security hole could be exploited to gain a root shell. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/968981154,31859,.shtml 


SLACKWARE LINUX - XCHAT INPUT VALIDATION BUG FIXED 
An input validation bug was found to affect Slackware Linux 7.0, 7.1, and 
-current. The problem is described in detail here: 
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1601 
Users of Slackware 7.0, 7.1, and -current are urged to upgraded to the 
xchat.tgz package available in the Slackware -current branch. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/968981067,67750,.shtml 


LINUX MANDRAKE - MOD_PHP3 UPDATE 
A problem exists with PHP3 and PHP4 scripts regarding RFC 1867-based file 
uploads. PHP saves uploaded files in a temporary directory on the server, using 
a temporary name that is referenced as the variable $FOO where "FOO" is the 
name of the file input tag in the submitted form. Many PHP scripts process $FOO 
without taking measures to ensure that it is in fact a file that resides in the 
temporary directory. Because of this, it is possible for a remote attacker to 
supply an arbitrary file name as the value for $FOO by submitting a standard 
form input tag by that name, and thus cause the PHP script to process arbitrary 
files. The vulnerability exists in various scripts, and not necessarily with PHP 
itself, as the script determines what actions to perform on the uploaded file.

CYLINK NETHAWK VPN "BEST BUY" IN SC MAGAZINE - [15.09.2000] 

E-business security solutions provider Cylink Corporation announced that its 
NetHawk VPN, a high-performance virtual private network appliance for 
establishing secure Internet communications, has been named “Best Buy” in 
the September issue of SC Magazine. The information security magazine’s 
product review lauded NetHawk for “its exceptional speed and reliability” and 
the VPN’s PrivaCy Manager, a policy-based management application. “Once the 
device manager is installed, it is extremely scaleable; you simply plug in new 
boxes as and when you need them, which is perfect for any growing business,” 
the review said.

ISSUES: THE SECURITY OF ELECTRONIC BANKING, LEGACY OF THE C0W by Thejian 

The article starts with the Dutch television show that exposed the Dutch banking 
organisation ABN AMRO's HomeNet program as being insecure. Computer science 
students had found a way to trick this electronic banking system into redirecting 
a user's bank transfers to a different account. As could have been expected, press 
and consumer organisations fell en masse for the possibilities the idea of"hackers" 
snooping around in your bank account presented. And it doesn't stop there...

VIRUS SCANNER INADEQUACIES WITH NTFS by Chris Brenton 

While the existence of data streams within the NT file system (NTFS) has been 
known for many years (Microsoft has released quite a bit of info on alternate 
streams), virus vendors have not taken steps to adequately check this area of 
the file system. This deficiency can be leveraged in order to hide malicious code 
or even cause the virus scanner itself to destroy critical system files.

A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE ACROSS THE BORDER by Hyper Viper

BUILDING A BASTION HOST USING HP-UX 11 by Kevin Steves 

A bastion host is a computer system that is exposed to attack, and may be a 
critical component in a network security system. Special attention must be paid 
to these highly fortified hosts, both during initial construction and ongoing 
operation. This paper presents a methodology for building a bastion host using 
HP-UX 11. While the principles and procedures can be applied to other HP-UX 
versions as well as other Unix variants, the focus is on HP-UX 11.

NETWORK INTRUSION DETECTION OF THIRD PARTY EFFECTS by Richard Bejtlich 

The main goal of this paper is to familiarize the reader with reactions and 
responses from innocent victims, who may be subject to reconnaissance or 
denial of service. If a perpetrator spoofs your address space you may see 
unsolicited traffic from an innocent second party.

PROPHYLAXIS OF COMPUTER INFECTION by Kaspersky Lab 

One of the major methods of fighting computer viruses, like in medical science, 
is timely prophylaxis or preventive measures. Computer preventive measures 
suggest following a small set of rules, allowing to lower considerably the 
possibility of virus infection and data loss. To define the main rules of computer 
hygiene, it is necessary to find out the main ways of virus intrusion into 
computer and computer network.

KASPERSKY LAB REFUTES ACCUSATIONS ABOUT THE SPREADING OF "VIRUS HYSTERIA" 

Given the latest events, Kaspersky Lab would like to once again confirm its 
position regarding the danger present in the NTFS alternate data streams. 
Furthermore, we state that by continuing to ignore the problem and not taking 
similar steps-steps that Kaspersky Lab has already taken and continues to 
take-to bring their anti-virus product up to contemporary standards, the 
aforementioned competitor anti-virus companies are neglecting their users' 
anti-virus security.

COMPUTER SECURITY WEAKNESSES PERSIST AT THE VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION 

In September 1998, the General Accounting Office reported that computer 
security weaknesses placed critical VA operations, including health care delivery, 
at risk of misuse and disruption. Since then, VA's New Mexico and North Texas 
health care systems have corrected most of the specific computer security 
weaknesses that were identified in 1998. However, serious computer security 
problems persist throughout VHA and the department.

MAIL ABUSE PREVENTION ORGANIZATION STANDS UP TO GIANT HARRIS INTERACTIVE 

Mail Abuse Prevention System, the Redwood City based anti-spam organization, 
says that it will vigorously defend the law suit filed by online market research 
giant Harris Interactive Inc. Harris has sued Microsoft, and AOL, naming MAPS as 
a co-defendant, in an effort to force Microsoft and AOL to accept unsolicited 
bulk commercial email, also known as "spam", from Harris. MAPS maintains several 
databases which companies such as Microsoft's Hotmail use to help them manage 
the Internet email traffic which crosses their networks. We have a copy of the complaint.

BUILDING LINUX CLUSTERS 

This book discusses complex modeling, virtual world creation, and image 
generation; shows readers how to choose hardware; and explains cluster 
topologies. As the author notes, Linux clusters regularly make the list of the 
world's top 500 supercomputers. Not bad for a free system. Of course, running 
your own cluster isn't trivial, but the book shows how straightforward it can be 
for basic clusters, and how far clusters can be extended. The book covers the 
all-important intermachine-communications issues in exhaustive depth. Setting 
up the hardware can be relatively straightforward as is the software installation. 
The tutorial uses Red Hat's 6 Linux distribution--it's supplied with the book--and 
adds all the clustering software and tools.

CORBA SECURITY: AN INTRODUCTION TO SAFE COMPUTING WITH OBJECTS 

The CORBA security specification adopted by the Object Management Group 
(OMG) represents a major step forward in making object technology suitable 
for business application development. The specification document, however, is 
long, detailed, and complex; it is a time-consuming task for software developers 
to make their way through it, and it is inaccessible to CIOs and other technical 
managers who need to understand object security and its impact on their 
organizations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

FIRE-WALLER (LINUX) 

Fire-Waller reads your syslog against packet filter rows and creates HTML 
output of the found rows. All addresses in logfiles are checked against a 
nameserver and protocols/services are converted from numeric values to text.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

NETWORK SECURITY ANALYSIS TOOL (LINUX) 

NSAT is a fast, stable bulk security scanner designed to audit remote network 
services and check for versions, security problems, gather information about the 
servers and the machine, and much more. Unlike many other auditing tools, it can 
collect information about services independently of vulnerabilities, which makes it 
less dependent on frequent updates as new vulnerabilities are found.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

WINDOWS 2000 IIS 5.0 HOTFIX CHECKING TOOL 

The HFCheck tool allows IIS5.0 administrators to ensure that their servers are 
up to date on all security patches. The tool can be run continuously or periodically, 
against the local machine or a remote one, using either a database on the MS web 
site or a locally-hosted copy. When the tool finds a patch that hasn't been installed, 
it can display or dialogue or write a warning to the event log.

< http://net-security.org/various/software/968181513,8218,.shtml > 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

WINZAPPER FOR WINDOWS NT 4.0 AND WIN 2K 

WinZapper can only be used from an Administrators account, thus this has 
nothing to do with any new security vulnerabilities in Windows NT / 2000. After 
an attacker has gained Administrators access to your system, you simply cannot 
trust your security log! And as always, remember that attacker having that kind 
of access can do anything to your system!
