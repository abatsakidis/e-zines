CYBER-SECURITY HELP WANTED
The administration's top security coordinator Richard Clarke once warned 
that the United States could face an "electronic Pearl Harbor" if the nation's 
electronic defenses were not strengthened. He painted an equally gloomy 
picture earlier this week. The increasing sophistication of electronic attackers, 
coupled with growing U.S. reliance on Web-based systems has created a very 
dangerous environment, Clarke said at the Global Internet Project, a gathering 
of high-tech executives. Clarke is the Bush Administration's national coordinator 
for security, infrastructure Protection, and counter-terrorism.

FORMATGUARD 1.0 RELEASED
FormatGuard is designed to provide a rapid, general solution to the large 
number of unknown format bugs expected to emerge in the next year. 
FormatGuard works by employing CPP's ability to distinguish macros with 
identical names but a different number of arguments. FormatGuard provides 
a macro definition of the printf function for each of one argument, two 
arguments, three arguments, etc., up to 100 arguments. Each of these 
macros in turn calls a safe wrapper that counts the number of % characters 
in the format string, and rejects the call if the number of arguments does not 
match the number of % directives.

US PUTS NK ON CYBER WATCH LIST
Digital Chosun: "The US Department of Defense is reportedly drawing up 
comprehensive countermeasures against possible cyber attacks from North 
Korea and China based on its judgment that the computer hacking ability of 
these two countries has reached the level of the US".

TRENDS IN HIGH-TECH SPYING
Two very different, yet related, articles appeared in this week's Wall Street 
Journal - As Technology Evolves, Spy Agency Strugges to Preserve its Hearing, 
and Software Uses Clicking Patterns to Customize Ads. Each of these articles 
discuss how an organization is attempting to spy on the private activities of 
individuals.

SOURCEFORGE SERVER COMPROMISED
Slashdot's reporting that a system on SourceForge was compromised. No 
mention is made of the issue on the site's front page, and the mail sent 
out to developers who may have been affected notes that potentially 
compromised passwords have been randomized, requiring users to get a 
new one. The e-mail sent to the developers as well as the discussion 
about this can be seen following the link below.

INSURER CONSIDERS MICROSOFT NT HIGH-RISK
J.S. Wurzler Underwriting Managers, one of the first companies to offer hacker 
insurance, has begun charging its clients 5 percent to 15 percent more if they 
use Microsoft's Windows NT software in their Internet operations. Although 
several larger insurers said they won't increase their NT-related premiums, 
Wurzler's announcement indicates growing frustration with the ongoing 
discoveries of vulnerabilities in Microsoft's products.

TREND MICRO SEEKS CURE IN VIRUS BATTLE
Eva Chen has been in the anti-virus game longer than some of the aspiring 
virus writers who keep her busy have been alive. In the 13 years since she 
helped found Trend Micro Inc., Chen, the chief technology officer, has been 
at the forefront of the battle against malicious code. Senior Writer Dennis 
Fisher caught up with Chen recently to discuss what has been a busy last 
year for the anti-virus industry and what kind of insidious viruses we can 
expect to see in the near future.

PRIVACY BECOMES A STRATEGIC ASSET
The Privacy Amendment Act was put forward at the end of last year to ensure 
that the personal information kept by the private sector was both secure and 
accessible to individuals. But with a deadline of December this year, are 
companies ready or aware of what's needed to comply?

PROTECTION FROM ELECTRONIC MESSAGE VIRUSES
The most important thing to remember about anti-virus (AV) protection is 
that no system is infallible. No matter how good your AV protection is and 
how stringent your security processes are, there is still the chance that a 
completely new virus will enter your organization and disrupt operations. Of 
course, completely isolating your systems from the Internet and removing 
them from external e-mail will greatly minimize your exposure, but in today's 
digital economy that is no longer a practical option. This article is intended 
to provide readers with a checklist of things that can be done to minimize 
their organization's vulnerability to e-mail borne computer threats.

DECSS ARGUMENTS INVOKE FREE SPEECH
Supplementary briefs have been submitted by both contestants in the appeal 
of 2600 publisher Emmanuel Goldstein, who was barred from posting or linking 
to the DeCSS descrambling utility last summer by US District Judge Lewis 
Kaplan. After hearing oral arguments for and against publishing DeCSS, which 
defeats the Content Scrambling System of DVDs back on 1 May, the Second 
Circuit US Court of Appeals in Manhattan requested supplementary written 
briefs addressing the issue of whether Corley's First Amendment rights as a 
publisher had been violated by the district court. On the 2600 side, lawyer 
Kathleen Sullivan argues, among other things, that outlawing links to DeCSS 
inhibits the free exchange of technical information.

CONFIGURING LINUX AND SQUID AS A WEB PROXY
A web proxy server is a useful service to have on your network, or between 
your network and the Internet, as it provides an extra security layer that 
insulates your users from the Internet. A proxy server can also act as a cache, 
allowing users to share downloads transparently and speeding up Internet 
access, especially for frequently-used files. Squid is a high-performance and 
relatively secure web proxy server that includes good caching facilities. It is 
one of the most commonly used proxy servers on the Internet. This article 
will give a general overview of setting up Linux and Squid as a web proxy 
server.

SULFNBK: VIRUS OR HOAX... OR BOTH?
Sophos has received a large number of calls from users concerned about a 
virus known as SULFNBK or SULFNBK.EXE. The file itself is a regular part of 
Microsoft Windows, but the Magistr virus is capable of emailing infected 
copies of SULFNBK.EXE to innocent users. Mass mails say that you must 
delete the file, but you should watch out that you don't delete it without 
purpose.

NOT SO NAKED JENNIFER LOPEZ
VBS/Lovelet-CM is an email-aware worm. The worm copies itself to a file 
called JENNIFERLOPEZ_NAKED.JPG.vbs in the Windows directory. It then 
forwards itself via email to every contact in the Microsoft Outlook address 
book with the subject "Where are you?".

THEMES.ORG DEFACED
Themes.org got defaced today by Fluffy Bunny. If you followed the story 
regarding SourceForge.net hack, you will be interested in the sequel (and 
the prequel btw). Apache.org shadow file and various sniffs were also 
pasted on Themes.org defacement.

APACHE.ORG INTRUSION
Brian Behlendorf, President of Apache Software Foundation - "Earlier this 
month, a public server of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) was illegally 
accessed by unknown crackers. The intrusion into this server, which handles 
the public mail lists, web services, and the source code repositories of all ASF 
projects was quickly discovered, and the server immediately taken offline."

PORTAL SECURITY: IT'S ALL ABOUT TRUST
If you're planning to spend a bundle of money and time building a corporate 
enterprise portal, don't overlook what could be the most important factor in 
its success: Security. Experts at a recent Intermedia Group portal conference 
in Boston stressed not to underestimate security's importance to users. Any 
plan to build Web portals, which enable businesses to collaborate, communicate, 
and engage in e-commerce with their customers, must be matched with a 
vigorous program to protect data. "Failure to implement these privacy programs 
risks alienating customers," warned David Cearley, senior vice president and 
co-research director at Meta Group in Stamford, Conn., one of the 
conference's keynote speaker.

LAYOFFS LEAD TO REVENGE HACKING
When someone cracked Slip.net's computer system, altered customer accounts 
and deleted important databases, the Internet service provider didn't need to 
look far to find the attacker. It was Nicholas Middleton, a former computer 
administrator for Slip.net, who had been unhappy at the San Francisco 
company and recently quit. Middleton fought the resulting criminal charges 
on a legal technicality but lost and got three years' probation. Federal 
investigators say this type of computer crime is on the rise. As layoffs 
become more common at technology companies, an increasing number 
of disgruntled or fired employees are hacking their companies in revenge.

INTERNET FOUNDER WORRIED OVER EU CYBERCRIME PLANS
Vint Cerf, a founding father of today's Internet, said on Thursday that European 
Union plans for new rules to fight crime on the Web risked clashing with existing 
EU privacy regulations. He told Reuters in an interview that Internet traffic 
should be retained only for billing purposes and was too cumbersome to be 
stored for police investigations. Privacy and the need to combat crime 
against the 407 million users of the Internet are concerns of the Commission 
- the European Union's executive.

CYBER-CRIME JUSTIFIES WORLD GOVERNMENT
The Council of Europe, enthused by considerable American guidance and 
support, has issued a proposed final draft for an international cybercrime 
treaty to harmonize statutes related to electronic criminal activity, cross
border police cooperation, and judicial policy throughout Europe and North 
America, more or less along lines preferred by the United States. Organized 
gangsters, terrorists and sexually-exploited children loom large in the 
document, as they always do when the natural rights of innocent adults 
are to be sacrificed to law-enforcement expedience.

OPENBSD DROPS FIREWALL PROGRAM IN LICENSING DISPUTE
When an Australian software developer tightened licensing restrictions on his 
firewall program last month, he set off a chain of events that has caused a 
big controversy among the open-source developers who work on the OpenBSD 
operating system. For the past five years, OpenBSD has included a firewall 
application called IPFilter 3.4 that tracks all information packets traveling in 
and out of network servers running the operating system. But last month, 
Darren Reed, the Australia-based author of IPFilter, clarified the licensing 
language for his program to ensure that anyone wanting to make changes 
to the software could only do so with his prior approval. On his e-mail 
listserve on the Internet, Reed wrote that IPFilter had always had a 
restrictive license and that was merely making that fact more clear.

SOHOWARE BROADGUARD SECURE CABLE/DSL ROUTER
So, you just ordered your high-speed broadband Internet service. But what are 
you going to connect it to? You need a device that will meet your functionality

INTERVIEW WITH WIETSE VENEMA
This article is an interview with Wietse Venema. He is a well-known and proven 
Unix programmer and author of various software tools and security articles. One 
of Venema's widely-used tools is tcp_wrappers, also called TCPD; it can be 
used for monitoring and filtering incoming network requests. This tcpd program 
is included with numerous Unix-type operating systems; commonly it is used 
with inetd (the "internet super-server"), but also various other programs include 
its functionality by using libwrap which is based on Wietse Venema's tcp_wrappers. 
Recently, there's been a lot of discussion and news about Darren Reed's IP Filter 
licensing. The IP Filter code license has the exact same "Redistribution and use in 
source and binary forms are permitted" statement as Venema's tcp_wrappers 
code. Regular BSD-type licenses say the same thing, but they also include: 
"with or without modification".

MOST CANADIAN SURFERS ANXIOUS ABOUT VIRUS ATTACKS
Almost half of all Canadian Web users have been victimized at some time by a 
virus and three out of four worry about future attacks, according to a study 
just released. The survey showed that Canadians have significant concerns 
about the potential of new computer viruses, with 46 percent claiming to have 
been hit by digital bugs that have cost them time and money. The research, 
by market research company Ipsos-Reid, found that over 78 percent of 
Canadian Internet users are worried about being bitten by a computer 
virus sometime in the future.

All vulnerabilities are located at:
http://net-security.org/text/bugs


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

FREESTYLE CHAT SERVER VULNERABILITY
Freestyle Chat server is http chat environment. It is vulnerable to a variation 
of the dot dot bug. Freestyle also suffers from a device name denial of service.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/991053539,69155,.shtml


INOCULATEIT FOR LINUX VULNERABILITY
There is a vulnerability in InoculateIT for Linux, and probably other Unix 
versions of InoculateIT, which allows local non-root users to delete any 
file on the system, and under some circumstances to overwrite any file 
on the system, next time the "update_signature" is run by root. If the 
recommendations in the documentation are followed, this will happen 
every day at 1am.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/991053631,15257,.shtml


REMOTE VULNERABILITIES IN OMNIHTTPD
If malicious user sends lot requests to some existing or non-existing PHP 
script on web-server it will consume 100% percent of processor speed. 
Why does this happend? Every time you send request for PHP script, 
OmniHTTPd server starts PHP.exe and then tries to run script rather 
then making it memory-resident.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/991053823,81804,.shtml


TURBOLINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT - PMAKE
In the Turbolinux platforms referenced above, the pmake binary is installed 
setuid root. A local user could run pmake with root privileges. This could lead 
to a possibility of an attacker exploiting vulnerabilities in other programs that 
pmake uses.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/991082510,86407,.shtml


TURBOLINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT - OPENSSL
There are four security fixes that have been applied to this update of openssl:
-The behavior of OpenSSL has been modified to avoid using environment 
variables when running as root.
-A checking scheme has been implemented to check the result of RSA-CRT. 
This reduces the possibility of deducing the private key from an incorrectly
calculated signature.
-A prevention measure against Bleichenbacher's DSA attack is also added.
-The premaster secret is zeroed after deriving the master secret in DH ciphersuites.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/991082563,46459,.shtml


CESARFTP V0.98B VULNERABILITIES
CesarFTP v0.98b has a triple dot directory traversal vulnerability and weak 
password encryption.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/991082700,19241,.shtml


GUILDFTPD BUFFER OVERFLOW
GuildFTPD contains two different problems:
1. Buffer overrun in the SITE command with the ability to execute arbitrary
code
2. A memory leak in the input parsing code
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/991082815,71868,.shtml


SPEARHEAD NETGAP VULNERABILITY
Using Unicode encoding techniques, a user (or a malicious web site) can 
bypass NetGap's filtering engine.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/991082947,48348,.shtml


VULNERABILITY IN SOLARIS MAILTOOL(1)
The mailtool program is installed setgid mail by default in Solaris, a buffer 
overrun exists in the OPENWINHOME environment variable. By specifying a 
long environment buffer containing machine executable code, it is possible 
to execute arbitrary command(s) as gid mail.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/991083056,43876,.shtml


UNSAFE SIGNAL HANDLING IN SENDMAIL
Sendmail signal handlers used for dealing with specific signals (SIGINT, 
SIGTERM, etc) are vulnerable to numerous race conditions, including handler 
re-entry, interrupting non-reentrant libc functions and entering them again 
from the handler. This set of vulnerabilities exist because of unsafe library 
function calls from signal handlers (malloc, free, syslog, operations on global 
buffers, etc).
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/991224075,23518,.shtml


SPOONFTP BUFFER OVERFLOW VULNERABILITIES
The SpoonFTP server doesn't correctly apply boundary checks on the 'CWD' 
and 'LIST' commands. Issueing one of these to the server followed by 
respectively 530 and 531 bytes of data or more will cause the server 
to die. Altough in the majority of the attempts internal errors will kill the 
SpoonFTP process before any data can be passed on to the stack, it is 
possible to use this to overwrite eip and execute arbitrary code on the 
target machine.

CALDERA LINUX - WEBMIN ROOT ACCOUNT LEAK
When starting system daemons from the webmin webfrontend, webmin does 
not clear its environment variables. Since these variables contain the 
authorization of the administrator, any daemon gets these variables. A simple 
attack would be to write a CGI scripts which just dumps all environment 
variables and wait for the administrator to restart apache using webmin.
