HONEYNET TEAM 
During just one month of monitoring, the Honeynet team's "honey pot," which 
poses as a real network to attract attackers, had been scanned by hundreds 
of unique IP addresses looking for two particular ports: UDP (User Datagram 
Protocol) port 137, used by the NetBIOS Naming Service, and TCP port 139, 
the tried-and-true NetBIOS Session Service. This should not surprise loyal 
Security Watch students, who know that these ports, which are the Achilles' 
heels of Windows 9x/ME computers, turn users into "easy @Home and DSL 
victims." Knowing the proliferation of Windows 9x systems on the Internet 
and admitting more than idle curiosity about attackers targeting Windows 
systems, the team decided to build a default Windows 98 system with the 
entire C: drive shared to the world - hoping the "black-hat" bad guys would 
come. And come they did.

THE STORY OF JEFF - PART I and II 
This story is the ongoing saga of Jeff, a tragic tale full of hardship, heartbreak 
and triumph over impossible odds. Jeff is your average network administrator, 
responsible for Acme Inc's Microsoft based corporate network. We start with 
the basics and steadily spiral into madness and insanity as Jeff's network is 
repeatedly broken into.

ANY PORT IS A HACKER STORM 
"One of the biggest information giveaways for hackers is for you to have 
machines with ports that aren't in use but respond anyway. Windows, 
unfortunately, makes it horribly easy to leave your machine open for 
information to be discovered."

SIGNED CODE: SECURITY OR CENSORSHIP? 
Depending on Microsoft's approach, code signing could not only secure the 
desktop, but the software giant's control over it as well.

SOLARIS BSM AUDITING 
When considering the security of a system we need to be concerned not only 
with which features and tools we use to implement the access restrictions, 
but also with what logging of access we do. Logging is important for two main 
reasons: regular analysis of our logs gives us an early warning of suspicious 
activity and, if stored securely it can provide the evidence required to find 
out what went wrong when a breach in the security policy occurs. In this 
article, Darren Moffat, of the Solaris Security Technoglies Group at Sun 
Microsystems, gives us an overview of the Basic Security Module 
implementation and management aspects, and provides us insight 
helpful in raising security to another level in "Solaris BSM Auditing."

FORGET PASSWORDS, WHAT ABOUT PICTURES? 
We're drowning in passwords, and our brains are rebelling. Most of us have one 
of two strategies for remembering all these new strings of letters and numbers: 
use the exact same password across the board, or keep written reminders of 
the various secret phrases. Either way, the entire purpose of passwords - 
security - is undermined.

FREEBSD WEB SITE GOT DEFACED 
It looks like FreeBSD web site (www.freebsd.org) got defaced. If you surf to 
the page, you won't see anything strange, but look down and you will see 
"FreeBSD got a new Security Officer. Nohican and {} would like to wish the 
new Security Officer (Kris) good luck on his new job. We are sure you will do 
a great job!". Frank Van Vliet aka {} is well known for his "white hat" hacks 
of Slashdot and Apache.org

MICROPROSE WEB SITE DEFACED 
Games developer Microprose, famous for such simulation titles as GrandPrix 3, 
has had its Web site defaced by group known as "Delinquent Hacking Organisation".

CREEPY CRAWLERS 
VBS/Jean-A is a Visual Basic Script worm that will send copies of itself to each 
of the first 50 entries in the Microsoft Outlook addressbook. It tarrgets German 
Internet users, as the whole message is written in German. Currently Sophos 
has received just one report of this worm in the wild.

PRIVACY, SECURITY TOP CONCERNS FOR ONLINE SHOPPERS 
Nearly half of regular Internet users cite privacy and security as their biggest 
concerns when shopping online, according to a recent survey. Because of 
those concerns, 31 percent of survey participants said they would not shop 
on the Web this holiday season, and 38 percent said they will limit the amount 
they spend online. The survey "proves many consumers will not make purchases 
on the Web because they are afraid that their personal privacy will be violated 
or their credit card and identity will be stolen," said Al Decker, Fiderus CEO, 
in a prepared statement.

CYBER-TERRORISM 
A focus is beginning to emerge about the topic of cyber-terrorism. For some 
time, everything bad, or perceived as bad, on the Internet fell into the black 
hole known as cyber-terrorism. Events as varied as hacking, political protests, 
actions by international terrorists, wartime attacks on computers, denial of 
service attacks, and trashing Websites came under cyber-terrorism. 
Fortunately, a more mature perspective continues to emerge.

SMART CARDS POISED TO CHANGE THE FACE OF PAYMENT 
The ability to manufacture forged smart chip processors will likely be beyond 
the means of all but the most organized criminal operations. Because of this, 
Visa International believes that a move to smart card technology could reduce 
payment card fraud by as much as 90 percent. That's because defrauding a 
smart card system isn't a matter of copying down numbers and expiration 
dates, or forging government notes. Those types of crimes involve fooling 
a person. But smart card purchases don't go through until the card itself 
says they're OK.

MTX VIRUS WON'T LET YOU GET HELP 
A computer virus that's smart enough to block its victims from getting help is 
steadily spreading around the Internet. The bug, called MTX, was discovered 
in August and initially labeled a low risk. But in recent weeks, infections have 
been growing and last week it was the most prevalent virus in the world, 
according to one antivirus firm. The bug has one very sinister feature: once 
it infects a user, it's programmed to stop the victim from visiting antivirus 
Web sites and sending "mayday" emails to antivirus companies.

ISC DHCPD 
It's interesting to see the number of articles written on ISC's DNS server BIND, 
compared with the total lack of coverage of one of their other products that is 
just as important - DHCP. DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Control Protocol and 
does exactly what it claims. There is practically no information available online 
regarding DHCP security. This is odd, considering the ubiquity of DHCP servers 
on most networks. Unlike BIND, the ISC DHCP server does not have command 
line options to chroot the server or run it as a non-root user. This means that 
most DHCP servers are running non-chrooted and as root, increasing the 
chances that any security flaws found will be quite serious.

SDMI AWARDS HACKERS IN CONTEST 
A music and technology forum that ran a $10,000 contest back in September 
challenging people to hack into copyright protection technologies said it was 
paying prize money to two hackers. The Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) 
said it was contacting two successful challengers, who will receive $5,000 
each, for participation in the HackSDMI public invitation. The two challengers 
emerged from a field of 447 submissions as the only ones able to remove the 
protection systems and successfully disable one of five technologies currently 
under consideration for SDMI screening technology, the group said.

YAHOO!: ENCRYPTION FOR THE MASSES 
Yahoo! is the first Web portal to introduce an email encryption service. The 
company is clear that the service is not end-to-end, but offers a "certain 
level of security" to the person receiving the email. While some people 
question the value of mass market encryption products, Topsoft, a UK 
encryption specialist, positively encourages it. "Encryption suffers from 
something of an image problem," says Topsoft's non-executive director, 
Tom Parker. "We need to get it into use in the general population. People 
are beginning to see the value of the security it offers, but are intimidated 
by the techie image it has."

ADVANCED BIOMETRICS GIVES SECURITY A HAND 
Advanced Biometrics is developing biometric track ball and mouse technology to 
be used in identification and authentication. The track ball or mouse, provisionally 
named Live Grip, maps the substructure of the human hand by measuring veins, 
deep creases, scars and fatty tissue density through infrared light. With alpha 
testing scheduled for the first quarter of next year and with e-commerce beta 
testers signed on, the company is targeting the technology for business-to- 
business Web sites, credit card issuers and financial institutions.

SECURITY REVIEW: VELOCIRAPTOR FIREWALL KICKS! 
Similar to the Nokia IP650 firewall appliance, VelociRaptor runs on an Intel 
compatible AMD-K6 platform. Its Remote Management Console (RMC) for 
Windows NT and Windows 2000 makes it ideal for organizations that need 
to manage firewall services remotely at customer sites or field offices. All 
communication between the RMC console and the VelociRaptor is encrypted 
for secure management over a public network. Included with all VelociRaptor 
units is a proxy-secured gateway-to-gateway Virtual Private Network (VPN) 
tunneling capabilities. The VPN capabilities are based on the standard IPSec 
protocol.

INTRODUCTION TO INCIDENT HANDLING 
Incident handling is a generalized term that refers to the response by a person 
or organization to an computer security incident or attack. An organized and 
careful reaction to an incident could mean the difference between complete 
recovery and total disaster. This paper by Chad Cook provides a logical, 
sequential approach to managing two of the most common forms of attack - 
viruses and system compromise. The method this article describes is a useful 
step-by-step approach for safe recovery and response without the need for 
highly technical knowledge.

PHP.PIRUS 
This virus is written in PHP and is contained in a file that is 718 bytes long. 
When executed, the virus searches the current directory for files with .php 
or .htm extensions. If one of these files is writable, the virus opens the file to 
determine if the file is already infected. If the file is not infected, the virus 
inserts a line to execute the original viral file rather than appending itself to 
the infected file.

SECURITY COMPANY'S WEB SITE ATTACKED 
Computer security firm Network Associates was left embarrassed after two of 
its corporate Web site were defaced Wednesday although it claims it is not its 
fault. A group calling itself Insanity Zine defaced the Brazilian homepages of 
two Network Associates sites: www.nai.com.br and www.mcafee.com.br. The 
defacement represents as a major embarrassment for a company that produces 
software designed to protect computer systems from security threats.

SECURITY-SERVICES MARKET 
Demand for information-security services will skyrocket in the next three years, 
according to market-research and advisory firm IDC. The U.S. market for security 
consulting, implementation, management and training services will leap to $8.2 
billion in 2004 from $2.8 billion this year, IDC says. The worldwide market will 
increase at a compound annual growth rate of 26 percent, to $17.2 billion in 
2004 from $5.5 billion in 1999.

FINGERPRINTS AND SMARTCARDS 
Fighting off hooligans and providing disco dollars to regulars, a new "cyber 
bouncer" is making waves in European nightclubs. It cuts through the fake IDs, 
credit cards and drivers licenses to allow club owners to easily assess who 
causes trouble and who doesn’t. The new system, developed by a U.S. 
company, has been implemented with a piece of technology the size of a 
credit card. These "smart cards" have a computer strip that stores a swathe 
of information. It can record biometric data including a person’s fingerprints.

JUDICIARY WEIGHS PRIVACY, ACCESS 
The federal judiciary is asking for the public's help in hashing out the privacy

WEBCASTERS, MEDIA GROUPS SPAR OVER COPYRIGHT PROPOSAL 
Digital media companies and leaders in the entertainment industry faced off in 
a hearing that could lead Congress to propose changes to online intellectual- 
property laws. The first, and most contentious proposal would have amended 
Section 109 of the act to make the "first sale" privilege - the provision that 
permits the resale of used books, for example - apply expressly to digital 
transmissions of copyrighted works.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

IIS 5.0 WITH PATCH Q277873 IS BAD FOR YOU 
Microsoft issued: "Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS00-086). Patch Available for 
"Web Server File Request Parsing" Vulnerability. Originally posted: November 
06, 2000. Updated: November 21, 2000" which installs patch Q277873. 
Unfortunately patch Q277873 opens another vulnerability which allows 
executing arbitrary programs on the web server. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/975377848,40922,.shtml 


SECURITY PROBLEMS WITH TWIG WEBMAIL SYSTEM 
Twig is designed to allow the use of virtual hosting, unfortunatly the script 
that checks this fails to check for user suplied input, thus allowing anyone 
to submit malicious values as the configuration directory. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/975377903,16734,.shtml 


IBM NET.DATA LOCAL PATH DISCLOSURE 
IBM's Net.Data package (often used in conjuction with NetCommerce3 and 
db2www) will disclose the local path of server files if fed improper requests. 
This software is in use on a variety of sites, including several online-shopping 
locales. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/975462531,47164,.shtml 


SUSE LINUX 6.X 7.0 IDENT BUFFER OVERFLOW 
This advisory details a buffer overflow vulnerability under SuSE Linux that can 
enable a malicious user to cause Identification Protocol (Ident) handling to 
crash. Due to the overflow, the system will no longer be able to establish 
certain connections which use Ident, for example IRC (Internet Relay Chat) 
connections. If the Ident daemon is not running, users wishing to connect to 
IRC will not be allowed to make a connection. In the this case the vulnerability 
could be used in a denial of service attack to keep a person of irc. It's not 
clear at this present time whether this vulnerability could be exploited in such 
a way that arbitrary code is executed. If so, this will happen with the privileges 
of the user "nobody" in a default installation. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/975462563,49538,.shtml 


24LINK WEBSERVER VULNERABILITY 
A vulnerability was found in 24Link 1.06 Web Server for Windows 95/98/2000/NT 
machines. The vulnerability allows you to view any password protected files on 
the Web Server, provided that the Authorization - Check User Name and 
Password- On all Requests option wasn't chosen, which asks for user 
name/password for every request sent to the server. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/975462579,88789,.shtml 


REMOTE FILE ATTACHMENT THEFT 
WebMail (possibly WhoWhere.com software) as installed on comm.lycos.com, 
angelfire.com, eudoramail.com and others allows an attacker to hijack other 
people's attachments by modifying the hidden form fields on the compose 
message form. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/975547058,21897,.shtml 


MANDRAKE LINUX - BASH1 UPDATE 
The bash1 shell program has the same << vulnerability that tcsh has and 
incorrectly creates temporary files without the O_EXCL flag. This vulnerability 
does not exist in bash2 which uses the O_EXCL flag when creating temporary files. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/975547095,61321,.shtml 


CISCO 675 DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACK 
The Cisco 675 DSL routers with the Web Administration Interface enabled can 
be crashed (hard) using a simple GET request. CBOS versions 2.0.x through 
2.2.x have been found to be vulnerable. The new CBOS 2.3.x has not been 
tested, but there are no notes in the 2.3.x changelogs to indicate that they've 
fixed this problem. Effected 675s were configured in PPP mode. The 'Web 
Administration Interface' is enabled by default in CBOS revisions 2.0.x and 2.2.x.

DOS IN SONICWALL SOHO FIREWALL 
I was just playing a bit with a Sonicwall SOHO firewall, to verify performances 
and security of the product. I've noticed that using a very long string (some 
hundreds of chars) as the User Name in the auth page of the Sonicwall web 
server, the firewall reacts strangely: it begins to refuse connections to the 
80/tcp port and it stops routing packets from the internal LAN. After about 
30 seconds it apparently returns normal. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/975547130,93049,.shtml 


SUSE SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT: NETSCAPE 
Michal Zalewski < lcamtuf@DIONE.IDS.PL> has found a buffer overflow in the 
html parser code of the Netscape Navigator in all versions before and including 
4.75. html code of the form 
< form action=foo method=bar> 
< input type=password value=long string here> 
more form tags 
< /form> 
can crash the browser. It may be possible for an attacker to supply a webpage 
that executes arbitrary code as the user running netscape. As of today, no 
exploit code is known to exist in the wild. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/975637488,44617,.shtml 


DEBIAN LINUX - FSH SYMLINK ATTACK 
Colin Phipps found an interesting symlink attack problem in fsh (a tool to quickly 
run remote commands over rsh/ssh/lsh). When fshd starts it creates a directory 
in /tmp to hold its sockets. It tries to do that securely by checking of it can 
chown that directory if it already exists to check if it is owner by the user 
invoking it. However an attacker can circumvent this check by inserting a 
symlink to a file that is owner by the user who runs fhsd and replacing that 
with a directory just before fshd creates the socket. 
Link: 


WINDOWS 2000 TELNET SERVICE DOS 
The Telnet Service in question is vulnerable to a simple Denial of Service attack. 
The problem apparently lies within the login routine of the daemon. The problem 
can be demonstrated by telneting to a machine running the specified version of 
the Telnet Service and waiting at the login/password prompt until a session 
timeout takes place. However, after it does time out the connection is not 
reset by the daemon until the user presses a key. In Windows 2000 Professional, 
due to the fact, it allows only one telnet connection per host, this will effectively 
disable access for the authorized user.

HYPE AND THE SECURITY SCENE: TAKING THE "REP" by Thejian 

Ever since there has been a "hackerscene" there has been a constant struggle 
between its "inhabitants" and mainstream media over words. That's all it is you 
know, "what's in a name" to put it really (really :) trite. Wether it was hacker, 
cracker or script kiddie, wether it was Kevin Mitnick or Mafiaboy (or neither) 
who represents the word "hacker", there was and will always be disagreements 
and misconceptions in and about this scene when it comes to words.

THE ATTRITION.ORG STAFF ON CYBERWAR AND THE MEDIA

mirror to support their hyped conclusions. Let's take a little reality break, 
folks - the sky isn't falling.

PROFESSIONAL WINDOWS DNA: BUILDING DISTRIBUTED WEB APPLICATIONS 
WITH VB, COM+, MSMQ, SOAP, AND ASP 

This book is for anyone involved with building distributed web applications that 
want to see the bigger picture. As such the book assumes a working knowledge 
of VB and ASP in places, but the emphasis is not so much on the code as on 
where each of the pieces fit into the puzzle. It's designed to give you an idea 
of how each area or technology affects you, enabling you to make informed 
decisions about whether to pursue a subject further, or confidently assert that 
you can do without it. This book takes an in-depth look at the DNA architecture, 
focusing on fitting the pieces of the puzzle together. Each of the logical tiers is 
examined, with particular emphasis placed on the features COM+ contains to 
make component building simpler and more powerful.
