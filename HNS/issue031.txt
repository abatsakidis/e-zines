NEW BLOW TO INTERNET BANKING SECURITY 
The future of internet banking was thrown into chaos last night 
after a British computer expert accessed bank account details of 
millions of Americans from his home in the Isle of Man during a 
routine check on his US bank account. Ralph Dressel, a 28-year-old 
software analyst at Royal Skandia lnvestment bank, contacted 
The Observer having obtained bank security details that allowed 
him to "walk" straight into internet bank accounts at institutions 
across the US.

PHONE.COM TAKES AIM AT WAP SECURITY HOLE 
In current WAP transmissions, data must use two security protocols - 
WTLS during the wireless part of the journey and SSL once the data 
hits the wires. There is a split second when the data must decrypt and 
re-encrypt to switch from one protocol to the other. A security flaw 
could occur if someone was able to crash the machine in the split 
second between decryption and re-encryption, causing a memory 
dump to the disk.

HERBLESS INTERVIEWED 
PhantasmP of HWA-Security yesterday interviewed one of the names 
that were in the news for the past few days - Herbless. He is 
connected to some defacements where he put his opinions on DeCSS 
and fuel situation and if you saw the item below, he announced he 
quits defacing.

HERBLESS QUITS 
Herbless, who defaced the websites of HSBC, Legoland and 450 others 
as part of the fuel protest in the last month, has announced his sudden 
exit from the scene. Speaking exclusively to vnunet.com, Herbless said: 
"For various reasons that may or may not become apparent, I have left 
the hacking scene for good. You won't hear of any more defacements 
by Herbless. Let's just say that it is the price of freedom, and is worth 
paying."

AOL'S LOOSE CANNON: JUSTIN FRANKEL 
The programmer's an employee of America Online, but the creator of 
Gnutella's has a funny way of saying thank you. Frankel has, in fact, 
devised some software, but not the kind AOL was expecting. The latest 
creation of the 21-year-old programmer enables users of AOL's wildly 
popular Instant Messenger to delete the ads from the online chat program. 
What's more, a Web site owned by Nullsoft, and ultimately AOL, has been 
giving away the software.

COMPANIES CAPITALISE ON WEB FRAUD FEARS 
US credit card companies portray themselves as watchdogs guarding 
customers against Internet fraud, but some of their security measures 
are just clever marketing tools to win new customers. Credit card theft 
occurs three to ten times more online than it does in stores, and such 
card companies as American Express are rushing to devise online security 
measures to protect people.

============================================================ 




Security issues 
--------------- 

All vulnerabilities are located at: 
http://net-security.org/text/bugs 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

MAJOR VULNERABILITY IN ALABANZA CONTROL PANEL 
This is serious enough since you can delete all resold domains for a particular 
webhosting company. You can also change the default MX and CNAME records 
of all associated domains. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/969896875,69779,.shtml 


E*TRADE LOGINS/PASSWORDS REMOTELY RECOVERABLE 
Due to flaws in E*TRADE's software, a remote third party can recover the 
usernames and plain-text passwords of any E*TRADE user. The vector of attack 
can be a malicious (but innocent looking) web site, an email, or a variety of more 
obscure methods. A local compromise of the user's machine is not required. The 
attacker only needs to seek out known or likely E*TRADE users and contact them. 
The result of the attack is that the attacker will have the user's username and 
password. This will allow the attacker arbitrary access to the account, including 
banking, securities trading, and other valuable access. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/969714869,69820,.shtml 


MULTIPLE VULNERABILITIES IN CISCOSECURE ACS 
Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified and fixed in CiscoSecure ACS for 
Windows NT Server: 
- The CSAdmin software module can be forced to crash by sending it an 
oversized URL. 
- CiscoSecure ACS for Windows NT Server can be placed into an unstable state 
by sending it an oversized TACACS+ packet. 
- The enable password can be bypassed to gain unauthorized privileges on a 
router or switch when CiscoSecure ACS for Windows NT Server is used in 
conjunction with an LDAP server that allows users to have null passwords. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/969635524,66062,.shtml 


DOS IN BROWSEGATE (HOME) V2.80 
Delphis Consulting Internet Security Team discovered that it's possible to cause 
Browsegate to crash with an invalid read error. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/969580439,75618,.shtml 


RED HAT LINUX - GLINT SYMLINK VULNERABILITY 
If a specific symlink exists in /tmp, glint will open it and write to it when run by 
root - so destruction of any file is possible. Note that glint does not work with 
RPM 3.0 or higher. If you have RPM 3.0 or higher installed, just uninstall the glint 
package to remove this vulnerability. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/969580219,81985,.shtml 


EXTENT RBS DIRECTORY TRANSVERSAL 
Extent RBS allows users to register a new subscription via Credit Card through 
their web browser. The problem is that the web server does not check for 
directory transversal when reading image files. Thus any file available on the 
same partition (in WinNT or any file on the *NIX system) which Extent RBS has 
permissions to read, can be read by a malicious user. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/969579949,36863,.shtml 


EXPLOIT USING EUDORA AND THE GUNINSKI HOLE 
Eudora saves all attachments in a single directory upon receiving the mail; a mail 
message need not be open for its attachment to be decoded and saved in that 
common directory. An intruder need only send an e-mail with a trojaned DLL as 
described in the Guninski advisory, along with or followed by an e-mail containing 
a Word document. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/969408551,99330,.shtml 


WINCOM LPD DOS 
A continuos stream of LPD options, sent to the LPD port (default TCP port 515) 
on the host running WinCOM, will eventually consume all the memory on that 
host. Systems Affected: WinCOM LPD V1.00.90 for Windows NT 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/969406272,66800,.shtml 


DIGITAL UNIX KDEBUGD REMOTE VULNERABILITY 
The kdebug daemon can be exploited by remote users to open and display the 
contents of any file on the system. It can also be used to write to the beginning 
of any file on the system overwriting data which was previously there. Affected: 
Digital UNIX 4.0F, other versions believed to be as well but untested.

ISSUES: HIRING HACKERS, THE FINE LINE BETWEEN CULT AND CRIMINAL by Thejian 

Obviously there are a lot of technically talented individuals running around in the 
hacking scene nowadays. There always have, it's the root of its existence. This 
has given birth to another interesting issue. Besides hacking being marketable 
and trendy, the underground today has the full attention of the corporate world 
where the skills are recognized (in some) and could be put to good use as well. 
In short, hiring hackers, if not good for profits at least is the trendy thing to do. 
And looking at the security problems some companies are having that definately 
is a good thing. However, it also raises the question of trust.

DETECTION OF AN UNKNOWN VIRUS by Kaspersky Lab 

In this chapter we discuss the situations which user faces when he suspects, 
that his computer is infected, but none of the anti-viruses known to him tested 
positive. How and where to look for virus? What tools are needed for that, what 
methods to use and what rules to follow?

VIRUS ALGORITHM ANALYSIS by Kaspersky Lab 

"To my mind the most suitable object for keeping and analyzing the virus is a file 
containing the virus body. In practice to analyze the file virus it is convenient to 
have several infected files of different, but not too large, size. Except that it is 
desirable to have infected files of all kinds (COM, EXE, SYS, BAT, NewEXE) that 
this virus can infect..."

RECOVERY OF AFFECTED OBJECTS by Kaspersky Lab 

In most cases of viral infection the procedure of recovery of infected files and 
disks means running a suitable anti-virus capable of disarming the system. 
However, in the virus is not known to any anti-virus, it is enough to send the 
infected file to anti-virus developer companies, and in some time (usually 
several days or weeks) receive the cure updates for this virus. But if time 
presses, you will have to disarm the virus yourself.

ANTI-VIRUS PROGRAMS by Andrew Krukov, AVP Team 

I would like to point out that there are no anti-viruses guaranteeing 100 percent 
protection from viruses. Any declarations about their existence may be considered 
to be either an advertising trick or a sign of incompetence. Such systems do not 
exist because for each anti-virus algorithm it is always possible to suggest virus 
counter algorithm, making this particular virus invisible for this particular anti-virus 
(fortunately the opposite is also true: for any anti-virus algorithm it is always 
possible to create an anti-virus).

JAVA SECURITY 

This book is extraordinary both for its technical depth and its readability. It 
provides the Java programmer with a complete overview of the Java security 
architecture and security classes, plus a wealth of detailed information and code 
examples for specific implementations. The following chapters look in depth at the 
elements of the Java security architecture: language rules, class loaders, the 
security manager, the access controller, and permission objects. All these 
chapters provide detailed information on implementation, as well as an excellent 
explanation of the role of each feature within the entire security picture. The 
second half of the book covers cryptographic features in the Java security 
package and how Java programs work with code that performs authentication 
and encryption. Here, you'll find detailed chapters on message digests, keys and 
certificates, key management, digital signatures, and the Java Cryptography 
Extensions. Anyone who needs to understand Java security, but especially those 
who will implement security features in Java applications, will want this book.

JAVA 2 NETWORK SECURITY 

Rather than focusing on how a Java system can be broken, the authors show 
managers, network administrators, developers, and security professionals how 
Java can be made secure and how to exploit its strengths. Topics include the 
pros and cons of each Java security alternative; architectural techniques for 
maximizing security; securing Web and intranet applications; deploying or limiting 
Java across firewalls; integrating Java and SSL; and using Java's Cryptography 
APIs. The disk contains source code and links to Java security Web sites.

LINUX SYSTEM SECURITY: THE ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE TO OPEN SOURCE 
SECURITY TOOLS 

The introduction of Linux System Security acknowledges that there's no magic 
bullet as far as security is concerned. Security-minded system administration is 
a process of constant revision. It promises, though, that "if you follow the 
procedures outlined, you will certainly reduce your level of vulnerability." The 
book delivers on that promise in spades. Using Red Hat Linux as the 
demonstration environment, the authors explain how to use a suite of publicly 
available tools to analyze, protect, and monitor your machines and networks. 
They approach the subject from a practical standpoint, emphasizing software 
and its use while referring the reader (using copious bibliographic notes) to 
more specialized works for detailed information on cryptography, firewall 
configuration, and other subjects.
