PICKING THE LOCKS ON THE INTERNET SECURITY MARKET 
"Another day, another e-commerce break-in ... The problem, argue a number 
of new startups, isn't products. It's people."

WE'RE STILL GETTING SECURITY WRONG 
Worries about security, and justified ones at that, could still stop the eCommerce 
bandwagon in its tracks, it seems. The recent revelation of a security loophole in 
MS Outlook has been followed by a report from IDC asserting that corporate 
Europe is still adopting the wrong approach to strengthening the security of 
its systems.

EVALUATION TECHNOLOGY FOR INTERNATIONAL SECURITY STANDARD 
The international standard serves as a framework for establishing system 
reliability by a product's functions, quality, operation and management. More 
specifically, the standard prescribes requirements for the functioning and quality 
of the security component that systems must meet to prevent intrusion and 
unauthorized access.

COST OF INTRUSIONS 
Enterprises hiring reformed crackers to expose their soft underbellies will only 
add to the more than $2.6 trillion lost worldwide annually because of security 
intrusions, warns professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.

MICROSOFT SECURITY EXECUTIVE PROMISES IMPROVEMENTS 
The man who receives more complaints about the security of Microsoft Corp.'s 
software than anyone on the planet vowed here yesterday that the company's 
products are improving in quality and will continue to become more secure.

WHY PEOPLE NEED OUTLOOK 
With all this problems with Microsoft Outlook, people are wondering why do 
others use Outlook rather than some other mail clients. On HNS forum, Ladi wrote 
her opinion on "Why is Outlook so widely used in corporate environments?".

DEFACEMENTS BY WEBSERVER 
Attrition published statistics entitled "Defacements by Webserver August 01, 
1999 - July 22, 2000". According to the stats, Microsoft IIS had the biggest 
number of defacements.

ERROR AND ATTACK TOLERANCE OF COMPLEX NETWORKS 
The Internet's reliance on only a few key nodes makes it especially vulnerable 
to organized computer attacks, according to a new study on the structure of 
the worldwide network.

SECURITY POLICY 
Marcus Ranum, chief technology officer at NFR: "We are creating hordes and 
hordes of script kiddies. They are like cockroaches. There are so many script 
kiddies attacking our networks that it's hard to find the real serious attackers 
because of all the chaotic noise."

NSA OFFICIAL BLASTS AT SECURITY VENDORS 
The National Security Agency's senior technical director Thursday lambasted 
developers of security tools, which he said were so weak that they encouraged 
attacks by computer crackers.

BRITISH VERSION OF CARNIVORE IS NOW LAW 
The British government approved the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP) 
that allows British law-enforcement agencies to force ISPs to hand over 'Net 
traffic logs and encrypted e-mail messages, along with the decryption keys 
needed to read their content. ISPs will have to set up secure channels to the 
government's monitoring center and to install "black boxes" that will do the 
tracking if the government issues a notice and has a warrant asking the ISP 
to do so.

HOW THE FBI INVESTIGATES COMPUTER CRIME 
This guide provides information about the federal investigative and prosecutive 
process for computer related crimes. It will help you understand some of the 
guidelines, policies, and resources used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
when it investigates computer crime.

TOOL TRACES DENIAL OF SERVICE SOURCES 
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is working on technology that will 
minimise the problem of denial of service attacks by making it possible to quickly 
trace the source of the attack. The organisation last week formed a working 
group to develop ICMP Traceback Messages, which would allow network 
administrators to trace the path packets take through the internet.

RECRUITING HACKERS 
Department of Defense and military officials turned a hacker conference into a 
recruiting drive Friday, trying to woo the best and the brightest into becoming 
security experts. 
Link: http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2609334,00.html 


DEFCON 
Defcon has always been an event known as much for its intensive technical 
content - talks on "advanced buffer overflow techniques" are de rigueur - as 
its social opportunities, but this year it seems to have become more party than 
conference. Call it the new American geek holiday.

Security issues 
--------------- 

All vulnerabilities are located at: 
http://net-security.org/text/bugs 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

VULNERABILITY IN NETSCAPE BROWSERS 
This advisory explains a vulnerability in Netscape browsers present since at 
least version 3.0 and up to Netscape 4.73 and Mozilla M15. The vulnerability 
is fixed in Netscape 4.74 and Mozilla M16. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/964528232,40698,.shtml 


IBM WEBSPHERE VULNERABILITY 
A show code vulnerability exists with IBM's Websphere allowing an attacker 
to view the source code of any file within the web document root of the 
web server. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/964528397,78068,.shtml 


ANALOGX PROXY DOS 
AnalogX Proxy is a simple but effective proxy server that has the ability 
to proxy requests for the following services: HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, 
SOCKS4a, SOCKS5, NNTP, POP3, SMTP, FTP. Using commands of an 
appropriate length, many of the services exhibit unchecked buffers causing 
the proxy server to crash with an invalid page fault thus creating a denial 
of service. Normally this would only be a concern for users on the LAN side 
of the proxy, but by default Proxy is configured to bind to all interfaces on 
the host and so this would be exploitable remotely from over the Internet. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/964577654,52746,.shtml 


PATCH FOR "NETBIOS NAME SERVER PROTOCOL SPOOFING" 
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in 
a protocol implemented in Microsoft Windows systems. It could be used 
to cause a machine to refuse to respond to requests for service. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/964789771,23452,.shtml 


BEA'S WEBLOGIC SHOW CODE VULNERABILITY 
Two show code vulnerabilities exist with BEA's WebLogic 5.1.0 allowing 
an attacker to view the source code of any file within the web document 
root of the web server. Depending on web application and directory 
structure attacker can access and view unauthorized files.

"I'm going to make a couple of assumptions here, first, you know how to install 
Linux and are familiar with its use. Second I assume you are setting up a 
gateway computer permanently attached to the internet be it by cable modem, 
DSL or whatever and will not be used for anything else like a ftp, telnet or

indispensable information, this book systematically identifies the threats that 
your network faces and explains how to eliminate or minimize them. Covers all 
major network operating systems - NT, NetWare, and Unix - and all aspects of 
network security, from physical security of premises and equipment to 
anti-hacker countermeasures to setting up your own Virtual Private Networks. 
The CD includes evaluation and demonstration versions of commercial firewalls, 
intrusion detection software, and a complete security policy.

CRYPTOGRAPHY AND NETWORK SECURITY : PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE 

This book presents detailed coverage of network security technology, the 
standards that are being developed for security in an internetworking 
environment, and the practical issues involved in developing security applications. 
KEY TOPICS: Opening with a tutorial and survey on network security technology, 
this book provides a sound mathematical foundation for developing the algorithms 
and results that are the cornerstone of network security. Each basic building block 
of network security is covered, including conventional and public-key cryptography, 
authentication, and digital signatures, as are methods for countering hackers and 
other intruders and viruses. The balance of the book is devoted to an insightful 
and thorough discussion of all the latest important network security applications, 
including PGP, PEM, Kerberos, and SNMPv2 security.

MAXIMUM LINUX SECURITY : A HACKER'S GUIDE TO PROTECTING YOUR LINUX 
SERVER AND WORKSTATION 

In this book, readers become familiar with scores of offensive and defensive 
weapons, including Crack, Tripwire, linux_sniffer, mendax, and many more. For 
each program, the author documents the required infrastructure (such as C or 
Perl), the required permissions, and a URL from which the program can be 
downloaded. Most valuably, he walks you through the use of each program. 
Readers can follow along as the author performs various hacks, including an IP 
spoofing attack. He lists hundreds of hacking tools in an appendix, and includes 
a lot of software (Linux security products, code examples, technical documents, 
system logs, and utilities) on the companion CD-ROM.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

MAXIMUM SECURITY : A HACKER'S GUIDE TO PROTECTING YOUR INTERNET 
SITE AND NETWORK 

This book is written for system administrators who need to know how to keep 
their systems secure from unauthorized use. The anonymous author takes a 
hacker's view of various systems, focusing on how the system can be cracked 
and how you can secure the vulnerable areas. The book makes it clear from the 
outset that you cannot rely on commercial software for security. Some of it is 
flawed, and even the best of it has to be used correctly to provide even the 
most basic security measures. The author scrutinizes such operating systems 
as Microsoft Windows, Unix, Novell, and Macintosh. He details many of the tools 
crackers use to attack the system, including several that have legitimate uses for 
system administration. Rather than merely cataloging areas of risk and showing 
how various flaws can be exploited, the author makes every effort to show how 
security holes can be avoided and remedied. An enclosed CD-ROM provides links 
to many of the tools and resources discussed in the book.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

BIG BOOK OF IPSEC RFCS: INTERNET SECURITY ARCHITECTURE 

The Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol, IPsec, is already defining 
the way organizations and individuals secure their networks. There is no single 
document that describes IPsec, but rather an entire body of work, the Requests 
for Comments (RFC's). This book compiles and organizes these important 
documents in a single printed volume, and adds a glossary and extensive index. 
This means you no longer have to wade through countless RFC's trying to find 
the answer to your IPsec question - all solutions are compiled in a single book, 
with an index that makes them even easier to locate. Every RFC describing an 
aspect of the IPsec standard is included here, as are descriptions of most of 
the cryptographic algorithms used in IPsec.Written by members of the IPsec 
Working Group and other Internet Engineering Task Force members, this is the 
most authoritative IPsec text available.

ASP/MTS/ADSI WEB SECURITY 

A book/CD-ROM guide for software developers and system architects who are 
building business-critical Web solutions where security is paramount. Explains 
the set of Web technologies from Microsoft, with sections on security 
fundamentals and core technologies, and Web security programming. 
Technologies discussed include Active Server Pages, Microsoft Transaction 
Server, and Active Directory Service Interface. The accompanying CD-ROM 
contains source code for examples and instructions for downloading trial 
versions of software packages.

DATABASE NATION : THE DEATH OF PRIVACY IN THE 21ST CENTURY 

Forget the common cold for a moment. Instead, consider the rise of "false data 
syndrome," a deceptive method of identification derived from numbers rather 
than more recognizable human traits. Simson Garfinkel couples this idea with 
oncepts like "data shadow" and "datasphere" in Database Nation, offering a 
decidedly unappealing scenario of how we have overlooked privacy with the 
advent of advanced technology. Garfinkel's thoroughly researched and 
example-rich text explores the history of identification procedures; the 
computerization of ID systems; how and where data is collected, tracked, and 
stored; and the laws that protect privacy.
