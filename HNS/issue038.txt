FOILING DNS ATTACKS 
Most of us take DNS servers for granted. Here, in a continuing series on 
attacking and defending your own machines, I discuss how people attack 
DNS servers and what you can do to better your security. I answer these 
questions: How do crackers exploit your DNS servers? How can you harden 
your DNS servers via configuration? How can you really make it a pain to 
hack your DNS servers?

WHERE THE LOG FILES LIVE 
You know there are logs on your FreeBSD system somewhere; you've probably 
also heard that it is a good thing to read these logs on a regular basis. You 
may have even heard horror stories about logs filling up a user's hard drive. 
So how do we go about finding these mysterious logs?

CYBERTERROR SHOULD BE INTERNATIONAL CRIME 
As pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian attackers continue to attack Middle Eastern 
Web sites, Israel's former science minister has called for an international 
convention that would make sabotage over the Internet an international crime, 
"just like any other terrorism."

ENCRYPTION SYSTEM FOR GOVT BOSSES 
Top bureaucrats will be able to swap classified material on the Net with the 
launch this week of a "Secure Electronic Environment" linking Treasury, the 
State Services Commission and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. 
The system should reduce the need to courier sensitive information between 
departments and make it easier for policy-makers to share information and 
work jointly on projects from their desktop computers. But the system will not 
offer quite the level of security originally envisaged, as "compromises" have 
been made to ensure it is usable. Instead of secure individual-to-individual 
e-mail, it will only offer security between departments. The Secure Electronic 
Environment (SEE) lets about 500 policy-makers and managers exchange 
encoded e-mail, electronically "signed" by digital certificates.

SECURITY MEASURES MAY BE VIRUS CARRIERS 
Leading European security experts have warned that viruses may be spread 
through the use of public keys. Digital signatures, as a part of the public key 
infrastructure, can create a false sense of security between the sender and 
receiver as the signature makes the message appear secure. However, 
specialists have warned that encrypted viruses will be on the increase as 
soon as encrypted communication becomes more commonplace.

MYCIO.COM PLANS 
"Security has gotten much more serious as we've moved from trying to figure 
out how we secure our data to trying to figure out how we selectively expose 
that data to partners and customers. And companies are looking at every way 
possible to make the data secure." - said myCIO.com's CEO Zach Nelson.

BSA HITS SOFTWARE PIRATES 
It looks like the Business Software Alliance filed lawsuits in the United States 
and United Kingdom and has brought enforcement actions in Germany, charging 
dozens of individuals with selling pirated and counterfeit software over auction 
sites like eBay and QXL.

MOBILE HANDSET SECURITY 
CellF-Shield technology, which the Israeli company White Cell plans to licence 
to the wireless communications hardware industry, can protect a handset as 
effectively as an anti- virus program protects a PC, its creators say.

ISRAELIS HACKERS VOW TO DEFEND 
A group of self-described ethical hackers are taking the reins of the Israelis' 
Web networks into their own hands in the Middle East's cyberwar. Known as 
the Israeli Internet Underground, the coalition of anonymous online activists 
from various Israeli technology companies has set up a website to disseminate 
information concerning the ongoing battle in cyberspace.

LOW-LEVEL E-SECURITY DESPITE HIGH PROFILE ATTACKS 
Despite high profile attacks, companies are still not taking e-security seriously, 
according to research group Datamonitor. E-security breaches cause over 
$15bn damage worldwide each year, yet the total spend on security and 
services is only just over half that at $8.7bn.

SECURE XML STANDARD DEFINED FOR E-COMMERCE 
Netegrity announced plans on Wednesday to develop an XML-based standard 
to secure e-commerce transactions. Called Security Services Markup Language 
(S2ML), the standard seeks to build a common vocabulary for sharing user 
information and transactions -- and encourage single-sign-on -- across multiple 
platform business-to-business portal and business-to-consumer environments, 
Bill Bartow, vice-president of marketing at Netegrity, said.

WASTING AN ATTACKER'S TIME 
Attackers regularly waste the time and resources of system and network 
administrators. Constant port scans result in reams of firewall logs, masking 
real attacks and requiring significant resources to process. The majority of 
attackers have plenty of time to devote to probing and attacking networks, 
while the majority of network admins are quite busy and stretched for time. 
One attacker can easily probe thousands of machines overnight in an 
automated fashion, then cull that data to collect more detailed information, 
and finally check things out manually later on. So why not implement 
mechanisms to slow attackers down, and ultimately force them to waste 
time going after imaginary targets?

FIGHTING THE RISING TIDE 
Today, the Internet is more like the everyday world, with all of its promises 
and problems, than a reflection of academia or an island village. While it's 
become a tremendous tool for commerce and information, the 'Net has also 
become a home to thieves, terrorists and vandals. Unlike the real world, 
where you can usually tell when you're entering a bad neighborhood or 
confronted by a thug, the Net provides concealment for malicious users.

CAN LINUX BE PIRATED? 
Linux luminaries including Linus Torvalds and Jon 'maddog' Hall attempted to 
answer this question during a low-key panel session in the darkest depths of 
Comdex this week. In a debate about the internationalisation of Linux, the 
panel was asked whether Linux would suffer the same problems with software 
piracy that Microsoft and others have in areas such as Asia and Eastern Europe. 
The 200 or so delegates heard several opinions, but none that nailed down the 
awkward question.

PYTHON: SECURITY ASPECTS 
The great flexibility of Python rests in its ability to accept HTTP requests and 
to be embedded in HTML pages. It is a powerful scripting language, like a Unix 
shell script with overdrive capabilities. Being able to handle more complex data 
structures such as associative arrays, the language fills a wide range of roles, 
including searching databases or acting as a CGI script...

"BE SECURE OR BE SUED" BUSINESSES WARNED 
Businesses around the world are sitting on a legal powder keg by failing to 
adequately protect their servers from intrusions. Nick Lockett, ecommerce 
lawyer at Sidley & Austin, said that sites which were used by attackers to 
launch DoS attacks could be liable for large compensation claims. Lockett 
said: "There is a distinct probability that if your site has been hijacked for 
a denial of service attack, then you could be liable for damages. I would 
definitely advise clients they have grounds to sue."

BIOMETRICS LET YOU FORGET YOUR PASSWORD 
At Comdex earlier this week, a host of companies making everything from 
fingerprint scanners to voice and face recognition systems showed off their 
products - many of which are in the $100-per-user range. "It's out there. It's 
not a concept anymore," said Identix president Jim Scullion, as workers at his 
booth held up black signs reading "Kill the passwords" and "Practice safe 
computing" on the Comdex floor.

CREATE FIREWALL-FRIENDLY DISTRIBUTED APPS 
The Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) promises nothing less than to 
change how you architect, implement, and deploy VB applications today. At 
the same time, SOAP, as it stands now, has some significant limitations, not 
the least of which is performance. Understanding what SOAP is and what it 
can do for you, as well as what it can't, is the key to using it effectively.

EDS DEVISES PACKAGE TO PRE-EMPT ATTACKERS 
Services giant EDS last week said it knew about recent denial-of-service 
attacks two months before they happened, and had even identified the tools 
the crackers were planning to use. Speaking in Las Vegas before the launch 
of new EDS Internet security services, vice-president for global information 
assurance Shakil Kidwai said the company was now offering its anti-attacker 
intelligence as part of a package of security measures.

ID FRAUD BOOK GOES TOO FAR - MITNICK 
Kevin Mitnick, said that a new book that documents how people can uncover 
ID fraud, as well as conceal their own identities, has gone too far. In his review 
of "Who Are You? The Encyclopedia of Personal Identification," Mitnick said that 
the book is "dangerous to the general public and should never have been published."

XINETD 
xinetd - extended Internet services daemon - provides a good security against 
intrusion and reduces the risks of Deny of Services (DoS) attacks. Like the well 
known couple (inetd+tcpd), it allows to fix the access rights for a given machine, 
but it can do much more. In this article we will discover its many features.

Security issues 
--------------- 

All vulnerabilities are located at: 
http://net-security.org/text/bugs 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

GAIM REMOTE VULNERABILITY 
There is a buffer overflow in Gaim's parsing of HTML tags when using the OSCAR 
protocol which allows shell code to be executed when recieving a message with 
a large HTML tag (i.e. < AAAA...AAA>). The size of the static buffer which is 
overflowed is about 4100. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/974250880,29780,.shtml 


DOS VULNERABILITY IN SUN ANSWERBOOK2 
Sun's Answerbook fails under certain conditions to delete temporary files that 
are built by its print function, filling /tmp, and causing the system to fail because 
processes cannot fork. Briefly, the dwhttp print function builds Postscript files in 
/tmp and downloads them to the user's browser. It deletes Postscript files after 
they are successfully sent to the browser. It fails to delete postcript files if the 
requesting TCP connection is broken before files are completely built and sent to 
the browser. Undeleted files can be large, and they are more likely to be large 
than small. First, some printed documents are in excess of 50mb. Second, users 
often abort print requests for large documents because the requests require a 
long time to fulfill and users believe that their requests have failed. Users often 
try again. Relatively few large requests are necessary to fill a reasonably sized 
/tmp directory. When /tmp fills Solaris fails because /tmp is used for swap. 
If/when /tmp fills, swap space eventually also fills preventing additional 
procesees from being swapped. Eventually system memory will fill causing 
a failure of process spawning alltogether. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/974250893,61218,.shtml 


MORE PROBLEMS FOR PHP-NUKE 
Recentely the "fixed" version of the user.php script was released. The 
vulnerability was reported in the article which can be read in 
http://www.phpnuke.org/article.php?sid=251. 
This new version though still allows any registered user to alter the password 
and other personal details of other registered users. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/974250908,80619,.shtml 


VULNERABILITY IN DCFORUM CGI SCRIPT 
Any file can be read with the permissions of user nobody (or webserver) Posible 
root comprimise in /dcforum/dcboard.cgi script.Command execution is not allowed. 
(Read Only) This has only been tested on unix and linux versions and is unknown 
if windows versions are effected. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/974338238,4697,.shtml 


TRUSTIX - BIND AND OPENSSH UPDATES 
Trustix has created updated packages for Trustix Secure Linux 1.0x and 1.1 that 
fixes one security problem and one DOS attack: openssh, openssh-clients, 
openssh-server: The openssh client does not enforce the "ForwardX11 no", and 
"ForwardAgent no" configuration options, so that a malicious server could force 
a client to forward these even if they are turned off. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/974338263,38259,.shtml 


NETOPIA ISDN ROUTER 650-ST ISSUE 
The logs of the router can be viewed from the telnet login screen by pressing a 
certain key combination. To access the WAN event log type Ctrl-F at the login 
screen. To access the device event log type Ctrl-E at the login screen Access 
to these logs may allow access to sensitive information such as usernames or 
passwords to an arbitary internet user. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/974465255,239,.shtml 


NETSNAP WEBCAM SOFTWARE REMOTE OVERFLOW 
There's a problem in the handling of GET requests by named server. An 
unchecked buffer here can be overflowed by a string of approximately 
342 bytes, effectively crashing the server and allowing the execution 
of arbitrary code. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/974465278,55718,.shtml 


JOE'S OWN EDITOR FILE LINK VULNERABILITY 
If a joe session with an unsaved file terminates abnormally, joe creates a rescue 
copy of the file being edited called DEADJOE. The creation of this rescue copy 
is made without checking if the file is a link. If it is a link, joe will append the 
information in the unsaved file to the file that is being linked to DEADJOE, 
resulting in a corrupted file. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/974465302,15109,.shtml 


RED HAT - FIXIED LOCAL ROOT EXPLOIT BUG 
modutils, a package that helps the kernel automatically load kernel modules 
(device drivers etc.) when they're needed, could be abused to execute code 
as root. modutils versions between 2.3.0 and 2.3.20 are affected. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/974465337,62610,.shtml 


STILL A CGI-SECURITY HOLE IN DNSTOOLS 
"following the notice about Version 1.08 of Dnstools I looked into the new 
version (1.10) that is currently downloadable on dnstools.com. It still contains 
a sedurity bug by not parsing input-values." 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/974465354,28429,.shtml 


"EXCHANGE USER ACCOUNT" VULNERABILITY 
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in 
Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server and Exchange 2000 Enterprise Server. This 
vulnerability could potentially allow an unauthorized user to remotely login 
to an Exchange 2000 server and possibly other servers on the affected 
computer's network. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/974465386,87359,.shtml 


REALSERVER MEMORY CONTENTS DISCLOSURE 
A memory contents disclosure vulnerability was found on RealNetworks 
RealServer which will give out information about the server configuration, 
runtime memory data and tokens and authentication credentials. This 
information allows an external attacker to possibly obtain administrative 
access to the server or to data belonging to other user sessions. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/974465400,56046,.shtml 


ANALOGX PROXY SERVER VULNERABILITY 
The Problem lies when FTP Service is ON and Logging is enabled or disabled, or 
SMTP Service is ON and Logging is enabled or disabled, POP3 Service is ON and 
logging is enabled. When the Attacker Sends a Multiple Abnormal Strings to a 
certain affected service it causes the whole Proxy to Shutd0wn. the proxy 
needs to re-start again to perform normal operation.

OPERATOR SECURITY SYSTEM FOR LABVIEW - [15.11.2000] 

Engineers and scientists who develop mission-critical LabVIEW applications can 
now take advantage of the Operator Security System (OSS) released by 
e-NoteBooks. The LabVIEW OSS is a fully integrated user password/security 
management system. Its main features include programmable operator security 
levels; an encrypted user/passwords database; a security time-out function 
that reverts the system back to a "safe" (low security clearance) state after 
a preprogrammed time interval; a configuration set-up wizard to step end-users 
through security system configuration; complete online configuration and 
updating; automatic operator log file generation; networking capabilities for 
distributed HMI configurations, and more.

PARANOIA VS. TRANSPARENCY AND THEIR EFFECTS ON INTERNET SECURITY by Mixter 

Lately, reactions to non-intrusive probes and network activity that is merely 
unexpected are becoming increasingly hostile; a result from increasing amounts 
of incidents and security threats. From my perspective of security, overreactions 
to activities not crossing authorization and legal boundaries, are leading to a 
scenario where anyone acquiring basic information about a system needs to be 
afraid about potential consequences. Seen under a wide scope, this leads to 
network security no longer being transparent.

ONLINE BANK SECURITY: COVER YOUR ASSETS! by Randy M. Nash 

Why are there so many concerns about online banking? Where is the breakdown 
in security? Even brick and mortar banks have internal networks that must be 
secured. It's my understanding that these are very well secured indeed. What 
happens when these security-conscious organizations move their presence to 
the Internet?

DEBUGGING WINDOWS PROGRAMS: STRATEGIES, TOOLS, 
AND TECHNIQUES FOR VISUAL C++ PROGRAMMERS 

The focus is on providing practical tips for more successful debugging, but many 
of the suggestions are for tweaking the way in which you write C++ code. Early 
sections examine how to take full advantage of assert statements (whether in 
C, MFC, or custom functions), which can be used to write safer code; trace 
statements, which are used to log debug messages, are covered, too. (Chances 
are that you haven't seen all of the APIs; luckily, they're rounded up for you 
here.) There are also numerous tips about C++ style, like how to choose 
readable variable names, along with the debugging dos and don'ts of working 
with errors, exceptions, COM objects, and threads.

CORE C++: A SOFTWARE ENGINEERING APPROACH 

Aimed at the Visual C++ newcomer, Core C++: A Software Engineering 
Approach provides a rich and sometimes densely packed tour of the language, 
with plenty of advice on the best ways to use this powerful programming 
language effectively. It's full to the brim with useful advice for creating and 
using classes effectively, and gaining an expert's understanding of the language. 
The writing style and presentation of C++ in this book are outstanding. The 
explanations of key C++ concepts, from basic language features to class design 
to advanced C++ whistles and bells, are by turns colloquial, garrulous, and 
almost always enjoyable and understandable. While it's not uncommon for 
today's computer book to weigh in at over 1,000 pages, the raw word count 
here is quite exceptional. You're challenged repeatedly to think for yourself, 
and the intricacies of C++ are exposed thoroughly, from language features 
that are indispensable to what to avoid in your code.

SAINT JUDE LKM 

Saint Jude LKM is a Linux Kernel Module for 2.2.11 and greater kernels. This 
module implements the Saint Jude model for improper privilege transitions. This 
will permit the discovery of local, and ultimately, remote root exploits during the 
exploit itself. Once discovered, Saint Jude will terminate the execution, 
preventing the root exploit from occuring. This is done without checking for 
attack signatures of known exploits, and thus should work for both known 
and unknown exploits.

SUPER SECURE 2000 V.1.0 

Super Secure 2000 is a easy program that can lock anything from the control 
panel to applications. Super secure is a windows based program that's easy, 
and fast to use. Ideal for home / office / schools. Protect your settings with a 
CSuper Secure is not like most security programs, most security programs run 
a program in the back ground that protects the computer, however, if the file 
is not loaded it will not protect. Super secure doesn't load a program in the 
background, it makes the changes to windows that you specify, then by loading 
a simple EXE, it unlocks it. Super Secure 2000 is fast, reliable, and easy.

TCPSPY V.1.1 

tcpspy is a linux administrator's tool that logs information about incoming and 
outgoing TCP/IP connections: local address, remote address and, probably the 
most useful feature, the user name. The current version allows you to include 
and exclude certain users from logging - this may be useful if you suspect one 
of the users on your system is up to no good but do not want to violate the 
privacy of the other users.
