BARCLAYS SLAMMED OVER INTERNET SECURITY FLAW 
Barclays came under fire from customers and consumer groups today after a 
security breach exposed confidential account details. The bank was forced to 
shut down its online banking service yesterday evening after a Saturday night 
upgrade to the online transaction software left user data accessible to other 
account holders.

NORTON PATCHES FIREWALL HOLES 
Symantec has quietly modified its Norton Personal Firewall and Norton Internet 
Security 2000 products to block advertising programs that are sometimes dubbed 
"spyware." The programs, called adbots, fetch banner ads over the Internet, but 
they also transmit encrypted data about the user back to the advertising 
companies. This function has earned them the "spyware" label among privacy 
and security advocates.

STOP CARNIVORE WEB SITE LAUNCHED 
A new site devoted to shutting down the FBI's Carnivore email surveillance system 
has launched - "Stop Carnivore". The site explains what Carnivore is, why it is 
wrong, what you can do, and how it hurts the Internet.

BROWN ORIFICE SECURITY HOLE 
From Dan Brumleve homepage - "I've discovered a pair of new capbilities in 
Java, one residing in the Java core and the other in Netscape's Java distribution. 
The first (exploited in BOServerSocket and BOSocket) allows Java to open a 
server which can be accessed by arbitrary clients. The second (BOURLConnection 
and BOURLInputStream) allows Java to access arbitrary URLs, including local files. 
As a demonstration, I've written Brown Orifice HTTPD for Netscape Communicator. 
BOHTTPD is a browser-resident web server and file-sharing tool that demonstrates 
these two problems in Netscape Communicator. BOHTTPD will serve files from a 
directory of your choice, and will also act as an HTTP/FTP proxy server."

EXCITE@HOME IP FLAW EXPOSED 
Excite@Home has warned it will take action against anybody who attempts utilise 
an IP vulnerability that allows a single user to block up to 127 IP addresses, 
effectively shutting people out of the service.

E-COMMERCE SECURITY : WEAK LINKS, BEST DEFENSES 

Online security investigator and research scientist Anup Ghosh takes a realistic 
look at the state of security for electronic commerce. He feels that some levels 
of security are excessive. But he emphasizes that any security system is only 
as strong as its weakest point. If you're going to trust your money to online 
transactions, you need to know where your weaknesses lie and how to correct 
them. To that end, Ghosh discusses real-life security failures, how they occurred, 
and how recurrences can be prevented. He then takes a systematic look at the 
areas of risk. One chapter deals with potential problems in active Web content, 
such as Java applets, ActiveX controls, and push technology. He examines data 
protocols to secure transactions with the warning that the data can be 
vulnerable before and after the secure transmission. The weaknesses of server 
hardware and software come under scrutiny as well. Ghosh calls for greater 
attention to security as software is being developed and looks at what 
advances are likely to be coming down the road.

HACK PROOFING YOUR NETWORK: INTERNET TRADECRAFT 

Systems and software packages are being connected to the internet at an 
astounding rate. Many of these systems and packages were not designed with 
security in mind. IT professionals need to keep their systems secure: this book 
shows them how to make a meaningful security assessment of their own 
systems, by thinking like a hacker. Using forensics-based analysis this book 
gives the reader insight to the mind of a hacker. About the Author - Ryan 
Russell is MIS Manager at SecurityFocus.com. He has served as an expert 
witness on security topics and has done internal security investigation for a 
major software vendor. Ryan has contributed to three Syngress Media books, 
on networking topics. He has a degree in computer science from San Francisco 
State University.

INTRUSION DETECTION: AN INTRODUCTION TO INTERNET SURVEILLANCE, 
CORRELATION, TRACE BACK, TRAPS, AND RESPONSE 

The book presents the details and methodologies associated with intrusion 
detection technology to control cracking activity on the Internet. Topics 
include commercial tools, strategies for processing security audit trails, 
correlation techniques and algorithms, intruder trace back techniques, 
deception-based honey pots and traps, and incident response and disaster 
recovery.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

IPSEC: THE NEW SECURITY STANDARD FOR THE INTER- NET, INTRANETS, 
AND VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS 

Authors Doraswamy and Harkins first treat IPSec as a system, explaining how 
its component parts work together to provide flexible security. Their approach 
to this task makes sense: They first explain why standard IP packets aren't 
secure; then they show how the IPSec improvements make secure transactions 
possible. Readers get full descriptions of how various network entities talk to 
one another. Where appropriate, concepts that aren't specific to IPSec are 
explained, including IPv4 and IPv6 packet structures and addressing schemes. 
There's some information on cryptography too. IPSec's parts are explained 
individually: the Authentication Header (AH), Encapsulating Security Payload 
(ESP), Internet Key Exchange (IKE), and ISAKMP/Oakley protocols are detailed 
with lots of prose, supplemented with a smattering of packet diagrams and 
conceptual sketches. Sections on implementing IPSec protocols on networks 
remain fairly abstract and don't mention actual products, but should prove 
useful to programmers designing their own network security products around 
the IPSec specifications.

PROGRAMMING WINDOWS SECURITY 

Topics covered include: COM(+) security, from the ground up IIS security How 
the file system redirector works and why developers should care The RPC 
security model Kerberos, NTLM, and SSL authentication protocols and SSPI 
Services and the Trusted Computing Base Logon sessions and tokens Window 
stations, desktops, and user profiles The Windows 2000 ACL model, including 
the new model of inheritance Using private security descriptors to secure 
objects Accounts, groups, aliases, privileges, and passwords Comparison of 
three strategies for performing access control - impersonation, role-centric, 
and object-centric - and their impact on the design of a distributed application 
Programming Windows Security provides the most comprehensive coverage of 
COM(+) security available in one place, culled from the author's extensive 
experience in diagnosing COM security problems in the lab and via 
correspondence on the DCOM mailing list.
