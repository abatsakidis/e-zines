E-GAP CUTS OFF HACKER ACCESS
An Israeli high-tech firm says it has developed a system that cuts off the main 
route used by most Internet hackers when they try to break into a company's 
computer network. The new technology by start-up Whale Communications is 
aimed primarily at e-commerce companies that offer goods or services to 
consumers who sometimes are wary about providing credit card information 
over the Internet. Most e-commerce sites use sophisticated encryption to 
encode sensitive information and make it unreadable to outsiders. Whale's 
system, called "E-Gap," goes another route. What it does is ensure that 
hackers cannot jump from the Internet into a company's "back office" - 
the internal Web server or computer where it stores sensitive information 
such as a buyer's credit card details.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR INFORMATION SECURITY
The basic reasons we care about information systems security are that some 
of our information needs to be protected against unauthorized disclosure for 
legal and competitive reasons; all of the information we store and refer to 
must be protected against accidental or deliberate modification and must be 
available in a timely fashion. We must also establish and maintain the 
authenticity (correct attribution) of documents we create, send and receive. 
Finally, if poor security practices allow damage to our systems, we may be 
subject to criminal or civil legal proceedings; if our negligence allows third 
parties to be harmed via our compromised systems, there may be even 
more severe legal problems.

EGGHEAD: NO EVIDENCE HACKER STOLE CREDIT CARD INFO
Egghead.com Inc. said that no customer credit card numbers appear to have 
been stolen from its Web site, two and half weeks after the online retailer 
announced it had detected an intruder in its computer systems. Only about 
7,500 of the more than three million credit card accounts in Egghead's database 
showed evidence of "suspected fraudulent activity", the company said, saying 
those transactions may have been the result of unrelated thefts.

LINUXPPC SECURITY PRIMER, PART II
"If you're like most LinuxPPC users, a large portion of your computing time is 
spent using network-based applications, either explicitly or implicitly. Unless 
you maintain a private physical link with each computer you communicate with, 
this means that your are both sending and receiving data over shared networks. 
And this in turn means that your communications are potentially vulnerable to 
inquisitive (but unwelcome) eavesdroppers."

MACROMEDIA: FLASH IS SECURE
Macromedia Inc. on Monday said its own tests have shown there is no risk that 
its popular Flash multimedia player could allow a computer virus to be sent to 
attack the computers of Internet users.

SEARCH AND SEIZURE EVIDENCE RETRIEVAL AND PROCESSING
This is the sixth article in a series written by Timothy Wright devoted to 
providing a field guide for computer forensics - the investigation of computer 
fraud and abuse. The field guide has thus far addressed questions and issues 
fundamental to investigating computer crime, and detailed methods for 
conducting searches and seizures of physical computer evidence for the 
purpose of computer crime investigation. This article will examine the last 
two stages of search and seizure: evidence retrieval and processing crime 
scene evidence.

NT STILL MOST HACKED WEB SERVER PLATFORM
The year 2000 saw Windows NT steaming ahead yet again as the most hacked 
web server operating system, after a majority of defaced pages were found to 
be sitting on compromised NT boxes. As NT is one of the most popular options 
for web servers, it appears that it is attacked most, however a number of 
companies running web sites on variations of Linux also suffered the 
embarrassment of defacement.

TOP LEVEL DOMAINS: WINNERS AND LOSERS, 2000
"Over year 2000, Attrition.org recorded over 5800 defacements, over 2000 more 
defacements over 1999. Where did all of these defacements come from? Did any 
Top Level Domains manage to reduce their share of defacements over the last 
year in what can only be described as a harsh environment? The answers 
surprised me. I didn't expect to see Brazil leading those countries with gains, 
or the U.S. military heading the list of those TLDs to reduce their absolute 
share of defacements."

ATTACKER BOMBS CHAT NETWORK
A Romanian attacker has launched a major distributed denial of service forcing 
one of the largest IRC networks, Undernet, to shut down much of its service. 
A number of Internet Service Providers hosting Undernet servers - including 
some in the US, the Netherlands and France - have been hit with DDoS attacks.

HISTORY LOOKS AT THE NSA
As anyone who watched Enemy of the State knows, the National Security 
Agency is a rapacious beast with an appetite for data surpassed only by its 
disregard for Americans' privacy. Or is the opposite true, and the ex-No Such 
Agency staffed by ardent civil libertarians? To the NSA, of course, its devilish 
reputation is merely an unfortunate Hollywood fiction. Its director, Lt. Gen. 
Michael Hayden, has taken every opportunity to say so, most recently on a 
History Channel documentary that aired for the first time Monday evening. 
"It's absolutely critical that (Americans) don't fear the power that we have," 
Hayden said on the show.

LINUX.CONF.AU - THE HACKER'S CONFERENCE
The talk of Linux Australia at the moment is about Linux.conf.au. This four-day 
gathering of some of the world's most influential Linux developers is being held 
at the University of New South Wales, Sydney from 17 to 20 January.

BIOMETRICS - WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Biometrics have garnered increasing attention and backing in the last few years. 
We are promised a utopian existence: never again will you forget your password 
or need to remember your access card to get into the building. Unfortunately, it 
isn't quite this simple. While biometrics will be a significant portion of any 
authentication or identification in the future, they cannot replace many 
existing security systems without significant disadvantages. Using biometrics 
in conjunction with other proven security methods can result in a stronger 
solution; but using biometrics on their own is a very bad idea, for numerous 
reasons.

POLICE: HACKERS OF INDIAN SITES TRACED TO PAKISTAN
Indian authorities and computer specialists have traced many cases of hacking 
of Indian Internet sites to Pakistan. "Quite a few of hackers can be traced to 
ISPs (Internet service providers) in Pakistan," R.K. Raghavan, director of the 
Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), told a seminar on Internet security in 
the Indian capital. Raghavan said it would be difficult to nail hackers who broke 
into computer systems without help from Pakistani law enforcers. Indian industry 
officials say hackers broke into at least 635 Indian Internet sites last year.

BOOTS PENETRATED
Britain's biggest chemist had its corporate Web site attacked this morning - by 
a poet. Instead of the usual corporate nonsense, the 534-word poem left 
behind by 'Mentor' tells of the angst of a teenage hacker - but also the 
personal discovery of computer crime. Called The Conscience of a Hacker, 
there is a deliciously dark undercurrent that shines a light on teenage 
angst in a digital generation.

U.S. TURNS ITS TECH EFFORTS TO PREVENTION
In a recent study about new national security threats, CSIS warned that it is 
growing increasingly difficult to distinguish between threats from foreign militaries 
or spies, terrorists, or run-of-the mill hackers. Plus, the interconnectedness of 
America's many computer networks creates tasty new targets; for example, 
taking down a large bank's computer system could do more damage than 
attacking a bank building. The study also noted that 95 percent of U.S. 
military traffic moves over civilian telecommunications and computer networks.

WHAT WAS EBAY'S E-MAIL MOTIVE?
EBay is either a scheming marketing company or an innocent victim of mass 
paranoia launched by a well-intentioned e-mail it sent to its users. The truth 
may be out there, but no one seems to agree on what it is - except that the 
seminal auction site has committed a serious PR blunder. And so the debate 
rages on over whether companies should be allowed to act according to their 
own benefit, if they should give users a fair chance to opt-out of marketing 
plans, or if they should instead be legally required to strictly protect their 
users' privacy above all else.

EUROPE TRIES TO TAKE ON SPAMMERS
Having won the fight against telemarketers, European lawmakers turned their 
sights on one of the banes of the new media age: spam. But at the first public 
hearing to increase Internet privacy by, among other things, banning the 
sending of unsolicited e-mails, the European Union commissioner charged 
with "information society" initiatives conceded that the Web's global nature 
made a crackdown difficult.

CLINTON: RELAX CRYPTO EXPORT CONTROLS
In a move that could be its final action regarding encryption, the Clinton 
administration acknowledged that it can't control security using hardware-
based measures, because even the most innocuous home PCs can be strung 
together to form a powerful computing system. The Department of Defense, 
which has been working with the White House on the issue, agreed.

INFECTED OBJECTS - PART FOUR
No matter how quickly the speed of the Internet increases, we still find it 
convenient to compress files before we send them. Once a file is compressed, 
however, it becomes harder for a virus scanner to find any virus threat that 
may be lurking inside it. The challenge of peering inside the various compression 
and archival formats to discover the viruses hidden there has not gotten easier 
over time. This article - the fourth in a series by Robert Vibert examining 
different aspects of viruses - will discuss the implications of various forms 
of file compression for virus protection.

ENEMIES OF THE INTERNET
Forty-five countries restrict their citizens' access to the internet - usually by 
forcing them to subscribe to a state-run ISP. Twenty of these countries may 
be described as real enemies of this new means of communication. On the 
pretext of protecting the public rom "subversive ideas" or defending "national 
security and unity", some governments totally prevent their citizens from 
gaining access to the internet. Others control a single ISP or even several, 
installing filters blocking access to web sites regarded as unsuitable and 
sometimes forcing users to officially register with the authorities.

WRITING INTERNET WORMS FOR FUN AND PROFIT
The media, kindly supported by AV "experts", have drawn an apocalyptical vison

Rough estimations - $10M lost for "defending the disease", especially when you 
look at increasing with the speed of light value of AV companies market shares, 
made many people curious - is it really the worst disease ever? Or just another 
lame VBS application that is not even able to spread without user "click-me" 
interaction, and is limited to one, desk-end it's original version, kills mp3 files 
on your disk. This article is a study of research on Internet worms.

FBI TARGETS 7 HACKERS
The FBI is conducting an investigation into a ring of seven juvenile hackers - 
three in the US and four based overseas - suspected of plotting a series of 
virus and widespread denial-of-service attacks planned to take place on 
Christmas and New Year's Eve 2000, sources said today. No arrests have 
been made yet in the case, but several FBI field offices have conducted a 
series of "preemptive" search warrants over the past two weeks to keep 
the planned attacks from occurring, one FBI official told Newsbytes.

MAGICFX CHARGED
Jerome T. Heckenkamp, 21, is charged in a 16-count indictment with 
unauthorized access into computers. Acting under the handle MagicFX 
and Magic, Heckenkamp defaced eBay.com in 1999. He also allegedly 
broke into computers at Exodus Communications Inc. , Juniper 
Networks Inc., and Lycos Inc.

that Apple set out to make a cracker's dream machine. The company intended 
to create an affordable start-to-finish video and audio authoring and recording 
system with the new "professional" G4 – which comes with a SuperDrive 
capable of burning DVD and music CDs.

HYBRIS VIRUS: A SLEEPER HIT?
Hybris, a computer worm that uses encrypted plug-ins to update itself, could 
be the sleeper hit of 2001, anti-virus experts say. "It's not a fast mailer or a 
mass mailer. It's slow and subtle," said Roger Thompson, technical director of 
malicious-code research for security firm TruSecure. But "slow and steady wins 
the race." The spread of most computer worms tends to spike quickly and just 
as quickly die out. But the 3-month-old Hybris worm shows no sign of dying 
anytime soon, Thompson said.

INTRODUCTION TO SNOOPY
Although shared libraries present many advantages, they also have their 
disadvantages. One obvious point of failure of the system would be if the 
shared libraries are exploitable. Hence, the shared libraries must be trusted. 
If they are not, the system's security if fully up to that of the shared library. 
For example, consider an untrusted or exploited version of the c library. It 
has a version of the commonly used 'printf' function that not only carries out 
the tasks of the real printf, but in addition has a go at the filesystem, doing 
something similar to 'rm -rf /' when it is being called as root. This can be 
potentially disastrous. The first root user to come along could potentially 
ruin the system.

THE FEDS'LL COME A-SNOOPIN'
Ever wonder how much leeway federal agents have when snooping through 
your e-mail or computer files? The short answer: a lot. The U.S. Department 
of Justice this week published new guidelines for police and prosecutors in 
cases involving computer crimes. The 500 KB document includes a bevy of 
recent court cases and covers new topics such as encryption, PDAs and 
secret searches. It updates a 1994 manual, which the Electronic Privacy 
Information Center had to file a Freedom of Information Act request to 
obtain. No need to take such drastic steps this time: The Justice 
Department has placed the report on its cybercrime.gov site.

SECURITY IS OUT OF STEP WITH EBUSINESS
Fewer than half of blue-chip companies believe that their ebusiness and 
security strategies are effectively coordinated. Business managers are 
guilty of demanding ebusiness at all costs and security is overlooked, 
according to research by analyst group Xephon. IT managers at 64 
companies across various industrial sectors were interviewed for the 
report. Xephon blames the problem on the rigid nature of security 
policies. "The results highlight the need for security policies to be 
more flexible," said Mark Lillycrop, director of research at Xephon.

IRC ATTACK LINKED TO DOS THREAT
Recent cyberattacks on IRC services have now been linked to a National 
Infrastructure Protection Center security warning that advised systems 
administrators to protect their systems against a potential widespread 
distributed denial of service attack over New Year's weekend. According 
to court documents filed by the FBI as well as sources involved in the 
investigation, the agency is now investigating a Lynwood, Washington 
teenager. The teenager is also under investigation for attacking the 
servers of DALNet, an IRC service.

PIMPSHIZ TALKS AFTER FBI RAID
"My defacements are protests," he said. "I want people to think about the 
Napster case positively, not negatively." The state attorneys are waiting 
for the FBI to complete forensics on the computer equipment seized from 
the suspect's home. The equipment amounted to three computers, two 
Palm III devices, a DVD player, and several boxes of computer-related 
equipment, according to the teenager. Although the teenager has admitted 
to almost 200 defacements, many of those are foreign Web sites outside 
the jurisdiction of the FBI.

MALAYSIA GOVERNMENT TO BEEF UP SECURITY
The Malaysian government is taking drastic measures to combat an increasing 
series of hacking incidents involving the Web sites of its agencies and ministries. 
The measures include adding more information and communications technology 
(ICT)-skilled staff to better manage Web sites, and ensuring that all security 
modules and features of software programs used are optimized.

ATTACKERS "WILL TARGET MOBILES NEXT"?
Network Associates says virus attacks are capable of raiding a mobile phone 
to gain personal details about the user. In one case, a virus was able to glean 
banking details from an Internet-enabled WAP mobile phone, the company says. 
Sandra England, a President of one of Network Associations' divisions 
specialising in encryption, said it was possible in theory to send a virus 
as part of a text (SMS) message.

EUROPEAN FIRMS HIT BY POTENT NEW VIRUS
Four European companies have lost all their data in an attack from a new HTML 
virus, it emerged on Friday evening. According to an alert from anti-virus 
developer Panda Software, the worm called Little Davinia spreads via the 
internet and potentially wipes out all files on hard disks and network drives. 
The virus began spreading from a "very large ISP" in Spain, which Panda has 
refused to name. It also declined to name the four companies attacked. Panda 
initially alerted the ISP to the virus and has worked to remove it from the 
provider's systems.

THE FUTURE OF OPERATING SYSTEMS SECURITY
Often computer security takes us down strange paths; for example, what is 
the connection between the Navajo language and the future of operating 
systems? These subjects seem odd bedfellows to be sure; yet, we shall learn 
that obscurity, contrary to the general maxim, sometimes does create a degree 
of security. The current trends in OS development dwell on the mainstream 
players: Linux, Unix, and Windows NT/2000 and their offshoots Trinux, Minix, 
and Windows CE. Linux, for example, will probably continue with a 25% percent 
annual growth rate for the next couple of years. Factors driving the immense 
popularity of these OS families include economics, learning inertia, and the low 
desire for the "overengineering" of security features.

FILE TRANSFER OPTIONS - PART I: SECURE IXPLORER
This is the first-part in a series of articles about different options for secure file 
transfers. I won't cover how to sniff connections, steal passwords or if SSH is 
really "secure". But hopefully, I can provide some information that will be valuable 
for your web hosting clients and for you - the Apache webserver administrators. 
This first article covers a file transfer client for the end users - it requires a 
secure shell server to be installed on the web server. Yes, Secure iXplorer is 
for Microsoft Windows. Basically, iXplorer is a Microsoft Explorer-like, graphical 
front-end to a modified pscp, which is a text-based (DOS) scp client for 
Windows. (Pscp is from the same author of the popular PuTTY SSH client).

PROCESS ACCOUNTING WITH LASTCOMM AND SA
"Over a year ago, I had an interesting job of tracking down how a root 
superuser account vanished. Once I was on the system, it appeared that 
the issue was not malicious and I enjoyed the detective work tracking down 
the problem. I searched RADIUS accounting logs, httpd logs and process 
accounting logs and I was able to pin-point the problem (and the user) within 
seconds: a faulty CGI provided a way for the root account to be removed. 
One of the tools I used was lastcomm - the command for showing last 
commands executed. This article covers the basics of enabling process 
accounting and shows a few examples of using lastcomm and sa to read 
and use the accounting data. These tools can help monitor user activity 
and system usage."

MACROMEDIA ON SHOCKWAVE FLASH BUFFER OVERFLOW
As was posted earlier to BUGTRAQ, an issue has been discovered with the 
Macromedia Flash Player that shows a possible buffer overflow error when 
the player encounters a maliciously or incorrectly created SWF file. After 
an investigation, and consultation with the reporting engineer, Macromedia 
has determined the following:
- The data being accessed is located entirely in a dynamically allocated 
structure in the heap space of the application.
- The data access is limited to reading the information. At no time is the 
buffer in question ever written to. Neither the heap, nor the stack is written 
to during this processing, and at no time does this lead to the execution of 
arbitrary data as native instructions.
Given the above information, it is Macromedia's belief that the error in question, 
though unfortunate, does not constitute a significant security risk. The effects 
of this defect are limited to the crashing of the users client (denial of service).

In as much as the client anticipates that the k: drive is a mapping of the server's 
c: drive, one needs only to realize that the Exact Dental software (which resides 
in c:\NDCDent on the server) does not need a full path and a share compromising 
security on the server to function. A relative path works fine.

PGP 7.0 SIGNATURE VERIFICATION VULNERABILITY
There seems to be a vulnerability in the key import code in PGP 7.0 on the 
Win32/Intel platform, causing a signature on a full exported and ASCII armored 
key block not to be checked when "Decrypt/Verify" is selected to import the 
key(s). This means that any signatures on the full exported key block is not 
checked, opening the possibility for anyone who have write access to the file 
to replace the keys without having to generate a new signature. Key signature 
verification, however, is not affected by this vulnerability.

WORKAROUND NO.1 TO LOTUS NOTES BUG
Today our Domino administrator (Robert Turnsek) and I (Miha Vitorovic) spent 
some time trying to make the recent Domino vulnerability disappear. This is 
what we came up with. 
Domino Server 5.0.5 
- Open the Administration Client 
- Select the server you want to administer 
- "Configuration" tab / "Server" section / Current server document : 
Press the "Web" button 
Select "Create URL mapping/redirection" 
- In the URL redirection document 
+ "Basics" tab 
Select: URL ---> Redirection URL 
+ "Mapping" tab 
Incoming URL: /.nsf/* 
Redirection URL: [the URL you want to redirect to, for example 
"http://www.notes.net"] 
- Save the document 
- Restart the HTTP task
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/979092758,87743,.shtml


WORKAROUND NO.2 TO LOTUS NOTES BUG
Well, as Lotus haven't released a fix for the *confirmed* bug, we get a 
workaround. Adding the following line: 
map */../* /something.nsf 
at httpd.conf, seems to handle the bug. You should notice that EVERYTHING 
using ../ links will stop working too, including the bug!

NETSCREEN FIREWALL BUFFER OVERFLOW
NetScreen Firewall is a popular commercial firewall. It has a Web administration 
interface (default listening at port 80) that allows firewall administrator to 
configure firewall with browser. However, it is lack of length check-up of input 
URL. Provided with a oversized URL request, a buffer overflow may take place 
that will crash the NetScreen firewall. In that case, all connections through 
firewall will be dropped, and the firewall won't response to any connection 
request. Rebooting the firewall is required to regain its functions.

LOTUS ON DOMINO SERVER VULNRABILITY
Lotus has published a statement regarding the recently reported issue "Domino 
Server Directory Traversal Vulnerability". 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/979235602,78963,.shtml


CONFERENCE ROOM VULNERABILITY
Conference Room 1.8.1x or older versions are subject to a DoS attack when 
following commands are used.
Make to connections to the irc server second being the clone of other. On 
second connection (clone)
type "/ns buddy on".
on first connection type "/ns buddy add < clone client nickname>".
on clone type "/ns auth accept 1"
and the services crashes.
Since conference room saves databases at 15min intervals, everything done in 
this period will be deleted. Services cannot connect automatically to the server. 
Only a "/servstart" issued by an ircop or admin will return the services to normal 
functionality and connect to server.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/979235618,27534,.shtml


CRASHING THTTPD
It appears thttpd is resorting to vsprintf() numerous times because it is lacking 
snprintf() and vsnprintf(). The thttpd source clearly states that the code may 
not be secure when running in an environment that does not contain the proper 
header files. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/979235636,24982,.shtml


BACKDOOR IN BORLAND INTERBASE
It has been found that a backdoor has been coded into InterBase since 1992. 
This previously-secret account has full access and an unchangeable, known 
username and password. With this knowlege, attackers can remotely gain 
read and write access to any database on the server.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/979325025,67142,.shtml


EAGLE USA SHIPMENT TRACKING SOFTWARE
"I have discovered that the shipping software distributed by EAGLE USA sends 
Username/Password information in clear text over the internet. This can be 
replicated by installing the software and using a sniffer to view the HTML string 
that gets passed to the server. Very clearly the Username password combo 
appears in clear text in the string. This information could be very useful in a 
corporate espionage situation in which gaining information about product 
shipments by a competitor (how many of what product where shipped at 
what cost to what customer when) could be of use."
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/979325069,4092,.shtml


ULTRABOARD CGI DIRECTORY PERMISSION PROBLEM
In default installation, following Directories below ub2k cgi installtion directory 
have 777 permission.
./Private/Skins
./Private/Database
./Private/Backups
You can add some cgi scripts to theses directories and can gain webserver uid.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/979405525,56482,.shtml


BASILIX WEBMAIL SYSTEM VULNERABILITY
There is a simple mistake in the Basilix Webmail system. If .class file extension is 
not defined as a PHP script at the httpd.conf any attacker may see very valuable 
information by simply enterering the URL : 
http://victim.host/mysql.class
MySQL password and username is stored in this file.

CRYPTO: WHEN THE CODE REBELS BEAT THE GOVERNMENT -
SAVING PRIVACY IN THE DIGITAL AGE

Crypto is about privacy in the information age and about the nerds and 
visionaries who, nearly twenty years ago, predicted that the Internet's 
greatest virtue - free access to information - was also its most perilous 
drawback: a possible end to privacy. Levy explores what turned out to be 
a decisive development in the crypto wars: the unlikely alliance between 
the computer geeks and big business as they fought the government's 
stranglehold on the keys to information in a networked world.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

MISSION CRITICAL INTERNET SECURITY (MISSION CRITICAL SERIES)

The growth of the Internet and its reach into the fabric of business and 
personal life has outdistanced most organizations' ability to protect the 
confidentiality and integrity of information. The increased exposure and 
the constant escalation of threats to network security have increased 
the need for effective controls that can restore availability, confidentiality, 
and integrity to information systems. Mission Critical Internet Security 
shows how security can be provided in TCP/IP at any layer, and outlines 
the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. This book will 
answer the questions you have about Internet Security, including: If I 
use protocol switching on my network, what protocol should I use in 
place of IP? • Should I be placing my VPN gateway at the same level 
as my firewall? • Can I use IPSec to secure communications with my 
Win 9x machines? • Are there back doors in PGP? • Would a firewall or 
other security product interfere with the IDS? • How does SOCKS Proxy 
differ from WinSock Proxy? • I am setting up my outbound access control 
lists to specify which traffic I will permit users to use. How do I know 
which TCP or UDP port a particular application uses?

CRYPTOGRAPHY DECRYPTED: A PICTORIAL INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL SECURITY

The book provides a historical framework on which to build your understanding 
of how and why computer cryptography works. After a discussion of how 
cryptography has evolved into an essential Internet tool, we analyze secret 
key exchange problems and then explain the evolution of public key cryptography, 
with its solution to the key exchange problem. Along the way we explain some 
simple background on the math tricks that make public key cryptography secure. 
Traditionally, those who have thoroughly understood cryptography have been 
trained as mathematicians or scientists. Our goal here is to explain computer 
cryptography with rather little discussion of math. If the esoteric details aren't 
of immediate concern to you, you can skip Chapter 11 ("Making Public Keys: Math 
Tricks"), Chapter 14 ("Message Digest Assurances"), and the appendixes without 
diminishing your understanding of the basic concepts. Appendix A describes some 
aspects of public key mathematics, including inverses, primes, the Fermat test, 
Diffie-Hellman, DSA, elliptic curve, and pseudo-random number generation. 
Appendix B provides details of IPsec, a security system introduced in Chapter 21.
