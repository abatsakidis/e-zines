SMALL BUSINESSES, BIG SECURITY RISKS 
According to a survey released by analyst GartnerGroup smaller companies 
particularly lack the security expertise necessary to fend off computer 
attackers. Its research suggests that, without taking immediate steps 
to remedy the situation, 50 percent of these businesses will be the victim 
of a successful hack or a damaging virus outbreak in the next couple of years.

WATCH OUT FOR MALICIOUS HTML PAGES 
Recently discovered security hole in Internet Explorer 5 (allowing for not 
signed ActiveX components to perform malicious actions on PC) led to 
invention of new virus callec GODMESSAGE. The computer can be infected 
by simply viewing the web page, containing the Active X applet. Message 
from the creators : "godmessageIV.html - view, get rooted. It is a modified 
tHing 1..6 server without ICQ notification, without hide process (so it will 
run on NT/w2k). A fellow named splyc took out the ICQ notification which 
I got from blade's forums. I took out the hide process function because it 
was not allowing the tHing to run on NT or 2k. The tHing listens on port 
7777 and the password is pass."

FIREWALLS 
"Simply put, a Firewall is a system that prevents unauthorized access to 
or from a private network by examining the incoming packets and/or 
requests coming from (in this case) the Internet. Here’s an analogy, let’s 
say a firewall is like a bouncer at a 21 and over bar called MyNetworkRocks, 
and the unauthorized InternetGuru is under 21. Well, because InternetGuru 
is under 21 he’s not getting past the firewall (bouncer) into MyNetworkRocks, 
at least not easily. Firewalls can be setup with software, hardware, or both, 
depending on how paranoid, I mean secure, you want to be."

INTERPOL ORDERS IMMEDIATE CYBERCRIME ACTION 
The head of Interpol has warned nations, law enforcement groups and 
companies to act swiftly if they are to stand any chance of beating 
cybercrime. Speaking at a conference in London Wednesday, Raymond 
Kendall, secretary general of Interpol said his organisation is concerned 
that unlawful computer techniques are developing at such a rate that 
they represent a "new phenomenon" for international law enforcers. Kendall 
urged international organisations not to wait for conventions to be passed 
before drawing up guidelines for an allied response to the threat of cybercrime.

FORMER BELLCORE CEO SEES LOOMING NETWORK SECURITY ISSUES 
"Network security will be a bigger problem than data security," according 
to former Bellcore CEO George Heilmeier. Heilmeier offered 10 predictions 
for the IT and telecom industries at a forum this week at Columbia University. 
Heilmeier explained that third parties who intentionally block access to e-mail 
pose a greater danger than the risk the information will be read.

HARDWARE FIREWALL RUNS ON NSA TECHNOLOGY 
A relationship with the National Security Agency has netted Marconi 
Communications the technology to produce a firewall that is said to run 
at OC-12 speeds (622 Mbits/second) and to be undetectable to potential 
intruders. The technology, licensed from the NSA and sold back to the 
agency in product form, is part of a longstanding relationship between 
government agencies and Fore Systems Inc., which Marconi (Pittsburgh) 
acquired last year.

WEB-BASED E-MAIL ISN'T SAFE FROM CORPORATE EYES 
Slashdot has a big discussion related to the October 3rd CNET article - 
"Unfortunately, security experts say many employees would be surprised to 
know that Web-based email services also offer little privacy. Messages sent 
via a Yahoo or Hotmail account, or through instant messaging products, such 
as ICQ or America Online's Instant Messenger (AIM), are just as accessible 
to nosy employers."

Security issues 
--------------- 

All vulnerabilities are located at: 
http://net-security.org/text/bugs 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

MASTER INDEX TRAVERSE ADVISORY 
Synnergy Labs has found a flaw within Master Index that allows a user to 
successfully traverse the filesystem on a remote host, allowing arbitary 
files/folders to be read. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971179170,91401,.shtml 


DEBIAN LINUX - NEW VERSIONS OF BOA PACKAGES 
In versions of boa before 0.94.8.3, it is possible to access files outside of the 
server's document root by the use of properly constructed URL requests. 
This problem is fixed in version 0.94.8.3-1, uploaded to Debian's unstable 
distribution on October 3, 2000. Fixed packages are also available in proposed 
updates and will be included in the next revision of Debian/2.2 (potato). 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971179295,4133,.shtml 


DEBIAN LINUX - ESOUND PACKAGE IS NOT AFFECTED 
Linux-Mandrake has recently released a Security Advisory covering a race 
condition in the esound. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971179403,38597,.shtml 


CONNECTIVA LINUX - TMPWATCH LOCAL DOS 
Versions of the tmpwatch package as shipped with Conectiva Linux contain a 
vulnerability which could lead to a local DoS. These versions, though, are not 
vulnerable to the local root exploit published earlier because they do not have 
the fuser option, which appeared only in later versions. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971179510,7441,.shtml 


SUSE LINUX - NOT AFFECTED TO TMPWATCH PROBLEM 
"The tmpwatch packages as shipped with SuSE distributions are not vulnerable 
to the attacks as discussed on security forums, initiated and discovered by 
zenith parsec. The version of tmpwatch that we ship is a bit older than the 
bleeding edge, but it has proven to do what it says, which is just as important. 
We did not (silently) fix the problems in the package - the version that we use 
does not have the features that cause the security problems." 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971179586,22555,.shtml 


TRUSTIX SECURE LINUX - TMPWATCH PROBLEMS 
All versions of Trustix Secure Linux have hitherto been shipped with a version 
of tmpwatch that can be tricked into excessive fork()ing filling up the process 
table, requiring the box to be rebooted. The version of tmpwatch can also, in 
certain cases, be tricked into giving local users a root shell. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971179653,98073,.shtml 


EXTROPIA WEBSTORE DIR TRAVERSAL VULNERABILITY 
The Web Store is a shopping cart product by eXtropia. This script merges 
Selena Sol's Electronic Outlet HTML and Database shopping cart apps and 
adds all new routines for error handling, order processing, encrypted mailing, 
frames, Javascript and VBscript. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971179782,82714,.shtml 


INTERACTIVE'S WEB SHOPPER DIR TRAVERSAL VULNERABILITY 
shopper.cgi allows users to switch between product pages using the 
$VALUES{'newpage'} variable. This would make 
http://example.com/cgi-bin/shopper.cgi?newpage=product1.htm display product1.htm. 
Although this script has regex statements that single out the double dot (..), 
it does not perform these checks by default. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971179934,13930,.shtml 


MICROSOFT SECURITY - "SHARE LEVEL PASSWORD" PATCH 
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in 
Microsoft Windows 95, 98, 98SE, and Windows Me. The vulnerability could 
allow a malicious user to programmatically access a Windows 9x/ME file 
share without knowing the entire password assigned to that share. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971265164,93554,.shtml 


MANDRAKE LINUX - OPENSSH UPDATE 
A problem exists with openssh's scp program. If a user uses scp to move 
files from a server that has been compromised, the operation can be used 
to replace arbitrary files on the user's system. The problem is made more 
serious by setuid versions of ssh which allow overwriting any file on the 
local user's system. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971265294,96285,.shtml 


SHRED 1.0 BUG REPORT 
Ran a test with Shred v1.0 and found some unexpected results. This utility is 
supposed to overwrite a file with several passes of different bit patterns followed 
by one random pattern. The file is then unlinked. This is supposed to make the 
file unrecoverable with utilities which read raw disk blocks. Using the icat utility 
from Dan Farmer and Wietze Venema's TCT Toolkit it appears that the data is 
not overwritten. This test was done on two different RedHat 6.0 systems. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971265364,54158,.shtml 


HP JETDIRECT MULTIPLE DOS 
The firmware in the HP JetDirect card contain multiple vulnerabilities that can 
have effects ranging from the service crashing to the printer initiating a 
firmware upgrade based on random garbage in the memory, and in the last 
case powercycling won't fix the crash. It requires a new firmware burn by 
eg. HP to restore the Jetdirect card. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971265417,19017,.shtml 


MS - WEBTV FOR WINDOWS DENIAL OF SERVICE 
There is a denial of service vulnerability in WebTV for Windows that may allow 
a malicious user to remotely crash either the WebTV for Windows application 
and/or the computer system running WebTV for Windows. Restarting the 
application and/or system will return the system to its normal state. Microsoft 
has released a patch that eliminates this security vulnerability. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971375310,5567,.shtml 


MANDRAKE LINUX - APACHE UPDATE 
The Apache web server comes with a module called mod_rewrite which is used 
to rewrite URLs presented by the client prior to further processing. There is a 
flaw in the mod_rewrite logic that allows an attacker to view arbitrary files on 
the server system if they contain regular expression references. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971375814,81283,.shtml 


PHP REMOTE FORMAT STRING VULNERABILITIES 
Format string vulnerabilities exist in the error logging routines of PHP versions 3 
and 4, allowing remote users to execute arbitrary code under the web server's 
user id. A web server having PHP installed and one or more PHP scripts is 
vulnerable to the problem if error logging is enabled in php.ini. Also any PHP 
script using the "syslog" command of PHP may be vulnerable, regardless of 
error logging. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971375894,65809,.shtml 


PROBLEM WITH NETSCAPE MESSAGING SERVER 4.15 
The problem is that the POP3 server displays a different message for an 
authentication error due to an invalid password then for one due to an invalid 
username. This could be used to "harvest" email addresses for spam lists. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971439529,51461,.shtml 


APACHE 1.3.14 RELEASED 
The Apache Software Foundation and The Apache Server Project are pleased 
to announce the release of version 1.3.14 of the Apache HTTP server. Version 
1.3.13 was never released. This version of Apache is primarily a security fix and 
bug fix release, but there are a few new features and improvements. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971484402,83017,.shtml 


DEBIAN LINUX - CURL AND CURL-SSL UPDATE 
The version of curl as distributed with Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 had a bug in the 
error logging code: when it created an error message it failed to check the size 
of the buffer allocated for storing the message. This could be exploited by the 
remote machine by returning an invalid response to a request from curl which 
overflows the error buffer and trick curl into executing arbitrary code. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971559341,76634,.shtml 


REMOTE RETRIEVAL OF AUTHENTICATION DATA FROM IE 
"We will show that it could be possible to retrieve the cached authentication 
data from your user's web browser with little or no user's cooperation, even 
when due care was taken to protect the communication between browser 
and server with SSL." 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971559586,2881,.shtml 


MS - "CACHED WEB CREDENTIALS" VULNERABILITY 
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in 
Microsoft Internet Explorer. Under a daunting set of conditions, the 
vulnerability could enable a malicious user to obtain another user's userid 
and password to a web site. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971559684,92219,.shtml 


MANDRAKE LINUX - MOD_PHP3 UPDATE 
PHP version 3 which ships with Linux-Mandrake are vulnerable to format string 
attacks due to logging functions that make improper use of the syslog() and 
vsnprintf() functions. This renders PHP3-enabled servers vulnerable to 
compromise by remote attackers. This attack is only effective on PHP 
installations that log errors and warnings while those servers that do 
not are not affected. By default, Linux-Mandrake systems do not have 
logging enabled. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971559791,26568,.shtml 


ANACONDA FOUNDATION DIRECTORY VULNERABILITY 
Synnergy Labs has found a flaw within Anaconda Foundation Directory that 
allows a user to successfully traverse the filesystem on a remote host, 
allowing arbitary files/folders to be read 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971559891,18741,.shtml 


CALDERA SECURITY UPDATE: FORMAT BUG IN PHP 
There's a format bug in the logging code of the mod_php3 module. It uses 
apache's aplog_error function, passing user-specified input as the format 
string. This can be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary shell 
commands under the HTTP server account (user httpd). In order for this bug 
to be exploitable, the PHP error logging must be enabled. By default, error 
logging is off. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971690142,53185,.shtml 


WINU 1.0-5.1 BACKDOOR PASSWORDS 
"After downloading WinU 5.1 I noticed the built-in "emergency password" 
capability, mentioned in the help file. I decided to take a look around. 
AND WOW! GOT 'EM ALL!" 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971690328,13624,.shtml 


DEBIAN LINUX - LOCAL EXPLOIT IN NIS PACKAGE 
The version of nis as distributed in Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 and 2.2 contains an 
ypbind package with a security problem. ypbind is used to request information 
from a nis server which is then used by the local machine. The logging code in 
ypbind was vulnerable to a printf formating attack which can be exploited by 
passing ypbind a carefully crafted request. This way ypbind can be made to 
run arbitrary code as root. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/971690367,54647,.shtml 


MS - "NETMEETING DESKTOP SHARING" VULNERABILITY 
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in 
NetMeeting, an application that ships with Microsoft Windows 2000 and is 
also available as a separate download for Windows NT 4.0. The vulnerability 
could allow a malicious user to temporarily prevent an affected machine from 
providing any NetMeeting services and possibly consume 100% CPU utilization 
during an attack.

UNVERIFIED FIELDS - A PROBLEM WITH FIREWALLS & FIREWALL TECHNOLOGY TODAY 
by Ofir Arkin 

The following problem (as discussed in this paper) has not yet been identified. 
Certain firewalls today, will not authenticate the validity of certain protocol fields, 
within the packet they are processing. The risk is exposure of information. What 
kind of information can be exposed? Mainly it will be unique patterns of behavior 
produced by the probed machines answering our crafted queries (or other kind of 
network traffic initiated in order to elicit a reply). Those patterns will help a 
malicious computer attacker to identify the operating systems in use.

TESTING TIMES FOR TROJANS by Ian Whalley 

In the field of computing, Trojan horses have been around for even longer 
than computer viruses – but traditionally have been less of a cause for 
concern amongst the community of PC users. In recent years, however, 
they have been the focus of increased attention from anti-virus companies 
and heightened levels of user concern. This paper aims to investigate the 
Trojan phenomenon; particular attention will be paid to the claims made in 
the field of NVM detection and those made by those who aim to test the 
vendors’ claims.

A STUDY-GUIDE ON HOW TO DETECT A VIRUS HOAX YOURSELF by Kaspersky Lab 

It is difficult to imagine anybody today who does not treat computer viruses as 
a real threat to a regularly functioning computer system. However, contiguously 
with the virus spreading has occurred another syndrome, which is not any less 
dangerous – virus hoaxes.

THINK UNIX 

The many variants of the Unix operating system require use of a mode of 
thought that's significantly different from the one that's required by simpler 
operating systems. Think Unix introduces readers to important fundamental 
and intermediate Unix commands and, in the process, inculcates them in the 
Unix way of thinking. It's a worthy goal in a world with more Linux users than 
ever, and author Jon Lasser accomplishes it. He's both a capable writer and a 
knowledgeable user of Unix shell commands. Lasser uses bash under Red Hat 
Linux in most examples, which usually apply equally well to other Unix variants, 
and makes asides about other shells and environments, as needed.

SOLARIS 8: THE COMPLETE REFERENCE 

This book shows you what you need to understand if you want to make a 
living as administrator of a modern Sun workstation. Of course, this book is 
not absolutely complete - no technical book about a subject as large as 
Solaris 8 could hope to be - but it should be more than adequate for most 
readers' purposes. Whether you have experience with another enterprise 
operating system and have recently been charged with figuring out Solaris, 
or you're a long-time Solaris jock and need a handy reference to guide you 
through procedures that you don't follow every day, this book has your 
number.

THE HUNDREDTH WINDOW: PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY AND SECURITY IN 
THE AGE OF THE INTERNET 

The proverbial hundredth window represents the most vulnerable link in a system. 
It derives from an allegory relating castle windows to potential security holes. If 
even one out of a hundred windows is left open, security becomes compromised. 
Since the Internet maximizes information sharing (admittedly a largely beneficial 
enterprise) would-be big-time marketers and shady characters can - without 
trying all that hard--spy on your Web clicking habits, read your e-mail, and even 
see files on your hard disk drive. This means you may receive spam from 
marketers who think they know what kind of stuff you like to buy--e-mail that 
can be helpful to some and aggravating to others. Sharing your name and other 
identifying personal information can cause you more serious problems: someone 
else could use that information to commit fraud or other crimes--and you would 
be responsible.

WINDOWS: SYSTEM POLICY EDITOR 

Considering that most administrators could figure out the System Policy Editor 
through experimentation and some study of its documentation - this book 
includes lots of advice on proper use of the utility. Case studies are most 
helpful; a typical one explains how to set up system policies for a machine 
that will live in a university computer lab that's accessible to the public. 
Topics covered: How and why to use the Windows System Policy Editor to 
set user, group, and computer access privileges on computers that run 
Windows 9x and Windows NT. The user interface is fully documented, as 
are the structure and syntax of policy files and templates.
