ATTACKING WEB SITES TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT 
Several sites around the world were reportedly broken into and changed last 
week by one or more people claiming to be calling attention to the fight 
between the music industry and the digital music-swapping Web site Napster. 
A manifesto of sorts was posted in support of Napster's fight against music 
industry labels, titled "The Save Napster Hack Attack."

HIRING HACKERS - RANT 
"Palante", who works in an unnamed Fortune 500 company's infosec consulting 
division, posted his opinion on all those struggles that some companies started 
with saying that people shouldn't hire hackers.

PRETENDER 
Someone tried to dupe several Malaysian Internet users into giving away their 
private financial information by posing as an online executive at Maybank 
company. The article has a standard mistake - trojans are connected with the 
word hacker.

WRISTWATCHES COULD PROVIDE THE KEY TO BETTER IT SECURITY 
A US company has devised a plan to make IT security as simple as telling 
the time - by incorporating an automated PC locking device into wristwatches. 
Michigan-based Ensure technologies argue that despite the furore about 
attackers, most breaches of security occur in-house - namely in users' 
complacency in leaving PCs switched on or divulging their passwords to 
others.

THE WORLD'S MOST SECURE OPERATING SYSTEM 
"OpenBSD is probably one of the most secure operating systems out there," 
says Chris Brenton, author of Mastering Network Security. "The crew does 
a fantastic job of locking down and being responsive when vulnerabilities 
are found." Such a good job that the U.S. Department of Justice uses 260 
copies of OpenBSD to store and transmit its most sensitive data..."

BT WEB SITE SECURITY BLUNDER 
The Insight Interactive portion of the BT.com Web site has a gaping hole 
in its security. Any registered user's details can be accessed by entering 
their user name and password. The trouble is, the same password works 
whichever username you use.

WILL 3G DEVICES BE SECURE? 
While anticipating the delights of 3G, be aware of the inherent dangers. 
According to computer security experts, all this connectivity and 
functionality will inevitably mean an increased risk of attack by mobile 
viruses and worms as well as malicious attackers. Evidence of potential 
for new threats can already be seen. Earlier this month Japan's highly 
successful mobile broadband standard i-mode ran into its first major 
security issue highlighting the dangers ahead.

NASTY PGP BUG 
Ralf Senderek has found a nasty bug in PGP versions 5 and 6. It's of 
scientific interest because it spectacularly confirms a prediction made 
by a number of researchers in the paper on `The Risks of Key Recovery, 
Key Escrow, and Trusted Third-Party Encryption' that key escrow would 
make it much more difficult than people thought to build secure systems.

PIKACHU WORM SPREADING 
A computer worm featuring the cuddly Japanese cartoon character 
Pikachu has been found in computers in the United States, leaving

HOW TO SPY ON YOUR EMPLOYEES 
Companies that want to spy on employees' Internet usage already 
have an array of tools. Research firm IDC predicts that in four years, 
the industry will generate $562 million in revenue. But employers fixated 
on monitoring employees may be wasting time and killing morale. Moreover, 
they may be setting themselves up to be sued.

HOAX HITS EMULEX 
Shares of Emulex tumbled to $43 from their previous close of $113.063

Security issues 
--------------- 

All vulnerabilities are located at: 
http://net-security.org/text/bugs 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


FRONTPAGE SERVER EXTENSIONS SHTML.EXE DOS 
The FrontPage Server Extensions are vulnerable to a remote denial of service 
attack that will disable all FrontPage operations on a web site. By requesting a 
URL that includes a DOS device name, the server extensions will hang and will 
not service any further requests. To re-enable the server extensions requires 
restarting IIS or rebooting the server. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/967048516,37265,.shtml 


REMOTE DOS IN PRAGMA TELNETSERVER 2000 
The Ussr Labs team has recently discovered a buffer overflow memory problem 
in the rpc module of the Pragma TelnetServer 2000. What happens is by 
performing an attack with a malformed request to port 512 it will cause 
the process containing the services to crash. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/967122232,16999,.shtml 


WEBSERVER PRO 2.3.7 VULNERABILITY 
The vulnerability (or bad server administration) allow any user to create 
arbitrary files with arbitrary text on the victim machine, from the Internet 
Web Browser. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/967214843,48495,.shtml 


[MANDRAKE LINUX] XCHAT UPDATE 
XChat 1.3.9 and later allow users to right-click on a URL appearing in an 
IRC discussion and select the "Open in Browser" option. To open the URL in 
a browser, XChat passes the command to /bin/sh. This allows a malicious 
URL the ability to execute arbitrary shell commands as the user that is running 
XChat. This update changes the functionality of XChat to bypass the shell 
and execute the browser directly. Thanks go to Red Hat for providing the patch. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/967214951,8515,.shtml 


[CALDERA LINUX] LD.SO UNSETENV PROBLEM 
A bug has been discovered in ld.so that could allow local users to obtain super 
user privilege. The dynamic loader ld.so is responsible for making shared libraries 
available within a program at run-time. Normally, a user is allowed to load 
additional shared libraries when executing a program; they can be specified 
with environment variables like LD_PRELOAD. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/967215087,33684,.shtml 


"IIS CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING" VULNERABILITIES PATCHED 
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates security vulnerabilities in Microsoft 
Internet Information Server. The vulnerabilities could allow a malicious web site 
operator to misuse another web site as a means of attacking users. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/967298521,30706,.shtml 


"MONEY PASSWORD" VULNERABILITY PATCHED 
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in 
Microsoft Money. The vulnerability could allow a malicious user to obtain 
the password of a Money data file. 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/967298631,3545,.shtml 


ADVISORY: MGETTY LOCAL COMPROMISE 
Faxrunqd follows symbolic links when creating certain files. The default location 
for the files is /var/spool/fax/outgoing, which is a world-writable directory. Local 
users can destroy the contents of any file on a mounted filesystem because 
faxrunqd is usually run by root 
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/967304131,68635,.shtml 


KERBEROS PASSWORD AUTHENTICATION ISSUES 
Kerberized programs that perform password authentication may be vulnerable 
to an attacker with the ability to spoof KDC responses (either as a race 
condition on the LAN, or via DNS cache poisoning, spoofed ICMP redirects 
or router advertisments, etc.).

CONSOLE IOCTLS UNDER LINUX by Shok (Matt Conover) 

Console IOCTLs can be very useful and powerful. These are the IOCTls that 
involve the console. They are the user interface to manipulation of the console. 
I am going to go over these console IOCTLs and give you examples of them. 
You can make some pretty powerful programs, whether they be general utilities 
or security programs, with these (such as Auto Console Switching and Console 
Access Protection). The structure of this article will be the name of the IOCTL, 
and then example source code to uses of the IOCTL.

TRUST ON TRIAL: HOW THE MICROSOFT CASE IS REFRAMING THE RULES 
OF COMPETITION 

Is Microsoft truly a classic monopoly, whose aggressive pursuit of markets for 
Internet browsers and operating systems is harmful to consumers and worthy 
of government intervention? Or has it actually been a victim of aggressive rivals 
(led by Sun, Novell, Oracle, and IBM) who called in high-level favors to keep Bill 
Gates & Company out of the lucrative market for network servers? Richard 
McKenzie, a noted economist and the author of more than 20 books, is 
convinced of the latter. He advances a formidable argument on that behalf in 
Trust on Trial, which maintains "the Microsoft case has shown--and not for the 
first time - how politics can taint the antitrust enforcement process." Starting 
with copies of major U.S. antitrust laws, McKenzie shows how cases such as 
this eventually may affect consumers in both the short and long term.

WAP book on the market, this volume shows its readers how to do real work by 
using WAP, Wireless Markup Language (WML), WMLScript, and various toolkits 
and servers that ease wireless application development. Best of all, the authors 
realize that most folks working as WAP developers have Web roots; they explain 
their subjects in terms that anyone with a bit of HTML and Web-scripting 
(JavaScript or VBScript) background should be able to follow easily.

DESIGNING SECURE WEB-BASED APPLICATIONS FOR MICROSOFT WINDOWS 2000 

"Web-based applications" is getting to be a redundant term, but that only 
highlights the fact that up-to-date programmers need to be familiar with the 
strategies and practices used to build modern networked software. Designing 
Secure Web-Based Applications for Microsoft Windows 2000 explains precisely 
what its title specifies: the mechanisms for allowing Windows programs to 
communicate over the network while maintaining security, plus their ways of 
fitting into complete product architectures. It's an engineering document 
with considerable information on identifying security threats, giving them 
relative weight, and deciding how to deal with them in the designs of your 
systems. The author has both done his homework and worked in the industry, 
and it's a pleasure to read his distilled knowledge.

FIRESTARTER 0.4.1 (LINUX) 

The goal of FireStarter is to provide an easy to use, yet powerful, GUI tool for 
setting up, administrating and monitoring firewalls for Linux machines. FireStarter 
is made for the GNOME desktop. It can actively monitor your firewall and list any 
unauthorized connection attempts made to your machine in a readable table 
format. Changes: Better service determination, can launch firewall on PPP 
connect, and bug fixes.

APPSTRAKA 3.10 

AppsTraka is a powerful security program you can use to paint a very clear 
picture of how others are using your computer. You can set it up to log all 
open windows, including title, time, and duration, and to save screenshots of 
your desktop at a regular interval of your choosing. Beyond surveillance, 
AppsTraka allows you to deny access to any programs on your computer, 
based on the current user. You can simply deny access altogether, impose a 
time limit, or require a password to access any program you add to the secured 
list. You can also hide items from the Start menu and select drives. You can run 
AppsTraka in stealth mode, making the program all but undetectable, or make it 
as visible as you wish, complete with warning messages. 
This download expires after 30 days. The cost to register is $30.

QMAIL-SCANNER 0.92 (LINUX) 

Qmail-Scanner (also known as Scan4Virus) is an addon that enables a Qmail 
e-mail server to scan all gatewayed e-mail for certain characteristics. It is 
typically used for its anti-virus protection functions, in which case it is used in 
conjunction with commercial virus scanners. But it also enables a site to react 
to e-mail that contains specific strings in particular headers, or particular 
attachment filenames or types. Qmail-Scanner is integrated into the mail server 
at a lower level than some other Unix-based virus scanners, resulting in better 
performance. It is capable of scanning not only locally sent/received e-mail, but 
also e-mail that crosses the server in a relay capacity.

alert you so you can safely shutdown your machine, log off, or disconnect from 
the Internet. NetArmor is not a firewall, but a connection monitoring utility - 
good for personal and corporate protection. NetArmor can detect attacks from 
over 350 common backdoors. The unregistered version limits monitoring sessions 
to 10 minutes. Registration costs $19.95.

NMAP 2.54 BETA (LINUX) 

Nmap is a utility for port scanning large networks, although it works fine for 
single hosts. Sometimes you need speed, other times you may need stealth. In 
some cases, bypassing firewalls may be required. Not to mention the fact that 
you may want to scan different protocols (UDP, TCP, ICMP, etc.). Nmap 
supports Vanilla TCP connect() scanning, TCP SYN (half open) scanning, TCP 
FIN, Xmas, or NULL (stealth) scanning, TCP ftp proxy (bounce attack) scanning, 
SYN/FIN scanning using IP fragments (bypasses some packet filters), TCP ACK 
and Window scanning, UDP raw ICMP port unreachable scanning, ICMP scanning 
(ping-sweep), TCP Ping scanning, Direct (non portmapper) RPC scanning, Remote 
OS Identification by TCP/IP Fingerprinting, and Reverse-ident scanning. Nmap 
also supports a number of performance and reliability features such as dynamic 
delay time calculations, packet timeout and retransmission, parallel port scanning, 
detection of down hosts via parallel pings.
