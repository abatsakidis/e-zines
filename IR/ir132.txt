	Opinions are like assholes, everyone has them. I understand this and
have my own set of opinions but STOP shoving them in my fucking FACE. Pro-
life, pro-this, pro-that, just shut the fuck up. I could tell you what I'm 
for, but it's useless. They are my opinions, nobody else's. Someone might 
share a similar or same opinion, but these are my views, they may change, but
not because you don't like something and shove it in my face. 	

	And if I tell you this, don't be pissed off. I care about my 
opinions, not yours. If I ask for your opinions, unless you feel 
uncomfortable, tell me then. Otherwise please shut your mouth. These people
that protest abortion clinics need to shut up. There is killing going on 
elsewhere with people that are capable of not wanting to die. And why bomb a
clinic? You are supposed to be pro-life. Talk about contradicting what you 
are all for.

	Remember that bumper stickers are for bands you like, funny things, 
and other fun stuff. Not shoving your opinion in people's faces.
