		My life totally sucks. No, wait; start over.


		There once was a boy. Or it could be a girl. It's entirely
possible but that's not the point. Oh shit, nevermind. Anyway, the boy's name
was Santa Fe Bo. It doesn't matter what hi s name was OK? Fuck.


		The things he said, right, they made sense to some of the
people who heard them but to others it was complete gibberish. So for example
he would say like "aasf2wa3rvv" and some folks would be all Yeah, I agree the
weather today is beautiful. Right? But others would be like what the fuck.
Don't talk about the weather when my mother just died. She talked about the
weather all the time, you know?


		Thsi is what she looked like. She was the love of my life.

                I once asked her what he thought rollerskating would be like.
"Oh I don't know, I'm not really interested. I mean, it's not a big priority
or goal at this point in my life."

		And I thought, why can't more people feel that way?



                All of this, of course, leads up to the fact that my life
absolutely sucks. I am miserable all the time. Yeah you heard me; all the
time. Actually, that's a lie. I simply lack the adjectives to describe the way
I feel. I don't like it any more than you do. I'm sorry if you're
disappointed but I mean, I am too. Try not to be so selfish.

		My entire life has led up to this point. People say that a
lot, don't they, and it's true. People also marvel at the fact that out of all
of those millions of sperm, they were the strongest. I think about that a lot,
especially in times when I've got that dirty rotten low-down feeling, right?
I tell myself, "Hey buddy, why so glum? Don't you know that out of millions of
sperm you were the strongest, the most driven to succeed?" It makes me feel
good. You should try it sometime; you'll feel good too. And if you don't, you
might as well kill yourself. I'm sorry, but that's just the way I feel.

		EVERYONE IN THIS WORLD IS A WINNER he said. NEVER FORGET THAT,
CHAMP.

		I used to be frustrated when I encountered stupid people, but
not anymore. I now realize that I had a bad attitude. Nowadays I tell myself,
they're not stupid, they're just lucky. I'm lucky too. And so are you; I don't
CARE what you had for dinner.


		I tell myself lots of things. You should try it sometimes.
Just don't tell yourself things OUT LOUD, or people will think you're CRAZY!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA CRAZY!! LIKE AS IF YOU BELONG IN A MENTAL INSTITUTION YOU DIG!
But I mean, really, why is it considered CRAZY to talk to yourself? You talk
to yourself in your head anyway, so what's the big deal? When I see people
talking to themselves in public I think, that person knows where it's at.
Other people think, that person is crazy.  Who is right? Nobody knows but 
Jesus.

		I'll get back to you after I get my ENGLISH LIT degree and
become a teacher at some lowly public high school. Next time someone asks you
what you do for a living or whatever, tell them you're a mathematician. Most
people will say, "Oh, I was never good at math in school." People don't like
math because it's much better at explaining the mysteries of the universe than
human languages are and as such is a lot harder to understand for most folks.
It says so in the Bible.


		My father sang that song: my father peered at me through the
car window: his breath stank.

	 		O the wild rose blossoms 
         	        on the little green place O
         	        the green wothe botheth

                He sang that song it was his song. Blow it out your ass,
Ronald Reagan. God must be dead if you're such a fool. Singing the Smithsonian
INStitute blues.

		Hehehehe it doesn't matter what I write you will read it
anyway SUCKER!!! ehehehehe I hope you aren't doing anything IMPORTANT!
               

                  hehehehehehe
