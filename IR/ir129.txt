	Monday and Tuesday of Spring Br(g)eek I had to travel with my mother
and brother to Louisianna to visit family. All you do in southern culture is
"visit." You sit around and pass the time by "visiting." This consists of 
talking loudly about nothing in particular. Conversation has no real point.
Communication is not the objective. The sheer reason is to pass the time in 
each other's company, no matter how pleasant or not.

	So you sit there just talking about stupid things... like your dog's
behavior and how you shop for groceries or something. This is by far the most
mundane, mind-numbing experience I've ever had to endure. Hours upon hours on
end. Nothing but sitting. "Visiting." Doing nothing constructive. Just 
letting time pass. Letting it pass as you do nothing about the crap you 
complain about. Complaining about stuff that doesnt even directly involve 
you. Why do people sit around and do this. Get up! Do something! Live! 
BE!!! For some reason you have to sit around for at least an hour for it to 
be socially acceptable that you did indeed "visit." Otherwise it's rude. I
dont like this practice. It's part of the southern "culture" or "religion" 
(because they follow certain Southern Sacrements as "visiting") Growing up I
never liked the term "visit." I still dont. There's a certain connotation to
it that I myself would prefer not to be a part of. I hate chit-chat and small
talk. I wish I didnt have to do it. I avoid it. No wonder I'm no good at
dating. I want conversation. I want communication. 

Please do not just talk at me. Talk to me. Be interesting. BE.
