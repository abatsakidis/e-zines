The day of the pep rally five teenagers stood very nervously outside the 
gymnasium. They all carried small duffel bags and wore dark black trench 
coats. Leaning against the wall they decided to follow the football team when
they entered. The teens decided it was time and unzipped their duffel bags. 5
masks were pulled out, one from each bag, and were slipped onto the heads of 
the 5 teens. One almost had the contents fall out of the trenchcoat.

Now Clinton, Nixon, FDR, JFK and the guy from Scream stood there nervously 
and decided to walk in the doorway and stand under the bleachers, plotting 
what the best exit was. The fight song began to play and the football team 
ran into the gym with their heads held high, because they won the football 
game the week before, and knew they were going to win again. The team had no
 idea what was coming to them and the rest of the school.

The 5 presidents ran out after them and in the middle of the gym, the trench
coats dropped from their bodies and revealed what they were hiding very 
well. The gymnasium had a deafening silence come over it, some of the people
covering their eyes. Now 5 buck naked presidents were running through the 
gymnasium with their teenage goodie bags hanging out and flopping with every
step.

The band suddenly broke the silence and began to play the fight song again, 
with twice as much spirit.
