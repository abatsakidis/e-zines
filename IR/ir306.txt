        we all picked sides.
        or claimed neutrality while
         sceretly forming alliances.


                                it was a war.
                           a battle of attrition.


        we stabbed our friends in the back
        or betrayed ourselves, or just never
         stood for anything to begin with
 

                                      it was us vs. them
                                      but who the fuck was us
                                      if no one trusted anybody else?


        i've met a few good people in this world,
        but am never convinced that it is enough.

      but that's how war goes.
      and more so, that's how love goes.

                           a battle of attrition.
