                 A PROBING QUESTION:
   at what point is text really truly offcially DEAD?
 if people like me and you and our pal Dr. BMC still
 hold on to the half-truth that there ain't a nothing going
 wrong here, but that text is still LIVING IT UP, SUCKA, then
 -how far- will we run with that POINT OF VIEW?

                IS TEXT DEAD WHEN PEOPLE STOP READING?
                OR DO WE PUT TEXT TO REST OURSELVES
                ONCE WE STOP WRITING?

 discuss and get back to me in textfile format, please. do not blog about it.

        IN FACT, destroy your blog. tear it up.
      blogs are not hip. actually, they make you
      some sort of cyber WHORE (and i'm not to
      trying to be gender specific -- i don't care
      who you are, you shouldn't be blogging).

   oh fuck, did i just say "cyber?" is that word archiac?
 am i allowed to use it?


   IF WORDS LIKE CYBER AIN'T COOL NO MORE THAN I JUST GIVE UP.
      IF YOU CAN'T ACCEPT ME FOR WHO I AM, THEN IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

  what have we done?
