 |         the revolution will be one fueled by art and love alone,        |

Abandoned boardwalks,
4am streets that don't talk
     I don't feel anything.

Silent drives home,
God damn I am so alone
     An alienation you can't explain.

Words I try to say
Coming out in unfamiliar ways
     Just try not to think.

Persistance don't mean shit,
Might as well quit
     of failure, I am king.

       note: This poem was inspired by a photo one of my very close 
             and bestest friends, Diana Romero, shot and sent my way.
             She sent it to me in an email, simply reading "what
             loneliness feels like." I damn near cried. Because this
             poem is nothing without her photo, I have included the
             original photo as a supplement to this iR file. The URL
             to this photo is above.

             Diana has one of the greatest eyes for photography I
             know of. She has a real talent, and she truly impresses
             me. At the time of this release, I still have yet to show
             or even inform Diana of this poem. Both photo and poem are
             a good eight to nine months old.

             This is, for your information, one of the few rhyming
             poems I can stomach -- if for the only reason that Diana's
             beautiful art makes up for mine so sub-par.
