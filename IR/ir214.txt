once there was a little leaf, who fell from her tree, and landed on a grassy
lawn next to a paved walkway.  it was damp from rain and the whole place
smelled a little funny but she didnt know what of.  the next day she was
stuck somewhere and very dry, dry like the desert and hardness and wood and
warmth.  the kind of warmth that hurts.  the kind that cracks your skin.
she was stuck upside down.  she slowly was chipped away.

and she watched as it happened.  she watched how the fabric swang open and
closed.  she watched

"something is moving, under the sand," she said to me.

"like a cat under a blanket," she said to me.

"look at it ripple like water!" she said to me, pointing.

the heat does press and lift at the same time.  i looked at her hair.  hair
moves like water vertically, but not horrizontally, and hers hung down, in
strands thick with sea salt.

the ripple moved under my leg.

i lifted my hand slowly, like trying to balance an egg or a spoon.  she used
to balance books on her head.

it would take me three minutes to type how she disappeared if i moved at
this speed.  she simply was swallowed.

when i got home my mother made me iced tea and we talked about

the fires were coming closer, and they told each other how to sneak up on
the houses, and catch the onlookers and livers unaware.  the fires like to
eat.
