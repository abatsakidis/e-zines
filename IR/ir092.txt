wtf is wrong with my room?  It's never completely clean.  I dont know what 
the deal is.  I cant figure it out.  It is inevitably always going to be 
like this in some form.  My complete break from school has been spent 
cleaning it.. off and on at least.  Things like this take time and must be 
spread out.  One can not tackle such a huge project all at one time.  It 
would drive one mad methinks.

I've accepted the attitude of my room.  We understand each other.  It's 
methods I may never completely understand, but as long as we can live in 
harmony.. it's perfectly fine with me.  Right now it's pretty damn clean.  
Why do you think I was able to finally sit down and crank out some files eh? 
  hehehe.. All the clothes are hung up, laundry washed and everything, even 
changed my sheets the other day!  I cleaned out from under my bed too.  A 
couple weeks ago I rearranged my room and cleaned out my closet.  I think 
I've accomplished a lot.  And it feels pretty damn good too.  The only mess 
left is my desk.  I found a lot of potential stuff for files... so they're 
scattered about.   heheheh fear my room cleaning.  :P

My room will always look pretty 'cluttered' though.. I have a lot of 
furniture.. large furniture... my old stereo has huge 3ft tall speakers that 
I have on my desk somehow...  the main unit is under my scanner.  I have 
tons of girlie stuff like nailpolish and lotion on my desk too.  Scary no?  
My record player, geetar, bass, violin, and mandolin are by my bed near the 
other window.  A monitor and my computer case are on the floor over there 
too.  Yeah so anyway... time to move on. (:
