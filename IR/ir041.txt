This piece takes place in the middle of the woods, at a male deer bonding 
retreat. The characters and events are in no way related to actual people, 
any similarity is purely coincidental.

Charlie:   well, um uh, hi everyone, I guess I should start by telling you 
all my name. Well its Charlie, yep Charlie. Well to be totally honest I feel 
a little strange here, I mean this is my first time getting in touch with my 
inner "fawn". Anyway where to start, where to start. Ok I know my name! Well 
I didn't pick it and my mother, god rest her soul, didn't pick. Nope it was a
hunter still in a haze from his Vietnam days, who saw me yelled "There's 
Charlie" and fired on me. That how this antler was chipped. (Shows the 
crowd). Well anyway since then my friends haven't given it a rest, yo Charlie
and hey Charlie, I hate that name, but most of all I hate them. No really, if
I had a handgun and hands to go with it I'd cap them all. 'Charlie huh 
Charlie?' BANG  BANG "take that you piece of white tailed trash."
   
	 My wife, if you could even call her that, I mean we only had one 
fawn, the runt.

And I have my doubts; yeah lately this buck with really big antlers has been 
coming around to take Bambi out frolicking. Uhhh (shivers) I REALLY hate her.
She gets so damn naggy sometimes always bitching like '"you were eating 
catnip again Charlie, weren't you? That's the third time this week, and you 
always yell. And you scare Bambi" Nag, Nag, Nag. I wish that car would have 
hit her two nights ago, granted I did push her in front. The human was quick,
but on the flip she's still in shock from it. Really she hasn't said a word 
since then, and she just stares into the distance. Maybe it was the 
headlights, errrrr I don't know.

	  The youngen is ok though, him and that freak rabbit. I think you 
have all seen him around the forest, the one with the tick in his foot, 
thump, thump, thump. Yep I'd shoot him too.

	  You know life's not too bad, I am the leader, I get to rub my 
antlers on the finest trees, I GET RESPECT!!! It's good being a deer in 
America (my country ti's of thee plays), land of the free, home of the 
brave... Bob I think it's your turn. (Whimpering leaves stage)
