its fantastic, its bombastic. its the number one key to life.
its essential, its pre-menstrual. its gonna rock your world.

welcome to the wonderful world of the internet. we have hidden identities, 
we have deep dark secrets but we all share one thing in common. we are all 
addicts. stand up and say your name loud and clear for everyone to hear. 
its no shame. everyone is doing it. see the fella over there? cleaned up 
his act and 2 months later boom! he relapsed. and that girl over there with 
the long blonde hair? cute isnt she? shes battling a terribly long 
addiction. what about me? 8 years in running baby, theres no stopping me. 
no siree.

ill run around crazy, doing the whole internet shebang. its captured me. 
its wonderful. i just cant get enough of it. there are people. so many 
people. where are they from? ehat do they know?
gotta gotta chat to them, gotta understand. gotta gotta learn those nifty 
codes, the ones i dont comprehend.
but you're reading this. you know what im saying. you know i need my daily 
fix. you know i cant go clean.

i just cant seem....to.....quit.
