  "Sometimes I love you," I said to her.  Well, I didn't quite say it.  I
 thought it.  This was an important step for me.  I had resolved to be
 uncertain at all times.  After my 17 years of life, making decisions and
 sticking to them, I realized that it was time for a new direction.  I
 looked in her eyes and wondered if I should try to figure out what was on
 her mind.

  I'd always known how soft her brown eyes were, but this time I sank
 through the surface.  She once told me that she had the power to change
 men's ideas about what they want.  I didn't see this at the time.  I didn't
 see anything.  But I saw everything.  I don't know.  I spoke, not knowing
 if I expected her to understand.

  "Sometimes my thoughts become so muddled that I'm not sure that they're
 really even thoughts.  But I feel like they are."

  What was that expression on her face?  Did she understand?  I wanted to
 kiss her, but decided not to decide.  Somewhere, I knew, inside me I had a
 big pile of decisions that were probably made, at least partially.  Somehow
 I'd misplaced them.  I looked down at my hands, swearing they were three
 shades lighter than the last time I'd checked.  I imagined touching her,
 resolving never to let go.

  "Sometimes, you know, when you're gone, it's like, you know, and then when
 I see you again, it's like..."

  She smiled, taunting me.  "It's like what, B?  What's it like?"  She knew
 what it was like.  She knew what I couldn't say.  And furthermore, I knew
 she couldn't say those same things.  Deciding not to decide was my way of
 making things easier, but the practice was different from the theory.  As
 soon as I lied not to decide, I knew that I had actually decided.  Or was
 it me?

  I fought, fought hard to hold it back.  But I had to admit, at least to
 myself, that I was addicted to her.  I couldn't let her go away again.  Not
 like this.  I needed to say it.  I needed her to know as much as I needed
 to say it.

  "You know, sometimes I love you," I blurted, fighting to retain
 consciousness so as not to swoon at her feet like I always believed I
 would.

  She smiled.  "You mean sometimes as in always?" she asked.  

  I bit my lip.  Yes, as in always!  As in I've always loved you!  As in you
 are the best part of my life and I can't imagine why I thought life was ok
 20 minutes before I met you!

  I blinked, unable to say a word.

  "I thought so," she said, grinning.  Seeing her cute little dimples was
 more than enough to satisfy me.

  He was staring with a look like he was about to confess my dog had been
 run over by a car.  I felt uneasy.

  Then as his gaze drifted form the floor to my eyes, I could tell this was
 something not serious at all, but merely embarrassing...

  He mumbled something inaudible and clumsy, and I IMMEDIATELY realized this
 was about love.  For a writer he sure wasn't having a way with words.

  Then I remembered I was a girl.  The almighty woman.  The sex with power.
 The one who was known for having inexplicable control over HIM!  I composed
 myself and  let him dig himself deeper.  There was no way I would let this
 guy know I felt even an ounce for him.  Never...

  "Sometimes, you know, when you're gone, it's like, you know, and then when
 I see you again, it's like..."

  I had to smile.

  What are you SUPPOSED to do when someone is capable of saying exactly how
 you feel?

  I bit.  "It's like what, B?  What's it like?"  I had to tease him,
 couldn't let him know it was THAT easy.  He knew all about my 90% theory.
 He knew I wouldn't admit a thing.  Still, I was afraid.

  Then he admitted it...

  I dont think I rememeber the next thing I said.  It was something like,
 "You mean sometimes as always?"  Uh oh... I was letting the guard down, the
 infamous guard that had protected me from ever feeling... well, feeling
 more than I could handle.  Yet I felt like I had crossed that line
 already.

  I had to cover up any possible insecurities that were seeping through my
 hard shelled exterior, so I coyly remarked, "Thought so."  Deep inside, I
 hoped to keep him guessing.  That meant he would never grow bored, or know
 he had me in the palm of his hand.  That way I was safe, safe from totally
 looking like a fool in love.

  He would never know that side of me.

  Never.

  Yet as I looked at him, I knew he knew too much.
