How Introduction to Occupation's Class Made Me Want to Spend My Life
Doing Nothing, Rather Than Having an Actual Occupation

	Last year during scheduling time, I had to pick an elective.  
I read through my school's dreary curriculum guide for days before 
finally choosing Introduction to Occupations not only because my 
friends were taking it, but because I thought it may give me some 
insight as to what I want to do with myself in those days after high 
school.

	On the first day of school, I thought I would actually enjoy
being in that class.  The teacher seemed nice enough, there were people
in my class who'se company I enjoyed, and the content of the curriculum
seemed to be enlightening enough.  After sleeping through the first semester
of Intro, we finally got to the part that I took the class for.  We were
going to learn about careers.  We got to research any career that we
wanted to.  First reading about psychology, I decided that I didn't
want to do that.  Then I started in on education, only to come to the 
conclusion that I dislike children.  After that, I moved on to law.
This perhaps, was the "career cluster" that repulsed me the most.  As a
last ditch effort, I researched musicians, realizing the lack of future
in that field.  When it came to presentation time, I heard about every-
thing from architecture to social work to stained-glass artistry and I
found each career to be more repellant than the one I heard about
before it.  After giving my presentation on music, I came to a sort of
realization that was very painful for my parents to hear.  I didn't
want to be a musician, but I wanted to play the bass.  I didn't want to
be a lawyer, but I wanted to complain about the system.  I didn't want
to be a psychologist, but I wanted to figure out how the mind worked.
My friend put it the best when he said, "You want to be a bum."  While
that may not be entirely true, because I want to have money and a
house, it is the closest thing that I can compare what I want to do
with.  After seeing the truth, I have decided not to think about the
future at all, but instead live in the moment.  I will decide what I
want to do with myself when I get to college, or maybe I will keep this
bleak idea that my life is worth nothing and start a grunge band and
kill myself with heroin.  Who knows?  For now, all I can say is DO NOT
TAKE INTRODUCTION TO OCCUPATIONS, or any course that is essentially
the same.  Take photography instead, because pictures are cool.
