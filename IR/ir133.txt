You called to say, "We can't keep living this way."
I never cared who you were.  I never knew.
I heard the static cough, "Take me far away,
Show me something new."
My grey primer polka-dotted Civic
Slacked below the speed limit, 
Through the terrain of sand that was so nostalgic;
Through the short journey I knew would be infinite.
Approaching the horizon for the second time
Made me look over at you.
I could never tell what was on your mind,
But I suppose that was the beauty of it (and you).
We're still not there.
But after all these years, I doubt either of us really care.
