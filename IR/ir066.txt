	James was explaining to Stevie about comments. (good beginning.)
	So see, he said, see here, hey, pay attention. Yeah? OK, so look at
what's written here. It says "wider margins." What do you think that means?
Uh no, that's no good. Start over. (what is the purpose of this sentence???)
	YEAH? WELL LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING MISTER, MISTER, MISTER GIVE UP
& START OVER! What? (this is difficult to make sense of) UH YEAH WELL NEVER
MIND THEN. I can see you've been under a lot of stress lately & let's go out
for coffee some time. I don't like coffee, no free time, etc., etc.
 	HEY (why is this capitalized?) have oyu (you?) ever noticed how
people take for granted that little kids are real, real stupid? I mean like,
most folks are amazed to find out that young children actually NOTICE things.
The average age at which most people lose their virginity is 16 years and 5
months, so if you were born May 28th, 1984, TODAY IS YOUR DAY! (funny, but
what does it have to do with anything?) From his spot on the sofa he shifted,
and replied, in a disgusted sort of voice, gosh, I'm way overdue. What do you
think that means? (what is the purpose for the lack of quotation marks around
dialogue?)
	tHE NEXT DAY, SHE CAME OVER TO MY HOUSE AND WE "HUNG OUT" SO TO
SPEAK. wAIT, WHAT THE HELL AM i TALKING ABOUT? (fix that caps lock!) Uh yeah,
I know, I'm pretty darn clever (that's what SOMEBODY ELSE said, by the way!
I do not really think I am clever!) You should read WINE FOR DUMMIES sometime.
It's a classic. Hyuk hyuk.
	(good humor) HEY YOU FUCKING SLOB, WAKE THE FUCK UP! LOOK AT ME! IT'S
NOT ME YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT'S \YOURSELF\ (yeah ok i see how it is) LOOK
AT ME! LOOK AT ME WHEN I TALK TO YOU! (uh) YOU HAVE TO TALK MORE ABOUT 
YOUR/SELF/! (watch your language, mister) LET'S HAVE A DRINK SHALL WE?
	So anyway, yeah, hello? (this is unnecessary) Anyway, when Stevie and
Jamesey were children, their relationship was closer than the average
friendship between 7-year-old boys. Plus, the kids really got a kick out of
how similar their names were. They'd sing that song, you know the one,
"STEVIE AND JAMESEY SITTIN' IN A TREE, K I S S I N G," and so on. The words
sounded good to them. They got goosebumps singing that song more than once.
They didn't really hate Stevie and his friend; they just didn't understand
them. At least that's what Jamesey's therapist said, 17 years later.
	Two young, middle-class suburban teenagers met at the coffee shop to
sip iced cappucino drinks and discuss the evils of mass consumerism. I went
on POLITICALLY INCORRECT WITH BILL MAHER and talked about it. You can imagine
what happens next.
	YEAH I'D LIKE TO MAKE MY MARK ON THE WORLD I'D LIKE TO DO SOMETHING...
SOMETHIGN /SIGNIFICANT/ MAN!! THIS PLACE IS SO SMALL I=T'S LIKE THE WALLS ARE
CLOSIN' IN! HELP ME ESCAPE! THANK YOU & GOD BLESS! (check the spelling on
this paragraph.) nothing should come after that! can you see just how
REBELLIOUS I am being? I AM TOTALLY PUSHING THE ENVELOPE.
	Whenever I would voice my "opinions" (?) on the subject I would get
people saying I was brilliant. I was a revolutionary. I was the ONLY FUCKING
PERSON ON EARTH with such original, innovative ideas! I would've been
flattered if I didn't know what fucking PHONEYS they all were. Too many of 
'em, man. Too many god-damned communists in America. absolutely crazy.
	And so on.

	(Bill- good story, but the somewhat ABSTRACT (i added the capital
letters myself!) nature of it makes it somewhat difficult to understand. plus
you can't think of good character names. may i ask what it was about? was it
about how people generally believe whatever sounds good? how THE MEDIA is
destroying american culture? about how water is the only way to go in terms
of beverage choices or did you not have a specific focus? please tell me
because i am INTERESTED Bill! (is that your real name?)

	SPELL CHECKERS ARE GREAT & \*/_USE THEM!_/*\ !!!! -Rachel)
