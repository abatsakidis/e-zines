She came to thee by moonlight
Creature few think could exist.
She gave to you her embrace
You sighed and feigned a resist.

You gave up will and faded
Into a state of pure bliss,
Wanting more than gentle storms
Of her ethereal kiss.

She felt the pulse of your throat
And slowly enhaled your scent
She looked in your eyes and smiled
Then yeilded to her descent

Tender kisses on your neck
Then she whispered in your ear,
"This question you must answer:
Do you lay here without fear?"

In that moment you did give
A vow and your soul to her.
As you leaned back in the dark
You savored sweet surrender.

The heat of her bloodied kiss
Made your dizzied spirit soar
Between the realms you then stood
And whispered to the night, "More."

She pulled back to look upon
Your angelic expression.
The charm of vampiral embrace
Had become an obsession.

A moment in your shoulder
Then a flash of her blanched teeth
Her hands surveyed your body
Finding what she sought beneath

A tear in your satin shirt
As she looked upon your face
She offered her timeless kiss
To depart the human race

The ecstasy of his blood
Had brought to her a new height
She took on a companion
In lieu of a death that night
