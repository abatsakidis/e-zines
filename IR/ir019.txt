"Talk, [linear]! You never talk! You're too quiet."

"Shutup. You talk to much."

"Why don't you ever talk."

"I don't have anything to say."

"Fine. I'll do the talking."

"Okay."

"So..."

"So."

"TALK!"

"I thought you were going to talk."

"Shutup."

"Okay."

"Why don't you ever talk?"

"You told me to shutup."

"Well, now I want you to TALK!"

"I have nothing to say."

Take note of this, ladies, this is what a conversation with linear is like.
Sad isn't it?
