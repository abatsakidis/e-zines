all this bullshit
circulating
in my head
i dont feel envy
for those kids
in their Saabs
and Lexus's
drinking Red Bull
and listening to
Eminem
Nope, no envy
here
i dont like
the mall
all those people
all that capitalism
another teen angst
rant
another wasted breath
again goes unnoticed
another night alone
again goes unphased
another new problem
again goes unsolved
another gun barrel
again goes on
another note written
to the people i love
another note written
to those who caused this
another night listening
to Dashboard
i dont know
how i still live
i really dont know
how youre still here
laying next to me
get out my bed
I HATE YOU!
GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY HEAD!
another day passes
tomorrow the wiser
another flower blooms
mushroom clouds
the magical land
of happy bunnys
another hour wasted
impressionable youth
wasted time
impressionable youth
another story
another time
get out of house
this my room
another paragraph down
three more to go
another missed deadline
now means death
and i still wait
for you
another pill taken
WASTED YOUTH
IMPRESSIONABLE YOUTH
simple kids
were all the same
get out of my HEAD!
