It's funny.  Sometimes I feel I wont be here much longer.  Then I start to 
think about all the things I would be leaving behind.  I look at my room and 
see it full of things.  Then I start to wonder if maybe I should get rid of 
some stuff.  When I leave, I dont want the world to know what I was about.  
Why should I leave something behind?  Destroy everything?  No way.  I think 
I'll start cleaning some stuff up though.  Part of the cleansing process; 
might make me feel better.
