I lay upon my futon, tucked in, late at night.
I remember when you used to keep me warm
Now when I see you, I smile and mean it
And lie to you, "My heart is safe from harm."

You helped me to escape from the horror inside
But where are you when I'm alone and scream?
I reach out to you and it looks like I am just silly
Having you think I'm happy is part of my dream

Come and let us dance to a song in my head.
You are the only one that makes me want to dance. 
It does not matter where in the world we are
Call to me, and I will give you a winning chance

For how can I ever be selfish enough to say, "Stay"
When the world calls to you and you are almost free
Close your eyes, open your arms and learn to fly
I always smile around you, so you won't worry for me.
