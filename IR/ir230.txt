   When God speaks...
   maybe i have the stereo on too loud
      (i tend to zone out a lot)

   Or maybe he just mumbles a lot...
   I have awful hearing.
      probably because of that
      stereo thing i was talking about.

   It's not that i don't like you, Jesus,
   I've just been too busy to return your calls.
   you understand, right?

   Try hitting me up on my cell.
   Anyway, I'm tired. I'll talk to you later, Jesus.
