                         In conversation with random lamer964

=================================  by xade  =================================


In a conversation with random lamer964... featuring subtexts.. a whole new 
light to "reading-between-the-lines"  (:


<lamer964> so anyhow, whats new with you?
<Xade> nothing really
   --this means: leave me alone bitch i dont want to talk to you@!#
<Xade> just a new 2ft tall tower that i'm going to make into a linux box 
that's all
   --trying not to make my excitement, I know he wouldnt care anyways
<lamer964> could you tell me just what exactly a linux box is please?
   --now that's a fucking dumbass question if i've ever heard one...  I 
     nearly died over laffing!#@#@$
<lamer964> ....waiting patiently....
   --the lil fucker@!@# just want to justify ripping his face off#@$#@  So.. 
     here.. I'll put it in layman's terms for you@!#@!$#@
<Xade> tower=thingie your COMPUTER IS IN.. computer is like your CPU (CENTRAL
PROCESSING UNIT) and your vid card your hd's and floppy, cdrom, other random 
devices, cooling unit.. the like... and like.. a box... is another WORD for a
COM-PU-TER... yeah.. and LINUX is an OS (OP-ER-ATING SYS-TEM)....
   --hahah i'm so sarcastic, it just kills me@!# (:  
<lamer964> why do you want to run linux again?
<lamer964> ....waiting patiently once again.....
   --he's so fucking stupid he had to waste my time by asking again@!#  Note
     to readers: Dont ask stupid question TWICE!@#@# (:  I didnt really feel
     like wasting my precious time by trying explain to him... but he was so
     persistent@!# nudnik grrr
<Xade> must i explain that?
<lamer964> well yes
<Xade> i dont think you'd understand
<lamer964> a brief explination would suffice
    --dumbass@!# like you'd even fucking care@!# you're just wanting to sit
      there and bug the hell out of me aren't you@$##@$#@$%
<lamer964> oh is that right?
<lamer964> why dont you try me?
   --yeah i'll try you#@$ Just let me shove this up your ass@!#
<Xade> COMPUTERS ARE FUN
<Xade> I LIKE COMPUTERS
<lamer964> but why linux? it sucks!
   --you little bitch@!#!#@  going to ignore it so i wont have to get super
     pissed off...
<Xade> I LIKE TO ANALYZE 
<lamer964> its hard to use and program in
<lamer964> windows NT kicks its ass
   --That's it!#@ May you be smitten to hell and never see the break of day
     again#@!@!#
<Xade> W/ LINUX I CAN MAKE MY OWN SHIT
   --still ignoring his phuqed up opinion..
<lamer964> the only thing linux is really used for is servers
<lamer964> and I doubt you are going to link your comp to the net as a server
<Xade> i dont like to argue, you know that
   --in other words:  leave me the hell alone you sorry ass bitch@#$  Must I
     keep wasting my time with futile attempts to show you something?
<lamer964> im not arguing
<lamer964> i just want you to explain yourself
<Xade> i dont have to explain myself to you, you're not accountable of my 
actions
<lamer964> chill chill
<Xade> well you've been anal all day
<lamer964> i'm not being anal, i was just curious
<lamer964> so ANYWAY
<lamer964> are you ready for that big test in history class?
<Xade> no, i say fuck it
<lamer964> (tries to revive a dying conversation)
<lamer964> well why dont you tell us how you really feel
<lamer964> wow, are you having a rough night?
   --boy this one's clueless, you're the bitch here asswipe!@#
<Xade> i feel like a summer flower blowing in the wind.. beaten by the rain,
plucked by a careless child, withered and dying slowly
<lamer964> and why do you feel like that?
<Xade> fuck off bitch you're not my shrink
<lamer964> yikes
<lamer964> you know, you're a confusing girl
<Xade> yeah i tend to confoose my self a lot
<lamer964> im still kinda wondering about that summer flower thing
<Xade> i was talking some random bullshit, fucker
<lamer964> yeah, thats pretty much what I figured
   --then why the hell did he even have to ask@#!?@#@  grrrrr stupid
     assface!@$#
<Xade> /me was being sarcastic
   --he's such a dumbass@!#

okie so now the bitch thinks win9x is its OWN OS... boy will this fucker be
surprised.. I keep telling him, and he keeps arguing... the stupid bitch, why
did he have to waste my time?@!#  hehehe (:

<lamer964> hey, have you ever played Myst?
<Xade> no i havent
<Xade> puter to slow
<lamer964> I played it sunday, I think you would really enjoy it
<Xade> yeah i've heard it's cool
   --in other words: this means shut the fuck up (:
<lamer964> its logic pretty much
<lamer964> i mean, you have to find the problem, find the solution, and find
out how it all relates together in the end
<lamer964> you basically figure out everything as you go, no instructions,
no starting goal, nothing
<Xade> ah cool, sounds like fun
<Xade> i'll let you know when i get a fast puter...
   --what else do i have to tell him to make him leave me alone?
<lamer964> its just like "here you are, see you at the end of the game"
<Xade> one that runs *ahem* 'windows'
   --i mentioned windows here because of the earlier linux-bashing he did
     earlier :/ 
<lamer964> ok, I burned a copy of it from [this other annoying guy] and 
played it from start to finish sunday night
<Xade> a fast version of windows
<lamer964> it was greatness
<Xade> yeah cool
<lamer964> windows 2000
<Xade> oh yeah, i forgot... IT'S LIKE THE BEST OS EVER@!$#
<Xade> even though it's not an os
<Xade> hahaha
<lamer964> windows?
<Xade> yeah it's not an OS, but it's advertised that way
<lamer964> so if its not an OS, what is it?
<Xade> it's a GUI
<lamer964> graphical user interface, eh? so what is the OS running it?
   --this guy is such a fucking lamer it makes me sick ):
<Xade> and what the hell is DOS, do you wonder
   --he's such a fucker#@Q$%$#
<lamer964> ah, that is where you are mistaken i believe
   --he's so full of doubt "i believe" what an ass *\/*
<lamer964> our friend windows 3.1 was just a GUI, a shell if you will
<lamer964> running from dos
<lamer964> BUT
<lamer964> i am almost certain that windows 9X is the actual OS for the 
system, and dos is a shell within windows
   --OMG@Q##@$ this is so fucking hilarious@#!   DOS a shell <within> 
     windows@#@!# what a dumbass@!##$W%
<lamer964> correct me if im wrong
<lamer964> but thats how i thought it wsa
   --he's trying to sound so ejeet :þ
<lamer964> ....waiting for her well thought out reply....
<Xade> dont fuck with me tuff guy. you're wrong. windows 9x is just a graphic
shell--example explorer.exe... try double clicking on it
  --tomgavin says so@!#$@%# he owns j00 fuckboy@!#
<lamer964> i know that explorer.exe is the actual GUI, but I think that the 
entire windows package is the OS. I mean the OS and the GUI are combined as 
one.
  --he might as well dig his own grave and jump in
<lamer964> but again, I guess i could be wrong
<lamer964> cause if you'll notice, if you choose to start your computer in
"MS-DOS mode", windows will load up, and then you will get the dos screen
<lamer964> i dunno, its been too long since I've messed with this kind of 
stuff anyway
<lamer964> i probably dont know what im talking about
<Xade> no you dont
<Xade> you have no fucking clue :P
<lamer964> no need to be mean
<Xade> i'm not being mean, sometimes i like to state the obvious
<lamer964> well, if I stated the obvious all the time you'd think i was being
mean


yes he is an official fuxor asshole grrr :þ
