	Today we had a debate in my English class about censorship. And it 
was a rather fun debate since I feel so strongly against censorship. Anyway,
I got bored in Metal Shop and, remembering the day's earlier events, started
writing a silly poem. So here it is...

*    *    *    *

Let's ban music my kids shouldn't hear
Let's stop showing films, whos content I fear
A Tipper-sticker on every record,
A V-Chip in every TV
Let's water down ALL art, and smash creativity!

I know what's out there -
I seen it when I was young
But my kids shouldn't experience that,
Not MY kids having fun

Free speech can be offensive
Free thought outright alarming
Don't get me wrong - my intentions are good
It's the CHILDREN we are harming!


So think the way we want you to,
And watch just what you say
Cleanse your mind, buckle under
and our kids will be okay!

And now the lesson here is learned -
I'll censor you,
You'll censor me,
And soon we've censored everybody!
