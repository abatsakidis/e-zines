	Ok, so I'm on IRC the other day, right? Anyways, I'm sitting
there and someone who happened to be white goes "I'm watching BET".

	For some reason, that just really pissed me off to no end, for 
probably the simple fact she was trying to "impress" somebody by this. Let me
clarify...

	Yeah, I'm one of those "wegros" (yeah, wegro, not w(hite n)igger).
I like to listen to rap, I even watch BET myself, but the thing I DO NOT
do is make it ubundantly clear that I'm 'trying' to be in the black culture.
That's right, the black CULTURE, not trying to be like a black PERSON.

	That's another thing that gets me going. People (white, black, asian,
whatever) in general say so and so are "acting black". What is exactly IS
acting black? So you mean I could walk up to a 60 year old black ladies house
and find she's listening to Ludacris and has an "iced out Caddy" in her
garage...yeah...just like you could walk into a white person's house and 
find...

	Back to where I started from. I have no problem with white people
trying to be in the black culture, but do you have to wear a big sign saying

	I BE COO! I WEAR MY FUBU! I BE N' A GANG! I LIVE IN DA HOOD!

	Most people who do this to 'show' black people that they're:

	1. Not racist.
	2. Are "cool" enough to hang out with them.

	Ok, let's examine...So you're practically pointing out that you
racially stereotype and that you are recognizing that they are black and are
changing who you are because of it. Oh please, how pathetic is that.

	Yeah, there's some black people that hate Ludacris, not because
he's "betrayed his people" but for WHO HE IS. Some people don't go up to
another black person and go "What up nigga?". Most black people find that
insulting no matter what color you are, so what does that tell you? E

	So, the moral of this story is:

	Everyone is different. Realize this, and when you do you will stop
trying to be like "everyone else" and be yourself. After all, if you can't be
yourself, how could you be like "everyone else"?
