Fantasies can manifest themselves, you know.
   Please give in to yours.
Being fearful of potential mistakes is natural.
But isn't denying yourself of what you want a mistake?
   Or is it that you just don't know what you want?
      Are you lost?
      Me too.
It seems the only thing I know how to be these days is lost.
Lost and alone. And not the blissfull solitude alone,
   but the loneliness alone.
   A loneliness I know all too well.
