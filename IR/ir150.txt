VEGAN LOVE SONG
---------------
No chicken,
Beef,
Or bacon!                (Side comment: you have to pronounce bacon)
'Cause she's a Vegan!    (And/or vegan weird to get it to rhyme    )

No butter,
Milk,
or cream!
She just drinks SoyDream

Chorus:
It's a vegan love song!
It can't do no wrong!
It's a vegan love song!
The animals can sing along!

She just eats
Beans
And rice!
(Not too much spice)

Yeah,
Fruits
And vegetables!
She's so kind to animals!

Chorus:
It's a vegan love song!
The verses aren't long.
It's a vegan love song!
The animals can sing along!

And she hates
Proctor
& Gamble
('Cause they test on animals)

She won't wear
Wool
Or leather,
Regardless of the weather

Chorus:
It's a vegan love song!
It can't do no wrong!
It's a vegan love song!
The animals can sing along!

But she don't love me!
She's too busy
Protesting
Animal testing!
Animal testing!

Chorus:
It's a vegan love song!
It can't do no wrong!
It's a vegan love song!
The animals can sing along!
