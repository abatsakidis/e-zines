	My plan was to force myself into insomnia. All my favorite anti-
heroes possessed disabilities, and I was jealous. Insomnia sounded good. 

	Complete lack of sleep would help me in every aspect of my life. I 
was a good 40 pounds underweight. If I stayed awake, I could eat more. 
Insomnia would be my weight gain formula. Creatively, I was running dry. If 
I didn't sleep, I'd have more time to write, along with very surreal and 
abstract thoughts as a result of existing in a constantly awaken haze. 
Insomnia would be my aesthetic. I was depressed. Most people sleep a lot
when they're depressed. They wake up, they find they're depressed, they go 
back to sleep to forget their problems. Their problems don't go away. There 
they are again when they wake up. I figured if I failed to sleep for a few 
nights, I would get all my thoughts out, and by purging my thoughts, I would
drain away all depression. Insomnia would be my Prozac.

	In a sense, I would be driving myself to insanity. Intentionally. I 
figured it would be a good experience for me. All this would be accomplished.
I'd be free. And all without the aid of any drugs. Neat. I wanted to be
insane, but only temporarily. Once the novelty of instability wore off, I 
could always just go back to sleep. Everything would be better.

	Insomnia would be my suicide. If only temporary.

	It was a brilliant plan, and no one appreciated it. Only I saw the 
beauty. Life's like that sometimes, I suppose. I smiled to myself as I 
acknowledged the fact that this was the beginning of my self-induced 
destruction. Hooray.

	So, basically, what happened was I fell asleep.
