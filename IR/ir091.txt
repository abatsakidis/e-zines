i hate painting at school.  It sucks complete ass.  And when i say 'complete 
ass' i mean the whole ass.  Like 'suck ass' like the epitome of ass sucking. 
  yeah, anyway.  Painting at home in the privacy of your garage can be one 
of the most rewarding times.  You're out there with your brushes.. the whole 
place reeks of paint thinner.. but that's okie.. cuz you're having fun!!  
But... when you paint at school in art class.. it takes on a whole new 
meaning void of fun.  All of a sudden you have to not take your time.  You 
have to 'match the freakin colours' and make it look 'real.'  What if you're 
not comfortable painting pretty trees and silly clouds?  Can technique 
really be forced?   Why not let the student discover her own technique and 
style.  Why force something upon her.  She will only loathe it more.  All is 
well though.  No more art classes.. I hate doing art stuff for a grade.  How 
could the teacher ever see the meaning?  Oh yeah.. sure.. they have a 
freakin art degree.. which means shit... so they've studied other people's 
art and art history.  But does that mean they can be all omniscient and know 
what the hell you're trying say.. if you're trying to say anything at all. 
bah.. oh well.. only 3 more weeks of the class. (:
