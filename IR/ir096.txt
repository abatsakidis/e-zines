	Young lips bleed glossy pale-pink cries, yet no one hears her 
whispering sobs.  A vintage lavender skirt wraps her cheap discontentment 
up like a wire ribbon around a broken gift.  Reluctantly, she shuts her 
blood-shot eyes and is blinded by the memories that invade her feeble mind. 
Taking in the stolen past of grins and giggles, she holds fast to it.  She 
scrubs at her pain, but soap suds and disinfectant never could wash away the 
tears like her first love.   

	Bruised sweater buttons and ribs, all purple and sore, break under 
the heavy void, giving way to a new piercing penetration.  Too weak to see 
straight, she tries to amputate her soul, in hopes it will get rid of some of
the dead weight (but it doesn't).  She tucks away her once happy smile that 
cut through her face.  Now she paints the silence with cherry-chapstick, 
thinking that nobody will notice (but they do, they all do).  Desperately she
chases after empty pleasure, finding nothing more than downcast glares upon 
her thoughtless head.  She envelops herself inside herself, never letting 
anyone see more than skin deep. 

				She is alone. 

	Then hope comes, in the form of another.  He knows he could love her 
(and she does too).  He warms her.  She finds safety in his arms.  Together 
they teach each other.  They grow.  The search is over, what she was trying 
to find all along, has found her.  She feels he is the only thing that fills 
her up, makes her whole... and maybe because she knows it is mutual is the 
reason why she loves him more and more with each slow passing day... 

	For the first time she utters, "I love you," and comprehends the 
depth of it all.
