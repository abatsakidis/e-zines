Little Suzie had always been terrified of school buses.  The first
day she had ever gone to school, her mother took her early so they
could meet her teachers.  Her mother kept telling her how exciting
school was going to be.  She also told little Suzie she would get to
ride the school bus home.  Little Suzie had never seen a school bus
so how would she have known to get home?  After an *exciting* first
day of kindergarten, little Suzie followed all the other kids out to
the front of the school.  There she saw huge, long yellow motorvehicles.
She assumed they were school buses.  As soon as she went near one, the
driver started the engine--it growled at her.  She screamed and ran back
inside the school.  There she stood behind the glass doors, adn there
she stood until her mother came and got her.

This happened every day for a whole year until little Suzie's mother
finally decided to take her to a doctor.  The doctor analyzed little
Suzie and found that she had a phobia of school buses.  He gave her some
Prozac and sent little Suzie on her way.  A week on Prozac adn little
Suzie started to feel a little better.  One day little Suzie felt brave
and actually got on the bus.  She wanted to go home--on her own.  Little
Suzie's teacher saw her and phoned the girl's mother to inform her of her
daughter's brave feat.  Little Suzie just happened to get on the bus the
wrong day.

Little Suzie sat down on the first seat--closest to the driver, the door,
and the motor.  When she looked up, she could see all the kids on the bus
in the driver's mirror.  As the bus took the turns, it growled even louder 
due acceleration.  She could feel the heat.  The motor was a loud roar over
the noise of chatter and laughter.  Looking out the windows, she could see
people, cars and trees fly by in the opposite direction.  Objects became
smaller the farther she got from them.  The door took her attention.  She
couls see the pavement flowing through her vision.  The swinging door was
not fully closed.  Past the steep steps she could see the road so clear
she could almost touch it.  For soem reason her concentration broke from
the door.  She was now looking out the front window.  The driver was at
an intersection making a left-hand turn.  Little Suzie could see it
happening... she saw this huge diesel F450 truck thing come speeding into
them.  She leaned out of her seat closer to the swinging door. And in a 
flash of light, the truck hit them head-on into the front right side of 
the bus--little Suzie was thrust forward out of the aisle down the steep 
stairs--closer to the door. First there was the crushing of metal and the
smell of burnt rubber.  Then there was the piercing screams of children
growing fainter.  The bus had slid about 10feet out of its path.  The 
truck was going pretty fast--and this was proven as well; the side of
the bus looked like something you'd find in the scrap heap.  Three 
people died in the collision--both drivers and one child.
