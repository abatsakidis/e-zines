-What can I say? I'm a fool like that. What can I say? I have a Gumpy for a 
cat. What can I say? It's all I can do. What can I say? Hurry, quick before 
that man turns blue. What can I say? Go somewhere else to blow your horn. 
What can I say? I just told you that, I coulda sworn. What can I say? Do I 
care what you think. What can I say? Better get out before you sink. What can
I say? All you do is spit. What can I say? Back up, you might get bit. What 
can I say? You're hair is green. What can I say? I believe in something my 
eyes unseen. What can I say? That's not what I told you so. What can I say? 
You surely just stubbed your toe. What can I say? No care in the world. What
can I say? 'Round you the dancers twirled. What can I say? Nothing too much.
What can I say? Isn't that such'n such? What can I say? I don't do that 
stuff. What can I say? Have you had enough? What can I say? You're already in
the red. What can I say? 10 bucks says you're dead. What can I say? Besides 
the obvious fact. What can I say? Duck before you get whacked. What can I 
say? How should you know? What can I say? Don't hide but keep low.

What can I say? Do you think at all? What can I say? Quick, pass the ball. 
What can I say? The gas you better push. What can I say? It landed 'oer in 
the leafy bush. What can I say? Sit out on the deck. What can I say? Your 
sis was in a wreck. What can I say? Don't you have a clue? What can I say? 
He's my love, too. What can I say? Keep it in a box. What can I say? Don't 
stone it with rocks. What can I say? There's a nail on that board. What can 
I say? The tongue is like a sword. What can I say? I'll never forget that 
night. What can I say? Come on and hold me tight. What can I say? Just don't 
let go. What can I say? It never goes too slow. What can I say? Only one life
to live now. What can I say? You don't know how. What can I say? Oh, how fun.
What can I say? Thanks a ton. What can I say? Give all you can. What can I 
say? Through those woods she ran. What can I say? I don't eat meat. What can
I say? Just have a seat. What can I say? I never knew you could. What can I 
say? Why don't you burn the wood. What can I say? I knew you did all along. 
What can I say? Yeah...he did me wrong. What can I say? All that you love is
true. What can I say? Wait up for me, too.
