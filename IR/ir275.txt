 cracked tiles
 faked smiles
 mundane meals
 no sleep.
 we're hanging ourselves
  with our own insecurities,
 paralyzed by our limitations
 jobs we hate
 relationships we fake
 deep alienation
 slit veins
 our palaces of heartbreak
 are ruins of insignificance
 built to crumble, crumbled to love
  long nights
  hindsight
  mind sight
      no sleep
      no motivation
  A few hundred minds
 and none of us know how to be free
    love bleeds
    so does pain.
 bus stops,
 run-aways,
 and highway strips
 and every direction
 flooded out by
 our uncertainty
  Why sleep?
 The path of the sage
 it was paved over
 by Wal-Mart parking lots.
 how hard it seems,
 classes we ignore
 responsibilities we shun
 let's not talk about this
   broken form
   broken happiness
 the enlightenment
 of discontentment
        no thought

 one more day
     (and i leave).
