You and your illusions far from reality:
You run way and then call to me.
When will you get over you love self esteem?
Only then you'll realize and live the dream.
And yet you'll go pack your bag,
Into the dark yourself you'll drag...
Away from here and true friends,
Inside hoping the sorrow and pain ends.
Why do you leave hearts and roots behind,
Thinking that is lost, you'll soon find?
So I took to the shattered glass at my feet,
Then cleaning quiet and discreet.
Blood unnoticed flows down finger tips,
Until on the crimson pool, someone slips.
You really thought you would be better:
Never believing you'd regret her.
So held breath, you come to me and confess...
Asking for relief from your distress.
But now it is I, who castles the king;
From the shadows into light is everything.
Strange you think, stranger and leave.
You back and deny what you believe.
Farewell I call, a whispered adieu,
In your mind, I regret you.
Get over you self esteem.
Wake up and live your dream.
Perhaps far and farther from me,
You will step into true reality.
Curious now as you age,
What would happen if you turn the page?
All that's left I offer you
A friendship and a word, "Adieu."
