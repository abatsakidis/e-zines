The freak

I'm the freak of the nation we all know it’s true
As I walk through the halls have unwanted
Seeing all the eyes that cross over my head to my toe
Looking thinking about everything that’s on me that they can see
But what they don't know is that they are the same
Was all the same no one any different?
All trapped in the matrix
Slaving for those that make us do as they say
Some care but most don’t I get used to it
We all get used to it
The "wonderful world" has never come to see me and never will
I know that for sure and everyone that looks at me sees
It within me
So they give us a name the name hurts in some ways but in others
Feels like it should be there like it means me
The thing im known for the thing everyone excepts me
As "THE FREAK"
I will live up to their words now and soon will not exists
So then everyone will be happy and I will live
In the depths of a hole with nothing
But my few friends
