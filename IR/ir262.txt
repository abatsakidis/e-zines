i don't feel anything
but i'm conscious of it all
no mixed emotions,
yes, nixed emotions
wake up early 
 because we're better than sleep
  and better than exhaustion
   but more so, better than everything.
better because we're weak
         because we're tired
           because we're so fucking disillusioned.
or because we're so god damn stupid
that we take our escapist dreams and fantasies
too seriously, willing to defend their reality
  with everything our smoke-damaged hearts can bare.
our discontentment with existence in the mundane
runs so deep that we have to bleed hope out of anything
and force a willful suspension of disbelief
in that we can overcome it.
