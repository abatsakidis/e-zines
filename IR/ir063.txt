When your day starts off kinda weird, all you _can_ do is laugh at it.  
That's what I do.  It's just funny how so many things can go weird in one 
day.  Sure you're stuck between a rock and a hard place, but you'll get out 
of it soon enough!  It'll all be over by tomorrow! Read as comical relief.  
If I can laugh at my own day, so can you!! (:


Ever had one of those days?
When you get to school late
Your painting you were so excited about
Completely sucks ass
Your teacher thinks it's too hard for you now
And you have to pick something else
And come back to that one later
When you learn how to paint

Ever had one of those days?
When you moved to another seat
And the people you were formerly sitting with
Bitch about your moving
And you wonder why they even made a fuss
Because it makes no difference anyway
The person you came to talk to wasnt even there
The teacher gives homework as you leave

Ever had one of those days?
When a couple silly guys
Ask if you're coming to the Improv Show
You tell them probably not--and maybe not the drama party either
Then they 'act' offended (damn thespians...wait i'm one...)
Like it would really make a difference
If you were there or not
They will still be the same without you--funny and arrogant

Ever had one of those days?
When you get to class and sit down
Find out there's a test tomorrow
Over some easy circuit stuff
You shrug it off and then look up
To see the teacher showing you something evil that will be on the test
You sigh and work it out
But take the big ass book home anyway

Ever had one of those days?
When so much has been on your mind all day
That your expressionless face
Makes other people think you're 'pissy'
And they feel compelled to ask
"Is there something wrong?"
But there's no way you can give them a great answer in 2 minutes
Without completely explaining it all

Ever had one of those days?
When you were supposed to meet a friend in the library
But the library is closed for some stupid reason
So you crash down for lunch
And you hit your head as you lay it down on the table
Then you groan and cry out
"I'm so sick of high school crap--
I can't wait to get out of here!"

Ever had one of those days?
When you walk around looking for
The guy that hates the world
So you can both sulk together
Yet your attempts were in vain because you never found him
But while you were out
Someone from the table was looking for you
Funny--no one ever seeks you out

Ever had one of those days?
When finally a headache forms
Then everybody is loud all of a sudden
No one will shut up
You get to your last class
Eat all your munchies
Then get really sleepy
During the physics lecture

Ever had one of those days?
When your lab write-up is due the next
And you haven't even started
But all you need to know is how to find one little thing
The one key to it all and you have to wait
Until the last 15 minutes of class
While all the kids are being loud
And keep asking the same damn questions

Ever had one of those days?
When you get on the bus
And some one else is in your regular spot
So you sit down in another
Next thing you know you're thinking about your day
And someone sits down in your seat beside you
So you're smashed against the window
Trying to finish your text

Ever had one of those days?
When you get home
And your sister asks "what's wrong with you?"
And you tell her "nothing"
Like she could really care anyway
It's not like it affects her at all
So you trudge back to your room
And get over it--the night has now begun
