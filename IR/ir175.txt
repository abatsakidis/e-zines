"The Lady and the Sage"
written by Grey Frequency

The sun before it's final bend,
summons the moon to ever defend. 
Moonlight now shy
glides in the sky
touching the oceans and ground
enjoying dance and nights sound.
Kept silent is the secret:
the woods of hope and regret.
Away from sun and blazing fire
it mutes any dark desire.
Where the child she doth sleep,
and other wonders keep.
North she cannot encumber
lost within her slumber.
Silken cloth of grey
cover where she lay
amidst the fallen leaves.
No one believes
she barely does stir
from her haven under
the old oak tree
of prosperity.

     The wind, it blows to she
     smells of salt and sweetened sea.
     Always does it dream of this:
     to whisper to her a kiss. 
     As it blew
     it danced through
     her lengthened hair
     and thrice round there.
     Created protectively
     an orb to ever be
     securely sealed
     like a hidden shield.
     She need not worry,
     safe she will be.
     No matter how fierce
     only the wise may pierce
     without demand
     the walls of hallowed land.

Many a year hath past,
since human eyes on her cast.
Then grey moves
and slowly smoothes
out the sorrows and fear.
Someone now draws near.
The Sage and the vice
bring forth his sacrifice.
He, with staff at his side, 
knows not the rules to abide.
He enters the circle round,
and fatigue draws him to the ground.
His eyes heavy
how can this be:
to look upon a face
he knows yet cannot place.

     Then passed a century
     she dreamt next to he.
     Turn and look in the eye
     each where they did lie.
     It did not matter to feel
     because all was too surreal.
     Although loved they could see
     as children they should always be.
     'Tis then the message came
     And brought with it rain.
     Trading a piece of heart,
     The sage again must depart.
     As always he did say
     Lady as you are; Stay.
