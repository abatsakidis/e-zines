             My dislike concerning those ill-fated 'busy signals'

=================================  by Xade  =================================


Written by Xade - 14JUL99 


My ISP: ******** 
Amount of time 'busy': 24hrs...so far 
# hours I've spent dialing: 9; first 6 consecutively last night 
# times I've dialed: at least 2700 
P,O.'d level: 100% 
amount of caffiene had: 5 sodas and a cappuccino 
contact with outside world: barely 

Note: I shall begin this account not with yesterday, but with the previous
before yesterday. For this is when the trouble began. 

Day 1: Mon. 12JUL99 
Mother dragged my lazy butt out of bed at the crack of noon. I showered and
readied myself to journey with her. Our first stop was the local Xmart to 
pick up some pictures we'd dropped off the previous week. I ran into several
people I know. The neighbors from down the street, a girl who will be a 
freshman next year at my school, and one of my friends I had not seen since 
school let out.  A brief stop at Taco Bell to pick up lunch, a couple of bean
burritos for myself(they have no meat). ((you're probably wondering the 
relevance of this story...i rarely get out much...therefore, i must tell of 
my outings...)) Then we took in my mother's car to be serviced. With that 
done we went to the Mall. I only needed a book for school (4 weeks left and I
'm just now getting a book on the summer reading list..tsk, tsk..)) but we 
ended up with about 30 bones worth of merch. Including a nice black, 
hardcover sketchbook for myself. :O) Lo and behold, just as we exit, 2 
friends of mine I'd not seen in months spotted me as they exited the 
escalator. As my mother entered a shoe store nearby, I told her I'd talk to 
them for a bit. Mike and Toph. I'd last seen MIke at the Embodyment CD 
release party at tha Club a month before. I'd last seen Toph at the RFL 
Benefit (same place) back in February.  (Sweet Mother of Bob! It has been 
that long!!) Toph's hair is longer than I saw it last and Mike's was a 
different colour. They told me how they ran into the bassist of Deftones and
this other dude. And how the two guys bought them lunch. The boys were pretty
stoked on that. We 3 sat on a mall bench, reminincing (looks like i spelled
that one wrong..) the past times of when we all went to the same church, but
oh! how the youth group has changed there! None of us still go. We all agreed
that we should hopefully see each other at the Zao show on the 18th. The boys
left after I gave them 'sufficient, good' hugs to send them on their way. My
mother soon came out of the shoe store 10min later. 

Around 7pm we got home. I was incredibly tired. But I wanted so much so to 
get online. So ON my puter came. It connected time after time. But there was
a problem. A very bad problem. The browser would not take me anywhere. AIM 
would not connect with the server. ICQ couln't connect. Nothing was working.
I would close and reopen the browser, but to no avail....nothing!!! NOTHING!
None worked. I tried connecting on my father's puter. Same results. I tried
until I gave up around midnight. 

Day 2: Tues. 13JUL99 
I heard a beating on my door which gradually became louder as I began to 
waken. Glancing over at the clock, I noticed it to be around 9:30am. The 
beating was made by my younger brother. I asked him what he wanted. He 
informed me I had a phone call. That Emily (the lady I babysit for) wanted me
to babysit. He handed me the phone. Which I turned on and answered. She 
wanted me by 10:15 (45 minutes). Afterwards, I rebuked my brother for having
her wait so long and not having made himself more clear when he was waking me
up. I decided to see if the computer would decide to let me check my email. 
It did. The browser worked wonderfully. AIM came on, as well as ICQ. It was a
miracle that only lasted 10min. before I had to shower. (Oh how I wish my 
puter were doing the same at this very moment!) Upon return to my home at 2pm
from down the street, my mother was in a hurry to get to the library, I 
returned a book, The Joy of Pi (a good one I might add), renued 3, and 
checked out another. I begged my mother to drop me back off at the house 
before she did anything else. She would not comply. (Oh! How exhausted I 
was!) We drove all the way to the 'Boy Scout Store', for my brother needed
some more stuff before he goes to camp next week. I walked in, took a cirle 
of disinterest and walked out. I entered a Gem and Rock store in the same 
shopping center. I walked around and took in the beauty found in each stone.
Ending up, I purchased a pewter frog pendant holding a sphere of baby blue 
(glass or gem, I'm not for sure). After a few more stops, we were on our way.

5:30pm, we reach home. I enter in my room, eager to turn on the puter (since
it was working that morning). I encountered the first of its kind. The busy
signal. I shrugged it off the first 2 or 3 times it dialed. Then I started 
to get serious as it reached the 5th dial. After an hour of continuous 
dialing, I asked my dad as to what could possibly be the problem. He said 
that whenever something big happens in the news, that the internet would be 
busy. My brother told me how they had caught some guy. "That's it," my dad 
said. "Great," I thought, "just great." So I finished one book and started 
up to finish another as the dialer continued to dial up until midnight last 
night. Still no breaks. I went to sleep uncomfortable and dissatisfied. "Why
would the puter still be busy up until midnight?" I wondered to myself. 

Day 3: Wed. 14JUL99 
Attitude this morning: "Yay! maybe the puter isn't busy!! Weee!" 
Attitude now: "Stupid ISP! Why is it still busy at 6pm!!!" 
Yes, I awoke this morning eager to connect. Not surprisingly, it didn't. And
it still won't.
