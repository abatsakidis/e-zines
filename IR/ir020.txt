Alrightie.. This is a log to a conversation I had with my best bud Tye.
She can be weird at times...   In this particular case, I had to leave the
room for some reason.. and she kept rattling on... :P  Enjoy...

-------------------------------------------------------------
<Tye> are you going to go out right now and get MxPx? 
<Tye> because you should 
<Tye> you will be back in a bit because it doesn't take long 
<Tye> because MxPx writes really cool songs 
<Tye> and they dont smoke bongs 
<Tye> and they all wear thongs 
<Xade> shut up, damn i said i had to go 
<Tye> and they love their moms 
<Tye> go then i'm oging to keep making cool rhymes 
<Tye> because i have the time 
<Tye> and i dont know where to draw the line 
<Tye> because Mike from MxPx is so fine 
<Tye> and i want him to be mine 
<Tye> and drink pickle juice and brine 
<Tye> and be happy people that shine 
<Tye> it's just too much for me 
<Tye> the way mxpx makes me scream with glee 
<Tye> kinda like i have to pee 
<Tye> they make me blind so i can't see 
<Tye> and want to climb around like a monk-ey 
<Tye> and oh oh and ah ah till i can't breathe 
<Tye> and mrs roland taught world stud-ies 
<Tye> MxPx is from cal-i 
<Tye> and they have butts that are sex-y 
<Tye> i want to pinch them till they scream 
<Tye> but please don't think i'm mean 
<Tye> because i am fit and lean 
<Tye> like a sexy piece of mixpix meat 
<Tye> they dont' sound like goats that bleat 
<Tye> and their guitar riffs are so neat 
<Tye> because they wrote a song for me 
<Tye> it's called [Tye Me Down] don't you know 
<Tye> and they play it at thier shows 
<Tye> on the grass someone must mow 
<Tye> and their bass is really low 
<Tye> but they don't play in the snow 
<Tye> because that would really blow 
<Tye> sometimes they go and go 
<Tye> i like them because they believe in God 
<Tye> on their cds no one should trod 
<Tye> and their style is really mod 
<Tye> when i listen to them i like to nod 
<Tye> green day has a song called FOD 
<Tye> but that is not important 
<Tye> because only MxPx is rel-a-vant 
<Tye> not much else rhymes with that 
<Tye> they have a song about a Cat 
<Tye> one of their members is not named matt 
<Tye> and none of them are very fat 
<Tye> but they are all mad phat 
<Tye> and are much smoother than Shaft 
<Tye> and taste better than Kraft 
<Tye> my fingers always snap 
<Tye> when i listen to their music that isn't crap 
<Tye> it makes me not want to nap 
<Tye> or not even bust a cap 
<Tye> sometimes their flub tends to flap 
<Tye> because  they are punk boys with no muscle fat 
<Tye> but that doesnt' deter me from their sexiness 
<Tye> which is way better than plexi-glass 
<Tye> and not much else rhymes with those words 
<Tye> their music is better than turds 
<Tye> better than milk with lots of curds 
<Tye> i listen to them because i am a nerd 
<Tye> they do not play them on the Merge 
<Tye> because that station will not splurge 
<Tye> i'm running out of rhyming stuff 
<Tye> you had better put me in handcuffs 
<Tye> because my brain is full of fluff 
<Tye> from too much mxpx or maybe not enough 
<Tye> thank you, i'm [Tye Died] ... i'll be here all week 
-----------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>>> Crikey!  What a rhyme!! <<<<<<<<<
