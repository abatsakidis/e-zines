it's 3 a.m. and I'm still awake,
 and I guess you don't know how much I ache,
 These days go by rather quickly
 and I guess this bottle does, too.
 
 Can't really say I've seen that much good,
 But I can't really say I've seen much bad,
 and I haven't lived up to what I should,
 I really can't stay mad...
 
 But I guess, You could say,
 With every passin' day,
 All I am is a sinner.
 and as I eat this TV dinner,
 I realize that everything is a lie,
 but it really doesn't matter
 
 'cause
 
 With every day, there's another cigarette,
 With every week, there's another joint
 With every month, there's another huff
 With every year, another reason for my depression.
 
 I just can't stand it,
 Someone call an ambulance,
 my veins are burning...
