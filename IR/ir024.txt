[linear]

Most haikus don't ryhme
and like, like this one doesn't
because it is dumb

* * *

nawleed is an ass
he laughs at retarded kids
and pushes them down.

* * *

This is really dumb
Impulse Reality sucks
God, I hate myself.

* * *

"Let's have sex," I say
But I am shot down, she says
"Sorry, I am gay."

* * *

My ex is a bitch
it's like, stop calling, dammit!
I don't want to talk

* * *

My penis is hard
Ha ha ha, that is funny.
God, I'm retarded.

* * *

nawleed's haikus suck
All split up oddly
What a fucking jerk.

[nawleed]

creative writing.
class isn't so bad when you
only write haikus.

* * *

the sound of pencils;
writing makes me nauseous, like
a carnival ride.

* * *

this eraser will
wear down very, very soon...
or will it break off?

* * *

"seven syllables"
is really five syllables.
"where's the beef?" she asks.

* * *

my throat is full of
phlegm. "now _that's_ a funny word,"
says the blind street mime

* * *

"bathroom humor" is
immature... but phlegm is still
quite a funny word...

* * *

the sound of the voice
of idiocy abounds,
impenetrable.

* * *

all of this writing
is a huge waste of paper.
i kill trees daily.

* * *

crooks and foul liars
lacking imagination
cruelly steal ideas.

* * *

let it be known that
this was not my idea.
so blame linear.
