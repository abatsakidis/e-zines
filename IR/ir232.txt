	I spend way too much of my time at bagel shops. I dunno, I like
bagels a lot. It isn't a surprise or anything, I guess bagels have become
pretty popular these days.

	I went to a bagel shop alone today. I sat by the window, enjoying
my food and watching people pass by, every now and then one coming in. The
whole scene was perfect...

Except you weren't there.

And this is a plain bagel, when I asked for a jalepeno one.

	I don't mind, really. One bagel is as good as the next. I
take what I can get. I'm not one to complain... unless it's in cheesy
text files.

	I've been thinking about you a lot lately. Most things are
random and unexplainable like that, I guess.

	It's seeming the more I think about you, the more I'm realizing
I can't really cling to you, but that's nothing new. It's mostly my fault,
I've  never told you how I felt.

	And I guess, as much as I've been thinking about you... I've been
pretty "busy" with other people. I'm pretty good at hiding my emotions and
sending mixed messages, too.

	It's not that bad, I suppose, thinking about you but being left
with these other people.

	One person is as good as the next. I take what I can get.
