 stayin' up past midnight,
 recollecting our last fight
 we can't do this to ourselves,
 forgotten memories like bibles on shelves
 
 i love you was all i got
 hesistating, you got me in a rough spot,
 hidden motivations
 emotions on some sort of vacation
 
 You'll remember this day
 and exactly where my guns lay
 from all that what was lost
 I paid the highest cost
 
 Where do you get this feeling
 how did you just give up?
 Everything's been right here
 I don't know; why do we have this fear?
