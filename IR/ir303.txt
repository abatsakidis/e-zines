	  There's an innocence to be felt in walking down these streets,
  4 a.m., listening to your favorite songs.
  
	  No one's fighting, no one's selling drugs, for one moment in your
  spiteful day, we're all at peace.
  
	  Sleep.
  
	  It's a beautiful thing, isn't it? Lay down and close your eyes.
  Your body rejuvenates and your subconcious communicates to you through
  incoherant messages (or sometimes, very coherant). What does this show?
  That we all can finally be in harmony, if only for a couple of hours.
  
	  The lonely can finally put their minds at ease, the hungry no
  longer have to suffer, the violent can find peace again... if only for
  a couple of hours
  
  	Throughout our days, our thoughts cloud our minds, thinking
  negative or thinking positive. We sleep. Isn't everything Okay again?
  Sure, we all wake up regretting that "mistake." But, after all, I'm sure
  you'll find that it was worth it.
  
	  You don't have to suffer. You have the power to change your
  life. You can see it in your dreams, you can make it into reality. Who's
  to say what you can and can't do, go out and fuckin' live, don't let this
  experience pass you by. Go do what you want to do, but show at least a
  little respect for other people. After all, we're just like you. Human.
  
            END RACISM
            END SEXISM
            END SPECIESISM
            END MILITARISM
            END THE CORRUPTED VIEWS OF OUR SOCIETY
            FUCK THEIR LAWS!@$~!
