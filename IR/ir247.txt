She dreams in a daylight tone
Afraid to ever be alone

Walking through magenta trees
To the garden of the seas

But who will know of her game
She speaks not of its name

Child to the nymph and light
Dancing dreams of delight

She dreams in a musical way
Sleeping walking though her day

Strange and stranger yet
This be her own prophet

Carved in stone and in the wood
Between two altars is where she stood

And messages came through her mind
They say they weren't always kind

Messenger touched from above, Divine
She was a ahead of her time

Who remembers the place she went
From here to there, heaven sent

Silent and nameless she'll always be
A child of the Stars for eternity
