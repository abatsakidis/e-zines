There Xade and Abby sit... just like every afternoon after lunch...
in Physics class.  It's an Honors class, but the instructor is
completely laid back.  Xade and Abby were at first confused when
they began attending the class back in August.  They were not even
doing half the work they expected of the class.  The regular agenda
constitutes of lecture while working problems.  All one has to do
is take notes.   Abby and Xade were the first one in the class to
start taking notes.  (The rest of the class caught on after the
first few tests.)Their physics instructor does not "believe" in
mathematics, formulas, calculators, or trigonometry.  (He has all
that stuff premeditatedly worked out.)

Abby can be found drawing, taking notes, or teaching herself Japanese*.
Xade can usually be found doing anything of the following (although
not limited to):  eating lunch and munchies, reading in her computer
books, taking lecture notes, sleeping, trying to pay attention to
lecture while sleeping on right arm while writing with alternate hand
still trying to take notes (although they end of mysteriously disformed
and make next to no sense at all when looked back over), drawing,
colouring, writing IR files, sleeping on Abby, hackign the planet,
exchanging manually written leet speak conversations with Abby (she
always starts those), conversing with Abby on anything from geek to
mod.  The most entertaining bit of all this is their grades in the
class.  Xade falls asleep like everyday and makes perfect grades
on all the tests--she has a 100.  Abby works on Japanese* stuff and
and draws pictures--she has a 98.  Not that grades matter or anything--
it's just cool.  Right now class is just a goof-off time.  Abby is
cleaning out her backpack sorting papers into German, Physics, and Hack
the Planet piles.   (HtP pile includes any type of Japanese stuff,
drawings, those damn leet speak notes and manually written ascii art,
etc.)  Meanwhile Xade is awake and writing yet another IR file!
Where the hell does she come from writing all this shit anyway?!?!

Abby (IR file 043) and Xade's other friend Tye (IR file 020) shall soon
be submitting files of their own to IR.  Xade is really excited about
this!  Remember Joey Rochester (IR file 028)?  Yeah.. that asshole who
really fucked with Xade's feelings... well, he still hasn't returned
her oldschool gray Hersheys milk chocolate t-shirt... yeah right now
he's playing cards with a group of students at the neighboring table
directly behind Xade.. he was just talking in a gay-esque lisp-ie
voice.. what a dumbass.  Want another story about him?  Well today Abby
had the 'punk rock Catholic schoolgirl' look.

[Abby walks into class, Joey sees her and says something stupid...]
<Joey> You know you're dressed like Britney Spears right??
<Abby> yeah.. whatever
[3 minutes elapse]
<Joey> *loud-'she's-supposed-to-hear-and-laugh-voice* Hey.. hey look
      everyone!! Abby is dressed like Britney Spears today!!
[No response from Abby, 3 seconds elapse... for some reason Xade was
sitting right there and missed the whole damn thing...]
<Joey> *walking around class poking people telling them the great
        wondrous news, trying to get a rise out of Abby perhaps..*
<Chic-nearby> Hey Abby, he's trying to get your attention.  I think
               he has something to say to you
[Abby: turned around and facing chic]
<Joey> *to Abby*  Hey you know you're dressed like Britney Spears
        right?
<Abby> *leans across desk and looks chic in face, in loud 'hear-me'
          tone*  He repeats himself when he thinks he said something
           clever!

Remember how Joey is immediately behind Xade the last part of class
playing cards with the other children... while Abby and Xade were
talking about this.. Joey *randomly* leans over and says "Britney
Spears" in a taunting tone--at which point Xade and Abby stare at
each other and laugh their asses off.  Joey turns back around
feeling left out of the joke.

At the beginning of class a couple students got on the teacher's
computer and downloaded Napster.  Wouldnt work cuz the school's dumb
and something to do with a proxy server.. that could have easily be
found out by Xade or Abby.  hehe.. Why were they downloading Napster?
Because the teacher brought in speakers.  So right now this kid is back
there listening to New Found Glory and looking at car sites.  Meanwhile
Xade and Abby are making plans for the weekend:  working out, hanging out,
and keeping up the image/dedication of being mad hakkas.

Class ends with Abby finishing her cleaning fiasco and Xade sipping her
Hawaiian Punch in a can... writing Ir files.  The two geek girls exit the
class talking about their camboy crushes the greatest places to get
Japanese fighting swords for Dojo lessons while walking toward the huge
ass gym for powerlifting group pictures.


*Japanese stuff...

<Daoli_Llama> So.. why are you learning Japanese?
<Abby> because.. I want to...
<Daoli_Llama> How are you doing that?
<Abby> *starts to speak but gets interrupted...*
<Xade> There is a /plethora/ of information out there!  Tons of resources..
       if you dont take advantage of them.. then your'e a dumbass..
<Xade> Besides.. we live in America... we have the fucking right to anything
<Daoli_Llama> *blank look*
<Abby> *slightly aghast and laughing*
