Staring back at me,
There's a white wall,
I dont wanna get up for fear i am gonna fall.

All the corruption,
Is making me spin,
All this fucking noise is burying me in.

No pain no gain,
Hallucinations,
Every things the same al these great expectations.

The constant edging in,
Why wont it go away?

All the aggravation,
The stupidity,
Tantalisation,
Resist the humility.

Dont let it drag me down to where i dont wanna be goin,
Dont let it drag me down while i write this shitty poem.

All the fucked uo things,
That i have to say,
If theres one thing to learn,
It's cruelty pays.

All the dumbarse people,
You have to explain,
The only way they are gonna learn,
Is through pain.

Why do i say all these stupid things,
I'm falling over and being locked in.

Start the riot,
Break some face,
Win the never ending 1st place in the rat race.

Too much nagging,
It's fucking my mind up,
You talk to much,
Shut the fuck up.

All my anger,
Concentrated,
This fucking headache,
My mind's been masturbated.
