	Please join the Fellowship of the Walking Souls. Below is information
regarding our beliefs and spiritual path.

                                    -oOo-

	If one uses the following analogy to symbolically represent the 
Judeo-Christian faiths, than it is much easier, in turn, to understand the
spiritual quest of the Walking Souls...

                                     ***

	Imagine a bus stop. At this bus stop sits a Christian man, and a
women of Jewish faith. They are discussing the destination they hope to come
to by riding the awaited bus.
	"I'm on the first bus out of here to Paradise!" Says the woman.
 	"I too am headed for Paradise, but you see, it won't be the
FIRST bus," replies the man. "We've missed the first bus by over 2,000 years.
But the day will come when the bus stops by again! I know this for a fact, 
for the bus driver said so the first time around."

                                     ***

	Now let's step back a moment. Obviously, "Paradise" is Heaven, the
"bus" is the Messiah. Jewish people think that the Messiah has not yet come,
whereas Christians think that Jesus was the Messiah, and he's going to 
return... SOMEday.

	Back to the story...

                                     ***

	As the two were talking, a third person, another man, was overhearing
the conversation, growing impatient as they waited for the bus.
	"I couldn't help but overhear you too. But after a little 
contemplation of your discussion, I've decided you're both wrong," interupted
the impatient man.
	"Wrong? Impossible! It's in the scripture!" Chime the man and woman
simultaneously. At this point both man and woman look at each other, and 
proceed to argue over WHOSE scripture is correct.
	The impatient man, growing further more impatient with the argument 
before him, decides to elaborate with his now-forgotten first statement.
	"Good sir... The bus man told you the bus would soon return. This
was over 2,000 years ago! The bus station has since crumbled, and never has
a second bus, nor more information of thebBus's return come since! How can
you still take comfort in the pausibility of a new bus? There's no true 
evidence that there ever were a first bus! How do we know that this here bus
stop wasn't built by man? I'm telling you, good sir, if ever there were a bus
before now, it has since forgotten us, or perhaps given up on us."
	"He's right!" stated the woman, proudly. "There never was a bus 
before! The old run-down bus station has been to busy worrying about other 
things, such as rebuilding itself, to be able to send out a bus. But there's
one coming soon! I assure it! For it says so right up here on the 'BUS STOP'
sign!"
	The impatient man sighed. "But you see, you are left with the same 
problems as this Good sir, ma'am. The old run-down bus station was forgotten
about and left abandoned simply because it did not - nor will EVER - send out
a bus. It's not rebuilding itself - it is run-down due to inactivity, and 
will remain in an inactive state. The possibility of a bus showing up were 
always pipe-dreams and mythological scenarios! There was no bus before - 
hence it will never return. The bus station was a facade - hence there will
never be a bus at all! You can not rely on a bus to take you to your 
destination"
	"Blasphemy! What are you saying, man?" Asked the man.
	"Yes! Surely you are not thinking out your words," added the women.
	"No, you see, my logic is the only the profound and pure logic that
has been discussed here at this stop! I propose we stop waiting for a bus -
no bus will ever come. I propose we cease our inactivity - such inactivity
makes us no better than the rest! I propose we stop trusting our destination
within the hands of a mythological bus station and non-existant bus! It is
time we rely on ourselves - I shall WALK to the Paradise myself! No bus will
ever come for me, nor yourselves, as long as we stay here and wait!"
	"But we don't know the way! Only the bus driver does!" Said the 
women, now alarmed and confused with the impatient man's proposals.
	"Lady, we must not rely on legends of fabled busses to show us the 
path. Only we, ourselves, can find the true path. For the path is within us.
And finding my path is exactly what I intend to do. Goodbye."
	The impatient man walked away, adventurous and full of wonder.
	The woman and man sat quietly on the bust stop bench. They were 
confused. They had heard what this impatient man had to say, but yet they 
waited for the bus, regardless.

	The bus never came.

	They both died unhappy, waiting on a bench.

	Neither had ever taken the initiative to leave the bus stop.

	The impatient man never returned to the bus stop.

	It is said he found Paradise on his own. There were no bus stops in
Paradise, no signs of a bus to come with more individuals. The impatient man
died happy, in a world of his own, found on his own.
