I just wanted to say that I was reading through the IR files, and realized
how retarded mine is. Mebbe you could remove it? (#125)

Dear miss adrianna j. wozniak,

	Every now and then, I'll get this request. And no, I never fulfill
it. It's something that is out of my control and beyond me. I can not go back
and alter Impulse Reality and textfile history because you embarrassed 
yourself. I just can't, okay! A lot of us do some pretty embarrassing things
in our life that we regret and wish we could forget, but it doesn't happen.
We have to live with the consequences.

	Let me offer some advice: Don't worry about how your textfile looks
to you now, just remember that at the time of writing, those thoughts were so
important that you felt compelled to write them down. When you were finished,
you thought it was worth submitting. So at one point, in your mind up there,
this was a good text. Now you view it as sub-par, but that's only because 
you've grown a bit and maybe matured as a writer. But regardless, let this
text stand as a memory of the writer you once were, much like photographs of
You when you were three years old. Awh, how much we change.

	Your textfile still makes me laugh, you see, because I'm a vegan. 
Therefore, I don't eat meat or cheese or tuna, or any of that stuff you were
bitching about. Ha - irony.

	- linear
