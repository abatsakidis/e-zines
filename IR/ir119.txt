	I just had to get some of my feelings down on some form of paper.
Today I watched a Special on tv about the USS Cole. This US Naval Ship was
attacked in the port of Yemen, Aden while refueling. One of my best
friends, Jeremy Stewart was aboard this ship.

	I first met Jeremy while i was in the 10th grade. He was in German 3
and I was in german 2. H wasn't in the class for long, he ended up
dropping the class later on. After that I didn't see him for about two and
a half years. I met him again when he was on leave from the navy and came
back home to Waldorf, Maryland, the town I live in. My best friend Mark had
known him for a LONG time. So I got to know Jeremy pretty well, well enough
to call him one of my best friends. His time to stay at home came and
went, he went back to Norfolk, Virginia to get back to work until some time
in december when they were supposed to come back for christmas.

	On october 12th I had some sort of weird feeling about
something I couldn't put my finger on. So I decided to skip english 1010.
I went to sit on the steps of the library. I lit up a cigarette and saw
Mark walking twords me. He didn't seem too happy about something. He told
me "Hey man, I've got some bad news, I don't know if you've heard or not,
but the ship Jeremy was on was attacked this morning". At that point i had
not idea really what to think. My initial feelings were "Out of a crew of
over 200,000, the chances of him be killed let alone injured are pretty
slim". So after that me and Mark walked back to his truck and we ran into
Katy Mcgraw. A good friend of Mark's, Jeremy's, and mine. As soon as she
walked up to us she started crying and gave Mark and I a hug. I still
really couldn't grasp what had happened, I wouldn't believe it. It wasn't
until Mark called Jeremy's house later that week when we would find out
the full extent of Jeremy's injurys. He ended up with a ruptured stomach,
broken arms, broken legs, and a crushed heel. His heel was literally left
in thousands of pieces. My heart sunk. Out of all the people on that damn
ship, my friend had to be the one injured the worst. But I guess I should
be thankful that he survived. It could have been far worse.

	After about 3 months Jeremy is progressing very well, and seems to be
getting better every day. He's the same guy that me and mark knew before.
We appreciate every day that he spends in his home town.

	I can only hope that he knows how much his friends care for him
and love him. He is truely a miracle. A miracle that I will never forget.
