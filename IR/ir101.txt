here we go people. i have explored most big cities, lived in several, was 
born in one and im sure that means i am a city girl. new york too lush, 
hong kong is too fast, tokyo is too bright, paris is too french and london 
is too ... london wots happening to you? there are no words to explain 
london. how i wish the english would stop fancying a cuppa, stop watching 
coronation street and stop the s club 7 from ripping off french artists 
(norma ray 'tous les maux d'amour' became s club 7's hit 'natural'). dont 
get me wrong i dont hate london. london itself is a beautiful city, with 
the ever so marvelous soon-to-be torn down millenium dome. but LONDONERS 
good lord. im not sure if i love them or hate them. london are you ready? 
we need to show the world that we dont ALWAYS eat crumpets, we dont ALWAYS 
drink tea (thats one thats gonna be hard to stop) and surely we could come 
up with an original programme rather than ripping off other countries big 
brothers?

but i guess london cant be that bad, obviously it has its perks otherwise 
superstar madonna wouldnt have moved there. courtney love would have chose 
some other city to start her new album in. angelina jolie would hang out in 
california than london then if london was THAT bad. and wot about bush? 
well gavin rossdale has his own mobile phone in england, im sure i could 
get you the number, its somewhere in the rubbish bin.

as for me, im no superstar. im plain ol dinkee. ill stick with london thru 
its good and bad times, thru its fuel crisis, thru its posh n becks phase, 
thru each and every tabloid news of princess diana and thru all its tea 
crazed charm. for i am dinkee.
