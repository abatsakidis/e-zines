(Friday, June 30th, 2000, in School. 3:15 PM)

Joe -	Another year of school gone!

Adam-Woooohoooo! Schools out for summer! Where are we going to party
tonight?

Fred-	How about we find a party?

Joe-	No way! Lets make our own party! How's about the mountain behind
	my house?

Jim-	Hell yes! Sounds good, and lets get some bottles instead of cans, so
	we can smash them!

Fred-	Yeah! We can do lots of that!!!

Jim-	Do you mean drinking or smashing?

Joe-	Well, lets get over to my place so we can place an order.

(Over at Joe's House)

Joe-	Taxi is here with our stuff dudes. Fred, go pay the man.

Fred-	Right on!

(Fred goes out, talks to the taxi driver, and looks like he is arguing with 
him. Jim, Joe, and Adam watch on)

Joe-	I think the cabbie is IDing him. This sucks man! We better get the
	stuff, or I am going to be crazy pissed!

Adam-You Gotta have Faith!

Joe-	Shuddup Adam.

(Fred gets the items from the cabbie and walks away.)

Fred-	That was crazy! That cabbie must be on drugs or something. He
        started talking about the end of the world, and black blood, and some

	wacked stuff about a guy named "Omar". Then he gave me the booze
	for free and drove away.

Joe-	Uh, ok. Then give us back our money. Ok, what time is it?

Adam- It is now only 4:20 pm.

Joe-	How much alcohol do we have?

Fred- Way more than enough.

Adam-I am hungry. Lets eat before it gets dark.

Joe-	Sounds good, what do you want?

Adam- Corn and whisky in a jar would hit the spot.

Jim-	What the hell is wrong with you? Whisky in a jar? What's up with
	that?

Adam- Shut the f**k up, Shut the f**k up,  just shut the f**k.

Jim-	Idiot.

Joe- Ok, Ill make corn and rice. Not no whisky in no jar tho, you dumbass.

(Joe Turns on stove and there was a gas leak, and it blew up in his face)

Joe-	AAARRRUUUGGGHHH!!!! AHHHH!! I'm all burnt up! Ahh!

Jim-	WICKED!!!!

Fred-	Shut up Jim, he is in pain! Here Joe, vodka will help the pain.

(Joe chugs down a whole 40 of vodka)

Joe-	I feel much better now! Let me clean up these burns on my arm, and
	we can be on our way.

Jim-	That was cool!

Adam- What about my food?

Fred-	Shut the hell up! Who cares about your food? Your friend could have
	Been killed, and you are worried bout some corn. What a prick.

Adam-Ill order pizza then.

(The four guys go up to the mountain, wide open spot with a tent and fire.)

Fred-	Hay Adam, what did you bring for music?

Adam- Everything good. What do you want me to put on?

Fred-	Anything good.

(Adam Sticks in a CD into the radio)

Jim-	So, how many people did you tell this little get-together about?

Joe-	I phoned up John, Evan, Sean, and Tyler. They will probably tell a
	Whole bunch of people. What do you want to do while we wait for
	People to show up?

Fred-	How about we drink?

(Joe pukes)

Jim-	I think he had too much to drink already.

(Joe pukes some more)

Fred-	Here joe, have some of these, they are gravel pills, they make 
        you not Puke.

(Joe takes the pills)

(....15 Minutes later....)

Joe-	Hay Fred, where did you get those pills?

Fred-	From my brothers room, they were in a container that said "Gravel 
Pills"

Joe-	Well, how do you know that they were really gravel pills?

Jim-	Uh oh.

Joe-	I feel weird dudes. My arm hurts. What's happening guys?

Fred- Uh, I think we better go see some one about this, like a doctor or
	Something.

Adam-I like music.

Fred-	What the hell is your problem, Adam? Are you a retard? Do you have
	Any idea to what's going on now? Joe just took some unidentified
	Pills, and his arm is all burnt up, and he had a 40 of vodka, he
        could Die, and all you think about is music? You need help!

(Jim, Joe and Adam notice that Joe is eating something.)

Jim-	Whatcha eating dude?

Joe-	Candy.

Jim-	You brought candy? Hay, your not eating candy! What is that?

Joe-	Candy, I found it on the floor.

Jim-	I think he is going nuts. We better get him out of here.

(Joe picks up some fungus from the ground and eats it)

Fred-	What the hell are you doing? Give me those! You don't even know
	What that is! Your sick, Joe lets go!

Joe-	No! Stay back demons! Devil spawn! Evil calculoid! Go back to hell.

(Joe runs away screaming)

Fred-	Where is he going? Lets go get him.

(Fred and Jim run after him, Adam switches CDs, and stokes up the fire.)

Fred-	Joe! Come back! Where are you going? We want to help you!

Joe-	NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!

Jim- Yeah, come back!

(Joe Stops and starts breaking large sticks on trees)

Jim-	Wicked! Yeah! Smash those sticks!

Fred-	Shut up Jim! Help me get him!

(Fred and Jim try to get on both sides of him, but Joe starts running 
again.)

Fred-	Damn, we lost him! Where did he go? Did you see?

Jim-	No. Where is that idiot Adam?

(Jim and Fred go back to the camp site where they were before)

Adam- Hay, I seen him go this way! Lets go!

(All three guys start running in the direction that Adam said he saw Joe go)

Fred-	He is running towards that cliff! Joe, NOOO!!

(Joe Jumps off the cliff)

Adam- He is going to be so re-arranged after this fall.

(Joe his the ground hard)

(Fred runs down the side of the mountain)

Fred-	Are you alright dude?

Joe- no (gurgle)

Fred- Adam, go call the ambulance. Jim, go get some more vodka so we can
	Clean these cuts!

(Jim gets vodka)

Joe- Vodka burns! Arrugh!!

Fred- Ok, lets get our booze and bring Joe out onto the street, so the
	Ambulance will find him.

Jim-	Are we going to just leave him here?

Fred-	Yeah, we still got booze to drink. I doubt he will remember anything
	That happened here tonight anyway.

Adam-I guess it is just one of those days.

Jim-	Yeah, lets go find a party where we can cause a riot or something.

Fred-	Hay, did we ever get that pizza you ordered?

Adam- Yeah, I charged it onto Joe's parents account. I hope he wont mind.

(Jim, Adam, and Fred leave Joe lying in the middle of the road, they walk 
down the street with the sun setting)
