As we stare into the screens
That control our lives
Bits of data
Nothing, they are nothing
Talking heads
Dictate our thoughts
Soulless machines
Violate our rights
Privacy
Freedom of speech
Right to bear arms
Are just illegal ideals
Gas-guzzling SUVs
Dominate our polluted roads
Rows among rows of identical 'homes'
House white-collar slaves
Day in, day out
To work, to 'home'
Human identity gone
Forever erased
Gargantuan retail stores
Destroy our land
Employ less fortunate children
For less then 5 cents per week
To you I say
If you read this
You have broken free
From the most basic chains of conformity
Free your mind
Destroy the binds
When they discourage you from committing an act
DO IT!
Don't be 'perfect'
Keep evolving
Want less
Be more
As our feelings slowly turn to nothing
Remember this
Forget me
Remember this
Forget me
But remember this
HUMAN IDENTITY GONE
FOREVER ERASED
Resurrect your true life
We are no longer individuals
But one big closed mind
Useless
Nothing
The world has become nothing
What has become of our opinions
Censorship coupled with barriers imposed on our so-called fragile minds
Bring back our primal instincts
Stop cowering behind your weak buildings
Come out and brave the wind
Weather the rain
See the true light
Open your mind
Take flight
Human identity surfaces
PREPARE FOR OUR REVOLUTION!
HERE THE OPPRESSED PEOPLE'S CRY!
CHANGE!
CHANGE!
CHANGE!
FREEDOM!
