                           Words Unheard 1.0
================================== by Xade ==================================

                 What the hell is she talking about?!@?@!#  
                      understand Xade a little better...


Have you ever sat in your bed at night, thinking over the past days events
and how it faired?  Have you ever gazed into your morning cup of coffee 
thinking about your day?  Ever wonder where babies come from?  Do you have
tarter build-up on your second molar?  Is there some grodie thing on your 
back you don't like to talk to anyone about?  Did you ever have a crush on 
that girl/boy who sat beside you in second grade?  What was that whole bed-
wetting incident you still had when you were twelve?  

Well, I can't answer those questions any more than you can.  But I can tell
you "what the hell Xade is talking about" or at least give you a somewhat 
better understanding.... ;o)   She talks in a weird dialect of English called
Xadeac.  Not only does she use words you've probably never seen or heard of 
before.. but she also uses her own words. (usually made up on the spot.. 
isn't language a beautiful thing?)   (:

In absolutely no order at all, the words and definitions follow.  Additions
will be made in future issues under the same title followed by the version of
that release.  Thank you.  Please Drive Thru. [beep beep]

-nudnik: A boring or bothersome person, pest.  In layman's terms: an annoying
lil' fuck. ;o)   Ex: Grrrr... that lil nudnik wont leave me the hell 
alone@#@!#

-ooglie booglie ooglie: random onamatopeioa phrase meant to induce fright or 
laughter from the victim.  Ex:  <Xade> ooglie booglie ooglie@!#@!#  
<linear> ak!@##@ stop skarx0ring me@#$^%$#

-snogg: kiss, sticking-of-tongue-down-throat, hugging, cuddling, unf'ing...
all the same thing, give or take a few movements.  Ex:  ***Xade snoggs 
tomgavin all over up and down.... even sideways... 

-arg: sound Xade makes when she skrews something up, is frustrated, is 
confoozled, or any other situation that would neccessitate and 'arg' for a
response.   Ex.  <Xade>  arg@!#@#  I just spilled sweettarts all over me 
keyboard$@#@#$@^

-RKD: something Xade must deal with... Recurring Keyboard Dislexia.  Although
not medically proven... RKD is believed to be linked to lag, frustration, 
anxiety, and fatigue.  Ex.  <Xade> arg I dont thikn i can evne keep tpying 
any logner...  <phr33d0m> huh?  <Xade> oh damn RKD... ):
