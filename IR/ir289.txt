Let the blood stains be the only memory,
i may be gone for an eternity
I might just let this hellfire consume me
So just fuckin' leave this be

You see my life isn't everything I wanted it to be.
Being free is just a dream.
Loving a picture isn't what I thought it be.

This life aint what it seems
My mind's shrouded by constant dreams
and I just wanna be able to see
who or what I'm supposed to be

I wish I wasn't so crazy
I wish I wasn't so lazy
where's my willpower?
I've been here for over 4 hours

Bleeding for you I can't keep bleeding for you I got to be with you.

Can't you fucking hear my veins?
This goddamn life will give your heart this stain.
I won't let you kill me, I just want you to thrill me.

Bleeding for you I can't keep bleeding for you I got to be with you.

Hesitation is calling,
My patience is falling
Put your knife through my chest!
There's nothing left!!

keep me in isolation
i wanna be free of your temptation
My vision's leaving me...
what the fuck are you trying to do?

(my friend Mike helped me with this, like 
every other verse is his, i dont remember)
