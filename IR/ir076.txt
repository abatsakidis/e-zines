It's a sad thing my friend Andra isnt in my art class any more.  She's 
wonderful freaking marvelous! :P  Great times then--we could talk about 
anything and everything stupid and still find it amusing.  Phrases we talked 
about were "wonderful freaking marvelous" and "pain in the crap'in butt."  
She told me how stuff like that would just pop out of her mouth--she didnt 
know where they came from, she just made them up on the spot.

One time (that same day actually)  she was talking about how she's 
interested in forensics.  So her cousin had come in from marine's boot camp 
and he had some of his buddies with him.  She had to go to dinner with them 
all and this topic came up.  They asked her something and she replied "If I 
told you--I'd have to kill you... then I'd take your picture."

Then she went on to tell me about how she was at some silly party recently.  
And this guy was wearing some 'funky clothes.'  She exclaimed to him "hey 
are you wearing /Capri pants/?!?!  I thought only girls wore capri pants."  
Apparently the guy was wearing A&F Capri pants.  And apparently this is 
seemingly popular to the folks that shop there.  I've since seen other GUYS 
wearing 'capri pants'.  Not that there's anything wrong with it... just 
that... why?  hehehe   But for some reason she had to borrow a pair of them 
from some guy there and she told me they were really comfortable.  At the 
time she was thinking "I want to steal them and take them home with me."


Uhm yeah.  Andra is really cool.  She still needs to get a skateboard so we 
can go skating with the guys from school.
