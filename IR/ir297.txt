   Just one more late night talk on the phone 
   Everything I say has been done before 
   Another late night talk on the phone 
   a hint of hatred in your voice's tone 
    
   so aggravated 
   so frustrated 
   thin borders between us 
   of love and friendship 
    
   i won't take this 
   but you're an illusion 
   so I'll fake it 
   of love and friendship 
    
   pedestals held high 
   i won't be there to strengthen the structure 
   you don't need me 
   of love and friendship... 
    
   you don't care. 
   of love and friendship
