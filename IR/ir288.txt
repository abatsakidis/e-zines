	so like, it's november 4th, 2004 and junk and Jer just informed me
to writeabout ASCII month... which is this month.

	HOLY FUCKING SHIT! A WHOLE MONTH DEDICATED TO ASCII!??! WE MUST
BE IN E-HEAVEN!!!!

	*ahem* I don't really know where to begin, haha, Jer just wanted 
me to write about it, so you know, I am.

	This month should be like Christmas. 'Cept without Santa Claus
and all those biblical stories pertaining to the background of how it's
Jesus' birthday.... that's beside the point. Just like a month of giving,
November, the month before christmas, should be the month of sharing.

	Yeah, that's right.

	SHARING.

	Your thoughts, I mean. I'm not saying you gotta go out and let
someone use your shit that you deem so highly valuable in your life. No,
share your thoughts, express yourself!

	It's like those Verb commercials, I never really paid attention,
but I bet you did. SO COME ON!!!

	GET MOTHERFUCKING WRITING.

	please...

	...Jer will kick my ass if you don't :(
