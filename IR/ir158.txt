    Valentine's Day is months away, and yet at this time some people question
whether they have a crush on someone. A crush is nothing more than an 
infatuation with someone but some people can go a little overboard with how 
they feel about it. 

    So, I figured since I gave this speech to two people already, I guess I
should share with the text file world (assuming you may actually want to read
my humble piece) the symptoms of having a crush on someone.  You may think, 
"Who is this girl, and why should she have a clue about anything?" My reply 
is simply an arched eyebrow for I am RTF's official stalker.

I digress ... where was I?  Oh, yes symptoms.

The symptoms of having a crush: 

1. You look forward to seeing one person more than you look forward to 
   seeing anyone else 
2. You are Very concerned what this person thinks of you
3. You may get dizzy or lightheaded 
4. You say or do things that you consider stupid (You are nervous and mess 
   up) 
5. Your heart rate goes up 
6. You begin to wonder if the room is too hot and may freak out if you think 
   you are sweating too much 
7. Pupils dilate 
8. You are confused between the urge to say "Hello" and the urge to run away.
9. You start making up excuses to bump into them, call them, write them, 
   etc.,  
10. You want to impress them 
11. You find yourself daydreaming about things you may say to them, or 
    wondering where they are, what are they up to, etc., 
11a. They take up most of your thoughts. 
12. You begin to feel envy toward their friends, or jealousy toward those 
    they are nice to (or the person they have a crush on, etc.) 
13. You doodle their name or write poetry .

Having a Crush may not have all these symptoms, but if you have more than 
half, chances are you may have a crush on someone.
