Creee-kie...  creeeeek...eee... creeea...kie...  I cant believe I got talked
into this.  rustle rustle... a light splash of water laps against the boat...
the feel of shivers running throughout my body.  How did i get lost?  There 
were so many people here with me just a few hours ago.  Rafting... some fun.
alone.  cold.  the glow of the moon filling my face.  I wince.  it hurts.  
the incessant lapping of water against the hollowed out canoe.  creeeeekie...
creeeeee...kie... creeea... kie...   that cricket will now die...
