Dear Mom,
     In this world evil hides in most corners, under beds,
in closets and some less obvious places. No matter how
good of a spirit one may be, the dark may still creep up
from behind them.
     I am sorry that I was not aware of something I wrote
could mingle with something that could offend you. There
are times that I believe so strongly in something that I 
do not care who I offend along the way. However, this
time you, my Mother, were right.
     So, for the record: You have my apologies, and you
were right. Lets go write it on the calendar. 

Love,
Your Youngest Daughter
[Grey Frequency]
