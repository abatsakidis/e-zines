Dark with gloom
Far off and remote
Feel of doom
Smell rancor smoke

Yellow Gas
Lingers beyond
Feelings pass
Thoughts no longer fawned

Gaunt face
Liquid bones
Lost race
N'er ending moans

Diminished hope
Death pulls
Taut rope
Soul lulls

assignment last year, we had to write something or bring in pictures
for the WWII "Wall of Remembrance" in my history class.  It was rather
discomforting because we had to stare at this wall for a week-- with
pictures of mangled dead bodies and pale, thin people.. it was enough
to make your stomach churl.  So I wrote a poem about it.  Apparently
my teacher did not appreciate it as much as the grotesque pictures..
she gave me a 95..

in this time we shall never be appreciated.  some people can see more
than others.
