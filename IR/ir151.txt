	Impulse Reality is as an island. The borders, from all sides, are
open and vulnerable. Shieldless, it screams with anxiety and fear of attack.
But with these open borders comes opportunity for new visitors! Visitors 
that bring with them new ideas to share, new stories of far off lands, new 
adventures!

	No, wait, wait. This analogy is ridiculous! I'll start over!

	Impulse reality can be more properly compared to the tragic horrors
and fear of everyday life. The voices of Impulse Reality act as nurturing
honey, offering sweet escapism from the monotony of--

	Oh boy. What the fuck was that? This just isn't even making sense 
now! Okay, okay, I'll start again.

	When I was a young linear, I stole an object of some significance to
me in my two-dimensional juvenile world. In my young age, I had yet to sell
my soul to the highest bidder on eBay, and was therefor victim of the 
agonizing pain of guilt! I promptly got rid of the object by throwing it into
an empty field nearby my house. Approximately three weeks later while playing
in this nearby field, I rediscovered the object of my sinful attainment. I
was joyously excited, and immediately took it home to play with and enjoy.

	The point is simple: Guilt fades. However, the novelty of an item
will never wear off!

	And so is the nature of Impulse Reality - life's guiltless pleasure.
