I put my thought on backward tonight
told you memory is pudding-thick
a thing I drift in and out of until I can hardly tell you’re not here.
I rub my aching stomach, tell myself
loving you was one of those you had to be there things.

The thought of you is on my tongue.
I remember when you came to visit that Saturday
straight from the market
with bags and bags of things to share-
fresh corn, orange juice, dulse, and pie
and two apples, one for each of us

a pumpkin, a huge pumpkin, I won’t forget
your warm silhouette as I washed and dried the orange shell,
and the knife firmly held in your long, pale hand,
the concentration of your lip as you started on its skin.
