	the history of my future is the present of my past. there is nothing
on this earth that would ever last. even love they say fades away. so what's
left on this earth shall never stay.

	in every problem there is a solution. in every nation there is a 
revolution. in every seed there is a tree. in every you there is a me.

	there shall be truth in every lie thats told. there shall be warmth
in every place thats cold. there shall be form when my life molds. and in my
future, a history unfolds.
