	I got a phone, yay.  In the course of two years I have learned to 
dislike phone company after phone company. At first I used Bell Atlantic, I 
switched to MetTel on a whim, decided to give Sprint a try, and moved on to 
AT&T. Just when I think I will throw my phone through a wall and go back to
using my mothers phone (Yes, I was tempted), I received a mailing from MCI.

	I never used MCI, but I opened the envelope and read what I 
discovered to be a phone bill.  I double checked and noticed my last name 
was spelt wrong, but everything else was indeed my proper information.  The 
only thing was, I never saw this phone number before.

	I called MCI, and spoke to a fellow in Customer Service. He told me 
it *had* to be my bill, and passed me own to his supervisor.  I continued to
explain that I received a bill for a phone number I never ordered, and is not
even at my house.  I was told to call back tomorrow.

	Next day, I called bright and early (I was upset that I had to see 
the sun earlier than I preferred).  I spoke with a woman this time, who told
me the account was given a credit as of yesterday.  I was pleased that at 
least something was done.  I asked the woman to send me a letter confirming 
this. I wanted to cover my ass if I got another bill or collections letter.  
She told me that she was unable, and when I was passed on to her supervisor,
he told me the same thing.

	On top of this, I was told that I may get another bill or two in the
mail, for it will take time to clear this.  This supervisor was confused, 
because he told me the phone line has been connected since 1999. He was 
unable to tell me how the other bills were paid, or where the physical line
was.

	I am never switching my actual line to MCI, I guess I will have to 
crawl back to Verizon.

Moral: If this happens to you, have your Dad call back saying you are a
minor, even if you are 23. It makes the guy at MCI cry. 

The End.
