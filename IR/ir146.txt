Waxing moon
high above me,
grant my wish
hear my plea:

Which is the
way to go?
Light my path
so I may know.

Full moon
ever so bright
bring laughter
into the night.

When with others
we shall meet;
With joy each
we shall greet.

While the moon
begins to wane
so will melt
the worlds pain.

The sound of
crickets, hark,
fading into 
the dark.

Days gone now
sigh, "alas!"
Another month
soon will pass.

New moon
time to wake,
your timeless journey
you must make.
