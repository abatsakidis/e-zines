Damn you Joey Rochester
Damn you for being the new kid
Damn you for being a punk boy
Damn you for being so cute

Damn you Joey Rochester
Damn you for driving a '74 VW Beetle
Damn you for having that red '69 Karmann Ghia too
Damn you for being a that daredevil you are

Damn you Joey Rochester
Damn you for being so tall
Damn you for your charm
Damn you for liking me

Damn you Joey Rochester
Damn you for all the nice things you said to me
Damn you for taking them back
Damn you for calling seeing me as 'just a buddy'

Damn you Joey Rochester
Damn you for shopping at thrift stores too
Damn you for wearing leather pants and close fitting shirts
Damn you for looking so nice in whatever you wear

Damn you Joey Rochester
Damn you for thinking I was the coolest person you'd met
Damn you for thinking I was cute
Damn you for getting to know my personality

Damn you Joey Rochester
Damn you because you thought I was hot
Damn you because you fucked with my feelings
Damn you for being so awesome

Damn you Joey Rochester
Damn you for leading me on
Damn you for making me feel like someone
Damn you for not making up your mind

Damn you Joey Rochester
The first time you saw me 
You thought I was cool
A punk rock girl in a Hawaiian shirt

Damn you Joey Rochester
You got to know me
You found out I'm a vegetarian
I asked you to be in my group

Damn you Joey Rochester
You told me on the phone
You thought I was cute, then hot
You loved my personality

Damn you Joey Rochester
The first night you talked about 
How a punk rock girl would be
The perfect girlfriend

Damn you Joey Rochester
The second night
All you wanted to do was date
I had no problem with that

Damn you Joey Rochester
The third night you'd been thinking
And wanted to be 'just buddies'
"It was only a physical attraction"

Damn you Joey Rochester
You still want to be my friend
As do I but it seems kinda weird
Because of what has happened and what you said

Damn you Joey Rochester
I'm so unsure how to react to you
You'd like to hang out
So do I

Damn you Joey Rochester
I think you're so awesome
I think  you're so cool
If only you'd tell me what *you* _really_ think...
