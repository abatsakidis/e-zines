linear makes things better.
i sent linear a text file.
it was personal.
it was emotional.
heck, it was stupid and sad.
realizing it had yet to be released
i im'ed him my plea:
"please delete,"
i wept through my im.
he, the sentential of impulse reality
used his *poof* magics.
the file is no more.
i will never question linears eliteness
or his place as the one true god of text filedom.
all hail linear!

   the clever thing to do here would be to put some sort of copyright. no.
