No i am not demanding for your attention,
No i am not pleading for you to like me,
No i am not praying for you to pray for me.

No you dont love me,
No you dont understand me,
No you shouldnt know what i know just beacuse you feel you should know.

No Please dont look at me,
No please dont speak to me,
No please dont even try to help me.

No you cant help now.  It's too late,
No you cant touch me,
No you cant befriend me.

No there is no me and you,
No there isnt a way out,
No there is no way to break this silence.

Yes i do cry myself to sleep every night thinking about what we could have 
been, why we havnt been and why we had been.  You now dont do anything but 
get me depressed, drive me further to the realisation that i cannot live 
with-out you.

I'm going to stop this for good, and let you live your life.  Instead of 
holding your hand right now i am holding the handle of a gun.  Good bye.  I 
love you.

- Your farther
- Nick.
