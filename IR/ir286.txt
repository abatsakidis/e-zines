     WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

in celebration, we have a lot in store!

will be released later this month!

                             HOOOOORAY!

in this file, just to GENERATE SOME INTEREST in
text files (besides impulse reality, since you
obviously read us), i decided to list some of
my favorites and regular reads. CHECK THESE OUT
OR PERISH, FRIENDS.

  i'm sorry, i don't make the rules, that's how it works.

ACTIVE ZINES RECOMMENDED BY ME~!@!@#$
 (ALPHABETICAL, BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT YOU)
-----------------------------------------
     o Activist Time, Inc
       http://flag.blackened.net/ati/zine/infomaniack.html
         a very long-running zine put out by
         Prime Anarchist. Insightful and humorous
         political enlightenment

     o confusions
       http://www.hoe.nu/confusions
         they haven't released an issue in a few
         months, so maybe this should be in the
         inactive zine list, but i hope not, because
         trilobyte is awesome.

     o Cult of the Dead Cow
       http://www.cultdeadcow.com
         cDc does a lot more besides producing text,
         but they've been doing it for the longest
         and they're responsible for influencing
         numerous other text zines, past and present.

     o Neo-Comintern, The
       http://www.neo-comintern.com
         anyone who reads iR should be fully aware
         of n-com by now, brainchild of BMC (who
         occasionally blesses iR with submissions!)
         and if you're not aware, then you're a
         worthless gutter tramp.

NON-ACTIVE (OR AS SOME WOULD CALL IT, INACTIVE)
      ZINES RECOMMENDED BY ME!#!$#$
        (STILL ALPHABETICAL, !!! )
------------------------------------------------
     o Hogs of Entropy (HOE)
       http://www.hoe.nu
         with 1112 text releases, HOE is the most
         prolific zine to date. without hoe's influence,
         iR would not exist. mogel was a great editor
         and a great friend, and wrote some of the best
         textfiles ever (he also wrote for iR on several
         occasions!)

     o I Bleed For This?
       http://www.textscene.com/archive/IBFT
         this zine also payed a huge role in my interest
         in the text scene. long before i was writing my
         own textfiles, or really understood the nature of
         text files, i was reading IBFT? i'm not sure
         what it is about their 'hate-everything-especially-
         you' attitude that makes us all love them, but we all
         -do- love them. 

     o Long Dark Tunnel
       http://web.textfiles.com/ezines/LDT
         LDT just sort of fell off the face of the internet a
         year or two ago, and a hole in my heart has remained
         ever since. i actually started actively reading the
         zine shortly before they disappeared, so it was a real
         bummer when they suddenly up and left.


 okay, i am at work, and this is all i got right now. these should keep you
busy. now go start your own fucking zine, and send all information to...
