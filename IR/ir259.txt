hello there,
dear linear,  warrior of impulse reality.


the other day, i was looking at your ezine, and, it has come to my attention
that it's possible to submit issues, n' stuff. but(!), the latest issue dates
back to, like, almost one year ago..

so, i'm wondering, is it just something wrong with the servers clock (or
something technical like that), or, is the zine... dead?

hmm, i could write some stuff for your zine, so, if you're really still
reciving submitions, drop me a mail.

-----
BTW, i have this 'ezine' thingie of my own too, it's
in  WiKi interface, check it out, if you feel like it.

Dear Dead Hero,

Impulse Reality loves to go on year long breaks, then promise frequent releases,
and then go on another year long break. I don't know what it is about myself that
just can't commit. This has definitely been the longest I have gone without
releasing issues, and that sucks. But you wanna know what sucks more?

Over the year that I haven't been releasing, I had gathered quite a few submissions.
Well over 50.  and somehow i lost, permanently deleted every last one of the little
bastards! I was very pissed and have no idea how it happened. I have a few submissions
backed up now, but I feel really bad about all the people who submitted stuff that I
accidentally lost.

I keep telling myself that "this weeked i will release" and three weekends later I
still haven't released. I was just about to release the 50+ issues, but then i realized
they were all gone, and i fell into this depressed slump.

I keep getting really busy with life and I get sidetracked. See, in high school i was a
loser with no life at all and had plenty of time to release issues, so I'm not use to 
having a job and having friends and actually doing stuff. I don't know how to balance my
time, even two years after graduation. Ho-hum

SO, to answer your question, I still accept submissions. BUT, i can't promise you when
they'll be released. Maybe next weekend, maybe next year (hopefully not).

Sorry, I suck.

                                         HUGS AND KISSES,
                                              linear.
