	The television is on, showing a popular soap opera.  An overly 
muscular man, with his shirt half-buttoned, walks through the scene.  He is 
greeted by a flawless beauty.  The couple embrace and kiss passionately.  A 
bright flash, a change on the screen.  The beginning of a commercial.  
Exciting music plays.  A figure that can be described in no other way than 
"goddess" speaks.  Cheerfully, she works on convincing her viewers to buy 
makeup.  If she looks like that in reality, makeup would obviously not be 
needed.  Commercials for a baby doll that has makeup magically appear and 
disappear with warm or cold water, and a loud army gun follow.  Perfection 
in adults, made-up little girls, and armed little boys indicate a world 
unlike our own, which is filled with natural flaws.  The media in American 
society has a poor effect on the public as a whole, by making the individual
feel inadequate, when they are not a replica of the type of person portrayed.

	The media begins the conditioning of its first victims  toward the 
false environment it creates.  Baby-dolls with makeup, ultra-thin Barbies, 
and adult-like clothing tear at the innocence of young girls.  The things 
that girls are encouraged to play with create the want to leave childhood and
become mature too early.  Loud guns that flash, pop, or smoke draw the 
attention of young boys.  Guns teach a lesson of violence, armies, and death.
Slowly, the youth in American society are desensitized toward the real 
world and welcomed with open arms into the false world.

	Via the impossibly pretty world created by the media, women look into
manipulated mirrors that reflect a vision of ugliness.  They attempt to look
like corseted Barbie dolls.  Damaged bodies do not hinder the desire to end
the sorrow and self-deprecation caused by the artificial world of the mass
media.  Women in photo shoots, bound in figure-enhancing garments, encourage
dislike for the average breast size.  Only the woman with styled hair, 
expensive clothing, and hourglass-shaped body will achieve her desires.

	Men desire to look and act like "real" men when they are exposed to 
characters in the movies and on television.  Conveniently, the media is 
standing by with an image from their fantasy world.  Unnaturally muscle-bound
men with impossible tans and big-name clothing are shown to succeed.  Men's 
need to love and be loved is exploited through the viewing of only the 
perfect man getting the girl.

	There are two worlds existing parallel with each other.  A perfect 
media creation malignantly affects the world in which humanity actually 
resides.  Men and women lack a positive self-image due to the encouragement 
to re-sculpt themselves into something they cannot be.  Children observe a 
world of adulthood.  They are enticed to join, only to discover it does not 
exist.  Perhaps the media as a whole will not alter its negative influence.
However, individuals can learn to accept themselves and their world when they
realize they can create a difference in the one they live in after the 
fantasy world is left behind.
