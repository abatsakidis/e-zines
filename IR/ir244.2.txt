 |         the revolution will be one fueled by art and love alone,        |

There’s knowledge
   beyond that found in lecturing,
There's beauty
   beyond centerfold models
...like your smile.
   I like your smile.

These days it feels
like we're all being drained
   I've never been one for nostalgia...
 but without a future to look forward to
        anymore,
   I've nothing but what I
      can look back on

Maybe I can always be
 the first to say I'll stop at
Nothing short of Revolution...
   but really I mean I'll drop everything
   just so I can hold your hand.

It's not so much
      that I'm lonely or anymore
      lonely than I've ever been before,
It's that I'm bored, more and more often and
miss how it use to feel to not
know how to feel.

The spontenaity of uncertainty
   is a good thing!
Or at least it can be.

      basing your actions
      on the merits of the
      actions themselves,
      without the comfort of
      an outcome so predictable...
            there's a lot to be said
            for that.

It's not hard for me
to justify things these days.
Not because I've become any better
   at making excuses
         (I've always been rather
            good at that),
But because experience has
taught me a whole new
      perspective.

         I don't know if that's a good thing.

I lost everything and got over it.
         How did I start caring again?
