upon my arrival home from the mental hospital, i started looking at life from
another perspective..  from the stand point of a midget.  i can easily walk
under bathroom stalls, drown in the soapy water of any kitchen sink, and get
away with beating up adolescent pricks bigger than i.  this is a great life!
much better than my life when i was over 3 feet tall.  i mean..  you got it
all.  people give you money because they feel sorry for you..  people laugh
at me.  it's not like before when people laughed at me without reasoning..
i now belong to a species of tiny people, tiny people that society deems
comical because of our frail bodys and vertical retardation.

i wanted to share my happieness with the world.  to let everyone know that
i was a midget.. and i was proud damn it!  the world was a different place
when i stepped outside my house.  i thought right away talent agents, small
childern, and people from all walks of life would gather around to see the 
wee man dance a nifty jig.  but it wasn't so..  everyone went about their
daily routines and paid no mind to the little man striving for attention.
the bastards!  midgets have givin' so much to the world.. and this is the 
thanks we get.  well fuck you. 

what would Willy Wonka be without his trusty Oompa Loompas?  what would
Kid Rock be without his better half, er..  yeah, Joe C? what about pro
wrestling?  where..?  NO WHERE!!!  if it was not for migets i honestly 
believe that the world would have come to an end by now.  someone - somewhere
was chuckling at a midget when they could have been building bombs and 
selling crack to the childern.  you should be ashamed of yourselves.  
taking for granted the little people God put on this planet for our
amusement.  you should not even be reading this.  what's wrong with
you anyway?  can't you even apologize for kneeing one of my people in
the face?  no, you can't be bothered with such things.  you tall 
pricks show no remorse for knocking a few teeth out of one of my
midget brothers.  i promise you this, WE WILL NOT BE OPPRESSED ANY
LONGER!  

i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true 
meaning of its creed: "we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all 
men are created equal."  i have a dream that one day on the red hills of 
Georgia, which is equal to a mountain for us small folk, the sons of midgets 
and the sons of former midget oppressors will be able to sit down together at
the table of brotherhood.  but this dream only exists in my mind, and the 
minds of abused tiny people everywhere.  if we must, we will fight the 
tyrants and we will not recede at any price.  you can take our hieght...  
but you'll never take our FREEDOM!

midgets are good people.  i admit i'd pay good money to see two midgets in a 
boxing match.  c'mon..  it would be like two tyrannosaurus rex's trying to 
throw punches.  it would be great!  but think for a second..  if everyone 
stopped and pretended that they were a midget every once and awhile..  the
world would be a better place.  that and everyone would be ass ugly.
