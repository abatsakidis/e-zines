  ____________
 |they've  got|
 |___us__now__|


trapped in the mold,
not the mistake,
batteries and lies are all it takes,

surrendered your skin,
forgotten hate,
centuries waste away your faith,

mislead the world,
rejoicing wounds,
followed into the darkest tombs,

enter the bowels,
false silver suit,
cut off by your golden roots,

turn into ice,
weak as stone,
the fallen refuse to lay alone,

diminishing intelligence,
assassinated innocence,
losing imagination - losing fascination,

day to day,
we lay in wait,
death dances on our dinner plates,

a tainted mind,
heart black as coal,
the world spins out of our control,

freedom and lust,
feed their growing greed,
abstinence and anarchy is all we really need,

pleasant fears,
masked over tears,
your inner child stuck in the gears,

a broken home,
the candle burns,
another death my stomach turns,

heartless lies,
insignificant apologies,
believe whatever you want to believe,

the damned have become the pure,
the virus has become the cure,
they've got us now,
they've got us now...
