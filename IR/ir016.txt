	Now, I am a younin', so the right thing to do is to totally go 
against what my parents/teachers/local police force say to do, right? WRONG!
I really do not like the way the generation I'm in behaves. I see all these 
dark dark people around school and whatnot, and I meant in terms of their 
personality, not their actualy physical color/clothes or anything. But I 
mean, the rebelliousness of today's  youth seems to be a lot more idiotic, 
pointless and sad than the rebelliousness of the hippie generation.

	Look at the culture of the hippie generation, they were wild kids who
had a vision of peace, and spoke out for what they believe in. They wrote 
music about the horrors of war, the bad decisions of our government, and the
injustice of racial and ethnic prejudice. What does today's generation do
that's so bad? Well, the biggest thing that upsets me is the way they 
behave. Woodstock 99 was a disaster, as teenagers destroyed the stage where
the musical artists played. You also hear a lot more about these damn school
shootings. What is wrong with these kids? I know I shouldn't take the easy 
way out and blame videogames, movies and music, but it is another point I 
would like to bring up.

	I really like music, but it pisses me off to see that some of the
popular music is about stuff like killing other people, crimes, stealing,
beating women, killing YOURSELF, the list goes on ... Hearing this stuff all
the time might get some sort of weird image inside the mind of today's teen.
Be in mind, though that you should also consider the fact that the kids
involved in school shootings most likely had real problems, and society 
likes to take the easy way out and blame things such as videogames/movies/
muscic. The frequency of these types of music that many teenagers listen to
reminds me of the ways that whites treated blacks in the 19th and 18th 
centuries in America. They tell blacks everyday that they were stupid. When
you hear that you are stupid everyday, eventually, you will probably start to
think you are stupid yourself.

	I would almost say to definetly respect your elders when they speak
to you. Of course, in certain situations, they simply won't understand, and
you will have to go angainst them, or something to outsmart them or 
something. But for the most part, elders know more than you (about LIFE, not
about computers or phones). They have had more experiences than you have. 
I've seen so many people have bad relationships with their parents and they
hate their parents constantly. Why not actually talk to them or consider
thinking about what it's like to be in there shoes. That's another thing that
pisses me off. So many kids just won't plain listen, or completely regard 
anything of the past as being stupid and boring. I personally like a lot of 
old hippie music, and other later music as well. But when, people just call 
it "old hippie crap" or something like that, it really offends me. They 
haven't even listened to any hippe music or anything, they just have regarded
it as being stupid. You might say I do the same with today's music, but I am
always listening to it, because quite frankly, since it's what is the "in" 
music, it is almost impossible not to listen to it.

So my favorite musical artists are:
The Doors
Pink Floyd
The Beatles
Santana (before he resorted to pop)
Nirvana
The Who

	Some elders are jerkasses, though, and need to be avoided and 
rebelled against. So I guess this had no point, I was just fucking with your
mind....
