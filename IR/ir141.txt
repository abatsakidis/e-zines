 	Late at night, half drunk (don't get me wrong, I hate the losers who
try to talk with me just to tell me how drunk/high they are - I'm not 
bragging)...

	Late at night, half drunk, trying to write for a stupid zine everyone
thought was dead. Here it is, the ressurection Impulse Reality. OH BOY!

	Impulse Reality isn't really dead, it's me. I've gone and done the 
unthinkable: I went out and got a life. As most everyone knows, I've had a 
girlfriend for almost a year now. This really didn't effect _ir_ too much,
until the last few months (Summer and all). With this whole Summer thing 
came something I thought I had given up a long time ago - yeah, that whole
life thing I've been talking about.

	I know, I've sold out. It completely sucks in so many ways. I should
be just like YOU - sitting in front of a computer for endless hours, wasting
my life away. That used to be me. And don't get me wrong, that was fun. It
still would be fun today, I'm sure. Editing shit for Impulse Reality, working
on Phonelosers Dot Net, encouraging the growth of new text zines, all that
jazz. Yeah, I'm sure it would all still be fun today - but having a life 
isn't so bad either, you know.

	Did I say half drunk? Perhaps I should take a break. What would the
average DRUNKEN IDIOT do right now? I should probably go watch PORN on some
TV pay channels right about now, RIGHT? I should probably eat more bread; I
don't want to be THROWING ALL THIS UP IN THE MORNING, do I? Jesus, I can't
even poor a glass of mother Tang without fucking up.

	I'm impressed with myself that I can write such a text so well while
intoxicated. I'm still not bragging. I hate alcohol.

	I have sucessfully spilled tang all over myself. Fuckng blurry 
television.

	Now that Summer is nearly over, IR will soon thrive again. My 
beautiful, amazing girlfriend (known to you as PaperHeartCutOut) won't be
able to hang out with me 24/7 (unfortunately), and therefore I'll have
much more time to work om things like _ir_ (!!)

	Perhaps I should quit now, while I'm still ahead and am able to 
correct my spelling mistakes.

	Summer is dead! Witness the NEW Impulse Reality!
