A while ago, as many of you know, I used to run a website
called United Phone Losers. I don't run that anymore, but
today I found this email conversation from way back when.

I thought I should share. I found it pretty funny. Here's
some background: someone on the UPL (phonelosers.net)
message board posted an image of some telephone test
equiptment and a link to a specific site. A few days after
that, I got this email (followed by my response)...
