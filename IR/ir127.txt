Yumm ... Caffeine.

Caffeine is bad for you.

Caffeine is addictive.

Caffeine can and will effect your nervous system as well 
as keep you up at night.

However I find that I love it.

I drink Tea.

I have Soda everyday.

Chocolate and Flavored Coffee are two of my favorite things on the planet.

If you can avoid Caffeine,

you are a better person that I am.

However in a world with people overdosing on drugs,

smoking cigarettes,

and drowning sorrows in their beer,

I find Caffeine to be a lesser evil.

It is still evil though ... 

Yep, evil.
