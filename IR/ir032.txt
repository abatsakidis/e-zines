	Test.

	This is a test.. How strong are you? How much do you love him? This 
is a test. You're selfish.. This a time you can't be.. You're depended on. I 
don't know what to do.

	Love a person you sometimes feel like you no longer know.. If all 
goes well, they'll change back. I don't know what to do..  I don't know 
anymore.. The vemon that once pumped my blood is odd now.  I don't know what 
to do..

	I'm in love.. It hurts me to see him like this.. I don't know what to
do.. I can't spaz out.. I can't hurt myself.. I don't know what to do.

	Words run through my head.. I deny myself.. I can't take it anymore..
I want to yell. I don't know what to do.

	What I predicted as happening did.. I didn't predict I'd feel like 
this. This isn't easy. This isn't his fault.. It's my mind wandering..  I 
know it'll get better with time.. This is hard.. I don't know what to do.

	I'm scared I'm going to do something stupid.. I don't want to scare 
him. I want to be there for him.. This is difficult.. I'm horrible at 
communication. I'm horrible at comforting people. I'm horrible when it comes 
to people. I can make people smile when they're already happy but, I can only
depress them when they're said. I don't know what to do.

	This is a test.. I can't cheat. I don't know what to do.
