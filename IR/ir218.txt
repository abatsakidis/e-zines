The pieces that completed my assembly were already broken.
Life, delivered in a box that was lacking a fragile warning.
I look at the bigger picture only to see an empty frame.
The frame itself, lacks just about as much as my sole purpose.
I want to believe that I will make it.
And I want to believe that things will be alright.
But by now I should have accomplished (atleast) one thing.

I've only accomplished a worried mind.
Acquiring such a worried mind has left me with no time
to become strong enough to support it.
Who would support it?
A mind that has answers for everyone's problems.
Yet, I know myself so well that I know there is no point
in trying to answer my own questions.
Would I understand? Of coarse....
And surely it is always negative.

I spend too much time trying to be happy.
Why do I have to try?
Heh. What do I have to try for?
What I'm trying for has already denied me.
Life.
! An! d it's almost the most humorious thing I've ever encounted.
How you make it out to be like what the things 
I want to have are in favor of me.

I might have the energy left.
I also might have the willpower to try,
but that's all I would ever be doing.
Don't try to understand what this all means.
God doesn't even know what the fuck I just said.
So, why did I bother speaking my mind?
Maybe because I wanted to see how many of you are trying too.
It's lonely trying, and it's possibility that you're the one that wants to 
 try with me?
Trying is one of those things you can't do alone.
Do it with, for and alongside me.
Please try...
