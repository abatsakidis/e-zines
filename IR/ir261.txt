you mothered me just once
the pain was unbearable
i can't apologize enough
you died during child birth
   this was lifetimes ago
   some hundred years back
     before we ever knew each other
     this was the first time we met
but i'll hurt you again
maybe in another hundred years.
i can't apologize enough.
  so this is my punishment
stuck just right here
i know you recognize me
how could you not?
  i'm right in front of you
   don't look away
i'm still lost without you
just like before
  3 hours old, without a mother
  20 years old, without another
       person here with me
i don't expect much
just a look to let me know
some decades later
we could have been lovers
we still could be now
 but i'll hurt you again
and you see it in my face
 don't look away from me.
