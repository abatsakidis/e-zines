It was a plain day long before I knew how to drive.
I walked past lights that were blinding me.
As I looked closer, I realized I knew the car
And grew afraid of what I might then see.

It was her car, a very close friend.
She must have been on her way home.
I ran and my lungs ached; still I screamed.
She pointed at me, knowing she was not alone.

I lost my mind as she floated in a crimson pool.
"Let me through ... I know this girl!"
I fell to my knees and ruined my jeans.
But nothing else mattered in the world.

Katie why did you not see the fast red car?
Look into my eyes my friend, "You're not alone anymore."
She did not cry. Her blue eyes remained clear.
I held her hand, into my flesh her nails tore.

She was held still and moved by strange men.
I promised I would never let go of her hand, I would stay.
I was afraid but I smiled my love to her.
I could to sit by her side, if I was out of the way.

Something was placed over her face.
I could her breathe so loudly.
We stared at each other; she mumbled, "I see it's soon."
She said as if begging, "Pray with me."

She mentioned light, and held tighter to my hand.
I prayed my Mother's Christian prayer.
No one else could see, but I could feel:
Someone waiting for her, was there.

I kept my promise to her.
For it was she who let go of me that day.
The rattle of her breath ... her eyes went blue to black.
I knew she was leaving me before she was away.

I held onto the hand that let go so lifelessly.
I waited to cry. I did not want her soul to see my weeping.
I was pushed aside by men who tried to bring back the light.
A part of me whispered, "It's as if she's sleeping."

I was meant to walk around the block a different way.
To be there, a friend by your side
Happy Birthday Sweet Katie.
I felt Angels near the day you died.
