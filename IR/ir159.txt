Ever rising the blistering heat
Of the wax and red-blue fire
Melt my soul, burn my heart
A cinder of my former desire

Blacken my fingers, my world
Soot my vision and my touch
Burning the flame, burning me
Smothering, it hurts too much

Smoke rise and blur my eyes
Fire burn and kill my nerve
Hazy I stand with this pyre
The fire is that which I serve

Melting from the heat
I reach out to you
If you would then touch me
As I have, so will you

Twin flames, dancing fire
Lost within its heat
Melt, blacken, surrender
In fire's victory and colds defeat.
