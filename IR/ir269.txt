I wanted to express my thoughts 
In a poem about a man I know.
I wanted to say things are wonderful
And I hope the friendship does grow.

I wanted to express my feelings 
In a poem from the depth of my heart.
I wanted to say such things of beauty
And I hope to never be torn apart.

I wanted to express from my soul
In a poem about luck and chance
I wanted to say things beyond me
And I hope to be lead in a dance.

I wanted to express my own flesh
In a poem of contemplations
I wanted to say such things, even unknown...
And would I risk the complications?

I wanted to express my view of him
In a poem the world could read
I wanted to say such things, everything
But for such expression there is no need.
