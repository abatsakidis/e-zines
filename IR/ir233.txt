	My online idols.

	It's funny, how they keep me warm, when they push me into the cold.
I want to be just like them, because I respect them.  Because I'm human.
	Is it really so wrong?  When you don't respect yourself, why not
change?  All I ask is to delude myself, and be happy for an hour.  Not real
happiness, no.  But it might be close.  I'm not sure.

	When I try to seperate myself from them, to become independant, I
fade even more.  If blending in is a science, then seperating yourself is an
art.  Your counter-culture gods are impossible to live up to.  They tell you
how to be anti-hip, and socially un-acceptable.  But you can't live up to
their expectations.

	I'm not accepted or un-accepted.  Everything I do is judged by
everyone else, criticized but never good enough.

	I just need a little respect.
	I guess I'm already just a little fucking sheep.
