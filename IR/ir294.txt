  thick dreams
  with a pale experience
  and every whispered
   "i love you"
  you'll never hear.
  i don't even feel
   sympathetic
    to your complaints
    anymore,
  you're somewhere
  where you shouldn't be.
  and every whispered
   "i love you"
  that will never be returned,
  my dreams are thick
   and you just make them worse.
