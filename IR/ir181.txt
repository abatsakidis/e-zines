 The world is a beautiful place. With shining plateaus
 and rivers flowing at their own pace.
 The world is full of
 corrupted children
 racist faces
 hateful heroes
 impoverished and poor
 unhealthy and untrue
 and healthcare doesn't care
 and leaders don't care
 and criminals don't care
 and we the people, in order to form a more perfect union don't care
 silenced voices cry out in our streets
 for  a saving grace from shaving their lives away with,
 needles a mile long
 with death rivers in their veins.
 children working in sun dried fields
 that bake their backs, while they pick your food
 and you eat it, and love it, and don't even  think it
 that it could've been you out in those fields
 and we the people, in order to form a more perfect union don't care
 and we the defenders of human rights don't care
 and we the ambassadors to the world don't care
 because it doesn't hurt us, it doesn't harm us
 we don't pick our food, we don't make our cars
 we let others toil in labor, while others 
 enjoy the materialist syntheticistic pleasures enjoyed by few, denied to
   all
 and no one seems to care
 and no one seems to flinch
 and all of us sit as golden stone statues in this statue garden
 and call it life
 and we the people, in order to form a more perfect union, don't care
 The world is beautiful, and we watch it mesmerized, and we the people in 
   order to form a more perfect union don't care to see beneath.
