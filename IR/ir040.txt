	A while ago I decided it would be a fun idea to interview nawleed of
Impulse Reality fame. He seemed like a fun-loving guy, so I proceeded - But
to my shock and horror, nawleed was not the happy-go-lucky soul his lovable
text files made him out to be. The following is the AIM log of what happened
when I attempted an interview with the monster who is nawleed...


its linear: So nawleed, how did you get invloved with Impulse Reality?

nawleed: dude fuck this shit NO INTERVIEWS. I said NO INTERVIEWS dammit!

its linear: How do you see the textfile scene as a whole?

nawleed: god FUCK YOU go away

its linear: Do you see much of a future for the textfile scene? Or is Impulse
            Reality sort of the "last wave"?

nawleed: FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP ARaGaeTaHRE@#R@Q#RT

nawleed: asshole.

its linear: Are you happy with the current state of affairs within Impulse 
            Reality?

nawleed: yes. :)

its linear: How would you describe your personnal writing style?

nawleed: I would describe my personal writing style as fuck you, stop asking 
         me questions.


its linear: Really? how old were you when you first got into what some might 
            consider the "computer underground"?

nawleed: FUCK YOU MAN

nawleed: JUST FUCK YOU

nawleed: STOP ASKING ME QUESTIONS

its linear: What drew you to this scene?

nawleed: seriously linear, stoppit. I mean it this time.

its linear: What started you writing for such projects as "Impulse Reality"? 
            Was it the idea of being able to reach hundreds of people in a 
            way that only technology can allow us?

nawleed: AAARGH!@#!1

nawleed: now you're just doing this to piss me off.

nawleed: aren't you?

its linear: Do you respect your peers within the "scene"?

nawleed: only when they don't ask me dumb questions that I don't want to 
         answer

nawleed: .

its linear: Are there any other text-based 'zines that you enjoy?

nawleed signed off at 5:32:58 PM.
