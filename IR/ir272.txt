A cold night's air,
You whisper a phantom,
You're trying to fight,
That which was never there
Everything mattered to you,
Nothing to her.

You blindly journey through nowhere
For a treasure that isn't there
A treasure you could never have
The closer you get,
The more you want
You'll only ruin yourself this way

So many days to waste,
So much regret to taste.
You don't have to continue like this,
Accept things the way they are...
She's offered her hand of friendship.
What we all should learn is this,
You should take what you can get.
Give; and do not expect anything back.

You've got everything that matters,
And you keep going on this hopeless trek.
You're in for a long ride,
One to 'cause you pain
And one that will show you what you gain.

She knows what she's doing,
You can't control her actions
All you should do, is be there.
Don't force it;don't block it.
She cares about you, you care about her,
And that's all there is to it.


Friendship lasts longer then things we mistakenly perceive as Love.
