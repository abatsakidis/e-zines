His parents are both stock brokers and he's an only child.  He's 
a spoiled rotten rich prick of a dork with the nose of a Jew and 
the voice of a coniving rat.  There's no question: he _knows_ 
everything.  He's a little bitch that kept asking me what class 
rank I am.  He then gloated over his fifth of an advantage over 
me that has him as 13th (I am 14th).  Like that really fucking 
matters.  He's made friends with the two Vietnamese twins... these 
three all sit on the first row alongside me and my friend Abby.  
One of the twins sits beside me... he's always in awe of all the 
things I have on the table... weirdo .oO(and this is the guy that's 
2nd in rank? what a dork! hehe  ;o)  he's okie though...  

but we're talking about Danny... the weasel..   So I've been back in 
school for 3 weeks now, and just this past Thursday I had a physics lab 
write-up due on this class experiment we performed.  Our instructor was 
planning on grading them on a 'ranking scale' where all the lab write-ups 
are compared to one another.  He didnt give us any particular fashion or 
format to follow.  He wanted to see what developed and how we'd use our 
creativity.  [key word there... creativity...]  Abby and I formed an 
alliance and added a couple guys we'd thought would be valuable assets 
to the group.  Danny formed up with the twins.  

So there they were a day before it was due, gloating about they're 
"Powerpoint Presentation" that they made... HAHAHAHAHA what a fucking
joke!! omg Abby and I _Knew_ we were going to kick his butt!!  So they 
had it finished early and brought it to school on a floppy.  For some 
reason the disk was corrupt (so they say) and they destroyed it.  Dumbasses.
Thursday before class started they were parading their ripped cd containing 
their "powerpoint presentation."  If that was not the biggest waste of time
and space I've ever seen... *shakes head...*  It was thoroughly amusing to 
see Danny walk past us polishing the cd.  *sighs*  stupid boys... when will
they _ever_ learn....

I knew they lacked skills like Abby and I possess.  hehehe (:  Abby has Flash
skills.  I learned how to use Dreamweaver so I could quickly put up a page.
Needless to say, *our* webpage kicked their Powerpoints ass! (:  We went 
first with our presentation of humorous flash antics and smoothly written 
(by yours truly) lab write-up.  (:  Victory was ours.  Danny came up and 
inquired as to what I used to make the page... he listed a few things I cared
not to pay attention to... among them he listed "MS Frontpage"... Abby and I 
scoffed and made it clear we detested such a preposterous mockery of talent!!
Bwahahahhaha!! 

Because Danny lives so close to Abby... in the same neighborhood in fact!  We
thought it would be nice if Danny was visited by a couple dozen eggs one 
night. (: Who knows, he might like it.  But we thought it was about damn time
he got the experience. (:
