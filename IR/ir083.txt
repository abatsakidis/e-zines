Why do I get the feeling that we've met before?
All washed up, dirty, and poor....
I'm slowly dying but yet somehow I have the strength to go on..
What about us being together has to be so wrong?

Into the dark I must go...
If you pull the trigger we will never know
I look deeper into the bottle
Only to realize I've fallen in and never will return
There is too much about me that you could possibly want to learn

[Chorus]
Life is shit until you die
Can't you understand that it isn't a lie?
Why is so hard for me to let go?
The path we choose is the one we know
[End Chorus]

I got drunk last night and got into a fight
As fucked as it seems it feels so right
Even though I'm in extreme pain you seem not to care
Why must things always be so unfair?
