	Suddenly he felt light-headed, as if he was going to faint. Instead,
he sat down on his bed and vomitted. Normally, having vomitted on his own 
bed, he would have become enraged with anger (and rather disgusted). But 
today, chris's head was in such a mess, that he hardly grasped the fact that
he just threw up.

	Chris got up from his bed and left the room. He opened his front door
and walked outside. he stared at the busy street in front of his house. Chris
picked up a rock and threw it.

	The rock unintentionally headed in the direction of a passing-by car.
Fortunately, the window was open. The rock flew into the window, hit the 
driver's-sides seat, and bounced to the vehicle's floor.

	The driver didn't notice. She happened to be drunk and focussing all
of her attention on a song that was spewing out of her radio, instead of 
paying attention to the road and her driving. This is when she hit a curb,
lost control, and crashed into a house.

	No one was home, but someone had left the television on.

	On the TV, a man in his mid-thirties had just won the grand prize on
some over-rated quiz show. When asked what he was going to do with the money,
het muttered something about travelling and paying off his father's bills.

	His father had been watching, but missed his son's moment of glory:
Just before his son gave his final answer, the father's heart seized.

	He managed to stumble to the telephone, dial 911, and gasp out a few
words before collapsing onto the floor.

	The ambulance arrived 23 minutes later, 21 minutes too late.

	As the driver of the ambulance looked at the elderly man, who 
apparently lived all alone in his tiny apartment, he was reminded of his own 
mother. She, much like the old man who lay dead on the floor, was elderly and
alone. He felt guilty... It had been over eight months since last he talked 
to her.

	When he got off work, he dialed the numer to his mother's house. 
There wasn't an answer - she wasn't home.

	She was next-door babysitting a neighbor's daughter.

	Her neighbor was at a doctor's office getting a check-up. Right now,
a nurse was breaking the bad news to her - the blood sample had shown that 
her patient had lung cancer.

	The nurse had lost a very close relative to cancer, and days like 
these never failed to remind her of him.

	When she came home that night, she walked through the door crying.

	Her husband, understandably alarmed, rushed over to her to ask what
what was wrong. After of being informed of what was troubling her, though
still feeling empathetic towards his wife, he was rather relieved. He feared
she had found out about the affair he'd been having with a young college 
student.

	The college student was a 19-year-old manic-depressive. Unbeknownst
to her married boyfriend, the cops had found her dead in her dorm room 
earlier today. Suicide.

	the cop who had discovered her had the unpleasent task of alerting 
her nearest relative of the tragedy.

	He called her brother, living twelve miles away.

	"Hello?"

	"Hello," the policeman said uneasily. "This is Deputy Sherman from 
the Topeka Police Department..."

	He continued to explain to her brother what had happened.

	Her brother dropped the phone.

	Suddenly he felt light-headed, as if he was going to faint. Instead,
he sat down on his bed and vomitted. Normally, having vomitted on his own 
bed, he would have become enraged with anger (and rather disgusted). But 
today, chris's head was in such a mess, that he hardly grasped the fact that
he just threw up.
