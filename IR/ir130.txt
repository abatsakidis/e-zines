 [note: neither the author, nor IR, promote school shootings. obviously.]

So theres beem alot of school
shootings lately and it really got me
thinking... and well to be honest its
kinda good to see the outcasts striking
back. Dont get me wrong i dont think the
way these people were going about it is
right. killing is never justified. NEVER.
but i can sorta see where there coming from
all the school shootings whithin the last
two - three years have been done by outcasts
striking back at people who made fun of them
because they were diffrent. can you blame
them? these people were tourmented every
day of their life, for no good reason.
i cant speak for all of them but the
sernario is almost always the same;
kid likes to dress difrent, kid dosent
like sports, kid wears black, kid gets
made fun of, kid ignores it, kid pushes
on, kid gets made fun of more, kid cant
take it anymore, kid does the only thing
he knows, TAKES CONTROL! but how do you
take control when your out numbered 1000-1?
hhhmmmmm? well i suppose you'd have to
give yourself an advantege somehow, like
i dont know a gun. hhhhmmmmm well looks
like that would work, yeah that'll
teach 'em. well i cant say what they did
is right KILLING IS NEVER RIGHT, but
what i can say is i can identify with
them i've been there. the only real way
to stop this problem isnt compeletly with
the shooter. rather than blame the shooter
100% why dont we look at what led them
to take such drastic measures to exact
his (or her lets be p.c.!) revenge.
why dont we strike at the stuck up bitch
who snubbed her nose at him becuase he
perfered to where a misfits tee shirt
rather than the latest old navy pieace
of shit, the jock who went out of his
way to hit HIM with the dodge ball
becuase he didnt want to play, the
"art" teacher that never let him express
himself, the redneck that tried to (or
did) kick his ass because he thought he
was a "homo" for not thinking the exact
same way as him, the list goes on and on
but fuck its simple just cut the problem
off at the root - intolrance & ignorance.
while writng the text i got more and
more pissed and thought hell maybe
i could find vengence in a gun,
so to contomplate such a big desision
needed carful thought so i went on napster
and downloaded the movie theme to
halloween (you know the mike myeres one)
and sat in the dark listening to it full
blast for about 3 hours, thinking.
i came to a decison. and i'm not going to
do it.
