I want my own glass of Kool-Aid, damnit
a glass of kool-aid that I can stare into 
and within its sugary reflection, 
see that it was made for me...
and not anyone else. 

greed is the teaspoon that mixed it all together
subliminal ingredients of care were added  
Yet, it appears as though the hearts and kisses
are just artifically flavored thoughts for me
I wasn't greedy though...and look now.
is that wrong?
Maybe it is my fault,
my own mistake for leaving it on the table, unnattended.

Now, I want my Kool-Aid back for myself.
That is why one pours a glass, right?
So I would have something to be happy about
something that would care back for me,
devoted to me.
No. My glass of Kool-Aid is half empty
because others wont step off it..

all I want now
is for him to step away from my half-empty glass 
of girlfriend-flavored Kool-Aid.
All I want now is to enjoy what is left.

Maybe she might hate the fact...
that she has to be consumed by me now
after her other half has been "understood" by him
My chance was taken away though...
Now it looks like I never cared for her, damn!!!
I question myself now...
Who is the greedy one here?
Him or me?
She should realize that I made the glass of Kool-Aid though...
