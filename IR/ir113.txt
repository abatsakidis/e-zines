Blue sparklie upon black, remnants of paint slowly chipping away.
What has become of those chipped pieces?  Where have they gone--
no longer a piece as whole, no longer a piece of me.  Such interesting
shapes the whole now takes.  Strange how one part wears away
faster than another.  These last remains could have easily been
wiped away.  A forgotten task time never met.  So now after a week,
the sparklie blue on black can only be seen on the nails of four.
