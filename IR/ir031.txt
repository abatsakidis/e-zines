          I want to tell you about this guy I know. He's more
          like a drug to me. Everytime I got him into my veins,
          I always wanted more. Now I'm addicted, and he's gone,
          and the price is too much to get more.

          I met him online, he made me feel great about myself.
          Once I got a taste of him, I was hooked. Once I met
          him in real life, I knew I wanted him as mine. Days
          went by, and the longer I knew him, the higher I got. 

          Every taste of him on my tounge, or when he touched my
          body threw me into a world I couldn't leave. I always
          want to hold him tight in my arms and never let him
          go. The only trouble was, I couldn't. I can't anymore.


          Everynight I go to sleep dreaming of him. Thinking of
          injecting myself with him again. How it felt to be in
          pure ecstasy because of him.. Now I can't have him
          anymore, and I'm going through withdrawl. I can't fake
          it anymore.

          My drug is too addictive. I need more. I'm faking.
          Without him I might break. I need rehab. Friends
          claimed things about him that aren't true. My blood
          turned from red to black with him. So rich in his
          posions. 

          When I was high off of him, no one could hurt me. I
          try to get this high from remembering, but my highs
          are wearing off, all I want is to get the high one
          more time. I want to keep him with me, I need him.  I
          can't admit this, but it's horribly true.

          All I want, is him.
