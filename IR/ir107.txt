David McNamara scares me. Here’s why. Dave believes that porn should be 
illegal, along with oral sex, anal sex, Homosexuality, tatooing, inter-racial
relationships, alcohol, tobacco, jeans, The Theory of Evolution and 
contraception. I was pointed towards Dave’s enlightening little site by 
http://www.losers.org. How fitting. You can check out Dave’s smashing work at
http://www.dcmcnamara.com. Have fun, and try not to break anything when you 
inevitably get pissed off. Here’s an excerpt from Dave’s site that 
wonderfully illustrates his views. Original text from the site is preceeded
by a ‘>’ before each line. My comments are not, so don’t your dumb ass 
confused.

Here goes...

>Welcome to my site! My name is David McNamara and I am 19 years old. I have
> 2 cats and I am a senior at Royal Palm Beach High School in Miami, Florida.
>I am still in High School because during my first freshman year, I 
>contracted pneumonia and was gone for about 1/3rd of the school year. :-(...

>I want to ban pornography with a 10-year prison term for viewing or 
>participating in pornography, as well as oral and anal sex with a 1-5 year 
>prison term for oral sex and a 1-10 year term for anal sex. I also want to
>ban the manufacture and sale of contraceptives (birth control) with a prison
>term of up to 1 year in jail and/or a fine of up to $5,000 for violating 
>this ban. None of these laws will be retroactive. 

>I also support a ban on interracial marriage. While I am not racist [Okay,
>sure. -ghost], I believe that God intends people to marry within their own
>race. Any and all interracial marriages currently licensed should 
>immediately be annulled, with any children born to said couple, allowed only
>to marry with other children of interracial couples. All races ought to have
>equal opportunity in employment, pay, etc. Therefore, I believe that
>Affirmative Action is racist against white people and ought to be abolished.

>I firmly believe that sex should be shared with your spouse and that there
>ought be be love between the married couple. However, man and wife ought to
>be of the same color as stated above.

>I am in favor of the death penalty for murder (including performing an 
>abortion), attempted murder, rape, incest, pedophilia/child molestation, 
>bestiality, necrophilia, transvestites, treason, spying against the state, 
>espionage, drug dealing, vampirism, adultery, and armed robbery.

>I am also 100% against homosexuality and I believe homosexuals (including
>lesbians and bisexuals) as well as people with fetishes, ought to be put in
>mental hospitals. This must be done NOW, before they degenerate society and
>our children's morals even further. I also believe ANY children in the 
>custody of homosexuals ought to be taken away IMMEDIATELY, in order to 
>prevent further emotional and sexual abuse. DO NOT let your children near 
>one of these vile monsters! Read the page to get more insight into the
>sexual habits of homosexuals and others of their ilk.

The page he’s referring to is called ‘fag facts’, and can be found on his
website.

>I believe in a national dress code. The National Dress Code (NDC) will be as
>follows: All persons must wear clothing from their neck to three inches 
>below their knees when in public or in the presence of children.	

>Women MUST wear dresses. Trousers are NOT lady-like and therefore, women 
>ought not to wear them.	

>Jeans are to be banned.	

What about my UFO’s?

>Any profanity or sexual references on clothing will be banned.	

>Businesses must comply with the NDC. Failure to do so will require business
>owners tosell their operation to the highest bidder.

>Failure to obey the NDC will be subject to a fine NOT exceeding $10,000 
>and/or up to 30 days imprisonment.	

>I am completely in favor of banning the flawed and blasphemous Theory of 
>Evolution from ever again being taught in public schools. It has paved the 
>way for atheism to take root in this country. It has also lead to Kinsey's
>famous sexual "research" that lead to the sexual revolution. This, in turn,
>has contributed to the moral decay of America. God created man is his own
>image and we must never ever forsake His word. If we do, America will end up
>like Sodom and Gomorrah.

>I support the good moral crusaders in Washington, D.C. who are getting 
>tougher on the War on Drugs. I am in favor of the death penalty for drug 
>dealers, and for a mandatory 10-year prison sentence for anyone caught with
>ANY illegal drug, including marijuana. This mandatory sentence will be 
>required for any amount of possession, no matter how small it may be. This 
>will send a strong, decisive message to drug abusers that their use of drugs
>will not be tolerated by the American public.

>I propose prison reform. This will be as follows:

>Prison cells will be made smaller. I would set this to approximately 1/2 of
>their average current size. Prisoners kept in their cells 24/7 (i.e. NEVER 
>leaving their cell during incarceration). Prisoners will only be fed bread
>and butter. NO contact with ANY other human being during incarceration.
>NO TV, medical care, or entertainment of any sort. NO sunlight will 
>penetrate a prison cell. Disobedient or rebellious prisoners can be beaten 
>by the guards as punishment. ANY inmate that attempts to escape will be 
>executed on site. I will legalize police entrapment operations so that 
>criminals can be caught by police without fear of a lawsuit, as well as to 
>catch potential and aspiring criminals before they actually commit a crime
>on their own. I also believe police "brutality" is blown out of proportion 
>and that mild violence towards criminals from the police should be accepted.

Notice that here he says "I will..." instead "I believe in..." as if he
intends to implement these reforms himself. freakish. You can tell he’s kinda
getting worked up about this as he writes...

>I believe in Singapore-style anti-terrorist legislation. I propose that 
>anyone suspected of being a terrorist ought to be required, if necessary, to
>serve up to 5 years in prison without formal charges being brought forward. 
>This will help stop the wave of terrorism sweeping America today.

What wave, you stupid fuck?

>I am a firm believer in the [temperance] movement. I believe that alcohol 
>and tobacco cause a great deal of problems in our country today. I favor the
>return of Prohibition as well as a complete ban on tobacco. Alcohol causes 
>stroke, and leads to cirrhosis of the liver and dropsy. It is also a leading
>cause of automobile accidents and suicides. Tobacco causes lung cancer 
>(cigarettes) and throat cancer (chewing tobacco) and is, along with
>alcohol, a leading cause of premature death in this nation. Tobacco and 
>alcohol are ruining America and it is up to the government to take the 
>initiative to once and for all take tobacco and alcohol off America's 
>streets, out of our schools, out of our stores, and most importantly, out of
>our culture. In order for these goals to be met, we must require
>all schools and employers to regularly test for tobacco and alcohol, as well
>as other drugs on a regular basis, and report to the Federal government 
>their findings. Any and all violators will be arrested and prosecuted to the
>fullest extent of the law.

>I support a total ban on tattooing. Tattooing is the desecration of one's 
>own body and is indeed harmful. It often causes infections and can result 
>in severe scarring and is very difficult to remove. Therefore, all tattooing
>ought to be banned as soon as possible.

Woah. Fuck personal expression... right, Dave?

>I support implementing a Federal Anti-Vice Squad (FAVS) that will enforce 
>all the morality laws enacted once fellow moralists are elected to high 
>positions in government. The FAVS will have full search and seizure powers 
>and will be able to, for example, demand a spare key from someone to search
>homes for pornography or tobacco, etc. The FAVS will also be responsible for
>enforcing the NDC with patrolling of streets and informants on the streets 
>of America.

>I support Project Echelon wholeheartedly, as it has undoubtedly saved the 
>United States from countless terrorist attacks and helps fight the war on 
>drugs. Project Echelon monitors ALL telecommunications data for suspicious 
>activity. I also support the new Carnivore project underway by the  to help
>catch criminals, including but not limited to: drug dealers, drug users, 
>terrorists, and spies and traitors of the United States of America.

Wow.

Many of you fellow hackers out there may have heard about the NSA’s 
‘Carnivore’ program... It’s a mass email scanner, and is intended to look 
through millions of supposedly private messages for certain key words, or 
‘suspicious activity.’ The blatant unconstitutionality of such a vague job 
description poses a real threat to individual rights... The potential for 
disruption of privacy need not be elaborated upon... That’s a whole ‘nother 
article. Echelon is just like Carnivore, but scans phone systems. All you 
phreaks know the rumors... Supposedly, certain words, or strings of words, 
serve as cues for your conversation to be taped. It’s a rumor, but it’s not
really that far-fetched; after all, the telephone system *is* a privately 
owned utility... They have the right. And the equipment. Continuing...

>I enjoy politics. I hope to run for local office in the near future. If I 
>am successful, I will likely run for higher office later on down the road. I
>will fight as a moralist. I will try to institute the above goals of mine to
>restore the traditional Judeo-Christian values that our Puritan forefathers
>founded the United States upon at Plymouth Rock.

"I enjoy politics." The scariest shit in the whole document. God help us.

Well, I enjoyed Dave’s little foray into moralism so much, I wrote him a nice
letter. Here it is, in its original form.

[begin]

to: letters@antipornguy.com
Subject: Personal advice

Dear Dave,

You're a fucking lunatic. where do you get off with that shit? go get help, 
you fucking close minded homphobic, racist, sexually-repressed and altogether
twisted right wing fundamentalist running dog. You don't know shit, and I 
hope you fucking come around one of these days.

And your jive about sex is bullshit. I bet you're real ugly, and you can't 
get any good ass. or maybe you were molested as a kid. Maybe if you could 
actually find a woman to blow you, you'd change your mind about illegalizing
oral sex.

What's your problem? why do you want to prohibit people from pleasure? what's
wrong with you? why don't you go smoke a joint, watch a porno and get laid? 
Why don't you shoot yourself or swallow a bottle of aspirin? you'll be doing
the world a favor.

You make me sick. your religious irrationalism makes me vomit. go to hell...
Oh wait, I think you'll find that your close minded bigotry and bullshit 
dogma will have earned a ticket there when the time comes, you disgusting 
fuck. I hope you get run over by a fucking truck you sickening excuse for a 
human being. Go fucking rot in hell.

By the way, you're featured on www.losers.org, and rightfully so. You're a
fucking dipshit loser if there ever was one. I would gladly watch three well-
endowed gay convicts repeadetly sodomize you until you are no more than a 
steaming pile of shit, blood and cum. That's how sick you make me. 

I hope you die face down in a pool of liquid shit.

Regards,

Ghost
