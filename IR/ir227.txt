	Neither iR nor ANADA has released any text in a long long time. the
truth is that this war with each other is completely depleting our resources.
We are drained both physically and emotionally.

	But rest assured, my friends, iR will not give up the fight!

	We here at _impulse reality_ have much in store, and the enemy will
be once and for all destroyed!

	Such new weapons of mass destruction include:
                  + Frequent Updates, from now on!

	Well, I suppose that's really the only weapon we have right now. But
really, it's more than ANADA's got.

		Take that, fuckers.
