   intentionally. just read it normally.
       lame rambling department!] 


          Feeling this way has become redundant,
        almost offensively so and to a point
        of passe`.

          Solid ground is hard to find
        these days but the illusion of it
        is everywhere I look - so I
        always fall for it and hence
        fall under. When was the last
        time I didn't feel this way?

          I thought maybe today would
        be that day. I was 
        wrong though - I usually am
        with matters like this that
        matter most (if only to me -
        and sometimes I feel it is
        only to me).

          Sometimes I think that
        everything has become mechanical
        and I have to step back and
        contemplate whether or not that's
        a good thing - do I let
        everything run on autopilot? or by
        doing so will I lose track
        and sight and touch and thought
        of all things worth seeing touching
        thinking breathing?

          Or does any of that sort of
        *stuff* really exist in the first
        place? I'm not so sure I'm
        sure anymore - and maybe I
        shouldn't be.

          I used to be able to
        amuse myself do easily -
        now I can't even trust
        myself - we live in crazy
        times, we do... and I live
        in a crazy mind, you too.
