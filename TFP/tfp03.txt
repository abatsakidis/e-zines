Happier than ever, it's your best buddy KungFuFox saying hello for another
whopper of an issue. Yeah, so TFP didn't die yet. It'll happen eventually, 
I'm not going to make any promises on when though, just wild speculation. 
Maybe Nostradamus made a prediction about TFP's demise. Coinciding with a 
suicide bombing orchestrated by the president of AT&T at a shareholders' 
meeting? See, wild speculation. More evidence that I'm just full of crap.

The HTML and graphics contest I announced in TFP02 wasn't won by anyone, 
basically because nobody entered. That's ok, I know you're just complimenting
the stuff on the site right now. I guess I'll continue this contest 
indefinitely until I get tired of thinking about it or somebody sends in 
something that's halfway decent. 

Anyway, we've got a great issue lined up for you this um, this occasion. It's
another holiday release, isn't that peculiar? We might just keep doing this
for regularity. If you don't get it yet, I'm hinting at TFP04 coming out on
or near Christmas. Crazy eh? So like, happy thanksgiving everyone. I kinda 
mixed this real short welcome message with the Turkey Day fun article, so 
until next time, hasta la somethin.

It's Thanksgiving. Nobody ever thinks about phreaking on Thanksgiving, do 
they? It's all about eating turkey and ham and steak and vegetables and gravy
and all that other jolly good stuff. If you're obsessed with phreaking you
shouldn't be neglecting the phone system, not even for a big holiday like 
this one. That's why I'm gonna help you to give thanks to something besides
corn and turkey, lets give thanks for phones. 

I guess giving thanks for phones shouldn't take too long, just kiss all of
the phones in your house, then we can get to the good stuff. Giving thanks to
the phone company for hating phreaks. Ever used turkeys to vandalize stuff?
Here's your chance. There are plenty of catering services trying to make 
money off this holiday. Just look in the phonebook, or the newspaper, and 
find an advertisement for turkey delivered to your door. 

If you don't have any working credit card numbers, you'll need to find a 
caterer that does cash on delivery. Order about five turkeys, and have them 
sent to your favorite neighbor's house. When the deliverer and your neighbor 
are busy fixing the mix-up, raid the turkey van and get those turkeys. A 
large duffel bag, with 5 double-bagged plastic bags in it will do just fine 
for transporting turkey. You might want to bring some oven mits incase the 
turkeys are still scalding hot. 

Five good sized premade turkeys are expensive, which means that catering 
delivery person doesn't want them stolen, so be quiet about it and be quick. 
Once you've acquired the turkeys, you get to the fun part: distributing the 
turkeys. For practicality bring some bolt cutters with you, to get through 
the locks on the telco cabinets (the tall green boxes). Stuff a turkey in 
each of five cabinets, and close 'em up. Being observant of the most 
popularly used cabinets in your town will aid in making this prank more
effective. 

If you wanna get creative, get yourself a turkey, a container full of gravy
(salted well), and find yourself a nice big telephone cable with a hundred
or so pairs in it. You'll either have to dig one up near an access box or
climb a pole, your pick. They're both a bitch. Anyway, once you get at the
cable, just rip it in half with somethin. For better conductivity you might
want to splice the hundreds of wires you're now looking at, but you don't
have to. 

Put a hole the size of the cable through the head of the turkey, and stuff 
one side of the cable in it. Now pour the gravy through the other hole that 
was already in the ass end of the turkey. Jam the other side of the cable in 
there. If for some unknown reason any connections can be completed through 
this horribly shoddy splice, it's crosstalk city. If you're too lazy to get
at a cable, just throw turkeys at linemen. That better be simple enough.

For those of you uneasy about wasting turkeys, you could opt to take a few of
them down to a local mission or soup kitchen or somethin, but make sure to
at least paper the place with anti-homeless sentiments from the good people
at <telco you hate most>. For example, write up an 'internal memo', seemingly 
stolen from the telco, that illustrates the telco's policy on not helping the 
homeless due to their "worthlessness and general stinkiness". Make sure 
there's a big fat company logo on the top of it. Sample memo:

                               [  BIG FAT   ]
                               [FRIGGIN HUGE]
                               [COMPANY LOGO]
                               [   HERE.    ]

November 18, 1997
For immediate distribution to central office managers

This memorandum is in regards to the upcoming holiday and humanitarian 
efforts you may wish to embark upon for the welfare of the 'less fortunate'.
It is the policy of <telco name here> not to help the homeless in any way.
They are not 'less fortunate', they are lazy, disgusting, vulgar people. By
associating the <telco name here> name with the homeless, we not only ruin
our company image, but call attention to these wastes of space. It is because
of this opinion that we at <telco name here> headquarters request that no
humanitarian programs such as turkey giveaways be implemented in association
with <telco name here>. Thank you, and have a happy holiday.

                                        Yours Truly,

                                        Big Fat Millionaire

        =-----------------------------------------------------------=

This should create an uprising at least, and at best it will get on the local
news and unsettle the moral members of the community so much that there will
be a boycot of the company you have stricken. So I couldn't think of anything 
real good to do on thanksgiving that's phone related. It's not my fault. It's 
the day's fault. Geez, what a crappy article.

                     | Anarchy Day - by Hatred on a Log |
                     =----------------------------------=

I have always wanted to get all the phreaks, hackers, anarchists, and old 
folks to rally against all that is accepted. My only problem was that I could 
never really get the old folks behind me, but now by cleverly exploiting 
TFP's insatiable desire for articles and absolutely nonexistent standards, I 
believe I can effectively manipulate you people to cause chaos and bad stuff 
like that.

My friends and I have been celebrating Anarchy Day for about three years now.  
Successful every year, we always wanted more and more bad stuff to happen,
but we with our meager resources could never seem to reach our goal of 
"breaking everything ever made", as a friend so eloquently put it. Hopefully
with your help we can successfully break everything. We have had some limited 
success on our own though. 

Literally the first year we did it, we took out the power for an entire 
apartment building, killed the phones for a good chunk of the city, got our 
local McDonald's to make a bunch of food for our principal that he had to pay 
for, made a crossing guard piss his pants, stole 5 tricycles that we phatted
out, and we were personally responsible for the heart attack deaths of half 
of a library staff. We live in a mid-sized city, so it wasn't easy.

We originally wanted to call it Bell Day, but seeing as how we did all that
other leet stuff besides phreaking the hell out of telco cans with our bats, 
we went for a more general name. When we go out we still target bell cans, 
payphones, and outgoing phone boxes, but now we also target power lines, 
cable lines, fat people, and pretty much everything we can break.

Anyway, Anarchy Day is June 14. I recommend you get a good form of 
transportation, like a bike or a really fast skateboard. We let my mom drive
us around one year, that really sucked. She took us to Chuck E. Cheese's, but
we ended up phreaking the pit full of balls, so I guess it was ok. Get your 
dad or use one of the prementioned vehicles instead of your mom though, cuz
you can get a lot more done without her. Make sure you don't put your name on 
whatever it is you're riding cuz if the cops catch you and you have to ditch 
it they'll track you down. 

You might want to pick up a nice steel bat, or sledge hammer, or something 
you can destroy stuff with easily (I've found that super soakers really get
things wet!). If you drink a lot of water beforehand you can phreak some 
telco stuff pretty bad by pissing on it. You could save the piss in the 
super soaker if you don't like peeing in public like me. You might even try 
barfing on the telco stuff if you're good at barfing. I'm a lot better at 
eating than barfing, but one of my friends is bulemic and be barfs real good. 

Here are a few suggestions for things to do:

Hate those stupid COCOTs outside your favorite gas station that you can't
redbox off? Call the operator and say "FUCK YOU!" then start running like
hell! This fat kid at my school did that one time and the operator came 
running around a corner like 5 seconds later, so watch out! If you're too 
scared to talk to the operator you could squeeze some mayonnaise packets into
the coin return slot so people will get a nasty surprise when they try to
reach for their change.

For this one you're gonna need some devices which allow you to keep a phone 
off the hook, even after you've left. Get into a telco can and dial 900 #s 
and tell them you just want to listen, and attach the device. Do this on 
about 20 lines, and entire street will be pissed! *WARNGING* don't make the 
mistake of listening to those sex lines too long. I got real into it with 
this one chick that must've been real hot (I knew she wanted me) but then 
this cop pulls up and asks me what I'm doing. It was crazy!

Bring some crayons along and color the bell cans red. Lineman use these
special infrared glasses to find the cans and they only show up if they're 
colored green or grey. You can really fuck the telco up if you color them 
red! Writing mean stuff on the cans like "your mom is so fat she's already 
eaten everything!" to the linemen is good too. I did that once and I don't 
think anyone has touched the can since!

Run amuck with spraypaint. Make sure you spray PLA and TFP all over, along 
with "Anarchy Day '<year>".

Torture your local 7-11. Make sure you go in while it is extremely busy, as 
the cashier can't watch everyone. I took most of these from "How to turn the 
life of a Local 7-11 employee into a living hell" by RedBoxChilliPepper. Poke 
holes in the condoms, right through the box. Put ex-lax in everything you 
can. Ask for $600 in money-orders and lotto tickets and then "realize" you 
don't have the money. Buy as many combination locks as there are gas pumps 
and lock the nozzles down. Pick things up and drop them in the garbage. 

Swipe some post-it notes, walk up to the counter and ask if you can borrow a 
pen (adds to the irony) or just swipe a pen too. Go back to the slurpy/soda 
fountains and look at the names of the flavors. Write new names on the post 
it notes, such as "cow blood" for hawaiin punch, "cat piss" for mountain dew, 
"frosty gerbil" for cherry slurpy, etc., and slap the notes on top of the old 
labels. 

Get in the managers office if you can, and steal the employees' applications, 
etc. Call the 7-11 and find out who the cashier is, then use the info from 
that employee's application to send a strip-o-gram courtesy of his/her 
address and phone number. Sending roses from a secret admirer of the same sex 
is especially confusing. Maybe that unlucky cashier is hungry? Order 'em a
pizza, courtesy of themselves, of course.

Use your body building physique to knock down some telephone and power poles.
Make sure to rip the cables in half, preferably with your bare hands, so you
can make it harder for the repair crew to fix it. Bite through phone and 
power lines going into people's houses too, so they can't call the police 
or turn on their outside lights if you decide to run around nekkid.

Hang posters up everywhere saying something obscene with the phone number of
somebody you don't like on them like "Willie Jenkins is a horse lover, call 
him for one on one at 777-333-4444".

Bother lots of people. Harass them enough so they send the police to wherever 
you are beiging from, and leave. Make sure to chew through the victim's line!

Go to the local animal shelter and let all the dogs and cats loose so they'll
poop on people's lawns. Boy will that be a fiasco!

Burn your name into your worst enemy's lawn so they know you stopped by.

Make a rather long trail of gasoline down a street. Light one end and watch 
the line burn right up. Better yet, put about 7 m80s or something at the end 
of it and watch everyone wake up.

Launch stinkbombs anywhere you feel necessary.

Well, that's just a few ideas. The point is to create anarchy in the morning 
when everyone wakes up.

Something else to try:

For the entire week beforehand call up businesses and have every company you 
can think of go to a couple of houses on major roads. This will also block up 
a lot of traffic the next morning. Try to get everyone to show up around the 
same time, ie: 10:00am.  

That should really shake the town up a bit, and get on the local broadcast
news, not to mention the front page of the paper. If you are successful with
this and get a newspaper article all to yourselves, e-mail it to me at 
Hatredonalog@hotmail.com. That just about wraps up another great article from 
your friends at TFP. Have fun next June 14.

                     | So you're stupid - by KungFuFox | 
                     =---------------------------------=

I know how basic and elementary this information is, but I'm writing because
there is a demand. It's not my fault, it's somebody else's. See, I'm dodging
this one like I'm actually above this article, which I'm not, but I've gotta
posture. If you wanna 'get started' phreaking, and you don't know what the 
hell you're doing, follow my advice. If you're just too scared, have somebody 
beat the crap out of you a few times, or a few hundreds of times, to toughen 
you up. 

Phreaking isn't hard, and it's not something the phone company is gonna track 
you down for instantly if you do it. Don't let them scare you. Despite the 
fact that they make billions of dollars a year or something, they don't care
enough to try and stop you from committing petty offenses unless their 
pathetic excuses for security just happen to put you in the wrong place at 
the wrong time, like if you get hard pressed for access terminals and end up
beiging from a CO (central office (phone company building)) in the middle of 
the afternoon.

Tools of the trade no child of the telephone should be without:
1) phone - $10 1 piece with hangup switch in handset, cheap plastic base
2) 7/16" socket and wrench - $15 (get craftsman, they last forever!)
3) screwdrivers - $10 flathead an philips (just incase)
4) soldering iron - $15 at radioshack, get the kit with the tools, good value
5) gator clips, spare wire - $5
6) flashlight - $10, don't go nuts and buy something fancy
7) access to the internet - home $15, office/school/library/friend $0
8) brain - expensive, you better have one already

The phone has an obvious use in communicating over the telephone network. You
can use it on any access point with 2 terminals, such as an rj11 outlet (the
standard phone jack in your house), a telephone network interface (TNI) which 
is the box either in your basement or on a wall outside your house (near the 
electric meter) that your telephone company installs lines in your house 
through, from a suspended or underground cable, or from an access box (ie. 
binding post, cabinet).

The socket and wrench are for opening binding posts. Binding posts are these
green (or grey) metal boxes around the yard and near telephone poles with 
metal contacts called 'terminals' in them. The bolts on these things fit the 
7/16" socket, and screw off easily, allowing access to the terminals inside. 
If you've attached gator clips to the 2 wires in your cheap phone, you may 
access these terminals much like a phone line in your own home, but most 
likely (unless you haven't left your yard) the line belongs to somebody else. 
The flashlight is good for illuminating the terminals since you'll want to be 
doing your experimenting at night. The flashlight is also good for looking 
through dumpsters for information and discarded electronics.

Cabinets are like binding posts except they're bigger and often times they
have locked handles used to open them. You have to hope for unlocked cabinets
to use these unless you have bolt cutters or a pocket torch, which aren't 
that expensive. Inside these there are multiple terminals, sometimes
hundreds, which may again be accessed with your phone should it have gator
clips attached to the wires coming out of it.

You may need a flathead screwdriver for opening TNIs, sorry I didn't mention 
that earlier. Sometimes there's a bolt on them too, which may require use of
another socket or perhaps pliers, I dunno. My area uses flathead screws to 
hold the TNI closed. If there's a lock or something on the TNI cover you'll 
need to break that off. I've never seen one, but I've heard of them. Bring 
dykes or bolt cutters to cut any 'obstructions' off, and either clip your 
gator clips to the multiple screws inside the box until you get a dialtone, 
or plug your phone into the phone socket (this is known as beige boxing, 
along with the binding post access method).

The soldering iron is for modifying your phone and building 'boxes' from the
information you find on the internet. There is plenty of phreaking stuff out
there for you to read about, including what you're reading right now. This
information is invaluable, even the old stuff. Some techniques never die. I'm
sure you've heard of the redbox, and are wondering why I didn't include it on
my list of supplies. I guess it's because I didn't wanna have to start 
listing boxes. It is a nice toy though, but the only real use for it is 
making free calls, assuming you can even find a payphone that's redboxable 
anymore. There's plenty of information on redboxes, just look for it.

Building one of these will be a lot more valuable to you than actually using 
it, though it's always fun to test out toys, right? It sure is expensive if 
all you plan to use it for is making free calls. Unless of course you make a 
lot of international calls, then it'll pay off pretty quick, but phreaking 
solely for the sake of saving money sucks. Since a tone dialer and crystal 
are gonna run you about $25, it'd be advisable for you to make a redbox out 
of something cheaper. There are a few different options in recording devices 
that are a worthy substitute for an actual tone generating device. 

Inorder for this idea to work, you'll need to find an audio file of a 'redbox 
tone' recording. The most common of these recordings available is the quarter 
tones recording, which as the name implies is the tones generated by a 
quarter (listen real close to a quarter in a quiet room, you can hear it). 
Keychain voice recorders are ok for recording this, though the speaker in 
them is of fairly low quality. Just make sure you don't record the tones too 
loud, or the sound will be distorted and you'll be talking to a real bitchy 
operator about a second after you try using it. 

Never fear though! You don't *have* to use a keychain recorder thingy. You
could use a yakbak. It's a crappy pen recorder thingy. Same principal though.
Or you could pay $20 for a 20 second recorder from RadioShack. Maybe you're a
real cheapass and all you wanna pay for is a greeting card with a little
recorder thingy in it. As far as I know this mythical little device isn't 
being sold by Hallmark anymore, but somebody may have had a sighting of one
of these. If so let me know. 

I sure did type a lot about redboxing didn't I? Anyway back to the soldering
thing. You'll wanna use that for building all the nifty box plans out there.
I know you're dying to make some of them. The experience you get from making
a WORKING model from the plans is invaluable. Don't try using the blackbox
or the bluebox or any of those older 'crazy' boxes, they'll call the cops on
you! Just build them and sell them at school to all the stupid kids who don't
read TFP. If you wanna make a buncha tones (who doesn't?!) just make a pearl
box. The plans are on TFP's site along with all those other boxes. If you get
tired of single tones, build another pearl box and you can make dual tones, 
wow!

Oh, in case you wanted to know all that crap about using a phone outside of
your house is called 'field phreaking' by a few people, and since I dunno of
anything better to call it I've told you this. I mentioned trashing earlier,
but I didn't explain it. I called it 'looking through dumpsters', but it's
most commonly called 'dumpster diving', but damn it's not as fun as it 
sounds. Rewarding though. Rather than me writing about dumpster diving again,
I think it'd be best if you just read the bottom stuff in my article in TFP01
called "Finding Numbers". 

I haven't mentioned anything about the hacking aspect of phreaking, as in
calling up switches and accessing/modifying the databases contained within.
This isn't something you start phreaking by doing. It's something down the
road quite a ways, assuming you aren't already proficient at breaking into
systems and using unix variant operating systems. The stuff below this point
is being included because it's somewhat relevant and I don't think I could
put it in a stand-alone article, so here goes.

http://www.hackershomepage.com/section1.htm is the biggest ripoff on phreak
related supplies ever. I was just recently alerted to this site by overdub, 
and I have no choice but to inform you people who aren't yet informed about 
the actual cost of the goods they sell. All of the box plans, kits, and built 
models are 3 to 5 times as expensive as if you just bought the parts from 
RadioShack and used the plans you can find everywhere on the internet.

Their redbox conversion stuff will cost you $95 from their site. Buy the tone 
dialer at RadioShack, get the crystal from mouser electronics 
(www.mouser.com), and you'll pay $25, including the $0 for the redbox plans 
available widely on the internet (on our site too). 

Their 'digital keychain recorder' is $28, but is available at RadioShack as 
well as most toy stores for about $15. 

That hold button will cost you about $4 including the gas money to drive to
RS and get the parts, not the $50 that you have to pay on that stupid page.

You can get a good quality dtmf decoder from JDR Microdevices (1800-538-5000, 
ask for a catalog) for $30, not the ridiculously high $170 that 
'hackershomepage' sells it for.

Their goldbox will run you $125, but you can get the plans online for free 
and the parts will cost you $15 tops at RadioShack. 

They don't even mention that the blast box doesn't work on the modern 
American phone system. It's $75 too, which is about $60 more than you need to
pay.

The 'highway box' they sell for $70 is nothing more than a tonedialer played
before the autodialer feature in courtesy phones can dial. That'll run you
$23 at radioshack. Just hold down a button on the dialer and lift the handset
while holding the speaker of the dialer to the mic of the handset. Then dial
away.

| Phreaking in School (Phreakir en la Escuela, for amigos) - by AgentOrange |
=---------------------------------------------------------------------------=

Not to state the obvious, but school is boring as shit! You, the student, 
don't have to take it anymore! Even if you choose not to follow the anarchial 
messages of such sources as the school stoppers textbook, there are things 
you can do in school to benefit your phreaking life. Here is what I suggest 
you do to liven up your days...

- Set up a line activated tap on one of the payphones. Students (especially 
if you go to a school that has both boarding and day students where you will 
find foreign kids) like to use pre-paid phone cards! Capture them entering 
their numbers and run it through a decoder later! To prevent maintenance and 
the administration from touching the recording box call the school saying you 
are from bell and you have set up a temporary line corrector on a few of the  
payphones until permanent changes to the line can be made. Make sure to stick 
an "official" bell logo on the box!

- In the five minutes between class if you pass a payphone exchange scan 1 or 
2 or even 3 numbers. Keep a tally sheet in your binder, and if anyone asks 
who you are calling tell 'em to fuck off...or if detention at your school 
sucks then tell them your calling your mom to let her know that the whatever 
club meeting had been cancelled and that you need to be picked up earlier.

- One of the easiest (and most amusing) things you can do is to sketch comics 
of operators killing themselves because of the unrelenting prank callers, or 
lineman bloopers. This has kept me amused in class for months now!
 
- Call a FREE 800 fax-back number and make EVERY phone in the school ring! 
EVERY office phone, pay phone, ALL of 'em! Make all your teachers home phones 
ring!

- Attach the personal use phones in the teachers lounge to a radio 
transmitter and listen to the calls on small headphones during class. Make 
sure to have paper ready to take notes.

I hope this keeps you busy during those neverending school days. Let me know 
what you find by mailing me at <AgentOrange301@yahoo.com> Phreak out!

           | Teleconferences for the mentally deficient - by jlb |
           =-----------------------------------------------------=

Setting up teleconferences is a good way to prove to all those mean people on
IRC that you really are elite.  

"Why do I want a teleconference?"

1. Because they're neat.  
2. Because you can prove to all those mean people on IRC that you really are 
   elite.
3. It's not like you're doing anything worthwhile anyway, loser.
4. Because sometimes chicks come on and you can ask them those embarrassing
   questions you always wondered about but were afraid to ask. Experienced 
   teleconferencers suggest asking about masturbation habits and feminine 
   products.
5. It's free. Just go do it.

"That's all well and good, but how do I get a teleconference?"

1. Some COCOTs aren't set up very well and you can bill teleconferences 
   (among other things) to them.  
2. The elite beige box techniques that KungFuFox outlined in TFP02 can again 
   become useful. Use your beige box skills to make a teleconference.
3. See that Mcdonald's? Go get a job there, in a month or so you can pay for 
   a *real* *legal* teleconference. 

"That operator is mean, how do I make her conf me?@#%"

1. Always think you're the trustworthy business person. She's the evil 
   operator who isn't being helpful.
2. Remember -- Don't give your real name! Although she will ask for your 
   name, you're doing bad stuff, remember?  
3. If all else fails, hang up and call back to get a different operator.
4. Acting really stupid and confused (which shouldn't be hard for you, if you 
   need this article) and asking lots of questions about the teleconferencing 
   service is more convincing then spouting off "I need a dialin teleconf 
   from 0800-1400PST with 15 ports, bitch."

"Now that I've got this teleconference how do I become elite?"

The best thing you can do is give it to all those mean people on IRC. While 
they will act condescending towards you and call you names and make fun of 
you on the teleconference, they really subconsciously respect you. Really.

A few tips for while you're on the teleconference:

1. As much fun as it is, playing with the phone keys and playing songs
   with them is generally not appreciated.
2. Playing your redbox tones to the conference does not impress people.
3. Playing your elite collection of wav files for mIRC to the conference
   is yet another way to not impress people.
4. Damnit! Put the fucking redbox DOWN.
5. Talking about how drunk/stoned/wasted you are isn't interesting. Stop it.

 Congress Plans To Revisit Telecom Act Next Year 

 WASHINGTON, DC, U.S.A., 1997 NOV 7 (NB) -- By Bill Pietrucha, Newsbytes. The 
 Telecommunications Act of 1996 II will be playing early next year at a 
 Congress near you, with US Senators John McCain (R-Arizona) and Conrad Burns 
 (R-Montana) playing major, if not leading, roles. 

McCain, chairman of the US Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation 
Committee, and Burns, chairman of the Committee's communications 
subcommittee, told reporters at a press briefing they would focus their 
attention early next year on the implementation of the Telecom Act. 

"Given the historic and encompassing nature of the Telecommunications Act of 
1996, it is critical that the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) 
implementation of the Act be in accordance with the intent of Congress," 
Burns said. 

In a letter to McCain, Burns followed up on his concerns, offering his 
subcommittee "as the appropriate forum to hold a series of oversight hearings 
on the implementation of the Act" in the second session of the 105th 
Congress. 

Burns told McCain he is "particularly concerned that the actual distribution 
of universal service funds be done in an efficient manner as possible, so 
that funds are not mired in complex bureaucracies." 

The communications subcommittee chair said he is "very distressed" that the 
organizational structure of groups formed by the FCC to deal with universal 
service is "vague and overly complex, and may thwart the intent of Congress." 

McCain first voiced his interest in reexamining the Telecom Act last 
September, when he told a roundtable of the United States Telephone 
Association that he will do "whatever is necessary to fix the problems that 
currently exist." 

"The fundamental problem with Telecom Act implementation to date is that 
regulation just isn't in sync with reality," he said. 

"We must stop trying to federally micromanage the way to `fair' competition 
for the benefit of industry, and instead create a minimalist, federal/state 
blueprint for marketplace competition for the benefit of consumers," McCain 
said, noting that he looks forward "to hearing the views and suggestions of 
everyone who wants to work with me in achieving that goal." 

David Markey, BellSouth vice president governmental affairs, agreed with 
McCain and Burns that "it is time for a close look at the delay in bringing 
the benefits of the Telecom Act to consumers." 

"Congress needs to use its authority to bring Congressional intent into sharp 
focus as soon as possible," Markey said, "because the FCC and the Department 
of Justice are not reflecting what Congress intended when it passed the Act." 

Earlier this week, BellSouth Vice President Mark Feidler told a US House of 
Representatives Judiciary Committee oversight hearing on antitrust 
enforcement activities that Congress should "aggressively assert its 
oversight jurisdiction to ensure straightforward and common sense 
implementation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996." 

At the hearing, Feidler accused the Justice Department of usurping the role 
of state public service commissions. 

"Instead of adhering to the Act, which gave most of the responsibility for 
dealing with local market issues to the state regulators, the FCC and the 
Justice Department have continually expanded their scope of authority and 
given little or no deference to the findings of state regulators," Feidler 
told the committee. 

Kelly Welsh, Ameritech executive vice president and general counsel, 
concurred with Feidler at the hearing, testifying that the Telecommunications 
Act "is a good law that has been thwarted by litigation, regulatory 
roadblocks, delays, and a lack of full competition."

 AirTouch Cellular Assists St. Paul Police in Sting Operation
 
 ST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 14, 1997--Typically, buying a 
 cellular phone won't land you in jail, but for 28 individuals using cloned 
 cellular phones to conduct illegal drug sales, that was the result. 

The St. Paul Police Department today announced completion of a two-day sting 
operation, conducted with the cooperation of AirTouch Cellular, which 
culminated two months of police investigation. 

The sting operation centered around a simulated cellular storefront on Payne 
Avenue in St. Paul which was set up by the St. Paul Police and AirTouch 
Cellular in September. AirTouch provided signage, training, equipment and 
cellular airtime needed to run the storefront. Undercover officers sold 
cloned phones from the location, and in the process gathered evidence which 
led to the arrests. 

"AirTouch Cellular takes the theft of cellular service seriously, and we were 
glad to assist the St. Paul Police in this operation," said LeAnn Talbot, 
Vice President and Area General Manager for AirTouch Cellular in the Midwest 
area. "With this operation we were able to help eliminate two crimes: 
stealing cellular service and drug trafficking." 

Cloning fraud involves the practice of programming a stolen cellular phone 
number and electronic serial number into another cellular handset, thus 
creating a "clone" of the original cellular phone. Once a phone has been 
cloned, the cellular bandit is free to place unlimited calls which are billed 
to the original account. Nationally, fraud costs cellular carriers more than 
$600 million a year. 

AirTouch Cellular is the brand name for U S WEST NewVector Group, Inc. Based 
in Bellevue, Wash., NewVector has cellular operations in 12 midwestern, 
western and southwestern states and serves more than two million customers. 
The company is part of the U S WEST Media Group (NYSE: UMG), which is 
involved in domestic and international cable and wireless networks, directory 
publishing and interactive multimedia services.

 Seventh Successful Launch For Iridium LLC; 
 Five Additional Satellites Now in Orbit
 
 WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 /PRNewswire/ -- Iridium LLC (Nasdaq: IRIDF) advanced its 
 goal of becoming the first global wireless telephone company today when a 
 Delta II rocket successfully carried five IRIDIUM satellites into orbit from 
 Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Today's launch brings the total 
 number of orbiting IRIDIUM satellites to thirty-nine, marking Iridium LLC's 
 seventh launch in seven months. 

The five satellites are part of Indium LLC's 66-satellite wireless personal 
telecommunications network designed to offer full global coverage through a 
variety of communications services, including voice, data, fax and paging. 
These five satellites join the 34 that are now in orbit. 

"Today's launch brings us a step closer to achieving commercial service 
activation in September 1998. With more than half of the IRIDIUM 
constellation in orbit, we are confident that we are well on course to being 
the first company to provide global wireless communications services anytime 
and anywhere on Earth," Iridium LLC Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
Edward F. Staiano, said. 

"We congratulate Boeing on its 250th launch and we are pleased to have such a 
reliable and constant partner for the deployment of the IRIDIUM 
constellation," said Motorola Chief Executive Officer Christopher Galvin. 

The Delta rocket lifted off the launch pad at 5:34:26 p.m. PST. Satellite 
separation occurred approximately 85 minutes after liftoff. The five 
satellites will be maneuvered into their respective positions, enabling 
significant testing of various aspects of the space system ranging from 
intersatellite links to communications with subscriber equipment. 

Iridium LLC is developing and commercializing a global wireless 
communications network that will combine the worldwide reach of 66 
low-earth-orbit satellites with land-based wireless systems to enable 
subscribers to communicate using handheld telephones and pagers virtually 
anywhere in the world with service introduction planned for 1998. 

Iridium World Communications, Ltd., the public investment vehicle of Iridium 
LLC, completed an initial public offering of approximately $240 million in 
early June. Proceeds from the Offering were used by Iridium World 
Communications, Ltd. to purchase membership interests in Iridium LLC totaling 
approximately 8.5 percent of the Company. 

IRIDIUM is a registered trademark and service mark of Iridium LLC(C) 1997

 The Disease of Images
 by David Shenk 

 7.Nov.97 -- Was anyone else made uncomfortable by the cover of the October 
 Wired? The headline "Capturing Eyeballs" - a reference to the grand ambition 
 of the creators of RealVideo - struck a nerve with me. It's not that I find 
 the phrase (or, for that matter, the image of giant, free-floating eyeballs) 
 patently offensive. Rather, for me, the collage powerfully evokes a 
 frightening truth that most of us would prefer not to think about: Our 
 culture is increasingly saturated by a flurry of images created not so much 
 for meaningful expression as for the temporary abduction of people's 
 consciousness. 

German film director Wim Wenders calls this social condition "the disease of 
images." It is the paradoxical affliction in which "you have too many images 
around so that finally you don't see anything any more," Wenders explains. 
"I'm no better. I fall under the spell of MTV whenever I get into a hotel 
room.... We're living in a time right now when narrative disappears more and 
more. And as for images? The more there are, the emptier they seem to be." 

Wenders' 1991 movie Until the End of the World brilliantly conveys the danger 
of image saturation by taking it to its logical extreme. Setting: It is 1999, 
and a leading scientist has invented a camera that can record and replay not 
just images, but also the neurological recipe behind each image. It can 
enable the blind to see what the sighted see, and allow people to view images 
they have seen before - not on videotape, but in their own minds. When the 
inventor's adult son (played by William Hurt) and the son's companion 
(Solveig Dommartin) begin using the camera to record and view their own 
dreams, they become hopelessly addicted to, and strung out on, an endlessly 
intoxicating video montage. 

It's an elegant metaphor for contemporary postindustrial society: a 
fragmented, alienated collection of individuals who seem to continually shift 
their attentions between TV and alternative flickering images - Game Boy, 
flashing billboards, news and stock tickers, and now, of course, the 
Shockwave/Java-charged Web. Meanwhile, the TV itself never seems to get 
turned off, but is instead left on as animated wallpaper in bars, 
restaurants, lounges, offices. Wherever a TV appears, it sucks attention 
toward itself, as though it were emitting its own irresistible 
visual-gravitational pull. 

And that pull gets stronger and stronger as the years go by. These days, we 
tend to think of TV as a dowdy, time-worn technology, but in fact, television 
content has been radically transformed over the last 30 years; the hardware 
hasn't changed much, but the software has become a lot swifter, more dense, 
and more fragmented. Some call it the MTV-ization of television. Most 
commercials and many programs are now built around blindingly fast cuts, 
multiple perspectives, purposeful discombobulation - all of which can make 
television almost as thrilling as playing a videogame. Television has always 
had a hypnotic quality; but the recently emerging hyper-television is clearly 
more addictive than ever. 

Wenders' drug-addiction analogy only goes so far, of course. Never, to my 
knowledge, have EMTs had to resuscitate someone from too many HBO specials. 
My car windows don't keep getting smashed in by people hard up for another 
fix of Reebok commercials. But go to any TV-equipped bar or hotel lobby and 
watch the eyes of those who are exposed to the volumeless TV sets. If 
"capture" isn't the perfect word for TV's hold over these subjects, I don't 
know what is. 

Now the Web is becoming more like TV. Good news for industry stockholders, I 
suppose, but we consumers will have to work increasingly hard to distinguish 
between the moving images that are worthwhile and those that are merely 
trying to Capture Our Eyeballs (which is to say: Selling us something). I 
myself thought it a very dark day the first time I saw those rudimentary, 
Java-fueled, flickering images online. There is, after all, something to be 
said for the unspoiled, static page - be it online or offline. I'm not 
anti-video, by any means. What I'm against is gratuitousness - images that 
quiver simply for the sake of quivering. Hey you! Look at all the excitement 
up here! Slate is a great example of how flickering  eyeball-lures can 
interfere with serious ideas. On virtually every page, insightful, 
thought-provoking prose is forced to do battle for the eye against the 
mightier, flashier advertisements up top. 

In the denouement of Until the End of the World, a writer (played by Sam 
Neil) rescues the woman hooked on images by having her read his recently 
finished book. "I didn't know the cure for the disease of images," says the 
writer, who also narrates the film. "All I knew was how to write. But I 
believed in the magic and the healing power of words and of stories." It's a 
clich, of course, to say that television and the book are mortal enemies. 
But the truth is that prose and moving images can be powerful antagonists. 
Kurt Vonnegut, one of our great contemporary champions of prose, articulated 
this beautifully in an Inc. Technology magazine interview two years ago: I 
can remember when TV was going to teach my children Korean and trigonometry. 
Rural areas wouldn't even have to have very well-educated teachers; all 
they'd have to do is turn on the box. Well, we can see what TV really did.... 

We are not born with imagination. It has to be developed by teachers, by 
parents.... A book is an arrangement of 26 phonetic symbols, 10 numbers, and 
about 8 punctuation marks, and people can cast their eyes over these and 
envision the eruption of Mount Vesuvius or the Battle of Waterloo. But it's 
no longer necessary for teachers and parents to build these circuits. Now, 
there are professionally produced shows with great actors, very convincin
g sets sound, music. And now there's the information superhighway. 

But not all great minds think alike. There's a terrific book coming out soon 
that will forcefully and brilliantly argue against this notion of a disease 
of images. In The Rise of the Image, the Fall of the Word, NYU journalism 
professor Mitchell Stephens (a friend and former colleague) proposes that 
hyper-video images are hurling us into a new cultural renaissance. "The 
moving image has the potential to help resolve [our] crisis of the spirit," 
he argues, "by providing the tools - intellectual and artistic tools - needed 
to construct new, more resilient understandings." 

"Video," Stephens says, "can follow the fitful wanderings of consciousness. 
It can grow surreal, even abstract, and all the while still engage. It moves 
easily, ineluctably to an ironic distance and might, therefore, lead us to 
whatever truths lie beyond ironic distance. It has the potential to open new 
perspectives on the world, as writing once did, as printing once did." 

I don't entirely disagree with Stephens' analysis of the transcendent power 
of moving images. But, all in all, I think he's dead wrong about where 
hyper-video is taking us as a society. If we allow the flickerers to Capture 
Our Eyeballs, I'm afraid our eyes will float freely and permanently away from 
our minds.

Triumverate Of Doom!!!
Submitted by CountZ3R0
(Phreakr217@aol.com)

While outside taking a cigarette break from work at TJ (motha-phuckin) Max, 
the payphone next to me started ringing. I automaticly picked it up, and 
here's how the conversation went...

<me> This is Marty Freeman, may I help you?
<lady> Yes, is this SunnyDale Centre? (sunnydale is a old-folks home)
<me> Yes it is, how may I help you?
<lady> Could you connect me with my sister Doris Hartman?
<me> Sure, hold on one moment while I transfer you...
<lady> Alright, thanks.
(At this point I covered the reciever and laughed so hard I almost cried...
after regaining consciousness I answered in a gravely old lady voice...)
<me> Hello?
<lady> Doris?
<me> Hi, sis, how are you?
<lady> I'm fine. You sound tired, have you been sleeping well?
<me> Oh yea, I'm sleeping fine. They have me on some new medication, it makes
me sleepy all the time.
<lady> What are they giving you now? Did they stop giving you Darvoset (or 
some medication name)?
<me> Yea, they stopped giving me the (whatever it was), and now they give me
straight heroine.
<lady> Oh my, aren't they afraid of addiction?
(I looked at my watch and saw I was supposed to be on the clock five minutes 
ago, so I cut it short)
<me> No, they think I'll die within the week, so they're not too worried. 
Shit, I gotta go have my daily ass-kickin' by Brutus, later.
(I hung up and went back to work. I laughed for days)

PS: I don't know what the Triumverate Of Doom is but it sounds like the 
million other psuedo-hacking groups.

Happy happy operators - by Fantomn
---------------------

Last week I was sitting at the mall waiting for my ride (I can't get my 
license 'til I'm 18. Sucks huh?), and I see a payphone, so I say to myself 
"what the hell, might as well fuck with the operator". Bored as I was I 
decided that I didn't want to pay the full 35 cent fare for the call so just 
to fuck with her I decide to ask how much a call costs. She probably figuring 
that I was a phreak by then decided to play (or really was) dumb and ask "a 
call to where sir".

After telling her the area code and number I wanted to call she told me to 
deposit 35 cents. I replied that that was an awful lot of money for only five 
minutes and that I would give her 15 cents for a minute. 

She being the bitch that all operators (and their supervisors for that 
matter) are, told me to please hold and transferred me to her supervisor, who 
with a cheerful (What makes operators so happy anyways? Do they tap into 
phone sex lines and listen to the goings-on all day?) voice answered the 
phone; "Supervisor Beckie how may I help you?"

After telling her what I thought about her operator I decided that I still 
wanted to make that call so I did what came naturally (no not cuss her out), 
I started acting like I was sobbing, and guess what? No, she didn't hang up 
on me, she put my call through free of charge. Anyway, the moral of this 
story is that "A tear or two will save you 35 cents every once in a while." 

A wise man once said "huh"

Long live the <>R<>H<>U<>

NBC says: "free money!" - by KungFuFox
-----------------------

NBC Nightly News ran a story November 19 on dumpster diving and how valuable
and street smart buying a shredder is. The story centered around this woman
who had been victimized out of $50,000 because somebody rooted through her
garbage and got her name, phone number, signature, ssn, stuff like that, all
from pre-approved credit card mailers, receipts, and that kinda crap. 

It made me think (no, seriously). First off, why NBC was so darn thorough on 
explaining how you could do this yourself, and second, why it wasn't more 
popular than armed robbery. I guess they were being so verbose because they 
thought it'd scare people more if they showed how easy it was to do some much 
evil. Dumpster diving is allegedly responsible for "half a billion dollars in
fraud per year", so I guess it's got its share of fans. Anyway, the point is, 
if you want free money, steal trash. NBC says so.

If you feel sorry for us you can still submit stuff. Less and less people 
just like you are doing it every day! Hop on the bandwagon quick, before all
of its wheels break off! Hundreds of fellow phreaks will see your name in 
print! Oh yeah, don't forget to give thanks for phones and Clifford the big
red dog. See you folks sometime around Christmas. Until then, keep your 
phones clean! Don't eat too many turkeys either. Turkeys are people too.
