Well, folks, I've decided to change the format. You've probably noticed that I've
completely disregarded the margins I set in the first two issues. I'm such a 
rebel, so to all those poseur anarchists out there, THIS is anarchy! Also, I've
decided to make this a PLA publication, meaning I will be dealing with phreaking
a whole lot more. PLA 765! Or 317! Or Indiana! Or Midwest! Carrying on the tradition
of PLA, I'm also introducing everyone's favorite: The Classified Ads, where you 
can put anything you want in them for free! That's right, buy, sell, trade, find
a lover, post a message for the world right here in The Zine's classified ads, and
best of all, it's free! So don't delay, send your ads today! mr_maul@astroboymail.com
Or, if you don't want to, you can leave a message on the PLA Voice Mail Box. Brought
to you in part by me! The other part I just found. One final PLA tidbit, it wouldn't 
be PLA without a loser list, so every once and a while I'll be posting the updated 
list, which should be long because there are a lot of losers in the world. P.S. Expect 
the usage of Roy and Cactus in upcomming issues.

Here's a transcript of me trying to get the operator to dial a toll free number for
me. I didn't say I worked for them because I was challenging myself. I know, I'm a 
loser like that, but I was bored, and there was a pay phone right there.

Recorded greeting: Hello! Operator Pam!
 Me: Hello?
Pam: Hello. Operator Pam. *Click* she hangs up on me.
 Me: Huh. 

Dial 0

Recorded greeting: Hello! Operator Linda!
Linda: Hello, this is operator Linda.
   Me: Why did your voice change?
Linda: What?
   Me: When you answered you were all happy, and then you sounded like you were going 
       to kill yourself. Why?
Linda: Well, that's because it's a recording.
   Me: Huh?
Linda: A recording. It's a recording of my voice.
   Me: Oh...why?
Linda: Because we get about a thousand calls a day.
   Me: Why don't you just say your name a thousand times.
Linda: If you were me would you want to say your name a thousand times?
   Me: Yes.
Linda: I don't think you would.
   Me: I know I would.
Linda: Sir, is-
   Me: Hey, if you don't want to say your name, then why did you say it after the 
       recording, doesn't that defeat the whole purpose?
Linda: (Annoyed) Look, is there something you needed?
   Me: Oh, yeah, can you dial a number for me?
Linda: What is it?
   Me: Do you do toll free numbers?
Linda: No sir we do not.
   Me: Why?
Linda: Let me get my supervisor, please hold. *beep*
   Me: Why?

  Sue: Supervisor, what seems to be the problem?
   Me: I'm sorry, I didn't catch you name.
  Sue: It's Sue.
   Me: Oh. Hi Sue.
  Sue: Hi, what seems to be the problem?
   Me: Nothing seems to be a problem, there is definately a problem.
  Sue: What is it sir?
   Me: Well you know that shady character, operator Linda?
  Sue: Yes.
   Me: Well I called up here, minding my own business, you know, trying to dial a number,
       anyway, she starts bad mouthing me saying stuff like "I hate you," and "You're so
       stupid," and "I should have never become an operator." Then she started making
       fun of my mom. You know, I think it's because I'm white.
  Sue: Well what number were you trying to call?
   Me: It's 1-800...
  Sue: We can't make toll free calls sir.
   Me: Last time I called you did.
  Sue: Well, we can't.
   Me: Why?
  Sue: Because some numbers cost money.
   Me: Don't all calls cost money?
  Sue: Well sir, some toll free numbers charge more than the connect fee.
   Me: But if they're toll free, wouldn't they be toll free?
  Sue: Some people try and do this to get around paying for they're calls.
   Me: That's shocking!
  Sue: So that's why I can't connect the call for you.
   Me: Yeah you can.
  Sue: I just explained to you that I can't.
   Me: You work for the phone company, you can do anything.
  Sue: It's against regulation.
   Me: You can just press a button and connect me anywhere.
  Sue: I can't dial toll free numbers for you sir.
   Me: What if I really need to call an 800 number?
  Sue: Then hang up and dial it. There's no charge.
   Me: I can't. This phone's missing the eight button.
  Sue: Then I would suggest moving to a different phone.
   Me: I can't do that either. I stole all the others.
  Sue: What?
   Me: I said there aren't any other phones around. Not for miles. I'm out here in the 
       middle of the desert in Roy, New Mexico and the only thing I can see are cactuses.
       Cacti. Plural of CACTUS!
  Sue: Well sir I can't help you.
   Me: Hey! Is the reason you can't make toll free calls because so many people have done 
       bad things?
  Sue: I guess that's part of the reason.
   Me: Like calling sex chatlines?
  Sue: Yes.
   Me: Or what I was trying to do?
  Sue: What?
   Me: Op divert my call so I don't have to pay.
  Sue: Let me connect you with security. *beep*
   Me: Why?

And that was about it. Let me connect you with security. Hah! How lame can you get? I 
laughed for a few days after this one. It was the longest anyone with the phone company
had ever put up with me. My goal with this one was to see how many times I could ask
why? When you're going to annoy the operator, the two best ways to do it is to either
play the role of the retard, or the short-tempered angry person. Both ways work like
a charm. Works on all pranks.

I'm trying something new, and I'll probably regret it, but I've set up a VMB for The
Zine. You're all thinking, what's so great/new/bad about that, but the thing is it's
on a VMB that I hijacked. It's on some company's VMB system, and it's an unused box.
Here's the problem: as much as I'd like to trust every single person who's reading 
this right now, I most likely can't, but I will. You can leave a message, listen to
messages, but please don't delete messages, as I would like to hear them too, and I
might want to add some to upcoming issues.
Here's what you do:
			1. dial 1-800-456-4545
			2. press * when you get the automated greeting.
			3. press # when you get the next options
			4. mail box number: 3333
			5. password: 123456
			6. listen to options, and to leave a message,
			   just send it to 3333.

Pretty easy ain't it? Took me like a second to get the mail box, but I don't want to
have to get another one just because some people can't control themselves. So please 
use the mail box responsibly.
