	So what's it all about?
	(Or, the typical 1st issue intro.)		

	If you don't know what a zine is, then scoot your chair back,
	take a deep breath, and slam your forehead into the keyboard
	repeatedly. Like this:
	
	dfi0swd fbyogv76y 0n8atyh34t9f jwbnk90 gniqwuo 0enhaerb bhrn79

	Did the answer come to you? No? Try again. This time, harder,
	and be sure to concentrate.

	089GH39! I0EJQWG5806! H02IH45F0H! 2FH345-89G! 9U23HF89! 2FUI!

	Now look what you did. You're bleeding all over your keyboard.
	Are you retarded? I think you are. You're a Roman Retard.

	Anyway...Coco Puffs.

	The subjects in this zine will be very broad, and most likely
	random.  So basically, we write what we want, and you read it.
	There will also be very few "departments."(You know, the little 
	thingies in magazines that are written by the same people every
	month for forever until the writer shrivles up and die.)

	Enough shpealing, on with the big, fat, meaty, and extra juicy
	part of this piece- o'-crap.

	Uuhhmmuuhhmm... any fone phreaks out there? Here:

	These are mainly for Indiana (specifically the (765) 778 99xx
	area for this issue), because I live in Indiana, which means 
	nothing but corn and cow tipping. Woohoo! I'm also cheap and 
	lazy, so basically I'll be telling you very little of my own 
	discoveries. Alright, they're all for indiana. Count Blah says,
				  "BLAH!"
	
	Modems/Fax machines:
	
	I would try to figure out what which is which, but see above.

	Message machines/ Voicemail:
	
	If I don't have the passcode listed (which will be few), you'll
	have to figure it out. If you do, be sure to send it to me, so
	I can make updates.

			        ++++Red Boxing News++++
	
	Well, I was on PLA's web site and finally got around to burning their tones
	onto disc. I made the CD player red box, which, in my opinion is very
	ingenius. If you don't know, go to phonelosers.org, red boxing for 
	dummies, and scroll down until you see a link for the tones.
	By the way, red boxing DOES still work in Indiana, you just have to do 
	it through the op, which hopefully isn't too bright.

	Here's two of the most vital text files you must have for spurt-of-the-
	moment role playing:
	
	Bag o' Wonderous Items, and Ultimate Bag 'o' Beans, both of which can be 
	found at textfiles.com. I'm not goining to tell you where. If you're 
	reading this, you should be smart enough to figure it out yourself. They 
	are intended to be used with ADnD, but you could modify them to work with
	just about anything.

	Here's a few excerpts:

	======================================================================
	
	   A tombstone springs up from the ground. The only writing on 
	it is "Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust". Heavy dark clouds form in the 
	sky, a brisk wind begins to blow, and a loud deep-sounding bell 
	resonates throughout the area. The DM should assign a number to all 
	creatures with above animal intelligence that are in a 50 foot radius 
	of the tombstone. Then he should roll a die or dice that will randomly 
	pick one of these creatures.
           Within three rounds of the tombstone's emergence, a skeleton with
	a hooded black robe appears beside the tombstone. The skeleton says in
	a deep voice, "For whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee!" and points
	to the tombstone on which the picked creature's name appears. The
	skeleton cannot be harmed or touched, it will only stand there in
	silence waiting until the soon-to-be-fought battle is over and then
	fade away. (Note that everybody hears the skeleton in their own native
	language.)
           One round later, a venerable Shadow Dragon (AC -10; MV 18, FL
        30(D), Jp 3; HD 18; hp 144; #AT 3+special; Dmg 1-6/1-6/3-18; THAC0 19;
        MCGA) dives out of the sky. It will focus its attacks on the creature
	that has been marked for death. The dragon will fight until the death
	of itself or the marked creature. If the dragon kills the marked
	creature, the marked creature (and all its possessions will disappear)
	and the dragon will vanish after making a dramatic exit. If the dragon
	dies, the marked creature's name fades from the tombstone and the
	dragon vanishes. All magical effects that the tombstone created will
	dissipate. The only thing that remains is the tombstone.

	======================================================================	
   
	   A small wooden sign pops up out of the ground. It reads, "Look Up!" 
	Whenever anybody looks up, an item will fall on him no matter
	where he is standing. This effect will happen to anybody within 500
	feet. Also, nothing will happen after an hour goes by. Roll on Table A
	to see what item falls and what damage it will cause.


	TABLE A: Falling Item (1d6)

	1:  egg                  none
	2:  pillow               none
	3:  cream pie            none
	4:  small table          1d6
	5:  big rock             2d20 and constitution check for unconscious
	6:  anvil                10d10 and constitution check for unconscious

	======================================================================

	I have read both of these files thoroughly (well, I skimmed through a 
	lot of the "Beans") and here's my ratings (out of five *'s):

			Bag: * * * *    Beans: * * * * *	
 
	Yes, my friends, they're that good. Seriously. Coco Puffs.

	Textfiles has a lot of good RPing stuff, so, everyone out there reading 
	this, I COMMAND YOU TO CHECK IT OUT, OR ELSE I SHALL BE FORCED TO KILL
	YOU ALL! HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA! *eats baby*

	It has been brought to my attention that there are those of you who 
	believe DnD to be gay. Any of you who think this are actually the 
	gay ones. There are also some of you who say that LotR is also gay.
	Again, those of you saying this are gay as well (unless you really
	are gay, then you're hetero). Even I must admit, though, that I thought
	Sam, Merry, and Pippin were heterosexually challenged, but when I saw 
	RotK, I changed my mind seeing Sam get married. Merry and Pippin, on the 
	other hand, are still in my mind, stone cold gay.

	~^*^~`'~^*^~`'~^*^~`'~^*^~`'~^*^~`'~^*^~`'~^*^~`'~^*^~`'~^*^~`'~^*^~`'

	Well, they brought the drug dogs to school the other day, and my friend,
	Atticus, got busted. They found what appeared to be 85lbs of crystal meth,
	all wrapped in very small, individual wrappers. After taking him into 
	custody, they took the meth down to the lab for testing. They were holding
	him at $25,000 bond at juvie. I asked all of the stoners if they'd help
	bail him out, but they had all spent their money on more meth, so I ended
	up having to ask the geeks. We all chipped in, and it turned out we were
	about $24,980.37 short, so, using my mad skizzizzles, I devised a plan to 
	bust him out. 
	At 3 a.m., some kid, another kid, and I ran up to the fence. I pulled the 
	wirecutters out of my backpack, and when I went to cut a hole in the fence,
	I made the discovery that the "wirecutters" were actually little-kid safty
	scissors. We immediatly went to plan-B: digging a hole. This, I was certain,
	would work. I rolled up my right pant leg, and yes, there it was; my lucky
	spatula! Ductaped to my leg! I ripped it off, along with 5,000 of my favorite
	leg hairs. There's a blank spot here, I'm guessing I blacked out, so I'll 
	go to what I remembered next.
	I woke up and we somehow ended up inside. I saw the two kids (one turned out 
	to be a hobo. Hey, it was dark) sitting around a campfire they had built in
	the middle of the hallway. I asked them what they were doing, and they said
	something about saving some nice, crispy bacon for me, so I yelled at them
	to put it out, those fools, and started stomping it out. As I was doing so,
	A spark flew up, and caught my remaing leg hairs on fire. This time I didn't
	blackout, but I did vomit, which, I might add, put the fire out. Luckly, my
	fire went out once it hit my bald spot, and that was the end of that little
	shennanagen.
	By some stroke of luck, no one had noticed this entire event, and the security
	camera in this hall was broken. Probably happened when the hobo saw it, and
	attempted to take it, muttering something about locker rooms. He soon gave up 
	when it nearly shocked him to death. That made him mad, so he threw a can of
	beans at it.
	Well, we eventually managed to get Atticus out. The details are still pretty
	vague to me. Water chestnuts and bed springs? Anyway, we got him back to his
	house, and I flipped on the news. They said the results from the lab revealed
	the crystal meth to actually be salt packets. We all turned to Atticus, and 
	it turns out he was collecting them from the cafeteria. He was going to use 
	them to salt his driveway because he's too cheap to buy some.
	I guess that's how the toilet clogs.
