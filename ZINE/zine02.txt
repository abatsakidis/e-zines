	Wow. That last issue was a rush, wasn't it? No? Well it was to 
	me. I could feel all this power rushing through my fingers. It
	was amazing. Actually, I'm lying. It was really boring and I'll
	never do it again. 
	
	Well, a lot of stuff has happened since the last issue, which I'm 
	not going to tell you about. Okay, maybe a little. It involved 
	me doing stuff, and then thinking to myself that I won't tell
	anyone about it. You know what? This intro has just become one big
	waste of your and my time. It's junk. Forget it. I promise the next
	issue will be better.

	It all started when I was on the internet, looking at old PLA
	issues, when I suddenly thought, "Hey, why don't I look at 
	some online manga." So I was trying to think of some good sites,
	when I remebered the shirt that Vampyre Prince wore to school 
	once. It was for some site called megatokyo.com (sounds like a
	porn site). I'm like, "Eh, I'll give it a try." I typed in the 
	address and started looking at the issues. It's about these two 
	guys who are stuck in Japan trying to make their way back to the 
	U.S.A. After reading a few, a famous quote of Tony the Tiger pops 
	into my head.

	But seriously, you've got to check it out. It's made buy some dude
	named Fred Gallagher who's American. If didn't know better, I would 
	have sworn it was authentic manga. Another one that's relatively 
	similar is made by this little black kid who looks like Gary Coleman. 
	It's at rpgworldcomic.com, and it's pretty good as well. 

	Uh, oh! Here it comes.

	My rating! 
	After much consideration, here are the two comics' scores:

	Mega Tokyo: *****		RPG World: ***

	They have awesome clothing and stuff there, as well. d0 j00 5p34|< l33t?
	After reading MT, you'll start calling all of your bad days, "Dead Piro
	Days." Read and find out.

	To quote Uncle, "One more thing..." There's a magazine out there called
	Shonen Jump, which I recomend any "real manga" fans to pick up a copy, 
	but if you really are a "real manga" fan, then you should already have
	it. Mmm...Shaman King, One Piece, and Hikaru No Go...

	Thank you, and drive home safely. Coco Puffs.

	I briefly mentioned in the last issue that red boxing STILL works, and
	I think I will elaborate on that subject a bit. 

	Everyone I've talked to has told me that red boxing was dead, they 
	changed the tones, it doesn't work anymore, etc... and I just would 
	argue with them telling them that they were wrong. No one would believe 
	me. Then one day at school, my friend who's now moved, which I shall
	call Fatty-Fatty-Boom-Ba-Latty, brought in a digital recorder. We had
	some fun with it. He'd record (ahead of time) something like, "Are you 
	gay?" And then go up to someone and ask them if the sky was blue. Most
	of them would say yes (except for the Roman Retards), that way when it 
	was played back, It's sound like that person admitting they were gay.

	I had known about recorder red boxes long before he brought his in, but
	I had never thought of it until one morning I came in, and I saw him 
	with Atticus and Vampyre Prince. Fatty said that he was going to need
	help recording the tones, so Atticus was given a quarter, was breifed
	on what to do, and then told to wait by the fone.

	Then the three of us went down to the other fone, which was pretty far
	away, called up the fone, blah, blah, blah, you know how it goes. Then
	Fatty tried to box a call, and the tones didn't work. He tried it several
	more times, and still, the same thing. He eventually gave up and said that
	it must not work anymore. I knew this couldn't be true, so on my birthday
	I went out and got my own recorder from Rat Shack, and recorded tones of 
	my own. They failed to work for me too.

	After all that, I tried to find info on the web to see what I was doing 
	wrong. Almost all of the stuff I was getting was like ten years old. The
	new stuff I did find kept saying that red boxing was dead; gone the way
	of the blue box. I eventually gave up all hope of getting my box to work.
	
	I was really depressed and I mainly just sat around, watching T.V. and
	eatting Coco Puffs. I got fired from my job at Burger King because I
	kept showing up late, smelling of tears and sad manga.  I eventually got 
	out of my rut, started bathing again. I even got my job back. I was doing
	pretty good. I hadn't used or even looked at a fone during my depression,
	until one day, when I was walking at school with Atticus, and he stopped
	and picked up the reciever on the payfone. I asked him what he was doing, 
	and he said he was using the fone. I asked him if he could do that. He 
	just looked at me funny and said yeah.

	After that, I slowly started using fones again. I eventually got to the 
	point were I would use them every day. It was great. 

	I was online, just surfing, bored, when I decided to go to textfiles.com
	I had gotten over my fone handicap, so I decided to look for phreaking 
	groups. I came across PLA, which was nothing new to me. I had heard of
	them before, and I always thought they were like some global l33t hardcore
	phreaking society that had little sub groups set up in each area code
	of the USA (wouldn't that be cool?!? Mass take-over!!), but I had never
	actually read any of there stuff.

	After reading the first issue, I quickly downloaded all of their philes,
	took them home, and read them all. I soon after went to their site, which
	I had always been unable to do before because I tried it at the library, 
	and they had it blocked, and that was before I knew how to circumvent their
	software, but anyway, I quickly discovered the section entitled "Red Boxing
	for Dummies." I just thought it would be the same info in PLA issue #2, but
	it wasn't. 

	It turned out the entire time I could have been red boxing, if only I had 
	known about the mouthpiece filters. You just have to do the whole process
	through the operator. Armed with this information, I downloaded the tones,
	burned them to disc, and made my very own CD-Red Box.

	My friend CooKoo encourages you to all go out and do the same thing. Oh yeah,
	and read the disclaimer at the top.

	I have nothing else to put in here, so here's an old phile I've had for
	a while (poetry?) that I guess I'll just throw in as filler. Enjoy.

	*** 9v busy box ***
	by: Captain B

	This easy to build box is my own creation: The 9 volt busy box. It's a 
	variation on the original busy box, except a 9 volt battery is used to 
	simulate off hook mode, thereby keeping all phones on that line off hook. 
	The line will remain off hook until the 9v battery is removed from the 
	line. To build this, you'll need only a few things: One 9 volt battery, 2 
	fully insulated alligator clips, 1 phone line cord (Can be a short phone 
	line cord, too). 
	
	How to build: You'll first need to modify the phone line 
	cord by connecting the alligator clips to end of the red (ring, negative) 
	and green (tip, positive) wires. My fave to go about this that I think is 
	a bit of an easier alternative is to buy the screw terminal type alligator 
	clips from Raddy Shack. It's pretty hard to go wrong on this, becuase they 
	only sell one size that has the screw terminal on it. (But, you can buy them 
	2 ways- Pack of 10 not insulated. And, Pack of 4 with red and black colored 
	insulation sleeves). The insulation is needed. Without it, you run the 
	possibilty of getting an electric shock when you touch the alligator clips 
	while connected to a phone line, or other electrical source. 
	
	The best way to go as far as a line cord goes is to get Rad Shack's short 
	5 1/4" modular line cord to spade lugs. That's their shortest line cord with 
	spade lugs. (You can go with longer length, or, shorten an existing line cord 
	you may already have if you like.). These modular to spade lug phone line cords 
	have a modular plug on 1 end and, little metal U-shaped spade lugs on the other. 
	Of course, since the color scheme of insulation sleeves are red and black, 
	you'll need to remember that black represents green (tip). Otherwise, you could 
	get the proper color insulation sleeves by buying a pack of various color jumper 
	wires from Radio Hack. 

	The alligator clips are about the same size as the ones I mentioned, except 
	the wires and sleeves come in 4 colors: red, black, yellow, and green. (Just 
	like the standard 2 line home phone wiring color scheme). If you buy that, 
	use the green colored insulation sleeve in place of black sleeve. It's really 
	only a matter of color, that's all. Insulation always serves the same purpose 
	anyway. 

	Now, take a wire cutter and completely cut off the yellow and black wires. Push 
	the red colored wire's spade lug through the hole in the back (narrow) end of 
	the red insulation sleeve, sliding it over the red wire completely. It can be a 
	bit hard. But, have patience and take your time. Once you're done that, do the 
	same with the green wire sliding it through the other (green or black) insulation 
	sleeve. 

	Loosen the screw on 1 of the alligator clips, and attach the little spade lug 
	onto the screw. Tighten the screw down snug, and slide the insulation sleeve 
	over the alligator clip. (Not completely. Leave the metal jaws of the alligator 
	clip sticking out a bit from the front end of the insulation sleeve). Follow the 
	same proceedure for the other (green) wire. 
	
	Now, onto how to use this: This is the easiest part. Attach the red alligator 
	clip to the (-) negative terminal on the 9 volt battery. Connect the green wire's 
	alligator clip to the (+) positive terminal on the battery. Now, plug the other 
	end of the phone line cord (the modular plug) into a working phone jack. All 
	phones on that line will now stay off hook even when they're hung up. The one 
	side effect is that the volume in the reciever speaker on the handset of all 
	phones on the line may be lower. You can also connect up this box at a TNI or 
	Telco can, too. 

	Another variation would be to connect a phone jack to the end of a modular line 
	cord, and connect red and green jumper cables with alligator clips on both ends 
	between the battery and the red and green screw terminals inside the jack 
	connected to the modular phone line cord. Like with a lot of this stuff, there's 
	more than 1 way to go about it. No matter what, have phun.
