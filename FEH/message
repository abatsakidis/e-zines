 	You are likely to go through several stages of emotions at this
 point.  First, denial, then anger, then acceptance that we are the most
 fuxin eleet haxors.  In fact, you better hope we are, cuz if we aren't
 fuxin eleet and we still haxored yer system that means that yer a pretty
 fuxin shitty sysadmin now, doesn't it?  FEH is roxin' the net, tell all
