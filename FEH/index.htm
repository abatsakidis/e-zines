Sharing the unpleasant mid-90's trend of using bad spelling on purpose, FEH changes
its name with every issue, but does manage to throw in some good information with each
of the 4 issues that ultimately came out. The third issue proudly proclaims how much
better they are for appearing past two issues. A good solid read, if intentionally
afronting.
<P>
The introduction to the series is a good overview:
<P>
<I>"Too many people that are in the 'scene' today seem to do nothing but hoarde
things.  Send me this, gimme this seems to be the prevailing attitude of the
day.  If you are going to get on the net and try to hoarde anything, make it
knowledge.  Spend your time learning instead of trying to get toolz out
of people and figuring out who the newest irc chick is.  Sometimes that
means talking to people on irc, but most of the time that means getting out
there and doing it yourself.  Its fine if you want to do the whole social
scene of hacking or phreaking or warez or ansi, they are all different but
in essence, they are all about entertainment on IRC.  But at the heart of
them is a common goal, why which ultimately people are judged.  Which of
these groups have the purest goals?  To have all the warez?  To make the
coolest ansi or demo?  To setup a conf?  No, its knowledge.  And that's
why we are fuxin' eleet hackers.  And that is our ideal.  Now, you may see
us on #hack 24 hours a day, but trust me, we idle a lot, and despite the
fact that we may be active in the 'social scene' of hacking, it is what we
are doing in another window while the irc screen scrolls that makes us
fuxin' eleet, not what we do on IRC."  </I>
