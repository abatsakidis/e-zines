<I>Trip writes in "p0rk was a joint effort by myself and Misfit. we ran the 
group Apathy, which later merged with iCE. We both had lots of friends in the 
zine scene (Mogel of DTO/h0e, Creed of y0lk/dto/hoe, Edicus of jonas, etc), 
and misfit started it. I was a contributor at first, and eventually wrote 6-7 
issues myself. It wasn't a whole lot, compared to the # of releases of, say, 
dto, h0e, or cdc.. but we had our fun."

"i found 2 excerpts i wrote, from which i would like to be remembered:"

Ya know,  there are some ppl in the the scene that are old enough to be dads.
If RadMan ever has kids <sidenote: a scary thought: RadMan having sex>,  will
he be cruel enough to raise his kid into the scene? If so, will he make his
son/daughter be Radboy/Radgirl?  Scary indeed.  Just think, getting into Acid
 because of your heredity.  " Everyone say hi to ACiD's newest,  up and coming
artist, RadMan's 7 year old son, Radboy! " - from #3
<P>
the entire time we were eating that turkey, all i could think about was picking
up that carving knife, and stabbing you in the head. have a nice day. - from #11
