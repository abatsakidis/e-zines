 1.1 - Introduction

 Welcome 2 the first issue of 'Morpheus Laughing'. It has been awhile since 
 there has been a decent au underground mag, and to my belief this is the 
 first that has come along in a looong! time.

 This first issue will be a full version.. i have contained the txt (and 
 fone number) for Telstras FAST and depending on the response i get 4 
 releasing such a number (although it can b easily obtained thru scanning).. 
 future issues will contain more numbers, or may be stripped, and only 
 released to a certain amount of ppl. I would like this information 2 b 
 available to all members of the underground, but due to 'warez kiddies', 
 'code kidz', and 'lamerz' this may not b possible. 
 
 Morpheus will not be released on a set date, they will b released when i 
 receive enough info to compile another issue. If u have something u would 
 like printed please send it in.. or if i have contained something in a 
 previous issue that u feel u should have credit 4, or dont like, please!! 
 let me know and i will make the due alterations.

 Although i may come across as i know everything, i state that i definatly
 Do Not, and dont claim to. If an article has something that is of an 
 importance that has been left out, please let me know.

 Please enjoy the rest of the e-zine and please give me some feedbak.

 1.2 - About ALOC / Morpheus

 ALOC stands for Australias Legion of Cyberpunkz. I started it up because 
 when i first started my foray into 'hacking' and its related topics i found
 it hard to find information, especially on phreaking in au. I would like 
 newbies not to find it hard to find information, but not to be given ALL 
 the information in pretty little programs with big beautiful shiny BUTTONS!
 With ALOC and Morpheus i want to basically push ppl in the right direction,
 make them think themselves, and come up with new ideas, although some 
 techniques will b fully described because they are more than likely easy 
 anyway.

 As i stated earlier, the underground mag scene for au was pretty dead (as 
 far as i was aware of), and so were the groups, and the sharing of
 information. By forming ALOC i have hoped to spread the information, and 
 keep it updated. As many of u know i have had an overwhelming response to 
 ALOC, and it is currently under a MAJOR reconstruction due to me not 
 expecting it to go so far. 

 I have recieved ALOT of emails congratulating me on what i have done, and 
 that it was about time sum1 started doing something, and also that they have
 learned more in 2 weeks then they have in 2 years because of finding ALOC.
 I have also been abused by a handfull of individuals who have put me down, 
 and i feel this is due to their jealousy because they are not the one who
 came up with the ideas that i have. Be it them saying my web page is crap, 
 it has no lynx support (in this day and age, even if u use Linux, u should
 have a graphical viewer, and its your problem if ure to 'leet' to use 
 any thing with buttons on it) or them just bagging me for spreading 
 information. Too bad, i will spread as much as i can with out it being 
 abused... hopefully ;)

 This magazine in its electronic form can not be sold without prior 
 permission from the authors. It also may not be spread via any sort of 
 Public Domain, Shareware or CD-ROM package.

 2.1 - PCCOPS

 Recently, some of u may have seen it, on TV on 'Today Tonight' (i think), 
 there was a feature on a program called PCOPS (stands for Personal Computer
 Outreach Program System.. or something similar). It allows police to call
 up to 900 people in half an hour by doing just one call, and leaving a 
 recorded message. It is used to alert a large number of people at once of 
 emergencies, etc. The system is a computer program, and map co-ordinates, 
 and references, and also area codes are used to select the area to be rung.
 The program which does this was sold for $50 000.

 2.2 - Buying A Payfone

 This article was taken from The West Magazine (Sat).. it may b of little
 interest to most of u.. it goes on about how that dick kevin bloody wilson
 bought a payfone for $150. Maybe we can buy one from sumwhere instead of 
 stealing them??? :)

 = My Last Good Buy - Kevin Bloody Wilson =
 'I recently paid $150 for a second-hand Telstra pay fone (to be used as a 
 stage prop). I brought it from The Twin Towns Services Club on the Gold
 Coast while I was over there for a series of concerts just befor Christmas.
 They paid the $60 to ship it over.
 It needed to be made lighter for overseas travel so on Boxing Day my brother
 Terry and I decided to gut it to reduce the weight. I'm convinced now there 
 really is a Santa Claus 'cos when we prised it open (a trick Terry taught me
 as a young bloke) - bloody hell - $28 in coins (and it's only $26 for a 
 carton of beer).
 There was also at least $10 worth of pre-loved, assorted-flavour 
 chewing gum stuck to the back of the unit. I'm no bloody Rhodes scholar but
 think about this: original asking price $150, less freight $60, less cash
 bonus $28, less chewing gum $10, ACTUAL COST $52. A fair dinkum bloody 
 bargain."


 2.3 - Telstra Will Close WA 000 Lines

 WA emergency services back phone decision.
 By David Utting

 Telstra is planning to close its 000 emergency service centers in WA in
 April and centralize the service in Sydney and Melbourne.
 A Telstra spokesman said the new centralized service would be safer and
 more reliable because specialist operators would handle only 000 calls.
 Perth's two to three 000 operators handle 60,000 calls per month. Currently
 7 per cent of WA's 000 calls are diverted to Adelaide and other places
 because of congestion in Perth's 000 center.
 Nationally, 800 000 emergency 000 calls are made a month - over 10 000 from
 mobile phones. The Federal Opposition has called on Telstra to conduct an
 urgent review of its 000 service before centralising its operation.
 Opposition communications spokesman Stephen Smith said in the light of
 disturbing events in Tasmania this week involving incorret dispatch of
 emergency services after calls to the 000 emergency number, any plans to
 close regional 000 centres including Perth should be shelved until it could
 be guaranteed the new system will work.
 Telstra admitted in October that it could not fully guarantee the accuracy
 of its 000 emergency call system after its 000 call made on a mobile phone
 from the Mt Barker golf course in South Australia was diverted to WA
 operators because the Adelaide operators were busy.
 As a result, St John Ambulance sent an ambulance to the Mt Barker golf
 course in WA, more than 2000km from the emergency.
 Mr Smith said these incidents involving the incorrect dispatch of calls
 originating from mobile phones demonstrated the need for immediate action.
 "When the emergency call system fails lives are put at risk. There is no
 room here for a trial of efficiency or productivity measures. And there
 is no substitute for local knowledge and specialised training," he said.
 The move was contingent on the moLI (mobile location identification) system
 working satisfactorily, the Telstra spokesman said.
 Tasmania would retain its local 000 srevice because only one cable
 connected it to the mainland, the Telstra spokesman said.
 But the WA service would be moved because multiple cables connect the State
 to the eastern States.
 WA Police and Emergency Services Minister Kevin Prince has supported
 Telstra's move.
 "I accept (Telstra's) assurance that they will continue to deliver a fast,
 efficient 000 service for Western Australians," Mr Prince said.
 "Telstra supplies the service and it is their decision to centralise the
 service in Sydney and Melbourne."

 3.1 - Book of Hool

 NOTE: this is just an exerpt from the full book. I have taken a selection, 
 and edited the logs so its in an easier to read format - Phrost

 FOREWORD:

 Think about this: information is power.  Undeniable.  A map offers a 
 strategical advantage. Oh yeah. A map of the internet (haha...nice joke) 
 doesn't exist and probably never will, as is is a swiftly mutating place. 
 Things change too often.

 But if at one point in time a person was to start a catalogue of IP's, and 
 versions and whatever else, that would create power. I dare say that every
 hacker has a similar list, and here is part of mine. A new exploit's been
 released? You just found something interesting and want to try it on a few
 computers? Here you are. This is a gift from me to all the ALOC members, and
 ONLY the ALOC members. Sharing this information (which is painstaking shit 
 to collect), would be nothing less than a breach of trust. (email Hool for 
 the full version and ask him for it - Phrost)

 There are plenty of IP's here.  And most i collected myself, though i don't
 deny that i collected some from elsewhere (if i saw a nice list i grabbed 
 it).

 As I said, things change fast out there, so things may not be correct, but 
 most will.

 4.0 - Phreaking
 ---------------

 4.1 - Phreak Out!

 Telstra bins are like gold. Telstra might not think this but the majority
 of the phreaking community does. A while ago Phrost and myself went on an
 interesting excursion in the hope of finding some Telstra junk.
 First thing is not to expect too much, for we expected to find manuals and
 books and codes and all sorts of stuff that, when you think about it,
 wouldn't have been thrown out in the first place.

 The next big thing is security. Without going into too much depth, we were
 approached by security leaving an ajacent building, even b4 we had done
 anything (luckly they were only security - stoopid).

 We parked quite a far distance away in an old car park and walked to the
 target. It was getting dark but it wasnt pitch black, which was lucky
 because we were stupid enough to leave the idea of torches to the back of
 our mind. The bin lid was open so all we had to do was jump the fence, run
 to the bin, and jump in. We grabbed 2 big plastic bags worth of junk and
 another cardboard box that looked like it had some good stuff in it.

 We carried this stuff about a block b4 we realised that we looked like the
 stereotypical robber - fully black clothes carrying black bags over our 
 shoulder - so we dumped the stuff and went and got the car to pick it up.

 Once home it was like christmas, we went through EVERYTHING to make sure we
 hadn't missed a thing. There was tonnes of rubbish, such as orange peels
 and shit like that, but there was also some good stuff, and also things that
 i cant even describe. We will have scans and digital fotos of what we
 recoverd on the page as soon as possible. The list of accuired objects:

 - Facsimile Transmissions (folded into a paper plane :)
 - Empty Two Pair Enclosure boxes
 - Yellow shop order tags
 - Used Soldering Iron Ends
 - Ripped-up flight tickets and flight information
 - Heavily-padded Boxes from COM10 (Exactly the same size as HDD)
 - Anti-static bags (Exactly the same size as HDD)
 - Information on 'Connector Cleaning'
 - A couple of connectors that had been in the ground for years
 - Packing lists
 - Plastic case
 - IC (APC U42 4B52)
 - POST-IT note with Password and PIN written on it
 - Heavily padded Mother Board sized box with bubble pack and anti-static
   bag (from FIBRENET)
 - Lots of long rectangular carboard strips with numbers and letters written
   on them
 - Tin wire
 - Little gold pins
 - More packing lists
 - Computer printout of reported faults
 - Square piece of paper with an X.25 line number on it and other details
 - White tag indication pair location of the service
 - Heaps and heaps of plastic cable ties
 - Large roll of SIECOR optical fibre
 - Bunches of rainbow coloured coiled wires
 - Heaps of various types of cabling
 - Long rectangular box filled with oily rainbow coloured tubes of plastic
   and lots of white plastic tags with numbers and letters on them
 - And lots of regular rubbish (empty coke bottles, paper, orange peel, etc)


 4.2 - Pay Fone Phreaking

 I will describe two ways in which a payfone can b phreaked from.. one an
 obvious way that a bystander will notice, but you can use this way to hook 
 up a lap top to the pay fone ;), and the other un-noticable. Unfortunately
 the following methods require the keys to the payfone :(

 1. This is the obvious way that will get u noticed. You will need a basic
 beige box (fone, and line with alligator clips). Firstly open up the top 
 half of the payfone, and at the far back of the cabinet where the Line and
 Power unit is there are a row of 4 screws along the top (see image
 morph11.jpg). Now all u have to do is connect the alligator clips to the
 screw where the white wire is connected, and the other clip to the screw
 where the blue wire is connected. Now hold down the door switch (u cant
 close the door since the fone line is comming out of it), wait until the 
 display goes blank, and the pay fone stops dialing, then pick up your
 handset and u should have a dial tone. If u wish to use a lap top, simply 
 plug the jack into the modem card instead of the fone. Using this method,
 u effectively have FULL control of the line. (eg, when the pay fone goes to
 ring the MTMS number, u can interupt it by pressing the hangup button on
 your fone).

 2. This way is a little less obvious, but it does require u stick your hand
 inside the pay fone. You can open the top half about 5cms, enough for you to
 stick your hand inside, and feel around the bottom right hand corner of the
 main board for a square (red) button. Push the button, pick up the handset,
 and then you can close and lock the door. The display will b lit up with 
 a number of options (the first two are password protected), press button 4
 (Tests). And you will be prompted a number of selections, press button 2
 (Calls), and a message saying 'DIAL NUMBER' should be displayed. Dial the
 number u wish to dial. This only works on the standard 8 digit, local call,
 set, ie, no mobile numbers, no interstate or international calls, etc. If u
 wish to make these sorts of calls, use method 1. Press '#' when u have
 finnished your call and u will be taken bak to the main menu. Now u have to
 erase the logs that showed the amount of test calls that were made, and the
 duration of them. Press button 2 (Statistics), and u will be prompted for a
 4 digit password, enter the password (its easy to hack, trust me ;). U will
 b prompted with another selection, press 2 (Erase). It will then come up
 with 'STATISTICS ERASED'. Payfones record a heap of different statisics, eg,
 the amount of $2, or $1 coins used, then amount of credit used on smart
 cards, and in this case, it records the amount of test calls, and the
 duration. By erasing the statistics, it only wipes the test call logs, and
 the others stay. The payfone also logs the total amount of money recieved
 since it was installed.. i have seen some over $1000 000 and even some
 around the $2000 000 mark!!.. so dont worry bout ripping Telescum off, as u
 can see.. they make enough money and can afford it!!!
 

 4.3 - Pay Fone Log Books

 Pay fone log books are stored inside the pay fones, behind the coin system.
 I have come across 4 different types of log books, they are all basically
 the same. The older Telecom ones dont have any technical support numbers
 on the front, which the newer Telstra ones have (theyre are 3 varieties of
 this type.. two new Telstra ones, with different numbers, and one that is 
 a transision between Telecom and Telstra.. it has Telecom written with the
 rectangle and oval 'T').

 The logs are records for when and why the payfone was opened (when a payfone
 is opened, they dial a number, which i guess is a database which also logs
 the above information). All the logs are set out in the same fasion:

    Date of |  Insp (I)  |   Fault   |  Repairs / Remarks  |   Techs
     Visit  |  Fault (F) |  TR CODE  |                     |  Initials

 Date of Visit, is the full date (day/month/year). Isnp(I) Fault (F) is
 inspection of fault.. i have also seen a 'C' written here (very rare). 
 Fault TR CODE is a code such as 'NTN', 'COS', 'CAB', 'COJ' i would say this
 is where on the payfone the actuall fault occured. Repairs / Remarks are
 such comments as 'TKMBZ', 'New MPP installed', 'LCD adjust', 'TCNNN', 
 'TKBBY', 'Vandalized', '40c Upgrade', and 'Coin Funnel Blocked'. 
 Tech Initials are actually a number.. ive seen numbers from 7 to 681'.

 The inside cover of the logs are all basically the same, except for the old
 Telecom ones, they contain less details:

 I have rarely seen a pay fone log book deatils fully filled out.. most of
 them just have the cabinet no. and switch no. filled in. I have come across

 4.4 - FAST
 
 NOTE: there is still alot that i or other phreaks dont know about FAST, if
 anyone has more information that is not here (eg more info about the Sulten
 Test) please let me know. You will be given full credit and it will b 
 released in the next issue
 
 FAST - Telstras Field Test Facility (1800 050 051)

 The main feature of FAST is to test the line, by doing whats called a 
 Sulten Test. This test can give information such as whether all the pins are
 grounded, the voltage of the battery in the payfone, measurement of 
 resistance in the phone, and the distance the phone is from an exchange 
 (down to the nearest meter!). The other test it does is the ring back test. 
 As far as i could tell, all this does is tell you the actual phone number 
 of the payphone.

 To use FAST, dial the number, and you will hear a recorded message:

     Welcome to FAST, Telstras field test facility. Please enter your 
     employee number followed by your pin. (male voice)

 The employee number is 8 digits, and the pin number is 4. These are found by
 raiding one of the Telstra vans, and are usually written down in the
 workmans notebook.. along with other usefull information. The employee
 number and pin are entered in as one long string as digits.

 Once you have enterd it correctly, you will be asked:
    
     If you are now using the line to be tested, please press 1. If not
     press 2.

 Obviously by pressing 1, it will test the line you are using, by pressing 2,
 you will b asked for the number of the line u want 2 test. If you press 2,
 you can only do a Sulten Test on it, and cant do a ring back test. If you 
 press 1, u will hear the following:

    If you require a Sulten Test, press 1. For a ring back test press 2.

 By pressing 2, you will get the number of the phone you are using, and it 
 will ask you to hang up, and wait for a call back with the results. Sum pay
 fones will ring you bak, but not many do. And the only information they give
 you is the phone number again!!, i havent found out what else it does.. if 
 anything. The message:

    The number to be tested is: xx xxxx xxxx. Please hang up and wait for a 
    call back with the results.

 The Sulten Test is only useful if you are actually *fixing* the phone. Once
 you have pressed 1, you will be asked to wait and to listen to the music.
 The test usually takes between 30secs, and 1minute. You will hear a bit of
 music, then you will be told what exchange the testing will be on (usually
 System12) Then you will hear music again. Once the test is done, you will
 hear:

    The sulten test results require interpretation from a tester, press
    2 for a residential tester, press 3 for a business tester..

 Once you select what type of tester you require, u will be put though to a 
 live operator. I have chatted to an operator for a lengthy period of time,
 and he was very helpfull :) FAST doesnt actually do the Sulten Test, and the
 tester had to redo it. The tester said to me 'Yes, FAST is quite
 missleading' Once the test is done again, he will tell you the info i
 mentioned at the beginning of this txt. 

 NOTE - i was doing this test on a perfectly working payphone, and after the 
 tester performed the Sulten Test, he thought the phone wasnt working, but 
 the tests showed everything was.. and he said to me 'So what do we do now? 
 The tests say everything is fine' he sounded quite worried :)

 I havent found the FAST test very usefull, the only thing worth while it
 does is give you the payfone number, and the distance to the exchange..
 which u can use to find out where the exchange is physically located ;)

 The payfone number is good to use for pranks :) 

 This is best used when you can actually see your victim at the payfone. Find
 two fones that are visible from each other (one on each side of the road or
 sumthing), or use a modile. Ring the payfone, and it will make high pitched 
 sounds for a couple of seconds, then u will hear the victim. Say the
 following:

    You - Hi, is Joe there??
    Vic - ummm... no.. this is a payfone.
    You - Yeah! What are you doing using Joes fone!!
    Vic - but.. ummm.. this is a payfone.
    You - Joes behind u, give the fone to him.

 Well im sure you can think of sumthing better!! If u do, mail it to me 
 please :)

 And unfortunately you can not use reverse charges on another payfone :( Now 
 that would of been *VERY* usefull! I have also found out that u can use the
 Sulten Test to disconnect people while they are using the fone (u know, when
 u try to get thru to sum1, and u get the engaged tone.. usually coz they are
 on the net).

 If any1 has any more info on FAST, and the Sulten Test (what it fully does)
 please let me know!! It would b greatly appreciated by me and other phreaks
 in au!!

 5.0 -[ Anarchy ]-
 -----------------

 5.1 - Taking over Big-W Paging 

 Whats that? You don't have a social life? Well listen on eagerly and hope to
 be enlightened....

 Walk down to your local Big - W and look on one of those posts they have
 every few isles... look at it closely.... next to it or written on it
 should be a list of numbers written on it.... If not go to another fone and
 look... - If your getting 3/4 your doing well... Right down all the numbers
 and descriptions and run home screaming - Land rights for gay whales... Ok
 you done that? Good.... now even if you did have a socail it no longer
 exists... *perfect* Amongst the plethora of numbers should be one that
 says.... Paging.... Or All-Store Paging or something very similar - Varies
 from franchise to franchise etc.

 So now ring up the the stores number - White - Pages *duh*....

 And ask to be transfered to Customer Service,,,, And then say to be
 transfered to *number of all store paging...*

 IF they say we can't do that then simply walk into the store and find a
 phone yourself and then press *recall* -number of paging extension* And you
 should be on the air! :) Play Help me ronda in touch tones or whatever but
 if your in the store then get straight off after 10 seconds... quickly look
 for then extension of that fone then get your friend to walk in and hang
 around by that phone make the call get transfered that extension get your
 friend to press *recall - Paging extension*,,,, And run outside and say
 something funny...

 Kewl 'eh? This is the same for all major dept. stores etc.

 Aditional by Phrost Byte:
 Some other suggestions to do while 'on air' at Big-W are:
 - 'Bomb squad to register 5 please! Bomb squad to register 5 please!'
 - 'Freeze!!! YES!! you.. in the ????blue top????? (pick some one). Security
    to  ????(where person is)????
 Also maybe next issue we will have some songs that u can play on touch tone
 fones, eg, Bullet With Butterfly Wings (Smashing Pumpkins), and Twinkle
 Twinkle Little Star.. etc (samples welcome)

 6.0 -[ Challenge ]-
 -------------------

 With each issue released, i hope to have a little problem for you to try
 and figure out, and release the answer in the following issue. Such
 problems will be reverse engineering javascript password schemes, figuring
 out how to send fake email (the REAL way, without programs with big 
 beautiful Shiny Buttons!). For challenges such as sending fake email i will
 give a few hints so it is not too hard for newbies, but some of u so called
 'elite' may find it easy. I have chosen to add this section as i will feel
 it will give everyone something to do before the next issue is released, 
 and so not everything is given straight out to u.


<=-------------------------------------------------------------------------=>

 7.0 -[ Conclusion ]-
 --------------------

 Well, thats it for this issue. Things to look forward to in the next issue
 will be the payfone test menu mapped out, a challenge (most probly a
 javascript password scheme), some DTMF (dual tone multiple frequency) tunes
 to play on touch tone fones (i would REALLY like some submissions for this
 one), and how to put a payfone out of order!!, courtesy of my girlfriend! :)
 
 Hope u enjoyed it, AND learned something...
