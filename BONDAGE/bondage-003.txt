                   a life is nothing
                   to us...
                   we can make all these
                   flesh blood nerves and
                   even a millionth of a cell
                   in our desk-top-drive...
                   these digitals
                   are our genitals 
                   of a
                   cyber-generation.
                   the gestation 
                   of the embryo
                   in this cyber-womb 
                   results into
                   myriad  "cybryonic" wings of
                   colour graphics 
                   in the astro-turf "sky".
                   the lifeless models 
                   are the hounds
                   in chasing the
                   market-wars.
                   the lust is the
                   spiky protien membrane
                   of those retro-viruses
                   called money.
                   reversing the gear of 
                   civilization
                   we gulp ourselves
                   into the ozone holes.
                   that big bang is
                   to be
                   swallowed in 
                   a 'big-wipe'.
                   but we rush in
                   making the sex of 
                   "dollarful" orgasm
                   in this commercial junk.
                   The values and 
                   the virtues of 
                   the human stuff
                   are strewn 
                   to the vultures.....
                   the social fibre is
                   punctured 
                   and ruptured daily a lot .
                   in our playing 
                   the games of life,
                   the killer-instinct 
                   is not
                   just a ball
                   but is itself
                   a goal.

                   The sound of leaking gas
                        nothing to smell
                           but inside my head it's raining
                             zyklon b and cyanide
                   Open my window to see the neighbors
                        making their living
                            by puking up urine 8 hrs. a day
                          into bedpans until unconscious or dead
                            or the treatment troops
                                come in brandishing cc's
                       Then they'd be engulfed in the amoeba-like iv
                            their insides drip away
                         down the gutter and
                         into the sky thru a manhole cover
                           at the next intersection as ultraviolet waves
                      where the sun is dragging
                         a 280-lb. carcass of unknown origin
                           in a green plastic garbage bag
                             across the two-mile expanse
                     ignoring the crests and troughs
                        or car-horns ingesting
                           the stuffing of his subconscious

                   "You haven't taken a shower in four days," she said
                   as green mist escapes from my mouth and nose
                   into the bathtub
                         coagulating into septic matter
                           flushing it down the drain
                       oh they're back in the sockets now
                     as i collapse onto the dirtworn porcelain
                           like a sack of vomit
                      Grab straight razor from shampoo ledge
                         taken to each wrist    zip zip
                           then relax in floppiness
                       tongue deflates and farts an inch
                           down past my lips water still running
                         but the blood's starting to catch up
                   
                   "Oh my God!" she said "You could've at least
                   taken your robe off first! Now how will those
                   stains ever come out?!"
                   "Yagferblt   oh, hello fun...  Just leave me 
                   to my old-fashioned bloodletting
                   and I'll take care of the rest..."
                   "There are barbershops for that sort
                   of thing you know..."
                      I turn over and go to sleep
                        she slams the water off and harrumphs out
                          door still gaping in disbelief
                              while trying to look ambivalent and detached

                   Awakened two hours later
                      by drunken reveille off-key singing
                   of obscure seventies songs about to grab the
                   rifle from the linen closet when I look
                   through the blinds and see a six-foot tall fetus
                   walks by: "How'd you assholes like me
                   to give your mouths an abortion?"
                   She snarls as they piss themselves
                           beyond Alpha Centauri

                   A helicopter circles overhead
                   piloted by an 80-yr old man w/ insomnia
                   who proceeds to dump cow pies laced
                   with anthrax on the blotto sods

                   A couple more yahoos replete with drink
                   whistle at the fetus she clocks 'em both
                   w/ a reverse clothesline doesn't even need
                   to turn around to detonate her target
                   
                   As society implodes a little further
                       I shuffle to the kitchen
                           to smash n grab a jelly donut
                                 (diabetic or not)
                   and I fall down gurgling
                       "What did you have for breakfast today?
                         Oh, you're such a good little girl..."
                   The lights get brighter
                       in true operating-room fashion
                          masked faces my nerves filled with gas
                      their verbs and nouns surround me
                         but I showed them
                           I'm really back in the kitchen
                              lifting up the skirts of
                           the fluorescent lights
                                and making slurping sounds

                   food hits your tongue already chewed, 
                   kissing is out of the quest, 
                   arguments

                   on looks alone.

                   razored lips

                   and finally,
                   I never smile. I bit my tongue:

                   ___________________________________________________________


                   I first saw it
                   when I tripped over our sighs 
                   as I left my side of the bed 
                   to open the window.

                   It happened again 
                   when I went to wash his dreams down 
                   with a sip or two of water, 
                   as he watched, behind me on the old mattress.

                   It's funny but I can still feel them 
                   in everything I taste today.

                   But I digress.

                   Then as I rode him 
                   and leaned forward to bite his shoulder, 
                   I spoke with my teeth 
                   just a little too loudly. 
                   Blood rising; those marks, 
                   crying their protest,
                   illuminated my stumblings.

                   Now he is gone,
                   if only briefly. 
                   Since he left 
                   I've: Spilled milk,
                   Cried, 
                   And washed it away. 
                   All too eager to fit fingers right,
                   to hold things with grace. 
                   To be sure in my movements.

                   But my body mirrors my mind
                   in its absent wanderings from the present 
                   and I am left to simply rearrange myself 
                   and wait for overflow.

                   It seems I have traded 
                   dexterity for
                   love.
