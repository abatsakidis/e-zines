Intro-Mohawk

	Damn has it been a year already?  I can't believe it.  Our

readership has spanned over 50 counrties and our webpage has had 

over 5000 hits.  I never thought this zine would get this big.  This 

issue was suppose to be bigger but finals and term papers have

gotten the best of me.  However, this is the last week of school, for 

me anyway, and I'll have plenty of time to work on the next issue.  

Like last year's June's issue the main focus will be on scams, so 

send in all your favorite scams and tips on how to avoid scams.  We 

will also have our usual array of phreaking articles and features.  

Also in our next issue we will feature our "Thanks list".  This will

thank all the people that have made this zine possible.  The OCPP

website will also be getting a much needed make over.  Also, older

issues of the OCPP will be getting updated, with help from Punkroq.

Until we get specific in the next issue, on behalf of the entire

staff of the OCPP, thank you to everyone that has helped with

this zine and to all our readers.

THTJ and TFP come to an end

The all new alt.phreaking FAQ

Issue 2 of Security Breach is released



THTJ and TFP come to an end


	We reported in the last issue about the problems of THTJ

and it's sister zine TFP.  Both have ended.  THTJ.com has been 

taken over by some company and tfp.nothing.org has been taken

off line.  You can get all the issues of both zines on the

OCPP's website.  Former staff members of the zine are setting up

a new website that is suppose to house all the back issues plus

some other H/P stuff.  The URL is forbidden.nothing.org So far

there isn't really anything there but it's worth checking out

every now and then.


The all new alt.phreaking FAQ

	
	The alt.phreaking FAQ has been getting to complicated

as of late.  Many of you want it to be better but many of you 

don't want to help.  We decided to split the FAQ into a

beginner version and an advanced version.  Mr. Seuss has become

co-editor of the FAQs and he's been working hard on getting things

together.  That's why there's no article from him this issue.

Both FAQ's should be released on May 1st.  When they first come out

they might need some work and revising.  That's where you 

come in.  Let us know what should be changed, added, or deleted.

After all this FAQ is for you.


Security Breach issue 2 is released

	The second issue of the new zine security breach has 

been released.  Maniac has been doing all the work himself

and is doing a pretty good job at it.  There isn't a website

yet but you can get both issues at the OCPP's website.





















Starting your own payphone business-Mohawk

	Starting a your own payphone business can be a very profitable

venture.  However, there are many things you need to know and many

hidden expenses that come along with it.  Many people think that

you can just hang a payphone on the wall and it will collect money

for you.  This is not the case.  This file is not a complete how-to

file but it will give you a good idea of what you will have to do.

However, there aren't many how-to books out there, at least none 

that are free. 


-Money

	The first thing you will need is money.  If you don't have

at least $30,000 free than you shouldn't even consider this.  That is

because it takes the same amount of effort to set up 15 phones that it 

does 1 phone and setting up 15 phones costs about $30,000.  In fact it

takes 100 payphones with a minimum of $5 per day coin revenue to be 

profitable.  



-EducationOnce you have enough money, you have to educate yourself

to see if this is what you really want to do.  You have to learn the

ins and outs of the payphone business as well as the ins and outs

of your phone itself.  You will also need to learn how to program 

your phone.  This is important because one screw up can throw

off your whole business.  Like I said before there aren't to many

free documents that will help you.

-Your state payphone association

	One of the most important things you can do is to get

in touch with your state payphone association.  They will provide you

with most of the information you will need to get started.  Most

PA's require a registration fee.  Once you are a member, you will be 

able to attend member-only meetings, receive news letters, etc.  This

is a good way to meet others in your area that will help you out and

share their experiences with you.  Listen to what they have to say

and learn from their mistakes and successes.  If your state doesn't have

a payphone association, contact your state's board of public utilities.

Their number should be in the phone book.

-State Public Service Commission

	Contact your State's Public Service Commission for details on 

requirements to operate payphones within the state.  Some states

require a certification process prior to becoming authorized to

operate phones.  It may take up to three months to complete the 

certification process.



-American Public Communications Council

	Contact the (APCC) for additional help.  Their number is

1-800-868-2722.  They also have a website:  www.apcc.net, however

there isn't much on it.



-Local Exchange Company

	Contact your Local Exchange Company (LEC), they will supply

you with vendor handbooks, sign-up forms and charges for service.



-Buying the phone

	When you buy a payphone, you must shop around.  Determine what 

your needs are going to be.  Then look at all the different companies

out there.  The best payphone you can buy is a Nortel Millenium.  

However, if you just want to run a regular payphone business, I 

recommend Elcotel. 


-Choosing a Company

	Like I said before, shop around.  Call up all the companies you 

can and ask them for as much documentation as they can send you.  After 

they mail them to you limit your choices.  Then call them up and ask them

questions.  Most importantly, how long have then been in business.  Some

payphone companies come and go.  If the company you buy your products from

goes out of business, you'll be screwed.  Another thing to look at is

the software.  You will need computer programs to run your payphone.

Find out how easy they are to use and how good they are. 


-Choosing a location

	The right location can make or break a payphone company.  Look

for high foot traffic area, preferably outside with 24 hour

accessibility.  Outside of convenience stores and gas stations

are good locations.  

	You can use a locating service to identify locations quickly.  

Make sure you visit these locations to ensure they fit the strategy you 

have developed for your company.  Locators usually charge between

$200 and $300 per location and some will offer a performance

clause to ensure the location meets the minimum revenue you have 

established.


-VandalismEvery phone will be the victim of vandalism sooner or later.  The
 
only thing you can do is to be prepared.  You will have to buy a whole

extra phone to use for spare parts.  As something breaks, you take it

off the spare phone and put it on the other one.  The location

will also make a difference.  If your phone is in a rough neighborhood 

you can expect it to be vandalized often.  However, if your phone 

is in a good neighborhood inside of a store, vandalism won't happen

that much.  If you choose to put your phone in a store, make

sure they keep long ours.  Vandalism usually happens when customers

get pissed off so if you keep them happy, your payphone will

last longer.


-Route

	A route consists of a number of sites that have been grouped 

together.  A route is usually assigned to a technician, who services 

all the sites on a route.  Since the sites in a route are usually close 

together, the technician who is assigned a route can service more that 

one site quickly and efficiently.


-Collecting the money

	You can collect the money or you can have a technician do it.  

After you get it, what do you do with all that change.  Try to find a 

bank that will accept loose change for free.  Some banks charge a fee.  

You can always rap it yourself.  Automatic coin counters come in a 

variety of styles and prices.


-After all this

	What happens after this point is up to you.  You can stick with 

it and create a payphone empire.  You can sell your route and retire.  

You can lose everything and wind up writing articles for the OCPP.  






















The dumbest posts on alt.phreaking-Phreak Ghost



	Like the title says, these are some of the dumbest posts on 

alt.phreaking.  Some are really obvious and some are a little harder to 

figure out. Keep in mind that this newsgroups is for phreaking only.  The

names of the people that posted them we're taken out so we don't embarass

anyone.  Other than that, none of these posts were edited in anyway.  






-WTF! Where are the NYers posting?  We got guys posting for 2600 meetings 
in places like Oregon and somewhere on the fucking sunny side of hell 
but yet we cant get any 31337 representation from NY! We have to stop 
the phreak turf wars and stop all these damned bastard phreaks who rat.  
We need 2600 meeting organized by 31337 to settle differences.




-Can somebody please send me the plans to a Blue Box. I've looked all 
over and can't find them!


-Hey, this is WAAY off topic, but I need some help.  I got the Tomb
Raider 2 CD and cannot make it work on my computer.  the conclusion I
have come to is that my computer does not read lowercase files from the
CD, there are 2 UPPERCASE files that can be read.  What can i do?  Why
cant my system read the lowercase files??  It works on every other
computer that I have tried.




-WHTUP VERYEM A PHREKERIKE  NDIANT OET IN YUR ES ROUP SO WHATSUP



-I need a proggi to record telephone conversations via ISDN (teles
adapter) with my pc.

Im also looking for a proggi to play .wav files via ISDN





-Have you guys heard of the Blotto Box?  If you need the plans, I have
them, although I don't think ANYONE has the guts to do this sucker,
ANYONE.  This baby is bigger than the Rainbow Box.  Also, I need
everyone's opinion.  This guy last year always beat the crap outta me. 
But you have to understand that I'm not a skinny little nerd.  Anyways,
should I fuck his phone bill over?  Should it be payback time?  I don't
know I mean, tis guy was REALLY mean to me and I'm a nice guy to get
along with, should he pay?



-i was wondering if it was possiblr to create a 2600 hz tone using a 
computer and then sending it through the modem to do all that fun stuff 
a blue box does?  PLZ LMK I am new at this,

And yes i know it would be stupid to use it at home... la da la da.


-Jennifer Martino Just a question for you.....are you a girl? If you are
thats good because there arnt too many female phreakers around


-Hello!

 have tried to hack this page, but can't handle it... I was hoping you 
could do it for me, ot maybe explain how I do it... That would be great!

-Please, Please SEND me PHREAKING files



















The Signal Circuit Protecter-Neptunium Overkill
(The output device you never knew existed!)  


	This month I will tell about a neat little box called a Signal 

Circuit Protecter.  This is a type of bell's apparatus which most 

phreakers don't know much about. You can open them without any tools 

and YES, you can even beige box off of them.  Sounds great, huh?  

	Well, the only bad thing about SCPs is that they are not very 

common, but if you look around you will probably be able to locate a few.  

LOCATION: SCPs are hooked to phone poles and they are mounted about 5' 

off the ground.  They are about 4"x2" in my area (Wisconsin), but of 

course size may differ slightly depending on your location.  Now when 

looking for these I noticed that either your neighborhood has one on the 

pole nearest everyone's house, or they don't have them at all.  Go check 

your pole, and if you have one this means your neighbor will also be the 

proud owner of an SCP.  If you don't have one then you will have to check 

somewhere else.  You will probably need to look to far.


WHAT YOU WILL SEE: Once you find and open an SCP, you will see two 

terminals (a ring and a tip),  a circuit board, and some wires.  All 

you need to do is clip on like you would with any other

output device.  


WHAT IS WITH THIS STICKY ORANGE STUFF?:  It's an adhesive used for 

keeping the rubber TermGard over the terminals.  Just Rip off the 

TermGard and wipe off the orange crap.

Good Luck and Be Careful!




















Phreaking jobs-Mohawk

	For some of us, phreaking is more than just a hobby.  Some

of us can speak more telephonease than the average lineman.  Most

telephone company employees have no background education before they

start their training.  They make a choice to work for the telecom

industry, then they go to school, and then they get a job.  Because

phreakers have such a background on the telecom industry, they would

make valuable employees.  Most of you that are reading this are 

still in high school and you have a ton of people telling you

that you should think about your future.  Well they're right, you

should.  I suggest that some of you make your interest in the

telecom industry a long term thing.  Between what you know now and

what you will learn when you go for you're training, you could

go pretty far.  If any of you are interested, visit the URL's that

I have listed below.  Could you imagine what you could do if you

were a lineman????

Paging systems extensions-Cybercow


	Have you ever been in a store or at you're school and 

wanted to talk over the intercom?  It is not impossible.  In fact 

it is easier then boxing.  

	First, lets talk a little bit about paging extensions.  A store 

and a school have different extensions to make life much easier on the 

workers, teachers, ect.  Every checkout stand has a phone, in 

some stores every isle, and one in most classrooms. The extensions 

start with 101 and go up.  There is one for every single phone.  They 

are not random but they are all grouped in some order.  At the 

bottom of this list is the paging extension. To get this, you only 

have to sneak a peak at the list they have posted everywhere. There 

are public copies too. They have all of the numbers but the last one, 

the one you want.  You are most likely to find those at schools. 

	Once you get the number, you don't want to call from the school 

or store because from a school they can track you easy as shit.  You were 

in the classroom without the teacher, it must be you and in the stores  

they have video cameras that are hidden everywhere.  Call from a pay-phone 

down the block and have a friend inside to listen. 

	Remember not to use your real voice because the teachers will 

turn you in, and it is funnier anyway. If you are calling a store ask for 

security. They will pick up and just tell them you are connected wrong, 

tell them the number to connect you to and they will do so.  The reason 

for this is they do nothing all day and don't know any of the ext. For 

a school call the office when school is in, you will probably get a 

student working.  If not call back every ten minutes until you do. 

When you get a kid, you will be surprised at how stupid your peers 

are. Wait until you hear an empty sound and you are on the air.




















Yet Another Phield Phreaking Kit-Lineside



	Another kit article? Well, actually I've only seen one other one, 

and it seemed kinda old, and I thought I would make a better and more 

comprehensive one.  Anyway, this is my "suggested" list of tools and 

equipment that should be brought along for a safe and enjoyable phield 

phreaking mission. Your mission may simply be a beige boxing expedition, 

or it may be a lineman impersonation mission. Which ever one you do, here 

is some stuff you may want to take along.



# = Lineman impersonation.
* = Beige boxing.
      
_________________________________________________________

Handset  :#* By now you really should know what this thing is, so I'm 

pretty sure you'll want to take it along. If you're gonna be a lineman, 

you really should have a REAL test-set. 


Can wrench  :#* Yep, I have forgotten to bring one of these before. The 

size you'll need is a 3/8" and a 7/16", although I have never needed the 

3/8" one before. It's usually for the smaller terminal boxes, and they're 

no fun. So go play with the big boys!


List o' numbers  :#* Before hand, right up a big list of numbers that 

you'll want to call. Include test numbers or anything else that may be 

useful. Even if you're unsure about taking one, do, because the call 

will be FREE after all.  Or you can just store them in your handset or 

tone dialer. While on this subject, bring along a clipboard for your 

list of numbers, if you're trying to be a lineman. It looks much more 

proffesional than a notebook. ** If you can afford one, get one of those 

digital recorders; they're perfect for remembering numbers that are 

written in the boxes. **


Beeper/ Cell fone  :# Even if it's not really hooked up, take it 

along and put it on your belt or somewhere where people will see it. If 

you're trying to look like a lineman, the more gadgets and stuff you have 

along, the more convincing you'll look. 


Hat/ Shirt :# Looking like a lineman means dressing like one. Wear a hat 

with some kind of company logo, and a denim or polo shirt. On some fone 

company sites, you can actually buy logo brand stuff. This is very 

useful, and sometimes not that expensive. And remember not to wear 

your big, baggy skater pants. Get some smaller ones from your brother 

or someone. 


<editors note:  Try to get shirts at a thrift shop.>


Scanner :#* Well, I've never really taken one along. It just seems too 

much to bother with. But I guess if you live in a small town, you can 

monitor the few police and Bell frequencies. Please send me some 

comments or stories you have, if you actually use a scanner while 

you're out.


Toner and Tracing Probe :# If you are confident in your lineman 

appearance, you can hook this up to someones line (not on the terminal 

end) and trace it back to the distribution box. This may be useful if 

you need to find the someones pair to monitor.


Modular adapter :#* You'll need this to hook up your butt-set to a 

regular fone plug, like those in the customer access interface boxes. 

But you shouldn't really use these cause it's pretty risky.


Flashlight :#* Take a guess why you'll need this.


Attaching cord :* Take a long piece of paired wires (available in 

telco boxes) and put some gator clips on the end, or the special 

hook-up clip. If you want to use a box, you can hook it up, and if 

you left the wire long enough, go sit in nearby bushes or another 

secluded spot.


Gloves :#* Well, if you're really scared about leaving fingerprints, 

go ahead and take them. And you really shouldn't be worried about 

getting shocked. Just don't stick your finger in any holes.


Tool Belt :# Actually, this one is really optional. They're kinda 

expensive, but are very convincing when used.

International Dialing Codes - American Anarchist

	To use these, first you would dial your International Access 

Code (011 in the US) and then the country code for the country you want.


	To find out the time difference between yourself and some other 

country subtract one time from the other. Note: Remember that daylight

saving times may affect the result.


<editor's note:  for those of you wondering what the point of this 
article is, if you do a lot of international beigeboxing or if you
deal with a lot of other countires, this is a handy list to print
out>

Two Calif. Teens Suspected of Breaking Into Government Computers
February 28 

     Law enforcement officials believe two teenage boys from a 

small town in Northern California were among a group of hackers 

who wormed their way into several U.S. government computer systems 

earlier this month, sources close to the investigation said yesterday.

	The high school sophomores, aged 16 and 17, and other members 

of the group are suspected of intruding into at least 11 sensitive 

computer systems at U.S. military installations and dozens of systems at 

other government facilities, including federal laboratories that perform

nuclear weapons research, the sources said.

	Although the computers contained only unclassified information, 

Deputy Defense Secretary John J. Hamre told reporters Wednesday the 

military intrusions constituted "the most organized and systematic 

attack" on U.S. networks discovered by American authorities and

thus aroused concern among officials worried about the possibility of 

electronic sabotage as a means of terrorism or warfare.

	Government officials said they are not yet sure of the 

group's motives, but fellow students speculated the two youths were 

in it for thrills.  Some law enforcement sources speculate that

the group may have been competing to enter different systems.

	Although the hackers are not believed to have seriously 

tampered with any of the systems they entered, they obtained powerful 

administrator privileges on some that could have let them

perform tasks including deleting files and reading passwords, 

sources said.


	FBI agents on Wednesday night raided the boys' homes, 

70 miles north of San Francisco at Cloverdale in the California wine 

country, catching one of them in the act of entering a Pentagon 

computer, the sources said. Agents confiscated the boys' computers 

but did not arrest them. The two were not identified.

	George Grotz, an FBI spokesman in San Francisco, confirmed 

that agents conducted searches at two residences in Sonoma County, which

encompasses Cloverdale, "based upon a computer intrusion case we are 

working on," but declined to elaborate. He said the agents seized "some

hardware, software and printers and other computer equipment."

	The timing of the intrusions, as the United States was 

stepping up deployments of troops and equipment to the Persian Gulf 

region, particularly concerned Pentagon officials.

	Four Navy and seven Air Force systems, at sites around the 

United States and Okinawa, are known to have been targeted. The systems 

perform largely logistical and administrative functions, but officials 

warned that tampering with even that data could potentially disrupt

military operations.

	The group also entered systems at several universities and 

federal research facilities, including the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 

the Brookhaven National Laboratories, the University of California at 

Berkeley and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's fusion labs, said

William G. Zane, owner of Netdex Internet Services Inc., a Santa Rosa, 

Calif.-based Internet service provider. Zane said his service was

intruded by the group and used as a launching pad for many of the attacks.

	The group's activities first were noticed by Zane in 

mid-January, when his staff discovered an intruder who had given 

himself administrator, or "root," privileges, he said. Zane said he

notified the FBI and the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie 

Mellon University in Pittsburgh, which distributes computer security

alerts.

	Instead of kicking the hackers off his service, Zane said 

he consulted with the FBI and decided to install software that would 

monitor the group's activities, reports of which he said he provided 

to agents.

	"We decided to take a little risk," he said. "We let them 

play for a little while. We gave them enough rope and let them hang 

themselves."

	Zane said the hackers used another Internet service provider 

to connect to his computers. From his system, he said the group launched 

"hundreds of attacks."

	"We were seeing hundreds of [Internet] addresses that would 

go by that had been scanned and cracked," he said.

	One law enforcement source, however, said investigators have 

not yet been able to confirm the full scope of the group's intrusions. 

"We shouldn't jump to the conclusion that hundreds of computers were 

entered," the source said.

	Zane refused to say what tactics the hackers used to enter 

his system and others. "They had a very sophisticated set of [software] 

tools," he said.

	He said at least one of the hackers discovered last Saturday 

that the Netdex staff had been monitoring the group, resulting in a 

frantic scramble to copy the group's files for the FBI before the 

hacker deleted data on the computer in question.

	The two students are 10th graders at Cloverdale High School, 

a 450-student public school.  Gene Lile, the principal, said no federal 

or state authorities have yet notified the school of any wrongdoing, 

but the incident was the subject of almost every conversation throughout 

the school day yesterday.

	Students who know the two boys fiercely defended them, 

describing them as "just normal, everyday kids" who have a strong 

interest in computers. "They were just doing it for the thrill

of getting in. I know them well enough to know that they wouldn't do 

anything purposefully wrong," said Lissa Tryer, another 10th grader.

	"It makes me mad. They're not twisted. These are just two 

nice guys," said another girl, who declined to give her name.

	Joe Simao, a senior at Cloverdale, said he wasn't surprised to 

hear of the hacking incident.  Simao said he helped one of the teens 

set up a computer operating system called Linux, which is based on 

Unix, a widely used operating system on the Internet. "They started 

to get into hacking lately," Simao said. "I heard [one of the teens] 

say, 'Yeah, I've hacked into MIT and UC Berkeley.' "

	Simao said he believes the pair did not have the expertise 

to invent new techniques for breaking into systems, but said they 

had become frequent users of sites on the Internet where hackers

post descriptions of how to break into computer networks. "It's like 

some want to drive fast cars; others want to use drugs; and some want 

to hack," Simao said.

	John Hudspeth, who teaches technology at Cloverdale and 

oversees a lab with 40 desktop computers, said that both boys have 

a sincere interest in technology. "They're good kids who have 

helped me out quite a bit," he said. "They've put a lot of time into 

helping set up the systems in this lab."

	But Zane contended the attacks should not be minimized. 

"This was a massive set of intrusions," he said. "You don't need 

to crack 11 machines to brag that you've entered the Pentagon."






Suspected NASA Hacker Arrested

The suspected leader of a group of computer hackers who broke into the

network of a NASA laboratory has been arrested, agency officials said 

Wednesday. 


In addition to its own computer system, NASA investigators believe 

Calldan Levi Coffman, 20, of Carson, Wash., also infiltrated the networks 

of various corporations, universities and other government agencies. 

Coffman is the suspected leader of the group "ViRii." NASA officials

started looking into the group last June when security officials at its 

Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., detected a problem with 

the computer system. 

An investigation determined the system was being controlled by intruders 

using the network to help break into other systems targeted by ViRii

targets, NASA said. 

The agency initially investigated suspects other than Coffman, including 

an Israeli teen known as "The Analyzer." The 18-year-old was placed

under house arrest Wednesday in Jerusalem after being accused of 

infiltrating the Pentagon's computer system. 






Israel Cops Arrest Computer Hacker

An Israeli teen-ager accused of infiltrating the Pentagon computer 

system and others in Israel was questioned Wednesday and placed under 

house arrest, Israeli police said. 

The suspect, who calls himself "The Analyzer," and two accomplices, 

all 18, told police they had not penetrated the systems for personal 

gain, police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said. No charges have been

brought so far against any of the three, whose identities were not 

released by Israeli authorities. 

In Washington, the Justice Department identified the arrested hacker 

as Ehud Tenebaum. 

"This arrest should send a message to would-be computer hackers all 

over the world that the United States will treat computer intrusions 

as serious crimes," said Attorney General Janet Reno. 

The suspects were questioned for several hours at a police station in 

Bat Yam, a southern suburb of Tel Aviv, then put under house arrest, 

Menuhin said. Police confiscated their passports and forbade any contact 

between them. 

"They are all cooperating with the police," Menuhin said, adding that

their parents had also been brought to the station but were not questioned. 


She had no details on what Israeli systems were involved, but Channel

2 TV identified one as the computer system of Israel's parliament, the

Knesset. 

"The Analyzer" is suspected of being the mentor of two California

teen-agers who have been questioned by the FBI in connection with 

hacking into the Pentagon's computer system and university research

computers. 

The Pentagon has said the intrusions appeared to have been aimed at 

systems that contained unclassified personnel and payroll records. A 

spokesman described the Israeli hacker's work as the most organized 

and systematic attack the Pentagon has seen to date. 

"The Analyzer" and the two teens from Cloverdale, Calif., 

apparently penetrated computers in February using a weakness that 

already had been identified by computer security teams. 

In an interview with the Internet magazine AntiOnline before he was 

caught, "The Analyzer" said the penetrations were innocent and 

claimed that he even helped the targets by patching any weaknesses 

he found. 

The first report on "The Analyzer's" work came Feb. 3 from the 

Massachusetts Institute of Technology's plasma energy lab. Break-ins 

were then reported at a series of military locations, including the 

Naval Undersea Warfare Center, as well as at other universities and NASA. 

Menuhin said two police units dealing in fraud and computer protection 

would continue the investigation against the three








Teen Charged With Computer Hacking

Sending a warning to young computer hackers, federal prosecutors 

charged a teen-age boy with shutting down an airport communications system.
 
The U.S. Department of Justice said Wednesday the Massachusetts boy, 

whose name was not released, has agreed to plead guilty and faces two 

years probation, a fine and community service. 

The teen is the first juvenile charged in federal court with computer

hacking, officials said. 

The boy broke into a Bell Atlantic computer system on March 10, 1997, 

stalling communication between the control tower and aircraft at 

Worcester Airport for six hours, authorities said. No accidents occurred. 

"These are not pranks, this is not like throwing spitballs at your 

teacher," U.S. Attorney Donald Stern said. "Hackers should know that 

they will be caught and they will be prosecuted." 

The teen-ager was charged with juvenile delinquency, the umbrella charge 

that relates to all crimes committed by juveniles. In adult cases, the 

charge is called intentionally accessing protected computers. 

"We dodged a bullet that day," said Joseph Hogan, area manager for 

Robinson van Vuren, a company contracted by the Federal Aviation

Administration to operate air traffic control towers in New England. 

When the teen-ager used his computer to break into the phone company

computers, the system crashed, power was lost at the control tower 

and phone service was shut off to 600 houses in Rutland, a central 

Massachusetts community outside of Worcester.

Hi, I have been reading OCPP since issue 1 and now I come to issue 7 

and I must say, good job lads.  I am sure people could debate this but 

I must say that this magazine is the best of it's kind.  Articles are 

well written and the knowledge of current events your mag displays are 

unparelled. Keep up the good work. 



<Thanks!  These are the letters that keep us going.  When I first

started this zine I never thought people would be telling us that

we are the best.>








From:  Justin

Hey..

   I just wanted to congratulate you on a job well done. I truly 

enjoyed reading the latest issue of your zine! Personally, I can't 

wait until the Project Angel goes mainstream all across the country... 

Just think of the phreak possibilites... Already phreaks are cloning 

cells phones... now we can clone houses! Or intercept all three lines 

being transmitted from a house... the 2 voice and the data line... The 

future is going to be a fun place for people like us. If there is 

anything that you need help with, and projects or whatever, just let 

me know. I am always willing to lend a helping hand.



<Yeah the future is going to be cool, only if we keep up with it that

is.  Alot of us still dwell on old stuff like boxes.  We need to 

keep up with new technology and follow it every step of the way.

If we don't, everything is going to change and we're going to

be left here with nothing to phreak.  But that's what we're here

for.  Like we did with project angel, we will keep you up to date

with all the latest technology.  Speaking of project angel, it seems

that it is still in it's testing phase.  I have sifted through the 

mounds of information on AT&T's website and I have found some

references to project angel.  They don't mention anything about it.

All they mention is that AT&T is working on a fixed wireless

local telephone system.  Like I said before, they will probably

keep this under wraps until the local telephone market fully opens

up.>

RedBox Problems & Some Solutions

Red boxing with tone dialers, digital recorders or what ever your 

preference, still works in many areas.  It doesn't work on the newer 

fones with muted mouth peices and phones where you can adjust the volume 

with that button thing.


To check if the phone is muted simply blow in the reciever if you hear it 

in the ear piece it's all good, box away... if not, move on.  And you 

know those "unboxable COCOTS"  well, they're not unboxable... instead of 

replacing the crystal in the tone dialer with a 6.5mhz (6.5900mhz) 

crystal, replace it with a 6.3mhz... (refer to redbox plans if you 

don't know what I'm talking about) This will also work with bell phones.

Yes that is true, but that doesn't mean that's what 2600 is for. Just

because a NG gets spammed a lot doesn't mean that it is for spam. It is a

problem that many have been dealing with in their own ways and between us

the spam is getting slowly cleaned up.

Another instance of that same thing...

That all depends on your definition of a hacker. alt.hackers is for

hackers, but it is for the other _kind_ of hacker. In this case it's for

people who use existing technology (most of the time basic things like

bowls, CDs, tape etc.) to solve problmes. It's kind of hard to explain,

read the NG for a couple of days, it's fairly low traffic so that won't be

hard. There are the occasional "teach me to hack" posts, but those are

generally from clueless newbies who did a search for the word hacker and

found that. What you may be thinking of is alt.hacker, the S makes a big

difference.

Hacker crashes thousands of Windows computers
March 4

An unknown hacker caused thousands of Windows-based university and 
government computers to crash on the eve of Senate testimony by 
Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates, authorities said Wednesday. 

The Monday night attack affected nine of the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration's 10 major field offices as well and major 
universities, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
(MIT) and the University of California at Berkeley. 

"Basically, what happened is it locked the system," said Mike Mewhinney, 
a spokesman for the space agency's Ames Research Center near Mountain 
View, Calif. "Obviously, it was something we were concerned about, and 
we stepped in to address it as soon as we learned about it." 

While the attack did not cause any significant loss of data, users 
were confronted with the so-called "blue screen of death," which 
appears with an error message when Windows crashes. The only solution 
was to restart the computer. 

Jeffrey Schiller, network manager at MIT, said the malicious hacker 
exploited a bug in the Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems 
known "Boink,"  "Teardrop II" or  "New Tear." 

At MIT, the attacker obtained a list of all computers connected to 
the Internet and then sent specific data packets calculated to 
overload the computers, causing a "denial of service." 

The only computers not affected were those that had installed 
Microsoft-supplied patches or were running other operating systems, 
such as Apple Computer Macintosh units. 

Microsoft issued a statement on the Internet saying the vulnerability 
was "not a new issue" and recommending customers install patches -- 
software fixes -- available on its Web site. 

While there were no clues as to the identity of the attacker, victims 
pointed out it came just hours before Gates' testimony before the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, where he defended the company against charges that 
it improperly exploits its vast market power. 

MIT's Schiller, an expert in Internet security, said the incident 
underscores the vulnerability of networked computers to hostile attacks. 

"What you're dealing with here is someone who is actively trying to 
find a way to make your program misbehave," Schiller said. "To me 
the Internet is a hostile place, and we have to build our programs 
to deal with that."






Pentagon Has Computers Hacked

They were computer clicks away from plunging the nation into darkness 
or interfering with the military's U.S. Pacific Command. Instead, they 
broke into Pentagon and civilian computers, declared cybervictory and 
signed off. 

Fortunately these hackers harbored no evil intentions: They were a 
U.S. national security team secretly testing the vulnerability of the 
nation's computer system using software found on the Internet. 

Code-named "Eligible Receiver," the cyberwar game proved what the 
Defense Department said it has long known - that its computers are 
susceptible targets, which became clear earlier this year when real 
hackers made a "systematic attack." 

"Eligible Receiver, I think, has succeeded beyond its planners' wildest 
dreams in elevating the awareness of threats to our computer systems," 
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters Thursday. 

In last June's cyberwar game aimed at the Pentagon's unclassified 
computers, more than 50 National Security Agency hackers gained access 
to systems across the country, including the U.S. Pacific Command in 
Hawaii, which oversees 100,000 troops in Asia. Classified computer 
systems were not tested, Bacon said. 

The hackers gained access to a U.S. electric power grid they could 
have sabotaged to plunge the nation into darkness as well - something 
Pentagon officials say would likely be a tactic of any real cyberwar 
aimed at shutting down public works. 

Some hackers posed as operatives for North Korea and only one unit was 
tracked by the FBI, which works with the Pentagon to catch computer 
criminals. 

"It found that we have a lot of work to do to provide better security," 
Bacon said of the cyberwar game. "We're not alone in this regard." 

The Pentagon plans to spend nearly $1 billion a year for the next 
several years to improve its classified and unclassified computer 
security, Bacon said. The department has 2.1 million computers. 

Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre is leading a stepped-up 
anti-hacker program that includes a counterintelligence effort to 
stop intruders before they get through the electronic door, the 
Pentagon said. 

In the most recent case of real Pentagon hacking, a teen-ager in Israel, 
nicknamed, "The Analyzer" on the Internet, is being investigated by the 
Israeli police for his assault on Defense Department and other computer 
systems earlier this year. 

In February, Hamre said the Pentagon's unclassified computers were 
hit by the "most organized and systematic attack" to date, targeting 
mostly personnel records. 

He said intrusions had "all the appearances of a game'' and had 
"the quality of voyeurism or vandalism" committed by a small number of 
individuals. 

"There are hackers that enjoy breaking into people's computers, just 
to see what they can see,'' he said, adding the Pentagon holds some 
"mystique." 

Bacon joked that perhaps the military should look at home for answers. 

"We're trying to do a much better job of staying in touch with our 
teen-age children and others to learn the latest hacker techniques 
so we can be one step ahead of them rather than several steps behind," 
he said. 










Israeli Hacker Featured in Ad

The FBI may be furious with him, but in Israel he's a sales icon. 

Ehud Tenenbaum, the Israeli teenager who hacked into the Pentagon's 
computer system, was featured Tuesday in a full-page computer ad in 
the Yediot Ahronot newspaper. 

The clean-cut, dark-eyed 18-year-old gazes out at the reader, chin 
on hand, next to the slogan: "To go far, you need the best equipment." 

The ad is selling Newron computers, made by the Israeli company EIM. 

Tenenbaum, who used the name "The Analyzer" on the Internet, is being 
investigated by the Israeli police for his cyber-assault on the Pentagon 
and other computer systems. He has not been charged. 

The FBI has said he confessed to the intrusions. 

"At first we had our doubts about the ethics of using his image in 
the ad," said Yoram Klein, managing director of EIM. "But we found that 
he is a most positive young man. He made a mistake, but that could happen 
to any teenager." 

In return for appearing in the ad, Tenenbaum received EIM's latest 
model computer, the Newron Play Station, which sells for about $2,000. 
Tenenbaum's own computer was confiscated by Israeli police. 

Tenenbaum has said he broke into the Pentagon's computer to expose 
the weakness in its protective systems. He said he liked to search the 
Internet for neo-Nazi, pedophile or anti-Israel web sites and destroy them. 

Since he was exposed last month, he has been flooded with offers for 
books and movie deals. 

Tenenbaum was drafted into the Israeli army last week. When he 
finishes his army service, EIM intends to offer him a job, Klein told 
The Associated Press. 

"His knowledge of computers is staggering," he said. "He has 
enormous energy, and the important thing is to direct it into positive 
channels."

Mounties nab suspect after hacker breaches NASA site
April 6 


A 22-year-old Canadian man suspected of breaking into a NASA Web site 
and causing tens of thousands of dollars in damage has been arrested by 
Canadian Mounties.  

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police in the northern Ontario city of 
Sudbury charged Jason Mewhiney with mischief, illegal entry, and 
willfully obstructing, interrupting and interfering with the lawful use 
of data, Corporal Alain Charbot told Reuters on Monday. 

Charbot said the unemployed former part-time computer science student 
was "very knowledgeable" when it came to computer systems. Mewhiney was 
arrested on April 1. 

Canadian police were tipped off 14 months ago by FBI agents in 
Washington, who were investigating security breaches into computer 
systems at NASA, the U.S. air and space center. 

More than $70,000 worth of damage was caused at the NASA web site and 
officials were forced to rebuild the site and change security, Charbot 
said. The FBI tracked the hacker by tracing telephone numbers to the 
Sudbury area. 

The Mounties raided the homes of Mewhiney's divorced parents and seized 
an ancient computer, a second basic computer, a high-speed modem, 
diskettes, and documents. 

Charbot said police were still investigating breaks at several Canadian 
college and university sites. 

The number of charges has not yet been released but for each count 
there is a maximum penalty of one year in jail and fines of thousands 
of dollars, Charbot said. 

Most hackers get a kick out of breaching sites, considering it a 
triumph worth boasting about to other hackers. 

And the probable fate of a hacker, once released from police custody? A 
cushy job at a corporation, doing the same type of work -- but only with 
the permission of web site builders, Charbot said. 







Computer Hackers on the Offensive After the Hacker Analyzer is 
arrested in Israel; Multiple Government and Corporate Web Sites 
Under Massive Retailiatory Cyber-Attack! International Cyber-Terrorism 
Raising Its Specter in This Full-Fledged Assault Upon the Internet

March 24 

Ian A. Murphy, Pres. of IAM/Secure Data Systems, Inc., today issued 
a terse warning to the Systems owners connected to the Internet:  

After the recent arrest of the "Pentagon Hackers" in the US and Israel, 
certain cyber-terroristic factions of the computer underground have taken 
an active offensive role in the defense of the arrested hackers.  The 
Underground Hacker group known as the Enforcers have undertaken a massive 
assault upon the Internet and Information Systems worldwide. 

Corporate and Govt. web sites have been attacked and defaced in 
such a manner, that no system should be left without full security 
procedures and policies firmly in place.  Internet sites that have 
been attacked can be found on a listing at the web site 
www.antionline.com.  This current example of cyber-terrorism will 
continue to excalate in the near future and is showing just how 
vulnerable we all are to these types of Cyber-Terroristic attacks. 

These Cyber-Terrorists, only armed with average desk-top computers 
and connections to the Internet, have shown that any system connected 
to the Internet may fall prey to these intrusions.  Call it the 
Cyber-version of a home intrusion and you get a better idea. 

These attacks offer a unique view of the power of the Internet to 
reach out and touch all lives in many manners yet unseen by the 
general population. In addition, such blatant attacks only serve to 
underscore the complete lack of overall Information Security provided 
to these systems that contain all of our Personal, Business, Medical, 
Insurance, Criminal & Educational Information. 

Without the complete and total assurance of such systems, we can never 
be safe from such assaults upon our lives, our incomes and our National 
Security. This glowing example should be a warning to all that use and 
depend upon the Internet for Commerce, Research and Entertainment.

bastards like this that give hackers/phreaks a bad name.  Get a

The Enforcers Hackers Group Enters Into Cyberspace Agreement
March 27 

Infowar.Com was notified today by the "Enforcers" Computer Hackers 
Group, that an agreement was reached with chief negotiator Ian A. Murphy, 
aka Capt. Zap, to cease and desist their cyber destruction witnessed in 
the recent attacks and intrusions that have rocked the Internet in past 
weeks.  The Enforcers began their massive assault on corporate and 
military websites after the arrest of "Pentagon Hackers" here in the 
US and Israel. 

Ian Murphy, CEO of IAM/Secure Data Systems, and the first US hacker 
arrested back in 1981, issued press releases during negotiations which 
are captioned below.  Murphy began the process to begin deliberations 
out of a sense of duty.  Murphy's dialogue with members of the Enforcer 
group pointed to the fact that the destruction was counter productive.  
He urged the group to consider halting this activity.  "The destruction 
of information systems for an alleged cause is not the way to go about 
such things in defense of Hackers and Crackers." 

Murphy has been pontificating for years that the government and 
corporate entities need to take the powers and strength of hackers 
seriously.  With the attacks and intrusions on the rise, and information 
losses at an all time high, Murphy added, "It is high time that the 
alleged powers that be in information security bow to the wonderment 
of the hackers and their alleged silent, awesome power.  It is time 
that we as a society realize that one individual is equal to an entire 
armed nuclear offensive force and is able to bring about global chaos 
if they choose to, from a simple computer keyboard. It strikes me as 
being so simplistic and yet so invasive of all society that such things 
may occur.  And we have become so dependent and enamored with -- and our 
society so rests upon -- our silicon lives and slaves.  We have become 
the servants of our own information society and still do not see the 
reality of the situation at hand." 

The Enforcers defended their activities with claims that they were 
calling attention to system administrators to wake up and 'fix' their 
system flaws. 

Statement Of The Enforcers   

"We, the Enforcers, have decided that it would be in the best interest 
of the hacking community and the security community at large to cease 
and desist all web site hacking of external businesses as advised 
by Mr. Ian Murphy (Captain Zap).  We agree that our actions are not 
productive and are doing more harm than good towards the security 
community.  Therefore, as an agent of the Enforcers, I hereby state 
that all web site hacks on external sites will be immediately halted.  
We feel that there will be other avenues opening to achieve our goal 
of a substantial reduction in child pornography and racist web sites 
and netizens.  We also support the larger goals of the hacker community 
and in the future we will work to augment the public's view rather than 
detract from it.  All members of Enforcers who hacked the web sites have 
agreed to this release and will stop hacking external web sites." 


"We thank you for your time and assistance in this matter." 

Paralyse, Immunity, and DooM   

Members of the EnforcerS

E-Mail:  enforcers.webmaster@zicada.co.nz  

Infowar.Com congratulates both Mr. Murphy and the Enforcers for 
their diligence in reaching this agreement that stands to make a 
statement on the Internet.  This is a model of an act of peace in 
our cyberworld. 

We hope other hacker groups will have the maturity to follow example.
