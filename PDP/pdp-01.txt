     and sisterz when I say, "I am proud this is a PDP production."  
     Second I want u 2 know that this phile has been designed with the 
     intermediate 2 advanced telephone phreak in mind, if u can't 
     understand nething well duhhh go read more t-filez.
          In this issue we feature articles from virtually all of our PDP 
     brotherz and sisterz with the possible exception of Motorola Coca-cola, 
     whoz being lame this week.  Also that bitch TELEPHONE JOAN broke our 
     pdp2ascii translator which fucked up the formatting.  But anyway we
     have all kindz of eleetness from boxing info from the queen of boxing
     (hehehe) TELEPHONE JOAN 2 a laceration file from our newest member,

     100% of our effortz towardz providing u with the most eleet info 
     available in the scene. 
          OK I think that's all I got 2 say... oh yeah I didn't write 
     any t-files about life in the CO this issue because of JOAN's nefarious 
     foot.  Word out brotherz!  PDP iz and ownz more than u know!  PDP

 "yeah." and "yup." which can asist you when you don't feel like talking to
 someone but don't want to hurt thier feelings.

 "the hammer box"

        this box is a large instrument that gets you free cash from
 payphones.  all you do bring the device to the phone and begin pounding
 the shit out of it.  it works better when you aim it at the place at the
 bottom where the money is kept.  also, you should wait till no one is
 around to use the box.  it's often detectable what you are doing.  it
 seems people know something is amiss when you use the hammer box even
 though they don't know anything about phreaking.

 "the box box"

        this box is for the ultimate phreaker on the run.  all you do is
 program it with a big red button and a large display window.  when you press
 the button, a random type of box is displayed on the screen.  this is the
 box that you should work on that day to make.  you should unfairly adjust
 the random affect to lean towards selecting red and blotto.

 "the return box"

 uses:

 this is for all you guys that wonna look like the kinda guy that is a guy
 and can do that guy type-o-guy stuff with the "i know you - even if you
 don't know how i know you" guy guy guy.  that's the kinda guy I am, I can
 tell you all my supah phreakin' sekretz.  ok, here goez:

 *69 command -

 this is a command implemented that calls the person that just called you
 back.  we in the h4qr biz call it "return calling".  it's like tracing.
 except not as good.  but what can you expect from ma b3ll!?  ah, but there's
 more.  all kinds of neat trixxx are abound in the mysterious *69 k0de 4 y3w
 t3w r4p3.  here's just s0me:

 1] dual crank-caller - when you get one of those rude crank callerz that
 hang up as soon as you pick up the phone you can use the box and call them
 back.  then as soon as they pick up the phone you hang up on them - perfect
 equality!@!

 2] revenge.  go to one of your enemies homes and continuously keep dialing
 *69 and rack up the phone bill, slowly adding 30 cent charges.  this might
 seem slower than simply calling Guam and leaving the phone off hook, but hey
 you can hit some buttons!!!!!!!!!

 3] this is an optional way to construct a box, in case you think it's "not a
 real box" unless you go to radio shack.  Go to Radio shack.  Ask the guy
 behind the counter for a tone dialer .. laugh when he calls he calls you a
 "hacker" and and say "n0t m33 d00d!@!".  call gigikey -> 1800DIGIKEY.  order
 the same crystal that's already in the box!  Now buy a new soldering iron,
 even if you already have one.  Properly de-solder the crystal and make sure
 that there's no glue left over.  Solder the new crystal in, but make sure
 the side of the crystal you solder in has the numbers up, so people know
 it's NOT the crystal the box came with.  screw yer box back together.  now
 go back to radio shack.  This part takes 4 months, but it's worth it - ask
 the d00d behind the counter for a "battery of the month club".  Get one of
 the red aaa batteries with your "battery the month card" and let him punch
 out this month's "number" (elite tip - do this at the end of the month so
 you can go back the next day and get yer second battery) do this until you
 have 4 batteries.  Place the batteries in yer return box and take the card
 out of the back where you list all yer stored phone numbers.  write "return
 b0x"with a red crayon in the "p1" slot.  now flip the card over and read the
 instructions on how to program the memory spot to make your return box
 activate with one button.  now go to sk00l and sell it one of yer hacker
 d00d friends for 50 dollars.  you are now truly 3113t3 and a phreaker.  you
 will be famous and your work is in demand.  it takes 4 months to make each
 one so it's even more in demand.  man, this paragraph was long.

 Needs ->
 a fone
 at least one working finger
 a way to get the phone to your ear
 the "*" and the "6" and the "9" buttons
 a dial tone
 an iq over 75
 sufficient motor skills to hit the buttons

 cost ->
 approximate $.30

 /<-features ->

 do you really need some selling points for this box??!?!  ok, here you go:

 a) makes a cool noise.
 b) only 3 digits!  whee!
 c) if you take off the * it's a cool position.
 d) the 6 and 9 are close together so it's real easy to hit.
 e) the letters spell "my", "ox", and "ow".
 f) you can pay 6 bux to not have any more *69 charges. m4k3z zentz.
 g) if you get off on the operators voice, then it's extra cool.
 h) you don't have to go to radio shack to buy parts.
 i) there's not too many digits in it, so if you wonna (note: wonna!) dial
    with your pinky then it won't get you tired.
 j) it's so elite!  it starts with a hip '*'!
 k) it's just really 'k'.

        this concludes your lesson in bein' elite.  h4ppi3 phr34kin' and

   I know you all are thinking to yourself, "How can I be eleet like 
   the pDp?"  Three words: social engineering.  Everybody knows how dumb 
   operators are, or they wouldn't be operators!  Duh!  This technique 
   has worked out three of four times.  Here's how I social engineer.


SoCiaL eNGiNeeRiNG MY WaY:
~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~^~^^~^^^

 Dramatis Personae.

  r0b.  Acne riddled kid.
  Operator.  Acne riddled adult female.
 

   Operator. Hello, operator Lish.
   r0b.      hey baby.
   Operator. Can I help you?
   r0b.      yeah, i'd like some free long distance
   Operator. I'm sorry, I can't do that.
   r0b.      yo, i'll make it worth your while
                                                    [ Operator giggles.
             when do you get off work?
   Operator. 6
   r0b.      how about you give me some free long distance?
   Operator: OK.


eXTRo:
~^^^^^

You gotta be suave to do this shit, you can't have a high voice.  And 
remember, pDp owns you.  Thanks to Daemon 9 and the rest of *the Guild 
posse (if u know what he means -stm) for teaching me all this kewl technique.

                                      from the past
                                       flew inside
                                        his spell was cast

                 a piece of advice
                  a simple test
                   the hope of your dream
                    was laid to rest

                                     so it is possible
                                      for your past
                                       you to haunt

You know the feeling, and I know the feeling.  You are sitting at home,
forearms on your knees, staring at your wrists.  You have been puzzling for
HOURS over them.  You're stuck in a rut.  It seems that your wrists are the
only things left out there that you can't get into.  You can smack a Solaris
box at any given moment, bring entire phone networks to thier knees with 3
little tones, and score a chick with 3 beers and a Yugo.  But you just can't
get into your wrists.  Well, I'm here to help.

There are several methods of getting into your wrists.  Since many of them
are expensive, and I am assuming that you have little money, I will only
cover basic, inexpensive methods.  NOTE:  These methods are frilless and
cheap, and, like anything that is cheap, it's easy to get caught using these
methods.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. 

Method NuMBaH #1:-->  This is the cheapest, but most difficult, way to hack
your wrists.  it involves:
   A comb (straight, single-filed bristle type)
You should *CAREFULLY* place the comb between your thumb and forefinger (I
say *CAREFULLY* because if you use the wrong hand positioning, you may end
up hacking into something you don't want to!) and place it perpendicular to
the line of your wrist.  move your fingers to the middle of the comb (make
sure the bristles are resting pointed end on your wrist, otherwise this
won't work) and press down HARD on the comb.  While doing so, move the comb
back and forth (lengthwise) along your wrist.  after about 10 minutes of
such activity, your wrist will be fully hacked.

M3th-hud N00mbah #2:-->  This is slightly more expensive than the last
method, but MUCH quicker.  It involves:
   A razor blade (A scraper-blade is acceptable, and you may have to
     disassemble a disposable shaver if you don't have any razors.)
This method works in much the same was as Method #1.  Hold the razor, sharp
side towards wrist, in the same way you held the comb.  Apply pressure to
your wrist with the razor and drag it lengthwise.  In one stroke you should
have a sizable incision.  This method takes only about 3 seconds to complete.

MeTHUDD nUMBER #3:final method-->  This is by far the quickest, most
expensive way to go.  It involves:
   a short-burning fuse (candlewicks WON'T work)
   5 pounds of trinitrothalamine (alternatively mercury fulminate)
   a blasting cap
   15 yards of duct tape
make a container out of duct tape large enough to place all 5 pounds of
trinitrothalamine inside.  place the short-burning fuse inside the blasting
cap and the blasting cap inside the trinitrothalamine.  duct tape the entire
deal to your wrist and light the fuse.  It should explode, causing a major
hack on your wrist (and perhaps systematic nervous shock).  WARNING!  THIS
METHOD IS VERY DANGEROUS AND HAS BEEN KNOWN TO CAUSE TERMINAL MATTER LOSS!

In closing, I must say that I do not condone any of the activities mentioned
above, and that this article is intended ONLY for educational ( smirk)
purposes.  I waive ALL legal responsibility resulting from the usage of
methods described in this file.
