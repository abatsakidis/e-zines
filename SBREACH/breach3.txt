Security Breach #3
Summer 1998
Editor in chief: Maniac
Contributors: Harvester of Souls

Editor's note:
This issue marks the first time I've had any help writing this. 
Security Breach has a new writer on board, namely Harvester of Souls. 
He came up with some interesting frequency stuff for this issue, which 
I hope proves useful to people in some way or another.

I'm also looking for contributions from anybody who has anything to 
write about(except lame stuff and redboxing articles)NO GODDAMN REDBOXING 
ARTICLES!...okay, I'll stop ranting now..

Anyways, this issue we start a new series of articles on various 
types of cans. I hope to cover at least one type of can per issue, 
and I'm going to try to go into as much depth and detail as possible.

Shout-outs to the following people:
Mohawk, Mr. Seuss, Slapayoda, Phen0m, Hatredonalog, anybody who 
carries SB on their website, The more knowledgeable people in 
alt.phreaking, Matty Acid for hooking me up with the DS-1 tutorial, 
Plik, StikSickly, #peng crew, esp. squirrel and the other conf 
regulars..Hell Atlantic (for providing me with a phone system to 
play with), and of course Mailboxes Etc. for making shipping a PBX 
a couple thousand miles much less of a pain in the ass...Greets also 
to anyone I forgot..

Motorola Micro TacBy (Harvester Of Souls)

This article is about the Motorola Micro Tac flip fones.
This may vary from fone to fone.
Here are the basics you need to know to begin.

To look at the system ID, fone #, & station class marks
and much more, do the following.

1) Turn power ON.
2) Immediately press FCN, 0.
3) Type the Security Code.  (Factory standard is 000000).
4) Scroll through the options with the * key.
5) Only make changes that are accurate!
-----------------------------------------------------
To put the phone into test mode do the following:

Disconnect any & all power from the phone.
There will be 3 contact leads on the back of the phone.
Short the middle pin to ground. The ground is usually
the contact lead to the right of it. (Test with a 
DMM to be sure). DMM - Digital Multi Meter.
When you apply power, you will find that the screen is
flashing hexadecimal numbers. Press the # key.
The display should show     US '
IF it just shows a '  and not  us '  don't worry.
From either of those points you may type in commands
to the phone.

To listen in on a conversation:
Type 11xxx, #           xxx = Channel number.
NOTE: This is illegal & I don't recommend this since they
have triangulation methods. You have been warned!
The channels that I have listen to are anywhere from
112 to 999. I believe the phone will go up to channel 9999.
You may not be able to do anything, but I personally think
that it has the capabilities to do so.
I found that the most popular channels around
the suburban Boston area and up to Boston also
are these:

    112
    298
    299
    300
    301
    999
This may not be true for all areas. Just scan the channels
& see what you find. :)
                           


The Finer Points of Canning  (Volume 1)

***This is the first of a series of articles devoted to the 
purposes and contents of various types of cans. There will be
plenty more written about other types of cans, but I've decided 
to only do one for this issue, as it's long overdue***

-Maniac

It would probably be safe to assume that any phreak worth 
their salt has opened plenty of cans in their career. Cans come 
in many different shapes and sizes(and even colors), and contain 
all sorts of interesting stuff....and it's not all just wires.

	The most basic can is the TNI, which stands for Telephone 
Network Interface. Also known as the SNI, as well as several other 
names, it serves a the point where the telco wiring ends and the 
customer wiring begins. This is technically known as the point of 
demarcation. These boxes can be found on any home or business which 
has above ground telephone service. The contents of these boxes 
varies somewhat, depending on the exact model of TNI. They're all 
pretty similar, though, generally speaking.

	My TNI is a Nynex model that dates back about 3 years. 
It's about 6 or 8 inches square with a two-section door to provide 
different levels of access. The outer section of the door is marked 
"customer access" and opens with a flathead screwdriver. It provides 
access to the RJ-11 jack that connects the telco wiring to the 
customer wiring. This is a convenient place to beige box from, 
since any normal phone can connect to an RJ-11 jack. However, to 
do this, you must unplug the customer wiring from the jack, which 
renders the phones in the building useless. People might notice 
this, but this is an easy problem to fix. Simply buy (or steal) a 
dual male to single male RJ-11 adapter. This has two female RJ-11 
connectors on one side and a single male RJ-11 on the other side. 
You can buy/steal this at Radio Shit..er..Shack. To use it requires 
little intelligence and absolutely no instructions, however, for 
those who are REALLY new to the field, plug it into the jack in 
the TNI(after unplugging the customer wiring) and plug both your 
phone and the customer wiring into it. Now you can connect with 
out disabling the phones in the building.

	Under the customer access door, there's another door 
marked "telco access". It gives access to the entire contents of 
the TNI. This door opens with a 3/8 inch nutdriver/socket wrench/etc... 
The customer access door is just a part of the telco access door. It's 
screwed down onto the telco access door, not the box itself, so 
when the telco access door is opened, the customer access door goes 
with it.

	The best tool for opening this and many other cans is the 
can wrench sold by Harris-Dracon. It is double ended, with 3/8 on 
one end and 7/16 on the other. They also manufacture security bit 
inserts in 5/32 and 5/16 sizes. The use for these will be discussed 
much later.

	Underneath the telco access door, things get a bit 
more interesting.  There are 5 large bolt terminals, each with 
a number of wires and washers on them, which are tightened down 
with a 3/8 nut. The terminals are arranged as a square, with a 
bolt at each corner, with the fifth bolt in the center. These 
terminals are where the drop line from the pole interfaces with 
the wires leading the RJ-11 jack the customer wiring plugs into. 
The drop line is a 2 pair cable that could easily be mistaken for 
a power line of some sort. The pairs are laid out as follows: 
Pair one: Orange/Orange-White. Pair two: Blue/Blue-White.
(I have two lines)..Pair one connects to the upper post, 
and pair two connects to the lower pair of posts.

	The last piece of the TNI is a small rectangular 
circuit board, about 1 3/4  inches by 3/4 of an inch. It has 
color coded leads with spade lugs for tip and ring, with 4 
components in series between tip and ring. The board is wired 
across the bolt terminals for tip and ring, so it is in parallel 
with the customer wiring. The components are arranged as follows.
(yes, I know ASCII art sucks, but try to bear with me)

TIP----cathode|<|anode(1N5229)---47pf---anode|>|cathode
(1N5229)---10k 1/2 watt resistor---RING

Here's what's going on: The 10k 1/2 watt resistor is for 
current limiting, so the diodes don't get fried during ringing 
pulses. The diodes are arranged so that the anodes are pointing 
towards each other. The important thing about the diodes is that 
1N5229 is a 4.3 volt zener diodes. The way they are wired, one of 
them will be reverse biased at all times, no matter which way the 
polarity of the voltage is oriented. A zener diode, when reverse 
biased, will block current from passing through it just like any 
other rectifier diode, UNTIL the voltage reaches the breakdown 
voltage of the zener diode, which in this case is 4.3 volts. Once 
that voltage is reached, the diode will limit the voltage going 
through it to 4.3 volts, even if the reverse biased voltage goes 
higher than that.

	The capacitor in the middle is to isolate the two zener 
diodes from each other. The capacitor will not allow voltage to 
pass through it under any circumstances, except for a small 
leakage voltage(no dielectric is perfect) 

As far as I can tell, this circuit board serves as overvoltage 
protection for the phones attached to the customer wiring. Since 
the circuit is in parallel with the customer wiring, the whole 
thing acts as a voltage divider, and the zener diodes help to 
regulate the voltage.

Note: I may be wrong about the purpose of the board, but 
this seems to be what it's doing , to the best of my knowledge.


Line Recording Indicator
By (Harvester OF Souls)
This is for a telephone-to-recorder. 
NOTE: Listening in is illegal unless authorized by at least one
party on the phone line.

Equipment: Soldering iron, solder, electrical tape or heat shrink.
Needs:     Double Female RJ-11 Plug adapter, 1 LED, 1 SPDT switch,
           1 Stereo plug.

Instructions:
Open up the RJ-11 plug & cut the YELLOW & BLACK wires in the CENTER.
If there isn't a yellow wire, cut the white.  Twist the two wires
together on each end & solder them together. now tape up the exposed
wires with electrical tape, or use heat shrink. 
Cut the RED & GREEN wires directly in the center. Solder 1 red 
lead of the wire to 1 lead on the switch. on the lead furthest away 
from the red, solder one lead of the LED on it. Take the stereo plug 
& solder 1 lead to the lead on the LED that is left. Now solder the 
second pole of the stereo plug to the green wire. 
USAGE:
When the switch is flipped, & the plug is attached, the LED will light 
up.  That means that it is in use. (Recording or listening). When the 
plug is in and the LED is OFF, then the device is off. Plug it into a 
recorder & next time someone is on the phone, hit record & flip the 
switch.
Happy listening!  :)

***Tip of the month(or whatever the fuck)***

When running two lines over 4 conductor cable that isn't 
twisted pair, watch out for crosstalk. I did this a while back, and 
it works just fine electrically of course, but the crosstalk is a pain. 

Note: this could also be used to listen in on conversations, 
and is almost undetectable, since inductive coupling will not 
produce an appreciable voltage drop in a phone line...You'd 
probably do well to get a ferrite rod from an radio tuning circuit 
and wind both pairs around it for better coupling.



Maniac's Guide to Lockpicking and Forced Entry

	By: Maniac (who else?)

Preface

	Much of the stuff in here is knowledge I absorbed from 
documents like The MIT Guide to Lockpicking and Jolly Roger's  
lockpicking file. Of course, a lot of it is random stuff I've 
figured out of learned from various people over the years. I'm not 
trying to rip off anybody's work here. Thanx to people who had a 
hand in writing all the files I've learned stuff from. Thanx to 
Rat for the dent puller idea.

	
First, I'll address lockpicking. Picking a conventional lock 
usually involves applying torque to the lock cylinder while 
manipulating the pins with a pick. The goal is to push up each 
pin so that the split between each pin and the driver pin above 
it is lined up with the edge of the cylinder, and make it stick 
in that position. This is known as setting the pins. You must 
apply torque to the cylinder in order to set the pins and keep 
them set. Once all the pins are set, the cylinder will rotate and 
the lock will open.

	Some locks have pins on both sides of the keyway 
(keyhole). There are a couple of varieties of this type of 
lock. The high-security version has a larger number of pins 
(like 5 or 6) on each side of the keyway. It is frequently used 
on auto ignitions. The lower-security version is used in less 
critical applications. It has fewer pins (typically 3 or 4 pins) 
than the high security version. This type of lock is often 
used for turning vending machines on and off, securing glass 
cases in retail stores, and on most garden-variety display cases.

	Now that we've covered the basics of picking and some 
common types of locks, let's concentrate on opening the suckers, 
since that's what everyone wants to do..

	Locks can be picked using a torque wrench and a thin 
steel pick with a triangular or rounded end...however, picking a 
decent lock takes time, even when done by someone who knows 
what they're doing. Sure, you've seen locks opened in seconds 
in the movies, but in real life it doesn't tend to work that 
way. That's why we have forced entry, which works on the 
principle of  "screw picking it, just break the fu#*ing thing"

	To break into things, you need some tools. A good 
swift kick and some bodyweight can often be a useful tool. 
I also recommend the following stuff. You don't need it all 
at once, but it's good to have around.

Bolt cutters
	18" are very portable and good for getting through fences
	30" are good for bigger stuff, especially cutting 
        locks on dumpsters when dumpster diving
Crowbars
	Great for Jimmying doors and cabinets
	Short ones for little stuff
	Long ones for heavy duty stuff
Hacksaw
	Lots of uses
Screwdrivers
Pliers
Slide Hammer(dent puller)
Screw it into lock cylinders, then bam! Rips em out when you 
throw the slide(supposedly) I've never tried it before, so I 
don't know for sure, but it might work.
Hammers
Chisels
Wrenches
Tamper-Torx bits for removing security screws
Tamper hex (a must for stealing payphones without making a mess)
Allen Wrenches
Whatever other hand tools you might need to take something apart

Parting Words

I'm sure I a lot of you though Security Breach was no longer 
around, since it's been so long since the last issue. I hope 
this issue dispels that notion...We're still here. I've just 
been busy, that's all. Hopefully issue 4 will come out in a more 
timely fashion.

Well, anyways....until next time , keep exploring and 
exploiting...And remember, say YES to software reverse 
engineering. The legislators can shove that bill where it 
fucking belongs...
