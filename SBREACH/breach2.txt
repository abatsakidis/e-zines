You probably want to know how to beat the system and explore it 
to your heart's content.  Well, here's a zine that'll help you do just 
that. Security Breach is a hacking/phreaking zine devoted to all kinds 
of hacking related activities. If it involves manipulating a system to 
gain access to things you would not otherwise have access to, 
WE WILL COVER IT.
	Security Breach is founded on the basic principle that systems 
of all kinds are meant to be defeated and exploited, and that it's always 
fun to get something for nothing. There is simply so much useful 
information out there that the powers that be would like you not to have 
and use. But we're here to tell the powers that be where they can shove it, 
and give you all the info you need to have all sorts of fun with the 
system.  We will have info on: vending machines, lock-picking, security 
systems, anti-theft systems, phone phreaking, sabotage, and all sorts of
crazy pranks and MUCH, MUCH more.  Enjoy

this info. 

	Ok, now the disclaimer's out of the way, so it's time for more FUN

ATM Phone tricks

Lets say you're downtown, and all the fortress phones are muted, and
there's no place to plug your beige box in without being noticed: You're 
out of luck, right? WRONG. just find the nearest ATM hut, and you've got 
yourself a phone call, provided you brought your tone dialer or combo box 
along. You don't even need an ATM card to do this trick. In my experience, 
any card with a magnetic strip will open the door on the ATM hut. Often, 
ATM's have a courtesy phone you can use to get help with transactions, 
or I suppose If somebody's waiting outside to rob you or something. Here's 
how it works: You pick up the receiver, and it automatically dials the 
number of the help line for you. The phone has no buttons, just a receiver 
and a big switch hook mounted in the wall next to the ATM. If you pick up 
the receiver and keep jiggling the switch hook VERY lightly to keep 
cutting off the connection, you can usually get it to give you a dial 
tone without dialing for you. This is where the phun begins. Whip
out your tone dialer, and dial whatever the fuck you want. It's a free 
call, and the buildings tend to be heated, so it's good for in the winter. 
I would recommend limiting your calls to 5 minutes, since after all, 
there's probably a camera on you. You might want to wear a hooded 
sweatshirt and baseball cap to make yourself less recognizable. Have phun, 
and be careful!!!



                   Programming the Verifone Tranz 330 Credit Card Reader

           By Maniac

Note: This is not a an absolutely complete guide to programming the 
Tranz 330.  I haven't been able to crack the passworded options yet, so 
I don't know what's behind them.

Here's the programming info I do know:

Hold down * and 3 in normal operation mode (the mode you're in right 
after you turn it on)

"DIAGNOSTICS"

1=Memory Test
segments of display slowly change to different characters, from left 
to right

2=Key Test
   1=1111111111111111
   2=2222222222222222
   3=3333333333333333
   4=4444444444444444
   5=5555555555555555
   6=6666666666666666
   7=7777777777777777
   8=8888888888888888
   9=9999999999999999
   *=****************
   0=0000000000000000
   #=################
   Backspace=BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
   Alpha=CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
   Func/Enter=DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

3=*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,

Then

    0000000000000000

Then

    *0,

4=WIPE CARD NOW

when I wiped a card that wasn't a credit card (a hotel door key), it said:

NO STRT SENTINEL

and occasionally:

PARITY ERROR

5=nothing...error beep

6=NO RING

7=ENTER PASSWORD

8=ENTER PASSWORD

9=ENTER ACCOUNT #

I type a number and press func/enter...

    EXPIRY DATE MMYY

I type a number and press func/enter...

    AMOUNT OF SALE ?

I enter price and press func/enter

    DIALING

    WAITING FOR ANSR

   TRANSMITTING

    RECIEVING

    DEMO APP XXXX or XXXX (xxxx is a 4 digit number starting with 9, xxxxx 
is a 5 digit number starting with 1

     Then it automatically goes back to the normal display

0=TZ 330 3E2EU3.40

    then if I press a button(except clear) it displays a possible message, 
and if I press it again it displays the next possible message, 
alphabetically. If I hold a button(except clear) down, it will run through 
the whole list of messages, alphabetically, beginning with TZ 330 3E2EU3.40. 
There are 174 messages if I counted correctly.

*=NO ENQ FROM HOST

    If I press 1, 4, or 7 it says "CREDIT CARD" then "NO MECHANT ID"

    If I press 2, 5, or 8 it says "PRIVATE CARD" then "NO MERCHANT ID"

    If I press 3,6, or 9 it says "CHECK" then "NO MERCHANT ID"

    The "NO MERCHANT ID" message may occur because I disconnected the 
backup battery and dumped the RAM before doing this. The merchant ID was 
lost in the process...

    If I press * or #, it makes an error beep

    If I press Alpha, it makes a different error beep and drops out of
diagnostic mode

    If I press Func/enter, it drops out of diagnostic mode and asks 
"FUNCTION?"

    If I press 0, It drops out of diagnostic mode and goes to memory 
dialer, where I can dial 3 digits, and then an equal sign appears after 
the number, and I can't type any more numbers.

    If I press Back Space, It says "POST DIAL"

Back Space= "BARCODE TEST"

Alpha="RTC CHIP TEST"

   then lets you set

   DAY OF WEEK
   YEAR
   MONTH
   DATE
   HOUR
   AM=0 PM=1
   MINUTES
   SECONDS

Also, If you hold down * and Clear in normal operation mode, it asks for a
password.


AOL Riot 98
forwarded to me by ref pppop(jgg67@hotmail.com)

About a year ago there was a riot on America Online.  This riot consisted 
of a few hundred  kids that annoyed people in chatrooms.  Many people took 
this as a joke. Whatever the case me be, thier plan was good but they went 
about it the wrong way.  Before I get down to business, let me start from 
the begining. There are currently over 11 million people who use America 
Online.  They are by far the biggest Internet access provider.  The 
constitution grants us free speech in a public area.  Cyberspace is the 
largest public area known to man.  There are a lot of people that can't 
deal with some of the people that reside on the Internet  They have every 
right to be there as the next person. Because of this conflict, the topic 
of free speech on the Internet has always been a tough situation.  America 
Online does not allow free speech anywhere on their service.  They 
constantly control every move you make.  Now, if there was to be another 
hearing on this situation, which I heard thier is going to be, how does it
look when the largest Internet Service Provider controls the speech of over 
11 million people across the world? That makes up over half of the people 
on the Internet.  And not only are they taking away your right, they are 
charging you two dollars more per month in April to take away your rights.  
But why should it stop there?  If we let ourselves get pushed around by 
government and corporations, they will keep pushing us around and we will 
continue to lose our rights.  I know you must be thinking that I am one of 
the conspiarcy theorists or militia members.  NO.  I am 
just an average citizen like you.  

Now, where am I going with this?  AOLRIOT 98.  It's not what your thinking. 
Instead of bothering people in chatrooms, we are going to make sure our 
message gets across to the powers that be.

On Saint Patrick's Day, March 17 1998, we will call up America Online 
and demand that we want free speech and that we will not have our rights
violated.  I chose Saint Patrick's Day so that it will be easy to remember. 
The best part about it is, you don't have to even use AOL to particapate in
AOLRIOT 98.  All you need is a telephone.  A list of numbers is printed 
below.  Please start calling from 6pm EST - 10pmEST.  When they get a few 
thousand phonecalls on one day withing a four hour time span by people 
demanding free speech, maybe they'll get the hint. I ask all of you to 
please foward this to as many people as possible.  We have a month to get 
this spread around.  Even if you do not wish to take part of this, plese 
pass this around to everyone so that they will know what is
taking place.  Remember the AOLRIOT 98 is all about free speech.

****Editor's Note: This sounds like a damn good idea. A couple tips though. 
You might want to do this from a beige box somewhere, and under NO 
circumstances should you give out your screen name, if you have one. I can 
easily imagine AOL cancelling the accounts of people who make trouble for 
them. They also probably have ANI, since many 800 numbers do, and if you 
used your home phone, they might be able to figure out what your screen 
name is by crossreferencing their billing information.

        Message from the Editor (and author of the whole thing for that
matter..)

now for a quick break for some misc.  info that I'm sure somebody will find
useful

This is stuff that doesn't have enough substance to be an article, but is
interesting nonetheless.

For those of of you in south Florida, I have a ringback. I have tested 
it from Miami international airport, when I was on vacation:

Dial 780-6095. and it will tell you to hang up and dial 780-6321. Do so, 
then hang up. The phone should ringback, and when you pick it up it will 
say "Thank you for using the automated ringback service", or something 
like that.  Where'd I get it? The operator told me.....I just asked her 
for it. No social engineering required, no nothing.

Also, I've found a nice phone for converting into a beige box. It's a 
one-piece touchtone phone made by radio shack, and it's part # is 43-857A. 
If they don't have it, try to get them to order it, and see if it comes in 
black. I don't have one of these, since I have a TS22 butt set and don't 
need one, but it's a VERY small phone. It looks like a thick flip-fone 
with a cord. The part with the mouthpiece folds up. You seriously could 
probably fit the thing in a jacket pocket without any trouble at all. If 
you're making a beige, you probably need a can wrench too. Go to 
www.jensentools.com they make a nice can wrench, and also sell 
optional security bits for it. get those too. I'm going to get myself
one, since I really like jensen stuff. They're some DAMN good tools..

Oh yeah, for those of you who like cracking school PBX's, I'm thinking of
writing an article for security breach 3 about the Mitel SX200 PBX, my 
school has one, and I've been through it pretty thoroughly.

Last, but most importantly, I'd like to extend my thanks to the following
people who have been cool to me in some way or another..

Extra Special Thanks to Mohawk and Mr. Seuss of OCPP for being my 
distro site.

Thanks to: Rat, Nostradamus, Smokes (but lose the ego, dude), 
Jen Martino for creating TWPYHR with all the cool numbers on it, 
Nothingg, and everybody else who engages in intelligent discussion in 
alt.phreaking, regardless of what their ISP is.  Major thanx to my 
girlfriend, for keeping me sane....and to Mike at Radio Shack for 
letting me dumpster dive there..

No thanx to: Feds,Congress, most law enforcement(you're not all bad, but it
sure seems that way at times), a certain employee of CVS corp.(If I see you
again, I'm getting out the bat and doing some "percussive maintainence" as 
Rat would say), the media,(a.  so what if the kids broke into the pentagon, 
and you never printed ANYTHING about Kevin Mitnick's 3'rd anniversary in 
custody. b. There is more to news than which skank is blowing the president 
at the moment, and don't you forget it.) also, the guy who was a dick about 
dumpster diving, and of course, Hell Atlantic...thanx for the handset, 
manuals, wire, and tools, suckers..

                                      The Joys of Dumpster Diving

Preface: Mohawk was going to have me write this for OCPP, but I decided 
to keep it around and put in out in Security Breach..So here it is


Well, I can't think of a stranger place to be writing about dumpster
diving....an airplane headed for Miami at 35,000 feet, with out a trash 
can in a 40 mile radius, most likely. But hey, what the fuck...
    First, let's establish a definition of what dumpster diving is. I 
define it as the art of getting useful goods and information out of 
somebody else's trash. This can include electronics, scrap materials, 
credit card numbers, confidential info, and even cans and bottles that 
can be turned in for money. 
    The second important aspect of trashing is to keep two simple things in
mind: 
      1. 95% of people have NO IDEA how the fuck to fix things. They
         tend to throw out anything that doesn't work exactly right.

      2. America is a throwaway society. If something isn't needed 
         anymore, it tends to get thrown away, especially by corporations 
         who are too busy to find a buyer for it, and too wealthy to care. 
         Just because it's in the trash, don't think that it's broken. 
         There's a good chance it's not. And even if it is broken,
         often the problem is something very minor, like a broken wire, 
         a blown fuse, bad solder joint, or a mechanical part which is 
         out of alignment or broken. 

	I'm not going to cover troubleshooting in depth, since it's not 
something a phile can easily teach; it takes years to get good at 
it. I've been fixing stuff since I was about 8 years old. I'm almost 17 
now, and there's still so much I don't know. Probably, the two most 
important qualities to have are a basic knowledge of electronics 
and a knack for understanding how things work. 
	But anyways, back to the main idea...Here's a list of some of 
the stuff I've been able to haul home (usually by bike) in the last 
month and a half or so:

-Panasonic KX-F50 fax machine (the only problem was a stuck hookswitch.)
-a pair of 3-ton adjustable auto jack stands.
-nice rat shack cordless phone.
-rat shack hand video game
-rat shack 2-line phone
-6-outlet power strip (was shorted, needed a new capacitor and diode)
-Bud light beer sign with digital clock display(tossed a 10watt red bulb 
in it, and now it's on my wall.)
-digital bike speedometer (didn't have the part it mounts on, or any 
hardware, but it makes a great digital clock)
-lots of circuit boards and components
-tons of wire and connectors
-40 feet!! of velcro (both sides too)  This stuff's not cheap!
-large screwdriver
-high speed drill bit
-metal file
-10 inch MTX eliminator subwoofer
-30 inch TV set. (works, but has strange stuff happening with the 
picture. The edges of the picture are wavy. It's wicked trippy to watch.)

and the list goes on.........

    Most people seem to think that dumpster runs are best done at night.
However, I have a somewhat different strategy. I do most of my dumpster 
diving in the day, simply because It's easier to get out of the house 
during the day, and the parents don't really like it when I dumpster dive 
at night..I like to work in the day, because it obvious what I'm doing 
and what I'm not doing, so It's harder for somebody to accuse of doing 
something else I had nothing to do with. Even though I'm visible, people 
don't tend to care what I'm doing.
	However, I wouldn't do Telco or government buildings at night, 
since they tend to quite anal about stuff. I got confronted once at a 
certain state police crime lab. I was very matter-of-fact about what I 
was doing, and I explained that I was looking for old electronics, and 
told them about a couple things I had found elsewhere and fixed. So they 
just told me to get lost, and didn't give me any major trouble.  It's 
better to come back at night when nobody's around if the people who work 
somewhere are really anal about stuff. 

Until next issue, keep em' phreakin'..........I know I'm already working 
on more articles for issue 3, I just hope some other people will write 
some too..
