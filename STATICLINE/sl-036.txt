  Message From the Editor
----=--=------=--=------=--=--
     Been a while, hasn't it?  My appologies for missing last month's
  issue.  But I'm sure you will all understand.  If you want to know what
  I was up to during the month of September, feel free to read my
  editorial this month.

     You'll also be happy to know that development has resumed on
  SceneSpot.  At least, I started coding for it again.  I've been doing a
  lot of minor tweaks to the interface, lately, but I also have begun
  work on the links database.  Eventually, all the links listed in every
  issue will be available in a huge searchable database on SceneSpot.
  That should make things a bit easier for web surfing.

     Well, we do have a pretty good, but small, issue this month.  There
  aren't many parties to review in September, but that won't stop us from
  reviewing demos and tunes.  So, you'll see a lot of that this month.

     As always, we're always looking for more good writers.  You don't
  have to write something every month, but if you were to drop an article
  on us every once in a while, that would definately help the content.
  This magazine is what you make of it.  And we're definately willing to
  go the extra mile, so long as you're willing.

     Until next time...

  Coma 3 Invitation
  By: Coplan and Phoenix
----=--=------=--=------=--=--
  It's that time again.  It is time for the third annual Coma party in
  Quebec.

  Coma 3 will begin the 16th of November, 2001, in the evening at the
  Polytechnique de l'Universite de Montreal (Montreal Polytechnic
  University).  The party will continue on until that Sunday, the 18th of
  November.

  At this 36 hour demo party, you can expect to find many interesting
  competitions, demos shown on the big screen, cheap beer and up to $2,000
  in prizes.  Oh, and let's not forget the part that everyone loves:  A
  LAN network hooked up to the 'net.  So bring your computer, hook up, and
  grab all the stuff off Hornet that you should've way back when.

  If you pre-register online, you can get tickets for this party for $20.
  Should you wait 'til you get to the door, tickets are $25.

  All those interested should visit the official Coma website:

  In Tune
     "etTV" by Andromeda
  By:  Coplan
----=--=------=--=------=--=--

  -=- Introduction -=-
  I have spent the better part of the day browsing around the web looking
  for some good current tunes.  I don't know what happened, but the last
  few months have been a dry spot for good tunage.  So, I guess I'll
  revert to stuff that's a tiny bit older than I typically review.

  So I jumped back on the Fairlight website (http://fairlight.scene.org)
  and grabbed a bunch of tunes off of there.  One of the tunes I found was
  the "etTV" by Andromeda.  A couple of months ago, Seven did a review of
  the demo by the same name.  So, it popped into my mind, and I downloaded
  it.


  -=- The Tune -=-
  The tune is an MP3.  Unfortunately, this means I know nothing about its
  creation.  But, the quality level on this particular tune is rivaled by
  very few songs.  The style of the song is hard to place.  On the
  website, it's listed as Ambient/Demo.  I don't know if that's truly a
  good description, but that's what I'll go with.  It doesn't really
  matter though, because if you like a song, you like it.

  One of the things that impresses me most about this tune is the fact
  that there are so many different moods within the song.  It starts in
  this trancy little mellow riff.  As the song continues, more and more
  things are brought to the ear, like a base line, and some simple
  percussion.  But what really makes it crazy is that at about 2:00 into
  the song, the song almost changes completely.  It's as if you are
  listening to a guy changing stations on the radio.  If you listen
  closely, you can tell it's the same song, and this part does relate to
  the rest of the song.  But it's fast, it's dramatic, and it's well
  written.  The percussion is much more complicated here, but it still
  follows a similar riff.  But this is the best part of the song.  You get
  almost a full minute and a half of this, complete with the over-dramatic
  electric guitar that is so common in oldskool demo tunes.

  But it changes again.

  Again, I say the most interesting thing about this tune is the drastic
  differences between the movements of this song.  The end of the song is
  very ambient.  It sounds almost bizarre.  I might have to grab the demo
  (I never did get it) and see how it fits with the demo.  I'm sure it
  does pretty well, as demos do seem to change pace rather quickly like
  that.  Aside from this last part, however, I really like the rest of the
  tune.

  -=- Conclusion -=-
     One of my pet peeves is when an artist doesn't include any information
  in the song.  From the filename, it's difficult to figure out exactly
  what the song is titled.  Granted, it's not that hard, but you get the
  idea.  It might not be a track, but there is still opportunity to fill
  in the details on the MP3's ID3 tag.  One should always do that...even
  if you're just tossing it off to a friend.  Fill in all the possible
  information that you can so that your listeners don't have to.

  Other than that, the song is very entertaining and well worth the
  download.  It's an interesting peice worthy of a good listen, and I
  highly recommend it.  Seven will tell you to grab the demo to.  I might
  have to do that.  After all, this tune has peaked my interests in the
  demo.  Hear that demo-coders?  Toss the tune out on the 'net, and
  someone might be more likely to download your demo as well.  I don't see
  any harm in releasing the music separate from the demo.  It's worth
  doing, and you might pick up a few more downloads on your demo.

  Retro Tunage
    Music by Zauron
  By:  Tryhuk
----=--=------=--=------=--=--

     The last summer weekend is passing by and I'm deciding what to write.
  I don't like articles which waste readers time and don't bring to them
  anything of value. But, because I also realize that there would be no
  diskmag without articles, although they might seem unimportant and
  boring to too many people and very often also to author, I will feature
  today another one or maybe more songs that set sail on the waves of the
  sea called "The Internet".

     I can't imagine a scene artist who would more fulfils the concept of
  a person producing "summer music". It is hard to describe what can be
  meant by the term "summer music". Some people imagine bouncy tracks
  played on the summer parties. But I mean a living music with feeling
  eminating from your soul and filling that small holes made out of small,
  everyday pains.

     That musician is none other than Zauron. I can't choose a single
  track right now but all his tracks have lots in common. Let's take, for
  example, a song called "Find a way". It is a perfect example of his
  skills. The track is carried in a way which reminds me a bit of a
  Leviathan tune. Its structure is one of a typical scene guitar track
  with a guitar in front, nice bass in background and organ leading the
  chord progression and filling the space. Percussion doesn't use any
  sharp sound, but it works well in setting the tempo and fills the
  spectrum of the track to achieve a complete sound. Although the track is
  very calm, the melody which is played by the guitar is very alive and
  very well elaborated and keeps you listening the whole time. Similar to
  this track is "Game of Pain", which adds to this interesting breaks and
  transitions and, of course, a bit of more experimental electronic sound.
  It is fascinating how smoothly the track moves from soft guitars to
  demostyle sound and back. I wish that more current releases would be
  tracked with that skill. And I'm not talking about a skill of a person
  who "tracks". I mean a skill of a musician.

     But Zauron also has releases that lean toward ambient music. Examples
  of this can be "The Owl" or "Fantaziser - part III". Surprisingly, in
  them you can find the most important aspects of his music: emphasis on
  percussion and of course on melody, even in the leads that appear only
  for a short while. I also have to pay respect to Zauron for his
  excellent chord progressions.  If you play with the samples, you'll find
  out that these chords are the ones by which the samples sound most
  naturally.

     I believe that Zauron belongs among people who never released a track
  that wouldn't be worth releasing. Of course some of them are better and
  some are worse but that applies on all aspects of life. Better visit his
  directory at scene.org.

     And hey! Do you want some music news? I heard an Alpha Conspiracy
  album "Cipher", but I've got to say that my favourite track is still a
  song called "Winter" with its underworld sound. It can be heard on
  mp3.com site and  informations on ordering the album can be found at
  www.alphaconspiracy.com. Have a nice October! Because it's a "Beautiful
  Day".

  Screen Lit Vertigo
     "Cadence And Cascade" by Andromeda Software Development
  By:  Seven
----=--=------=--=------=--=--

  -=- Cadence And Cascade by Andromeda Software Development (ASD) -=-

  (party version)

  Found at www.scene.org
  1st place at the Digital Nexus 2001 demo compo

  System requirements: 13 MB HD, Win9x, 800Mhz CPU, "decent 3D card"
                       (openGL compatible)

  Test Machine: PIII 900 192MB, SB1024, GeForce 2MX 32MB, Win98

  The credits:
     Code: NaviS, Incus
     Gfx: Amoivikos
     3D: Nuclear/theLab
     Music: the song "Warlock" from the group Caravan

  The Demo:

     Greece isn't exactly known as a country with a very active PC
  demoscene, but they've managed to organize the Digital Nexus party,
  which has brought us one very nice winner: Cadence And Cascade. It's a
  big one, 10 MB zipped, but it's worth the download.

     It starts with an original progress bar in the form of a clock, then
  a spiral of flaming particles is shown that falls apart and recombines
  into the groupname. The title of the demo is shown with a motion-blurred
  grid of textures that twirls around, looking very nice. This is followed
  by a rapid succession of many different overlapping parts: a tunnel, a
  negative starfield, flame-like lights, transparant butterflies, an
  infinite picture zoom a la Contour, and much more. There are almost
  always two or three effects visible at the same time, keeping the demo
  fascinating. The second half of the demo is a bit slower, with some
  effects shown multiple times (the hand/fish falling apart in squares) or
  for too long (chasing that lightsource over the ADS-landscape).
  Something I'm really glad to see again are the transitions. You know,
  starting/ending or chaining together your effects in a special way, as
  was quite common before 3D cards made pure fading in/out so easy. Take a
  look at that circle thingy that ends the part with the cage, or how we
  go from the picture zoom to the cave. That's the way to go!

     The zoomer seems to use only two pictures, one with a devilish gray
  face and another with a girls head and arm, but in fact five full-screen
  images are used (just look at the data files with ACDC). In addiction,
  there are two versions of that weird fish, a couple of logos and one
  half-naked lady that is shown subliminally short during the part with
  the cage and the butterflies. I don't really like that, either you shown
  an image long enough to admire it, or you leave it out the demo
  altogether (idem with the flashes of the stamp-like logo near the end).

     The music is an instrumental progressive guitar-rock MP3 from a
  commercial group, Caravan. It's credited, but I still don't feel
  positive about it. OTOH, using an existing song makes synchronising
  easier, and Cadence And Cascade has exceptionally good syncing, both in
  the flow of the effects as in the effects themselves, for example the
  brightening of the flame-like lights at the start.

  Overall:
     Andromeda Software Development has made one very original demo, with
  solid code, design and graphics. It runs for over five minutes, although
  it wouldn't have hurt to shorten it by 30 seconds, to keep the speed of
  effects the same near the end as at the start. They don't have a
  musician, so we'll forgive the commercial music, also because it's nice
  to hear some guitars for once in a demo :). On the downside, this
  spectacle will need some power, so you won't be able to enjoy this with
  an "old" machine, see the requirements above. And one minor peeve: it's
  annoying that the demo, when finished, doesn't set your desktop back to
  it's old resolution. Fix that for the final, please! Otherwise, I hope
  ASD will make more demos of this quality, or even better. Go ASD, go!


  -=- Fears by Nah-Kolor -=-

  (final version)

  Found at ftp://ftp.klosz.art.pl/pub/scene/incoming/Abstract%2001/
  (notice the /incoming/, I've taken the liberty to upload the final to
  scene.org so you can search it there if it's been moved by the time
  you're reading this)

  1st place at the Abstract 2001 democompo

  System requirements: 23,9 MB HD, Windows. Nothing else mentioned :/

  Test Machine: PIII 900 192MB, SB1024, GeForce 2MX 32MB, Win98

  The Credits:
     Code: Performer
     Graphics: Spark
     Objects: Spark, Performer
     Music: Siatek/Distort waves

  The Demo:
     Fears is a very large demo: almost 24 megs. And as soon as you start
  it, you know what's the cause: the extremely detailed pictures. It
  starts with a partially unrolled 3D roll of photo film, showing several
  photos, and goes on with the old-fashioned copper-clad camera, the old
  gloomy buildings, the painted sky,... All pictures use the same colors,
  mostly brown and orange, and have always a mix of sharp details and hazy
  colors. Textures are pre-lit, so even though there's no gouraud/pong
  shading used, the models still look good. Good-looking is not a synonym
  of realistic, however: the butterfly moves awkwardly, flying more
  vertical than horizontal, and the fishes keep their mouth open, which
  looks strange too. OTOH, the simulated light in the water is quite nice.

     The music starts with strong percussion, later an ambient, relaxed
  lead with bird samples is added to this. The music changes a few times
  through the demo, synced to the changes of 3D scenes, but keeps the same
  slow speed. This, combined with the sepia pictures and the steady camera
  movements, gives the demo a nostalgic, dreamy feeling. A short quote
  from a poem by E.A. Poe adds to this.

  Overall:
     Fear is pure eye (and ear) candy: a 100% 3D demo with exceptional
  beautiful images and textures plus a fitting soundtrack. There's no
  story, no dazzling new effects, no "look mama we can copy that style
  too!" But I don't understand why such a peaceful demo is called "Fears".
  True, there's a skull hidden in a texture, and the buildings look grim,
  but fear is not the dominant feeling I have after watching this demo. On
  the technical side, I think the filesize could be halved by using the
  .PNG file format, which is lossless too, instead of uncompressed .TGA's.
  Not everyone has broadband access, and keeping an eye on the filesize
  can only increase your audience.

     The World Will Never Be The Same
  By: Coplan
----=--=------=--=------=--=--

     Those of you who know me know that I work not far from New York City.
  In fact, I can see it from my office window.  It's a ways off still, but
  I can see it plain as day.  As you can imagine, the whole World Trade
  Center tragedy has had quite an impact on my life.  Contrary to what you
  may think, this isn't a political article demanding for retribution or
  any of that stuff.  What has come out of this whole situation, for me at
  least, has been my outlook on life.  Mind you, my priorities have
  changed.  Unfortunately, that is why Static Line was delayed as much as
  it has been.

     One of the most painful things that has ever happened to me happened
  on the 14th of September.  My company paid everyone to basically not
  work. They did, however, require that we make some effort to raise money
  and goods for those who were volunteering in the wreckage.  So my fellow
  co-workers and I set out about town to beg for donations.  Had this been
  any other situation, most people would've probably turned us away. Times
  have changed, though, and people were a lot more generous than they
  typically would be.  I personally managed to collect almost $2,000 in
  money and goods.  The best part about this little campaign is that our
  company matched everything we collected for the total pot of cash. All
  together, our company managed to collect about $14,000, bringing the
  company matched total to $28,000.  We were quite proud of ourselves.

     But then came the difficult part.

     Being one of the higher grossing collectors in the company, I was one
  of the 6 people that got to take a ride up to Ground Zero to distribute
  what we had collected.  So that Saturday, we all met and went on our way
  to buy some more supplies and things of need.  Then we started our trip
  to New York City.  It was a difficult trip for two reasons.  1)  All the
  roads going to lower Manhatten were closed.  2)  The closer you got to
  the city, the more of a reality it had become.  We arrived at Ground
  Zero in the early afternoon.  I can't describe it.  I can't even truly
  believe what I saw.

     The truth is, only several weeks early, I had been in those towers.  I
  had pressed my face against the windows in the observatory lounge, and I
  felt empowered.  I was glad to be a part of the human race, one which
  had the technology to build towers that large, and that stable.  But
  after seeing what I saw that saturday, I am not so sure what the human
  race is truly capable of.

     All said and done, I feel empowered once again.  I'm not marveling at
  what the human race can build, or the technology that we posess.  I'm
  marveling right now at what the human race is capable of mentally.  This
  is a race that will become much more mature in years to come.  We aren't
  there yet, but we're well on our way.

     This is our learning experience.  And let it be a lesson that is
  learned.  The world will never be the same again.
