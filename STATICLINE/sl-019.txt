  Message From the Editor
----=--=------=--=------=--=--
     Wow, we've come a long way, havn't we?  Almost a full 100 subscribers,
  and not too far from our two year anniversary.  Lets break 100 before
  issue 24. Tell your friends, get everyone involved.  You love us, so why
  wouldn't someone else?

     I'd like to go much further.  I'd like to make this a magazine that
  everyone would like to turn to as a key resource in the scene.  For that
  reason, I'm asking for anyone willing to write any scene based article
  to please notify me.  Run your ideas by me, I'd be happy to listen.
  I have an assignment for all readers.  Please write me back and tell me
  what columns you love the most.  What is most helpful to you?  What
  would you like to see?  What could we do to make this e-zine better?

     We got a small but very interesting issue this month.  It is kind of
  humorous for me to look at the issue, and see that most of the articles
  this month mention the audiophonik CD.  I appologize for that, but it
  has influenced me quite a bit.  Anyhow, I review the whole album from
  Imphobia for In Tune this month.  I have also included their press
  release which will give you much more information about the album, as
  well as information on how to get your own copy.  Virt is also back with
  his latest rants about the Home-Style DJ.  Unfortunately, Dilvish has
  taken a brief vacation.  Hopefully, he'll return in the future for
  another Zen.

  Until next month...

  In Tune
     "audiophonik"  -- A Complete CD Review
  By:  Coplan and Setec
----=--=------=--=------=--=--
  -=- Introduction -=-
     Let me say this is not my typical review.  It isn't often that I'm
  asked to review a whole album.  Fortunately, this isn't the first time
  either, and I think I can make sense of it all.  Darkness (Jeff) of
  Imphobia (aka Van Audenhove FJ), asked me to review this album, and I am
  glad that he thought of Static Line.  Coordinated by Jeff and Dan Wright
  (Pallbearer/Toxic Zombies), the audiophonik album provides us with quite
  a nice sampling of scene music.  Because of the nature of this review, I
  regret that Setec was not able to join us this month for In Tune (He's
  out skiing somewhere in Europe anyhow).

     This isn't your typical Scene Album.

     I was quite surprised when I got my copy of the CD.  It is a
  professionally mastered CD complete with cover art and a full 16 page
  cover booklet.  There are twelve songs by twelve different artists (all
  fairly well known I might add).  I won't get into too much details about
  statistics -- A press release appears at the end of this issue that will
  give you more information.

  -=- The Disk -=-
     When I review albums, music disks and the like, I like to review the
  whole product.  That isn't very easy to do, however, as I can very
  easily bore you with my words.  I also don't like to make general
  statements.  With that in mind, please realize that I can only go into
  so much detail with this subjective review.  If you're at all curious
  about the album, it's worth it to drop a few extra bucks to get this
  album.  If you want to hear some (brief) samples of the songs appearing
  on this disk, you can jump on over to http://www.imphobia.org to listen.

  Now, onto the good stuff -- 'cause this is what you care about.

  -=- The Music -=-
     Now, without getting into the technicalities of what kind of song each
  song is, I'm simply going to say that most of the songs on this album
  have serious electronic influences.  The first track, 'Flow' by Moby is
  almost ambient in its presentation.  'Spectral Vision' by Rez is also a
  relatively ambient/trance tune.  But those of you who have been around a
  while will definately notice that Rez hasn't escaped his chip-tune days.
  Kudos to the chip-tune style.  Looking for some other styles?  Don't
  worry, they exist on the album.  For example, 'Third Millenium' by
  Lluvia is a cross between dance, trance and breakbeat (actually, i'm
  listening to it now, and I am trying hard not to dance).  'Space
  Deliria' seems to resemble an alternative rock song.  I will confess
  that the only song on the album that doesn't strike me as truly
  electronic is 'Overture' by Jogeir (though some of the samples must be
  computer generated).

     So, for all you orchestral fanatics, I guess there might only be one
  song on the album that you'll like.  But, for anyone else, this album
  has quite a bit to offer.  I like to think of this album more of an
  unbiased view on the scene.  There's a little bit of everything on here,
  at least everything representative of the scene.

     Now, if you truly want to know what's on the CD, I have clipped the
  following from the press release that appears at the end of this issue.
  Redundant, but I feel it applies.

  -=- My Favorites -=-
     Okay, since I obviously can't review every single song on the album,
  I'm  going to share with you my three favorites and write a little bit
  about  each.  Since this is almost a commercial album (the artists will
  recieve  royalties), I don't feel guilty ranking the songs.  This is a
  first in  this column.

  Third Favorite:  "Flow" - Fredric 'Moby' Motte
     This is the longest song on the album, by almost a full two minutes.
  The only reason I feel a need to point that out is because it is the
  only drawback to the song:  I don't feel it needs to drag on quite so
  long.  Otherwise, it's an original tune that has definately earned a
  ranking on my list.  The song has a definate ambient feel, but it has an
  incredible use of some common (and some not-so-common) breakbeats.  The
  strengths of this song lie mostly in the high pitched instruments.  Many
  trackers use a lot of base -- which is fine, but many times it sounds
  unbalanced.  Perhaps this is a result of the professional mixing, but
  the song is incredibly well balanced.

  Second Favorite:  "Spectral Vision" - Christophe 'Rez' Resigne
     As I said earlier, this song has definate roots in the chip-tune era.
  Having entered the scene while the popularity of chip-tunes started to
  fade, I have always been drawn to the chip-tune songs.  There is a
  definate characteristic about them.  The punchy base lines, the sine
  leads and of course the mellow feel to the entire song.  This is no
  exception.  Now, how do you make the feel of chip tunes better?  Simple,
  add real drums, and atmospheric instruments in the background.
  Chip-tune purists will disagree, but I feel this is an incredible mix
  between the chip-tunes of old and the modern requirements for quality
  samples.

  Most Favorite:  "Overture" - Jogeir 'Jogeir' Liljedahl
     I'll admit it, I have a biased towards orchestral compositions.  The
  instruments might not be entirely orchestral, but the structure is
  complete.  That's not to say I don't have appreciation for the rest, but
  give me a flute and you can melt my outer shell.  This is orchestral,
  this is rock, this is digital.  I think many people will agree -- this
  is one of the best songs on the album.

  -=- Summery -=-
     I think that Imphobia could be taking the scene in a favorable
  direction with this album.  That's a good thing.  I would be telling an
  untruth if  I would tell you that I wasn't happy to be asked to review
  this album.   This album, in some way or another, has allowed me to
  believe that the  scene is still a happening place.  Thank you Darkness,
  Imphobia and  everyone affiliated with this album.

  Screen Lit Vertigo
    "Dis" by Mandula
  By:  Seven
----=--=------=--=------=--=--
  Found at www.scene.org
  1st place at Scenest VS Rage'98

  System requirements:
     3.8 MB HD, Useless Soundsystem supported soundcard, Vesa2.0 Nothing
  mentioned about amount of memory, but I would guess 16, maybe 32 MB

  Test Machine:  PII 350 64MB SB16, Win98 in dos-mode (BOOTGUI = 0)
  Win:  Crashes due to page error
  Dos:  Runs fine

  The demo:
     Well, it's winter and everyone in the scene seems to be hibernating,
  so I'll use the occasion to bring an older demo to your attention:
  Dis/Mandula. Dis is a pure effect-demo: no story, no theme, just
  effects. And to be honest, the effects rock. In a time where everybody
  tried to impress the audience with heavy 3D, Mandula put more original
  2D effects in one demo then you saw in 5 other average demos. Check out
  that liquid metal effect, or those strange colored waving lines. And do
  you remember blobs, and the classic lens-effect? Now these are combined
  in a really weird-looking blob-lens-effect! The colorful recursive
  circle/flare fractals have been shown before in other demos, but not
  very often. Of course there's some special 3D too, for example the
  boring "flight between two infinite surfaces" is upgraded with a maze.
  In addition to voxel-scapes there are now voxel-balls and voxel-tunnels
  (done with raycasting? /me wonder...). At the end, there is a hilarious
  upscroll with the greetings: halfway the screen, the names are shuffled
  to form anagrams like "faculty -> fat Lucy" or "promise -> rip some" :)

     There is a nice title screen at the start, and some more pretty
  full-screen backgrounds that look like they could be hand-pixeled. But
  the emphasis is always on the effects on top of these. The music is a
  jazz-tune, and although I don't know much about jazz, I dare to say it's
  a good one. The problem is that it is the same style all through the
  demo, so synchronizing between parts is not really noticeable, and
  there's not much other syncing :(

  Overall:
     Dis is a very good and original demo, which is definitely worth
  checking out. The only things IMHO that prevented it from becoming a
  real killer-demo are the lack of transitions between the different
  parts, and the below-average syncing. But we can't have it all, can we?

  Crackhead Trackhead (Humor)
    "Go, Go, Get Up, Coooome onnn!" -- Virt Rants About DJ Gear
  By:  Virt
----=--=------=--=------=--=--

    So, you guys hear about the Vestax at-home vinyl cutter? Huh? Isn't
  that just  insanely cool beyond words? I remember when if you wanted
  records at home you'd have to buy a $10,000 press, hire immigrant
  Mexicans to work the press and risk losing limbs in the process, and
  finally pray to several Aztec Gods such as (Polyxoactl, the god of
  vinyl) that your record lasted a while, because Miguel and Reynaldo's
  lives should not have been lost in vain. And now there's this thing.
  It's like the tablist's wet dream - A CD-R for vinyl.

    The DJ Gear industry is going through some interesting changes. Know
  that I'm not by any stretch of the imagination a DJ; I'm a sad little
  whiteboy who has never touched a table. But I've spent enough time in
  clubs, and hanging around with DJ friends, that I feel my opinion is
  worthwhile. More importantly, I've recently been in the business of
  selling equipment for such things. This was before my current stint
  with the brothel, but I really don't feel comfortable talking about
  that. I am, however, a "synth person," so I will bitch about that end of
  it.

    Yes, I'm focused on the synthesizer ingression. A lot of the big
  manufacturers are now interested in getting a piece of the DJ market by
  selling flashy, over-indulgent synth gear aimed at turntablists. My
  favorites are the Roland "Groove" gear. They have gone the way of
  athletic shoes. "Let's make a mediocre piece of equipment, slather it
  with day-glo paint, and have some big-name celebrity tell the world how
  necessary it is to his life!" This method of marketing has worked,
  sadly...  While working at Guitar Center, I saw more Kitchen DJs with
  the big gold chains, the Gold Teef, and the name-brand "ghetto"
  clothing, asking for MC-505s, than I ever wished. Maybe they like it
  because it has "5-0" in it. Granted, some of these devices are neat. I
  played with a K.A.O.S.S Pad, and despite a very idiotic name, it's a
  lot of fun. Also Electribes are neat toys; I'm planning on buying one
  because hey, it beats my current form of entertainment, which consists
  of a Speak'n'Spell and a Fender Twin Reverb.

    They have samplers, they have beatmatchers, they have toothbrushes
  which will open the garage door and play a concert for you, all at once,
  at the right price for today's "working musician." They have devices
  that will match the  speed of your voice to the speed of your
  breakbeats. How sad is that? They rely on their equipment. That's very
  very damned sad. If you must use a piece of gear along with a turntable,
  pull a Mental Floss, hook up a tracker. That's the way it should be
  done; Hardk0re control over your music.

    Another interesting trend is the "Home DJ." They market a whole line
  of keyboards aimed at the spinning enthusiast. Have ANY of you ever seen
  a Yamaha DJX??????????? I want to buy one, JUST TO SMASH IT TO PIECES.
  Nothing in the  *universe* is more annoying than those pre-made loops /
  samples (GO! COME ON! HEH HEH HEH! STOP! UUUNHHH! GET UP! (cheesy techno
  loop)) And no matter when you go into a music store, there will always
  be either some little kid or some group of college guys gathered around
  that keyboard, tapping on it haphazardly, much to the dismay of EVERYONE
  ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET. I wish they would all be shot in the head.

    Last but not least, and to digress for a second..... *What the HELL is
  up with  Autotune?* Those of you who have spoken with me on EFnet or
  Scenenet #trax know that this is my ultimate pet peeve - I can
  understand its justification when used moderately, just to sweeten
  vocals, but to crank the mofo up to full should be punishable by
  immediate death. When I first heard Cher doing this, I thought "Hey,
  neat effect." But then, once more and more pop figures began adopting
  it, I quickly tired of the artificial stepped quality it gave singing.
  The last straw was hearing the new song from Kid Rock.... I became
  visibly nauseous, pulled the car over, and cried for several minutes.
  What might have been a tolerable piece of music (Barely, I mean come
  on, this IS Kid Rock) was ruined totally. What next, are they just going
  to hook up TextAssist and have "Frank" sing the next chart-topper?
  ("What should we doooo with the drunk-en saiiilor")

    I don't think I can top that one, so I'm going to go to sleep. Good
  night, and happy Scening!

  Call to Keyboards
    CD's in the Underground
  By: Coplan
----=--=------=--=------=--=--
     With the very special review of the 'audiophonik' cd, I am reminded
  of a time when the Underground Demo Music Scene had no such resources.
  Several groups these days are offering their music compilations to the
  masses on CD.  Sure, many may be plain old CD-Rs with less than
  professional mixing and CD cases.  But, is that the issue here?  I think
  not.

     One might think I'm trying to capitalize on Imphobia's latest CD.
  But, I'll be completely honest, it truly is one of the first scene
  albums that I've been exposed to.  Is this a revolutionary idea?  I
  would say not.  I'm sure that Imphobia would likewise say the same.
  However, they sure have brought out a certain quality that didn't exist
  until now.  Is this a new trend?  I hope so.

     The first scene disk that I got was Kosmic's Archive CD (1992-1996).
  No cover art, just a simple paper envelope with a CD.  The CD certainly
  looked professional, but this wasn't a music CD, it was a combined
  Music/Data CD.  I remember reading the warning: "Do Not Play Track 1!"
  Curious me, I played it -- blew my stereo speakers -- so that's why?
  Apparently, track one is the data track.  There's nothing wrong with
  that.  But lets face it, there's a bit of quality lost there, especially
  considering the fact that I want to listen to tracks 2-4.  Don't you
  dare forget about track one.

     Next, the Hornet MODS Volume 2.  Again, this was an archive with audio
  tracks.  But, they tried a different approach.  First CD was data.  The
  second CD was the audio.  I have that one in my car as well, and I like
  the disk.  But I must say it isn't nearly as professional as the CDs I
  see these days.  Kosmic is putting out some very professional quality
  albums (forgive me, because I do not remember the recording company they
  work with).  Now, I guess you could add Imphobia to the list.

     So now we have all-audio CDs with professionaly done Jewel Cases and
  cover art.  It sounds just like any other compilation that one would get
  in a record store -- so what?  WAKE UP PEOPLE -- that's what everyone
  else does?  You'll notice that my views have changed quite a bit, just
  based on opinions returned to this article...but I think this is a very
  good trend.  The scene isn't about growing as an artist anymore.  We're
  grown up -- now the scene needs to grow up too.  What's next?  This is
  the answer -- quality music disks available to the public.  So, if you
  feel the scene is dying, guess again.  It's just a new way to create
  public music.  If it is marketed and provided as any other music CD out
  there, people will buy it.  If they like it, they'll give it another
  chance.

     Hell, just the other day, a friend of mine came to visit me after
  being out of the country for several years.  I was listening to the
  Hornet MODs disk, and she asked me about "Martian Lovesong".  "Who does
  this song?  I've never heard it before," she asked.  She was very
  dissapointed to find out that she can't buy any Necros albums in stores.
  If I hadn't explained it, for all she knew, it was some european techno
  group.  I told her to wait a couple of years, and she could maybe buy
  some.

     Do you think it's possible that the 'scene' could become the next
  music front?

     You're opinions here, please.

                 audiophonik - music for the scene generation

                     - the ultimate demo scene audio cd -

                    an imphobia & fusecon production in 1999

    (infofile & ordering information for Europe, Africa and Middle East)

 __Introduction_______________

  "audiophonik - music for the scene generation" is an audio cd compilation
  containing brand NEW, studio recorded,  mellow-ambient to slightly upbeat
  compositions from some of the best, past and present,  musicians from the
  PC and Amiga demo scene.

  When planning this CD,  our aim was  to give  these  scene musicians  the
  opportunity  to get their music produced on a professional media together
  with other great music from other great trackers and to make it available
  to everyone at a very fair prize.    It has now been over a year since we
  started this project and this time we have crossed the void and are quite
  excited to announce that we have the final product ready for shipping.

  We feel we put together quite the audio CD with some of the most talented
  musicians the scene has to offer (see the track listing below).
  audiophonik is a professionnally done production (not a CD-R), containing
  12  brand new  high quality  professionaly  recorded tracks, totalizing a
  complete playing time of over 70 mins. The CD comes in a transparent case
  with a fat full color sixteen page booklet containing pictures, text  and
  bios of each musicians.

  We are not going to attempt to bias your opinion on this project -- we'll
  let the music speak for itself.

  3) ORDERING BY INTERNATIONAL MONEY ORDER.

  To pay by international money order you have to make it throught your post
  office. Make your international money order payable to "F.J. Van Audenhove".
  International money order will only be accepted if you pay all expenses
  (check with your local post office before sending)

  Make checks payable to "F.J. Van Audenhove".  This way of payment is only
  possible for people living in belgium. Do _NOT_ send any check from other
  country (even in belgian francs) as in order to cash those checks  I would
  have to pay around 10 US$ as tax to the bank for international transfer.
