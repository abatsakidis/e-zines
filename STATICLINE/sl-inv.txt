  Message From the Editor
----=--=------=--=------=--=--
     First of all, let me tell you a little bit about this proposed
  monthly magazine.  Static Line was dreamed up by myself and other members
  of Immortal Coil to carry on the legacy of the late Trax Weekly and
  Demo News.  Once the idea started to become a reality, we recruited some
  of our friends, new and old, to help us bring you a quality publication
  every month.  Every month we will provide you with several regular columns
  including a montly song review, software reviews and a column about 3d
  acceleration and it's role in modern demos.
     So, consider this an invitation to join the mailing list.  If you are
  at all interested, give us a try.  Simply follow the directions I have
  listed below, and you can expect a new issue delivered to your e-mail
  account every month.  Our goal is to release the first official issue
  late in July, 1998.
     This is the future of the demoscene.
