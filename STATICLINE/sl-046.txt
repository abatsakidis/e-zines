  Hi Static Line readers, got your ears on?  Good, because this month's
  issue is like a buffet: it is cheap, tasty, and when you're through, you
  won't be left hungry.  This month's issue has two interviews.  One is with
  Ciaran and myself so you can get to know us a little better.  The other is
  with Nagz and Mephizto, who discuss the Hungarian scene and also their
  song "Lenina58".  (I hear if you play it backwards, you will hear the
  Mister Ed theme song).  We have 2 months of The Lineup crammed into 1
  issue!  Coplan and I have both written module reviews, about "Heaven's
  Descent" by In Tense and "Cillke" by Emit.  Coplan and Ciaran wrote
  interesting editorials about the scene, one from the angle of social
  dynamics, and the other focusing on newcomers.  And we can trust Seven to
  review demos, two of them this month: "Nighttime" and "Glitch".

  You may have noticed in the header that the email subscription count has
  dropped.  Don't be discouraged, our number of readers has grown last
  month.  We removed many stale e-mail addresses that had been bouncing.
  Please do subscribe if you haven't already.

  I would like to draw attention to a couple of things.  First is a new
  project called Mod-Radio, a new service allowing folks to play online
  radio.  It can be found at http://www.back2roots.org/Music/Mod-Radio/.
  This is different from most Internet Radio because it does not use
  streaming audio formats, but uses native module formats.  The project
  offers access to more than 65,000 mods, organized into 54 radio channels!
  The supported players are WinAmp and DeliPlayer.  For Linux and BSD heads,
  I hacked up a small shell script that should work with Mozilla, Netscape,
  Lynx and any player:
  http://staticline.scenespot.org/suppliment/46/mod-radio.sh

  Second, in the USA, the Pilgrimage Demo Party is coming soon.  It is
  scheduled for August 9th, 8am until midnight in Salt Lake City, Utah.
  This party is free of charge, and is aimed at getting more people involved
  with the scene.  It includes hands-on seminars to educate talented coders
  in the arts of demo coding.  Read more at http://pilgrimage.scene.org

  That's it, enjoy this issue, and remember that articles for next month's
  issue can be sent in plain text to static_line-owner@scenespot.org.

  On The Rebound
    Interview with Nagz and Mephizto
  By:  Valzihjken
--=--=------=--=------=--=----

  During game 4 of the NBA finals, part of "Lenina58" was played during an
  interview with some guy called Kenyon Martin.  (I don't watch basketball;
  I just happened to notice the music coming from the TV.)  It was on the US
  station, ABC.  My brother and I were in the room and both recognized it at
  about the same time.  As of now, we can't find any other sceners who were
  even watching the game.  "Lenina58" was tracked by Nagz and Mephizto for
  Language Lab. I was honored to do the following interview, which took
  place through IRC and email exchanges.  It has been edited for content and
  to fit on your screen. "Lenina58", which is a "bigbeat/triphop XM" from
  2002, is Language Lab release #OOO51.

  NAGZ: OK. start start.

  VALZIHJKEN: Anyway, what do you two think of this event?

  NAGZ: This interview or the thing they've released our track there?

  VALZIHJKEN: The fact that they played "Lenina58" on ABC. Are you upset or
  happy? Do you want money? Do you like the accidental publicity? Do you
  want credit?

  MEPHIZTO: Well both :> mostly happy, but I'd REALLY like to know how did
  they get this track.  Well..

  NAGZ: Both.  They should've asked us.  Counting with the fact this song
  has been released at Languagelab (ll.planet-d.net), that might have
  happened that someone has "stolen" the track, wrote his name in and
  released at the channel somehow.  But that could also happen (that I
  doubt) they've asked Radio Cafe, a Hungarian radio station, and released.
  But this music was copyrighted.. we should've got paid somehow hehe :) and
  are you 100% darn sure?

  MEPHIZTO: This track is not an 'underground' track anymore, it'll be
  released in public this autumn at a record company here in Hungary.

  VALZIHJKEN: Cool.

  MEPHIZTO: So we could be upset as well.  But we don't give a darn, really
  :>

  VALZIHJKEN: I feel about 97% sure that it was "Lenina58".

  NAGZ: Valz you said your brother also recognized it as our song... Then it
  makes it more sure.  I think we might contact ABC television... at least
  for the recording.

  NAGZ: And who is that sick sonofa... who puts THIS music UNDER an
  interview?!?!?  :)))))))))))

  VALZIHJKEN: Heh heh.

  NAGZ: It's more like a lounge music. :)

  MEPHIZTO: Justice for us!!! :P

  VALZIHJKEN: I think it sounded very nice on the show.  Helped the mood.

  NAGZ: That can happen... but but the speech audibility and "Lenina58"
  doesn't meet :)

  VALZIHJKEN: True, Nagz.

  MEPHIZTO: Well hey. Llet's clear something out.

  NAGZ: Your room?

  MEPHIZTO: Was it played in the television, or at the arena during the
  interview?

  VALZIHJKEN: On ABC television.

  NAGZ: Right :) Meph, I think he could only recognize it if it was played
  on television at the arena, it just "washes out" vagy miafasz

  VALZIHJKEN: Could you introduce yourselves?

  NAGZ: ?lvem?ll? hangrovar :) I let the introducing to Meph. Eespecially
  because he started doing that music :)  I mean I let it for him at 1st ;)

  MEPHIZTO: :) K I started producing music back in the mid of the '90-s,
  using trackers and stuff, later I fell in love with Propellerhead's Reason
  and Cubase, and a lot of VSTI stuff as well.

  I really loved to produce music for the public, became a scener later, but
  then one day I got signed myself (and a few of my friends) at a record
  label in Hungary. since then I stopped (to be honest :( ) scene activity,
  and we're doing our own business as Fusion-X but I still care about the
  scene, just don't have the time to produce music for demoscene but I still
  like it.

  VALZIHJKEN: Does this make you enough money?  Do you have a second job?

  MEPHIZTO: Of course I do :) First, I don't do it for money only for
  reputation and respect, as all the sceners do. :) Its ok if I get money,
  but it's not the main goal.. ok I'm over, spit something out Nagz :>

  NAGZ: Poeeee!  I'm David Halmi. 20 years old, sound and info/electro
  technician, partyrat, casanova, dreadhead, Satan and Jesus in 1 (2?)
  person.  he he...  to turn it sincere: been making musics for 7-8 years,
  as I've been interested in music ever in my life.. been using (and still)
  FastTracker, but lately I'm shoring it up with other gears like Buzz, SF,
  sometimes Acid... and I'm eager in trying out DX and VST stuffs.  And I
  have a didgeridoo and a djembe else than other oriental and african percs
  and been playing jazz-piano but I've stopped.

  VALZIHJKEN: So, what are your current plans in the scene?

  NAGZ: Uhm.  I've kinda stopped scene (at least I've got fed up with
  Hungarian demoscene)

  MEPHIZTO: Me too me too :P

  NAGZ: Yeah yeah. we b 1337z0rz

  VALZIHJKEN: I only wish I could claim to be able to do that.

  NAGZ: I bet you have ears, eyes and hands.  I see nothing like a drat for
  doing that:)

  VALZIHJKEN: I'd be fed up with the US scene, if I could find it. ;)

  NAGZ: Hehhe :)  First you need to be a so-admired part of it no?

  VALZIHJKEN: What do you plan to do with your lives outside of the scene?

  MEPHIZTO: I think that would be a short answer from both of us.  We'd like
  to produce music till death. :)

  VALZIHJKEN: Yes, but do you think you actually will?

  NAGZ: Me not.  At age of 60 I'll become deaf and will paint. :)

  MEPHIZTO: Who knows... we'll try. :)

  NAGZ: I also want to make music but I know that it'll never be my 1st
  source for getting money.

  VALZIHJKEN: What sceners make your favorite scene music?

  MEPHIZTO: A Buzifinnek

  NAGZ: Heh ye.  Graff Vim Falcon Keith303 Scaldor Waka-X Manwe Xhale Ram0ne
  Solo Carlos Moby Traven Decibelter Hunz Matrixcubed Norfair DNA-Groove ..
  some of them.

  MEPHIZTO: Well I like the experimental side of the scene, like
  Brothomstates was.

  NAGZ: Yeah, haven't mentioned those IDM lamers :DDDD (MD is the best among
  them IHMO)

  VALZIHJKEN: What is your fave scene mag?

  MEPHIZTO: demoscene.hu of course =P

  NAGZ: Scene mag?  Is there any?

  VALZIHJKEN: Oh boy.

  NAGZ: My fave was Booster (ok just ... 1/4 scene:) and terror news!
  Haven't ever read one but Tomcat is really loving that and OK I do it
  also. ;)

  MEPHIZTO: Yeah Booster and TN kicked butt, and CLI sometimes. :>

  NAGZ: Bark bark.

  NAGZ: I used to get some publicity in Booster. :) Darn what a lamer I've
  been then... now I'm bigger. :P

  VALZIHJKEN: What is your favorite non-music pastime?

  NAGZ: Non-music pastime?  You mean activity when I stand up from this
  junk?

  VALZIHJKEN: Yes.

  MEPHIZTO: He does.

  NAGZ: Going anywhere.  It could be a long walk or a concert or a dancing
  hall (outdoor in this weather) or anything but rotting here.  I like
  partying as long as I have money.  Then I steal beers.  :))))))))))))))

  MEPHIZTO: Yes, drinking and hmm.. other things :), hanging out with
  friends.

  NAGZ: Do we have any?

  MEPHIZTO: And we like to listen to music as well. :))

  NAGZ: Last year I've bought a friend, but some months ago it broken the
  window and escaped. :(  I've just farted.

  MEPHIZTO: Let's get back to "Lenina58" then.

  NAGZ: Where did the name come from? :)

  VALZIHJKEN: Yes, where did the name come from?

  NAGZ: I know that XM numbering (that we've played DCC pingpong with)
  started at 51 and got up to 58. but "Lenina58"... it had an another name
  :) uhm.  Who found it out Meph?  Me or you?

  MEPHIZTO: I dunno.  Can't remember sorry. :>

  VALZIHJKEN: How long did it take you to make it?

  MEPHIZTO: Maybe 2-3 days? :)

  NAGZ: Grrrrrr. "Lenina 57" is on way tho.  My 1st screwaround in reason.
  :P

  VALZIHJKEN: Do you like co-ops better than solos?

  NAGZ: Definitely not. :)

  MEPHIZTO: No.  But Nagz had some kickin ideas he had to make (as he told
  me on IRC :)) so I passed it to him.

  NAGZ: I must say I want to beat out the crud from Mephizto for that we
  made that music together and not me alone.

  MEPHIZTO: And the rest is history! :P

  NAGZ: :>>>>>>>> I might get some criticism like I don't get this interview
  too seriously.

  VALZIHJKEN: What do you think of having a semi-local scene in Hungary?

  NAGZ: Semi-local?  you mean Jew-scene? :)

  VALZIHJKEN: Do you prefer THE SCENE or the Hungarian Scene?

  MEPHIZTO: :PPPP

  NAGZ: Oh.  I WOULD prefer Hungarian scene but ... as I said, I've got fed
  up.

  MEPHIZTO: Yes, it has seen better days.

  NAGZ: Much better.

  MEPHIZTO: Maybe it'll rise again.  Maybe not..

  NAGZ: In 97 there's been 12-13 Hungarian scene parties.

  MEPHIZTO: Right now we have 1 or 2.

  NAGZ: And the biggest one counted ~1000 attenders as I heard. yeah.. with
  150 people.

  MEPHIZTO: Way more.

  NAGZ: My first party was Ragest'98.

  MEPHIZTO: Ragest parties and stuff...

  VALZIHJKEN: Do you still go to scene parties?

  NAGZ: My last party was Flag2k2, held by us.  I mean Greenroom & others.
  Haven't been to Antiq2k2 and Towel2k3 and I won't visit Scenecon2k3 this
  weekend.

  MEPHIZTO: Once in a year maybe.  GOOBER GOOBER GOOBER

  VALZIHJKEN: Tell me about your groups.  What are they, which do you
  contribute most to, etc.

  NAGZ: My groups have been.. uh... Greenroom, Rebels, LanguageLab,
  j'?coute, 243, Section, Tequila, Analogik, Mellow Leader Blues, Parallel
  Everything, Dr. Universe Game Source, Arrahmeie .... many of them have
  always been inactive.. I've worked a lot for Greenroom (mainly WildDemos
  and party org (FLaG)) and for LanguageLab (ll.planet-d.net)

  MEPHIZTO: My group is Digital Dynamite, founded back in the '90-s, but we
  were most active between the year '00-'02, now we stopped the activity a
  bit. we've won several Hungarian parties, mostly with intros.

  VALZIHJKEN: What do you do before you track?  Do you do anything to
  prepare?

  NAGZ: Yes.  Waking up and having a bottle of still mineral water in my
  arm-distance. :)

  MEPHIZTO: Nothing at all.

  VALZIHJKEN: What inspires you?

  NAGZ: Everything.  Life.  Myself.

  MEPHIZTO: Could be anything... nature, catching a nice smile of a nice
  girl :), the city, sometimes big parties (I don't mean demoscene parties).

  VALZIHJKEN: Of all of your tracks, which is your favorite or best?

  MEPHIZTO: "Lenina58" of course ;)) Well to be honest, my favourite is
  "Sleeping Beauty", I composed it to a girl I loved most in my life, but
  now everything's gone.  Only the song remained.

  NAGZ: I think my chiptune called "xyzawoo" was a bead of me, it was just
  like sitting down like a freak and writing out something from my feelings.
  When I stood up 2 hours later I just realized that I've made something
  I've never done before.  Progressive chiptune made in a trance somehow. :)

  VALZIHJKEN: Meph, where can we get your music?

  MEPHIZTO: I don't have anything on the net, because of the record label,
  so mostly in cd-shops or whatever.

  VALZIHJKEN: Ok, I guess we're done.  Thanks!

  If you want to contact either of these two, try #demoscene on ircnet.
  Maybe you'll get lucky.
  Find a few of Nagz's releases at:
    http://ll.planet-d.net
    http://jecoute.cjb.net

  Wish I could tell you where something (other than "Lenina58") by Mephizto
  could be found.  :( Wish you could tell me that actually...

  Hooz Deez?
    An Interview with Ciaran and Ben
  By:  Dilvie
--=--=------=--=------=--=----

  Last issue, the readers of Static Line were hit with a major adjustment to
  the staff - namely the fact that there are now two new editors of the
  magazine: Ben Collver and Ciaran Hamilton.  Who are they?  Well, my goal
  was to find out and share my findings with you, the readers.

  DILVIE: Let's start with names; along with aliases, aka's, stupid nick-
  names, and other such nonsense.  What are they?

  BEN: My name is Ben Collver, I go by SunDragon most of the time in IRC but
  I prefer to use my own name when I'm not just shooting the breeze.

  CIARAN: My name is Ciaran Hamilton. I don't really use any special name
  online.  I used to be called Kiwihead, though.  The "Kiwi" part comes
  because my name is pronounced "Keer-an", and at school, people often
  shortened it to "Kiwi".  I liked it, and thought I'd put "head" after it,
  'cuz I was feeling random.  And that's how that name came about. Nothing
  to do with New Zealand, despite what some people think. :)

  DILVIE: Where do you hail from?

  BEN: Corvallis, Oregon, USA.  We're right in the center of the Willamette
  Valley, close to the coast, close to the Cascade Mountain Range, close to
  the three largest cities (Portland, Salem, Eugene).

  CIARAN: West Sussex, England, United Kingdom.

  DILVIE: How did you get involved in the demoscene?

  BEN: One day my brother said "hey listen to this" and emailed me a MOD.  I
  had to use a search engine to find something that would play it.  I was
  impressed, and immediately took interest in trackers, and by proxy, the
  demo scene.

  DILVIE: Do you remember what year that was?

  BEN: That was 1995.  I was using Windows 3.11, mod4win, and trumpet
  winsock.  My first tracker was screamtracker 3.  I think my brother used
  some MS-DOS clone of protracker.

  CIARAN: I first got involved with the scene when I saw that on the CD of
  one my favourite magazines at the time, there was a large collection of
  MOD files on it, along with MultiTracker.  This would be a number of years
  ago...  probably about 10 years ago, maybe less.

  MultiTracker became my favourite toy. :) I loved playing with it and
  seeing what stuff I could do.  In fact, I still have a copy of the first
  'real' tune I made with MT.  It sounds awful, but I still have a sort of
  fondness for it. :)

  Hmm. No, wait, I think my first encounter with the demoscene stretched
  back further than that now that I think about it.  I think my first
  encounter with the demoscene was probably back when I used to have an
  Acorn Archimedes computer. On one of the cover discs for a magazine called
  BBC Acorn User (now just called Acorn User), they had a program called
  !HQ-Tracker.  It used a similar sort of method of tracking to MODs, but it
  was slightly different, although I can't remember how.  But I only got
  really involved with MultiTracker.

  DILVIE: So you both came into the scene from a musical perspective.  Have
  either of you done anything else with it?

  CIARAN: Anything else with the scene? Not really. Although I'm interested
  in programming, I've never really wanted to do the graphics or coding side
  of a demo.  I do want to do the music for a demo or two, but I don't
  really know where I would start. I'm not in a group, although I'd like to
  be.

  BEN: I remember a friend put 2nd reality on PCs at Radio Shack.  I wrote a
  PC clone of bomberman, 4 player.  It used Allegro for the graphic library,
  MikMod for the music library, and built under DJGPP to run in MS-DOS.
  That's not exactly a demo, but it touches on the coding aspect.  (don't
  tell anyone, but the graphics were ripped from a SuperNES ROM) ;) [Okay,
  Ben, I won't tell... Neither will the readers... ;) ]

  DILVIE: How did you get involved with Static Line?

  BEN: I used to read Trax Weekly, and while searching for module reviews, I
  found Coplan's In Tune in the Static Line.  I think I subscribed late
  2002, and I really appreciated the quality of the zine.  I also looked
  forward to The Lineup.

  CIARAN: Fast forward to last year. I had just received my copy of the
  MindCandy DVD.  I noticed that in the credits, they mentioned Static Line.
  I was curious as to what it was, so I searched for it and found that it
  was this cool magazine about the scene, which I thought had pretty cool
  articles in it.  So I subscribed. :)

  BEN: Then Coplan asked for volunteers to take over as editor.

  CIARAN: Right. Somewhere after issue #44 had gone out, we heard on the
  list that Coplan had got engaged, and thus he didn't have enough time to
  continue editing the zine.  I emailed him, and in the email I mentioned
  that I thought it would be best to have two editors, as I hadn't really
  done anything like this before.

  BEN: Was that before he mentioned that I had also emailed him?

  CIARAN: Yes.  Coplan then emailed us to say what exactly was involved.

  DILVIE: Static Line has been around since Trax Weekly dissolved about five
  years ago.  Had either of you read Trax Weekly?

  CIARAN: I've never read Trax Weekly, no.

  BEN: I used to read Trax Weekly, I think I stopped at a busy time in my
  life when I moved and changed ISP's

  DILVIE: How are you enjoying your new responsibilities?  The two of you
  have already been tested on issue #45, correct?

  BEN: It is really helpful to have 2 of us on the team.

  CIARAN: Yes, it is. I'm certainly enjoying it.

  BEN: We did work on issue 45.  Coplan handed us the articles and said
  "Here you go, I'll help as much or as little as you want."

  CIARAN: We already had the material for issue #45 from articles that
  Coplan already had, although Ben also did his music review and I did the
  Message from the Editor.

  BEN: It was fun to jump into it.

  CIARAN: Definitely. :) I enjoy doing things like this.

  DILVIE: Do either of you have plans for the future of Static Line?  What
  will change?  What will stay the same?

  BEN: I would like to contribute more content to the Line as I educate
  myself musically.  I really enjoyed Setec's articles on synthesis, and
  would like to continue along that line.

  CIARAN: Right now, I think we think most everything will stay the same,
  although we have built a (currently quite bare) website for it -
  http://staticline.scenespot.org

  BEN: We did make one change when we did issue 45 that wouldn't be visible
  to anyone.  It seems Ciaran and I come from a coder/Unix background and
  think along similar lines.

  CIARAN: Yes. We switched the way we edited the magazine from being edited
  manually to making some short scripts to help us a bit.

  BEN: We started typesetting the zine with groff instead of the MS-DOS
  editor Coplan was using (Aurora).

  CIARAN: It allows us to do pretty neat things. Although internally we make
  issues in the format groff wants, we tried to keep the final text layout
  as close to the original as possible.

  We're hoping to make some improvements to the editing process to make it
  easier. groff is sorta hard to write in, so I'm working on developing a
  typesetting language for SL that we can translate directly to groff.

  BEN: I don't think we've had time yet to think of any major improvements
  or future strategy for the magazine.

  DILVIE: Are both of you planning to be at Pilgrimage, or other demo
  parties in the near future?

  BEN: I am looking forward to meeting Coplan at Pilgrimage, I hope we
  manage to.

  CIARAN: I hope I can make it to a party somewhere, hopefully close to
  home; I've never been to a demoparty. :( I definitely want to go to a
  party though, especially after the article in Hugi #27 by Sir
  Garbagetruck.

  DILVIE: Time for the obligitory favorites:  What is your favorite demo?

  BEN: This is my favorite demo:

  float o=0.075,h=1.5,T,r,O,l,I;int _,L=80,s=3200;main(){for(;s%L||
  (h-=o,T= -2),s;4 -(r=O*O)<(l=I*I)|++ _==L&&write(1,(--s%L?_<L?--_
  %6:6:7)+"World! \n",1)&&(O=I=l=_=r=0,T+=o /2))O=I*2*O+h,I=l+T-r;}

  It produces a Mandlebrot in ASCII.

  CIARAN: I think my favourite demo is probably ".fr-08 - .the .product".
  It's a cool little 64KB demo that blew my socks off when I saw it the
  first time, myself.  (you'll be able to read about an experience with
  fr-08 in the issue this interview appears in, btw :D)

  DILVIE: Favorite MOD?

  CIARAN: That's a hard one - I've got a lot of music that I like. :D If I
  was forced to pick one, it would probably be "Feats Of Valor" by Elwood.

  BEN: I don't have a single favorite MOD, but over the years I have not
  gotten tired of Mellow-D's music.  I also enjoy Xerxes and Kaneel, who
  compose in similar styles to Mellow-D.

  DILVIE: Good enough.  It's been a pleasure.

  I'd like to personally express my thanks to the new editors for giving
  Static Line a chance to continue and (hopefully) thrive as Coplan moves on
  to other projects.  It would be sad to see a five-year contribution to the
  scene fade into memory as so many other resources have.

  CIARAN: My thoughts exactly. That's why I wanted to become an editor in
  the first place.  It's even better with two of us as it means that if one
  of us is away temporarily or something, the issues will still go out on
  time. :) Plus Ben's really helped when he made the magazine into the
  format groff wants. It makes some things so much easier.

  BEN: And Coplan is still helping us out, with advice and by contributing
  content.  I think it ought to be fun.  And you're welcome :)

  DILVIE: It sounds like Static Line is in good hands.

  In Tune
    In Tense's "Heaven's Descent"
  By:  Coplan
--=--=------=--=------=--=----

  -=- "Heaven's Descent" by In Tense -=-
  At first listen, I'll admit, I hated the song.  It reminded me too much of
  a song I reviewed before.  "Fine", also by In Tense, has a very similar
  style, similar chord progression, and a similar beginning.  The way things
  build and fade in and out are also similar.  But then I started listening
  it a little more.  Yes, it all seems very similar, but one of his latest,
  "Heaven's Descent", is more unique than I had thought.

  Just like any typical trance song, things start very vauge.  You have a
  climbing and descending synthetic chords that repeat.  As the progression
  changes, the placement of these changes.  And this tends to be the glue
  for the entire song.  A base line comes in at about thirty seconds into
  the song.  At first the instrument selection for the base line is
  terrible.  But it slowly changes and melts into a very soft sounding base
  line by the time the percussion starts to come in.  The overall feeling of
  the song comes to life at about the 1 minute mark.  It picks up most at
  about 1:30.

  Sadly, I know little about the production of the tune.  Its sample and
  instrument selection seems to rely very heavily on envelopes, almost as if
  it were done on synthesizers.  It is the type of tune that would very
  naturally fall out of Renoise, Psycle or Buzz.  The skill involved to get
  these soft-synthesis sequencers to produce these kinds of instruments is
  definately recognized by yours truly.  As I said, this tune reminded me
  quite a bit of "Fine".  But after you become familiar with both tunes,
  you'll see that In Tense has come a long way.

  The percussion is a bit typical of a trance or a techno song.  Yes, it's
  well placed, and very useable.  It's not my favorite aspect of the song.
  Whether or not this is the case, it seems to utilize a lot of break-beats.
  I will, however, offer my recognition of the parts where only a hi-hat was
  used, or where everything was cut out.  I realize that's a wierd way of
  saying things.  But the reality is that I wouldn't review this song if it
  didn't have at least that.

  The thing I like about the song is the fact that things are always
  changing.  Too often, especially with trance styles, things tend to get
  left and forgotten.  The break-beat, once it comes in, never changes.  The
  background riffs tend to come in at a very repetative nature.  The chord
  progression never changes.  In Tense doesn't do that, especially with this
  song.  There are parts where the chord progression holds the same notes
  for the next several bars.  There are other times where it changes after
  only one or two bars.  But more important is the fact that it is rarely
  left to fend for itself.  Occasionally, you'll hear a piano playing in the
  distant background.  You might hear some other synthesized sounds popping
  in and out.  Maybe the chord progression gets carried through some other
  instrument.  The percussion helps to shape things here.  But things are
  always moving around the very static drum beat (a requirement of any
  electronic style).  All in all, this is a good rendition of a very classic
  trancey style.  A winner, in my book, and definately one that will remain
  on my play list for a while.

  On The Sideline
    "Cillke" by Emit
  By:  Ben
--=--=------=--=------=--=----

  As you are well aware, one of the great things about electronic music is
  the absolute freedom of expression.  With trackers or any other instrument
  you learn the mechanics of music by practice.  I'd say trackers have a
  much easier learning curve than most instruments, and have a rapid
  interface that is well suited to whipping up fun, interesting sounds.  In
  my opinion it is more important that music be fun and interesting, than
  for it to be done elegantly with technical finesse.

  What makes a track fun or interesting?  Fun is largely subjective, but
  interesting is easier: something different.  Not only different from the
  "generic" stuff, but different from itself.  Although house or trance
  music can be pleasant to listen to, most of it is too repetitive for me to
  consider it interesting.  The house or trance music I do find interesting
  typically makes use of unusual synthesized sound.

  This is where Kevin Krebs comes in.  I first found his music released
  under the alias Emit.  He uses radio noise, astronomical noise, and
  software synthesizers to make what he describes as distant, cold, and
  droning ambient music.  I have also heard use of samples from various
  children's TV shows.

  I am going to review "Cillke", one of the older Emit tunes that is less
  cold than most of his work.  The name itself interested me, seeming
  similar to some Scottish sea myth, so I asked Kevin where it came from.
  He told me it was just a non-sense word he made up.  Oh well.  This song
  didn't play so well in some of my players, so I suggest listening in
  modplug or IT.  This is a relatively short song, about 3 minutes.

  The song begins with a drone, which progresses into a gentle rumble of
  subsynth bass.  Then a slow drum sequence kicks in, and the song has
  arrived.  For some reason it reminds me of a warm day on a grassy
  riverbank, with distant airplanes and lawn mowers humming in the
  background.

  Then about order 17 there blurts long, forcefull bass notes to emphasize
  the rhythm, and a bit of simple melody ties it over until order 35 where a
  beautiful synth lead chirps in.  The synth melody is somewhat wistful,
  conjuring images of lost childhood.  I have no idea where the vocals come
  from, but they lend a surreal effect to the tune.  I like how the voice is
  echoed when the man asks "Who do you resemble most?" to produce a doubling
  effect (doububleblibling ebeffebect).  And the song ends with a child
  answering.

  This song sounds pretty good for being all 8-bit samples.  The style is
  clear and uncrowded, bordering on minimal.  I recommend the other tunes,
  which can be found at http://www.833-45.net.  "Cillke" is under the
  section titled "Emit".  I also found an interesting paper about module
  music by Emit, which may be read at

  The Lineup
  By:  Novus
--=--=------=--=------=--=----

  Welcome to The Lineup! Every month, I scour through the hundreds of new
  releases on the scene's major archive sites to find the best new music,
  saving you the trouble of having to download 20 instant-delete songs to
  find 1 that's worth keeping.

  With the recent hiatus of Static Line, The Lineup has also fallen a bit
  behind, so here's the comeback plan: for July's issue, the issue you're
  reading right now, you'll get the best tracks of April and May. And for
  August's issue, you'll get the best tracks of June and July, thus bringing
  this thing back on track. (Overused pun intended.)

  Feedback keeps comin' on in. TS wrote thusly:

  "Just want to say that I like your music list. Since the connection
  between music and demo scene has weakened and there are practically no
  scene music archives brought to parties, it is quite hard to get new
  modules these day with a smallband connection. Thus, your list serves well
  for not totally loosing track about todays scene music releases - thanks!
  Not all tracks were liked by me, but this was a matter of taste rather
  than quality, so you can still be proud of 100% customer satisfaction ;)"

  Thanks TS, though maybe that's down to 99% after Daniel Okely wrote
  thusly:

  "I finally received static-line for the first time... having scoured the
  back issues and downloaded songs from the lineup, I was looking forward to
  this issue. I think that your song selections are great. Personally, I
  think you could be marginally more strict, but then again music is such a
  personal thing. :)"

  Well, I'll take 99% satisfaction. ;) Thanks for writing in! And you can
  add YOUR feedback, positive or negative by e-mailing me at
  vince_young@hotmail.com.

  In the meantime, you may consider the following 33 tunes to be the best

  Screen Lit Vertigo
    "Nighttime" and "Glitch"
  By:  Seven
--=--=------=--=------=--=----

  -=- "Nighttime" by Scarab Corpse -=-

  (party-version)

  Found at www.scene.org
  1st place at the Birdie 13 demo compo
  System requirements: No req. listed :( 6MB HD, Windows.
  Test Machine: PIII 900 640MB, Gamesurround III, Radeon 8500 LE 64MB,
    Win98 SE
  The credits:
    Code: Cloaked Alien
    Graphics: Krayz
    3D: Cyc
    Music: Gs

  The demo:
  It's clear from the start that "Nighttime" is a theme demo: the title
  sequence shows desolate hills lit by a pale moon, with slow nocturnal
  music setting the mood. But while most groups use 3D to tell their stories
  these days, Scarab Corpse uses 2D images. Most backgrounds are close-up
  details of a much larger image that isn't revealed until the end. Besides
  the dark theme of this final image, a second thread involving purple teddy
  bears is added to light up the mood. Because a demo showing only scrolling
  backgrounds would bore you out of your sanity, some 3D effects were added,
  such as butterflies, several particle effects, and a weird morphing blob
  that's partly a mirror, partly flatshaded polygons. The 3D teddy doesn't
  look very good IMHO, and isn't nearly as cute as the simple 3-winged
  floating blobs.

  "Nighttime" allows only 2 resolutions: 512*384 or 640*480, an in the
  latter case the demo is shown with black borders around it. At first I
  thought the demo was software rendered, but this isn't mentioned anywhere
  in the info file, so maybe it's to avoid scaling artifacts in the images,
  which are very important for the mood of the demo.

  The music starts almost gothic, with slow wailing voices accompagnied by
  an organ, I think. Later a relaxed beat is aded but it's still very
  ambient.  Since all effects are quite slow, there's little opportunity for
  synchronizing, but the mood and speed of the soundtrack fit the visuals
  very well.

  Overall:
  It's nice to see a demo that places most emphasis on 2D images, a
  neglected art in todays 3D-dominated scene. For the rest the demo isn't
  groundbreaking, the color scheme is a bit weird sometimes but overall it's
  nice to watch and listen to. Give it a try!


  -=- "Glitch" by Kewlers -=-

  (party-version)

  Found at www.scene.org
  1st place at the Stream 2003 democompo
  System requirements: 3.4 MB HD, 35 MB memory, Pentium 3 recommended,
    GeForce2 (3 recommended) with recent drivers, windows
  Test Machine: PIII 900 640MB, Gamesurround III, Radeon 8500 LE 64MB,
    Win98 SE
  The credits:
    Code: Curly Brace
    Graphics: Actor Dolban
    Music: Little Bitchard, 110
    Design: Mel Function, Curly Brace

  The demo:
  "Glitch" reminds me a lot of A Deepness In The Sky/MFX, since both demos
  are essentially a single effect that grows slowly more complex. "Glitch"
  starts with circular metal patterns, arranged in spherical layers. With
  blue flashes, more parts appear on the outer side, and red lightning
  circles around the sphere. After a while the core of the sphere starts to
  morph, with more lightning appearing inside the sphere, and a room made of
  thin black lines in a matrix form appears around it. The whole process is
  randomized, so it's never the same way twice, but those are the main
  lines. Of course the camera jumps around constantly, and there are flashes
  abound.

  Besides a black and white Kewlers logo on broken polygons at the start,
  and a similar "Glitch" title at the end, there are no pictures at all.
  The music sounds experimental and very atonal, with little electronic
  noises, slow sweeps and a irregular heavy bass. I don't like it very much,
  I need at least a trace of a melody to enjoy music.

  Overall:
  "Glitch" left me a bit disappointed, I was expecting more from Kewlers.
  One factor is the hardware, I think the GeForce 2 minimum requirement is
  very optimistic. An ATI 8500 is between a GF3 and a GF4 in power, but I
  had to choose the lowest resolution (640*480) to get an acceptable
  framerate, and even then it was still jerking at times. Maybe it just
  doesn't like ATIs?  A good point is the randomness, I'm really a fan of
  ever-changing scripts and this type of demo is perfectly suited to it. So
  fans of Kewlers, rejoice, for you'll be able to watch this demo again and
  again. For the others, check it out if you don't mind atonal music.

  Editorial
    There's Always a First Time
  By:  Ciaran
--=--=------=--=------=--=----

  Last month, when I was editing issue #45, I had a great experience.  I
  introduced an online friend of mine to the demoscene for the first time.

  Ironically enough, it was when I was telling her over IM that I was now a
  co-editor of this magazine. She was interested in what the demoscene was,
  so I pointed her towards http://www.oldskool.org/demos/explained/ (one of
  the particularly helpful sites in the Link List). I then started thinking
  about which demo would be the best to show her first.

  I wanted to show her what the demoscene was about in a nutshell. I also
  wanted to impress her with what demos could actually do, but although
  demos like Second Reality (for example) were brilliant at the time, I
  figured they'd be less likely to impress newcomers today - plus, of
  course, it's hard to get some of these demos running.

  In the end, I chose a 64KB demo - ".fr-08: .the .product" (
  http://theproduct.de/ ) - as the first demo I would show her. She's
  computer-literate, so she knew how small 64KB was, and she probably
  thought it was a rather odd choice on my part. If I wanted to show her
  what the demoscene was about, why not start with one of the larger
  demos?...

  I don't know what she was thinking as she watched the demo on her
  computer, but I found myself fondly remembering what I felt like the first
  time I saw it. After all, conventional wisdom says that 64KB is far too
  small to put anything worth watching into, right? But, of course, that
  notion is quickly laid to rest when you watch it.  Lasting almost a full
  11 minutes, it would probably make you rethink your opinion on the
  demoscene quite radically if it was your first time.

  As she watched on her computer, I put on the MP3 of the music that the
  demo uses so I could tell where she was in the demo. I smiled when the
  music passed the stage where the screen would have displayed "You may
  press escape now", but after a while, carried on - that was perhaps the
  most jawdropping point for me when I first watched it - "This thing has
  *more*?".

  Finally, as the music reached it's end, I readied myself for the IM
  message. I wasn't disappointed.

  "Oh. My. God."

  She couldn't get over it for a while. She loved it. She felt, in her own
  words, "like a kid who's found a new toy. I think I've discovered another
  obsession." And of course, she's now a subscriber to Static Line.  :)

  Now it's your turn, as the readers - I'm interested in knowing what your
  experiences were. What was it like for you the first time you were
  introduced to the demoscene? Is there one particular demo which you would
  recommend for a newcomer to the scene? And - probably the most important
  question - what message would you want to give about the demoscene? Email
  us at static_line-owner@scenespot.org and we'll publish as many emails as
  we can in next month's issue.

  Coplan's Eyes
    Culture
  By:  Coplan
--=--=------=--=------=--=----

  Culture is something that strikes us every day.  In some countries, it's
  more common of a stumbling block than it is in other countries.  The
  United States, or any new world country, for example, has been plagued
  with cultural differences from day one.  That's not to say that I agree or
  disagree with whether or not these cultural differences should be
  emphasized or ignored.  It's not an issue to me.  Racism is a poor result
  in such differences.  It's just important to acknowledge such differences,
  and then accept them.  Note I said ACCEPT, not IGNORE.

  Alright, so what's this got to do with the scene?  Fortunately for us, the
  demoscene is deeply rooted in the internet.  Until you meet that person
  face-to-face, they're just a cool guy.  Or girl.  Maybe black, maybe
  white, maybe latino.  Maybe they are 15.  Maybe they're 32.  They could be
  heterosexual, homosexual.  They could have 500 piercings and 28 tatoos.
  But you don't know any of that.  The internet, for the most part is
  annonymous.  At least until people start asking questions.  But I bring up
  the issue because many of you end up at demo parties or other scene
  gatherings from time to time.  Jimmy Scener was, in your mind, a nice
  young individual.  He's got good taste in music.  He's a very talented
  music writer and he does a bit of code on the side.  He's learning very
  quickly, and you really believe he'll be the next big name in the ways of
  the demoscene.  Then you meet "him" at The Gathering, and HER name is
  "Jamie" (which could be a guy's name, you admit), she has long black hair,
  and she's Indian.  But...in the big scheme of things, she's still got good
  taste in music, is a talented music writer and she is learning to code
  very well.  What's changed other than your perception of this person?
  Very little.  The mistake, after all, was your initial perception.  But is
  that such a mistake?  No.  Humans, by their very nature, have this natural
  tendency to want to associate faces with names.  If you are without a
  face, you create one in your head.  Go figure, it tends to be of someone
  you ideally think fits the name.  There is no true basis for the image you
  develop in your mind.  Now it would be a mistake, however, if you let any
  of her natural appearance get in the way of making a new friend.

  Fortunately, this doesn't always cause problems in the demoscene.  I seem
  to remember that almost any female artist gets rated higher than the male
  artists as it is.  So maybe the reverse is happening.  But prejudice does
  happen in the demoscene, and it shouldn't.

  So what can you really learn from all this?  Well, start by asking that
  person some questions.  You might find that person is very talented voxel
  coder, and you want to learn some tricks.  Or, maybe that person is very
  good with latin rhythms (maybe some irish guy is very good at them, who
  says that person is latin?).  People affect other people all the time.
  But it's up to you if you want the result to be a good one or a bad one.
  Supposing you shut said person out because you were prejudice, then you
  would be the one missing out.

  Don't make judgement without the evidence.  It's bad for your future.
