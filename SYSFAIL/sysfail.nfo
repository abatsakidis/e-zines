   "Not another h/p zine that'll last like, 2 days!@#" "Not another shitty
 zine written by a bunch of clueless 10-year-olds with nothing better to do!"

   System Failure is a publication geared towards the underground computer
 culture; mainly dealing with h/p issues. Each issue is designed to have both
 beginning and advanced material. Methods change all the time, and it's a
 race between them and us to find the holes in the system, to openly show the
 System Failure.

   Material in our zine is for educational purposes only, and if you try to
 do anything listed within it, that's your own responsibility. The ideas
