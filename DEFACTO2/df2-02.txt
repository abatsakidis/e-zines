  Welcome to the new Defacto.
  ---------------------------

  If you have access to a graphical capable web browser I suggest that you
  stop reading this text edition of DF2 right now and go to www.defacto2.com
  and read the online version. It has color, graphics, disco music and is
  a lot easier to read then ASCII text.

  Defacto2 in the future will be available to read using three different
  mediums.
  - There will be a coded PC version supporting SVGA graphics, digital
    music and all that other jazz. 
  - A plain ASCII / text version for all you UNIX users or people who feel
    the coded edition is too big to download.
  - And finally each issue will be viewable on our web page at
    www.defacto2.com.
  Unfortunately for this issue their is no coded version available due to
  unforeseen difficulties, again.

  Every month we will hope to release a issue, exactly when during the month
  we will release will not be decided until we have enough quality content
  to warrant a release. Each issue will be released on the day of release on
  most major ftp sites and on our web page. We don't have and are not planing
  on having an IRC channel, IRC offer bots or anonymous ftp sites.

  If you wish to contact Defacto2 please email us at defacto@defacto2.com

Interview with Bush
Conducted by Saint Tok
SWMP hacked


DEFACTO2: Welcome Bush, introduce yourself to our readers please.
 
BUSH:     I am Bush, Motiv8 council and Reflux/Onyx member.
 
DEFACTO2: A while ago there's was stuff up on a popular site. I've heard
          that you where apart of the problem. Can you go into more details
          about this incident?
 
BUSH:     Someone has my password on SWM, I do not know how they got it. I
          dont know why it was done, it was pretty cruel. Anyway one person I
          believe was bob226 (not sure though) had my password on SWM and
          gave it out on #survival (rapier channel), although I have heard
          two other stories. Someone from Devotion was scrolling it in
          #survival and I heard someone from MNM was scrolling it in #survival
          too. The original event happened about 3 weeks ago when I noticed my
          unfo was changed to motiv8 sucks. I got kind of mad, and I thought
          it was the siteop. That week I finished #1 on SWM. Then it kept on
          continuing for about three weeks or so, I got mad and contacted the
          SWM siteop and I asked him "My unfo was changed and I didn't change
          it, any idea how it was done?". This was what he replied with

          <SwedeMike> it was changed 17:58 today (Bush]]) well who did it?
          <SwedeMike> I am going to check it out

          He told me 4 people logged in UNDER the bush account

          ******.********   = bob226, main suspect.
          *******.********  = Real, Rapier member former AMN member.
          *****.***.***.*** = MNM Shell account.

          And one of those leftover ip's is kali from Rapier.
          Swedemike got pissed and he asked me if I use that pw alot I told
          him I used it on only 2 SITES, his and my whq (which is secure).
          He asked me if I recognize those ISP I said "No". I decided to go
          around and do a /whois on people and I found them all in #survival
          channel with ops they were identified as kali, real, zerot from
          Rapier and bob226, Rapier friend. First thing Swedemike did was
          contact Rapier and he was ALL OVER THEM. Then he investigated, it
          got worse *****.***.***.edu, one ip that logged into my account was
          a shell machine in a collage.
          Thousands of people probably logged in, and one MNM member logged in
          and stole all my credits and gave it to a user jess. Real was kicked
          out of Rapier as a result, and investigations are going on for one
          more week.

DEFACTO2: Did you get your credits back, the ones which where given to Jess?
 
BUSH:     No, Swedemike wouldn't give them to me, and Rapier didn't fix what
          was stolen.
 
DEFACTO2: Isn't that a bit unfair, why didn't the siteop give you the credits
          that where stolen from you?
 
BUSH:     He said its a policy to not fix hacked accounts.
 
DEFACTO2: I thought hacked accounts always got deleted?
 
BUSH:     No, but my password was changed.
 
DEFACTO2: Well, since you was fucked on this site, will you be supporting
          SWM in the future?
 
BUSH:     Yes :)
 
DEFACTO2: Thanks for the interview, any last words, or probably greets to
          anyone?
 
BUSH:     Greets to Motiv8, Swedemike, Reflux, and Onyx.
          And I'd like to say Rapier didn't handle the situation well either.

 Ý      Yiiiihaaaa!!! Happy new year to all the fellow pirates and         Ý
 Ý      also to the fans of Rebels and CB4!! We're starting out            Ý
 Ý      this new year with some great news for ya'll!                      Ý
 Ý                                                                         Ý
 Ý      First some background information...                               Ý

 Ý      One year ago, three Rebels members left Rebels to start            Ý
 Ý      up a new cracking/release group called CELLBLOCK 4.                Ý
 Ý      After a short time CB4 merged with a small group from              Ý
 Ý      which Charley, def_fred and a few other members came from...       Ý
 Ý                                                                         Ý
 Ý      At the same time, REBELS merged with a                             Ý
 Ý      group called Pantera in which Doson, Skater and many other         Ý
 Ý      members originated...                                              Ý

 Ý      One year has passed, and as you all know, one year in the          Ý
 Ý      scene is like 10 years in real life, so A LOT has happened         Ý
 Ý      during this past year.. Both groups have had a                     Ý
 Ý      great year through hard work and fantastic releases. One           Ý
 Ý      year later, both CB4 and Rebels are well known, respected          Ý
 Ý      groups with great leadership, organization, and                    Ý
 Ý      releasing power.. so.. why not make it simple?!? ;)                Ý

DEFACTO2: Welcome Charley can you please tell the readers a little bit
          about yourself, don't forget to mention passed and current
          affiliations.

CHARLEY:  Hi all readers of Defacto2! I'm Charley now one of the leaders 
          of Rebels... I started out in a really small group called 'oG' 
          as a supplier.. that group merged in to CB4 where I later became 
          the president.. 
          I have always been in to this computer stuff. I got my first 
          computer when I was 8 and I started up my first BBS when I was 14.
          hew.. that's like a long time ago now.. ;)
          It's only been something like one and a half years since my
          ex-boyfriend first showed me the IRC..  so I guess I'm still
          kind of a newbe ;P

DEFACTO2: Lets start off by talking about Cell Block 4. I heard CB4
          originally was formed because of a split with Rebels. Are 
          there any truths into this statement and can you go into 
          further details about CB4's founding?
 
CHARLEY:  Well.. I wouldn't call it a split.. one of the leaders of 'the old 
          Rebels' (Letherman) founded Cell Block 4 as a cracking group
          while he still was a part of Rebels (this was like November 1995). 
          later on (early 1996).. Letherman left Rebels to work with
          his new group full time.. and two more members left Rebels 
          with him.. About February 1996 the group that I came from 
          originally merged in to CB4.. And by that merge CB4 became
          the group that later on was well known and respected out there.. ;)
 
DEFACTO2: Who came up with the name of Cell Block 4 and the jail
          theme(1)? Was the name Cell Block 4 taken from the movie 
          with the same name(2)?
 
CHARLEY:  The founder named the group before any of the rest of us joined... 
          and yes.. the name is from that movie.. I have never seen that 
          movie myself (I heard that it stinks though;>).. I'm the woman 
          behind the jail theme ;) I wanted to add some feeling in to the 
          NFO.. and I wanted it to be special...
  
DEFACTO2: During CB4's time who where it's main competitors? Where they
          cracking groups such as Prozen Crew or utility groups?
 
CHARLEY:  ahh.. that's a hard question.. we never really competed with 
          anyone but ourselves.. I would say that we were a mix between
          a cracking group such as PC and a util group such as DOD.. but 
          CB4 was a very special group.. and anyone who have visit our 
          channel knows what I'm talking about.. our main goal was to 
          make CB4 a well known and respected group without turning in 
          to 'leet egos.. and we reached that goal...
  
DEFACTO2: Why did CB4 decide it was better for themselves to merge into
          another group rather then continuing on?
 
CHARLEY:  Hummm.. that's a long story.. but as I said.. we had reached 
          our goals.. and we needed new challenges.. CB4 was a small 
          group in size.. we only had something like 20 members.. and 
          that means that all members had to work hard.. and.. I guess.. 
          in the end.. CB4 was too big to handle by just a few ppl.. and 
          two small to have a huge organization.. it became really hard 
          for me and def_fred (ex CB4 council) to handle the daily business
          and the rest of the council wasn't motivated at that time I guess.. 
          so.. in order for us to get new motivation and new goals we needed 
          to do something.. and the merge with rebels both gave us all a new
          kick and it also gave me and def_fred a chance to relax..

DEFACTO2: Why was Rebels the best choice for CB4 to merge into?
 
CHARLEY:  Well.. Rebels and CB4 has always been two very close groups.. 
          actually.. in the early days of CB4 when I didn't know much about 
          the life outside our happy little family.. Doson (one 
          of the leaders of Rebels) told me a lot about the scene and he 
          always helped me out.. we talked a lot about everything from 
          releases, courier groups, dupechecks, the scene in general AND we 
          even at that time talked about merging our groups.. and as the 
          time went by we have continued talking about merging every now 
          and then.. but the time was never right.. ;)
 
DEFACTO2: Did everyone survive the merge into Rebels? What happened to CB4's
          couriers seeing Devotion are Rebels official couriers?
 
CHARLEY:  We 'only' lost one member in that merge.. but.. as I explained 
          earlier.. CB4 was going through a lot of changes at this time.. 
          so two or three other members left the group before we merged 
          in to Rebels... but that had nothing to do with the merge itself..
           
          We didn't have any couriers in CB4 that only moved files for us...
          all our couriers also was either packers, suppliers or crackers.. 
          besides we have worked with courier groups before and CB4 shared 
          the WHQ site with devotion..  so like no problems at all ;)

DEFACTO2: What are CB4/Rebels future plans for 1997?
 
CHARLEY:  We're planning to growing in to our new suite.. ;) and to continue 
          to deliver both some heavy quality releases that Rebels are known 
          for and to give you all the great cracked goodies that CB4 was 
          know for AND last but not least, to do this as one BIG HAPPY 
          FAMILY with a great attitude! ;)
 
DEFACTO2: Any comments or greets you wish to mention before we go?
 
CHARLEY:  Yah.. I would like to say that CB4 didn't die with this merge,
          all the prisoners are still here.. just on the other side of 
          the iron bars.. ;))
 
          The greets goes to all of the member of the new and rocking family 
          of Rebels.. '!familyhug' ;) aaand.. special thanks to def_fred, 
          Mercury and Apollo.. ;> bah bye!! ;)

Interview with Comwood (Siteop of Pirates Cove[1])
Conducted by Saint Tok
The Kicking of Nemesis From Pirates Cove

NOTE:     Since the interview took place, there was found to be a 
	  miscommunication problem between the two parties involved. They
	  are now on good terms with each other and Master1 has been
	  re-added to the site. The siteop involved wishes Master1 and
	  Nemesis the best of luck and Master1 wishes the same goodwill
	  to the siteop.
 
DEFACTO2: Your site Pirates Cove used to be the WHQ for Nemesis. But after
          an incident you dropped Nemesis for another group, please go into
          the details of these incidents.

COMWOOD:  Two reasons led us to drop Nemesis.

          (1) My personal relationship with Master1

          (2) My views on NMS as a whole.

          Let me go into detail..

          As you may or may not know, I've gotten a lot of requests to join
          other utils groups... and I've declined them out of loyalty.
 
          But as of lately my relationship with Master1 (leader of NMS) has
          faltered a bit. I trusted him with a shell account on my site and
          he hacked root and created accounts with tons of credits and shit
          like that. But I just simply deleted his shell account and turned
          a blind eye.
 
          Over the past few weeks he demanded his shell account back. Which
          I said no to. But he persisted, even offering me a 1 gig drive to
          give it back (which I said no to). It got to be too much with him
          after a while.
 
          The other guys in NMS are great people... and I've never had a
          problem with them. But Master1 was just too much of a conflict
          with myself. In comes Legends Never Die...
 
          LND offered more to PC then NMS could, at least me and my other
          co's agreed. I sought to seek a peaceful end to my relationship
          with Master1 and NMS.. even offering to keep NMS leech accounts on
          my site.
 
          But as soon as I told them that I made a business decision (which
          is what it is when you own a $20,000 site), Master1 claimed to have
          created my site and said he was going to ruin it now that I left.
          Pretty mature attitude eh? He told me he was going to remove half
          the support from PC and was going to make it worth shit and was
          never gonna log in again.

          NS a co-siteop, asked him if we should remove NMS accounts on the
          site... He said yes. So we did. Then I find out he changed his
          story again. See, I just couldn't trust him anymore. Master1 was
          the one who insisted XDC was dead, he was the one who hacked
          root... How can one stay in a group who's leader is a constant
          liar? Now he says I deleted his account. He didn't even earn all of
          the megs upped on the site. (Though to his credit he earned most of
          them)

          I just wanted to go our own separate ways like adults. He had to
          bring it to this level of childish bickering. He didn't create the
          site. The users did, and anyone that takes that credit away from
          the users is just an ass. And like I told him... it's my site. I
          pay for it. I run it. I take the risks involved with it. He has no
          right, nor does anyone else have the right to tell me or any other
          siteop what he should or should not do. He could have stayed on the
          site with leech. He chose not to.
 
DEFACTO2: Master1 was the person who uploaded the first gigabite worth of
          files to Pirates Cove, don't you think it was unfair to nuke his
          account?
                                    
COMWOOD:  He wanted it deleted. What would you do if someone told you he was
          going to ruin your site? I would have been happy to give him leech
          and have a happy ending to it. He said and I quote "No member of
          NMS is ever going to log in there again".
 
DEFACTO2: True deleting accounts from a site is nothing, but you can ruin
          a site without access?
 
COMWOOD:  Oh I agree. But we asked him if we should delete the NMS accounts
          then he said yes (paraphrasing his exact words).
 
DEFACTO2: What if you are wrong, what if he is innocent and did not hack you?
 
COMWOOD:  I could be wrong... But I believe he tried to pawn it off on XDC
          and then said that he had hacked it with "good intentions". How do
          you hack with good intentions?
 
DEFACTO2: Tell our readers who or what "XDC" is.
 
COMWOOD:  XDC was a user I made in charge of my security (very close friends
          with Master1). He pulled this fake death thing on the scene(2) and I
          killed him from the site because of that. He had many people upset
          and Master1 knew about it and tried to convince me afterwards that
          XDC had nothing to do with it. The two of them are trouble together.
          Too much for me.
 
DEFACTO2: Your site is now co World Head Quarters for LND. Don't you think
          it's very stupid having two WHQ for one group?
 
COMWOOD:  Yea but isn't the idea of Courier WHQ, US HQ, European HQ etc.
          just as idiotic? CO-WHQ is something new we're giving a try.
          Nothing to make big fuss over. Also takes the load off the site
          when a release comes out cause you always know it's going to be
          on one site or the other when it's out. But like I said, we're
          just experimenting.
                
DEFACTO2: You know perfectly well the reasons for a Courier HQ, WHQ, EHQ etc.
          but to have two WHQ on the net is just a silly idea. But I can
          accept your view, we know that you most likely didn't want anything
          less then a World HeadQuarters status, and seeing LND already had
          a WHQ you decided to try two WHQ's. Agreed?

COMWOOD:  In a nutshell, yeah.
 
DEFACTO2: Thanks for your time, any last works or greets before we go?

COMWOOD:  Yeah, out to Elmo and Nightsky. They have as much to do with the
          success of the site as I do. I just wish everyone could just get
          along without fighting all the time. It solves nothing and just
          creates more problems.


(1) Pirates Cove is the World Headquarters for Reflux, Empire and co-WHQ
    for Legends Never Die.
(2) Some people claimed that XDC died in a road accident after New Years.

Interview with Crazy
Conducted by Saint Tok
SWMP hacked, Rapiers view.


DEFACTO2: Welcome again Crazy, tell about the resent troubles between
          Rapier and SWMP?

CRAZY:    Well one person from Rapier was pissed at Bush(1) and passed his
          login and password on the private rapier channel, so some kid
          logged into his account and totally fucked his account. Some people
          from  Rapier and others groups also logged in. SWMP was not IP
          checking at this time, anyone was able to log into bush's account,
 
DEFACTO2: Did you ever find out who this kid was?
 
CRAZY:    Yes, REAL gave it on the private Rapier channel, so some Rapier
          and non Rapier people tried Bush's account on SWMP and it's was
          working and so they totally fucked his account.
 
DEFACTO2: What has happened to Real since then?
 
CRAZY:    I don't see him on the Net anymore, but as soon as I reach him, I
          will kick him out of Rapier. I don't want this kind of people in my
          group, we got accused because of one person.
             
DEFACTO2: You said "in my group", I thought Rapier has more leaders then just
          yourself.
 
CRAZY:    Yes three others lead with me, but they are not really informed
          about this problem because they are busy in real life. So I take
          care of it. All seniors of Rapier know about it but the leaders
          have not been here lately.
 
DEFACTO2: Is everything clear in Rapier now? After this incident a lot of
          people are mad at Rapier, especially the siteop of Swmp. He was
          mad as hell.
 
CRAZY:    Nothing is really clear, I cant reach REAL but as soon as I see
          him, Im gonna kick him out of Rapier. Yes Swedemike was mad and I
          understood his attitude, it's really lame to doing this. Well the
          scene got too many new kid's nowadays. I've talked with Swedemike
          and we will fix everything really soon.
 
DEFACTO2: What can you tell us about Rapier in general?
 
CRAZY:    Well Rapier is a good group. We have good net couriers and overall
          a great team. We reformed in September and we have kicked ass
          already. We are a friendly group, I love this group.
 
DEFACTO2: Any comments or greets before we go?
 
CRAZY:    Okay I just want to let everyone know that this bad thing with
          Swmp will not happened again. I am really sorry about it.

          Some greet goes out to Jimmy Jamez, Tok, Eviltea, Mach1
          Stingray, Mercury, Lester, and all people I forgot :)

Interview with Crazy
Conducted by Saint-Tok
Leaving Devotion and Xforce 
 
 
DEFACTO2: Please introduce yourself to our readers please and what are your
          current and past affiliations?
 
CRAZY:    I am Crazy and I am currently in Rapier and Class, I was in few
          groups including RISC, Amnesia, Devotion, X-force and Sodom.
 
DEFACTO2: Why have you recently left Devotion and X-force?
 
CRAZY:    Devotion is the best group of courier nowadays, I love this group
          but I left them for good, me and nine cant get along in a same
          group and I decided to quit devotion cuz I think nine was more
          important for them than me since I don't trade anymore, and I still
          have all my friend here and dizzident understood the situation.
 
DEFACTO2: Why can't you cope being in the same group as Nine?
 
CRAZY:    Ok in fact me and nine cant get along in a same group for some
          reason people don't need to know. so I didn't wanted to start fight
          public on the channel cuz this group Devotion is the best in my
          mind and have really good relation.
 
DEFACTO2: Okay, tell us why you left X-Force?
 
CRAZY:    Ok about X-force, I quit them RECENTLY after 6 or 7 months. I was
          co-leader, and recently few problem happened. But I got few
          friends in X-force and I don't want to blast this group in any way.
          They are good and I wish the best for them in the future. The
          problem has started when many newbie got accepted in X-force
         .
 
DEFACTO2: Why didn't leaders listen you when you disagreed about accepting
          newbies?
 
CRAZY:    I Told them about few ways.. but they told me always you need to
          LISTEN and approve your leadership, so I was disagree.
 
DEFACTO2: Let's talk about scene in general, what are your favorite groups
          (util, game or courier) and why are they so?
 
CRAZY:    My favorite courier group is Devotion for sure. I love them cuz
          they know what is friendship and respect. But you know I am Rapier
          leader so I love them also :))
 
          My favorite games groups is Class, I used to be in Prestige but
          they are dead. Shadow Master is a great leader but many people
          hate him maybe because he is the best supplier of games. Class is
          the best forever.
 
          As for utils there are many groups that are good and I respect
          groups such as Drink or Die, X-force, Pirates with Attitude, Sodom
          and Legends Never Die, they are all good.
 
DEFACTO2: Just before we go how is Class going, we have seen a fair few
          releases from them lately?
 
CRAZY:    You know CLASS is a new game group formed in 1997. They have
          already released a few titles this yeah. They maybe new but very
          soon they will be number one. Of cause to me they are already
          the best. Class being formed by Shadow Master again will rox
          just as Prestige did in 1996.
         
DEFACTO2: Any comments about our magazine Defacto2 and some greets before we
          we go?

CRAZY:    I've read the first issue of DF2, seems a great mag with good
          organization, not like Reality Check Network (bullshit mag) who
          where here to try to get into fights between certain groups and
          tell lies.
 
          I want to great some friends: Stingray, Mach One, Immortal
          Jimmy Jamez, Zer0_T, Hawkeye, Lester and all other people I
          forget :)


Note: Since this interview was conducted Crazy left Rapier just before
      they died.

Interview with The Crazy Little Punk
Conducted by Saint Tok
Reflux Dominates the Newyear.


DEFACTO2: I believe everyone already knows you so you don't need to introduce
          yourself. How New Year for Reflux? 
 
TKLP:     Well we closed down releasing for the last week or so in December
          96 to plan for the new Year. We debuted at midnight for the new
          year with 5 releases. We did extremely well I believe in January
          until the end of the month with the busts, etc. We did 3 releases
          today (2/9/97) and are ready to do a lot more now that things have
          blown over.
 
DEFACTO2: I noticed that Razor1911, Class and Hybrid are doing a bit and
          Reflux release out a lot of games. I can't say for sure about
          quality because I did not check them by myself, but I have not
          seen any dupes, or unworkable releases. What was the reason of
          success in January of 97?
 
TKLP:     Motivation, Dedication, Loyalty, and Organization is what lead
          us to it.
 
DEFACTO2: But why only now has it happened?
 
TKLP:     Busy time for the leaders, (myself and Tai Pan) and the not very
          good member/senior support or organization on who's going for what
          releases. But all that has been taken care of, that's why we are
          doing so well.
 
 
DEFACTO2: After "Cyber Strike" a lot of the public group channels went to
          invite only, including #reflux, why haven't you reopened your
          channel?
 
TKLP:     Well if the feds are going to watch us, they'll get into our
          channel secretly and not let us know it. Invite only isn't going
          to keep them out.
 
DEFACTO2: What is your personal opinion about Cyber Strike, you believe they
          will start some busts on sites soon?
 
TKLP:     It all depends on...
          1) if the feds are satisfied so far .
          2) what lamers siteops let on their sites.
          3) how much the IP gets out/how big the site.
          4) if the site is making money from warez.
          5) if the site doesn't use a ip bouncer or firewall. 
 
DEFACTO2: Has anyone from Reflux been busted?
 
TKLP:     No, not from Cyberstrike.
 
DEFACTO2: What do you think about electronic magazines?
 
TKLP:     I think, like all EMags that publicly distribute themselves, are
          BAD. Emags should ONLY be given to people who are something in the
          scene. Not every Joe Smith out there on the net. That's how Feds get
          a lot of their info. Warez mags should be completely UNDERGROUND.
          That's why I don't think highly of ANM/RCN/AFT/ETC.
 
DEFACTO2: Well I hope we don't go that way. Lets hope Reflux releases the
          best game for February. Any last words before we go?
 
TKLP:     Yeah, the way of the reflux: Pain Is Temporary, But Pride Is
          Forever!

Interview with Zero Tolerance
Conducted by Saint Tok
Zero Tolerance Leaving Rapier
 
 
DEFACTO2: Please introduce yourself to the Defacto2 readers.
 
ZERO TOL: Hi readers, my name is [Zer0_T] on IRC and it's short for Zero
          Tolerance. My current affils are Amnesia net trader and Legends
          Never Die net trader. 
 
DEFACTO2: You where in Rapier not so long ago, and you where probably their
          best courier. Why did you leave Rapier?
 
ZERO TOL: Well I don't know about being the best, I am rather modest :)),
          but I was one of their more active traders. I joined RPR about 2-3
          months ago. Then I was on like a couple of semi-decent sites.
          Little by little a traded and got added to bigger and better
          sites.. Well to make it short I though I would never leave RPR.
          I thought I would be the last one left in the group if it ever died
          cause like loyalty and shit is important to me. If you've ever
          looked at a Rapier NFO, you would see that Rapier is a group based
          on friendship and loyalty.
          Well last week, we were in the Rapier secret channel (which is not
          so secret anymore) just messing around with a few of the mates, when
          suddenly out of the blue, one of the Rapier traders (I wont say his
          nick) messaged me and like told me to fuck off and shit. I mean this
          was a dude who was like one of my best friends in the group from the
          start and just suddenly turned on me.
          So, like I tried talking to him to see what was up with him, and he
          just continued to like freak out and tell me shit like "never talk
          to me again" and "we are through as friends" which sort of upsetted
          me. He was like get lost etc... so that's what I did. I left!

DEFACTO2: I heard you left the group without giving notice, why didn't you
          tell anyone?
 
ZERO TOL: Well I don't know what you've heard from Hawk or Sam or any of the
          other leaders, but I explained to Hawk when I had a chat with him
          two days after this happened. I told him why I left, this incident
          was like the cherry on the cake. There where problems in Rapier's
          developing for about 2 weeks before. Leaders were never in the
          channel, siteops were bitching about lack of support on sites and
          were threatening to leave the group.
          When I approached one of the leaders at the time with these problems
          he just set himself away and went to play Diablo or whatever net
          game he was hooked on!
          This was a common occurrence. Cq had not been on IRC for over four
          weeks and Hawk was there only once every 2 weeks. Sam was there on
          a daily basis could never be reached because he was playing Diablo
          24/7, instead of taking care of his group. Many Rapier couriers
          were upset with him and have threatened to leave. 
 
DEFACTO2: I can imagine that you were upset with Rapiers internal problems
          and this rubbish from your ex-friend was the icing on the cake.
          But don't you think that every group can have it's up and down
          times. Maybe if you waited it out the group would have sorted it's
          self out? Don't you also think that leaving Rapier without talking
          to the leaders first was a bit of a rash response on your side?
          I'm sure the leaders could have sorted this person out even if it
          meant that he had to be kicked from the group.
 
ZERO TOL: Well I was a senior in Rapier and if you asked Sam I had all the
          power in the group to act as a leader. I was able to accept whoever
          I wanted and kick whoever I wanted at anytime. Even Sam could tell
          you that. You are right, all groups have their ups and downs, and I
          know Rapier was in that mode. But like I said, the shit that was
          told to me by this "so-called" friend was too much. Friendship to me
          is very important, and what was said had upsetted me a lot. This
          person has tried messaging me often on IRC since this incident
          trying to excuse himself, but I simply ignore him. He even admits
          making the mistake and being wrong. Of cause this might sound
          pathetic and boring to some readers, but people that know me will
          tell you that I am a very friendly guy.. I don't look for trouble
          unless it looks for me.

DEFACTO2: Why did you join Amnesia after leaving Rapier?
 
ZERO TOL: When I left Rapier I did so with no intention of joining a courier
          group for a while. I refused all offers from groups for six days,
          then I decided to join one. I had hunged out in #amnesia for a while
          and the people there made me feel right at home, they were very
          friendly to me. So after almost one week of idling on IRC I decided
          to join up with them. I want to emphasize though, that I did not
          leave Rapier to join Amnesia. When I left RPR I wasn't thinking of
          joining any group, actually I had RPR people offer me ideas of
          starting a new group with some other friends and stuff, including
          CRAZY (heheh I want to see his reaction when he sees his name
          mentioned :)). But I quickly lost interest in that idea due to the
          great number of groups out there.
 
DEFACTO2: What country are you from?
 
ZERO TOL: I'm from Canada.
 
DEFACTO2: What is your opinion of "Cyber Strike" and has it effect you in
          anyway?
 
ZERO TOL: Well Canada hasn't been hit by it, not yet at least. It's been
          mostly our southern bordered friends the USA. But I don't no, it's
          got people all freaked out and shit. But they haven't done anything
          to sites or traders as far as I know! I think people are just
          over-reacting over a few BBS busts.
          In my area code there where seven BBS's that where busted two years
          ago. It totally wrecked the scene there. Cyber Strike had five BBS's
          busted in the whole country I believe, so you can see the
          difference! I think it was just there to tell the software pirates
          that the cops are watching and stuff, but they well know that this
          has grown to big to be stoped. Their busts just put a small dent in
          warez, we will recover shortly and be back on track as before!

DEFACTO2: Thanks for you time, any last greets or final words?
 
ZERO TOL: I'd like to greet all my buds on IRC, they know who they are, and
          tell certain individuals in RAPIER to stop acting like asses and
          shit. I still have many friends left in that group, and a couple
          of them are trying to break off this friendship so I ask them to
          chill. Bye to all :)

  Legends Never Die Vs Sodom
  --------------------------
 
  Not that long ago Legends Never Die released a pre-release beta of
  Vermilion FTPD (see the nfo capture below). Apparently LND has no
  crackers who are willing or are capable of creating a quality serial
  crack. They instead decided to use Sodom's crack which was made for
  an older version of the same program. They where even kind enough to
  to mention Sodom in their NFO of the release (though they only used
  the abbreviated form, SDM).

  (LND part NFO for their Vermillion FTP Daemon pre-release.)
 ÉÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ»

  When I found out about this I asked a leader from LND why they used a
  Sodom crack without permission, they gave us a simple reply...
  "Guys, we are best, and we was fast, so don't cry that you did not release
  it". Now this is not the point, I don't think they can or are willing to
  accept the fact that the stole a crack. Next they said "We where smart and
  put SDM as cracker, next time we don't go to do that". After which I laugh,
  does this mean they are going to steal more cracks? And they still didn't
  understand the problem, and I still believe they don't understand.

  Maybe they have no idea about the scene tradition, maybe it's not the whole
  group but only a few selected members. But it's not acceptable to steal
  other peoples work with out first gaining their permission, in which case
  it's not stealing anymore but borrowing or using.


  Legends Never Die Vs Sodom Part II
  ----------------------------------

  Sodom (the group I am the leader of) released a big release. A release
  that was over the standard disk limit for utility releases (our release
  was 150megs). Everyone understood that this release could and would be
  nuked on some sites. Firstly because it was a Novell release and secondly
  because it was over the disk limit. But before spreading this release I
  personally spoke to the siteops of LND's sites and asked their permission
  to upload this release to their sites. They said it was okay and everything
  seemed fine.

  Once we started spreading this release the LND leaders decided to flex
  some muscle (because of the above incident) and show Sodom who has the
  power. They sent a message to their siteops saying to nuke that Sodom
  shit since you are LND.

  So the siteop's did what they where asked and nuked the release, their
  reason being and I quote "BIG". This in my opinion is stupid, not because
  these siteops nuked the release on request but because they nuked it
  after saying it was okay to be uploaded to their sites. It kind of makes
  them look stupid and it makes me wonder if the siteops are just puppets
  for their affiliated leaders.

  A siteop has the right to do what they wish to their site. If they allow
  a release to their site and someone does not like it the siteop's should
  not be forced into nuking it just because it was released by an opposing
  group. Why should a group decide what a siteop allows on their site?
     
  After this incident a few couriers asked the siteop's involved to remove
  their accounts from the siteop's sites because of these siteops lied to
  them about this release.

                 THE GAME REVIEW MONTHLY SUMMARY FOR DEFACTO2
                            ( January / February )
                      
Welcome to The Game Review Monthly Summary. This report will go through TGR's
reviews to bring you the best games of the month. Due to size restrictions we
will only give you quotes from the reviews, if the game sounds interesting go and get
the full TGR and read the full review. But this reports main purpose will
be to list the best game of the month for both Windows and DOS format and to
also name the best group of the month. The best group will be decided on who
has the highest number of quality releases. These awards will be based on the
reviews done by TGR (not including guess reviews). Hopefully will we will use
this system to eventually work out the best group of the year when the time
comes.

-Rating scale:

                (60-69)/100 = Pretty decent game. Might want to check it out.
                (70-79)/100 = Worth the download if you like that type.
                (80-89)/100 = Very good, 9 out of 10 its worth the download.
                (90-99)/100 = Excellent game, a MUST download.
                    100/100 = Ecstasy on your hard drive.              

RATINGS are based on the game idea, graphics, sound, playability, ingenuity,
versatility, and a lot of other words ending in `ity'. These games are based
on what happens on the TGR computers only, unless stated otherwise. TGR
always first follows .nfo directions, and if those don't work or are not
available, they then try other ways.

"All three games have pretty good/funny voice remarks that come up when you
get shot, or do something wrong.. Also this could've very easily been one of
those monstrous 50 disk rips, but I feel this one was ripped really good.
Dare I say it?? Good job guys."

POINTS: 86 -Decently ripped, good grafix, and cool gameplay. If you have a
           shitty system, don't try this at home!

and walk around. In the off chance your mech gets blown up, you don't die,
you just get auto-ejected out of your mech. When that happens, the other guy
gets out of his mech and ya go man to man with grenades and a laser rifle.
If you happen to beat him, well, hey, free enemy mech to strut around in!"

                          <*>THE GAME OF MONTH<*>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's been pretty dull in the game scene for the past month, normally we get
those big name titles that didn't make it for Christmas but it seems those
games (Xcom3, XWing vs Tie Fighter, Theme Hospital etc.) just keep being
delayed so we are left with some very average games. Not to say the whole
month was a waste, the sequel to the popular Dawn Patrol was released and
for action gamers there was Die Hard Trilogy. Lets just hope we never have
a week like we did two weeks ago (read TGR 45 or 46).

The award for the group with the highest number of quality games for the
month goes to "CLASS"

The best Windows95 game for January/February goes to "Die Hard Trilogy"
which was released by CLASS.

The best DOS game for January/February goes to "Dawn Patrol" which was
also released by CLASS.

  January/February Month in Review
  --------------------------------

  The old Defacto was the first to bring you The Week In Review
  (which has been copied by every magazine since). Now we are back
  we give you The Month In Review.


  Cell Block 4 merge into Rebels. Read our interview with Charley
  for further information.

  Cyberstrike, an operation by the FBI to take down the pirating
  scene in the USA cause major panic in the scene. Surprisingly
  most people first heard about this operation on CNN.

  The operation Cyberstrike was successful in the taking down of
  5 BBS/Telnet boards located in the United States. It was also
  successful in getting a lot of Americans scene members into a
  panic. Many public channels went to invite, some major group
  web pages went off-line. A lot of sites located in Colleges and
  schools around the country temporally went down. And people even
  changed their online nicks and email addresses.

  Inept the first web based scene report, became major contributors
  to this Cyberstrike hype by claiming the FBI had their own IRC
  server and logged all our messages both private and in channels
  (except DCC chats). These claims where later all proven false.

  Marbz retires from his position as Empire Leader.

  After some Rapier leaders call it quits it's members decide to
  follow (to either join Amnesia or Empire). Rapier is officially
  dead, again.

  Manhunter, one of the leaders of the original Rapier was apparently
  thinking of restarting the group, but after he discovered there was
  nothing in Rapier to run, he realized it was best left dead.

  Continuing the tradition of previous years, the game scene for
  the month of January and February has been pretty slow to say
  the least. Not surprisingly Prestige has not released anything
  this year. Can we now consider them officially dead?

  CP reformed Mortality, though nothing much has been shown by them
  since their reformation.

  Remember all those rumors of Reality Check Network making a come
  back a few weeks ago (With Rebel Chicken and Code)? Well the rumors
  where false, Rebel Chicken re-opened the #RCN channel and pretended
  the magazine was back so he could personally find out about Cyberstrike.

  The quote of the month goes to a person on irc called Denial, who
  in the #inept channel asked "What is UNIX? Is it better than AOL ?"
