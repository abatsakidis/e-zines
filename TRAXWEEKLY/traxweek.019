 Hello everyone, welcome to another issue of TraxWeekly.  Due to the small
 number of opinions I have gotten on the Hornet merger (ZERO), I assume
 no one reads what I type here, or no one cares.  Here we are putting
 hours into getting this magazine to you, and no one can take 5 minutes
 out of their day to tell me what you think about this option.  

 I'm sorry for the two people who wanted me to put ads in this issue...
 there was just too much other stuff to think about the ad section.

 I'd like to point out that our interview this week is bigger than
 TraxWeekly #17.  So is the PMS section.  Vortex has sent in a
 contribution explaining his side, I got his article on Wensday,
 and I decided to forward it to psibelius... on thursday I got
 not one, but three follup articles to Vortex's contribution.  We
 also have TraxCulture, provided by me... some readers who have never
 been in #trax might not like it, but many people do... so if you are
 one of the people who dosen't like it, it is easy enough to skip over...
 I think it's funny...

 I now have a WWW page, check out:

 --[ Ramblings of a d00dleb0y ]---------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Good-day. My name is Neurotic, a name which may not be familiar to
 many of you in #trax due to the fact that it is not the channel I usually
 hang out in. Why? Because I'm not a musician, despite my two attempts in
 that direction. Anyone who has listened to either of them can agree that
 my decision to remain an ansi artist was quite sound. This is not saying 
 that I have no musical taste, just that I have no ability to track.

     I realize that some of you must be thing "oh god! one of those geeks
 from #ansi!", but I will assure you that I am not part of that crowd.
 Heck, when I enter that channel half the morons in there mistake me for a
 newbie, or someone else with a similar handle. You know you've been around
 too long when the lamers-who-have-a-similar-nick-as-you are now in Acid.

     I was one of the original members of Union, and it was under my wings,
 as well as my fellow lessor staff members, that the group achieved it's
 notoriety. Early this year I left Union, after spending almost a year as
 staff, for a position in iCE. There I remained, until recently when I left
 along with several other old-name artists to form a group named Legend (not
 to be confused with the warez or demo groups of similar names). Needless to
 say, I've got over 75 ansis under my belt, as well as a couple of years
 experience, so I'm not your typical d00dle-lamer.

     I am super-d00dle-lamer. Enough blowing my own horn. Actually, I
 wish I could blow my own horn, but that's another text file.

     In the ansi scene, as the music scene, we deal with rippers. Apparently
 we deal with them more efficiently, because you don't see that many people
 making this big a deal of it. Said ripper simply gets defamed and kicked
 out of said group and no one hears from him again. I supposed that is a
 reflection of our egos and our ability to be pricks, since we wouldn't
 allow a forum for said ripper to continue to waste our time and energy,
 while you offer him articles in your magazines.

     I personally feel that this is because the majority of people
 attracted to ansi artwork are of a higher level of intelligence than most
 musicians.

 *** Neurotic has joined #ansi

     Ignore that last comment.

     Honestly, you guys on #trax are putting up with a hell of a lot more
 shit than we would. Maybe that's because the ansi scene has its roots in
 the warez scene while the music scene originated from pd. We're used to
 being elitist bastards.

     But pd doesn't necessarily mean lame. Two years ago I ran a local pd
 group with some friends of mine (MiST), and we contained musicians amongst
 our members. Unfortunately one of these musicians ripped, something my
 fellow members and I managed to catch since we all were pretty much fans of
 listening to pc music at the time. I ran a board with several hundred megs
 devoted to songs. We kicked him out of our group and disassociated
 ourselves from him and we went on to prosper, while he grew to become one
 of the biggest lamers my local scene ever produce imho.

     The funny thing about lamers is, they're usually lame in all aspects
 of life. ie: compulsive lying, stealing, back-stabbing, you name it. This
 one was, and eventually my local scene rejected him because of his actions.

     One may ask why I am getting myself involved in this matter. Simply
 put, Future Assassin is a friend of mine, and it was he who brought this
 to my attention by calling me up and saying "hey, recognize this?". I did.
 At the time of the Union music disk's release, I was senior staff in Union.
 I was the one responsible for zipping up and spreading all our packs and
 stuff. I zipped up the final copy of the Union music disk as well as the
 final version of the Union september pack and sent them to Nailz, the union
 whq and our major system in the us, Harvest Moon, all at the same time. I
 can vouch for the integrity of when the file was released, as can just
 about anybody who was in the scene at that time and bothered to pick up the
 music disk.

     I find it shocking that the accusees still refuse to accept the blame.
 This wasn't a similar sounding tune, this was byte-for-byte rippage with
 only the sample descriptions changed. Classic method. In many cases the
 song names, as well as the file names for the samples, are the same. In
 some of the original songs the original musician had used sample names
 containing his initials or handle, these remained unchanged in the rips.
 I mean, how dumb do you have to be not to realize these songs were ripped?
 How dumb?

     I mean, how dumb do you have to be? Talk about ignorance.

     The accusees in this matter seem to disbelieve the original proof,
 regardless of whatever evidence is brought in to the matter. You could
 hand them a sealed envelope with a disk containing the original music
 disk and a post date on it. They would claim that you took an old envelope
 and resealed it with the disk in it. They simply refuse to admit their
 wrong-doing.

     The most profound argument against their rebuttal would have to be:
 why would the original artists bother wasting their time? No well-known
 artist goes out and accuses a total nobody of ripping their stuff. It just
 isn't worth the time. Sorry to burst Immortal Software Production's bubble,
 but a total nobody is who you are. The only reason why you would be
 immortal is due to this incident.

     If Future Assassin hadn't brought knowledge of the ripping to the
 public, most people would never have heard of you. I sure know I wouldn't
 have, and I'm in your area code. "Fire in the Sky/Soul" was your average
 mdp music disk. Nothing special. The only thing that made it stand out from
 the crowd was the fact that the music was ripped.

     Even though it may be your wet dream, you guys aren't Future Crew. The
 sooner you realize this and get off your high horses and actually do
 something of note, the better off you will be. One thing I've pick up from
 the ansi scene is that I tend to mainly respect people who have been around
 long enough to make some sort of a mark on the scene. Because truly, until
 you've walked the walk, you can't even come close to talking the talk.

     And I'm afraid that talking is all that Immortal Software Productions
 can do.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Ok everyone, before I get started, I'd just like to thank
 Popcorn for taking this article.  That was something he didn't have to
 do.  Thanks.

         Now then, to the action.  As I'm sure 99.999% of you know, I am
 the one who shut down the Plagiarism In the Music Scene (PMS) page.  As
 a result of this, most people from the music scene don't like me too
 much.  In this article, I'm going to attempt to explain to you all why I
 shut down PMS, why I think I was well within my rights to do so and why
 I think a number of people have been immature in dealing with this whole
 thing.

         I'll begin by telling you all what exactly happened on my end
 the day I had PMS shut down; July 1.  I logged in and found a message
 from Psibelius in my mailbox.  It stated his opinion of myself, MuzikMan
 and Immortal Software Productions and that we had been featured on PMS.
 At that time, I didn't even know what PMS was, but decided to check it
 out since Psibelius was nice enough to give me the URL.  I loaded the
 page and found a number of things on it which I didn't totally expect.

         In the section involving Immortal Software Productions and the
 accusations of MuzikMan having ripped music from several individuals, I
 found not only the "facts", but such things as our E-Mail addreses,
 links to those addresses, a link to my group's home page, such
 opinionated terms as "lamer" and worst of all, PRIVATE E-Mail between me
 and Future Assassin available for download in ZIP format.  I was shocked
 and furious to say the least. Not only was none of this was published
 with our consent, but the "facts" which were stated were never entirely
 proven, though MuzikMan and I did apologize for them to avoid getting
 flamed every five minutes.  I sat around for the better part of the
 morning trying to think of a way I could deal with this, then it came to
 me.  That page had to be running off of SOMEBODY'S server!  After a
 little surfing, I found out the E-Mail address for the server's
 administrator.
 
         I thought for a while of what kind of a message I would send
 her.  What I ended up telling her was that the page contained Libelly
 Defamatious or slanderous matieral (which was true), that we could sue
 Psibelius and the University if we wanted to (true) and that, though we
 had no intention of doing such a thing, that some future person who
 would be featured on that page may decide to (also true).  In order to
 save the University possible future legal action, the administrator told
 Psibelius to take the page offline, which he did.
 
         Some time went by, I went off to the Canada Day festivities with
 my friends and for another day or two, nothing really happened.  Then
 people started finding out what I had done.  Yet again, I wasn't a
 favoured person in the music scene.  I would be kicked and usually
 banned from #TRAX when I would join it.  Sometimes actual people would
 do it, other times, those who didn't have the balls to kick and ban me
 themselves would have Enchanter do it. Eventually, someone added my to
 Enchanter's "PermBan" list which prohibited me from joining #TRAX at
 pretty much any time.  I also received a few E-Mail flames which I
 ignored.
  
         One night, I decided to go and see if there was some way I could
 make peace with at least some of the people.  I joined #TRAX and
 evevtually got into an MSG conversation with Necros on what I had done.
 He tried to shut #TRAX up so I could make an apology.  Most people
 didn't accept it and told me I was a "lamer".  I also found and read
 Psibelius' article in TraxWeekly #17 which browsing the HORNET Archive
 one night.
 
         In the past weeks, I have been called a selfish individual, a
 thief, a lamer and many other things that I won't write.  People have
 told me that I was being unfair and that I had no right to shut down
 PMS.  They were completely gung-ho on the idea that PMS was preserving
 the right of musicians.  I will admit without delay, that PMS was
 protecting the rights of musicians, but I ask you all, what about
 everyone else's rights?  What about the rights of those who have been
 accused and convicted of a crime that they were never proven of
 commiting?  What about one's right to a fair trial?  Now I know that
 many of you would argue the right to free speech which is one of our
 most important rights.  Another important right is the right to a fair
 trial.  I tried arguing this with some people and they said that a
 person's right to free speech takes precedence.  Where may I ask if that
 etched in stone?  No single right is more important than another.  For
 that matter, what about the privacy right?  I didn't see Psibelius
 excercising that when he published my provate E-Mail with Future
 Assassin. I could care less if Future Assassin authorised it or not, *I*
 didn't!

         Also, where do many of you people get off flaming us all the
 time?  For starters, if MuzikMan in fact did rip those songs, what makes
 it the right of anyone other than the accusors to come in and say that
 we're a bunch of theiving lamers who are a disgrace to the music scene?
 Immortal Software Productions didn't release Fire in the Soul to impress
 you people and we didn't release it for your criticizm.  We made it so
 that MuzikMan could show what he could do.  If we knew beyond a
 reasonable doubt that he ripped that music, we would pull our disk off
 Internet and kick him out so fast he wouldn't know what hit him!  We
 don't condone ripping.  We didn't kick him because the only proof we
 were given was the apparent "originals" of the songs which could have
 just as easily been modified by someone else as by us.
 
         Now, in terms of PMS, I admit that I was perhaps a bit
 out-of-line having it shut down, but personally I believe Psibelius and
 all supporters of the page were way more out-of-line than I was.  Anyone
 who supports PMS is basically saying, "We have our rights and they are
 more important than everyone else's.  We also can't be wrong because
 we're the majority and the majority is never wrong!"  That is the single
 biggest load of crap I have EVER heard.  Basically, I was thought to be
 some sort of evil threat to you for first having a musician who was
 accused and not proven of ripping and secondly for sticking up for him.
 Many have asked me, "Why do you stick up for him?  Why not just kick him
 and save your own ass?"  I'll tell you why, because he and everyone else
 in Immortal Software Productions is a good friend of mine.  Is it a
 crime to stick up for one's friends when they are accused of something?
 I think most of you would say no.  Well then, why must you all pester me
 so much?  I stuck up for my friends and because of that, I am apparently
 some evil-doer.  Hell, one night I even received two death threats on my
 answering service from some idiot who thought it would be fun to say he
 would kill me for what I did!
 
         People have told me that the best thing for me to do is to
 disband Immortal Software Productions and re-start the group without
 another name and different aliases for all of us.  I have no intention
 of doing any such thing.  We don't believe we are wrong and we will not
 go changing anything around just so we can come back and kiss up to you
 people, hoping that things will get better.  We don't believe we are
 wrong and we will not submit to the mob mentality of a bunch of
 stuck-up, arrogant people who think that they are superior to the rest
 human race.  Not all of what I ahve said here applies to everyone in the
 music scene.  There are a number of you who don't care about this issue
 and have chosen to continue talking to me. I thank each and every one of
 those people.
 
         In conclusion, I would just like to say that you more than
 likely won't hear from another Immortal Software Productions member for
 a while.  I know that's the way many of you want it, so you get your
 wish.  I hope that one day, we can come back and join the scene again as
 people who are respected and not ridiculed for something that some
 people SAY they did.  We are NOT disbanding.  We have projects that we
 are working on and that we hope to release some time in the future, with
 MuzikMan as part of our team.  I will also say without hesitation that I
 am proud and always was proud to be a member of Immortal Software
 Productions.
 
         If anyone has feedback that they wish to send me, they may send
 it to gcorc@synapse.net at their convenience.  Flames are *NOT* welcome.
 If intelligent feedback is sent to me, I promise it will be replied to.
 If flames are sent to me, they will be ignored and their authors will
 show their immaturity.  I thank you all for hearing my view on this
 issue and I hope that one day we can re-join you and contribute to the
 good music that you all produce.  Thank you.
 
                         Gerry Corcoran (gcorc@synapse.net),
                         Proud President of Immortal Software Productions

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Well, it's apparent Vortex isn't going to quit, so here is yet ANOTHER
 breakdown of Vortex's claims.  I'm not going to go into extreme petty
 details; you can find those in my article in TraxWeekly #18, available on
 ftp.cdrom.com /pub/demos/incoming/news.  My responses are denoted with a
 <> in the left-most column.

 For those of you who don't know the story, Gerry Corcoran (Vortex) runs a
 group called Immortal Software Productions.  His musician, Muzikman ripped
 a number of songs by Future Assassin, Pinion, and Maelcum.  When I brought
 their plagiarism to the public view, Gerry Corcoran attempted to censor
 me and have my account removed.

 * This letter was formatted to fit the 76 column space requirement (the
 msg formatting was changed due to PINE mail forwarding).  None of its
 content has been changed.

Hello Popcorn.  Here is my submission for TraxWeekly.  There was a lot I had
to say so it is lengthy.  I hope that's not a problem.  Thanks for letting
me write my opinion.  I appreciate it.  Can you do me a favour and BinHex or
MIME encode a copy of the next TraxWeekly issue when it's released?  I want
to keep a copy of the issue with my article for reference purposes.  Thanks.

Submitted To:  Chris Campbell/Popcorn

       Ok everyone, before I get started, I'd just like to thank Popcorn for

I think I was well within my rights to do so and why I think a number of
people have been immature in dealing with this whole thing.

 <> Say whatever you want, but may I remind you that my article in

 <> point and disproves nearly all of them.

       I'll begin by telling you all what exactly happened on my end the day

       I thought for a while of what kind of a message I would send her.
What I ended up telling her was that the page contained Libelly Defamatious

about the rights of those who have been accused and convicted of a crime
that they were never proven of commiting?  What about one's right to a fair
trial?  Now I know that many of you would argue the right to free speech
which is one of our most important rights.  Another important right is the
right to a fair trial.  I tried arguing this with some people and they said
that a person's right to free speech takes precedence.  Where may I ask if
that etched in stone?  No single right is more important than another.  For
that matter, what about the privacy right?  I didn't see Psibelius
excercising that when he published my provate E-Mail with Future Assassin.
I could care less if Future Assassin authorised it or not, *I* didn't!

 <> PMS is protecting the rights of people to their intellectual property,
 <> which your musician Muzikman violated, and which you supported him in.
 <> Reporting the activites of criminals takes predence.  You as a criminal
 <> recieve no rights.  As for the privacy issue, too bad.  Future Assassin
 <> had his rights violated by YOU and muzikman, and to protect his work and
 <> punish you, he revealed them to the public.  What I'm saying is, I don't
 <> care if you authorized it our not.  Since you and Muzikman didn't show
 <> any respect at all to the people whose music you stole, there is no
 <> reason why you deserve any respect back.

       Also, where do many of you people get off flaming us all the time?
For starters, if MuzikMan in fact did rip those songs, what makes it the
right of anyone other than the accusors to come in and say that we're a
bunch of theiving lamers who are a disgrace to the music scene?  Immortal
Software Productions didn't release Fire in the Soul to impress you people
and we didn't release it for your criticizm.  We made it so that MuzikMan
could show what he could do.  If we knew beyond a reasonable doubt that he
ripped that music, we would pull our disk off Internet and kick him out so
fast he wouldn't know what hit him!  We don't condone ripping.  We didn't
kick him because the only proof we were given was the apparent "originals"
of the songs which could have just as easily been modified by someone else
as by us.

 <> The accusors came to you.  When they were bluntly rejected without any
 <> discussion, they turned to their friends for assistance.  And that is
 <> where we came in to help.  As for "Fire in the Soul," you showed exactly
 <> what Muzikman is capable of: NEXT TO NOTHING.  His rips are so obvious
 <> that any musician that has been in the scene since early 1994 can tell
 <> you it's a rip!  For example, in Muzikman's supposed "remix" of Future
 <> Assassin's "Demon's Pride," why is FA not credited for the original?
 <> When all the sample text is removed, why is Muzikman's mod the same
 <> exact size as the original?  If Muzikman's songs are original as you
 <> claim, then why do Muzikman's samples read "trumpet.fa" among others?
 <> The fact is, Muzikman ripped three songs, and we can PROVE IT.  Perhaps
 <> you would like Interplay Productions to know that Muzikman ripped a song
 <> from their game Star Control II?

       Now, in terms of PMS, I admit that I was perhaps a bit out-of-line
having it shut down, but personally I believe Psibelius and all supporters
of the page were way more out-of-line than I was.  Anyone who supports PMS
is basically saying, "We have our rights and they are more important than
everyone else's.  We also can't be wrong because we're the majority and the
majority is never wrong!"  That is the single biggest load of crap I have
EVER heard.  Basically, I was thought to be some sort of evil threat to you
for first having a musician who was accused and not proven of ripping and
secondly for sticking up for him.  Many have asked me, "Why do you stick up
for him?  Why not just kick him and save your own ass?"  I'll tell you why,
because he and everyone else in Immortal Software Productions is a good
friend of mine.  Is it a crime to stick up for one's friends when they are
accused of something?  I think most of you would say no.  Well then, why
must you all pester me so much?  I stuck up for my friends and because of
that, I am apparently some evil-doer.  Hell, one night I even received two
death threats on my answering service from some idiot who thought it would
be fun to say he would kill me for what I did!

 <> Okay, I'm sick of this shit, and here it is, on the line:  Muzikman is
 <> a ripper.  Most of his songs are rips.  Even the NAME of your musicdisk
 <> is ripped from a movie!  The truth in this matter is that you can't
 <> handle the truth.  You can't handle the fact that one of your friends is
 <> indeed a liar himself, and that you have lied to protect him.  You still
 <> claim that Muzikman's plagiarism was never proven.  How many times do we
 <> have to say this to you?  YOU ARE WRONG.  Do you know WHY the majority
 <> is against you?  Becuase nearly every goddamn musician in the scene that
 <> knows Future Assassin, Pinion, and Maelcum and/or those songs KNOWS that
 <> Muzikman STOLE them.

       People have told me that the best thing for me to do is to disband
Immortal Software Productions and re-start the group without another name
and different aliases for all of us.  I have no intention of doing any such
thing.  We don't believe we are wrong and we will not go changing anything
around just so we can come back and kiss up to you people, hoping that
things will get better.  We don't believe we are wrong and we will not
submit to the mob mentality of a bunch of stuck-up, arrogant people who
think that they are superior to the rest human race.  Not all of what I ahve
said here applies to everyone in the music scene.  There are a number of you
who don't care about this issue and have chosen to continue talking to me.
I thank each and every one of those people.

 <> I couldn't care less if you don't believe you are wrong.  No matter how
 <> you try to get around it, you are WRONG.  As for not kissing up to
 <> people, I have a little email that you sent to a fellow musician
 <> (Blackwolf) that has been publicized.  In the interests of preserving at
 <> least some of your dignity, we have decided not to put it into print, but
 <> it demonstrates exactly who you are.  A politically motivated,
 <> brown-nosing, ass-kissing, LAMER.

       In conclusion, I would just like to say that you more than likely
won't hear from another Immortal Software Productions member for a while.
I know that's the way many of you want it, so you get your wish.  I hope
that one day, we can come back and join the scene again as people who are
respected and not ridiculed for something that some people SAY they did.
We are NOT disbanding.  We have projects that we are working on and that we
hope to release some time in the future, with MuzikMan as part of our team.
I will also say without hesitation that I am proud and always was proud to
be a member of Immortal Software Productions.

 <> You know, it wouldn't be so hard if you APOLOGIZED for what you did, and
 <> end it there.  Your first apology was invalidated after you went on a
 <> covert operation to eliminate my account.  While you appear to repent in
 <> public, your true intentions still belie you.

       If anyone has feedback that they wish to send me, they may send it to
gcorc@synapse.net at their convenience.  Flames are *NOT* welcome.  If
intelligent feedback is sent to me, I promise it will be replied to.  If
flames are sent to me, they will be ignored and their authors will show
their immaturity.  I thank you all for hearing my view on this issue and I
hope that one day we can re-join you and contribute to the good music that
you all produce.  Thank you.

                       Gerry Corcoran (gcorc@synapse.net),
                       Proud President of Immortal Software Productions

TTYL!

"When a day that you happen to know is Wednesday starts
 off by sounding like Sunday, there is something seriously
 wrong somewhere."  -John Wyndham, The Day of the Triffids

 <> Conclusion: Same as last issue.  Gerry Corcoran, you have no honor, and
 <> no ethics.  You are the most immoral person I've been graced to
 <> encounter anywhere.  You and your group have not only victimized other
 <> musicians, you have tried to run away from apologizing, harassed non-
 <> involved people, and tried to have my account removed for no good reason
 <> at all.  Then you are also a liar.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Gerry Corcoran, NO ONE is afraid of you.  Your threats of litigation are
 utterly fantasy.  You know the truth.  If you dare try to silence us one
 more time, you will be met with full retaliation.  This is your last chance
 to apologize and END your crap once and for all...

 ...or otherwise, you and your group REMAIN on the new PMS page and stay
 there to remind others not to repeat your mistakes.  And this time, I've
 found a sysadmin who isn't going to believe or care what you have to say or
 what legalese you try to throw at him.

 * http://www.csusm.edu/public/guests/gwie/pms.html

 Visit the page.  Online, we have not only do we cover most of the private
 mail sent earlier by Muzikman and Vortex, we also have the most convicting
 piece of evidence online.  Future Assassin's original "Demon's Pride" song
 released in the September 1994 Union Musicdisk.  And also a copy of the
 supposed "remix" by Muzikman which is in fact, nothing more than an exact
 copy with Muzikman's name on it.

 Gerry Corcoran, you are an immature brat.  Grow up.

 LAST WARNING: We're going to see a written public apology by you next week,
 in TraxWeekly #20 EXPLICITLY to Future Assassin, Pinion, and Maelcum for
 ripping their songs, and to ME for your attempts to kill my account after
 we agreed to end this battle.  There will be NONE of your claims that you
 are innocent, because we have presented convicting evidence otherwise.
 It's time to face the music.  You aree, and always have been, WRONG.

 --[ Future Assassin Speaks]------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

        For those of you who are sick and tired of this whole "Vortex and
 Muzikman vs. The World" case, page down three or four times.  This may get
 a bit lengthy.  For those of you who still have the energy in your body to
 CARE, read on.

        Once again, it's Future Assassin, and recently I read an article
 written by Vortex which is meant for release in Traxweekly #19.  I found
 this article SO humerous, that I simply had to write a follow-up.

        Rippers are common.  They pop up from place to place, gaining sudden
 negative exposure, and eventually they go away.  Nitewynd being a prime
 example.  However, the case of Muzikman is different.  HE went away, but
 his blindly loyal friend Vortex remains, still tugging at what's left of a
 dead dog's carcass.  It's getting annoying, and I'm going to end the whole
 situation with this letter.  When I first entered the scene, I viewed it
 as being a big, imaginary, virtual playground "A-La-Barney".  It seems that
 on the day that we were playing with our "Mr. Grown Up Hats", Vortex forgot
 to take his off.  Hence, we now have a 16-year old, who wants to go on 30,
 and is doing a bad job.  This is seen by his refusal to realize that he's
 running a GROUP, and not a COMPANY.  It also seems that he gets great
 pleasure out of throwing around legal terms as if he was the one who
 invented them.

        The first thing I'll bring up, and the easiest thing to resolve, is
 the PMS page, a service dedicated to aiding those musicians whose music has
 been ever-so-politely taken from them.  The page undoubtedly contains a few
 songs, E-Mail, and IRC capture files which are related to the music rips in
 question.  All the articles conatin straight, simple fact which has not
 been edited to directly alter the outcome of our opinions.  Heaven-forbid,
 the almighty word "LAMER" has appeared once or twice when talking about
 either Vortex or Muzikman.  What would you EXPECT us to call an obvious
 ripper and his naive group president who enjoys wallowing in self-pity?
 GODS? If that's the case, Malerie, gimme a shotgun and lots of ammo, I
 wanna go to hell.  Speaking of which, my friend and I were talking on the
 phone recently about this situation, and we bagan joking around with the
 concept of this being transcribed into a musical with Vortex and Muzikman
 singing the lead roles and yapping on about how innocent they are.  Then we
 realized that this wouldn't work, because immediately after the musical's
 premiere, Vortex's lawyers would file a lawsuit against Mr. Andrew Lloyd
 Weber pertaining to his theft of their ideas.  Honestly Vortex should
 seriously consider stopping all the constant whining and complaining he's
 been doing lately. If his goal is to act "professional", he has a long way
 to go.

        In Vortex's little ditty to TraxWeekly, he mentioned the use of his
 E-Mail adresses, links to them, etc. on the PMS page.  He made it sound as
 if it was such priviliged, classified information.  FEAR our CSIS spies who
 managed to find all that out for us.  Actually, it was in their info file,
 as well as such things as their phone numbers, schools they went to,
 complete names, etc.  Just be thankful that we were nice enough to leave
 all that out.  They seemed to be anxious to release all their personal
 information when that info file was written.  What's so different now? ...
 Oh yeah, I forgot. Your musician ripped.  I see.

        Next on the list is proving the music rips.  I hate to be the one to
 say this, but there IS no solid way to prove the rips.  In this day and
 age, it's easy to make people think anything on the computer.  However, I
 did some research lately, and found what I consider to be the most solid
 evidence possible.  A local BBS to Vortex, Musikman, and I, <We live in the
 same city> called "NED'S OPUS".  It's a rather BIG board, and the sysop is
 known for being quite the prick.  Getting ANY kind of favour out of him is
 impossible, unless you're a $10,000 a year payed subscriber.  Anyways, I
 found the musicdisk ON that BBS, and the date it was uploaded was the 11th
 of November, 1994.  That's certainly LONG before Musikman "created" his
 musicdisk. Searching for "UNIM" will find it. If he STILL refuses to
 believe that the music was ripped, then forget it, I guess I'll have to live
 with the fact that he simply doesn't want to grow up and face the facts like
 a good little group president. Vortex, if you want the numbers for NED'S,
 leave me mail.  My address is at the end of the article.

        I must admit, however, that I commend Vortex on his loyalty to his
 group and it's members.  Unfortunately, he's taking it a little too
 seriously.  It amuses me that he still sticks up for Muzikman even after
 he admitted to the rips.  Vortex MAY be doing a good job at being a close
 friend for Muzikman, but he'll have to think of the fact that Muzikman's
 rips have cut the group's.... Err... Sorry..... COMPANY'S reputation down
 considerably.  Vortex, maybe you should consider the fact that your loyalty
 to your friend isn't being returned, hmm? I must say, the only thing that
 you're a victim to is your own ignorance, and refusal to accept the facts.
 99% of the users in the scene consider it all a hobby, just a few people
 getting together, and composing some cool tracks.  Most of them do it for
 their own satisfaction, and the only thing they ask for in return is
 respect for what they have accomplished.  I never had any intention of
 bringing law enforcement agencies into this matter, I just wanted the
 respect due to me for my music, and low-and-behold, I couldn't even get
 that, thanks to Muzikman.  You keep complaining about how Immortal
 Software Productions aren't getting the rights you people deserve.  Well,
 you lost your rights when you infringed on the rights of Myself, Pinion,
 Maelcum, and a few others.

        Now, Vortex, you have more proof as to the rips Muzikman has made.
 You now have the option of believing us, or him.  I personally don't care
 anymore, because you carried this on way too long.  It's hard trying to get
 a simple concept into the brain of someone who isn't willing to have an
 open mind.  There's no more that I can say about this, just that I'm
 dissapointed to find that there are so many two-faced individuals out there
 who don't want to play like good little boys and girls in our virtual
 playground, by our virtual rules.  These mean boys and girls ruin it for the
 rest of us, and in the future, let's be more like Ansi artists. :)

        As for Vortex, I just have one last thing to mention.  You spoke of
 wanting to leave the scene because it was all to harsh for your fragile
 emotions, in light of that, I have this to say:

 See Vortex
 See Vortex leave
 Leave Vortex, Leave.

 --[ SoCal'95 Party Report from Psibelius' Perspective]----------------------
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Well, it's now 5:30pm here in ior's basement bash'95...we have just
 concluded the music compo as well as the 10 minute tracking compo, and I'm
 extremely proud to say that even though only SEVEN of us total attended the
 party, it was a great success and we hope to have a rehash next year.  But
 anyways, on to the actual events:

     I didn't get to ior's basement until early Saturday afternoon, a few
 hours after the party began.  Floss, DrEmp, and ior tackled the machines,
 DOOMing it out for a few hours.  But the of course, DrEmp's parents just
 HAD to use the machine, so there ended our network games...not much
 happened during the day, and I took off around 8pm, but that's where the
 fun began. =)

     Floss, Ior, and Wyvern sat through much of the night viewing demos
 and demos and demos and demos and demos and...=)  I'm pretty sure it was
 entertaining.  Then again, I've never watched 4 hours of demos, so I
 wouldn't know.  The next morning I found Floss and Ior on the ground in
 sleeping bags...

     Sunday, COMPO DAY! =)  By the way, did I mention what Floss found on
 Ior's computer?  Respect for a friend prevents me from printing here
 exactly what direction our discussion went, but Ior replied much along the
 lines of "Those aren't mine!" =P  But anyways Flossie here took off on ST3
 and tracked for over four hours to finish his compo song.  Which took 2nd
 place I believe.  Too bad Greyhound managed to lose his entire $5000
 computer system...Daedalus and Sketch arrived from CSUN and we spent the
 rest of the afternoon tracking, playing songs, and whatever.

     Daedalus spent much of the day on the floor on a beanbag, delerious
 from his numerous injections of codiene or whatever he was high on at the
 time.  We had a few problems tripping over the syringes lying all over the
 floor but we managed to escape any serious injury. =)  (EXCUSE ME, I WAS
 JUST KIDDING)

     We had nine entries in the music compo.  I'm not exactly sure what the
 results were, but we had a lot of great laughs.  Especially when one song
 came up that ranted "eeyore!  eeyore!"  Floss cracked up immediately, and
 most of us followed suit.  In fact, we didn't even hear the rest of the
 song.  Quarex?  Well, that's what we thought.  It turned out to by Cerulean,
 who gets a big pat on the back. =)  That brings me to another point.  Being
 impartial in these damn things is impossible.  And if you people want the
 songs and results, get SOCAL95.ZIP or whatever it's called whenever ior
 decides to release it...

     The ten minute tracking compo was cool.  Except for the fact that
 after the time limit had almost elapsed, Daedalus hit alt-z twice in scream
 tracker and nuked his entire song.  So that left my own song vs. Floss (gee,
 err, I wonder who won???? =).  So I proceeded to get my ass kicked for the
 second time that day...

     We concluded the festivities with speeches (which will be available in
 the party report demo whenever Zab and Floss put it together) and a quick
 singsong of "Harvey the Wonder Hamster."

     Anyways, here are my unofficial ratings about SoCal'95:

     Attendance:   **-------- (estimated 50, actual 7)
     Location:     *******--- (Damn its gets hot in that basement)
     Food:         ********-- (thanks for the tomatosauce-less pizza Daed! =)
     People:       ********** (phear floss, sketch, daed, wyvern, dremp!)
     Organization: *********-(welcome to the EEYORE basement bash'95 =)
     Speeches:     ********** (phear DAEDALUS!  AYIYIYIYIYI!!!!!!!)
     3r33tness:    *************************** (WERD WERD WERD!!!!!!!!!!!)

     Official SoCal'95 Motto: "Sir, please come out of the building with
     your pants down and your wallet out!"

     Yes, I understand that this article is a bit disjointed.  It's actually
 kinda DUMB.  Blah, well anyways, for most of you music scene people, it's
 pretty easy to see we didn't do very much...except have fun. =)  SoCal'95
 was small, not many people attended.  Okay, it wasn't Assembly America: The
 New Phase.  We didn't have huge sponsors, 999999 watt stereo, or 999999 inch
 big screen.  But it still ruled.

     SOCAL95.ZIP should be out right now (1.9 megs).  If not, blame ior. =)
 A party report will be coming out pretty soon, with cool pics, SPEECHES,
 and other assorted party garbage...=)

 --[ Interview with Quarex ]-------------------------------------------------

Here now, complete and UNEDITED, is a combination psychology, tell all, and
interview with QUAREX of Kosmic. WARNING: this REALLY is unedited, this is
not bullshit. I was going to edit all this personal stuff out, but lucky
you, you get to read it after all. Here 'tis...

<Maelcum_> i'm really depressed or something
< Quarex > maybe it's not the best time to do this then :>
<Maelcum_> it's really boring without a damn ftp site to run I guess.
< Quarex > I guess.
< Quarex > Here, instead of having an interview, let's have a deep
           psychological analyzation.
< Quarex > :)
<Maelcum_> if kosmic doesn't have an ftp site, it's really pointless to have
           kosmic nowadays uh oh
< Quarex > uh oh
<Maelcum_> cuz bbses sck now and stuff
<Maelcum_> damn i ate too much of those crappy super-greased mccain's spicy
           curly fries
< Quarex > hehehe
< Quarex > well, yeah.
< Quarex > even though I'm sure you could get another ftp site if you needed.
<Maelcum_> our whole distribution relies on the ftp site now
<Maelcum_> well yeah but in the meantime things are really boring
< Quarex > if defiance could get two sites. . I think kosmic could get at least
           one other stable one.
< Quarex > I'm sure.
* Quarex comforts Maelcum
<Maelcum_> i'm really sick of the *** **** ****** too

NOTE: ok, i lied, somethings HAVE to be edited =)

< Quarex > :)
< Quarex > We should drive to their mainframe and kill them
<Maelcum_> they're nice guys but they're totally clueless about
< Quarex > Maybe they should get more porn.
<Maelcum_> i mean, the first thing you do to run a sucessful ftp site is to
           run it on one kind of software and stick with it
< Quarex >  /kosmic/porn
< Quarex > And especially don't swtch to a less reliable software in the
           middle.

(line omitted)

< Quarex > they just need a good smack.
<Maelcum_> they have plenty of hardware to have a great site, if only they
           would use it right

(stuff omitted)

<Maelcum_> instead of doing anything original like having a nitewynd
           directory.
< Quarex > like having a nitewynd directory.
<Maelcum_> it's like they really don't have much incentive.. like at one
           time they might have, but they've lost it now you could have
           androids replace them
< Quarex > you could have androids replace them like in GI Joe
<Maelcum_> even a nitewynd directory would be an improvement on the world's

(man, quarex, buy a terminal program that logs scrolled messages =)

<Maelcum_> jeez hahhahahaahh
< Quarex > hehe
<Maelcum_> shut up
< Quarex > hahahah
<Maelcum_> i should be logging this for traxweekly
< Quarex > I could send you a copy :)
<Maelcum_> but i just realized logging SUCKS on vt100 irc with procoomm
<Maelcum_> are you logging this? good
< Quarex > hahahaha
< Quarex > "the pre-interview chatter"
<Maelcum_> are you? as long as one of us is
<Maelcum_> fuck the interview
< Quarex > haha
< Quarex > yeah, we'll have to cut that out
<Maelcum_> since i'm always for family values and stuff
< Quarex > hehe
<Maelcum_> i have a really bad pain like i think women get when they have had
           birth by caesarean section
< Quarex > sure, I'm for family values, but I demand EVIL!
<Maelcum_> i carried like 5 air conditioners today
< Quarex > Then perhaps you should quit that job as an arms dealer.
<Maelcum_> i really hate air conditioners now
<Maelcum_> i couldn't be an arms dealer, i only have one arm that works well
<Maelcum_> do you know those bucky and vinny guys?
<Maelcum_> the taxi drivers turned film critics?
<Maelcum_> who subway is now paying to go around the country and eat their
           subs?
<Maelcum_> ping?
< Quarex > ping
<Maelcum_> well, that should be us
< Quarex > hehe.
<Maelcum_> we should be on a subway commercial
<Maelcum_> eating subs for money
< Quarex > Maybe they're actually filming you all this time.
<Maelcum_> we'd be cooler than those old farts
<Maelcum_> you're not saying much
<Maelcum_> this whole screen looks like
<Maelcum_>  < Maelcum_ >  blah
<Maelcum_>  < Maelcum_ >  blah
<Maelcum_>  < Maelcum_ >  blah
<Maelcum_>  < Maelcum_ >  blah
<Maelcum_>  < Maelcum_ >  blah
<Maelcum_> etc
<Maelcum_> say more stuff
< Quarex > okay.
< Quarex > fine.
<Maelcum_> what are you, pissing in the wind or somehting?
< Quarex > I'll start saying random things that will go over well with the
           people in traxweekly :)
<Maelcum_> ok
< Quarex > WOW, THIS SURE IS A GREAT INTERVIEW
< Quarex > I AM GLAD TO BE TAKING PART IN A TRAXWEEKLY EXERCISE IN FREEDOM
           OF SPEECH
<Maelcum_> perisoft is really cool and people should leave him alone.
           anyone that fucks with perisoft fucks with me
< Quarex > You wanting hear funny joke, yes american?  I tell joke.
<Maelcum_> no, you gotta say things that are really popular
< Quarex > Why American chicks so ugly?  Because American guys ugly!  Ha!
<Maelcum_> everyone should leave nitewynd alone, because really nitewynd is
           just me in my spare time
< Quarex > oh, that kind of popular.
< Quarex > hahah
<Maelcum_> whenever i get sick of being maelcum, i go and rip other
           people's songs and be nitewynd
< Quarex > D'OH
<Maelcum_> necros is really cool, and an excellent musician.. BUT
<Maelcum_> i am REALLY tired of seeing in EVERY interview...
< Quarex > That's right, you and nitewynd are never in the same place at
           the same time!
<Maelcum_> "OH I KNOW IT'S CLICHE, BUT NECROS is my biggest influence in
           tracking"
< Quarex > Hahahah
<Maelcum_> and the guy who's being interviewed is like a total trent-reznor
           imitator
<Maelcum_> hmm
<Maelcum_> Trent-Reznor; sounds like some financial company
< Quarex > Heh. . the offices of trent-reznor and glenn.
<Maelcum_> i am sorry, but chances are, mr. average tracking joe, you're
           alot more influenced by Major Tom and ME than necros
<Maelcum_> after all, WE MADE ALL YOUR FUCKING SAMPLES!!!
<Maelcum_> what's the big deal about ripping songs anyway?
< Quarex > haha
<Maelcum_> i mean, all these DORKS complain about ripping go and half their
           sample collection is samples that >I< sat around for hours
           making
<Maelcum_> it's true
< Quarex > That's a way of thinking about it. And it's probably accurate.
           But there's still a difference between that and just taking
           someone's song and putting your name on it.
<Maelcum_> like theres these shitty shitty rezonant bassy sounds floating
           around nowadays in alot of things. guess who made them?
< Quarex > It's not as big of a difference as people might think. .
< Quarex > hehe
<Maelcum_> and guess who is the only person that people never credit
           samples from?
< Quarex > you.
<Maelcum_> i've never seen a single person interviewed who said i was an
           influence on their work, or that they thought i was one of the
           best tracker musicians
<Maelcum_> so either i've written alot of shitty songs, or these guys are
           really deaf
< Quarex > I would lean towards the deaf side.
<Maelcum_> i wish people would just come out and say
<Maelcum_> "MAELCUM YOU SUCK!!! YOU'VE WRITTEN TWO THOUSAND REALLY BAD
           SONGS!!!!"
< Quarex > hahaha
< Quarex > But I don't think anyone thinks that. . it's just you get
           overlooked for no reason.
<Maelcum_> instead of acting like i'm some god just so they can improve
           their miniscule chances of getting into KOsmic
<Maelcum_> i mean, PERSONALLY i think i'm a pioneer of this scene
< Quarex > hehe. . and then there's me, I said you did a good remix of one
           of my songs and I get in =)
< Quarex > So it doesn't really help after all.
<Maelcum_> and i'm totally conceited about that, but i mean, BILL GATES
           gets credit for MICROSOFT, why shouldn't I get credit for what i
           did?
< Quarex > There are like 15 of your old mods on my mod CD, and I
           remembered your name easily and then, when I saw you on #trax I
           think last july, I said "hey, that's maelcum, he's been tracking
           for a long time". .
< Quarex > I'm sure everyone's initial reaction is something like that. .
<Maelcum_> i mean, even if their were lots of PC trackers before me, i
           didn't know there were, so i'm kind of like
< Quarex > So perhaps it's just kissing up to the most popular of the moment.
<Maelcum_> a pioneer in my own ignorant world or somethign
< Quarex > well, I know I certainly can't think of any other PC trackers
           before you.
<Maelcum_> people either worship me like some kind of great master (hello
           guys whose shirts i signed at naid =) or treat me like i'm
<Maelcum_> just one of the 96 in epinicion or something
<Maelcum_> i wonder now if i can even get a straight opinion of my music
< Quarex > haha. Well, in any case, the most brilliant people in any field
           usually have a following of people who know their actual skill
           and a great deal who hate them simply because they dare to. . do
           something. I dunno.
< Quarex > Well, I'm sure you could.  I don't lie =)
<Maelcum_> it seems like i either get Future Crew-syndrome, where someone
           likes the worst shit i put out because my name is on it...
< Quarex > hehe
<Maelcum_> or the stuff that i would THINK is my best work, and is
           something really different and special, gets totally overlooked
< Quarex > Which is a main drawback of popularity, your really amazing
           stuff might get treated like anything else, wheras if you have
           no status then putting out something great will stick in
           people's minds.
<Maelcum_> and i mean.. let's be totally honest to everyone: i am NOT that
           good. ask someone who saw me track at naid. i'm a total bullshit
           artists
<Maelcum_> i just hit keys and rearrange notes
< Quarex > but if it gets results, why stop?
<Maelcum_> the only thing i actually know what i'm doing is with drum
           tracks, and i mean who can't figure that out!?
< Quarex > you'd be surprised :)
<Maelcum_> well, aside from ummm
<Maelcum_> can't think of any names but
<Maelcum_> JEEZ GUYS IT'S CALLED A 4/4 BEAT
< Quarex > haha
<Maelcum_> BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM
< Quarex > hehehehe
<Maelcum_> is it THAT hard?
<Maelcum_> i swear, there are people who don't know the difference between
           your bass drum and your snare drum, and that totally amazes me
<Maelcum_> i really respect bill gates
< Quarex > anyone who can make that much money with that kind of product
           deserves kudos
<Maelcum_> i'd like to make kosmic as big as microsoft, but for free
< Quarex > and have the KFMF CyberCity.
<Maelcum_> it's not even like microsoft's products are that bad - everyone
           sits around and says how they suck, but with only a few
           exceptions no one else seems to have come up with anything
           better
< Quarex > yeah. . and dos is still fine as far as I'm concerned. . windows
           is only bad because I don't like clicking on things (yet I like
           fasttracker for some reason, go figure)
<Maelcum_> i mean, if DOS really sucked/sucks so bad, why haven't we all
           been running os/2 for the last what, 4 or 5 years that it's been
           out?
<Maelcum_> i don't like windows 95, because it's like the macintosh, and
           that interface really bites
< Quarex > yep
<Maelcum_> but it's good for people who don't have time to learn an o/s to
           use their computer
< Quarex > and as long as more people use computers, it's better overall.
           Except for the censorship stuff.
<Maelcum_> i don't like unix because it's too damn technical. it's for
           people who have ALL DAY to learn their computer
<Maelcum_> so dos is pretty much perfect
<Maelcum_> the only thing i'd like better than dos for an os would be
           either a talking head, ie max headroom or IBM's talking AI
           experiments, or a DOS with a learning artificial intelligence
           program built in
< Quarex > eeheheh
<Maelcum_> i'm thinking about writing something like the latter.. it's
           really quite simple.. just sits on top of dos and learns your
           habits etc
<Maelcum_> so you can tell it for example
< Quarex > MaelDos
<Maelcum_> Bill's phone is 908-555-5555
<Maelcum_> and it'll record that
<Maelcum_> and you can tell it
<Maelcum_> 'to dial the phone, you tell the modem on Com 2 "atdt number"'
<Maelcum_> and then later i can go to the os
<Maelcum_> 'call bill'
<Maelcum_> and it'll dial his number
<Maelcum_> it's all simply done with lists
< Quarex > so simple, yet effective
<Maelcum_> and it's very easy to do today. unfortunately lately everyone's
           been too concerned with voice and handwriting recognition that
           we've put aside trying to make a computer 'think' on it's own at
           all
< Quarex > And voice & handwriting recognition is basically just going back
           to before computers were around anyway, so what the hell is the
           point?
<Maelcum_> i think we're probably a long way from having a computer that
           can really think, simply because it's not something people want
           too much
<Maelcum_> if we could teach a computer how to learn, it could presumably
           teach itself to recognize handwriting =)
<Maelcum_> or talk, etc.
<Maelcum_> just like a child does
< Quarex > Probably. Shit, I have to get up at 10. . um. . unless you
           really wanted to do the interview, I should be going soon :)
<Maelcum_> wimp =)
< Quarex > makes sense, if a computer could learn then it would also learn
           english and handwriting etc. :)
<Maelcum_> get up at 10 for what?
< Quarex > hehe. . well, getting up at 10 means I have to BE at play
           practice at 10. . so I have to get up even earlier :)
<Maelcum_> play practice?
< Quarex > summer musical baby
<Maelcum_> if it's only play practice, then it's not important. if it were
           REAL practice, it would be important =)
<Maelcum_> isn't 'play practice' kind of an oxymoron? =)
< Quarex > haha. . well fine, I'll stick around a while :)
< Quarex > haha.  I suppose it is :)
<Maelcum_> that's sort of like 'pretend simulation'
<Maelcum_> hehe
< Quarex > "pseudo-faux"
<Maelcum_> hahaha
<Maelcum_> have you seen any good movies lately?
< Quarex > um outbreak was okay
<Maelcum_> yeah i never did get to see that
< Quarex > and the one dude in it looked just like jax from mortal kombat 3
<Maelcum_> i really want to see Johnny Mnemonic. i was reading the
           screenplay in the bookstore today
<Maelcum_> hahaha cool
< Quarex > I've heard mostly that it sucked but some people liked it. .
< Quarex > what do those rec.arts.movies people know, anyway.
<Maelcum_> i suspect i'll like it, but i figured most people would hate it
< Quarex > kinda like me & cabin boy
<Maelcum_> really, i don't know how gibson's BOOKS got so popular, because
           most people don't really like that sort of thing
< Quarex > it's a trendy thing ;>
<Maelcum_> perhaps it's because of people like billy idol, who sit there
           and claim they're inspired by gibson's books, and then admit
           they didn't read the whole thing =)
< Quarex > haha. . cyberpunk
<Maelcum_> cabin boy was pretty cool
<Maelcum_> i loved david letterman's cameo =_)
< Quarex > yeah. . the monkey thing.
<Maelcum_> hehe
<Maelcum_> i heard he's given up smoking cigars now
<Maelcum_> and he only eats one meal a day to keep his weight down!
< Quarex > good for dave
<Maelcum_> that would bite
<Maelcum_> i eat like, 4 meals a day =)
<Maelcum_> what is a quarex anyway?
< Quarex > hmmmmm. . that's like what I do. . I just eat two, but mainly
           cuz I get up at 12 pm half the time, eat lunch, eat dinner at 7
           and then go to sleep about 4 am
< Quarex > it's a creature that's unlucky among females of its species ;>
<Maelcum_> oh, btw what play are you in this summer?
< Quarex > THE SECRET GARDEN!!
< Quarex > WHEEEEEEE!
<Maelcum_> hehehe
<Maelcum_> with YOUR hair?
<Maelcum_> !!
<Maelcum_> =)
< Quarex > hahaha
<Maelcum_> wow
< Quarex > well, ya know, we can like put a bald wig on me and then
           pseudo-faux hair :)
<Maelcum_> haha
<Maelcum_> oh man that's a picture
<Maelcum_> picture
< Quarex > I think I'll load up improces and take all my hair off :>
<Maelcum_> hmm
<Maelcum_> let's start the interview before you do that =)
< Quarex > they hould start off every interview with the question "So, was
           necros YOUR biggest influence?"
< Quarex > hehe
< Quarex > okay
<Maelcum_> i don't have any questions here or anything
<Maelcum_> so it's all adlib
< Quarex > it's probably better that way or something
<Maelcum_> =)
< Quarex > hehe
<Maelcum_> not creative labs crap =)
< Quarex > hahah

(now it sorta really begins)

<Maelcum_> =========================================
<Maelcum_> da quarex innaview
< Quarex > ======================================
<Maelcum_> =========================================
< Quarex > =========
<Maelcum_> haha dork =)
< Quarex > hahaha
<Maelcum_> ok, so dork umm
<Maelcum_> who are you, what groups are you in, and what's your claim to
           fame?
< Quarex > Okay. I'm Quarex. My real name is supposedly Drew Hunt, I'm in
           Kosmic, Epinicion, and TFX, which is my own group that's existed
           since the beginning of time. My claim to fame is, of course,
           PORK.MOD, the most overplayed humourous song in history.
           I also converted the love of my life into an .mtm and she got
           ****+ in o1.

<Maelcum_> ummm how EXACTLY did you convert the love of your life into an
           MTM?

< Quarex > Well, I just kind of sat down one day and started tracking a
           song, then I thought it'd be funny to kill her and shove her
           into my disk drive. Actually, I was thinking of a good name for
           the song, and a friend of mine suggested I name it after someone
           I knew, and her name was the first one that came to my mind. I
           submitted it to CCI with a different title, but that never
           worked out, so I re-released it earlier this year with its
           original title.

<Maelcum_> groovacious.. and so that the listeners know where to get this
           hit... umm, where can we get it?

< Quarex > I think my last defiance musicdisk D-HMTRCH {Hamsterchant} is
           still available on cdrom.com, and the disk includes that song as
           well as many others. Run-on sentence time.

<Maelcum_> there's been alot of namecalling and flame wars in the 'Music
           Scene' lately, along with a big plagarism thing and other
           problems. How do you feel about all the negativity that seems to
           be coming out now?

< Quarex > Oh. Well, although I am guilty of some of this myself, I would
           prefer that everyone just treated other musicians with as much
           respect as they'd want themselves. There are exceptions however,
           such as when nitewynd continually rips songs, comes back, asks
           for forgiveness, then rips more songs. . I'm not sure he
           deserves forgiveness. Muzikman, the other noteworthy case in
           recent months, is almost the same deal. However, if he never
           rips again, I see no reason to continue negative feelings
           towards him. Can't we all just get along? :)

<Maelcum_> hehe, that's a question that's been scoffed at too much lately.
           alot of the more established tracker musicians don't seem too
           'welcoming' towards guys who are just getting started or not
           quite up to some ***** o1/w level of brilliance or whatever.
           i've had alot of problems with this, because i think we should
           never forget that we all sucked really bad at one time or
           another, but on the other hand i don't think groups need to have
           some kind of moronic affirmative action, letting in some less
           talented people just to say they're not biased. some people have
           incidentally accused me of this kind of thing lately, with some
           less known people, including yourself =), joining kosmic. how do
           you deal with, and feel about, the 'lamers', or beginners?

< Quarex > Well, it's a very good question. I think the most obvious answer
           is that, as you pointed out, everyone sucked at one point in
           time. If they didn't (in the words of psibelius, I believe),
           "then they're a prodigy, and what are they doing making .mods in
           the first place?". The affirmative action comment is difficult
           to answer, but not too difficult. I think either some amount of
           skill or originality should have to be shown before admission
           into a group, not just the fact that you're doing your best.
           I'm probably being slightly hypocritical there, but when I
           realized I couldn't write anything awesome, I did pork, and that
           got some results. Now, my OWN talent level is a subject I have
           little difficulty speaking about =). . I've never claimed to be
           able to write music in the same styles as any of the popular
           composers, or at least to do it better, but I think I'm good at
           what I do, which is making avant-garde music, with the
           occasional normal song thrown in for good measure. I think
           that's worth something, and anyone who thinks otherwise is free
           to feel that way. But please, don't claim that people with
           strange ideas have no talent. I don't think anyone is completely
           without talent.

<Maelcum_> Quite true. I think alot of people confuse their own judgement,
           based upon their own musical preferences, with the actual skill
           of composers. There are some guys out there who are really
           talented, but whose music I quite frankly hate. :) If everyone
           wrote the same styles of music as the most popular composers,
           it's pretty safe to say music would go nowhere fast.

<Maelcum_> What kinds of music do you listen to most of the time?

< Quarex > Well, I usually sum up my entire musical library as simply as
           possible. But if I were to be totally honest, I'd say that I
           have about 200 tapes & cds. Among these are roughly 50% metal,
           with a good deal of death metal. I've always been a big
           Michael Jackson fan for some reason, so there's a few mixed in
           as well. I also find myself very partial to They Might Be
           Giants, Weird Al, and Spinal Tap. After you get through all of
           this, most of what's left is stuff like Moody Blues, Urge
           Overkill, or some nice a-ha (I've got three a-ha CDs! Bet you
           didn't know they made more than one!)

< Quarex > This question didn't ask specifically about mods, so I'll wait for that one to mention my mod taste :>

<Maelcum_> hehe, nope, didn't know that about a-ha =) For someone who
           listens to alot of death metal you seem to be a really positive
           person, something that quite frankly is not typical of the metal
           and especially death metal fans i've met. Any particular reason?

< Quarex > I've often wondered about this myself. When people meet me, they
           would never expect that I go home and listen to lyrics about
           ripping people to shreds. I am also not psychologically
           disturbed in any way, which makes it even more peculiar. I think
           the most applicable quote on this would be Justin Broadrick (the
           frontman for Godflesh)'s marvelous saying, "Listening to
           Powerful music makes me feel Powerful". It's not so much a
           hatred or evil thing as it is getting the feeling that I should
           go out and make something of my life. I find the band ManOwaR
           especially inspirational, as all of their songs are either
           totally symbolic for overcoming odds, or actually about going to
           taverns and riding horses all over europe. Also, I was raised in
           what everyone (including myself) considers to be a good home
           environment, so I had no doubts about my outlook. Being positive
           was stressed almost as much as drinking milk :)

<Maelcum_> Who/what are the influences upon your own music? This question
           often gets confused with "Who are your FAVORITE MUSICIANS", but
           that's not what i mean :)

< Quarex > Hehe. I often think about that. My favorite musicians might
           influence me in a way, but my actual inspirations are a
           different group altogether. Whenever I sit down and write metal,
           I'm probably influenced the most by carcass, which is best
           described as a mix between metallica and orchestral music
           (mainly in the fact that carcass actually has real melody).
           However, most of the time I take my inspiration from other
           modwriters, because I don't exactly attempt to write
           realistic-sounding music. My biggest single influences were War
           Pig and Sketch, who basically gave me the groundwork for the
           kind of music I felt like writing. Oddly enough, I was more
           interested in tracking after I heard your song "The Bugz Deal",
           because at the time I thought you were in the actual MTV-band
           The KLF, and that if they could track music like that and then
           do the stuff I heard on the radio, then I could write good stuff
           too :>. . after I really got into mods, I heard gobs of good
           things from lizardking, and it kind of made me change my way of
           thinking about music for a while when I realized stuff that he
           wrote was possible in four channels. :)

< Quarex > when I write lyrics, my biggest influence is every death metal
           band with really pointless lyrics that are the same as most
           other death metal, and I parody them.

<Maelcum_> ok, so NOW, who are you favorite 'tracker-musicians' AND what are
           your favorite tracker songs?

< Quarex > My favorite tracker stuff. Well, my favorite tracker musicians
           are War Pig, Lizardking, Stalker, Capricorn, Ranger Rick
           pre-Defiance, and probably Maelcum, because it's hard not to
           like most of what you put out :). . favorite songs. . hmmmm. .
           Some of my favorite songs are old amiga 4-channelers, like
           Dungeonquest, Labyrint-sfx, Monstrous, Jolie Bedouine, and The
           Last Sun. More recently, though, there have been a few great
           songs. "The Dawn" by Dark Wolf is really standout. So are songs
           like "Crystal Gate" by Ranger Rick, "Persian Starfall" by
           Scirocco, and a couple of Liam the Lemming songs whose names
           escape me now :)

<Maelcum_> Do you play any "real instruments" and/or have you ever been in a band?

< Quarex > I played percussion for my school band for 6 years until I
           finally quit, due to my hatred of marching. I've also dabbled
           quite a bit in keyboards over the years, my drum teacher knew
           that I seemed to enjoy making up melody more than rhythm, so he
           kind of forced me to learn the marimba. I don't really regret
           any of that, because now, although my keyboarding skills are
           pretty poor, I can still play faster than 99% of the people I
           know, which is kind of worthless but fun. I am currently in a
           space-rock band called VUG (with an umlaut over the U), and
           among our first few songs is a cover of the amiga .mod
           "Xenophobe". We create publicity for ourselves by recruiting
           everyone we can find and kicking them out. Nikki Sixx of Motley
           Crue also nearly joined us at one point, but he just had to be a
           spoilsport and say "haha you guys are dumb". :)

<Maelcum_> hahah
<Maelcum_> Hmm...
<Maelcum_> ummmmm
< Quarex > something about my personal life
* Maelcum_ is at a temporary loss of brain
<Maelcum_> hehe
< Quarex > heheh
<Maelcum_> So, tell us about your personal life!

<Maelcum_> Any hobbies?

< Quarex > My personal life began about 16 years ago on a dark & stormy
           night. . oh, okay hobbies. I like reading a lot, fiddling with
           my computer, being a mall rat on occasion, and mostly hanging
           out with as many different social groups as I possibly can. I've
           been in love with my best friend for quite some time now, and it
           sucks :)

<Maelcum_> What kind of books do you like to read?

< Quarex > I got into books for the first time when I was forced to go to
           Arizona (away from my precious Atari 800XL) when I was 8. I was
           handed the chronicles of Narnia, and it kind of snowballed from
           there. I read heavily in the whole AD&D Forgotten realms thing
           for a while, but that eventually got boring, because I read the
           most exciting novels first. I read things like 1984 and Martian
           Dreams once in a while now, anything considered a classic that I
           feel the need to pick up. I was going to read Animal Farm again,
           but I decided that alt.sex.fetish.tim.horton's.donuts was a more
           interesting source of material.

<Maelcum_> phear Tim Horton's muffins at naid too =)
< Quarex > :)

<Maelcum_> Are you entering MC3?

< Quarex > Yes, I am entering MC3. I'm hoping this year they'll just
           discriminate against me based on my music, not who I am ;>

<Maelcum_> hahha i've had that problem before a bit :)

<Maelcum_> So what are your future plans in music?

< Quarex > I'm going to embark on a world tour with my band some day. Or,
           maybe not. But in any case, I'll write mods until I get a
           girlfriend, have my computer blow up, or die. Since none of
           those things are going to happen in the forseeable future, I'll
           be making mods for a long time now :)

<Maelcum_> Don't you think you'll die when you're 80 or 90?

< Quarex > No.  I plan on living forever.

< Quarex > :)

<Maelcum_> ah, i see.

<Maelcum_> Well, lest this become some Freudian nightmare, let us close.
           Here comes the ultimate cliche "Any Last Words?"

< Quarex > WOOOO HOOOOO! Well, I'll just say hi to all the kosmic,
           epinicion, and TFX dudes out there. . that just about covers
           everyone I could possibly want to greet. I guess, since it's
           also cliche, I'll say hi to Necros! ;> And always remember the
           two best quotes I've ever made up:

           "Don't just float through life, throw someone overboard."
                                       &
           "If you don't have anything nice to say about someone, write a book."

<Maelcum_> ... umm, aren't you the only person IN TFX? oh well, nevermind! =)

< Quarex > haha :)

<Maelcum_> =============================================
<Maelcum_> das ende
< Quarex > w00p

< Quarex > wheeeee
<Maelcum_> dork!
< Quarex > that's one big irc log
<Maelcum_> i'll put this in the interview
<Maelcum_> =)
<Maelcum_> are you still logging?
< Quarex > yep
<Maelcum_> heheh
<Maelcum_> this is KEWL!
<Maelcum_> huhuhu huhuhuhu
< Quarex > 29k and still going
<Maelcum_> we can say WHATEVER WE WANT and they have to print it!
<Maelcum_> ahahah
< Quarex > and then another 3k in stuff before the interview
<Maelcum_> ummm
< Quarex > KILL YOUR DOG FOR ODIN
<Maelcum_> PEOPLE ARE STUPID WHO SAY BAYGLE AND PHEAR AND STUFF!
< Quarex > LOOK BOTH WAYS BEFORE HAVING SEX
<Maelcum_> ummm
<Maelcum_> yeah
* Maelcum_ is a celibate
* Quarex will end up being a celibate :)
<Maelcum_> ask not what your porkupine can do for you!
< Quarex > ask what you can do for your porkupine!
<Maelcum_> just stay the fuck away from the porkupine!!!
<Maelcum_> leave wild animals wild
<Maelcum_> and stuff
< Quarex > NO!  PUT THE PORKUPINE!
<Maelcum_> umm, "SAVE THE WHALES"
<Maelcum_> "KILL THE HUMANS"
< Quarex > YEAH!  KILL THE HUMANS!
<Maelcum_> "WHAT ABOUT THE DOGS?"
< Quarex > LET THE DOGS RUN FREE!
<Maelcum_> "KILL THEM TOO, THEY DON'T GET ALONG WITH WHALES"
< Quarex > THE CAMEL STALKS AT MIDNIGHT
<Maelcum_> if humans didn't kill whales, dogs would
< Quarex > If dogs didn't whale humans, . .
<Maelcum_> there'd be like, eskimo dog whale hunters
< Quarex > Shit.  My dad just yelled at me to go to bed :)
<Maelcum_> i mean, not eskimos who hunt dog whales
<Maelcum_> hmm
< Quarex > err.. SUGAR
<Maelcum_> tell him you just woke up
* Quarex quickly goes and censors his speech
< Quarex > oddly enough, I *DID* :)
<Maelcum_> hahahha
< Quarex > "Yeah, I got up and came down here a little while ago. . I'll go
            back to bed soon"
<Maelcum_> that's one from the school of maelcum excuses for staying up all
           night
< Quarex > :)
< Quarex > I can't believe I've only tried that once in these 16 odd years.
<Maelcum_> we should probably end the log now =)
< Quarex > Probably. :)

... and so it ends, and you find yourself slowly drifting away from the
shore in a small wooden boat. The ghosts of Famous Trackers Who Went Before
stand, sit, and lounge around on the dock, which is now fading from view.
Consider yourself lucky, for you have glimpsed the afterworld, but your
time is not yet come. Though if you did not enjoy the trip, you might as
well off yourself now, you boring lamer.

- Maelcum, keeper of lost trax.
