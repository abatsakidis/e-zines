 Welcome to the 29th issue of TraxWeekly.  For your convenience and ours,
 Popcorn's associations with TW have been terminated now and for all time.
 Amen!!!!!!!!!!!$$@#%&U^&#^^#@$^#!#*&

      TraxWeekly features a brand new interview division this week, called
 Faces in the Crowd.  FITC is an outfit within TW which focuses on exposing
 new, developing, and less famous musicians to the music scene public.
 Atlantic, DennisC, Jtown, and Master of Darkness have formed a highly
 comprehensive unit that promises to play a major role in the restructuring
 of TraxWeekly.  They bring with them a world class interview and ratings
 set that brings that special "feel" to TW.

      TraxWeekly is in need of some regular columnists.  If you are a
 writer and wish to join our news staff, please email me.  As always, guest
 contributions are always welcome, and we credit everyone who takes part in
 the shaping of this publication.  Group columns can be submitted by any
 group, regardless of size or status.  Also, we encourage feedback from you,
 the reader!  TraxWeekly will never improve until we know what you desire.

      With that, go and enjoy the newsletter (NOTE: The TraxCulture article
 is slightly excessive.  We apologize for any inconvenience that it may
 cause for you this week.  In the future, we promise to limit the size of
 that section).

--[1. Why Popcorn is Gone]-------------------------------------[Psibelius]--

      I know most of you are in shock right now, reading this issue.  But
 here are the specific reasons why Popcorn is no longer the editor of
 TraxWeekly, and never will be again.

 1. Those lame comments about Island of Reil (ior) in TraxWeekly #28 were
    completely uncalled for.  TraxWeekly was started by Populus, Neurosis,
    and myself for the purpose of concentrating on the music scene and
    music issues, as well as #trax.  It was not meant to be a personal
    message board for lamers like Popcorn to bash on people.

 2. Popcorn assumed the identity of ChuckB, used it to get ops one night,
    and bankicked ShadowH and ior.  Previously, Popcorn had been flooding
    the channel with his numerous bots, and arguing with a number of old and
    respected scene members, kicking them in a fit every time they disagreed
    with him.  This immature and childish behavior is the kind of crap that
    we can't tolerate.  #trax is a forum for discussion and letting people
    discuss their opinions.  Beating down the opposition is nothing short
    of facism.

 3. As one of the majority contributors to TraxWeekly's content each week,
    I really don't appreciate being harassed for articles.  I also don't
    appreciate the fact that my ideas to make TraxWeekly better are often
    ignored.  As a columnist with committments to cover, I don't appreciate
    TraxWeekly being released late every damn week.  I don't think any of
    you readers appreciate that either.

 4. The editor of this newsletter should put some serious committment to its
    content and quality.  As most of you know, Popcorn has done neither.
    Not only does he fail to meet deadlines, he doesn't contribute any major
    substance to the newsletter.  When's the last time we all saw a real,
    creative, article by Popcorn?

      But in any case, TraxWeekly will return to a regular weekly Thursday
 night release from now on.  I have taken over the entire publication and I
 pledge to all of you that we will return to the standard of excellence that
 once made TraxWeekly popular reading material.

                                                 Psibelius [TW]

 This week in TraxCulture, we have an ancient IRC capture dcc'd to me by a
 faithful reader...most of the miscellaneous garbage was deleted to save
 space and make this easier to understand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<_UnderT_> Some prefer ST3, some FT2, neither really sucks.  They're
           different. 

*** necros has changed the topic on channel #trax to ENUFF ABOUT THE STUPID
    ASS IDIOTIC MORONIC FT2/ST3 DEBATE

<b> i just hate it when people say an excuse for not using it is lame.. it's
    an excuse that's good enough for me to not change.. and that's all that
    matters

<Chromatiq> b: oh well.. your pref I guess... sure as hell doesn't hurt my
            eyes... 

<Manson> Let's set this straight: XM is the most advanced format.  S3M is
         not. Scream Tracker 3 has the best editing commands and layouts.
         What St3 dosn't have is about 100 features FT2 has.  Use what you
         like. But remember Ft2 has the best apptitude to create really
         advanced music.  

<GD> i prefer st3 to ft2 and i'll leave it at that :0

<Trifixion> b: I could insult you but I won't :)

<psibelius> manson: really advanced music???

<b> Trif: well i'm sure your just a fabulously witty guy, but i'm not in the
    mood ok

<psibelius> manson: what are you smoking???=)

<claim> lets set this straight! I like butter!

<Trifixion> b: Why thank you...!

<psibelius> It doesn't matter how "advanced" anything is.  If it sucks, it
            sucks!

<karl-foo> manson: sure sure dood... i think some1 had a good point... it's
           not what tracker u use... but how u use it... fool

<_UnderT_> mason: 100 features???  

<karl-foo> claim speaketh

<k8to> claimn: me too.. margerine sucks

<karnaaj> claim : FUCK YOU MAN!! MARGINE FOREVER!!

<Trifixion> It's technology is better, but there interfaces are so vastly
            different, that it'll appeal only to some...

<claim> karnaaj- you stupid foo!!! BUTTER HAS SO 104219 more features than
        margerine!

<k8to> GD: they're much more advanced

<Manson> psi: 16 channels dosn't cut it.. If your doing really advanced shit
         Not saying I can do anything special or anything at all.. but 16
         channels verses 32.. bigger samples.. you can actully play the
         keyboard like a real piano unlike st3.. 

<karnaaj> claim : FUCK YOU!  margerine IS CAPABLE OF MAKING YOUR FOOD
          HIGHTLY ADVANCED!

<_UnderT_> Of course, nobody will ever "win" this type of debate.

<Trifixion> That's the main reason I use FT2 actually..

<neuropsy> 16 channels wtf? =)

<psibelius> Manson: ever heard of something called MIDI? =)

<necros> god damn this is fucking lame
*** necros has left channel #trax

<b> if 16 channels doesn't cut it u need to rethink your way of composing =)

<Trifixion> I didn't use anything else besides FT till FT2 came out...

<neuropsy> my x3r only has 16 W

<_UnderT_> mason: Some people can do stuff in 4 channels that others
           couldn't come close to with 16!

<Trifixion> I think having a built in sampler REALLY encourages more
            original samples, and just plain cleaner samples...

<psibelius> Well shit, multitracker has had 32 channels since 93', WHO HAS
            USED ALL OF IT?

<k8to> UnderT: don't be bringing up the stupid "4tracks are good" argument

<karnaaj> claim : if you'd get ur thumbs out of your ears and back up your
          ass you could listen to me and understand =)

<Manson> UnderT: yes it's also impressive when someone cuts the lawn with
         sissors

<b> Manson: not true.. you can do that with st3 too.. just hit Alt-2 to
    space the notes, and i think Alt-N on each track to put that track into
    multitracking mode, and just play it like a keyboard.

<Manson> UnderT: but imagine what 4 channel people could do with 32

<b> Manson: cutting the lawn with scissors doesn't require talent.

<claim> karnaaj- dude.. so many more people use butter.. so butter is
        obviously better..

<b> Manson: HORRIBLE HORRIBLE comparison.

<karnaaj> claim : i'm sorry, but i'm not a trendy asshole, i don't follow
          the crowd, society WILL NOT MAKE MY DECISOINS FOR ME!

<Manson> b: you gotta admit that cool ft2 keyboard thing is rad when you can
         see what notes you hit..

<k8to> b: it's a rather good comparison.. it's doing somnething a far more
       difficult way that doesn't produce as good a result and it's
       pointless

<_UnderT_> mason: I'm sure 32 could be used in a good way, I'm just saying
           you don't NEED that many to make good songs. cool, this works
           now. =)

<karnaaj> claim : AHY PIDDY DA PHEWL WHO MEZZEZ WIT MEH!

<Manson> Under: it's not what you have, but it's what you do with it..

<Chromatiq> UnderT : why stay limited to certain size channels..

<Trifixion> hell no 32 really isn't needed... But it's nice to have the
            capibility...,

<Manson> Under: but why limit yourself

<Trifixion> I actually think 16 wouldn't be enuff for me in a lot of
            situations tho...,

<b> not so. if that was true all the time, why does 4-channel music rock
    multichannel 9 times out of 10? people go crazy and forget about the
    limitations of the field of sound and what the listener hears.. the
    clearness of a mix is lost in all these cheesy multichannel tunes..
    i'm like "blah, this sucks.. it's so garbled and muddled"

<_UnderT_> Personally, I never need 32 or even 16 channels, if I go that
           far, I'm probably wasting channles, and over-doing the song.  But
           thats just me.

<k8to> b: 1) you're wrong that 4tracks are better

<b> k8to: no i'm right.

<claim> butter has better viscosity.. it has higher resolution.. it support
        more bread formats.. you are just dumb.. 

<k8to> b: 2) 4tracks are all about working really hard to get the music to
       work in 4tracks

<Manson> k8to: what the hell do you know.. You don't track.

<k8to> b: while multitracks are just abnout making the music

<b> k8to: some people are as used to 4channel as they are to 16channel.

<k8to> mason: I've composed a many MED in my day, dorkhead

<Manson> k8to: everyone agrees.. 2 is better than 1.. 16 is better than 4..
         32 is better than 16

<Trifixion> k8to: Yeah, 4tracks hold you back from the actual raw music, and
            make you think about how your going to fit this in there, and
            this in here... It's all very technical, not artistic...

<Manson> k8to: are you sure.. you told me that you were just a fan

<k8to> manson: because I kindn of SUCK

<Manson> k8to: acceptable reason.. ;)

<k8to> manson: and I haven't composed in like 2 years
<k8to> manson: not seriously

<b> k8to: multitracks is about ppl having too much to work with and not
    being able to keep track of it or handle it.

<hadji> 4 tracks teaches impossibility ;) muhaha ;)
<loserbaby> I'm whipping out my SID tunez...I'll show yas! :)pic.  It

<Trifixion> No such thing as too much to work with..
<Trifixion> For the kind of ideas I have in my head, I need more channels...

<b> k8to: i will stick by 4-channels.. for tons of reasons

<Manson> To all you 4 channel lovers: try doing chords with 7 note chords.
         full drum tracks.. full piano that is multi channel.. it just can't
         be done in 4 channel.. Music is not about limitations.. Music
         should have no limitations.. but 4 channels have limitations

<Trifixion> I just can't execute the ideas I have in 4 channel...

<k8to> b: 4tracks exist ONLY becasue the amiga has for channels

<Chromatiq> Bingo Manson

<b> Trifixion: yeah but those huge number of ideas usually end up coming out
    all at once because there's nothing to stop you.. and it's just LAYER
    after LAYER after LAYER.. and you can't follo wit

<Trifixion> Tho I've said that twice now.. oh well, I'm trying to make a
            point... done and it has.

<psibelius> manson: It can be done and it has.

<hadji> *** Topic for #trax: ENUFF ABOUT THE STUPID ASS IDIOTIC MORONIC
        FT2/ST3 DEBATE   

<Manson> you guys can all quote me on that

<b> k8to: i fuckin know that josh, i had an amiga before you did, remember?

<b> Trif: well i'm not into as experimental stuff as you are. that many
    things at once sounds like crap to me.

*** hadji has changed the topic on channel #trax to 4 CHANNELS?!
    FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK DAT!

<neuropsy> ive forced myself to do  channels ... i wanna learn how to do 4
           tracks well then when i move back out to mulktichannel it wont be
           sop cluttered...

<psibelius> Artistic?  YOU WANT ARTISTIC?  Then go get a 120 piece orchestra
            and a recording studio then, damn...

<b> Manson: anything can be done in 4-channels.. not necessarily tracked
    100%.. but you'd be amazed. listen to vinnie's "jammin cindy"

<Trifixion> b: Yep, that's why you like 4 channel so much... I like some 4
            channel, but I think much of it sounds similar...

<Manson> b: I think 32 channels is great. we just need someone talented
         enough to use them.. look at coolio Nine Inch Nails. He uses like
         50+ channels of digital audio.. his music isn't that garbled..

<b> manson: and what do you mean full piano tracks? if u want a perfect
    fifth played, instead of using 2 tracks.. sample a perfect fifth (shrug)

<Trifixion> b: But you gotta draw the line somewhere...

<b> k8to: anything that i would ever want to do could be done in 4 channels.

<Manson> b: true.. but you know how piano parts cross each other out..

<Roland>  manson: he also has considerably better equipment than 386's and
          gusmax with 512k. :)

<Trifixion> Why do it in 4 channel if you have 32 channels available to you?

<psibelius> You could track a song in ONE channel and10 megs of samples with
            ft2.

<_UnderT_> I'm sure some 1MEG+ song with tons of huge samples and 32-tracks
           could sound decent...But that's sorta ridiculous to me...

<b> Manson: i detest NIN.. if he needs 50+ channels to do that, he needs to
    get a life.. i could do any song he ever wrote in 12-16

<Manson> b: it dosn't sound full because the next note is always cutting out
         the previous..

<b> Manson: not so.. you haven't heard enough 4-channel stuff that is worth
    hearing.

-> *b* man, bust it out. =)

<_UnderT_> If you go that far, just start recording huge .WAV files...Then
           of course it isn't tracking anymore.

<Manson> b: yeah.. but most people seem to like his 50+ channels.. his
         music is odd yet it is almost part of mainstream popular culture

<k8to> b: whether the music is good or not is unrelated to how many tracks
       it has.. how much stupidity you have to go through to get to your
       result?
 
<Trifixion> b: Again that's with enuff samples... Who CARES how many tracks
            anyone uses, if it sounds cool to you, fuck it...

<b> Chromatiq: you don't think so eh? hook me up with the sounds he uses.. i
    could track any song he's ever done note for note.
<b> trifixion : WORD.

<Roland> well, a more samples vs. more tracks debate. At least this is newer
         than os debates or tracker debates :)

<Trifixion> I've alwayss thought that, if I like what I'm hearing, HELL if I
            care how it was produced...go. =)

<b> Manson: hey, that's time-sensitive.. people thought Debussy and Ravel
    were weird 100 years ago.. *shrug*i

<Manson> b: you would be able to get the groove.. but not the full effect..
         there is so much hidden stuff.. all the hidden vocal tracks that
         seem to fade in and out..=)

<Trifixion> Undert: Your an old school 4 channel guy, what do you think?

<_UnderT_> None of these 32-track monsters could ever go in a game and
           expect to work on anything less than a Pentium-120!  :>

<b> Manson: it's all random. if he makes any attempt to describe an artistic
    reason for every part of his music, he is bullshitting.. because he has
    little to no idea what he's doing, and that's evident by some of his
    interviews that ask him more tech questinz

<Manson> UnderT: if the game only supported gus it could run on a 386sx16t

<Trifixion> if your doing game music, then you have to start worrying about
            what format, and how many channels, and how many samples, and
            all sorts of shit...

<hadji> I could track three fucking songs in one! and just say "unmute the
        channels to hear the other tracks!" HEY YEAH! THAT'S IT! I'M DOING
        IT!

<b> i don't LIKE really huge layered music. i like music where the mix is
    easily listenable.. i hate straning my ears for things. that's why i
    like really clear acid jazz.

<Manson> b: you like simple yet intelligent music.. like sounds of the 80s..
         :)

<b> i like to hear every part at once in it's entirety, but still in a
    clean,balanced mivet song

<_UnderT_> I think that 8-channels is cool.  It gives you plenty of room,
           and usually doesn't sound muffled.

<Trifixion> I like to be able to listen to a song and hear different things
            every time...

<b> Trif: i don't.. i'm too baked to care usually, and too laid back and
    tired  all the time to want to have to WORK to understand the music
    i'm hearing. i like to chill and that's it.

<Trifixion> I espically love songs where when I'm in different moods I tend
            to hear other things....

<psibelius> I'm deaf, so all this crap you guys are saying doesn't mean
            anything to me.

    Welcome to Faces in The Crowd - Issue 2.

    Faces In The Crowd has returned to it's original roots in traxweekly.
  as you can well see.  This was a decision based on a number of factors
  the biggest of which was distribution.  While the premier issue did get
  good attention, we the staff - along with Psibelius of Traxweekly - 
  felt that it would be more benefitial to add the publication into TW.

    The publication itself will not change, in fact it is almost totally
  separate of TraxWeekly in the sense, that it has it's own unique section
  all to it's own.

    The format will stay the same, with the exception that Jtown will of 
  course be included (as it was his original idea).  We will have as you 
  see now our own news section, along with the interviews, and of course
  the reviews.

    By doing this we hope to bring traxweekly and faces in the crowd the
  exposure they both deserve, and bring them back into being a major
  influence in the scene today.  

    One last note.  You might be thinking it was rather a harsh decision
  last week when we decided to release FITC as a publication on it's own
  rather than doing what we did now.  We felt that the general audience
  of traxweekly were focused more at the top, then perhaps at the bottom.
  But with the obvious events that have happened, and Psibelius' renewed
  determination in making traxweekly what it used to be, we decided to
  take the chance we were wrong.

    Hope you enjoy reading this as much as we enjoy bringing this to 
  you.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

[mdark]     ok so ya ready to rumble?

<smeghead>  yeppo

[mdark]     ok let's get this party started. Introduce yourself... 
            as in your name, affils... how long you been composing, 
            what colour you think the sky really is in your world...
 
<smeghead>  my alias is 'the smeghead', my name is david oranchak, 
            my group is Terraformer, i've been composing for a little 
            over a year now, and there is no sky in my world. 
            just gibbons.

[mdark]     gibbons?

<smeghead>  it's a southasian monkey...

[mdark]     ahh  see. ok. So Terraformer is there some special 
            significance to the group name?

<smeghead>  hmm... i could ask Kiwidog, the founder/coder of Terraformer, 
            but he'd probably just say that it just sounded like a cool 
            name for a group to have. Terraformer, as in Making Worlds :)

[mdark]     so with that respect, is your group a WORLDLY one or do 
            your members all come from the same area?

<smeghead>  all of the members of terraformer, besides me, come from 
            Northern Virginia, here in the goold ol' USA. me, i'm from 
            Fayetteville, NC, so i'm the oddball of the bunch.

[mdark]     I see, so they weren't quite personal friends. How did you 
            get involved with the group anyways?

<smeghead>  i met kiwidog up here at college (Virginia Tech) and he 
            expressed an interest in some tunes i released last summer 
            (Pollution). soon thereafter he asked me to join Terraformer.

[mdark]     And how did you originally start off composing, do you have 
            a musical background such as playing an instrument or do you 
            know any musical theory?

<smeghead>  i used to play guitar, and i still do at times, but i'm not 
            all that good at it. my musical experience consists of me 
            screwing around with an instrument every once in a while.

[mdark]     So would your style be indicative of what you used to learn 
            with the guitar? Your composing style that is...

<smeghead>  my songs do not incorporate music theory at most because i 
            don't believe songs should fit some sort of defined 'theory'. 
            and i don't really think my guitar experience has transferred 
            over to tracking, because it is very very difficult to get a 
            decent guitar sound out of a MOD or S3M or something unless 
            you've got 1000k of pre-made guitar riffs.

[mdark]     that's true of the few guitars I've heard other than big-jim 
            they've been looped samples which other than chords you don't 
            really want in your songs IMHO

<smeghead>  i like tracking for the futuristic sound it usually produces.

[mdark]     so you would categorize your style under what industrial
            techno maybe?

<smeghead>  i would classify my tunes as being my tunes. each song that 
            i make is too damn weird to classify under certain categories. 
            i track 'techno' because it is easy to track. the non-techno 
            ones that i DO track end up sounding strange. i've done a neo-
            classical piece recently, and several mellow tunes, but i don't 
            know. it's usually just stream of consciousness that drives me 
            and screamtracker 3. :)

[mdark]     Smeg_bug I believe. So you DO believe that techno is easier to 
            track than say demo. Why would that be?

<smeghead>  it takes a certain amount of skill to make any sort of techno, 
            because for every good techno tune, there exist 20 that are 
            terrible. demo music requires chord progressions and all that 
            crap. i've given a shot at that sort of thing, but no matter 
            how pleased i may have been with the result, the people who 
            generally like my tunes prefer the techno-ish stuff that i 
            do over the non-techno stuff.

<smeghead>  it's the adrenaline component that people go for, i think.

[mdark]     Well I think that's a good point. the majority of techno out 
            there is pretty mediocre if not reduntantly similar. But I 
            wouldn't call chord progressions and that music theory crap.

<smeghead>  i wouldn't say it was crap, it would say crap as just a 
            blanket term to cover all the things that i don't know about 
            which i should know about or learn some day. :)

<smeghead>  by the way, i use the word 'crap' to equate to the word 
            'stuff'. just to clarify... :)

[mdark]     I understand. But some readers might've taken offense.
            So do you try to incoporate your mood into your songs then?

<smeghead>  sometimes i write mood music. donovan's carnival was a mood 
            piece, as was parliament of eternity. but i like to try and 
            make energetic tunes, because they're easier to make... :)

[mdark]     sure. I guess they don't take so much influence and emotion. 

<smeghead>  influence and emotion have showed up in my tunes before, 
            but usually i track out of sheer boredom. on top of it all, 
            it's just a damn fun thing to be doing.

[mdark]     sheer boredom? So just something to do like a hobby...

<smeghead>  exactly. i do not take myself seriously as a musician. i'm 
            just a big kid with a big toy, and i gotta pass the time 
            somehow. might as well be productive and contribute something 
            to the scene. if people happen to like what i make, then 
            that's great. if not, oh well. ain't no thang. it's just 
            something fun to do on this machine.

[mdark]     THen since you do it for fun basically, do you think that 
            this element has been lost in the scene recently?

[mdark]     The fun element that is.

<smeghead>  in some cases, yes, the fun element is gone because a lot of 
            groups spend so much time trying to show off or blow their 
            own horn, so to speak. but following the scene, i have found 
            that it is still as interesting is it always has been.

[mdark]     Personally I think that's the right view to have

<smeghead>  i like how a lot of demos are being made these days. LOTS of 
            original effects, and more artistic components. people are 
            wising up, i think.

[mdark]     I think there are a lot of people out there that are here for 
            fun. But the majority of people just want to be in it to be 
            known (IMHO), and as I've stated before on occasion this is 
            wrong.  But you haven't mentioned your inspirations :)

<smeghead>  inspirations? hmm... there's just too much... LizardKing, 
            PM, Skaven, Necros, CCCatch, and loads others in the computer 
            realm... there are so many good musicians out there that i 
            draw inspiration from all of 'em.


[mdark]     Ok well I'd like to know what SMEGHEAD himself is trying to 
            get out of the scene... or is it just the same as your 
            influences... for fun?

<smeghead>  it's always nice to get a nice word or two when i release a 
            tune. i'd like to see a decent rating for a change in demonews 
            on the songs i just upped to cdrom.com. course, four guys 
            voting on the songs of the scene ain't exactly a precise 
            measurement.

<smeghead>  but, like i said, it's something to pass time with. if 
            terraformer happens to become super well-known, then it'd be 
            awesome. if they don't, oh well. it's fun either way.

[mdark]     AHh so without me even asking you about that, you have  
            displeasure with this method right? Sorta caters to the 
            'already good' composers. ANd well-known ones. Although they
            seem to be fairly consistent with picking out the really GOOD
            songs and the really 'bad' ones.

<smeghead>  yeah, that method sucks bad. but when they give a song one 
            star, they're 90% of the time right about it. :)

[mdark]     Like I said, true. although I've been on the receiving end of 
            a 1 1/2 :). 
            
            So in closing is there anything you'd like to say about the 
            scene, or about yourself, anything, this is your chance.

<smeghead>  to the scene: keep up the good work. there's a lot of talent, 
            and a lot of ambition. put it to good use. i'd also like to 
            mention that there's a sorta Terraformer ftp site at 
            gremlinx.bevc.blacksburg.va.us. just look for a 'tf' or 
            'terraformer' directory. it isn't up all the time, but give 
            it a shot every once in a while. :)

[mdark]     ok well thanks for your time, I'm sorry we couldn't go more 
            in depth, but we willl definitely have to do this again in 
            a later issue :)

<smeghead>  cool... preciate it.

<smeghead>  take care

[mdark]     ok

     Interviewee:
      {EsperDiv} = Francois-Jean de Brienne /    <> debriefr@dmr.ca
                   Esper Division
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 dennisc> okay:  names and handles (start with the basics)?

 EsperDiv> No handle. Don't want one. Esper Division is the band's name and
           we're two members.

 dennisc> who's in Esper Division?

 EsperDiv> Me (Francois-Jean de Brienne) and Alexandre Jean-Claude. Both
           from Montreal, Canada.

 dennisc> okay...  so, how long have you all been tracking?

 EsperDiv> I've been tracking for 3 years now... None was released on the 
           scene.  We went public with MC3

 dennisc> cool.  have either of you gotten any responses to your work?

 EsperDiv> We do shows. That's the main purpose of Esper Division. We put 
           lyrics on the tracked pieces. I guess, the main response we 
           got from the tracking/demo scene was 11th veteran at MC3!

 dennisc> what styles do you do?

 EsperDiv> We like to call it techno-esoteric or techno-gothic. Sort of
           orchestral stuff with a beat. Music is hard to categorize isn't 
           it?

 dennisc> yep :)
 dennisc> who are your biggest influences?

 EsperDiv> Biggest influence comes from the "outside" world. Bands like 
           Sisters of Mercy, Depeche Mode or Front 242... Got into 
           tracking after hearing skaven's work. It was a cheap alternative 
           to producing good-sounding music.

 dennisc> what do you guys think of north american tracked music quality?

 EsperDiv> I'll get flamed for this :)

 dennisc> go ahead, there's a little Zteel in all of us :>

 EsperDiv> I think that 50% of what's tracked out there basically sucks 
           (and I might just be in that 50%). People get into tracking 
           without any musical background just because it seems easy. 
           But producing something that sounds good, requires more than 
           just learning to use a tracker...

 dennisc> what sorts of "real" music backgrounds do you guys have?

 EsperDiv> 11 years of "forced" violin lessons wich I now can finally enjoy!
 EsperDiv> Not playing the violin mind you. But just composing. Learning 
           music enables you to listen with a more critical and learning 
           approach.

 dennisc> cool...  what do you guys think of #trax?

 EsperDiv> too political. Composing is an art. People turn that into 
           pointless arguments about what style is better or flame the 
           "pagan sample rippers"

 dennisc> if you guys could change one thing about the music scene, what 
          would it be?

 EsperDiv> Not the music, not the scene, not the people. Just maybe a feeling
           of collaboration that can be found in other groups with people who
           share interests... In other words, cut the noise...

 dennisc> what advice do you have for beginning trackers?

 EsperDiv> Eat three times a day and sleep at least 4 hours.

 dennisc> what do you guys consider your strengths? (ie drums, chord progs, 
          etc)?

 EsperDiv> Since I talk on the group's behalf. I'm stronger with melodies, 
           the other one with rythms... We're also very nimble with our 
           bodily appendages.

 dennisc> gee, thanks for adding *that* :)
 dennisc> any other personal info?  ie ages, majors, words to live by, etc?

 EsperDiv> age 26, words: "Informations wants to pay to be free" & "Love is
           allways over in the morning". I've got a brown spot on my left 
           thigh and I'm also married.

 dennisc> whoa... neato.  finally, email addresses?

 EsperDiv> email: debriefr@dmr.ca (me) or alexandre.jean.claude@softimage.com
           (my shadow side)

 dennisc> any other stuff to add/share/shout at the scene?

 EsperDiv> Yes. "MAKE MONEY FAST" really works.
 EsperDiv> I totally dissociate myself with the above-written sentence.
 EsperDiv> Will this ever appear anywhere or are we on candid IRC?

 dennisc> :) it's for FITC...

 EsperDiv> All right. Well it's off to bed we go... Thanx again.

   -===================================================================-  

    This area will be reserved for comments or suggestions about Faces In 
 THe Crowd.  It will either be an article handed in or just a general 
 consensus of things such as this.

    THe biggest suggestion we received last week was to join traxweekly 
 as a whole instead of just the one article from Jtown in TW, and the 
 three separate ones in the publication.  This suggestion came from both 
 the interviewees, and Psibelius.  The main reason for this was due to a 
 lack of publicity of the inaugral FITC publication last week.

    So we have obviously taken the suggestion to heart and engrossed the 
 idea.  We hope and feel that it will only benefit the publication, and 
 the scene as a whole as well.

    As for criticisms,  we have received a few for our reviews section - or 
 really our Suggested Songs Section.  Apparently our opinions are not 
 viewed in the same context as other trackers, which is fine.  But just 
 keep in mind they ARE our opinions and do not reflect the entire scene's 
 views by any stretch of the imagination - much like demonews which has 
 taken a beating as well recently.

    So if you would like to critique a selection intelligently, and 
 thoughtfully by all means email myself or atlantic, or find us on #trax 
 and state your case.

    I brought this up because one unnamed composer lashed out at one of 
 our selections.  The individual in question blurted out while talking 
 with me "I didn't find the song very good at all, in fact if I were to 
 give it a rating it would get AT BEST -**"

    This is the type of thing that IMHO I don't think is necessary in the 
 scene today.  There's nothing wrong with constructive criticism, as many 
 have pointed out but the above comment was not helpful in any way to 
 anybody.

    So please if you have a mature basis for your disagreement, then
 bitch to us about it sensibly.  If not keep it to yourself.

    Once again thank you for your time, and sorry to COMPLAIN back, but I 
 think it's better we commented on this now rather than let it continue.

   -===================================================================-  

        In this section we will suggest some songs available on
 ftp.cdrom.com that might otherwise be ignored or perhaps lost due to 
 the lack of regonition of the composer. 

        Remember these are the sole opinions of the staff of the
 FITC publication and are of course a matter of personal taste.
 Thus we will not actually rate the songs, but suggest the ones
 we think you'd like to hear most.

        We listen to most new music uploads to ftp.cdrom.com.  Keep
 in mind, we can only download as much as time permits.  If you feel
 that your song was worthy of being mentioned in this publication, by
 all means mail one of us and bitch.  We'll justify our selections
 a little, but again, it's primarily personal taste.

  Okay, so we lied about the Unification disk.  The different aspects
 of the group have been way out-of-sync this week.  That, added to the
 fact that our graphician took sick (sigh) meant that it still didn't 
 get out.

  Although our promises are becomming hollow, the disk will be out before
 the next traxweekly, regardless of the circumstances.  Up to this point
 we've been waiting for the graphics and code to pull together, but that's
 outlived its importance.  The music will be released on its own if the 
 other fluffy stuff isn't done.

  Our only new member this week is Nitrous.  He's a tracker with prior
 musical knowledge who is likely to progress quickly.
  
  Again, if you need any help you need not join AIM Higher but 
 simply look for us on #trax or email us and we will be glad to help
 you and listen to your songs.

 Tc, and mail me or Mdark (maz@io.org) with your inquiries or worship.
