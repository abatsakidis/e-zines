Project 0rder FAQ


  Lately less and less people kept ask0ring us the same old shit, they
  like totally made the esteemed KODD write you a fucking FAQ. What,
  are you stupid or something? Read it.


1. What the fuck is this Project 0rder I've never heard fuck all about?

  Project 0rder is a movement started by a group of idiots that have
  decided to highjack an industry term for something most of them ain't
  even a part of. They are 'sick and tired' of the apparent success of
  another group of people they have targeted who are referred to with 
  another media/industry given pointless label. They also think the word 
  "definitory" is real.

     FYI:

     No results found for definitory.

     Did you mean Defiatory (in dictionary) or Definitor 
     (in encyclopedia)?

  They've organised into "cellz" to look cool and start an imaginary war
  about nothing for no reason other than to group bitch something that 
  they appear not to be a part of and barely understand anyway. They
  gots the skillz, just not the brain cellz.


2. Oh Project 0rder, why do you hate <media label #2>? Just because 
   they earn money?

  Despite the fact that this is apparently considered a 'redundant
  question', people keep asking it all the time!? But it's not about
  the money kids; it's about the IT Industry lying to idiots on the 
  internet about the malicious intent of hackers... who totally don't
  go around r00ting <media label #2> and other servers for fun at all.

  The danger isn't real; despite advocating it in this document! 
  Malicious hacking NEVER happens. Hackers are the good guys; 
  believe that, or they'll '0wn j00' - and your friends and family 
  (who are the idiots being warned about hackers by the industry in the 
  first place). They have such p0wer. This is a real threat taken from 
  other Project 0rder materal.


3. Why are you guys against full disclosure?

  'Disclosure is, never the less, a bad thing'. This sentence a) may
  seem like really bad English, and b) like it stands against 
  everything hacking in the media demonised sense was born out of 
  ("Information wants to be free") but it's not k, cos we are el337 
  as fuck!

  That's right...

  'It's not that they [the Industry] care for the regular company[s] 
  that can't afford to hire a decent administrator... They
  want publicity, they want media attention, all this resulting in 
  material benefits...'

  Now I know in Question 2 we said it wasn't about the money. But
  yeah it is. They got some we want some but no one will employ us. 
  Glad we could clear this up in Question 3. And remember d00dz; 
  'knowledge given is power lost. Why giving powerful weapons 
  to the kids all over?'

  For fun? Who knows. Anywayz...

  So in summary; we wantz the moniez, and we wantz the powerz. 
  Because as previously stated, we are el337 as fuck w00t w00t.


4. Real blackhats stay in underground. Why did u come out front?

  Because Kevin Mitnick and the early 90's were there being all
  sexy 'n' shit and we couldn't hold it in any longer.

  No seriously...

  'people think that blackhat equals script kiddie and hacker 
  equals IT security researcher. This is so wrong! Hackers hack!'

  Yeah, and like, hack cannot possibly mean anything other than
  r00ting a system. Seriously; anyone who says otherwise is a n00b.

  And like, I know we said hackers don't hack in Question 2 but
  like... fuck this is all just meaningless rhetoric coming right 
  off tha top of mai head anywayz. Fuck j00.


5. Is Project 0rder visible to us?

  Dudez, if you don't already know, j00 never will.
