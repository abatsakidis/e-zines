ok. issue zero. what the heck is a issue zero good for juke? well, nothing
really. i just wanted to say i'm here and to let you know what is coming in the
future. now you may be ask what is going to happen to lem0n? well, i don't
know. i'm not saying lem0n is dead. it's just that i wanted to do this on my
own. now you may be asking why the heck am i putting out my own zine. well,
today i was reading an old undergrown issue and eerie was talking about how to
fix the "scene." one of his ideas was to do what _you_ like. in other words, do
what is fun for you. it's kind of an egoist view of the scene, but it makes
sense. if people are just doing things to make it seem like everything is cool,
is it everything really cool? not in my opinion.

issue one should be out in late october or early november.
