   .-chemical chocolate issue four-.

    I would first like to apologize for any hype I might have created for this
issue of Chemical Chocolate, because it _was_ going to be a really great issue.
Something came up. Something better. I have decided to stop working on Chemical
Chocolate and dedicate my writing abilities and artistic abilities to `Doomed
to Obscurity Productions' and their future expansion.

    I recently had a nice conversation with Shadow Tao and Kojak that mad me
rethink my position in the #zine community. The conversation I had with them
made me realize the many possibilities there exists with dto. They helped me
realize it's more than a 'zine thing.

    I have had fun with Chemical Chocolate, there is no doubt in my mind about
that. And that is what I set out to do: have fun. So in my mind, Chemical
Chocolate was as successful as it could of ever been.
