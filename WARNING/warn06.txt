I Can't Stop
------------
You infiltrate my inner soul.
Your inside deeper than deep.
Stronger and tied up in me even when I sleep.
I'm free as bird.
No more commands no more voices I've heard.
No more spiritual shackals awareness of my concience.
Think rational, my feelings for you are eternal.
I can't stop loving you!
