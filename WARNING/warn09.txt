Editor Speaks
-------------
We here at Warning Magazine appologize for the 2 issues of the
zine that we missed putting together. Very frantic 2 weeks acctually.
In the 2 weeks I has people email me and ask me why I had not
published those weeks. If your really wanna know why it is cause
I don't have any material. Non of you ever send anything in and I
run out of ideas. So read this issue and be fucking happy. Because
I posted it.

Life
----
Life sucks.
Life sucks.
Life sucks.
Life gets good for a little while.
Life sucks.
Life sucks.
Life gets good for 3 days.
Life sucks.
Life sucks.
Life sucks.
Life just won't go away.

Dreams
------
I love to dream.
I dream of you.
Then dreams suck.
Look what you put me through.
Eat Shit.
Go away.
I dont want to think of you today.
Everything was fine.
You came along.
Now here I am writing this poem.
So all in all.
I love you so much I hate you.
But always remember it's your fault.

People
------
People suck. They really do. I feel sorry for them because they suck
so bad. They are the most miserable thing God ever created. I am a
person, so I was not blessed. I have to live around all this just as you
do. I wouldn't be so depressed if people didn't make me that way. It
is like thats what people are here for is to depress the shit out of
eachother. The water that comes out of the faucet makes me happier
than people. The only people that make me smile are my mom, sister,
and friends. Only the close friends though. Why? Because they are
just like me. They think people are miserable. People=Shit. Thats the
fucking truth. The truth is out there. Fuck off.
