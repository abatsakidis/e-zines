Last Year
-----------
So it's my last year in the horrid prison of Detroit High.
I am very proud I am leaving the go forsaken hell hole soon.
I don't think I could take anymore of all the bull shit.
It's very seriously like living in hell. I hate everyone in
my class except for like 4 or 5 people. The largest amount of
them are rednecks that ride tractors foir fun and fuck goes
for entertainment. Gruesome hell bound little town. I am moving
to Dallas to live amongst people. People with real lives. I am
going to film school to be a producer so I can show my artistic
interest visually. I am currently looking for someone to do some
screenwriting. The best story wins, but it must be a voluntary
script cause I'm a broke bastard.

Descriptions of some of the more common aliens.
-------------------------------------------------
Greys

Most common of the EBE's seen on earth. The standard Gray stands
about 3-4ft tall, generally having a Gray/white complication. Most
notable are the extremely large oval eyes, lack of a nose per say, slit
mouth, and large over sized oval head. Possible reasoning for this
appearance? These traits may be the result of evolutionary development in
their own star system.

Lets explore this possibility for just a moment. Firstly the large black
oval eyes are generally the product of a species being
nocturnal. The blackness of the eyes allows for the absorption of all
available light thus giving the species better nocturnal sight. Second the
eyes are orientated front allowing for stereoscopic vision, thus
generating depth perception so that the alien can see through walls. The 
large head may be a result of the shrinkage of the body but not the brain,
or could be a result of protein deficiency. Thus type of mal-formation 
can be seen extensively throughout the third world. The nose may be a 
result not need the nasal sensory capability anymore, thus the nose 
becomes a vestigial organ and shrinks, same with the mouth and ears. 
Finally the lack of a digestive track, produced through the genetic 
engineering of their bodies to produce a feeding mechanism that requires 
the absorption of protein through the skin.

Reptilians

These Aliens are proportional in size to modern humans. They have a
snake like or lizard appearance. The information about these
creatures varies from source to source. Supposedly they consider Earth
their ancient outpost and want to have complete control over it because
their planet is becoming unable to adequately support life. The Greys are
supposedly subservient to the Reptilians

Nordics

The Nordics are a race of Alien visitors that share common features. They
look very similar to the average human execpt a little taller and heavier.
They are reported, by people who have seen them, to be very muscular
and in excellent physical shape. They derive their name from the
fact that they resemble the Scandinavians.

Many of the encounters that occur with these aliens seem to be pleasant.
People report that the Nordics are here to somehow watch over and help
guide us into a new plane of existence. Others report that the Nordics have
had some kind of conflict with the Greys in the past.
