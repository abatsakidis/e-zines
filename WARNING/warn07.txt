Editors Note
------------
Hey ziners. It's Happy and I am quite happy today. I am extremly
excited about this issue and I really have no reason to be. I guess
it is because I am going to have this one online on Wednesday
like it is suppose to be. I released the last issue late, because of a
lack of material. I finally got some ideas by Sunday. This week I
had some ideas and I guess I will find out if the shit works out or
not from the response by you mutha fuckas. Werd.

A Girl and Her Gun
------------------
OK. This girl brought a gun to school the other day. Her intent was
to kill her ex-boyfriend and the girl he broke up with her for. We
where all eating lunch and all the sudden she runs in the cafeteria
with a 9mm pistol. She runs up to her ex and puts the gun against
his skull. She informs him by saying, "You can either die or take me
back." The guy replies with, "Fuck You Bitch!" The girl speaks again
saying, "Then your gonna die and then I am going to die too." She
pulled the trigger and it went click. The idiot forgot to load the gun.
I bet she feels really stupid, being that she is sitting in a little cell now.
She brought a gun into a no gun and drug area and forgot to load it.
I hope the bitch rots in hell cause she scared the shit out of everyone.
Dumb people are so profound sometimes.

Obey
----
You should obey.
You should bow down.
You should not move.
You will be shot.
The day is hot.
The sun is the cause.
The moon will show bright.
The night will be nice.
I will be lifted.
You will be too.
You will lift me.
I will lift you.
We will have fun.
Hurry and fall sun.

Decapatated Mind
----------------
In my mind I see alot of fairytale things.  I am a dreamer. I dream
of large places with lots of neat stuff. I forget about them quickly.
I wish I could remember them for a longer time, but I cant seem
too. This really scares me. I know the dreams are a reality barried
deep in my mind. I guess I could cut my brain open and look inside.
A decapataed mind. I want to see inside but I cant. I see the dreams
again when I sleep. But I forget them when I awaken. I am really
scared of this. I also dream of other things like Samantha and my
friends, but I can remember those dreams. I remember the falling
dream too. But the dreams I seek to remember the most. I forget.
Help Me!
