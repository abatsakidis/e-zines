Hello this magazine is a public service anouncment! We are currently under great
stress here at the Warning Magazine headquarters and you are to blame! Not you.
YOU! Yeah this is quite pointless I agree but thats the point and you enjoy it so err
don't be a facist and accept what is dished out at you!

Hate
----
I have seen what you have not.
I have seen people starving.
I have seen people dieing.
I have seen people choking.
I have seen smoke and fire.
I have seen explosions.
I have seen the good rot.
I have seen the evil take over.
I have seen what you dont want to see.
I have seen good will turn bad.
I have seen hell on Earth.
I have seen the Omega.
I have seen the future.

If you dont all stop the hate and start to care this is what it is going to come to.
The people of all colors will suffer together and you will then begin to care.
That care wont matter anymore if you have waited to late. The world will end in
disaster and there will be no starting over or repenting. War is in equality to hate.
Murder is also in equality to hate. Don't hate. Osama Bin Laden will get his for the
people he killed God will make shure of it. Do not stoop to his level. Yes you all
want revenge but revenge is not sweet. If you get revenge more innocent lives will be
taken. You can't kill a race just because of one person. Siners always get what they
diserve in the end, but you to are being siners by trying to kill someone. Lives are
taken for a reason. The people in New York had a reason to go. They where called, so 
let fate take it's toll. God is in control.

I have a bear.
--------------
I have bear.
He lives in a tree.
The tree fell.
He broke his neck.
I took him to the hospital.
The doctors ran away.
I tried to fix his neck myself.
The scalple cut his head off.
My bear is dead.

Any paper, ALWAYS free to the informed paper reader.
-----------------------------------------------------

    Every person has the right to the news (whether it's the REAL news, or
not).  With those damn vending machines, it is sometimes hard.  Or should
I say USED to be hard.  I've spent countless hours on public transportation
with nothing to do, but guess the other commuter's names.  Now I always
have something to do, read the censored news, for free (and for a good laugh).
Who wants to pay for a bunch of lies and infatuations on paper?  Not I.  So,
I devised a sure method for obtaining a newspaper from any newspaper vending
machine, at any time.  It's easy, causes NO damage to the vending machine,
and it's easy to go undetected while doing it.

       Materials Needed:
             1) Thin wire coat hanger
             2) Pair of wire snips
             (not too much to ask, huh?)

       Steps:
                                 _
1) So, you got your             / \             2)  With your wire snips,
   coat hanger. The               /                 cut the bottom piece
   only part you           ______/\______           off.  (Refer to dia-
   will need is the      a/______________\a         gram: a=where to cut)
   bottom piece.          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   (underlined with
   a '^')
                  3) Now you have a straight piece of wire
                     roughly 15 or 16 inches long.  You
                     now want to slightly curve this piece
                     of wire.  To make a the perfect curve,
                     put the wire on a basketball (or a
                     soccerball, you have the idea) and
                     bend the wire so it has the same curve
                     of the ball.  If that makes no sense to
                     you, just make a nice even curve in the
                     wire.

  Voila (sp?)!
    You now have a newspaper vending machine opener!!
    To use it is quite simple.  Stick it into the coin
    slot of the newspaper vending machine that has the
    paper you want to get for free.  Stick it in all
    the way.  There is not need to be forcefull, it is
    *very* easy to open.  Wiggle the hanger around until
    you hear the latch open.  Pull the door down, and
    steal as many papers as you like.  Isn't that simple?
    This works on every newspaper vending machine you'll
    come upon.  Just keep jiggling the hanger until it
    pushes the latch open.  It gets easier and quicker
    with practice.  I can open any newspaper vending
    machine in the matter of 4 or 5 seconds.  (Something
    to be proud of, huh? <g>).
