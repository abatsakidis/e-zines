 :Editorial: "The morality of it all..."

  Welcome back Ladies, Gentlemen and Others to the famed and feared pages
of the Discordant Opposition Journal. Right, that's the pleasantries over
with... This release of the DoJ is by far an exception. Digital and Kleptic
went out into the rough world and kicked ass. They gathered huge amounts
of articles and submissions. Thanks Guys for the hard work. But although
I am grateful for our readers who submitted, just remember that we always
need more. This level of interest shouldn't just die off. Send all those 
articles that you want published to discordia@Rue-the-Day.net and we will
be eternally grateful.

  But back to my editorial. Its been awhile coming, but I got control of
the Editors chair once again... [Cue Evil Genius Laugh] Muahahahaha !!!
I just want to put across some ideas on general mentality and morality.
Anyone who dabbles or is interested in the Underground needs to have
some sense of morality. Some guiding beliefs. But I'm not going to rant
on about Ethics and the difference between hackers and crackers, so you
can keep reading...
  Intellectual copyright is the copyright that is placed on something that
is created through the use of the mind and not the hands. A piece of music
that is composed, a book that is written or a painting that is painted
are all protected by intellectual copyright. It is more of a concept then
an actual law just that most courts will recognise it and award in the 
favour of the creator. 
  I've always had very strong believes on the areas of our lives that we
should keep above board. Drinking underage is a little bit of a no-no, a 
very little one. Sex before marriage is only a sin if you bother to believe
some balding fat priest who tells you it is. And punching some guy cause
he slept with your girlfriend is only bad if you slept around behind her
back [If anyone has had such a situation - mail discordia@rue-the-day.net
cause we're bored]. But I'd never condone using forged tickets to get 
into concerts or buying bootleg videos. And recently I was 'given' a CD 
copy of the latest Placebo album from a friend and thought nothing of it. 
But another good friend brought me around and made me wake up to the 
reality of bootleg music. So I binned the CD and have only looked back 
when my other music becomes boring.
  Now I'm not telling you all to throw away all those bootleg tapes you 
have of Metallica concerts where the mike was taped to some fat guys hairy
chest, just that you should think about it first. Unlike a wide selection 
of my friends I am still a capitalist. And to that extent it might seem
that I could accept buying the same thing just cheaper cause its stolen
but instead I feel strongly that what someone creates they own. Never
underestimate the value of something that someone else made simply because
you didn't put in the work.
  That goes for music CDs as well as servers...
  Ah, bollocks. On with the zine.

 :Hacker vs Sysadmin: 
  cronus

  Who is more right? The hacker who is just trying to learn or
the system administrator just trying to keep a server online?
This is the eternal question in the computer underground. Who
is more right and who should be victimised? Should the hacker
still be imprisoned for his curiosity? Should the sysadmin
be protected from the criminals who want to infest their boxs?

Introduction

  The hacker is a computer enthusiast who longs to learn as
much about computers, networks and security as possible. Often
a school or college student, the hacker can't usually pay for
their access and are either using a home PC or a college access
terminal. Learning from experimentation and time online playing.
  The system administrator is a computer professional who has
gone to college. They probably have some sort of degree such as
computer science or network administrating. They spend their 
days in an office working on the system that they administer. 
They are being paid for their effort and have much more advanced
and sophisticated tools at their discretion. 
  And despite the more advanced hardware and software tools that
the sysadmins have, they still get their security tested more
often then not by hackers. 

Explanation

  The hackers inhabit the computer underground and are basicly
hacking for their own gain. I don't mean that they are actually
making a profit from their activities just that they are doing
what they're doing for their own benefit. They are learning and
growing from their experiences and haven't even given any 
thought to the consequences. The side-effects of what they are
doing doesn't even cross their mind until they're so deep into
their hacking that they've already crossed the line.
  The sysadmins inhabit the nine-to-five world of corporate
life. They sit at a desk getting paid for their time. They are 
the ethical ones. The sysadmins sit on the right side of the
law and because of that, aren't shunned in the way hackers are.

Law

  Their is a thin line between legality and illegality when
hacking is talked about. The hacker usually rests just on this
imaginary line. The main problem isn't the fact that they could
cross the line and break the law, the problem rests in that 
most hackers don't know where the line is and when they've 
crossed it.
  For the sysadmin there is no real question of legality. They
always have the law on their side, but to balance they have to
deal with the annoying hackers.
  The main problem with that laws of hacking are that they are
so undefined. Wire fraud has been a problem for banks and all
sort of financial institutions for decades. And because of its
history there are strict laws to handle it. But hacking is a 
very recent phenonomine that has yet to reach the epidemic 
level that requires it to be governed. So far, traditional laws 
have been sufficient to handle the current trickle of hacking 
cases.

Ethics

  Since the law is undefined in this area. The next best thing
is morality and ethics. This isn't an article on ethics, so I
intend to simply explain it from both points if view.
  The hacker must respect the time and effort that the admin 
had put into their system. The hacker has shown their skills
by gaining access, it is not necessary to trash the content of
the server just for kicks. Keeping a backup of any information
that you change and leaving a message for the sysadmin detailing
how you got in and how to plug the hole. These are simply good
basics, the ethics of the whole hack are much more complex. Do
you intend to make any sort of financial gain from the hack ? 
Such as sell the information on the server to a competitor or
sell your skills to the sysadmin to plug the hole. Also should
the hacker deface the webpage on the server simply to 'shout 
out' to their friends ? The ethical answers to these questions
should be no, but as I said this isn't an article on ethics.
  The sysadmin should respect the fact that the hacker also put
time and effort into the hack. And although the server should
be patched and the webpage replaced with the right version, but
assuming the hacker didn't damage the server or steal valuable
information then there is little cause to try and get the hacker
arrested. He did make unneeded work for you, but it was your
job to secure the server and he showed you how to improve your
work. It would be like a customer in a shop offering money back
to the attendant because they were given too much change. Just
showing you the weakness in your work.

Interest

  The original interest is in the learning and experimenting
with computers and networks. The thrill comes later after the
hacker begins to penetrate and intrude into computers that they
shouldn't have access to. 
  For the sysadmin the interest lies in working with computers
and software and learning on a day to day basis. Their is a 
certain thrill in chasing a hacker that has infiltrated your
network. The 'Cuckoo's Egg' is a book written by Cliff Stoll 
that documents his excitement in chasing a hacker that attacked
his network. Although the sysadmin doesn't necessarily have 
to contend with hackers, but when they do they can enjoy the
thrill without the danger of breaking the law. 

Conclusion

  I reckon more hackers will read this then sysadmins, but I
hope that whoever reads this will see the two points of view.
It is important no matter which side your on to consider the
opposition and not to be overly arrogant.

   ... intoxicated with the madness ...

 :Hemp, The Religion:
  RELM

Hemp, The Plant Religion. Five minutes ago I was sitting on IRC thinking of 
what I could write up for DoJ, I went browsing the web and checked out many
links after awhile I was about to give up and say screw it when I clicked a
link and there starring at me from my computer screen was a leaf. Not just 
any leaf, the leaf from the plant that gave our world some edge. This text 
will explain some FAQ's about hemp and maybe some other stuff I just threw 
in.

[What Is Hemp?]
Hemp is the plant called cannabis sativa. There are other plants that are 
called hemp, but cannabis hemp is the most useful of these plants. Hemp is 
a plant that has been used since the dawning of man. Fibre is the most well 
known product, and the word "hemp" can mean the rope or twine which is made 
from the hemp plant, as well as just the stalk of the plant that produced 
it. Cannabis Is mostly known as Marijuana and is widely used by people all 
around the globe.

[Where Did The Word "Marijuana" Come From?]
Marijuana is a Mexican slang term that came about around the 1930's. In 
the U.S hemp (root's, stalk and stems of the cannabis plant) is legal to 
possess. They can't arrest you for wearing hemp clothes or anything. There 
are fines and maybe a jail term sentences If you possess any Marijuana.

[Why was hemp made illegal?]
The United States Department of Agriculture first proposed making paper 
from hemp pulp somewhere around the 1930's. Production had to wait for a 
bit because they had to find a machine to separate the hemp pulp from the 
fibre. In the meantime, a bunch of companies, Dupont chemicals, Hearst 
paper and timber, and some others, came up with a new way to make whiter 
paper out of trees. Just when they had their patents and things worked out, 
someone came up with the hemp "decorticating" machine (which I'm intend 
to replace my computer with...hehe). 
Since the new hemp paper is cheaper to make, this threatened to put all 
of the tree paper making companies out of a job. A huge bit of the 
capital was tied up in producing tree pulp paper. Lots of the tree paper 
people were big guys and had some government connections. One of them even 
owned an entire newspaper chain so who do you think had a better chance? 
The Hearst newspapers played all the angles. Articles were written about 
"axe-murderers" and horrible crimes, of course they did this to scare the 
public about Marijuana and create a downfall for it.

[What Is Marijuana To Me?]
Marijuana is a drug but it isn't a bad one. The media has shaped it to be 
the evil that corrupts our children and destroys our values, but this 
isn't true. Sure Marijuana might impair your ability to function to the 
fullest extent but that's the risk you take in using Marijuana and its not 
that you can't think unless you've been smoking up all day. Hehe...

Well I'm not really sure what else to say. If you have any comment's please
feel free to e-mail me I would like to hear others opinion's on the subject.

Greetz to DEATH and the people at #hackerzlair on DALnet.

 :Hacker vs Nerd:
  Fraggle

  How do You shape Up?

Anyone who's ever had the misfortune to hear me speak on various 
newsgroups knows I have definite opinions of what makes a nerd, 
and what makes a hacker - and that I have a very open animosity 
towards nerds...

This shit's probably been done many times before, but here's my 
attempt at explaining the whole Nerd/Hacker situation. Although 
I'm ashamed to admit it, I was a bit of a nerd at age 13/14. I'm 
reformed now, and have completely lost the "Nerd Rep" amongst my 
peers.

So since I've been to the other side, and am now living on the 
other other-side, I feel I'm pretty qualified to make the 
statements I'm about to make. So here goes...

Nerddomn begins to appear from a very young age. The aversion to 
outside activities, the extremely late bed times, the fact that 
the Commodore 64 in the bedroom had a cooling fan on the power-
supply - all point to a nerd.

Most hackers start out life as a nerd to some degree. In fact the 
junior hacker's bedroom could be very similar to the nerd's - 
except for a few minor differences. If our C64 wielding whipper-
snapper has any hope at all, he (or she, but we'll just say he 
from now on) has to have at least a two hundred disk/tape pirate 
software collection. Sorry, but legitimate C64 software just
doesn't make hacker material.

If we're looking at the development of an older hacker today, then 
he probably even had a measly ZX-81 to play with, or a *gulp* 
MicroBee.

Usually in the later half of grade school, both subjects have 
discovered the world of programming. The Nerd's typical program 
includes simple games and code entered from the eight foot tall 
pile of Your Computer magazines.

Meanwhile, the Hacker is furiously trying to make those three 
fuckin' Commodore Balloons crash into each other and hit the 
ground in a burning wreck. Erm, sorry - sprite programming.

Later, an IBM Compatible PC enters the household. The Nerd drools 
over every inch of the machine, noting all the features that this 
new machine has over the older C64/128. He frowns when the answer 
to "What's inside it?" is "Never you mind", so begins exploring 
all the new and exciting software that's available.

The hacker basically undertakes the same set of actions, only maybe 
with slightly less drooling. And in my experience most hackers don't 
seem to quote system specifications anywhere near the speed that 
nerds do. If you've ever been near an obvious nerd that's said 
"686 PR 200+ with 16 Meg of Ram, a 1.2 gigabyte hard disk drive, 
and a double speed multi session cd-rom drive." then you will know 
what I'm talking about.

The major difference between the two subjects in this area is the 
part about what's inside the new machine. The hacker usually asks 
in a more direct manner "Can I take it apart dad?", and when the 
answer is negative - the hacker gets up at 12:00 midnight to take 
the machine apart anyway.. And starts putting it back together at 
2:00 so as not to get a hiding by 7:00, when Father awakes.

Hopefully not too long after this stage, our pair have managed to 
acquire a Modem, and are entering the world of the bulletin board. 
After several long distance phone calls, the our seemingly forever 
nerd gets a part time job to help pay the enormous phone bill.

On the other side of the coin, our emerging hacker - armed with 
knowledge gained from a BBS - beige box's the holiday house next 
door and spends a lot more time doing important things. Like making
that Point and Shoot colour scheme blacker than it already was.

Interestingly (given the clean and tidy psychological profile of the 
nerd), both specimens at this age will probably be downloading the 
odd meg or seven of pornography.

It is at early to mid high-school age that the two paths start to 
vary vastly. Nerds tend to excel in almost all classes at school, 
particularly science and I've witnessed many un-knowing junior nerds 
actually RUNNING to the computer labs at recess and lunch.

Often hackers are good at schoolwork as well, but more often than 
not they are what are known as "under-achievers". Where nerds are
submissive and interested in learning, the hacker is beginning to 
become questionative and insubordinate. "Where the fuck in adult 
life am I going to use Trigonometry?!?"

Most Hackers will do reasonably at school, but fail many subjects 
because of lack of homework. The odd few will actually hurry and get 
the homework out of the way quickly, to get on with more important 
things - but for most the homework gets filed safely under B for Bin.

At this stage, the Nerd will stay inside frequently. If any sports 
at all are undertaken - they are usually of the Volleyball and Tennis 
variety.

Hackers are more apt to undertake outside activities, unfortunately 
what's commonly known as Anarchy doesn't have the same team building 
effects as regular sporting activities. If any sports are taken up, 
they are usually irregular sports like skating, surfing, BMX and more 
recently Snowboarding. The reason for these activities being chosen 
is usually because of the lack of teamwork, coaches, and the anti-
social image of these sports.

Usually however these take second priority to "logging on".

High School Science class starts to get into full swing. Chemistry, 
Acids and Bases. Give the nerd's table a few hundred pieces of PH 
paper and pyrex dishes full of unmarked materials and it'll keep 
them amused for hours.

The hacker's (and usually a few pure anarchists) table.. A white 
cloud appears from an over-done mixture of unknown materials - 
breaking one of the first rules of chemistry. By the end of first 
class, SOMEONE is tricked into eating copper sulphate (breaking the 
second rule of chemistry) and the fish in the tank at the back of 
the class room are mysteriously floating to the surface... (Breaking 
the first rule of veterinary)

Uh Oh.. The teacher leaves the class room to enter the prep room, 
and the nerds are pocketing bottles of chemicals to take home and 
play with - under the cover of four simultaneous sheet flames from 
the propane taps at the Hacker tables.

By mid to late high school, the clothing has changed differently 
too. Nerds are usually wearing clean and tidy clothes (i don't see 
many nerds wearing shirts and pocket tidy's though), but seem to 
lack severely in personal hygiene.

Hackers are often in one of three states: A dirty clothed punk 
rock look, a clean clothed punk rock look, or the gothic look. 
Another popular hacker style for a while was the Syndicate Wars 
Trenchcoat look.

The Internet's taking off somewhere around here, and BBS's are 
slowly replaced with UseNet - which unfortunately leads to Spam 
Spam and more Spam.

The nerds spend late nights making IRC clones, shell enhancements 
for Windows 95, or finishing homework. The hackers spend late nights 
setting fire to aerosol cans, dumpster diving, or still fleecing the 
neighbour's unsuspecting phone line. If programming, a hacker is 
often found making much better clones of Back Orifice or NetBus. 
Most Hackers are also quite fond of drinking.

It's tragic, but the nerds keep running to the computer room. The 
hacker makes occasional visits - sometimes to do enough homework 
to keep from being expelled, sometimes to test that custom built 
Back Orifice clone on the Quaking nerds. The real hackers frown 
upon those using Back Orifice or any other Trojan they didn't 
write themselves.

Ahh... it's about time to impress the members of the opposite sex. 
The nerds help out any female that needs help with typing up their 
essay. Sure, it sounds like they really like you but it doesn't 
get you anywhere.

The hackers usually make asses of themselves too. Whether it be 
insisting that a quarter litre of butane in your mouth ignited 
really does look cool, or performing (ahem, attempting) stupid 
tricks on above mentioned skateboard - either way, it doesn't get 
them anywhere either. 

Hackers seem to have a slightly higher tendency to score, however,
because they are usually on location when everyone is passing out, 
falling over, and making love to people they'll wish they never 
knew in the morning. And if they're really lucky it'll only be 
because they're not attractive.. If they're unlucky, well.. A few 
of my close friends know the deal there...

Well, what will the future hold for our nerd and for our hacker? Well 
only time will tell, but I know which one I prefer to be..

 :Anti-Racists VS Racists:
  Kleptic

Hi there. I'm Kleptic, here at the DoJ I'm known as "Dr. Klep". I'm 
here to talk about a sensitive subject - "Racism". Racism in some 
peoples lives is a major link in there life, to others its as small 
as a speck of sand.

As a member of the ARA (Anti Racist Action) I take part in many
anti-racist movements. My band plays shows supporting ARA, and we've 
been on a few CD's because of that. Racism is when certain people 
think that their race is the ultimate power, some start groups... 
Most of you have heard of the 'KKK'... a so called - "White Power" 
group... I personally think that the KKK is a waste of time. Why do 
people think that their race is the ultimate power. My Philosophy is 
"The world is like a pack of M&M's... we're all different colours, but 
were the same inside!" 

Recently I interviewed an anti-racist and a racist, here's what they 
said:

================
The Anti Racist
================
** The person I interviewed didn't want me to use his real handle... so he
preferred to be called "Anti-Racist"

<Kleptic> What's your feeling on racists!?

<Anti-Racist> They are narrow-minded fools. They don't see anything beyond
their need for power, and they only way they can fulfil that need is by
putting themselves above someone who is "different"

<Kleptic> How do you feel about the KKK and other racist groups?

<Anti-Racist> They are wrong... bottom line. No single group of people has
the right to call themselves superior to any other group of people.

<Kleptic> What do you try to do to help about with the whole "Anti-Racism"
scene.

<Anti-Racist> I don't do anything. i disagree with their racist views, but
I also don't want get in the middle of it.

<Kleptic> Any other comments?

<Kleptic> Can be anything

<Kleptic> Wanna tell anyone off?

<Anti-Racist> The thing with the KKK and those other groups, they are very
opinionated.

<Kleptic> yep yep

<Anti-Racist> if you get in the middle, you are part of the war.

<Anti-Racist> That's why I stay out of it, wars are dangerous places to
be.


=======================
The KKK Racist Kid
=======================

The racist I interviewed didn't want me to use her real name so I inserted
- "BillBo"

<Kleptic> Why did you join the KKK?

<BillBo> Because my family was in it, and I decided to join as well.

<Kleptic> I see... well, Why do you feel the way you do about other peoples
skin colour?

<BillBo> Because they're freaks! They shouldn't be in our country. WHITE
POWER!!

<Kleptic> How long have you been with the KKK?

<BillBo> Since I was 14, I'm 23 now.

<Kleptic> Have you ever dated anyone of a different skin colour?

<BillBo> Nope, Never!

<Kleptic> If you ever have kids, what if they want to date a person with
another skin colour?

<BillBo> I'll kick them out of my house, and I'll find that n***** and
kill him!

<Kleptic> Any other comments!?

<BillBo> WHITE POWER!

=============================================================================

As you can see the KKK Kid was very ignorant.. I stopped the interview
because she was getting rowdy, and I started arguing with her. 

Racism is bullshit, we should all stop thinking that one skin colour is
better than the other.

==========================================
How Racist And Anti-Racist Do For Support
==========================================

Racism Organisations gain support by marching in parades, and making
public speeches. They use the internet - by making webpages, e-mail lists,
fanzines.. etc.. They go on television shows, such as Talk Shows, and act
like total morons in public!

Anti-Racist groups, are a lot more cooler.. They debate with Racists at
their marches and public speeches.. The ARA (Anti-Racist Action) holds
concerts to support the cause.. They use the money they make at these
concerts to support people hurt or hospitalised by violent acts by KKK
members, or other racist groups.

The ARA (Anti-Racist Action) or the infamous hack group PARA (People
Againts Racist Assholes) which I used to be apart of are probably the more
active groups that are around today. They try there hardest to stop the
hate.

Quote By ARA:  

"ARA INTENDS TO DO THE HARD WORK NECESSARY TO BUILD A STRONG, BROAD
MOVEMENT AGAINST RACISM, SEXISM, ANTI-SEMITISM, HOMOPHOBIA, DISCRIMINATION
AGAINST THE DISABLED, THE OLDEST, THE YOUNGEST, AND THE WEAKEST OF OUR
PEOPLE. WE DEFEND ABORTION RIGHTS AND SUPPORT UNRESTRICTED REPRODUCTIVE
FREEDOM FOR ALL. WE INTEND TO WIN."

 :Distributed Attacks:
  cronus

  Many high profile targets are getting attention from hacking groups.
In past hackers would be individuals that targeted a specific machine
or network. If hackers were involved in groups, the partnership would
more likely involve information swapping and discussion of different
techniques. But modern day 'Tiger Team' groups actually co-ordinate in
probing the system and gather huge amounts of information about the
systems integrity.

  Dozens of hackers working together with a common goal, amassing huge
amounts of data about the target system. Port scans, bandwidth usage
and even network scans. All the information can be later combined to
give a more detailed account of the system. This is the definition of
a distributed attack.

  Using any form of basic encryption, the group can communicate and
co-ordinate. No form of encryption is perfectly secure. But e-mails
that are encrypted with PGP will sufficiently protect anyone's plans
OF network intrusion. These hacking groups can use any form of basic
encryption or alternative communication to hide their intentions. And
since hackers aren't working on any time schedule they can draw out 
the probing process and eradicate the fear of drawing attention to
their work. 

  The timing of any attack can be, and in the past has been, handled
with military precision. By co-ordinating with each other, the hackers
can each probe with a single connection. When each hackers results 
are combined, a more general view of the system starts to become 
clear. And as said before, the whole attack can be drawn out. The 
longer the probing of the server takes, the less likely the admin
will notice. Or the alternative approach could be taken. The whole
process could take place in a matter of hours and be done before 
anyone would have a chance to notice.

  The more spread out the attackers, the more diverse the entries in
the system logs. The main way a system administrator would know that
their system was being probed would be the system logs. The logging
of connections and data transfers is done by default on most systems.
If the probes come from multiple sources, the likely hood of detection
is decreased.

  Because no one hacker is probing the system, the logs would reflect
multiple connections without any seamless thread of consciousness. The
lack of coherent thought in the probing would make detection of the
probe more difficult. Although the mentalities of the individuals
involve in the attack would be based on the common goal. The range of
tactics and ideas to probe the weaknesses of the system will improve
the chances of finding a hole and also help hide the attack.

  Anyone with a server that's online or a network of online machines
needs to be aware of the threat of distributed attacks. I have given
a general outline of the distributed attack. To protect against it
is simply a matter of more directed attention at your system.

 :Overview Of The Linux System:
  RELM

I'm writing this file for all you people who still don't understand Commands,
Files and Directories in the Linux system. This is not a complex file, Its not 
meant to be. Most of you "3|33t" people probably already know all of this 
but I'm writing it anyway (note. This file is intended for the newbie to
help get them to understand a little bit about Linux).

[The Three Common File Types]

User Files: These are your files. You create them and maintain them. User 
files can be anything from simple Text files to large programs.

System Files: These are files that the Linux system uses to run and keep track
of user accounts etc.

Executable Files: Executables are what we know as Programs. If you run an
executable it gives commands to the computer and does whatever it was meant
to do.

[Filenames]

In Linux filenames can be whatever you want, You can have uppercase letters,
lowercase letters, numbers and other characters. Although Linux lets you have
file names that are really long there is a limit of 256 characters in one file
name but I think your friends would think your weird when they goto play
elitekickassdamnfilethatkickstheshitoutofyou.exe.

[Directories]
If you have used winblowz you will most likely already understand how
directories work but for the rest of ya this ones for you!
Directories are like folders, They store and take care of your files.
Say you have one main folder for work (root) and all your other little folders
are in your main folder (sub-directories) so say you want to get that folder
with the files about hamster rape (just an example :] ) Well what you would do
is open your main folder then open the HamsterRape folder. This would change 
if you are root or your a normal user, if your a normal user your main 
directory is probably /home/usrname. 

[The Root Directory]
Well here is a bit on the root directory
The root directory holds all other directories. I like to think root as the
mothership where all the baby ships dock. To access root you must be logged
on as root or have root privileges. / This is root, /lamerprogz This is 
directory "lamerprogz" in root. From root you can access any directory since 
its the bottom of the stack (Think of it as a tree structure) If you are 
hacking a system you are most likely going for root because in root you can
do whatever your evil hart desires... MUUHAHAhaha!!

[The Home directory]
We all like our homes right? Well maybe not so but here it comes anyway.
Your home directory is your little space, You control it and only you can 
access it (and root and maybe those 3|33tz..heh) All your personal files are 
stored there (u know..porno..cracks..toolz) home is home and that's that!

[Basic Commands]
:pwd:
What the hell! Where am I?? To find out where you are type pwd.

:cd:
To change your current directory type cd <directory> 
If you wanna get back to home fast just type cd by itself and you will return
to your home directory.

:ls -l /bin > output:
Use this command to create a file. > means redirect all output to the 
following filename.

:su:
change the user that you currently are.

:kill:
Like it says...If a program is phuckerd then use this command to close the 
program.

:ps:
display all processes running.

:mkdir:
mkdir <name> make a directory

:mv:
mv <source> <destination> move a file.

:cp: 
cp <source> <destination> copy a file  (note. There are wild cards and a hole
bunch of stuff but you will have to learn that somewhere else)

:rm:
rm <filename> remove (delete) a file


[Important Directories In The Linux System]

/
This is root, Holds the actual linux program and sub-directories

/bin
Binaries, Holds basic Linux programs 

/usr
This directory holds many other user-oriented directories

/home
user directory, Holds user files

/usr/bin
Holds user-oriented Linux programs

/usr/spool
Holds files to be printed, This directory also holds other sub-directories
such as mail and uucp

/usr/sbin
Holds admin files

/sbin
Holds system files

/dev
Holds devices

/ect
Holds Linux config files


[The End]
Well that's it for now. Hopefully now you newbies have a basic idea of how to
get around in the Linux system. laterz...

 :Dr. Klep Speaks:
  Kleptic

Hey all.. Welcome to "Dr. Klep Speaks" I'm Kleptic, your illustrious 
writer for that fantastic article in the coolest underground Zine.

For this issue of DKS, were going to be talking about an assortment 
of things, like the Melissa Virus, those lame ass "Zerocool" names 
you see on IRC and more cool stuff!

===================
Table Of Contents
===================
1. The Melissa Virus
2. ZeroCool Or Not Cool!?
3. Anarchy
4. Posers
5. Credits


===================
The Melissa Virus 
===================

Ahhh, yes.. The infamous Melissa Virus. The one virus that is sent
through e-mail as an attachment. All of you have heard of this evil 
new virus. Here's a little update on the virus.

This virus was written by a coder who call's themself;  VicodinES. 
Several mutations of the computer virus have just surfaced.. Clogging 
e-mail system's.  It showed up and spread like the plague through out 
the world.

There haven't been any reports of any real damage. The virus shouldn't
be that deadly if you know how to handle it. Be careful if you get an
attachment with your e-mail's.. Don't really download it unless you
actually know what the download is. This virus can dig into your 
address book and send infected documents to the first 50 addresses.

It works fast.. This virus isn't that dangerous.. its more of a pain in 
the ass.

=======================
ZeroCool Or Not Cool!?
=======================

Ok, Ok.. one thing that pisses me off is those kids that use those 
nicks from the movie "Hackers".  Ya know those names like - "ZeroCool, 
AcidBurn, Lord Nikon, Phantom Phreak.. Etc.."

First of all, the movie was totally fake, second.. Those nicks are 
pretty lame.. And 3rd.. Why do people actually say there the actual 
people, when the nicks were made up by writers that work for MGM 
studio's!

Its Lame! Don't Do IT!

=======================
Anarchy
=======================

This is a short section of this text. I'm just going to answer a few
question's that people have sent me, asking about this subject.

Q: Is there any groups, or organisations that I can get with that 
deals with anarchy?

A: Yes, there iss a group called ALU (Anarchist Liberty Union) go to
http://www.anarchy.org for more info!

Q: Where can I find the anarchist cookbook!?

A: Well, you can order the hard bound version at AMAZON.Com (no 
joke).. or you can go to a search engine, and type in keywords 
"Anarchist Cookbook" and you should get a list of webpages where 
there's mirror sites to it.

Q: Is being an anarchist illegal?

A: It is when you're open about it, and running around all the time 
blowing things up and causing trouble from the shit you learned 
from the Anarchist Cookbook!

========================
Posers   
========================

Posers! Blah! Why do people act like there someone there not! I 
asked a bunch of people and this is what they said:

20% of the people said: They just want to be cool.
30% said:  their mind is filled with shit.

and 50% of the people said:  People pretend to be something that 
they are not to gain acceptance, or to try to impress those that 
they are with. We see this every day here on IRC, it mostly comes 
from low self esteem.

To put it bluntly, Posers need to find out who THEY are.. And 
not who they want to copy! Otherwise they all should be put in a 
big boat, and sailed to the middle of the pacific ocean, and the 
should be sunk!  ;)

========================
Credits
========================

I hoped you enjoyed this text, it's kinda short because I was bored 
and had nothing else to do on my vacation! I would like to thank 
all the DoJ people: cronus, Rue-the-Day, Digital Avatar.. And all 
the people that submit stuff!

Thank You!
And May The Force Be With You!

 :the conclusion - wrapping it all up: 
  cronus

  Well there you have it. We made it to release number five. Of
course if you've read previous issues, the number five is significant
to the whole ethos of Discordianism. But I'm going to let that pass
and leave you all to meditate on the idea of the significant five.

  I'd like to thank again all those that helped this issue. In no
particular order; Relm, Fraggle, Procon, Ethercat, Kleptic, Digital
Avatar and Infinity Matrix. 

  Some news of Discordant campaigns. On the DALnet IRC network
[ irc.dal.net ] we currently inhabit the #doj channel. So if your
about on DALnet, drop by and say hello... The first person to ask
cronus whats the significance of the fivth release gets a special
prize... OWW !!! Also a newsgroup is on the way, but you'd better
ask about that in the IRC channel... I've already said too much !

  Keep those submissions going. We did nicely for this issue. And
I don't want interest to lag. So start writing now. Stories, FAQs,
guides, explainations, poetry and technical texts. Whatever you can
will be accepted. Remember, we're not running a hacking/phreaking
zine but an Underground one. So anything Underground will be at 
least considered.

  Good Night and Bon Voyage,
