 :Editorial: "An anarchist nicked my pen..."

  Well ladies and gentlemen welcome to yet another issue of the Discordant 
Opposition Journal, w00t! Before I got on with the task of telling you how 
truly wonderful the DoJ is and how deserving we are of your interest I have 
a criticism to make of you, the literate public. Where are your submissions 
for the zine? Where are the articles I've been expecting to come flowing 
[trickling?] in? I find the lack of interest disheartening. Come on folks - you 
don't want to dishearten Rue do ya? Send those articles to discordia@Rue-the-Day.net 
and we will all be eternally grateful. Ah, verily 'tis good to be back in the 
editorial saddle.

  Now on to the matter at hand. For those of you new to the DoJ and the 
concept behind it let me enlighten you. We aim to unify the different 
'underground' [or 'alternative' if you don't like the label 'underground'] 
cultures and subcultures of the net in one zine. While it's true that our 
focus is mainly on hacking and related topics we're very interested to hear 
from everyone else out there. So long as you can write coherently and about 
interesting subject matter [or incoherently in an interesting or amusing way] 
chances are we'll put your article in the DoJ and you'll be catapulted to 
stardom! Uhh, umm, something like stardom anyway. As I've said above I've been 
disappointed with the response, come on guys start writing!

  I've learnt a fair number of things since last I wrote an editorial. For a 
start I learnt that vodka, beer, tequila, 'pro-plus' [caffeine] tablets and 
recreational drugs do *not* mix. Heart palpatations and much hilarity ensued I 
can tell you. I've also learnt that lending anything to communo-anarchists and 
expecting it back can be dodgy. I attended a meeting of the 'Worker's Solidarity 
Movement' on Monday, mostly out of curiousity. Shout goes out to Mr. Flood there 
[yes it is a nice url isn't it?] and the person who has my favourite pen [who 
shall remain nameless]. It was an interesting experience and I find it somehow 
comforting to know that solemn political types are meeting in the back room of 
a pun discussing things. Don't you? What else, ah yes, the Placebo concert. Now 
that was an interesting experience, role reversal and all that. This isn't even 
slightly hacking related is it? Ah, bollocks. On with the zine.

   Your friend and mine,

 :Firewall basics: 
  Rue-the-Day

	What exactly is a 'firewall'?

	A firewall is basically a means of implementing a system wide security policy without having to individually configure each computer. A firewall creates a barrier between a 'trusted' [internal] network and an 'untrusted' or 'hostile' [external] one, thus effectively seperating a network from the rest of the internet for security purposes. The most obvious way of protecting a network from external tampering is to isolate it from the outside world. It can be said that the most secure system is one that's in a lead lined bunker with it's own generator and no dial-in modems. Oh yeah, and a guard posted outside the room with an uzi.

	Nice thought but not very practical. Besides, where am I going to find a man with an uzi to sit outside my bedroom? No suggestions please. Really.

	This is where a firewall comes in. A firewall is basically a compromise between security and convenience which is why they aren't always as secure as they could be. In essence a firewall is a computer that acts as a barrier between your network and the internet, it runs special software to keep others from accessing your systems without authorisation. In fact the firewall software doesn't even have to be on a seperate, dedicated computer, it can be on one used for other purposes as well, however this can be less efficient.

	Company employees want access to email, usenet and the web, after all if you had some monotonous job on a computer you'd want to do more with it than type up the company's accounts right? Right? Instead of just taking an all or nothing approach to the net firewalls allow organisations to let the parts of the net they want to be the only ones that can be accessed and to stop most of the rest from accessing them. If you look at what the original word 'firewall' meant then it explains a lot of what firewalls in the computer security sense are about. In the construction industry a firewall is a specially built wall that is resistant to fire damage. If a fire breaks out in a building then this wall helps to restrict the fire to one section of the area limiting potential danger and catastrophe.

	If a hacker should gain access to a LAN [local area network] which is one set of machines then the hope is that he would be unable to access the rest of the company's system through the rest of the firewall. Firewalls are defined by what they allow through and what they deny, it all comes down to restricting the flow of data.

 :supporting kevin mitnick: 
  Rue-the-Day


	This isn't going to be amazingly in depth, I know about attention spans. If you want a more in depth treatmeant of Kevin's perdicament go check out www.giveup.com or www.kevinmitnick.com. So maybe you've read 'Takedown' or flicked through 'Cyberpunk'. This Kevin guy sounds like bad news, why the hell would you be interested in spending your time or money on him? The answer to this question depends largely on how you view life. If you believe that helping others is an end unto itself then there's your reason right there. The 80 or 90% of the hacking scene who are laughing at that right now need a better reason though.

	The most obvious way of appealling to those large numbers of people is through an appeal to their urge for self-preservation. Who will the outcome of the Kevin Mitnick/Lewis de Payne trial affect? You can bet it won't have much impact on 'Joe Citizen', it'll be the hacking community that'll feel the impact of whatever precedents this case sets. New legislation is afoot, internationally binding legislation, that'll make arresting hackers much, much easier. The legislation will make it easier for countries that have agreed to it to charge hackers that have attacked compuer systems in another country. Let's say that you live in France and you attack a NASA server, you'd think it'd be too complicated for anyone from the US to bother trying to come after you right? Wrong, under this new agreement it'll be simple. What's motivating governments to agree to legislation like this? Cases like Kevin's. They can point to Kevin as an example of what they have to protect against. If continued vicitimisation of him is allowed to go unchecked it just makes the government's job that bit easier. Now do you see?

	Let's go back to the two books I mentioned earlier. For a start 'Takedown' is biased, pure and simple. Don't even mention 'Cyberpunk', that thing is a joke, 'factually based' my ass. The authors of both books have vested interests, reasons for wanting to see Kevin in prison. With Shimomura the reasoning is obvious, Kevin embarrassed him. With that fuckwit from the New York Times things get a little more complex. He has no particular moral reason for wanting Kevin in jail, no real aspect of revenge. With him the vested interest is purely financial in nature. Book deals, movie deals, security conferances, etc.

	So perhaps now you're feelings have softened a bit, maybe you see that things aren't all black and white in this case. What can you do? Learn as much as you can about the case. Tell others about it. Join the Mitnick list to find out about recent developments.

 :the adventure shell: 
  Rue-the-Day

	Frightened of the command line? Bored with bash, tired of tcsh? You need a new shell! 
A shell with features. A friendly shell. The 'Adventure Shell'. I've done a bit of research 
into this, it's a subject that I've been curious about since I first heard of it. So what is 
the 'adventure shell'? Basically it's a shell that has a 'text based game' interface, kind of 
like 'Paranoia' or any of those games.. It was originally a hoax, a practical joke pulled on 
gullible users. Eventually it became something of a myth, it does exist though. The myth was 
around for so long that over the years a few people have actually taken the time to write 
versions of adsh. For instance here's what happened when I set /bin/adsh as my shell on my 
'rue' account:

  ph33r login: rue
  Password:

  You are in a directory called "rue".
  To the north is a directory called "home".

  > examine
  Examine what?
  > examine icmplog.c
  I see no icmplog.c here.
  > move /home/rueful
  You are in a directory called "/home/rueful"
  > look

  You are in a directory called "rueful".
  To the north is a directory called "home".

  > alias

  cd      move
  up      north
  q       exit
  quit    exit
  inv     inventory
  inventory     echo "You are carrying:" ;

  >exit

  You died by committing suicide.

  You scored a total of 15 points.


	The above extract is from an older implementation of the Adventure Shell, I'm trying 
to find a more up to date one that actually works, it's not easy. The Adventure Shell can 
supposedly be used as an easier way to use the unix command line for those who don't like 
the impersonalness of csh or even bash. I'm a little skeptical as to whether it could actually 
be used seriously or not myself though. Here's a notification of mail from another version:

  A disembodied voice says: "You have mail."
  You are in /usr/src.
  $ open mailbox
  There are 5 letters here:
    1  from frank dated Feb  2, 1999       about netnews
    2       sally       Feb 14, 1999       Valentine's Day


	Is it all a joke? Nope, the Adventure Shell really does exist, it can be quite 
buggy but it certainly is of some vague interest. Give it a look, at http://kipper.york.ac.uk 
and see what you think. Tune in next time when I begin to find adsh irritating and 'commit 
suicide' some more.

 :ethics, humanity and the future:
  Redvixen

Introduction

I wanted to write an article on ethics, an important subject to me.  However, after starting I realized (very quickly) just how deeply embedded into our values, morality and entire belief system it truly was.

You simply cannot start discussing ethics without ending up on some other subject.  So I decided to just wing it, hopefully I won't loose anyone on the journey.  My main purpose is to examine ethics and morality in a realistic and humanistic sense, slanted of course by my own personal biases.  I like to examine things on a very deep level.  I have a very strong "need to know" how things function.  One of my main passions is the "Human Machine".   The human mind in particular.

Let's start with the basics.

The Human Animal

Humans are predators, always have been, always will be.  It is our nature.  We have all the same instincts as any other predatory animal. And of course, all instinctive needs (shelter, food, finding a mate, breeding, acquiring and defending a territory) translate to one overwhelming urge; to survive.

Everything we do, we do in order to survive.  There is no such thing as a "selfless" human, we are selfish by nature.  We have to be.  We don't do anything unless there is something in it for us personally.  Even acts of charity and kindness we do because it makes us feel good,  is what we believe is right or we just need the tax break.

Humans are social.  This is also survival based.  Because of this we have developed complicated societies with even more complicated social structures, cultures and religions.  This has created some potentially serious problems.

Living in modern cities has removed the need to hunt.  Advances in science and medicine have prolonged our lives.  Technology and Education have expanded our levels of awareness and abilities.  Spirituality has taught us the value of life.  Experience has taught us the futility of war.

We, as a species, find ourselves in a unique position.  We have become too intelligent for our instincts.  That can be a dangerous situation. We spend the majority of our lives attempting to deny our natures.  However, we still act on them.   Hostile corporate takeovers, road rage, gang fights, are basic territorial behaviors.  Jealousies, possessiveness, even what we find attractive in a potential mate, all relate to the need to procreate.

When the needs of a society (any modern-day, industrial culture), outweigh the needs of the individual, individuals tend to feel ineffectual and insignificant.  Everyone needs to feel important and valuable.  Let's face it, most technologically advanced cultures don't nurture the individual.  We are more concerned with the whole.  We forget that the  "whole" is the sum of its parts.  In other words, a society is a collection of individuals, and like the proverbial chain, only as strong as its weakest link.

In our rush to advance ourselves as a society and as a species (our intellectual evolution if you will) we have left the understanding of the individual behind.  We have tried to evolve ourselves into some kind of Borg, hive-mentality.  This is simply impossible; it is not what we are.  It is never what we will be.

Fulfilling our desires to be acknowledged and accepted is so closely linked to our sense of survival, that when these (fundamental needs) are not met we resort to any method possible to have them addressed.  This has caused many of the "socially deviant" behaviors we see in modern societies. Humans crave personal attention, we need to be noticed.  The instinctive fear is that in becoming insignificant, we will be overlooked, and thereby can not survive.

We need to advance, we need to evolve.  However, in doing so we need to remember that no matter how intelligent we may become, we are still animals, with very deep instinctual needs, that must not be forgotten. To ignore the importance of the individual, each distinct and separate individual, is to condemn the entire human race to an inevitable course of self-destruction.

This is humanities paradox.  Only by setting standards of individual conduct,  and adhering to them, can we hope to continue our existence. This is when ethical values become survival.

Ethics and Morality

Ethics is defined as a set of beliefs and/or behaviors based on a code of moral conduct.   Morality is self-defined.  We all have our own innate concepts of right and wrong.  It is independent of Political Affiliation or Religious beliefs.  They both try to "teach" us morality, but we still each pick and choose which "laws" we will follow.   Breaking the ones we disagree with and justifying that action.

This works as long as we are responsible and accepting of the consequences. Sadly, this is not always the case.  The majority of humans are woefully shortsighted.  Either they choose not to consider the outcome or they simply ignore it.  Many people live so far inside of themselves that they can't see past their noses.

It is a case of reverse development.  Humans are born into a world where their only awareness is of themselves.  All they know is their own level of comfort.  As we grow we gradually become aware of things outside of ourselves.  This awareness expands until such time as we realize our own individual vulnerableness.  We then start to withdraw again in order to protect ourselves.  Our survival instinct is at work again.  The more we allow ourselves to be victimized, the deeper into ourselves we retreat, until we are trapped.

Yes, I said allowed.  We choose what we feel.  We choose how we will react to a situation.  We are only powerless if we perceive ourselves to be.  The more powerless we feel the more "preemptive" we become.  Get them before they get you. This is what is destroying our societies and in fact our entire species.

We have to recognize the fact that we need each other to survive.  We are nothing alone.  In order to do that we need to learn respect, true respect.  Respect born of an innate understanding of each other not born of envy, fear or greed.  This means we need to learn to live "outside" of ourselves again.  We need to consider the effects of everything we do, and be willing to accept the consequences, whatever they might be.

How does all of this relate to hacking specifically?

Why do Hackers hack?

The Idealists will tell you that a true hacker never harms a system, they are there purely to be informed.  The more romantic types see themselves as the shining white knights of cyberspace, keeping information free and available to all.  That's all well and good, in an ideal world, but personally I believe that sort of thinking is delusional.

Let's equate it with hunting.   I have been given dozens of personal reasons why people hunted, none of which I considered to be valid.  Unless you are a Bushman on the Serengeti, you are going to have a hard time convincing me.  In all the conversations I have had with hunters, I have had only one tell me what I consider to be the truth.  His simple reply;  "I hunt, because I am a predator, and I enjoy killing".

Hackers hack, because it is the game of the century.  They do it for the same reason that the hunter hunts.  Because they get that same rush of superiority and power when they infiltrate a system that a hunter gets when he brings down a bear.  The tougher the prey; the bigger the rush.  It's the ultimate power trip.  Why power trip?  Because it makes us feel less insignificant and vulnerable.  It feeds our instincts to survive.  It makes us feel more important and safe.  How do ethics come into play?

It's simple, whenever someone breaks a law (whether it's a legal or a moral law), there is a price to be paid.  This is not only a rule of mankind, it is a universal rule.  Cause and effect.  For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.  The lawbreaker is not always the one to pay that price however.  Whether or not they consider that possibility is a question of ethics.

Whenever you break into a system, you run the risk of damaging it.  Whether that is your intention or not.  Skill is not an issue, there are simply too many variables to be able to anticipate and deal with all of them.  It is a fair assumption that your presence will be detected on some level.  Even if the powers that be don't have the resources, skill or even just the desire to pursue you, there will be a record somewhere that you were there.  There will also be a sys admin that has to deal with it.  At the very least it's cost him/her unnecessary time, and at the most a job.  What if this same sys admin (this faceless person who is so easy to ignore), has a family that they were supporting?.  How many people are paying your price then?  We don't want to think along these lines.  So most of us don't.

We don't like secrets, unless they are our secrets.  Our secrets keep us safe (or so we think).  It's all those other secrets that are dangerous...they introduce an unknown element.  We can't protect ourselves against the unknown.  We rally against our governments (the Uber secret keepers).  Our governments justify themselves in the name of national security.  We justify ourselves in the name of freedom (and privacy).  We all become more and more introverted in the name of survival.

Where does it end?

Conclusion

I think the first step to being responsible for our actions is understanding them.  Knowing why we do what we do.  That is the purpose of this article.  To perhaps get you thinking in directions you were not before. It is not designed to condemn or to judge, only to expand awareness.  Personally I don't hack systems, the human mind is, for me, a much greater challenge.  Ethics and morality are big issues for me.  I know beyond any doubt that *my* survival depends on there being a world here tomorrow, and that depends on us all not self-destructing today.  That means we need to stop doing acts of destruction, no matter how innocent we choose to view those acts.

We need to grow up (as a species).  We need to face the facts that there are prices to be paid, and that we are the ones who need to pay them.  We need to respect each other.  I can not emphasize this enough.

Regarding hacking and ethics, it really all boils down to this; at what point did your right to know become more important than my right to privacy?

 :the broadcast attack:
  cronus

Why Indeed?

  The Boardcast attack is an attack that comes from the Denial of
Service genre. I hear all your cries of 'No cronus, DoS is so bad'
but to be frank I amn't listening. So lets move on swiftly...

The What Attack?

  Broadcast. Broadcast. The attack is specially suited to taking
down servers or even networks. It involves the creation of spoofed
ICMP echo packets, or ping packets, with the spoofed source address
of the target. Sending our say 10 such packets to different networks
with the same spoofed source address will yeild dozens or possibly
even hundreds of ICMP echo reply packets. This mass flood of packets
can be enough to severly lag a server or take it offline.

Explain!

  Point and click example; 
  Imagine a harmless intermediary network of 100 hosts. The attacker
is conveniently sitting on a T1 connection. The attack begins by the
sending of a 768kb/s stream of ICMP echo (ping) packets, with the 
source address of the target, to the harmless network. All the ping
packets hit the intermediary's broadcast network of 100 hosts and each
of them responds individually to the packets. The effect is 1 packet
in and 100 out. Multiply this by the possible ammount of bandwidth, 
76.8 Mbps of out-bound traffic is created. All this traffic is sent 
to the target's address that was spoofed.

Oh My God!

  Fear not, there are some online tools to test your network for the
afore mentioned flaw;

http://www.netscan.org/ is a site that actively scans networks and mails
the administrators when a vulnerability is found.

http://www.powertech.no/smurf/ is a site which will test scan your
network and allow you to enter a known smurf amplifier site.

  Hosts can, under certain circumstances, be patched to refuse to
respond to broadcasted ICMP echo packets. RFC 1122, "Requirements for 
Internet Hosts -- Communications Layer", Section 3.2.2.6, states: 

   An ICMP Echo Request destined to an IP broadcast or IP
   multicast address MAY be silently discarded.

  The lack of a solid decision on the topic is based on the ongoing
debate between those who feel the ICMP echo is a valuable network
administration toold and those who feel that the misuse can be an
easy source of packet storms.
  Since the debate rages on, most IP stack implementors have chosen,
wisely in the authour's opinion, to reply by default to ICMP echo
packets. It is possible as mentioned above to silently disregard all
ICMP echo packets received and patchs to acheive this have been around
for awhile. Unfortunatly some services may require the full range of 
broadcast capabilities. Check before disabling the option.

That It?

  Yes that is it. I don't intend to supply source code, technical 
specifications or anything that would actually allow you to carry out
such a broadcast attack. Just the thought that it is remarkably easy
and should be consider a major worry.

 :the principals of discordia:
  cronus

  Discordianism is the religion of the 90s and the anti-religion
of the 21st century. As Pope Icky once said; 

   Is it a religion for the 90s? A joke for the religious? Or just
   a lot of fun? Who knows, who cares, why bother? Here's a phone 
   card, call someone who gives a shit. 

  Discordianism offers you the ability to lead a morally and also
ethically correct live without the downsides. When thinking of what
Discordia might offer you, first think of what it doesn't offer you.
It doesn't offer Eternal Damnation! Also not in it is Guilt! Or 
Death! Okay, maybe you WILL die, but your memory will live on in your 
Wholly Writings, which can only be inspired by Eris! Eris, who 
inspired the Principia Discordia, the Bible, the Koran, the Talmud, 
and the Tasteless Jokes series! 
  Eris was the greek goddess of Chaos. Daughter of Zeus and sister of
Nyx the goddess of Night. All Discordian ethos and powers are derived
from Eris, the goddess of Chaos.
  Discordians can envision the Law of Fives in all aspects of life and
death. The Law of Fives states simply that: All things happen in Fives,
or are divisible by or are multiples of Five, or are somehow directly 
or indirectly appropriate to 5. 
      The Law of Fives has been shown never to be wrong. In the ERISian
Archives, an old memo from Omar to Mal-2 says; "I find the Law of Fives 
to be more and more manifest the harder I look." Also since 2+3=5 the 
number 23 is seen to be the most discordant number and recognised as
such.
   Discordianism is based on the Prinicipia. The Principia Discordia is 
the soda fountain from which the ERISian Movement flows like Pure 
Coca-Cola Syrup, bringing unto mankind the giggling, unblinking, caffeine
and sugar mania that is Discordianism. It was written by Malaclypse the 
Younger and Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst. Both respecable leaders of 
Discordanism.
  Discordians are split in the Wholly 5 Orders. The seeds of the ORDERS 
OF DISCORDIA were planted by Greyface into his early disciples. The Orders 
are composed of persons who are all in positions of authority, security 
and control. Some do not know that they belong to Orders of Discordia. But 
we know;
      1. The Military Order of THE KNIGHTS OF THE FIVE SIDED TEMPLE. This 
is for all the soldiers and bureaucrats of the world. 
      2. The Political Order of THE PARTY FOR WAR ON EVIL. This is reserved 
for lawmakers, censors, and like ilk. 
      3. The Academic Order of THE HEMLOCK FELLOWSHIP. They commonly inhabit 
schools and universities, and dominate many of them. 
      4. The Social Order of THE CITIZENS COMMITTEE FOR CONCERNED CITIZENS. 
This is mostly a grass-roots version of the more professional military, 
political, academic and sacred Orders. 
      5. The Sacred Order of THE DEFAMATION LEAGUE. Not much is known about 
the D.L., but they are very ancient and quite possibly were founded by 
Greyface himself. It is known that they now have absolute domination over
all organized churches in the world. It is also believed that they have 
been costuming cabbages and passing them off as human beings. 
     
  Joining Discordia is a simply 5 step process. Make five copies of your 
application form stating you full personal details, any sexual fetishes and 
your intentions within the sacred temple of Eris. Place one copy under your
post box. Burn one copy and scatter the ashes throughout the parish you wish
to rule. Flush one copy down your toilet to show that you can be humble and
remain the true Discordian. Finely chop one copy and mix it into a Hashish
cake. Eat the Hashish cake to prove your devotion to the cause, if you are
unable to obtain Hashish for the baking of your cake common garden dirt is
the best substitute. Then finally give your last copy to someone who doesn't
care to show that you are willing to indoctrinate others.

  Cronus (AKA Saint Cronus the Sex-Offender of Discordia) and Rue-the-Day 
(AKA Pope Rue the Blonded One of Discordia) are happy to answer questions 
about Discordianism As if this file has cleared it all up for you.

TABLE OF CONTENTS:

1. INTRO
2. VIEWS ON THE GOV'T
3. TRASH TALK SHOWS
4. Y2K BUG
5. SUB-CULTURES
6. MUSIC
7. CREDITS
8. FOR MORE INFO


=======================
INTRO
=======================

Hey all, Im Kleptic also known as Dr. Klep. My Column in the previous
issues of DoJ has been really popular, and Im suprised of how popular it
gotten for just a couple of paragraphs of "What Im Thinking About". But no
one sends me questions, just comments.. so in turn, "ADK" (ask dr. klep)
is finished, Now I renamed this - "Dr. Klep Speaks".. I talk about Issues
that are going on in the world, and how I feel about these certain issues.
Its not much of a change from what "ADK" was, actually its about the same
thing, so theres no need to worry.

======================
Views On The Gov't
======================

Many people have commented on how I feel about government. Most of you
have garbled up what I said. I Dont like the US Gov't, I really dislike
it. It's other governments around the world that I would rather have. I
like it that we can vote on almost anything. But the prez is the one
veto'ing the bills not us. Just a little something to think about.

======================
Trash Talk Shows
======================

Trash talkshows, very 'fun' right!? I got some emails asking me if I
thought they were fake. Well, Ive done my research and On Jerry Springer,
the only "FAKE" guests on that show were actual actors who wanted to make
a "skit" that actually portraid them as "White Trash". And after there
secret got out the Jerry Springer show sued them for a hell of a lot of
money.

======================
Y2K Bug
======================

Y2K.... some people asked me what im doing to save my comp from the
infamous "Y2K Bug".. im not really doing anything.. I have a win98 machine
which is Y2K compatable.. so Im a-ok.. although I havent really been
paying attention to what Microsoft or any other computer company is doing
about this bug. But im sure it will get taken care of.  And I dont think
that the whole world is going to end if it doesnt. The Lights will
probably go out for a couple of days, until everything gets fixed. And for
all you INTERNET Junkies, You will probably still be able to go on the
net, the only thing that will be different is the date on you comp. and
you will probably lose a little bit of info every time you turn on your
computer, but you probably wont notice it!

======================
Sub-Cultures
======================

Subcultures... There are a lot of 'sub-cultures'. Every country has its
sub-cultures.  UK has its 'punks', Ya know.. the kids that dress like
skateboarders, have a few peircings, big pants, maybe a different hair
color, with messed up hair. USA has its 'hardcore-kids or straight-edge
kids' they where big ass pants, peircings up the ying-yang.. tattoos
everywhere.. they listen to hardcore/punk music.. and straightedge kids
where big/bold/black X's on thier hands. sXe (straightedge) kids dont
drink, smoke, or have promiscious sex. Some are vegan/vegitarian.. or dont
eat meat. There has always been sub-cultures - flappers in the 20's,
beatniks in the 40/50's, in the 60/70's there was hippies in the the late
60's 70/80/90's there were punks. the 90's there was Goth, hardcore,
straightedge, rude boi/grrls.. etc..
There will always be subcultures.. subcultures want to be different they
try to express them selves in different ways, and there usually really
nice people.. theres a few sub-sub-cultures that I know about.. like about
the STRAIGHTEDGE subculture.. theres another subculture that branches off
of that called - "HARDLINE or H8-Edge" Those guys are generally assholes,
and either beat you up or try to kill you for drinking or smoking.. there
more like a DRUG-FREE military. Dont ever get STRAIGHT EDGE or HARDLINE
mixed up.. there totally different things.. Straight Edge kids are
generally nice people.. HARDLINERS are hardcore fuck-ups..

======================
Music
======================

Music!? Its weird, how many email's I get about what Music modivates me.
Well, I listen to alot of hardcore & punk.. Like these bands for example:

Trephine, AsHeroesDie, Hardtime, Day Of Mourning, Dead To The World, Sour
Nation, Angermeans, Snapcase, Apathemy, Buried Alive, Warzone, OS101,
Madball, H20, Sick Of It All, All Out War, Earth Crisis, Harvest, One King
Down, Subsist, Earthmover, Againts All Athourity, Suicide Machines, Minor
Threat, Gorilla Bisquits, Fugazi, NoFX, MxPx, Hatebreed, Blood For Blood,
Deadguy, Shelter, Shutdown, (older) Metallica, (older) Sepultra, Slayer,
One Innocent Victom, Damnation-AD, Refused, Strife, Korn, Limp Bizkit,
Beastie Boys, Eminem (detroit rap).. and a bunch of other bands..

Those are the bands that you would probably find in my CD player right
now... Thats the stuff that modivates me.

======================
Credits
======================

Well, I hope you enjoyed my little Text full of what im thinking.. Now I
would like to give some people some credit..

All the guys at DoJ - Rue-the-Day, cronus, DigitalAvatar.. all the guys in
the computer underground - Ledge, Biosone, Bedlam, darkworm, firetrack,
The_Guru, Dredd, The_Ravager.. and anyone else i missed.. 

all the bands that the 2 bands that im in has played with - Hardtime,
Trephine, Buried Alive, Hardtime, Dead To The World, Walls Of Jericho,

   2600 - Teaching the World to Hack

	Cronus says: "Myself and Rue have, as I see it, far too much
time on our hands. Idle hands, devil's work - isn't there a phrase that
has something to do with that? Anyway, the story goes something along
the lines that it was a sunday afternoon and we were bored. We drop into
#2600 on Dalnet and gosh, there is a net split. We quickly gain ops and
basically the rest should be obvious."

 :the conclusion - wrapping it all up: 
  Rue-the-Day

 You've laughed, you've cried, you've been confused. Another issue of the Discordant Opposition Journal draws to a close and it falls to me to wrap it all up. We've covered a lot in this issue, everything from civil rights ["supporting Kevin Mitnick"] to Unix trivia ["the Adventure Shell"] with computer security as well of course. What did you think of this issue? What do you want to see more of? What do you want to see changed? Drop us an email with your comments, criticisms and suggestions, we're always glad to hear from the viewing public. As always our email address is discordia@Rue-the-Day.net please take the time to respond. Another way that you can help out is to link to our distribution site http://www.Rue-the-Day.net/discordia and send us an email telling us, then we'll link to you and everyone'll be happy. If you yourself are running an underground zine get in touch with us and we can discuss some mutual advertising.

 After all that shameless self-promotion let's get on to a more serious topic. Ethics. Persoanlly I believe that having some sort of ethical code is the only thing that seperates us from being the criminals that we're labeled as by the media.
