Editorial - Welcome to the new subscribers and our new reporter 
-----------
Give a big Hello to our new reporter, Andy Hartwell(phatso@world2u.com).
He did a review on Battle City this issue and we will be seeing more of
his reviews in the future.

We broke our record! 
NINETEEN multiplayer games reported on in the
Online Games section!

Yup, More Quake reporting this issue (in the gaming news section). 

This weeks' editorial actually will be just a administrative clearing
house. So here we go...

First, Let me say Welcome Aboard to all the hundred plus new subscribers
we gathered in the last two weeks!  That brings our subscriber count to
something like six hundred.  That's the unofficial majordomo subscriber
count. If you count the newsletter distribution on various B.B.S.,
company intranets, Public School intranets, and who else knows where 
this newsletter ends up, we are probably close to eight hundred readers.
I am still shooting for an official majordomo count of one thousand
subscribers by year end. You can help. Spread the word and this newsletter
everywhere you can!

For you subscribers new to FreePlay:
you definitely need to go the WWW page and download the older issues to
catch up on games we already reported on.  
With all the NEW stuff showing up, I rarely report twice on a
multiplayer game in this newsletter(except by mistake). If there is a
significant change for a game or a WWW page,  
it will be reported in the update section.

NETCOM subscribers! CLEAN OUT YOUR MAILBOX! I got twenty five MAILBOX
FULL messages from NETCOM subscribers after distributing the last issue.
The majordomo is attempting to resend to those subscribers.

Picking Bones - I got a bone to pick with you WWW game page owners. Provide
a plain alternate page when you put up those FRAME, TABLE, JAVA heavy
pages. 
YOU ARE LOCKING OUT FORTY FOUR PERCENT OF ALL INTERNET USERS
from seeing your web page..
Email IS the killer app of the Internet and 44% of all internet users
have Email only access.
This may surprise you but I DO NOT SURF the World Wide Web looking for
games. That is the absolutely last alternative. It takes too dam long to
load those pages! I use EMAIL, EMAIL, EMAIL. I use EMAIL to search the
search engines, download WWW pages, get reports from various sites, and
yes, to even download software! And I have a full PPP 28.8 connection.
But, thats how I do it and thats how I find just about everything for
this newsletter in the most efficient, non-distracting way.
The resources I use to get WWW pages and view them (text only) can't
download FRAME ONLY, MAP ONLY, WWW Pages by Email.
Which means I don't report on your page or game no matter how  pretty it
looks or how great the content is.

Oh and one last clarifcation:
If a game is noted as playable over  IPX or a LAN that means it
is capable of play over KALI on the internet.
************************************************************************

Announcement
-------------------
I am reworking the FreePlay WWW page. I need a new logo!
My html abilities suck as it is, but I can't even draw a straight
line with a computer!
If you have any graphic talents, design a FreePlay logo (GIF or JPG), 
and ship it to me at freeplay@snet.net
If I end up with more than one decent graphic, I will cycle through
them on the WWW page.
Go wild, crazy, weird, and wacky. It must be eye-catching as
possible.
Make it as fancy as you want, whatever size. I will resize it if
I need to fit into the WWW page
All I can give you is my utmost thanks and a credit for
the design on the WWW page and in the newsletter.

If your talents are in html WWW authoring, We need to talk.
If you have any ideas or could put something together, send
them to me! I simply don't have the time or the talent to do it
well or do it right.

Again, due to my limited finances, I can't afford to pay, but we
could work out other arrangements,copyrights, whatever....

Rambling On - By Scott Grattan(scotti@wic.net)
----------------
Well, another two weeks has passed, and I'm caught completely 
unprepared again. Maybe if I'd spend more time paying attention, 
and less time playing games, I'd have more  to report. Hmmmm....
Anyway, here's what I DO know:

Subspace
http://www.vie.com/subspace
------------------------------------
Another version was released on 11/1/96!  v1.17 is here, 
and it's got some minor improvements.
Mostly cosmetic.   

PBeM Games
http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/pbem_magazine.html
---------------------------------------------------------------
For those of you who have no idea, PBeM means Play By Email, and this
site is the place to go to find out more about them.  It also has
several links to sign up for the many games available, but as of yet I
haven't been able to get into one, due to time constraints.  I just got
a  notification that a game that I signed up for over two months ago will
have openings soon, so I decided to get interested in them again.  I'll
let you know more when I actually get into one.

By the way, any of our readers battle.net beta testers?  We'd love to
hear from you, and tell us how it's going.  Email me and make me envious.
I'm ready for Diablo to hit the streets, and I  hope that battle.net will
be the success they expect.

Quake' Game Worries An Access Provider 
-----------------------------------------------------
By GREN MANUEL 
c.1996 South China Morning Post 
The addictive and violent computer game Quake has led one of
Hong Kong's Internet companies to change its contract to avoid being
sued by users who suffer an epileptic fit or seizure while playing a
computer game. 
Vision Online business development manager William Lau Yiu-kuen
said a change to the terms and conditions of service was partly
triggered by the success of the highly-addictive game, a violent
three-dimensional battle which can be played with other Internet users.
Lau -- who admitted ``I play Quake nearly every day myself'' -- said
the move was aimed to protect his company, which has installed
special software to facilitate Quake and other games over the Internet.
The company had no control over its users' activities and should not
be held liable, he said. 
The contract, mailed to its several thousand subscribers last month,
excludes ``risks to the user's health, such as diseases resulting from
prolonged use of computers and possible epileptic seizures or loss of
consciousness when exposed to computer images or playing certain
games''. 
Quake and its less sophisticated predecessor, Doom, simulate a 3-D
odyssey through a maze of passages, killing people and monsters with
an array of weapons. 
Through the Internet, players can cooperate or stage a ``Deathmatch'',
trying to hunt and kill other players. 
The game is rated V3 by the Recreational Software Advisory Council
-- the most violent rating for any game, excluding those games which
feature rape. 
A leading neurosurgeon warned that some people were susceptible to
epileptic fits triggered by flashing lights such as computer games. 
``If it is a full-blown seizure it could be fatal,'' he said. 
There was no way to predict who could be susceptible and parents
should not allow their children to play computer games for hours, he
said. 

The Quake Level Editing Community Outraged By Actura Software 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/08 - "Eternal Darkness: 100 New Levels For Quake" 
By: Actura Software. A little Credit Would Be Nice.
(Update by Robert Selitto, aka: Robs) 
 "Eternal Darkness: 100 New Levels For Quake" By Actura Software is
available in stores like CompUSA for 30 dollars. Seems like a good deal,
right? Wrong. This company has levels from FTP sites such as 
ftp.stomped.com and ftp.cdrom.com that were made by people from the 
internet. These people received no credit for their levels and many 
of the .TXT files that come on this CD were either deleted or edited, 
removing any credit that was due. 
In no way did the level editors give Actura Software
permission to use their levels, and the level editors I have talked to
didn't know that their levels were on the CD in the first place.  Also,
there are NO new levels on this CD. All of the levels you will buy on
this CD you can download from the internet. This CD is a SCAM and is not
worth the 30 dollars you would pay for it. Please support id Software and
the Quake level editing community by NOT buying this product.

I-Magic Recalls First Shipment of Destiny.
-----------------------------------------
(Research Triangle Park) - Interactive Magic has decided to recall their
first 5,000 North American copies of Destiny. A new version of the much
anticipated strategy game will hit retail stores across North America
next Wednesday. I-Magic’s European offices will begin distributing
Destiny later this month.  Earlier this week, it was learned that the
first 5,000 copies of Destiny would not run properly on some computers.
Copies of the game had already been shipped to CompUSA and Media Play
stores. Additional shipments were halted and I-Magic Chairman "Wild
Bill" Stealey issued a recall of the first 5,000 games. "As an avid
gamer, nothing bothers me more than spending close to $50 on a product
that does not play properly," said Stealey. "The decision to recall the
games was very easy." "Destiny is a great title and strategy gamers have
anticipated its release for some time", added Stealey. "We are very
committed to Destiny and plan to release an online version early next
year." (A patch has already been placed on the I-Magic website that
will fix the first release version). 

Destiny by Interactive Magic

--------------------------------------------------
Destiny Academy announced -- classes open Oct. 28 Former flight
instructor Wild Bill Stealey is teaching again! On Oct. 28, I-Magic
will open the doors of the Destiny Academy, an online institution
dedicated to teaching gamers how to get the most out of our latest
strategy game. Wild Bill and Destiny designer Adrian Earle will be
answering questions on our web site and offering hints and strategies
for success.  I-Magic will be releasing a Destiny Tutorial Demo, which
will be available for download on the web site, or packaged with
upcoming gaming magazines.

Engage Games Online
-----------------------------
IRVINE, Calif., Oct. 31 /PRNewswire/ -- ENGAGE Games Online announced
today that it has added the best-selling game "WarCraft II: Tides of
Darkness"(R), from Blizzard Entertainment(R), to the impressive list of
titles being featured during its beta test period. According to PC Data
s list of top-selling software in September, "WarCraft II" was the top
game for the MS- DOS, Windows and Macintosh platforms, beating out
"Duke Nukem 3D," "Mech Warrior II" and "Myst."

3D action from Broderbund
----------------------------------
by Bill Meyer
November 1, 1996, 4 p.m. PT 
While artistic adventure has always been Broderbund
Software's forte, the company has decided to spread its
wings, acquiring its first 3D action game, Outrage, from
Raven Software. 

Billed as a 3D action thriller set in the catch-all
postapocalyptic world of the future, Outrage is tentatively
scheduled to release next summer or fall. Unfortunately,
development has only just begun, so the specifics about
Brøderbund's first foray into action are in short supply.
One thing is certain: Raven Software is a capable game
developer. Best known for its close relationship with id
Software, Raven previously designed and produced id's
Heretic and Hexen lines of fantasy first-person shooters,
distributed by GT Interactive. However, with id already
busying itself with QuakeWorld and Quake 2, it seems
Raven has found a new place to roost. Beyond publishing
Outrage, Broderbundhas also secured the worldwide
publishing rights to any forthcoming sequels. 

Brøderbund's more aggressive posture toward gaming
doesn't stop with Outrage. It is also making bold moves in
gaming's latest and greatest category, real-time strategy.
For one, Broderbundis publishing Strategic Studies'
medieval real-time war game Warlords III, which began as
a turn-based strategy game in earlier chapters. This latest
game features a stellar multiplay feature, which pits eight
feuding players against one another. Not unlike Lords of
the Realm II, you establish your economic base and crush
your multiple opponents in real time with a variety of units. 

Next, Broderbund is handling distribution for the action
strategy game Tone Rebellion, published by the Logic
Factory, best known for its graphically sharp galactic
strategy game, Ascendancy. Set in a fantastic and futuristic
world, competing Floater species must put aside their
differences to destroy one Leviathan. As if that were not
enough, Broderbundis also at work on one of its own god
games. Code-named Darwin, this sci-fi answer to
Warcraft combines a battle for genetic supremacy with
real-time combat. Even better, Broderbund promises it is
not a clone of Bullfrog's recently released Gene Wars. 

3D REALMS SNAGS MECHWARRIOR 3'S LEAD DESIGNER TO BE 
PROJECT LEADER FOR PREY
http://www.3drealms.com/
---------------------------------------
GARLAND, TEXAS--Oct. 21, 1996--3D Realms Entertainment, developers of
1996's top selling retail PC game, Duke Nukem 3D, today announced it has
hired Paul Schuytema to head up the eagerly anticipated 3D action game,
currently titled "Prey". 

Paul Schuytema will be joining 3D Realms in early November, coming from
FASA Interactive Technologies, where he was the lead designer for
MechWarrior 3. 

"I couldn't be more excited about joining the Prey team. I took one look
at the Prey engine, and knew immediately that Prey was going to be a
force to reckoned with," boasts Schuytema. "I think that Prey was the
only project in the industry that could have pulled me away from
MechWarrior 3, plus 3D Realms' reputation as a game company is
impeccable. It's going to be an awesome opportunity to blend my
storytelling ability into their formula for incredible game play. We're
going to take Prey over the top." 

3D Realms President George Broussard commented: "We're totally stoked to
have Paul joining us. He shares the same gritty sci-fi vision that we
have for Prey, and isn't afraid to get a little blood and guts on his
hands. We think his background in science fiction will help shape Prey
into something unique and he's also a die hard gamer who knows how to
play games, as well as what most people want from a game. Having Paul
join Prey is like winning the lotto." 

Prey is one of the most eagerly awaited 3D action titles due out, and
features a true 3D engine with polygon characters, network, modem and
internet play. Beyond this the game has a dark sci-fi theme, that will
pull no punches with it's action and content.

Dragon Dice
http://www.interplay.com/games/dragond.html
---------------------------------------------------------
Dragon Dice from Interplay, based on the recently-released mega-hit
strategy dice game from TSR, is an action/fantasy dice game sure to
excite both Advanced Dungeons & Dragon fans and Strategy
devotees. The game is set up to provide powerful action to both the
beginner as well as the seasoned professional. 

It's all here for the player in search of the ultimate gaming
world: dark forces, fantasy, extraordinary characters, fantastic
battles, fascinating places, happenstance, magic, chance and
illusion. The computer dice game that gives players free rein to
create their own worlds, characters and armies, Dragon Dice is
the only completely expandable game that comes with all 112
TSR digital dice, including five Wizard dice. With each die
possessing specific strength and magic, players will discover
worlds that can only be created by the power of their minds --
with a little luck from the roll of the die. 
Features: 
Dragon Dice features high-resolution characters with extremely detailed
environments and characters. The player has the option of playing
against the computer, over a local area network with multiple players
or on-line with full modem support. 
Dragon Dice will be available for Windows, Windows 95 and on the
Macintosh platform in the fourth quarter of 1996. 


Dungeon Keeper
http://www.ea.com/bullfrog/dkeeper.html
--------------------------------------------------
As an ultra-evil sorcerer who has collected a hoard of treasure over
decades of thievery and other mischief, you now retreat into your
dungeon to enjoy your unjust rewards. However, word gets around of the
accumulated treasure, and bands of so-called "heroes" attempt to relieve
you of your wealth. As these adventurers fail to return alive, more
competent (and greedy) ones turn up on your doorstep. As the keeper, you
must spend your resources to modify the shell of a dungeon in order to
defend your wonderful goodies. Walls can be built or removed, and
secret doors can be placed to fool the unwelcome guests.
You can even summon monsters to dispatch the trespassers. But remember,
although you gain powers for each adventurer's soul you take, you will
lose power for each creature that is lost. 
Features
The fully-rotational, texture mapped dungeon can be viewed isometrically
from a third party perspective, or through the eyes of a creature in
first person.  Behavioral cloning allows the game to learn from your
technique, and force the development of new strategies.  True light
sourcing adds to an amazingly real gaming environment, where torches
flicker and fires illuminate.  A host of monsters await your bidding.  A
superb multiplayer option allows one player to play the keeper, while
others play the invading heroes.  8-player networkable for the adventure
of a lifetime. 


Gladiator
http://www.io.org/~liquid/gldtr.htm
-----------------------------------
Enter the realm of the Roman Coliseum as a fearless Gladiator who must
fight all challengers. Be prepared to engage in brutal, fast-paced combat
which can lead to fame and fortune or despair, ridicule and finally death.
Gladiator is a fast paced, 3D action game being developed using Liquid
Software's 3D graphics engine. 
The focus is on the mechanics of hand to hand combat using historical
lethal weapons. The game features state of the art virtual reality
techniques including 3D graphics, realistic fighting scenes and an 
original and exhilarating soundtrack. 
Multi-player matches will be developed for use with modems and 
network systems. 
Gladiator is designed to addresses the current lack of detailed
hand-to-hand combat games. 
(FreePlay: I am not sure of the status of this game. I have
emailed the company for info on availability and requirements).


Rolemaster: Bladelands
http://www.homeworld.net/games.htm
----------------------------------------------
A GUI-based on-line multiplayer game based on the Rolemaster fantasy
role-playing rules.
Rolemaster: Bladelands supports all the base Rolemaster classes and
races, character development, and combat rules.

War of Conquest
http://www.io.org/~liquid/wrfcnqst.htm
----------------------------------------------
Maneuver your forces to conquer adversaries and as you strive towards
world domination. Skillfully combine your arsenal of technology, spies, 
diplomacy, treachery and military might to emerge triumphant.

multi-player design. It features play capability through modems,
networks and the Internet. The Internet play will allow players to 
develop alliances and secret agreements, spy on their enemies and 
friends and conquer their foes.
War of Conquest is developed to play in the Windows 95 or Windows
3.1 environment and provides an easy-to- use, graphical interface.

requiring the added cost of high-speed Internet links. War of Conquest 
can be easily played with 14,400 baud modems which satisfy the majority
of current computer owners.

BattleCity - Review by Andy Hartwell (phatso@world2u.com)
http://www.codehammer.com
-------------------------
If anyone tried Battlecity a couple of months ago and couldn't 
understand why there were all these flies in the cities, they should
give  it another try. With update after update, Jankos, creator of the
game,  has created an obsession for about 100 users. The flies have
turned into  tanks, all the objects were redone, and music and new
sounds have been  added. Also, many bugs in previous versions have been
fixed.
 Battlecity is an excellent strategy/action game; the object is to 
command a tank to build a city and destroy other cities. A player has
the  option of being a mayor to build cities, or a commando to fight for
the  cities. With the new updates, it has become much better. Bugs that
appear  while logging on have been significantly reduced. The engine
noise when  your tank moves gives you the sense of being there. And the
music helps  set the atmosphere for the game. I strongly recommend
everyone to try  this game again, or try it for the first time if you
haven't visited it.

This Play By Email Game WWW site hosts the following games:
Age of Discovery, Global Diplomacy, Imperium, and World at War

In GLOBAL DIPLOMACY each player guides the destiny of one of the Great
Powers of the late nineteenth century : Austria, China, England, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, Ottoman Empire, Russia, Spain and the USA.
Players must use their political skill and cunning as well as their
military might (armies, corps, fleets and squadrons) to become the
dominant global power.
This is a low complexity, introductory game. The average player would
require about 30 minutes to prepare their turn orders. 

AGE OF DISCOVERY uses the same basic rules as GLOBAL DIPLOMACY.
The main differences are: 
1.there is a new map for each game 
2.all players start the game with equal size 
3.players do not know the layout of the entire map, but must explore to 
discover it. 

In IMPERIUM the Galactic Emperor has just died and as one of the ruling
Major Houses, you are seeking to become the new Emperor. Use your
starships, armies, leaders and undercover agents to increase the
standing of your House in the Imperium.
Employ your forces, diplomacy, treachery and guile to expand your House's
standing so that you are chosen as the next Emperor. This is a moderately
complex game and takes about 1-4 hours to prepare turn orders. 

World at War assumes that a global war is about to break out on the
planet (similar to WWII on Earth) and each player is in charge of one of
the countries. This is a strategic level game, with the map consisting
of irregular shaped areas, turns being 3 months, land units being mostly
divisions, air units are squadrons and naval units are groups of ships.

-------------------------------
What is Zapitalism? Zapitalism is LavaMind's new CD-ROM game. It combines
3D graphic images with multi-player functionality in an adventure/strategy
game.
Zapitalism puts you on the world of Mermadan on an island known as,
Zapinalia. This island is ruled by Queen Keshi Keshi Gomu who has wisely
decided to open the economy to foreign imports. The goal of Zapitalism
is to make millions of zables(the local currency) by running an import
store which sells various exotic goods to the local consumer population.
The first person/chain to reach 100 million zables in profit wins the
game. Zapitalism can be played with 1 to 6 human players and even via
e-mail!

Alliance & Defiance (1)
http://www.webcom.com/2am/alliance.html
----------------------------------------------------
You are the absolute ruler of A Major European Power. But this is not
enough. You want to be the absolute ruler of THE Major European Power. 
There is only one problem. So does everyone else.
2AM’s Alliance & Defiance is a game of military and diplomatic 
maneuvering in modern times. 
The game actions are simple: 
Control a European country, with a fixed number of cities.  Use the cities to
either build armies now, or do research that will build you better
armies tomorrow.  Coastal cities can build fleets that transport your
armies to foreign shores.  When opposing armies meet, they fight, but
victory is never guaranteed by superiority. Luck plays a role too!  Gain
resources by capturing foreign cities.  Protect your home cities. They
produce the most. Conquered cities produce far less. Conquest is one
way of improving your overall capability. Alliances are better - your
partner’s city produces at full capacity.

Unlike other computer games, in Alliance & Defiance you are not playing
against the limited silicon opponents of a computer program. Alliance &
Defiance is played ACROSS THE INTERNET. That French army that just
outmaneuvered you was led by a real person. If only you could get your
hands on him!

http://www.internetivity.com/games.html
---------------------------------------
Tantrix, described as a cross between Backgammon and Go, 
challenges players to create paths of specific colors using the set
of 56 hexagonal tiles. Each tile has a unique design of red, green, 
blue and yellow links. Tantrix is playable by 1 - 4 players.

Tantrix can be played by 1, 2, 3 or 4 players. The single-player Tantrix
games are known as Tantrix Puzzles, while the multi-player game is
known as Tantrix, the Strategy Game, or simply as the Tantrix Game.
When Tantrix is played by more than two players, it becomes a fun game
with more player interaction. Two players might form a 'coalition' and
together play against the leading player. The two-player game has a
different focus. Moves are more predictable and strategic planning is
important. This makes two-player Tantrix ideal for serious players.

Paintball Network (14)
http://www.ee.utulsa.edu/~dug/pbn.html
-------------------------------------------------
Paintball is a hot new internet game. It follows in 
the tradition of MUDs, in that you can simply telnet 
to it, play the game, meet new people, and improve 
yourself every time you play. Downloading the paintball 
interface program from the official homepage allows you 
to learn the game faster and also allows easier 
playability, but by no means do you need the interface

Renegade Incarnate (16)
http://www.incarnate.com/
--------------------------------
We would like to welcome you to the first completely Java client based
multi-user graphical fighting game in the world(at least that we know
of). In the development of Renegade Incarnate we have tried to take the
best elements of traditional multi-user based gaming (namely the
incredible depth in game play, 100's of users playing at a time) and
combine it with the traditional graphics of a tile based adventure game
but with 24bit color! What we came up with is quite special, and we
hope that you agree.  October 20 marks the official beta launch of our
game. At launch only one area will be completed, but we will be adding
more shortly (so PLAY OFTEN). We would also like to remind you that this
adventure game is in its Beta stages, and keeping that in mind there may
be times when it is not currently running. In the mean time play it and
HAVE FUN!

Humor - Something to keep you laughing while you are getting fragged
--------

Why Computer Games are Better than Women:
1. It's theoretically possible to understand a computer game.
2. When a computer game gets obnoxious you can turn it off.
3. They're a lot cheaper. 
4. With most computer games you can win. 
5. A computer game never yells at you for playing a different game.
6. Beating a computer game is not illegal.

And to be fair to the fairer sex

Why computer games are better than *men*:
1. You can turn the sound down.
2. They always have a neutral and inoffensive smell.
3. They go more rounds.
4. Push the right buttons, and they'll stay turned on for hours on end.
5. They don't leave dirty socks round the living room.
6. They have more visual appeal.
7. They're not paranoid about the size of their joysticks. 

Admittedly computer games don't have anything resembling real intelligence, but then . . .
