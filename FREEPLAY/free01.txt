FreePlay is a bi-weekly newsletter devoted to informing you of the latest ways to play
multi-player games on the Internet for FREE!

Editorial
---------
I will be experimenting with different formats of this newsletter, 
until I get it just the way I like.
So don't be surprised if this thing looks radically
different every issue. I ask and beg.. yea... BEG for your comments
concerning this newsletter.
I am going to need some feedback from my readers to help
make this a great newsletter.

All new issues will go out to subscribers FIRST!
Then one week LATER it will be archived on the WEB Page.
The Web page is also subject to radical changes and improvements.
Its pretty lame right now. Just a holding place for the newsletter. 
Eventually, hope to all the flash/pizazz (tables,forms,etc) you see
on some of the other web pages you have visited.

Ok, ok... On with the newsletter, enough with the bullsh*t.

There is a LOT happening in the multi-player world of the internet. 
Maybe I should have called this the BETA edition. 
There is a lot of beta-testing happening on the internet. 
And this issue covers mostly them right now.
On with the reviews!
