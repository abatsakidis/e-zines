Announcement - Welcome aboard Scott Grattan
-------------------------------------------
We welcome aboard Scott Grattan as a regular writer for FreePlay.
He has a clear, concise, writing style and should make a great addition
to future editions of this newsletter.  
DO YOU RUN A WWW gaming page? Tell us! 
We will review your page in the Hot Links section of this
newsletter. Over four hundred (and growing by five or more a day)
subscribers, in fifteen countries, specifically interested in
multiplayer gaming read this newsletter. Also, many game company folks 
(such as Papyrus and Electronic Arts) are subscribers.

FreePlay is looking for more regular or even not so regular contributors.
Are you interested?  We need regular writers/reviewers for: Play By Email
Games, Macintosh games, War Game/Strategy Reviewers I can pretty much
handle the rest.

Your mission should you decide to accept it :) is to provide a one to two
paragraph review on a WWW gaming site or game on any of those topics I
listed above.
Or even just send us any WWW gaming links if you want! You will get
credit for any links you send our way if we use them.

As always, the FreePlay newsletter is a work in progress. Sections will
come and go depending on material available.

Editorial - Random Thoughts
---------------------------
OUR BIGGEST ISSUE YET! FreePlay Newsletter is being mailed in TWO PARTS
due to size limitations with JUNO readers (64k). 
To JUNO readers, for best results set your FONT to Arial 11 point(Options/Change Font/Arial).

The game Quake will NOT be a regular feature of this newsletter. I just
happen to be hooked (OK, addicted...) on it for now.

Beta Tests come and go. Meridian 59 is out of beta and is now a
commercial product. TEN (Total Entertainment Network) has also gone
commercial. TEN claims many exclusive on multiplayer games.
What they MEAN is no OTHER GAMING SERVICE(like Mplayer) will be able to
offer network play of that particular game. But, many of the games they
claim exclusive rights to, are IPX capable. The KALI software which
allows you to chat and hook up directly with other players is always an
option. TEN can't do a thing about it.
KALI is SOFTWARE that emulates IPX over a TCP/IP connection that enables
users to hook up to each other directly (rather than thru a game server)
over the internet, not an online service (correct me if I am wrong!).
There are always alternatives.
Kali is located at http://www.internexus.net/kali/ Thanks to one of my
readers who wrote to me asking how come I didn't review Kali. I wrote
back to him saying that I try not to repeat anything already reviewed
in previous newsletters. But, it turned out to give me an idea for the
editorial. :) Anyway, hey!, for every free beta test ending, there are
always more to come. Battle.net (http://www.blizzard.com) is testing
now. It will be FREE always. The only advantage I see to beta testing
it,  is to see what it is like before the rest of the gamers.
Or, If they are offering to...then getting Diablo (full version) 
before it hits the stores.
When Blizzard Entertainment releases Diablo and Starcraft it will
include software to link to the battle.net servers to play for free.
Rumors abound on Usenet message groups that it will only be free the
first two months of your signup to battle.net. I haven't been able to
confirm that.

Blizzard Entertainment News
http://www.blizzard.com/
------------------------
Did any of my subscribers make it to the beta test signup Saturday night,
October 6th? (Sunday 3:00 AM for me). I didn't try to get on the WWW page. 
Review follows by scotti@wic.net (Scott Grattan).
It's coming.
The long awaited answer to gamers dreams all over the world is coming, and it's
closer than you know.   Battle.net is Blizzard's response to the request
for a gaming network that will allow players from all over the world to
work together, or against each other.  Battle.net goes into Beta
testing starting at midnight, October 6th, and will be tested by the
first 1,000 people to sign up.  Currently, two titles are scheduled to
make use of battle.net:  Diablo and Starcraft.  Diablo promises to be
the 21st Century version of Dungeons & Dragons.  Through battle.net, it
will be possible to link up with other players, and explore catacombs
together in search of adventure.  Starcraft will be Warcraft-like, in
that you must gather your resources to build up your forces to dominate
against other races.
Battle.net : http://www.blizzard.com/bnet/bnet.htm 
Starcraft : http://www.blizzad.com/star/star.htm 
has several screen shots and description of the game
Diablo : http://www.blizzard.com/diablo/diablo.htm has several screen
shots and a downloadable intro (11M) which is worth the time!

Microsoft Updates Game Technology by Michael Desmond (September 25, 1996)
- Microsoft today released version 3.0 of its DirectX collection of
application programming interfaces (API) for game and multimedia
developers. The new version, which arrives just four months after the
release of DirectX 2.0, provides enhanced tools and capabilities for
developers to include in Windows 95-based titles. For users, the updated
tools should eventually provide better multi-player game play, enhanced
graphics and audio performance, and support for digital input devices
using Universal Serial Bus (USB) connections.
While Dallas says that DirectX 3.0 should be available in games in the
holiday season, many developers and analysts feel the lead time will be
longer.

SubSpace goes to commercial release.


Death Rally v1.1 update
http://www.apogee1.com
--------------------
Mentioned in the last issue in the Preview section, it actually should
have been in the Games section. I suffer from C.R.S.  I guess, and
neglected the fact that the shareware version was available for download.
Death Rally is top-down view racing game with great graphics.
If I remember right, the downloadable 6.9 meg shareware demo is not
multiplayer capable. 
What's new/Fixed in v1.1 of Death Rally:
* Support for Sound Blaster cards over IRQ 7 has been added.
* Fixed problem with player rankings being listed incorrectly in
  some rare circumstances.
* Name of main game executable changed from DR.EXE to RALLY.EXE
  to avoid certain conflicts with Windows95.

(Quote from home page)
The current trend in computer gaming is to make games for multiple
players, and even have them solely based off the internet. Currently
there are many Multiplayer Online Games (MPOG) in free beta testing,
and tons more in development. I have searched the web to find all the
Multiplayer Online Games, and I have compiled this directory of links,
reviews, prices and screenshots of many of the playable games on the
Net. (FreePlay: This is a great WWW page, nice graphics. Maybe I will
ask him to redesign MY web page :). He covers many of the games we cover
in the newsletter but with screenshots, ratings, and links to get you to
the game site. Vote in the Game of the Month section. Stop by and tell
Dave that FreePlay sent you!)

Battle Isle 3 - Multiplayer World Championship
Hi out there! After playing several one-player games I tried to find
some human opponents in strategic-games related newsgroups. There were
some! We started one-on-one matches and recently a real multiplayer map
with six human players. More battles will take place. This page was
constructed to bring a small tick of coordination in the upcoming
battles. So, if you're looking for opponents check back in this place.
You'll find some! Just contact one or more of the players in that list,
"setup" a new game or join in a "waiting game".

Rift - A Quake Network Tool
http://www.phoenix.net/~ishmal/rift/
------------------------------------
The most-asked question about Quake on the Internet right now is: 
"Do you know any good server addresses?
RIFT gives the user an up-to-date, current look at the Quake servers
running RIGHT NOW on the Internet. 
Highlights of Features:
Launches Quake! 
Gets server lists from Stomped.Com and ][ronman
Script insertion - Creates a script for Quake to provide an INTERNAL server list
HTML page creation - can insert a Quake server list into any HTML page you want. 
Host name pre-lookup - All desired host names are looked up when Rift starts up
Reverse DNS host name lookup - For those servers that are listed only as IP addresses
Quake server query - Rift does a Quake server Query much like some other programs
Players on a quake server are shown 
Server settings are shown 
Ping - Rift can ping any listed server, providing an idea how playable a server might be. 
Small footprint - Does not modify Quake in any way. 


Quake Server Explorer
http://www.execpc.com/DiskAndDesk/qse/
--------------------------------------
Quake Server Explorer is the original GUI server picker for windows 95.
It's the only one to take full advantage of the world's best Quake
Server Listing, ][ronMan's.
][ronMan's list is essentially all you need to play Quake. It lists ping
times from 6 computers across the USA, and averages the totals into an
average ping response time. It also lists the Locations and server
flags, which is important in choosing the best Quake server to play on.
Not all lists have that. Stomped.com's Server List originates in
Minnesota, which is where the ping time is calculated on Stomped's List.

QSE 3.7 Features:
New player and server support!
Player search and server addition utilities! Find any player on the
internet! Advanced sorting capabilities, including ascending and
descending of any field! Tree View as well as the List View!, New

The Wild World of e-Wrestling
http://www.concentric.net/~rumbler/pits.htm
-------------------------------------------
e-Wrestling is professional wrestling simulated by any one of a number of
different systems, usually run by email.
Usually, it involves first creating a wrestler complete with persona and
some sort of statistics to resolve matches and then "managing" his/her
career. The usual mechanism is to arrange matches with other players,
and then (often weekly) the gamemaster (usually referred to as
Federation Head) resolves the matches. Repeat as needed.  There is a
newsgroup, rec.sports.pro-wrestling.fantasy, which covers e-Wrestling,
and the FAQ for that group is archived right here.

Welcome to Playsite (Chess, Backgammon, Checkers, Poker,etc..)
http://web147.bbnplanet.com/
-----------------------------
It's in beta test, If I had a nickel for every beta testing game on the
internet.....:) I reviewed Chess Live in the FIRST issue of FreePlay. 
Remember this from issue #1??? 
Chess Live! - http://oasi.shiny.it/chess/
Play Chess on the web against other people. JAVA applet loads
reasonably fast on my 28.8 connection. Very nice graphical chess board.
Classic ELO rating for those care about that.

It still works, but....change your bookmark!
They are moving it to...PlaySite - http://www.playsite.com.  
It bounces you to the URL http://web147.bbnplanet.com/
Hey, I can do that to. Type in your WWW browser the following url
http://freeplay.home.ml.org
It will take you to http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Park/4874 
Surprise! (I am in a weird mood today, huh?)
Here's the notice.
The ChessLive! game is currently being incorporated into an exciting new
web site, PlaySite. If you wish to play this game, please note that some
of the ChessLive! features have been temporarily disabled as we
incorporate them into our own system. 
Playsite also features Backgammon, Flipper, Checkers, and Poker.
Coming soon... Draw Poker, Texas Hold'em, Hearts, High Scores, 
saved games, and much more!
If Bill Gates and Internet Gaming Zone ever go pay-for-play, this site
may be a great alternative. It's all JAVA and the graphics are really
good.
They say there are currently compatibility problems with Netscape
Navigator 3.0 for Windows and some PlaySite games. If you find you are
having difficulties, try Netscape 2.0 or Internet Explorer 3.0. I
didn't have problem using Netscape 3.0.
When I checked there were about 16 people online chatting away.
