Announcement

FreePlay WWW page is *MOVING* soon.
-----------------------------------
We are looking for a new WWW home site. I am not asking  for someone to
provide a site for me (unless you want to).
Currently, I am in negotiations with quite a few gaming sites/host 
providers concerning cost, features,etc.  I haven't made up my mind yet,
except that geocities.com is too confining for our future WWW plans, 
even with them now allowing 2 megs now for web space. Geocities doesn't
have the features I want including full CGI support, and a FAST site.
If you know of a good WWW host site at a reasonable cost or better yet
free, please mail me at freeplay@snet.net

FreePlay Newsletter to be archived at ftp.etext.org
---------------------------------------------------
I have upload issues #1 thru #10 of the FreePlay Newsletter in .zip
format to ftp.etext.org. Hopefully the newsletters will be available at
ftp.etext.org/Pub/Zines/Freeplay. I am corresponding with the FTP
administrators and haven't received the 'ok' yet that this is so. I
will let you know in the next issue.
************************************************************************


Editorial - I actually read my Email Folks!
-------------------------------------------
One of my readers (Ed S. you know who you are :) asked me 
"Why don't you include a cheat code section with your newsletter?"
I liked that idea but we have so many sections in the zine now,
I decided what I will do is try to highlight at least one
GOOD Cheat WWW page or resource each issue in the "Hot Links" section.
Thanks for the idea Ed, and check the Hot Links section in this issue.

What FreePlay been playing
--------------------------
I am almost burned out on Quake, but not yet. I have decided to start
checking out other games.

I got my Azaria beta CD and have been messing with it.
Azaria is at http://www.massplay.com/singularity
No matter what I do in the game the screen colors are screwed.
No online documentation. I'm totally lost. Also, I think
I screwed my DirectX settings by installing their DirectX stuff.
Beta-testing is so much fun! 

I finally got Diablo to work by reverting back to my standard SVGA
drivers. (I was hoping this would fix my problem with Azaria too.)
Diablo is one righteous game! I just wish I could control battle with
more than JUST the mouse. Can't wait for battle.net to go live so I can
get in on the multiplayer options.

I have also been checking out DaggerFall. There is a 16 meg download
available and for those who already have the demo there is a new patch
available Dec 1,1996.
at http://www.bethsoft.com/html/daggerfall.html
This game isn't multiplayer capable *yet* and may not be, but
rumors abound such as this one I found at 
http://www.newforce.ca/~jackel/dagger/daginfo.html
"There are rumors to use DAGGERFALL as the core of an online game.
Bethesda is unwilling to comment further at this point but it would be
quite unlikely that an online game got off the ground in the near to
medium future. " 

Keep the mail coming folks. I am open to any and all suggestions.
Much of what you see in this newsletter is due to your comments.
Tell me how to make this newsletter a better 'read' for YOU!

Rambling On - By Scott Grattan
-----------
Isn't the information age supposed to make our lives a lot easier?
There's entirely TOO much happening online, and I want to be a part
of it all!  Unfortunately, periodic fits of sleep overtake me, and I 
am pretty much OFFline for a good five hours.  Then when I do recover,
I find that REAL life has managed to get a hand-hold on my attention, 
and I must work VERY hard at getting back to my virtual world.  

Suffice it to say, that I've had no time to really delve into anything
that has to do with gaming online since the last newsletter.  I can 
tell you what is happening, and what is supposed to happen.  And if I'm
still feeling prophetic, I can maybe tell you what I think is going to 
happen.

First, the Diablo beta testing period ended this past Wednesday, November 
27th at Midnight.  Blizzard is now hard at work getting the changes made
(and bugs removed) that was deemed necessary to get this game shipped!
I was patiently waiting for this to come out, but my patience is nearly
gone!  I bought Command & Conquer: Red Alert to try and calm my anti-
cipation, but it just hasn't done the trick.  [MORE on C&C:RA later]

I was also very pleasantly surprised by two recent discoveries: Kali has
released a version for Windows '95, and my new ISP (recently changed) has
been trying to get their Kali server up for a while now.  Kali, for those 
of you who don't know, is a software that allows any software that has an
IPX network compatability to be played via the internet!  Here's where to 
go to check it out:

http://www.kali.net

It's only a one-time fee of $20 to register their software, and that is 
good for a lifetime of unlimited usage and upgrades!  I'll be spending some
quality time getting this up and running for my area, and I'm sure you'll be
hearing more about it in the near future.

Want to hear about C&C:RA now?  Well, I haven't been able to spend too much
time with it yet, since I also bought another great game at the same time,
Tomb Raider.  Has absolutely nothing to do with online gaming, but it is an
incredible piece of work.  If you really want to hear more about it, check 
out this great web page I found called :

Mr. Wolf's Tomb Raider Stuff
http://www.vvm.com/~hfowler/

Ok, so I got a little sidetracked...  where was I?  OH YEAH!  Red Alert! 
First impressions?  It's kind of sluggish on my system (P133, 32M), so that
makes it less than appealing.  Fortunately, from what I have had time to 
play around with, it's going to be great.  I had some difficulty logging 
into Westwood's server using their Westwood Chat utility.  It was not clear
on how to go about registering a user name and such, and made it a bit frus-
trating to say the least.  When I did login, I was immediately hit with a wave
of nostalgia...  AOL CHAT ROOM!!   Followed closely, of course, by a wave of 
nausea.  I sincerely hope that Westwood cleans it up a little bit, and makes
it a bit more user friendly.  

But the game itself?  Like all sequels, it's more of the same.  Unlike most 
sequels, it's an improvement on a great thing!  There are some fantastic add-
itions that make this worth playing into the wee hours of the morning.  As soon
as I finish Tomb Raider, I'm sure you'll find me prowling around for a regular
and challenging opponent.  I did get some time on a network with a friend of 
mine here in town, and we managed to kill several hours that would have other-
wise been spent much more foolishly, like sleeping!  

One last thing before I leave!  Did any of you manage to get over to YOU DON'T
KNOW JACK - The Netshow?  If you didn't, DO IT!!  I got into the game, and it's
an incredible example of what's going to be available to us online in the near 
future.  There's a download required of about 2.5M, but that's it!  The rest is 
just streaming data, and it's well worth it!  There's money to be won also, but 
you better know your stuff!

You Don't Know Jack - The Netshow:
http://www.bezerk.com

That's all I've got this week kids!  Hopefully the next time FreePlay
invades your mailbox, I'll have some stuff to tell you about Diablo and
Battle.net, as well as some info on a beta test I'm involved in!  I need
to check with the programmer to make sure that it's ok to say anything at
this point, but I can tell you that so far it's looking like a winner! 
Until next ish, good gaming!

Battle.net
http://www.battle.net
---------------------
Announcement: Nov 25,1996
Battle.net Beta testing period
*** ATTENTION BATTLE.NET BETA TESTERS ***
We are excited to announce that we are preparing our release candidate
of  Battle.net and Diablo. This release candidate will be shipped to a
handful of  beta testers to verify system compatibility fixes. We will
need to make some  changes to our server software to support the release
candidate and, as a  result, we will be ending the Battle.net Beta
program this Wednesday at 12:00  midnight. We have implemented many
changes that are in direct response to the  excellent work done during
the beta period.

We will also be making changes to Diablo, a large number of which were
also  initiated by the thousands of bug reports we received from our
beta testers.  Among the changes that have been implemented are: Fixing
incompatibilities across hundreds of different computer and system 
configurations.
Implementing specific changes in Diablo gameplay to address the ability
to  exploit the game such as experience potions, cloning items and gold,
poorly  balanced spells and equipment, elixirs, oils and numerous other
items.
Changes to reduce the threat of player killing.
Improvements to the chat engine and interface.
New elements to make your experience on Battle.net even more exciting,
such  as multiplayer quests!

Games network claims 10,000 paying subscribers
SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 26, 1996-- 
----------------------------------------------
Total Entertainment Network (TEN) (http://www.ten.net) today
announced that in less than two months more than 10,000 paying
subscribers have registered for its service. Launched in September,
TEN claims it is the first commercial Internet entertainment network
that allows for nationwide high-speed multiplayer gaming. "Hit PC
games delivered over a reliable low-latency network is a new killer
application for the Internet," said president and CEO Jack Heistand.
TEN chief executive Jack Heistand called the sign-up rate a "tremendous
response." Still, TEN has a ways to go before it reaches the 25,000
sign-up rate that Heistand predicted by year's end in an interview with
CNET in late September.  

Online gaming may not be living up to all its hype, but it remains on
track to make a dent in the Internet market in 1997. 

One of the problems with online game playing is delays, or "latency," in
online action--for example, the time it takes for a virtual gun to be
fired and hit its target. This so-called VPN is supposed to mitigate the
problem.  So far, TEN is the only pay-to-play national online gaming
service available. Under an introductory rate plan, TEN is charging
$4.95 a month for up to five hours of Net gaming. After that, the price
is 95 cents for each additional hour. A flat-rate plan also is offered at
$14.95 per month.  MPath is out, but it is free, and Engage is not yet
available commercially.

Microsoft recently announced plans to enter the market, but no details
have emerged. Sources said they expect the company to stick to simpler
games such as chess, checkers, and backgammon, at least initially. 

Some analysts are holding out high hopes for online gaming, however. The
new industry is supposed to generate $1 billion in annual sales by the
year 2000, according to Jupiter Communications. Devices that combine
online gaming with Net surfing, such as Sega's Saturn device, also may
help the market.  A survey released today by Impulse Research said 61
percent of video gamers want to play on the Net. 

`Master Of Orion II: Battle At Antares' From Microprose Goes Gold
-----------------------------------------------------------------
ALAMEDA, Calif., Nov. 19 /PRNewswire/ -- There will be more aliens to

Novelist Tom Clancy Targets New Online Game Audience 
Rueters -10:27 Nov 14, 1996 EST 
-------------------------------
NEW YORK - Best-selling author Tom Clancy and "three-dimensional"
software developer Virtus hope to blast their way into the online gaming
arena with the formation of Red Storm Entertainment, the author said. 
Red Storm, a partnership owned equally by Clancy and Virtus, plans to
offer interactive computer games, with a focus on the new generation of
multi-player games, which allow players to match wits against each over
via online networks. 
The games will be based on the sort of military and geopolitical
storylines that have previously made Clancy one of the world's most
popular authors. 
"Using the computer, we can set up multiplayer games... that will create
a degree of realism that never really existed outside of the professional
communities," said Clancy, who is also Red Storm's chairman. 
Online interactive gaming allows multiple users in remote locations
simultaneously to play games linked by modems over the Internet. 
Computer users can find details on the new company at

Quake Expansion Pack
http://www.gamers.org/~rogue/quake_r.html
-----------------------------------------
It's official! Quake Expansion Pack. Rogue recently signed on to create
a set of levels which expand the action of id Software's enormously
successful Quake. The project, in the works since August, is scheduled
for a first quarter 1997 release.
It's gonna be awesome! The pack slams the player back into Quake's world
with entirely new, and totally intense, action-oriented levels. We'll
also be adding new monsters, new power-ups, a collection of deadly
environmental traps and...as they say in the 'biz', much, much more!

WorldCraft HomePage
http://www.islandnet.com/worldcraft/
------------------------------------
Worldcraft is a Quake-capable MAP editor by Ben Morris, author of the
Doom Construction Kit.

information. We are working on VISA Credit Card orders. They're not
available yet, but we hope to have the ability within a couple
weeks(might not be in time for Christmas.) Please do not send VISA
information yet. We will not take it until the VISA merchant application

Michael Houston, Quake junkie, decided to embark on the Quake comic book

HTML writing AND Quake devotion all at the same time?! 

Another time, another place, another war. These are the
adventures of Dank and Scud, two loners caught in the
barbaric world of Quake. How long has it been? Three
years? Seven? A decade? Was Earth a memory, or merely
a figment of their imagination? Is there a way home? Do
they care?
No.
They're having way too much fun.

Updates -  Take old bugs out, put new ones in
-------

Azaria Beta Update.
http://www.massplay.com/singularity
-----------------------------------
Most of of you have already received your Azaria CD.
Many of you have already joined into a session
and have learned how enjoyable the game can be.  We
recognize that there have been a few installation
problems,  and there is a demand for more instruction.
Here are a few pointers to help you get started --
There is a patch on the web site that you should
download and install.  Look for the label 'OOPS, we 
forgot something'.  This fixes the 'dplay.dll file 
not found' error as well as a few missing graphics and
links.  NOTE: If you have renamed your dplayx.dll file,
you should restore it to its original name before 
installing the patch.
There are people on-line willing to help out.  If
you can't figure out what to do -- just ask.  Remember,
this is a multi-player game . . .

CyberArts Backgammon

7th Legion Home Page
http://www.epicgames.com/7th_lega.htm
-------------------------------------
Originally reported in Issue #10 in the Gaming News Section.
There is no DEMO available yet but there is a 3mb AVI movie you can
watch.
7Th Legion is a native Windows 95 game being developed by Vision Software
of New Zealand and published by Epic MegaGames, Inc. 7Th Legion is
real-time and successfully combines elements of strategy and action.

7Th Legion (Working title) is a futuristic real-time action strategy
game with a unique focus on arcade gameplay. Unlike other games of its
genre, 7th Legion is a fast-paced, frantic blast. 

Features will include:
640x480 high resolution graphics, Fast, arcade style game play, Two-Six
multi-player Support via modem, LAN, and Internet, Stunning SVGA
graphics, Rendered cinematics,Multiple power-ups, the ability to
research new and more powerful weapons.

7Th Legion features a user interface powerful enough to lead the largest
of armies into battle, yet simple enough that the average game player
will be waging war in minutes! Players construct powerful armies and
weapons, ranging from giant walking robots to infantry and tanks, then
lead them into real-time battle across multiple rendered battlegrounds.


The Streets of Simcity
http://www.maxis.com/products/streets_of_simcity/
-------------------------------------------------
The Streets of SimCity" is in early development, but we can tell you a
bit about the general concept. The Streets of SimCity will put you
behind the wheel of car, racing through a SimCity 2000 city either one
of several pre-designed cities to be included in the game or one of your
own metropolis in 3D. Players will be able to map out the race course
through their city and race against computer-controlled and/or live
opponents. Race victories bring money prizes which can be used to
upgrade to newer, more powerful vehicles, as well as to purchase
additional equipment (i.e. oil slick generators, tack droppers, etc.).
Sound fun? Throw in support for modem-to-modem play or up to eight
player multiplayer game over the Internet or LAN and you've got the
ultimate action/racing game. Look for more information and screen shots
after the COMDEX trade show in mid-November.


Tanktics
http://www.dma.co.uk
-----------------------------
"Tanktics", DMA's second forthcoming release for BMG Interactive.
The fastest, most original strategy game in the history of the world.
Ever! (and we really mean that).  The objective of the game is, like a
few others, to lay waste unto thine enemies, destroying his forces,
annihilating his base and generally making life unpleasant in a number
of creative ways. 

A Strategy Game 65 Million Years in the making Tanktics features four
distinctive Eras for the player to try.
Stone-age features huge tanks carved out of massive chunks of granite.
Slow movers but don't let them get too close. Medieval tanks are
constructed like castles.
Stone and wood with all of the heraldry and frilly bits. Modern tanks are
mean no-nonsense cold-war chunks o' metal, sinister and deadly. While the
future tanks have cool options like hovering and long-range weapons.
Each era contains enough tank parts to offer over 2 Million possible
combinations of tank. Enough to keep even the saddest strategy freaks
(i.e. us) happy for an amazing amount of time. When you combine the
different eras in a single or multi-player game, where you can mix and
match components from different eras, the number of different tank
combination rises to approximately 3x1011. That's a Whole Lotta Tanks.
The eras have all been modeled so that no one era has a particular
advantage over another era. The Future tanks will have a hard time
beating the Stone-Age tanks and we love it that way. 

Features:
Unique gameplay and control method.  Four Distinctive Era's - Stone Age,
Medieval, Modern & Future.  2 Million combinations of tanks per era. 
Approx 3x1011 possible combinations in total.  Square-Go's a plenty. 
Games of up to 4 players over Lan, Modem or Serial link  Accurately
modeled physical interaction with the environment.  Sheep.  Brave tanks,
scaredy tanks, depressed tanks and flirtatious tanks.  Burning Sheep. 
Large fights with huge weapons and millions of tanks. 


WarBreeds
http://www.broderbund.com/studio/comingsoon/warbreeds.html
----------------------------------------------------------
WarBreeds is a real time strategy game of planetary conquest and genetic
supremacy. Players will have to skillfully balance management of
resources and aggressive battle strategies to conquer opponents, and
acquire knowledge for advanced genetic engineering. WarBreeds features
multiplayer and internet play for up to 8 players, as well as unique
strategies, weapons and abilities for each of the four races. Set
against the stunningly rendered alien landscapes populated by fully
animated creatures, players will embark on a quest for total domination
of the planet Aeolia, in either of two complete campaigns. By leading
one of the surviving clans, players will seek out, harvest and research
enemy genetic material, and then incorporate its inherent attributes
into their own clan's arsenal. The battle rages between more and more
highly evolved clans, of which only the most highly evolved and well
deployed will achieve planetary domination.

BetaNets Beta Report of The Day
http://www.betabeta.com/ (corrected URL)
-----------------------
I reported on this in the last issue of FreePlay.
Unfortunately, the corporate weasels at http://www.tipworld.com, a site
owned by IDG publications (they publish PC World, among others), have
treated him like dogsh*t, reneged on their contract, and basically
told him to go fly a kite.
I don't have all the details of what happened between him and tipworld,
but my correspondence with Tim Cassedy-Blum <betanet@betabeta.com> who
publishes the BetaNet newsletter and WWW site sets my teeth on edge and
has made me decide to STAY an independent publisher for now.
Anyway, check out his site and show your support by subscribing to his
newsletter and let him know by email what a great job he is doing.
And here is what Tipworld had to say 'publicly':
Dear TipWorld subscriber,
Effective today, we have suspended publication of the BetaNet Beta Report
of the Day on TipWorld. Please continue to visit BetaNet on the web at 
http://www.betabeta.com.

ELFx WINSOCK's home page
http://ascu.unian.it/~milani/
-----------------------------
Revision Date: December 1, 1996 
Also Available: Windows 3.x Version 
Advanced, programmable, fast and user-friendly
client for playing MUDs. MACROs, VARs, ALIASes,
TRIGGERs, full mouse support, sounds, logs, scroll-buffer, full
ANSI colour support, user definable windows, encryption,
wizards, support for multiple instances. Automatic TICK
recognition for faster HP/MANA/MOV regain.


Kali
http://www.axxis.com/kali/
--------------------------
Release of 1.1 is coming soon!
Built- in support for the current KaliDP and KaliNB technology.
Further improvements (already written) include organized game launching
screens for Duke Nukem, Doom, Doom2, Heretic, Hexen, Terminal Velocity,
Quake, and any other games we can find that failed to include their own
lobby interface. This way even a first time user can join a Duke game
forming on a server and start playing without knowing anything about how
to run multiplayer Duke. These same screens will be used to launch
DirectPlay games. 
Data compression that will reduce packet sizes on ALL games. We're
expecting this to allow faster games and more people in each game. The
compression varies from 10-50% depending on the game.  Winsock IPX
support. Currently only DOS IPX games work with Kali. With Winsock IPX
support you will be able to run any Win95 game that uses IPX; this
includes all current DirectPlay games. The Win95 version of Descent2
would then be able to play in the same games as the DOS and Mac users. 
Future real DirectPlay support for DirectPlay 3.0. Unfortunately we'll
have to wait for games to be written with 3.0 before this will help any.
And more. Multiple configurations so that two people can use the same
PC and have different Kali95 setups.
Lots of extra sound triggers in chat for different events. More game
launch icons. ActiveX support. More, more, more. And I bet you thought
we were sitting back enjoying our success. :)

forum for the sim racer - a place where racers share their ideas,
opinions, techniques and data in real time and oh yes, RACE! Did we
mention the word "FREE?" 
WTR has it's own gaming/chat server on the internet, free of charge to
anyone who wishes to sign on. Once you do, you can talk to and race with
other sim racers online. The only requirements for using the WTR Network
are that you love simulation auto racing and you have the software to
get connected. WTR utilizes Kali gaming technology. 
(Nascar Racing from Sierra/Papyrus is now compatible with the Kali
system).

Circa 7000 - Armies of Armageddon
http://www.nitehawk.com/Boku/
-----------------------------
Circa 7000 is a heavily strategic, turn-based war game. Each side has a
squad to small army-sized force of individual troops, mechs and vehicles
doing battle on a large, detailed field filled with rivers, swamps,
forests, buildings and the more sinister trip wires and land mines. Play
occurs in 3 powerful, yet intuitive, Phases. In the first Phase, all the
forces move (with different rules for vehicles and non-vehicles.) In the
second, forces aim up to three weapons each from their primary or
secondary stash. All the weapons fire in Phase III. 

And that's only the beginning! Circa 7000 is delivered with all the
tools used to make the game's forces, terrains and battles! This
includes the Game Maker for making your own scenarios: pick and place
the armies, design the battlefield, write up the story and specify how
the game will end (Destroying/Conquering areas or Casualties alone).
And when that isn't enough, use the Customizer to modify the existing
forces or design your own from scratch! Design and draw your own forces,
weapons and terrain, including all the stats and sound, to implement in
your own scenarios, time periods and themes! Play is literally unlimited
when you start swapping these files... 
Requirements:

486SX-33 (About the minimum tolerable speed), 4M of Extended 
Memory,(3.2M must be free!), 600k of free conventional memory,
6M of Disk space, SVGA, Mouse, Sound Card optional

Station Beta Two
http://www.geocities.com/Area51/6225/index.htm
----------------------------------------------

Greetings and welcome aboard Beta 2! These pages are based on the Star
Trek based E-Mail role-playing simulation that takes place along the
Deep Space Nine and Voyager timeline. We hope you'll enjoy your stay,
and might consider moving aboard. Station Beta Two is the seedy and
seductive underbelly of the Federation that offers a dark and
mysterious experience like no other in the galaxy.

E-mail sims differ from traditional online sims because all the action
occurs in E-mail between crew members. Unlike other role-playing games,
there is no system to determine your character's actions. The only
limit to what your character can do is common sense, your creativity,
and imagination! As you'll quickly find out, E-mail sims focus on
character development, role-playing, and character interaction.
Interactive storytelling by E-mail is like a collaborative novel, but
not quite. When working with others on a novel, everyone confers and
agrees upon the overall characters, content and resolution of the tale.


The Official Web Supremacy Game Site
http://www.b-span.com/supremacy/
--------------------------------
In the near future, six superpowers will emerge from the ashes of the
Cold War. They will use their economic, political and military muscle
to crush their opponents, and conquer the world. 
You are the Commander-in-Chief of one of those Superpowers. You will
have to make hard economic decisions. Should you sell your surplus oil
to the Market for cold cash, or use it to build more armies and navies? 
You, and you alone, must make the decisions that will guide your nation
on the road to victory. May the winds of fortune be favorable

Simply put, SUPREMACY is a futuristic global simulation. Each player
controls one SUPERPOWER, and has complete authority over all of its
POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, & MILITARY affairs, including its money supply,
armies, navies, military officers, productivity, foreign relations,
nuclear weapons, high-tech space based weapons, sabotage teams,
biological and chemical weapons, diplomatic relations, short and long
term strategy, and much, much more.

The object of the game is to achieve SUPREMACY. The winner is the last
surviving player, meaning that all other players have either been
destroyed, been captured, or they have gone bankrupt. If a time limit
is set, then the surviving player with the most value is declared the
winner (See Detente).

section, the downloadable 14 meg DEMO is now available.
The latest title in the 5 STAR SERIES from SSI, Star General uses an
enhanced Panzer General engine, that allows the player to wage war
through the galaxy, fighting both in space and on planet surfaces.
Success will require more than just Generalship - fail to properly
manage your planets and technology bases, and you'll find yourself
unable to defend your planets from the hostile races of the Galaxy. Not
a micro-managing nightmare, the resource management aspect of this game
is well balanced: Important enough to win wars, but easily managed
without tedium. 
Features:
First 5-STAR SERIES product to use the enhanced Panzer General game
engine - greatly expanding features and gameplay potential. 
Two-Level Combat System lets players fight among the stars and land on
the planets below for ground-based combat.
Resource Management is a key to success - expand cities, create
factories, research centers, military complexes, and orbital stations.

Network Play Engage in a variety of separate wars, each involving 2 of
the seven races, OR create your own galactic battlefield involving 2 to
7 human or computer players - each representing a different race! The
scope of STAR GENERAL is as vast as space itself, with well over 100
hours of game play.

Use the diplomacy feature to influence your relationship with neutral
races - or disable it and war with everyone! Each of Star General's 7
unique races has its own specialized A.I. plus its own characteristic
sound effects and graphics.

Huge Space & Planet Maps. 100+ Planets to Conquer. 100+ Spaceship
Designs.
200+ Ground and Air Vehicles. Free Scrolling Map.  Split Map / Control
