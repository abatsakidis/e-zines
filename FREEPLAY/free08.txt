Editorial 
-----------
Yup, the newsletter IS getting a heck of a lot longer :) Rather than just
put together a bunch of links and ship them out, I hope you like the new
format. And we will still have lots of game links every issue.

I said in the last issue Quake wasn't going to be a regular feature of
this newsletter.
Well... I lied! I can't help myself. Here we go :) Total Entertainment
Network and Mplayer are fragging each other over offering Quake on
their online services. These two companies haven't gone at each others
throats like in the Netscape Vs. Microsoft browser wars. But, mark my
words, give it time.
As I said in the last issue, there are always alternatives to 'Pay for
Play' for just about any game that can be play on the internet. What is
screwy about these two online game services fighting over Quake is that
it is probably EASIER to just use Qspy, Quake Explorer or other
software to find servers to play Quake, or just hop over to Stomped at
http://www.stomped.com.

What do 'PC Gamer', 'Computing Gaming World', 'Computer Life', and 'PC
World' all have in common?  
1) They are all computer magazines.
2) They all have WWW sites on the internet 
3) In their current issue they all report on Multiplayer internet gaming

The magazines have discovered that you can actually PLAY Multiplayer
games over the internet! Welcome aboard guys!  So what do they cover?
They all report on Total Entertainment Network, MPG-Net, Engage,
America Online(because of their foray into Multiplayer gaming by buying
Imagination Network), Mplayer(won't be free forever,remember, its in
beta test right now), Dwango,  VR-1.

Sure, there are advantages to using the online game services. They
are'hand-holders'.  On Mplayer for example: You download the software
and  when you install it, all the detail work is done for you. The
shareware versions of Terminal Velocity and Warcraft I are included and
setup, the necessary components to play Command & Conquer and MechWarrior
2 are also setup.
Once you have located willing partners, it's a matter of clicking an
icon to load a game and start playing.

The game services are hoping you are willing to PAY for this hand-holding.
I am not sure I would be willing to take that bet. I will discuss my
reasons for that view in another issue.
 
Of the four magazines, which one reported on FREE ways to play games
over the internet? Interestingly enough, it was PC World, a magazine
that is NOT a gaming specific magazine. 
And, I quote from http://www.pcmag.com/features/games/1518/_open.htm

"Representatives of the online gaming services downplay the threat of
free Internet gaming, arguing that few users will accept the slower,
less reliable game performance over "generic" TCP/IP links. They may be
right. But they may also underestimate the power of the word free." -
Michael E. Ryan, PC World

I couldn't agree more. And to end this editorial, that is what the
FreePlay newsletter is all about. Every other week we will point you to
various ways to play multiplayer games over the Internet for free.

 Rambling On - By Scott Grattan
 -----------------
        Well, it's Friday night, and after the introduction I got in the
last newsletter, I guess I'd better get  to writing something, huh?
Suffice it to say that I've been spending a lot of time trying to come
up with a  topic, but after consulting with the editor, we agreed that
maybe a "rambling" approach might be a good start for me, since I've
never actually written anything that was intended to be distributed and
viewed by so many, and hopefully liked!  OK, enough banter, here's what
this week's wanderings turned up.

         SubSpace (http://www.vie.com/subspace) is improving with every
upgrade.  Current version is v1.16, but there's rumored to be another
version coming real soon.  For those of you who haven't tried it, it's
worth the effort.  It's an excellent primer for gaming with other
people on the 'net, and it's completely free (so far).  In SubSpace,
you choose from four different ships, each with their own characteristics.
As you enter the game, you (should) find several  people on your
frequency, whom you can talk to exclusively by sending a team only
message.
   Veterans start forming their own frequencies, and start recruiting
other players in an attempt to dominate the arena. Most of the games
have a type of  "capture-the-flag" theme, but there is a zone where
it's just a free-for-all.  Kill or be killed.
 
         Magic: The Gathering is still trying to make it's way into our
computers.  I can remember trying to play M:tG over IRC, but it was
amazing how many people managed to play Black Lotuses one their first
play.  Hopefully the online version will have a way to moderate the
acquisition of cards so that there's a little bit of fair play involved,
or else it will quickly flop.   This title has been long promised and 
eagerly awaited, and I really don't know what to expect from it when it
finally arrives.  I've long since sold most my cards, since the "magic"
was gone out of the game for me, and most people in my area, quite  a
while ago.  There's a little bit of a write-up (and excuses why they've
delayed it so much) at http://www.holobyte.com/magic/game.html
 
 For the game player who loves sports games, EA Sports is someone you'll
want to keep watching. Check out their home page at http://www.easports.com
index.html.  Be sure to check out the Multiplayer Matchup Registration
to get $10.00 off any of their titles that have modem/network support.
 More on this in next weeks edition.
 
         Here's just the place for all you trivia buffs to test all that
 useless knowledge you've been storing  all these years.  The difference
 being NOW it could actually pay off.  If you're tired of waiting for
 your approval as a contestant on Wheel of Fortune, then check out
 http://www.riddler.com.   I used to have this site bookmarked several months
 ago, but had forgotten it was there.  It has developed substantially,
 and claims to have awarded over $75,000 in prizes to the participants.
 After filling out a lengthy registration form, which they state will not
 be made available for anyone's use but their own,  you'll be allowed to
 enter the games.
 Riddler features:
  KING OF THE HILL - Java Multi-Player Trivia
  CHECKERED FLAG - Java Multi-Player Crossword
  GRIDLOCK - Java Single-Player Crossword
  MENTAL FLOSS - Single-Player Trivia
  THE DAILY RIDDLE - A New Riddle Every Day
  BLOODHOUND - Sniff Out Your CAPS and
  !AHA! - an ActiveX game that requires Internet Explorer, so
  I couldn't check that one out.
 
         Upon registering, you are "sponsored" by one of the many
 sponsors of this site, and given riddlets, the virtual currency you'll
 need to enter the games and buy clues to the answers.  Once you have
 accumulated the required number of a sponsor's CAPS, you can redeem them
 for the specified prize, provided there are still prizes of that type
 available.
 I was given R5000 when I registered.  I'm not sure why, but I'll let you
 know how my winning streak goes.
         If you make it there, watch for my name!  I'm scottig there, but you'll
 have to look near the bottom of the lists to find me, for now.
 
         Well, that's all I've got time for this week.  It's near my
 deadline, so I hope I get this to my editor in time.  I got Mechwarrior
 2: Mercenaries this week, and had every intention of writing a great
 review of it and how great MercNet is for internet play, but couldn't
 get it to work.  From what I understand, only three people HAVE got it
 to work, and two of them work at Activision.  You'll hear more about
 this in the near future too.  Good Gaming!
