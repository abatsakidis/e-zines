 Editorial
 =========
 Sorry, but this will be a SHORT issue compared to the last four. 
 If I screwed up or forgot something, please bear with me. This issue is
 a rush job. I have been on the 'net a total of 30 minutes in the
 last two weeks. This is due to major problems I am having getting
 thru the busy signals to my ISP (internet service provider).
 I can't wait any longer for him to add more modems, 
 so I am in the middle of switching providers. Haven't decided who to 
 switch to yet.

 No Hot Links, Gaming News, Play By Email Games, or Mac specific games,
 this week, BUT I did manage to get some multiplayer JAVA games
 in this issue.
