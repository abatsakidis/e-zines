iNETRiS 2.0 is a Tetris game that runs under Windows 3.1 or Windows 95.
It also supports up to eight players, either across the Internet 
(or local networks that can use TCP/IP addressing via Winsock) or on a 
single computer, or a combination of both. 


2. Hoyle Internet Blackjack - http://sigs.sierra.com/bjanno.htm
-------------------------------------------------------
Beta Test Announcement: Friday July 26, 1996
The Sierra Internet Gaming System is being developed by Sierra to allow
true, real-time, multi-player gaming capability over the Internet; 
Hoyle Blackjack is the first of many Sierra games to take advantage of 
this new technology. If you are a Windows 95 user, we would like to 
invite you to participate in this BETA test. 


3. Siege - 
http://www.im.gte.com./siege/sghmenl.html (to be released)
---------------------------------------------------- 
In the SIEGE game the player will be able to use each character's 
weapons, drive the character's vehicles, and see what each character 
would see. If a character has night vision in the story, then that 
character would have night vision in the game. If a character can fly 
in the story, then the character would fly in the game, and if a 
character can lift tanks in the story, then that character will be able
to lift tanks in the game! 


4. Emperiana - http://www.irealms.com/
--------------------------------------
Infinite Realms On-Line Entertainment, Inc. will host the most dynamic
role-playing adventure games ever put on the Internet. Our first game,
Empiriana, will place you, the player, in a fantastical medieval world. 
Players will be able to access our games from all over the world, using
the Internet and our client software. This software will utilize  
state-of-the-art computer graphics, sound, and music. Empiriana, a 
multi-user role-playing game (RPG), will be based on our game engine 
developed and written for multi-player entertainment. 
Empiriana's First Team beta testers and alternates have been chosen. 
Accepted beta testers should expect an acceptance letter via email. 
If you were not selected, please keep in mind that we had hundreds of 
applications to choose from and only sixty slots to fill. Also, we will
need more testers for the Second and Third Teams. 

5. NetGammon - http://www.nordnet.fr/netgammon/index_usa.html
-------------------------------------------------------
I have wasted many, many HOURS at this thing! The software is well 
worth the time to download. 
The graphics are gorgeous, the software a delight, its menus are well 
thought out, its built-in FIBS (First International Backgammon Server)
connecter works like a charm. To correctly use Netgammon you must have 
the following : 
386+, Windows 3.1 or Windows 95,4 Meg memory,
5 meg disk space , A VGA or SGVA screen, 


6. Backgammon - CyberArts - http://www.cyberarts.com/
-----------------------------------------------------
Ok, so I am a Backgammon fanatic. I am not that great at it, but it 
doesn't hurt my head as much as Chess does. These guys want you to BETA
test their backgammon client for free! 
Here is a quote from their web page:
Please feel free to “test drive” our software during its initial 
introduction. We hope you enjoy the games and we are interested in your
feedback. We do plan to charge for our services. 
The charge will be nominal - and we’ll let you know well in advance. 
So, please “test drive” our first offering, Backgammon. We think you’ll
find it exciting and enjoyable!
And stay tuned for Chess, Hearts and Bridge.

Me again... Hey Internet Gaming Zone already has this all for free. 
But what the hey... Free is good! (while they are in beta). Check it 
out. Runs on Win3.1/95/NT, 8 MB Memory,4MB Disk Space 


7. Beggars' Backgammon Terminal - http://home.ptd.net/~hacksaw/bbgt.html
-------------------------------------------------------
A new version of Beggar's Backgammon Terminal (BBGT) is now availble.  
BBGT is a mouse-driven client for playing backgammon on FIBS (it works 
with NOBS too).  It installs and runs on Windows 3.1 or higher (this 
includes Windows95).


8. The Realm - Sierra Online - http://www.realmserver.com/
-------------------------------------------------------
The Realm is Sierra On-Line’s new graphical, multi-player fantasy 
world. With fully animated male and female characters, Realm players 
may venture through wilderness areas and townships alike. Enter a town 
and visit shops, taverns, temples, and other interesting places. Enter 
the wilderness and journey through forests, swamplands, grasslands, 
mountainous regions, beach areas, and dungeons. Travel alone or travel 
in groups; there are mysteries to uncover and quests to undertake. And,
there are hundreds of other people to enjoy it with, all in real-time!


9. Onslaught - Firebrand Interactive - http://www.webplayer.com/
-------------------------------------------------------
I tried this one out. It's a little confusing at first, but got the 
hang of it quickly.
Works best with Netscape using frames, I think, but any browser 
probably will work. Built-in help to guide lost souls.  No download, 
no fee, just click and play using your webbrowser.

Quote from home page:
OnSlaught, puts you in command of an empire,
fighting for world domination. In our alternative future, diplomacy 
means saving an enemy for last. Start with one city. Build units,
and grow your population. Decide whether your citizens should produce 
bread or guns. Attack opponents, capture their cities, and extend the 
influence of your regime. But let your defenses down, and you risk 
falling prey to an allied force of your enemies. Remember, the enemy is
real. This is not a computer simulation.


10. Virtual Combat - http://www.emeraldni.co.uk/vircom.html
-------------------------------------------------------
Looks like a sort of a primitive DOOM game from the screenshots. 
I haven't personally tested this one but it looks interesting.
Virtual Combat is a multi-player 3d combat game which can be played by
up to 10 players. You walk around a 3d polygon world and try to shoot 
the other players in the game while avoiding getting shot yourself. 
The game can be played over a local area network or across the internet.
 

11. Mplayer - http://www.mplayer.com/join/join-home.html(beta-test)
-------------------------------------------------------
Ok, all you joystick twitchers. 
You say enough with the board games, I wanna play some shootemups
over the net for free!
Well, here ya go.
Again, I wish I could personally test all this stuff, but then I 
wouldn't have time to play backgammon the net. I leave it to you, my 
newsleter subscribers, to get their software and check it out.

They are beta testing Terminal Velocity, Warcraft, Command & Conquer,
and MechWarrior 2 on their servers.

Oh, just a few catches. You MUST have a PENTIUM processor in your 
computer and... America Online, CompuServe, GNN and Prodigy are not 
supported yet.
If you are on any of those services, get off and get a REAL internet 
account! Well, if your stuck you can try PSINet's free trial offer.
They will ship you a CD that includes free PSINet software, Microsoft's
Internet Explorer browser, shareware versions of Terminal Velocity and 
Warcraft I

Here's a quote as usual:

National Sneak Preview is the final phase of beta testing for Mplayer.
So you think you're ready to challenge the most talented opponents to 
the hottest games on the Web? Good, because during our National Sneak 
Preview, Mplayer's software and service are free. 
That's right--go crazy--unlimited play's on us until further notice! 
Our package includes Mplayer software, the shareware versions of 
Terminal Velocity and Warcraft I, and everything you need for a free 
trial of PSINet--the fastest ISP for Mplayer gaming. 
If you already own the retail version of Command & Conquer or 
MechWarrior 2, brace yourself for more multiplayer action.


12. Winsock Game Clients for Windows - http://www.rahul.net/galen/client.html
-------------------------------------------------------
I haven't mentioned much about MUD's, have I?
MUD stands for Multi User Dungeon.
If you have played Zork, then you are already familiar with the concept.
MUD's were the FIRST free multiplayer games on the internet that I 
know of.
Kathleen has put together a first rate web page pointing to CLIENTs to 
make your mudding much easier. These clients can automate many tasks,
keep track of which mud's you use and your passwords.
She also has web links to many MUD resources.
All you need to MUD is a client and a great imagination(games are all 
text).
When you find a MUD client you like, you can visit the following MUDs.


13. TERRAFIRMA -  http://143.117.17.30/TerraFirmA/
(to play, load your favorite mud client and telnet:buster.lboro.ac.uk 8888
-------------------------------------------------------
Enter through the airlocks of your imagination into TerraFirmA.
It's a brave new world in there!

TerraFirmA is a completely revamped AberMUD deriving its original 
design from the Dirt 3.1 code base with over 2400 locations.  This 
world has its own eco-system with changing weather that includes 
everything from deserts to frozen wastes. As you wander around you will
discover very different areas to this world. The main Dome is supported
by five tall airlocks where people enter from the outside. Beginners 
will always start in the central airlock, the hanger, whilst higher 
levels are randomised between the five locations. The random start 
locations are to encourage exploration of the various areas of the world.


14. SubSpace - 
http://www.vie.com/sniper/ (beta-test)
-----------------------------------------------------
Meet people from all over the world 
  . . . then kill them. 

SubSpace is a graphical shootemup which takes place in
outer space. It is a 'capture the flag' type game. 

Current version of SubSpace version 1.05 as of 7/31/96

Quote from home page:
The limit of players in the arenas has been reduced to 60. This will 
mean that SUBSPACE is VERY hard to get into as we are almost always 
full.
We did this for several reasons. This is a small beta test. 
Our bandidth is saturated and this makes gameplay for those IN the 
game very bad. We will not have any more bandwith for at LEAST a week. 
We are very concerned that users will get the impression that gameplay 
in the final product will be this bad and this is not the case.


15. Realms of Despair - http://game.org/
----------------------------------------
is a multiplayer interactive medieval adventure game. 
It  is text based, but supports ANSI color and RIP graphics...  
and can be very addictive.
Can be played by
1. Any telnet client
2. A windows telnet client they have provided
3. On any browser supporting JAVA


16. Europa - http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~anicolao/Europa/
-------------------------------------------------------
Annoucing Europa! A dynamic, multi-player game written for the internet
in Java. This game can be viewed with any Java-capable WWW browser, and
allows you to play a real-time strategic wargame against multiple 
opponents.
