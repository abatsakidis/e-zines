Announcement
------------

We have a new copy editor!
--------------------------
After re-reading and spellchecking this newsletter three hundred and
eight nine times (but, who's counting), I have drafted my wife into
becoming our official Copy Editor. She says "under protest" because he is
NEVER getting off the &#(^%$ computer otherwise!
Among her other duties are rubbing my sore back from leaning over and 
staring at the computer monitor for hours on end!


Goodbye to Geocities. 
---------------------
The FreePlay WWW site is moving to Dragonfire.
The new address will be http://www.dragonfire.net/~freeplay
It will hopefully be up there early January.
It would have been there already but they just suffered a major disk
crash. (on Friday the Thirteenth, wouldn't ya know, with me in the
middle of uploading my html stuff for my WWW pages!).
Once they replace their crashed ftp drive I will archive the FreePlay
newsletters at my anon ftp site there and get the FreePlay WWW site up
There will also be a mirror ftp at ftp.etext.org just in case.
But keep your bookmark set to http://freeplay.home.ml.org
As soon as the WWW stuff is moved to the .org URL will
automagically send you to the new and improved FreePlay home page.

FreePlay Newsletter is now archived at ftp.etext.org
---------------------------------------------------
Issues #1 thru #9 of the FreePlay Newsletter in .zip format are
now available at ftp.etext.org. 
Click on ftp://ftp.etext.org/Pub/Zines/FreePlay
if your email reader supports clicking on URL's or
using your favorite ftp client go to the above.
I will be uploading issues Vol1.10, 1.11, and 1.12 shortly.

Editorial - Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!!
---------
Isn't anybody RELEASING any multiplayer games??? It is getting damn hard
to find recently released online games. Instead, the preview section of
this newsletter has overtaken the online game section!
It used to be Microsoft was THE company to hype their software years in
advance with previews and rumors and private beta tests. They were
accused of issuing vaporware, rumors, and press releases just to try to
control or stop other companies from developing in a specific market
till they got their product released.
Now, its every and all the gaming companies pulling the same stunt.
If this keeps up I will have to rename the newsletter to the
FreePlay Preview of Multiplayer Games newsletter!

We are taking a Holiday Break, so no issue on Dec 30. 
The next issue of the FreePlay newsletter will go out January 13,1997.
Have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

Rambling On - By Scott Grattan.
http://www.gj.net/~scotti
-------------------------
Well, I finally got tired of putting together web pages for other people
and get something up for myself.  If you are looking for something
entirely unexciting, this is the place to go!  I haven't had much time to
put into it, but I'll be working on it, so check in a month or so. If it
still hasn't changed, please email me and tell me to get my ass moving on
it.

Diablo has hit the shelves in some areas, but not here.  I've got every
store in town on auto-dial, in case they forget to call me when it comes
in.  If you've got it, I'm jealous.

Magic: The Gathering has been a much anticipated item, and MicroProse
finally managed to squeeze out a demo!  I think the competition they're
getting from Acclaim to release M:TG is lighting a much-needed fire under
their butts, and hopefully we'll see something before Christmas.  Read
more about it in my reviews in this issue (in the online gaming section).

Computer Player, a magazine (you people DO still read, don't you?) is a
mag that I never really paid much attention to until recently.  They're
getting better and better about their reviews and content of articles.
Now, they're changing their name to Computer & NET PLAYER, and as far as
I know they're the first to claim NET gaming savvy-ness (a word?  it is
now!).  I found myself agreeing with MOST of their reviews, and they
manage to get some real juicy stuff dug up.  In addition to changing
their name, they're also allying themselves with OGR (online gaming
review (http://www.ogr.com)), a well-known source of information when it
comes to up and coming gaming news.  Check them both out!

SkyNET has been taking quite a bit of my time lately.  If you checked
out Future Shock, and weren't impressed, join the club.  But SkyNET has a
lot more playability, and is net-able!  I haven't found anyone to play
yet, but when I do, I'm sure I'll have to sacrifice even more of my sleep
/eat/work time.  Between everything else that's coming out, we're going
to have to start lobbying for longer hours in the day!  If you do have
SkyNET, here's a few things for ya to try:

SkyNET Cheat Codes
------------------
Hit ALT and \ at the same time to be able to enter these codes:
GARBLE          Garble cheat codes toggle
SUPERUZI        Get the Super UZI
ICANTSEE        Show viewscreen
WHOAMI          Shows your name
COUNTERS        Shows current co-ordinates
VERSION         Shows version
HELLO           Shows message: Hello?

If you're REALLY bored, try shooting the moon.  Those guys at Bethesda
must have a lot of free time on their hands!  Go to their homepage
(http://www.bethsoft.com) for the latest patch.  No more dying from
sliding! 

Well, time to get back to acting like I'm working.  Next time I'll have
something to say about Diablo (didn't I say that last time?), as well as
a bunch of other things that are looming on the horizon.  '97 is going
to be an awesome year for games, but I'm sure I'll wind up having to buy
all kinds of neat gizmos for them too.  Such is the burden we gamers face,
but the ride is worth the price of admission!

Happy Puppy
http://happypuppy.com
----------------------
A web site for video game players, last Wednesday Happy Puppy announced
it will shift its editorial coverage to focus exclusively on consumer
gamers.

Coverage of the gaming business, of interest primarily to people within
the gaming industry, will be discontinued.
(FreePlay: the heck with them , I hate all that yellow background on

Programmer fired for unauthorized content in computer game
----------------------------------------------------------
12/06/96 - 10:03 AM ET By The Associated Press_
SAN FRANCISCO - Buxom beauties are fine but buff hunks aren't, a gay
programmer discovered when he got fired for adding some muscle men in
swim trunks to a computer game.

Jacques Sevrin, who worked at Maxis Inc., slipped the unauthorized
characters - who kiss each other on some days - into the new action game
SimCopter, a follow-up to the popular SimCity 2000 game.

In the new game, players fly rescue missions through a complex
3-D city with tiny characters in the background.

"The artist that was working on it made them these standard
female computer-game bimbos, really skimpy shorts, big breasts
- what you'd expect," Sevrin said Wednesday.

The male figures were "really dumpy, little squat middle-aged
types," he said, so he threw in some beefcakes.

The game was released Nov. 20 and 78,000 copies were shipped
before the company discovered the additions.

Sevrin was fired the next day for "adding the unauthorized
content," a violation of company policy, Maxis spokesman
Patrick Buechner said.

The additions also went unnoticed by even hard-core devotees
of the game, said WiredNews, an on-line news service that
first reported Sevrin's firing. New versions of the game,
which will ship starting next week, won't contain the hunks.

Sevrin, 33, said since the company doesn't object to images of
scantily clad women, studly men also should be allowed. He
said there was nothing overtly sexual about his characters.
"These boys in swim trunks just walk around - very rarely, I
might add - except on certain days of the year," he said.

On those dates, which the program automatically reads based on
the computer's internal calendar, include Friday the 13th and
Sevrin's birthday, Sept. 30, as well as Aug. 22, his ex-
boyfriend's birthday.

"On those days, all kinds of things happen. There will be boys
kissing, there will be a greater number of bimbos, there will
be Elvis impersonators. It's really hilarious," he said.

Despite being fired, Sevrin said Walnut Creek-based Maxis was
a fine employer and he never felt any homophobia at the
company.

"I didn't do it out of anger, just kind of 'Why not?' I can't quite
figure out why they would be so angry. It's not a game for kids, it's
for 20-year-olds, " he said. "But you put gay and kids anywhere in the
same sentence and people explode."

Updates -  Take old bugs out, put new ones in
-------

Links LS Patch
http://www.accesssoftware.com/patch.html
----------------------------------------
Links LS update version 1.30 now available!
CHANGES AND FIXES IN LINKS LS VERSION 1.30
Fixed a sound library edit bug.
Fixed a bug introduced by ver 1.10 that stopped the Links LS icon from
working correctly.
Fixed a 'view saved shot' bug.
Fixed a rare ball flight bug caused by a FIFO buffer overflow.
Made a change to allow a 9 hole match play game to finish as soon as the
winner is determined.


Pirates - The Quest for The Seas
http://www.mountainside.com/
--------------------------------
Originally reported in Issue #4, the game has been updated.
The next version of PIRATES is: Version 2.0 (NO LONGER A BETA!!!)
It will be released on or before: December 15, 1996
Some of the features that will be included in this new version are:
Ability to BUILD YOUR OWN SHIP, name it and customize it the
way you like it! Trade cargo space for firepower, trade crew for
cannons, increase the speed and visibility, add an iron hull for
strength, and more!

Improved battles! Movie clips instead of moving cannon balls! Ships
will have "hit points" instead of simply judging the victor by the
number of cannons they have. Each battle will have a cannon round
and a crew round....

Ability to navigate the directories on your PC when opening /
creating PIRATES files. No longer will it be necessary to place all
your PIRATES files in your PIRATES directory!

Ability to store treasure in a fort of the territories that you govern.
No more losing EVERTHING when someone pillages your ship!

You will be able to order your crew to attack any ship that passes by
when it's not your turn. This will allow you to barricade certain
territories, or just become a real menace to society.

When attacking a ship and you lose, the winning player's ship will
suffer some damage. Also, you can do damage to a fort even when
you lose.

Smarter computer players...you'll even be able to tell the game
whether you want the computer players to be able to attack each
other, or whether they form an "alliance". This should make them a
lot tougher!


Plutonium PAK v1.4 to v1.5 Patch
http://www.apogee1.com/catalog/duke3d/dukefix.htm#pak15
-------------------------------------------------------
Please note that if you do not already have the Plutonium PAK v1.4
CD-ROM, you cannot use this patch.

small update to v1.4 fixes some bugs in the game, as well as corrects an
install program problem for people with computers that have 64Mb of
memory or more.

This file is available right now!. You can download it here!. Please
note that this will only update a game that has already been updated with
the Plutonium PAK. If you do not already have the Plutonium PAK CD-ROM,
this patch is not for you.


SubSpace by Virgin Interactive Entertainment
(review by Scott Grattan)
http://www.vie.com/subspace
---------------------------
Another version has been released, and with it several new arenas!  Most
of the changes are purely cosmetic, with new artwork for all the ships.

Two new arenas have been added, so there's sure to be something to keep
you happy in the SubSpace universe. Here's what the latest news.txt has
to say.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 119.
-New ship graphics. (new web art available for those with sites)
-New help/tutorial screens.
-Teammates now give you no points if you kill them.
-Suicides now impossible but you CAN damage yourself severely.
-Packetloss scheme implemented to even out connections. This should
allow people with bad connections to stay logged on in all but FLAG ZONES.
-Names containing naughty words now blocked ,you bad people :)
-Flags now do not appear until after the first minute you enter the game.
-Subspace.exe now separated from art & sound files. I future revs this will
allow for much smaller updates.
-In some zones you will get a %of you own bounty added to your kill(10-20%).
This is an incentive to stay alive with high bounty.
-Packetloss is now much more tolerant for spectators. 
-loads of bug fixes as per usual.

And here's the info on new zones:

SPEED ZONE
This new zone is for the player who does not have much time but wants to
be able to win a game. The game lasts for 1 hour and after that time the
person with the highest score wins. In this game the following commands
are available.?time = time left in game
?best = your personal best.
To speed up gameplay players start with 30 bounty in this zone.
When you enter game or the game ends your score is reset but your best
is recorded. These bests will be posted in the biweekly winners table.

TURF ZONE (this one will take some fine tuning)
This strategic zone is similar to the game "risk" in concept. 200 fixed
flags are distributed around the map. 20 man teams compete to grab and
defend territory. Every 10 mins or so you get points depending on how
many flags your team owns. The map is designed to be able to make
defensive "fronts" thus good squads (even small ones) can stake out their
turf and defend it. We hope that this game will be a good start for
ownership subgames. We will see.

----------------------------------------------
Into the Void is a space strategy game that allows players to build their
empire by exploring remote star systems, colonizing new exotic worlds,
and building fleets of starships. Along the path of conquest, alien races
will make contact and try to prevent your civilization's rise. Increase
your technology by researching. As your technology grows, so too will
your reach into the stars. The dark uncharted reaches of space are yours
for the taking. At risk is your entire civilization. As you venture...Into
The Void.

With the development of the first rudimentary "Hyperspace Portal", faster
-than light space travel has become a reality. You must create a galactic
empire by building fleets of starships. Exploring remote star systems and
colonizing new exotic worlds. But your are not alone. Other races in the
galaxy have the same desires. In the race to populate worlds you must
choose from a number of different options. You may need mighty forces to
fend off an enemy attack or to take another planet by military force.
Perhaps powerful negotiation would produce better results? A statesman's
approach may also be useful...or perhaps covert espionage. The ultimate
success of your race depends on you.

Fully networkable for up to ten players via local area networks or the
internet, through e-mail.
Super VGA Graphics with high resolution 3-D rendered starships and
facilities, combined with challenging strategic gameplay.

Myth (W95,MAC)
http://www.bungie.com/prpages/myth.html
---------------------------------------
Bungie PULLS THE LID OFF...Myth 
A river of blood runs through it 

CHICAGO, IL - December 5, 1996 -
What does a company known for 3D, first-person action games do when they
want to make a game depicting the clash of armies, the wheeling of
formations and the savagery of melee? They make Myth. Bungie's upcoming
game Myth is the first example of a fully multimetric realtime tactical
game, and it will stun gamers with the full-on experience of epic battle.

Free of a static isometric view, Myth players orbit around the heads of
their units, zoom in for a closeup on a melee, pan past a long column of
troops and fly over the landscape in any direction. The action takes
place in a world of truly 3D terrain and objects. From the moment players
see drifting clouds reflected in the water or the ground ripple and
deform from the shockwave of an explosion, they will know they are in a
place no computer game has gone before.

The gameplay focusses on tactics. Instead of spending time collecting
resources and building up structures and armies, players command groups
of units who are thrust into battle with enemy forces. Mastery of
formations and disciplined unit movement is critical to survival, where
large scale maneuvers end with the fury of hand to hand combat. Myth
depicts the carnage of the battlefield in all its awful glory, with
fountains of blood coating the landscape, heads rolling down hills and
chunks of meat and bone flying through the air trailing gore—all
according to the most detailed and realistic physics model of any game
on the market.

Cross-platform networking will allow players to battle with small strike
teams or mighty legions, while Bungie's MetaServer makes playing over
the Internet as easy as over the office LAN. Myth will include maps
designed specifically for network play, and alternate networking
scenarios like Assassin, Capture the Flag, King of the Hill and more. The
game is easily customized with a user-programmable scripting language
based on Java(TM) that will allow users to write their own scripts to
reprogram monsters, change game constants, even change the rules of
netgames.

Myth will require a Pentium with Windows(R) 95 or PowerPC running Mac(TM)
OS, 16-bit color and a CD-ROM drive. The game will be released in 1997.
This is the only accurate information available about its release date.

The Tone Rebellion (W,W95)
http://www.tonerebellion.com/
-----------------------------
They say it is darkest before the dawn. The Tone Rebellion provides no
exception as you start out alone and isolated, struggling for deliverance
on one of the 15 remaining islands. As a floater, you begin mining Tone,
rebuilding bases and resources for the ensuing battle for deliverance
from the hands of the Leviathan.

The Leviathan immediately seeks to defeat the resurgent clans. If you are
successful, your efforts will lead to the discovery of mystical links to
other lands where you'll find other floater species. Cooperating with
other floater clans, you will be able to build on each other's strengths
to further your cause against the Leviathan. And yet, the Leviathan's
strength grows with each success you achieve and the dawn is still a
distant dream.

With superior animation, incredibly detailed graphics and a powerful
original sound track, The Tone Rebellion promises to surpass other real
time strategy games. This, combined with a multiplayer option, makes The
Tone Rebellion a sure thing for gamers seeking a new age of entertainment.
Requirements not available at this time.
Ask for The Tone Rebellion starting in April, 1997.

Electronic Knockout - An Internet Boxing Game(any WWW browser)
http://www.vivi.com/eko/
------------------------
Electronic Knock Out, or "EKO", is a boxing simulation game run over the
Internet. You create fictional fighters and manage their careers.
You begin by creating a stable of fighters. Different fighters have
different abilities. You keep "re-rolling" a fighter until you get a set
of abilities you like. Then you give him a name, a description, and tell
him how to fight in each bout.

Every weekend your fighters are matched against other players' fighters.
You are notified 5-7 days in advance so you can scout your opponents and
devise strategies.

All fights take place off-line -- you get the results by email. This
includes a blow-by-blow account of the fight and how the fight was scored.
Results of every fight are on-line and can be viewed with your web
browser. There have been 13,485 bouts between 4,981 fighters managed by
over 1,400 players! Every fight in EKO history, and every fighter ever
created can be viewed on-line.

Fighters are ranked in each weight division and each region. Your goal
is to push your fighter as far up the rankings as possible and,
ultimately, to create a "World Champion".

Managers role play between bouts by issuing press releases. 
EKO is currently free. Each manager can manage up to three fighters. In
the future, EKO will be partially commercialized -- each manager will be
allowed to manage one fighter for free, but will be charged a fee for
additional fighters.

Magic: The Gathering for Windows '95 by Microprose
(review by Scott Grattan)
http://www.microprose.com/gamesdesign/magic/magic.html
------------------------------------------------------
Magic: The Gathering, based on Wizards of the Coast, Inc.πs popular
trading card game of the same name, is now an interactive computer game.
Not only can you duel the computer AI and fine-tune your decks, but a new
Sid Meier-designed strategy card  game environment provides an
introduction for new players while challenging the most experienced
Magic:The Gathering fans.

The demo is available (14M), and the computer is a very worth opponent.
However, it is rumored that this will not have the options to play online,
which was going to be a big deal for all us M:TG players!  I couldn't
find any mention of this (to either confirm or deny), but I'll let you
know when I do!  However, MicroProse took too long, because someone else
has come along to pick up the Magic gauntlet and accept the challenge...


Magic: The Gathering - Battlemage by Acclaim
(review by Scott Grattan)
http://www.acclaimnation.com/acclaimnation/twitch/interactive/magic/MAGICinter.html
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(how's that for an easy to remember URL?)
                         A maniacal warmonger,
                         Six powerful wizards,
                   and legions of magical beasts....
              Welcome to Magic: The Gathering - BattleMage

A devastating planeswalker war rages across the continent of Corondor.
Ravidel, a mighty planeswalker, has gone insane from grief and betrayal.
He now seeks the destruction of all other planeswalkers and the conquest
of the land itself. 

Sound good?  Check out the URL above, and read the entire thing!  It
sounds like an incredible journey, with two modes of play available.  The
Duel mode allows up to four player (computer or human) to build decks and
slug it out (via LAN, modem, or internet).  Acclaim is porting this to
the Sony Playstation and the Sega Saturn, and they can use
split-screen to play.  Although, how you keep someone from seeing your
cards I can't imagine.

The campaign mode allows you (a planeswalker) to conquer territories and
acquire artifacts and spells, and to interact with "more than 90 beings
from the Magic: The Gathering universe".

I can tell you that (as a recently recovered M:TG'er, I'm more
interested in the Acclaim version, simply for the multi-player and
'nettable aspect. MicroProse has taken entirely too long, even with the
addition of Sid Meier to design their playing environment.  I've been
waiting for MicroProse to get this thing out for more than a year now.  I
didn't even KNOW Acclaim was working on something until just the last
month, and they're saying it's being released this week!  More on that
later!


Tsarwars
http://204.194.39.10/
---------------------
Tsarwars is a multiuser, multiplayer, space/war/strategy game. Within
the game there are only about 30 commands. Learning to play is easy. You
will start out in a "sector" of space. That sector will connect to other
sectors which you can enter by clicking on their sector numbers. You can
dock at ports and make money trading. When you encounter other players
you can attack them. You can build starbases and deploy fighters to
guard sectors or spy on passersby -- or charge them tolls. You can
travel to other galaxies via wormholes, pulsars, or hyperspace, and try
to take one over, make it your personal kingdom, and defend it from other
players. Or, you can wander the Universe like a nomad, going wherever
the wormhole takes you, trading, gambling, and amassing your own personal
fleet of fighters. You can enter into an alliance with others and attempt
to rule the entire Universe....


Ultimate Warrior
http://134.83.128.48/~empgdda/ad/uwhome.htm
-------------------------------------------
Ultimate warrior is a new Strategic Weapons Combat Fighting Game. Set in
the mid 14th century, your character battles for the right to fight the
evil Warrior of Mukia. Although at first, it could be mistaken for a
typical fighting game, that is far from the truth. 

This is one of the best 2D fighting game you will ever see or play. All
our efforts have been built on previous experience to make this so. For
example there are around 10 different warriors to choose from, however,
weapons and amour can be changed, providing a net total of over 1000
(yes one thousand) different character configurations. Nobody has ever
come even close to achieving this kind of feat in a fighting game.

Gameplay has been given as much consideration as the graphics, each
character has a novel move combo construction system which provides each
one with over 120 different combo moves. This means that each character
moves exactly how you would want it to and exactly when you want it to.
The moves are all carefully designed to provide the best in gameplay and
feel.

Ultimate warrior is not just another fighting game. It is a unique
concept incorporating a number of novel features, providing an original
game experience which will undoubtedly prove popular amongst all game
players.

Humor  - Something to make you laugh while you are gaming
-----
(originally posted in Issue #4, but we have so many new subscribers who
haven't seen this and I thought it was appropriate after the news release
about the programmer who got fired from Maxis for putting those cute
Easter eggs in the release of SimCopter
Posted with permission from Corey Lewis <Corey.Lewis@DALSEMI.COM>


Top Ten New Games That Maxis is Considering to Produce

10.  Sim Vaporware - (to win you must spend months developing a game,
     while at the same time relentlessly advertising it, only to pull
     the plug when customer anticipation is peaked)

 9.  Sim NFL  -  (must get through 10 seasons without being busted for drugs,
     wife beating, solicitation of prostitutes, steroid abuse, DWI, or child
     molestation --- reportedly is going to be a very tough game.)

 8.  Sim Widget  (become the world's largest and most powerful widget mogul.)

 7.  Sim Televangelest (speaks for itself)

 6.  Sim Solid Waste Treatment Facility (Dive in to this one and experience life
     at its most pungent)

 5.  Sim Park Ranger - (Yes, you too can live the exciting life of a Forest Park
     Ranger.  Experience the surge of adrenaline as you ticket people for
     unlicensed fishing and for cutting trees for camp firewood.)

 4.  Sim Homeless - (Prowl the streets, and never worry about paying rent.
     Make decisions such as should I eat the Beets and Corn soup at the
     shelter?  Or should I search the dumpster behind the Pizza Hut?)

 3.  Sim Porn Video Director - (see #7 above)

 2.  Sim Junk Yard - (organize ad campaigns to bring in loyal customers so they
     will see that your junk is better than the competition.  Bonus points for
     recycling and separating plastics, glass, and aluminum.)

 1.  Sim City 2000 *Ghetto Edition* - (create the inner-city hell of your
     dreams.  Gang shootings, turf wars, crack houses, government project
     housing facilities...all this and more.  May be a "Crip" and "Blood"
     option for added replay value.)
