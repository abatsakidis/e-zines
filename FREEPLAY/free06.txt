Announcement
============
If you have been a regular reader of FreePlay, you have
read about my problems with getting this newsletter out.
I was spending as much time verifying subscriber address due
to bounces, adding news subscription requests, and resending 
issues to users who wrote me that they never received the latest
issue, as I was researching and writing the newsletter itself! 
Hopefully, all my newsletter distribution problems are solved. 
Thanks to Stephan Waseleski, this edition, and all future editions
will be mailed from Majordomo@marit.cypronet.com.
Subscribe/Unsubscribe instructions are at the end of the newsletter.


Editorial 
=========
Changes to the newsletter:
I have separated online gaming and e-mail gaming sections.
No online gaming links this issue. The next regular issue is due out
on Oct 5, 1996, and I am putting WWW links together for it right
now.  But, I decided to send out this issue early since I came 
across so many interesting news items.

It is getting impossible to keep up with the multiplayer world of 
the internet! I think it was Jimmy Durante who once said....
"Everybody wants in on the act!"
This holds true for gaming on the internet. Huge companies such as
Microsoft, and little 'mom and pop' startups are looking at the 
internet gaming world with visions of dollar signs in their eyes. 
Gaming companies are buying each other out, merging, and forming new 
ventures. Even non-internet gaming companies such as SEGA are 
forming internet divisions. The major video game platforms (Nintendo,
Sega) are shortly coming out with additional  peripheral devices to
hook their game consoles to the net.

We all know these companies are not coming to the internet with
their games to be a good sport! They want to make money off your
internet gaming. 
It is my opinion that there is money to be made IF and that is a 
big qualified "IF",they charge flat rates of no more than $10 a
month for their game services. Any per hour charges will be met
with quite a bit of resistance.

Interview on Arcadium with Bill Hodder
http://www.arcadium.com
-----------------------
Mplayer Thursday, September 19 at 3:00pm Hosted by Bill Hodder 
I was there and here is some questions I asked.
The full transcript is available at http://www.arcadium.com
Mplayer is a commercial gaming network for PCs that allows members to play
such games as Command & Conquer, MechWarrior 2, Terminal Velocity, and
warcraft against multiple opponents over the internet. 

Q: what other games are you considering
adding besides Quake?
A: In the short term we will have Deadlock,
C&C Covert Ops, Big Red Racing, and Quake.
Longer term, we will have lots of other great
games.

Q: when will Quake be available on mplayer?
A: Quake should be available real soon
we are just working out the final tweaks.

Q: will there eventually be a flat
one-time price for mplayer?  the costs could really
mount up if we have to pay monthly rates to a provider
and to mpath.
A: Final pricing has not been determined, but
there will probably be some type of flat rate
price.

Q: is there or will there be any
rankings of players in the various games? iD just
announced new server software that does player
rankings
A: Yes...we will have rankings and results for 
all of the games on Mplayer, auto updated
after the game is completed.

Business Week - 09/23/96
Special Report: MAKING MONEY ON THE NET
By Kathy Rebello in San Mateo, with Larry Armstrong in Los Angeles.
Entertainment companies, including MPath and Total Entertainment Network
(TEN), plan to start charging users of online games $2 or so for each 
hour of play--and will offer volume discounts for heavy users. 3DO, a 
maker of video games, will begin charging $9.95 a month in October for
access to its Medieval game world, Meridian 59. Genie Interactive and 
Imagination Network, which was recently bought by America Online Inc.,
also will launch subscription-based entertainment sites this fall.


id Software Makes the Sport of Multiplayer Gaming a Reality with the
Launch of QUAKEWORLD
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 19, 1996--id Software is once again 
shaking up the online gaming industry today by offering "a gift to Web
gamers"  in the form of QUAKEWORLD(TM), id's new Internet action gaming
environment, optimized for brutal deathmatching.
QUAKEWORLD will offer gamers real-time competition over the Internet,
complete with accurate team ranking and statistics and superior multiplayer
gameplay based on their new blockbuster PC title, QUAKE(TM).
"QUAKEWORLD legitimizes Internet bragging rights,"  said Carmack.
"Therefore, if anyone claims to be one of the top 10 best QUAKEWORLD
players, they have the record to back it up.  We can also use this data
to post stats like greatest frags per minute, longest uninterrupted 
QUAKE game, cruelest to newbies, etc.  This structure will be essential
to the continuing growth and evolution of the online gaming community."


3DO - Meridian 59
http://www.3do.com:80/company/press_releases/netscape.html
==========================================================
(full text available at above url)

accounts in more than 65 countries during its beta trial, is the 
first product to ship under 3DO's newly developed Internet operation. 
The company is currently creating several entertainment products for the
Internet space that are expected to become available in 1997. 
(not mentioned in this article is the fact they have TEN other games

Jupiter Communications - The Future of Online Gaming Report
----------------------
The online and Internet games market will grow rapidly over the next 
few years, becoming a revenue source to be reckoned with in the overall
online/Internet industry, according to the Online and Internet Games
Report, published by Jupiter Communications. The online and Internet 
games market represents merely 2.5 percent of overall online/Internet 
industry revenues for 1996, but is expected to increase to over 11 percent
of total industry revenues by the year 2000.

Revenues in the online and Internet games market will be derived from 
a variety of sources, including pay-per-hour charges, advertising on
games-related Web sites, subscriptions, and pay-per-play revenues. The
online and Internet games market differs from the market for standalone,
or boxed, games market in a very important way: users do not need to
purchase a game outright to play it; rather, consumers are overwhelmingly
willing to pay as they go to play a game online, similar to the way the
market for coin-operated games has developed.
Overall, Jupiter estimates that revenues from pay-per-play charges and
advertising, which each accounted for one percent or less of the market
revenues in 1995, will account for 37 percent and 25 percent,
respectively, of total online and Internet games market revenues by the
year 2000.

Consumers will be accessing games content online via a variety of methods:
via the Web, on games services such as Mpath and Total Entertainment
Network; via the consumer online services, such as AOL; through direct
dial-up networks, such as DWANGO; and, finally, via standalone games
consoles that have been upgraded for greater interactivity. One example of
this is NetLink for the Sega Saturn platform, wherein gamers can access
the Web from their living rooms.

Jupiter believes that from this multitude of options there will emerge
a market in the millions -- nearly 10 million by the year 2000, in fact 
of households in the U.S.

The online and Internet games market has attracted attention from many
of the giants of interactive entertainment, including Sony and America
Online as well as a large amount of investment capital to fund small 
start-ups that specifically address the games niche.

It used to be that online gamers were an overwhelmingly young and male
constituency. As the genres of online games shift beyond text-based
role-playing games (RPGs) and "twitch" action games, online games are
appealing to a broader demographic.

Online and Internet Games Report details the technological side of the
online and Internet games market -- including the dual problems with
bandwidth, the speed at which data travels via telephone lines or cable,
and network latency, or wait-time. Jupiter analyzes the possible
breakthroughs in cable modems, ADSL, and other technologies, and suggests
ways to limit network latency. The report sells for $895. To order, or to
obtain a full brochure including a table of contents, call 800-488-4345 or
visit Jupiter's Web site at http://www.jup.com.
Jupiter Communications, LLC, is a privately held research and consulting
firm that was established in 1986. From its offices in downtown New York
City, Jupiter's 45 employees create and market products that provide
research and strategic insight for companies focused on the consumer
market for interactive products, services and technologies.

unit) REALLY means one tank and so on! And you can move your units 
many times (if there are enough movement points, of course) in one 
turn. So you can also fire when you want, move n hexes and fire 
again... I really like that kind of playing! (btw:game is still 
turn-based, but this doesn't matter!)

 switch through the course of a campaign and many more updates

build armies and participate in the endless battles fought between
1846-1905. Two entire campaigns are devoted to the American Civil
War, while 4 deal with the expansion of the British Colonial Empire,

But the time has come for change. A new order is in the wind 
-- AND IT WILL BE BORN OF FIRE!
War Wind(TM) allows you to view this epic racial struggle through the
eyes of the four unique races involved. This REAL TIME strategy 
masterwork will feature 30 ready-to-play scenarios.
