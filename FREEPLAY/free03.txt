    Editorial - Play by Email, Growing Pains, Listserv
    ---------
    Play by Email:
    A subscriber wrote to me about play by email games and my lack of
    mentioning them in the newsletter.  Ooops.  Glad to oblige. 
    I have included a bunch of ways to get to and play 'play by email' games in
    this newsletter. 

    Growing Pains:
    The FreePlay newsletter is now at over two hundred subscribers 
    and adding about 5 more a day. I have crashed every email program 
    I tried for Windows 3.1/95. Juno has a tendency to mangle email 
    ids when you add them to your address book, Netscape Navigator 3.x 
    has the worst d*m address book ever conceived, Pegasus just confused
    me, and many others didn't have Blank Carbon Copy. 
    I finally settled on hotmail.com to maintain the subscriber list and
    mailing until I can get on to a listserv.
    You can find them at http://www.hotmail.com get your own free email id. 

    Listserv:
    Now for the exciting part (to me anyway). 
    I am in negotiations with a company to move this whole 
    newsletter to a listserv. 
    Once setup, this will take care of the work of maintaining a mailing
    list and I will be able to concentrate on the newsletter.
    If this comes true, I just might make FreePlay a WEEKLY
    newsletter(maybe). So, If you get an email saying you have been subscribed to
    FreePlay, that is just me putting you on the listserv.

    Gaming News:
    ------------
    Dulles, VA Aug. 6, 1996 -- 
    America Online, Inc. today announced the acquisition of
    multiplayer games innovator The ImagiNation Network, Inc. 
    (INN) from AT&T. The move will dramatically expand AOL's 
    online games offerings and strategically position AOL and
    INN in the effort to establish an industry-leading platform 
    for multiplayer games. INN, which launched the first dedicated
    online games service in 1991, has been a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of AT&T since 1994.
    Full details available at http://www.inngames.com/Pr/index.html#Pr7

    Previews: 
    ---------
    Welcome to the Preview section or the not-ready-for-prime-time review.

    Engage! - http://www.gamesonline.com/index2.html
    ------------------------------------------------
    If these guys get their act together, this will be one heck of a 
    place to play games over the net. They will featuer online version 
    of many games from InterPlay(R).
    The screen shots of their propietary games look awesome
    They are also looking for beta testers and sysops to maintain the games. Most
    likely it will be free while in beta test and afterwards will be based on some
    charge per month plus per hour charges.
    No hardware requirements are mentioned.

    Quote:
    Most of ENGAGE's games are worldwide exclusives, including such best
    sellers as Descent, Castles II and Avanced Dungeons & Dragons: Dragon Dice from
    Interplay as well as MUD II from Dr. Richard Bartle, the founder of MUD Games. 
    Titles from other content partners will be announced over the coming
    weeks and months. ENGAGE will offer as many as 15 games by the end of
    1996 and then plans to add about one additional game each month. 
    We're looking for a few good sysops to help us build the ENGAGE online
    games network. 
    If you love to play high-end multiplayer games, enjoy helping others,
    and have good communications skills with the confidence to back them up, we
    want to talk to you. 
    Our Customer Service team is actively recruiting sysops to help run all the
    cool games and entertainment content we're developing for ENGAGE. 
    Compensation will depend on how experienced you are and how much time
    you have to give. 


    VR1 Entertainment Channel - http://www.vr1.com/
    -----------------------------------------------
    I stumbled across this one just web surfing. 
    Look like an interesting site. But it is heavy on
    graphics and low on content and information at this time.
    Everything is 'in development'.
    Hope the games they will be releasing look as nice as the
    Web page.
    They are taking beta tester applications.

    Here's a quote:
    VR-1 is the source for online, multiplayer entertainment.
    VR-1 is the developer of Air Attack and other multiplayer
    games. Also, be sure to check out Digital Comics, the
    Internet's first online comic books. 


    The World of Avalia - http://www.games-online.com/avalia/
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    One of my Apple Macintosh subscribers bemoaned the lack of
    multiplayer games for his machine. He is right. There aren't
    that many. I searched high and low and I did find this.
    This game is about to go into beta test. I am assuming the
    cost will be free while in beta test.
    After that who knows.....

    Quote from home page:
    July 25 Games Online Inc. 
    (GO!) a fast growing IGP (Internet Game Provider)
    announces "The World of Avalia(tm)", the Internet's very 
    first Macintosh, Multi-Player graphical RPG adventure system.
    The World of Avalia(tm) is a unique gaming system. 
    >From the ground up, it has been designed to contain multi-player
    Appletalk(tm) and Internet playability. This innovative role 
    playing game has a top-down perspective view in the classical
    style of computer based RPGs. The game will offer online 
    Macintosh(tm) users interaction with hundreds of simultaneous
    players when connected to the Games-Online Network. When played 
    at home, users can play in either single player
    mode, or with up to 4 players on an Appletalk local network


    Prey - http://www.apogee1.com/
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    In the YADC (yet another Doom clone) group is Prey. 
    Quote:
    Prey is designed from the ground up with cutting-edge multiplayer 
    capacity in mind.  Prey can be played over modem, a LAN ,WAN ,the
    Internet. Players will be able to join and leave games in progress 
    without affecting other players. 
    Prey will support Comm-bat (same as DeathMatch), co-op and team modes. 
    Players can also log on as observers, who can travel the game world 
    invisibly and unscathed, while watching all of the mayhem
    take place. 


    Blood - http://www.3drealms.com/
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    3D Realms...Why bother going on with this one? Been there, done that.
    Add this one to your YADC(yet another Doom clone) list.
    Graphics look nice or at least the screen shots do.

    Quote:
    In addition to its terrifying single player mode, Blood features the 
    funniest (you heard us right) head-to-head gameplay available. 
    Take a cigarette lighter and aerosol can to your friends, or ram a 
    pitchfork through their bellies. If Duke Nukem' 3D Dukematch and Quake
    deathmatch make you laugh, wait till you get a taste of BLOODBATH! 
    Play a friend over the modem or hook up as many as eight players over 
    an IPX-compatible network. You can even play over the Internet. 
    No specs yet on hardware requirements available. They will probably be
    similar to requirements for Duke Nukem 3D.


    Battle.Net - http://www.blizzard.com/bnet/bnet.htm(preview)
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    Quote from home page:
    Blizzard Entertainment makes gaming on the Internet as simple
    as pressing a single button. Battle.net provides an arena for
    Blizzard customers to chat, challenge opponents and initiate
    multiplayer games, at no cost to the user. Blizzard charges no
    hourly or monthly fees, and there is no startup charge.
    To access battle.net, players simply select the Internet option
    from the game's main screen, and they are automatically connected
    to the service. Once logged on, users can compete head-to-head
    against players from around the world over the Internet. 
    TCP/IP access to the Internet is required, and players are 
    responsible for applicable on-line access fees that may be charged 
    by their Internet Service Provider. The battle.net service will be accessible
    24 hours a day, seven days a week. Different channels allow players of varying
    skill levels to match wits with opponents of comparable abilities. Diablo, due
    out later this fall for the IBM-PC, will be the first product to support
    battle.net, with Starcraft following this Christmas. 
    Macintosh gamers will want to check 
    http://www.blizzard.com/news.htm for news of when games will be
    available for the Mac.

    Quote from home page:
    The server will automatically maintain a history of your games 
    as well as a picture of the boards. Each time a player
    moves, a copy of the board will be sent to each of the players
    in that game. If you want to peek at the status of someone
    else's game or just check up on one of your own to make sure
    you haven't missed some e-mail, use each game's 'show'
    command. The server will respond to queries to recall the 
    history and position of any of its boards.

    Guess what was in the mail when I brought it home?
    My PC-GAMER Magazine and CD-Rom. And.. on the CD-Rom disk was the
    shareware version of Quake. What timing. 
    I barely found time to finish the newsletter! 
    I'm hooked.

    Everything you could ever want to find out about ID's Quake is on these two WWW

    downloading the software, FAQ's, editors, utilities, 
    cheats, secrets, walk-thrus and anything else there is for Quake can be found
    on these web pages. 
    There are many more Web pages dedicated to the game Quake but I liked
    these the best.
