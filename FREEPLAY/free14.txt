Announcement - FreePlay newsletter featured at CompuServe
------------

I received an email a short time ago from one of the forum sysops on
CompuServe as follows:

"I just recently subscribed to your FreePlay Multiplayer Internet Gaming
Newsletter and I've really enjoyed what I've seen.  I am a staff member
in the Internet Fun Forum (GO INETFUN) on CompuServe.  Our forum is
devoted to directing people to and discussing fun things to do on the
Internet.  Your newsletter is exactly the sort of content we are looking
for to offer in our Ratings & Reviews and our Online Games Sections."

I'm a soft touch when it comes to compliments! So, we worked out the
details. The FreePlay newsletter will be available in those two sections
(Ratings & Reviews, and Online Games) and will be available for download
as follows:

Members of CompuServe can download the FreePlay newsletter from Library

EDITORIAL - Just a couple of notes
---------

I have some things I am working on for next couple of issues and they
are rather long. Since this issue is already a big one, I will hold off
till the next issue. The editorials will be about multiplayer gaming,
the musical chairs the programmers at the various software companies are
playing, the coming "online game service" wars (TEN is already putting
down battle.net saying their service will provide better latency/ping
times for Diablo), and how this has all been made possible by the now
standard $19.95 per month unlimited Internet access (or if you are an AOL
member the unlimited busy signals; or if you a CompuServe member, sorry
no flat rate). It's already getting long just describing it :)

If you haven't checked out Engage (http://www.engage.com, mentioned in
the last issue), you should soon. Their beta testing will end around
March 15th. After that they go commercial: no more free beta-testing.

After our Assistant Editor Scott's review of Diablo, and after playing
the shareware version on my magazine game CD-ROM, and with my credit
cards paid off and burning a hole in my wallet... Well...
I bought the retail version of Diablo. (Grabbed the last one off the
shelf, hah!, almost knocked over some kid eyeballing it..."Mommy!!!")
I have discovered one thing. Don't play Diablo in multiplayer mode
online and plan on do anything else (like writing a newsletter) for a
while. "Yeah, that's the ticket, I'll just check out how good Diablo is
for playing over the Internet, then work on the newsletter." Yeah, right,
uh huh. Three hours later my wife is yelling "Did you finish the
newsletter yet? The Superbowl is almost on!". Oh shoot... But I'm almost
at level 5! Well... back to the newsletter... after Green Bay kicks some
butt... and I live in New England :)

Rambling On - By Scott Grattan
-----------
Another two weeks have gone by again???  What the hell have I been doing
that I didn't notice that my column and reviews were due?  Could it be 
Diablo?  SubSpace maybe?  Planetary Raiders?  Could it have been all of 
the above...???

Ok, so maybe I'm getting a little melodramatic, but I'm building up for
a reason.  No, really!  I am!  I just want to plead my innocence and say
that I'm cutting it this close to deadline is for one simple reason:

A virus...

OUCH!!!  And this wasn't one of the little run-of-the-mill buggers
either! Anti-EXE, and it did some stuff that I couldn't fix no matter
what I did.
Removing it was easy enough, fixing the damage was impossible (for me
anyway, and I'm supposed to be some kind of computer tech!).  The short
of it is this: I had to delete and re-install Windows '95, losing all my
settings. I know I could have backed it up, but I didn't have idea one
what files were corrupted (keyboard remapped and modem nowhere to be
found), and I was so frustrated that I justified my actions at the time. 
I'm sure some of you out there can relate to the satisfaction of typing:
DELTREE WINDOWS

So, after a few days of scrambling to recover, and the rest of them
trying to remember what I had and what I really want/need back, I'm just
now getting to a point where I can function again.  Moral of the story
is thus: backup stuff!  And you want to know the best way to back things
up?  My latest investment has been an incredible useful tool, and well
worth the small cost!  Check out Iomega's ZIP drives!  'nuff said... on
to the gaming!

Despite my recent problems, I have found some time to spend online with
Diablo!  (oh yeah, after deleting Windows, and getting back into Diablo,
I was informed by fellow gamers that your character is saved in the
\windows directory somewhere.  So...my character was lost to the great
abyss..)  I've managed to build another character that is to be feared,
and am still enjoying this game immensely.  So much, in fact, that I
nearly neglected to work on my single player character!  If you're just
jumping online (and from the people I've chatted with online, I know
there are a few), and not playing the single player mode, you're missing
out!  There's a lot of things that happen in the game that you will not
see in MP (multi-player).  There's an awesome storyline, and that's a big
part of gaming for me!

Since the release of Diablo, I haven't spent anywhere near as much time
as I had been in SubSpace (http://www.vie.com/subspace), but I was bored
a little the other night, and logged in.  Much to my delight, v1.20 had
been released, and it's awesome!  
Check out http://www.vie.com/subspace/team/rod/scen/scen.htm for the
first subspace scenario "Battle for Juno"

Phew! What a few weeks! 

version 120.
BUG FIXES
Lost score bug. Hopefully nailed this one. Sorry for the pain it has
caused.
Hardrive access bug. Addressed it. let us know if it works with everyone.
false lockouts should now be fixed. Sorry bout that guys.
Banner bug (pallete) - fixed.
Multifire - If you didn't take advantage of it, now you never will.
Speed Zone - no more zone swapping, you bad people ;) Zone winners -
Finally fixed. (phew) Repels - still unreliable weapons (they are meant
to be) but will be more effective when they go off.

NEW FEATURES
o 2 new ships
o Terrier - fires twin guns. About as maneuverable as a leviathan.
Weasel - Can detect mines on radar. Fires EMP bombs which stop an enemy
from recharging. your EMP bombs can also affect YOU if you fire too close.
o ROCKET pickup. Hit F3 and off you go!!!
o Dissolve squad feature, menu option. (only the creator can dissolve a
squad)
o Super duper background graphics. These can be turned OFF in the
view/options menu.
o New fly under/over tiles + secret door tiles implemented. Expect the
maps to be updated with them in the next few days.
o In running zone flags now get dropped where a player lost connection.

o In warzone music now plays when a team has all flags and is about to
drop em.

o Bomb code improved. Fear the leviathan.

o SHIFT+PG/UP PG/DN now flips down the player list by a page.

o Oh yeah and we re did all the ship graphics again. 

NEW PLAYER COMMANDS

?chat=XXXX where XXXX is the name of the chat channel.
To chat on that channel use the ; key.
EG: ?chat=rod
;hello
this sends the message "hello" to everybody on that chat channel.
?chat with no name removes you from a chat channel.

?log - logs all messages to a file. ?log XXXX specifies file name
?log again stops logging.

?kill - logs all death messages to your message area so you can hit esc to see them.

%killer - tells you who last killed you.
%killed - tells you who you last killed.

?status - tells you how much charge rate and other powerups you have. 
remember 100% jav speed is faster than 100% warbird speed.

:#squadname:message here   Sends a mesage to everyone in that squad across all zones.

#message As above but auto sends it to your squad.

Right SHIFT + Function keys now gives you extra macros! (menu option)

SHIFT+BKSPCE erases entire message.


The new graphics are very nice, and it's obvious that VIE is getting
this prettied up so they can start selling it.  The rumors are flying,
but the predominant rumor is that it will cost $10 a month.  I hope this
isn't the case, because as much as I like this game, it's not worth $120
a year to me.  I can easily justify spending the $50 that Blizzard asks
for Diablo, but SubSpace just doesn't have that same appeal to me.

And last but not least, we come to another release that I've been
eagerly awaiting... Planetary Raiders (http://www.icigames.com/pr/)! I've
been wanting to test drive this ever since I came across their teasers a
few months ago.  ICI is the same company that does Warbirds, a WWII
simulator enjoyed by hundreds of online flight sim nuts all over the
world.  If you've ever gotten a WBer talking about this game, you'd know
you need a court order to shut them up.  But if PR keeps along the same
lines, you'll need one to shut ME up!  I'm an old Elite player (if you
know what it is, you know what I mean... if not.. FIND OUT!) from way
back when, and I've long dreamed about someone bringing Elite online.
Well, ICI is working on it, and have a great start from what I can tell!
They're in open beta right now, and it's not that hard to get it up and
going.  A word of warning though, to log on they require you to
"subscribe", and somewhere in that process they ask for a credit card #.
It seemed like I was signing up for Warbirds, but it was necessary to get
into the ICI server to play PR.  I'm still not sure if I'm going to be
charged the subscription fees, since it says that there will be no charge
for two months to betatest PR.  If you're at all uncomfortable about
giving credit card information-  online, contact them directly.

Well, time to get this thing sent to the editor!  I don't have any
prepared reviews this time, but from what I can tell from the rough
draft of the newsletter, there's plenty to keep you occupied.  

I will however throw in my own little contribution to the humor section,
in the form of a game you've got to see to believe.  Redneck Rampage by
Interplay is hysterical, and worth the download time.  I don't know if
you'll be seeing this one on any of the gaming magazine CD-ROM's, but it
wouldn't surprise me if none of them carry it.  There were absolutely no
restrictions or age stipulations to download this thing from 
(http://www.interplay.com/games/redneck.html), but I'm not sure if that
surprises me or not.  Start it up, and you're welcomed by a fair
impression of a hillbilly salute, "Holy Shit!", with southern accent and
everything. The name of the game says it all, and the gameplay is very
Duke-like. The graphics are impressive, but you'll need a decent machine
to run them in highest resolution.  If you're bored with Duke and/or
Quake, this is a funny diversion from your regular Doom/Duke/Quake clone.
Just don't take it too serious, or you just won't get the enjoyment out 
of it that I'm sure Interplay is hoping for. 

Until next time, GOOD GAMING!

GAMING NEWS  - All the multiplayer news you can use.

Blizzard Takes Online Gaming by Storm
by 	Marc Saltzman 2:42pm PST 16 Jan 97
----------------------------------------
Blizzard Entertainment's online gaming service Battle.Net, launched last
week, reached 60,000 registered players on Wednesday, surpassing Mplayer,
DWANGO, and the largest of the online gaming pack - 
The Total Entertainment Network (TEN). The service, which offers
Blizzard's long-awaited role-playing game Diablo, is free. "This does
indeed make it tough for TEN, and other online gaming services that
charge fees," says John Robb, an analyst at Forrester Research. "They
will have to do a lot more for their money." Blizzard, publisher of the
hugely successful game series WarCraft, is the first gaming company to
provide its own Web service for a newly launched game. QuakeWorld, id's
online gaming service for Quake, came out months after Quake was released.
id says it has not been tracking how many users QuakeWorld has.

Direct competition from gaming company makers will force online gaming
services to add more features, such as news, and to create a stronger
community, says Robb. But TEN denies that Battle.Net is competition. "We
see them [Blizzard] as a partner, since we are providing Diablo on our
network soon," says Garth Chouteau, communications manager at TEN. The
company is working to make sure its multiplayer version of Diablo will
be the "best possible online experience out of all the Networks." Plans
include a unique TEN shell for players and lower latency during gameplay.

Mark Mooradian of Jupiter Communications says there is more than enough
online room for different types of services. "There is definitely a
place for both of them; everybody benefits, but the lowest latency
possible is still the main issue."


Diablo Burns Up battle.net
http://www.gamespot.com
--------------------------
Gamers logging on to Blizzard's free multiplayer server, battle.net, to
play Diablo are turning the new service into a gamer free-for-all. "As
of Sunday night we were at 80,000 visitors," a Blizzard spokesperson
told GameSpot today. And with battle.net attracting about 5,000 new
users a day, it will likely top the 100,000 mark by week's end. On the
heels of Diablo's success, Blizzard is readying StarCraft, its real-time
strategy game, for a full-scale battle.net release this summer.


ENGAGE Games announces a deal with CompuServe
IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)
--Jan. 22, 1997--
----------------------------------------------
ENGAGE Games Online Wednesday announced a deal with CompuServe
Interactive (CSi), which makes the new on-line game community available
on the three leading commercial on-line services, as well as the
Internet.

ENGAGE will begin delivering its high-end multiplayer games and on-line
entertainment content to CSi's more than 3 million members in early 1997.
Among the initial offerings will be Interplay's "Descent Online" and
"Castles II," as well as on-line exclusive originals from Interworld,
"Rolemaster: Magestorm" and "Splatterball."

ENGAGE has already announced deals with AOL, Prodigy and Internet
providers Concentric Network and Earthlink Network. Other deals are also
soon to be announced.

ENGAGE recently announced its beta testing phase on America Online and
the Internet, allowing die-hard game fans a first look at such hits as
"Descent Online," "Castles II" and "Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness," as
well as on-line original exclusives "Rolemaster: Magestorm" and
"Splatterball." When ENGAGE launches its full service on March 15, it
will feature an impressive array of high-end multiplayer games, as well
as some less intense fare for non-gamer members of the family. ENGAGE
will offer several games at launch and then plans to add one or two
additional games each month.

GT Interactive Signs Publishing Deal with 5D Games
--------------------------------------------------
GT Interactive announced it has signed a multi-title publishing
agreement with game developer 5D Games. The agreement gives GT
Interactive the interactive media, merchandising, and publishing rights
to 5D Games's upcoming game Millennium Four: The Right, along with its
sequel and three other future titles. Millennium is a space action/strategy
sim that will include a "serverless" multiplayer design allowing network
games to continue even if the player who started the game leaves.
Millennium is scheduled for release in the fourth quarter of this year and
will be available for the PC and console platforms. 5D Games was founded
last July by several employees from Sierra On-Line's Papyrus division,
developers of the IndyCar and NASCAR racing simulation series.


Monolith Productions Announces Blood and Q Studios Acquisitions
Kirkland, Washington -January 22, 1997
http://www.blood.com
---------------------------------------------------------------
Monolith Productions today announced the recent acquisition of all the
rights to 3D action horror game Blood from 3D Realms. "Monolith believes
that Blood will be THE deathmatch game of choice in 1997. The horrific
nature of the game and quality of gameplay will give Blood the foundation
it needs to become a phenomenal hit," says Monolith CEO Jason Hall.
"This acquisition gives us the ability to give Blood the support and
attention it deserves," says Monolith Product Manager Matt Saettler.

While Monolith now owns all content and rights to Blood, the game will
still be published and distributed by GT Interactive. "GT is a great
publisher," says Hall, "they're one of the biggest and one of the best.
They've clearly shown the desire and ability to promote and support Blood.
We couldn't be happier with their efforts." A shareware release of Blood
is expected in March.


Spectrum HoloByte Upset with Acclaim
------------------------------------
Legal battle over the release of Magic titles continues. Spectrum player
-controllable artificial intelligence, true line-of-sight, native
Internet play and advanced gaming options, Dark Reign draws players into
an engaging sci-fi universe where armies duel for interplanetary
domination in more than 30 battles. Currently slated for a summer
release, the Windows 95 compatible title is being co-developed by
Activision, Inc. and Australis Microprogramming Pty., Ltd.


Women more interested in on-line video games than men
-----------------------------------------------------
Impulse Research, an independent research firm based in Los Angeles,
released survey results Tuesday reporting women are more interested in
playing on-line video games than men (59 percent of women who play
console video games want to play games on-line, compared with 49 percent
of men). The survey also says 61 percent of video game players want to
access the Internet and play on-line games on their video game consoles.
The survey results were released by Sega of America which, coincidentally,
markets a $199 modem that plugs into the Sega Saturn video game console
allowing complete access to the Internet displayed on a TV. On-line games
will be available from Sega in early 1997.

Win95 Games under NT 4.0
http://www.concentric.net/~Dstaines/nt40games/
----------------------------------------------
If you are running Windows NT on your system then you know how tough or
impossible it is to get Windows 95 games to work under NT 4.0. This is a
list of games that I have compiled based on information received from
personal experience, messages from visitors and developers themselves. It
is in no way intended to be used as a buying guide, but as a reference
base for games under NT 4.0.

Millennium Four: The Right
5D GAMES ANNOUNCES FIRST TITLE FOR 1997
January 13, 1997
---------------------------------------
In the fourth millennium, the Earth is dying.
In the fourth millennium, humanity has spread to the stars.
In the fourth millennium, the Aahnja have returned, to reclaim their
right.

5D Games, Inc. announced today that its first title, previously code
named G-Zero, will be called Millennium Four: The Right. 
Millennium Four:The Right takes place in the thirty-sixth century. As
the Earth is dying from ecological abuse, humanity has colonized dozens
of star systems spread over one hundred light years. The expansion has
stopped, however, with the discovery of the Aahnja, a group of humans
taken from Earth fifteen thousand years earlier by a mysterious alien
race known only as Aahnk. The Aahnja were bred to be Aahnk mercenaries
with the promise of the rule of humanity in return. Now they have
returned to claim their right.

Millennium Four: The Right is a first-person perspective, 3D space
combat/action/strategy game that sets a new standard for graphics. The
player starts as a neutral trader just as tensions are escalating
between the human government, called the Centauri Cooperative, and the
Aahnja, backed by the rebel faction known as Brooks-Taylor FreeSpace. As
the player ferries cargo between space stations they meet characters that
invite them into both sides of the conflict. The player can choose to
help the Centauri, the Aahnja through the Brooks-Taylorites, or stay
neutral. If the player stays neutral, the game's AI plays out the story,
providing a dynamic backdrop for their trading activities. The game's
economic model allows prices to fluctuate based on current economic and
political conditions.

Supporting 5D Games's proprietary 3D graphics engine, as well as
Microsoft's Direct3D hardware acceleration standard, Millennium Four:
The Right offers stunning graphics at resolutions from 640x480 in 8-bit
color to a breathtaking 1280x1024 in 24-bit color. Combined with true 3D
sound, Millennium Four: The Right promises the most immersive gaming
experience ever. Millennium Four: The Right also offers full multiplayer
support using a unique, 'serverless' design, allowing multiplayer games
to continue even if the player who started the game leaves. Millennium
Four: The Right supports modem, LAN and Internet play for up to 32
players in three different modes: Single System MultiSlayer; Multiple
System MultiSlayer; and Full Game Universe, where players compete through
trade as the Centauri/Aahnja conflict escalates.

Millennium Four: The Right is scheduled for release in late 1997.
Additional information about Millennium Four: The Right will be posted
periodically on 5D Games's web site at http://www.5dgames.com. 5D Games,
Inc. was founded July 1, 1996 by five former employees of Papyrus Design
Group, Inc. and is dedicated to producing state-of-the-art 3D games for
the Windows 95 and Macintosh platforms. 5D Games, the 5D Games logo,
Aahnja, Aahnk, and MultiSlayer are trademarks of 5D Games, Inc.

F/A 18 Hornet 3.0
http://www.graphsim.com/flightsimweb/Hornet30.html
--------------------------------------------------
Strap in for the ride of your life! This award-winning flight-simulation
utilizes cutting-edge 3-D polygon rendering technology resulting in truly
fluid, high-speed graphics even at SVGA resolutions as high as 1024 x 768.
Each of the 28 scenarios take you deep into a new conflict in the
Middle-East.

Fly against some of the hottest artificial intelligence ever seen in a
desktop simulation, or use Hornet 3.0's built-in networking to test your
skills against live opponents. Truly authentic avionics and flight
modeling provide months of excitement at a level far more rewarding and
enjoyable than the usual arcade style "flight simulators." A comprehensive
multi-media training guide is included on the CD.

Designed by an active-duty Naval aviator, F/A-18 Hornet's training guide
goes far beyond simply "getting off the ground." This feature is sure to
prove useful to any level of aviation buff! If you want to see what a
mission in Hornet 3.0 will look like, you can download one of three
QuickTime movies. 

For the Macintosh there is a 50MB version at 640X480 pixels in MacBinary
;and a 9MB version at 320X240 pixels, and a 3MB version at 160X120 pixels,
 both in BinHex.

For IBM compatibles, there are a 6MB version at 320X240 pixels and a 2MB
version at 160X120 pixels, both in ZIP format. These movies are all a
replay of the first mission, M201, in the Kuwait theater of operations.
The release date for Hornet 3.0 has been rescheduled for no later than
the end of the first quarter of 1997. More information on a specific
release date will be forthcoming, as will additional QT movies and
screenshots.


Hexen: Beyond Heretic
http://www.ravensoft.com/html/hexen2.htm
----------------------------------------
[FreePlay: Yippee! A Quake clone, but what a Quake clone it will be!
Screenshots available at above URL. The graphics are gorgeous.]

You thought that Korax was the last of the Serpent Riders. You were
wrong! Coming soon, the latest in the Heretic Cycle, Hexen II (working
title).

Choose from one of four character classes to fight your way to the
depths of evil and destroy the last of the three Serpent Riders. Each
character class has its own set of unique abilities that are gained and
improved throughout the game using an experience system. With five
weapons per class, four of which can be powered up with the Tome of
Power, you'll have free reign of 36 death dealing weapons!

Hexen II uses the QUAKE technology to propel the player into a realistic
environment of fear and darkness. Lightning flickers through the clouds,
rain drops fall from the heavy skies, and torches flare in the depths of
the night. Run, swim, walk, fight andfly your way through 30 levels of
real areas and intriguing action... but be careful, there's more to this
game than quick reflexes! A sharp mind and cunning intelligence will be
needed to overcome the various puzzles, tricks, and traps that can be
encountered. Add these challenging puzzles to a large list of all new
creatures and you will have a game to be reckoned with. Be prepared...

Coming second quarter, 1997.


Virus
http://www.kidum.co.il/html/virus.html
--------------------------------------
Virus is a sophisticated multiplayer strategy game involving an imaginary
 computer virus in a virtual environment. The action takes place inside
the player's virtual PC and from there it is spread over a virtual
international computer network to other computers. It systematically
destroys files around the world as well as in international communication
channels. The player moves in a 3-D environment to engage in strategic
warfare whose purpose is to eradicate the virus and keep the world safe
for networking.

This new game will employ advanced technology to create striking graphic
backdrops, and will require intense structured planning on the part of
the player. The 3-D landscape in which the game operates is not
predetermined. The structures of the virtual computers in the game will
be received as input and they will be constructed in real time. Kidum
Multimedia adapted its technology to allow the use of this game over the
Internet. The long awaited Virus demo is due to be released on this site
by the end of January. The demo will include two levels of the game. (No
hardware requirements available)

ICI Beta Testing Planetary Raiders
http://www.icigames.com/pr/publicbeta.html
------------------------------------------
Interactive Creations Inc. is currently conducting a public beta test of
its new MEGAplayer game, Planetary Raiders. 

In order to participate in the beta test, you must be an ICI subscriber.
There is no hourly charge to play the beta version of Planetary Raiders
(ICI's MEGAplayer games normally cost $2/hour to play). There is a$10.00
(U.S) minimum monthly subscription charge. However, testers who cancel
their accounts within the first 20 days of signing up will not be
charged anything. Potential testers can visit this page for instructions
and software.

The $10.00 minimum charge is credited against game play. Accordingly,
you can use that time to play ICI's other MEGAplayer game, WarBirds (PC
Games magazine's best online game of 1996). Also, if you delete your
account within the first 20 days (and withoutplaying more than 5 hours
of WarBirds), you will not be charged anything.
You cannot, however, recover your persona after deleting an account.

games on the net. No need to download and install software, simply enter
the Park and play. Internet Park gives you an intimate and familial

Packs Home Page (Win95)
http://www.wpc.com/packs/
-------------------------
PACKS is a chat program, but it isn't like other chat programs. It is a
virtual 3d environment where other people appear as people. The area is
full of rooms, hallways and doors. There are also secret and hard to
reach areas. When we decided to create PACKS, we wanted to make the best
chat program ever. The IRC has too much lag, too many bots, channel
take-overs etc. Some of the major online services have silly rules that
are enforced in a poor fashion.

Are you sick of antagonists breaking up your online conversations? Not
anymore. In PACKS, you shoot other players. So, for the most part,
majority rules. When necessary, Law & Order are enforced by armor-clad,
machine gun-toting PACKOPS.

Requirements: 
Microsoft Windows 95
486 66Mhz with 8Meg RAM.

Weekend Warrior (Win95,Mac)
http://www.bungie.com/products/weekendwarrior/weekendwarrior.html
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Weekend Warrior puts a uniquely entertaining spin on the fully 3D action
game. Sort of a bizarre hybrid of "Smash TV" and "American Gladiators",
Weekend Warrior is a gameshow where you assume the identity of an
ordinary, everyday character and enter a challenging 3D arena. Cash and
prizes can be yours by escaping traps, completing missions and pummeling
other contestants into submission.

Each of the characters has their own strengths and weaknesses and
carries an appropriate weapon: the Butcher has his mighty Pork Shoulder;
the Punk Rocker wields a Guitar; and the Cowboy, a Hobby Horse. A
smart-aleck host and his goofy sidekick provide humorous running
commentary on the action.

Eight multi-room, multi-elevation arenas are packed with traps, puzzles,
hostile contestants and prizes. Including the Old West Town, Space
Station, Haunted House and Topiary Maze, some arenas have time limits,
some have missions and others simply have to be survived. 

FEATURES:
*** Lifelike physics model.
*** Completely free camera control: 1st person, overhead, over the
shoulder, etc.
*** The whole range of true 3D effects: texture mapping, spectacular
shading, alpha transparencies, mip mapping, Gouraud shading.
*** Networkable for up to six players.
*** Soundtracks appropriate for each arena.

Bungie's Weekend Warrior demo (9.6 MB) is now available...but WAIT! Only
those who dare have the hardware should even bother downloading.

HUMOR - Something to make you laugh while you are gaming
-----

From the Big Book of Jokes
http://www.unm.edu/~rooster/fun.html
------------------------------------
Once you start playing with software you quickly become aware that each
software package has a revision code attached to it. It is obvious that
this revision code gives the sequence of changes to the product, but in
reality there's substantially more information available through the
revision code than that. This article provides a guide for interpreting
the meaning of the revision codes and what they actually signify.

1.0:  Also known as "one point uh-oh", or "barely out of beta". We had
to release because the lab guys had reached a point of exhaustion and the
marketing guys were in a cold sweat of terror. We're praying that you'll
find it more functional than, say, a computer virus and that its
operation has some resemblance to that specified in the marketing copy.

1.1:  We fixed all the killer bugs ...

1.2:  Uh, we introduced a few new bugs fixing the killer bugs and so we
had to fix them, too.

2.0:  We did the product we really wanted to do to begin with. Mind you,
it's really not what the customer needs yet, but we're working on it.

2.1:  Well, not surprisingly, we broke some things in making major
changes so we had to fix them. But we did a really good job of testing
this time, so we don't think we introduced any new bugs while we were
fixing these bugs.

2.2: Uh, sorry, one slipped through. One lousy typo error and you won't
believe how much trouble it caused!

2.3:  Some jerk found a deep-seated bug that's been there since 1.0 and
wouldn't stop nagging until we fixed it!!

3.0:  Hey, we finally think we've got it right! Most of the customers are
really happy with this.

3.1:  Of course, we did break a few little things.

4.0:  More features. It's doubled in size now, by the way, and you'll
need to get more memory and a faster processor ...

4.1: Just one or two bugs this time... Honest!

5.0:  We really need to go on to a new product, but we have an installed
base out there to protect. We're cutting the staffing after this.

6.0:  We had to fix a few things we broke in 5.0. Not very many, but
it's been so long since we looked at this thing we might as well call it
a major upgrade. Oh, yeah, we added a few flashy cosmetic features so we
could justify the major upgrade number.

6.1:  Since I'm leaving the company and I'm the last guy left in the lab
who works on the product, I wanted to make sure that all the changes
I've made are incorporated before I go. I added some cute demos, too,
since I was getting pretty bored back here in my dark little corner (I
kept complaining about the lighting but they wouldn't do anything).
They're talking about obsolescence planning but they'll try to keep
selling it for as long as there's a buck or two to be made. I'm leaving
the bits in as good a shape as I can in case somebody has to tweak them,
but it'll be sheer luck if no one loses them.
