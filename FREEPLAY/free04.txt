 Editorial
 =========
 The FreePlay Newsletter is a FREE, I repeat, FREE newsletter.
 I have had a lot of questions about this. There will never be a
 charge or subscription fee. We MAY pick up sponsorship and post an
 occasional ad in the newsletter, but I am not actively looking for
 sponsors at this time. 

 We have located a host for the FreePlay Newsletter. The next issue
 'should' be posted from the majordomo at that time.
 If I get everything working right with the majordomo software then
 the next issue will be sent out on Sept 9 instead of Sept 16, mostly
 because I almost have it finished already. 
 There are some new sections I added and I moved some things around.
 YOUR FEEDBACK is what will make this newsletter a success.
 I have incorporated almost every suggestion I received into this 
 newsletter.  You will notice there are many more Macintosh links and
 play by email links. This is what some of my readers requested.
 If I am not covering something you are interested
 in and you think it fits in this newsletter send me some mail.

 Online Gaming Review
 http://www.ogr.com
 ------------------
 I have been in contact by e-mail with the editors of this site.
 They are really nice people and their WWW site is a great
 resource for the multiplayer (and other types) gamer.
 They recently added a game console section too.
 Stop by and let them know FreePlay sent you!

 Quote from their 'about us' page:
 Online Gaming Review was started in the fall of 1995 to provide a 
 comprehensive source of  information to today's mature PC gamer. 
 Our main goal was to provide reviews of all the latest
 games so gamers would get a clearer understanding of games in stores 
 -- without having to wait 3 months for a paper magazine to deliver a 
 similar view. However, we have grown into much more
 than just that. With the most comprehensive and up-to-date gaming news
 coverage on the Internet, in-depth feature articles, previews of hot 
 upcoming titles, and links to other gaming sites, thousands
 of gamers are visiting OGR every day for the information they need.

 GT Interactive and Microstar Duke it out 
 -------------------------------------------------------
 Duke Nukem is caught in the middle of a possibly fierce and 
 ugly battle. Only this time, the fighting doesn't include pipe
 bombs or Pig Cops. This particular conflict is between 
 GT Interactive and Microstar Software. 
 Multimedia Wire reports that GT, in an effort to protect its 
 acquired title Duke Nukem 3-D, is suing Microstar for allegedly
 producing and selling unlicensed add-on levels. The lawsuit claims 
 that Microstar is generating revenue from the license
 without GT's permission. MMWire says that Microstar denies any 
 knowledge of the lawsuit, adding that it filed a lawsuit
 against GT last week. The topic of Microstar's lawsuit was not disclosed. 
 The rights to Duke Nukem 3-D became the property of GT when GT 
 bought FormGen, Duke's developer. The first-person action game, 
 of the same genre as the ever-popular Doom II, is currently one of 
 the top-selling games of the year.

 network, direct connect and INTERNET PLAY.

 their own thing during the turn. Through the use of this new
 multiplayer interface we have eliminated any player "down-time" and 
 significantly sped up the game play.

 AutoDuel

 -------------------------------------------------------
 They are looking for beta testers to test this multiplayer internet 
 version of Car Wars.
 Warning: Hardware requirements are rumored to be EXTENSIVE.

 They won't even take your application unless you own or plan to own 
 such hardware.  AutoDuel Online is based on Car Wars by Steve Jackson 
 Games. The Car Wars fiction takes place 50 years in the future, where 
 the right of way goes to the biggest guns. 
 Choose your vehicle - complete with weapons, armor, power plant, 
 suspension, and body style - and take it to an AutoDuel Arena. 
 You'll  come home an "ace" or you'll crash and burn. If you survive, 
 your abilities will improve, and you can accumulate money and prestige
 to buy bigger and better cars and enjoy more elite privileges.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Incorporating all of the exciting aspects of the original, 
 SimCity 2000  Network Edition allows players to team up through LAN, 
 modem, or Internet play to determine the most efficient way to design 
 and build a city. Not only do players have to deal with the opinions of their 
 resident Sims, they also have to contend with the actions of competing 
 players. While each player ultimately competes to own the most land, 
 they also must work collectively to decide the important aspects of 
 city management that are necessary for prosperity. Innovative features 
 such as resource trading, collective voting on all city ordinances and 
 a chat facility that provides for town meetings enhance the unique 
 social element of this game. SimCity 2000 cities can also be imported 
 to further expand the depth of gameplay.

 Titan is a multiplayer (2-6) boardgame produced by The Avalon Hill Game
 Company (currently $35). It is billed as a Fantasy Monster Slugathon.

 large map recruiting minions to fight with. When two opposing legions 
 meet on this board the battle is fought out on a different board 
 representing the type of terrain the legions were in on the main board.
 Each player is represented by a special character (a Titan). When that 
 character is killed the player is eliminated. Play continues until only
 one or zero players are left. 
 If you don't know how to play, you should try to find a friend who has 
 a copy of the game (Titan is a popular game amoung board/wargamers). 
 Barring that you should be able to buy a copy of the game at a local game or
 hobby store. You can also order a copy direct from The Avalon Hill Game 
 Company. Titan sells for $35. Note that you will be buying a boardgame,
 not a computer game. 
 Got all that? Good!

 overlords attempt to gain control over the mostly-lawless city, sector
 by sector, with some variation depending on the game's scenario 
 objectives.

Top Ten New Games That Maxis is Considering to Produce

10.  Sim Vaporware - (to win you must spend months developing a game, 
      while at the same time relentlessly advertising it, only to pull 
      the plug when customer anticipation is peaked)

 9.  Sim NFL  -  (must get through 10 seasons without being busted for drugs,
     wife beating, solicitation of prostitutes, steroid abuse, DWI, or child
     molestation --- reportedly is going to be a very tough game.)

 8.  Sim Widget  (become the world's largest and most powerful widget mogul.)

 7.  Sim Televangelest (speaks for itself)

 6.  Sim Solid Waste Treatment Facility (Dive in to this one and experience life
     at its most pungent)

 5.  Sim Park Ranger - (Yes, you too can live the exciting life of a Forest Park
     Ranger.  Experience the surge of adreneline as you ticket people for
     unlicensed fishing and for cutting trees for camp firewood.)

 4.  Sim Homeless - (Prowl the streets, and never worry about paying rent.
     Make decisions such as should I eat the Beets and Corn soup at the
     shelter?  Or should I search the dumpster behind the Pizza Hut?)

 3.  Sim Porn Video Director - (see #7 above)

 2.  Sim Junk Yard - (organize ad campaigns to bring in loyal customers so they
     will see that your junk is better than the competition.  Bonus points for
     recycling and separating plastics, glass, and aluminum.)

 1.  Sim City 2000 *Ghetto Edition* - (create the inner-city hell of your
     dreams.  Gang shootings, turf wars, crack houses, goverment project
     housing facilities...all this and more.  May be a "Crip" and "Blood"
     option for added replay value.)
