Unorthodox Interview with Don Hertzfeldt
by Bob Lull [r_lull@hotmail.com]

   Recently, I had the chance to interview Don Hertzfeldt, who has
written/animated/produced several multi-award winning short animation
films, such as 'Billy's Balloon', 'Ah L'Amour' and the Academy Award
nominated 'Rejected'. Don's unique style of animation is considerably
more 'low-tech' compared to most animator's styles.  His animation is
done on good old drawing paper with a camera taking snapshots.  Most
of the characters in Hertzfeldt's cartoons are stick figures, and
since he doesn't use cells, every frame of each cartoon is drawn
manually.  Despite this, all of his cartoons have won countless awards
from around the world.  You may notice that most of these questions
are not what is typically asked of an animator.  Most animators have
answered the typical questions countless times.  So instead of just
another humdrum run-of-the-mill questionaire about the in-depth
meanings of his films, I decided to ask a series of questions that
follow no real pattern, or even a stable train of thought.  In this
way, I feel it is possible to learn more about the person, rather than
just the sum of their work.  I like to call this the "Unorthodox
Interview".


FS - Let's start with an important question:  Boxers or Briefs?

Don - Boxers. Although I have been told that boxer-briefs are
something to try

FS - What type of music do you like?/ Why?/ What's your favorite band?

Don - my favorite band has always been REM and i'm really big on
radiohead right now. i've been listening to a lot of UK bands for the
last several years, as most american music has just been going
straight to hell.

FS - What's your take on the whole 'Napster' thing?

Don- I was really big on napster and discovered all sorts of wonderful
new and rare music on the internet. Most of it was stuff I didn't have
the option to buy anywhere anyway. i don't see how much different it
is from radio, really.
       
From what I understand, artists make relatively little from album
sales, most of their income is from their record deals and from
touring. Napster only threatened the corporations financially, and
well, I'm all for that : )  but in a perfect world, the artists
themselves would have each been able to make the call on whether or
not they wanted their material on there, not their distributors. It
sounds like many of the artists were keen on the thing before it was
shut down, but didn't have any options.
       
FS - Describe your perfect sandwich.

Don - peanut butter, chunky. jelly, grape. toasted. 
      i can't cook. 
      : (

FS - If you could bag any movie star, who would it be and why?
      
Don - ummm Angelina Jolie. Ask me tomorrow and it will be somebody
else though.
      rrrrrr

FS - If you could beat the snot out of any movie star, who would it be
and why?

Don - I'd love to throttle Michael Bay. Although I guess he's not a
movie star. It's not very fair to say though, because this answer will
change every year to whomever may be directing the current soulless
blundering insulting big summer film.
       
FS - Will there ever be any stick figure Ninjas in any of your cartoons? 
     (If not, I'd like to request some.)

Don - no.
      well maybe.
      probably not.

FS - Do you consider yourself a people person?

Don - not really

FS - Which are smarter, cats or dogs?

Don - cats

FS - Ever done anything that makes you cringe when you think about it now,
that you can reveal here? (This interview doesn't count.)

Don - Of course. But if I revealed it here it would just make me re-cringe.

FS - In the event of a water landing, would you put your tray tables
forward, put your seat-back forward, and use your seat cushion as a
floatation device?

Don - There's actually no such thing as a "water landing." The little
safety card in the seat pocket in front of you is kind of a
head-scratcher because there's this happy diagram of a jetliner safely
floating in the ocean. Jets don't float. They sink like rocks,
trapping everyone inside within seconds. that is, assuming the plane
didn't break up into a million little bits upon hurtling into the sea.
I don't like flying over water.

FS - Do you play any Video Games?  What's your favorite?

Don - Yes but not so much lately. We must have played the "goldeneye"
game every day in college, shooting each other in the head. That's
almost as perfect a video game as you can get.

FS - If you were a porno director, what name would you give to your movie?

Don - Obviously, this entirely depends on the age, ethnicity, and
assorted genders and economic backgrounds of the characters.

FS - And speaking of porn, if you were a pornstar, what would your
screen name be?

Don - Bongo
      
FS - Thank you for taking the time to do this interview!   

Don - I can't tell you how nice it is to get non-film questions. 

    If you want to get a better feel for the type of art/animation
that Don does, you can find out all about him and his works at
bitterfilms.com.  I highly recommend his site.  He funny.  Don't
forget to check out his Temporary Anesthetics comics!  They are
delightfully sick.  If you want to see any of his cartoons, you can
usually see them at any of the Spike and Mike festivals, or check his
website for a schedule of animated film festivals.

Generic Comic Book #2
PUBLISHER: Comics Conspiracy
WRITER: Doug Miers
ARTISTS: Santos, Lean, and Thomas

The guy who wears his underwear outside his pants is back for another
round of superhero hilarity.  The world economy is in the grip of a
comics speculator gone mad; a despot who collects corporations and
governments the way other people collect baseball cards.  When the
fate of the free world rests on the outcome of a video game, don't be
short on tokens.  The virgin white cover veils only the finest
interior art.

The Successors #2
PUBLISHER: K.O. Comix
WRITER: Russ Kazmierezak, Jr.
ARTIST: Brent Otey

Psycho Chick is the star of Successors #2 -- a demented female high
school student with a taste for petty revenge. Cute story, locally
produced in Fullerton, CA by a relatively new company called K.O. Comix.
The series explores a cool concept: in a world without superpowers,
how would ones life change if one were to suddenly become a superhero?

The Complete Guide to the Elcotel Grapevine Smart-Phone
by The Clone [theclone@hackcanada.com]

   Introduction --

   
  Over the past 100 years, the public telecommunications industry,
more commonly known as "payphones", has evolved into one of the most
easy-to-use and widely accepted communications networks.  The core
device in public communications - the payphone - literally has made
"on the go" communications possible for millions of people daily.

In recent years, however, unprecedented technological, competitive and
regulatory changes within the telecommunications industry create an
equally unprecedented challenge for the public communications sector.
 
A decade ago, the payphone was the only way most people on the go kept
connected to home or office.  Talking on the phone while walking down
the street or through a busy airport was still a concept out of Star
Trek.  Today, however, wireless phones keep everyone -- from high
school students to housewives to business travelers -- in touch while
on the go.

The Internet likewise has revolutionized how people communicate by
replacing cards and letters with e-mail, how they shop using e-commerce
and how they access news, information and services through personalized
portals.  As a result, telecommunications today is about personal
connectivity on a 24/7 basis.  Consumers increasingly demand access to
"content" anytime, anywhere, not just the voice communications provided
by wireline or wireless phones. Content equals information, ranging from
voice calls to local news, mapped directions and investments updates to
e-commerce transactions, e-mail and connectivity with the home, office
and web-based information.

Think of a time when all local events, local transportation contacts,
local maps and weather, sports results, and stock performance
information can be retrieved by any consumer simply by going to the
closest public phone terminal.

Envision downloading or uploading e-mail from a Palm Pilot or a
high-capacity smart card at a public phone terminal through the
phone's infrared dataport or reading and responding to messages on the
phone's color screen.

 Imagine a point-of-sale phone terminal for e-commerce transactions,
with an ATM-like capability for funds transfer and electronic banking.
Speed dial buttons linking advertisers and consumers directly enable
immediate purchase of anything from airline or concert tickets to
flowers delivered to your mother for her birthday.

Think of a medium where all advertising can be delivered to the
consumer on a terminal-by-terminal, time-of-day and interactive basis
in any indoor environment. Advertisements can be changed selectively,
one by one, on any terminal at any time. Product launches, specials,
sales promotions, targeted messages, and local services can be
location specific. This flexibility has no comparison in the
advertising world.

Imagine having airline and train schedules, convention agendas, weekly
specials and sales promotions, public service information, local
transportation numbers, event schedules, and local directions to
nearby sites - all available from a public phone.

Now imagine that this technology is already available... because it is.

  Physical Overview -


 (Image: http://www.nettwerked.net/grapevine.jpg)


 		Speed-dial Buttons
                ------------------

There are eight black speed-dial buttons down the middle of the
Grapevine. The top button is labelled "Collect Call", the second one
says "Send Flowers". The remaining three are "Repair", "Data Jack",
and "Language". As well, you will likely notice an Infrared Data
Access (IrDA) - used for transfering data such as electronic mail to
your PDA (Palm, Visor).

Collect Call - This connects you to the local AT&T operator    

Send Flowers - This allows you to send flowers to your loved ones with a
credit card via 1-800-FLOWERS

Repair - Press this button if the Grapevine you are operating is not
working properly. You will be directly connected to a Canada Payphone
Corp (the distributors who are 20% owned by AT&T), AT&T or private
contract repairman.

Data Jack - Press this button if you plan to insert a phone jack into
the RJ-11 data jack to dial up the toll-free number to your ISP. The
Grapevine does not allow long-distance or local exchange dialing for
data transfers. Though you are connected at 33.6/kbps.

Language - Press this button to switch the words on the screen from
English to French.

		Softouch Buttons
                ----------------

There are five more black oval buttons along the button of the screen
on the Grapevine known as 'Softouch Buttons'. The buttons are labelled
the following: "Info", "E-com", "Mail", "Data", and "Help". Press 1
and you get a message saying: "This key is not yet operational". When
implemented, it will provide some important information designed for
travellers. The INFOS screens will offer maps, weather, financial
news, and sports scores -- all at the simple touch of a button. If you
press the "help" key you will get: "You have pressed the HELP key.
Context-sensitive online help is available for the Grapevine Cashless
ATM and E-Commerce functions. If you need additional information,
press the HELP key." You have pressed the help key. If you need
additional information, press the help key. Obviously this is a glitch
in the Grapevine.

	        Grapevine Display
                -----------------

On the Grapevine smart-phone, the first thing you will likely notice
is the rotating ads for 'CBC', 'Best Western Hotels', 'Esso', and
'FTD' - all of which are either corporate sponsors or location hosts.
The display on the Grapevine smart-phone is a simple 5 1/4" VGA
screen.


		Physical Administration
	        -----------------------

Physical administration on the Grapevine smart-phone is done much the
same way as physical administration is done on the Eclipse and 9520C
model Elcotel COCOTs - with total lack of respect for security. ;)

-= PIN ADMIN =-

The benefit of Physical Administration over Remote Administration is
that you are not required to enter an ID of some sort before entering
the PIN. The physical administration PIN scheme on the Grapevine phone
is exactly the same as the PIN scheme for the Eclipse / 9520C
models...

1. Press # (8 digit default pin).

2. After entering the physical admin PIN the display on the Grapevine
   will say 'thank you'.

3. Now enter series of 3 digit flags: the flags are from 000-999.
   For example: 999 - resets the phone, 998 - is a memory test.

If you enter the correct 3 digit flag, you will have the ability to:

- empty out the cash box
- change screen messages
- administrate rate tables
- see how many calls were made with the phone in a given time period
- see how many days the phone has not been in use
- debit card information
- several security parameters

Just so you know, every time you administrate (or attempt to
bruteforce the physical admin PIN) the Grapevine will send the
statistics to CPC (Canada Payphone Corp) for updating...
(604)-717-6532. If CPC notices a strange pattern in the number of
times the Grapevine was administrated, then they will start to pay
attention to that particular phone, and will likely wait for you
return. When you're caught, CPC will grab you buy your throat and cut
off your hands... so you may never again wreck havoc on with their
equipment again!

		Alarm PIN Information
		---------------------

Disabling the alarm on the Elcotel Grapevine is relatively simple.
What you are required to enter is a three digit PIN, which if
correctly entered, will turn off the local alarm in the phone. This
means that the static connection from the phone to Canada Payphone's
NCC computer in Burnaby British Columbia will be severed. However, if
you enter an incorrect alarm PIN on the Grapevine, you'll get an error
message on the display.

Q: How do I disable the alarm?

A: By picking up the receiver on the phone, pressing #,
   and entering the three digit PIN.

Q: How do I know I'm doing it correctly?
A: You'll know you're doing it correctly when you see ### on the display...
   the ### represent the PIN. If you entered the right PIN, the display
   message will say "OK".

Q: How do I enable the alarm again?
A: - Pick up the receiver (if it was hung up) and type #CPC.
   - Hang up the receiver and wait for approximately twenty seconds for
     the phone to reconfigure itself. (You'll know you can use the phone
     again when you hear the components in the Elcotel Grapevine) shifting.

Note: Just like physical PIN administration, fucking with the alarm PIN
      will cause the Grapevine to send statistical information to CPC HQ.

  Remote Overview -

Remote administration of the Grapevine payphone is simple:

With a computer a modem, and the proper remote administration
software, dial the local or long distance phone number of belonging to
a particular Grapevine phone. If you successfully connected (2400
baud), you will be prompted for your ID - the ID ranges from 8000 and
up. Knowing this, we can presumably say that all ID's are programmed
to be four digits - or at least four digits by default. Next is the
PIN; the remote administration PIN by default is 8 digits long using
the same number: i.e. 11111111, 22222222, etc.

Remote Administration Software to look for:

* PollQuest (aka 'International Payphone Network Management System')

* Coin Net

* Expressnet

* PNMPLUS Lite

* Pronet
