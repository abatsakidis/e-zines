Water to Water


"How consoling is water" he said.
"To hold it between the cheeks,
knowing full well it perches there on the tongue
like some absurd surgeon."
"Two pipes, down one, life.
"And through the murky waters of my mind
I can't tell which pipe I should let
this bittersweet lake trickle down."

Maybe the waters were a little too clear
(yet perfect for the divers)
in his mind.
Maybe they washed away
too many falsehoods,
too many mistakes,
too many masks from this Little Albert,
for too many irrational reasons flowed out
like a low tide that would never rise,
covering him with his clarity of thought,
just as the lake
buried him with mud and slit after
he breathed water.
