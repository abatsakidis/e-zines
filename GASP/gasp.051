                                   past

  we three sat on the darkened beach,
  possesing a bottle and a bag full of weed,
  i see his face in the glow of the fire,
  lighting up, he's trying to get a little higher.

  on my left is the foul tasting brew,
  i take a quick, bitter, unlasting swig,
  i'm then completely repulsed by the sensation,
  i look at the thc as my only salvation.

  my first puff was so soothing,
  i hold it in as long as i can possibly can,
  releasing the smoke a minute later,
  i can feel my head getting lighter.

  i zealously inhale the odorous smoke,
  the acrid fumes burn down my tender throat,
  we smoke the rest and then start walking,
  nothing makes sense as we are talking.

  i close my eyes and try to glide through life,
  free as a bird in flight, i come crashing down,
  what i landed on i wanted to see,
  i see the ground, but in true 3D.

  the world is madly spinning round and round,
  i feel upside down, inside out, and backwards,
  we talk about meaningless, hopeless trash,
  everything's so deep, thanks to the hash.

  the vaporous trails are greatly intensified,
  reminants of heavier drugs i've done before,
  i feel like i'm soaring above the higest cloud,
  and then one of the others starts getting loud.

  "i can't see anything man, it doesn't make sense!"
  we don't understand what he means, everything's fine,
  he starts to curl up, and having convulsions,
  i weakly try to talk him through his dilusions.

  he stands up, with a cunningly deceiving smile,
  he was kidding, trying to get a reaction,
  we make it back to my house, and goto rest,
  whatever it was that we smoked, it was the best.
