  so many times i thought of this,
  i think it would not rain on me,
  in your mouth i would like to piss,
  harpies fishing for your twine glee.

  something is so very wrong now,
  i don't know what has come about,
  your ass is the size of a cow,
  you smell like hot ripe sun baked trout.

  you enjoy licking old men's shoes,
  when the dairy farm comes to you,
  you smell like some kid's poo poos,
  surfing pickles will snort the glue.

  rolling in your own fecal mounds,
  el sacapuntas es grande,
  listening to jibberesh sounds,
  the pencil sharpener is big.

  anger hate rage it's all the same,
  anus peck will conquor the cat,
  you can't hide your aqua toned shame,
  the ferret's leg is very fat.

  is this ever going to end?
  the tv screen will not give up,
  complete fun to you i will now rend,
  the bottle just had sixteen pups.

  singing faries dance around me,
  the toothpaste is stuck on the sink,
  spoons as far as the eye can see,
  the green toga it wore was pink.

  antidisestablishmentist,
  i think peg had a pickup truck,
  your supple lips i once did kiss,
  denny allways danced in the muck.

  you want to suck on my table,
  the sea beast was rather gentle,
  i want to look like clark gable,
  the smart cat was in fact mental.

  my love for thee is thousand strong,
  the pretzel sticks i ate were good,
  i am wearing a skimpy thong,
  once jenny ate the ing of pud.

  twenty eight point eight vFast class,
  plastic has its advantages,
  how i like to eat sasifras,
  guys have one extra appendage.

  i love this tandy onethousand,
  vampires are not really too hostile,
  now i really want this to end,
  sterioids exceed the percentile.

  i'd say this is the last stanza,
  cologne can smell as good as you,
  i so very happy, pizza,
  oh fucking yay this poem is through.

  it's hard to communicate these kind of emotions sometimes.
