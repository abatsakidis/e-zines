  yeap, here's another part of the story about your favorite toes...

  %U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%U%

  we left our five toes and frennie hannibal in their character
  development stages...

  "the end is neigh!", the old man crackled at the top of his lungs.

  "oh geeze, he's at it again, that's all we need.", remarked frennie as
  he kicked sand in the old man's face, and ran as fast as he could into
  the savannah with his new operated foot.  little did he realize that
  his toes were allready formulating thier plans for world domination
  and taking over the cheese industries of the world.

  "eh heh heh", cackled pinky, "we shall first take over the leading
  industries in tokyo, starting with the intel factory, and work
  our way up to the lakehurst mcdonald's."

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  "say it asshole, say it loud and proud you punk!"

  "i'm sorry, i'm sorry that i had ever looked at you biff."

  swallowing his pride by appologizing to the school's bully, frennie
  appologized for glancing at biff.  walking home he heard a small voice
  come from below him.

  "we can make all of your problems disappear, once and forever.  never
  coming back... we can be your all."

  frantically looking around, frennie tried to locate the origin of the
  voice.  he finally cried out to the mysterious voice:

  "down here, inside of your shoes.  take a look, take off your shoes
  and let us out."

  sitting down on the sidewalk he slowly and cautiously he unfastened
  the velcro that held his shoes closed.  his jaw dropped in amazement.

  "gosh jolly geewilliquors!", shouted frennie.  "what 'da fark are
  you?", cried frennie.

  from mrs. crosbey's fence frennie suprisingly hears, "well, what did
  you expect, we are your toes."

  now frennie was really confused.  first he thought his toes were
  talking to him, now he was receiving voices from all kinds of
  inanimate objects such as rocks, trees, and benches.

  "stop it vinnie, we have business to take care of with our buddy here
  frennie" came a tiny little voice from his pinky toe.  "let me
  introduce myself, i'm pinky... and starting from the toe next to me is
  uratosokudogitsu, then there's cassandra, then vinnie, and finally our
  not so bright friend, butch."

  "now that i know who you are, and you obviously know who i am, what
  the hell are you doing on my foot?!?!"

  "we were put here by doctor farkle, the one who operated on your
  feet.  you must warn the world, he wants to conquor the world, for the
  time is coming of your eminant destruction!"

  "great, now i'm hallucinating... what could happen next?" sighed
  frennie.

  at that moment, frennie felt a sharp pain in the back of his skull and
  everything went black.  this was probably brought about by a short man
  hitting him in the back of the head with a brick.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  what seemed to be moments later, but was actually several hours later,
  frennie woke up from his abrubtly brought about sleep by a cup of cold
  water to his face.

  "get up."  said a dark voice from within the shadows.

  "what... uh... ow... great i'm bleading... what do you want from me?"

  "we want to employ you, we need your help with saving the world."

  "great, i'm hallucinating again, listen buddy, i'm not the world's
  salvation, i'm not a martyr or anything of the sort, so if you will
  just let me go..."

  as frennie started to get up and turn around, a strong hand shoved him
  right back into his original position.

  "listen, don't go anywhere, i don't want you to get hurt any more than
  you want to get hurt.  now the mad scientist dr. farkle has implanted
  the five toes of the armageddon into your left foot.  when we
  kidnapped you the five toes disconnected from your body and joined
  together to form an entity called captain toe jam!!!  we need you to
  keep them from completing their plans."

  "let me get this straight, my left foot is going to destroy the world,
  summon up a character named captain toe jam!!! and the doctor that
  implanted my artificial toes was actually a mad scientist.  next thing
  you're going to tell me is that you're going to implant fingers into
  my right hand that are going to fight these five toes of the
  armageddon or something."

  "as a matter of fact, yes."

  "oh great, how could this get any wors... what the fuck?!?!?"

  a needle was abruptly shoved into frennie's arm and he was injected
  with a high dosage of a personal concoction of the mystery doctor.

  "fuck me..." said frennie as he lapsed into his second coma of the
  day.
