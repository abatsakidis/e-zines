high drama, by crank

"mommydaddy, I want you to meet my new boyfriend!"

<cerkit spits on the carpet>

"hi. nice to <snort> meet you. hey, do you have a candle so I can warm up
 this smack i've been saving up?"

"uh, jenny," the mother carefully says, "do you really think this is
the type of boy you want to spend your time with?"

"mother! you don't UNDERSTAND me at ALL!"

<girl runs out of house>

<cerkit pulls his pants back up and leaves after her>

<sex ensues on the front lawn>

a night in the life of jubjub, by jubjub

i drank this whole bottle of apricot flavored brandy, and then i borrowed
some money from my brother, and i left my house. my parents aren't home, 
so i was walking around and i saw these girls and they were talking to 
each other, and i sat down next to them. i sat there playing with a leaf, 
and they said "chris, do you have any alcohol?" and i said, "sure, and my 
parents aren't home" and they said "awesome". and then they came back to 
my house, and they drank this tequila and some wild turkey, then this 
girl, miyita, she called this guy jeremy, and talked to him for a while, 
and he knew she was drunk, so he hung up, and she kept talking, then she 
went to my bathroom, peed, threw up, then passed out, so i started 
laughing really hard and i starting making out with this girl, who i 
really liked named thera, and i sk0red (i'm 13, so "scoring" is making 
out with a girl and figering her) and i fingered her (whee) and wee made 
out for thirty minutes, and then i went to the bathroom and started 
kicking her friend, who woke up, and then her mom came and picked them up.
i am awesome. shit i am drunk
whee

poetry, by unknown

There were the Scots
Who kept the Sabbath
And everything else they could lay their hands on.
Then there were the Welsh
Who prayed on their knees and their neighbors.
Thirdly there were the Irish
Who never knew what they wanted
But were willing to fight for it anyway.
Lastly there were the English
Who considered themselves a self-made nation
Thus relieving the Almighty of a dreadful responsibility.

i no longer hear the woman-spirit in the tree, by suicidal chicken

i never could take a hint, whether for
good or bad, so don't be cross with me, for
not once did I intend to make you feel
uncomfortable or act rude or at all
unpleasant.  Maybe, maybe i tried too
hard to endear myself to you.  But then
i realize it will not make any kind 
of difference three short years from today
if you counted me as a friend in the scheme 
of your relationships, and you looked for
me after graduation so you could 
tell me goodbye forever; we both know
i'm not what you want, that no matter what 
i do, all you can ever give is a 
trite conversation or a brief, insincere
"thank you" dropped like a bottle rolling off
a bar that tumbles and wakes a drunk from
grand visions, as your drunken words awake
me from the dreams i had of holding you 
in that first precious bloom of love that grows
and fixes itself as a gentle and 
sweet period in otherwise a lame,
absurdly tragic and strange pattern of
hoped-for relationships that have not 
and never will come to fruition, but 
rather wither and die like my words you
find sickly sweet, all in hope that i could
change your heart, make you what you aren't, and
that you could quicken me, and cheat the bleak
fate that alarmingly becomes more clear 
and more apparent with each passing day,
that i have been eternally cursed as  
rude, awkward, and overbearing, like so 
much wet sand: not only smothering but
removed and shaken and washed off when the 
acceptance of day is gone and it is time 
to change to clothes more suitable for the night,
as you exchange me as the summer nears.
So go then, i shall not pursue; i'm done
with questing and with chasing after your
sweet little solar systems of friends, so
do not concern yourself with the fear that
i might fall into orbit or disturb  
and bother you, even so little that you 
might be the first to wave as we pass by.
