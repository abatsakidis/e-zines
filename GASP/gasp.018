the scene has hit is at a low.  chromatik, the symbol of loyalty, has left
blade.  twisted terroist left acid, and those two formed blah!, their own
dual group (like ld's solo project, its just them 2).  5 other people
besides tt left acid today.  i was told by a reliable source that somms is
thinking of going solo himself.  look at the scene.  the scene is done, the
scene is just about dead.

the 'old timers' (those that have been or where around for the last few
years) have said that the scene was lame.  it was time for people like ck,
gh, and others, to take it over, and make it 'our scene' again.
unfortunally, it hasn't happened.  we were handed the 'scene' on a silver
platter, we were allowed to do what we wanted with it, and unfortunally, we
couldn't.

there was a scene with no big group politics, no harrassment, and people not
taking it so seriously.  this existed only a few months ago.  then, everyone
needed to start their own groups (this isn't in reference to solo projects,
these are good things).  everyone went on ego trips, and suddenly,
everyone's board was the best.

now, the scene we have today has constant pressure, same old shit, no matter
who says it will be different, and harrassment.  we have a scene where
obvious white people can call each other bitches and niggers and gain
'respect'.  13 year olds can draw an ansi, charge 20 bucks for it, call
themselves a ho-ass-niggah, and lead a group.

this is our scene, we can do what we want with it.  lets see something good
come out of it.  it shouldn't be hard, if we bond together and overtake the
hierarchy.  a coup is in line.  show the people who 'lead' the scene who
really should 'lead'.  let your voices be heard, no matter who small, no
matter what group you are in, you are part of this scene, and you are an
important part of this scene.

thats basicly it.  its our scene now, its up to us to decide what to do,
if we want a good scene, we shall have a good scene, but not without
work.  we have one more chance, the clock is striking twelve soon, and
soon, there will be hell to pay.
