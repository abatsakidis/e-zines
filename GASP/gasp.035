(Hey Jude)
I wish
that you were dead.
I would open
up your hea-a-ead.
and remember, to eat up all of your brains,
while your blood drains,
and makes the floor redder,
redder redder redder redder redder redder redder ow!
na, na na na na na na
na na na na, hey corpse.


(From The Sound of Music)
Blood, a red, a liquid red,
Flesh, a rotting corpse.
Bones, a white, a sunbleached white,
Guts, a tasty sight.
What a delight!


(Right Said Fred)
I'm too deadly for my ax,
too deadly for my ax,
too deadly for my,
my forty wacks.
Yeah, I'm a killer, ya know what I mean,
And I do my last rites on the death row.
Yeah on the death row, on the death row, yeah,
I do my last rites on the death row.


(Gerardo)
We want the chair,
gotta have that chair.
Rico, Swav‚,
prell y denorex
shampoo
It's all tasty.


(Stand)
Kill, in the place that you live,
c'mon now think about motives
wonder why you have them now,
Kill, in the place that you live,
c'mon now think about motives
wonder why you haven't killed him before.
These are the weapons, bodies are fallin'
Listin to Satan, the Devil is callin'"


(More Beatles)
I want to eat your ha-a-and,
I want to eat your haaaaaaaaaaaaaand!


(The King of Pop)
It's dead, it's white
It's d, its w, it's yeah yeah yeah!
