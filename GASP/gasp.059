                 going ape shit press #59 by pip/ilsundal/rattle
                    "fucking bitch i love you, i'm not crazy"

w0w0w0w00w... gasp survived for about eight months... released 58 issues in a
five month period... got an international distrobution site (who probably 
never saw a single issue of it other than the 33 that i dcc'd to rimgale that
one day =])

i was thinking of making it a long winded issue, or an issue where i talked
about how things have changed, how zines aren't what they used to be, or
how things are going to be better... but i'm not... it's going to end in a
k-lame irc capture...

(pip2) share your feelings with the group
(rATTLE) i mean.. i have read things scralled on teh back of bathroom stalls
that have givven me more content than teh average issue of gasp..
(Ilsundal) now we're getting somewhere..
(pip2) have you scratched your ass and had more major revalations than you
have when you read an issue of gasp?
(rATTLE) lamenet sucked too.. well toward the end anyway..  at least lamenet
was cool at one point..  gasp jsut.. SUCKS..
(rATTLE) yea.. at least when i scratch my ass somethign falls every now and
then..
(pip2) yes... yes... tell me more... just don't be ashamed to tell me your
feelings... we're all your friends here
(rATTLE) the reason gasp formed was lame..  because you sucked too much to
do anything w/ mat.. and you jerk off too much.. i don't know what the
signafigance of the jerking off thing is.. but i just felt like saying it..
suck a dick.
(Ilsundal) oh my!

it...

i can tell you this as a true friend:  Your Zine SUCKS.  Kill yourself.
