                               spam land

  here in the legendary spam land,
  where everyone has spam at hand,
  they make the mystery meat so grand,
  here, in teh legendary spam land.

  the feast o'spam is being prepared now,
  is it from pig, or chicken, or rat or cow?
  well, it's too late to wonder who or how,
  the feast o' spam is being prepared now.

  we're waiting for our very tasty dish,
  it is so much more delictable than i could wish,
  and if you pinch your nost it won't smell like fish,
  we're waiting for our very tasty dish.

  here it is, but it does look oh so vile,
  it has the color of some old man's bile,
  i've never had it, but i can wait a while,
  and here it is, but it does look oh so vile.

  all the dinner guests aren't exactly enjoying themselves,
  they're all excanging several "oh well"s,
  this is worse than the torture of one thousand hells,
  and the dinner guests aren't exactly enjoying themselves.

  i'm in touch with my sensitive side, you motherfuck.
