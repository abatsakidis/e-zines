                         why hogs of enthropy sucks

  mogel's just cashing in on the big swing of boards going from warez,
  to ansi, then to zines... i mean, he acts like he has a brain in his
  head, but i sincerely doubt it.

  he claims that people fear him, that hoe 'r0x', and that he's a 'k00l
  d00d'... i think that he's just a blubbering idiot.  but that's only
  me...  (but i'm allways right)

  i've been doing 'zines for about a year and seven months, longer than
  most people i know have been bbsing... so i've been around, seen
  'zines come and go, been with the best of them (MiLK), and laughed at
  the worst of them (PoT)...  but there's the mediocre ones, such as
  hoe... nothing worth writing home about, hardly worth having on your
  bbs, and just a waste of hard drive space and time on #zines.

  i'd say the best 'zine, t-file group, whatever you want to call it, is
  my own, going ape shit press.  there's nothing wrong with us, i'm not
  a dictator, a conniving bastard like mogel is... i'm just a laid back
  kinda dude with nothing better to do with my spare time.  hoe just
  pales in comparison to us... completely and fully...

  not only that, but i know for a fact that mogel doesn't shower.

  yes, that's right boys and girls, good old m0g3l doesn't shower at
  all, the last time he showered was back in the summer of '86... but
  then he just lost it, went crazy, and started to play nintendo twenty
  four hours a day... and then he found a modem... tried to be 3l1t3 and
  all... failed miserably... and is now just a putz who sets up k0nFz
  because he's a poser...

  i bet he listened to rap in the 80's...

  i think that he goes down the shore, with sagging jeans and a beotch
  with a halter top that looks like courtney love, and his lowriding
  pickup truck that has horrible problems with speed bumps.

  (i bet his low rider gets cought in the middle of speed bumps and just
   kinda balances on them, with tires spinning and m0g3l kUrz1nG his head
   off...)

  i bet mogel just wants to be exactly like me... elite and
  everything...
