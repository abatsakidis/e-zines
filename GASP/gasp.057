                        To the Deposed Princess

So it's all over now, and it's time to face up
to never seeing your face there in the
row to my left, or ever facing me
across an embrace that just seemed to make
it all worth while, and seem to make it
all right again, and all forgiven, like
before, when I loved you and I thought that
you would at least show some compassion as
I watched my last days of youth go down with
our what-ever-we-had (don't ask me, I guess
I never knew) turn me into a sad,
confused man that thought he had found what
he had sought for for so long, just a girl,
no, rather a young lady, (A Madam
Moiselle, if you please, Bruyere.) who would just
be a break from the constant run around
of girls that resemble (quite consciously)
the Bayside cheering squad, and guys that see
life through their helmet's black sun visor. And
yet you were always different, but not for
just being different's sake, but for your own.
I guess I could have learned a lot from you,
if we had only given me the chance
to get to know you, to endear myself
to you, as you have most completely done
to me. I've asked high school queens to proms and
felt less scared, rather, less hopeful, of what
was to come as when I did simply call
you. And I'd rather an affirmative
from you than any high school royalty,
Princess. So please, can I just ask you to
give up a little of your summer to
spend some time helping me to find enough
joy and resolve to make it without you.
