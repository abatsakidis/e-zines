Workers Fail Teachers  Teachers  Fail  Work
Teachers Fail Workers  Works Failures Teach


"I don't accept late work,          I fail
so you fail."                       to see how the success of work
Rang out my teacher                 can teach
regarding work                      as much as the failures
that I somehow failed.              of work.

What did I fail?                    And what matter temporial work?
Not to do the work                  We must all fail
that was given by the teacher.      in the end.  Life teaches
I only failed                       us how to work
to punctually do the work.          towards death, the inevitable
failure.

If I work                           So then fail
how can I fail                      me, I work
to teach                            towards teaching
myself through the work             myself how failure
and its failures.                   is the whole point of work.
