          going ape shit press issue #1 by pip the angry youth

  well, i guess i'll tell you why we're having another text group come
upon the scene.  milk and tea was getting to damned big, so i made
gasp... gasp is going to be purely a small group... consisting of no
more than say... six people at a time... the current roster of people
writing for us are scruple, me, bloody mess, exodus, and someone else i
forget their name.

  the stories will be of all kinds, horror, medeval, humor, non-fiction,
and everything else that is a story.  i'm going to try to keep it on a
regular release rate... say once in a while or so.

===============================================================================
                     current situation on the text scene

  god, can you say 'dead' boys and girls?  i mean no one wants to read
anymore... unless it's some k-rad elite-o file like MoRGue or some
crap...  i mean there's 2,000,000 texts out there about hacking, phreaking,
carding, anarchy, and other illegalities... but there are like 2,000 max
out there that are made my humor groups or just creative writing groups
like gasp.  everyone wants to know how to blow their fingers off, yet
they don't want to laugh, cry, or anything.  i hate this.

  tho ruled and kicked ass when it was around, milk was awesome, tanj
and tls both were great... but then there was mat.  a group that just
became so big that it couldn't move it's ass... there were 3 seinior
staff members, 3,000 writers, 2,012 distrobution sites all over, 5,000
texts waiting to be released... but no organization.  that's why we have
gasp coming at you... no distrobution sites, just a text group that is
going to circulate around at the descretion of the people who download
it.  spread it around, LET YOUR VOICE BE HEARD!  text groups are about
the only way you can get your voice out there... with everyone else on
chat boards and having their ears covered by pretty ansi blocks on the
screen there's hardly anywhere for someone to be heard.

  i'm pissed off and i'm not going to take it anymore.

  gasp is a big finger up in the air and a hearty fuck you to everyone
else.  hey everyone:  FUCK YOU!  ack, that felt great.  =]

===============================================================================
                   how to be elite and have everyone hate you

  well, it seems that warez are now dead pretty much in nj... so now
everyone's going art board.  one board decides to go art here (tlorah)
and all of a sudden every board around here decides to delete all of
their pirated stuff and go completely legit and art.  GET A FUCKING CLUE
PEOPLE.  i mean, the night light was the coolest art board in the area,
and then it went down with merely a whisper.  (great, now where will i
register dementia?)  and people ask me why i deleted all of the art
packs on atomic cafe... it's because you can get them on basically every
other fucking board in the area... why wase precious space on k-rad ansi
packs from ACiD, relic, union, onion, and whatever other groups there
are out there doing art... the sysop of atomic cafe won't let me make
his board a text board (wait, pms is allready there), so then i guess we
could allways make it a warez board (oops there too... allready many of
those around here), hmmm... what could i make it... shareware pd board?
nah, there's millions of those here.  porno?  nope, allready a bunch of
those... a message base board!  no... everyone's busy on c/c chatting
each other and using internet, so posting has been dead here... what
else is there to do with it?  nothing... what i'm trying to say is this:
everyone's suping up their board, but there's too many boards around
here so there's 2,000 boards specializing in the same thing...  do ocean
county a favor and hack and crash a local board today...

                        how to get your sister into bed

  have you noticed yet that the titles of each of these have nothing to
do with what i'm typing about?  well that will change in future issues
of gasp... you see i just started my 2nd semester of college and i have
about 3 hrs a day there with nothing to do... so i figure that i'm going
to write alot of shit for gasp... and i know all of it's going to get
released because i run the fucking thing...

  let me tell you a little about myself... like you care.

  i'm 6'3" tall, dark blue eyes, 175 lbs, an occasional gotee, an
elementary education major at a community college, horny like a mother
fucker, bored to piss, and feel myself slowly slipping into
uninterestingness.

  bah, there's me in one sentence... i figured i could allways do it
like this:

  name: pip the angry youth
  sex: m
  age: 19
  height: 6'3"
  eyes: blue
  hair: dirty blonde
  turn ons: feathers on my stomach, satin sheets, lace
  turn offs: passing gass in bed, hairy women, 'large' women
  pet peeves: gum on my shoe, working, school, responsibility
  favorite movie: debbie does the lower east side
  favorite group: the dead milkmen
  likes: walks on the beach, sunsets, the moon, sex
  dislikes: nails in my feet, kicks in the crotch

  there you go, pip the angry youth as a pin up... bah...  here's a self
portrait of me...

   
  /Û\       do you see my little dinky???  it's right there!
  /'\

  yeah, i admit, i have a dinky... it's actually like 3 feet long... but
i had to shorten it a bit for the screen... i didn't want to make this a
10 meg text file =]...

  well, that's about all for gasp #1... the next issue will contain more
words and more words... and different combonations of the same words...
and maybe even extended asskey chars... because we're elite...
