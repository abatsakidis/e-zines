  edi's back!  this time he's talking about a very important social
issue... i don't want to get too in depth about it... but let's just see
what he's got to say...

                                mentos


        Mentos...  Mentos are good.. Mentos are fine..  But there's
always something that goes along with the candy; the commercials... I
mean, the commercials for Mentos are the stupidiest things one can ever
create.  If there's a advertising firm that is actually paid for these
commercials, all of the members of that firm should be drug out into the
street and have their nuts chopped off..

        For example, in one commercial, a guy and his friends are
crossing the street..  A limosine drives up, and seperates the group as
they are crossing.  The guy is stuck on the other side of the car, and
rather then go around it, he whips out a pack of Mentos and smiles, and
opens the door and walks through the limosine as the guy is on the
phone!

        What is with this? I mean, are Mentos the ultimate candy that
destroy all boundaries of rich and the poor? Good and evil?  Does it
crush the lines of every social, economic, and natural barriers?  Is it
the supreme fruit flavor candy of the universe?  Should we all look
towards it for leadership?  Should we all build shrines to it in our
bathrooms and light incense and bow down to its holyness? No, I think
not.

        Theres a lesson to be learned from this folks.  A Candy cannot
rule your life.  Commercials do lie.. As much as you think having a pack
of Strawberry Flavored Mentos in your pocket at the exact time you break
a heal will suddenly give you the power to rip off the other heal, you
are wrong my friend.  Listen, learn, and be wise, candy is not the
supreme leader, spam is, and always will be.

gasp!  blink!  spam!  oh no!

ok, for all of you the hidden obvious trivia buffs, if you remember,
spam is out... but what is in?  in a future issue, i shall let you know
who has identified what meat product is what's in now... for spam is
getting too old... (go look through your old tho files, you'll see it
there in the bottom of it...)
