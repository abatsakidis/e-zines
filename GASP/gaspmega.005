  first off i'd like to review the new summer tv linup... but only the
  shows that i feel will be worth watching at all.  i have also
  implimented a rating system involving stars

  ***** - excillent
  ****  - decent
  ***   - ok
  **    - uhmm...
  *     - i'd rather spend my time reading MiLK

  network and slot: nbc, thrusday nights at 8pm
  program: i'm right and you're wrong, wrong wrong wrong wrong!
  summary: watch the zany antics of the lovely and talented james
           hetfield as he tries to cope with the normal hustle and
           bustle of a college kid's life.  everything from his bisexual
           girlfriend to the every day torrid humdrum that is a college
           boy's life.  second season. *** and 1/2

  network and slot: nbc, friday nights at 9pm
  program: oh those crazy lesbians!
  summary: a spin off comedy from the hit show "i'm right and you're
           wrong, wrong wrong wrong wrong!".  centered around the life
           of rebecca, a one time heterosexual woman who finds members
           of the same sex suddenly extremely attractive after dating
           james hetfield.  the hilarity builds as we watch rebecca try
           to hide her sexuality from her boyfriend until the season's
           finale when james walks in on her with his very own mother!
           ****

  network and slot: fox, saturday mornings at 6am
  program: the molesto the clown show
  summary: watch the zany antics of molesto the clow (played by justin
           labarge) every saturday morning!  everything from playing
           "find the salami in the jaccuzi" with the boys in the
           audience to "pet 'skinny' the spitting snake" with the female
           members.  all this and more road runner cartoons and popeye
           cartoons than you can shake a stick at.  *

  network and slot: cbs, monday afternoon at 3pm
  program: cerkit's hour of hate
  summary: inspired by the novel _1984_, matt baumbach takes us on a
           trip of unrelenting anger, frustration and general angst.
           every show is unique with surprises at every corner.  segments
           ranging from the normal to the bizzare; "grrr!@  i'm so
           angry!@", "what sucks", and "i hate myself and everything
           around me" are just a sample of the festivities.  ***

  network and slot: abc, thursday nights at 8:55pm
  program: tommy tells you a tale
  summary: everyone needs a pick-me-up, and this is mine.  i religiously
           watch this program.  a virtuoso of self-affirmations and "i'm
           special!" speaches.  a must-see.  ****** (6@!#)

  well, that's about it for now... once i take a look through the tv
  guide next week i might just have something else.
