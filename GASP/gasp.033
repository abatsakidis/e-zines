         ode to the woman on the macy's spring sale catalog cover

  she doesn't realize it yet, but she's going to be my bride someday, i
first saw her on the cover of a catalog.

  i was leafing through the sunday's paper, searching for something to
read while i was on the toilet, and there she was.  the world's most
beautiful woman was looking at me...  lovely eyebrows, perfectly shaped
lips... wild hair... and lovely speckled freckles.  the one thing that
captured my heart above all was her eyes.  the loveliest green of all
creation...  there is not one thing wrong with her, and her taste of
clothing in the catalog is just splendid... she is more beautiful than a
new pair of snow tires.

  if you know her, or are her... write me internet mail at
pip@cybercom.com... i want to meet you, and become your husband..  i
will be the best husband that has ever existed...  please marry me...

  well, i bought this album a while back, during my discount bin
splurging days... and i thought it looked nifty... so i grabed it (for 2
bucks, how could you go wrong?)... well, i didn't like industrial music
at the time, so i just threw it into a drawer... i just played it for
the first time in 3 years, and i am in love with the album... just
thought i'd tell you about it... get that album... it's a picture of a
guy with short/long black hair spiked with the picture cut apart... it's
pretty spiffy...

                                ode to me

pip, you suck monkey balls
mother looks at you and falls
people run away in the halls
you are alone in the bathroom stalls
