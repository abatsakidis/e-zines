                   johnny smoke by the butthole surfers

  this here song is about john w. smoke junior.

  its about being loved and loving love and hating love and loving love
  and hateless love that revolves around the loveless hate that's a
  hateless love and the loves that's loving love and the hate that's
  hate and love and it's loving the hate.

  it's about john w. smoke's mom, it's with his mom, it's about his mom,
  it's about his mom, it's about loving his mom, and being without his
  mom and loving the hate that's hating the love that's loving his mom
  and all the time they're there.  hating the hate that's loving the
  hate that hates the hate.  it's loveless hate.

  and it goes something about like this:

  johnny smoke, oh johhny smoke.  john smoke.  oh johnny smoke.  oh
  johnny smoke... johnny johnny johnny john....!  john, john smoke.  johnny
  smoke.  here we go.

  john, john was a little crippled midgit lesbian boy, but he stood ten
  foot tall with a knife!

  pretty soon the mole had appeared on john's left leg, and ropelike it
  extended out four hundered and sixty nine different miles, and verily
  verily it   was sixty nine different nuns, speaking simultaniously to
  john in  sixty nine different languages.  and it evolved itself and it
  was the legless dog that became a cyclone out of john's father's
  forehead.  and there it was, like a twinky with a halo storm in it.  and
  it revolved down into the sky and it talked to john like he was a
  little puppy himself.  and john said that i am not the magma, i am not the
  crust and i shall evolve.  and the rain and it come down and it washed on
  john, and he said that i will be a cigarette butt before it all is
  done.  and they said no, you are the flame itself, and you will burn
  pure in the south american sky where the blood dogs worship the still
  worm.

  johnny smoke, oh johnny smoke.  john smoke.  eeeeaaaaawow...  johnny
  smoke, oh johnny smoke....  johnny smoke, john smoke...   oh johnny
  johnny johnny johnny (etc...)

  and so brainless legless hairlessly the foil tipped condom itself
  had revealed to john that the q. e. two luxury liner had extended out of
  john's left side.  and so it had greed to him mars, witch swam
  backwards and effortlessly they did evolve.  downward they fell like a
  thin sheet of waste product that had come onto john's body.  his
  body was no longer the tri-vehicle express himself.  and he could not
  leave the dog.  and the dog's eyes wich had blood coming out like they
  were ropes around john's legs and they pulled him up like he was a
  canoe.  and he flew on the life essence itself to south america where
  he was in love...

  o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o_o

  if you had _any_ idea how hard it was to transcribe this song, you'd
  have alot more respect for me =]
