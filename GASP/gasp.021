                                experiments

     "Whoa, he's still doing it," I though to myself as I heard a woman's
blood-curdling shriek of terror.  But I will explain this madness...

     It was a warm mildly breezy day in mid-August, last year, when I
witnessed the most puzzling and gruesome of all situations, the type
encounterable only in horror films and novels, or so I thought.  I was
taking a relaxing stroll down the side of the road, enjoying the serenity
of the evening, when I heard a muffled scream emanating from the house of
Robert McRoberts.  Robert, or Bert as he wished to be called, was an
individual of all-encompassing oddity, his personality equally as queer as
his name.  Being my curious self, I headed towards Bert's dwelling.  After
ringing the doorbell and waiting for a short period of time, I deduced he
didn't notice the door annunciator light, and seeing his car in the
driveway, I headed around to the back of his house to see if he was there.

     There he was.  After getting to the side of his house, I decided to
try the gate, but knowing it is usually locked, I was quite suprised to
find it unlatched, although what was inside suprised me to a greater
extent.  I saw Bert in a butcher's apron, standing in front of a
rectangular wooden box with a chainsaw at his feet. Just as I entered his
backyard, he started it, and began fingering the throttle until the engine
was running smoothly.  He began to increase pressure on the throttle
trigger, and the chainsaw was running faster now.  He brought the blade of
the saw onto the small box in front of him, and began cutting. All seemed
normal, and he had not as of yet noticed me.  Eventually the pitch of the
saw changed, and I observed a thick red liquid splattering on the
surroundings, and oozing from the relatively wide kerf of the chainsaw
blade.  "Blood?" I thought, unconsiously, aloud to myself.  Remembering
that Bert was deaf, or as he so tactfully stated his disability: "Aurally
Challenged", brought me great relief.

     Spotting a rope nearby, conveniently out of his field of vision, I
made myself a harness to restrain Bert, for I believed he was intentionally
performing a violent crime against humanity. The same moment he stopped his
chainsaw I made my move, suprising Bert and managing to keep him restrained
in my makeshift harness.  Making Bert face me, I asked him: "What the f**k
are you doing?"  He just shrugged his shoulders.  I pried off the top of
the hastily crafted box, and to my suprise, I found seven rabbit corpses
lined up and restrained neatly, the first four with a saw kerf intersecting
their neck, and dark red blood staining their fur.  I iterated myself:
"What the fuck are you doing?"  He replied in a sure, strong voice,
"Crafting props for a new Nine Inch Nails video."  I chuckled.  "Yeah
right," I though to myself, "They would hire professionals to do that."
Solved curiosity number one.

     I then lifted Bert's face out of the dirt, and proceeded to drag him
into his house.  What was inside suprised me more.  It was neat and tidy.
So unlike the Bert I was acquainted with several years before.  I started
searching his house.  I didn't find anything out of the ordinary, in fact,
I didn't find a thing that seemed the least bit askew.  I put Bert in his
linen closet, so I could safely examine his basement.  I opened the door to
his basement, and walked down the stairs, my curiosity peaked, for I heard
something stir.  When I turned on the light, I saw a gruesome sight.  A
rack of animal heads on a rack, and a group of six women.  The setup was
quite elaborate, almost laboratory quality, having one room with three
women and a rack of real animal heads, and the other with three women
facing a video screen displaying the same animal heads.  After treking
upstairs and querying Bert, I found the true reason and meaning of his
actions in a long talk, but I have been sworn to secrecy until Bert's life
ceases...
