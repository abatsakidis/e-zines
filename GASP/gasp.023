              going ape shit press #23 by pip the angry youth

  hey, i'm sorry that i have to do this... but desperate times call for
desperate measures...

=======/=======/=======/=======/=======/=======/=======/=======/======/=======
                            all appologies

  i'm dropping gasp... no if ands or butts.  i'm sick of running my own
magazine and having everyone think that it's +my+ job to get then the
newest issues as soon as they get out... there's 2 ftp sites for gasp...
i think that it's easy enough for the morons to find the issues on the
internet, for FREE!... i simply don't have time to run a magazine, with
finals for college, work, and trying to find a girlfriend to appease my
lustful genitals.

  i may write sproratic issues for h0e or whatnot, but i don't think
that i'm goign to ever have my own mag again because it's just not worth
the trouble.  i'm sorry for whatever inconvience this may cause to you,
but you'll just have to live with it.

  there will allways be t-files circulating around by me, on all sorts
of boards, under all sorts of other people's group names...  i have
nothing else to say to you... except...

  i was just kidding.  i'm not leaving gasp.

this file is dedicated to rattle... i thought he'd enjoy it alot more
than others would...
