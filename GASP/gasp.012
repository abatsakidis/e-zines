                            TRASHMAN GETS FLUSHED

  The Trashman awoke with a pounding in his temples and the rancid taste of 
stale bleach fumes in his mouth.  When he first began to get up, his spine
felt as if peices of broken glass had been wedged between each if its disks.
Needless to say, this latest turn of events did little to improve on his 
already really bad mood.  He hauled himself clumsily from the dumpster and 
again began lumbering towards his destination, Spred Refuse's address.  while
he'd been sleeping off the more pleasant effects of his bleach induced 
drunkenness, word had traveled throughout Lanfil about the trash heap that 
walked like a man and was on a mission to seek out and destroy LITTER.  The 
youth groups that Hiam had organized in his former life to battle LITTER were
back on the streets cleaning up the town, only this time they were being 
helped not only by Lanfil's sanitation department, but also by other community
members and former converts of LITTER, who through the efforts of the Trashman
had seen the error of their ways, and now wanted to do their part to reverse 
the damage that had been inflicted on the town.
  Although the Trashman should have been cheered by what he saw on his way to 
Spred's home, he knew that everything would fall apart again unless he could 
destroy LITTER, by cutting off the head of the movement, by destroying the man
who had destroyed himself, Spred Refuse.  With a renewed resolve, Trashman 
headed purposfully towards his next targets home at a more rapid pace.
  To Trashman's dismay, Spred was not home and there was an envelope taped to 
his front door addressed to Trashman.  Apparently, one of Spred's very few 
still loyal disciples had warned him of the trashman's coming, thus taking 
away the element of surprise.  Infact, the little worm had left him an invi-
tation to come and get him on his front door.  In the envelope, there was
a note from Spred saying that he would be enjoying a day of snorkelling at
the Lanfil sewage treatment plant and if the Trashman was man enough, he could
come join him at his leisure.  Trashman was furious, this was an outrage, the 
little punk should be cowering in some dark corner or trying to run from him,
but instead, the man responsible for what the Trashman had become, was 
arrogantly defying him to come and get his revenge.  His mind was so clouded 
with rage and the after effects of his encounter with bleach, that he never
even stopped to think that Spred might be setting him up again.
  When Trashman came crashing through the fence at the sewage treatment plant,
Spred Refuse was lazily snorkeling in the primary settling tank looking for 
large chunks of raw sewage to add to his personal collection, a little hobby
he had that few understood.  Trashman, not even pausing, threw himself into 
the tank and started towards Spred.  Spred calmly swam over to the opposite 
edge of the tank, pulled himself out, and made his way over to a control panel
nearby.  As Trashman reached the midpoint of the tank, Spred flipped several 
switches on the control panel which activated the tanks filtration and 
treatment mechanism.  The machinery, of course, took the Trashman to be exactly
what he was, a large conglomeration of waste materials floating in the big 
tank of sewage and began efficiently breaking him up and processing his base
components.  Incredibly, the Trashman, once again did not die,in fact, he was
growing again at a truly alarming rate.  He realized that his mind was 
incorperating the sewage as part of his own polluted body and with the rate he
was growing at, it could only be a temporary solution, he would soon become too 
large and his mind too diffused to survive. 
  Acting swiftly and decisively, Trashman rose one towering watery hand from
the tank and snatched Spred from the edge where he had been gloating over the 
defeat and disposal of his greatest enemy.  As Trashman pulled Spred into 
himself and drown the life from him, he noticed that conscious thought was 
getting difficult and realized that his existence was about to be snuffed.
Drifting off into non-being, the Trashman reflected that it was probably for 
the best, before he would have been an inhuman freak among society, now, he 
was unfit to go among people. He had avenged himself and destroyed LITTER so
his life had not been given in vain, so with a tired gurgling sigh, Trashman
let himself finally dissapate throughout the sewage treatment system and 
eventually into the river that the system pumped out into.  He was composed 
of several trillion gallons when his mind finally winked out.
                             
                             THE END
