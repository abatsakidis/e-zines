The Kind Man's Burden

Take up the kind man's burden,
The strangest of his breed,
Go bind your life to exile,
To serve your histrionic need,
No way to lift his harness,
Now gone with fancies wild,
Afraid and enthralled by peoples,
Half grown and half child.

Take up the kind man's burden,
No time to abide,
Loss of youth's the terror,
In vain shows of pride.
To some it seems so simple,
The answer seems quite plain,
"By clique make your profit",
But is that profit gain?

Take up the kind man's burden,
And with his dears make peace,
To end this emotional famine,
And make this torture cease.
And to those who are nearest,
Their forgiveness is what is sought,
Watch his sloth and heather folly,
Bring all his hope to naught.

Take up the kind man's burden,
Noble as Hebrew kings,
Offence of one dear sweeper,
One of many tedious things.
Ne'er again shalt you enter,
Or on that dear path tread,
Why prolong this living,
When rest is for the dead.

Take up the kind man's burden,
Relieve his life so bored,
The love of those ye better,
The care for those ye guard.
Though amusing is thy humor,
To souls that see not the light,
Yet jesters in this bondage,
Learn their trades by night.

Take up the kind man's burden,
A privilege, none the less,
To gain thy beloved freedom,
Only through weariness.
And though thou cry and whisper,
Those pleas shalt not do,
To gain favor of those peoples,
That art so dear to you.

Take up the kind man's burden,
Growing short are your days,
You'll wear no wreath of laurel,
You'll receive no fleeting praise,
You just might gain your manhood,
After seventeen toilsome years,
Twill take, or bring you wisdom,
And gain or lose your peers.


(Based on Rudyard Kipling's
rhyme scheme and syntax from 
"The White Man's Burden")
