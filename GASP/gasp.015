                going ape shit press #15 lamesy jamesy

  with the coasting in neutral of milk and tea, i have taken it upon
myself to take in what was left over from milk and tea and turn it onto
the public.  here is one such issue that was never published.  enjoy it
whoreboys and whoregirls...

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\


--- Cold, typical winter day.  Long view of a bridge overlooking a mucky
    river.  Steve enters, stares out at the view.

STEVE:  Over. it's all finally over.

--- Forest.  Steve carries walking stick.  GENERIC FEMALE ACTRESS #1 walks
    along side Steve.

GFA#1: Regrets?

Steve: None.

GFA#1: Can't you turn back?

STEVE: Never again can I cross back onto the trail of emotional pestilence
       and famine I emerged from.

--- On the bridge. GENERIC FEMALE ACTRESS #2 leaning next to Steve.

GFA#2: But they love you.

STEVE: Love is a polluted river I dare not wade through.  It taints the
       clothes and irritates the flesh.  It corrodes the soul, tearing
       apart the single metaphysical appendange that can never heal.

--- Street corner.  GENERIC MALE ACTOR #1 leaning by Steve.

GMA#1: You have no money.  You have no car.

STEVE: Material possessions mean nothing to me.  Material possessions
       bog down the soul from reaching a state of Nirvana, a utopian
       tranquility with oneself.

--- The Forest.  By a flowing stream.  GENERIC FEMALE ACTRESS #2 and
    Steve looking out.

GFA#2: Isn't it beautiful?

STEVE: Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  To me, this world as we know
       it contains nothing that could justifiably be called aestetically
       pleasing.

GFA#2: But what about this?  Isn't this beautiful?  Nature is beautiful.

STEVE: Mother Earth sucked dry the feeling and emotion in my breast.  No,
       nature is simply beautiful in youth.  A facade.  Then it ages, and
       we see the truth, as it withers away and dies.

--- On the town.  Steve and GENERIC ACTOR #2

GMA#2: Hey buddy, got a match?

STEVE: The flame burning deep inside me was smothered long ago by society.
       Society has pilfered my will and strength to live and left me with
       its two prized possessions, insignifigance... and remorse.

GMA#2: ...Is that a no?

STEVE: In our world, too many times society tries to dictate to us a world
       where the answers are simple; A yes or a no; A true or a false; A
       multiple choice solution; a fill in the blank.  There are no answers;
       only more questions.

--- Living room of a house.  GENERIC ACTOR #1 and Steve.

GMA#1: Whoo-Hoo! Touchdown! (Goes to Hi-5 Steve)

STEVE: Haven't you ever though about whether or not the material world
       really exists?  What if we are simply the puppets of another's
       show?  How do you really KNOW that was a touchdown?  Maybe it was
       a field goal, maybe it was an interception.  Some outside force may
       be using you at their laboratory rat, making you believe that was
       a touchdown, to further weave their web of illusion upon you.

GMA#1: (Getting a tad annoyed) Maybe.

STEVE: Exactly.  Maybe.  Maybe yes, maybe no.  We don't know.  There is no
       answer we can conclude.  We can only ask more questions, which in
       turn yield no answers.

GMA#1: (Quite annoyed) ...Then WHY ask?

STEVE: Exactly!  Then why ask any questions at all! We have no formulas, we
       only have ideas that might have been instilled into our puny minds by
       outside forces!  I think you're finally realizing it all!  Life is
       like a box of chocolates, you either eat them right away and vomit
       all over your bathroom floor, or you let them melt and become
       dismembered globs of goo.

--- A graveyard.  Steve and GENERIC ACTRESS #1

GFA#1: She was so young.

STEVE: Death claims everyone someday.  Our own private armageddon is always
       lurking within our shadow.

GFA#1: At least she's in a better place.  God has mercy on those who deserve
       it.

STEVE: And how are we to be so sure of such a thing?  Our weak minds are not
       capable of fathoming such a colossal idea as higher beings.  However,
       there might now even BE higher beings.  Death may be the inevitable
       end of all eternity.

(GFA#1 breaks down crying)

STEVE: I wish I still had feelings of pain and suffering that I could
       express.  But this world we cohabitate has stripped me of everything
       except bitter remorse.  No, all those feelings that made me alive
       were buried long ago.

GFA#1: You.. asshole!

STEVE: How can I help but hurt others, considering the loathing I possess
       for humanity?  'tis 2 o'clock and all is lost.  Time marches on as
       it tramples the memories and willpower of ones who were once brave
       and strong.

--- Outside of Auditorium of Niles North.  Enter Steve.

STEVE: Yes, the place.  The place where all of our darkest and most
       destructive mores are learned.  Essentally, a persons attends this
       vile insitution to learn, to broaden their horizions.  Yet most of
       the "intellectual" only learn that they can lie, cheat, steal and
       swindle to get what they lust after.  Nobody leaves these doors
       "educated".  Sure, they can do a little math and have experienced
       the use of the comma, but they also come away with further developed
       prejudice and greed.  No, no, wherever you go, you still find out
       there is but one answer; that there is no answers.

(Eneter GENERIC FEMALE ACTRESS #3)

GFA#3: I just saw humanity at its usual revolting self.  A driver ran over
       a squirrel; his intestines splattered across the pavement like
       tomato paste over a pizza.  The driver stopped the car, went out into
       the street, stared at his work of massacre, and proceded to pick up
       the carcass.  Obviously, the driver thought he was doing a good turn
       to other drivers by removing the corpse off the highway.  Essentally,
       the driver never though about the beautiful creature he had just
       brought to its early yet grusome demise, he only thought of his own
       kind.  Us, as humans, only think about our own agendas, not about how
       we affect the rest of the universe.

STEVE: What are you talking about?  ...Most humans do not even consider
       how their faults affect other humans.  I do not believe their is a
       single homo-sapian in existense that does not have self-centered
       motivations.

GFA#3: (looking over at him) Excuse me?  I was not addressing such a
       feeble-minded imbecile as you; I was attempted to achieve a higher
       understanding of human nature by comtemplating it.

STEVE: You are obviously misled by transcendental philosophy; there are no
       answers to all the questions we ask.  There are only more questions
       to comtemplate.

GFA#3: There, you simpleton, are wrong.

STEVE: ...Am Not!

GFA#3: Are too!

STEVE: Am not!

GFA#3: Are too!

(Zoom out as they continue the nonsense.  Fade out.)
