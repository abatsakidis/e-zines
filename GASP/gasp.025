      Richard Milhous Nixon was the 37th president of the United States 
      (1969-74).  During his administration the United States withdrew 
      its military forces from Vietnam and informally recognized the 
      government of the People's Republic of China. The Watergate 
      scandal that occurred at the beginning of his second term brought 
      Nixon to the verge of impeachment by the House of Representatives 
      and led to his resignation, the first ever by a U. S. president.


      Born in Yorba Linda, Calif., on Jan. 9, 1913, Nixon was the 
      second of Hannah and Francis Nixon's five children, all of whom 
      were boys.  Despite the economic difficulties and emotional 
      tensions of the Nixon household, young Richard excelled in 
      school, graduating second in his class from Whittier College 
      (1934) and third in his class from Duke University law school 
      (1937).  From 1937 to 1942 he practiced law in Whittier, Calif. 
      When the United States entered World War II, he worked briefly 
      for the tire-rationing section of the Office of Price 
      Administration in Washington, D.C., and then served in the navy 
      as a supply officer in the South Pacific.

      Upon his return to Whittier after the war he entered politics, 
      becoming the Republican candidate for Congress in California's 
      12th district.  His first political campaign, in 1946, set the 
      tone for many that would follow.  Running against the liberal 
      Democratic incumbent, Jerry Voorhis, Nixon suggested that Voorhis 
      had dangerous left-wing tendencies.  Nixon won easily and 
      thereafter made anti-Communism one of his main political themes.

      As a new congressman he was assigned to the then relatively 
      unimportant House Committee on Un-American Activities.  He 
      quickly attained national prominence by playing a central role in 
      the committee's investigation of Alger HISS, a former high State 
      Department official accused of carrying on espionage for the USSR 
      during the 1930s.  Nixon was reelected to the House in 1948.  In 
      1950 he ran for the Senate, defeating the Democratic candidate, 
      Congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, against whom he leveled 
      charges not unlike those he had used to unseat Voorhis 4 years 
      earlier. When he entered the Senate, he was regarded as one of 
      the brightest young stars of the Republican party. His youth, his 
      oratorical skills, and his indefatigable speechmaking at 
      Republican fund-raising dinners around the country won him favor 
      among local party organizers.  In 1952, at the age of 39, he was 
      nominated by the party to be Dwight D. Eisenhower's 
      vice-presidential running mate.

      During the 1952 presidential campaign, Eisenhower adopted a 
      statesmanlike pose, whereas Nixon once again employed the 
      blistering anti-Communist language that had helped him gain 
      national prominence.  Midway in the campaign, however, he was 
      nearly dropped from the ticket.  Stories appeared in the press of 
      an $18,000 fund that had been raised for Nixon by California 
      businessmen.  Nixon defended himself in a nationwide radio and 
      television speech, denying that there was anything improper in 
      his use of the money.  His wife did not wear mink, he pointed 
      out, but only "a respectable Republican cloth coat." The only 
      gift that he had kept for himself was a cocker spaniel named 
      Checkers.  The "Checkers speech" brought an overwhelmingly 
      favorable response from Republicans across the nation. Eisenhower 
      kept him on the ticket, and the two were swept into office by a 
      margin of more than 6 million votes over the Democratic ticket 
      headed by Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois.

      As vice-president, Nixon was never personally very close to 
      Eisenhower, although he frequently represented the president at 
      home and abroad.  In 1955, when Eisenhower suffered a heart 
      attack, Nixon filled in effectively for him until the president 
      could resume his duties.  The Eisenhower-Nixon ticket was 
      reelected by another landslide in 1956.  In the next few years 
      Nixon traveled widely;  in one trip to the USSR in 1959 he opened 
      the American National Exhibition.  There, in a model kitchen, he 
      engaged in a debate with Nikita Khrushchev.  This widely 
      publicized "kitchen debate" enhanced Nixon's political stature.

      His yeoman service to the party made Nixon the logical Republican 
      choice to run for president in 1960.  Campaigning against the 
      Democratic nominee, John F. Kennedy, Nixon seemed to come off 
      second best in a series of television debates with his 
      lesser-known opponent.  He lost the election by a little more 
      than 100,000 votes.  Two years later, when he was defeated for 
      the governorship of California by the Democratic incumbent, 
      Edmund G. ("Pat") Brown, many observers thought Nixon's political 
      career had ended.  He himself told reporters the next day, "You 
      won't have Nixon to kick around anymore, because, gentlemen, this 
      is my last press conference."

      In the next few years he worked as a partner in a New York law 
      firm and traveled the country and the world.  The nomination and 
      overwhelming defeat of Sen. Barry Goldwater as the Republican 
      presidential candidate in 1964 encouraged Nixon to try again for 
      the presidency in 1968.  He obtained the nomination on the first 
      ballot after winning a series of presidential primaries.  This 
      time, partly because the Democratic party was bitterly divided 
      over the VIETNAM WAR, Nixon won the election, despite an 
      11th-hour surge by the Democratic nominee, Hubert H. Humphrey, 
      that narrowed Nixon's final margin to less than 1% of the popular 
      vote.


      In the White House, the contradictions in Nixon were most 
      obvious.  He could be bold, yet also cautious;  effective, yet 
      often inept.  Working closely with his national security advisor 
      (later, secretary of state), Henry Kissinger, he forsook the 
      anti-Communist policies that he had supported throughout most of 
      his career in favor of detente with the USSR and rapprochement 
      with the Communist government of China.  In 1969 he began the 
      Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) with the Soviet Union. In 
      February 1972 he made a historic trip to Peking--where he was 
      received by Mao Tse-tung--thus reversing the U.S. policy of not 
      recognizing the Communist government. In 1973, after 4 years of 
      waging war in Vietnam--including heavy bombing raids on North 
      Vietnam (1972) and the invasion (1970) of Cambodia--the 
      administration managed to arrange a cease-fire that would last 
      long enough to permit U.S. withdrawal from the Indochinese war 
      zone.  After the Arab-Israel War in 1973, the efforts of Henry 
      Kissinger led to a cease-fire and troop disengagement in the 
      Middle East.

      Domestically, under the banner of "A New Federalism," Nixon 
      attempted to shift important elements of governmental power and 
      responsibility back to state and local governments.  He cut back 
      and opposed federal welfare services, proposed antibusing 
      legislation, and used wage-and-price controls to fight 
      inflation.  A combination of domestic and international 
      developments, notably the quintupling of oil prices by the 
      Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 1973, led 
      to the economic recession of 1974-75.

      In 1972, Nixon swept to an overwhelming victory in the 
      presidential election against his Democratic challenger Sen. 
      George S. McGovern--but, ironically, the seeds of political 
      collapse had already been sown.  During the campaign, a group of 
      burglars working for the Committee to Re-elect the President 
      broke into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee 
      at the Watergate office-apartment complex in Washington, D.C., 
      apparently in search of political intelligence.  Attempts by the 
      White House to stop or frustrate the ensuing investigations 
      ultimately failed when Nixon's own White House tape recordings 
      revealed that the president and his assistants had engaged in an 
      obstruction of justice.

      In the meantime he had been forced to drop Vice-President Spiro 
      T. AGNEW, who resigned in October 1973 after he was charged with 
      corruption that began during his tenure as county executive of 
      Baltimore, Md.  As the revelations of wrongdoing piled up, Nixon 
      became preoccupied with preserving his presidency.  He jettisoned 
      top assistants in the White House and fired Special Prosecutor 
      Archibald COX.  After the Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, 
      required that he supply Cox's successor, Leon Jaworski, with tape 
      recordings of conversations with his advisors, the House 
      Judiciary Committee voted to recommend (July 27-30, 1974) 
      approval by the full House of three articles of impeachment 
      against the president.  On Aug. 9, 1974, Nixon resigned his 
      office and was succeeded by Vice-President Gerald R. FORD, whom 
      he had selected to replace Agnew. A month after Nixon's 
      resignation, Ford pardoned him for any crimes he might have 
      committed as president.  Nixon accepted the pardon but insisted 
      that his mistakes had been personal and political, not criminal.

      After retiring to San Clemente, Calif., Nixon moved to New York 
      City, then to Saddle River, N.J. In 1981 he joined former 
      presidents Ford and Carter as members of the official U.S. 
      delegation to the funeral of Egyptian president Anwar al-Sadat.

      Nixon's writings include three autobiographical works, Six Crises 
      (1962), RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon (1978), and In the Arena 
      (1990), and books on U. S. foreign policy--The Real War (1980), 
      Real Peace (1984), No More Vietnams (1985), 1999: Victory without 
      War (1988), and Seize the Moment: America's Challenge in a 
      One-Superpower World (1992).
