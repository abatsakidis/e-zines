how to change your grades using only a credit card and a toothpick

you say you got a D in Spanish? I'm sorry to hear that.. First, you go
to your teacher, with a Brand New American Express with no Spending
Limits, and a toothpick.. You slip him/her the card, and say `if you
give me an A, you can do whatever you want with the credit card'... if
they accept, you get an A, if not, take the toothpick and ram it into
their eyeball repeatedly, up to ten times if neccersary.. then tell
them, `now, give me the A, and this time, you don't get the credit
card'.. works everytime..

how to make a nuclear bomb by using a credit card and a toothpick

you say you got a D in spanish? you say you want to blow up your
teachers house? well, you can either use the method above, and change
the grade, or you take your credit card and your toothpick to that
nuclear bomb place in Arizona... you either a: card the nuclear bomb,
and before the government knows that its over your card limit, or that
you're actually some teenager with no nuclear experince, you have the
bomb, and your teachers house is gone.. or you b: walk up to a guard,
slip him the card and say `use this all you like, and give me a nuclear
bomb', if he gives you the bomb, yay, you have the bomb, teachers house
is gone.. if he says no, don't bother ramming the toothpick into his eye
because he'll just shoot you before you can say `nuclear bomb'..
