Beavis and Butt-Head


Scene: broadcast booth

     Larry: Welcome to American Gladiators! This week I'm
            joined by those pranksters of prime time, Beavis
            and Butt-head!  What do you think of tonight's
            matchup?

Butt-Head: I'm already up!

   Beavis: Yea, me too!

    Larry: Okay guys; tonight we have our oldest competitor
           ever, a Wes Lee from-

   Beavis: Private

    Larry: Parts Unknown; Beavis!

Butt-Head: Huh-huh, he said parts, huh-huh.

    Larry: Ah, Let's get underway.  Our first contest is the
           Assault. in this event, our gladiators try to
           hit our competitors with tennis ball shot from
           the cannon.  The competitors try to hit the
           the target with the various weapon in the time
           allotted.  And Wes is weaving back and forth,
           he's made it to the first station, he fires,

   Beavis: But he misses! what a loser!

Butt-Head: Why don't you try, I bet you couldn't do it!

   Beavis: Shut up or I'll kick your butt!

    Larry: Oh, and our competitor goes down on a hit to the
           inner thigh!

   Beavis: No way, dude! He got hit in the gnads!

Butt-Head: Ooohhh!

    Larry: You said it Butt-Head!  Beavis, what does Wes
           have to say?

              (cut to Beavis interviewing Wes)

   Beavis: Wes, you just got hit in the gnads, are you going
           to Sea World or something?

      Wes: I don't feel much like talking now.

                      (voice over)
Butt-head: What a wus!

   Beavis: Yeah, his name even sounds like `wus'

                       (On floor)

    Larry: Our next event is near and dear to my heart,
           powerball.  I'm here with our Gladiator,
           Lightningbug.  Lightningbug, you're a tough guy,
           you must love this event.

      Bug: Yea, I love getting out there and just hurting
           people.  There's no feeling like wrestling a
           sweaty guy to the ground

                              (voice over)

Butt-Head: Oh yea; how old are you, Wes?

      Wes: What? Hey, don't make me come up there!

   Beavis: Yea, Yea, he'll kick your butt!

    Larry: So what is your assignment today,
           Lighteningbug?

      Bug: My assignment is to kill everybody.

    Larry: So get out there and bust some heads!

                     (voice over)

Butt-Head: You said `head', huh-huh, huh-huh.

    Larry: So let's get this underway.  And Wes makes a move
           the right, but unfortuntley his head stays on
           the mat as Lightening bug simply annihilates him.
           that's got to hurt.

Butt-Head: Whoah, that was pretty cool! can we see that
           again in slow motion?

    Larry: Yes we can; let's go to the video tape.

   Beavis: His head like, did some cool stuff.  This
           would be really cool if like, he puked.

               (Wes Pukes with blood in it)

   Beavis: Aahh, aahh! what was that!

Butt-Head: You asked for it, Beavis.

   Beavis: Yea, but, that was disgusting!  That was beyond
           the realm of good taste.

    Larry: Our next event is the joust.  Our guest
           announcers Beavis and Butt-Head will demonstrate.

                       (cut to floor)

Butt-Head: Uh, when do we get to fight the chicks in tight
           shorts?

                        (voice over)

    Larry: In a minute, guys, just do your thing.

Butt-Head: Uh, okay.  Get ready Beavis, and don't make
           me stick this thing up your butt!

                (hits Beavis repeatedly)

   Beavis: Ahh, my liver, my liver!  Ahh my liver, my liver!

(voice over)

    Larry: Thanks, guys.  And now for the main event,
           Wes versus Lighteningbug!  This has turned
           into a real grudge match!  These guys look a lot
           alike in the face and the build.  In fact, if I
           didn't know better, I'd say they were father and
           son!  Let's go to our floor microphone.

      Bug: I'm gonna bust yo' gut and watch you die!

Butt-Head: That would be pretty cool!

      Wes: What's your problem?

      Bug: I'm your problem!
   Beavis: Yea, yea, people say "Beavis, Beavis, why don't
           talk about your problems", and I say "no, leave
           me alone, I'll work `em out by my self", and
           people say, "Beavis Beavis"

      Bug: And your worst nightmare!

Butt-Head: Shut up, Beavis, you're ruining it.

      Wes: Bring it on `roids!

      Bug: You sayin' I ain't all natural!

      Wes: Just that brain untouched by evolution!

      Bug: I'm gonna hurt you so bad your gonna wish I'd rip
           your spine out so's you escape the pain, because
           he who breaks the law goes back to the House of
           Pain!

   Beavis: Yea, yea, rip his spine out, and like, show it to
           him before he dies!

      Wes: All you need to know is that I'm in the house.

      Bug: The only house you should be talking about is the
           one for old age!

Butt-Head: Uh-huh, old people, uh-huh.

   Beavis: Are you like, gonna die soon?

      Wes: Yo Momma!

      Bug: Yo Momma said knock you out, I'm gonna knock you
           out!

Butt-head: Uh-huh he said, knock, uh-huh.

   (Wes and Lightningbug fight, Lightningbug kills Wes)

   Beavis: If life is cool, and death is the inverse of
           life, and the angle of the dangle is inversely
           proportional to the heat of the beat, therefore,
           because he's dead, he's not cool.

Butt-Head: Whoa, that was pretty cool!  You're pretty smart
           Beavis.

    Larry: But yet, in our sadness, we find joy.  Our
           Gladiator Lightningbug has an announcement.

      Bug: I'd like to invite my fellow gladiator,
           Pollyester out her
                      (enter stage left)

Butt-Head: Whoa, it's that chick from that geometry video!

   Beavis: No way dude, that video has squares.  Geometry is
           about triangles!

Butt-head: I meant advanced geometry.

      Bug: I am going to marry Polyester right here on the
           rings in Hang Time.  Larry, if you would do the
           honors?

Butt-Head: Hey, I can be the best man!

   Beavis: No way, dude, you should be the maid of on her

Butt-Head: Shut up, Beavis.

   Beavis: I mean, you look like a wus,

Butt-Head: I'll kick you ass like a wus if you don't shut
           shut up!

                    (party mounts rings)

   Larry: (runs through vows) if there are no objections,

(Beavis and Butt-Head fall of rings crying "aahh, aahh, and aough,
aough, respectively)

      Mom: No-

Butt-Head: Hey baby, wanna wrestle?

    Larry: I pronounce you man and wife.

      Mom: No! don't you see? You're mother and son!
           Polly, don't you remember that surrogate child
           you had?

    Polly: Oh no!

 Beavis & Butt-head: BUSTED!
