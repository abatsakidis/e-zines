                          andy's got a gun

   "Hah.  You fuckup.  You're failing pre algebra!  Get up you loser or
I'll kick you again!"

   Thats all Andy ever heard.  Day in and day out.  Freshmen can be mean
on each other.  Attacking, like vicious dogs. Andy knew one day things
would change.  Be it the day he got straight a's on his report card, or
the day he ran away, or even the day he killed them all.

   "Get up!  Get up fucking asshole," the older senior squealed, "you
want me to hit you again?"

   "No!  Please!  No!"

   "What? I didn't hear you.   I think I will have to hit you again.."

   "No!  Don't! Ahhh.."

   "Go away, pussy boy.  I'll pick up tommorows lunch money while I'm at
your house fucking your mom."

   "Haha, good one Frankie," the goon's friend chirps in.

   "Whatever, asshole," Andy mutters as he franticly runs away, trying
to escape the turment of another day.  Here it was, May, and he was
still getting his ass kicked every day. The teachers didn't care, and it
was a catholic school.  His mom didn't seem to care, either.  He
sometimes thought she was fucking his enemies.

   That night, Andy did his homework, which he normally never did.  He
thought to himself, "that fucking asshole Frank.  Tommorow, tommorow
he's mine."

   The next day, Andy woke up ten minutes earlier then he normally does.
He slipped into his tan Dockers, white shirt from Sears, and a plaid tie
from Bradlees, but also snuck into his parents room.

   His parents worked in the morning, so it wasn't a problem to get in.
He opened up the closet, and took out his dad's gun rack.  Did he want
the magnum, or go for the full effect, and take the shotgun?  Nah, the
magnum was the one. He could concel that in his backpack untill the time
was right.

   He walked into school, like he normally did.  Opened the door to the
chants of, "hey! pussy boy is here!" He opened his locker, took the
books out of his bag, and put them into the locker, but the gun remained
hidden.

   He let his classmates survive during first period, and second period.
But in the change of classes between second and third periods, he knew
that was the time.

   The bell rang, he went into the center of the hall with his bag, and
just stood there.

   "Andy, what the fuck are you doing? Asshole"

   "Get the fuck out of the way Andy!"

   "What are you, stupid?"

   "No, I'm not stupid.  I'm just mad.  I've had enough of your old
jokes.  It may have been funny in September. You've had your chuckles,
you've had your fun.  But on who's expense? Mine, mine, MINE
MOTHERFUCKERS!  Enough of this, now, its time for my fun, on your
expenses."

   "What the hell are you talking about loser?"

   "I'm talking about this, " Andy says, as he pulls the Magnum from the
bag.

   Students scream and run for cover, teachers lock the doors.

   "No one moves or you all die!  I mean it.   Hmm, Kelly. How ya doing
Kelly?"  Andy looks over to Kelly, one of the hottest girls in the
freshmen class.  "You have nice tits, did you know that?"

   She sobs, and tries to mutters a few barely audible words.

   "Hmm, I sure would like a look at those sweet tits.  Take off your
shirt, bitch.."

   "Umm..  Please, dont point the gun..."

   "Fuck you bitch, I didn't ask you for your fucking opinion.  Just
take off the fucking blouse bitch."

   She slowly starts to unbutton the white shirt.  Her mind goes blank.
The only things she can remember are the time she was in The Gap with
her friend Mandy, when they saw Brian, the cute senior.

   She also remembers the time she yelled at Andy because he was staring
at her chest during Algebra Class.  Now, he was going to get the view he
finally wanted.

   She managed to get the first button undone with a little fuss.  The
second button started to show some of her bra, and then the third and
forth buttons were undone.

   "Mmm.  Just like I imagined.  Nice, round, and erect.  I think I want
to fuck you right now, Kelly.."

   "No, please, I'm still a virgin.."

   "You? A virgin? I thought you were a ho? Well, thats what Ron said.
He said he fucked you so hard, so fast, and that you were pretty easy."

   "No.. He lied.  Please.."

   There were dozens of other kids looking on.  But they were frozen in
time.  Thoughts running through their minds at a million miles an hour.
They couldn't do anything.  He was right.  They had their fun at his
expense, and now he was having his fun, as grotesque as they may be.

   They couldn't do anything, but what Andy, Kelly, and the rest of the
hallway didn't know, was that the Principal had called the police.
During this whole ordeal, the Shore County SWAT Team was surrounding the
school, and was about the make their move.

   The first team broke through the windows, and made a do or die rush
toward him.  He didn't see them at first, and didnt see them for a few
moments.

   When he finally did, he ran.  But not without looking at Kelly, and
saying, "you're so pretty, you dont know how many lonely nights you have
helped me..  for that, i thank you.."

   He turned, and ran towards the stairs.  With a Swat Team in close
pursuit, he reached the third floor.  He turned and broke the window at
the end of the hallway.

   Beyond the window, was a ledge.  Flowers, all in a pretty row.  He
stood at the edge, and looked below.  Straight down, thirty feet.  The
Swat Team stopped.  They looked at him, without knowing what to do.  If
they rushed, they would lose him.  But it looked to be a no win battle.

   Below, on the softball field, a crowd gathered.  Kelly, Frank, and
others, standing there looking on.  Remorse for their actions suddenly
came into mind.  They knew it was too late.

   All the times Frank had kicked him, and beat him, and robbed him.
All the times Kelly had turned him down for a date, and all the times
she scolded him for looking at her in such a way.  They both regretted
it now.

   Looking down, down thirty feet, down into a deep dark oblivion.  The
students gathered below, trying to make up for all the harsh things they
had done in his past, they tried to make it up for it now, but it was
futile.

   He looked over, and peered into the darkness. It was dark, but it was
still light.  It was only around eleven in the morning or so, but the
last half hour went by like it was a day.

   He decided it was the end, and took out a note which he had written
ealier.  He took it out, laid it next to the yellow geranium, turned
around, nodded in silence to the Swat Team, and then looked down to the
crowd below.  He looked at them, and pointed at the note.

   After this little show, he shouted out, "the world is my enemy, i
shall end this war now."  Faced the softball field, pointed the gun at
his chest, jumped, and pulled the trigger..

   The note didn't say much.  It just said that the world really didn't
need him, and that people like Kelly, Frank, and the others in the
school, would be much better off without him.

   A memorial lays in honor to a fallen student.  One who may not be
remembered by the future classes, the geraniums may overgrow and the
memories may be forgotten, but the one student, on the verge of
flipping, will remain in every class..
