                          A Tale of Addiction

      Howard had heard all the horror stories, all the sad tales of lives
   ruined, and still he hadn't beleived that he had become a victim of
   an illness that ruined millions of lives every day and a trail; of
   pain in it's wake.  The people around him, his loved ones and friends
   had seen the changes in him almost immediately, but like him they
   thought he had the strength of will to keep the beast under control.
   Looking back, Howard now realized that the beast had him under its
   power from the beginning, and he was powerless to undo the damage it
   had wreaked upon his soul.
      
      With the hunger gnawing within him, Howard reflected back to the
   day when he had first encountered this life destroying thing that now
   ripped away his control and left him always thirsting for more.  He
   had been in his son's room helping his wife put away the laundry,
   when he found it under his son's clean socks.  He had been furious,
   he'd seen the commercials on television, the ones where people got up
   and confessed to being hooked, people with glazed looks of ecstasy on
   their faces which belied the fact that they had given up their
   freedom of choice for something they claimed was fun.  With 20/20
   hindsight Howard knew that the signs had been there that his boy had
   been in trouble with something he couldn't handle. He and his friends
   would rush home after school and lock themselves in Howie Jr's room
   for hours on end, and when they finally came out, they would have that
   empty-minded vacant smile pasted to their faces and utter strange
   noises that didn't make any real sense at all.  But Howard had been
   too busy with work, and Howie had always been a responsible boy, and
   aside from his odd after school behavior, he really didn't cause any
   trouble, in fact, just lately his schoolwork was showing a very
   definite improvement over previous years.
      
      Now gazing sadly down into his son's sock drawer, Howard realizied
   that the thing that every parent feared the most had happened to his
   son, he had become HOOKED ON PHONICS.  Although Howard went into
   immediate action to try to help his son break the addiction, taking
   him to the best doctors, putting him into the best rehabilitative
   facilities, even getting his bus assignment changed so he would ride
   the really short bus to school, on which he knew there would be no
   Phonics pushers or addicts to put any further peer pressure on Howie
   to use just to be part of the group.  But sadly all of his efforts
   were in vain, his son never really came back from the terrible mind
   altering effects of Phonics.  Phonics brought his son to his untimely
   death, and left Howard needing an escape, a way out to deal with the
   pain of losing his son.  Howie had been crossing the street on the
   way to his bus stop, when in the middle of the street he had a
   Phonics flashback.  He was still trying to sound out the license
   plate of the eighteen wheeler when it struck him dead in the middle
   of the street and kept on going.  Ominously the truck was on it's way
   to Howies school to drop off the latest edition of Phonics Books.
      
      That's when Howard made the mistake of ever even opening his late
   son's Phonics book.  He had only wanted to understand what had
   enslaved his son, wanted to know what had taken all control away from
   his son who had always been so sensible and obedient.  Now he found
   that he understood completely, the monkey had climbed from his son's
   back and onto his own.  At first Phonics made him feel good, he could
   pronounce words that had previously eluded him, and his diction and
   vocabulary grew better and larger as a result.  After reading a few
   lessons however, Howard found it difficult to stop, he began to
   pronounce sounds that had no meaning, any combination of letters was
   a personal challange he could not back away from trying to produce
   verbally.  Combinations that were not humanly pronouncable were the
   worst, for although he knew intelectually that he could not do it he
   absolutely had to try anyway, often times straining his vocal for
   hours long after his throat would begin to bleed.
      
      Howard couldn't even remember when his life went completely out
   of his own control.  He had been devastated over the loss of his son,
   but had still managed to carry on for a while.  After he had started
   using Phonics however, he began to stay up too late doing the very
   things his son had done, singing the damnable song from that God
   awful commercial, the one that didn't have any words, only letters of
   the alphabet, going through medical books just to see if he could
   pronounce all the medical terms, which were mostly Latin, a language
   that has been dead for centuries and the average person would never
   use in their lifetime. It became such a problem, that he couldn't get
   up for work in the morning and couldn't go to bed at night, Howard
   began skipping meals, eating only when his wife gave him Alphabits
   for breakfast, or alphabet soup for lunch or dinner.
      
      Slowly, people began to drift away from him, his friends stopped
   calling to see how he was, mostly because they couldn't understand
   any of the strange noises he uttered over the phone, his boss, tired
   of covering for him, finally gave him a pink slip after he hadn't
   shown up for work in three weeks, his wife moved back in with her
   parents, and the bank forclosed the loan on his home after being
   unable to cash any of his morgage payments because the checks he
   wrote out were written out Phoneticly, which if sounded out would be
   alright, but written down, the words on the amount line were
   gibberish.

      Now Howard lives on the street, a solitary lonely life that makes
   him dependant on the kindness of others just to survive.  Howard
   lives day by day begging change from strangers to support his
   alphabet soup habit, speaking gibberish to himself that no one but
   himself can understand, and trying to remember what it was like to be
   clean and free of Phonics.  You may have seen Howard on a city street
   and assumed that he was just a poor crazy homeless person, or an
   alcoholic or drug addict that had let their desire for a good time
   ruin their lives, but Howard never had a chance, once he picked up
   the Phonics, like so many other victims, he could never let go and
   his life was ruined.  If Howard could still speak coherently, he
   would beseach you, Stay away from Phonics, Don't pick it up and don't
   ever use it, You could get Hooked. *

        Phonics Users And Abusers.
