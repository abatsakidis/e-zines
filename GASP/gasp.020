urg.  well, first off, i know i really haven't been in the scene as long
as most people.  hmm.  just counting, i've offically been in the `scene'
for 7 or 8 months now, even in this short time, i've seen a major
change.

there's a few things i'd like to say.  i know i might piss off alot of
people, but i don't care.  this is what i want to say, and if you don't
like it, write up your own text phile and release it.  its your choice
to read this, if you don't want to read it, hit control-c, alt-q, or
whatever, and stop reading this.  its your choice, freewill, i didn't
force you to read it, hence, you can't get too pissed off at me now.

this will be seperated into three parts for your enjoyment.
I) groups.
II) talk.
III) literature.
IV) misc stuff.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

part I - groups.
firstly.  if i see someone start another art group, i mean,
standard-wise art group (ie: normal ansi/lit/vga/etc group).  i'll shoot
someone.  i haven't seen a group formed within the last four months that
will do good.  its no use, there's a thing called supply and demand.
here's a little scenario.

 - in a tightknit community, there are five ansi artists, two are `top
   notch'.  group A is formed, and all five artists to to group A.
 - group B is formed by a sucky member of group A who wants power, and
   takes the other two sucky members from group A.
 - people who run boards want good ansis.
 - people who run boards want good ansis from group A.
 - people who run boards know that group B sucks.
 - group B dies because it has no support and a member leaves to go to
   group A.
   (OR)
 - group B is merged into group A, thus, dies.

see? how simple is that.  people DEMAND good, or at least, decent
quality ansis.  the "art scene" only SUPPLIES a small amount of good
artists.  the more groups, the more people are brought into the scene,
weeding out the quality of the ansis and making the scene "lame".

supply and demand.  pick up a high school economics text book.  read
about it, or get a history book and learn the results of BAD supply and
HIGH demand.

also.  leadership is something that is slow in coming.  people are
starting art groups with little experience, or bad experience.  here's
two examples.  (this is bound to piss off more people).

bad experience:
spastic studios.
eerie, in my opinion, isn't a good leader.  what, 5 groups in the last 4
months? undergrown is the only thing that he has been semi good in, but
that has its downpoints (see below).  the first pack had too much hype,
and it wasn't impressive at all.  also, narcolept ripping ansis, or
whatever he did, well, isn't good after only 1 month.  i give this group
no more then 3 packs before eerie leaves, or the group dies.  hey, lord
jazz left bleach after only one pack, and i applaud him and maestro for
going solo.

little experience
broken productions
well.  this one is bound to hit and hurt alot of people.  broken was
based in 908, gasp is based in 908.  the master, well, in my opinion,
didn't have enough experience in the "art scene."  dreldragon wasn't
around much, and at least tm had some sense in getting grey hawk to do
some work for the group (as far as leadership goes).  the master was
stuburn, his board didn't make an impressive world head quarters (in
these days of the "scene", thats all alot of groups have (whq)).  he
didnt do much for the group either.  so, thats why this is a classic
example of little experience.  the group did very well, it merged with
cia, and although grey hawk and i are painted as bad guys for the merge,
it has been good for cia, broken, and vor (who all merged at the same
time).  alot of people start groups for the affil.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

part II - talk.

i've been on boards for over a year now.  i've seen alot of "fads" come
and go.  all of them have pissed me off, to an extent, but none to the
extent of the current "fad".

letsee.

first, you had the `elite talk of last year', iE CaPiTaLiZaTioN oF
CoNSTaNaNTS aND LoWeRCaSe VoWeLS.  it was kinda cool.  but it got lame,
when people would write entire messages in this.  i read messages.  i
write messages.  you get a headache when you read messages like that.

(although, along with this, you had/have (in some cases) the replacement
of 0's with O's and 1's with i's, i only use it in bbs ads (ie -
aneurysm 1.9O8.27O.8i98 (nup:vortex) plug cheap plug :)) i don't see
anything wrong with THAT.)

next, somewhere after it, you had the phase of just tYPING lIKE tHIS aND
bEING pHUNKY cOOL g (more on this to come).  variations of this included
tYPiNG liKE tHiS, tYP1NG l1K3 t41S, etc.  see above.  reading messages
in this are ANNOYING.

the "current" fad that i hate the most is all of this `nigger' talk.  i
am not prejudice in any way.  i myself am white.  i am irish (yes, red
hair and all).  but i see people calling each other `niggers', `muh
nigger bro', `my nigger homie', etc.  most of this is due to #ansi.  if
i were black, i'd slap all of you.  i know there are people who are
black in "the scene", but i doubt all of you (all of you who talk like
that) are black.  i know for a fact that alot of white people talk like
that.

its just a shame because, well, this is america.  in the 60's we passed
a thing called the cival liberties law, and in a way, you yourself are
putting down black people by calling them `niggers'.  i have alot of
black friends, and know for a fact, that if you called them a nigger,
you'd be slapped.

also.  this is taken too far in alot of places.  read a e:mag, ie:
undergrown.  in the latest issue (#7), there is a section entitled, "IRC
Quotes (Various Niggas!)".  urg.

and also.  bitches.  i use the word myself from time to time, but i was
raised to watch what i say, and "bitches" or "niggers" are two words
that shouldn't be said too much.  and again, bitches is a word that is
said too much.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

part III - literature

lit <-> art.  literature has been around forever, and yes, it is art.
it is the most beuatiful form of art, only because it revels the inner
self of the writer.  literature requires a certain level of maturity to
read and understand it, and those people that say "lit sucks, lit isn't
art" are the same 13 year old ego maniacs that call themselves
"niggers".  if you can't undertsand lit, tough.  go to school.  read a
book.  get educated.  learn something and get off the computer once in
awhile.

literature can make you laugh, it can make you cry.  it can make you see
yourself and others in a whole new light.  it can teach you alot about
life, the world, or anything you wanted to know.  it is not just 13 year
old drivel.  if you read it over two or three times, you can learn alot.
try it once in awhile.  get off your bitch slapping, nigger chasing, ego
tripping, power trips.  read.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

part IV - misc stuff.

if you start a board, take a look at the boards around you first.  if
you're in the local calling area of harvest moon, don't open up a strict
art board.  that is, if you want to do well.  look at my area code for
example (908).  here we have eternal insanity, which is one of the best
obv/2 setups ever, and also the blade whq.  the north star, one of the
best rg setups and cia ehq.  and also prayer, chromatik (of blade)'s
board.  nuff said.  i run an text/art board, with some elite.  i do
fairly well within te local crowd.  use that for an example, be
original.  (anyone in 908 that runs a board not mentioned above, take
that advice).

well.  i gotta cut this short.  there's other stuff that i want to say,
but i don't have the time to say it.  its 10:35pm right now.  the storm
that hit my area tonight (new jersey) wasn't as great as i thought, and
thus, i have school tommorow.  so.  good byte, i hope you enjoyed this.
or at east, i hope it opened your eyes.  ta ta.
