SONG: HELLO, I LOVE YOU

Hello, I love you
I want you down on your knees.
Hello, I love you
Let me jump in your game
Hello, I love you
I want you down on your knees.
Hello, I love you
Let me jump in your game

She's bends right over in front of me,
Her perfect little ass looking back at me.
Do you think I'll be the guy
To make this virgin moan and sigh?

Hello, I love you
I want you down on your knees.
Hello, I love you
Let me jump in your game
Hello, I love you
I want you down on yours knees.
Hello, I love you
Let me jump in your game

She holds my head so high
Like a bird in the sky
Her tits are wicked, and her legs are long
When she sucks my brain screams out this song

She crouches at my feet
Like a dog that begs for more juicy meat
Do you hope to make her scream, you fool?
Do you hope to pop this christened jewel?

Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello
I want you
Hello
I need my baby
Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello
