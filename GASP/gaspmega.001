                    "skills, pills and chock full of thrills"

  oh yeah baby!  back in black and better than ever!  we're here to smack
  some sense into your pop and bend your mother over our knees and give
  her a good spanking!  sure it's been a while since issue 60 (yeah,
  it's been way way way over a year or so) but i don't give a shit!  its
  even been a little while since gasp volume 2... AND I STILL DON'T CARE!

  you can parody us, you can even be reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeel
  cool and edit our t-file to your hearts content and then send it out
  via the internet as your millionth zine!  WOULDN'T THAT BE FUNNY?!

  yeah, fucking hilarious.

  we are the people your parents forgot to warn you about.  "stay away
  from stupid t-files!" should have been the first thing they tought
  you... but i guess it's too late for that.  you've been sucked in,
  congradulations... welcome to hell.

  welcome to gasp the MEGA'ZINE (tm, c, pat. pending).

                           oh dog, beautiful dog!
                           by pip the angry youth

  i saw her today... my one true love... she was wondering through the
  park where locust and 25th street meet... so beautiful... so
  stunning... so canine... so seductive...

  so furry.

  i walked up to her companion, a young woman of around 21 carrying
  around a portfolio and a small backpack... probably an art student or
  something... but it wasn't her i was concerned with, oh no... i wanted
  to get to know her companion... thing is i just can't walk up to her
  and say "hey, can i fuck your dog?"... oh no... that wouldn't do... i
  had to use the laid back approach...

  "hi."

  "hi.", she retorted.

  "nice dog you have there, what's its name?"

  "caitlin."

  this was going nowhere fast.  at least i got the dog's name out of
  her... why is she being so stand offish?  why did she have to be in
  the way of a man and his one true love?  what the hell am i going to
  do now?!?

  "why that's a beautiful name for such a beautiful dog.", i said as i
  bent down to scratch the seductive caitlin behind her ears.  she
  seemed to like me quite a bit and then started licking my face.

  "she seems to like you!", the woman laughed.  surely she had to know
  by now that i wasn't interested in seducing her.  hopefully she
  thought i was only trying to be friendly to her.  maybe my plan was
  working better than i had expected.  maybe for once i could score.

  after more conversation than i'm used to i learned her name was lisa
  and finally convinced her to let me come back with her to their
  apartment.  we finally made it up to a small apartment near 18th and
  sansom.  it was a cozy little three bedroom apartment on the third
  floor.  from her window you could see down an alleyway, not much of a
  view but this is philly afterall.  town of asphalt views and...

  i was inturrupted in mid thought by the dog sniffing at my crotch.  i
  didn't know how to react at first.  lisa was in her bedroom changing
  out of her sweatpants and into a pair of pants.  what should i do?
  pet its head?  push it away?

  unzip my pants?

  [ OK!  this is getting a little out of hand, don't you think? ]
  [ perverts, sex, zippers and 18th street... someone's got to  ]
  [ put an end to this...                                       ]

 and now let us read from the holy book of tropical fruit flavors (tm)...

 book of tripe the false prophet, chapter 34 verses 21-27

 and unto the people of gasp it was said that there will be a great savior
 and unto thee it has been said that the great one shall rise once more
 and preach unto thee and the members of gasp
 and he shall come from the holy land of Zion and bring salvation to us all
 and his name shall be called pip the angry youth
 and it will be good.
 amen
