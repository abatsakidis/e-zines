           Well, here it is. Issue #8. Sorry it took so long to release.
           But we've been slacking off a bit. I've been busy with work and
           what not. But we finally got around to releasing this puppy.
           So, I hope everyone enjoys!

           I really should say something a bit more meaningful here. But
           after a 12 hour work day, I'm really not that creative. So suck
           it up til the next issue.

           We are always looking for articles, read the conclusion text
           for more info.

           Thanks! Hope you enjoy #8.

OPEN YOUR MIND, WE'RE GOING IN

JUNK MAIL IS BAD!

- Wastes your time reading through it.
- Wastes bandwidth receiving it.
- Wastes your time trying to unsubscribe from it.
- Wastes your mind because you're not sure that if unsubscribing makes them send
  you more because they think you're an active e-mail address.
- Wastes disk space.
- Wastes contiguous disk space when it gets deleted.
- Wastes time deleting it.
- Wastes your mouse pad.
- Wastes a small part of life from your mouse, keyboard and CPU fan.
- Wastes system administrators' time when you try to black list the spammers.
- Wastes more bandwidth that could have been used for Q3 or CS.
- Wastes your body energy and oxygen.
- Wastes the poor person's e-mail account found in the "reply to" address.
- Wastes all of the above for that person.

JUNK MAIL IS GOOD! (huh?)

- You know your e-mail account still works.

The Evils of Tradition
----------------------
by: kleptic <outbreak@fwaggle.net>


All around me I see people doing what people always have done, are doing, and
will do. They are born, go to school, grow up, get a job, work, get old, and 
die. Most of those people will never do anything within their life span that 
has not already been done. 

That scares me. I believe each life is precious, and that everyone has 
something to offer the world that no other person could ever or will ever 
be able to duplicate. My life goal is to push my abilities far enough that 
I hopefully achieve whatever my unique potential contribution may be, 
preferably before I'm dead. 

The problem, as I see it, is that we live and die by tradition. As our 
forefathers have done, we shall do. Why are we doing that? It's tradition. 
If that's the only thing stopping us from creating our own approaches to a 
situation, I think we need to reevaluate our priorities. At some point, those
traditions were created. The people who created them, who did them first, 
obviously did not consider what had been done before. They were creating 
something new. Do you think the authors of tradition really intended to limit 
the later generations creative thinking so severely with their creations? 
Unlikely. I find it far more feasible they would hope we could learn from their 
innovation, learn to create our own rituals and methods. 

I urge all of you to take a step away from the shackles of tradition. Nothing 
should be done solely for the sake of tradition. Ideally, we would just forget 
tradition and treat each new problem as a new entity, using our knowledge and 
creativity to invent our own solutions, but if tradition must be considered it
would be far better to not do something a tradition dictates, or even intentionally
doing the opposite. 

I try to do one thing a day that no one has likely ever done before. It seems 
a daunting task, but the effort is definitely not wasted. Nothing makes you 
feel special like being the first person in history to do something. I suppose 
I can share with you my own personal method for marking my place in history on 
a daily basis, even though it does slightly lower my chances of true innovation 
each day. I use the concept of 128 bit data encryption to invent new words. 
The basic idea is this: if you combine 128 random syllables into a combination, 
odds are with you no one will put the same combination together. Therefore, you 
most likely will end up with a word that no one else in history has ever said, 
or will ever say. Feels good, doesn't it? The only other step is to give the 
word some meaning, so it can be used in a sentence. I like to use unique and 
specific emotions, such as the following example: 

icharuyijbmartycraraquerdecaxroonxarmattyfattypart - noun - the feeling you 
get when Richard Simmons and B.B. King catch you sucking on your toes while 
wearing a Gucci suit and wielding a potato gun. 

I really doubt anyone has ever used that word, expressed that emotion, or even 
had the experience that would trigger that emotion. I have rendered the future 
a little more prepared; if Richard Simmons and B.B. King ever do catch someone 
sucking on their toes while wearing a Gucci suit and wielding a potato gun, 
they'll be able to say, "Whoa there, fellas. It's not what it looks like. 
Boy, do I feel icharuyijbmartycraraquerdecaxroonxarmattyfattypart." By the way, 
there's not 128 syllables in my example word, but you get the idea. 

Anyway, I hope some of you find it important to leave your permanent mark on 
this little tribe called humanity, without letting it leave it's mark on you 
too deeply. We're all born unique, but we grow into mediocrity. Be weird, be 
crazy. This world would be a lot more fun with a bunch of free thinkers 
running around, wouldn't it?

When The Circle Breaks
by:Turbanator

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Its funny how things can go from what you think to be normal, to completely
flipped around.  This is a poem, that shows alot of my emotion towards a 
recent event, and of things to come.



Things happen, friends change and move on, people go off and form other 
groups, even though long ago they promised not to break away.

Ones who were not originally close, are now closer than ever, and things 
that were, will never be the same.

The seasons also change, but the difference is that eventually, things 
return to normal.

Promises are broken.

Nations are separated by war, but peace talks are in place, so the nations 
are close once again.

Things change.

Now there are ones that come from the shadows, that are now in the light 
with you.

Things change.

And the circle breaks.

Two lovers are divided by lack of communication, braught on by the petty 
differences they share.

Emotions break, and slowly fade away.  Like suger, dissolving in hot tea.

Things change.

And the circle breaks.

Here upon lies a random collection of quotes, mumblings and thoughts from my
mind, enjoy.


Does the Spanish dude need a creator?, and if so who created him?

If you go back in time are you there? And if you are could you control
yourself or are there two uncontrolled versions of you? If you appear
conscious as your future self do you replace your past self? Where does your
past self go? Where do you go if you cannot control either the one or two of
yourself and, do you know when you get to where you go?

If there is only one unified theory it is just a set of rules and
inflations on which we base reality - Stephen Hawking

We have more to fear from those that think they understand us than those
who know they don't - Martin Luther King Jnr.

America are calling these Taliban fighters 'unlawful combatants' because
they are fighting without declaring war and are therefore not prisoners of
war and therefore do not have to be treated according to the Geneva
Convention. However when America fought in Vietnam they hadn't declared war
either. America claimed that it had sent 'military advisors' however these
'military advisors' were incidentally US army troops, dressed in US army
uniform and armed by the US army. Technically, these soldiers were also
unlawful combatants but campaigned for the release of many 'prisoners of
war' during the Vietnam war which they claimed the Vietnamese had captured
and were treating without accordance to the current laws on 'prisoners of
war'. These soldiers were released and hailed as heroes by the American
people yet they feel it justified to keep several Taliban soldiers locked in
cages that even animal rights people would not let animals stay in. There
has to be a change in the bureaucracy and red tape that dominate politics
today. Even the simplest task requires months of planning and countless
meetings. Governments are too afraid to do what they know is right for fear
of offending people and loosing power.

If there is an infinite number of parallel universes there is an identical
one of me, writing this, right now, but one thing is different in their
world maybe but they may not even be aware of this so, to them, at least,
this is an identical world. But will they also be thinking this? This also
leads to the possibility that are countless millions of me, doing this, an
infinite number. A microscopic dot on a microscopic dot.

                                      **********

Solipsism - Your mind is the only thing that exists and therefore
everything else is a product of your imagination.

Scepticism - There may or may not be an external world, and if there is it
may or may not be completely different from how it seems to you - there's no
way for you to tell.

How do you know that you didn't just come into existence a few minutes ago,
complete with all your present memories? You would be assuming the reality
of the past to prove the reality of the past.
What is the basis of your idea that everything has to have an explanation?
It's true that in your normal, non-philosophical conception of the world,
processes like those which go in your mind are caused, at least in part, by
other things outside them.

Science is just as vulnerable as suggestion.

How can we know that the world outside our minds corresponds to our ideas
of what would be a good theoretical explanation of our observations?

Can we establish the reality of our sense experiences in relation to the
external world?

Is the idea of external reality that no one could ever discover
meaningless?

A dream has to be something that you can wake up from in order to discover
that you were asleep. But, if you never knew you were asleep in the first
place does the dream become your reality and if so what becomes of the
reality where you are asleep? Is it possible to be in two realities at once
but only to be aware of one? Can the state of two realities actually exist?
If so, is it feasible to be able to experience both realities with knowledge
of the other?

If the world was made by your mind, and this may be so because you only
know that you have a mind, think about the objects and people that inhabit
your world. If you did create them, why? Does everyone serve a purpose?

If you have never been to a specific place in our reality yet you are told
it exists, does it? Just how far can pictures on the television or words on
a page go to prove the existence of a place or object if you have never seen
it yourself?  Do things that you haven't experienced actually exist? Is the
fact that exist to others irrelevant?

If you believe that your mind is the only one in the world is it not
entirely acceptable to wonder if it is not a little improbable that the
whole world was created as a product of your mind? If the world is created
by you, is it already formed or do parts of it form as you travel to them?
If the last case is true then it is therefore possible to escape your world
by 'thinking' your way out of it. Is that surely not a logical
impossibility?

It is said that solipsism is a very lonely viewpoint because no other human
would actually exist, just images / representations of them. However, to say
this is somewhat of a contradiction. This is because there may be no
physical humans for you to interact with but there are an infinite number of
images / representations for you to interact with. They may not be real but
if you don't know your mind was the only one you would think of them as
normal humans and more importantly wouldn't question their reality or
otherwise. Is ignorance really bliss?

I wonder if any of you even got to here. Oh well. Until next time...

GPC wishes you well.

Backdoored By A Loved One.
By joja.

The word "suppository" strikes fear in the hearts of children across the world.
For those of you who have never had the pleasure of getting a suppository brually
shoved into your asshole, consider yourself extremely lucky. The suppository is one
of those most evil medicines ever invented, and one of the most uncomfortable.
I personally have experienced the wrath of the butt bullet, and trust me, it's
anything but fun. Not only does the suppository cause physical pain, but I know
for me, it caused mental as well.

Now, there are two ways a suppository can find its way into your ass, and I have named
these methods. The first method is called "The Sneaky Finger." The Sneaky Finger is
usually what parents do to get a suppository into your body while you're not expecting it.
This is the most evil method, and should be illegalized. I've fallen for The Sneaky
Finger many a time in my childhood, and I am scarred for life. Here is an example of
The Sneaky Finger in action.

Usually I'd be laying in bed in my pajamas, and my mom would come into the room.
She'd sit next to me and feel my head for a fever and give the "Sad Parent Face."
She would tell me to roll over on my stomach to see if there was a rash or something
on my back, and I would. Now this is where it goes from P3-13 to NC-17 in seconds.
She would pull my pants down and shove the suppository in my ass with lightning
speed. She had it down to a fucking science. Normally if I felt my pants going down,
I knew what was about to happen, and I would squirm. But she was a fucking professional,
and she always got me.

The second method is called "The Whole Shot." Now, The Whole Shot is somewhat better
than The Sneaky Finger because you're doing it yourself. So at least you're expecting
this one. Although, I would never want to put myself through this. I am fortunate
enough to be able to say that I have never experienced The Whole Shot, but I'm deeply
sorry for those who have. Even if I absolutely had to perform The Whole Shot, I
probably could never go through with it. There is no way you could get me to willingly
shove something into my ass. Overall, both The Sneaky Finger and The Whole Shot have
their up's and downs... Mostly downs.

There are two types of suppositories, the rectal suppository and the vaginal suppository.
Both can be used for different reasons. I believe the most common use for rectal
suppositories is for constipation. Other rectal supposotories can be used to releave
hemorrhoidal symptoms, and I even found one that is supposed to give you energy.
Sorry, but if I need energy, I'm going to eat a fucking powerbar or drink some
coffee. Why would someone use a suppository for energy? Furthermore, why would someone
use a rectal suppository to soothe the internal swelling, burning, itching and just
general discomfort of hemorrhoids?

Look, if you're constipated use a laxitive in a pill or liquid form that can be taken
ORALLY. If you're suffering from hemorrhoids use the cream for fucks sake! And last but
not least, if you need energy snort a line of cocaine or drink coffee, anything but
the buttbomb.

Now, vaginal suppositories can used for infertility, fungal and yeast infections, and
even a contraceptive. Personally I don't want to get into the vaginal suppositories,
so I'm going to make it short. If you're having infertility problems stop trying to
have kids, it's that simple. If you have a fungal or yeast infection use the cream!
Cream is always a better alternative, although it may not be as effective, it's
nice not to have to use the beaver cleaver, you know? As far as contraceptives go,
FOAM, DIAPHRAGM, THE PILL, I could go on and on. You choose.

I have compiled a list of different names for both vaginal and rectal suppositories.

Rectal:
Two-inch torpedo.
Butt bomb.
Butt bullet.
Rectum rocket.
Mangina mine.
Ass missle.

Vaginal:
Beaver cleaver.
Muff missle.
Twat torpedo.
Snatch spike.
Cooter Claymore.


I lost pretty much all motivation to type anymore about suppositories, so I think
I'm going to end it here. Although, If you are interested in using a suppository,
for some sick and twisted reason, at least do it the right way. Or you could always give my mom a call.
Here are the 12 easy steps to "install" your rectal suppository taken from The Michigan
Pharmacists Association's Patient Education Program. I got a kick out of it.

1.   Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.
2.   If the suppository is soft, hold it under cool water to harden it before removing the wrapper.
3.   Remove the wrapper, if present.
4.   If you were told to use half of the suppository, cut it lengthwise with a clean, single-edge
     razor blade.
5.   Put on a finger cot or disposable glove, if desired (available at a pharmacy).
6.   Lubricate the suppository tip with a water-soluble lubricant such as K-Y Jelly, not petroleum jelly
     (Vaseline). If you do not have this lubricant, moisten your rectal area with cool tap water.
7.   Lie on your side with your lower leg straightened out and your upper leg bent forward
     toward your stomach.
8.   Lift upper buttock to expose the rectal area. 
9.   Insert the suppository; pointed end first, with your finger until it passes the muscular
     sphincter of the rectum, about 1/2 to 1 inch in infants and 1 inch in adults.
     If not inserted past this sphincter, the suppository may pop out. (See below)
10.  Hold buttocks together for a few seconds.
11.  Remain lying down for about 15 minutes to avoid having the suppository come out.
12.  Discard used materials and wash your hands thoroughly.

Have fun.

* This letter is in reply to EvilRyan's article in Outbreak #3 
"Disproving Evolution." Thanks to Troy from speaking his side.



	I was reading your article in outbreak and I found it so absurd I 
simply had to correct you. I know you will probably ignore every word I say 
but I would be a hypocrite not to send it in the first place. Creationism 
only survives by ignoring all evidence to the contrary so for you to make 
such an ignorant an ill formed claim against legitimate science is 
laughable. calling evolution a theory was a correct assumption but I fear 
you meant it in the casual as apposed to the scientific usage of the word, 
which in  fact means a proven and generally accepted concept.     Your next 
claim is that evolution makes many unfounded claims, this is absurd, crack 
open a legitimate scientific journal or go to a museum, its all there ready 
for review, meanwhile creationism provides no legitimate evidence,check the 
bibliography of on e of the creationist books, they reference mostly 
woefully out of date information, generally dating 30 to even several 
hundred years old. They often quote legitimate sounding, but completely 
absurd publications, such as the Uks science magazine, which is ruf fly the 
equivalent of the inquirer, indeed gish is well known for once referencing 
the weekly world news. By the way gish is also well known for admitting 
 something as false then reusing it again in other debates.     As far as 
observed instances of speciation perhaps you should wander over to the 
talkorigins website, amongst its archives there is a list of observed 
instances of speciation in everything from insects to single celled 
organisms. a perfect example is the London subway mosquito, after the 
London subways were built a local species of mosquito took advantage of the 
new resource, now its well adapted to its man-made environment and is 
 sterile with its parent species. as far as your tree statements its a 
little ab surd, the organisms which made up the first life simply are not 
likely to be preserved, we can only know them by experimenting with various 
abiogenic compounds and see if they fit the geological and biological 
records, the "branches" are only incomplete becau se not all life is 
preserved, so again we can only deduce them by studying other evidences.     
your third paragraph is barely understandable, but I would take point with 
your claim that a species must some how be better then its ancestors. In 
 fact many species live side by side with their ancestors (the 
aforementioned subway mosquito) and some spec ies leave more than one 
descendent, for instance we share a common ancestor with orangutans, we 
aren't descended from them, a little further down the line we split with 
gorillas, even further we and chimps part ways, one group remaining 
superficially more sim ilar than the other. As for reproduction its 
necessary irregardless, if a species cannot reproduce its extinct plain and 
simple, until I see a rock form into a goat I will assume reproduction is 
absolutely necessary.     As for paragraph four I'm curious why you felt 
that 600 proteins were absolutely necessary, and the simplest life form 
imaginable is an ambiogenic compound, which is simply a chemical that 
reproduces.     As for your claim that there is no evidence of change over 
time this is absurd and due to ignorance of the evidence. The fact is that 
there is a fairly complete fossil record from prosimmian to monkey, to ape, 
to greater ape, to australopithecine to homin id to you and me. There are 
several rebuttals of your absurd claim at talk origins as well as a 
dinosaur specific rebuttal at dinosauria.


> I hope that this shows you all that you should always get

    Maybe you should take your own advice, on a final note science isn't 
believed it is understood, and revised when false, creationism on the other 
hand requires faith and belief, because it cant survive on its own.

I am sure many of you know about this but I recommend reading this text
anyway. Let me first say that I am not a very big fan of Microsoft, but Windows 
is a decent OS and there are many wonderful programs that require Windows to
run. If you insist on using Windows be aware that pretty much everything you 
do online is being recorded on your box.

I bet all of you cover your internet browsing tacks by deleting your history
and temp files. So now nobody will be able to see where you have been on the
internet, right? Wrong! Windows records and hides websites, search queries,
old e-mails, and much more.

One of the most important files to be aware of is the "index.dat" file. This
file stores a list of your history, cache and cookies. Most of these files
will not be clear when you delete them. The "index.dat" file should be located 
in one of the following directories. Just search around for it.

c:\windows\tempor~1
c:\windows\history
c:\temp
c:\windows\local settings\
c:\windows\application data\
c:\windows\temp\

Other folders you should give attention to are the ones with alphanumeric
names located under your IE content folder. They will look something like this:
QET6CF4J, 7YDF326U, U5FVHSI4, etc. You will have to boot to DOS in order to
see the full contents of these folders because windows explorer will not show
some of the files. Once you are in DOS navigate to where your alphanumeric
folders are located. The type cd %alphanumeric folder name%. Then type dir/p.

While your computer is in DOS mode you can also view the contents of your
"index.dat" file. Navigate to where your "index.dat" file is located and
type edit /75 index.dat. You should be looking at a screen full of binary. Just
scroll down till you start seeing your urls. These are all the sites you
have ever visited. I have even found old e-mails for hotmail accounts in these
folders.

I kinda had to rush through the writing of this text so I did not get to
include a lot of my research on this subject, so if you have any questions
or you cant get something to work please contact me at #outbreakzine on Dalnet.

So, you have an enemy who talks behind your back? Or, maybe you just
would like to "listen" in on your friend's conversations? Well, if you have
2 phone lines and call waiting on one of them, you are in luck. (Only one
problem.. Your friend must also have call waiting!)

Procedure:

Call up your friend with the phone you want to listen with.  When he
answers call waiting (he's already on the phone, and you are the 2nd caller)
then you either sit there or say: sorry, I have the wrong number..

Next, you wait until he goes back to the other line (puts you on hold).

Then, pick up your other line and call "YOUR" call waiting.

Answer call waiting

Then go back to him. (Answer, and then click back.. Click ->2<- times
Answer, and go back..)

Hang up your second line

You are now on the line!

Listen and be QUIET! He can hear you.

-

If you have call forwarding, turn it on and forward calls somewhere
before you start listening. If a call comes through on your call waiting
circuit, the people talking will not hear
anything, but after you answer call waiting and come back, they will
hear the other call hang up (two clicks). If you don't have call forwarding,
I suggest you get it if you are going to make a habit of this, because it
will become a major pain in the ass. When your call waiting rings, you are
removed from the "listening" conversation and placed back on his hold
circuit. In order to get back on, you must answer the phone and wait for
your party (when you answer the phone, tell the guy you are in a hurry and
you have to go or you'll call him back later or something) to hang up. When
he or she hangs up, you will be back on the conversation. Then, one of your
pals will say: What was that? (because of the clicks) So, try to use call
forwarding if you can. Remember, Have fun, and don't abuse it. =P
It is illegal (what isn't these days)
because it is "invading privacy". I don't know if the phone company just did
not realize there was a flaw in it, or that it was planned for line testing, I
am not sure. Have fun!

Opteron Rocks! Itaniums a Silly-con?
====================================
By: Prodigal|Son


The 32-bit processor has been out for awhile, since 1985 to be exact.  It changed 
the face of computing for a long time because it outperformed the 16 bit processors 
by a lot, and allowed computers to use up to 4 gigs of memory.  Times are changing, 
and soon people will be using a lot more ram than they already are.  4 gigs seems 
alot, but so did 640KB in 1981, and 64 bit should allow 1 terabyte. 64 bit CPUs 
have been used in servers for years, and servers need more memory then your average 
Joe's gaming machine. Software is demanding more and more RAM.  I remember when 16 
megs was enough for windows 3.1, and the most current version of windows, windows XP, 
demands as much as 128 megs.  That's more then a lot of hard drives had when 3.1 first 
came out.

The problem with using 64 bit processors is that software would have to be 
rewritten for 64 bit processors, which is tedious and time consuming.  Intel has the 
Itanium processor which only runs 64 bit software and operating systems.  The downside 
to this is that companies who use windows cannot use the windows server operating 
software, except there is a special edition of windows .net fir the new itanium CPUs. 
AMD has started on the 64-bit CPU bandwagon too, by bringing out a 64 bit CPU, code 
named hammer, but when released will be called opteron.  What's interesting about these 
CPUs is that they run 32 and 64 bit software and still uses the x86 instruction set, 
which the Intel itanium has abandoned.  This has Intel scared, because the opteron will 
be for servers, and also home workstations.  Microsoft has become a partner with AMD, 
and they're working on a windows for x86-64.

64 bit CPUs also run around twice as fast 
as 32 bit.  for example, a 900MHz opteron will run around 1700 or 1800MHz.  In order to 
run that fast, the processor would need 64-bit software, because 32 bit doesn't run as 
fast.

For the opteron to work and sell well, AMD has better get companies to write 
software for the 64 bit CPUs too.  if they can get the opteron to do well, and get 
companies to write software for them, then AMD might make it to the top in speed for the 
home computer market.  The 8th generation athlon will be based on the opteron, and will 
be used mostly for home computers and low end business workstations.

the opteron 
processor does not have a front side bus as everyone has come accustomed to.  it's all 
controlled inside the chip.  opteron's will be able to support up to 8 processors at a 
time, depending on which package you decide to use.

I have great hopes of this 
processor, and think it will do well.  I'll probably upgrade to the 8th generation 
athlon when it comes out, but I imagine that it will be pretty pricey.  so you better 
save up!
