Recursive Function Calls
========================
by Timeless
2002-06-10


One day I was messing around because I was bored and  thought  I'd  try  writing
some one-liner code in JavaScript. The first thing that came to me to try  was a
function that calls itself without any hope of breaking out of the sprial.

I simply placed the following in the address bar of Internet Explorer to run the
code and pressed Enter (some people like to use the "Go" button):

   javascript:function me(){me()}me();

Naturally, it ran out of stack space and presented  me  with  an  error  stating
the fact. This is perfectly acceptable behaviour.

Very well, so I tried a different approach. What if  I  made  the  function  add
characters to the web page (document body) recursively. Naturally I would either
expect to see a stack space error or an out of memory error  (whichever  happens
first). So here's my next one-liner:

   javascript:function w(){document.body.innerHTML+=' ';w()};w();
   
Well, shock, horror and disbelief... there was no stack nor memory error at all!
In fact, the browser just died on me! I had mixed results though and  needed  to
tweak the code a bit because in some cases it would only  crash  on  the  second
attempt. So I made it look like this (fit on one line please):

   javascript:function w(){document.body.innerHTML+=' ';w()};
      setTimeout('w()',100);w();

This new code would manage to run a second recursive call even after  the  first
one  had  died  (silently!).  This  time  it  killed  the  browser   much   more
consistently.

Notice that I am using "innerHTML", that's because "document.write"  behaved  as
it should - it reported an out of memory error. So basically, if  the  innerHTML
property can be overflowed... *insert your imagination here*

Very Interesting
----------------
By: kleptic <outbreak@fwaggle.net>


What makes someone an interesting person? 

To answer that question I'm going to use an excellent example of an interesting 
person: me. I am far more interesting than anyone else I have ever met. I am 
interested in all the same things as myself. 

The defining feature of an "interesting person" is that they are interested in the
same things you are. This is an undisputable truth. If you do not share interests 
with the person in question, you simply will not find them interesting. It is also 
true that the more interests you share with a person, the more interesting you probably 
find them. Therefore, seeing as you are interested in every single thing that you 
yourself are interested in, you must find yourself more interesting than anyone else 
you know. Don't worry, this doesn't make you a snob, just human. 

This could be proven untrue, of course, if it was essential for a person you find 
interesting to be a separate entity from yourself. For some people, this is 
undoubtedly the case. They find many other people interesting, but take no interest
in their own activities. This is probably the result of the person wanting to do what 
the people they find interesting are doing, but judging themselves unfit to participate, 
for some reason. Laziness? 

I could be wrong. Maybe some people truly are not interested in any actual activity, 
only other people. In that case, you could not possibly find them interesting, seeing 
as they have no interest that can be matched with one of your own. I find the existence 
of people who are only interested in other people fascinating. How do I classify my 
interest in them? I'm not intrigued by the actual people they are interested in, nor
any specific activity of the person, unless you consider not being interested an activity
in itself, or at least an inactivity. Does that mean I'm interested in not being interested?

Anatomy of Your Enemy
---------------------
By Justin Sane from Anti-Flag (off the mobilize cd)


10 easy steps to create an enemy and start a war:

Listen closely because we will all see this weapon used in our lives.
It can be used on a society of the most ignorant to the most highly educated.
We need to see their tactics as a weapon against humanity and not as truth.

First step: create the enemy.  Sometimes this will be done for you.

Second step: be sure the enemy you have chosen is nothing like you.
Find obvious differences like race, language, religion, dietary habits
fashion. Emphasize that their soldiers are not doing a job,
they are heatless murderers who enjoy killing.

Third step: Once these differences are established continue to reinforce them
with all disseminated information. 

Fourth step: Have the media broadcast only the ruling party's information 
this can be done through state run media.

Remember, in times of conflict all for-profit media repeats the ruling partyís 
information. Therefore all for-profit media becomes state-run.

Fifth step: show this enemy in actions that seem strange, militant, or different.
Always portray the enemy as non-human, evil, a killing machine.
 
Sixth step: Eliminate opposition to the ruling party.
Create an "Us versus Them" mentality. Leave no room for opinions in between.
One that does not support all actions of the ruling party should be considered 
a traitor.

Seventh step: Use nationalistic and/or religious symbols and rhetoric to define 
all actions. This can be achieved by slogans such as "freedom loving people 
versus those who hate freedom." This can also be achieved by the use of flags.

Eighth step: Align all actions with the dominant deity.
It is very effective to use terms like, "It is godís will" or "god bless our
nation."

Ninth step: Design propaganda to show that your soldiers
have feelings, hopes, families, and loved ones.
Make it cleat that your soldiers are doing a duty; they do not want or like to 
kill.

Tenth step: Create and atmosphere of fear, and instability
and then offer the ruling party as the only solutions to comfort the publicís 
fears. Remembering the fear of the unknown is always the strongest fear.


We are not countries.  We are not nations.  We are not religions.
We are not gods.  We are not weapons.  We are not ammunition.  
We are not killers. We will NOT be tools.

I'm not a fucker
I will not die
I will not kill
I will not be your slave
I will not fight your battle
I will not die on your battlefield
I will not fight for your world
I am not a fighter
I'm in unity.

INTRODUCTION - OPEN YOUR MIND, WE'RE GOING IN (OR OUT?)!

If you look back to "anTrojan Filez 3" (outbreak issue #4, page 2) you will  see
a glimpse at what you are about to learn in this article.

Some people ask me from time to time "are you still hacking the astral  plane?".
They are of course referring to astral projection (AP). Astral projection  is  a
technique for "travelling" out of your body. I'm not going to go too  deep  into
this, and if you're really interested you can go  and  get  some  pretty  decent
books on the subject from your local library or book store.

I am also not going to get into any religious or philosophical debates about  it
either! So don't even go there!


A BIT OF HISTORY

I've been experiencing weird and paranormal shit ever since I was a kid.  When I
was 16 I decided to learn about hypnosis in order to try and enhance any "gifts"
I might possibly have, or that may lie dormant within  me  (such  as  telepathy,
telekinesis, ability to see ghosts, sense emotions,  sense  people's  locations,
etc. - some of which I can do already). Hypnosis helped me with my French (using
self hypnosis) and rid my cousin of his smoking habit (using  auto  suggestion).
Hypnosis got me thinking about meditation, so I started  doing  T'ai  Chi  Chuan
(a martial art) to learn about a natural energy called Chi. Chi  can  make  your
arm as stiff as a board, or ground you firmly to the  spot,  or even  make  your
opponent do things they did not want to do (like fall down), for example.

Eventually  I  came  across  astral  projection  and  another  technique  called
Coordinate Remote Viewing (CRV - once secretly used by the military to  a  large
degree of success).


THE DESIRE TO LEARN

By this stage I was researching free  energy,  and  in  particular  the  use  of
magnets as a power source. There is much that I learnt about the subject, but it
got to a point where human understanding of the topic became limited.

This was the turning point where I decided to make use of the tools I had.

This is when I started "hacking" the astral plane  for  "new"  information  that
humans did not have already.


THE DARK SIDE

One of the possible activities of astral projecting is looking up information in
what is known as the  Akashic  Records.  Imagine  the  Akashic  Records  as  the
universe's database of everything. It's like being in "flat land" in a computer,
and you can see any piece of data you like.

Bring this back into the context of your short, mortal life on this planet. Want
to have some fun? Of course you do! You can use the Akashic Records to see  info
from the recent past, present and near future. If you get really good at it, you
could probably even get someone else's passwords!


CONCLUSION

I'm off now to be some insignificant and - hopefully - wealthy  inventor.  Don't
just take my word for all this though, go and read up on the topic for  yourself
and draw your own conclusions.

And so it continues, as your mind gets infected by the anTrojan filez (and after
reading this article you now begin to see how). Greetz to all at  #outbreakzine,
#hackerzlair and #tinylittlepyramid (it didn't need to be  a  very  big  pyramid
after all) on DalNet.

3l33t 0d4y Virgin cc's by dirV
-----------------------------------------------------
Aight guys heres some 0day l33tn3ss - It is really
really easy to get virgin cc's. All you really have
to do is goto a gas station- The gas station has to 
be a Quck Pay at the Pump One. Then go look in the 
garbage next to the pumps. You should find a few 
reciepts in the cans.  On the reciepts you will see
1. Credit Card Number
2. Expiration Date
3. Name on Card.
-----------------------------------------------------
Then you take the reciepts to your Home and get out 
the old phonebook.  You look up the persons Name in
The phonebook and get there Address and phone number
-----------------------------------------------------
If you Need a Cvv2 (three digit # on back of card) 
just goto #!chk #!check or type /list CC on dalnet,
goto a CC channel and they have !cvv2 triggers!
-----------------------------------------------------
Also If you dont have a gas station buy you, and you 
happen to be walking down the street and you see any
kind of reciept on the ground, pick it up and look at 
it because if the product that was purchased- was 
purchased by a credit card - The CC# - expir dat - and 
Name on card WILL ALWAYS BE ON THERE.

PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT : [The views expressed in this file are fucked 
                               and are not necessarily the views of anyone. 
			       Just becausa log appears here doesn't mean it 
                               hasn't been shamelessly edited to make 'snadman' 
                               and 'Timeless' look bad :p]

	Many would say that this was the best text file ever to come out of the
publishing corporation on Ersa Minor, but they'd be wrong. I'm sure a lot of
you see the people on IRC as completely normal, but have you ever take the
time to step back and look at just what kind of person 'ten_inches' is?

	Perhaps the best example of this is chat rooms. For some reason men see
'Lesbian Chatroom' and go bannanas. Say the room has 20 people in it. How 
many
of those do you think are women? All of them right? Wrong. You really think
you're the only man in their pretending to be a woman and fumbling your way
through the spelling of clitoris? Think about it. No, think harder. Yeah, 
that's right, I bet you wish you never gave 'busty_blonde' your mobile number now 
do you. This poses some deep physcological questions like 'If the fantasy is 
there, what does it matter who its with?' but I know Timeless would just get lost 
so I won't go into them.

	IRC channels generally tend to fall into 5 catagories in my experience:
1) RANDOM CHANNELS where one person with a name like 'single_n_looking' 
seems to be talking to everyone but no one seems to be talking to him. Or there 
are a load of people all talking at once and no one knows what message is being 
sent to them. For example:
   
<snadman> but 4 real a turtle head is pking out laughing at the inside of my
          boxers so i gotta get to the pot
<snadman> piking*
<snadman> poking*
<snadman> ahhh back
<GPC> good shit?
<snadman> T-A-K-I-N-G--A--D-U-M-P spells RELIE
<snadman> F
<snadman> yehp
<snadman> T-A-K-I-N-G--A--D-U-M-P spells RELIEF*
<snadman> :)
<GPC> oui,cest bon

2) RANDOM ROOMS that seem to be completely full but no one talks. The room 
is dead, there's not a single person saying anything. These rooms are 'cool'.

3) SILENT HACKING CHANNELS where people go to hang out to be cool but are 
too scared to say anything cos they're too scared of being called a script 
kiddie.

4) HACKING CHANNELS with about 5 "l33t hackers" who are only ops cos their
   mate runs the channel. They won't answer any1s questions cos they don't
   actually know anything:

<Dumbass> haha ur no l33t, im l33t. i have AOL 9.0 from a l33t 
          underground warez site lam0rs.
* SuCkEr  has joined #ubergodl33thaxx0rs
<SuCkEr> can u guys help me with some command
<snadman> shut up lamer. i was coding operating systems b4 u were born.
<SuCkEr> look. i just wanna know how to convert hex to decimal so I can
         re-write my .ini files to redirect my IP port scan.

* Long Silence

<snadman> someone boot this lamer, he is tlking whack shit man. Only l33t
          people shud be on this channel
<SuCkEr> er, are any of the ops even hackers in here?
<snadman> SOMEONE KICK THIS LAM00000R. HE IS ANGERING MY L33TNESS!!!!!!!!

5) CYBERING CHANNELS usually populated by the following:
   a) Boys pretending to be men		b) Men pretending to by boys
   c) Girls pretending to be women	d) Women pretending to be girls
   e) Men pretending to be lesbians	f) Kids who haven't realised what it is
   g) Timeless

So, in conclusion (its been a long time comming), next time you give your
number to 'tits_bigger_than_the_USA' remember its probably a balding
perverted 50 year old man choking his chicken while he's talking to you with
some girl's used pants on his head.

PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT 2:  [I apologise for any damage this file might
                                have done for any l33t egos. I also apologize
			        to 'snadman' and 'Timeless' for absolutely
			        mis-representing them. They're safe dudes :D]

the uselessness and dangers of identd
by: antimatt3r
Jun 6 2002
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

	The identification protocol (also knows as 'auth' on *nix systems)
is specified by RFC1413. This protocol in my opinion is useless and
potentially dangerious. The objective of this text is to inform you of the
uselessness and insecurities and make you wonder why the hell someone
integrated this protocol into the Internet.

	Okay the first thing is that its rediciolusly pointless. The first
fundamental assumption behnd this protocol is that computers are multi-user
timesharing systems with secured operating systems. So if someone is running
windows you've already got that one falsified. The second is that the
computer user and the computer admin are different people. This isint such a
bad assumption, because most of us dont log in as root on *nix and start
running our everyday routine. But, on windows, most of us have our user
account set as the administrator. The third and final assumption is that the
systems admin is trustworthy. This is about the most brilliant one of them
all.

	The upshot of these assumptions is that when recieving an ident
response you can trust the data that identifies a user who is trying to use
a network service on your server, because the admin on the other side who is
watching over his system and users with an eagle eye will readily and
happily identify his users to you, because you asked.

	Once again, the majority of computer systems on the Internet violate
ALL the assumptions, becuase they are running windows which are single user,
not secure at all and have the user and admin as the same person. As for the
admin being trustworthy who knows. The data that any computer will return
has no bona fides or other utility other than as a random string or bits
which may or may not relate in any way to the user of the system. Even the
author of RFC1413 says that the protocol cant be used for anything real (
section 6).

	The reason that the identification protocol is dangerous is that
there are some server admins who seem to believe that ident has some
utility, because they require it to use their services. (dalnet admins)
These people are deluding themselves, lulling themselves into a completeley
false sense of security - they believe that with ident they have an audit
trail which they can use to grab users who abuse their services. As the
protocol description above demonstrates, this is the assumption of a fool.

	For the final part of this text I would like to talk about why
dalnet requires that you give a ident response. When connecting to dalnet
you get the 'checking ident' signal and then usually ident response comes
through, if there is no ident response, you/we get akilled. If you whois
someone on dalnet and they have a ~ in front of their hostname (eg.
~antimatt3r@suckme.net) their ident was not verified. It seems that dalnet
dosent really care if people send fake ident responses because if you look
on http://kline.dal.net/exploits/unixident.htm they supply a 'fakeident' RPM
package. So now not only is the dalnet hierarchy fucking dumb, but they are
supplying tools to evade the rules that the have put in place.

	If your stuck without ident working, make sure your auth port is
uncommented in /etc/inetd.conf and try fowarding ports 5990 thru 6000 as
well as 113 if your on a routed intranet. If your using mIRC its in options
- connect - idnetd.

Society is what we picture it. Some picture it as a playground full of 
wonderment and chaos. Those people are the ones that stand out mostly 
and are criticized by local peers and put down. Maybe if only we took 
a step back and picture ourselves the way we wish to be pictured society 
would be awhole better place.

Now that I have that out of my way, lets begin.  Why are hackers so 
discriminated upon? Wait, let me rephrase that real fast, why are people 
that want to gain knowledge and freedom frowned upon? Why does society 
try to make us fit in their "mold" of what we should look like and dress?

The fact is that there are those out there that must fit into this mold and 
be "cool" and there are those that could give a flying fuck. Those are the 
ones that society discards and throws to the side. You never see "hackers" 
portrayed appropriately in movies and on TV. Most movies I see now adays 
show "children" breaking into someones highly confined system and wrecking 
it till theres nothing left. Which is in some cases sad but true, but the 
involuntary acts of kindness are astounding, most "hackers" are in it for 
the thrill of knowing they did something. They did it themselves, from what 
they have learned and read themselves, it has paid off. But is that how it 
portrayed?? I don't think so.

Therefore they must turn the public against us, and make everything we do 
wrong and obscene. The truth is that the government is scared of us, because 
of want we know, and what they don't. I believe that this will all come to 
end, its like history, everything evolves and falls, it is only time before 
the so called "hackers" are running your life, and you would of wished that 
you hadn't blasted them so much before. How can I say this? Well, lets 
see..... technology is going to expand and run your life.

Everything that you do will concentrate on a guy or machine typing on a 
keyboard somewhere in the world, and who is this? Its the guy you blasted 
during school, just because he didn't have friends, just because he didn't 
have a social life, just because he was different, Just because every time 
you saw him he was doing homework and reading books. Just you wait the tables
will turn my friend, and when you, the "cool" people are drowning in your 
own vomit of stupidity and realize what has happen it will be to late.

The day is coming you just wait and see.

just  as  in  real  life,  here  on  the  internet we mustn't make the 
assumption  that  we  can  fall  vitcim  only to our own insecurities. 
often, it is the insecurities of others that target us as victims.

what  follows  is  the  opinion of the writer and does not necessarily 
reflect  the  opinions  of  the  publisher,  however  it  might... and 
probably should. *smirk*

a  certain  class of vulnerability, known as cross-site scripting, has
been  increasingly  potent  on  the  internet over the last two years. 
since  its original recognition by CERT in February of 2000 cross-site
scripting  vulnerabilities  have surfaced in thousands of websites all
accross the web.

cross-site  scripting  takes advantage of weak verification procedures
when  dynamically  constructing webpages containing user-entered data.
this  vulnerability  makes  it  possible  to embed malicious code into 
websites with poorly written cgis.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

the  attack  itself  is simple, the solution to the problem is simple, 
but  the  implications and impact of the vulnerability are tremendous.

simply  passing  malicious  code  as  an attribute to a vulnerable cgi 
will cause the user to inadvertently execute the code.

for  those having trouble grasping this, consider the following. sure, 
malicious  code  has  been a problem for promiscuous websurfers for as 
long as malicious coders have been making webpages, but when malicious 
code  can  be  embeded into webpages that are trusted by even the most 
wary websurfers, thats when it becomes epidemic.

cross-site  scripting  vulnerabilities  have been found on some of the
most  widely  trusted  hosts  on  the internet. Microsoft, NBC, Lycos, 
Excite, CNet, Netscape, Ebay, and plenty more.

now,  imagine visiting a site with as much credibility as those listed
above and coming away from it with a virus. where does the blame go?

considering the amount of dependency people put on personal computers, 
and the amount of traffic generated by sites so credible, compensation
for  loss  is  probably very daunting in the eyes of the organizations
who  own those websites, and whos weak programming was exploited. this
is probably why they always use the malicious coders as the scapegoat.

don't get me wrong, of course those putting malicious code into effect
should  be held responsible for the damage they cause, but i also feel 
that  a  certain  amount  of  responsability  comes with self-promoted 
credibility.  after all, the damage could have been easily avoided had 
their cgis filtered the certain tags. 

i  suppose  the  only  real  purpose  this  text has is to educate the 
audience  of  the  great  injustice presented when large organizations 
can  mass-promote  themselves,  and not take responsibility when their 
insecurities victimize people.

*shrugs* i guess thats big business.

Cordless Beige Box
------------------  
By snadman 

Purpose
Have you ever been beiging off of cans and all of a sudden, well you see someone
and you don't have a grey box with you? Well, if you had a cordless Beige Box, 
then there wouldn't be a reason to worry in the first place, because you'd be up 
in the bushes on the side of someone's house while you're beiging off of a can 
right by the street! The cordless Beige Box gets around the problems of being seen.
Only time you have to worry about being seen is when you're unscrewing the security 
bolts on the can and hooking your beige up, and then when you're going to leave 
that area and have to take off your beige. Through creating this, though, there 
were a few minor difficulties which were overcome through use of what we already had. 

Materials
Cordless Phone (Base and Handset)
2 ft. Phone Cord
1x 9 volt
1x 7.2v Rechargeable Battery (from remote control cars)
^^^NOTE:Prolly want to buy a nice $20 trickle charger^^^
4x Small Gator Clips


Base/Charger Schematic
CLIP=gator clip
BASE= the base? lol
RB= 7.2v rechargeable battery
RBPlug= 7.2v rechargeable battery plug MB= magnet buzzer
R= Red line
G= Green line
+= + line
-= - line
||= Power Plug on Base []= Modular Plug on Base _= antenna *= Clip connection point

BASEBASE||-------------CLIP*RBPlug----RBRBRBRB
BASEBASE
BASEBASE[]RRRRRRRRRRRRRCLIP*terminal
BASEBASE[]GGGGGGGGGGGGGCLIP*terminal
BASEBASE


Step By Step
OK, now the schematic is tough so you may need this. First, with your phone cord, 
leave one end with the modular plug still attatched, but strip the other end. Now 
strip the Red and Green wires inside, which will be the center two if not colored
or if there are only two that's them. Solder on the clips to the two stripped Red 
and Green wires. Electric Tape/shrink-wrap to insulate them. Now, your *old* 
(hopefully) cordless phone base should have a little power supply for power which 
goes to a power plug thingy in the wall. Well, unplug the power supply from the 
wall first (dumbass alert if you didn't do this) and cut the power supply's wires. 
Now that it's cut, the end that doesn't plug into the wall is the one you want. 
It should be a little circle on the end that plugs into the base of your phone. 
Strip these wires so the wiring is exposed. Solder on some alligator clips. Now, 
please please do this...electric tape/shrink-wrap the alligator clips so they never 
touch. They will be close together later on and if they touch, not only will it 
drain your batteries but it will that to glow, ruin your clips, and also start some 
plastic on fire (which does not smell good!). Now, plug the circle part into the 
base of the phone, no lights come up as there is no power to the base yet. Now, 
with a charged 7.2v Rechargeable Battery, position the alligator clips so that 
they are clipped onto the metal pegs inside the plug on the battery. If it doesn't 
turn on, well then you have them mixed up (pos and neg) so switch which clips are 
clipped ot which pegs. There are only two clips and two pins so there are only two 
ways to do it, should work on way or the either. Somehow mark on the wire that ash 
the clips that goes to the base which is negative and which is poisitive for 
convenience. 

Next...
Now your base has power and the phone cord is ready to be hooked up to the terminals 
in the can, but what if all of a sudden your cordless handset dies...do you want to 
waste battery power as well as time to charge that bitch up? No! So do what I did, 
get a bunch of cheap 9 volts. Here's how to do that...

Handset Setup
This isn't too tough. Take your *old* cordless battery for that phone. It should plug 
into the handset through its own plug which isn't a normal one. Cut the wires from the 
irregular plug to the battery as close to the battery as you can and strip the wires. 
Now, take a 9v battery plug(thing with two silver circle to clip the 9v into with red 
and black wires coming out of it) and twists red to red, black to black. It's simple 
dude. Here are some pictures of mine. Of course, I never go out Beige Boxing and I don't 
support people doing that, this is just a bunch of rambling information.

As ye hath sewn so shall ye reap... (Atleast that is what my korn poster says)
By Atomichael aka Atomic Chaos

About a year and a half ago I was getting pretty bored. Bored and Lonely in this 
shit hole they call a city I decided to write some simple code that would scan
all of Pacbell's DSL subnets for users in my area running *nix based systems.To
my suprise I came across several insecure routers (in this case no password)
used by either home users or small businesses to connect their LANs to the
internet. Oh yea and I also found like 2 or 3 redhat boxes joy! With these
routers I did nothing more than test them by creating a loop back to my machine.
The routers offered me little entertainment since they were some generashits
anyway. I soon forgot about the routers, the three redhat boxes, my doomed quest
to find geeky friends in the local area, and eventually the logs were deleted.

Everything was fine until a couple days ago when I recieved these notices while
trying to connect to IRC on dalnet:

liberty.nj.us.dal.net- *** Got Ident response

And Dalnet's http://kline.dal.net/exploits/ :
Pacbell DSL Users

Due to a severe security issue we have regrettably been forced to suspend access
from Pacbell's DSL accounts to DALnet. We are in close contact with Pacbell and
hope to resolve this issue within the next couple of weeks. Updates to the
situation will be posted here as they become available and further details on
the issue can be found by clicking here.

There were no further details. I will not be clicking here on dalnet for a
while.

All criticism for supporting ma bell aside I like my adsl. I like being able to
connect to IRC with my adsl. I do not like little kiddy zygotes who create
packet shit storms for their own malformed and superfluous goals. Don't make me
come to your homes and wrap garden hoses around your necks until your beady
little eyes pop out of your deformed little heads. Despite my overwhelming
hatred for these putrid sacks of shit I cannot help but think that I am somewhat
responsible for my own fate.

Could this have been avoided had I informed Pacbell or would they have just
ignored me and allowed such decadence to progress? We will never know. Perhaps a
lesson can be learned from all of this. If your neighbor's dog is eating
chickens cut off it's balls before it reproduces and KFC goes out of business.
No that's not it. If your chicken is cutting off your neighbors balls.. I mean
when your dog is choking on a bone at KFC don't blame the chicken because you
didn't have the balls to cut your neighbor off while pulling out of your drive
way thus altering the space time continuum just enough to maybe save yourself a
trip to the vet.


Efnet rules Dalnet drools. Oh yea and who's idea was it to implement DCCALLOW on
dalnet anyhow. I do not appreciate being forced to /quote dccallow +nickname for
every person I'd like to recieve a -virus- from.

SMTP:Fakemail and SPAM

By: Turbanator

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SMTP is a pretty simple thing to learn.  First of all SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer
Protocal.  That means "(SMTP) A protocol defined in STD 10, RFC 821, used to transfer
electronic mail between computers, usually over Ethernet. It is a server to server protocol,
so other protocols are used to access the messages. The SMTP dialog usually happens in the
background under the control of the message transport system, e.g. sendmail but it is possible
to interact with an SMTP server using telnet to connect to the normal SMTP port, 25".

Usually to take advatage of SMTP you would need a SMTP server, or a shell account that supports
SMTP.  Lets use my telnet shell account at freeshell.org.

(NOTE:THE $ indicates the command prompt at the shell, whatever is after the $ is what would
be typed.)

First telnet to the host through port 25

 $Telnet sdf.lonestar.org 25

Then one connected, be nice to the host by typing Helo

 $Helo sdf.lonestar.org

Then think of who your going to send the email to, who it will be from, and what it will say.
Once you've done that you can begin the mail by typing the following into the shell prompt:

(NOTE:This is only used as an example, you can type in whatever you want for the from, rcpt, and data.)

 $Mail from: aol@aol.com rcpt: bob@aol.com data:Hi bob this is AOL, your powned! .quit

The .quit at the end will tell the SMTP server to end the message and send it.

Now why would I want to know this you ask?  There are alot of reasons.  Spammers for instance
use techniques like this to send you spam, maybe now you can send them a little spam (although I
dont encourage it!).  Also this is good for freaking people out and making them cancel their AOL
accounts (I havent dont that ;) ).  SMTP can be used for good and for bad, it all depends on the
person who imputs the information.  I hoped this has helped anyone who has been wondering about
SMTP, or just wants to read something cool.

Ok so here we go after many days of work with this " simple to build " box
I've come to a conclusion .... This shit doesn't work! And feel free to prove 
me wrong.

Lets start with what a black box is. BLACK BOX is a device that is hooked up
to your phone that fixes your phone so that when you get a call, the caller doesn't 
get charged for the call. This is good for calls up to 1/2 hour, after 1/2  
hour the phone company starts charging anyway because they think something weird 
about your phone just ringing for half and hour. The box keeps the line voltage 
from dropping to 10v when you answer your phone. The line is instead kept at 36v 
and it will make the phone think that it is still ringing while your talking. 
Now after much testing of the line with my electricity tester I've come to many 
discoveries that aren't mentioned in other text's, the voltage you want to measure 
in to see if its working is AC because it is kept at 0 volts until someone
calls you from that point it will jump up from 0 to 36-49V ... why somewhere in
between there you ask? Well it seems in different area of the U.S and I think the 
world it supplies different voltage, in U.S GA it was 44V. So someone calls you 
( pfft right as if someone would call your loser ass ) and it jumps up... you pick 
it up it should drop down to around 10V and stay there... What the resistor your 
going to put on the line is "SUPPOSED" to do is keep that voltage from dropping 
below 36V so it looks like its ringing and ringing (simple eh?). But after much 
testing with the proper resistor and other resistors I've proven it fails to work, 
and not only does the voltage drop but also it kills the connection and gives the 
caller a busy signal. Anyway, here are the schematics for the box try it your self 
I'm sure you will find the same results as I tried this with multiple phone lines and 
phones. I think what happened is this used to work somehow previously but the phone
company found a way to fix the line for it * shrug *

All parts are available at Radio Shack.  (As fucking usual)


                    **  Schematic 1 for most phones  **

*You may just have two wires which you connect together for the switch.

  Parts:  1 1.8k 1/2 watt resistor
          1 1.5v LED
          1 DPST switch


If you look close and your not a retard you will notice all your basically doing 
is putting a 1.8k 1/2watt resistor on the red wire of your phone line. Simple right?
WRONG. How do you know it's working? How do you know your phone will work? Well, you
got to test it! So get daddies old AC/DC/Ohm tester out and touch the red pen to the 
red wire and black to green and make sure your testing the AC on the wire. That way 
when it doesn't work you will see how it doesn't work. =)

Anyway, this evo255 pissed because he wasted a lot of time and came up with
the result that this shit doesn't work any more.

Feel free to try and experiment and hack it yourself maybe you will find
another way to get the same result... when you do email me and tell me how 
you did.

Much thanks to dropcode for his help in obtaining most this info as well.

bluecat9's rantz on Winblowz Netbios Protection & Hackin'.

So you have Winblowz and you wanna hack the planet?!? Why not?

Protection:
If you use MS Windows, Broadband, and your PC is on a home network (LAN),
with "Shares" you may be a redneck. To test obtain your IP (Start>Run>Type:
WINIPCFG), Then (Start>Run>Type: \\YOURIP) and press ENTER. Wait a second, if 
you got an error message your not vulnerable and can skip to "Hack the Planet." 
But, if you got an Explorer-Like window with your shares displayed you ARE vulnerable.
By this I mean, everyone on the Internet can access your "Shares" just as you or other
people in your house on other computers do on your network. So, how do you protect
yourself? Here are some resolutions, the easiest but 100% fix is to change your
Share's name from "C" or what ever it is named, to "C$" this will make the Share
hidden. The only difference now is when you want to access a share you will have to
type in the full path to the share. Example: Start, Run, Type \\YOURPCNAME\C$,
and press Enter. Now, if someone does happen to peek at your network they will not see
the shares, but if they guess the name of your share they can access it just as
you would. It's not a good idea to use simple share names such as A, B, C, which can be
easily guessed. Password protection is not a 100% fix for this problem, but a good
idea. Some other solutions are, installing a firewall, using USB vs Ethernet for
your broadband modem, removing the shares altogether, unbinding the service
(File and Printer Sharing) from the protocol (TCP/IP) that is bound to the
adapter (NIC) that is attached to your broadband modem. Purchasing a new
broadband modem which has a built-in firewall. Ok so your protected, let's hack
already!

Hack The Planet:
Now you know about the issue, let's find someone that isn't protected! (evil
laugh) It's as easy as obtaining an IP and performing the following,
Start, Run, Type: \\THIERIP. Man was that hard! So, you got someone's IP,
tried that, and you got an error message? They're not vulnerable, deal with it? OrÖ You
saw all the pretty little shares!!! Alriiiight! The best we can hope for is a user
who has their entire hard drive shared out with full access. If not, you may have
fun just browsing their files? So you didn't get an error message but they don't have
any viewable shares?!? Try guessing a few hidden share names, like
A$,B$,C$,D$,E$,HD$, MY DOCUMENTS$  and PRINTER$. Oh sure you'll have fun printing to their
printer. OK, you know how to get in the door, but it takes to long trying one IP
after another! Sure it does. Search the internet for "NETBIOS SCANNER" or "SHARE SCANNER"
and I'm sure you'll come up with something fun which will most likely let you
scan entire class C's! (x.x.x.0 to x.x.x.255) That should get the party started!
Now your on your way to hackin' the planet but you've run into shares that
are password protected, no worries. Because lo and behold there are programs
available to crack share passwords in a matter of seconds! A good search for "NETBIOS
SHARE PASSWORD CRACKER" or something similar should do the trick. Know this, some
ISP's block netbios communication (Port 139) through their network leaving you
unable to connect remotely to another network using netbios, so sorry.

Remember. You're limited only by your own imagination.

		PUT THE WORDS IN HERE:

        Well, here is issue #7. We're finally learning how to get these
        out a bit quicker with more content. So I hope you all enjoy
        this issue. It's jammed packed full of some good stuff.

        And as always, we are ALWAYS looking for articles written by
        our readers. That's how Outbreak strives. So if you have an 
        article that you've written laying around on your hard drive..
        send that puppy our way.  Or if you want to write something for
        us, that would be cool to.  The more articles the better.
  
        Send all texts to: outbreak@fwaggle.net

        Well, enjoy #7, and start sending me stuff for #8. 
        
        Thanks to everyone who submitted articles for this issue.
