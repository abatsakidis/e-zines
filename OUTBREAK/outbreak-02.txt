                                  -by `Enigma-


--------------------------------
1. What the hell is a honeynet?
--------------------------------

let me first explain what a honeynet is for those of you that don't know. a 
honeynet is a network that is designed to be broken into. this network of computers 
is wired with sensors to monitor the actions of intruders. it is then put up on 
the internet, giving it a appealing name and alluring content. when hackers break 
into the network their actions are then recorded such as: how they break in, when 
they are successful, what they do when they succeed.  

--------------------------------
2. Layers of Security
--------------------------------

the most important thing when constructing a honeynet is layers. layers of 
security are vital when it comes to analyzing an attack on your honeynet. you 
need to anticipate failure on your honeypots. therefore by having multiple 
security layers built into your architecture you solve the problem of single 
layer failure. failures include firewalls not warning you of suspicious traffic,
syslog failure (send or receive system logs), DNS not resolving. you would be 
surprised at what will go wrong.

--------------------------------
3. Selecting Your Hardware
--------------------------------

one of the nice things about setting up a honeynet is that the systems you use 
don't have to be geared towards performance. for example i used old pentiums 
with 64MB of RAM, and a some old sparc5 boxes. for the internet connection use 
whatever you have available.

--------------------------------
4. What OS should I use?
--------------------------------

the operating systems on your boxes is entirely up to you. i recommend using 
default installations of RedHat and/or NT 4.0 running IIS webserver. if you want to
use solaris, end user package 2.6 (unpatched) should work well. it is a good idea 
to use easily exploitable versions of operating systems. default installations are 
a good idea in most cases, as they are the least secure. remember these systems are
designed to be compromised, but don't make this obvious to the intruder. the idea is
to keep the intruders attention without scaring him off. as for keeping their attention, 
turn your network into some sort of classified NSA project. use your imagination.

--------------------------------
5. In order to learn you must...
--------------------------------

regular maintenance of your honeypots is vitally important. you can't just set 
up your network and leave it expecting to learn. you must regularly check logs 
for signs of an attack. you never know when or how your systems will compromised,
but they will. i guarantee you will capture some interesting activity.

--------------------------------
6. Closing
--------------------------------

in closing let me say that you can't go about this project half assed. so if you
just want to set a honeynet to fuck with some script kiddies please disregard 
everything you just read. constant monitoring of your systems is required for a 
successful learning experience. so have fun!

for futher reading on honeynets i recommend the book "Know Your Enemy: Revealing the 
security tools, tactics and motives of the blackhat community."

                           -----Security at my  Wall-----
														--<<<`das `amatier>>>

	OK, this text is dedicated to all the Liam ass motherfuckers that have
cable/dsl switches and think they are "l33t hax0rz" since they have 2 or more
computers on it.

	I have used dial-up connection for a real long time. I waited for
broadband to come around my area, be it Cable or Dsl I didn't give a fuck what
came first it was first come first...I'm getting it. Anyhow I ended up getting a
RoadRunner Connection. I hooked up one of my favorite computers to the cable
connection via cable modem. I always used a Software Firewall for dial-up. So the
Software firewall was always running waiting for something to hit my ports I'm
not going to say what Firewall I was running since everyone complains and argues
that they have the best fucking Software Firewall on Earth. I'm sick of that
shit. So anyways, within one day I had like over a hundred IP's doing different
scans/attacks on my system a day. I even had my Software firewall get shut down
on me a few times, due to really hardcore fucking fool. Well enough of that.
Anyways, I was enjoying my Broadband Connection so much, I said to myself, "I
have to get all my boxes online, I need all of them online."  Anyways, I looked
into all those cheep dsl/cable switches. I got a switch for $99 and that seems
to work fine but I noticed that my connection speed wasn't up to snuff anymore.
I blamed my ISP, so I called them up. The tech asked me a few questions and said.
"Aha. It's the switch, you're not the first person to have this happen to." I was
like, "oh, really." He also told me for 5 bucks more a month I can get a second
dynamic IP address. I was almost suckered into the 5 extra bucks a month. I also
asked him, "well, I don't want to spend 5 more dollars a month, Is there anything
else I can do to get my other computers online." he told me to read my policy.
After I read it, it stated that if I wanted like 5+ computers online it was 5
dollars a computer for each one. That must have included a dynamic IP for each
box. Or pay 80-120 dollars a month for a business account, which was the same
connection speed as I was already getting for 40 dollars a month. 2 mbs download
and 340 kbs upload. I told him that that was jerkin my chain, and ended the
conversation with him. I knew the tech didn't have any answer for me and was
trying to get me to spend more money for the same shit.

	 I started surfing the web for a perfect linux distro to make a
firewall/gateway router setup that I could build from spare parts around my
computer room. First I set up a 200mhz box with 2 nic cards on it and freebsd
as the OS. That was cool at first but then realized that it was a waist of a box
to have a great working full linux distro box go to waist just sitting their as a
gateway/router. Even thought that this was a kick ass setup, I wanted to make a
smaller box for a router. I looked around the net and came up which a few cool
linux router floppy distro's and thought I would try a couple of them. I started
off trying these cool little floppy distro's and fell in love with mini linux
distro`s.  After 2 months of playing around, one day my browser landed on
WWW.freeSCO.ORG this distro claims it had not only firewall/gateway server but
it had tons of services that can be run from this little floppy disk. I was like
no fucking way. I started on d/l it after I read the whole web site. It was still
fairly a new distro then with very little support on the web page. I dusted of an
old COMPAQ I hate Compaq's by the way. But anyhow. This box was a 33MHz with 20
meg hard drive8 megs of ram, I beefed it up with a Pentium overdrive processor
250 meg hard drive and 32 bytes of ram and a internal fan for the newly added
heat from the overdrive. I added in 2 nic cards and a 56kbs true US Robotics
modem not on that 3com manufactured after they took over. I had my Freesco box
up and running within 15 minutes I was still little rusty on the knowledge and
the know-hows the ins and outs of my newly found Internet router/server setup.
I spent hours researching as much as I could on Freesco, by the way Freesco, the
name stand for FREE cISCO. After I learned some install tricks from other freesco
users I had my little 486 screaming as a web server, a ftp server, a time server,
a dhcp server, oh ya and the most important part is that I could share internet
usage on my LAN without degrading my bandwidth. I can have 5 to 10 people on my
LAN playing Quake2/Quake3 on the Internet all of use having 50-ping time or less
all at the same time I could never do that with a dsl/cable switch, this was the
proof of the pudding for me. That Freesco was a leet setup for leet people....
hehehe. Anyways, My Freesco Floppy Distribution now runs on my hard drive since
I customized the crap out of it. Anyways, it all comes down to that those cheap
ass cable/dsl switches are OK since you can set it up in 5 minutes or less. And
you can have a little safety but most people don't even password protect them.
ya you fucking lamers. Password protects your routers. Dumb asses. Anyways, if
your looking for a leet ass way to have LAN parties, be it gaming or hacking,
then a Linux Floppy distro might be good for you. I love my freesco box. It is
what I like to call fuckin-high-speed-shit... as in real fucking leet. My little
freesco box does more in a minute then most peoples computers do all day
long..... And oh ya I forgot to mention that the Freesco is more configurable as
a router then a dsl/cable router. It goes along ways. You can customize the
distro for your own usage. Oh, the other cool thing I could do that switch
couldn't do is dial into my LAN and get true 56k-speed connection to my gateway,
not 53,333 kbs I connect at 56kbs from a remote location. Like a mini ISP for
hackers. 

	I hear there is a new version of freesco coming out soon. I can't wait
till the day.... Everytime I See a ol 486 kicking around I Smile to myself and
think "Ya, that would make one fucking hell of a FREESCO BOX".+.+.+.+.+

			   Destruction on the Internet
			   ---------------------------


	Being a 7 year vetran of IRC, and BBS's before that, I have seen 
the many faces people can take on the internet.  The internet is a lovely 
place.  The Mentor wrote many years ago about "We exist without skin 
color, without nationality, without religious bias...".  Well?  I think 
he was right.. in his time.  Times change.  We now have IRC Network bias, 
nickname discrimination, and digital citizens that would rather do 
nothing but destroy.  It is these that I feel have disgraced the words of 
The Mentor.  
	Many times have I read articles speaking of children with huge   
egos that feel destroying or damaging is a form of superiority.  "I can 
packet you", "You won't be able to get online and you will think I am  
great."  I think you've got it wrong.  The only ones that think your 
great, is... well.. 
	I will not praise you for your "great" packeting abilities.  I 
never will.  I will not praise you for your "great" ability to destroy.  
Why would I?  You are destructive.  Packeting is destructive.  It 
destroys the connectivity many people rely on for day to day 
communications.  It severs the crucial link businesses depend on.  You 
packet stupid stuff like IRC networks even.  This is a FREE service.  
People donate hardware and bandwidth so ANYONE can chat freely!  So why 
do you destroy it?  That is the same as me tearing out a 50 foot chunk of 
street right in front of your house just because I don't like you.  
	I can't understand it.  Are you kids looking for praise?  I'll 
give you praise when you do something worthy of it.  Make something 
beautiful.  Make something useful.  You people write code that has 
1000x the potential its being used for.  Lets use packeting bots for  
example.  You code slave bots.  Distribute them.  The more the better 
correct? And all these bots are set to respond to their master.  You.   
Say you distribute 50, 100, 500, 1000 bots.  You can really hold down 
some hardcore bandwidth.  Right?  You've also just built a scalable 
master/slave infrastructure that is capable of mass distribution of a 
message or any other media with the proper revisions.  Then you can 
copyrite YOUR technology, and make millions off of it.  
	Of course, you'll be forced out of business after the first year.  
See, one of your customers (13) posted content that took on the face of a 
political message.  Someone not liking that message packets key elements 
of your network for 4 months straight.  Not being able to stop it, you 
can't charge for a service that isn't working.  No income means no money 
to pay bills, suddenly you join the rest on fuckedcompany.com.  Fate is 
funny like that sometimes.

Some Odd Dreams I had
---------------------
By: kleptic <kleptic@grex.org>

NOTE:  These are actual, REAL dreams that I have had. No fooling.




DREAM ONE:  Eddie Murphy's Conscience
-------------------------------------

OK, here's the scene: Eddie Murphy's in a convenience store or a gas station
or something, and he's thinking about stealing a candy bar. That's pretty
stupid of him, because I'm sure he's filthy rich from his success as an actor,
but regardless, he wants that candy bar and he doesn't want to pay for it. I'm
floating above his left shoulder.

"Now, Eddie," I say. "Think before you do anything you'll regret. You'd don't
want to lose your powers, do you?" So, apparently Eddie Murphy has some sort
of super powers, possibly bestowed upon him by God. It would explain a lot of
things, like how he can suddenly gain and lose tons of weight at will, as he
demonstrates in the Nutty Professor. (Eddie, I urge you. No more Nutty
Professor movies. That kind of rapid weight gain and loss can't be good for
you)

He can also appear to be in several places at once, and even where different
costumes! Sounds like God-given superpowers to me. Back to the dream.

Eddie says to himself (he thinks it's to himself, but he's really telling me,
since I'm a part of him) "Oh yeah! My powers!" and he grabs the candy bar and
disappears in a poof of smoke. I groan and disappear too. That scoundrel
didn't even hesitate to use his powers to steal! God's going to be pissed.
One of these days, Eddie, one of these days... 



DREAM TWO:  In Heaven and Hell
------------------------------

I died. I don't remember how, but it is of no consequence.

First thing I remember, I'm floating up toward heaven. Sweet! I'm going to
meet God! That should be interesting, to say the least. I've got a million
things to ask him.

I make it. Hmmm... Heaven is a big empty room. And God... well... God is a big
jiggly jello mold. He's shaped like a huge gumdrop, and his facial features
(eyeballs, and mouth) float inside him like fruity delights. He looks pretty
tasty. I walk up to him (he's probably 50 feet tall and has a 40 foot diameter
base) and say, "Hi God, Are you made of Jello?"

He doesn't answer. His eyes roll down and look at me, and they narrow.
Something's wrong. Then I notice. Eeek! The walls are all red, and the Jello
mold in front of me is red like strawberry gelatin! I'm not in heaven! This
is Hell! And the giant red Jello mold in front of me is none other than the
prince of darkness himself, Satan!

I turn and run. There's a tube protruding from the ceiling. I leap and it
sucks me in. I pop out the other side into a huge room, identical to the one
in Hell, except it is a soothing blue color, and before me a huge blue Jello
mold with kind eyes and a huge grin suspended inside like fruity delights
smiles down at me.

Hi God. Nice to meet you.

Ever wonder, or even cared about the history of computer hacking?  I have, but
then again, I'm a computer geek, but there's nothing wrong with that :). Here
is a very, very brief history of hacking.  Hacking did not start with the
computer, but with the telephone.  2 years after the phone was invented, a
group of guys hired to work the switch bored got knocked off for not working
the switch bored, and were more fascinated with the interworkings of the
telephone system.  So i guess you could call them "hackers" for trying to hack
in and try to see how it worked.

But as you would probably guess, the term "hacker" did not always have a bad
name.  In the early days of computing, the computers were big and bulky, and
the programmers had a hard time getting work time to program, and not to
mention they were slow.  The programmers made shortcuts called "hacks" which
would change and improve the operating system and allowed applications and
other tasks to be completed in a shorter amount of time.

The term "hacker" didn't get its bad wrap until the early 80's when people
started using computers to break in to other computers.  With all of that
boring stuff said, hackers proved a necessary service, and always remember,
don't hate the hacker, hate his game.

TCP/IP part I
--------------
By: antimatt3r (aka: xD0Sx, Tim)

Introduction:
   TCP/IP remains a hot topic these days, because it is, was, and always will
be the glue that holds the Internet and World Wide Web together. In order to
be well-connected, network wise that is, sooner or later you have to become
familiar with TCP/IP. So if you want to understand what it is, what it does,
what its for, why you need it, and what you do with it, but you just don't
know where to start - this text is for you.

   This IS NOT a formal tutorial, skip around a bit and read as much or as
little as you want. If you feel the need to impress colleagues and even your
boss, gather enough information to throw them around a bit at meetings and
cocktail parties. On the other hand, you can go as far as discovering the
most important features and tools, as well as the role that TCP/IP plays in
the Internet. It's all right here on your screen.

So now, we begin getting in to the technicities of this wonderful protocol. 

	TCP/IP Stands for Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol

A protocol is a set of rules for behavior that people accept and obey.
Sometimes the rules are written down, the rules for driving for example. Still
they vary from country to country and region to region. In the United States,
a yellow light means, prepare to stop, the light is going to turn red. But in
Germany, a yellow light means, get ready, the light is going to turn green.
Similarly, two or more computers need rules for behavior.
	
Common behaviors regarding the connection are not enough. There also has to
be a common language. To communicate, the computers need to `speak' the same
language, and the one they use most often is TCP/IP.

So in the world of computers, a protocol is the collection of designated
practices, policies, and procedures - often unwritten but agreed upon by the
users - and the language that facilitates electronic communication. If
networks are the basis of the Information Superhighway, the TCP/IP protocols
are the rules of the road. 

TCP/IP is often referred to as the protocol of open systems. Here is the
world's shortest definition of open systems. Open systems provide a
standards-based computing environment. The term "open systems" is kind of a
computer industry buzzword. Many of the concepts of open systems began with
the UNIX operating system. Even though UNIX runs of dozens of different
computers, most of the commands are the same on every computer.

So although TCP/IP sounds like just one or two protocols, it is actually a
whole set of protocols for connecting computers into the Internet. This set
of protocol is called the TCP/IP stack.

You may be used to thinking of a transport as the way you move yourself or
your things around. But computer networks move information from one place to
another. Many times you don't care exactly how the data gets where it needs
to go as long as it arrives on time, affordably, intact and uncorrupted.
TCP/IP is both a transport for carrying your data and a protocol with rules
for how your data should move. And there is one more piece: TCP/IP also has
a set or applications, or programs, for chatting with other people on a
network, for moving files, for signing on to other computers, and more. 

TCP/IP ties networks and the Internet together, regardless of the hardware
and software used to build those networks. TCP/IP runs on and connects just
about everything. You may have heard about other network protocols such as
IBM's SNA or Novell SPX/IPX. But no protocol connects as many different
hardware and software platforms as TCP/IP. This versatility is the reason
that TCP/IP is the worlds' most popular	network protocol.

From the beginning, TCP/IP was designed to link computers from different
vendors such as IBM and Hewlett Packard, to name just two. Other network
protocols are no where near this flexible. With TCP/IP, you can buy the
computer you want or need and know that it can communicate with all of the
others. Because all implementations of TCP/IP must work together, or
interoperate, regardless of who created them, you may have several
implementations from which to choose. The various products may differ in
price, number of features, performance, or in any number of other ways.
Investigate your options carefully and make the right choice for your
circumstances.

The widespread incorporation of TCP/IP is one indication of its popularity.
Other vendors' TCP/IP implementations are still important, though, because they
may have features that the bundled implementations don't have. 

Computer networking is rapidly becoming a part of life - not just at work, but
as home as well. Networks are a combination of hardware and software, and the
TCP/IP protocols are the software that glues their hardware into a working
network. So before you get into the software, I think you should understand
some basic network concepts and terminology, as well as the relationship
between networking hardware, and software.

TCP/IP provides connectivity for networked computers. Because its hard to
describe just the TCP/IP piece without introducing how the machines are
organized and cabled together in a network, this part of the document
describes just that.

A network is described as being a combination of computers (and other devices)
along with the cabling, the network interface controllers that are inside the
device, and the network software. The protocol software governs how information
gets transported on the network hardware, and TCP/IP is the more widely used
protocol on the largest variety of hardware.

So what kind of devices can be a part of a network you wonder? Any device that
sends or receives information can be part of a network. Computers, PDAs,
printers, cash registers, communication devices and lots of thing you might
not expect to see on a network such as pop machines, toasters and toilets can
be part of a network.

With all those hardware possibilities to be placed on a network, you can see
why you need rules for how data is transferred across the connection media
among all those components. These rules are the network protocols, such as
TCP/IP. Some of the other network protocols available are IPX from Novell and
SNA from IBM as mentioned earlier. 

Networks and protocols are inseparable; without networks protocols have no
reason to be around, and without protocols, networks would just be piles of
expensive hardware that would be useless. It would be like driving without
knowing what a car was. Impossible.

A network provides many conveniences and services to its users. You can move
information and files from one computer to another. Without copying them, you
can access shared objects like directories and files on other computers. You
can share printers attached to other computers, use applications that take
advantage of the network, send e-mail to other people who are connected to
the network, use Internet telephony software, participate in electronic
discussion groups and learn new things by taking classes online, browsing the
Internet or taking web-based seminars called webinars.

To make recourse sharing useful and reliable, most organizations install
computers that are dedicated wholly to sharing disks or printers with many
other users. These computers are managed so they will always be available and
are called file servers, print servers, or just servers. 

Protocols are not really tangible "things" on the network. Instead, they
specify how tangible things communicate with each other. Each time a network
device manipulates your data, it obeys the rules of TCP/IP.

One rule stipulates that your data may have to be transferred in smaller
pieces. TCP/IP makes sure your data does not get ruined in the process of
getting put together again after an error. For example, King TCP/IP tells the
network devices what to do with Humpty Dumpty's pieces.

The data that you send and receive over the network is packaged into one or
more packets. Each packet holds the data that it has to transmit, and control
information, which tells the network what to do with the packets. 

The network protocol - in this case TCP/IP - determines the format for each
packet. And all of this is transparent to the user. The difference between
Humpty Dumpty and your messages is that your messages can be put back together,
as for Humpty, he's scrambled. After the packets are sent, they may not arrive
in order at their destination. When your data gets spread over many packets,
TCP/IP governs how the packets are put back together after being split,
transferred, and arriving at their destination. TCP/IP sequences packets
correctly.  To be continued in the next issue of Outbreak Magazine!

                  how to kick someone's ass
                                   an outbreak guide
                                                     by fwaggle

(WARNING)
this is somewhat a gag text. if you go and get your ass beat - or worse - kill
someone, then that's your own stupid fault for actually putting what you read
in this magazine into practice. you've been warned - i won't take
responsibility for any misfortune which might result from you reading this
text.

(introduction)
let's get down to business. someone's pissed you off in some way, and talking
it out just doesn't work. it's time to get dirty (or your knuckles bloody).
i'm probably no expert in this being that i've only been in like 5 fights in
my whole life (i'm happy to report though that all of them were real fights -
see below).

obviously, the first step is to attempt to talk your way out of the situation
that requires someone's ass getting kicked - preferably someone other than
you (unless you're fighting me, in which case forget everything you read in
this text and try bitchslap me). sometimes though, this fails. that's when we
progress to the next level, the ancient martial art of ass kicking.

ass kicking has existed far longer than any of the other martial arts. there is
no strict discipline, no belt levels, dans, or anything else. there's really
no breathing control involved either. ass kicking dates back to the caveman
days. say there's two cavemen, and a hot cave-chick. 

for simplicity's sake, i'm going to call the first caveman "caveman
9812378952" and the second caveman will be referred to as "caveman
1982347891". the cave chick will be referred to as cave-chick, in the
interests of detail.

caveman 9812378952 is happily snogging with cave-chick, who just happens to
be the lady friend of caveman 1982347891. now here you will notice that ass
kicking dates back PRIOR to complex verbal communication languages
including that which we call english (you should know something about this if
you're reading this text, unless it got translated into some alien language in
which case - ELITE! aliens may probe me my address is 484-... *ahem*).

anyway.. caveman 1982347891 tries to talk the problem out - which for caveman
consists of a simple "ugh". this is caveman talk for "what the fuck are you
doing with my woman you delapidated mammoth foreskin?", to which caveman
9812378952 replies "unga bunga". this is a simple response, something which i
estimate will translate roughly to "can't you see i'm about to start bangin
her like a flint rock?".

obviously this is not the response that caveman 1982347891 was looking for, so
he promptly picks up a large rock and smashes caveman 9812378952 in the face
with it. cave-chick notices his obvious testicular fortitude and falls madly
in love again. she and our happy caveman now feast on the remains of caveman
9812378952.

the obvious point here is that while violence is not necessarily a preferred
solution, it is often a speedy way to resolve problems. in this case, the
resolution was final. let's move on and discuss pussy fights and real fights.

(pussy fights)
never make the mistake of pussy fighting, even for a second. pussy fighting
is the act of pushing your opponent with your arms, or chest - often
accompanied by repeatitive shouts of "you want some?" or something to that
nature. this is silly. firstly, you lose any possible element of surprise
(your best friend, see later). secondly, it wastes valuable slugging time. it
also usually results in a large crowd gathering prior to any punching
occuring, which also speeds in the response of authoritive figures such as
teachers at school or police at other public venues.

NEVER pussy fight.

(the element of surprise)
surprise is your best friend, especially in the school yard where most others
are well versed in the art of pussy fighting. while they are coming you to
you, pushing you with their chest, if you're tall enough - head butt the
cunt! if you're not, a quick jab up under the nose, up at an angle usually
does wonders as an opening move.

the overall idea is: hit first, and make sure you're the last one hitting.
preferably, you're the only one hitting. when perfected, you need never get
hit. 

suitably surprising opening moves can include the abovementioned jab and
headbutt. with the headbutt, don't be a hardass and butt heads - it
invariably hurts you as much as them. instead, aim to hit just above your
brow right smack on top of the nose. obviously causing nose breakage is a
huge advantage for you - not only does it sting like fuck but it makes your
eyes tear up and your sinuses start to run. three distractions in one!

if your opponent is running at you and you're NOT retarded enough to try and
headbutt them, then try just doing a jump kick to the kneecap. for example if
your assailent is running at you with intent to "press and knuckle" (land on
you and beat the snot out of you) - at the last minute, jump a small jump and
aim to kick at about a foot off the ground, putting all your power into his
kneecap. if done correctly, you can twist, sprain, over extend or break the
joint. nasty shit, but an amazingly effective fight-stopper.

if you're - shall we say - "husky" then you could quite conceivably have a
good deal of success against smaller assailants with a running elbow. simply
hold your right wrist in your left hand, with your elbow out perpendicular to
your body. do this at the second last second, and just take like a fast step
forward and WHACK take his fuckin head off.

(following through)
once you have gained the upper hand from the opening, it's important not to
lose it. if you can last the entire fight with the upper hand (preferably
never letting your oppenent land a punch), then you're virtually assured the
win. if your assailant is on the ground, then use some of those submission
moves you learnt on wwf smackdown!. just some hints though, most of them take
a little modification to actually work.

for example, unless you have huge biceps like HHH, then kurt angle's ankle
lock is unlikely to do much damage. so try this on your little brother: when
they're on the ground face-down, clutch the ankle in your left elbow against
your chest, and press down with your other hand, in an attempt to make their
toes touch the front of their shin.

if your opponent is on their back and you have some time, there's a nifty lil
bastard i learnt in judo (the hard way) called the "mongrel hold". simply
climb on the victim, press your knee into the sternum, and pull up on the
shoulders. keep pulling up till they squeal like a pig. for added
entertainment, start yelling in their face "ima make you squeal like a pig
baw".

(if they don't go down)
if they don't go down first go, it's important to still not lose the
upperhand. even if they don't show it, chances are you took them by surprise
(unless they're like a marine or SAS or something - in which case i can't help
you) anyway. don't give them a chance to get their bearings. aim for weak
points such as the nose, neck, lips (and behind them, teeth) and the solar
plexus. use the first two first if possible, as they'll have markedly more
effect than the last two.

(countermeasures)
if you have the reactions, and someone is trying to punch you, try to grab
their arm. if you manage it, you can utilize their momentum and use it against
them. for example, for a high punch, grab the arm, turn, squat, then when you
feel an impact on your back, push up with your legs and bend over. if someone's
running at you really hard, they can fly quite far (ask my cousin).

for low punches, use a wrestling "irish whip". simply spin with them, and
slingshot them into something like a wall or a car or something. sure,
wrestlings fake, but if you put all your might into an irish whip you can do
some real serious damage. the best is when they trip right before they smash
into a car door or something.

if someone tries to fly-kick you, try to grab their leg (and not get hit).
once you have ahold of a leg, the world is your oyster (in terms of the fight
anyway). there's always the infamous wrestling "dragon screw". or you can
raise the leg and bring your elbow down on the front of the thigh at the same
time. or always just raise the leg up and backwards and sweep the other,
before promptly applying some sort of submission lock.

(know your opponents weaknesses)
it's important to try and discover the weaknesses of your oponent. this is
crucial to if you want to win the fight. for example, if your opponent has a
large forhead, buck teeth, and a nose that has several lumps - then any attack
to the head probably isn't going to do much good.

try to figure out what will work and what won't. if you're fat, and your
opponent is small, chances are they'll be quicker than you. your surprise
attacks are going to have to be VERY crafty to make them work.

(wrestling moves)
now we've mentioned quite a few wrestling moves in this text. obviously -
wrestling is fake. any moron knows that. some - i repeat SOME - of the moves
can be used in real life ass kicking though. but not all. for example, some
moves you might want to avoid are:

  o  the people's elbow
  o  the five star frog splash
  o  shake rattle and roll
  o  stink faces

among others. use common sense - if it's a flashy move, it probably won't do
all that much. unless your confident in it's execution, don't use it.

(foreign objects and weapons)
think very carefully before using foreign objects as weapons. smacking your 
opponent in the head with a chair could kill him - so like i said, think very
carefully.

furthermore, when it comes to chickening out and using knives and shit
(pussies do this in my opinion) remember this: if you're going to carry a
knife, be prepared to be stabbed and die. if you're going to carry a gun, be
prepared to get shot.

(getting away with it)
this is probably the most challenging part of all. getting away with it. for
example, your opponent is laying in a bloody mess on the floor and the police
or some teachers are heading your way in riot gear. how the fuck do you get
out of this one?

well you could try ass-kicking your way out of it, but i really don't like
your chances of that one (especially with riot gear in the equation). if it's
the police, you could start laying grounds for an insanity plea by yelling
obscenities, barking at onlookers, and trying to lick your ears.

if it's the teachers, immediately yell "he started it, i finished it!" or
even better "he tripped! go get the nurse quick!". i dunno these are some
lame ideas, but i've had a rather limited fighting experience and i've only
ever been caught once and i got my ass beat and didn't lay a finger on the
guy so i didn't get in trouble.

(repeat WARNING)
this is somewhat a gag text. if you go and get your ass beat - or worse -
kill someone, then that's your own stupid fault for actually putting what you
read in this magazine into practice. you've been warned - i won't take
responsibility for any misfortune which might result from you reading this
text.

Dance Dance Revolution 
----------------------
by: kleptic <kleptic@grex.org>


Every Friday and Saturday night in Japan, thousands of people of every age
flock to video game arcades, and gather around a certain huge, goofy looking
machine called Dance Dance Revolution. It has been titled "karaoke for the
feet" by some, and I feel this is a pretty accurate description. The basic
premise is this: You, and a partner if you wish, stand on a metal platform
with foot-sized buttons pointing up, down, left, and right. You select a song
from a huge list of ultra-cheesy dance tracks, and the song begins to play.
As it plays, arrows flow up from the bottom of the screen, directing you what
buttons to step on at what time. The better you keep the beat of the song, the
better you will score. Simple premise? I suppose. Addictive as crack?
Definitely. (Not that I would know, of course. I have never smoked crack. I
would never smoke a drug named after a part of my body that I never get to
see.)

I first encountered the game at Cedar Point (yes, on the wave pool trip). I
spotted it, thought I'd try it, and put in my money. Not realizing there were
difficulty ratings, I picked a song at random. I think I picked a Marvelous
track, which, for you non-DDR players, means "not for DDR virgins." I was
quickly shut down in a matter of seconds, and took off to shoot some
dinosaurs with my friend Dave. We done shot them dinosaurs good, too.

I wandered by the game again after a few riveting rounds of Jurassic Park.
Some guy was playing it, and all of a sudden it made sense. I watched his
feet as he demonstrated the "step back to the middle to keep time" technique
(which I later learned is about the worst thing you can do). As soon as he
was done, I was back up there. I picked the first song, glanced around
nervously, and proceeded to get a C rating. I played again. And again.
Compulsively, I poured quarter after quarter into the machine. I was
sweating. Damn, out of quarters. I ran to the quarter changer, and returned
to find someone in my place.

This guy was good. He had style. He actually made it look like dancing. I was
in awe. A huge crowd gathered to watch. After a few games, he took a bow and
ran off. The crowd stayed, to see what young star would emerge to follow him
up. Nobody did. I really wanted to play, but didn't want to follow up the
pro. Finally, my desire to play won over my desire to not look stupid, so up
I went. I picked a medium difficulty song, and performed pretty well. Some of
the crowd stayed. Some clapped. I was hooked.

I continued to pump money into that game until I almost passed out. I felt
horrible the rest of the day, but it was worth it. I discovered a way to
combine my love for video games with my dire need of exercise. Unfortunately,
there are only fourteen of the machines in Michigan (as told by ddrfreak.com)
and they are all downstate. Never one to be beaten so easily, I decided to
take drastic measures.

Email one: Bill Gates. I'm a starving computer science student who needs a
little exercise! Help me Bill! Long shot, even longer considering his email
address changed so he didn't get it to begin with.

Email two: Nick Nolte. Pat told me Nick Nolte had the arcade game for medical
reasons. Hmmm... hey Nick, old buddy. When you get sick of your DDR machine,
will you send it to this address? I'll pay shipping. By the way, I loved you
in that one movie. Yeah. Well, there's five Nick Noltes in America, and I
didn't feel like writing them all.

Email three: RedOctane.com. I broke down and bought the home version. It's not
quite as cool, but it's still DDR and that's not crap. The soft pads suck on
carpet. I haven't tried it on a hard floor yet. If you're going to buy it, get
the nice $100 hard pad. Or two. Or the arcade machine, Richie Rich. Ed. After
playing a while, I've decided I much prefer the soft pads, especially the
modified RedOctane ones. They are much more responsive and quick, and nicer
on your feet.

Play this game.
Play this game.
Play this game.

There, now that you want to play this game, go to DDRfreak.com and read
everything, and download the movies, especially this one and this one.
They're both tournament performances to the song Boom Boom Dollar. Boom Boom
Dollar is THE best DDR song. If you feel differently, then please email me
your address so I can come box your ears. Most importantly, find the game and
play it!
Hot tip: Stretch your calf muscles after playing so you don't get chunky
cheerleader calves, baby.

Online Banking Security Measures
================================
By:  Timeless


We live in the age of convenience. The Internet has warped time and space on
our tiny little confused planet (minds).

Entire projects are being developed in "Internet time" (1 year in human time
equals about 3 months in Internet time). However, perfection comes from the
ability of a human to be able to take the time to refine his own thoughts. To
quantify and to clarify and then to express and manifest. Internet time cuts
the refinement short, if we're humble enough to shun our own egos for a minute
we will see that we're not making perfection anymore. Yes, perfection - things
like carving hundreds and thousands of stones to make perfect cathedrals filled
with statues. Taking a life time to build something, like a pyramid.

So, anyway, humans decided to do some banking online because we're all to busy
making imperfection to actually go to the bank anymore. I like online banking.
In fact it's the only way I can get any banking done! Naturally, most people
choose their online banking provider based on how much they like the company
logo. Some people rate the online banking facilities based on how much they'd
trust it.

People have been working extremely hard to get online banking just right. I
mean hey, if that padlock in your browser window appears then it must be safe,
right? Yeah, right.

Well, much more goes into secure online banking. Allow me to elaborate on some
of the features we have implemented in Internet time!

Non-repudiation
===============
You already have a bank account, meaning the bank know who you are and where
you live. You want online banking, so you have to approach your bank with your
desires. That's part of the process which stops you posing as someone else.
They look at you, your ID, your photo, they smile, you sign something, they
compare your signature biometrically. Everyone's happy. You are in fact Joe
Bloggs. They send your membership information to your home address. If you
receive it then you didn't lie about your address. You also had to produce a
phone bill to prove you're the person who lives at that address. You then use
that piece of membership information along with some other knowledge that was
not included in the letter so that if anyone had picked up the letter it would
not be enough information to get into your account on the web. So when you log
on, it's the final step in a huge chain of events that go to prove that you,
Joe Bloggs, are who you claim to be. Non-repudiation means you can't deny that
you were the one, because there is too much evidence to prove that it was you.

Passwords
=========
Well, you've received your membership number and logon info in the post (that
paper stuff that feels crinkly or hard, and it cuts like Jason on Friday night
if you mess with it). It's time to do some banking! (did I just use the words
"Jason" and "banking" in the same paragraph? hehehe) Well they've talked to
people like me before, and they know you're going to need more non-repudiation
stuff than that. So they make you type in a pin code, password and your
granny's aunty's cat's pet food maker's street name. All good ideas. But
there's a bit of refinement missing here.

Enter the key logger. A key logger is usually a trojan (piece of software) or a
keyboard buffer (piece of hardware) that records your keypresses. If you're
unfortunate enough to have one of these in place without your knowledge then
absolutely everything above can be stolen from you and used by someone else
posing as you (yes, by some brave hacker from a call box in an empty field, in
the country, using a laptop, bouncing off about 60 billion open proxies on the
'Net).

So the banking crew made up anti-keylogging techniques. Like, asking for
letters 3 and 9 of your secret word (or any two random letters, different
combinations each time). This stops the chance logger from being able to
discover your entire secret word, and unless he is a guru hangman player, this
should thwarte a majority of attempts. However, if you're logged often enough,
eventually all the letters can be pieced together and the secret word can be
derived.

Enter the mouse! Okay, so the only sensible way to get around that little quirk
in our dream of perfection is to start using other devices, like the mouse. Use
the mouse to click on the buttons to type the secret word/pin number in. This
usually stops the keyloggers in their tracks. Nice work banking boys!

Oh dear, but all this is futile if we can simply see the packets of clear text
data whizzing by on the network. So the bank boys liked the idea of encrypting
the communications. This is where Secure Sockets Layer comes into it (yeah,
only now do they put a padlock on your web browser, hehe). Fairly good stuff,
hard to crack if you don't have the financial power to buy the computing power
to break the encryption power.

Okay, now things are looking pretty tight. Or are they? Enter subclassing or
hooking. Using these methods a trojan can watch what processes say to eachother
within a computer. If they knew what to look for they could pick out mouse
clicks, the captions of the buttons that the mouse clicked on, the keys that
were pressed, the password being sent from one object to another. This detail
could then be sent to another computer (where the hacker is) and he can simply
resume your web session without your knowledge. *sigh* perfection, we strive,
but always fail...

This is when the bank boys introduce "serialized browsing". You can't press
Back anymore. Each page has a serial number which must match what the server
expects to get next. If anyone else simultaneously uses the session then one of
the serial numbers becomes immediately invalid, and therefore the server will
cancel the whole session and alert the security boys ASAP.

Nice work! Utopia! Um, no wait a minute...

Some dude hacks into the web server via some recently-published web server
exploit. Manages to download the code that does the business! Passwords
included!!! Okay, no sweat, the boys at the bank will have now covered this
scenario. Simply by using a tiered model of programming. You can basically
steal the web side stuff and it doesn't help you one bit because the business
tier is what you really want to get at. The business tier uses different
security to that of the client tier (I use the word "client" loosely here
because it's the "web server tier" that gets connected to by your web browser -
I know there's a word for this, but I can't recall it right now). Even if you
can interface the business tier you still need to access the data tier which is
a further level abstracted from you.

I have left out tons more stuff, but it's late and I'm sobering up.

To sum it all up: obfuscation!

To seek perfection is to seek truth. Hiding things does not bring out the
truth. Security prevents perfection - even if we can do it faster than ever
before.

My Thoughts on Time 


It's late. Can't sleep. Incessant roar of machinery in my head churning out
thought after thought keeping me awake. Must empty mind. Sleep then. Yes, let
it spill. Commencing... 

Time is the passing of events. The only way time could cease to pass is if
nothing changed for a moment. NOTHING changed. If a single electron still
moved, time would not have stood still. Not just on Earth either. Absolute
zero would have to instantly envelope the entire universe. At this point, time
would stop completely forever. Since nothing could become active, there could
be no event to trigger the reactivation of the universe, of energy, of time. 

Some stories contain situations where time stops for everyone but one person
who is then free to run amok. This is not true time stoppage. As long as
something, somewhere is changing, time goes on. 

Maybe the amount of time passing is not steady, like the nature of clocks and 
seconds would suggest. Maybe it is relative to how much is occurring at any
one moment, at the same times. The less that is happening, the less time has
passed. I mean, if nothing has changed, how do we define the moment? 

The only way to travel backwards in time would be to reset every particle
back to the exact same position and condition as a previous moment, in the
entire universe. If even one particle was different, we would have failed;
instead we would have pushed even farther into the future, and our attempted
resetting of the universe would be the new past. It would be useless to go
into the past anyway, because the atoms would act in exactly the same way the
second time. Actually, this is questionable, as there is a certain amount of
randomness to thoughts, reactions, etc. 

To travel into the future, we would have to instantly move every molecule in
the entire universe into a new position. Because of this we would have to
completely design the future situation, allocating a space for every particle.
"Traveling" to the future would be more of a massive engineering feat than an
exploratory voyage. More the product of a hammer and nails than a telescope or
a sailboat. In effect, were it possible to shape the universe in such a way
and assuming we had the unrestricted knowledge and power of a supreme being,
we could redesign the entire universe from scratch, the only remaining rules
being those that are an essential part of the way atoms behave. 

Maybe it's just the insomnia talking.

		PUT THE WORDS IN HERE:

         hello, i'm fwaggle mcclure.. you may remember me from such
         underground publications as "the discordant opposition journal"
         and "fwaggledotnet". 

         well... here we are, with a special valentine's day edition of
         outbreak magazine. awww it's a kodak moment!

         now before you start to reach for the 2x4 to slap me around
         like a pit bull, don't worry about it. this SHOULD have been
         released a lot earlier, but as always seems to happen with
         me - real life gets in the way. i apologize if this sounds
         like absolute shit, but i'm dog tired :)

         outbreak is starting to move along nicely, i have to say. it
         actually had a decent ammount of content for only a month.
         i think once it matures and develops a little, it'll be a
         really stylish and amazing magazine. i just hope it makes it
         that far. keep your articles coming in, and hey - do me a
         fuckin favour. when you go to write something, type 10 -'s
         at the top of the page, and then copy and paste it 7 times.

         then, make sure you wrap your text to EXACTLY this wide. it
         makes my job an awful lot easier, and like it or not there
         are actually people who use 80 column displays still and
         it takes me an extensive ammount of time to re-wrap
         everything. :)

         hope you enjoyed the zine, and maybe i'll see you again 
         in outbreak #3...
