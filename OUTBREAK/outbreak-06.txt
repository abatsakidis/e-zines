Outbreak Magazine Issue #6
June 2002 Release

     
               "I am Russian Nazi, I shave my head for nazi-ness!"   

 			      - Boris Shlagnavich
     



     Editorial:

     It was a stormy day on May 29th, 2002. I was awaken by a lound 
     bang. I thought it was thunder. But I mistaken... It was my 
     roomate masturbating. Ya see, he's a loud masturbater. When he's
     getting his wank on, its explosive. Snails in Canada can hear it. 
     True fact. 

     When hes getting his wank on, he can launch a space ship, and make 
     it propell all the way to Uranus. Who's anus? Uranus. Not Mianus. 
     Uranus.

     Anyway, i've got nothing else to write. So when you think its 
     thundering outside.. It's really not. It's my roomate Phil 
     masturbating. It really is.

     ANYWAY!

| Setting up a Conference |
| By: gr3p                |
| http://www.gr3p.net     |
+\=/=\=/=\=/=\=/=\=/=\=/=\+

In this text file you will learn how to setup different types of 
teleconferences.  However, this file will not discuss bullshit features or 
menus that you could learn on your own ;)

I. Choosing a Provider

There are literally tons of companies that offer audio conferencing.  Such 
as Att, Sprint, Qwest, j2, Raindance, Ilink, Verizon, Conference Center, 
and even Eintercall.  There is a cupple of free ones out there two but they
will not set up an 800 number for you ;/

II. Frauding the Provider

A. Att
Good ole leet ATnTs.  You can either set these up by beiging or by credit 
card. To set them up by credit card go to 
http://www.att.com/conferencing/restools/index.html. To set them up by 
beiging get a dial tone. Then dial an ANAC to get the ANI and write it down.
Now call 800-232-1234 and setup a conference. It would typically be like this:

*call ANAC* *hang up* *write down number* *call 800-232-1234*
Operator: Hello at&t teleconference services this is sherry how may I help you?
You: Hi I would like to setup a teleconference.
Operator: Can I have your conference folder id?
You: Im sorry I do not have one of those this is my first time calling.
Operator: Oh, well then lets setup a folder.
Operator: What is you name?
You: My name is Mr. Lar Lar.
Operator: And what is you fone number?
You: My fone number is 123-123-1234(you know the ANI from the ANAC earlier).
Operator: What is your address?
You: I live on 1234 Phreak Lane in Columbus Indiana. My zip is 12345.
Operator: Ok is this gonna be a operator dialed or a dial in conference?
You: Dial in please.
Operator: How many people including yourself are gonna be calling in?
You: 4 but I would like to have auto port expansion on.
Operator: How long will the call last?
You: Uhm... about 5 hours..
Operator: Alright I have a 4 port conference for 5 hours with auto port 
expansion on.  I will call you back shortly to verify billing.
You: Ok bye.
*hang up* *wait* *wait* *ring* *ring* *pick up*
You: Hello?
Operator: Hi is Mr. Lar Lar there?
You: Yes your speaking to him.
Operator: Well this is at&t you conference dial in number is 800-123-1234. Your 
moderator code is 123456 and your participant code is 123455.
*write that down*
You: Ok thanks a lot!
Operator: Alright would you like a confirmation emailed or faxed to you?
You: No thanks.
Operator: Ok that is it.
You: Alright bye.
*grins* *hangs up the fone* *runs home to drop conf infro on irc*

They also have a java based (I _hate_ java) conference manager where you can 
dial out, mute, and kick people at http://www.att.com/conferencemanager/.  

B. Verizon
A new service by verizon just came out its called verizon conference 
connections.  These stay up for a long time and when you have quick start on
you can use them as a voice bridge. Just have your friends dial in whenever.
You can set these up by a credit card at 
http://www22.verizon.com/conferenceconnections/html/home.html.  Supposedly 
you can also beige these but I have never done it.  The dial in numbers for
verizon are 8664412942 and 9727172043.  The only big downside to this is 
canucks can not dial into the toll free number.

C. Conference Center
"Welcome to the conference center. Please enter your passcode followed by the
pound sign," said the hot automated operator.  I have heard that more then a
million times.  Anyways these are mad easy to crack just dial 800-260-7078 
or 800-930-9525.  They are six digit pins just keep trying.  You will have a 
ton of these in no time.  Except the company has been ripped off so much lately
they even have a operator monitoring at night so these get shut down fast.

D. Raindance
These are awesome but a little harder to get.  With a credit card you can get 
one at http://www.raindaince.com.  It has a really nice web panel that even 
shows your ANI.  The reason they are a little harder to get is because they 
have a screwy way of validating credit cards.  Even the valid ones get turned
down a lot.  Another thing is never try signing up with an anonymous email 
because you will get the same error as you would if your card was declined.

E. Eintercall or Intercall
These are the same thing except one is a web conference the other is an audio
conference.  These are very similar to the Raindances.  They seem to last 
longer too.  You can set these up on the fone by dialing 800-374-2441 and 
telling them you want to setup a reservation-less plus conference.  You will 
need to have a fone line that you can sit by all day that will not lead back 
to you. Why you ask? Because they will want to call you back :(

F. Sprint and Qwest
Sprint and Qwest are two very nice companies that offer teleconferencing. 
You can set these up at  http://www.sprint.com and http://www.qwest.com.  To
set these up you will find a form on there site where you request an audio 
conference.  They will eventually call you back and setup an account with you.
That is a major pain in the ass but its worth it.  Be on a look out for more 
promotional accounts from sprint those were mad fun.

G. Ilink
I do not why im mentioning this company because if  you do not know how to set
these up then you probably will not find out.  The URL to set these up is kept
a secret.  Either way this is worth mentioning cause it's a great voice over
IP conference service.  They give you an 800 number that has an ANI logging 
voice mail and an option to find the moderator.  One neat thing is the moderator
can forward people that dial in to different number or just not let the person
in at all. :)

H. j2
The only conference service I know of that has no dial in.  You _must_ use the
web panel for this to dial out to you and all your parties.  It's a pain in 
the ass but neat.  They also give you a fax and voice mail number.  They will 
however shut these down for over usage.  Can set these up with a credit card at 
http://www.j2.com.

These were just examples of how to setup a conference with a few of the many
companies out there.  The principal is all the same though.  You either bill 
them to a fone line, card them, or crack them.  Another way is steal a companies
account and set one up but that does not happen very often. 

III. Dialing in the Conference
If your such a dumb shit that you do not understand this section then do us a 
favor and unplug your internet connection.

Btw I wanted to add Att conferences are _not_ to be confused with alliance.  
Also alliance is pretty much dead and outdated so I did not put infro on it 
in this file.

The History And Application Of TELETEXT

Written by GPC
On 14:54 21/04/02

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 You may ask yourself, why is GPC doing an article on TELETEXT and more
importantly, who is GPC? To answer the latter I am GPC (duh!) or Geldoff's
Poor Cousin. Anyway, I'm writing an article on TELETEXT because it was really 
the first time that technology and the media were fully integrated but also 
cos I happen to think that TELETEXT is quite dope :D.


Frequently asked TELETEXT (hense forth abbreviated to TT) questions:

1. What is TT?
Well if u live outside Europe, chances are you'll never have heard of TT.
This is cos for sum reason TT never really took off in America, and every1
else in the world does what America does (apart from Europe :P). But
politics aside, TT is a 'data carousel' (more about that later) text
information service that holds information in a linear ASCII format. It has 
info on things such as TV listings and sports news. Teletext also has 
subtitles (known as 'closed captions' in the US) and can display half on,
half off (its difficult to describe).

2. How does it work?
The actual teletext pages are broadcast in a hidden part of the television
signal (the Vertical Blanking Interval), and decoded by the television.
Teletext pages are accessed by a 3-figure number; on most channels, the
front page is on page 100.

3. Why isn't it instantaneous?
Many people ask this, as, after all, the information is just text and in
some cases it can take minutes to load. This is because when u select a
page, say 456, theres no way of telling the TT provider what page u have
asked for because analogue TV is only one way. So instead, the pages go
around on a 'data carousel' and this carousel will only stop at the page u
request. This way there is no user to provider link needed.

4. Isn't TT crap tho?
Well yes and no. Its not graphical apart from where ASCII is used to convey
images. It is, however, extremely helpful for txt services and it requires
no special equipment, technical knowledge or encur call costs. For these
reasons over 22 million people use teletext in one week.

5. Why cant the TV just cache the pages?
This is cos nearly all TVs dont have a cache, let alone the programming to
cache pages automatically. Plus there is a chance of blue screen moments of
death when the info in the cache clashes with ne updated info on the page.
But, if you have a TV card on ur box ur comp can cache it.


Digital TELETEXT

 Digital television has 'digital teletext'. Despite the name, the only 
thing common to 'analogue' teletext is the fact that the viewer looks at 
information on the TV screen. The methods used to broadcast and decode it, 
as well as the way it looks, are much removed.  Some channels on 
SkyDigital, the UK's digital satellite operator, carry analogue teletext 
despite the promise of digital teletext. Sky's own-brand channels carry an 
expanded version of SkyText, although it directs viewers to the Sky 
Electronic Programme Guide instead of carrying TV listings.  Channels on 
the UK's digital terrestrial channels don't carry analogue teletext. This 
was due to a decision by The Digital Television Group (DTG), who decided 
that such things were unnecessary. In the long term, this is probably 
true.  Teletext Ltd. will be provides a service on channel 9 of digital 
terrestrial television with the BBC Text on channel 10.  To complicate 
things for the providers of digital teletext, the systems opted for by Sky 
and DTG are different. Whilst DTG decided to use MHEG-5, which is an ISO 
standard, Sky decided on OpenTV. OpenTV is a proprietary 'solution for 
digital interactive receivers'. Teletext has a demo of Digital Teletext on 
their web site; the BBC also has some information on their digital site and 
in a paper (in PDF format).

Recoding TELETEXT

 Direct recording of TT is quite difficult but it is possible to decode the
old text pages from old S-VHS video tapes that also recorded the vertical
blanking interval.


Thats it every1, I hope this has opened ur eyes. Next time ur waiting for
the page u want to come round on the loop try to appreciate how amazing it
is :D

Internet Security Myths 
by fwaggle | Oct 25 '00 (a bit outdated. but still good)
<root@fwaggle.net>
http://www.fwaggle.net

* note: epinions.com sucks because they owe me $40
--------------------------------------------------------


I can't stress some of the points I'm about to make enough, because surprisingly 
a lot of people panic when it comes to internet security. First of all, there are 
these evil people called "hackers" which are lurking around every little corner 
waiting to break into your computer.

First things first, I find it somewhat offensive that people even use the 
term hacker any more. I mean, the term hacker in the 80s referred to a very 
small and elitist group of people. These were people who learnt entire computer 
systems, and how to program them, and exploit security features... Without any 
documentation or help files... Simply from dialling into a stolen dial-up, and 
experimenting. A very talented group of individuals...

Nowadays, you have any 12 year old geek with some of the latest "toolz" is now 
a "hacker". Would you appreciate spending a decade of your life learning and 
improving yourself, only to see in another decade, a stupid 12 year old hot-shot 
categorized in the same place as you?

It may be the same outcome - someone's computer getting invaded in some way, 
but it still kind of ticks me off.

Which brings us back to people's fear. All you need is some technical knowledge 
(not a lot, just a basic grasp of a few concepts), and some common sense, and 
you can be reasonably safe without spending a cent on software.

Firstly understand that to break into a computer, it must have a service which
you can exploit. Windows machines (the kind you're probably using to connect 
to the internet now) usually have one service nad one service only. This is 
called NetBIOS. 

NetBIOS can be exploited with what's called an OOB Nuke. This is old hat, 
anything over Windows 98a is immune to this.

There are ways to prevent your computer from even listening to NetBIOS on 
the internet. If you read up on how to do this (and have a friend port-scan 
you and it shows up empty), then there is no concievable way you could be 
"hacked".

Unless, with the lack of services some pimply geek decides to create a service 
of his own. This is what's known as a "trojan horse". Well known trojan horses 
are (you may have heard of these):

Back Orifice
NetBus
SubSeven
Master's Paradise

How do these get onto your computer? Exactly like a virus. You have to run a 
program which contains one. Which brings us to common sense. NEVER run programs
from sources you don't trust. You can set up email filters to block files which 
end in .exe and so on.

Remember things like file extensions. Pictures end in .bmp, .gif, .jpg, and that's
about it. If it ENDS in anything else, don't download it.

If you run an email client such as Outlook Express, then disable Javascript in 
Email. You don't need it, and it can be used for malicious purposes. If you use
Outlook, get the patches or disable Word Macros to prevent viruses such as 
Melissa from entering your system.

As you can see, with a little common sense there really isn't much to be worried 
about. If you can get a shell account who will give you permission to run a port 
scanner, investigate the possibility of doing so (do it quick before the stupid 
government makes it illegal).

If nothing shows up on the port scans, then there are no security holes. Therefore,
no need for Firewalls. If you don't accept files from other people, then there is no
way for a virus to enter your machine. Therefore, no real need for anti-virus software 
(although it's probably a good idea anyway).

In my opinion, it's probably better to clean up your system yourself, armed with 
some technical knowledge, rather than paying money from security software which 
is only as good as the person who installs it anyway.

One final note, it's of great importance that if you have children, you 
educate them in the dangers of accepting files from other people (even their
friends, you never know when one of their friends will experiment, leaving you 
open to attacks from more experienced losers). If in doubt, set programs such 
as ICQ to ignore file transfer requests (you can do this in the preferances 
under events), and Email programs to automatically dump attachments with programs 
in them.

Thanks for listening.

What the fuck was I smoking?
----------------------------
By: kleptic <drklep@roy.phonelosers.org>

At the chime of 12:00 pm I was awaken by a midget wearing sandals and suspenders. 
He claimed his name was Blasko but I found that hard to believe. Ya see, he had 
that sort of suspicious glare in his eyes that made me think that one of two 
things have just occured. He either just got some mad midget lovin', or he killed 
a man. Well, I wasn't one to ask questions. So I got out of bed and strolled to 
the bathroom (the water closet if you're british) and proceeded to urinate in 
the "John."

After I releived myself I then went to my basement where I work. Ya see, I don't
have your average job. Most people work in offices, or at resturants, or fast food 
joints. Ya see, I donate sperm to the homeless (hey, vagrants need some sperm to,
ya bum!). Anyway, after hours of HARD work. I then took a journy up stairs to find 
something to eat. There I found Mr. Blasko digging in my fridge. So I was like, 
"Hey Blasko, what are you doing!?" And he was like, "I'm looking for something to eat."
And then I was like, "Hey what time is it?" And then he was like, "It's 3:00 pm." And 
then I was all like, "No you're wrong........ IT'S FACE PUNCHING TIME!" 

So I proceeded to punch Blasko in the face. Ya see, when it's face punching... faces 
just gots ta get punched.

So After hours of pummeling Blasko, I opened my fridge to see what was there to eat. 
To my suprise, I found nothing but a tube of cookie dough. So I made cookies for dinner. 
That's right.... let me say it again for those that didn't catch what I just wrote... 
COOKIES.... FOR... DINNER!!

What kind of chronic masturbator, manic depressive, butt monkey, would eat cookies for dinner?? 

Well, all signs point to me. Thats who!

Anyway, this story is going no where. I forgot what the moral was supposed to be. But maybe it's.. 
When a Midget wearing sandals and suspenders named Blasko is eating your hard earned food. 
You punch them in the face. That's right.... in the fucking face.

How to get an 800 # for a local BBS

By:  Turbanator

Ok first go to the drug store and open up a magazine
from the magazine rack.  Pull out a subscription card
and keep it for the address listed for the magazine
company.  Now get the number of the local AT&T
or Verizon office in your area and note it down.

Now go to your handy-dandy yellow pages and pick
out a technical type business, one not to small, and not
as big as Micro$oft.  Write down the name of the company.

Next go to a payphone or op divert to spoof your ANI,
and dial 1-800-222-0400.  When you call up tell the nice
op that you want to get an 800 number, and save time
by telling them that you want the 'Readyline Service'.
When they ask you for your name, just make up one,
or use one of the person you hate most. When asked for
the name of the company, give them the name of the
place you pulled out of the phonebook.When asked for
the billing address, give them the P.O. BOX of the address
of the company on the card u pulled from the magazine.
When they ask about a service address, give em the address
of your local AT&T or Verizon office.They'll ask for the
number you want it to route to, that would obviously
be the BBS #.  For you contact number, just give em
one that doesnt answer, or is constantly busy.

If they ask for credit info, just make up the companys
name and the presidents name.  When asked when
started, say anything after 1980, since most somewhat newer
companys are likely to set up an 800 #.  If they ask for
annual sales, just say something about $160,000.

Once all that is complete as to have the number assigned
while your on the phone, and say you need the line ASAP.
Not too long from then it should be up an routing the selected
BBS #.  This also works for dial-up access numbers, and even
normal phone numbers.  Doing all this will ensure that you
get an 800 number you want, while having the monopoly
companys, AT&T and/or Verizon, paying for the number.

-= Getting an IP address through AIM =-

Easy trick that you might already know...
Say you hate someone and know they got an AIM name... get a fake one....
chat with them a bit and get them to accept a direct connection with you to 
show them pics of your car or yourself anything will do to get them to accept a direct 
connection..

What most people dont know is that when your "directly connected "
Your IP's are as well... so once connected, pop open a command prompt and 
type "netstat" you should see some address along with the port number 4443
Just do a NSlookup on that address or for the simple minded folk / go in to 
IRC and type /dns guy.address.com (replace that with his address)
And there ya go... now you got his IP and if you want to be naughty and 
especially if the tard dosent have a firewall up, you can be :)

                     --=Brief Thoughts on Terror in the U.S.=--

                                  -By TheEnigma-



With the growing popularity of suicide bombings and other terrorist activities 
I decided I would let you know what some of my thoughts are on the subject.

The recent attacks on American civilians curtailed drastically if not 
completely when we launched a military attack against the government sponsor 
of that terrorism. I now feel the real shit is yet to come (not that the events of 
9/11 were not real).

Americans were targeted by Arabic Terrorists back in the seventies and 
eighties and we lived through it. Now it is 2002 and we must once again accept the 
fact that we are the primary targets of homicide bombers, hijacked aircraft, and 
god knows what else.

Israel has been dealing with this for years, and recently they have not done 
a thing to really stop terrorism. They go blasting up Palestinian villages, 
which is great for Sharon's ratings because it makes it appear that he's doing
something. But the reports say that foreign governments are sending the supplies
in to the terrorists, yet there are no reprisals against the foreign 
governments. Also, reportedly wealthy Arabs are offering financial rewards to
suicide bombers'surviving family members. Uh...can anyone say "special ops 
teams should eliminate said wealthy Arabs"? Special ops teams don't play well 
on the evening news. Remember that our guys were in Afghanistan on day three, 
but it wasn't reported for months.

I think that, should further suicide attacks or any other form of terrorism 
visit the United States, we would visit upon supporters of suicide bombers the
principle that "payback is a bitch".

As far as defending against suicide bombers, there's an old military axiom:
"he who defends everything defends nothing". Do you think that, if detecting
suicide bombers was a simple matter of getting some dogs, maybe Israel would
have thought of that by now?

Isn't "Qaeda" Arabic for "Gore"?

Scary, huh?

=================================================================

This is a starter kit for those that are new and are very curious

=================================================================


Can't sleep.. bored? I have just the thing for all you wannabes....That is if your running 
windows. First were going to d/l a few tools.

 1. A damn good scanner........ http://packetstormsecurity.org/NT/scanners/superscan.zip. 
Don't let the NT bother you it works on your winderz machine. .....you can set the ports you want 
to scan from just one or two to all. Write your own .lst....VERY handy.

 2. A browser that sends commands to port 80........http://www.astalavistalab.com/files/cgis4.zip.
You know all those CGI exploits you hear about. Well this app has all thats known for now and 
you can ad new ones as there found.
 
 3. A app that uses a file to find passwds and logins on a passwd protected site.......
http://www.astalavistalab.com/files/webhammerb.zip. Just get you a dictionary file and get after it.

 Now I'm not going to tell you how to use these tools......You need to d/l them and play around
with them. It's my hope that in doing that you will start to see the wonders that can be done with
that windows machine that so many ppl think you can't hack with. If you have questions AFTER 
learning these tools....drop by #hackerzlair on dalnet and ask what you need to know. The ppl 
there are always happy to help if you just need a little push in the right direction.
But don't ask me...... " I know nothing"

This article is for edicational purposes only. If you're actually stupid
enough to make an atomic bomb, then you should get punched in the face.
Outbreak Magazine or The Enigma is not held liable for your stupidity.
Read this article, learn about The Atomic Bomb and how it works. But 
if you make one, and if you fuck yourself up and others.  Then thats your
own god damn fault.

The following is part of a research paper I wrote.


On August 2nd 1939, just before the beginning of World War II, Albert 
Einstein wrote to then President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Einstein and several 
other scientists told Roosevelt of efforts in Nazi Germany to purify U-235 
with which might in turn be used to build an atomic bomb. It was shortly 
thereafter that the United States Government began the serious undertaking 
known only then as the Manhattan Project. Simply put, the Manhattan Project 
was committed to expedient research and production that would produce a 
viable atomic bomb.

The most complicated issue to be addressed was the production of ample 
amounts of `enriched' uranium to sustain a chain reaction. At the time, 
Uranium-235 was very hard to extract. In fact, the ratio of conversion 
from Uranium ore to Uranium metal is 500:1. An additional drawback is that 
the 1 part of Uranium that is finally refined from the ore consists of over 
99% Uranium-238, which is practically useless for an atomic bomb. To make it
even more difficult, U-235 and U-238 are precisely similar in their chemical 
makeup. This proved to be as much of a challenge as separating a solution of 
sucrose from a solution of glucose. No ordinary chemical extraction could 
separate the two isotopes. Only mechanical methods could effectively separate
U-235 from U-238. Several scientists at Columbia University managed to solve 
this dilemma.

A massive enrichment laboratory/plant was constructed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. 
H.C. Urey, along with his associates and colleagues at Columbia University,
devised a system that worked on the principle of gaseous diffusion. 
Following this process, Ernest O. Lawrence (inventor of the Cyclotron) at the 
University of California in Berkeley implemented a process involving magnetic
separation of the two isotopes.

Following the first two processes, a gas centrifuge was used to further 
separate the lighter U-235 from the heavier non-fissionable U-238 by their mass. 
Once all of these procedures had been completed, all that needed to be done was to 
put to the test the entire concept behind atomic fission.

Over the course of six years, ranging from 1939 to 1945, more than 2 billion
dollars were spent on the Manhattan Project. The formulas for refining 
Uranium and putting together a working bomb were created and seen to their logical 
ends by some of the greatest minds of our time. Among these people who unleashed 
the power of the atomic bomb was J. Robert Oppenheimer.

Oppenheimer was the major force behind the Manhattan Project. He literally 
ran the show and saw to it that all of the great minds working on this project 
made their brainstorms work. He oversaw the entire project from its conception to 
its completion.

Finally the day came when all at Los Alamos would find out whether or not 
The Gadget (code-named as such during its development) was either going to be 
the colossal dud of the century or perhaps end the war. It all came down to a 
fateful morning of midsummer, 1945.

At 5:29:45 (Mountain War Time) on July 16th, 1945, in a white blaze that
stretched from the basin of the Jemez Mountains in northern New Mexico to 
the still-dark skies, The Gadget ushered in the Atomic Age. The light of the 
explosion then turned orange as the atomic fireball began shooting upwards at 
360 feet per second, reddening and pulsing as it cooled. The characteristic 
mushroom cloud of radioactive vapor materialized at 30,000 feet. Beneath the 
cloud, all that remained of the soil at the blast site were fragments of jade 
green radioactive glass. ...All of this caused by the heat of the reaction.

The brilliant light from the detonation pierced the early morning skies with 
such intensity that residents from a faraway neighboring community would swear 
that the sun came up twice that day. Even more astonishing is that a blind girl 
saw the flash 120 miles away.

Upon witnessing the explosion, reactions among the people who created it 
were mixed. Isidor Rabi felt that the equilibrium in nature had been upset -- as 
if humankind had become a threat to the world it inhabited. J. Robert 
Oppenheimer, though ecstatic about the success of the project, quoted a remembered 
fragment from Bhagavad Gita. "I am become Death," he said, "the destroyer of worlds."
Ken Bainbridge, the test director, told Oppenheimer, "Now we're all sons of
bitches."

Several participants, shortly after viewing the results, signed petitions
against loosing the monster they had created, but their protests fell on 
deaf ears. As it later turned out, the Jornada del Muerto of New Mexico was not 
the last site on planet Earth to experience an atomic explosion.

As many know, atomic bombs have been used only twice in warfare. The first 
and foremost blast site of the atomic bomb is Hiroshima. A Uranium bomb (which
weighed in at over 4 & 1/2 tons) nicknamed "Little Boy" was dropped on
Hiroshima August 6th, 1945. The Aioi Bridge, one of 81 bridges connecting 
the seven-branched delta of the Ota River, was the aiming point of the bomb.

Ground Zero was set at 1,980 feet. At 0815 hours, the bomb was dropped from 
the Enola Gay. It missed by only 800 feet. At 0816 hours, in the flash of an 
instant, 66,000 people were killed and 69,000 people were injured by a 10 kiloton 
atomic explosion.

The point of total vaporization from the blast measured one half of a mile 
in diameter. Total destruction ranged at one mile in diameter. Severe blast 
damage carried as far as two miles in diameter. At two and a half miles, everything
flammable in the area burned. The remaining area of the blast zone was 
riddled with serious blazes that stretched out to the final edge at a little over 
three miles in diameter.

On August 9th 1945, Nagasaki fell to the same treatment as Hiroshima. Only 
this time, a Plutonium bomb nicknamed "Fat Man" was dropped on the city. Even 
though the "Fat Man" missed by over a mile and a half, it still leveled nearly half
the city. Nagasaki's population dropped in one split-second from 422,000 to
383,000. 39,000 were killed, over 25,000 were injured. That blast was less 
than 10 kilotons as well. Estimates from physicists who have studied each atomic
explosion state that the bombs that were used had utilized only 1/10th of 1
percent of their respective explosive capabilities.

While the mere explosion from an atomic bomb is deadly enough, its 
destructive ability doesn't stop there. Atomic fallout creates another hazard as well. 
The rain that follows any atomic detonation is laden with radioactive particles.
Many survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki blasts succumbed to radiation
poisoning due to this occurance.

The atomic detonation also has the hidden lethal surprise of affecting the
future generations of those who live through it. Leukemia is among the 
greatest of afflictions that are passed on to the offspring of survivors.

While the main purpose behind the atomic bomb is obvious, there are many by-
products that have been brought into consideration in the use of all weapons
atomic. With one small atomic bomb, a massive area's communications, travel 
and machinery will grind to a dead halt due to the EMP (Electro- Magnetic Pulse)
that is radiated from a high-altitude atomic detonation. These high-level
detonations are hardly lethal, yet they deliver a serious enough EMP to
scramble any and all things electronic ranging from copper wires all the way 
up to a computer's CPU within a 50 mile radius.

At one time, during the early days of The Atomic Age, it was a popular 
notion that one day atomic bombs would one day be used in mining operations and
perhaps aid in the construction of another Panama Canal. Needless to say, it
never came about. Instead, the military applications of atomic destruction
increased. Atomic tests off of the Bikini Atoll and several other sites were
common up until the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was introduced. Photos of 
nuclear test sites here in the United States can be obtained through the Freedom of
Information Act.

--Automatic Number Identification (ANI).  -dropcode. ::o4.o6.2oo2::---.

----------------------------------------------------------------------.
<rip src="www22.verizon.com/wholesale/glossary/">

  --/
  . "The  number  transmitted  through the network that identifies the 
  .  calling   party.   Technically,   a  Common  Channel  Interoffice 
  .  Signaling   (CCIS)   parameter   that  refers   to   the   number  
  .  transmitted  on  an  out-of-band  basis through the SS7 signaling  
  .  network  identifying  the  calling party's telephone number. Also

</rip src="www22.verizon.com/wholesale/glossary/">
----------------------------------------------------------------------.

ANI   is  the  standard  in  CCIS  for  passing  the  originators  CPN 
(telefone  number)  between  LECs. Each individual LEC (local exchange 
carrier,  or  central office) uses an out-of-band signalling method to 
transfer the loop ID and routing codes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------.

I've  yet  to  confirm  whether the original implementation was infact 
split  into  multiple classifications or not, but the 4 classes of ANI
rumoured to have existed in the beginning are as follows:

  Level A: Contained  only  the  NPA (area code) of the calling party.
  Level B: Contained   the   NPA   and  City  of  the  calling  party.
  Level C: Contained  the NPA, City and the calling parties prefix, or 
           switching exchange.
  Level D: La whole anchaloda. NPA-Nxx-xxxx/city.

whether  this is fact or fable, since the implementation of SS7, every 
LEC using the SS7 protocal forwards Level D ANI. A recent developement 
in CLID (Calling Line IDentification),  known as ANI II, makes use  of
a  two  digit  pair  to identify the Class of Service, or type of line 
the caller is using, ie. POTS, COCOT, Payfone, etc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------.

ANI  accross an analog trunk is sent in the form of DTMF/MF signalling 
tones.  Though  the  syntax  varies  slightly  between carriers, it is 
generally similar to: 
	
KP-[NPA]-Nxx-xxxx-i-ST
.---------.-------------.----------------------------.----------------.
|code.....|decode.......|notes.......................|dtmf/mf.........|
'---------'-------------'----------------------------'----------------'
|kp.......|key pulse....|seizes a trunk..............|11khz/17khz.....|
|[npa]....|area code....|long distance calls only....|n/a.............|
|Nxx-xxxx.|loop id......|calling party number, cpn...|n/a.............|
|i........|info digit...|identifies class of service.|n/a.............|
|st.......|start signal.|end of ANI info.............|15khz/17khz.....|
'---------'--------------'---------------------------'----------------'
|..........the information digit is sometimes sent after kp...........|
'---------------------------------------------------------------------'

ANI accross data trunks is sent as the header of a data packet. Due to
sketchy  standards within the SS7 protocal, i was unable to include an
exact diagram of how these packets are formatted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------.

All Wide Area Telephone/Telecom Service, or WATS lines are put through 
a WATS Serving Office (WSO). The WSO has equipment capable of reading/
logging ANI.

----------------------------------------------------------------------.

Operator  assisted  dialing  does  not  always  forward  ANI  with the 
original  CPN.  Often  the equipment used by the TSPS will forward the
call with an ANIF or ANI Fail substituting the originators number.

Enhancements  in  the  Automatic  Intercept  System (or CCI's DAIS II) 
makes  it  possible  for  an  end  office to flag a line generating an 
unusually large amount of ANIFs.

.--  Payphone line fiasco.                       -Coercion. ::o4.o6.2oo2::  
---.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By Coercion

What's up everyone? This is my first text file, although I cannot really call
what I am going to write in the least bit solid or what one would call elite
everything in this text file is purely speculative so bear with it's
inaccuracy if any mistakes are found.

Recently I have gotten interested in payphones and such since, of course they 
are so interesting to look at with their shiney buttons and fake recordings ;)

So anyhow this brings me to the next part of payphones which I can state are
just coin gateways to a semi-normal phone line. With my experience with
payphones now is that bell and all those fatcat companies make the line in 
such a fashion that outgoing calls can be made but incoming calls cannot be 
received which is quite an interesting phenomenon. When it comes to COCOT's 
though we get a carrier tone... but lets not go into that for now.

Knowing this it gives us phreakers a lot of advantages that is if you find a
way of doing what I state below through another method since not all of us 
are fortunate enough for the following circumstances.

What if you have the line of a bocot or even a few bocot's going through the
same  bridging base (green boxens on the road) or dslams (the brown boxens)
as your own phone line, it means that you have a line of which calls being 
made are untracked and secondly cannot be called back except by the op but what's
the chance that out of nowhere a telco operator randomly chooses that bocot 
to call out of all those other thousands. Sure it may happen but your reaction
time in such an emergency will be a lot faster than the local telco company.

The first mistake they made was that it's actually the payphone that is
restricting you from dialing out directly to the line, because of that 
beiging is possible but instead how about just hooking it upto your line or even 
better have it as a second phone line, you have an unrestricted phone line which 
you can scan off of and do any bloody fucking thing you like except in most
instances create conferences.

This then raises the question if you have a dtmf decoder device and a small
amount of equipment it would be easy enough to construct a box to do this:

When you pickup your phone and enter in a code it puts you through to the
payphone line and disconnects the payphone so any passerby who tries to use
the phone will find it "Out of Order". Sure it would be just peachy keen if
I would give you the plans to such a box but wouldn't it be better if you 
build it yourself with your own custom modifications to enable your microwave to 
heat up your butter to drink?

Apart from a dtmf decoder device if you have a ringback number why not have 
a goldbox hooked up in-between your line to the dtmf decoder.

A diagram would be like this:


                    _________<<__________<<____________
     	           |               		      |
  _____________    V  			              ^
|Incoming Line|-> YOUR LINE -->>-- GOLDBOX           |
|____START____|                               DEFAULT/UNSUCCESSFUL CODE
   		                    |                ^
   		                    V                |
   		                DTMF DECODER -->>-- Timer

   		      			            |
   		      			            V

   		      			     SUCCESSFUL CODE

   		      			            |
   		      			            V

   		      			      Payphone line & switch
   		      			      triggered so line on
   		      			      payphone goes dead

As we see above basically before it goes through to your own line you go 
through 2 devices basically the practicality of this setup is much simpler 
than it  seems since the Timer is usually part of the DTMF Decoder device 
which of course can be setup for 3 seconds an amount of time which no one 
feels so its virtually undetectable and if hidden well at the Dslam or 
Bridging Base you should be perfectly fine. So in conclusion Payphone lines
are handy use them to your advantages and most of all use your common sense
I don't like seeing people being caught for stupidity or reasons otherwise.

I realize that this text isn't as thorough as how people would like but
then again working for your shit is always good and most of all you 
basically learn a lot so take care have fun and happy phreaking.

mmmm.... FACE!

Purpose

Have you ever gone beiging and some guy walks up on you and asks you what 
you're doing, well it's happened to me... you usually can jet, but odds are 
he might know you and might see your face, so why don't we get around having 
him even comes close to seeing your face. I have made this box, it's called a 
grey box cause that's the color that it mainly was. This box will buzz if 
someone enters the area you're in. Most censors have a 60ft range. If you're 
willing to open someones TNI and place long distance calls to their line 
then you're probably willing to steal a censor light from someones yard. 
Unless you're pretty tall, you're gonna need a buddy to boost you up and 
some wire snippers to cut the lines going from the censor. Watch out, there 
is 120v going through the power line. This can be potentially deadly. You 
should probably get your friend to stand on a milk crate or a large rubber 
platform... Enough Of This Crap!!!

Materials

Light Censor
Magnet Buzzer
6-12 lantern Battery

b=battery
MB=magnet buzzer

Step By Step

If you're too stupid to figure out the schematic you've got to do this... on 
your censor will be 4 wires, two for your output=light (in this case, magnet 
buzzer) and output DC (in this case, AC). Now wire the DC output to a 12v 
battery and the other 2 to the magnet buzzer. Now you're gonna need a small 
magnet buzzer. Magnet buzzers are those things they use in fire alarm 
systems. The great thing about them is they don't need an amplifier. They're 
just a magnet that spins and creates a low bass tone... You don't want it to 
be too loud...

##   firewall detection, interrogation and penetration. -dropcode   ##
######################################################################

intro.

on  todays  internet  its rare to find a system that isn't behind some
type  of firewall. be it a software based application gateway, a hard-
ware  based  packet filtering or logging gateway, or some type of acd,
firewalls are everywhere.

this  text  will  cover  various techniques to detect firewalls on the
target  network, remotely determine the firewalls rulesets and map out
the internal network through the firewall.

detection.

the  detection  of  a  firewall on a target network is generally quite
simple.  as  the  function  of a firewall is to prohibit certain types
of data from passing beyond itself and into the internal network, they
can  easily  be  discovered  by  monitoring  an orchestrated data flow
between you and a target system.

detection with traceroute.

traceroute  is  a  network  administration  tool  used  to map a route
between you and a destination box. by default it launches a UDP packet
with  a  low  TTL,  or  time  to  live, flag set in the IP header. the
objective  is to force an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED response for every system
on  the  route.  for instance, we start by sending a UDP packet to our
target  host  with  a  TTL of 1, it will reach the first system on the
route and timeout there. that first system will discard the packet and
send  an  ICMP  TIME_EXCEEDED  packet  back  to  you. you'll then send
another  UDP  packet,  but this time the TTL will be set to 2. it will
terminate  on the second system and we'll recieve a TIME_EXCEEDED from
them.  so  on,  et  cetera,  ad nauseum. thats the general idea, to be
technical  the  standard  with traceroute is to send three probes with
the  same  TTL  before  the incrementation. also, every packet is sent
to  one  port higher then the preceeding packet. so, not only does the
TTL increment, but the port does as well.

now,  that  probably  seemed  like i was getting way off track, but as
you'll soon see its all relevant.

 bash-2.05a$ traceroute 0.0.0.8
 traceroute to 0.0.0.8 (0.0.0.8), 64 hops max, 40 byte packets
  1  0.0.0.2 (0.0.0.2)  0.630 ms  0.470 ms  0.413 ms
  2  0.0.0.4 (0.0.0.4)  1.599 ms  1.505 ms  1.809 ms
  3  0.0.0.6 (0.0.0.6)  1.759 ms  1.714 ms  2.847 ms
  4  * * *

for  some  reason,  the  machine  on  hop  4 failed to return an ICMP 
TIME_EXCEEDED.  theres  a  good  chance  that  this box is a firewall
filtering  incoming  UDP  (or  outgoing ICMP?). in either case, we've 
probably found a firewall :).

for  windows  users,  the  microsoft  implementation  of  traceroute, 
tracert uses ICMP by default.

of  course, traceroute/tracert isn't the only way to find a firewall. 
there  are many ways, often if an ICMP ECHO_REQUEST (ping) returns no 
ECHO_REPLY  its  because  theres  a  firewall  filtering  icmp (note: 
this  doesn't  apply  to  users  on dalnet *smirk*). there are plenty
more  tools  that  can  be used in firewall detection, but i'll leave 
that to your imagination.

interrogation.

interrogation  is the process of remotely determining the rulebase of 
a firewall systematically.

in  the  previous  section  we  have  already  done  a  bit  of basic 
interrogation.  we  know  that  the  firewall at hop 4 filters either 
incoming  UDP  or  outgoing  ICMP  on  at least the port we connected
to,  which  is  unknown  to us. using traceroutes -p attribute we can
specify  a  port  to start at and determine if any ports allow UDP. a
good place to start looking is DNS (port 53) since some DNS transfers
require  UDP  theres  a good chance it will allow UDP packets through 
this port. 

since  traceroute  increments the destination port for each packet we 
need  to  do  a bit of math. there are three packets for each hop and 
4  hops  till  we reach the firewall. so the port to start at will be 
53 - (4 * 3) - 1 giving us 40.

  2  0.0.0.4 (0.0.0.4)  1.599 ms  1.505 ms  1.809 ms
  3  0.0.0.6 (0.0.0.6)  1.759 ms  1.714 ms  2.847 ms
  4  0.0.0.8 (0.0.0.8)  1.831 ms  1.918 ms  1.303 ms

we  now  know that the firewall allows UDP to pass through port 53 :)

hping  and  firewalk  are  two  of  the  most  important tools needed
for  successful  firewall  interogation.  firewalk  is  a console app 
used  to  check for open ports on a firewall. it sends data to a live
system behind the firewall on various ports to see what is allowed.

hping  is  a tool for pinging remote systems, but it has alot of nice 
attributes  for  playing  with  different  parts  of  the  actual tcp
packets.  sometimes  you can change a few of the features of a packet
and  a  firewall will let it through. hping also gives you the option
of fragmenting packets. this means that the packet will be split into
more  than  one  packet.  most  firewalls  nowadays have handlers for 
fragmentation,  but  you  may  find  one  that  doesn't recognize the 
packets and lets them through.

now nmap. as important as firewalk and hping are, nmap owns them both 
hands  down.  it  is  the single most important tool in your armoury. 
ports   scanned   with  nmap  will  output  filtered  when  there  is 
no  SYN/ACK or RST/ACK recieved from the destination. if nmap outputs
unfiltered  it  means  we recieved an RST/ACK which means our packets
are  passing  through  the firewall but the destination machine isn't 
listening on the destination port.

penetration.

using the methods above, it is possible to map out the network behind
a firewall. similar to ping sweeping, only every packet sent is care-
fully formatted so to not be blocked by the firewall.
