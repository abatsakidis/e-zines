You may already know about this by Michael Murphy


When first run Mozilla prompts you on whether or not you would like to enable
'Quick Launch' a feature of which core elements (I assume) in the browser
are stored in memory for quicker access at a later time. This made me think of
Internet Explorer since it has an unusally short time-span between the execution
and it's appearence on the screen. Then I remembered something. Microsoft had
integrated Internet Explorer into it's operating system thus giving them an
advantage over the other browsers whose componets were not already loaded into
memory. Would ripping Internet explorer's componets from Microsoft's Windows
break any license agreement or would it be concerned as reverse engineering. Who
cares. Any how I think options are good. Maybe Microsoft will adopt this kind of
attitude one day.

Words
=====
by: kleptic <outbreak@fwaggle.net>

Words are amazing.  More specifically, writing is amazing.  The way we can just 
look at a little combination of symbols and gain information from them is 
astounding to me.  You look at some combinations of symbols, and you might laugh.  
You look at another combination, and you might get really pissed off.  You could 
even look at an arrangement of symbols and get sexually aroused by them.  Isn't 
that insane!?

You can gain skills from those symbols.  Say you didn't know how to fix a blown 
out radiator hose/tube/whatever.  You could look at a certain combination of 
symbols and suddenly gain the skills you needed to fix it.  If you had looked at 
a slightly rearranged combination of symbols you would not know what to do.

There are people who get paid to arrange symbols.  They know all the rules to 
follow when arranging the symbols, and they can make combinations of symbols 
that nobody else would ever think to produce.  I really like the way the great 
Douglas Adams arranged his symbols.  His symbol arrangements make me happy, but, 
on the other hand,  Adolf Hitler's symbol combinations make me violently angry 
at the sick way he combined the same symbols.

I think I analyze things way  too much.

if not heres a summary,
"I thought things like this didn't happen anymore...

I went out last night...I was minding my own *******
business. I wsa just out at the club trying o have a
good time like everyone else there.

At the end of the night, I was walking out to my car
and I saw these two cops walking up to me. I was like
"hey, whats up?", but I didn't have any idea what they
had in store for me. They said "Hey nigger, come
here!". I stopped where I was because I knew I was in
big trouble. They walked up to me and put me in
handcuffs. I asked them why I was being arrested.
Their response was because I was intoxicated. I asked
them why they called me that name. They didn't
respond. They literally threw me in the back of their
car and drove off. They stopped in the back of a
supermarket and pulled me out of the car and started
beating me.

I couldn't believe what was happening! I thought this
was the kind of stuff that happened to other
people...not me.

After they were done whooping my ass, they uncuffed me
and told me that if I knew what was good for me I
would just walk away.

**** that!!!!!! I called my lawyer this morning. You
guys will likely see my face on CNN before this is all
over with. I am so pissed off I can hardly see
straight."

Milleniums

By Orange Julius



<<INTRO>>

The Millenium pay phone by Nortel is the new kid on the block. It is the
most advanced pay phone in the world. Which also makes it the most secure,
it is equipped with 16 alarms and also it is connected to a server,
centurions are not; just a bell CO. The server will know as soon as the
phone is off the server. It can also tell how much money is in it at all
times, when and were to all calls were made, and how much money was
inserted. In this guide I will teach you exploits on how to mess with the
phone.



<<THE PHONE>>

Milleniums come in different models, the most frequent model is the
universal, this actually has many models to... they don't vary much, some of
the newer models actually have a key board within them, this is for people
who cant talk, on the common millenium this service is available through an
operator. She will do your conversation; I have not actually seen this
happen or used this model, but a good friend from TO said its true. The
phones are programmed with a keyboard the operator has, the jack is behind
the coin slot, removing the piece is simple, just push is out with a screw
driver, you'll see what I mean when you see the phone. With this keyboard
their are commands, if you steel a manual you will see these commands. This
phone also has the yellow smart card reader, some of the new centurions have
the credit card and magnetic strip readers... these slots aren't the same,
the smart card actually has a computer chip on it... These chips can be 
written to have over $4000 on it... Some other features on the phone are the
automation, which I will explain in the net section. Op codes, which have a
section of their own, alarms, which will get u caught, an LCD screen, which
makes the phone that much more advanced and a server line. The phone does
not have a real dial tone when you first pick up, this is generated by the
phone, also the handset is mic muted. The other style is the card reader
only, you can find these on the desks at hotels and such. these are the only
pay phones in North America which only accept a card, these use the smart
card chip style credit card. There are big normal size pay phones which only
accept smart cards, these are very rare and I've only seen them at Person
International Airport in Toronto.



<<RED BOXING>>

Yes, you can red box of the Nortel Millenium, I know I might get flamed for
this but you can, I have done it, about 70% of the time the operator will
not let you get your call through because of the "automated" service on the
phone. But on the ops screen when u call him or her it'll say MIL_universal
or MIL_crdo. Some times I guess she wont notice this on her screen and place
the call. People say that each land line phone has different ops this isn't
true, the computer will just tell the op which land line type you are
using... The real reason they wont let IS NOT because of red boxers, its
because once you actually put a quarter in the phone while speaking to an op
it won't accept the quarter, the reason I will explain later. So if your
lucky she wont see the little MIL_universal on her screen and she will allow
you to put in a quarter, or in some true events place the call without you
even needing a quarter or red box.



<<OP CODES>>

As all you cunucks know the millenium is filled with alarms and such for
almost every thing... So in turn, don't try to destroy em... But how do
operators work on them, simple, with op codes. Approach one with the phone
on the hook and punch in this number "4636748" from this you will be asked 
for your op code "25563" will work...then you will be asked for another 
opcode... This code will be three digits, scan these out yourself... their 
not hard. Any thing which starts with nine will be an invalid code though, 
so this limits it to 899 possible codes, have fun. When milleniums are first 
installed for one week the entry code is "2727378" AKA craserv. Also after 
all op codes you must press the # key, if not the code will not be entered. 
After you're done your code pick up the fun and see what you've done, then 
write down the code and op pin and what it does, this way you can reference 
it to someone else.

All op pins which start with 6**** turn of sirens and will not ask you for a
op code, also it will ask you to insert your key, some people say they here
a motor sound, in my personal experience this isn't true. Their are special
maintenance level op pins which will let you control the phone options.
These pins can be found in a bell ops van in code books.



<<OTHER THINGS>>

Their are many reasons a pay phone is automated, one because money can not
be inserted in the phone while a co out put line has been established, and
two because she can not tell which coin you have inserted. Because of the
way the millenium is set up you can beige box of an exposed CO wire
without red boxing through op, its the way the phone works, when you pick up
a millenium the dial tone is generated by the phone, not the CO, so in turn
when u insert a quarter, or dial the only available line without a quarter.
911, 411, 211, 611, and I'm sure theirs some more *11 and 0  its basically
turning on a switch which allows the CO line to go through. So in turn its
not an expensive system, only a smart cheep one, And because when beige off
the CO line its past the switch which makes it possible to call out for
free. Also I've heard from sources blasting 1400hz and 1100hz together will
override the switch, I've never done this and I have no idea if it works,
try it yourself if you wish.



<<FAQ>>

1. Q> Why will the quarter come out when I am talking to the operator?

1. A> This happens because money can not be inserted on this phone while it
      is using a CO line, even the ops line :)

2. Q> Can I op divert?

2. A> In most cases not from a bell op

3. Q> What are something's which set off alarms?

3. A> cutting the server line, cutting the co line, tampering inside and out.

4. Q> How can I stop this?

4. A> Use the op code 66666, this will shut down the alarms, or cut the power
      line

5. Q> Can I call out from an out of order phone?

5. A> In most cases if its getting a dial tone and it says out of order the
      tone is from the CO, so the phone is basically a land line at your 
      dispense, insert a quarter and it will register, and after your quarter 
      will fall out.

frontpage98 exploit
===================
by: foned


ok this is the _vti_pvt exploit in front page made pages.

The way this works is microsoft frontpage doesnt CHMOD the _vti_pvt directory
to disallow visitors thus giving you access to stored passwords to the logins 
on the page.

theres two ways you can start.
1) Find a page you want to exploit and go to www.thepage.com/_vti_pvt
(this way will not always work.)
2) Go to a big search engine ( i.e. google, yahoo.) and search for 
"directory of _vti_pvt" service.pwd (or *.pwd or just .pwd) -12k
( "directory of _vti_pvt" service.pwd -12k )

This will search every website that is in the database of the search engine 
and give you the results. (incase you didnt know...) when you get the results 
visit the pages and check any .pwd file there is. it should have 
' login:aslkj52345 <-- password (encrypted) usually standard des i have encounterd 
md5 but i think those were fakes if i remember right. take that little thing 
login:aslkj52345 and run it threw John the Ripper and see if anything cracks. 
if so you should have ftp access to the site to change just about anything.

Well anyway now you can be an ejeet hax0r and impress your friends with your new 
found knowledge. Dont complain that it doesnt work because its kind of an old 
exploit. its from frontpage 98 and not too many people use that any more. dont get 
me wrong you can still find some but it might take some work and im not too sure 
its worth it.

				"Secured PC"


This article one goes out to all the PC users at the Corporate Workplace. 
Ok, here is a little help with those damn so called PC securing applications 
that disable settings on the PC.  The main use of software like this is to 
help your company that you work for, down time on thier PC`s . This is where 
the user goes in and fucks up settings and you have downtime.  The more you are
found out to mess up the computer, the more likely you are to get this software 
installed. In most cases this software is not really needed and just slows down 
the user, which leads to less work production.



Ok, where you work they have this software installed to make your computer a 
little more secure. It might be secure but the chances are that you cannot 
even go into the control panel and adjust your wallpaper. The Administrator 
might even set secure setting for the taskbar, so you have no start button,
you cannot even go anywhere except for the icons on your desktop. Right now 
most people think that is it and there is no changing any settings or be able 
to run any programs. A popular software that is used for this purpose is 
called "Windshield which is owned and distributed bye Citadel Corporation..
I have a few tips I can share with you on how to get passed a few settings, 
this works not only on Citadel software but can come in handy in a few secure 
PC software settings. The first thing a Admin on a large network would like 
you not to have is the ability to browse the Entire Network which really
slows down your hacking fun.

 Now one thing for these by pass tips to work is the ability to right click, 
If you don't we can only try windows shortcut keys . I can explain a little 
more about that later. Ok your looking at a computer with just a couple of 
shortcuts to applications, also you can see the network neighborhood Icon. 
You have no start button, but you still have th ability to right click. 
Basically you don't even need to right click but it help when you need to 
copy&paste any admin takes that away from you, you should complain right
away, Copy&Paste is well needed in to days desktop needs for many things. 
Ok you want to change the wallpaper or screen savor, but cannot get into the 
display settings. Things to look for right click on the desktop. Look for 
anything preferably  "create new" if this is not their don't worry, the admin 
was just keeping you from messing things up. What you can do of course is, 
you must  have access to a word possessor "Microsoft word, Corel WordPerfect, 
which the chances are you have one of these these software suites that you 
have access to. Ok just open your word application. All you have to do
goto FILE then OPEN from here you can just browse to/ if your on {NT/2000}
c:\winnt\system32\cmd.exe or command.com {onWIN95/98/XP c:\windows\system32\command.com
on XP cmd.exe is preferred. Ok just RIGHT CLICK on cmd.exe and paste shortcut 
to the desktop. Walla, Now you have a shell to anywhere on the computer/network 
if you have a little experience. Ok for starters we just want to change the 
screen savor to something else and maybe the wallpaper. Just go into your . 
Word Application notepad is the best, I recommend you create a shortcut to 
that right of the getgo. Ok File then Open browse to c:\windows\web\wallpaper 
for {XP} just rename the current wallpaper to something else and rename the one 
you want,  to the one that you had before you renamed it. Real easy now you can 
change your screen savors the same way , you can still bring them in from home 
if you have access to the floppy drive. Ok , so you don't have Copy&Paste ability
you can try Drag&Drop this works just as good. Also with the ability to browse 
from notepad, any application made with visual basics 4,5,6 can be used as a 
explorer shell, even if the software securing application has put a block on 
things, they did not expect this. Most of the time you can even browse the 
entire network from File then OPEN from Notepad/application. You can use this 
to run almost any application that your profile has a block on. , Also you can 
experiment with different ways to change things, you might not be able to do much 
but you sure can run programs and customize your PC like you had no restrictions, 
this would make any admin go postal. Ok you have nothing no application to
start with just a fixed custom executable, with no FILE, OPEN. You can try Widows 
Shortcut keys. The idea here is to open IE. Or something to get you started off 
with. You might not have any icons on the desktop but there always is shortcut/hotkeys 
on windows. Im sick of typing so you have to find those shortcut keys yourself.. 
Basically it is real hard for these Secure PC software suites be able to block you 
from doing certain things. There is only a few programs out their that use registry 
settings to block you from doing things that you would like to do. Other ones just 
mask them but you can do a lot of work around. Just experiment browse around and look 
for exploits what you can and cant do. If you can make a shortcut to cmd.exe or 
command.com you basically can do a lot from thier If the admin blocked you from 
everything the PC would not even work, well correctly.
                                        
                              Enjoy `,)

############    Biometric Security Basics -by dropcode    ############
######################################################################

Intro.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Biometrics is the study of physiological traits by which a human being
can  be recognized. Examples include voice  pattern  detection, retina  
and  iris  scanning,  fingerprints, palmprints and hand geometry, etc. 
There  are  various companies and organizations dedicated to this area 
of  study  and  as of late quite a few biometric security devices have 
been developed for laptop and desktop PCs.

In  this  article  I  will  cover  some  of  the basic vulnerabilities 
presented in various biometric security products.


Abstract.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ever  forget a password or private pin number? lose a key or an access 
card? Then you can probably see the advantages to widespread biometric
security  systems. But the same advantages present a few, more subtle, 
but  very  critical  vulnerabilities. For instance, if you forget your 
password  or pin, theres generally a hotline to call or someone to see
to get it changed. If you lose your key? make a new one or change your 
locks.  But  what  if  someone found a way to copy your palm print? or 
mimic your voice? Theres no replacing biometric traits.

Everywhere  we go, whenever we do anything we're leaving traces of our 
biometric  signatures.  Fingerprints and palmprints can be lifted from 
flat surfaces and recreated efficiently and inexpensively. Hurray :)


....?!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
You're  standing  outside  an  office building waiting for the smokers 
to  come out for their lunch break. You straighten your tie and put on 
your best smile.

The  door  opens  and out comes the first wave of people. You light up 
and  pretend  you  came  out  with  them.  10  minutes later Judy from 
accounting pulls out her access card, opens up the door and you follow
the group back inside.

First  things  first,  you  pull  out  your notebook and look for Jims 
office  number and floor. If everythings going according to plan, Jims 
downstairs  at  a board meeting. You know this from the memo you found
in  the  trash  bin  out  back. Jims the administrator for the company 
webpage,  you  pulled his name, address and phonenumber. It wasn't too 
difficult, you whoisd the company page at network solutions (thats the 
whois  server  that  internic  gave  you)  and  you  looked up his NIC 
handle...  that  showed  you  his  homepage and you got his infr0 from 
his  homepages  whois  record.  Anyway, for the last  3  months you've 
been  getting copies of his phone bill and going through his trash. He
seems like an easy mark: heavy smoker, problems with the ex-wife...

You  know  how  it is to be stressed, so just out of courtesy you sent
him  a  gift.  stress  putty. You know, the stuff you squeeze when you 
can't keep a train of thought? signed, 'your secret admirer' *smirk*

You  step  out of the elavator and into his office. There we go, right
on  the desk is your putty. You pocket it, along with some extravagant
office  supplies, and make your way down to the staff lunch room. Once
there  you  pull out the gellatine solution you mixed earlier that day
and  place it on the thumb print in the stress putty :). Put it in the 
lunch  room  freezer  (carefully  conceiled somewhere in the back) and 
wait about 5 minutes. Tada, perfect replica of Jims thumb.

(the gellatine mixture needs to be really strong 1:1 gellatin to water 
 ratio should do it.)

Now find a computer somewhere out of the way and use it in the Finger-
print TouchPad (trademark of Synaptics inc). Access. :)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

while  most of the pioneering biometric fingerprinting devices are all 
optical,  (meaning they only care about what a fingerprint looks like) 
some  of the newer devices (ie capacitive sensors) will make sure that 
the  finger has some electrical conductance. The optical sensors could
be  fooled with silicone fingers, but because silicone doesn't conduct
electricity, the capacitive sensors couldn't. The beauty of the attack
described above is that, gelatine DOES conduct. :D

A  common  attack  against  biometric fingerprint scanners utilizing a
method  called  capacitive  resistance  is blowing lightly on the unit 
shortly  after  it  has been legitamately used. Often, there is enough 
natural oil left over to recreate the original print.

The same effect can occur when a small plastic bag of water is pressed
against the unit.


Closing.

I intend to add to this file as I learn more about biometric tech, but
for now, this will have to do.

#### Developement of Location Determination on Wireless Networks. ####
######################################################################

Intro.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In the last two years wireless technology, as well as technology based
on   wireless   communications   has   seen  alot  of  ground-breaking 
developements.  To  anyone  with  a bit of well grounded foresight, it 
isn't very difficult to envision a future bare of data carrying cables
altogether.

This  article  will  deal  mainly with the JAVA 2 MICRO EDITION (J2ME) 
programming  language, developed by Sun Mircosystems as a JAVA variant
for  wireless  devices,  and  its potential for location determination
services.  I  plan  to  update this article as more information on the 
subject becomes available publicly.


Global Positioning. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
GPS  (the  Global Positioning System) was originally developed for the 
US  military  and  funded  by  the US Department of Defence. Basically
a  series  of  24 satellites orbit the earth at a rate of one rotation
(orbit)  every  12  hours.  Their  functions  consist  of A) recieving 
request  transmitions  from  ground units (any GPS capable unit inside 
the  GPS  satellite  matrix). B) Determining the global coordinates of
the  the ground unit using a complex system of linking 3 satellites (4 
when  a  TIME  request  is  made  as  well)  to  triangulate the units 
position.  And  c)  to  transmit  the  data  back  to the ground unit, 
accounting for any ionospheric interference.


GPS and Wireless Devices.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The  market  for GPS capable cellphone/pda chipsets has increased ten-
fold  since  last  November when the FCC passed legislature containing 
mandatory deadlines for the implementation of the technology. Soon all
wireless devices will contain GPS chips.


J2ME and GPS.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
J2ME  is  the leading wireless application developement language. When
used  in  conjunction  with  the  NMEA  protocol,  a data transmission 
protocol  used  by  GPS  units, we have some interesting potential for 
location determination. 

Technical Notes, for the curious:  data  sent  via  the  NMEA protocol 
        must  conform  to  the  following  standards:  Data is sent as 
        ASCII,  begins  with  a  dollar  sign ($) followed by GP, uses 
        a comma (,) delimiter. For more information, try the NMEA FAQ.

LocatioNet, 11 year veteran of the location based services area of the 
wireless communication field, and gate5, a mobile internet application 
developement   company,   have  recently  combined  their  efforts  in 
developing  the  zone5  engine.  Its  basically an enhanced version of 
LocatioNet's  GIS  engine  that  includes,  among  many  other things, 
mechanisms  for  location  determination  and  on-the-fly  vector  map
generation. What a brave new world we live in. 


Pro's and Con's.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In  the  shadow  of  the 9/11 tragedy, public safety is a bigger issue 
than  ever  before.  People  are  learning  to  sacrifice  their civil
liberties  for  the  safety  of  the  status quo (ie the Patriot Act).
Location  Determination  has  the  potential  to be a great device for 
insuring  public  safety in a wide variety of ways. This is a definate
pro.  But  its  this  that frightens me. A single transmition from any 
wireless  device  (remember, the FCC made this a LAW) can transmit the 
*exact  coordinates  of  any cellphone/pda's position on the planet to 
any  other  device  that  requests  it in a compact and easily decoded 
form. This carries an unsettling air of Orwellian possibility.

* - the positioning capabilities of GPS are not exact, the predictable
    accuracy is as follows: 22 meter horizontal, 27.7 meter vertical.

Obviously  the  GIS/zone5  engines are both proprietary, but its quite 
conceivable  that  some  ingenious  16  year  old coder will develop a 
client/server  application  using  J2ME/NMEA and release the client as 
a trojan-type email attachment... He could know where you're standing.
