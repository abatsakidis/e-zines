Aimless

   by Andrea Saunders Gereighty


A person kicking
one solitary brown leaf down the
pavement of August
I leave the house early
before dawn and work, to run.

Clouds agitate
grey clothes
washed without soap.
The levee rises
Rain falls
silver doubloons tinkle
to the ground.

With flat, broad, strokes
the sky lightens.
The black crow of morning incessantly caws
away the night's darkness
Until the reluctant sky,
Raises the orange lantern of sunlight

	dawn
that red glow in the east
the flush of fever.
the humidity hits me in the face 
like an abusive lover.

To Anika on Her Fourth Birthday 
 
   by Athena O. Kildegaard 

 
My daughter and I sit 
on the dark couch 
with her first-year album 
 
spilling open onto our laps. 
She asks about the strangers 
holding her infant body. 
 
I ask how her hands came to grow 
so long, the fingers agile 
and gentle in their slow 
 
turning of the pages. How she 
could have learned this trick 
of smiling from one side of her mouth 
 
and pouting from the other. 
How her hair could fall straight 
down over her ears, hiding 
 
that curved entrance to memory. 
I want to know if those old 
friends remember holding her 
 
at just two days old--or if it is only 
I who remember giving her over 
to their arms and then stepping 
 
back to take the picture. Do they 
remember the way her eyes opened 
with such languor and then 
 
held there, her eyes looking 
into their eyes, still as violets 
on a cloudless morning? 
 
Do they remember how the neighbor's 
dog yipped and my daughter 
turned to find her mother?

Coyness

   by Nancy Cotton


The bed:  mattresses princess and pea high,
With quilts plump as breasts,
Pillows softly reflecting light
From snow on the window sill,
A cat, puffed as quilts and sunk
Into its dreams to a deep lusting, 
Secures a corner.

You:  all procrastination and delay,
Would draw out me and the afternoon
Into filtered gold dusk, then,
Magician, balance, like balls in air, light,
Gold, sensuality, with hands
Sensitive to reins of horses.
Afterward, stayed in its flight,
Dusk adores the cat, amuses
Us with its love of everything in the room.

Unneeded feathers, disturbance unknown,
Here, Lady, is world enough and time.

(closed doors)

   by Christine Trimbo


At this moment
I am quite susceptible
to Jesus hocking and
sweet candy hearts
pressed into my palms
by strangers. What I
cannot hear are
doors closing.

when I hid childhood
in the closet,   I felt
the heavy clomp clomp
of mother's clogs across
the floor. If you close
your eyes tight as fists
you can see stars.

The room does not belong
to me, the pattern
 is my mothers, scarred
wallpaper, stains of sun.
I hide everything valuable
in my closet and watch
the eyes  behind the door.
Forever listening through
stale, cramped air. And late
at night, I leave the door
open and wait and
wait and
wait.

Degeneration

   by Cedelas Hall


Our childish acts broke his silence,
brought rage and lashes
from his leather belt.
Yet we made more noise than he.
In this there was little change.

It is the cold I remember,
air kept damp to ease his breathing.
Summer or winter it crept into me
shivered me on my ride home.

The oxygen generator
supported his degeneration
white noise
sometimes a pop 
followed by a sigh.
Was it mine?

     We carry on as always
     aim teasing arrows at one another.
     Three applaud the archer
     one groans from the hit.
     Desperate hilarity swirls
     around wanting to include him
     not knowing how.

He sits or lies
in silence,
nasal canula in place
cigarette paper man
eyes already gone.
Listening?

     When I wanted to tell him
     My words misted
     into the cold air of his silence.

To God and his Dark Angels

   by clara c. connell


God, you picked my bones so clean when you swooped
down from that big oak tree near the railroad.
You and your dark angels flew in a loop
above, while I bled on that lonely road.

I was half-alive, hoping to be killed
by a passing car; by some farmer in
his truck, carrying the crops from the field.
I should have known you'd be the one, my friend.

You were merciful, you and the angels,
when you gathered my bones, later crushing
them into the desert dust -- each single
grain a white silence, infinite and hushed.

Dear God, living forever is easy.
Please -- do not wake me from this sweet sleeping.

Ode to a Southern Town

   by  Barbara Lamont 


Strolling on Canal Street just before it meets
Tchoupitoulas, you know, where it turns into Dauphine
on the lakebound side
heading to Conti with that junkety junk walk
you get into sometime
when you know a good crawfish
is waiting on the corner of Bourbon
with your name written all over those heads.

He looked fine, a bit past his prime
until he gave me a
hi howy'all doin
and I jumped back into my own private space
off stride just a bit
tryin' to figure
was this a black thang
or what
go on with your bad self

Me I never heard of a white Baptist
until I turned on the tv
at maman's house on Prytania
one sunday bout eleven o'clock
they was jumpin like the Lord done come
and blessed they feet

Go on with your bad selves
with your junkety junk walk
on streets like A.P. Tureaud
and Robert E. Lee Boulevard
so the white folks moved to
streets with uptown names
like Covington, Causeway and Transcontinental.

but they can't hide the junkety junk talk
at drive through Daquiris
where his and hers Nissans and Pontiac Grand Ams
mimic Infiniti, Avanti and Saab.

Go on with your bad selves
run those yalla lights in Kenner
the last outpost of raw shopping malls
with names like Elmwood and Esplanade
still the junkety junk walk
in your step
a hint of the Second Line in the blood
work that handkerchief, go on
with your bad selves.

Plan of Action 

   by kevin R. Johnson 
 
 
I will carry myself home in pieces  
& sell my soul or kill fifty men to  
 
do it; there will be a reckoning,  
but I don't care so long as they  
 
forget me; when I am resurrected  
with a different face I will walk  
 
slowly to that broken door & leave  
a poem full of skeletons & a surprise  
 
nicely wrapped; but today is a bomb  
slowly detonating in the soft factory  
 
of my 14 year old heart & if a run of  
as many miles won't suck away the  
 
fire then I will buy a carton of  
cigarettes & listen to them burn into  
 
a monument of ash as I catch my  
breath & try to remember my address

ABOUT THE NEW ORLEANS POETRY FORUM 
 
 
     The New Orleans Poetry Forum, a non-profit organization, was  
founded in 1971 to provide a structure for organized readings and  
workshops.  Poets meet weekly in a pleasant atmosphere to  
critique works presented for the purpose of improving the writing  
skills of the presenters.  From its inception, the Forum has  
sponsored public readings, guest teaching in local schools, and  
poetry workshops in prisons. For many  years the Forum   
sponsored the publication of the New Laurel Review, underwritten  
by foundation and government grants. 
 
     Meetings are open to the public, and guest presenters are  
welcome.  The meetings generally average ten to 15 participants,  
with a core of regulars.  A format is followed which assures  
support  for what is good in each poem, as well as suggestions  
for improvement. In many  cases it is possible to trace a poet's  
developing skill from works presented over time.  The group is  
varied in age ranges, ethnic and cultural background, and styles  
of writing and experience levels of participants.  This diversity  
provides a continuing liveliness and energy in each workshop  
session. 
 
     Many current and past participants are  published poets and  
experienced readers at universities and coffeehouses  worldwide.   
One member, Yusef Komunyakaa, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize   
for Poetry for 1994.  Members have won other distinguished  
prizes and have taken advanced degrees in creative writing at  
local and national universities. 
 
    Beginning in 1995, The New Orleans Poetry Forum has  
published  a monthly electronic magazine, Desire Street, for  
distribution on the Internet and computer bulletin boards.  It is  
believed that Desire Street is  the first e-zine published by an  
established group of poets.  Our cyberspace chapbook contains  
poems that have been presented at the weekly workshop  
meetings, All poems presented at Forum meetings may be  
published in their original form unless permisssion is specifically  
withheld by the poet. Revisions are accepted until the publication  
deadline of Desire Street. Publication is in both message and file  
formats in various locations in cyberspace. 
 
     Workshops are held every Wednesday from 8:00 PM until  
10:30 at the Broadmoor Branch of the New Orleans Public  
Library,  4300 South Broad, at Napoleon.  Annual dues of $10.00  
include admission to Forum events and a one-year subscription to  
the Forum newsletter, Lend Us An Ear.  To present, contact us  
for details and bring 15 copies of your poem to the workshop.
