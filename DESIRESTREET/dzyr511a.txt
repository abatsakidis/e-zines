Nude Study


    by Yusef Komunyakaa



Someone lightly brushed the penis
alive. Belief is almost
flesh. Wings beat,

dust trying to breathe, as if the figure
might rise from the oils
& flee the dead

artist's studio. For years 
this piece of work was there
like a golden struggle

shadowing Thomas McKeller, a black
elevator operator at the Boston
Copely Plaza Hotel, a friend

of John Singer Sargent hidden
among sketches & drawings, a model
for Apollo & bas-relief

of Arion. So much taken
for granted & denied, only
grace & mutability

can complete this face belonging
to Greek bodies castrated
with a veil of dust.

The Brain's Ultimatum to the Heart

    by Yusef Komunyakaa


Stars tied to breath		When days are strung together,
don't have to be there	        the hourglass fills
when you look			with worm's dirt.

No more than drops		What do you take
of blood on ginkgo		the brain for?  I know
leaves & inconsequential	how hard you work

eggs & frog spittle		in that dark place, but
clinging to damp grass. 	I can't be tied down
Sure, I've seen doubts		to shadows of men

clustered like peacock		in trenches you won't
eyes flash green fire.		forget.  You look at
So what?			a mulberry leaf

like a silkworm does, with all your insides,
but please don't ask me to be responsible.

 
--------------------------------------------
Netherworlds

   by Yusef Komunyakaa


The day hurts. Each leaf
scribbles crimsoned ocher
across the lousy

silence.  Chocolate cherries
wrapped in silver foil
make my fillings ache.

I am pulled down to the bed.
Pages flip. Late October,
1989. Yes, I think

I know this house where
an off-duty cop says,
"You must be Robert

Lowell". That's in another city,
& please don't ask why I'm here
standing before this bronze heft

as the 54th marches past mansions
& clubs with drawn window shades.
A hundred threadbare boots

climb the sandy hills
of Fort Wagner, their gold cross
on a star still up there.

Maybe a few minutes
of the evening news,
& then a light dinner

downstairs. Something hot
& spicy. What's this?
A black man

did what, shot a pregnant
woman? The whole day
hurts. A skeleton key

shines like gunmetal
at the bottom of the Charles
River. I count roses

on the wall-paper till night
turns into snapdragons
around a casket.

I bet this is how Lowell felt
next to that crook Lepke.
I'm afraid to go

out into those Boston streets:
so many netherworlds drift
through each other,

dividing like cells. The cops
blackjack the whole night
till it confesses.

Stars on the ground
finger the woman's jewelry
& the gun in a paperbag.

The evidence pulls me back
into myself. In Durbarton
I'm in another county

of Christmas snow, across
from the old farmhouse.
The two faces holding

the picture in focus, who
knew your mother & father
when they were alive,

can you hurt them
with love? I hear you
say, "He's only a friend."

I stand beneath petals
falling from the wallpaper.
We have our arms

around each other, gazing
over a wrought-iron fence
at Lowell's grave.

A grackle& red bird
flit among icy sumac
branches, shaking berries

till they're like silent
bullet holes in the white,
funereal air,

& I wonder if his ghost
is angry about our bodies
aflame under the trees.

Ia Drang Valley:  A Dream Returns

   by Yusef Komunyakaa


To sleep here, I play dead.
My mind takes me over the Pacific
to my best friend's wife nude
on a bed.  September blue
fills the room. I lean over & kiss her.
Sometimes the spleen decides
for the brain, what it takes
to get me through another night.
The picture dissolves into gray
& I fight in my sleep,
cursing the jump cut that pulls me back

to the men in a white tunic,
where I'm shoved against the wall
with the rest of the mute hostages.
The church spire hides under dusk
in the background, & my outflung arms
shadow the corpse in the dirt.
I close my eyes but Goya's
Third of May holds steady,
growing sharper. Now, I stand
before the bright rifles,
nailed to this moment.

Wednesday Nights

   by Athena O. Kildegaard


Around the curve
of Fontainebleau to Broad
I arrive in January dark
to see lights in the sun room
someone already in a wicker chair
copies of her poem balanced
on her knees. Three of us
step from our cars
onto the pavement,
the curbs swinging against grass
lit by streetlights. No moon yet.
We come with words typed
and copied, words falling
around us into the shadows,
words clinging to the seams
of our clothes like dust.
The words shake out as we walk,
shake out and mingle,
press up against one another
until whole lines and stanzas
form in what must be a hymn
of exultation and discovery.

The Cool Third Week 
 
     by Andrea Saunders Gereighty 

 
Trees sway in the force of sullen rain 
Bonnabel, Brockenbraugh, the square block turns 
Again: It holds ten trees. 
In each yard the dry fruit different 
In shape, size and texture. 
In a hard drizzle, the fattest nuts drop 
From the giant pecan in my father's yard. 
 
He is dead: stopped, who taught me 
The difference: ripe, hollow or 
Rotten to the core. 
His fence, in a sheen of red and white reflected sun 
Outlives him. 
The grilling rain lays down again 
A patina on the hulls in disarray. 

I nudge the days closer to mid-month, wait once more. 
White maggots, narrow as needles, suck the nuts. 
Squirrels on the take toss kernels to earth. 
"The ones you pick in September will be small," 
Hooded tight in husk; rotted with the wormy 
Musk of birth. Hold on: Stay your hand. 
"Prepare for October, the cool third week." 
 
October, the month of ripe pecans. 
I am in collusion with your whims. 
I stalk trees, await the third week 
Of your span to harvest seeds 
Of one person 
The man who gave me life. 
 
Here, near the remnants of his life 
I search out the swollen, black-striated nuts 
Dad gave instructions 
Clear as October rain:  Patience.
By month's end, they'll fall again.

Garbo,  as you desire me

   by Robert Menuet


I go down,
trenchcoat, scarf, raybans.
One of you I think the doorman 
exacts his  Nod,
My  smile.

I've  looked down
into puddles as I stroll
(their forbearances are free)
but today into 
Faces.

It made me tired to be down 
where it's clear the air  
and the hunger there
are killing 
Many.

Antebellum Silhouettes

   by Yusef Komunyakaa

       ...and that this penalty of death was dealt them by their
       own husband or father or brother as the case might be.

		--LILLIAN SMITH, Killers of the Dream


The war's over. Daddy's dead
beneath a hero's white oak,
& I'm left with this

gimpy leg, a Yankee's
bullet in a bone
finer than Grecian

porcelain.  The cotton flowers
are gone.  Voices stolen
from the air, days

left like mud eels
after the river's receded 
gone up north & down

to the devil. Carpetbaggers
everywhere, talking out of both
sides of their mouths

& putting puppet niggers
in high places.  Dixie's
in the canebrake

like a corn-shuck doll.
Mother's dressed up
in lace & taffeta,

sitting upstairs, playing
solitaire.  The silos
are empty, & the edge

of the field bound with
come-along vines & kudzu.
Is it any wonder

I drink morning, noon,
& night? Yes, now
this damn burden

passed down from father 
to son, in the blood's
first howl from cave

to Stonehenge, this
scalawag's oath & naked
privilege. Can I

do it? Daddy would have
if he'd seen only half
of what I've witnessed.

He would've killed
them both by now. If
Sister is so smart,

doesn't she know Big Carl
is Daddy's bastard son?
What am I

saying? The house niggers
laugh behind their hands.
When I first came back

I held my sister
in my arms, but couldn't stop
trembling. She wasn't

a little girl anymore.
Everything here was sad
except her. The fields

languished between yellow
& brown. The corn mash
better than ever;

its old bite just as deep.
Someone was there
like a ghost

from the battlefields 
she was in the room
peering at me. Nude

beneath lamp-lit
cloth. Did she think
I was drunk?

I saw her
ease down the stairs
& out the side door.

Big Carl's shadow
was tall as the oak
they stood beneath;

his arms around her waist
& her moving against him
as if to climb a hill

or swim upstream. They won't be
laughing behind their hands
when a horse bucks

& her right foot tangles
in the runaway's stirrup 
when she trips

on the top step
& falls to the bottom
with a broken neck,
 
& me there rocking
her back & forth
in my drunken arms.

October 6th

   by Kerry Poree

         for Mrs. Williams
            H.S. Elementary


My son came from school with
(in his left foot) a will-less tapping,

so we slid our hands to feel
the close grain finish on a new wall.

We looked under secrets, under emblems,
under inky cap mushrooms for something creeping,
some small creature to call an itty-bitty something.

We found a two winged leaf-miner, who began
immediately lawyering for a weasel word why
he should not be captured and poem-ed.

We went fishing for Hemispheres, Aspirations, and Asparagus
(So what?  They sound like fish names)

We sat like seers.

We talked about the feeling of having
only a lanyard for webbing on a high structure,
but not about days I don't secure it, or the capacity to feel.

We sat like seers.
Smiled with dimples, (Though mine were faked with magnolia leaves)
he liked the effort, and that our hands are alike.

Then that will-less tapping.

I told him, "It's Mrs. Williams, ya know?
She had the same effect on your sister.

"Betcha she's a jazz singer after school.
Betcha she can speak cat and sing scat words too.
Betcha that's not just a tapping, but a timing that 
	you'll always have in your corner.
A concertized pencil in your pocket.
A slightly raspy whisper counting (one, two, three)
A calf muscle that pulses standing ...standing ...standing
A muffled ...unmuffled ...muffled trumpet"

Here ...hook us another worm,
and tell her I said
"Happy Birthday Mrs. Williams, Happy!"


--------------------------------------------
Monstrous

      by  kevin R. johnson
		

Your eyes smell
perfumed sheets,  a bed shedding its skin 

suppose... no.
I am intoxicated.

Though the soft fuzz on your legs whispers "touch me":
a gang of angels hoot & howl in irony; your mind is delicious.

Having seen things come together in reverse,
I know the possibilities of falling  
gravity is the least of my concerns.

Terrible, this ache.  Would you kiss it?
When I say things, I hope you taste apples:

good & sweet, red, with soft white meat inside that barely
protects the center

Compared to come here, saying good night is easy
monstrous, a knife cutting warm butter

                
--------------------------------------------
It comes down to this

   by Christine Trimbo


Ice slides down my throat, a
lit cigarette, small torch in
the fading light, smoke curls 
around the mirror, wisps
around a neck.

I have parcelled my heart and 
sent it in envelopes across this
country, to Oregon, California,
the North.  My words real as bullets.
But I do no damage, the dissection 
uncovers nothing.

What I am left with is a cocktail,
the lowlit room;
I think you can't begin until you 
rip the phone from the wall and
hold your head in your hands.
Love your pain like a daughter.
Sit with her.  Remain tender,
curse slowly those who 
make you feel...

BAR BEACH

   by Barbara Lamont

  
                                (for Isak Dinesen) 

                                     "I had a farm in Africa", she wrote 
                                            the cadence quiet, erotic. 
Now I wonder
what if Isak Dinesen 
had lived 
not in coffee rich hills 
with dusty red clay 
and small brown schoolgirls 
all clad in navy blue? 
 

But today.
how would she set it down,
here on Bar Beach, 
watching these treacherous tides 
where the continent curves? 


Gaily colored vendors stroll the sand 
hawking green machete-split coconuts, ivory bangles, 
slaves in chains, and 
fresh pineapple slices on a spit. 
 
 

I had a German lover 
who could not swim 
the strong current tugging 
at his ankles 
he would stumble at my feet 
with a cup of gin 


Whisper of exotic pleasures 
which turned my head 
away from the line of small girls 
in ankle chains 
who could be bought 
for one hundred US dollars;
carved ivory for two. 
 

This month of African sundays, 
I find him hard to understand 
my German rusty, his wit too subtle,
insight keen.  I think rather this
comes from eighteen gin tonics
(no ice blocks)  
of an afternoon. 


A pampered straw shelter 
on the hot sand 
the taste of desire ripe 
in the lazy Sunday afternoon heat 
I long for 
words which taste of snow on Kilimanjaro 
languid lions licking paws 
after lunch,
wild boars circling baby elephants 
and a thousand gazelles 
across the Serengeti. 
 

Instead, this blinding beach in Africa  
with over-white sand 
and navy blue sea 
where the continent hooks and turns south 
to meet the fat orange African sun,
its passions  
like the lushness of blueberries 
smothered with sugar and sour cream 
devoured under a duvet fresh with down. 
 

On the distant sand, a white pony gallops 
past bright striped banners. 
Bar Beach, a living marketplace, where 
magenta rubbings live side by side with alligator bags 
and beige water colors passing for oils. 
This languid sense of fear and discovery  
on Bar Beach 
(last Sunday our neighbors' gardeners stoned a thief to death)
where rip tides tear 
at what used to be and was..... 
 

In accented tones 
half Munchener, half Tanqueray 
he whispers 
"du, Liebchen...." 
 
 
                                              Barbara Lamont 
                                              Lagos, Nigeria 
                                              September 1995

ABOUT THE NEW ORLEANS POETRY FORUM

   The New Orleans Poetry Forum, a non-profit organization, was founded 
in 1971 to provide a structure for organized readings and workshops.  
Poets meet weekly in a pleasant atmosphere to critique works presented 
for the purpose of improving the writing skills of the presenters.  
From its inception, the Forum has sponsored public readings, guest 
teaching in local schools, and poetry workshops in prisons. For many 
years the Forum sponsored the publication of the New Laurel Review, 
underwritten by foundation and government grants.  The New Orleans 
Poetry Forum receives and administers grant funds for its activities 
and the activities of individual poets.

   Meetings are open to the public, and guest presenters are welcome.  
The meetings generally average ten to 15 participants, with a core 
of regulars.  A format is followed which assures support  for what is 
good in each poem, as well as suggestions for improvement.  In many 
cases it is possible to trace a poet's developing skill from works 
presented over time.  The group is varied in age ranges, ethnic and 
cultural backgrounds, and styles of writing and experience levels of 
participants.  This diversity provides a continuing liveliness  and energy 
in each workshop session.  Many current and past participants are 
published poets and experienced readers at universities and coffeehouses 
worldwide.  One member, Yusef Komunyakaa, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize 
for Poetry for 1994.  Members have won other distinguished prizes and 
have taken advanced degrees in creative writing at local and national 
universities.

In 1995, The New Orleans Poetry Forum began to publish a monthly 
electronic magazine, Desire Street, for distribution on the Internet 
and computer bulletin boards.  It is believed that Desire Street is
the first e-zine published by an established group of poets.  Our 
cyberspace chapbook contains poems that have been presented at the 
weekly workshop meetings, and submitted by members for publication. 
Publication will be in both message and file formats in various 
locations in cyberspace.  To subscribe to Desire Street via Listserv, 
send an Email message to DESIRE-ST@BOURBON-ST.COM and put the word  
SUBSCRIBE in the topic field of the message.  You will receive an automated 
confirmation of your enrollment.  Subscription is free of charge.


   Workshops are held every Wednesday from 8:00 PM until 10:30 at the 
Broadmoor Branch of the New Orleans Public Library,  4300 South Broad, 
at Napoleon.  Annual dues of $10.00 include admission to Forum events 
and a one-year subscription to the Forum newsletter, Lend Us An Ear. 
To present, contact us for details and bring 15 copies of your poem 
to the workshop.
