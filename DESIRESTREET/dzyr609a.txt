Bellevue Farewell

   by Barbara Lamont


I left you 
on that steel table
walked down the
cold green halls
smelling lye
and fear

I pulled your plaid
wool scarf tight
around my neck
as the snow fell
and turned to mush
oozing between my bare toes

That bleak March night
on First Avenue
staring at barred windows
revolving beacon mirrors
in a black sky
I placed a red rose between my teeth
to celebrate your freedom.


--------------------------------------------
Digital Bliss

   by kevin R. johnson


   ...is a state of reduction  
of the incurable future (raw data),
hope: an easy-to-use online organizer
 ---------
   wish words would flush away like 
throw-up, I delete them instead
 ---------
   "Do you like the way I feel?": the speakers ask
air-conditioned hands fondle empty air
the glow of her curled ribbons
touch 16 million colors
   "Ravage me
    Ooh...
    you're good"
---------
   names scroll past eyes trained to ignore 
screen-glare, searching for hidden files
---------
   statistics indicate soon I will need to up-
grade my storage capacity, my memory, my life
---------
   outside, the moon is in ruins & a storm is coming; 
I will taste the rain & tell someone about it with 
my fingers

First Womankiss

   by Clara C. Connell


Thinking of her again -- that olive-skinned stranger --
        I drove madly to the place
                  where the tattooed women dance
                               and drink Blackened Voodoo beer.

She was at the bar
         wearing her grandfather's brown hat,
                narrow-eyed and smoking like a poet in process.
                          Expecting me, of course.

With practiced eyes and her newest poem,
          she lured me to her dark corner.
                    I laughed so hard at her jokes
                           I thought of killing myself.

Begging for her stale attention like an orphan,
           I groped and searched and smelled,
                      her relaxed beauty mocking my
                              fumbling eagerness to know.

At her bidding, we kissed --
           And I knew.

She never took off her hat.


--------------------------------------------
Gris-Gris

   by Andrea S. Gereighty 


A door that's barred
A bed rumpled
A sea-slow Sunday
Your words wash me

Listen to the howlings:
The winds misinterpret
all that we are.
The flick of your tongue,
the wind lifts
everything into place.

You nestle between my breasts
I hear buoy bells
The music of distance.

You trace words through my hair
Phrases flow from your fingers
Your hands move metaphors
up my thighs
nearer the source.


--------------------------------------------
After Your Leave-taking

   by Nancy Cotton


Our relative
Existence will be a theory,
Discovered
By strangers who chart
The astronomical
Distance between us,
Imaginary points of reference,
Clear, 
Yet incomprehensible,
Like raisins (raison d'etre) 
In jello.


--------------------------------------------
Seascape

   by Cedelas Hall 
 
 
With the strength 
of the moon 
pulling tides 
to the seashore, 
 
I long to pull  
you to me, 
let you wash over me, 
warm, foamy, 
salty seawater. 
 
But I lack the strength  
of the moon. 
Your love is not 
free flowing like the tide. 
More like the sand... 
stiff, slow moving 
withholding  
gritty comfort.


--------------------------------------------
Shades of New Orleans:  Summer

  by Robert Menuet


Pentecost

Ordinary time:
by all a rain of unseen fire 
no tongue will tell


Antoine's

Tournedos Alciatore,
Baked  Alaska for two.
Let's go spelunking.


Crossdresser in St. Claude pharmacy

Creole toothache wax;
bolero jacket on sundress;
goosegrease,  honey.


Ss. Peter and Paul 

Dust on plaster,
incense, beeswax
votives flicker in holy darkness.


--------------------------------------------
Visiting Day

   by Paul Chasse


Cold grey day
Leafless trees lift
arms in naked wonder
Waitng for the snow to fall
Its quiet here
Can you hear me, my love?
'neath this marble stone?
Are you here?
Happy birthday, my love.
See? I brought you roses
They used to make you smile
I wont be here Christmass, my love
I'm moving away
I dont want to leave you here
Alone in the cold ground
But I just cant take
The reminders any more
The park where we walked
Held hands and fed the ducks
The movie theater
where we sat in the dark
Arms around each other
The mountains and canyons
We explored on my bike
I'm going home,my love
I'll miss you
forever

ABOUT THE NEW ORLEANS POETRY FORUM


     The New Orleans Poetry Forum, a non-profit organization, was 
founded in 1971 to provide a structure for organized readings and 
workshops.  Poets meet weekly in a pleasant atmosphere to 
critique works presented for the purpose of improving the writing 
skills of the presenters.  From its inception, the Forum has 
sponsored public readings, guest teaching in local schools, and 
poetry workshops in prisons. For many  years the Forum  
sponsored the publication of the New Laurel Review, underwritten 
by foundation and government grants.

     Meetings are open to the public, and guest presenters are 
welcome.  The meetings generally average ten to 15 participants, 
with a core of regulars.  A format is followed which assures 
support  for what is good in each poem, as well as suggestions 
for improvement. In many  cases it is possible to trace a poet's 
developing skill from works presented over time.  The group is 
varied in age ranges, ethnic and cultural background, and styles 
of writing and experience levels of participants.  This diversity 
provides a continuing liveliness and energy in each workshop 
session.

     Many current and past participants are  published poets and 
experienced readers at universities and coffeehouses  worldwide.  
One member, Yusef Komunyakaa, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize  
for Poetry for 1994.  Members have won other distinguished 
prizes and have taken advanced degrees in creative writing at 
local and national universities.

    Beginning in 1995, The New Orleans Poetry Forum has 
published  a monthly electronic magazine, Desire Street, for 
distribution on the Internet and computer bulletin boards.  It is 
believed that Desire Street is  the first e-zine published by an 
established group of poets.  Our cyberspace chapbook contains 
poems that have been presented at the weekly workshop 
meetings, All poems presented at Forum meetings may be 
published in their original form unless permisssion is specifically 
withheld by the poet. Revisions are accepted until the publication 
deadline of Desire Street. Publication is in both message and file 
formats in various locations in cyberspace.

     Workshops are held every Wednesday from 8:00 PM until 
10:30 at the Broadmoor Branch of the New Orleans Public 
Library,  4300 South Broad, at Napoleon.  Annual dues of $10.00 
include admission to Forum events and a one-year subscription to 
the Forum newsletter, Lend Us An Ear.  To present, contact us 
for details and bring 15 copies of your poem to the workshop.
