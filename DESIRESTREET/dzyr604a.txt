Breathing Room

    by Cedelas Hall


She stands on tiptoe
stretches for 
her sanity on the 
top shelf thinks maybe 
his 
is there too
pushed way back close 
to the wall blue 
with mildew never
ending emphysema.

She grabs the box from its
hiding place relieved the
contents are safe dusts it 
off with a road trip
to Logansport.

She drives intent
on the mission.
Beside her he puffs life 
sustaining mist from 
a bronchiolator powered
by the cigarette lighter.

Charleston

   by Christian Champagne


My gentility always 
gets in the way.
This is all I could think of 
Once I was back in Charleston.
I found myself 
apologizing to cans of soup
As I searched for 
Miss Shirley's cream of mushroom,
But when I excused myself 
to each page of the Sporting News
As I rifled through the pages
In a futile search for 
news on Stump Mitchell,
Well, I had to sit down and pause.
A tasteful pause, mind you.
My affliction was 
what worried me most.
Sure I had been to 
graduate school in the north,
But I could never 
shake this southern thing.
Or was it a Charleston thing?
Lee, Miss Caroline's oldest boy, 
had told me so long ago
That Charleston had 
invented the south,
And oh, how I believed him.
It had gotten to the point 
that I had to eat 
the business section
of the New York Times 
with my she-crab soup
Not to be irretrievably 
lost in my Charlestonian prison.
Don't get me wrong, 
I was proud to be from Charleston.
But it was an 
overpowering thing sometimes.
During one such pause 
when the Church of England 
didn't have the best of me
I ran into Sath, 
an old chum from 
my days at the Citadel.
I let him take 
the active role 
in the conversation.
Rambling on he painted 
such vivid pictures 
with his rhetoric.
An indigo John Calhoun here 
a rendition of John Locke 
inspired civic planning
cooked down in a rice dish 
that no Upcountryman 
worth his blue washcloths 
would touch there.
Sath was a mutant 
lowcountryman at that.
He went to the right schools
Would rather be discovered 
looking up a girl's dress 
at a cotillion than ever 
be caught with his 
northside manners down
Gawking at Miss Tillie's 
Venetian tea set.
Then he would switch 
gears and betray his kind 
by becoming the most 
feared house collector of his time.
We ended up that afternoon 
by having a leisurely dinner,
And if it's one thing 
we know how to do,
it's be at our professional leisure.
Once tried to start a leisure league,
Until we found out 
that lounging in the later half 
of the twentieth century 
could wear a man out
Before his all cotton shirt.
It turned into a long night.
Sath and I, two sons of Charleston
Were in a way celebrating ourselves 
as we drank rum 
late into a Sumterless night.
Then it happened.
Some Yankee cads 
here on a ruching convention
started to Charleston.
Sath and I rose 
to the occasion 
and defense of our birth right.
Sath was an expert 
with fanlight and pilasters.
The cads from 
snow country retaliated 
with tickertape and tire irons.
They were no match.
We had the home field advantage.
Satisfied as we 
triumphantly left the bar
I bid Sath a most cordial 
and manner infested goodbye,
And then I drove by Heyworth House.
I thought of my very own identity.
Not the one etched 
by outsiders of my southern heart.
But a real American reveling
in the ironclad 
beliefs of civilization.
It had been built here, 
and it was in me.
I slept well that night
The warm hug of the Atlantic breeze
lulled me to sleep,
and I dreamed of 
camellias and zoning ordinances.
I thanked the Devil 
who wore white planters' clothes,
And I complimented 
my blue jeans 
both verbally and physically.
The next night 
I tried to teach a parrot 
how to say "Dubose Heyward",
And I cruised Church Street, 
not so much to see it
As for it to see me.
I was original and I was found.

       DONT'CHA BE TOUCHIN'
      MY BAD ENGLISH POEMS.
    THAT AIN'T FOR YOU TO DO.
        DON'T UNCOUPLE ME
       FROM FOLKLORE , YOU!
        DON'T EXCHANGE MY
   BAD ENGLISH FOR LINGUISTICS.
     I SAID WHAT I  MEANT TO.
   DON'T ERASE MY LOCAL IDIOM
             FOR 
   THE NATIONAL STANDARD GUIDE.
     YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYIN'?
            GOOD!
       NOW SMILE ME A BIG
        LOCAL TYPE SMILE,
     THREE GENERATIONS WIDE.

BLOODGODDESS 
 
   by kevin R. johnson 
 
 
your blood is rain carved from the 
 
sky it rusts knives into spoons is  
 
a floodmusic for the moon incubating 
 
in water on the window beneath your  
 
whispers frantic petals urge the wind  
 
through another delirium tasting my  
 
fingers I remember the language of  
 
red the chant of raw sweet life

Semana Santa

   by Andrea Saunders Gereighty


You seduce me, Amazon, with brown, moist beauty
Lush tree dresses and leafy kisses
The sky beckons blue
Hides the sun with puffed clouds.

Cruelty is your real game once I am yours.
The sun escapes, does its best to parch me.
Thirst quickens; the sun intensifies its desire.
Piranha and caimen glide and gobble 
In the sweet deceit of your waters.

Death hides in the rainforest.
Mushrooms, hot pink.
Fire sears the body when the "twenty-four"
Strike
Army ant bites that burn twenty-four hours.
Rocks in your river hide
Wait to split seams
Spill the skiff and life.
Bottom, up-close, water low
To trick, sunder the outboard:  Growl fish
Loom in our faces that blister from sun and flies.

Blue-headed parrots mock us
Tributaries sneak in, curve like caimen
Palms aloft, in honor of this Sunday.
Mercy:  You show none, Amazon
To the children of the Yanomami.
They sit, liquid-eyed, beside the boat
Five in all.
I produce chicken, chicklets, crackers
To the girls.
Amazon, you have not swallowed us
Our boat, or some small measure of mercy.

Unfinished Business

   by Barbara Lamont


She died
on a perfect Spring day
white lilac shoots pushing through
as she lay in my arms
and ceased to breathe.

In the kitchen
the children played a tinkly tune
Oprah on the TV, fat again,
led her crowd on to greater truths.

The hole in the screen door
began to whistle softly
to mark the silence.

ABOUT THE NEW ORLEANS POETRY FORUM


     The New Orleans Poetry Forum, a non-profit organization, was 
founded in 1971 to provide a structure for organized readings and 
workshops.  Poets meet weekly in a pleasant atmosphere to 
critique works presented for the purpose of improving the writing 
skills of the presenters.  From its inception, the Forum has 
sponsored public readings, guest teaching in local schools, and 
poetry workshops in prisons. For many  years the Forum  
sponsored the publication of the New Laurel Review, underwritten 
by foundation and government grants.

     Meetings are open to the public, and guest presenters are 
welcome.  The meetings generally average ten to 15 participants, 
with a core of regulars.  A format is followed which assures 
support  for what is good in each poem, as well as suggestions 
for improvement. In many  cases it is possible to trace a poet's 
developing skill from works presented over time.  The group is 
varied in age ranges, ethnic and cultural background, and styles 
of writing and experience levels of participants.  This diversity 
provides a continuing liveliness and energy in each workshop 
session.

     Many current and past participants are  published poets and 
experienced readers at universities and coffeehouses  worldwide.  
One member, Yusef Komunyakaa, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize  
for Poetry for 1994.  Members have won other distinguished 
prizes and have taken advanced degrees in creative writing at 
local and national universities.

    Beginning in 1995, The New Orleans Poetry Forum has 
published  a monthly electronic magazine, Desire Street, for 
distribution on the Internet and computer bulletin boards.  It is 
believed that Desire Street is  the first e-zine published by an 
established group of poets.  Our cyberspace chapbook contains 
poems that have been presented at the weekly workshop 
meetings, All poems presented at Forum meetings may be 
published in their original form unless permisssion is specifically 
withheld by the poet. Revisions are accepted until the publication 
deadline of Desire Street. Publication is in both message and file 
formats in various locations in cyberspace.

     Workshops are held every Wednesday from 8:00 PM until 
10:30 at the Broadmoor Branch of the New Orleans Public 
Library,  4300 South Broad, at Napoleon.  Annual dues of $10.00 
include admission to Forum events and a one-year subscription to 
the Forum newsletter, Lend Us An Ear.  To present, contact us 
for details and bring 15 copies of your poem to the workshop.
