	The Back Seat

	by Barbara Lamont


The night my mom died
i climbed in the back seat
when we went to the nursing home
to gather a lifetime of possessions
distilled into one small room
with name tags.

It was the first time in 21 years
that my Lisa got to sit up front
with Daddy driving.

"That's the daughter's seat Mom," she said.

i knew that.
i was no one's  daughter any more
nor would i ever be.
That's why
i climbed in the back seat
pretending, curled up, crying,
trying to hold back time,
protected against head-on collisions
which had already happened,
knowing  I  would never again call anyone
mom.




        Bogue Chitto River

	by Cedelas Hall


Near Moak's bridge
there was a still, deep spot
in the river, a summer gathering place
for the residents of Bogue Chitto 
and beyond.

We spent hot summer days
dipped in the cool waters
and dappled shadows of the bridge.
Daddies taught the young 'uns
to swim their first 
awkward, splashing strokes.

Mamas reclined in the shallows
watching fat, naked babies.
They yelled mother mantras 
at raucous boys.
"Get down from there; 
you'll break your neck."
"Don't go back in the water so soon.
You'll get a cramp and drown."

Tires of cars thumped wooden music
on the planks of the bridge.
Dust sifted through the cracks,
filmed the surface of the water.

I float face up, 
sunlight filtered through trees,
lazy strobe above my closed eyes,
squeals of laughter muffled
by silty water in my ears,
gentle current urges my viscous body
past the bridge,
past Antioch Baptist Church 
where I arose from a watery grave
in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

I pass black and white Holsteins
drinking at the water's edge,
red clay banks climbing
to riverside homes with rope swings,
tiny rivulets dripping down 
miniature hills of moss
in water sculpted mud embankments.

My body liquifies, 
becomes one with the river, 
merges with the Pearl,
flows into the Gulf of Mexico.




	Bourbon Street Blitz

	by Stan Bemis


Let that horn screech
Like two sex-starved
Alley Cats
Who've come together
Through the melting of 
The fur.
Let it come rumbling
Like hot scalding lava
From a volcano
Bursting, moaning.
Let that sound come.
Let it come,
Let it come,
Let it come!




	As You Desire Me

	by Robert Menuet


I go down,
trenchcoat, scarf, raybans.
One of you I think the doorman 
exacts his  Nod,
My  smile.

I've  looked down
into puddles as I stroll
(their forbearances are free)
but today into 
Faces.

It made me tired to be down 
where it's clear the air  
and the hunger there
are killing 
Many.





	Double Vision I
	Wolf Eyes

	by Bonnie-Fastring Crumley


  I

She turned
in evening mist,
stared straight at me,
gray hair rising,
silver fur
streaked with dark.
Two legs, not four,
the shebeast
dream
hunted.

When she entered the dark woods
I followed.
I followed.



  II

I'd seen the eyes before.
Three years ago in a dream.
They'd pulled me
through words
I never dreamed I'd find.
"Make the frame of the poster
dark," I told the professional,
my physical vision threatened.

I hang the poster
over the music I haven't played
since my mother's funeral,
by the picture of my daughter,
her head turned away,
eyes looking back,
triple-matting
one darkness over the other.





   Drinking Litany

   by Stan Bemis


We had <sex on the beach>
on the rocks
And a <slow comfortable screw.>
She had a  <pink squirrel>
And an <orgasm> or two
And I was happy as can be
with the <climax> and the blend 
and strain on my <creamsickle>
and we didn't give a fuck
for any <Flaming Jesus>
that night.




	Huldah Martin

	by Cedelas Hall


I hear Maw-Maw 
sweeping in the kitchen,
scolding chickens 
from the back steps
through the open door.
The water from her dishpan slaps 
the hard ground.

Grand-daughter 
of a plantation owner,
Eloped with 
an illiterate sharecropper.
Rough cabin, 
rusty tin roof,
hand cranked well, 
chamber pots and privy.

Proud shoulders stooped by age
and garden hoeing.
Hands gnarled from grasping
the homemade broom, 
iron pots,
cow's teats.
Breasts stretched and deflated
from feeding her many children.
Face hardened, jaw set,
by their dying.

We work side by side 
silently scraping the weeds
from her garden path.
I pause, complain.
She deftly sharpens my hoe.

Softness steals in at bedtime
when Paw-Paw retires to his room.
She reads to him from her Bible,
voice carrying 
through the cracks in the walls,
over the bare rafters.

We sit on the side of her bed. 
I brush her long grey hair.
Tomorrow if I behave 
and do my chores, 
I can braid it after lunch.






	In Search of Academic Excellence

	by Bob Rainer


Grades like A, and A+ and
Stars with golden glows
Are not acquired by work alone,
But by browning of the nose.

Suck up to him or her who gives
The grades both hard and fair
And bring to class such wondrous things 
To make them glad you're there.

Awaken when the class begins 
and strive to stay alert
And even when your 'ludes kick in
Look attentive, cute and pert.

Respond to all their stupid jokes
And laugh on cue and loud.
Then when the extra points go 'round
You know you will be proud.

For study doth a scholar embrace
and attendance doth affirm.
But it's where you your proboscis place
That gets you through the term.




	Mardi Gras is Coming

	by Mary Riley


I shall stand sometimes with the little kids
From the project or other times
On the porches of the wealthier people

With people who know people
Who know people, who

Know people
Who live along the St. Charles Avenue parade route,
And the wrong and the right 
Side, the people who live along Jackson Avenue.

I shall go and stand 
Just inside,
Just outside
And be squeezed in
Between all the sides of all the people

Who come to watch for the
First signs of the first parade, the tall truck
From public service that measures for getting under 
The power lines, the motorcycle drivers, wearing
Maybe 10 or 20 or more ropes of long pearls,
The children running back and forth across the street,
Shouting, the children perched high on ladders,
Shouting, I shall yell with them, we will all yell,
Inside, outside, from all sides, we will yell,

"It's coming, it's coming!






	Season of the Crane, I
	(to my daughter, Deni)

	by Andrea S. Gereighty

      
      		I

Egrets cling      to
winter-stripped trees:
         cotton plants in bloom.


    	       II

This is not a time of blossoms.
The crane, head-high, stalks
the pier to Camp Gris-Gris.
The year is turning.


     	      III

She returns annually
at this precise season
to reclaim the kitchen,
   rummage for bread
   make the dog mourn
her lost dead at dusk
in low-keyed moans.


              IV

I wish the years would retrogress
I could carry my knowledge
devoid of stress, like old
books, into September
and to your birth.
Versed in Wicca, literature, 
Tarot, unharried, prepared for
autumnal eclipses, cranes
and the steady, sub-tropical
monsoon in my heart.






	Season of the Crane II

	by Andrea S. Gereighty


In mid-October shadows outside
Go to any length to touch the
Pecan tree,
Heavy with the burden of 
Winter's approach.
Shafts of sunlight spread leaves
Of the willing pecan.

The crane leaves Camp Gris-Gris
her season over for one more year.
At least I have been told this.
I do not believe it.
I myself have seen the crane
Near the island in the time 
Between dusk and deep dark
Her cobalt grey blending with
Horizon and waves.
I have watched her wander in May
In the heat of July with no mate
But a young crane:  perhaps an offspring?

August brings the lake to boiling
I no longer startle the crane,
No longer hear her whoops of surprise
When I come upon her suddenly as
She forages beneath the pier.

Perhaps she waits somewhere to return
Restless, as I am, for cool weather.





	Teenager Sunbathing

	by Athena O. Kildegaard 
 
 
On a rusty bicycle, 
down a familiar dirt road 
she trades care 
for the far-off sluggish  
brush of grain trucks on asphalt, 
a glint of the river, 
and cottonwoods, peeling birch, 
a patch of high grass. 
 
Down in it, 
the grass bristles, 
sounds of spiders, 
crusty beetles, 
the surprise of her desire. 
 
Then a truck from the highway 
skids close. She listens:  
two men, voices rising,  
there one minute, 
then into the truck, 
gone back to the highway, 
to town and another purpose. 
 
She would ride  
with them, she thinks, 
talk of switch boxes, 
hold their hands,  
palm against rough callouses. 
Then jump! 
she wanted to jump  
from their dusty truck  
and spit--and saunter 
as they do, she thinks, 
these workmen in jeans 
and rolled sleeves. 
 
She holds her hands 
above her face 
to block the sun, 
and in this moment feels cold. 
What she had come for has passed, 
even the dust has settled.






	Valentines Day

	by Mary Riley


You always shop for the same right things
Flowers, candy or perfume, a card,
A pin with a chip of semiprecious stone,
This year pink roses, the red too full blown,
We give into each other, it is better than winter,
Become soft as a bird in a good hound's mouth,
Then we browse some more for a way to describe
How it is between lovers when it's pretty good.
I've met you, it's payday, we'll walk to the ferry,
Taking care in the crush where crowds rush to depart
That we have what we carry, you your New York Times,
I my roses, my poems, my chocolate filled heart.





	Weird Luck

	by Christine Trimbo


I reach for the Mirror
and it falls to the floor
becoming diamonds.

Seven Years pass like
falling asleep with
the television on.  The

Mirror was the only 
high school graduation
gift I can remember.  It

Follows me like a little 
sister, asking questions
about the sky I'll never

Answer.  My face pleads,
The Mirror shows me
what alone is.  Tomorrow,

I will take my coins and
buy another Mirror and
hang it, carefully.





	Who Is This Bitch Wolf

	by Bonnie Crumly-Fastring


     Who is this bitch wolf?
"Someone you hide behind,"
My poet friend contends,
"Come out from the wolf,"
she critiques my poetry,
suggests wolf is cowardly.

My son calls wolf my god
or goddess, if he feels like pleasing.
Thinks she's a good luck omen,
like the sign on his Daddy's truck
BUCKLE UP WITH JESUS
my weird religion, my son laughs,
gives me a wolf necklace anyway.

My daughter jeers, says in disgust,
"You know you don't give
a fucking damn about wolves."
She sends me a tape of howling
when she forgives me
that we love each other,
other times she ignores my poetry
like it's her own bad dream.

"It came from a dream,"
about five years ago.
Poems erupted, like double vision,
the wolf and I, undecided,
who was who,
each image changing us
as we changed it.

A gray shadow
that twists my vision
has become a part
of my reality.
Behind, beside, over, under,
it makes union with my images.
What is sight but an idea,
not this act of physical will.
Combination of shadow, light.
     Who is this bitch wolf?





	Winnowing
 
	by Athena O. Kildegaard 
 
 
 
Titmice and housesparrows fight 
over sunflower seeds we've poured for them. 
There is no wind to carry 
away the flotsam of their feast. 
 
I should go out with a broom 
and sweep it into the holly bushes 
and Johnson grass where it will compost-- 
these tiny shells, dry pirogues, left behind. 
 
When we haggle with one another 
over laundry and wounded egos 
do we spill chaff to be swept away? 
Or mar the air with our words? 
 
Or do we barter against time,  
each argument a winnowing out of desire 
from desire? I will leave the sunflower husks 
for the small birds, reminders of sustenance.

About The New Orleans Poetry Forum

The New Orleans Poetry Forum, a non-profit organization, was founded 
in 1971 to provide a structure for organized readings and workshops.  
Poets meet weekly in a pleasant atmosphere to critique works presented 
for the purpose of improving the writing skills of the presenters.  
From its inception, the Forum has sponsored public readings, guest 
teaching in local schools, and poetry workshops in prisons. For many 
years the Forum sponsored the publication of the New Laurel Review, 
underwritten by foundation and government grants.  The New Orleans 
Poetry Forum receives and administers grant funds for its activities 
and the activities of individual poets.

Meetings are open to the public, and guest presenters are welcome.  
The meetings generally average ten to 15 participants, with a core 
of regulars.  A format is followed which assures support  for what is 
good in each poem, as well as suggestions for improvement.  In many 
cases it is possible to trace a poet's developing skill from works 
presented over time.  The group is varied in age ranges, ethnic and 
cultural backgrounds, and styles of writing and experience levels of 
participants.  This diversity provides a continuing liveliness  and energy 
in each workshop session.  Many current and past participants are 
published poets and experienced readers at universities and coffeehouses 
worldwide.  One member, Yusef Komunyakaa, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize 
for Poetry for 1994.  Members have won other distinguished prizes and 
have taken advanced degrees in creative writing at local and national 
universities.

Beginning in 1995, The New Orleans Poetry Forum will publish a monthly 
electronic magazine, Desire Street, for distribution on the Internet 
and computer bulletin boards.  It is believed that Desire Street will 
be the first e-zine published by an established group of poets.  Our 
cyberspace chapbook will contain poems that have been presented at the 
weekly workshop meetings, and submitted by members for publication. 
Publication will be in both message and file formats in various 
locations in cyberspace.

Workshops are held every Wednesday from 8:00 PM until 10:30 at the 
Broadmoor Branch of the New Orleans Public Library,  4300 South Broad, 
at Napoleon.  Annual dues of $10.00 include admission to Forum events 
and a one-year subscription to the Forum newsletter, Lend Us An Ear. 
To present, contact us for details and bring 15 copies of your poem 
to the workshop.
