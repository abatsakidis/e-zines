when 'bOOM-bOO-bOO-BOOM,bOOM-bOO-bOO-BOOM...'

COMIN UP AND...'
& ha! even their leavins got a BEAT, a RHYTHM,
keepin' us from FADIN' OUT into silence & SHIT... 





Desire

   by Obra Melancon



Ask to be cool
and warm in the morning--
sun and summer breeze
through the bedroom window
add extra sparkle
to the afterglow


Then we love again--
slowly fingertips 
move through curls
as our lips brush 
together like leaves

limbs tremble 
in fear of this moment
having to end 
as our trunks 
mesh

Then we love again--
roots intertwine
sap squirts, streaming
down the branches 
of a bloomy oak.






Double Vision II

 Reality


    by Bonnie Crumley-Fastring




I

Wolf is awake
in me.
I am suspicious 
of all that reeks of man.
Instinct leads.
Trust nothing of tradition.

I squirt my urine 
in every corner of my house,
tear chunks of meat
out of life.
Blood dripping from my jaws, 
No longer on my haunches,
I howl.


II

My mouth bites 
into the round globe-like fruit.
The golden sweetened juices
drip down my chin, onto my 
fingers.  They are so sticky.
I dare not touch the furniture.
I bite straight through the bitter peel, 
not bothering with a knife
this morning.  I need to feel 
the sun-kist fruit with all
my senses, would like to rub it 
over my naked body.

Yesterday, I sat in the chair
across from my principal's desk,
while we examined the red crisp apples
of our mutual problem.  She told me, 
sweetly, apples were oranges.
In long descriptive sentences, 
always smiling gently, she encouraged me to see the orangeness,
only becoming slightly irritated 
when I could not.
"It's your mind, it's closed," 
she told me.

That evening I did each paper
according to her prescribed definition,
writing it down first, so I could double-think
apples into oranges.
However, a blackness rose inside me,
like a deadly mold after a bad freeze.
When you arrived home, looking different,
beard and mustache cut off,
I did not know you, doubted 
my own sight, vomited black moldy
rotted fruit on you.  I'm sorry.






The Fool speaks true

   by Robert Menuet



Before the turn I look back.  I hear:
"Who got turned into a pillar of salt?"
I turn round, roll past a Fool, one I've seen before. 
Old sailor he seems, with duffel and sock cap,
perched on the floodwall.
I circle back and stop.

"Lot."
"Wrong, Lot's Wife."

An old trick.
I pedal on.

What will I say to him on the way back?
He must want to talk. It would be a kindness.
What did he mean? 
Perhaps it was my lot to be the wife:
at the corner I looked back ,
saw only traffic;  it hid the city.
His eye was on eternity.
But what to say to the old salt, 
Now I'm back ?

Suddenly I know:  speak like a madman to make a friend for pity's sake.
"Your thoughts cannot turn me into salt:
this column is flesh." I point to my leg.
"You cannot kill me with your mind,
for see I have returned,
and I will not turn my back on this city;
no, I will not turn my back on this city,
or on you; I will return again here with you."

He cringes, and his eyes turn red. Then his face.
"It wasn't me that did it,
It was Him."  He points to heaven.
His eyes stay fixed on the sky,
as tears roll down his cheeks.

Next time
he will look away;
I'll walk past,  say nothing.






El Higado

   by Athena O. Kildegaard



In Batopilas, a Canadian
walked out in the
damp early light 
and found some men
butchering a cow.
They used machetes.
The blood ran into
the mayor's yard.
The Canadian asked 
for the liver, el higado,
and they handed it 
to him, though they 
thought it strange.
He held out his 
two soft hands,
hands that played
a tenor sax the night before
under a canopy.
A couple danced in the rain,
their clothes so wet
they had become naked.
He held out his hands
and a man placed the liver
into the bowl of his palms.
It sought the open windows of
his fingers, and he carried it
back to his lover, thus:
the deep wound of the cow
spreading before him.






House Painter

   by Kerry Poree



I was the house painter
in that universal painter's uniform
                 undershirt
                 white pants
                 bandanna for a cap
                 spotted shoes
                 a rag (back pocket).

You?  A professor woman.

I couldn't do binary numbers
but I knew
         what a Beaufort scale was
         what leeks are good for
         what flat top cypress wish for
         and how to tint red, till she kissed back.


She
liked
     that I still call her Miss

I have spotted shoes.            





I  KNEW

   by Barbara Lamont



The last time 
I held you in my arms
I knew it was the end
and savored each touch
each smell, each small and tender sound
what's going to happen to us
i asked, you answered
it's already happened.






Kentucky Derby, 1994:  
 When the Big Horse Won (Strodes Creek)


    by Andrea Saunders Gereighty



Alto Cumulus clouds trail plumes 
like  Bessemer, Alabama smokestacks
The same yellow and gun-metal grey
Eddie Delahoussaye  wears
Astride
What a ride
on a track the color, consistency
of Mississippi mud
Too thin to plow, too thick to drink
"Yielding" the announcer calls it.

And the rain pelts us, the jockeys, the horses,
ladies' spring bonnets, Jones of N.Y. suits
Sweat, bratwurst.  Rain drives;  hail from Hades
repeating, repeating like a villanelle
Go for Gin digs in the far turn
Hydroplanes the stretch
Eddie gives Strodes Creek the whip
brushes withers in feather-duster motion
blue electricity: forward, back
When he does that, horse, man and rain connect.

So my horse, ny number five in the Eighth
(I'd bet him across the board)
I bet him to win, I bet him to place, I bet him to show
He waltzes in second
as the crowd, freezing, roars, rises and belts out
"My Old Kentucky Home."






Laid Waste

   by Stan Bemis



Ezra pounded
a manuscript that had been
placed in his possession.
No one looks objectively
to his or her own creation
but Ezra
had no such attachments.
He could pound it 
up and down
to the right and to the left.
He could take a forest
and make it into a wasteland.
He could do it for the Elliot of it.

The writer, T.S.
genuflected in gratitude,
took the whittled pages,
stepping over the discarded ones,
for all of him they were leaves upon the floor,
not betrayed and neglected,
abandoned children
of his own imagination.
"Thank you, Mr. Pound," T.S. said.
"Think nothing of it,"  Ezra said,
careful to lock his blue-nosed pencil 
in a drawer
despite the fact
it'd been worn down to a 
stub.

Ezra had, critics were to say,
taken out the sense
but not the rhythm.
"It means," the original writer
said, "what you wand it to mean."
Then he chewed the ass off
a critic 
who found it full of homosexuality,
tried to pound him through 
the courts.
"Tell us what it means, then," the hungry 
public cried
but T.S. demurred.
he didn't want to admit
he'd forgotten to ask his editor --
he only knew
what he'd originally intended. 






The Phantom of Camp Lori

   by Andrea Saunders Gereighty



     The state constitution of Louisiana  limits
     any new construction over coastal waterways.


Tired of it all, the sun
Turns its burned-out back
On the camp's charred skeleton.
Only pilings left, scorched
by a different fire.

Lake Pontchartrain covers the
Camp's remains, a fish-grey water skirt
Sewn with barnacles, in a sand-dollar print.

See for yourself:  cross Hayne Boulevard
(Up the levee where joggers run) over
The railroad tracks.

People once danced the lindy
A juke box played on the camp's verandah.

Grizzled Gentilly residents
Hang out for beer at the Bacchus now.
As children, some vied at checkers 
on the camp's floor, where the game was painted.

It wasn't the sea that rotted the place.
I mean she didn't go one piece at a time.
She burned one of those winters,
Rare in New Orleans, when the
Pipes freeze and crack.
A norther bellowed flames, finished her fast.

Something more than the egret lives,
I imagine from Gris-Gris, the camp east
I don't know it's her spirit, but I hear
Laughter in the acid-washed Little Woods evening fog.




THE SAME TALL TALE
  (New Orleans)

    by Byron Clement
 


An old mule halting
a tourist carriage
closes his ears and yawns:

His secret tongue swings wide
   from a parabolic curve of teeth
    like a comet in its orbit

stubbornly crossing our world's path
with another way of being
at Ursulines & Dauphine.






A Sentence About One Fucking Subatomic Particle

   by Bob Rainer

       
                             
It was late and I was tired
But I felt that one certain neutrino
That crossed my brow and fled down my cheek
With such staggering momentum
But so devoid of mass
That the soul-altering effects of its
Blind Passage was all that was necessary
To send me off again into a dimension of thought
With feelings so sensitive of the paths
Taken, and the Fool's choices made, and 
That tiny neutrino was but a ripple in
The fabric of time which around me
I wrapped for comfort and glory.






Solo

   by Obra Melancon



Speedy eyelids
racing mind
reality contaminates
the dream--
plays a song
a fake harmony
me (rebel rebel)
you and I
(a beautiful lie)

A woman-child brings 
my numb flesh to life
leaves my soul buried 
in values, a religion
a God to look-up-to--
I lose my eyes in the
clouds of my song

singing and singing
to the rhythm of 
my own heartbeat
into the darkness
of my song.





Stroke the Cat

   by Bob Rainer
         
          
                 
She told me to love her
Like I was a nun stroking a cat,
Instead of  like a baby shaking a rattle.
I was supposed to find the warmest parts and
tickle her fur.
Smooth her back until her legs were straight
and her claws extended.
When her eyes closed and her head was poised 
at the end of her beckoning neck,
Roll her over,
Rub her stomach -- both ways.
   
Ruffle the fur,
Smooth the fur,
Ruffle the fur,
Smooth the fur,
Loin to belly to chest to neck,
Ruffle the fur,
Smooth the fur --
In a slow easy rhythm
Like a prayer for forgiveness.

She paid me back as would a cat.
When she left, I was confused.
Was I still the nun, 
or had she just become one?

Mrs. Whipple, closing her writing book, watches as Tawna, Malcolm,

the only profession she's ever known.






Two Kings Over Danish

by Stan Bemis



Jesus had a chance encounter w/ Elvis
  at a 24 hr convenience store
They bumped into ea other at
  the bread rack

Although late at night they were 
  both wearing sun glasses
  Despite their incognito disguises
  they recognized ea other
immediately.
  Elvis was a bit apologetic
    "Lord," he said, "I didn't mean
     to come back
     I'm afraid the public's made 
                    me
                    into a god of
sorts
  the public sure has 
         been hard on me
      I thought it would 
                end at death
  but popular demand has brought me
                     back
   It's had me traveling 
   around so much
   it's made me
            dizzy
'Lo, here is Elvis, Lo, there is Elvis'
  & since I no longer exist
                   I'm at their whim."

"Come on," Jesus said, "Let's 
     go have a cup of coffee at Shoney's."
"My popularity," Jesus said over danish
"Has always been a marginal thing.
   Everybody acclaims me 'Lord' this
   & 'Lord' that
       but nobody wants me.
The Beatles were right
        they were more popular than 
                      Me
  but they were almost lynched
     for pointing it out.
     and Humperdink could
     have said 
      the same thing...
I hang out w/ pimps & prostitutes
homeless and AIDS patients
        and census takers
Religion is & always 
 has been 
    my greatest enemy.
First  Judaism & now
         Christianity
 God!  The things that are
         done in my 
            name."
He sighed and sipped his
  coffee.
    "Because I do believe
            in freedom
    Freedom of choice
    & individuals ability
              to find me
  I let it continue
        at least for now
but the pope, Billy Graham,
etc. et al
       have no idea how
         much they 
          piss me off -
    You, I always liked,
               Elvis
in all your insanity 
you tried to find
                me
  through
     the haze of your own
               notoriety...
You didn't ask to be King
& said there was only one 
            King & that
    was me
    but they  didn't listen to
            Me
I wonder if they actually
    would have liked me
      any better if I could sing."

The waitress making her
                  rounds
couldn't have cared less who
    they were
      two men in sun glasses
      at 3:00 A.M.
She told one
that Shoney's would not make him a 
              fried banana sandwich
but, yes, to the other's
      request for broiled fish.
   to both she said,
      "More coffee?"





Unintentional Predator

   by Cedelas Hall



I have loneliness 
enough to swallow
Los Angeles.
It breeds deep in my soul
and cries out for a kindred spirit.
It comes from being different
and there are no kindred spirits.
So I cry out to you 
but you don't hear my heart.

You hear the natives' drums,
the sound of the hunt.
You smell the bait 
in the snare.
But I have no snare.
I fear the hunters 
as much as you.

You fear loss of freedom,
Count hours, minutes,
balanced against
your inner freedom clock.

Time, your talisman,
is insignificant.
It is the essence you withhold 
that the black hole of need
inside of me craves.

My facade fools
the best of those
who pigeonhole and define.
I look grown up, secure...
benign.

But in the late night hours 
when the hunger comes
I      could 
suck everything out of you
in ten minutes
and leave you an empty, dry husk
lying on the floor...
   if      ever    
I let the loneliness
have full rein.
