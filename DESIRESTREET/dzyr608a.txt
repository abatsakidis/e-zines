Saved by the Chlorophyll

   by Clara C. Connell


I have the desire to crawl into my lungs and breathe you.
Where there is choking, I would weed the windy pain,
         bleeding the chlorophyll of green-leafed lungs
         that survive the arid ground.
I am falling in the distant rain.
Flowering on the edge of an icicle.
Crying into bloom in the treetop of epiphanies.

You are Beelzebub,
        bribing me with a flute
        while I dance
              the seedy dirt.
I am bare-assed and flying on the besmirched horns of         
                                                 decadence,
begging to be stirred in my neighboring Neptune.

I see you:
         A teasing labyrinth in the empty sky.
         A white speck in the black milk.
         The gristly vortex
                   in the skirts of snakes with mirrors.
         Becoming hope in the crushing watery space.

Shiny green leaves enter me like an evangelist.
A wild dove feeds my burning tongue.
          Taming the snorting fire.
          Cleaning my eyes with providence.
          Cooling me with the spit of beyond.

See me breathing.
The embrace.
Leaving the leeching.
Passing the gates and
        praising the chlorophyll.

Advanced Mathematics

   by Andrea S. Gereighty 
 
 
Your wet dream, age twelve 
an Andre Gide fantasy 
woman spread-eagle: 
alive, though wrists 
handcuffed. 
Free style, breast stroke: 
arms 
earthbound wings 
tied to stakes, mattress springs. 
 
Legs tethered in leather 
her body a perfect mathematical X 
the one variant, a real restraint 
 
Constricts 
		constraints 
	silk blindfold. 

My style? Astride, 
side by side 
	or some position more 
akin to Y, the other unknown.

I Do

   by Barbara Lamont


I sat on a chenille covered bed
in a cheap motel in Asbury Park
the night I decided to marry you.

You played bridge
lightly sprawled on a cheap tin
folding chair, the backs of your hands
pale in the darkness.

You riffled and ruffled the cards
and I knew that you knew
and grew moist between my knees
slick with pressed nylon and long grey garters
stretched halfway down my thighs,
which is what we wore those days.

I had a hat
with a brim to give me depth
I think we smoked,
red red Revlon lipstick
against the white filter
like the Queen of Hearts.

Two no-trump, you intoned
your bush blonde eyebrows
uniting suddenly to make you look fierce
and I knew you would win
the game, and me.

I left it all behind that night
on a bed in Asbury Park
New Jersey, cast my lot with yours
yet we did not touch or speak 
all the way home to Bronxville
where Ernest let me in two minutes to curfew.

In the afterwarmth of victory
You said "he should have trumped".
I smelled the starry South Carolina nights
in your hair, and dreamed.

In View of the Cemetery

   by Christine Trimbo


Headstones rise above the wall
white in the set sun
two runners plod, breathing out

Waiting cars rumble heavy
music blows from windows
the green light disappears them soon

Waiter/students on the deck
feet on black-wire chairs
reading the paper, so slow

The umbrella sprouts above 
the center table
the shade has spread evenly

Not here, not now

   by Robert  Menuet


Try not to remember
that thought you just had.
Ssshhhh,  this is a library!
Those weren’t gunshots, 
not here on Napoleon, 
avenue of the Little Corporal, 
his victories all around us:  
Marengo, Milan, Jena, Cadiz, 
Austerlitz, 
etc.  

That volley of pops, they were too small 
to be anything but Chinese fireworks;
they invented gunpowder 
you know.
Or could it be a .22 caliber?  
But who ever thought of  a .22 automatic?  Maybe 
a little tommygun, a miniature
for the city's rats, like in a disney movie, rat 
gangsters in pin stripe suits.  Gangsters and bankers, 
they dress the same,
especially on St. Valentine’s Day.  
They finally got Capone for Income Tax Evasion, 
and the Volstead Act was repealed.  
Antoine’s had a special room 
during prohibition,
you entered through a door marked Ladies.
I just heard of a 9mm gun that was maimed 
a gangster who was stupping another gangster’s 
momma. Sounds Oedipal, doesn't it, but there it is, 
Oedipus Cracks.  I wonder what that boy told his momma 
after he shot her 21-year old man. 

But that was in Washington.
Try not to think about it.

Old Man

   by John Kopfler


I see you, Old Man,
in the cliffs' crags
at dawn.

Teach me to stalk
cougar on your desert floor --
teach my wings silence.

Have your palm fronds
rustle the still night.

Walk my feet, Old Man,
in the dreams  
of my twilight quest.

pink tooth-brush

   by  kevin R. johnson



          under the splintered flow of fingers between the
                    criss-cross of extremities migrating a tussled
                                         bed I am an X dead center below you
                               then we curl like worms in this bliss-
                    soaked landscape of infinite curves of
          tongue & hips & I want these smells
  to last not washed away with Dawn
    not corrupted by propriety.

Poetry in its Soft-ball Stage

   by Nancy Cotton


It's that original trick
(In the beginning was the word)
Of making something
Out of nothing
That boggles the mind, yet
Is so common,
As we struggle with our own
Hats.


But when magician turns observer,
Flights of doves to facts,
Words like warm fudge
Drop to experimental form
In the cold element of water.

--------------------------------------------  
Yellow Brick Road

   by Cedelas Hall


A middle-aged father
waits inside his truck,
writes copious journals,
accepts...welcomes 
his slow starving death
inside a snow embankment,
only feet from
people passing,
yards from a cleared road,
safe within his tomb
beside his yellow brick road.

He waits for the tap 
on the window,
voice of salvation.

Loneliness

   by Paul Chasse


Loneliness isn't alone
Its rain 
Big wet
Sloppy drops
Jesus's tears

Loneliness isn't alone
Its fog
Wake up
Empty bed
Wet windowpanes

Loneliness isn't alone
It's night
Hungry cat
Campbell's soup
T. V. sorrows

Loneliness isn't alone
It's everywhere

ABOUT THE NEW ORLEANS POETRY FORUM


     The New Orleans Poetry Forum, a non-profit organization, was 
founded in 1971 to provide a structure for organized readings and 
workshops.  Poets meet weekly in a pleasant atmosphere to 
critique works presented for the purpose of improving the writing 
skills of the presenters.  From its inception, the Forum has 
sponsored public readings, guest teaching in local schools, and 
poetry workshops in prisons. For many  years the Forum  
sponsored the publication of the New Laurel Review, underwritten 
by foundation and government grants.

     Meetings are open to the public, and guest presenters are 
welcome.  The meetings generally average ten to 15 participants, 
with a core of regulars.  A format is followed which assures 
support  for what is good in each poem, as well as suggestions 
for improvement. In many  cases it is possible to trace a poet’s 
developing skill from works presented over time.  The group is 
varied in age ranges, ethnic and cultural background, and styles 
of writing and experience levels of participants.  This diversity 
provides a continuing liveliness and energy in each workshop 
session.

     Many current and past participants are  published poets and 
experienced readers at universities and coffeehouses  worldwide.  
One member, Yusef Komunyakaa, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize  
for Poetry for 1994.  Members have won other distinguished 
prizes and have taken advanced degrees in creative writing at 
local and national universities.

    Beginning in 1995, The New Orleans Poetry Forum has 
published  a monthly electronic magazine, Desire Street, for 
distribution on the Internet and computer bulletin boards.  It is 
believed that Desire Street is  the first e-zine published by an 
established group of poets.  Our cyberspace chapbook contains 
poems that have been presented at the weekly workshop 
meetings, All poems presented at Forum meetings may be 
published in their original form unless permisssion is specifically 
withheld by the poet. Revisions are accepted until the publication 
deadline of Desire Street. Publication is in both message and file 
formats in various locations in cyberspace.

     Workshops are held every Wednesday from 8:00 PM until 
10:30 at the Broadmoor Branch of the New Orleans Public 
Library,  4300 South Broad, at Napoleon.  Annual dues of $10.00 
include admission to Forum events and a one-year subscription to 
the Forum newsletter, Lend Us An Ear.  To present, contact us 
for details and bring 15 copies of your poem to the workshop.
