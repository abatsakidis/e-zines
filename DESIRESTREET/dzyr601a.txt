Picking Apricots

   by Athena O. Kildegaard
 

I like to think of you 
standing beneath the spindly 
 
branches of an apricot 
flies at your feet tipsy 
 
from the rotted juices 
your mouth open in concentration 
 
your sisters too 
filling paper bags 
 
and not a word spoken 
just the hot silence 
 
conjured by your gathering 
apricots in a mown yard.


--------------------------------------------
Stretched out in a hole

   by kevin R. johnson


Row by row you cut, then lay down tip to tip wooden poles tall as a 
man-sized woman, using pointed metal caps, stalks greener than 
money are speared one atop another.  These bundles are laid out 
like a new deck of cards down the row.  When a field is done, a 
truck goes out, you climb on the back smiling in the wind, to help 
pick up the bundles. Each run fills the truck; everyone except the 
driver and the boss must walk to the barn and climb like spiders to 
the top and hang the stalks like crowded slabs of beef.  In a few 
weeks after they're cured, the tobacco will be sold at the market.

Tobacco's clear juice runs down the machete, greasing the handle 
with every whack.  My hands are soft, never callous; bits of skin 
curl up in the dirt just like worms.

The sun is an angry father, everything weeps. When the clouds come, 
the sky turns fat and grey; light pours through as if we are on the 
underside of a lake, drowning.

At mid-day, we abandon the patch-work fields like leaving an old 
mule that won't move no matter how hard you beat it. Each is on his 
own walking up the road or through paths in the woods. I eat half a 
sandwich of not too stale bread and meat you can almost taste with 
a squirt of mustard that looks like an egg yolk if you stare too 
long.  A glass of Crazy Berry Cherry Kool-Aid washes down the food 
and grit. I like the last cup because its tart.

Night-time, and the sky if full of constellations that all the kids 
at school can name.  Now that the earth is clear, the soil is loose 
and ditches are easily dug.  But still, you have to go deep, or the 
smoke from the brown, wrinkled tobacco leaves will give you away.  
Keeping watch is important. 

Working for food, to help with medical bills, for car parts, for a 
red bandanna to wrap around my head, I learn the pain of discrete 
contortions.  From figures in the dirt the shapes of angels and 
corpses, from eating with flies and emaciated cats, I know not to 
trust my wishes to the stars.  I think of new comic-book 
characters.  I wonder, should you try to kiss a fist into dust or 
do you bide your time until its dark and let the moist, carpeted 
air of the barn soak up the screams?  I wonder if the tomatoes will 
be ripe tomorrow.  They taste best with salt, chapped lips or not.

The End of the Day (I)
 
   by Joshua Corey


Another work day done, God,
thank God.  It has been hard
resisting the sky, the pelicans
wheeling and flocking over I-10.
Hard to understand the rhetoric
of women's legs, crossing

and recrossing beneath transparent
summer dresses.  I love
my new shoe smell, the moist earth,
Louisiana turf, and every face
in every streetcar window, peeling by
like pages of newspaper in the wind:

white and black, popcorn and coffee beans.
These fertile smells have hard shells:
bite and ruin your teeth.  Better to idle
in traffic, sunlight painting your left
arm, breathing bus fumes, the cars
fitful and asthmatic.  Then home by God,

where last night's conversation hangs
in ellipsis, like a dropped stitch.
You pick through the images, wondering 
where to begin.  The sun.  Her hair.
The endless evening.  The low
clutch of clouds, black band of sky, New Orleans.

Lesson plan

   by Robert Menuet

Quit hanging on your teacher
trying to be a good catholic.
Second grade
can be a fresh start
for you. If he calls you Fat,
don't cry until you get 
home.  You're the biggest
in your class, and 
he'll  try to 
take you down
again this year.
Hit him
while the teacher
isn't looking.
Punch him in the
stomach.
If you don't fight
you make yourself
ridiculous.
Make sure
you draw blood,
sock  him in the nose.
It's worth a suspension.

Adieu

   by Cedelas Hall


Rick taught me
to make sauerkraut
with pork roast,
German potato salad.
How not to make 
red beans and rice.
How cold, distant
a German man can be.

Bill taught me
Orion has a belt, 
a sword, 
is a winter constellation,
to laugh 
canoeing in the rain.
That a short Frenchman
can have a Napoleon complex.

Sam taught me
that a poem can express
feelings too painful
to say out loud.
How to make maelstrom love
amid dust and clutter.
How timid a shielded
Irish heart can be.

Phillip taught me
to love Myers' dark rum
with tonic.
How to move to marimba,
to feed cat food
to sea gulls in mid air.
How a British ego can fill
a room and suffocate you.


--------------------------------------------
Another Way

   by Rhonda Manolis


Then:

I drank your
voice...poetry...smile
enticing, caressing me,
being in being.
 
Waited, wanting you
and when I came to you...

I gave my
eyes...mouth...flesh
feeling, breathing you. 

You took my
heart...love...trust
crushing, forsaking me. 

There was no other way.

Now:

Our way has ended,
new love's on the horizon.
I will drink anew...
life, energy, spirit.

There is another way.

Nature 

   by Bob Rainer 


Rebellion is my nature, 
Anger my fuel, 
Love but a fleeting fancy, prone to be cruel, 
Fear a companion, 
Hunger a friend, 
Curious always, never to end.  
Such am I of mortal stock 
Not rare nor pure, 
No human rock of eternal infallibility. 
Simply a rebellious, angry, lonely, scared, hungry seeker 
Awaiting my time of glory 
When my fate will be sealed and stamped: 
My ticket to the Glories; My sentence for the Time. 
And whether that fate is wonderful or not 
At least it will be mine.

Notre Dame - Another View

   by Andrea Saunders Gareighty


From the visitor's parking lot
I watch leaves in the adjacent cemetery
Pursue each other like
Players in this sport passed on
From fifth century Greece.

Other leaves huddle in a horseshoe
In golds, mauves, in reds and magentas
Like frozen players.
"You see leaves from a slanted perspective,"
I hear my sister's husband's words.

These leaves and words
Glass and smoke
Geese and memories
Whirl like flurries of snow
And drift toward us
From the lake for three days.

One leaf,
a solitary maple dancer
dizzys the way to earth
In a pirouette
In early morning
Late autumn, in Indiana.
		
		For Dennis in memory of his birthday
		   November 8, 1995

Pause

   by kevin R. johnson


The sun is cut by the edge of a serrated horizon, again
bleeding, darkness spreads like the smell of pick-pockets 

somewhere a naked butcher washes off his legs in the shower;
a doctor gives her husband a sterile kiss;
an addict gives up the habit,  again;

&the every day world is stuffed like Frankenstein with acts of poetry
 
& we do everything all the time remembering the loss of a moment.

Love Poem Translated

   by Bob Rainer

 
Your breasts tantalize me. 
They make me long to snuggle my nose
in their soft fullness.

    (Those bags of fat hanging pertly from
your upper torso seem surprisingly
conspicuous, in view of their limited
function.)


Your eyes are starry pools of night.
My dreams reflect from them back to me
They beckon me to find them.

    (Receptors for electromagnetic radiation
imbedded in your upper segment serve
both decorative and functional uses.)


My thoughts wander over your form.  
Desire brings them to the place where
your passion awaits release, again and
again.

    (Your major bifurcation houses potent
pheromones, and they are very
distracting.  You emit them frequently,
indicating an unending need for
stimulation.)


Your silken hair flows the color of God's
breath.
It plummets, wrapping you in shimmery
sheath.

    (Stringy proteins protrude and dangle.)


Your laughing robs my senses.
I will die wondering if it tells me I am the
object of your affection, 
or a buffoon for your fun.

    (The way you convey amusement is
distracting, too.)

 


--------------------------------------------
Steel Guitar

   by Cedelas Hall


Fear inside,
strung tighter
than a steel guitar.
Pluck my strings.
They sing
a twangy song.

Faithful
as a St. Bernard.
Would have stayed
with one mate,
mourned his death
like the swan.

Betrayed,
life script shredded.
New blank page 
set before me,
ending unclear.
Try to re-write
with fits and starts.

Discordant song plays.
Country novice
on a bad practice day.
Hope the strings
will hold me together.
Broken strings
are hard to repair,
the music suffers.

Wife's Complaint

   by Robert Menuet

It was my birthday, yes, 
but it was Mardi Gras Party. 
Anyhow, Tibor brought 
a huge birthday cake from Maurice's, 
larger than my wedding cake,  yes, 
and because my husband  loves cake so 
much, he made shame of me.

ABOUT THE NEW ORLEANS POETRY FORUM


    
      The New Orleans Poetry Forum, a non-profit organization, was founded in 1971 to 
provide a structure for organized readings and workshops.  Poets meet weekly in a 
pleasant atmosphere to critique works presented for the purpose of improving the writing 
skills of the presenters.  From its inception, the Forum has sponsored public readings, 
guest teaching in local schools, and poetry workshops in prisons. For many  years the 
Forum  sponsored the publication of the New Laurel Review, underwritten by foundation 
and government grants.  The New Orleans Poetry Forum receives and administers grant 
funds for its activities and the activities of individual poets.

     Meetings are open to the public, and guest presenters are welcome.  The meetings 
generally average ten to 15 participants, with a core of regulars.  A format is followed 
which assures support  for what is good in each poem, as well as suggestions for 
improvement. In many  cases it is possible to trace a poet's developing skill from works 
presented over time.  The group is varied in age ranges, ethnic and cultural background, 
and styles of writing and experience levels of participants.  This diversity provides a 
continuing liveliness and energy in each workshop session.

     Many current and past participants are  published poets and experienced readers at 
universities and coffeehouses  worldwide.  One member, Yusef Komunyakaa, was 
awarded the Pulitzer Prize  for Poetry for 1994.  Members have won other distinguished 
prizes and have taken advanced degrees in creative writing at local and national 
universities.

    Beginning in 1995, The New Orleans Poetry Forum will publish a monthly electronic 
magazine, Desire Street, for distribution on the Internet and computer bulletin boards.  It 
is believed that Desire Street will be the first e-zine published by an established group of 
poets.  Our cyberspace chapbook will contain poems 

that have been presented at the weekly workshop meetings, and 
submitted by members for publication.   Publication will be in both message and file 
formats in various locations in cyberspace.

     Workshops are held every Wednesday from 8:00 PM until 10:30 at the Broadmoor 
Branch of the New Orleans Public Library,  4300 South Broad, at Napoleon.  Annual 
dues of $10.00 include admission to Forum events and a one-year subscription to the 
Forum newsletter, Lend Us An Ear.  To present, contact us for details and bring 15 
copies of your poem to the workshop.
