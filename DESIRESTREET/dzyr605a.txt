2200 Maine Avenue - 5 Months After 
 
   by Andrea Saunders Gereighty 
 
 
In twilight darkening I sell your house 
The whore of realty attacks my car 
her hooks in Hickory, Dickory, Dock 
Lost as mice her relatives, the attorney. 
The mouse ran up the clock 
The clock struck six 
Nothing clicks into place 
So I am down the clock, rat 
in a maze, no exit from any angle 
Oxygen leaves the room; mortgage company rep  
enters. 
 
Lime green carpet buyers file in 
Interested in dollars, breaking heaters 
So I'll purchase anew 
They desecrate your rooms 
Slather blurs of blue clouds 
Poodles piss on pink carpets 
Your smell, your smile, your memory 
409ed from floors and baseboards 
Base whores, steal what's yours 
Prorate the rate thirty percent. 
I valium these harlots of houses 
Scream inward and sign 
The diazepam holds my CNS in check 
 
I must pen checks to those who'd 
Split your bricks, your boards splinter  
on a role of dice. 
Forgive me; I know what I do. 
That is the horror. 
Prodigals want their share, Practical, perhaps like  
ants 
Put it away for winter weather. 
In 75 degrees I am cold 
The clammy reach of the grave 
stirs your ashes and  
I pray to the goddess with whom you play 
to get me through this deed. 


-------------------------------------------- 
Absence 
 
   by Barbara Lamont 
 
 
she died 
just gave up 
i'm not up to par 
she said, in Polish 
i want to go home. 
The doctor simply said 
terminal. 
 
Stan came for the keys 
to my empty house 
got lost 
in the supermarket parking lot 
stumbling out the rear entrance 
clutching foil wrapped 
lilacs in a pot 
 
I showed him when and where to enter 
where to sit 
with his feisty band of poets 
where tofind coffee tea and juice 
and of course where and how to exit. 
 
He turned to give me a hug 
at first embarrassed 
by his wooly bulk 
coming on to me 
I thought. 
 
Then I remembered 
my grief 
like an old smelly sock 
stuffed away 
in a corner 
ripewith sweat 
and passion. 
 
Bonnie will know, I think 
that if she sets off my alarm 
seven Uzi toting dwarfs 
with machetes 
will screech to a halt 
in my driveway 
and blow her away. 
 
Bonnie, serious poet 
teaching small people 
in her spare time 
the fine craft of words 
counterpart to Stan 
whose last name I don't know 
 
I only know 
it is said of him 
"oh Stan 
he has more time" 
like a gift 
spoken to describe 
a rich uncle 
or a polo playing prince. 
 
As we hug 
I envy this man 
possessed of time 
yet preoccupied with Jesus. 
 
What need for the rabbi 
when I have such poets 
and lilacs too? 
 

-------------------------------------------- 
At Cumae 
 
   by Robert Menuet 
 
 
Doctor, cut round  
the neck; fold the  
head back on its spine,  
shine your torch to peer   
inside the breast. What's  
this?  No lights, no liver,  
no poems, no pluck. 
 
The bells for  vespers  
sound;  quick, unhinge  
him,  bring the head  
to chapel;  the priest  
will  make it sing. 
 
Father, put it on the altar, 
open wide  its eyes, wipe them  
with linen dipped with 
unction.   The words 
you  speak will make 
a man.  The  oracle will sing 
by matins. Look, inside  
the mouth,  is that a coin?   
No,  a piece of meat.   
How many dreams  
dreamt he? See the tip:   
more than tongue 
could tell.

Of Arms and the Man 
 
   by Nancy Cotton 
 
 
A Thursday afternoon, rain, 
No one shopping in menswear, 
Absence stretching its arms into  
Every sleeve.  Off guard, disconsolate, 
Suddenly, I'm standing on the exact 
Coordinates of longing, the site, 
Where I once lived, 
You offered your shoulders 
To obedient, fortunate shirts, 
Your eyes naked, 
Dared paltry hangings to try them on. 
Transfixed, I collide with what 
Was bodied in you.  I want 
To escape the wreckage, 
But something Proustian in plainclothes 
Holds me protesting, 
Like a shoplifter to the spot. 


-------------------------------------------- 
Shake N Bake 
 
    by Craig A Fisher 
 
 
Grasshopper 
cane pole 
blue gill 
trout 
 
spikey legs 
mandible 
tall grass 
hops 
 
bass bait 
bayou 
brown water 
slough 
 
cast iron skillet 
pan fried 
too 
 

-------------------------------------------- 
Vieux Carre' 
 
   by  Paul Chasse 
 
 
Worlds end,  
               streetlight halo 
Stone dreams begin 
                 On these lustful 
Streets between midnight 
                         accidental whorehouse 
Wandering. Ancient footsteps on  
       Greasy cobblestones 
 river fog breaths jaded 
                          desire into cool 
dawn's grey awakening  
                              windows


-------------------------------------------- 
Walking Along Prytania 
 
   by Athena O. Kildegaard 
 
 
long after 
porch lights, we listen 
to water bubbling 
in a stranger's yard. 
 
A fountain bleating 
in a crabbed garden! 
Such a paradise 
is so rude-- 
all flowers, no roots. 


-------------------------------------------- 
We Are Like That You Know  
  
   by kevin R. johnson  
  
  
We are like that you know; two  
little kids throwing rocks at  
  
someone's grave reminded me that  
I always wished you could kill.  
  
I would bury them under a newly  
planted dogwood like the one we  
  
had & carve on it a loud new  
history to silence my name from  
  
repeating what happened to me &  
you from pouring yourself out  
  
through your mouth wrinkled   
fingers & knotted hair soaked  
  
in black-outs & bones & sly  
deterences flowing over your  
  
lips that have kissed children  
to sleep & monsters with teeth  
  
clenched together to hold in  
what they wanted you to say &  
  
tears that washed off finger-  
prints from your throat where  
  
for years you were held down as  
your heart flooded with bruises  
  
knowing God wouldn't forget &  
everyone would be happy. Though  
  
I have tried many things, I want  
you to know I can't do that either.

ABOUT THE NEW ORLEANS POETRY FORUM 
 
 
     The New Orleans Poetry Forum, a non-profit organization, was  
founded in 1971 to provide a structure for organized readings and  
workshops.  Poets meet weekly in a pleasant atmosphere to  
critique works presented for the purpose of improving the writing  
skills of the presenters.  From its inception, the Forum has  
sponsored public readings, guest teaching in local schools, and  
poetry workshops in prisons. For many  years the Forum   
sponsored the publication of the New Laurel Review, underwritten  
by foundation and government grants. 
 
     Meetings are open to the public, and guest presenters are  
welcome.  The meetings generally average ten to 15 participants,  
with a core of regulars.  A format is followed which assures  
support  for what is good in each poem, as well as suggestions  
for improvement. In many  cases it is possible to trace a poet's  
developing skill from works presented over time.  The group is  
varied in age ranges, ethnic and cultural background, and styles  
of writing and experience levels of participants.  This diversity  
provides a continuing liveliness and energy in each workshop  
session. 
 
     Many current and past participants are  published poets and  
experienced readers at universities and coffeehouses  worldwide.   
One member, Yusef Komunyakaa, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize   
for Poetry for 1994.  Members have won other distinguished  
prizes and have taken advanced degrees in creative writing at  
local and national universities. 
 
    Beginning in 1995, The New Orleans Poetry Forum has  
published  a monthly electronic magazine, Desire Street, for  
distribution on the Internet and computer bulletin boards.  It is  
believed that Desire Street is  the first e-zine published by an  
established group of poets.  Our cyberspace chapbook contains  
poems that have been presented at the weekly workshop  
meetings, All poems presented at Forum meetings may be  
published in their original form unless permisssion is specifically  
withheld by the poet. Revisions are accepted until the publication  
deadline of Desire Street. Publication is in both message and file  
formats in various locations in cyberspace. 
 
     Workshops are held every Wednesday from 8:00 PM until  
10:30 at the Broadmoor Branch of the New Orleans Public  
Library,  4300 South Broad, at Napoleon.  Annual dues of $10.00  
include admission to Forum events and a one-year subscription to  
the Forum newsletter, Lend Us An Ear.  To present, contact us  
for details and bring 15 copies of your poem to the workshop.
