What kind of systems dont you hack:

	When hacking there are many things you have to
take into consideration. What kind of system am I on? 
Who owns it? What kind of OS is the system being operated
on? Who's operating it?

What kind of systems dont you hack?
Well in general you
do not hack anything having to do with the government.
Anything that has .mil or .gov stay away from in terms 
of hacking. These are ran or funded by the government.
Now when you dial into a system and want to know if its 
government operated is usually known by what os is being
used. Government Agencies usually use VAX becuase of its 
complexity. The way you'll know your on a VAX system is by
seeing the following login prompts:

Username: (username goes here)
Password: (password goes here)

Now this isnt to say that all VAX systems are government
oriented. I mean theres a number of regular VAX sytems out
there, but the majority is government operated.
Some other places such as Colleges use VAX.

Why dont you hack into government systems:	

    Because.

What not to do on a system:

	When your on a system thinking with your brain 
would only be the smart thing and to do. When your on a 
system your on there to get information. Not delete files
move files or hurt the system. I mean deleting and moving
is just dumb becuase when a sysadmin finds out anything
happened to his or his files you can be assured that 
there will be hell to be paid. The investigation will
last for a long ass time then when and if you get cuaght
your ass is fried. All i'm saying is when you hack,
think with your brain not your excitement.

Never rm(delete) unless to cover tracks. *Rule of the thumb.

I mean whats the point hacking if your just gonna be
dumb and get caught you might as well just call the Secret
Service and tell them your gonna kill the president
and just stay on the line for like 10 minutes.

Use your head.
