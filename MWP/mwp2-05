<d3mon> yes
<sirsyko> did he even write that himself?
<d3mon> god only knows.
<sirsyko> or did he just steal halflife's code?
<d3mon> he contributed NOTHING.
<sirsyko> my guess is he stole 1/2's code
<d3mon> I had a bad feeling about him from the start...
<d3mon> he cannot hack his way outof a wet paper bag...
<sn0> actually
<sn0> i haven't contributed a DAMN thing yet either.
<d3mon> yes
<d3mon> but,
<d3mon> I love you still.
<sirsyko> sn0, your presence is contribution enough
*** halflife (halflife@titan.saturn.net) has joined channel #!guild

<sirsyko> although some code would be nice
<d3mon> you made squidge look like a fool...
<sn0:#!guild> It wasn't exactly difficult
<sn0> He MORE than met me halfway.
<halflife> isnt making squidge look like a fool kinda easy?

<sirsyko> or something
<alhambra_> he's just an annoying fuck
<halflife> i dont find him annoying really
<alhambra_> not anything to worry/bother with
<alhambra_> fine
<halflife> but i dont know nor want to know him.
<alhambra_> he's an amusing chap.
<alhambra_> he's an amusing chap, not worth knowing.
