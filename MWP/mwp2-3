                        MWP:Past                    

     As Stealth rode the airplane from Utah to Florida
he thought very intensely.  What will happen to my current
group, Excessive force?  What will there be for me in Florida?
Who will I meet?  Will the Florida underground have a welcome
mat out for me or will it be a barricade?

        Getting to Florida in early December, Stealth got
situated.  He was searching around cyberspace for the real
underground core.(He couldn't attend the 2600 meetings yet as they were too far)
Hopping from bbs to bbs to find someone
worth talking to.  When finally he came to a quaint little
bbs.  The lamers were blaring but you could pick out the
real hackers.  Looking at the screen disappointedly he sees
a message. Knight: "Anyone who really wants to talk about hacking
call this number ***-****".Stealth who was skeptic called
the number expecting to talk to some lamer.  But when he found
out that this kid this fellow hacker who called himself
Knight wasn't lame he was ecstatic.  Another real hacker.
They set a date and place to meet.

     The day came. They met. They talked. They hit it off
They decided lets hang out more often.

     Sunday a holly day. Or was it? On this particular
Sunday Stealth meets Feur at the local church. They meet. Though
Feur isn't the best hacker at the time he makes up for it
in personality. Every time Stealth sees him he laughs because
of how Feur is. Feur is a mix of Scarface and Kevin Mitnick.
Stealth tells Feur about Knight and they all decide to
hang out.

     Well a month of just hanging out makes the time pass.
its now January. Stealth is back in school after the winter
break. About the 2nd week in January he meets Logic. Now
Logic is slick and very good at what he does. He doesn't
just jump into things he thinks logically about them. That's
probably where he gets his name.

     After hanging out some more Stealth gets restless.
He says you know we should make a group. The others
who haven't really thrown the notion around of forming a
group, say yeah alright.

     So MWP, or Minds With Power, is formed. MWP is made up of Stealth,
Knight, Feur, and Logic. They think well four people is cool but we need some
more people. So they search around their school to see if they can find anyone.
Anyone with hacking knowledge or even a lot of computer knowledge.

     February is when the searching stops. In this month they meet Insane. His name says it all.
His styles are crazy, and his personality isn't much different. He can do anything he puts his
mind to. Now with Insane being in the group this will help MWP.

     But there's still void in the group. A few new people would fill this
empty hole in the group. Fortunately Stealth doesn't have to look any further
than his back yard. His neighbor, Ice. He thinks with this kids country accent
and his ingenuity he could liven up our group. His flat out computer knowledge
will help us out a lot. Sign him up.

      In need of another good programmer Stealth looks hesitantly for such a 
person. When right under his nose he finds Mr Cool. A programmer fluent in almost
every programming language. From C to Verbatim. His slyness earns him his
name. Mr Cool is a great and needed asset to MWP.

     With the group getting to where it should be a terrible thing happens.
Knight just gets up and quits. No explanation no reason just got up and left the
group. This left a big gap in the professional look of MWP. They were devastated.
The wounds of this would be hard to get over.

     Still February and the replacement for Knight still hasn't been found.
Then they come across an out of the ordinary young man. Smoothee.(That's what he
calls himself.) With his long red hair and satanic appearance, he puts the
fear into all the eyes that oppose MWP. He was definitely what MWP was looking
for.

     Searching in cyberspace for the next member, Stealth finds someone.
Night. Not anything like the original Knight. But he was good.  Night was what you called the
dark end of the group. With him and
Smoothee, MWP would be loved by its allies and feared by its opposition.

     Jakal(me) who had been hanging out with Night on the internet, found out about
MWP. Not really being interested in the group(at first), I soon got excited about
it when I got an email from Stealth. Basically saying we have heard about you
and we want to meet you to see if your MWP material.

     The day came. It was Jakal's 15th birthday and he was meeting
MWP. Needless to say he got in. I guess they like what they saw because I wouldn't
be writing this article if the tables were turned.

     Now all seven of us were thinking how  we could get recognized. Then Stealth
who usually comes up with the bright ideas, says, lets write an e-zine.
We all agreed this  was a very good idea. So we got cracking and finally The MWP
Philes issue 1 was produced.

     By now you would think everything was good. The group was thriving
they had plenty of members. But MWP was restless. They needed a good phreaker. So we
asked around the group and Smoothe said yeah I know a guy. So we add Skwerly to
our amazing roster. 

     With the group going good we were all getting along but one problem.
Night could never make it to the meetings. He lived so far it was hard to get
to the meetings. So we let him go. Thankfully he didn't take it personally.

     A dark time for MWP. Logic being very daring had gotten busted. After
the dumb ass feds couldn't build a case around him he was let free. But, the
afraid and weary Logic had to quit MWP. With the loss of Logic MWP suffered
a blow to the head. They were without 2 very important(and old school) members.

     Unfortunately for Feur who changed his name to Escape working is apart 
of being in a group. Though he was a skilled hacker his laziness with getting
us known was a problem. Escape is a good guy he just changed over the time
from a knowledge seeker to what MWP wasn't looking for. So we had to do what
was best for MWP and kick him out.

     Doktor was the next person to join. Though Jakal knew him from school
he still had to go through questioning by Stealth. With Doktor's
connections in the underground and his hacking/phreaking skill he would get MWP
known quickly and become a great asset.


     Our last but certainly not least member is, LSD. LSD got our zine and mailed Stealth. Even
though he was older than any other member, he was still a great contribution.
 MWP: Present

     MWP still soaks up the sun in Ft.lauderdale, Florida. We still have meetings.
We still hack and we haven't recruited anyone else for a while. The knowledge
that MWP gains everyday now makes it more and more powerful.

     MWP: Future

     Who knows what the future holds for MWP. Getting busted isn't very
likely. Getting bigger and expanding is our most likely path that we will take.

To learn more about what is going on in MWP keep reading the MWP Philes.
