                                -------------
                                 File #1 of
                                  Issue #2

                                Summer of '97
                                -------------
                       ~ we're here to share ideas. ~

First off I would like to say one thing.
Issue#1, what a mess. Seriously though. I had people mail me and threaten to
kill me, cut me, bomb my house, hack our webpage, and other misc. things. I
know it sucked. I pretty much wrote the whole thing and did a crappy job at
that. We had like 10 people who "said" they were going to write and didn't.
Anyways, this issue will hopefully be up to standard. I only wrote one
technical article, one misc article and one silly and rather hilarious
article. I hope you enjoy this zine as much as we do. 

Ahem....

              The BEST zine ever : FEH
    Tops 5 reasons to goto a con : 5)To meet the kid that pissed you off on
                                     IRC.
                                   4)To meet new people.
                                   3)To see one of the Editors of Phrack.
                                   2)You get a chance to punch a member of
                                     CERT.
                                   And the number 1 reason to goto a con:
                                   1)To finally see the REAL LOD-MOD war!
                                     (Just kidding ErikB!)
  Top 5 reasons NOT to beige box : 5)On the way to the house you get bit by
                                     a dog.
                                   4)Before getting bit, you step in a large,
                                     stinky, rather smelly and brownish pile
                                     of dog crap.
                                   3)Once you get there, there's another dog
                                     waiting to suprise you.
                                   2)When Insane swings the lineman's handset
                                     like a sling you bend down to get
                                     something and bam! Right in the freaking
                                     head.
                                   And the number one reason NOT to beige box.
                                   1)You see a fat old couple having run
                                    around and pinch my ass sex in the mother
                                    freaking living room!
