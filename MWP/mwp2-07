                               BLACK BOX PLANS

  HERE IS HOW YOU CONSTRUCT A BLACK BOX.

    WHEN YOUR PHONE IS JUST SITTING THERE DOING NOTHING THE
  VOLTAGE THROUGH THE PHONE LINE IS ZERO. THEN IF SOMEONE CALLS
  YOU (FOR SOME STRANGE REASON) AND THE PHONE IS RINGING. THE
  VOLTAGE JUMPS TO 48 VOLTS WHICH TELLS MA BELL TO STAND BY IF YOU
  SHOULD PICK UP SO SHE CAN BILL YOU. WHEN YOU EVENTUALLY PICK UP
  THE PHONE, THE VOLTAGE DROPS TO 10 VOLTS AND THE BILLING STARTS.
  WHAT A BLACK BOX DOES IS KEEPS THE THE VOLTAGE AS 36 VOLTS,
  THEREFORE THE INCOMING CALLER NEVER GETS BILLED (INGEINIOUS)

    THE ORIGINAL BLACK BOX WAS CREATED BY AN EX-BELL EMPLOYEE WHO
  WENT BY THE NAME "CAPTAIN CRUNCH". HE GOT HIS NAME FROM THOSE
  LITTLE WHISLES YOU GOT IN BOXES OF CAPTAIN CRUNCH BECAUSE THEY
  EMITED A TONE THAT WAS EQUAL TO A COIN.CAPTAIN CRUNCH JUST
  ANNOUNCED  HIS RETIREMENT FROM PHREAKING WHEN HE WAS RELEASED
  FROM A CALIFORNIA JAIL. HE WAS CAUGHT WITH A BLUE BOX.

   CONSTRUCTION OF A
    BLACK BOX

    1] A 36 VOLT ZENER DIODE.
    2] A CERAMIC OR MYLAR CAPACITOR OF 0.1 MICROFARAD.
    3] A ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR OF 1.0 MICROFARAD.

   YOU CAN GET THESE AT YOUR LOCAL RADIO SHACK DEALER.

  FIRST YOU HAVE TO OPEN UP YOUR PHONE.YOU SHOULD NOTICE THREE
  WIRES COMING IN FROM THE BACK OF THE PHONE, A GREEN, RED, AND
  YELLOW. MOST OF THE TIME THEY CAN DIFFER.DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE
  YELLOW WIRE, WE WILL NOT BE USING THIS.YOU WILL NEED TO FIND THE
  MOST POSITIVE OF THE REMAINING TWO WIRES.(ALMOST ALWAYS THE
  GREEN WIRE). NOW CONNECT THE BANDED END OF THE ZENER DIODE TO
  THE MORE POSITIVE OF THESE TWO WIRES. "IN SERIES". YOU HAVE JUST
  COMPLETED THE FIRST STEP.  FOR THE SECOND STEP YOU NEED A
  CERAMIC OR MYLAR CAPACITOR OF 0.1 MICROFARAD. YOU CONNECT THIS
  "IN PARRALLEL" ACROSS THE DIODE. THIS IS NEEDED TO ALLOW THE
  DIODE TO PASS VOICE SIGNALS.  NOW FOR THE FINAL STEP TAKE YOUR
  ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR OF UP TO ONE MICROFARAD WITH ITS '+' END
  CONNECTED TO THE BANDED END OF THE DIODE AND THE OTHER END
  SHOULD BE CONNECTED TO THE ANODE END OF THE DIODE. MA BELL IS
  NOT TOTALLY OBLIVIOUS TO THIS.IF THE PHONE RINGS FOR ABOUT A
  HALF-HOUR THEY WILL THINK SOMETHING IS WRONG AND BILL YOU
  ANYWAY.  WHEN USING A BLACK BOX,YOUR PHONE WILL CONTINUE RING
  EVEN THOUGH YOU PICKED IT UP. YOU HAVE TO MAKE A SWITCH TO
  CONNECT ONE OF THE RINGER WIRES.THAT WILL SHUT IT OFF. THAT'S
  IT! HAVE PHUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  (>Introduction<)

             What is a BLACK BOX? A BLACK BOX is a device that is hooked up
  to your phone that fixes your phone so that when you get a call, the
  caller doesn't get charged for the call. This is good for calls up to 1/2
  hour, after 1/2  hour the Gestapo (the you can guess what happens.

             What this little beauty does is keep the line voltage from
  dropping  to 10v when you answer your phone. The line is insted kept at
  36v and it will make the phone think that it is still ringing while your
  talking. The reason for the 1/2 hour time limit is that the Gestapo thinks
  that something is wrong after 1/2 an hour of ringing. (I mean, come on)

       All parts are available  Radio Shack. Using the least possible parts
  and arrangement, the cost is $0.98; and that is parts for two  of them!
  Talk  about a deal! If you  want  to splurge then you can get a board, and
  a switch. There are two s

             Once you have hooked up all the parts, you must figure out what
  set of wires go to the line and which go to the fone. This is because of
  the fact that LED's must be put in, in a certain direction.  Depending  on
  which way you put the LED is what controls what wires are for the line &
  fone.

             In order to find out, hook up the box in one  direction using
  one set of wires for line and the other for phone.

             *NOTE*  For Model I switch should be OFF.
             *NOTE*  For Model ][ switch  should  be
                    set to side connecting the LED.

       Once  you have hooked it up,  then pick up the fone and see if the
  LED  is on.  If it is, the LED will be lit.  If is  doesn't light then
  switch the wires and try again.  Once you know which are which  then label
  them.   *NOTE*  - If neither  directions  worked  then  your switch was in
  the wrong position.   Now lable   the   switch  in  its   current position
  as BOX ON.

  (>Black Box Usage<)

       The purpose of this box is not  to people  who  call you so it would
  make sense  that  it  can only  be  used  to recieve calls.   When the box
  is  *ON* then you may only recieve calls. Your phone will ring like normal
  and the  LED light on the box will flash. When you answer the fone the LED
  will light and the caller will not be charged. Hang up the fone after you
  are done like normal.

   Finally, it is here! What was first conceived as a joke to fool the inncoent
  phreakers around America has finally been concieved by the one phreak who is
  the expert on lines and voltage: The Traveler. Other boxes by the Traveler
  include the White Gold Box, the Aqua Box, The Diverti Box, and the Cold Box.
  All of those plans will soon be available in a BBS/AE near you!

   Well, for you people who are unenlightened about the Blotto Box, here is a
  brief summery of a legend.

  --*-=> The Blotto Box <=-*--

     For years now every pirate has dreamed of the Blotto Box. It was at first
  made as a joke to mock more ignorant people into thinking that the function
  of it actually was possible. Well, if you are The Voltage Master, it is
  possible. Originally conceived by King Blotto of much fame, the Blotto Box is
  finally available to the public.

     NOTE: The Traveler can not be responcable for the information disclosed in
  the file! This file is strictly for informational purposes and should not be
  actually built and used! Usage of this electronical impulse machine could have
  the severe results listed below and could result in high federal prosecution!

     All right, now that that is cleared up, here is the basis of the box and
  it's function.
     The Blotto Box is every phreaks dream... you could hold AT&T down on it's
  knee's with this device. Because, quite simply, it can turn off the phone
  lines everywhere. Nothing. Blotto. No calls will be allowed out of an area
  code, and no calls will be allowed in. No calls can be made inside it for that
  matter. As long as the switchhing system stays the same, this box will not
  stop at a mere area code. It will stop at nothing. The electrical impulses
  that emit from this box will open every line. Every line will ring and ring
  and ring... the voltage will never be cut off until the box/ generator is
  stopped. This is no 200 volt job, here. We are talking GENERATOR. Every phone
  line will continue to ring, and people close to the box may be electricuted if
  they pick up the phone.

     But, the Blotto Box can be stopped by merely cutting of the line or
  generator. If they are cut off then nothing will emit any longer. It will take
  a while for the box to calm back down again, but that is merely a superficial
  aftereffect. Once again: Construction and use of this box is not advised! The
  Blotto Box will continue as long as thee is electricity to continue with.

     OK, that is what it does, now, here are some interesting things for you to
  do with it...

  --*-=> The Blotto Box Functions and Installation <=-*--

     Once you have installed your Blotto, there is no turning back. The
  following are the instructions for construction and use of this box. Please
  read and heed all warnings in the above section before you attempt to
  construct this box.

     Materials:
               - A Honda portable generator or a main power outlet like in a
                 stadium or some such place.
               - A radio shack cord set for 400 volts that splices a female
                 plug into a phone line jack.
               - A meter of voltage to attach to the box itself.
               - A green base (i.e. one of the nice boxes about 3' by 4' that
                 you see around in your neighborhood. They are the main switch
                 boards and would be a more effective line to start with.
                 or: A regular phone jack (not your own, and not in your area
                     code!
               - A soudering iron and much souder.
               - A remote control or long wooden pole.

     Now. You must have guessed the construction from that. If not, here goes,
  I will explain in detail. Take the Honda Portable Generator and all of the
  other listed equiptment and go out and hunt for a green base. Make sure it is
  one on the ground or hanging at head level from a pole, not the huge ones at
  the top of telephone poles. Open it up with anything convienent, if you are
  two feeble that fuck don't try this. Take a look inside... you are hunting
  for color-coordinating lines of green and red. Now, take out your radio shack
  cord and rip the meter thing off. Replace it with the voltage meter about. A
  good level to set the voltage to is about 1000 volts. Now, attach the voltage
  meter to the cord and set the limit for one thousand. Plug the other end of
  the cord into the generator. Take the phone jack and splice the jack part
  off. Open it up and match the red and green wires with the other red and green
  wires. NOTE: If you just had the generator on and have done this in the
  correct order, you will be a crispy critter. Keep the generator off until you
  plan to start it up. Now, sauder those lines together carefully. Wrap duck
  tape or insultation tape around all of the wires. Now, place the remote
  control right on to the startup of the generator. If you have the long pole,
  make sure it is very long and stand back as far away as you can get and reach
  the pole over. NOTICE: If you are going right along with this without reading
  the file first, you sill realize now tHat your area code is about to become
  null! Then, getting back, twitch the pole/remote control and run for your
  damn life. Anywhere, just get away from it. It will be generating so much
  electricity that if you stand to close you will kill yourself. The generator
  will smoke, etc. but will not stop. You are now killing your area code,
  because all of that energy is spreading through all of the phone lines around
  you in every direction.

     Have a nice day!

     The Green Box generates useful tonessuch as COIN COLLECT, COIN RETURN, and
  RINGBACK.  These are the tones that ACTS or the TSPS operator would send to
  the CO when appropriate.  Unfortunately, the green box cannot be used at a
  fortress station, but must be used by the CALLED party.  The tones (hz) are:

     COIN COLLECT      700  +  1100
     COIN RETURN      1100  +  1700
     RINGBACK          700  +  1700

     Before the called party sends any of these tones, an operator released
  signal should be sent to alert the MF detectors at the CO.  This can be done
  by sending 900 + 1500 Hz or a single 2600 Hz wink (90 ms) followed by a 60 ms
  gap and then the appropriate signal for at least 900 ms.  Also, do not forget
  that the initial rate is collected shortly before the 3 minute period is up.
