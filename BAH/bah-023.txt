it's my birthday today. im fourteen years old. yay.


what this country needs is reality.
-----------------------------------

i turn on the tv. i see talk shows. all talk shows (except geraldo) all
cover the same subject: love. with topics like "my brother fucked my gay
spouse" or something like that. it's annoying as hell. ricki lake is the
worst. once you get them "90's girls" talking, there's no stopping. the
show always ends up pointless. w00ps. another fucking hour wasted, more
electricity wasted. owell. i know! LETS WATCH MTV!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

yay. mtv sucks. they hire people because they can act like they give a shit
about the music they play. and then there's more pointless shows like "the
real world".
you know, if you wanted to see 'the real world', get your sweaty brown
ass off the couch and go outside! tv is no substitute.

i'm not even going into the deal about how the country deals with modems
and the internet. it's been bashed and promoted so much that it's not even
worth arguing about anymore.

then there's the communications decency act thing. fuck it. that's my
opinion. fuck it. i don't care.


what this country needs is less 'free press' shit arguing.
----------------------------------------------------------

a 'free press' suggests that all opinions are welcome. they ARE. normally,
the newsmedia reports the prevailing opinion in america. if they dont
report what someone likes, they argue. "AMERICA IS RUNOVER BY COMMUNISTS!
THERES NO FREE PRESS ANYMORE!" bullshit. yes, many news services are
bought, but most aren't. most just go with the bandwagon with the most
people on it.


what this country needs is more money.
--------------------------------------

money is the source of many problems here. want to know what's ironic? all
those problems, everyone thinks they can be solved with MORE money. great,
huh? so now, our money goes to causes that wouldn't BE there if we'd had
the money to spend in the first place. everyone wants money.

there are ways to solve this. america has adopted a great way to make money
from nothing: computer programs. it's a growing industry in the world.
compaines like microsoft and ibm are huge and are very rich. its a great
example of creating wealth.

however, america is dependent on other country for computer parts, which
is a tremendous problem.


what this country needs is *less* anti-trust law.
-------------------------------------------------

yes, i said LESS. they're fucking up things and not doing any help.
why exactly did bell have to break up? from stories ive heard, we pay
more now than we did.

why don't they help? here's an example: my local phone company can be
argued as a monopoly. i could take it to court. they would say, "well,
you're free to use another local company." you sure are. well, what's the
problem? THERE ARE NO OTHER LOCAL COMPANIES. "well, that's not THEIR
fault."

ticketmaster is another example. you can use a different service, but you
won't get the same range of bands.

this pearl jam thing irks me. they're not LOSING any money by going to
ticketmaster. believe me, a PJ show would sell out, no matter how much the
damn tickets are. 


what this country needs is less corrupt values.
-----------------------------------------------

a recent survey polled thousands of new lawyers. as you know, america leads
the world in production of new lawyers by a ratio of three to one to the
next largest producer.

72.5% polled think being a lawyer is WHAT AMERICA NEEDS.
*95.9%* think what they're doing is right. defending people.
53% say that the immense amount of money a lawyer makes swayed them into
that profession in one way or another.

now, that's great. i guess lawyers don't have to worry about other
countries taking over our raw wealth, they can just SUE THEM! I'M SO GLAD
WE HAVE AMERICAS LAWYERS! NOW WE'RE SAFE!

well, i hope you enjoyed this. i didn't. erwait, maybe i did.
