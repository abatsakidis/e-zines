electrical fun

_disclaimer dont fuck yourself over with these.  some of these are for kicks
but some of them really work.  If you want to try it go ahead.  I take no
responsibility though._

Electrical Buzzes
   Ok find a touch tone phone *WITH* a cord.  Now there are 2 parts to the
phone.  The base part and the hand held part.  Take the hand held part and
unplug it from the base, so that the base still has the cord in it but the 
hand held part dosen't.  Now take the other end of the cord and touch it to
your tongue.  If you want to go into a deep sleep try sucking it.
   Take 2 pieces of tin foil and shape them like a plug.  (right below) Then
 ------\          grab onto the handle and stick it in an outlet that isn't 
        )-=====   used very much.  This will give you quite a shock.  When
 ------/          I did this the outlet turned black.  So clean it up after-
wards with some 409 or somthing.

Battery Heater
   This is great.  We used to make these during school, we'd steal the
batteries from tech class.  Ok well anyways.  Gather together a piece of tin
foil about 2 inches round.  And 2 *NEW* 9-volt batteries.  Take the foil and
set it inbetween the two batteries.  Make sure the batteries are on opposite
ends so that that can fit into each other.  Don't rip the foil.  Now the 
               (                  batteries and the foil will get hot.  Throw

Electrical Pranks
   This is fun to do when you go over to a neighbors house.  Take their 
portbale phone and make sure it is off.  (dont want to hurt yourself!) Now
once your sure, unscrew the antenna and pour water in, until its full.  Now
put the antenna back on real tight so *no* water seeps out.  Set it back on
the recharger and wait to here about someone sueing at&t for fucking with 
their phones.
   This is another fun one to do when your over at your neighbor's house or
in your brother's or sister's room.  Find the lightswitch in there room and
unscrew the box until its open.  Throw some water inside it and screw it back 
together.  When the person turns on the light...


Snap Bomb
   
   This bomb is made out of those rad noise maker's 'snaps' or 'pops'.  This
bomb is real loud, and it flips in the air.  Real simple to make.  

_disclaimer_  i dont take any responsibility if you blow away your neighbors
car, or your brother or whatever.

Ingrediants:
1 pop can (or any other container)
1 box of pops (or more for more explosive)
1 pair of scissors
6 inch piece of string
1 cup
hairspray   
   
   Well, first that's start out about the wick.  Get your string and your hair
spray and lay your string on the ground.  Get your string soaked with hairspray
and let it dry for an hour.
   Next take your pop can and cut it so there is about a third left.  Now take 
your box of snaps (or pops), and carefully take off the white paper, set that 
down somewhere.  Put the stuff inside the white paper, in the cup.  **Put it
carefully in there, because the snaps stuff can blow up if it hits wrong**
(it happened to me)  Now once you have the snap's rocks in the cup, and the 
paper laying down somewhere else.  Take your can and throw the wick in.  (make
sure it's dry.  otherwise the snaps won't blow up)  Now *carefully* pour in
the snaps inside the can.  Now take the paper and put it down in the can, above
the snaps.  Find the wick and pull it out so that there is about one inch hangin 
out.  Take it outside and lite 'er up!  It needs to sit there for about 2 min.
until it blows up, but when it does... watch out!  The can will fly into the air
and do flips.  It will also make a *LOUD* noise.
