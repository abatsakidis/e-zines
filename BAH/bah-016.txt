Wednesday, 9:27

Riiiaaaaang....  Riiiaaaaaang.... 
   I pick up the phone.  "Hello?"
   "Eh man wuzzup?", in a real deep voice like a 30 year old.  
   "Nothing man, just chilling...", I say, wondering who it is.  All of the
sudden a higher voice pops up. 
   "Hey Andy, this is Mike and Cory, we wanted to see if you were skipping 
tomorrow?", said Mike.
   "Ohh shit.  Eh Cory your a fag, but anyways, yeah Mike I'll go wit ya, who
else is going?", nervously.
   "Alright, eh dood let me call you back, because I need to call some other 
people to get everthing hooked up, I'm not sure who is going...", Mike choked.
   "Alright.", click.
Dial Tone.

Wednesday, 10:19

Riaaang.
   I snatch the phone quick.  "Whaddup?"
   "Eh broman this is Mike, It's all hooked up for tomorrow." 
   "Alright, dood tell me where we're going."
   "I am one tired Latino, I'm going to bed, I'll tell you on the bus."
   "Alright, later Mike.", click.
Dial Tone.

Thursday, 6:00

   "Damn alarm clock", I think to myself.  Damn, here's a big day.  The first 
day I truly skip for the hole fucking day.  Gee I'm nervous.  I know shit is
going to be going down and I know some of those hoes got shit. (std's).  Damn
This whole Mexican clique I'm hanging with nowadays just ins't right.  But,
it's so much fucking fun.  That's see what should I wear.  How about tan 
Dickie's with a black hood.  Black and Gold, great.
   
Thursday, 7:15 - On the Bus
 
   "Hey Mike what's up mother fucker?"
   "Not much man, Here's the deal.  First we're getting Linda then we're 
running across the football field since it's really foggy outside.  Then we're
going down to old girls house Tina."
   "Aww for real?  Dood is her husband home?"
   "Naw, He's at work and we got the fuckinig house to ourselves... and the 
hoes."
   "Ohh sheeit.  Well I guess it's all gonna be hooked up.  Is there gonna be
some weed or what." (Damn, I am a fiend...)
   "If Danny brings some..."

Thursday, 7:30 - School

   "Damn, Where the fuck is Linda at?", splurts out Mike.  Mike kinda has
a thing for Linda.  Linda is one fine girl, with some big ass tits.  Nice ass
too but that's all beside the point.  She ain't here!  
"Oh fuck there she is, cmon Andy.", I run towards her.  
"Eh, Jen what's up?, I say.
"Shutup ya'll we gotta split.", said Mike.
     As we're running toward the football fields we get yet another distraction
... Will.   
   "Hey Will", I said.
   "Hey where ya'll going?", he said.
   "Umm skipping.", I said.
   "I'm there...", he said.
   We're now in the football fields running towards the next street and i got
alot on my mind.  Will is crazy, Linda is fine, where the fuck is Tina's house?
I'm pretty sure Mike knows the way.  While we're walking we exchange stories 
about how we got ready for today.  Will didn't even know, he just ... left. We
come to a ditch and walk through it for about 30 minutes when we're finally 
there.  Jesus is standing in the porch.  
   "Shit!  We got 3 new skippers?  Fuck, I hope ya'll brought some shit." said
Jesus. 
   "Hey Jesus.", I said "Haven't talked in awhile.", I said.
   "I know man, eh dood want a square?", calmly Jesus said.
   "Naw dood you crazy smoking is bad for you! ... grin, So how come we're not 
inside and not on the porch?", I said.
   "Umm well here look at this.  (a note... it said. [Me and Tonya will be 
gone for a second be back in a little bit.]  I've been here since 7 and they
still aren't here.", Jesus said.
   "Well fuck me.", said Will.
   "I guess we'll just have to chill unless...", I said. "Eh look somone's
coming, it's Cory.", I blurted.
    Cory is a big dude.  About 6' feet tall and real strong and a gang 
member.  Drug dealer, aka Peanut. 
    Other people arrived afterwards.  There was a total of 6 people: Me,
Will, Linda, Mike, Jesus, Cory, and Nathan.  More would definitly come.  
Even the hoes, about ten of them.  And some more guys.  
    We waited for another hour and we were still on the porch.  We we're 
trying to figure out excuses if we got caught.
    "Umm we don't go to Edison we go to St. Pat's and it's off today." or
"We're all car pooling to school..."  Lots of bullshit.  We got tired of this
so Nathan, Will, and I split and went to the gas station to make a phone call.
After 15 minutes of walking we finally arrived at Mobile Gas Station where
Nathan made the phone call and I got some candy bars.  I took one look at the
cash register guy and he was some Sadam Huessian worshipper.  He had on a buret
and was wearing a green outfit with the Iraqi flag on it.  Go figure.  I asked
for a pack of squares and he gave them to me...  Today was a good day.  Nathan
didn't connect so we went back.  
 On our way back we found about 11 other people that we're going. All girl's   
except for one... Joe.  Now there was going to be 17 plus whoever else came.
I started smoking a square, easing the tension of me being nervous.  Great.
We walked back to Tina's house.  Tina was home.  As we walked inside we were
greeted by the rotiwiler and everything.  Talk broke out everywhere about a
fight.

Thursday, 10:03 - Tina's House 

   "So what's this shit about a fight?", I mumbled.
   "Well it's like this.", Danny started.  Danny was the biggest pimp I knew
at the time.  He could get some off any girl he wanted.  "Yesterday when we
were over here.  Me and Jamie got it on, gave me a blow ya know?  And know my
sis (Lindsey) is gonna kick her ass cause she Mikeht have something.  I don't
see why we gotta kick her ass Lindz, It's just another hoe.  sheeeit if I 
wanted I kick her ass..."
   "Damn Danny!", Lindz screamed.  "I'm helping you.  Andy, all I know is her
shit is getting kicked hard.  If that lazy ass bizatch has time to trip up on
my ass I'll kick her jagged tooth cunt."
   I heard some cars pull up.  It was some dudes from Auburn that I hadn't 
seen in awhile.  
   "We're here for the fight.  I wanna see the bitch grip.  Fuck yeah!", They'd
say.  "Trick...", said a dood named Garrett.
   Well I was confused.  Lindsey who wasn't small was going to kick one of the
finest girl's asses I'd ever seen.  And Danny (one of the kings from around 
could easily kick the fuck out of anyone) didn't want to.  But when he saw his
old Auburn friends he decided he'd kick her ass too.  It was all hooked up for
one of the biggest fights I would have ever seen.  
   Jamie was coming over at 11 and it was 10:49 we discussed how about 7 people
would kick her ass.  Some of the ideas was to get naked with her like someone
would fuck her, then throw her out in the living room and piss on her.  We
probably would have if Tina thought otherwise.  
   "You guys, I don't care what the fuck you do, smoke weed, fuck, etc, just 
don't get me arrested or my house dirty.", Tina said.  I had to laugh.
   Jamie was here and shit was on.  As soon as she got inside, we locked doors.
and waited for her to grip.  
   "Ohh I don't have anything.  I didn't do shit!", she said.  She was going
to regret what she did yesterday with Danny.
   "Well bitch, all I gotta say is where the fuck did you learn how to be a
hoe?", said Lindz. "Can't you keep your legs closed?  Did your mom teach you
that?  Huh, Bitch?", Lindz taunted.
   After this little session of fighting with words, Lindsey stepped up to 
Jaime in her face and said, 
   "Hit me Bitch, Hit me hard, It'll me your last.", Lindz intidatly.
   Since Jamie didn't hit Lindz, Lindz took Jamie's hair and THREW her to the
other side of the room.  Jamie was on the ground, and doing some kick like she
was peddling a bicycle.  Lindsey just kicked and kicked her, yelling and 
screaming on how bad a fucking hoe Jamie was.  They finally moved Jamie into 
the living room where their was more room.  This time everybody was in the 
living room and Jamie was in the corner.  Lindsey stepped up, "Bitch got any-
thing to say?", Jamie just looked at her wrong and Lindsey took one swoop.
Jamie was hit right in the jaw. Her head hit the wall and she was on the ground
once again.  This time 8 or 9 people jumped in, kicked her in her head, her
ass, her boobs, her leg, her gut, everywhere. Lindsey was ripping out her hair.
Tina stopped the fighting.  Too much mess.  Blood was all over the carpet 
along with a few good clumps of hair.  The rotwiler went over there and was 
eating it.  Great.  We talked about the fight.  I was in awe.  Danny, the 
person who caused all this mayhem had just kicked the shit out of a girl that
just gave him a blow.  Hell naw.  My pack of cigarrettes was out and I reached
for another pack there.  Great, free ones, Newports.... yuck menthyol.  yuck.
   Tina let Jamie leave.  Jamie looked like shit.  Her face was full of bruises
and scars.  She learned her lesson the hard way.  We couldn't believe that 
Tina let her go.  Think if she went back to school and told people that we 
were skipping and she got her ass kicked (obviously).  Shit happens, and I'm
glad she did not know me well enough to know my whole name.  
   The rest of the day was chilling. I was hanging out with Jesus and Danny and
they had some weed. We smoked and talked about ourselves. Jesus and Danny are  
best friends, and Will was my best friend but he was off getting some of a hoe,
and I didn't feel like getting herpes today soo... Anyways we were talking and
we became fairly good friends.  Jesus was like me. He said he'd fuck a girl if 
he really loved her for the first time.  I personally don't give a damn the 
rest of the times.  I'm glad we thought alike.  Danny on the other hand, He 
prolly has something.  That's nasty.  Anyways it all went down, we ordered for
pizza and everyone fucked or chilled or did their thing the rest of the day. 
  It Jesust great to know what had all gone on today. I had another j and Tina
had a pipe.  "Ohh shit..", I thought.  Tina was cool and was in her early 20s.
She went into her bedroom with Cory and God knows what happened but Tina had
a seizure.  She musta went Od.  Mike and I went outside to call 911 since 
Tina didn't have no phone.  We were stopped by Nathan who said it stopped.  I
guess she just got fucked up.  It was time for me and Mike to head back to 
the bus and go home.  I said goodbye to everybody, (in some way) and then we 
left.  We talked about the day.  He said oh man our shit is the bomb.  We do
this everyday.  He was right, today was the bomb and it could be like this for
another 8 weeks.  I wasn't sure if this life was for me or not.  It is.
   Well you know our fear about Jamie going to school.  Well, first she went
home, got her mom and they went to school.  Jamie reported everyone she knew
but there was the few she didn't know (me) that are still around (not in juvy)
and get to tell this story.  People got busted.  Life isn't any fun unless you
do stuff bad, just try not to get caught.  =)
