Hmm.

I was just out, purchasing new music. This is what I picked up:

Pink Floyd / _Pulse_
Tori Amos / _Winter_ <EP>
Michael Jackson / HIStory: Past, Present, and Future: Book 1

When I got home, the first that I put in was the MJ. From what I've heard
so far, it rules. MJ's _Dangerous_ album sucked, in my opinion. The other
stuff by MJ (Thriller, Bad, etc.) is great. This new album isn't bad
either.

The TA I've heard before, so it's no big deal. It was on sale.

A friend of mine bought Pulse a few days ago, and he was listening to it.
It's cool too.

I didn't go there to buy the Floyd or TA, I went to buy the new MJ and the
Better Than Ezra albums. I found the other two on sale first, so I bought
them.
Yay.

Weezer
-=-=-=

I've been listening to Weezer like, nonstop, for the past three days. I've
had it since the day the album came out, and it still rules. I'm probably
going to see them in August. Weezer rules. It's the kind of music like none
other. It's a shame there's only ten tracks on the CD. I can't wait until
they put out a new album. How can anyone not like Weezer?


Floyd
-=-=-

Lots of people like Pink Floyd. They're the best actual musicians I've ever
heard. They actually play music. With instruments. Not with a computer or
synthesizer.


NIN
-=-

NIN is a horny anti-Christ on a Macintosh. Need I say more?


"Power SUCKS!"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A recent opinion is that power chords in music suck. The Offspring is an
example. I found little wrong with the Offspring, except they yell too
much.

Everyone's excuse to hate the Offspring is that power chords suck. Those
same people listen to Soundgarden. What does that tell me?

No offense to Soundgarden either, their music is great, but they DO have
almost everything that Offspring has.


STP/Pearl Jam
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

STP and Pearl Jam don't sound exactly the same. I don't know why people do.
Weiland has an extra tired sounding part to his voice. Eddie Vedder
doesn't. It's easy to tell the two apart.


Rap
-=-

I don't like rap. I think it's a much easier way to communicate by regular
singing than by saying everything you want to say very quickly, so that
nobody can hear what you're saying.


Depeche Mode
-=-=-=-=-=-=

DM rules. That's that. Martin Gore's songwriting skills are almost
unmatched in the music world.


Belly
-=-=-

Belly rules as well. I bought _Star_ the day it came out. It ruled. I
played it over and over. It still ruled. To this date, _Star_ still rocks.


Well, you've heard lots of opinions today. Throw them in my face. As
always, flames are welcome. Send them to scase@aol.com.
