      This is something I can objectively talk about because I've been
well associated with two scenes:  815 and 309.  815 was the origin of
one of the creators of the old D-Dial and therefore has a large and
strong MajorBBS community.  309 (at least the portion local to me) has
no MajorBBS at all.

     The differences between the two scenes are therefore rather
striking in some places, and a lot of this I can attribute to the
MajorBBS.  Some of these are good things, others surely aren't.

     First, 815 has a much larger overall BBS community and therefore
the scene as we would know it is in turn larger.  This is a good thing
in itself, because it involves more and different people.  309 has a
very small user base to feed off of, which can create a certain stagnancy.

     Conversely, 815 has a lot more idiots in it.  Utter morons that
don't know jack shit about jack shit infest 815, and they simply aren't
present in 309.  And this is because, well, the true morons enter the
scene via the MajorBBS.

     Let's look at a few concrete examples.  I'm not going to use any
names (and I have to be careful because this person has used so many trying
to get access to various sytems) so I'll call this person Beef.  Beef is an
absolute idiot who entered the 815 BBS community via MajorBBSs.  Beef is
most likely to be found playing Trade Wars or Mutants or some such online
game on a MajorBBS or a comparable game on a one-liner.  Beef thinks he's
the biggest shit there is, so he starts a BBS of his own and a group of his
own, lies about his contacts and affils, and wants to make you think he's
the k-raddest there is.  And he's just a fucking moron.  He never would
have seen an 3LiT3 file if he hadn't gotten into BBSing through MajorBBSs.

     On the other hand, I also got my start primarily through MajorBBS.
But at the time I started calling around I didn't have access to any sort
of message net or had any concept about ANSi or anything.  In time I
learned enough about these things to be quasi-knowledgable.  But I never
felt like I was some great thing.

     Now let's see where Beef and I have gotten.  Beef is blacklisted all
over the place.  I'm a cosysop on no less than four 309 boards.  Beef is
hated by one and all that know of him, with minor idiotic exceptions.
I'm well-respected wherever I happen to turn up and am in two official
k-rad groups.  Beef encourages 12-year-olds to start their own groups so
he can claim them as affils.  I helped start a group for a purpose besides
trying to be k00l.

     And herein lies the chief problem that a MajorBBS brings to the
forefront.  Idiots like Beef enter through the MajorBBS or through one-
liners offering Trade Wars.  Albeit some of the upper echelon elite d00dz
may have in fact got into the scene the same way...for the most part, you
don't seem to find outright lamerz in non-MajorBBS cities.

     On a secondary note, it's worth bringing up the fact that in 815 the
college population is under 5,000 while in 309 here there's about 25,000.
The average and median age of users is affected as such.

     I like MajorBBSs and I don't think they're entirely a bad thing, don't
get me wrong.  But they create serious problems when k-radderz like Beef
somehow try and worm their way into the scene.  Let's be on the lookout for
such morons and keep them down where they belong (or try and educate them,
if applicable.)

                                * * *

(Note: It should be pointed out that Murmur is now in THREE official
k-rad groups. :)
