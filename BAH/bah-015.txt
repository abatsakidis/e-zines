        I tossed the book aside as I lay down on my bed, feeling my breath
fly away from me as I remembered the stories.  The book, telling the experiences
of people I had never met, left me wondering how I had become excited from
the written word.  I remembered one particular story, of a woman using a 
shampoo bottle and a dog collar to masturbate herself in a strange sort of way.
I wondered if I would ever be able to find a device to satisfy myself with as
I slowly felt the softness of my right breast.  I rubbed my fingers across 
the baby-smooth skin, feeling the hardness come to my nipple.  I was almost 
disappointed as I felt the penetration in my breast, wishing to feel the 
lovely soft skin again.  I slipped my brassiere off my shoulder to tighten 
the straps, hoping to push my breast closer to my body.  As I sat on my bed,
I felt the pure softness of my breast with the back of my arm, and wondered
how I had never noticed the beauty of my breasts before.
        Whenever I was with another person, woman or man, I had never reached
a climax through the touching and caressing of my breasts.  My nipples were 
often hard, but it was never satisifying for me.  But now, as I felt my breasts
again, I realized that the hardness was gone.  I was free to feel the softness
of them again.  I ran my hand across my breast, feeling the firmness and youth 
of my beautiful breast.  
        I wondered how I looked to other people, wondered if they thought my
breasts were beautiful, too.  They must have, since they had told me so.  I 
had never thought much of them before, just that they were there and they had
to be hidden with a brassiere.  I looked down at my body and marveled at the
beauty of it.  I had often thought that I was lucky, not having anything to 
do with the loveliness of my body.  I didn't exercise much and ate junk for
food.  I must have been blessed, somehow.  
        I felt the softness of my newly shaven legs, running my slightly damp 
hands up and down my skin.  The curves of my legs amazed me-they seemed so 
perfect.  I slowly brought my hands to the joining point of my legs, rubbing 
my clit through the black jeans.  I continued to feel the softness of my body.
        I wondered how it felt to him, he who frequented my dreams so 
many times.  I lay on my bed, remembering our most recent time.  
        It was so strange, feeling his soft lips against mine.  I had never
imagined that a kiss could feel so foreign, so different than any other.  I 
parted my lips to take in his tongue, but he teased me, running his tongue 
around the outside of my mouth.  I moved closer to him, feeling his warmth.  
He took my hands in his and told me how beautiful I was.  I asked him to kiss
me, but he said he had other plans.  He pulled me away from the gravel road and
into the endless meadow.  I asked him what he had in mind, but he just put his
fingers on my lips, not answering me.  We walked for several minutes, until
all I could see around me was the beautiful meadow.  We were alone, once again,
and I was delirious, dreaming of the things to come.  He stopped walking, and
I gazed up at him.  His face was slightly damp from the hot sun radiating upon
him.  He looked down at me and kissed me lightly on my cheek.  I could feel the
softness of his lips remain there long after his mouth had touched me.  I ran
my small hands through his blond hair, wondering how such a beautiful creature
could be here with me.  He slipped his hands around my waist, holding me close
to him.  We were both silent, drunk in each other's beauty.  Suddenly, he lay
down in the meadow, hidden from sight by the tall grass.  He motioned to me to 
join him, and so I did.  We gazed up at the sky, studying the clouds.  He 
talked quietly, telling me of the shapes he saw in the sky.  Without my 
realizing it, he had been stroking my breasts through my thin shirt.  He rolled
over on top of me, supporting himself with one hand.  I looked up at him, 
searching his face for emotion, as he slowly unbuttoned my blouse.  He smiled
when he saw that I had neglected to wear a brassiere that day.  Taking in 
the beauty of my breasts, he fondled them gently.  His touch sent 
shivers through my small body, anticipating more.  He lowered his head to my
nipple, taking it in his mouth and sucking on it slightly.  He moved his hand
to my other breast, feeling the softness of it.  I moaned as he stopped kissing
my breast to meet my mouth.  I felt his soft tongue penetrate inside my mouth,
and I knew then that I was lost.  I could feel my soul intertwining with his
as his tongue went deeper inside my mouth.  He slowly sat up, putting his 
weight upon my hips.  He removed my shirt and tossed it to the side.  I watched
as he pulled his shirt off, too.  I reached out to pull him down again, but he
resisted.  He slipped my skirt off, drinking in the beauty of my body with his
eyes.  I tried to help him with his pants, but he pushed me down, unbuttoning
them himself.  He then laid down on top of me, kissing me passionately.  I 
could feel his cock growing hard next to my pussy.  I slowly felt my juices 
soaking my panties, and I think he realized it, too.  He moved his body 
downward, running his tongue across my breasts.  I drew in my breath as he 
tickled my stomach with his soft kiss.  My hips pushed up at him involuntarily,
and I felt him remove my soaked panties with his teeth.  He pulled them all
the way off, then moved back up my legs, breathing hotly on my thighs.  I 
moaned as he spread my legs to gaze at my pussy.  He saw me watching him and
he gave me a smile.  He slowly licked at my mound, bringing me sensations
that I had never felt before.  He softly nipped at my clit, bringing a small
pain that caused me to moan loudly.  I pushed my hips at his face, and he 
penetrated me with his tongue, holding my ass with his hands.  His pace 
quickened and I felt myself quickly coming to an orgasm.  Realizing that I was
about to come, he stopped suddenly and sat up.  Gasping loudly, my eyes widened
at the sight of his hard cock as he slipped his underwear off.  I moved my
hand to his cock, and stroked it lightly.  He looked at me, his eyes penetrating
to my mind.  He moved his body to my mouth, and I took his cock with my hands.
I kissed the tip lightly, sucking the skin as I teased it.  I massaged his
balls and brought him inside my mouth.  He pushed harder and I could feel the
tip at the back of my throat.  He moaned as I sucked harder and harder.  I 
could feel his semen rushing through his cock until it burst inside my mouth.
I swallowed the hot liquid, tasting the salty substance as it rolled back in
my throat.  He removed his cock from my mouth and leaned down to kiss me.  He
tasted himself on my mouth and smiled.  I looked at his still erect cock.  He 
saw me studying him and he raised an eyebrow as he moved himself down to lay
upon my body.  I felt his hot cock rub against my thighs and I moaned loudly.
A finger stimulated my clit as he kissed my breasts once more.  I felt myself
getting wet.  Noticing this, he took his cock and pushed it against my hole.
I pushed against it, squirming with the sensation in my pussy.  His cock 
entered inside me and I took all of it on the first penetration.  My pussy
muscles gripped him as he went in and out of me, slowly at first.  As he 
quickened his pace, I could feel the tip of his cock touch something deep 
inside me.  I felt like I was going to burst.  He fucked me at such an amazing
speed that I didn't think I could take much more.  But he didn't stop, and 
I came so suddenly that my breath left me.  It was the best orgasm I had ever
had.  But he didn't stop.  We were soon one, moving in perfect rhythem together.
His cock explored the inside of me, reaching places I hadn't known existed 
before.  I pushed against him, wanting him more and more.  We both came 
together, our orgasms stimulating each other even more.  He finally took his 
cock out of me and fell down next to me.  We both gasped for breath, laying 
naked in the meadow.  He began to talk quietly to me again, of the shapes he
saw in the clouds.
