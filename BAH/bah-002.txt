bah:

I'm bored. I'm sitting here, downstairs in the basement, on Friday,
listening to Depeche Mode's _People Are People_. My local
hacked Internet server is down for some strange reason, my favorite bbs in
this area has been ringing busy for five days now. I skipped sk00l today. I
thought I'd have a fun day telnetting into IRC and getting people's
accounts kicked off. But, no.

Let me first tell you people about BAH:

BAH (which is NOT a fucking acronym) was founded by Stone like, last week.
:) There's currently a total of a whopping three members, and *no* official
distro sites, whatsoever. In fact, I still haven't finished the viewer. So,
if you don't like that, fuck off. If you want to write for BAH, write. Find
a way to get a message to a BAH member, write a BAH file (it can be
about ANYTHING), and you're in BAH. Want to become a BBS distribution site?
Good. We need some. There's going to be a main BBS set up sometime soon,
but I can't say when. Again, get a message to me, and get the files
somehow. We need someone to draw a BAH ANSI, as well.

Stone:

I live in a somewhat boring city. The BBS's are all like 50 line 3-gig
shareware MajorBBS systems around, except for a few. There's like one local
good net, which is actually pretty good. We currently had no live
internet servers until about a month ago, when a few people with enough
money to do it started up a live server. It's not even public yet. There's
backdoors like, up the ass, over there. First, they picked *LYNX* as their
info menu for guests, which was not meant to be used for that purpose.
After the ! option was taken out, they put a *telnet* option in. ^] and
an exclamation point and you're at the prompt. That went on for a *long*
time, during which me and like 20 other people were messing around with the
.html files and put like 10 backdoors in. Well, by then, the sysadmins were
getting suspicious. (Wouldn't you, if you logged in, and saw 15 guests
online that have been there 2 hours?). I'm still playing this game
with these people, who probably have had no experience with running a
system of this type. They want to charge $35 a month. Which isn't THAT bad,
except you only get to use the system an hour a day. Now, I don't care who
you are, if you're like me, you can EASILY use the net for more than an
hour a day. I'm still trying to figure out how they can enforce that rule.
Well, more about this story in future BAH issues.

Tori Amos:

I'm thirteen years old. Lots of people don't like that. If you don't, then
fuck you.

Actually, I now call BBS's very little. The reason for that is explained
further in the next BAH. I'm not going out with anyone, but I'm not
"available". I have little interest in dating. My parents and most of my
friends think I belong in a mental institution. I sit in my room, program,
read, and listen to music. I rarely leave the house except to go to school.
No, I don't have Apathetic Feelings syndrome, or whatever they call that
disease said to be caused by marijuana, this is my lifestyle.

added by stone:
Tori's the strangest person I've ever met. :)

Infidel:

Infidel changes his handle every six months. :) Until recently, he was
Falcon, which lasted a while, but then he found this handle, and changed
it. He's not writing this because he's on vacation or something like that.
He lives in Ohio, while Stone and TA live in Belvidere, IL, a small town
close to Rockford. He likes programming, playing huge games, chatting on
#warez, getting warez, bullshitting people with hacked versions of PKZIP,
and other fun things. :)

well, like, bye.
