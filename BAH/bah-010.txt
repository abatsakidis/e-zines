This is another of the famous "i suck" BAHfiles.

why do we portray the internet as an untamed frontier?
why do we play games whilest we could be out saving the world?
why do we care about saving the world?
why do we listen to rap music?
why do we listen to music at all?
why do we play sega genesis?
why do we sit on IRC all day?
why do we crucify ourselves?    [Tori made me put that there:)]
why do we pay to sit on IRC all day? (why SHOULD we pay?)
why do we have a desire for knowledge?
why do we have desires?
why do we make fun of america online?
why do we make fun of the government?
why do we call ourselves hackers?
why do we draw ansis?
why do we courier warez?
why do we have warez?

why isn't all software free?
why isn't everything free?
why isn't everyone happy?

why aren't i making money?
why aren't i talented?
why aren't i doing something constructive?
why aren't i caring?
why aren't i listening to more popular music?
why aren't i cool?
why aren't i elite?
why aren't i smart?
why aren't i liked?

why don't i get invited to #warez?
why don't i stop writing this damn file?
why don't i write another one? (i think i will, btw)

why are we sitting here imposing our troubles on innocent beings like you?
why are we sitting here?
why are we writing this over the phone, instead of in person?
why are we who we are?

why is pleasure illegal?
why is anything illegal?
why is it the government who makes laws?

why?
why?
why?

Well, welcome to BAH #010. We're on summer break now, so we'll be putting
these out rapidly. We still need fucking writers, not people who say "ill
write something, what should i write?" We don't care. You get your name in
a cool file that gets pretty far in the world. That's good enough for most
people.

There were a few minor errors in previous BAHfiles that have been brought
to my attention:

BAH #008 contained a spelling error in the word "aggressive".
BAH #009's header mistakenly said BAH #008.

That's it. :)

Well, look for more BAHfiles out soon.

THE BAHFILES NOW HAS AN EMAIL ADDRESS!

For BAHfile requests, comments, flames, submissions, send it to
bahfiles@free.org. Stone's address is cstone@free.org. Infidel's address is
infidel@free.org. (we like free.org, believe me.) Tori doesn't have an
address, and she's made it clear that she's not getting one. For now.

We've made it this far, let's go for hundreds more.
