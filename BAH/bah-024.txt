i sit back and i see people promote technology. it's supposed to make this
world better. how great is it? i mean, really. people die. all day. every
day. people suffer and starve.

now, i'm not going to sit here and promote that 'save the world - feed
africa' bullshit. i'm not here to say that. i'm here to say that there's a
balance of equality in the world. if something gets better, something much
get worse. we're really no better off than we were two hundered years ago,
or two thousand. it's the same. and, as technology advances convience, the
world is worse off. the rainforest dies. ohwell. i'll die before it makes
THAT much of a difference, so i couldn't care less about 'saving the
world'. when i explain this to people, especially older people, i get asked
if i care about the world my children will live in. first of all, i have no
plans to have any children, ever, right now. i doubt my mind will change.

well, people, that's my 'attitude of the month'. fuck it all. i've now
adopted a habit from stone, i keep a magic bubble wand and a cup of
bubblemix all over the house, and, when something tries to piss me off, i
just sit back and blow bubbles. it's fun. and i play some happy-sounding
(sort of) music. sometimes i dance, if the music's cool. what's pissing me
off right now is that i have no idea what the fuck to write for this damn
thing. usually i can bring my cynical self into lots of hateful topics.
but, oh well. i wrote another one before this, and maybe i'll write another
soon.

it's my birthday today. happy, happy birthday to me.
