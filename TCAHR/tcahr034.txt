It's almost amusing.  Sometimes when you rant a mean streak for so long, you
end up running out of material without knowing it.  For the last two months,
I've had a less than half-finished and admittedly limp-dicked issue of TCAHR
taking up kilobytes.

I have no intention of me or my memes disappearing in into the void again.  It
seems to me that there's been a lot of loose typing hinting about this here
petri dish named the "textfile scene" being dead.  It also seems that some of
our ilk have upped and died themselves.  Now what kind of follower of Darwin
would I be if I just let TCAHR up and die; especially at this crucial juncture?
I should rejoice in the silence and apparent death of other e-zines if only for
the extended breeding space this gives to my own particular memes.

Go ahead.  Prove me wrong.

Seeing as our usual sources of inspiration have become scarce, TCAHR must seek
new sources of inspiration to devour or face its own death.  So I'm going to
offer the following two entries into the Polymemetic Textfile Project as I
analyse new prey.  I'll even be running about looking for other memeplexes
looking for contributors.  Come on, who needs a merc?

In other words, I'm not gone.  I'll be back when I find some interesting ideas
to sink my teeth into and bring back bleeding from the neck to drop at your
feet.

I.  Kids are Funny

    I trust no life-changing decisions from anyone under the age of 25.  In
    fact, I prefer to mock them from the advantage point of a few more years
    away from the rages of puberty.  I tend to be amused by their choices in
    careers, sexuality, politics, and religion (especially religion).  I am as
    amused by the 19-year old trust fund Wiccan Goth dispensing the wisdom of
    the ages as I am by the college feminist under the four-year lesbian plan.
    It is rare to find someone at 30 who is still in the thrall of the ideas
    which claimed them at the age of 20.

    I mock them, but I love them.  Perhaps the most enduring quality of youth
    is its gluttonous appitite for memetic experimentation.  It is the fire of
    blind passion they bring to it that troubles me.  Blind passion seems to be
    an inherent quality of a lack of experience.  This unchecked
    emotional-based exuberence is why extremists from both the right- and
    left-wing court them.  The young and idealistic make excellent cannon
    fodder for the causes of those possessing mature idealogies tempered by
    reason and reality.

II.  Spinal Re-Alignment

    I sincery believe that happiness can only be achieved by intense
    examination of your own world-view and to eliminate all distractions to
    that ideal.  Any TCAHR reader of some time has already encountered my
    obsession with Machiavelli, the Nietzschian ubermench, and memetic
    Darwinism.  My personal world-view revolves around this.  Do I believe my
    philosophy is superior?

    Of course I do!  Everyone follows whatever they personally believe to be
    superior.  You would have to be a moron to follow a morality that you are
    both unlearned and uncomfortable with.  The proper question is am I happy
    following my world-view with all the vigor of a ascetic monk?

    Of course I do!  If you hate the color purple, you don't paint your home in
    purple.  So if eating meat makes you uncomfortable, don't eat meat.  If you
    find sexual mores manipulative, don't have sex.  If you despise trashy
    television and movies, stop watching them.  If your friends annoy you to no
    end, dump them immediately!  Envoke upon yourself a sturdy backbone made of
    a code of honor and ethics, then use that spine to walk away and never look
    back.
