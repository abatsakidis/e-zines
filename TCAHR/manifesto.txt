    TCAHR is an evil organization dedicated to the memetic infection of the
    world. No, really, we are! To that end, the material within the TCAHR
    website, TCAHR correspondence, or TCAHR newsletters may contain elements
    which may be considered offensive or controversial. You have been warned.
    Don't come crying to TCAHR if you end up infected by our memes!

1.  Mission Statement

    To aid in the incubation, breeding, and release of butterflies in Asia.

2.  Origin 
    
    TCAHR was started in the hopes of releasing memes of interest to TCAHR into
    the datasphere. The thought processes behind the origin of TCAHR are not
    only based upon the concepts of memetics, but also steeped in Taoism and
    chaos theory. This, like all ideas, are subject to change.

3.  Philosophy

    The premise of TCAHR is to engender thought and discussion. To that end,
    TCAHR may create articles which may have questionable elements. TCAHR,
    however, will never give you the safe, wishy-washy article reeking of
    self-check and cowardliness.

    TCAHR does this in the belief that the right idea, infecting the right
    mind,can bring about changes in the world. Therefore we believe our
    opinions must be strong and truthful.

4.  Correspondence 

    All serious correspondence to TCAHR can and will receive a response. It may
    take us time, but e-mail to us will be answered. TCAHR may have posted
    articles in part for our amusement and/or the hope of affecting change, but
    we serve the potential hosts of those whom we wish to infect with ideas.

    If TCAHR can't read and return e-mail, risking infection by memes itself,
    then TCAHR has no right to attempt memetic infection.

5.  Manifesto

    This Manifesto is subject to change at any time.
