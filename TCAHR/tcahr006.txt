My rant on Gothic Racism received some feedback by someone
on "Darksites" (http://www.darksites.com) who *forgot* to
leave their name behind.  Seems I stand accused of trying to
subvert European culture and trying to turn Goth into a
Benneton Ad.

Yup, I am guilty of multiculturalism and of promoting memetic
infection into a subculture dying from starvation of ideas.
No, I am not guilty subverting European culture.  I am guilty
of subverting *all* cultures.  And yup, I'll do it again!  I
can't stop myself!  Please save me from trying to make the
world more inclusive and save Goth at the same time.

Never mind that all the elements are already there.  Forget
the heavy Jazz influence.  Forget the borrowing of various
world religions.  Forget the growing numbers of Goths into
Latin America and Asia.  What a fool I've been!  I mean, wow,
trying to turn Goth into a Benneton Ad.  That's some serious
shit.  

Like I said, I just can't stop myself.  And I have so many
other plans which will destroy the world.  I have an
overwhelming desire to make the Klu Klux Klan a
multicultural organization.  I want the Black Muslisms not
only to have white membership, I want them to have white
leaders.  I want to fill the landscape of the American
South with Buddhist and Hindu temples.  I want to see an
Israeli/German Hip-Hop group win awards from the Grammys
and The Source.

Please stop me before I try again.  I'm fucking crazy.
I've been interviewing people from the hood and from the
suburbs.  We're thinking of putting together the first
Goth/Gangsta Rap group ever.  I'm thinking "Black and
Blacker" for the album name.

So to whomever wrote that rant on Darksites, I'm sorry.  It
must have been the way I was raised.
