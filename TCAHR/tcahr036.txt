Seems I'm always doing something to assuage my eternal boredom.  I've done
articles, philosophical ranting, psuedo-corporate sounding sarcasm; so what's
next?  What can I do so I can get back to my studies quickly?

How about some writing ala stream of consciousness?  So I'm going to enter my
library, pick out three books at random, and then choose a random sentence
from each.  Perhaps I'll write something profound in twenty-five lines?

Yeah, right.  Let's just hope for something somewhat amusing.

    Now if I was still enraptured by the new-agey cult of stupidity that has
    tried to make itself seem more valid by ensnaring the sciences and their
    terminology I would say the Kabblah of Jewish Occultism is the original
    inspiration for the morphogenetic fields which the "intellectuals" of the
    raver scenes are so fond of paying lip service to.  It's either that or
    the tired collective subconscious that Jung came up with.  Now I think we
    humans have advanced to the point where even the most average dimbulb of
    us all can go ahead and put two and two together.  I may be wrong, but
    let's just take that for granted.  If I see a statue of a woman being
    worshipped and this statue is surrounded by fruits, plants, and whatnot.
    If the color red is predominate and the female form is voluptious with
    motifs of nature incorporated into it, I think the average human is quite
    capable of deducing that the statue is that of a fertility deity.
    Artifacts in India, England, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and the United States all
    have skulls and skeletions as symbols of death.  Do we have give some
    overdone answer as why different cultures around the world share this
    symbol of death?  Or would it make more sense to believe that the general
    knowledge that comes from knowing that to see one's skeletion that person
    usually has to be dead?  No, that would be too simple an answer!  We
    instead must invoke the metaphysical realm.  Why else must fractals,
    chaotic math, and quantum theory be linked to the I Ching, Tarot, Kablah,
    Wicca and other nonsense?  I am amazed that the logical answer is almost
    universally hated by some.  Let's take one of my Halloween examples.  As
    a goof, I was reading Tarot cards for people on Halloween.  A group of
    teenagers came up to me asking for a reading.  After it, they proclaimed

    The silly greys were at it again.  Now for some reason that the villagers
    could never figure out, some of the greys were found of calling themselves
    white while the other were found of calling themselves black.  While it was
    true that some of the greys were a shade or two darker that some of the
    that considered themselves white, there were some grey that shades lighter
    than some "white" greys that were considered "black".  Not only would there
    be fighting among the "whites" and "blacks", but there would be infighting
    between the two groups.  The various shades of greys of the "black" camps
    would argue about what it really meant to be black as "whites" feared
    contamination of their camp from uncover blacks within their mists.  The
    squabbles between them worked like an emotional virus infecting the
    previously uninvolved (and previously uninterested) villagers spreading
    anger and hatred within the usually peaceful village. Soon the troubles
    within the village were recounted by a passing merchant to a former knight
    living in a village twelve miles over.  The knight dressed himself in the
    garb of a magician and travelled towards the village.  Anyway, he reached
    the village and began to spread rumors of his ability to solve even the
    most difficult problems quickly and efficently.  Of course, these rumors
    reached the greys whose two camps sent for the disguised knight's help.
    The knight sent word to the "blacks" and "whites" to assemble in the
    village hall. By the time the knight finished the greys were all one color:
    the red of the blood that stained their garments and bodies completely.
    The village, shocked at first, eventually forgot that day, the greys, the
    knight, everything.  In time, the peaceful village even forgot why the
    village hall floor was stained a dark brownish-red.  As you can see, peace

    I've had it with the Buffalo Commons.  I couldn't make my way to the subway
    train with having some goddamn horned, shaggy buffalo get in my way.  Today
    was no different as a herd of buffalo were sleeping right in front of the
    turnstile.  My yells of "fuckin' buffalo" were met by sounds that I could
    of sworn were snickers if I believed buffalos were capable of laughter.  I
    kicked at one particularly fat sons of a bitch until he slowly moved out of
    the way.  I punched my farecard into the slot and ran down the stairs, just
    missing my train by seconds.  I finally made it to work where my entrance
    was greeted by my supervisor.  "Harris, clean out your desk!"  I couldn't
    handle it anymore.  I don't even remember grabbing the coffeepot and
    braining my former boss with it.  Then I found myself here.  The
    psychologist stroked his Freudian beard as I told my story.  He then began
    to tell me the story of the buffalo which every school kid in the Commons
    knows.  He told me about how the buffalo used to live all throughout this
    area.  How humans began to kill them all off.  How the buffalo were nearly
    wiped out and how now we and the buffalo live in perfect environmental
    harmony.  I then told him "Fuck you and the fucking buffalo!"  What the
    hell do I care about environmental harmony?  Does my SUV show my concern
    for the environment?  I don't need biodiversity in my food choices; just
    give me my corn, rice, and wheat and I'll be fine.  Keep your blasted tofu
    to yourself.  I care about as much for the buffalo, as I do for a ham
    sandwich!  And quite frankly doctor...I'm beginning to wonder what one of
    those hairy bastards tastes like.  The doctor shudder before he told me he
    was sending me to sensitivity classes.  I was wheeled back to my room and
    chained to the bed.  As I sat there, I marvelled at how our species worked
