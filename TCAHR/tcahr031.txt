     Missing you forever, my favourite story in the comic book in my hand
     in the comic store on the counter, now in his hand and five dollars in
     mine out in the parking lot.

     Five dollars and hours later, my transmuted childhood rolled and lit, 
     hand to mouth and hand to hand to hand as music plays and the mental 
     landlord evicts old memories for defaulting on the rent.

     Five comics later, gasping for air, my euphoric mind in a body in a 
     smoky cloud in a Malibu Classic in the middle of a field on the
     outskirts of town.

     Nights and days and nights, without school, without sense, a trail 
     leading backward to the car, the smoke, the five, the comic, and
     forward  to the grave.

     And, for a moment, I slide into a pocket, shielded by denim that is
     only beginning to fray.

S1 Tyra slammed open my office door and tossed the requisition orders on my
desk.  One look at the price and I burst out laughing.

"I am not putting this on the projects account.  You were the first to pull
out a pistol.  Besides the scar on your cheek is quite charismatic!"

She just glared at me through black horn-rimmed glasses.  I was getting annoyed
by the glare; I'd been getting nothing but glares since Tyra, Charrest, and I
got into our little gunfight.  Being friends, Tyra and me went for flesh wounds.
That dirty son-of-a-bitch Charrest, who's been gunning for the position of Jet
Jaguar since TMO school, made it personal.  He went for a head shot; I moved
while shooting and the bullet meant for Tyra's shoulder grazed her cheek.

The fat bastard came waddling in just as I was thinking about him.  Today was
not my day.

"Tyra," he nodded in her direction. "Di--"

I banged my fist on the desk, knocking my Genghis Khan action figure to the
floor.

"It's Jet.  Jet Jaguar.  I expect the proper respect my title deserves."

"I should have been the Jet--"

"Go ahead.  Finish that thought," I said as I stood up with my SIG P210 in my
other hand.  I knew that he would be distracted from my unholstering of my
weapon when I hit the desk.  Predictable; that's why he wasn't the new Jet
Jaguar.

His jowls shook delightfully as he involuntarily swallowed.

"Now Agent Tyra and me were discussing business.  I have no particular wish to
be spied upon just right now.  You should work at home today."

I squeezed the trigger slightly so he wouldn't confuse my words as a request.
He left the office walking backwards; never turning his back on me.  I
reholstered and turned on the intercom as soon as he was gone from the
adjoining reception room.

"Initiate operation Shock Therapy," I spoke into the intercom.  I then got up,
stretched and made my way to the balcony.  "Tyra, come here.  I think you'll
like this."

We watched as Charrest walked toward black 2001 Lexus.  I hated that car.  It
was too flashy for our business.  What kind of revolutionary drives a luxury
car?  No matter...

The explosives obliterated the Lexus just before Charrest entered the kill
zone.  He flew back and to the ground as the combat medic I had waiting in
downstairs lobby ran to him.  A few seconds later, the med flashed me a thumbs
up.  I leaned across the balcony.

"WHAT'S MY NAME NOW, BITCH?" I yelled down to a prone Charrest.

I turned to see the expression on Tyra's face, but she wasn't there.  Only then
did I realize my hip felt a lot lighter.  My P210 was gone.  I whirled around to
find myself staring down the barrel of my gun.  Absent-mindedly, I realized it
needed cleaning.

"Why don't you come here and sign off on these requisition forms now?"

I signed my name, my real name, onto the sheet of paper on my desk.  With a
flash of teeth, she tossed my now unloaded pistol to me.

"Remember, Jaguar," she sneered through large black-lipsticked lips, "You may
have come in first at Mission Officers Training school, but I was a very, very
close second."

We both laughed as she headed out of the office.  I walked over to the
bullet-proof door and locked it.  The smile on face was gone as soon as I heard
the click of the deadbolt.  I then began to work on the new polymemetic textfile
entries, troubled by my own sense of mortality and predictability.

     I.    Too Dark to be American
     II.   War Markings
     III.  The Master Race
     IV.   Black Arrogance
     V.    Come Together
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

I.  Too Dark to be American

    I have absolutely no sense of grief or compassion concerning the attacks on
    New York on September 11th.  Nor am I filled with a sense of warhawkish
    patriotism.  For me, the United States is just another playground bully who
    cries for his mother after receiving his first and well-deserved bloody
    nose.  I can't be one of the Great Grieving American Collective, but I can
    understand how White middle- and upper-class American citizens can.  This is
    not my war and no amount of media propaganda will make it my war.  America
    is their home, where the established systems of politics and society make
    their way of life better.

    But for me and other minorities, this land is nothing more than a police
    state.  Some of us can't walk outside without being gawked at by a passing
    police car.  Popular culture characterizes Latinos as jiggling lotharios,
    Blacks as iconoclastic criminals, and before the war, people from the Middle
    East as funny brown people working at the local 7-Eleven.  Minorities need
    laws enacted just to get the same shitty middle management jobs as a white
    person, then we have to hear white people in government and media complain
    about the unfairness of it.  I cannot be patriotic for a country that
    treats me like this in peacetime.

    I am still a second-class citizen because my skin color marks me as
    different.  Therefore, I am not a true citizen and have no obligation to
    shed one tear or bleed one drop of blood for the United States of America.

II.  War Markings

    I don't know what is is about humans that make them hate "The Other" so
    much.  Perhaps it's the convenience of physical differences that make for
    easy identification of targets.  During the Rodney King-L.A. riots, people
    in the predominantly Black ghettos turned on the people around them would
    looked least like them: the Asians.  I believe about 90% of all Asian
    businesses in the ghettos were destroyed.  Those ghettos are merely
    microcosms of the nation at large.  "The Other" may be tolerated during
    peaceful times, but always despised in times of great anger.

    So imagine what it is like to be dark-skinned in America right now.  Middle
    America is absolutely clueless on who they're fighting.  People are running
    about thinking "Muslim" is a race of brown-skinned people.  It doesn't
    matter if you're Christian or Muslim, Afghani or Indian, you are a
    "brown-skin" and therefore perfect for visual targeting.  The great and
    noble average American citizen seems to have forgotten that along with
    hassling people from the Middle East, they've also been kicking Latino
    "brown-skins" off planes as well!  Perhaps I'm dense, but could someone
    give me a reasonable explanation on the connection of an extremely Catholic
    Ethnicity such as Latinos have to do with a state-sponsored terrorist
    organization centered in the Middle East.

    This new form of American racism is going to be the thing that makes America
    vulnerable.  While everyone chases down those evil brown-skinned "Muslims",
    blue-eyed and white-skinned fanatics will be left alone to do more damage.
    If and when that happens, you can be sure that I will watching the news and
    laughing my ass off at another example of American arrogance gone wrong.

III.  The Master Race

    Since I touched America originally being built by White Americans for White
    Americans, I feel I have to write a few words for those very special
    Americans who have made it there mission in life to stop anyone from
    changing this status quo.

    I don't know what it is about the particularly European meme that progress
    is an upward journey toward a sterilized world.  White supremacists jump on
    that meme and believe that sterilization is done by eliminating the "mud
    races".  These people seem to be the same ones who bitch about minorities
    taking their rights and jobs.  The following is addressed to them.
    
    If this is your argument, you must be fucking morons.  The established
    memes of American society and the techniques to governmental power are
    weighed in *your* favor.  They have always been in *your* favor.  If you
    personally feel you are "losing" your rights and jobs in this system, you
    must be the most inept and ridiculous examples the "Master Race" has to
    offer.

    One time as I was walking out of an Alice Cooper concert, I saw an old man
    sitting on a trash can wearing a White Power T-shirt.  He was drunk, dirty,
    and the T-shirt was full of holes.  I remember thinking then what I'm
    thinking now; if this what the white supremacists movement has to offer, the
    world at large is safe!

IV.  The Black Man's Arrogance

    Let me now turn my attention to another race in America that needs a good
    slap on the head.  You would hope that African-Americans, through all
    they've been through in this country, would rise to become the leaders for
    minority causes in America.  Unfortunetly, it seems they can't rise above
    petty squabbles of color.

    Black people in American act as if their ancestors were the only slaves in
    the world.  There have been slaves and slaveowners of all colors and all
    nationalities.I marvel at the stupidity of this "slave pride" due to my own
    heritage.  Part of my ancestory can be traced back to African slaves whose
    boat stopped in the Caribbean.  In America, Blacks tend to act as if
    the ancestors of Latinos didn't experience the hardships of those in America.
    
    This is absolute nonsense.  On the island of Puerto Rico, slaveowners used
    to put Black slaves into something akin to a barrel with a hinged lid.  This
    barrel was then tossed in the water where the slave would stay in isolation
    for days.  Does this sound like a picnic in the tropics to anyone?  By the
    way, there were whips and chains in the Caribbean too!

    Instead of collective bitter whining about slavery and other injustices in
    the past, it's time to live in present times.  Personally, I could care less
    about the past if it is not viable.  The Black man in America should take a
    note from Black men all over the world.  If you want greater political
    power, reach across the racial aisle and say hello to the person with the
    same color skin, but different language.  Hell, be innovative and reach
    across to the person with different color skin and same language.  Work
    together to break the systems that are in place *now*, not the ones that
    died 50, 100, or 400 years ago.

    You want equality?  Work for it.

V.  Come Together

    Unlike the United States, Latin American Blacks and Whites have come
    together.  I realize that sounds like a wild claim, especially to those
    living in the "Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave", who have been
    struggling with race problems since the beginning.  Look at the coat of arms
    in Latin American countries and you will find symbols that celebrate our
    tri-heritage: we are African, European, and Native Americans.  In countries
    where everyone has an African, European, or Native American ancestor, racism
    is a mark of stupidity and self-delusion.

    Why can't a great superpower full of resources do the same?  Beyond White
    control systems and Black slave mentalities, there are answers.  I'm not
    trying to ignore all the other races and ethnicities in the United States,
    but the feud between Blacks and Whites is easily the most bitter race feud
    in America.  If the problems between these two groups are not settled, no
    one else's will.  Again, the Asians in the L.A. riots know this more than I.

    Finally, I realize that in discussions about race that there is a tendancy
    to yell out "White" and "Black" as broad labels.  We should never forget
    that there have always been those willing to stand up for "The Other".  You
    all have always been my cousins, brothers, sisters, comrades,
    negros, negras, vatos, hermanos, hermanas, and homies.
