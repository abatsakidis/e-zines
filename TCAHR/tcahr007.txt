Cain and Abel                                       11/26/00
------------------------------------------------------------
(Genesis 4:3 - 4:5): While Cain was sweating and working his
     ass out in the fields, Abel was raising sheep, cows, and
     such.  During a time of offering to YWHW, Cain brought
     some of the fruit he worked months on growing, weeding,
     and harvesting.  Abel killed some animals and burnt
     the fat as his offering.  YHWH, being the loving deity
     He is, preferred the slaughter and burning of His
     beloved animals to the products of a man's hard work.
     Naturally, Cain was pissed.

(Genesis 4:6 - 4:8): YHWH, being totally insensitive to
     Cain's months of work and forgetting how awe-inspiring
     the rebuttal by a god can be, began to chew Cain's ass
     off. Equating the murder of helpless animals with
     goodness and equating sacrifices of hard labor as
     sinful, YHWH told Cain he should master sin.

So Cain, filled with the instruction and love of the Lord,
killed his brother.

Strangely enough, the all-seeing, all-knowing YHWH was
conspiciously absent during the murder.  YHWH, a.k.a. God,
has yet to come in for questioning.
