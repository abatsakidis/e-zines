I.  Definition Time

    Back when I used to publish verse online, I would receive e-mail from some
    teens that would make me cringe.  They were usually young poseurs of the
    goth, Satanist, or anarchist variety.  Without going into details, every time
    I got one of these violent, iconoclastic e-mails proclaiming my greatness, I
    realized that my ideas had been misunderstood yet again.  Since TCAHR is
    about infecting ideas into new hosts, I find myself worried about those
    potential hosts who would snatch a tid-bit of badly written ranting from
    here and then proclaim themselves memeticists.

    I'm even more frightened of those who would attach the label "socialists" to
    themselves.  Therefore please indulge my following tangent into definitions.

    CAPITALISM -- Economic system based on the production and exchange of goods
                  and services through prices and markets.

    COMMUNISM  -- System of society where major resources and means of
                  production are owned by the people.  In communism, the ideal
                  is one where a visible government would be unnecessary.
                  Until that utopia is reached, private property is suspended.
                  The needs of the people are the responsibility of the state.

    SOCIALISM --  Economic system in which the means of production are invested
                  in the state by reconstruction of the existing political
                  system through the peaceful and democratic means.

    Those are the basics.  Now let's go on.

II.  Re-tooling in the 19th century

    Capitalism may have its beginnings in the 18th century, but it was in the
    19th century the problems with a pure capitalist system began to come into
    focus.  Private ownership of the means of production lead to abuse of the
    workers.  This manifested in phenomena such as long work hours, dangerous
    conditions and child labor.  Corporations also came into being, along with
    their attempts to create monopolies.  Capitalism was also prone to
    alternating waves of prosperity and depression.

    Those with financial power fought bitterly against any changes to the pure
    capitalist system.  It is a fact that capitalism has, in general, improved
    the standard of living in the world.  However, in the pursuit of money big
    business argued with the powerful government in the courts while employing
    tactics such as "strike-busters" to spill the cranial fluids of the
    striking worker on the streets.  Believing its problems solved, capitalism
    marched its way into the 20th century only to have its progress tripped by
    the alternating tsunami known as the Great Depression.

III.  The Great Fuck-Up

    The genesis of The Great Depression was in the 1920s.  After the first world
    war, people turned from social issues and instead resolved themselves to
    lives of material enjoyment.  Businesses jumped on the new trends and used
    the advertising methods developed to promote support for the war against
    frugality.  At the same time, the low wages paid to workers and the tax cuts
    given to the rich resulted in a greatly unequal distribution of wealth.
    This meant that consumers weren't able to buy all the new and expensive
    toys of the Jazz Age.  Credit was invented to "help" them.  All these
    factors led to the Great Depression which eventually spread to all
    industrialized nations.

    The president at the beginning of the Great Depression was Herbert Hoover,
    or as I like to call him, the fuckin' idiot.  Not only did the fuckin'
    idiot refuse governmental aid to the unemployed and the homeless and sent
    federal troops armed with bayonets and tear gas against protesting WWI
    veterans, but he also RAISED TAXES!  It doesn't take a lot of brainpower to
    realize that you don't raise taxes when 15 million people are out of work.
    Then the fuckin' idiot RAISED TARIFFS which led to other nations raising
    tariffs.

    Naturally in the next presidential election Hoover was smashed by America's
    first "socialist" president.

IV.  Mr. Roosevelt
    
    Mr. Franklin Delano Roosevelt may have been born a rich kid, but he had a
    poor man's soul.  When elected to the presidency, he didn't talk about
    crossing political lines.  He did it by installing republicans and democrats
    into positions of power.  During the depression, Hoover (read as "the
    fuckin' idiot") would try to bring relief to the states by loaning them
    federal money, thereby incurring more debt.  Mr. Roosevelt's plan was to
    give money to the states instead (FERA - Federal Emergency Relief
    Administration).  During the first winter of his presidency, work relief
    could be found thanks to the CWA (Civil Works Administration).

    In 1935, the WPA (Works Projects Administration) replaced FERA and began to
    give work to one-third of the unemployed.  This consisted of work that could
    still be of benefit today.  The WPA workers built among other things, roads,
    schools, hospitals, airports, and parks.  It also funded work projects for
    artists that in turn performed for the public.

    The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) not only gave unemployed and unmarried
    young men jobs, but was dedicated to the conservation of natural resources.
    Many of America's state parks, fire-observation towers, and reforestation
    programs have their beginnings here.  The National Youth Administration
    (NYA) created jobs for high-school and college students at their very own
    schools.

    Then there was the TVA.  The Tennessee Valley Authority program was set in
    place to protect the Tennessee Valley from flooding while supplying the area
    with electricity.  The TVA generates power for 207,000 sq. kilometers and
    serves 7 million people.  The TVA also researches agricultural,
    environmental, and industrial programs.  Of course, businessmen from
    private-power companies attacked this as evil, un-American socialism.

    Mr. Roosevelt, the evil un-American socialist, also installed Social
    Security to alleviate the problems caused by unemployment, old age, and
    physical disability.  THAT BASTARD!

    I would love to credit Mr. Roosevelt's programs with saving the United
    States, but I would be a liar.  If Mr. Roosevelt would have listened to
    John Maynard Keynes, who advocated more government spending to spur on
    the economy, the depression would have been ended earlier.  Instead, the
    collective butt of the American financial institution was saved by World
    War II.  Well, if F.D. Roosevelt didn't save America, I can at least
    credit him by saying he put humanity back into capitalism.

V.  Notes to the Modern Socialist

    So what can today's socialists around the world take out of America's Great
    Depression?  First of all, America has and still does incorporate socialist
    programs.  This has been achieved according to socialist doctrine instead of
    diving into the violence by which communist doctrine is usually put into
    play.  I consider the United States the King of Capitalism, and even this
    king must apply socialism to protect its finances.  If it can be done in
    this arrogant, slow-moving, block-head of a nation, it can be done in other
    capitalist nations.

    This puts socialists (And by socialists I mean those who vote, act, and
    disseminate information, not the kiddies call themselves socialist to shock
    their mothers and anger their fathers.) in a defense position.  Not only
    must we act in a way that promotes our political system, but we must
    protect the gains we have already made.  Mr. Roosevelt made a lot of
    enemies who set out to destroy many of his programs as soon as they milked
    out the advantages.  Where are the CCC and NYA now?

    Bush made a called for volunteerism, but how can you devote your life to
    self-sacrifice in a capitalist system?  It is far better to organize a
    military-style program like the CCC with government funding than to expect
    people to lose money and time in a country that promotes wealth and
    egocentric pleasure above all.  The military is filled with the unskilled
    poor while the Peace Corps is suited to those who already have a college
    education.  Create a middle ground like the CCC and let the poor choose
    whether they wish to be killers or healers.

    I know, I know.  It will never happen.

    I am realistic enough to believe there will never be a bloody revolution
    against the capitalist system.  This is alright with me; a revolution
    willing to kill its enemies needs little encouragement to kill its most
    problematic supporters.  Besides, how can I say I hate capitalism as I type
    this on a Pack Bell running Windows 98 while smoking Camel cigarettes?  It
    is not the role of the socialist in a capitalist society to destroy the
    financial system; it is our role to protect humanity from the dangers
    inherent in the capitalist system.

    Socialism and capitalism are uneasy partners.  We all better get used to it.

Damn, I'm tired.  The polymemetic textfile project takes a lot out of me.  I
realize that it seems like ranting off the top of my head, but in actuality this
stuff takes a lot of research.

Not that I really mind.  Since starting the polymemetic textfiles project, I've
received more mail than I ever had.  Most of these say I'm might be going over
the edge a tad bit, but since the PTP has resulted in correspondence of either
memetic agreement, evolution, or total disagreement, I have to believe that
TCAHR is finally doing the job it was designed to do.

But, damn, I'm tired...

Therefore I am taking a one issue break from the PTP to either introduce another
project I have in the works or write an old-school issue.  See you all in about
two weeks.
