Yo.

This is, like, the really intellectual and philosophical part of the zine,
where I, like, explain to y'all my deep and fervent desire to make
passionate love to a goat's butt and how it makes me feel as a person that
I have not yet fufilled it.

Let's start from the grassroots. There are two things that make a man:

1) A phallus
2) The rectum of a goat *on* one's phallus

Unless you have *both* of these - you will never, *never* be a REAL MAN!

While I can't say that I'm completely certain *why* a man is made up of
these two particular things, as far as philosophical "what makes a man?"
theories go, I figure it makes as much sense as any.

And, now, dear readers, you can understand the trauma that is my life. The
neverending suffering that hounds me day and night, the knowledge that I
am but *half* a man without access to a goat.

Ummmmm... yeap...

Hi all, and welcome to the super-special Good Friday the Thirteenth
edition of Forbidden Knowledge. I promised you a good issue for release on
this date and I lied. Get over it.

Umm, like, enjoy the zine, or something.
Wizdumb.

< Things I said I'd do last issue that I didn't  >

Oops. I still haven't gotten that info together for mdma.za.net/dialup or
done the survey. Gah, I have a full-time job now, leave me alone. I'll do it
sometime.

< The complete ugliness of the ICMP protocol >

ICMP redirects are Satan's tool, and they are *way* too fun to allow on
your network. fBSD users can sysctl -w net.inet.icmp.drop_redirect to 1 to
quickly disallow redirects. If you're protecting a whole network, I
suggest you firewall out all ICMP packets except types 0 (echo reply), 3
(destination unreachable) and 8 (echo request), as well as imposing a
bandwidth limit on ICMP (fBSD: sysctl -w net.inet.icmp.icmplim=pps). If you're
hardcore, just firewall out ICMP completely, because it's an ugly, ugly
protocol and an insult to your leetness.

< What FK wants from you by Wizdumb  >

I don't get paid to make FK or anything, I'm just a loser with nothing better
to do, so please, any support you can offer the zine is much appreciated.
We need two things

<*> Articles :(

I get a lot of people asking me "Wizdumb, can I write an article on blah
blah blah" and I don't get many articles. :-/ You do *not* need to clear
your ideas with me first - you may write an article on any insane shit you
like and if it's good/funny/terrible-but-fine-for-FK then we'll publish it.

I like getting articles in vanilla .txt's coz if you give me Word documents
I just run them through strings to humanize them anyway.

We're dumb as hell, and can't code for shit, so if you want to submit any
appys we'll publish them if they're even *vaguely* interesting. Programming
tutorials are also very welcome as long as it's not a "How to write your
first program in X" type-tutorial, try for something a bit more in-depth.

Fuq, guys, you know we have no standards - just send in your stuff damnit. :)

<*> An ASCII Artist :(

Like, that Cyberphreak guy, like, doesn't love us anymore or something. We
need some-one who's decent at ASCII art to design us some logos and/or an
interface for the zine. Anyone?

[Introduction]

Firstly, this isn't about instant, root-in-one-pass, breaking and
entering. This isn't going to let you run out and crack a hundred
machines the minute you've finished reading... in fact, unless
you're doing security consulting, or have a specific target in
mind, it's unlikely that you'll find this of much use.

Still interested? Good.

Briefly, what I'm going to touch on is the potential that the
widespread use of Java has offered to those of you that find
themselves on the one of the many corporate nets that use custom,
networked Java software. Specifically, you'll find a brief
overview of the reconstruction of serialized Java objects from
sniffer logs, along with some necessary references.

[Details]

One of the really nice features of Java for developers, is that
it supports object serialization, allowing you do such funky
things as saving objects to disk, passing them around the network
between different machines and generally making a programmers
life that little bit more simple.

As with any new technology, the potential pitfalls of poorly
implemented systems are not well known. The end result of this
is that you may find on some, otherwise secure, networks, that
this might provide an alternative method of access to company
systems, or information.

Additionally, the serialization of Java objects also allows
one to run complex network applications over firewalls and the
like, by enabling one to send serialized objects via HTTP back
and forth between various clients, servers, and peers. Again,
this can occur over the HTTP protocol (NOT just TCP/80), enabling 
these applications to work over even proxy-level application aware
firewalls, making this a great method for developing software
for large corporate networks.

What I'd like to do first, is point you to a reference that will
describe, in detail, the specifications for the serialization of
Java objects: 
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/serialization/spec/serialTOC.doc.html

The packets below were captured and printed using Ethereal. If you
don't already have it, get it! You'll find it more than useful
in learning about low-level implementation details for just about
*ANY* network protocol.

Ok, now that you have the info, here's an example of a Java client/
server application that uses message objects, and, surprise surprise,
one of the uses of these objects is to send login requests to the
server.

The first packet (several deleted for brevity):

Ok, the first thing you are going to look for is 0xACED. This
is the magic stream indicator. In most cases, the proceding word
will be 0x0005, which is the version number.

Following this will be the serialized object, which in basic
format, is usually a description of the object, followed by the
associated data.

The first bye of interest is 73, which is the object indicator.
(Java supports the serialization of simple data types, in
addition to complex classes).

This is followed by 72, the CLASSDESC marker, and a 16 bit int
indicating the length of the description to follow, in this case
0x0029.

The next 0x0029 bytes will contain the descriptor, in this case
"net.eye2eye.distiller08.core.udsc.Message".

After this we have a flag byte, indicating whether the object
in question is serializable, externalizable or none of the above.
In this case we have 0x01, SC_WRITE_METHOD set.

Now the basic format of each element is a marker ('L' for object,
'I' for integer, 'B' for byte, etc), followed by the 16bit length
indicator of the description of that element, and so on and so
forth until we reach the TC_NULL indicator (0x70).

Noticing some interesting elements in this object: sessionId,
userId, pass, userName... anything looking interesting yet?

Ok, now proceding out the actual data associated with this object,
we start seeing some data. The 0x74 (t) that occurs at 0x01AF marks
the beginning of a string. We see that the string is 0x0d long, and
can grab out the string 'evil128dh12d7'. Noting back to the beginning,
this is the string associated with 'pass'.

Carrying on after this we hit 0x73 's' - indicating another object.
This is followed by 0x72 'r' - the classdescription, and same format
of data as for the class that we are already disecting.

We can quickly build up a list of elements and their associated entities
for this nested object, and then carry on with the elements of the
parent object.

If you noted above, the last object to be referenced prior to the 
TC_NULL marker, was userName (see 0x0195 to 0x01A4). By the way, object
references are usually created from 0x007E0000, so if you notice
the bytes 0x007E????, chances are you've spotted an object reference.

Well, rather than scanning through everything, we look to the end of
the object, noting to 0x70 'p' TC_NULL terminator, and work our way
back to spot the string associated with userName - 'administrator'.
Yay! :)

Unfortunately for us, if we bothered capturing the two way communication,
the response below from the server would show us that that particular
login attempt had failed:

Appendix A of the specifications should give you other ideas of
the dangers inherent in this protocol, e.g. modification of
in-transit data, session hijacking (at a Java application level as
well as TCP level), sending objects containing your own code
spoofed so as to be from a 'trusted' source, et al. If you can get
a system to use you as a transparent proxy, a nice tool to play
with is ELZA from http://www.stoev.org.

Have fun ;)

  .o (( Blackhole TCP/UDP behaviour and its effect on nmap by Wizdumb )) o.
 -//--**--//--xx--//--**--//--xx--//--**--//--xx--//--**--//--xx--//--**--//-

FreeBSD has certain variables in the kernel which can be modified by the
super-user with sysctl (I have not been able to check other BSDs yet, but
it's likely that they have similar functionality).

The net.inet.tcp.blackhole and net.inet.udp.blackhole values determine wether
the machine should send RSTs to SYNs sent to closed ports (TCP) and wether it
should send ICMP error messages to UDP packets sent to closed ports (UDP).

We turn our machine into a blackhole like so...

# Now
[root@pentacle]# sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.blackhole=2
net.inet.tcp.blackhole: 0 -> 2
[root@pentacle]# sysctl -w net.inet.udp.blackhole=1
net.inet.udp.blackhole: 0 -> 1
# And forever
[root@pentacle]# echo net.inet.tcp.blackhole=2 >> /etc/sysctl.conf
[root@pentacle]# echo net.inet.udp.blackhole=1 >> /etc/sysctl.conf

This breaks nmap quite nastily.

First of all, this changes your OS fingerprint, and nmap doesn't recognise
your OS. Only SYN scans work (and they work really slowly), UDP scans get
slower and slower, FIN, NUL, and XMAS scans report all TCP ports as filtered
or closed, and OSScans whine for ages, and then print each line of the OS
fingerprint 2 or 3 times, or only print a fragment of the print.

Neat, eh?
See `man blackhole` for more details of this functionality.

Steps to get root and extend time limit:

1. get R5 and deposit it (we must still pay the initial amount <DAMN>)
2. find a site that requires basic authentication
    - i used the official fk site, how ironic! :) -
    [Wizdumb: You said "ironic". I now have no choice but to kill you :P ]
3. click on the site and it will open a new internet explorer! without
   cyberXpress modifications! just press cancel and stop.
4. in address bar type c:\  and voila! Ro0t <wo0p>!
5. you are automatically logged in as a administrator! DUMB
6. open regedit.exe goto HKEY_CURRENT_USER\software\CyberXpress\time
   and in the timelimit entry field you will see somtn like 320
7. wait till your time runs out, that means timelimit = 1.
   you will notice that the keyboard has been locked...
   but you will still be in explorer.
   now find a number somewhere (preferably a high # like 5 or so)
   and copy it.
   paste it numerous times in the timelimit field in the regestry!
   somtn like 555555 this means 55hours 55min 55sec!
8. now goto taskmngr.exe in c:\winnt\system32\ and you will
   see cyberXpress running
   end task cyberXpress and wait a minute or two...
   the system should reboot by itself! :P
   and when it has started enjoy your 55 hours of free internet.
9. as you will notice anyting can be done like
   telnet,ftp,free printing :P
10. the cyberXpress will pop up so every 20min...
    to make sure your still online
    because your not using their browser.
    if this happens simply click on the auth site
    a number of times to get it at the top again. :)

there are a few other things i've also discovered.
if you are in the cyberXpress browser.

press:
ctrl+shift+F6  .... cyberXpress debug logon
ctrl+shift+F10 .... cyberXpress cashUp restart
ctrl+shift+F11 .... cyberXpress cashUp logon
ctrl+shift+F12 .... cyberXpress administrator logon

i've found some passwords in c:\cyberXpress\text\cashuppw.txt and in
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\software\cyberXpress\admin
but i phEaR it Is Ele3t0 xor encryption or smtn uncrackable :P

the password field in the dialup is saved in so with any tool like
snadboy or smtn you could easily get it! <whoop>

if you decide to publish this lame exploitation of goverment and corporate
shit that try to rob us of our basic neccesities and even letting us pay for
it... then i would appreciate it if you could just mention my name (Plunk3tt).

;p cheers!

[ Amendment by Wizdumb:

I'm not sure about the "//" bug I described last issue, but CyberXpress
definately haven't fixed the HTTP basic authentication bug described by
plunk3tt in this article. What they have done is blocked www.mdma.za.net/* on
their kiosks because it's what plunk3tt used to cause the error. Of course,
CyberXpress are forgetting the other few million sites that will cause the
same error, but I don't care, the fact that my domain is already banned on
ZA's first internet kiosks secretly makes me feel cool. ;-P ]

I wanted to have a small cryptographic filesystem on my BSD box, so I
could feel all leet n stuff, but I hadn't seen any kernel hacks for crypto
fs's for fBSD anywhere, and even if *could* find one, it seemed a bit gay to
bloat my kernel for a crypto-fs that I'm not gonna use that often, and I
fuqn hate modules.

So this is the dodgy stupid hack I did using PGP and the VNode pseudo-device.
You can do it too, coz you probably don't know better either... ;-P

# (First make sure you have pseudo-device vn configured in yer kernel)
# Create a Empty 1MB (or whudeva size) file
dd if=/dev/zero of=whatever bs=1k count=1k
# Configure the VNode pseudo-device
vnconfig -s labels -c vn0
# Give it a label
disklabel -r -w vn0 auto
# Make a filesysten
newfs vn0c
# Unconfigure the device (the script will do it next time)
vnconfig -u
# Encrypt the file
pgp -c whatever -o whatever

Now adapt the two shell scripts below to have the right paths and
filenames n stuff and get going... (/usr/overdrive is the mount point,
/usr/.od.crypt is the encrypted fs and /usr/.od.nocrypt is what it is when
it's mounted. I figure it doesn't matter that the filesystem is
unencrypted when open coz only the owner (root) can read it anyway and
it's securely wiped afterwards.)

#cmount.sh
#!/usr/local/bin/bash
pgp -d /usr/.od.crypt -o /usr/.od.nocrypt
rm -f /usr/.od.crypt
vnconfig -s labels -c vn0 /usr/.od.nocrypt
mount /dev/vn0c /usr/overdrive
#eof

#cumount.sh
#!/usr/local/bin/bash
umount /usr/overdrive
vnconfig -u vn0
pgp -c /usr/.od.nocrypt -o /usr/.od.crypt
pgp -w /usr/.od.nocrypt
#eof

I change filenames coz PGP prompts to ask if it should overwrite otherwise,
which is annoying, and for some reason if I echo'd "y" and |'d it thru it
didn't listen. This is far from the ideal or most sophisticated
cryptographic fs solution, but it's probably the one that took the shortest
amount of time to implement, and thats a hack in its own right. ;)

PS. Sorry guys, woulda used GPG, but I don't have it on this box. But if you
    have half a brain you should be able to port this in under 30 seconds 
    and if you have more than half a brain you'll realise this is stupid and
    you don't want to do it, so I don't care. :)

This is a bug which Vortexia pointed out to me recently, and told me not
to release because it's like, his sekrut leet0 hax0r triq or summing.
However, since I remembered Gevil showing me this same trick back in 1998,
and since intellectual property is a lie (esp. with something like this),
I'm publishing it anyway. My apologies Vorty. Alo Gevil! Erm. *Ahem*

There are two unmarked buttons on the Nedassist terminal - obviously these
have to do something. Tap the middle of the screen twice, then the left
unmarked button, then the right unmarked button. You should be thrown into
a menu that looks like this...

() Card Encoding
() Print Journal
() Save Journal to Disk

The card encoding option is particularly interesting, and I've seen a *lot*
of *very* non-standard behaviour from these terminals in the few years
they've been out so I'm sure you freaks can find something fun to do. Just
don't be an idiot, okay?

The Motorola T2288's phonebook has a "Prevent Access" feature which, given
the security code, will prevent viewing or modifying the phonebook, reporting
"No Names Stored" and "Unavailable" respectively, until you turn the
feature off.

If you don't have the security code, but you have the PIN2 code, you can
get this exact same behaviour by setting up a fixed dialling entry to a
number between 1-10. The phonebook magically disappears, and then
reappears when you turn fixed dialling off.

By the end of 2001 the South African banks, under the governments suggestion,
will no longer accept cash cheques. The reasons given for this new system is
that not only is the payer at risk from fraudulent cheques and the theft of a
cash cheque is untraceable, but also the payee will carry large amounts of
money on them, which is not a very good idea if you live in South Africa.

The solution, all salaries and other money being paid out will now only be in
cash or non-transferable cheques. The fore yet again presents the problem of
carrying large amounts of money around, an average sized company of 500 people
(say like one of the many mines dotted around South Africa) getting paid R3500
(about $450 US, the minimum wage in South Africa) will have to have
approximately R1,750,000 ($ 218,750 US) a month, this times the amount of
companies in South Africa is quite substantial.

The alternative, non-transferable cheques, means that you need a bank account.
Now perhaps a few of you are wondering what my point is, I mean, don't we all
have bank accounts? Fact is, less than a third of South Africa's population
have bank accounts, for a person working in a rural area a bank account is
unthinkable.

Also consider that every transaction through a bank account is taxed thrice,
Deposit Tax, Interest Tax and Withdrawal Tax. Another factor to take into
account is Privacy, the big P word that many people tend to ignore, in every
decent country, and that includes South Africa - believe it or not - gives
citizens the basic right to privacy. Not many people pay attention to this
right, as they feel that either there is nothing they as an individual can do
as everything we do or say is monitored anyway or that if they have nothing
to hide why should they care. If you feel either of these 2 ways about
privacy, please stop reading this article for now and do homework assignment
one found at the bottom of this article.

For those of you who advocate privacy and respect and protect your right to
it, you may continue reading for now, there is no need to punish yourself :P

Consider now, that if you have a bank account your entire transaction history
will have been recorded, giving the government the tool to monitor all
citizens of the country, and infringing our right to privacy. For an example
of the power that banks control, try buying anything on long term whilst in
debt to a single bank, all the banks are connected, ie. centralised account
information pooling. Your entire life is documented in some basement facility,
every item of clothing you pay for by card, how much cash you spend a month,
where you eat out. Consider that insurance and medical aid companies are also
bank controlled, this means that every illness you have had is in the same
records, every burglary, every accident. The trail of paper you leave behind
while you live your life is all being nicely documented by some government
clerks who spread your gynaecologists history around that basement for
anecdotes, who delve in your personal life like some rat sniffing out food in
a trash can. One thing is for certain, you are no longer a Private Person, you
are now a state controlled entity.

This entire article would be wasted if I did not offer a solution, no mater
how flawed my advice may be, I will bestow it upon you anyway, for the Privacy
conscious, the fighters of freedom and the people who don't want others to
know how many donuts they consume, homework assignment 2 is for you.

Homework Assignment One:

Firstly go to your system admin at your work place and ask if he/she reads
your personal e-mail. Either way your admin answers, the answer is really yes,
[Wizdumb: Uuummmm. ] now consider that this person is reading your e-mail and
ask if you are comfortable with this. Now send an e-mail to your own address
from your work, describing your sex life in sordid detail, your every fear and
thought that you feel about your sex life, and your entire sexual past. Now
print out the e-mail, take it to the photostat machine, make a few hundred
copies and hand it out to all your colleagues and associates, your parents and
siblings, your extended family and your significant other. Next install a
glass bathroom facing your street and only use that. Photostat your bank
records every month and hand them out to the above people, include how much
debt you are in, how much money you spend on drugs, alcohol, pleasure, sweets
and every other habit you may have. Get a copy of your medical history,
including psychological, and staple these photostats to the others whilst
handing them out. Next record every telephone conversation you have and send
copies of these tapes to everyone who also got the Photostat from above.
Finally I want you to set up webcams in every part of your house and stream
them over the internet. Send me copies of all these things as well as the
internet address where I can view your everyday pitiful existence. Now claim
that privacy isn't an issue, if you get through this assignment and still
think you have nothing to hide than you are a sorry excuse for a human being
and scum exhibitionist. [Wizdumb: ;p ]

Homework Assignment Two:

Open up an offshore bank account, I suggest Swiss or another neutral country,
it is fairly simple to do these days what with the internet and all, and not
that expensive for privacy. Next transfer all your current money to this bank
account and close the local bank accounts with a letter explaining that you
are doing this as banks don't ensure privacy. Next speak to your employer
about making direct account transfers online or telephonically into your
offshore account. Please also try find the time to right to the constitutional
court detailing your disagreement with the infringement of our basic human
rights. Lastly, congratulate yourself for advocating your rights.
