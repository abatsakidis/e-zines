Ammendment to FK8 by Wyzewun - Released 27th December, 1999

Every single file available on buffer overflow mentions that strcpy(),
strcat(), sprintf(), vsprintf(), gets() and loops using getc(), fgetc() and
getchar() are problematic but for some reason no-one has noticed that 'cin >>'
is also a problem. So yeh, the demonstration overflow code we featured in FK8
has *two* vulnerabilities, and we were exploiting the one we didn't know 
existed: It just happened to still work because of the padding, heh. ;-P 
Anyway, cin is an *extremely* commonly used function in C++ code, and it ought
to be more widely known that the favoured use of it is insecure. Ditto for
improper use of an ifstream. If you insist on using iostream.h (cin and
ifstream) then use get() and getline() instead of the '>>' system.

Also, some newbies may have been confused by my comment about the buffer2
array which makes no sense. What I *meant* to say (but which got lost due to
general braindeadness at the time of writing) is that buffer2 needn't be so
much smaller than buffer1: even a single byte is enough.

Oh, and as a final correction - Pneuma's addy is satur9@punkass.com and not
the one specified in the zine. :) Right, just a small update, but a necessary
one. And watch out for FK9, coming your way in February or March 2000!

Cheers,
