:: The Operating System maintains a table of segment names and their true   ::
:: addresses in memory. A Program that is trying to access a piece of its   ::
:: data, a code segment, or whatever it's accessing, will look it up not    ::
:: as a real memory address, but as a <Name, Offset> pair. Name, of course, ::
:: being the name of the segment, and Offset being how many bytes whatever  ::
:: we want is from the beginning of the segment. (Eg. SUB_ROUTN_A, 150).    ::
:: For efficiency sake, there is often one address table for each user      ::
:: process in execution.                                                    ::

:: And so, a users program does not know where it *really* is in memory.    ::
:: It is impossible for it to change a <Name, Offset> pair into a real      ::
:: memory address. There are three advantages of this for the OS...         ::
::                                                                          ::
:: 1. A Segment can be removed from main memory and stored somewhere else   ::
::    if it is not currently in use.                                        ::
::                                                                          ::
:: 2. The OS can place any segment in any location, and can move it around  ::
::    as it pleases, even after execution, because all it needs to do is    ::
::    modify the address table after it has moved the memory.               ::
::                                                                          ::
:: 3. Every address reference passes through the Operating System, so we    ::
::    can check for protection. (Eg. Read Only Segment etc)                 ::
::                                                                          ::
:: Let's look a bit at this last point. Because everything goes through the ::
:: OS, it is easy for us to store values of what users may or may not do to ::
:: specific pieces of memory. One user could be able to access a certain    ::
:: segment of another user's memory if deemed necessary, but still not be   ::
:: able to touch anything else of theirs. There is a much greater potential ::
:: for versatile protection using this method than any we have looked at    ::
:: in Part One.                                                             ::
::                                                                          ::
:: BUT... This system has a gaping security flaw (which can be fixed with   ::
:: a bit of extra work) which you may have seen by now. What happens if our ::
:: segment is 200 bytes long and we give a 400 byte offset? Oops. Quick and ::
:: easy access to other people's memory - Not good.                         ::
::                                                                          ::
:: This system also causes memory fragmentation, because segments are of    ::
:: varying sizes and after awhile, unused fragments of space can lead to    ::
:: really shit memory utilization. Ugh. That just about kills it for me,    ::
:: lets move on to Paging.                                                  ::

:: Paging is fairly similar to Segmentation, in that each address is still  ::
:: a two part object, this time consisting of <Page, Offset>. Programs are  ::
:: divided into EQUAL-sized pieces called Pages and memory is divided into  ::
:: units of the same size, called Page Frames. So our program, once divided ::

:: Moving to the the next location after <x, 1023> causes a carry into the  ::

:: BUT... because there is no unity to the items on a page, there is no way ::

:: hope of getting these people to start using *BSD or Solaris, I have      ::
:: designed a guide to securing Red Hat Linux 6.0 which covers all known    ::

:: kernel supplied by RedHat for RH6 systems (2.2.5-22). Then, go and       ::
:: download the information on the Linux 2.2.x ICMP DoS that causes Kernel  ::
:: Panic - search Geek-Girl's BugTraq archive for it. <http://geek-girl.com>::
:: Apply the patch to fix this vulnerability. Now, recompile the Kernel,    ::
:: look in /usr/doc/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO if you don't know how.               ::
::                                                                          ::
:: Now there haven't been any SUID vulnerabilities discovered in RH6 yet,   ::
:: but you probably don't want any just in case. You can nuke the lot of    ::

:: to re-SUID, like mount, but you probably won't need that many.           ::

:: Now, lets play with the Alt+SysRq Kernel hack, one of the nicest things  ::
:: about the new 2.2.x Kernel series. This hack allows you to press Alt,    ::
:: SysRq (Print Screen) and a Hotkey to perform various different tasks     ::
:: even when the system is not responding. You can press Alt+SysRq+K to     ::
:: kill all processes on the vterm you are using, or Alt+SysRq+M to dump    ::
:: memory information onto the screen and a whole bunch of other really     ::
:: neat things - none of which we are looking at in detail now, except for  ::
:: the one that makes the difference for security - Alt+SysRq+1-9. This     ::
:: hack determines how much of the kernel mumblings are logged. Having a    ::
:: lot of mumblings logged is generally quite nice, or, you can keep it at  ::
:: 1 or something and just jack it up when you need to. ;)                  ::

:: Ugh. RedHat 6.0 has a stupid PAM'erized su. If you give the correct      ::
:: password to it, you become superuser immediately, and if you give the    ::
:: wrong password, there is a full one second delay before it tells you the ::
:: attempt failed and logs the attempt. During this period, you can press   ::
:: Ctrl+Break to stop su and nothing will be logged, making it easy for     ::
:: some-one to brute-force the root password. Nuke su. It's a dumb program  ::

:: I hope you're not running X-Windows, but if you are, be sure to fix a    ::
:: few critical permissions in the UNIX 98 PTYs which could give you        ::

:: You gotta know their IP <Phew. I dont gn0 if I iz leet enuf> (easy enuf, ::

:: WHAT THE TROJAN DOES: Helps you get the agent to their computa, while    ::
:: lookin real innocent. <Really?!!#@#@ I Phj34r!@@#@>                      ::
::                                                                          ::
:: WHAT THEY SEE: You just send them the icqcrk.zip (the trojan) file,      ::
:: saying its a cool ICQ utility. They run it - but it just comes up with a ::
:: heap of errors and drops out. Dang! Isn't it always the way with good    ::
:: games.                                                                   ::

:: WHAT REALLY HAPPENZ: Unknowingly to them, there were no real error - just::
:: looked like that. The trojan has copied the agent over to their          ::
:: /windows/system directory. Executed itself, so it is running. Set its    ::
:: attributes so it can't be found. Set up stealth protections so it can't  ::
:: be deleted. <Woah! Stop right there! I think I saw that "Stealth" when I ::
:: was looking through the strings in the program. I do believe that it was ::
:: something like "attrib +h c:\windows\system\explorer.exe" - Sheesh. Dat  ::
:: iz pretty damn stealthy. I wish I had skillz like that> And last and     ::
:: most importantly, modified win.ini so that it loads whenever they turn   ::
:: on their computa any time in the future. Now, whenever they are on the   ::

:: STEALTHINESS: The trojan will not show up anywhere as loading, not in the::
:: in box, not the startup menu, not anywhere! The only way you can see if  ::
:: it is running is if you go CNTRL-ALT-DEL, you will see two copies of     ::
:: 'Explorer' running. One of these is the backdoor to their computer. The  ::
:: only other way they could find it is by checking through their win.ini   ::
:: file, and seeing 'explorer' getting auto loaded. But that looks innocent ::

:: completely work around not only Identicall, but all conventional tracing ::
:: methods implemented by Telkom. Oh, and get this, it's for FREE! And to   ::
:: our friends at Telkom and the SAPS CCU - Get a life! We are just writing ::

:: Telecommunications Giant, I'm not sure exactly which one, perhaps a few  ::
:: of our German readers will be able to find out, but never-the-less, this ::
:: system had only been tested out on the newer exchanges supplied by this  ::

:: As a result, unknown to Telkom, (Relatively speaking of course, if you   ::
:: are reading this anything after 3 days after it's release, they will be  ::

:: function properly. It works to an extent, in that if your number is      ::
:: +27116848012 it will show as +2711684 - but that is it. Furthermore,     ::
:: dialing 101999 on these telephones will not produce any results, proving ::
:: that ALL conventional tracing methods are shot to hell. For Telskum to   ::
:: trace you, some-one physically has to go through pages and pages of      ::
:: information trying to manually find you, and this method is both too     ::
:: expensive and tiresome for Telkom to actually pursue it lest they have   ::
