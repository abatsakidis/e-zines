:: 3) Phone up Vodacom and ask them to reset that VMB because you forgot    ::
::    your password. Then get in, and make everything back to normal before ::

:: I'll type in "+27114351740" - And there you are - The network accepts it ::

:: Unfortunately, it won't let you foward *all* your calls. If you want     ::
