Okay! Okay. I'm a lazy fucking shmoe. But I haven't had a computer of my
own for the last 8 months (I'm not a rich kiddie like yall, I fish my
hardware out of office trash cans mostly), so it's been difficult. Pneuma
was kind enough to lend me his BSD boxlet, and I had a few days free, so I
made this issue of FK from scratch.

There have been many FK drafts which were never released between this one
and the last, because of my lack of hardware and time. I slapped this
issue together in 4 days, just to have something to release to tell y'all
that we're around n stuff, heh. Yeah, I know FK was s'posed to be dead,
but Kokey is a lazy shmoe, so EMI didn't happen.

I have, however, had a lot of time to think away from my computer, and I
now believe I have the strategy which will grant me complete world domination.

EMI will be playing with some different media, and FK will continue as
before regularly (and maybe even with an article or two from Kokey if he
stops being a lazy bastich :-P). I'll spend some time on this upcoming
issue of FK, and release an issue that hopefully doesn't suck too badly
this Good Friday the 13th.

Many other exciting projects that may, but probably won't, interest you
are on their way. :-)

Peace,
Wizdumb <wizdumb@leet.org>

I was quite excited to see a CyberXpress Internet Kiosk nearby my house,
this being the first "internet booth" I had seen deployed in SA (The Post
Office's PIT (Public Information Terminal) thingymabobbies are on their
way but aren't really around yet I think).

The machine runs Windows NT, and has this goofy web-browser written by
CyberXpress - or so at least, they claimed on their website. Truth be
told, they wrote a GUI, and imbedded Internet Explorer 5 into their
application el-elito VB k0der style.

And although they don't allow URL's with things like "file://", they do
seem to allow URL's with just "//".

Oh dear. I'd best shut my mouth now before it all just gets too easy.

Introduction.
Switched Environments: Definition and Examples.
Common sense.

-[This article serves to explain the problems switched environments can
pose to common techniques employed on networks.]

-[Introduction:]

Today LAN environments are evolving to support their increased load, and
need for security. The easiest way to achieve both is to move to a
switched network; herein conversations become private and load on each
node's NIC is reduced. Essentially each node is only aware of
conversations it's implicitly involved in. The complexity of the switched
network depends on what solution the LAN needs. Different Layered switches
are used here.

-[Switched Environments:]

Switches route (yes, yes wrong word) packets based on various levels of
information. Each level consists of a unique set (to those levels below
it) and each level above it has a unique set:

	Layer 1:        This is the underlying network medium [Ed: Physical 
			Layer] usually Ethernet, but can be Token-Ring etc.
	Layer 2:        This is the Data-link layer.  This is the level
			that devices using the Layer 1 medium use to
			communicate.  Datagrams here have a unique physical
			address that they use it identify themselves.
			Each datagram transmitted from a node has both the
			source and destination address (MAC address)
			present.
	Layer 3:        This is the Network layer.  Essentially the
			protocol used to communicate on top of Layer 2
			datagrams.  For instance packets have unique 
			IP addresses and TOS fields (IPX and IP).
	Layer 4:        This is the Transport layer.  Sockets and Layer 3
			packet contents are unique to this layer.

[Ed: For the sake of making things a bit clearer, these are the three OSI
     layers that don't apply to switching...

     Layer 5: The Session Layer. This layer manages communication sessions -
	      service requests and responses and all that junk.
     Layer 6: The Presentation Layer - coding and conversion functions for the
	      application layer - like ASCII or MPEG or whatever.
     Layer 7: The Application Layer - Provides services directly to
	      applications.

     Okay. Now I've confused you even more than Olmec has. That wasn't my
     intention. I just wanted to get the full picture intact for yall so I can 
     show you how it fits together, so Olmec's terminology makes a bit more
     sense to yall dumbasses :) Aight...

     User information from the Application layer is converted to data
     That data is then converted into segments
     Segments are converted to packets or datagrams
     Those are converted to frames
     And frames are converted to bits

  You dig? Hokay, back to Olmec... ]

For example a Layer 2 switch can switch packets based on source and
destination physical address. Layer 3 switches can switch on protocol
information, protocol type and socket addresses. Layer 4 switches can
switch based on connections i.e. complete sockets, as well as switch side
ports, rules can also be applied on top of this further limiting
conversations.

There are essentially two types of conversations, direct and broadcast.  
Direct conversations are those that sender knows the exact address of the
receiver and needs only to communicate with it.  Broadcast conversations
are those that hosts, either lacking higher level config (IP address
assigned over DHCP for example). The use of various switches depends on
the need of the network.  For instance, refer to [Figure 1] here direct
conversations between PC 1 and PC 2 are private from both the Layer 4
switch and any other network device, except the Layer 2 switch they both
are connected to.

		-[Figure 1]

A layer four switch has the ability to route packets based on physical
addresses, IP addresses and ports. This allows rule-sets to be established
in order to further increase network security (i.e. sales cant get to
accounts etc). The problem is that each of these implementations has several 
drawbacks these will be discussed later.

-[Network Enumeration in switched environments:]

Note: please refer to the LAN detailed in Figure One

Ok, so you have plugged into the LAN (into the layer 2 switch) and you
need to know what's what and where. Here are your detailed options:

1.      You can send out an IP packet that is corrupt, in the sense that the
	IP address is (255.255.255.255) or send to a lower level physical
	address (FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF).  One of two things is going to happen:

1.1     The Layer 2 switch is going to drop the packet (this is bad) and/or
	kill the port for a period. However, the MAC (FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF) is a
	broadcast address, so it will most probably be sent to all active
	ports on the switch (see below). The Layer 2 switch is going to
	broadcast that packet to all PCs on the LAN (this is better).
	Information regarding PCs on the LAN can be determined from the
	resulting packets. However due to the nature of the packet, most PCs
	are likely to drop it. The beauty of MS LANs is that they essentially
	run on several broadcast protocols, NetBEUI and their Samba.
	
2.      You can send various DHCP/BOOTP requests out, however for this to
	work, you need to know the IP of the DHCP server.  However I
	have found that MS's DHCP seems to respond (at least in part) to
	requests with invalid source and destination IPs. The response is
	sufficient to gain the DHCP servers IP.

2.1     There are several protocols that are broadcast over the LAN, (WINS
	and ARP are excellent examples). These are too complex to explain
	now but ICMP errors and ARP requests are magic.
	[Wizdumb: Connectionless protocols in WAN environments is just asking
	for it.] BOOTP is also another excellent example. BOOTP servers respond
	to some of the most mundane requests. Its broadcast, and very easy to
	gain information.

3.      One can use directional broadcast pings, this does however require
	knowledge of subnets i.e. the first 24 bits of the IP address. Thus
	all machines on that subnet will respond:

3.1     ping 192.168.1.255 
	all machines on 192.168.1.0/24 will respond.

4.      Another method, similar to that described in 3 above, developed in
	co-operation with Aragon, is a SYN-BROADCAST. Herein a TCP packet,
	with the SYN flag set is sent to a broadcast address.

4.1     The resulting responses are very interesting. 99% of the time, windows
	boxes will respond with a RST/ACK. Thus detection of M$ boxes (NT
	and 98 inc.) can be reliably done without much LAN noise being
	generated (see article on SZN with regards to logging SYN scans).

Wyzewun's Wordz of Wizdumb...

Okay. I officialy suck. I accidentaly deleted Sigma's article and I don't
really have time to get it again before release of FK. But this would be
the second article on a topic like this in FK anyway, and although it's
cool, it's not really the place for it. I'll hack up some PHP3 code to
cough up info about M-Web and SAIX dialup hostnames and put it up @
www.mdma.za.net/dialup

If any of y'all other niggaz wanna contribute info regarding the dynamically
assigned hostnames at your ISP it'd rock - send them off to wizdumb@leet.org
and I'll add them to the page.

I worked somewhere where we had Diana installed, and a PC with TelTrace,
the goofy Win16 proggy that Telkom use for monitoring and logging calls on
their PABX systems. The idea is that each employee has their own personal
three-digit phone code for gaining access to an outside line. An employee
dials 0, then their personal phone code, and then the number they want to
dial. Or, they dial 0, Press "Redial" to dial the phone code of the last
person who used the phone, and call away. Ummm. Okay. This is cool.

I don't know why more South African phreaks don't start abusing PABXs.
It's not like they log failed phone code entries or anything, and they
have them installed at all of the places that deserve to have
international phone calls billed to them.

Vodago Customer Support (082114) is now largely self-service. You phone it
up and press 1 for help /w voice mail, 2 for help /w sms, etc. etc.

Should you get hold of some-one's cellphone physically, you can reset
their VMB without any need of operator assistance by dialling 114,
pressing 1, and then 2 - to reset the VMB. Hmmm. :-/

Windoze will not allow certain characters in your NetBIOS name when setting it
through the control panel, but does allow you to use those same characters
quite happily if you just set it in the registry. I played with a few values
and got some interesting error messages...

There can be no doubt that there's some very buggy parsing being done on these
somewhere, and chances are there's something interesting to be found with
this. I only had a day to play around with this, and I don't have a computer
of my own, let alone a network of my own, so don't expect me to take this any
further, for now at least.

Windoze will happily cough up a list of characters which are not allowed -
start playing with those. And be careful of having an overly long computer
name coz VNetSup will freak out and you'll get recurring general protection
faults in Explorer.Exe when you boot up.

That's all from now. Some more interesting Win32 trix on their way from
yours truly next issue. Booyakasha.

It's 4AM. Pneuma, myself, and our pet jew, Gary, are walking back to
Pneuma's place from a party. Yeah, Yeah, I know. We're losers. But Pneuma
hasn't gotten a car yet, and Gary got his license revoked for slamming his
car into a policeman on a motorbike while stoned. And me? Well, I, uuuh, I
am, uuuuh, uhm, irrelevant to this story.

A voice coming out of the bushes at the side of the road.
"Weit! Weit foh me!"

It sounds kinda scary, but high-pitched enough for it to be a 5 year old
girl or summing, so we stop. And then from god-knows-where, this, like,
30-something year old black chick waddles out holding a quart of castle
lager in one hand.

And she waddles all the way up to us.
And she stops.

And we look at her.
And she looks at us.

.

We start walking again.

And she's walking with us, and we're starting to get just a little
worried, and I'm about to open my mouth to say something when she whines

"Help me!"
In the same super-scary high pitched voice as before.

So we stop.
And turn to her.

"What?"

"Weit! Weit foh me!"

We start walking again.

Pneuma & Gary are starting to walk at a brisker pace.
"Uuuuuh, I'm gonna catch up with my friends now"
"No! No! No!"
"Uuuh, yes yes yes."
"NO! NO! NO!"

And then we had to outrun the hideous drunken blob-woman, which basically
required us to walk at a quasi-brisk pace, while she wobbled along
unbelievably slowly behind us. But she didn't fucking *stop* waddling
after us until she lost sight of us completely.

We never saw her again and for that we are immensely thankful.

Those particular parties always tend to get kinda strange though. Next one
I go to, some guy crawls across to where I'm sitting from the other side
of the chillroom and starts feeling my beanbag. Slowly, he raises his eyes
to meet mine, which are watching him in horror, looks at me and murmors:

"... Where do you plug it in?"

"... What, the beanbag?"

And he nods.

I'm speechless, and he's on god-knows-how-much-of-what, so he's just
staring at me. But fortunately enough, he resolved his (rather odd) little
dilemna for himself:

"... We need the extension cord."

And he crawls across to the other chillroom looking for it.

I never saw him again personally, but a friend of mine says he saw him in
the other chill room humping a beanbag against the wall and screaming

"I'm plugging it in!!! I'm plugging it in!!!"

Sometimes I think I'm crazy. But it's usually not long before I realise
that the rest of the world is even worse. Thought I'd better include these
experiences in this issue so y'all stay aware that I could be
much, much worse. :-P

Hi, my name is Riaan van der linde

[ Hi, my name is Andrew Lewis ]

I want to know something please.

[ Pneuma has a genital wart. He showed me.
  Or did you mean you want to know something else? ]

I saw in issue 9 of FK that you (or someone) described how a credit card works
I want to buy myself a notebook with a credit card number.

[ I would also quite like to buy myself a notebook with a credit card
  number. I hear the banks give you those. Maybe you should try them. ]

Could you please tell me if it will work if i create my own number and name.
And what the chances are in being cought.

[ Oh god. ]

Thanx in advance

cc number that works

[ Oh my god, I ignored him and he still tried to do it. The bit I can't
  figure out is why just because he's proved he's a *complete* caveman, I
  should give him illegaly acquired credit card numbers. ]

although i have 24 numbers and all the programs say they work the websites
don't accept them.

[ Life just isn't fair. ]

Please help me in this concern.

Hiya,
Your password cracker is really impressive, do you know how you recover
which groups/users a database was last opened with?
Say for example if a database was opened and then saved by an exclusive user
so that no-one else could open the database, how would you recover which
user had locked the database?
Any help greatly appreciated,
Julian Castle

  databases that I'm some kinda expert. Fuq, I don't care - Access is the

  But thanks for not being a retard. It makes me really happy when I get

  when non-retards that I know of and admire e-mail me, but that's only
  happened once. :( *Sigh* Oh well. Hi rwx! :P ]

As I am a technician and not a programmer how exactly do I use this script 
to remove the password.Sorry if its a stupid question but I have a database 
that took ten years for a friend of mine to compile and if I can break the 
password on this he would be extremely appreciative, as I would if you can 
explain how to use this. Thanks in advance for any reply you send my way.

Sir,

I saw your post about cracking access 97 file password.
It is something like a java code.

[ Yes, you could say it is something like that. ]

I put it into a dot java file and try to compile it but it throw an exception.

Is there an easy way for me to crack my access file please ?

You are going to die. Fragments of you will live on in the things you left
behind and in minds of those who you touched. And then, those too will be gone.

Entropy is such a bitch.

Before civilization, the human population would be culled and kept strong
as a species just by having to survive the primitive world they lived
in. Simple natural selection  I suppose most people
would say that in an advanced civilization, natural selection should
depend on intelligence. But how can this be so when each individual is
born into a completely random socio-economical environment which is gonna
fuck all progress. If you're super-smart, and you're born in Somalia - too
fucking bad for you. If you're a complete retard and have a rich family,
or live in a country which will afford you decent educational & work
facilities, well, that's great.

Mankind cannot progress as a species fast enough to beat the rate of
entropy if the collective human resources of the planet are being wasted
at such an alarming rate. Our civilization rapidly loses resources, while
it grows bloated and stupid. The species goes nowhere, trying to get
somewhere, to somehow evolve.

The problem is that evolution worked before because only the most
efficient members of a species would survive to copy their genetic
material. This doesn't happen in modern society. Noted evolutions in man
since modern times include only dropping of redundancies like wisdom teeth
and appendixes - our species is *not* positively evolving.

Mankind is slowly dying, and nothing could be sadder than the fact that
it's still gurgling on, dying the horribly over-dramatic death of a thing 
that was never really any good anyway.

The time has come for you to realise that civilization *wants* you to
subvert it. At this stage in the game, it really is the only possible way
you could do it any good.
