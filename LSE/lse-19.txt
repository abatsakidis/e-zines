 As  of this issue,  you will  notice a significant  change in the  articles I
 write,  future articles will be more 'positive',  I won't be writing anything
 that expresses anger or hatred, I'll also be cleaning up my language, no more
 swearing, LSE will become more inspirational and positive,  I've become tired
 of reading and  writing negativity,  it's time to break away  from that hell,
 I have a choice, continue writing hateful articles and feeling like crap,  or
 try to write more hopeful,  inspiring articles, and feel better,  I choose to
 feel better.  This isn't going to change a lot of LSE, I'll still write about
 feelings like sadeness,  loneliness and  self-esteem,  I'm just not  going to
 write any more aggressive hateful articles, my articles will be more tame and
 hopefully I can write some inspiring, hopeful articles, I can TRY, don't know
 if  I'll have a lot  of success.   Anyways I'm going to  give this "positive"
 change  a chance,  if it doesn't work out well,  then I'll be returning to my
 old style,  I really hope that it works out though.  In other news, I decided
 to visited Alt.Life.Sucks & Alt.Support.Depression this weekend,  it wasn't a
 good idea,  it got me really disoriented and depressed, of course, what was I
 expecting? I don't really know if I should post this issue on Alt.Life.Sucks,
 this  issue is  probably a bit  "too happy" for all  those glum folks at ALS,
 yeah, I think I'm going to avoid ALS with this issue,  I'm going to try post-
 ing it in Alt.Zines, and see what happens, it probably won't be well received
 there, but who knows...

 Section 2: Beginning of a new School Year ³
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
 
 Another  school year has  started, the first few  couple of days  are  always
 scary,  you never know who your classmates and teachers are going to be,  you
 always pray that there will  be someone in your class  that you know from the
 previous year, so you won't be completely lost,  eventually after a few days,
 the routine sets in and you start to get used to it.   A new class also means
 that you have a chance to create a new 'image' of yourself, if you choose to.
 When I started school this year,  that feeling of dread,  which I hadn't felt
 for months, came back to haunt me, that feeling of being lost in the crowd of
 hundreds of  others students,  standing out like an old 286 in a room full of
 Pentiums.  All through out the day,  I look forward  to the end of school,  I
 occupy myself with  a good book in between classes  and time seems to pass by
 faster.  I don't know most of my classmates this year,  there are some people
 that were in my class last year,  but they're not really friends, anyways, it
 doesn't really matter, I've been getting along fine as a loner.

 The following is a list of nerd/loser/etc. movies,  I haven't watched most of
 these movies, those that I have seen,  I'll be rating them on a scale of 1 to
 3 starts,  one star means the movie wasn't that good,  two stars means it was
 ok and three stars means it's excellent.  The movies are from 1980 up.

 Section 4: Hypericum after a Week ³ 
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
 
 I've been  taking hypericum for one week now,  I've felt that my level of de-
 pression has gone down a bit,  it has had most of an impact on my sleep,  be-
 fore  I started taking hypericum,  I would always take  from 2 to 4 hours  to
 fall asleep,  I'm now about to fall  asleep in half an hour,  I can now  also
 take naps during the afternoon  and still be able to sleep well at night,  it
 does make you sleep more, yesterday (Saturday) I slept for about 12 hours, it
 enhances the experience when I'm meditating,  I'm able to be more comfortable
 around people, I also don't get that feeling of dread every morning.  Usually
 your  supposed to  give it 6 weeks  before evaluating your progress,  after a
 week,  I can tell you that it is working,  I tend to see more of the positive
 side of things then the negative, and I seem to have happier thoughts.  Other
 then the occasional drowsiness during the day, I haven't felt any other nega-
 tive side effects.

 Title: Beyond the Light
 Author: P.M.H. Atwater
 Category: Non-Fiction - Inspirational
 
 Back cover Description:
   Author  P.M.H Atwater knows what  it's like to die.   And the experience so
   changed her  life that she has devoted years  to researching the phenomenon
   of the Near-Death Experience.  From her own encounter with life-after-death
   and from interviews  with hundreds of others,  she presents this remarkable
   and reassuring vision into a world beyond the one we know.
 
 My Opinion:
   This is a great book,  I've read it 3 times,  and every time I read it,  it
   always inspires me and makes me feel better, the author, who has had 3 near
   death experiences, dedicates herself to the study of NDE (near-death exper-
   ience),  she interviews hundreds of near-death survivors,  and writes about
   some of their as well as her own  experiences into the afterlife.  The book
   is divided into three sections: Aspects of Near-Death, Aftereffects and Im-
   plications of Near-Death  and Steps Beyond.   The author offers us glimpses
   of heaven as well as hell, both good and bad experiences, she also tells us
   of the aftereffects of such an experience, how people make dramatic changes
   to their life styles, the physical and mental effects on the person, and so
   on. The author shows us results of her research and interviews with several
   of the ND survivors,  as well as the methods she uses in her research.  In-
   cluded  is a chapter that tries to  scientifically tackle the enigma of NDE
   and a chapter  offering information on where we could find more information
   on this phenomena.
 
   "Atwater is among this field's best researches.  Her book reflects her hon-
   esty and devotion to science. It provides a comprehensive overview of near-
   death research,  skillfully combining science,  religion,  metaphysics, and
   her own research, synthesizing the entire field"
                                                   -- Melvin Morse, M.D
 
   I couldn't have said it better Melvin,  the final quote of this issue comes
   from this book.

 Section 6: Coping with What I Have ³ 
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
 
 I  have come to realize that  I can never be as happy as  the normal  person,
 I'll probably  never find someone who loves me,  I probably will never  be as
 successful as others,  but in my own special way I have found some happiness,
 going outside at night,  laying down on the grass and staring at the enormous
 sky,  or going for a walk in  the dark,  the streets silent,  except for  the
 sound of crickets,  walking in the rain,  listening to a thunderstorm in  the
 comfort  of your room,  taking  2am showers with a  candle offering the  only
 source of light,  incense burning,  listening to relaxing music, watching the
 steam rise from your body,  spending time playing with my dog, reading a good
 book,  or watching a good movie,  and taking a nice relaxing nap  after a ex-
 hausting day, these are some of the things that bring me happiness.  I've de-
 cided that I'm going to live a silent,  peaceful, humble and simple life, I'm
 not going to stress myself out  to try and become the richest,  most popular,
 or smartest man,  I'll find a decent and honest job,  and just be happy  with
 the littlest things in life which we take for granted.

 Quote of the Day: "I have no fear of death, actually looking forward to going
                    home when God calls, and yearn to be able to assure others
                    of the reality of the beauty and joy of heaven, for my ex-
                    perience remains as vivid and convincing today as when it
                    happened.  I tell others simply: The best is yet to come!"
 
                                          --P.M.H. Atwater "Beyond the Light"
