                               [*] LSE NEWS [*]

  First Of All,  I'd Like To Say That You  Can Find Issues Of Low Self Esteem
On   The  Following  FTP  Site:  FTP://FTP.EText.Org/pub/Zines/LowSelfEsteem,
Thanks  To  The Operators  Of The  EText  Archives  For  Giving  This  T-File
Collection A Home.   You May Also Request  An Issue By Writing EMail To Me At
The  Following  Address:  PARKER_LEWIS@HOTMAIL.COM,  You  May  Send  Me  Mail
Concerning Comments,  Flames,  Or If You Want To Write Something For Low Self
Esteem.

  Well, it's been some four or so months since I've last written an  article,
as always things change, since the last issue I've changed, I can sense these
changed, they are spontaneous and can happen at any moment, I keep on looking
back at old issues of LSE and see  how much my writing style has changed from
the first issue, these changes are of course, brought on by what I experience
from everyday life,  be it a good experience or bad experience,  mostly in my
life it's all bad experiences  but one thing is for certain,  I always gain a
little more knowledge from these experiences.  OK, enough with my talking, in
this issue,  I'll be including  some poetry which  I've written  during those
long boring math and portuguese classes.  I don't have too much experience in
writting poetry,  this being my first crack at it,  so don't expect the poems
to be that great,  anyways,  I hope you like them,  and see you in  the  next
issue, when ever that may be (hopefully before Christmas).

                                "The Grim Reaper"
                                =================

                                  In my slumber
                                   In my sleep
                                 I hear a noise
                                 I hear it creep

                          I can tell it's coming for me
                          I can tell it'll set me free
                          The black figure is before me
                          He is the ender of my misery

                   He raises his head, and tells me it's time
                      I close my eyes, and wait for a sign
                     Blackness engulfs me and I feel at rest
                       Mr. Reaper, you're the fucken best!


                                "Morbid Silence"
                                ================

                                 I close my eyes
                               And try to be free
                             But no matter what I do
                              The noise follows me

                        These people are killing my ears
                           With their noise pollution
                                 I got so fed up
                            I had to find a solution

                              So I took out my gun
                            and shot them one by one
                            I was having so much fun
                            I didn't want to be done

                             And when I was finished
                            I looked down at the dead
                       They won't be making any more noise
                         With that bullet in their head

                          So I relax to the white sound
                             But I can't hang around
                     Soon the cops will show up on the scene
                And if I'm still here, they'll probably shoot me

                             So listen to what I say
                       Cause this will be my last sentence
                                What ever you do
                         Don't disturb my morbid silence


                                  "Dream House"
                                  =============

                                  I'm not smart
                              Because I'm a dumbass
                                  I'm not slim
                              Because I'm a fatass

                                 I'm not handson
                               Because I'm a freak
                                  I'm not cool
                               Because I'm a geek

                                  I'm not rich
                                Because I'm poor
                                   I'm not fun
                               Because I'm a bore

                                  I'm not happy
                                 Because I'm sad
                                I'm not cheerful
                                 Because I'm mad

                                 I'm not strong
                                Because I'm weak
                                 I'm not social
                              Because I never speak

                                I'm not friendly
                         Because I've lost all feelings
                                 I'm not hopeful
                    Because the world has lost it's meanings

                                 I'm not driven
                          Because I have no motivation
                                 I'm not relaxed
                           Because I get no relaxation

                                 I'm not healthy
                                Because I'm sick
                                I'm not loveable
                               Because I'm a dick

                                I'm not talented
                        Because I'm not good at anything
                                  I'm not brave
                        Because I'm scared of everything

                                    I'm tired
                                So leave me alone
                               I've stoped caring
                          Cause I'll soon be back home

                              In my dream house...
