 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

 Dear Readers,  I'm sorry for not releasing this issue earlier, I wanted it to
 be something special, the problem is,  I haven't been feeling too creative or
 motivated lately.   I hope the get  the web  page up during  these  holidays.


    Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-Ä-


 Section 2: The Past, the Present and the Future ³
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

 I start my Christmas holidays in 3 days, I'm looking forward to it but at the
 same time I'm dreading it,  I'll be home for three weeks,  home alone, no one
 around but me,  at times I do like  these  moments alone,  but eventually  it
 becomes tiresome,  I start to think a lot,  and get myself  all depressed,  I
 think about all the things I've done in the past which I regret, the things I
 should have done but didn't, I think about my current situation, and worst of
 all is when I think about the future, the later being the worst since I can't
 imagine it, I don't see myself three years from now,  the future is so scary,
 I'm scared of change, I'm scared of when I have to finally find a job, having
 to adapt to new thinks,  new people,  new situations,  I have such difficulty
 adapting to new environments and people,  I've been here in Portugal for over
 five years and I still haven't gotten used to it and I'm not very social so I
 have little friends.   My parents  are telling me that next  summer when I go
 back to Toronto for holidays I should find a job,  they say that I'm nineteen
 years old and I should have already had a job,  they go on to compare me with
 my  sister who had a job  when she was sixteen and my cousins  who have had a
 part time job some time or other in the past, for me,  the closest thing to a
 job that  I had was delivering  newspapers  when I was  ten years  old.   I'm
 scared, I don't want to work, not now, I'm not ready, I feel angry at my par-
 ents for  putting me  under such pressure,  I'm not lazy,  I'm not a slacker,
 when I feel ready to work,  I'll work, and I'll work hard,  but now isn't the
 time, I'm not ready.  My parents have also told me that if I choose to,  this
 summer  when I go to  Canada,  I can stay there,  and continue school  there,
 although at first this sounds good,  what keeps me back is this fright that I
 have for change,  staying in Canada would  mean that I'd have  to go to a new
 school,  meet new people and adapt to a new social climate,  Canadian society
 much like American society is scary,  I'd have to go to  school with all  the
 Canadian teenagers,  all those nasty  gangsters and skaters  I'd probably get
 beat down everyday, I know this sounds stupid but over here  I'm able to cope
 better  because people  are more  basic,  there's  less  discrimination  here
 because the  standards of Portuguese teenagers are lower,  there are a lot of
 teens here that even though they're  not attractive and dress badly are still
 able to be popular, I don't think such a person would have as much popularity
 in a North American school.   In Canada I'd be lost,  I'd be seen as nothing,
 I'd be the victim,  I'd be even  worst off then  I am  right now.   Maybe I'm
 wrong but based on what I've seen when I go there during the summer, and from
 what I  remember from  when I used to go  to school there,  it's  how it  is.
 Things have really  gotten worst over the years,  when I used to go to school
 there some 6 years ago,  things weren't that bad,  I visited my old neighbor-
 hood a couple of  years ago and I was  disappointed at  what I saw,  I had to
 take alternate streets because there would be large groups of loud  teenagers
 at  street corners,  they looked like  trouble and I wanted to avoid them,  I
 visited an old friend and he too had changed,  he talked like he was  a gang-
 ster,  we were good friends during school  but now I didn't know who this guy
 was,  I haven't spoken to him since then,  that was about three years ago.  I
 still think a lot about my old school, and I wish that things could return to
 the way they used to be.I remember a girl, her name was Nancy, she was really
 pretty and she liked me, at the time I didn't do anything about it, I was too
 young and didn't  know what to do,  Nancy was the only girl that ever had any
 interest in me, she would stare at me for long periods of time, I was too shy
 to  ever stare back,  and I wondered what she saw in me,  a lot of guys where
 interested  in her,  and they were  much more popular  then me,  why did  she
 choose me?  I still think about her,  I wonder if she still  thinks about me,
 nahh, probably not, that was six years ago...  It's unlikely that things will
 ever  be as good as they used to be,  the world just keeps getting worst  all
 the time,  it makes me sad,  what this  world needs is a good erasing,  erase
 what society has become and start over.   I don't think that I'll be going to
 high school in Canada,  instead I think I'll finish high school here and then
 return to Canada.  If I don't fail any more grades, I should return to Canada
 when I'm 21,  hopefully at this age I will be ready for whatever challenges I
 am faced with,  I'd be dealing with more  mature people and  I'd have less to
 worry about,  I think that when I return I might try enrolling in a technical
 school and if that doesn't work out, I think that I'd be ready to find myself
 a  job and move on with my life.   Some people aim too high,  they want to be
 doctors or lawyers or want to have some other occupation of high prestige, as
 for me,  I don't want any of that,  a simple,  honest and humble  job is what
 I'll be looking for.  But of course, no one can predict the future, who knows
 what might happen from now to then,  I might have a nervous breakdown, become
 crazy  and go around  shooting people like other  LSErs of the past,  I might
 commit suicide,  I might become a heroin or crack addict, presently I'd never
 be able to do such things but  there may be future conflicts that would over-
 power my will and lead me to do such things,  you have no control over insan-
 ity,  it just happens and  when it does,  in your eyes  everything seems  the
 same, to you, your as sane as the next guy, and the next thing you'll be won-
 dering  is why  your  in  cushioned  white  room with  a straight  jacket on.

 Section 3: Book Review ³
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

 Title: Escaping the Self
 Author: Roy F. Baumeister, Ph.D
 Category: Psychology

 Back cover Description:

 In this provocative book,  a noted social psychologist draws  upon the latest
 research  on a wide range of practices to reveal the meaning behind the needs
 to escape.  Roy F. Baumeister  shows how  powerful experiences,  ranging from
 religious ecstacy to masochism, from bulimia to suicide, can relieve the bur-
 den of maintaining a personal identity.


 My Opinion:

 This is a great book,  and I recommend it to anyone who  often feels the urge
 to escape.  The book is easy to read and understand,  the author writes about
 various methods of escape like suicide, masochism,  alcohol and drugs,  binge
 eating  and spirituality.   I agree with most  of what the author says,  this
 book  really hit close  to home for me and  was just what  I've been seeking,
 this is a book that every LSEr should check out.

                                   "Nervously"
                                  Pet Shop Boys


                          A nervous boy in several ways
                  I never knew the world could operate this way
                     I was nervous when we stopped to speak
                   And the world came crashing around my feet
                              We don't talk of love
                               We're much too shy
                      But nervously we wonder when and why
                        A nervous boy, in spite of which
                 I never thought I could tremble as much as this
                      Your flashing eyes and sudden smiles
                    Are never quite at ease, and neither am I
                     Oh, we'll talk about it all some night
                       But nervously we never get it right
                        From the start I approved of you
                   Right from the moment you turned to face me
                         A nervous boy from another town
                  With a nervous laugh and a concentrated frown
                       I spoke too fast with watchful eyes
                  Of a recent past and some nostalgic surprise
                              We don't talk of love
                               We're much too shy
                     But nervously we wonder when and smile
                          Knowing why I approved of you
                   Right from the moment you turned to face me
                                  A nervous boy
