                               [*] LSE NEWS [*]

  First Of All,  I'd Like To Say That You  Can Find Issues Of Low Self Esteem
On   The  Following  FTP  Site:  FTP://FTP.EText.Org/pub/Zines/LowSelfEsteem,
Thanks  To  The Operators  Of The  EText  Archives  For  Giving  This  T-File
Collection A Home.   You May Also Request  An Issue By Writing EMail To Me At
The  Following  Address:  PARKER_LEWIS@HOTMAIL.COM,  You  May  Send  Me  Mail
Concerning Comments,  Flames,  Or If You Want To Write Something For Low Self
Esteem.

  Sometimes I Get Carried Away, And Tend To Use Swear Words Without Even
Knowing It, If This Offends You Then, Well, Too Bad...

  This Is The Second Installment In The 'Why X Sucks' Series Of Low Self
Esteem, In This Issue I'll Be Giving My Opinion On Why The Internet Sucks, So
Let's Get To It...

WHY WORLD-WIDE-WEB SUCKS:
  The WWW May Have Alot Of Fancy Graphics And A Nice Look To It, But It's Main
Problem Is That It's Full Of JUNK!!  I Prefer To Call It World Wide Waste, It
Seems Some People Create Pages With The Stupidest Stuff I've Ever Seen, Have
You Ever Tryed Doing A 'Net Search' For Something And The Results That It
Returns Have Totally Nothing To Do With Your Search Query?  This Always
Happens To Me.  Another Reason Why I Hate WWW Is Because There Is So Much
Advertisments, This Drives Me Bonkers, It Seems That Everybody Is Trying To
Make A Buck.

WHY IRC SUCKS:
  Why Does IRC Suck?  Well I Think It Sucks Because It's Full Of Warez Puppies
And Horny Teenagers Looking For 'Cyber Sex', These Losers Are Just Plain
Pathetic, There Are Also Some Channels That You Get Kicked Out Of Just Because
Of The Name Your Using Or The Server Your Connected To.

WHY USENET SUCKS:
  I Really, I Mean REALLY Hate Cross Posters And Spammers, They Post Their
Messages On Every Newsgroup Even If It Hasn't Got Anything To Do With The
NewsGroup's Theme, They Think That Their Messages Are So Important That Every
One Should Read It.  I Hate Seeing Over 40 Posts About XXX Gif Sites And
XXX Phone Numbers On Newsgroups Like ALT.FAN.DREW-BARRYMORE And Only See About
2 Posts That Actually Talk About Drew Barrymore.  Those 'Is It OK With God'
Posts Are Also Starting To Piss Me Off, They Seem To Be In EveryNewsgroup
That I'm In, Not To Mention All The 'Kill The Niggers' And The 'Christians
Suck' Posts On Newsgroup Such As ALT.RAVE, Don't These Messages Have Their
Own Newsgroup?  Why Do They Have To Post It On Every Newsgroup?

WHY FTP SUCKS:
  It Sucks Because I Can Never Get On One, Everytime I Try To Enter An FTP It
Always Says That There Are Too Many Users Already On, It's Those Damn Leeches
That Leech Everything In Every Directory.  Another Reason Why FTP Sucks Is
Because Of The Speed, This Is Just In My Case And For All The Other Users Of
The Telepac Server, I Get A Whopping 200cps Transfer Rate With A 28800 Baud
Connection, Fast Eh?

WHY TELNET SUCKS:
  Actually Telnet Can Be Pretty Cool (If It Was Faster On Telepac
Connections), It Lets You Log In To BBS, Chat Systems And OutDials.

WHY TELEPAC SUCKS:
  Yep, Telepac Is The Most Popular Internet Provider Here In Portugal, Where
I Live It' The ONLY Internet Provider.  Telepac's Rates Are Pretty High, If
In A Month You Log On For 15 Hours You Pay $30, And Since Telepac Has The
Slowest Connections I've Ever Seen (Even Using A 28.8K Modem), The 15 Hours
Goes By Really Fast, Sometimes It Takes Over 1 Hour To Transfer A 500K File,
A Minimum Of A 14.4K Modem With Hardware Error Correction Is Required To Log
On To The Telepac Server, And With Such Requirements You'd Expect A Pretty
Fast Connection and Good Performance, But Wrong, You Get A Performance Equal
To A 2400 Modem, And Sometimes Even Slower. After You Spent More Then 15
Hours A Month, You Pay An Extra Sum For Every Minute There After, And You
Can't Forget About The Phone Bill, Even Though The Call Is Local You Still
Pay A Certain Sum Per Impulse, The Phone Bills In My House Range For $70 Up
To $500 A Month, But Then Again What Can You Expect From Those Fucken
Capitalists At The Phone Company, They Just Want Money, And They Don't Give
A Fuck About Service, The Phone Lines Are So Noisy, Alot Of Times My Modem
Hangs Up In The Middle Of A Connection Because Of The Excessive Noise Coming
From The Lines.

WHY THIS ISSUE SUCKED:
  Well This Issue Of Low Self Esteem Sucked Because I Am Just Feeling Like
Shit, And My Creative Juices Are Running Out, If You Want To Write Something
For These Text Files Then Write To PARKER_LEWIS@HOTMAIL.COM, It Can Be About
Anything, Your Opinions, Your Experiences, Whatever.

  Well See Yas For Now...
