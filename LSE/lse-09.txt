  First Of All,  I'd Like To Say That You  Can Find Issues Of Low Self Esteem

Thanks  To  The Operators  Of The  EText  Archives  For  Giving  This  T-File
Collection A Home.   You May Also Request  An Issue By Writing EMail To Me At
The  Following  Address:  PARKER_LEWIS@HOTMAIL.COM,  You  May  Send  Me  Mail
Concerning Comments,  Flames,  Or If You Want To Write Something For Low Self
Esteem.

  I Was Looking Through Old Issues Of Low Self Esteem And I Encountered Many
Errors In My Typing, Mainly Because My 'S' Key On My Keyboard Doesn't Get
Printed Sometimes, And I'll Be Re-Releasing Old Issues Which I've Corrected,
I Know That I Should Have Corrected The Errors Before Releasing The Issues
But Sue Me, I'm A Lazy Bum.

  I Haven't Written An Issue Of Low Self Esteem Lately Because Of Something
Called School.  That's What The Theme Of This Issue Is Going To Be, That
Wonderful Hell Called 'Sc-Sc-Sc-hool', The Mere Word Makes Me Stutter.  Over
Here In Portugal School Is Diferent From Most Other Countries, I'll Be
Explaining How The School System Works Here And I'll Be Giving A Little
Commentary On It.

  Let's Start At The Begining, Over Here You Enter School At Grade 1, There
Is No Junior Or Senior Kindergarden.  When You Pass The 6th Grade You Move
To A Secondary School, After Completing The 12th Grade You Can Go To Work Or
Go To University.  No Matter What Grade Your In, The Portuguese Have No
Problem In Flunking You And In Making You Repeat The Year, I Myself Had To
Repeat 2 Years, So Now That I'm Supposed To Be Completing The 12th Grade, I'm
Only Completing The 10th Grade.  In The First Day Of Entering Grade 7 Or
University At A New School There Is Always The Initiation (sp?), Although
Most Schools Elsewhere Don't Allow These Actions To Take Place, Here In
Portugal, They Just Play Blind, And Don't Do Anything About It. Some Stuff
Done To Victims On Initiation Day Include, Getting Spat On, People Throw Shit
And Piss At Them, They Get Covered With Girls Perfume, They Get All Painted,
And Other Such UnCivilized Actions, Even People In University Who Should Know
Much Better Still Participate In These Things.  Let's Move On To Something
Else.

  From The 10th To The 12th Grade, At The End Of The Year They Have Special
Exams Which Count For 30% Of The Final Grade, This Special Exam Is Called
A 'Global Exam', In This Exam, There Appears Questions From The Entire School
Year, The Reason Why I Haven't Released An Issue Of LSE In A While Is Because
I've Been Studying For These Global Exams, There Is 1 Global Exam For Every
Subject And The Exam Days Are All In The Same Week, So On Monday You Could
Have Math Then On Tuesday Physics, And So On, Giving You No Time To Study The
Hundred Or So Pages Of Every Subject Of Problems You Last Gave Some 6 Months
Ago In Which You Don't Remeber Nothing, It's Really Frustrating.

  Here In Portugal There Are No Special Schools For People You Have Trouble
Learning, So People Who Have More Dificulties Are Put In The Same Class As
BrainStiens And If They Can't Keep Up Than Too Bad.  The People Who Have
Trouble Learning, The School System Just Flunks Them And Puts Them Back The
Year, Eventually The Person Will Get So Unmotivated That They'll Quit School,
And Not Be Able To Get A Proper Education To Get A Proper Job.  In My Class
Last Year I Had A Guy That Was 21 Years Old And I Remember When I Was In
Grade 9 I Had A Guy Who Was 23 Who Eventually Dropped Out Of School To Become
A Farmer.  The School System Here Doesn't Want The People Who Have More
Dificulties To Pass, They Keep Them Back And They Keep Them Out Of A Good
Life, The School System Only Wants To Pass The Brain-E-Acks And They Want The
Portuguese Society To Be A Society Of Intelectuals.  Over The Last Few Years
I've Noticed How There Seems To Be More And More Students, There Are Alot
Entering The Year And Few Passing The Year, Because Of This The Schools Are
Becoming Over Crowded, One Day It's Going To Get Really Ugly.

  In The End Of The Twelveth Grade The Students Still Have To Take The
Global Exam And On Top Of That They Have To Take A Further Exam Which
Englobes The Entire Program Since The Seventh Grade, I'm Lucky That I Don't
Have To Worry About These Exams Yet Since I'm Still In The 10th Grade But My
Friend And Fellow Vandals Member 'MegaDevil' Has To Take These Exams This
Year, I Sure Wouldn't Want To Be In His Shoes.

  So Far I've Completed 3 Of The 4 Global Exams, The First Global Exam Was
Portuguese And That Went Shit, My Second Exam Was Fisics And That Also Went
Shit, Today I Did The Global Exam Of Filosofy, It Went Pretty Good, Next
Week I Have Math And That Will Be My Last Global Exam, After I Complete The
Math Exam, School Is Over And The Summer Holidays Begin, Yahooo....

  Well That's About It, For My Comments On The Portuguese Education System,
There Is Nothing We Can Do About It, You Either Go With The Flow Or Eat
Dust, They Have Us By The Balls And We Are Powerless To Fight Back, And
Since Most People Accept The System (Since They've Never Seen Anything Else)
And Alot Of People Fear The System, Revolution Is A Utopia.
