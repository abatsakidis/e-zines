        In This Text File I Will Be Talking About Religion, Catholic Religion
In Particular, Since I Am Not Familiar With Other Types Of Religion.
Yesterday Was Good Friday, Tomorrow Will Be Easter Sunday.  I Was Watching
News Broadcasts On TV Yesterday, And It Was Showing Various "Rituals" That
The Christians Perform, And Some Of These Rituals Really Made Me Sick.  In
Taiwan I Think It Was, There Was A Guy That Was Nailed To A Cross, The Guy
Had Nails Driven Through His Hands And Feet And He Was Screaming In Agony,
All Around Him Were People Watching The Spectacle.  In Another Chinese Place
There Were People Bashing Their Heads With Some Kind Of Object Until It
Started Gushing Blood.  In Spain Their Were People Dressed In White Gowns And
Pointy Hats That Covered Their Face (They Looked Like Klu-Klux-Klan Members),
And They Were Having Some Type Of 'Gross' Celebration.  They Also Showed
People Whipping Their Own Bare Backs With Some Type Of Whip Until Their
Backs Became All Red And Bloody.  Here In Portugal, Some People Travel A Long
Distance On Their Bare Knees, At The End Of Their Journey Their Knees Are
All Scraped And Bloody.  I Have No Repect For These People That Torture Them-
Selves Just To Prove Their Faith To God.  I Was Baptised As A Christian And
I Do Belive That There Is A God, Even Though I Think God Exists, I Don't
Belive That I'll Be Seeing God While I'm Living Or That God Will Be
Influencing Me In My Life, I Belive That Life Is Kind Of Like A Test For The
After Life, Why God Puts Us Through This Test, I Don't Know.  In Life I'll
Continue To Be A Good Person, And I'll Continue To Help The People Around Me,
But Unlike My Fellow Christions, I Will Treat My Fellow Human Beings With
Superiority To God, And I Will Never Worship God Or Cause MySelf Bodily Pain
For God.  You May Be Thinking "That Parker Lewis Guy Is Going To Go To Hell
Because He Doesn't Worship God", Well My Response To That Is That, I Don't
Belive I'll Be Going To Hell, I Do Love God, But I Love My Fellow Human Beings
Even More, And In Life, We Are More Effected By Our Fellow Human Beings Than
By God.  I Go To Church Every Sunday And I See Some People That Treat God
Better Then Other People, My Aunt Next Door Is A Good Example, She Worships
God But She Treats Her Kids Badly.  My Main Point For This Text Is, Treat
Yourself And Your Fellow Human Beings Better Or The Same Way That You Treat
God Because People Are More _REAL_ Then God, What I Mean By _More REAL_ Is
That They Are More Influential In Your Physical Life. I'm Not Saying That God
Isn't Real, I'm Just Saying That You Won't Feel His Presence In Your Physical
Life, When Eventually You Die, You Will Feel The Presence Of God.  Well Thats
All I Have To Say For Now, So Bye, And Have A Happy Easter...
