Concerning Comments,  Flames,  Or If You Want To Write Something For Low Self
Esteem.

  In The Last Issue Of LSE,  I Talked About The Portuguese  Education  System
And How It Works (Or Rather,  Doesn't Work).   I Mentioned The  Global  Exams
That We Have To Take At The End Of The Year,  Well Today I Got The Results Of
The Exams.   The Grades Are On A Scale Of 0 to 20.   In Portuguese I Got A 3,
But That Doesn't Really  Matter  Because This Year  I Was Just  Improving  My
Grade  In  Portuguese,  In  Math I Got  A 10 Which  Is Enough  To Get By,  In
Philosofy  I Got A  16 Which Was  The Highest Grade  In  The Class  (Am  I  A
Brainstien Or What),  Now Comes The Worst, In Chemistry I Got A 0, I Got This
Grade Because Of Some Comments  I Wrote On The Test  On  How Our Teacher  Had
Never  Taught Us Anything About The  Question At Hand,  And How They Do A Bad
Job  In  Teaching  And  Motivating  The  Students.   These  Comments  Weren't
Offensive  And  They Were  Written With Sarcasm  And  Not Meant To  Be  Taken
Seriously,  But They Decided To  Make A Big Conspiracy  Out Of It And So They
Gave Me A 0.   This Really Pisses Me Off  Because This Was A Really Important
Test And They  Obviously Didn't Really Mind Giving  SomeOne A 0 And  Flunking
Them Because Of Some Insignificant Sentences That I Wrote, And Since When Has
The Test Been Graded By Comment, I Thought It Was A Chemistry Test And Should
Be Graded By The Subject,  No Matter What Someone  Writes On Their Test,  The
Grades Should Come From The Answers Given By The Student And Not The Comments
The Students Write  On The Side  Which Haven't  Got Anything To Do  With  The
Subject At Hand,  The People Who Correct The Test Should Ignore Everything On
The Test Which Haven't  Got Anything To Do With The Subject,  In My Case They
Decided To Ignore My Answers To The Questions And Concentrate On My Comments.

  You May  Be Wondering,  If The Test Was So  Important Then  Why Did  Parker
Write The Comments?   Well I'll Tell You Why,  I Spent Over A Month Preparing
For This Test,  Going Over  All The Material That  Was Given Through Out  The
School  Year And  Re-Doing All  The Exercises  We Did  In  Class Until  I Got
EveryThing Right,  I Knew The Material Like The Back Of My Hand, And I Walked
In The Class Confidente And Confortable Because I Knew Everything, Well After
We Received  The Test Everything Changed,  The Majority Of The Questions That
Came On The Test We Hadn't  Even Studied In Class Or It Was Given Very Little
In Class,  And On The Test  I Stated That We Had Never  Giving This Material,
After  A While And  After Seeing  That There Was No Way I  Was Going  To Pass
The Test And Thinking About All That Time  I Wasted Studying Stuff That Never
Came Out In The Test, I Got Pissed,  I Decided To Give Them A Little Piece Of
My Mind,  I Finished Off The Test With The Following Message "By The Looks Of
This Test, It Looks As If You People Don't Want Anyone To Pass".   Well I Was
Right,  Nobody Did Pass This Test.   So Am I Sorry I Wrote  Those Comments On
The Test?  Hell No, Even If I Hadn't Written Those Comments I Would Only Have
Gotten A 3 Or a 4, So I Didn't Really Have Nothing To Lose.

  Well Thats About All I Have To Say For Now,  School Is Finally Over And Now
I Could Chill,  To Those Bitches Who Corrected My Chemistry Exam  I'd Like To
Say "FUCK YOU!!!!",  To All My Classmates I Extent  A Big Peace Out And  I'll
See Ya's Next Year.



                        Its Summa Time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                        Yahhhoooooo.....
