        Before I Start This Article, I Just Want To Say That When I'm Writing
Articles, I Like To Jump From One Subject  To The  Next Without  Warning,  My
Writing Style Is Very Screwed, I Just Try To Write Down What Ever Comes In My
Head,  And Sometimes It Just  Appears Really Bizzare  When Reading It.   Lets
Move On The The Article.

       Cool People Suck, If There's One Thing In This Whole World That I Hate
Most Is Cool People, Or Wanna-Be-Cool People, Let Us Take A Look At Both Of
These Type:

       Cool People: You Know Who They Are, They Are The Jocks, They Are The
Popular People Who Put Down Others In Order To Raise Their Status.  Whether
We Like It Or Not, Society Is Divided Into Groups, We Have The Cool People,
Who Like To Think Of Themself As The Superiors, After That Comes The
Wanna-Be-Cool People, I Must Admit That I Used To Be One Of These, But It
Just Wasn't My Style, And I Am Who I Am, Finally Comes The Losers, Dweebs,
Nerds, Rejects, Etc, Which Of Course Are The Unpopular People, The People That
Get Abused By The People With Higher Social Status.

        Indepth Analysis - Cool People:  They Think They Rule The World,
They're The Type That Are Always Harrasing The Unpopular People, They Are The
People That Smoke Dope To Look Cool, They Are You Guys Who Have A New Girl
Friend Every Week, They Are The Guys That Are Always Talking Big Like "Yeah
Man, I Ate Three Pussies Last Week", They Usually Hang Around In Big Groups,
They Use And Mistreat People In Order To Raise Their Status As Supreme Rulers
Of Society.

        Indepth Analysis - Wanna-Be-Cool People: These Are The People That
Want To Be Cool But They Aren't Able To, They Try To Imitate Cool Guys By
Doing Stuff Like Dressing Like The Cool Guys, Listening To Music That Is 'In'
And Popular, Sometimes They Try To Prove Themselves By Doing Drugs, They'll
Also Invent False Stories To Try To Impress Cool People and Try To Fit In.

        Indepth Analysis - Uncool People: They Are Shy, Have Little Friends,
They Don't Talk Much, They Don't Go Out Much, Sometimes They Have Negative
Physical Attributes Like Being Overweight, Wearing Glasses, Walking Goofy,
Having A Big Nose Or Big Ears, Etc.. Some Dress Up Really Goofy, But You Don't
Have To Dress Goofy To Be A Nerd, I Dress Pretty Cool And I'm Not Ugly, But
I'm A Nerd Because Of My Shyness.  We Aren't Very Lucky In Romance, And If We
Ever Do Find A Girl Who Loves You, We Treat Her Like A Queen And We Stay With
Them Forever.  We Are Smarter Then The Popular Guys, Since We Are Usually At
Home Studying While They Are Out At A Party Getting Drunk.  We Are Kind People
And We Can Even Be Fun If You Really Get To Know Us.

        There Are Also People That Do Not Have The Caracteristics Of A Cool
Person Or A Geek, These Are Just Normal People, Although Some Are Wanna-be's.

        That's The End Of Another Issue Of This Crappy Zine, Bye Bye...
