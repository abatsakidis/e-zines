                               [*] LSE NEWS [*]

  Well, Summer Is Finally Here, I've Been On Summer Holidays For About A Week
Now, Even Though It's Great Not Having To Go To School, It's Quite Boring, So
After  Bumming Around  The  House  Doing  Nothing,  I Decided To  Write  Some
Articles For LSE,  And Since I've  Got Plenty Of Time Now, Expect To See Many
Issues  Coming  Out In The Following Weeks,  Even Though LSE  Started Out  By
Being A Geek Newsletter,  I've Decided To Expand It, Since The Other Magazine
That  I  Wrote  For  "Forbidden  Knowledge"  Is Dead,  You'll Be Seeing  More
Articles In This T-File Collection  Which Not Only Covers  Geek Culture,  But
Also Other Aspects, Like The Underground Scene, Society, Etc..

                        [*] BEFORE GETTING STARTED [*]

  Ok,  In This Issue,  I'll  Be Helping You Get Started In  The Warez Trading
Scene, In This Issue I'll Cover Trading On BBS, Next Issue I'll Cover Getting
Warez On The Internet.  Everything That I'm Going To Write In This Article Is
From Personal Experience,  And Before You Continue  Reading This  Article,  I
Must Advise You And Make You Aware Of The Dangers  Of The Warez Scene,  Which
Can Be Addictive And Your Life May Get Ruined By It (Mine Was),  Read Issue 6
Of LSE To Read About  My Experience In The Warez Scene,  And Then Think Twice
About  Entering  This Scene.   In This  Article,  I Expect You  To Have  Some
Computer Experience And Not Be A Complete Lamer,  I'm Hoping That You Atleast
Know  How To  ZIP Programs,  Setup Transfer Protocols  And Use A Comunication
Program,  If You Don't,  Then I  Advise  You To  Get  More  Confortable  With
Computers  And Software.   Also Don't Expect  To Get Anywhere  With  A  Modem
Slower Then 14400 BPS.

                     [*] GETTING BBS NUMBERS AND NUPS [*]

  Having That Done,  Let's Start.   OK,  So You've Had  Your Modem  For Quite
Awhile And You've Been  Calling Public  Domain/Shareware BBSs  Frequently But
You've Become Bored Of  Shareware BBS And Shareware Programs And  You Want To
Enter The World Of Warez,  Well The First Thing  You'll Need Is A Number Of A
Warez BBS,  There Isn't  Anything In  The World Easier  To Get,  Even  On  PD
Boards, Numbers Of Warez BBSes Will Appear, First Of All Do A Message Scan In
All The Message  Bases For The Word 'NUP',  And Then Scan For Your Area Code,
So For  Example If You Live In Toronto,  Canada,  Do A Message  Scan For  The
Numbers 416 And 905,  Write All The Numbers You Encounter On Paper Or Capture
Them Using Your  Communication  Program Even  If They Are Of Other  Shareware
BBSes, Write Them Down.   Alot Of BBSes Also  Have A BBS List Command  In The
Main Menu,  Write Down All  The Names And Numbers That Appear On The List And
Disconnect From The BBS.   Now One By One,  Call All The BBS Numbers That You
Obtained  And  Repeat The  Previous  Process  And  Increase  Your  BBS  List.
Eventually You'll Run Into An Art Board, This Is Your Connection To The Warez
World Because The Art/ANSI Scene  Is A Sub-Culture Of The Warez Scene.   Keep
On Scanning The Message Bases And Capturing The BBS List, In A Couple Of Days
Your BBS List Will Already Be Huge  With More Than 100 Numbers  And You Sould
Have Already Obtained Some Numbers Of Warez Boards.

                         [*] LOGGING INTO THE BBS [*]

Ok, Now Heres What You Need To Know When You Log Into A Warez BBS,  Never Use
Your  Real  Name,  For An Alias Choose  A Name That Has One  Of The Following
Words In It: Dark, Evil, Shadow, Master, Chaotic, Demon, Death, Killer, Lord,
You Get The Idea,  For Your Age, Type In Anything Over 18 And Under 27, Put A
Fake  Address And A  Fake Long Distance Phone Number,  If The BBS Has A  Call
Back  Verifier,  Screw It,  Warez BBS That Have A Call-Back Verifier Are Lame
Anyways, And Sysops Tend To Be Nicer Towards Long Distance Callers.   Alot Of
Warez Boards Have A NUP (New User Password),  The NUP Should Have Appeared In
Your Message Captures,  If You Don't Have The NUP For A BBS Don't Worry, Hold
On To The Number And Maybe Someday You Might Be Able To Obtain The NUP Or You
Might Get It Off Somebody With A Trade For Other BBS Numbers And NUPs.   Some
Warez BBSes,  Instead  Of Having  A NUP They  Have  A NUV  (New User Voting),
In A NUV,  There Are A Series Of Questions To Answer,  Acronyms To  Represent
And  You'll  Have To Write  A Letter To  The  Sysop  Or To  The Voters,  Some
Questions That Might Appear Are For Example,  If Your In Any Group,  What Are
Your Latest Games And Apps,  How Many Years You've Been In The Scene,  And So
Forth.   For The Group/Affiliates  Questions Answer  By Saying That Your In A
Major  Group  Like TDT,  TDU-Jamm Or Eclipse.   There Will Probably  Be  Some
Acronyms That You Have To Give Their Meaning,  At The End  Of This File  I'll
Include  A  List Of Acronyms  And Their  Meanings To  Help You Out.   For The
Latest Games/Apps Question,  Pick Up The Latest  Issue Of A Computer  Mag And
Look Through It To Find Out The Latest Games  & Applications And Put  Them In
Your Answer.  Now, Probably The Most Important Part Is The Letter You Have To
Write To The Sysop Or The Voters.   Here Are Some Stuff You  Can Say In  Your
Letter, Tell Them That You've Been Involved In The Scene For Over 4 Years And
That  You  Used  To  Be  In Famous Groups  That Don't  Exist Anymore Like For
Example The Humble  Guys Or Fairlight.   Tell Them Your Calling Long Distance
And That You Call Out Often To Other Long Distance  BBSes To Get The Latest 0
Day Warez,  Tell Them Also  That You Trade On  IRC And Have Various 0 Day FTP
Sites, This Kind Of Shit Usually Impresses Them.

  Ok, So Now You've Gotten The BBS Number, You've Got Passed The NUP, And All
The  Questions  But  Now  Your  Faced  With A New Problem,  You Must Upload A
Certain  Quantity  Of Warez Before  You Have  Full Access On The BBS.  So The
Next Chapter Will Be About Getting Warez.


                             [*] GETTING WAREZ [*]

  Ok, Now I Ask You, What Do Warez BBSes And PD BBSes Have In Common, Answer:
ANSI PACKS,  Alot Of Warez  BBSes Also Accept ANSI  Packs As Well  As H/P/A/V
(Hacking/Phreaking/Anarchy/Virus etc)  Files And PCBoard/Renegade Utils,  But
Since  The HPAV  And BBS Files  Can Be  Quite Small  And You Need  To  Upload
Atleast 5MB Of Stuff,  Then I Recomment ANSI  Packs Because They Can Be Quite
Huge At Times, And They'll Give You More Credit.   You Can Find  Art Packs On
PD BBSes Or On Art Boards,  And It's Even Easier  If You Have Internet,  Just
Do A NetSearch For The Word ACID And Download The  Latest ACID Art  Pack From
The ACID Web Page.  Be Sure To Get Only Recent Art Packs That Are  Only A Few
Months Old,  Packs  That Are More Then  Half A Year Old Usually Get Rejected.
Ok So Suppose You Find A Recent Art Pack  On A Shareware  BBS But You Have No
Credits, Well Then Enter EDIT And Type In The Following Batch File:

@Echo Off
Break On
Echo Creating FILE_ID.DIZ File
Echo      -= Gory Doom v1.1 =->FILE_ID.DIZ
Echo     Cool New WAD For Doom II>>FILE_ID.DIZ
Echo  Complete New Graphics & Sounds>>FILE_ID.DIZ
Echo  It'll Make You Piss Your Pants>>FILE_ID.DIZ
Echo Creating Junk File, Press Control-Break After A Few Minutes...
:Loop
Echo WAD 454 võ8ÉWÞ*íä.M4-2íN8”7²A‘345345346346ÞèÖ>>GORYDOOM.WAD
Goto Loop

This Batch File Will Create Two Files, A File_id.DIZ File  And A Junk Doom II
WAD File  (PDers Love Doom WADs),  Let  This  Batch File  Run  For  About  10
Minutes,  After Hit Control-Break,  And You'll  Have  The FILE_ID.DIZ File As
Well  As A 7  MegaByte GORYDOOM.WAD File,  Move These Two  Files To Their Own
Directory And  Compress These Two Files With PKZIP With The Following Syntax:
PKZIP -e0 GORYDOOM,  The -e0 Option  Tells PKZIP Not  To Compress  The Files,
Whenever You Receive A New File Always Repack It With This Option,  This Will
Make The Archive Bigger And You'll  Get More File Points For The Upload.   Ok
Then,  After  You Download The Recent ANSI Pack,  Upload It To The Warez BBS,
Be Sure That The  Warez BBS Accepts  ANSI  Packs,  If It Doesn't  Then  Don't
Upload It  To This BBS.  Ok,  Now  Most Warez Boards  Have A  Upload:Download
Ratio,  Meaning For Example If  The Ratio Is 1:1 Then You Can Download A File
Of The Equal Size That You've Uploaded,  So If You Upload  A 1 Meg File,  You
Have  The Right To  Download A 1 Meg  File,  To Not  Have To Worry About This
Problem,  Look For A  Program Called  'Leech ZModem' And Configure It To Your
Comm  Program,  This  Program Will  Let  You Download  All  You Want  Without
Effecting Your Upload:Download Ratio,  I  Only Recommend Using  This Protocol
Late At Night When Your Sure The Sysop Is Not Around,  This Protocol Does Not
Work All The Time,  But About 50%  Of The Times  It Will Work  And You'll  Be
Rolling In Warez,  Another Protocol  I  Suggest You  Install  Is HS-Link  And
SModem,  Both These  Protocols Let  You Upload And Download At The Same Time,
Saving You Time.

                           [*] WHAT TO DOWNLOAD [*]

  When  You Finnaly  Have Enough Credits  On A BBS To Make  A Download,  Look
First  At The File Date Of The File That You Are Downloading,  Never Download
Something That Is Older Then 3 Days,  Scan The File And  Look At The Date  Of
The NFO File  Before You Download.   After You Received The File,  Call Other
Warez BBS And Upload The File That You Have Just Received,  Upload It Quickly
Before The Program/Game Becomes Old,  Most BBSes Don't  Accept Any Warez That
Are Older Then 3 Days,  So Always  Look At The Date Before You Download,  And
Always  Try To  Download  The  Latest  Warez That  Other  BBSes  Don't  Have,
Eventually  You'll  Get Enough  Credit  On The Other Warez  Board And You Can
Download Something That The Other BBS Doesn't Have, And Then Upload It To The
Other BBS,  Always  Increasing Your File Points,  Something Very Important To
Remember Is,  Always Download The Latest Warez,  Even If It's  A Program That
You'll Never Use,  Download It And Upload It To The Other Warez Boards Before
It Becomes Old,  If You See Something That  You Want But Thats A Bit Old Then
Use  Leech ZModem  (At This  Point You Should  Always Be Using Leech ZModem).
And Don't Forget,  Always Continue  Scaning The Message Boards And  BBS Lists
For Other Warez Boards.   Pretty Soon You'll Be Uploading And Downloading All
Night  And  Going To Bed At  6 In The  Morning  (Personal  Experience),  Your
HardDisk Will Eventually Get Full  From  All The Warez,  In Which Case You'll
Have To Erase Some Old Warez,  Get A Tape Backup  Unit Or Buy A New HardDisk,
In The Long Run You'll Probably  Want To Get A 28.8K Modem To  Speed Up Modem
Transfers,  You Don't Really Need A Powerful Processor, Since You'll Probably
Be Too Busy  Uploading And Downloading To Actually  Use The Program.   If You
Have Reached This Fase  Then Consider Yourself A Full  Pleaged Warez-o-Holic.
In The Next Chapter I'll Be Helping You To Kick The Warez Habit.

                        [*] KICKING THE WAREZ HABIT [*]

  At  This Point You'll  Probably Be In Too Deep,  Warez Will  Probably  Have
Become  An Addicition For You,  You Probably Don't Sleep Alot Because Your Up
All Night  Leeching And Uploading  Warez,  Your  Probably  Wearing  The  Same
Pajamas That  You've Been Wearing  Three Days In  A Row (Personal Experience,
People Started To Call Me Pajama Man),  You Haven't Seen  Sunlight In  Weeks,
Your  Ass Is Probably In Pain From Sitting So Long In Front Of Your Computer.

  Here Are Some Negative Aspects Of The Warez Scene:

  þ It's A Waste Of Time
  þ It's Stupid Because You Never Get Around To Using The Programs You
    Downloaded, Which In The Begining Was Your Objective.
  þ You Lose Friends Because Your Always Too Busy On The Computer.
  þ You Never Meet A Girl, Because There Aren't Alot Of Warez Girls.
  þ People Start To Call You A Dork Or A Kiddie Or A Warez Puppy.
  þ Your Tired And Cranky From Not Getting Enough Sleep At Night.
  þ You Stink From Not Taking A Shower In The Last 3 Days.
  þ It Distracts You From Other More Important Stuff Like School, And Thus
    Your School Grades Start To Drop.

  People Are So Addictated To The Warez Scene Because It Gives Them Some Kind
Of Sense  Of Power When They're The  First To Upload A New  Ware To A BBS And
Being Accepted In The Warez Scene,  They Try To Impress  Others In The  Warez
Scene, Except What  They Don't Know Is That Everybody  In The Warez Scene  Is
A Total Dork Who  Hides Behind Tough-Sounding  Aliases Like "Dark Killer"  or
"Evil  Menace" or  "Chaotic  Child"  And So Forth,  Anyone Who Is Really Cool
Wouldn't Be Hanging Around In  The Warez Scene,  Theres A Real Life  To Live,
And Sometime Or Other You Have  To Eventually Crawl Out From Under  The Warez
Rock And Face It, The Warez Scene  Will Have Such An Impact On You That It'll
Make You Scared Of The Real World.  Read Issue Six Of Low Self Esteem To Read
About My Personal Warez Experience,  And Think Twice Before You Get Sucked In
The Warez World,  It Really Ain't Worth It.  And If Your Still Having Trouble
Leaving The Warez Scene,  Look For A Text File Collection  Called 'Anti-Warez
Alliance', It Helped Me Out, After Reading AWA You'll Truly See How Silly And
Worthless The Warez Scene Really Is.
