        Yesterday I Had The Most Shittiest Day Of My Life.  I Went To A
Friend's House To Copy Some Games For Him, I Was Finished At About 4:00pm,
So I Went To Go Wait For The Bus.  Is Was Raining Yesterday, And I Was
Catching Quite A Bit Of Rain, Since There Was No Dry Place To Wait Under And
I Couldn't Go Back To My Friend's House Since He Left To Go Somewhere.  After
Waiting For Some 30 Minutes The Bus Still Hadn't Come, Then Suddenly I Turn
Around And I See The Bus Going Away, It Had Come From Another Direction And
There Was No Way That I Would Be Able To Catch Up To It.  After Missing The
Bus, I Had Two Choices, One Being I Can Stand There And Wait For Another Hour
For The Next Bus To Come, And The Other Was That I Could Walk To The City And
Then Catch The Bus To Go Home, One Think Was Certain, I Had To Go To The City
To Catch The Bus To Go Home, It Didn't Matter If I Walked To The City Or Took
The Bus, The Other Think That I Was Certain Was That In Any Case, If I Were To
Remain There, I Would Still Catch Rain.  So I Decided To Do A Little Jogging
To The City.  It Took Me About 45 Minutes, Always Running, To Reach The Dry
Bus Stop In The City, But On My Jog It Began To Rain Harder And Large Puddles
Started To Form On The Street, Every Time A Car Past By Me I Would Always Get
Splashed With Water, Now Getting Splashed By These Cars Wasn't Really A
Problem Since I Was Soaking Wet Already, The Problem Was That We Have A Lot Of
Cows Here, And They Shit All Over The Street, So When It Rains, It Creates
Puddles Of Water And Cow Shit, So I Got Spashed With That Alot, And It Was A
Really Terrible Experience.  I Arrived At The Bus Stop (A Small Cubicle) At
5:20, My Bus Was Supposed To Come At 5:30, So I Waited, And I Waited And I
Waited Some More And Nothing, The 5:30 Bus Never Showed Up, It Ends Up That
Because Of The Rain It Couldn't Make It, So I Stayed In That Cubicle For
Another Hour To Wait For The 6:30 Bus, But At Least I Wasn't Getting Wet.
Then There Was A Guy At The Bus Stop That Was Always Singing, My Problem
Wasn't That He Was Singing, My Problem Was That He Was Singing Terribly, I Got
A Real Headache, Finnaly After Waiting For Another Hour In My Soaking Clothes
That Bus Finnaly Showed Up.  When I Got Home I Was Totally Soaked, My Watch
Had Caught Water So It Was Screwed, My Diskettes Also Caught Some Water So
They Were Also Screwed.  And Worst Of All Is That Today When I Woke Up I Got
A Clogged Throat And A Runny Nose.

My Luck, Sheeeesh....
