        Greetings All,  My Name Is  Aphex Twin And  You Can  Say  That I'll A
Loser, Reject, Geek, Nerd, Call Me What You Like, I'm Not Proud To Be A Geek,
But I'm Also Not Ashamed, It's Who I Am, And I Don't Try To Be Something That
I'm Not.  The Reason That I Started Out This New Text Publication, Was Mainly
Out Of Boredom, But Also As A Way That I Can Express Myself, There Are
Thousands Of Zines Out There Dedicated To Stuff Like Hacking, Anarchy,
Phreaking, But Low Self Esteem Is The First 'Loser Zine' To Be Released.  In
This 'Zine' I'll Be Talking Basicly About Society From A Geek's Point Of View,
This Is Not A ELiTO, 2-KoOl Zine, It's Exactly The Opposite.
        
        I'll Now Tell You A Little About Myself, Although You'll Get A Pretty
Good Idead Of Who I Am From Reading These Files.  I'm 18 Years Old, I Was
Born In Toronto Canada But Right Now I'm Living With My Family In Portugal,
In A Small Island Called S. Miguel.  I Weigh 165lbms, I'm Not Sure How Tall
I Am, But I'm Pretty Tall, I Wear Glasses, I'm Incredibly Shy, My Hobbies Are
Computers, Watching Movies And Reading Books, I Also Like Animals Alot.  I'm
Just Your Typical Boring Guy, I Have Little Friends, The Ones I Do Have Are
Computer Friends, I Listen To Rave Music, Although I've Never Gone To A Rave
Yet, I'm Currently In Grade Ten, I'm Supposed To Be In Grade 12, But
Since My Portuguese Wasn't Very Good They But Me Back Two Years, Contrary To
Popular Belief That All Geek/Nerds Like School, Well, I'm No Einstien, But I
Manage To Pass By, I Don't Like Studying But I Do It, You'll Be Seeing Alot
More About School In Future Texts That I Write.

        Here Are Some Subjects That I'll Be Writing In Future Issues Of Low
Self Esteem:

        * The Music Scene
        * Television
        * School
        * Cool People, Jocks, etc...
        * Girls, Love, Romance, Relationships
        * Friends

        And Whatever Else Comes To My Mind That I Feel Writing About.  If You
Want To Submit Something To This Publication Or Just Send Me Hate Mail, Then
I'll Supply An Internet Address In Future Issues Of LSE, For Now, I Think
Thats All I Have To Say, So See You's Later..
