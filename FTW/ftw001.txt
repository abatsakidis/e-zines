  Maybe life isn't fair, but this is my way of getting back at it.  This
  is not a 'zine like you have seen before.  All I'm interested in doing
  is expressing the truth, and only the truth.  If you want to write
  about something that went corrupt, just attach it to email and send it
  to wiglack@vitinc.com  ....  we have no members, because we are not
  a group.  Everyone is welcomed to write, so don't hold back.

  If you can't get on the internet you can send it to me on the only three
  boards I call.  Alfheim (s: Ilsundal), The Assylum (s: Panther), and
  Seduced Reality (s: Kurdt).

      The world is full of fools... we all know that... however, only a
      wise man knows the who are the fools, and who are the wise men.

  .oO Wiglack Oo.


   Recently, there has been a lot of takeovers on #zines.  Only because fools
 have been going on other channels and attempting to take over these peoples
 channels.  Apparently there are a lot of freaks on IRC, that treat their
 channel like it is their god.  When you violate it, you violate them.
 Taking over channels is lame and immature.  There really is no point in
 typing -oooooo and every name on the channel... When ever I see the channel
 being taken over, its always because either cerkit, mercuri, or gaurdian
 were fucking with someone else.
   Now, I'm a pretty good boy on IRC.. Maybe I kick some people out when they
 ask stupid questions, or piss me off... And I have that right.  Well it ends
 up that snuffkin kicks me out because I was ctcp flooding...  I don't see how
 I could be with these stupid 4 line op commands.  So what do I do, I kick the
 bot out.  Now the bot comes back in and keeps deoppin me.  I really could
 give two shits if I'm op or not, but I dont need shit from people in the
 channel saying that I'm the reason for all these takeovers, and it was voted
 that I not be opped... well who the hell is incharge of the channel, that gets
 these privileges to vote who gets ops?   Is it the dto clan?  This is #zines.
 Not #dto.  If you guys want to bee all 13370, and act like #ansi, then hang
 out in #dto.  Dto is an extremely excelent zine.  I like it alot, but you
 have to remember that it isn't more then a grouping of poems and stories.
 Mogel does a great job with it, but thats no reason to favor him over anyone
 else. IRC is a internet resource.  Nobody owns any part of it.  People run
 scripts and bots so that conversation can be controlled, and keep out the
 trouble makers.  If you set your script, so that someone else can CTCP flood
 the channel, then it really isn't fair to the rest of the channel.  Only on a
 rare occasion is a 'zine discussed in the channel.  Most the time, its just
 a place to fuck around.  Everyone was once welcomed to #zines with open arms,
 though now things are different.  Some are favored, and others are
 descriminated against.  Nothing in life is fair, but discrediting someone
 before you know or understand them is no more then ignorance on your part.
   I've gotten a little off topic, so I'm going to make my point nice and
 blunt. I'm easy to get along with.  One thing that I hate, is favoritism.
 Favoritism is a form of prejudice, and I just can't stand for it.  I see no
 reason why one person can be treated differently then another.  If you don't like some
 one, be man enough to admit it.  Don't /msg behind people's back that you
 didn't like them.  We all know who did this (Gaurdian).  #zines once was a
 REAL cool channel.  Maybe one day it will be again, however never with all
 of this bullshit!
