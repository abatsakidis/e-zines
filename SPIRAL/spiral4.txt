INTRODUCTION
--------

  Welcome to this month's installment of Spiral Chambers Online, the E-zine
version of Spiral Chambers, a syndicated poetry column that is read by over
20,000 every month!
  This month sweeping changes are in effect at PSK Publishing, distributor of
Spiral Chambers. Ushering in the new year, we've changed our name from
Twisted Teen Publishing Co. to avoid any connection with anti-religious
sentiment and stay clear of the notion that we are predominately a publisher
of children's literature. It is not easy to instantly disassociate from a
name you've been linked to for approximately four years, so I hope you will
bare with us if the name's transition is a slow one. Some of the work we
produce might be listed by our old name, while others will reflect the new
title.
  Thanks in full to Amy Tavormina, currently a Spiral Chambers web page is
under construction. Slated for completion in March, the page will collect
past installments of S.C. and give you info on all aspects of the operation.
Once it is completed, you'll be the first to know.
  Keep the poetry coming. Here's to the start of a grand year!

The poetically inclined,
    Peter

"Fleeting Love"
--------
by Alan C. Dougall

Friendly concerning love
pleases and delights, with
responses intent on fun.

Warm affectionate love
comforts and listens, but
secretly expressed burns.

Selfish shameful love
impresses and flatters, but
considers only the moment.

Impatient passionate love
dreams and devours, yet
boiled fast cools quickly.

Shared longing love
creates and destroys with
the same words wheels turn.

Realistic practical love
challenges and defends; so
conscience deprives its end.

Final opportunistic love
seeks and sows desires, yet
knows time will steal it away.

Restrained parting love
lingers and grieves, yet
pretends life goes on.

Separated solitary love
wallows or diverts, to
feed or choke the past.

Patient considerate love
allows space and time, and
hopes pause in anguish.

Selfless undying love
surrenders and frees, and
dies to bring rebirth.

Responsible decisive love
cannot rest (forgive me)
until you are safe and found (in Him).

Deepest love (He knows)
requests (if you permit) to
hear from you and pray.

"Beauty Sleep"
--------
by Leilani Wright

I feel I ought to warn you about dreams.
They do not always mean
what you would like them to.
Take my advice;
lie on your right side,
furthest from your heart
and not on your back,
where the vitals are always too exposed.
If symbols reoccur,
like a train, gun, or snake at a station,
do not assume a sexual slant.
Roll over quietly. Stop snoring.
Do not identify with the murderer
who descends to the platform.
He is rarely you
and will only disturb the warm
body sleeping at your side.
Let the danger pass; you can always
use another form of transportation,
like your own legs
when you walk in your sleep
and wake up naked
in the neighbor's flowering plants.
This means fresh air and plenty of exercise.
And you will be fortunate
to remember so little by morning.

"Touch of Light"
--------
by Michael Morain

The whiteness of the dawn
Soft like a cloud against the dark
Moving like an ocean
Quietly, stealthily, carefully
With fingers of light caressing
Touching, holding, tasting
Tracing our outlines against the sand
Measuring our footprints
Against the shadows
Like a wind shining and sparkling
Cleansing the dust motes of our atoms
Warming us, holding us
And in a moment
Gone.

REFLECTIONS
A semi-annual lierary 'zine devoted to writers of all kinds

Here's what they're saying about it...

"A surprisingly good litzine...that's more measured and fun than edgy or
'deep.' My favorite story was Ben Ohmart's 'Put Off', a blunt, dense and
funny tale about cosmetic surgery and getting sh**faced. The narrator of Dawn
Schloesser's story 'Who Minds the Monitor?' has a great wry tone and Tiffany
Selby gives us a sexy vampiress in the Anne Rice vein."

"Did They Wonder?"
--------
by Dominick Freda

What are we here for?
The question has been asked
Endless times,
Contemplated over and over
With never an answer.
As long as I can remember,
Reaching the height where
I could see myself reflected
In a mirror,
I have stared at that antithetical being,
Asking him, "Who are you?
"Why are you here?"
He doesn't know the answer.

Religion tells us just to serve.
Politicians tell us to lead or follow.
Dichotomies ramble and force division.
Economists say we should be rational.
Societies say we should be normal.
Why?

Do we exist just to give life,
Propagate, be fruitful and multiply?
Or are we here to hate, and kill;
Give off deadly fumes so that
One day we will end our wonders,
In search of that ideal, that eternal progression?

Millions of years ago a spark
Created all life
From some thoughtless phenom,
Some unfathomable chasm,
Of nothing and everything;
The Alpha and Omega,
Nameless and unconscious.
And Pop lost his tail.
And Mom stood and walked.
And they saw that IT WAS GOOD.

But did they wonder?
Did they dream of successes?
Or fear demons in the night?
Huddle in the cold,
Loving to embrace?

Did they wonder?

Did they ever think of their
Children's tomorrow?
And could they imagine a 
Beautiful and terrible world
Of Darwinian technology,
Knowing that each step taken,
Each triumph, each fall,
Counted the dying
Of mankind?

Did they wonder?
