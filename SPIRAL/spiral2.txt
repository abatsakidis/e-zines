INTRODUCTION
--------

   Spiral Chambers, believe it or not, is produced in THREE different forms
every month. First, there's the paper version that is distributed to
small-press magazines without internet access. Sporting graphics and
stylistic fonts, layout on the paper version sets the quantity and selection
of material in each installment of Spiral Chambers. Once that's completed,
the paper version is translated into an electronic version for editors with
E-mail. Saves them typing, Twisted Teen postage and affords us a greater
range of distribution. Finally, the last incarnation of Spiral Chambers every
month is this E-zine, allowing S.C. to reach individuals who wouldn't
normally see the column in print.
   Work to create each form of this column isn't heavy, but there has been
some confusion as to which version people want. "Paper" or "electronic" seems
simple enough, but then when you further subdivide the column into "Editor
Edition" and "E-zine," things get hairy.
   With the aforementioned problem occurring regularly, it has been decided
that Spiral Chambers the E-zine will be dubbed with a slightly different
name, in the hopes of separating each version sufficiently. The other two
versions will remain under the old title, but this E-zine shall allocate
itself a special place among our line of publications. It is only right, for
this is a direct link to the reader, whereas the other two versions are
presented through other magazines only.
   What sort of name should be adopted? I'd like the name to relate with the
other versions, so the best I've concocted thus far has been "The Spiral
Cafe." If you like the name, tell me. If you don't, feel free to present a
better title. This is a contest, of sorts. If we choose your title for this
column, I'll send you a free copy of Nation magazine's anniversary issue.
Nation is the pride and joy of Twisted Teen and the anniversary issue rocks.
Inside, along with the regular twenty essays, will be two exclusive guest
essays I've somehow managed to acquire with a pair of famous authors, one of
which is internationally known and has had his work translated into over ten
different languages and been on the New York Times Bestsellers list more
times than I can count. In addition, each copy of the anniversary issue will
offer a coupon for a free LP.
   Par usual, send us all of your best poetry! Remember: 20,000 people read
Spiral Chambers each month. Wouldn't you just LOVE to have your work
included? Yes, I thought so. Don't forget to also give me the address of
anyone else you think would like a subscription to this E-zine; this is a
poetry community, not just a stuffy collection of poems from an elite
academic circle!

-Shaken but not stirred, Peter

"Dreams"
--------
by Stephanie Grusch

Autumn wind around the painted leaves
Chilled the forest heart without a rest.
Ever the pounding silence of the air
Stirred reminders of the frost in the robin's breast.

In the chill air in the forest walked
A figure almost without life or name
In endless sorrow to the silent wind
It cried in endless agony and painful shame.

And I watched from the safe window
Shut in like a dreamer-no power
No power over the dream, only a watcher
And so I stared for a silent, fearful hour.

Safe from the cold outside, doing nothing
Nothing to help the figure in its pain
Unknowing, even careless of its cries
Never wondering its business or its name.

Never questioning the sorrow in the dark cold woods
Where the autumn wind blew the painted leaves
I turned from the window and did not look back
For the dream lasts only while the dreamer believes.

"Nightmares Leave Messes"
--------
by Brandi McElhatten

Rain washes the blood
off of streets stained and sinned on
broken glass litters the ground
feet are cut and bruised

Furniture lay broken in the middle of the street
this odd sight seems out of place
the starving dog trots by burning remnants
and hungry tenements.
There is no food for him here.
It's hard to believe there ever was.
Something echoes in the air
although it is silent.

It's dead, this place.
It could be anywhere
now it's gone
a rag doll lays on the ground, its eyes closed
Nightmares leave messes.

"Tales of the Fortress Fall"
--------
by Celestial

When the battle finally turned
its tide
We were near starvation
trapped inside
*
The sun
for what seemed an eternity
was swallowed up in cloud
Blotched out by their
foreboding shroud
A darkness like despair
enveloped our land
A plague of hate
had contorted many a man
All things dead
their charred remains
Smoldering
like our endless pain
*
Who can number
those we lost?
Tell me
was it worth the cost?
Still weak and unbelieving
how can this be done?
The war is over
yet all are grieving
No one cheers that we have won
*
Too crippled to move
voices too cracked to speak
Eyes too bloodshot to see
so hungry
so weak
*
Yet still
the mighty stronghold stands
A black shadow over
forsaken lands
Unshed tears
like acid rain
Struggle to drown out
the Pain
*
To heal will take so much longer than
a year
To slay the beast who's name
is Fear
To replant the fields
that once were green
As lovely as
you've never seen
Sweet memories
kaleidoscope
In this barren world of
lost Hope
*
But lo!
Behold the looming clouds!
A ray of sun pierced through
their swarthy shrouds!
And a smile touched my dry lips
as my face was penetrated by the light
And new strength
like the warmth
flooded through me
I stood up and shouted
with all my might
"The was is over!
The battle's won!
Our enemy's defeated!
Our task is done!"
*
And I watched as our foe retreated into
the fading light
Our fortress would not fall
this night.

"ACB"
--------
by Ben Ohmart

I knew a friend of a friend who couldn't learn
and we all made fun of what he was
until we couldn't get any grades
and he got the government money for what
he couldn't do
it took a couple tries, and i made it
but i had a life eventually, and now i laugh
at myself and what a beeper is
what a nice car with carpeting is
and whatever dreams i may've had.
