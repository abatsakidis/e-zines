about idiot users
by shot gun


        okay, if you are a sysop, you all have had your share of idiot users.
you know the types:

'teach me how to hack'
'why do you keep deleting me'
'You GoT aNY WaReZ D00D?'
etc, etc.

        don't you just hate them? as my co sysop, ruiner says, it like these
jokes are doing me a favour my calling the board; it's like they think they
are the boss. before, i could tolerate those users with the locked exclamation
marked keys, but now i can't stand them and that is a reason why my users
have gone down from close to 500, to about 75. a lot eh?

        a great way you can tell if you have an idiot user on your hands, is
if they type like they were raised in the 'hood', or like a rapper <it's more
or less synonomous>. though, most sysops can tell right away if they have a 
moron on their hands, but some morons are a little harder to find out.

        the obvious clues are new user messages/applications that say things
like:

'hey, do you got warez?'
'can you teach me how to hack this?'

and other things. 

        what to do with this user? delete him right away. do not bother with
replying, it'll save more time to delete him. get a really good program to
keep them out with 'BLIST20.ZIP'. it's what i use on my board. i'll show you
the blacklist that i have collected at the end of this file. 

        some idiots are persistant, aren't they? they just keep coming back.
well, what i do <it's pretty fun> is track their phone number, go to a local
payphone and then harass them there. it's safe at least. <eg>. or get all
the friends you have in the local area against this idiot, that'll work. 
case example: Morph <ph47 w4r3z d00d wh0 1 m3t 0n 1ll3g4l 1nj3c710ns>. he has
literally disappeared from the HPAVC scene in 613, and boy am i ever glad. 
but it took a thousand or so messages to get him out. darkness, ruiner and i
had to work hard :P

        then there are the ones that are the nice morons and you don't really
want to delete them. what you do, is lower their access, slowly and steadily.
or make it so they can't post so you won't see their idiocies in public. it's
a better way, less direct, but it'll work.

        the warez morons are the funniest of all. these are the k-elite 
typers. heh, i like running into these guys. they suck up to the sysop so 
much because they think it's a warez board. i nuke these idiots right away 
too. i don't like having my user list clogged with morons. 

        the doorgame idiots. these guys do nothing but play doorgames. sure,
a person who plays doorgames, and does messages, i don't mind, but those who
just play doorgames enrage me. IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE 
BOARD DON'T BUSY THE LINE. 

        and here we go. here's my blacklist. they are all approved by me. 
those i didn't approve of, got taken off the list:

MORPH -- 'l33+' w4r3z d00d
BURVIS -- friend of the idiot above <maybe taken off the list later>
ASSINATOR -- idiot
GOMER -- moron
THE POPE -- aka gomer
PROFIT -- aka gomer
QUASIMODO -- spuz
SPUZ -- spuz
FREAK -- Big loser, tries to pose as FHG zero sometimes
GHOST -- plagerizes other peoples' material
LESTAT -- deletes users from his board for no absolute reason
MASAMI -- stupid lamer 12-year old hacker want-to-be! 
CREATURE -- ph47 w4r3z d00d
VIPER -- Asked the dumbest question (I'm new here teach how to hack)
MAMORU -- uploaded warez.
SLINKY -- fucking idiot 
ARK -- asks the stupidest, most moron questions.
DUT -- just cause.. i hate him. 
SKELETOR -- warez d00d
MANIAC -- Friends with The Pope,Profit,Freak,Gomer.Also a mo
SIMON -- He impersonates people, big fat liar 


        as you may have noticed, ruiner and i don't take much liking to warez
doods. but, it's not the 'warez' title that bugs us, it's the attitude. there
are decent guys out there like Crimson Knight <Sid Vicious, Vicious Knight>.
and that's about it. :)

        well, thanks for reading. you know where you can drop me a line. 

end file.
