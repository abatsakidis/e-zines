        many people may disagree with me, but i don't care. many people may
get very mad at me, i don't care. just as long as i get your opinion about 
this article.

        now, everyone has heard of generation x. the generation of the 
vandals, punks, etc. to me, generation x exists. for many others, it does 
too, but for some, it's just something non-existent. it may not be a true,
actual generation. it's more of a classification. 

        i'm not writing this article to bash teenagers, or young adults 
because i am one, at the tenger age of 14 <weg>. i'm here to let my opinions
out and known - the sole purpose of this zine. so please, after hearing my
opinion, let me hear yours. now, on with it.

        50 years ago, you would not see this atmosphere out there. everyone
was much simpler and seemingly happier. today, all i see is a bunch of 
wannabe 'terrorists' who just want to cause trouble. i mean, sure, this stuff
may have existed before, but not to this extent, not to the violence i see 
now. 

        it's like violence is the answer to ourt problems - if they do it to
me, i'll do it back to them. well, that's how i feel. back then, when our
parents grew up, in the suburban areas, they probably didn't see much of this.
and here i am, seeing it every fucking day. 

        the aura of hate and anger is always around me. if i'm in a crowded
area, it feels like something is going to happen, like everyone is so tense 
and are about to explode any moment. 

        of course, it is probably just peer pressure. the teens these days,
like in the past, are very easily pressured into doing things. may it be to
impress a girl, or get attention or make some friends, it happens. it happened
before, but it's worse now. 

        okay, some may argue: it was the same in the past.

        was it really? did you actually see a bunch of teens running around
smashing windows, beating the tar out of someone, burning down houses, or
even killing someone just for fun? if so, it was probably very rare, and 
wasn't for fun, but for revenge.

        we're all very used to hearing about vandalism, so when we see it in
the paper, we'll ignore it 'cause it just doesn't impact us anymore. but, 
when we hear of murder, we're still surprised, but how long will it take us
to get used to this fact that people die at the hands of others. probably in
a few years, people will be witnesses to murders, but won't care 'cause they
see it all the time. from what i notice, this may be where society is going.

        then again, i maybe so wrong. 

        the clothes, the new act, the wannabe's. i have no problem with the
clothes, and the act, but i do with the actions and the attitudes. so,
remember, i'm not talking about the clothes, et cetera, i'm talking about
actions and attitude. so if you're pissed off 'cause you think i'm 
disrespecting your clothes, you're taking this the wrong way.
