I'll warn in advance that I'm highly schitzophrenic, so anything you read in
braces ( { or } ) is still written by myself. Sort of. Visualize it as a 
voice in the back of your head when you read it.
If you find this article offensive in any way, stop reading and do NOT send
me messages about it. If you want to argue about any points in this article,
stop reading and do NOT send me messages about it. If you want to have an
open-minded discussion about any points in this article, or the whole, feel
free to send me messages about it. I can be found on boards like Helter
Skelter, Home by the Sea, ... bah, just about any anime/hpavc board. And of
course, my own board, Ground Zero. (Not releasing the number here... ask me
on abovementioned boards if you want it) Anyway, on with the article. Finally.

   Wicca is an ancient pagan religion which covered most of europe before
christianity ever existed. It is the worship of nature, the earth, and life
in general. Wicca is an individual's religion, and is extremely flexible.
There are dieties for each aspect and element of life and the earth. Wether
or not a wiccan worships these dieties or even believes in them is up to the
wiccan. There are no churches to trudge to, and no one to ask money of you.
Wiccans worship how they choose, give to what charities they choose, if any.
This freedom of choice is fundamental, as wiccans believe that we live a
cycle. Each lifetime is a learning experience in which we must make our own
choices and learn from what happens to us as a result. The cycle is ongoing
and continues until we have achieved perfect knowledge. This takes 
incalculable amounts of time as one cycles to learn as every creature that
walks, flies, cralws, slithers, or swims on the earth. Maybe even those of
other planets for all I know. Once again, just how one believes how this 
cycle works is for the wiccan to choose. The information of the cycles typed
above are for a general guideline only.
   Just for those who don't know any better because of their ignorance,
wicca is the religion in which Witchcraft is performed. It is NOT satanic
(once again for those ignorant). Satan is a christian figure, and doesn't
exist at all in the wiccan religion. Satan is, in fact a charicature of a
goat-legged wiccan god. Created by the early church to further the defacing
of the wiccan religion to gain followers and destroy wicca. {don't forget 
the witch burnings} Ah yes. And they burned followers of wicca at the stake,
(as well as many others who didn't even follow wicca) because of the 
church's greed and it's followers' superstitious fear. I may appear paranoid
or brainwashed, but I researched the facts. The early church had wiccans
burned at the stake because they refused to convert and give the church their
land and money. The church made wiccans out to be evil, twisted throwers of
curses and hexes, sacrificers of children, and worhsippers of satan.
{idiots, morons, sheep...} <cough> ... Another fact is that the bible was
translated during this time of witch-burnings, and so most likely contains
a few "bendings of the truth", names of groups to be hated exchanged for
those in opposition to the church at the time, maybe even a few completely
false inserted passages. {he/we hate the christian religion, as you can
see... Research, open ears, and an open mind turned up gruesome facts and
atrocities the average christian doesn't know, and the more-informed 
christian would rather not let get out} ... What he/I/we said. :>
   All wiccans have a rede, a saying from which a code of conduct can be
built by each wiccan for themselves. A motto, if you will:

"An it harm none, do as you will."

   Some wiccans keep a Book of Shadows, in which they keep information, rules
to live by, sayings, maybe even spells (laugh if you feel like it)
{jynxes, curses...} <smirk>... The first entry is almost always the rede.
I have yet to find a true wiccan who doesn't use this rede.
So, the curse stuff most people have been told is completely false. To put it
in words most people will understand, it's essentially a sin to curse someone
unless it obviously needs to be done, and the wiccan truly believes that it
needs to be done. At times, whole groups of wiccans must agree before it is
attempted. So, if you get cursed by a wiccan or a group of wiccans, you
REALLY deserved it. May whatever god(s) someone cursed believes in have mercy
on them, for MANY curses are designed to make the victim's life a living
hell. {nah... if the bastard deserved it, let 'im rot} ehh... Oh, and all
this cursing, blessing, spinning of spells, etc... is called magick. The 'K'
is to distinguish it from common stage magic, and illusions.
   Magick is based on the belief that there is energy all around and within
us. Constantly generated by living things, radiating out. {one mention of 
"The Force", and I come for you in your sleep} Yes, it sounds something like
the force... Maybe the makers of those movies studied wiccan belief when they
came up with it, or maybe it was pure coincidence. In any case, it isn't the
same thing. This radiating energy is what gives people their "Aura". The 
energy surrounding every living thing before it gets farther away from it's
source and diffuses into it's surroundings. Curses, blessings, and other 
types of spells and rituals are forms of magick based on the belief that this 
energy can be used to manipulate intangible things like luck. I could get
into the specifics of spells and magick, as well as what the commonly seen
pentacle/pentagram stands for, the uses and powers of crystals, herbs,
inscences, etc..., the importance of solstices/equinoxes, and so on, but it
would all be WAY too long. If I ever bother to write another article like
this, maybe I'll get into the other topics. Each one is large enough to take
up it's own article. Until then...
