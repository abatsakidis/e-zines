If there is only one thing that bugs me and it does the most it's me being 
stereotyped. I HATE BEING LABELLED!!!!
Ohh! No! He's a teenager you better follow him around Bobby in the store cuz
he might steal something. While I hear this conversation going on I see a 
40-year old man giving himself a five-finger discount. SO what I'm a teenager
does that qualify me to be on america's most wanted or something. I would 
like to be able to see 1 adult that has not been a teenager. Kids don't get 
any different, we might change the styles a bit and the music we listen to
but our attitudes our probably very similar to what adults were like during
these years.The clothes don't mean much anyway, he comes from the "hood"
, you can tell by his baggy clothes OR how about this one "he's a freak" Why?
" I don't know he just looks like one". How can you judge somebody just by
the way they dress and not by how they act. Now if you saw somebody 
sticking their head out of a moving car when a lampost is 5 feet away from 
their head THEN they are a freak.

One of the funniest things I've done though is to see the way people act 
towards me solely on the way I was dressed. One day I was dressed all nice 
with my shirt tucked in and stuff. People would talk to me at bus stops and
be really pleasant. When I dressed in black from head to toe though... thats
a different story. Mother's would walk between their children and me ( almost
as if I could poison them or something) and people wouldn't even look me in
the eye when they were talking to me (not unless I knew them).

So basically I hate stereotypes even though I stereotype people all the time
(part of being a human being I guess.. It sucks but what can we do) that's 
about it for now.
