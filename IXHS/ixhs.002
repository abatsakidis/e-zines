issue 2
about sexual preference
by shot gun


        It's everyone's favourite topic: homosexuality. Why does it 
impact so many peoples lives? I don't see why it's so hated among so many 
people. It's one thing I don't understand. I'm heterosexual, yet I cannot
understand it at all. 
        It seems as though the people who hate it, think it evil and 
unnatural. Hmm, I disagree. Evil because why is it evil? I have recieved no
explnations at all. Unnatural because what? This is illogical for a homo-
sexual person was not altered at birth or anytime during their life. 
        It's a stupid thing that the government <national and municipal> have
not given all the rights a heterosexual has to a homosexual person. It's like       
they think homsexuality is a disease. It is not. It cannot be spread like 
one. 
        The ignorant ones who see it as being wrong and unnatural fail to see
the other side. What if the population was mainly made up of homosexuals and
there were only a few heterosexuals <yes, other way around>. Wouldn't 
heterosexuality be seen as wrong and unnatural? Hmm.
        Another thing that never ceases to amaze me is that exclamation 'Oh
what a fag!'. What the hell does that mean? Is homosexuality physically 
visible? Last time I checked it wasn't.
        What agravates me even further is the fact the church calls it wrong
too. I don't see the sense in this either <not much makes sense to me on this
topic :> >. I guess this is where the ignorance of it comes from. The church
itself.
        Difference between a black man and a white man is the same as a 
homo to a heterosexual. It's as simple as that.
