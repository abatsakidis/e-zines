about an opinion war crimes of world war 2
by shot gun

                                ***

well, here's another possibly contraversial article. over 50 years ago, the
nazi's had pretty well most of the jews working in slave factories producing
arms, or in concentration camps or just killed. well, after the war, hundreds
upon hundreds of veteran/retired nazis were charged with war crimes. they 
were either given jail time or even killed. but, some of these ex-nazis
found their way to canada. 

what i'm going to be saying for the rest of this article, may really offend
some people who feel strongly against the nazis and what they did. 
furthermore, to make it clear, i am not a nazi, nor do i want to be. i am just 
expressing an opinion i have. so please, if you are offended, feel free to
send me your opinions on my board or any board i am on.

war crimes. everyone's heard of that word. there are many ex-nazis living
in canada right now, and some have been charged with war crimes. but it has
been 50 years since they did anything.

these men that the canadian government are charging are like 70-90 years old.
i mean, why waste money on them to charge and deport them? if i have read
correctly, these people are good citizens. 

what happened 50 years ago shouldn't reflect what they are now. we always 
talk about giving people second chances. sure, these ex-nazis are supposedly
'very evil people'. but, explain something to me, after they got out of the
german army, how come they didn't continue killing people? these retired
soldiers living in canada led very peaceful, productive lives after the war.
well, most of them at least.

i believe that these retired soldiers should be left alone for a couple
reasons. and here they are:

1. they were the weapons, not the killers.
2. they lived for 50 years in peace, in canada.
3. what would you do if you were them?

let me explain the first one. they were the weapons. they weren't killers.
these soldiers were like in their early adulthood when they were drafted. 
they didn't know any better. it was the german generals and other higher 
officers who turned them into the 'monsters' they were. see, it shouldn't be
the average soldier to be charged, it should have been the leaders who trained
them. i'm not saying the average soldier shouldn't be charged, he just 
shouldn't be charged as much as the leaders. how fair is it for a human to be
only influenced by one thing? these soldiers were only influenced by nazi-way
and that is how they grew up. how is it possible for them to know what is
right and what is wrong? the nazis brainwashed them. they couldn't possibly
know. don't blame the weapon. blame the killer. <disclaimer: i may be totally
wrong about this; the 'weapons' may have not been charged at all. but i'm
pretty sure a lot of them were.>

i've already explained the second one, so lets go onto the third one. what
would you do if you were in their place? these soldiers were under an 
ulltimatum: either their life, or the jews. see, if one were to disobey, they
would have been killed. this is how it is in a facist military. like most of
us, we'd want to live, correct? exactly why they listened so obediantly. 
also, they were brainwashed, so they were more prone to listening than
disobeying, right? the germans created a lot of fear in them. these
soldiers were scared of their leaders. these soldiers, in my opinion, were 
very much oppressed.

in closing, i think the government should stop charging the average soldier
with war crimes. they should go and get the leaders. maybe they don't go
for the average soldier, i'm not sure. but, if you look at it logically, 
these retired soldiers lived for decades of peace and tranquility. what other
'so-called' monsters can do this?
