i've got you now, my dear


it's the needle in the finger
you pricked me with
comes in the poison 
of that love you gave me

they're the robots in battle
and i'm losing 
to the army you lead
it's only a sting...

it's the shards of glass
underneath my skin
but you still press against my body
searing pain as they go in deeper

it's the blood pouring down
filled with me 
you take it like honey
like that love you gave me

it's the spider's web you've got me in
dangling from a pole
and you're about to let it slip
but i won't let you go

it's like the turn table in a game
and now it's all in my favour
you've made me bleed to long
it's time for you to feel it

it's like the fire in my eyes
and it's the lust in my heart
it's the words in my mouth
it's that bind that won't break

i've got you now, my dear
it's only a matter of time
before you're bread in my heads
i've got you now, my dear

it's the thing i'll fought so long
for being afraid to let it go
it's leaking little by little
i've got you now, my dear

i've got you now, my dear
i've got you now, my dear
you've got me, my dear
it's where you wanted me to be.
