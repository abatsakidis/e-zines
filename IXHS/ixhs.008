about how to become an 3l33+  \/\/4r3z d00d in a little over an hour.
by homer simpson
        
        o.k., well, this file isn't something for all the wanna be warez 
kiddes to read so that they'll know how to become an 3l33+ trader, I
wrote this to show that it isn't that tough(as most warez people say)
to get on a 0-3 board and be in some groups/have some reference.

        last week i was really, i mean really bored, so i decided to
see what all the fuss is about on the warez trading scene about how if you  
trade really well, for a long time, you become 3l33+.so, i looked on a bbs
list somewhere, and got the phone number for'forgotten sins',a warez bbs
.well i called there, filled out my new user aplication(using a different 
name)and then the sop broke into chat, and for some reason gave me a leech
account(for what reason I still don't know)and invited me to join his warer
group 'sins'.so,with my new affil,achived from 5 min on the warez scene 
I downloaded what little0-3/0-7 warez it had, about 1 meg(it was a not 
very well known bbs) andthen looked on this bbs's board list and got 
the number for 'the den' a 0-7 bbs.
 

***so after 5 min., i have an afilliation, and  1 meg of 0-7 warez,a board
reference, and a user reference***

        so i called this board, made myself a new account, uploaded the
i had, and downloaded a bunch of 0-3 from this bbs, again looked at
a bbs list, and got a number for a 0-3 board.When I was about to logg off
the sop broke into chat, and we chated, i taked in my cool hip-hop/street
vocabulary, and i had a nother user reference....wow, this is hard so far.

****after 20 min., I have 1 affil, 3 megs of 0-3, 2 user refference, 2
board refferences, and the number of a 0-3 board and it's nup***

        So, I called up this board( 'revolver' i belive, oozie being
the nup) and applied for axs, putting everything I had gained thusfar
to work, well this was the loggest part, because i had to wait to
be voted in. i called back about 40-60 min later, and found i had
been voted in, so i uploaded my 0-3 and got a whack of credits.


there, a little over 1 hour, i have and affil, user reference,
board refferences,an account on a elite(i use this loosely) warez
board, creditis on this bbs..err...i don't think that that took
to much time/effort, yet some people i talk to(like the sop of 'the den'
) claim to have been on the scence for 5 years and and uploaded terrabites
of warez, yet, how come some lamer like myself can be on the scene
for all of an hour,who uploade upload 4 megs of warez be on one
of the selfproclamed fastest boards in 613?You tell me.I think that
warez trading is said to be alot harder that in really is, in
a fultile attempt by the traders to make themselves look kool.

        well thats just my point of view, any question?leave me mail
        at most 613 hpavc boards, or any fhg site worldwide.
