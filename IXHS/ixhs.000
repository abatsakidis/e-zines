issue introduction
by shot gun
:

        of all the things the 6i3/8i9 needs right now is some quality. this
new group <not really a group yet, it's just me right now> will try to get
some quality information out into circuitry. iXHS, which stands for 
'information express of helter skelter' will try to spread information on
every topic, may it be significant or not, from electronics and telephony to
what's bugging them. essentially, it will try to undo the boredom of reading
an e-zine and fill the readers head with some information.

short history:        
        
        i started this group just tonight and it will be distributed tonight.
it's been an ambition of mine for a month or so now since my board has 
rocketed to a great start. at first, the name would have been 'BuRN' <a name
Ruiner was going to use for his group - it never happened :) >. but, i wanted
a name that stood for something and thought 'BuRN' was too cliche. now i have
iXHS, which is well, cliche sort of <what it stands for is> but it suited me.
i wanted the board name in there somewhere to give it more popularity :>.

ambitions:

        to get this group really going, i'm going to be striving hard to get
writers that are talented in specific fields. at first, i'll try locally on 
my board and try to get my co-sysop, Ruiner, to help me out and join. then,
if i'm lucky, try to get Darkness, sysop of pointbreak, in also. 

        this little zine will be small. each pack won't be very big, unless
the groupb get's very big. there'll be a release every month at least, 
unless something unfortunate happens <or if i run out of ideas>. 

        it won't be purely information. it could be, on a small scale, 
whimsical, but still hold importance. for instance, it can be an opinion        
essay, so the writer won't have to be tied down all the time.

how to join:

        email me on any board i call regularly <my alias will be Shot Gun at
all times> so i know you want to join, then, write an article and send it to
me, and i will judge it myself and will give you feedback the next day.
