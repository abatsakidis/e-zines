                        ANARCHISTS: A lost cause.

        Today, when you look through a boards file areas, you can be pretty
sure that you will see something like: (18) ANARCHY!!!! or (34) Bombs!.
These boards have no idea what anarchy means. You ask someone who has a modem,
ask them if they're into anarchy. They'll say (1) No, I'm not. <leave them alone.>
or (2) Yah! ANARCHY RULEZ! I got so many files on it! I know how to make Nitro
Glycerin! These people are TOTAL LAMERS!!!

        According to the Oxford Dictionary of Current English,

Anarchy: n. disorder, esp. political; lack of government: anarchic.
Anarchist: n. advocate of anarchism; anarchistic
Anarchism: n. belief that government and law should be abolished.

I don't see anything about bombs, vandalism or violence... hmmm... i think
that's called TERRORISM. Anarchy does not = TERRORISM!!!

        All those people who claim to be big anarchists are nothing more than
amateur terrorists. What they do is against the current law. They are criminals,
nothing more. Anarchists don't go bomb cars for fun, they don't egg houses,
they stay within the law. They don't believe in it, but they do obey it. If they
could have their way, law and government would be abolished and people would be
totally free. They know the costs of violent anarchy. They try to prevent that.
They look upon these "anarchists"<yeah right> with nothing but contempt.

        I'm just glad I got that cleared up. :)

end file.
