disclamer - excuse bad grammar and spelling mistakes, i need to get this pak
out tonight. :)


For every 5 days a week, I attend school. From 9am to 3pm. 

School - n. institute for educating children or giving instruction.

But, that's not the case with me. All I do in school is put up with morons
who can't think for themselves. I have to sit back and listen to their 'Uh..
I dunno..' and their whinings about how school sucks. Yeah, school sucks, but
they say it sucks because TV tells them it does. I say it sucks for a dif-
ferent reason - I don't learn anything; I have to wait for the others to 
catch up. This may sound pretencious, but what's so pretencious about truth?

There are others like me in this situation - we sit in school, aggravated,
trying to keep sane and not schooting everybody in the facility. Constant
annoyances keep poking at my brain. 

Learn - v.t. to gain knowledge of or skill in.

No, that does not apply with me. I want to learn something, but I have to 
wait. And I have to teach myself, but I have questions and when I present 
them, the teacher is usually busy or just can't answer the question. I hate
feeling like I'm getting stupider everyday because I have to sit back and 
wait for the morons to catch up, knowing full-well they won't catch up.

Progressing in school for me is more-or-less an oxymoron. I don't learn any-
thing, not just for the reason of everyone else is just not as intelligent, 
but also because I can't concentrate. There's so much noise and the like, 
that I can't help, but get pissed off. At this very moment, people behind me
are talking about what their complexion is and not paying attention to what
they were assigned to do.

In 30 years, these people will be running the country and will be the
citizens; it'll be hell. It will be hell. I am already anti-social enough and
people dare ask me why. Use your head, can you blame me for being this way?

There's no thought required in what you're going to wear tommorow. Why does
it seem like people don't need to use their brain? What are they going to do
when they realize everything that they talk about will not apply when they
go out and try to make a living for themselves.

Sure, I guess they shouldn't care now, but they have to learn some
responsibily. I admit, I get like this sometimes, but I keep it to a minimum.
Unlike some of the others who just don't care. We are going downhill socially
and now this downhill direction is doubling in speed.

Maybe I'm just being paranoid and an asshole, but I believe what I say. This
doesn't go for all the people in my class/school but most fit into this 
category. 

Always, the biggest concern is what to look like tommorow. Sure, I may wear
drab clothes, but I like them. I don't care for wearing the over-priced 
fashions. They'll just go out of 'style' anyway :P. I've always wondered why
people want to fit into the 'crowd'. I mean, what's the point? Why strive so
hard to become 'cool' when it won't lead you anywhere. 

Fads are alwasy a problem. Wearing 'No Fear' shirts and writing 'Adidas' on
your backpack doesn't make you any more of a person than you are. It doesn't
make you better or give you power. Maybe it's a self-esteem thing. If you
wear these things you'll be 'accpeted'. So what? Who cares about being 
accepted. If everyone would just be themselves, it would be a much better 
world. 

People are so scared of disagreeing with the 'in-crowd'. I wonder why. I hate
the 'in-crowd'. I hate what it stands for - television and 90210. Damn it's 
agravating to hear 'Duh, Adidas is better than Nike.' or something equally
as stupid. 

Maybe I hate too much. Maybe I can't accept this. Well, I can't accept it.
It's just all too fake. Everyone around me thinks they know what they are 
talking about. I tell them I am a martial artist and kickboxer. And suddenly
I get respect. Why? Television makes it so much better than it really is. 
Martial arts, etc. isn't a big thing. All you have to do is join some local
club and you can consider yourself a martial artist. Frustration.

I don't want my world to collapse into a heaping pile of dogshit - bad 
analogy but you get my, err, drift.  

All in all, I don't do much in school but listen to lectures and get angry
at idiots.

Strive to be the same - motto for Generation X.
