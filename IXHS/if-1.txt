Aborb the sounds that surround you
Breathe deeply and smell it's interest
Find yourself stuck in the same place
Familiarize yourself with what you have

You will never get back the simplest thing
The people will always push you down
The clinging vines on the side of the pits
Are falling to the ground

Hand over all the things you find
You will not need anything from this day
You will soon see how life will untwine
Nothing will ever be the same again

Listen to all the things that are important
Reject everything that is useless
Think about what you are going to do
Realize there is nothing to do

Yeah, we had our days, didn't we dear?
Yeah, we had the greatest times
Now that those things are in the past
We might as well as leave it behind

Many times you crossed the line
Everytime I have extended it
You had to test my elasticity
Now, I snap back; it hurts, doesn't it?

Accept the end of our feuding ways
Feel the coldness chill your heart
Whisper those words of harmony I told
Hum the tunes we used to sing together

Have you ever seen me sleep at night
My frustrated face seems calmer now
Now I have all this time in my hands
I will not waste it like I did with you

Yeah, we had our days, didn't we dear? 
Yeah, we had the greatest times
Now that those things are in the past
We might as well leave it all behind

Maybe I will crawl through the window
Of your mind to see you one last time
I will leave you a few words while you sleep
It will be important words that you will not hear

As time progresses, I will find a moment
To open that book I call my memories
And take a look before I throw in in the fire
And I will see all those miseries disappear

Should I knock on your door when I pass your house
The next time I am ever near?
Will I bring myself up to it again
Do I even have enough nerves, my dear?

Yeah, we had our days, didn't we dear?
Yeah, we had the greatest times
Now that those things are in the past
We might as well leave it all behind

Now that the book is in the fire
I can still remember the things you said
I guess I saved myself my favourite pages
And they are locked in a box with no key

I will softly sing those dying tunes
As my heart hides away to weep
I will hold in all the pain
Hoping it disappears when I sleep.
