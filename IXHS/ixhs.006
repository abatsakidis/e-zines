                              "Rent to own."
        
        Well, this is the first file that I have written that should be 
of any quality.  I wrote for FLaK 9 and 17.  Both of my articles sucked.  I
hope for this one to be quite different.  It is hard to think of something to
write for 'zines.  I am going to write a little video rental scam.  
        Out here in 303(Colorado,) we have a very known chain of video rental 
stores called "Blockbuster Video."  They also have a chain of "Blockbuster
Music" stores.  They sell music.  The only different thing about this store
is they allow you to listen to the album you are interested in before you 
buy it.  This makes it extremely easy to stick the album in your pocket,
but I won't get into this.  This is about video rental.
        The video rental stores out here (most of which are Blockbuster) 
give a "Rental Card."  These cards are a cheap piece of paper that has your
last info on it, and is laminated.  When you get your card, they ask you for
all your information (via phone numbers, full names, addresses, etc) so they
can get ahold of you if your video/video game/whatever is late.  These cards
are not "charge cards" or anything.  You still have to pay 3.50 for the video
or whatever you are renting.  The card is just to verify that they can get
ahold of you, and you are not planning on keeping the videos because it will
cost you.
        There are many ways to get these cards.  You can either find one,
make one of your own, with all fake information given, or use an invisible
one (via "I forgot my card at home, my last name is _______".)  Now, let's 
get onto renting to own.
        Either find a card, make one, or get all of a local renters 
information, and memorize it.  Walk into your local video store, grab 
everything you want.  We'll say you grab Pamela Andersons latest video,
and 6 of the newest Super Nintendo games.  Walk up to the counter, and lay
the money on the table with the card on top (it would help to memorize the
info on the card as well, because at most times when they scan the card, they
will say "Shalong?" (Shalong being your first name) and you just say "Yes" to
confirm that your name is in fact "Shalong.")  But it is possible that they
may ask you more, so be ready to answer it without thinking.  If you are just 
planning on "forgetting your card at home," you will need to know more than
just your first name.  You will need to know your last name as well.  Just
go up and say "I forgot my card at home, my last name is Shmuck," and they
will most likely say something like "Shalong?" and you'll simply confirm your
name with a "Yes, ma'am."  Again, it could be helpful to memorize all of the
persons information.
        This is not very hard.  I think you will all understand what is going
on here.  To sum this up, I would have to say that the point of this would be
to buy a video game for 3.50 (or whatever the rental price is) rather than
60 bucks or so.  You have now officially "rented to own."
