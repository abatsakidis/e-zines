about opinion on an ideal society
by expendable youth


For me an Ideal society would be one were there is no government, no nations 
and no laws and regulations. This would be beneficial because the planet would 
work together as one to produce what is needed for the populace to survive and 
enjoy the life that they were given.

With no government or authority figures people would live on the trust system 
or trade what they have for something they need. Everybody would have to work 
and nobody would get anything unless they earned it or trade something for it.
The populace would be in anarchy you say; I disagree I think that after a 
while people will settle down and want to live a happy life. With street 
justice of course.

Street Justice would be the only Justice in my Ideal Society because it is the 
only justice that is really fair. Say if you hit somebody or Slandered. Then 
the person/people would come up to you and deal with you as they see fit. 
After that no grudge would be held against you in anyway... so life goes on.

This is the only possible way that I can see happen so that the Human race 
doesn't erradicate itself in the next century. With the Aristocrats and all 
playing around with peoples lives as if they were toys.

cya all l8r :)

People would live on the trust.

Street Justice would be the only Justice in my ideal society.
