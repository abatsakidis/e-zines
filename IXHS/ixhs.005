about natural weapons - your legs 
by shot gun


        your legs are a very important in any physical fight. you get more
reach out of a kick than a punch, and therfore you can keep your enemy away.
the problem with the legs are that they aren't as fast as the hands, but they
can pack as much or even more power. in a fight, you shoudl always be using 
your hands more than your legs, it's just more logical and faster.
        i won't be describing how to do kicks because it's much too 
complicated. it is much easier showing you in person, but...
        lets get down to basics of it all.

stance:         the fighting stance. this is how you will stand in a fight. 
        i'm only a first degree black belt karate practitioner so i can never, 
        in anyway, call myself a master of the arts. 

        there are 2 ways you can stand, the tradtional <old fashion> way or
        the modern martial arts way. mind you, some modern martial arts use
        the traditional way.

        the traditional way, is more or less how a boxer stands, but one
        hand is infront and lower, where ther other is behind that leading
        hand and is usually there to protect the face. one leg is usually
        a bit behind the other for balance. the body is facing the opponent
        so you can use both hands at once. to my understanding, most kung-fu
        schools teach you to stand this way. 

        the modern way, is when only your side is exposed to your enemy so
        your enemy has a very little target. i perfer this stance, because it
        applies both traditional and modern <err>. what i mean is that even
        though you are only exposing on side of your body, when you attack,
        that is when you turn your body towards your opponent and do a full 
        force attack <do you get it?>. the way you stand is, your most
        powerful hand will be high and protecting the face <i usaully put 
        mine at my cheek> and the other is at your side protecting your ribs.
        though, i usually out-stretch the lower hand a bit more so when a 
        kick comes in, it doesn't come anywhere close to my body.


        the natural stance. this stance is usually more taught in kung fu
        than in karate, but this stance is usually just logic. all it is, is
        a laid back but ready stance. a stance that's not threatening, but
        when an attack comes, you'll be ready. never tryto instigate a fight.
        never, when someone is about to attack, so that you are ready becuase
        usually, if you do that, you'll stiffen up, and if you stiffen up,
        your moves will not be as fast.


kicks:  these are fun to practise. they are hard to do without practise.
        kicking requires a lot of control and balance, and that's why a 
        human tends to punch more than kick in a brawl. the problem is, is
        that people don't know how to execute a proper kick. a lot of people
        kick and their toes hit first. in a round the house kick, you must
        point your foot/toes so you won't break them. in a front kick <also
        known as a snapping toe kick in kung fu>, either point your toes/foot
        forward or bend them back so the ball of your foot hits what your 
        kicking. in a sidekick, you want the side or heel of your foot to 
        hit. the sidekick is more of a pushing away kick, but it is painful
        none-the-less, just think of whiplash when you think about getting
        kicked by a sidekick by me. :)

shuffling:      in karate, all this is, is a little hopping back and forth.
        you see this a lot in point fighting, especially with younger people.
        i do this a lot when i kickbox, i usually get a faster kick, and 
        better reach since i'm sort of jumping at them <but it's not an 
        obvious attack>. what's great about this is that your opponent will
        not know what an attack comes, when they see me shuffling like a
        boxer/kick boxer does, they will be intimidated because i am ready
        to attack them anytime <you can do this with no hopping/shuffling, 
        but i find you get better reach if you do>. a set back about this is
        that, don't do it in a street fight, because you do not want them to
        know you are ready to kick ass.
