all that you deserved


it's the feeling of snakes in my heart
it's the broken glass in my eyes
it's all coming back to me
but still, i tell you lies
they were the words that you
had to hear a long time ago
it's the way it's supposed to be
now i've got myself stuck

it's the broken mirrors on the floor
that distort the words i say
it's the cannon in the fields
i'll explode it to you oneday
it's the gum that make it stick
it's the mud that makes it unclear
it's my feelings i protect
the words i say, i've been meaning to hear

it was all meant foryou
but somehow i'm not so sure
the glue that blinds us weakens
the ties that keep us together strengthens
it's the weael on my tongue
that took what you deserved
i'll have to refine to go stronger
but you have to wait for me

will you wait for me?
