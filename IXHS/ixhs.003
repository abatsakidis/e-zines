about natural weapons - arms
by shot gun
:

        your natural weapons: your arms and legs - among others.
        this is my file on how to make and use these weapons effectively
for the most pain in the shortest time possible. so lets get started.

section: arms

        your arms are what you should be using the most in a fight. the 
strikes include jabs, reverses, looping punches, upper
cuts, backfists, knife and ridgehands, palm-heel strike, elbows, chops
and finger sets.

jabs:   these are, or should be, he quickest punches. it should be executed 
        using the weaker arm. make a regular fist <4 fingers curled into the
        palm, and thumb goes over the first and second fingers> and do a 
        punching motion. this punch is not all that powerful, but it is good
        to surprise that oponnent of yours. 

        jabs should always be aimed at, or near the head. these punches are
        too weak to be effective against body blows. and as the saying goes 
        'the hand is quicker than the eye' so if you do it perfectly and 
        correctly, your opponent, literally, won't see what's coming to him.

        what makes a jab really work is the next natural weapon.

reverse:        this punch should be excusted right after the jab. this is 
        the finishing punch. this is the most powerful punch. when you 
        execute a jab, bring that arm back in and as you bring it in, 
        execute the reverse punch. 

        this punch should be executed by making a regular fist. it should 
        also be used by the stronger arm for more power. remember when you
        do it, is to turn your body 180 degrees for maximum distance in the
        punch, because most likely, your opponent will see this punch and 
        will likely backup, so therefore you'll need the reach.

        what's great about this punch is that it is universal. you can hit
        any target with it and make your oppenent feel pain.

looping:        looping punches are the fun ones. these ones should be used
        if you have a lot of time to execute something. the punch does not
        go straight like a reverse or a jab - it loops, hence the name. it's 
        aimed mainly for the side of the head or ribs. 

        it isn't a great punch, but is a good enough weapon. what's terrible
        about it though is that it's not that practical in a street fight. 
        in boxing or kickboxing maybe, but not in a schoolyard fight, etc. 
        it just takes too long. unless you have fast hands, it could actually
        be a good punch.

        what's sad is that a lot of people, who are untrained in fighting,
        do looping punches. remember, the shortest route from point a to
        b is a straight line.

uppercuts:      the famous punch. it's not very practical either. it's aimed
        at the chin or throat. this takes time also. 

        since it is a pumping up motion - unnatural - it takes a lot of speed
        and power to make it effective. 

        since you have to bring your hand down to execute it, it may leave
        an opening. so, all in all, don't use this punch unless it's the 
        only thing availible.

backfists:      this things sting. they are as effective as jabs. this is
        an arching motion using the back of your hand/fist. it should be 
        used for the head and only the head. it's probably the fastest punch
        you can get. it uses the snap of your elbow for power, not your 
        shoulder.

        this weapon can be used in a combination of a backfist reverse, or
        backfist and a kick. <kicks will be explained in the next issue>.

knifehand:      the knifehand is basically a karate chop. it's a chop. to
        use it, you use the back edge of your hand. your can chop anywhere
        with these things. they aren't that powerful, but they are good 
        setups for other punches and kicks.

        to make a knifehand is simple. unfold your hand to make it straight.
        all fingers out and together, like when your shaking someone's hand
        but with straight fingers. strike with the pinky edge of the hand
        whereas where you strike with the thumb edge of your hand in a ridge
        hand.

ridgehand:      basically the same principal as the knifehand, but using
        opposite sides. one key thing is to tuck in the thumb so you won't
        break it.

        use this strike against the temple/side of the head.

palm-heel:      this strike is executed by using the heel of your palm. 
        it should be used against the chin or nose. 

        to make one, make a knifehand, then curl in all the fingers to the
        second knuckle. after that, arch the hand back against the arm
        so you have that palm-heel sticking out. and there you have it.

elbows: do i really have to explain this one? it's self explanitory. whatever
        i say, the half-idiot would already know.

fingersets:     these are fun. these are what you sue to poke/scratch out the
        eyes. it can be used with the v-form of of the first and second 
        finger or all the fingers. make it look like your about to scratch
        someone with all your fingers and you have a palm heel.
