GREETING FROM LORI ELDRIDGE
======================================================

Greetings Everyone,

My ISP decided to discontinue dial-up service on the first of
the month so please take note of my new email address below. Most of
my web pages can be reached through PZ's home page.

Lots of things happening in the news this month. Berit Kjos summed up
the UN religious and world governing summits quite nicely. Does
anyone beside me see the parallel between these world gatherings
aimed at a one world religion/government and what happened before God
destroyed the Tower of Babel? We also have an article by our
assistant editor, Bob Ippolito, showing how the internet is being
controlled just like our media.  Toping the list of articles is another
excellent article by Dr. Jack Van Impe on signs of the second coming.

Be blessed,

Lori Eldridge

A Message From Dr. Jack Van Impe:
The Signs of His Second Coming
(http://www.jvim.com)
======================================================

The Signs of His Second Coming

Revelation 17 warns of the rise of a one-world religious system, which will
unite all false religions just before the return of Christ to earth. Do you
know the foundation for such a plan is already being laid? Powerful forces
are at work today to create a United Religions organization that mimics the
United Nations in structure, scope and authority.
The second sign Jesus predicted as a precursor of His return has to do with
"Wars and rumors of wars." In other words, the planet will be consumed in
violence, revolution, upheaval and chaos. It will not just be nation against
nation, but "kingdom against kingdom" -- indicating the political map of the
world will need to be redrawn. Have we not seen the early stages of this
phenomenon in the 1990's as one of the largest and most powerful empires of
all time-the Soviet Union-imploded suddenly and almost without warning? Have
we not witnessed the rise of another empire in the East as China emerges as
an economic and military superpower? Have we not observed the maps of
Eastern Europe and Central Asia being completely redrawn?

Today we see brother fighting against brother, tribe against tribe, in
Albania, Rwanda, Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya, Sudan and, of course, in the
Middle East -the center stage for the unfolding prophetic drama. But there's
more. Jesus continued, And there shall be famines, and pestilences, and
earthquakes, in diverse places," Matthew 24:7. Famines? Recently I reported
in the Van Impe Intelligence Briefing that the world's leading agricultural
scientists say we are headed for an unprecedented global food shortage
beyond the scope of anything modern man can imagine. They said that because
the developing world's population is expected to grow by 2 billion in the
next few years, those countries least able to produce food will need at
least 75 percent more.

Yet, despite advances in technology, food production around the world is
growing at its slowest rate in four decades and is actually on the decline
in at least 90 countries. Grain stocks are at their lowest levels in 35
years.  Diseases that won’t go away Pestilences? It would have been hard to
imagine, even a generation ago, that the world would be preoccupied with
infectious diseases and plagues. After all, thanks to immunizations and
better drugs, scientists were confidently predicting the demise of many
common, yet threatening, illnesses. Some even went on record saying that
certain diseases would soon be gone forever. How wrong they were. Not only
have these diseases refused to go away, they have increased dramatically.
Not only in the under-developed nations, but here in North America as well.

Even leaving deadly AIDS out of the equation, common infections such as
pneumonia are killing more people than ever. Why? Because of the growing
resistance to the very antibiotics that were supposed to save us. As grave
as the situation is in the United States, it is even worse throughout the
rest of the world. Global incidences of cholera, tuberculosis, diphtheria
and bubonic plague have skyrocketed in the past five years. The
mosquito-borne illness dengue, which produces deadly fevers, has shown up in
Latin America and the Caribbean for the first time in more than 20 years.
Another factor in the spreading of disease is the new levels of
international travel and mixing of populations that has occurred only in the
latter part of the 20th century. As Nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg put it:
"We have created the perfect world for the bugs to take over."

Earthquakes? Is it our imagination or have more and more violent quakes
shaken the tectonic plates of our earth in recent years? Or is it simply
better technology that allows us to measure them and report them to the
world instantaneously? Perhaps it is both. The truth is we are witnessing a
dramatic upsurge in earthquake and volcanic activity throughout the globe.
According to the U.S. Geological Survey, from 1890 to 1930, there were only
eight quakes measuring 6.0 or larger. From 1930 to 1960, there were 18. From
1960 to 1979, however, there were 64 "killer" quakes. And from 1980 to 1996,
there were more than 200.
What does Jesus tell us next? Then shall they deliver you up to be
afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my
name's sake. This worldwide persecution of the church is taking place in
increasing numbers and nations even as you read these words. Christians in
the North America are suddenly awakening to the extent of the slaughter and
repression of believers in Communist and Islamic nations. I've just seen a
report that indicates Christians in India and in many Muslim nations are
being hunted down and persecuted in record numbers. Michael Horowitz of the
Hudson Institute has called Christians "the Jews of the 21st century."

The horrors are unspeakable in some Islamic countries, where Christians are
being literally crucified for their faith. In China, the underground
church-members of which are subject to arrest just for reading the Bible-is
said to be larger than the entire evangelical community in the United
States. Even here in the enlightened West, we are seeing the emergence of
anti-Christian bigotry in the media, in government and in the popular
culture.  The Struggle will continue And then shall many be offended, and
shall betray one another, and shall hate one another, Jesus says in Matthew
24:10. Does this sound familiar? Have you ever known a time in history in
which people are so easily offended over nothing? Now that the Ten
Commandments has been relegated to the scrap heap by the world-and
considered by many to be simply the Ten Suggestions-absolute standards of
right and wrong are no longer in vogue. So now we have new sets of
rules-wacky laws and regulations that cause a six-year-old boy to be kicked
out of school for innocently kissing a girl on the cheek. "Sexual
harassment," they called it. This in an age when all-too-many schoolchildren
are carrying guns to school and taking drugs. Think about the divorce rate.
Is not unfaithfulness or adultery the ultimate form of betrayal-whether it
is at the highest level of government or in the bedroom of the average
citizen?

That's the world we're living in today-a world in which no one knows whom to
trust anymore, a world in which nothing, not even the most loving
relationships, seem permanent and lasting. A world that is leaping headlong
toward a seven-year Tribulation hour which, praise God, will be followed by
an era of peace such as the world has never known. However, we are not quite
there yet!

So let’s continue. Think about the enmity people have for one another around
the world. It's not just nation rising up against nation, it's brother
fighting with brother. Look at Bosnia and Rwanda where people who look like
one another, and even speak the same language, are merciless in their
bloodlust and commitment to ethic cleansing. The latest killing field is
Albania, where civil war is wreaking havoc because the people feel
"betrayed" by their own government. In the last days, not only will people
look to false Christs, but will also flock to false prophets (Matthew 24:5,
11, 24). Today, we see self-proclaimed gurus, many of whom wear clerical
garb, telling us we are being misled by the truth of the Holy Scriptures.
They suggest a better way, or multiple ways, or more convenient ways, or
ways that do not offend the masses of reaching God. They misrepresent the
Word of God. They distort it. They read it out of context. They ignore
passages they do not like. They search in vain for new passages that
validate their blasphemous beliefs. In addition to quasi-Christians peddling
a false gospel, we have the New Age charlatans spreading demonically
inspired ideas about channeling, chanting and other neo-pagan myths, relying
on crystals instead of Christ. Because of this situation, Jesus said: "the
love of many shall wax cold." (Matthew 24:12)

But the news, even in this trying time, is not all bad. God is still in
charge. One day He will bring ultimate peace to our world. However, that
time has not yet come. Jesus said, And this gospel of the kingdom shall be
preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations. Then and only
then, Jesus says in verse 14, shall the end come, meaning the end of this
age, not the world. Then Jesus, our Lord and Savior, shall appear with
lightning speed in a blaze of glory. (Matthew 24:27)

Do you realize, that only in this age of modern communications and world
travel could even the most isolated peoples be reached with the Word of God?
Today it is happening! The same technology that makes global government a
threat, makes it easier than ever to blanket the globe with the truth.
That's what our ministry is all about: fulfilling the Great Commission. Did
you know that there are more than 6,000 languages spoken in this world
today? Never before has the Bible been translated into so many of these
tongues-even some spoken by obscure tribal peoples with no access to radio,
television, the Internet or even the written word.

Yes, my friends so much is happening in our world today to show that we are
the generation about which Jesus spoke in Matthew 24:34. And no signs are
more important than the rebirth of the state of Israel in 1948 and the
recapturing of Jerusalem by the Jews in 1967. The sheer existence of Israel
is a testament to the truth of the prophets and the fact that God keeps His
word. And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away
captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the
Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. And there shall be
signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth
distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; Men's
hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are
coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. And then
shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
An when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, lift up your
heads; for your redemption draweth nigh. And he spake to them a parable;
Behold the fig tree, and all the trees; When they now shoot forth, ye see
and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand. So likewise ye,
when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is
nigh at hand. Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away,
till all be fulfilled. (Luke 21:24-32)Jesus is coming soon

So the good news is that Jesus is returning! He is coming back! And this
time, He's staying on earth to rule personally for 1,000 years. Even that is
only the beginning, because He is establishing an earthly kingdom that will
last forever--in a world without end. (Isaiah 9:7; Isaiah 45:17, Ephesians
3:21; Luke 1:33; Hebrews 1:8). The prayer of every believer should be even
so, come Lord Jesus (Revelation 22:20).The Nations are Judged

Now let’s fast forward the clock of time and return to the subject at hand.
The terrible seven years of Tribulation has ended. Prophecy after prophecy
has been fulfilled, and we have now entered the glorious Millennium, that
thousand-year period of calm and serenity that has come about solely because
Christ is our earthly ruler and Lord. However, it will also be a time when
Jesus judges the nations. This will occur in the valley of Jehoshaphat, in
the Kidron valley, below the eastern gate following the battle of
Armageddon. I have always thought it to be ironic that Christ judges the
nations in the same spot where he was betrayed in the garden of Gethsemane.

Now you may ask, Why will Jesus judge the nations? What have they done to
deserve this judgment? First, a point of clarification. This is not the
judgment of Revelation 20:11-15, that general judgment of the world, which
we call the Great Judgment Day. The judgment to which we are now referring
is the one that prepares the people for the millennial reign, the
thousand-year rule of Christ upon earth. In Matthew 25:31-46, we see God
judging the nations because the world’s inhabitants did or did not receive
Christ, did or did not receive the mark of the beast, and because they did
or did not persecute Yahweh’s wife, the Jews. Let’s delve deeper to
establish who these people are. First, there are the ones-on the right,
according to Scripture-who have shown love for the Jewish people and then
for all people because of the Spirit of Christ living within them. These
accepted the message of Christ's Kingdom including their belief in the
efficacy of the cross and the shed blood of our Savior (John 1:29). And what
does Christ say to those who have shown love and have prepared their hearts
by receiving the message of Calvary? Come you blessed of my Father, inherit
the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world (Matthew
25:34). I cannot think of anything more exciting in Scripture than to
realize that the coming of the King was planned from the creation and
foundation of the world. Now, all is ready, and He says to those who
believe, Come! Your hearts are ready. You have believed, and now you will
receive your reward-that is to live with me on earth for one thousand
glorious years.

The Ultimate Purging

But what of the others, those on the "left hand" who have demonstrated
hatred toward so many? These are the bigots, the racists, those who have
thrived on the venom of anti-Semitism, who failed to come to the cross to
receive the Savior’s forgiveness. These individuals sought neither a new
heart nor a changed life through Christ's work at Calvary. What happens to
those who have missed the mark? Matthew 25:41 says, Then shall he say to
them on the left hand, depart from me you cursed into everlasting fire. That
is the ultimate purging as the lost are eliminated. Only those who have
accepted Jesus enter the earthly Kingdom and enjoy the great and glorious
beginning of the next phase of life. Satan has been bound, and the saved are
entering and enjoying the Kingdom for which believers prayed for centuries
(Matthew 6:10). No sinners remain to influence the redeemed for evil.
Something else is extremely interesting in this context. In Daniel chapter
12, verses 11 and 12, we see a mention of 1290 and 1335 days. This passage
says, And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and
the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two
hundred and ninety days. Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the
thousand three hundred and five and thirty days. What is the significance of
these numbers? Clearly, we know the tribulation period will last 2520 days
because that is exactly seven years long (Daniel 9:27). A Jewish month was
30 days, so if you multiply 30 days a month by 12 months you get 360, and 7
years of that becomes 2520, and one half of that becomes 1260. Note that in
Revelation 11:3 and Revelation 12:6 it talks about the final 1260 day reign
of Antichrist. What does it mean? As mentioned previously, we know that the
Tribulation period will last 2520 days according to the Jewish calendar
(Daniel 9:27). Now one half of that is 1260 days. But what about the 1290
days? Why the additional 30 days? Because when Christ comes, the first thing
he does is destroy the Antichrist, his works and the false prophet by
casting them into the lake of fire. We see this is Revelation 19:20, And the
beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before
him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast,
and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake
of fire burning with brimstone.

So Christ judges the corruption that has existed under the regime of these
evil ones and that takes 30 days. Next, the text mentions 45 more additional
days for a total of 1335. Why? Because Christ judges the nations and their
inhabitants. But how can He possibly do this in such a short period of time?
Because believers who returned with Him share in the judgment of the world
(I Corinthians 6:2). And oh what a time of rejoicing this will be as Christ
ushers in a theocracy-the rule of God upon earth for centuries to come. Many
continue to misunderstand that it is only after the thousand years when
Christ is re-commissioned that the eternal kingdom continues in total
perfection. Please don’t misunderstand. Righteous living will occur during
the Millennium but not a time of perfection because those who entered the
Kingdom after the judgment of the nations in Matthew 25 will still be housed
in normal bodies containing old natures. Because of this situation, millions
rebel against Christ’s authority through their descendants at the conclusion
of the thousand years (Revelation 20:7-10).It’s important to remember that
when we who are raptured return with Christ to that Holy City of Revelation
21:9 to 22:15, we will have bodies that no longer sin because they are like
our Lord’s. We were translated, changed, made new creations on the way up
(Philippians 3:20). But those who remained still have their old bodies
containing the old Adamic nature. They will still procreate and have
children, and their children will have children who can sin. Because of this
situation, Christ must rule the nations with a rod of iron (Psalm 2:9,
Revelation 19:15).

The Rule of the Rod of Iron

Because Christ establishes a theocracy on earth, He now administers His
power to subdue mankind’s stubborn natures (Psalm 2:9). But that’s not all.
He also rules with a rod of iron to keep people in line even when there's no
devil to tempt them, even when there's no worldliness allowed, no riotous
living, because of Christ’s control over the subjects of His kingdom.
Imagine. Millions go into His kingdom as righteous people but bear children
who turn away from the Lord. I've always felt if the Lord can't convince
people of His power and majesty after a thousand years of earthly reign,
that it’s nothing short of amazing when we preach the gospel in our day that
people actually get saved and begin their walk with the Lord. I have always
seen this as one of the greatest miracles of all.

Another question I am often asked is If the devil is bound during this time,
and Jesus is on earth ruling and reigning with a rod of iron, how is it
possible for sin to remain so rampant? Here is the answer. There are three
things that make us sin: the world, the flesh and the devil. First, the
devil becomes helpless and is ruled out of the picture because Christ comes
and binds Satan for a thousand years, (Revelation 20, verses 1 to 3) and
casts him into the bottomless pit where he co-exists with the beast and
false prophet (Revelation 19:20; Revelation 20:10).

Secondly, because Christ rules with a rod of iron, there will be no strip
shows, no pornography, no drunkenness, no drug addiction, no overt
expression of evil of any kind. Christ simply will not allow it (Revelation
19:15). So what is left? The flesh! Remember there are still great
multitudes in the Millennium with bodies possessing old natures and James
1:13 states: Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God for God
cannot be tempted of evil, neither tempteth he any man. But every man is
tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed. So sin occurs
because of mankind’s fleshly bodies and natures.

Therefore, since the wages of sin is death, Romans 6:23, and sin when it is
finished bringeth forth death, James 1:15, mankind must still die (Isaiah
65:20). This, however, will not include the Raptured who already have
glorified bodies and enjoy a sinless life in this Holy City above earth.
They can never die again. Nevertheless, the good news concerning the earth
dwellers is that sin is limited making it possible for people to live
extended and lengthy lives during the Millennium. In fact, Isaiah 65:20 says
that a child, at 100 years of age, is considered to be practically a
teenager because sin, which brings death, is vastly limited under Christ’s
rule. So they will still be able to sin, but in a limited environment and
because of it live happier and longer lives.

But let me say it again, the ones who are hovering above the earth in the
Holy City, the ones who returned with Christ and are in their new glorified
bodies cannot sin. They live eternally beginning with the thousand-year
reign of Christ as well as during Christ’s eternal kingdom upon earth after
the Millennium. In this final Kingdom on earth, all its inhabitants will
have received glorified bodies and thus making sin impossible forever.
Presently, the stage is set for this era of righteousness and peace such as
the world has never experienced. Soon we will have heaven on earth forever
fulfilling the prayer stated in Matthew 6:10, Thy kingdom come, thy will be
done in earth, as it is in heaven.

Two UN Summits, One Millennium Goal:
Conforming Humanity to Socialist Solidarity by Berit Kjos
======================================================

The Millennium World Peace Summit
http://www.millenniumpeacesummit.org/aboutframe.html (August 28-31)
sought a spiritual foundation for a global ethic of socialist rights
and duties

The UN Millennium Summit  http://www.un.org/millennium/ (September
6-8) sought approval for a world government that would manage
natural, human, and social resources around the world by consensus

"For the first time in history religious and spiritual leaders from
the major religious traditions and from all regions of the world met
at the United Nations to pledge themselves to work for peace. They
signed this 'Commitment to Global Peace' and resolved to join
together to address the pressing problems of conflict, poverty and
the environment." Commitment to Global Peace
http://www.millenniumpeacesummit.org/aboutframe.html

"...there have been well meaning and sometimes eloquent calls for
world government; calls which pointed to the unfairness, inequality
and injustice of the present distributions of wealth, power and
policy making.... If only we could work as one world, then we could
solve the world's problems together." Introduction to The Charter for
Global Democracy signed at the Millennium Summit.
http://www.charter99.org/charter.html

"We pledge to move expeditiously to endow the UN with resources --
both operational and financial -- commensurate to the tasks it faces
in its peacekeeping activities worldwide.... As Permanent Members of
the Security Council, we will continue to fulfill our obligations
under the Charter and commit to making UN organization stronger and
more effective." Presidents Clinton (USA), Putin (Russia), Zeming
(China) and Chirac (France) and Prime Minister Blair (UK), September
7, 2000. Statement by the P-5 on the Millennium Summit.
http://www.pub.whitehouse.gov/uri-res/I2R?urn:pdi://oma.eop.gov.us/2000/9/8/
2.text.1



The two UN summits fit together. As in Nazi Germany, political
success calls for cooperating churches and compromising spiritual
leaders. http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/#1 [1]

Both Summits agreed to build a more "efficient" United Nations. They
wanted a standing UN army and a "reformed" Security Council -- one
unencumbered by the "gridlock" of a veto. Canadian master-strategist
Maurice Strong, http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/#ms who led the
1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development, serves their joint
goal well.

Mr. Strong, who now heads the UN's University of Peace -- a vital
partner to the World Peace Summit -- is also in charge of UN
"reforms". His view of the needed reforms is no secret, for his
leadership on the strategic Commission on Global Governance exposed
some sobering plans. Its 1995 report, Our Global Neighborhood,
http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/#gn outlined the agenda:

"Governments are understandably reluctant to commit troops rapidly
for UN action, particularly in civil wars and internal conflicts....

"This underlines the need for a highly trained UN Volunteer Force
that is willing, if necessary, to take combat risks.... Such an
international Volunteer Force would be under the exclusive authority
of the Security Council...." (page 110)

What if the US Congress disagrees with UN decisions. Could it simply
press for a US veto on the Security Council? Not if Strong implements
his vision of reform. The United States, which is billed 25% of the
huge UN budget, would be dismissed from the Security Council:

"We recommend that a new class of 'standing ' members be
established.... Of these new members, two should be drawn from
industrial countries and three from among the larger developing
countries. Of the two from industrial countries, presumably one will
be from Asia and one from Europe. Of the three from developing
countries, we would expect one each to be drawn from Asia, Africa,
and Latin America....

"The new standing members will not possess a veto, and we believe the
aim should be for the power of the veto to be phased out." (240-241)

Many Americans refuse to believe this could happen. Others -- who
like my family in Norway, saw nations shift from freedom to Nazi
tyranny overnight during World War II -- know well that massive
social changes always have and will be part of history.

It's tempting to think that the United Nations would save us from
such devastations in the future. Instead, we need to realize that the
same human quest for power that drove Lenin and Hitler to unthinkable
ends, is now being centralized in a single government ruled by
ambitious, compromising national leaders -- some in virtual bondage
to the World Bank and IMF.

Granting such powers to the UN would mean that countless decisions
affecting our lives and families will be made for us by leaders who
are not accountable to voters and cannot be removed from office.

So don't be deceived by the noble sentiments. In spite of the grand
promises, local control and "decentralization" are outright lies!
Everyone -- throughout the world -- would have to live, think,
participate and work according UN rules and standards or face a
potential intrusion by the UN-controlled forces. And when that
happens, you would have no place to hide. (See Local Agenda 21
http://www.crossroad.to/text/articles/la21_198.html )

Part 1: The World Peace Summit
http://www.millenniumpeacesummit.org/aboutframe.html

Sheiks and swamis, priests and patriarchs, moguls and medicine
men.... From around the world, they had gathered in New York on
August 28 to join a four-day dialogue on "unity among religions."
This Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual leaders
would supposedly thrust humanity toward a utopian oneness and peace
on earth. But for those who doubt the noble rhetoric, this meeting of
minds raised some sobering questions:

What kind of unity did these religious leaders envision? What would
the UN require of its spiritual leaders?  What did they have in
common?  What kind of unity?

Not all spiritual leaders were welcome. The new global "democracy"
calls for worldwide representation -- but only by those who conform
to the UN vision of solidarity. Dissenting voices could cause
conflict and expose the lack of consensus. As Rabbi Arthur Schneier,
president of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, said,

"We have to marginalize religious leaders who are peace spoilers and
are inciting hatred
http://www.crossroad.to/text/articles/cwhbcv3-98.html and
nationalistic passions, which destroys life.... We have a lot of
those who are out there who are not in sync, and who are seeking to
undermine our peacemaking, bridge-building efforts.''
http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/#3 [2]

"Peace spoilers" include those who refuse to conform to the UN vision
of "Religion in a Culture of Peace." Biblical Christianity would fit
the label well, for the true followers of Christ cannot be "in sync"
with the world. They will not compromise their faith in order to
please the global village.

Since Ted Turner's Better World Fund paid most of the Summit
expenses, one would expect intolerance for God's truth. It's no
secret that the Summit's Honorary Chairman Turner has little love for
Christianity. In his Summit message, he described his spiritual
search:

"The thing that disturbed me is that my religious Christian sect was
very intolerant... because it taught we were the only ones going to
heaven. It just confused the devil out of me because I said heaven is
going to be a might empty place with nobody else there.

"Now I believe there may be one God who manifests himself in
different ways to different people ... And I can't believe God wants
us to blow ourselves to kingdom come. He wants us to love each other
and live in peace." http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/#33 [3]
http://www.mcjonline.com/news/00b/20000839a.htm Ted Turner Attacks
Christianity At U.N. "Peace Summit"
http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/#33

The Dalai Lama didn't fit either. China would tolerate no public
support for the exiled Tibetan Buddhist leader. Its leaders had
voiced their disapproval, and the UN chose to violate its own
principles rather than offend the Communist giant.

What does the UN require of its spiritual leaders?

The UN's readiness to bow to Chinese demands caused both concern and
consternation. "While religion should not dictate politics, neither
should politics dictate faith,'' said Mustafa Ceric, the Grand Mufti
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. "We have a very sorry experience from the
Communist period, as well as the most recent past, where politics has
manipulated religion.''

It makes sense that history would repeat itself. In spite of the
tempting lies about human and spiritual evolution, human nature
doesn't change from century to century. June Griffin, who attended
the Summit with support from Congress, described the hypocrisy of
those who proclaim lofty ideals but pursue self-interest, power and
prestige:

"Past agendas have failed, thus religion is to be reintroduced into
politics as the ultimate pressure. Over a thousand religious leaders
and spiritual heads of the poor nations came to the UN Religious
Peace Summit in their humblest limousines, SUV's and other means of
western accommodation, after having flown through the air on
Yankee-invented airplanes. One Hindu said he spent $20,000 to attend
and still he couldn't get a place to speak. Not all is well. ...

"The solemn ceremony was delayed 45 minutes because the emcee was
unable to clear the first three rows for the speakers. Either they
didn't understand his "please empty the first three rows so that we
can get on with this historic event," or used it as a good excuse to
retain the best seats. He pleaded patiently for 45 minutes, I said,
and in vain called an interpreter, but alas, none moved. "Please turn
off cell phones," but they rang on. Seems Mother Earth's children
don't mind very well." http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/#4 [4] A
personal report from a reporter who was present at the conference.

What did count was a public demonstration of "unity in diversity."
This "diversity" called for showy but shallow distinctions between
their various religions. Drums, feathers and other outward symbols
helped hide the genuine ideological differences which had yielded to
UN standards for the new global "unity." In other words, peace pipes
and distinguishing robes were welcome. Unlike the Biblical cross,
they didn't threaten the blueprint for solidarity.

What did they have in common?

At the close of the World Summit, the spiritual guides signed a
"Commitment to Global Peace."
http://www.millenniumpeacesummit.org/aboutframe.html Together they
would support the UN's quest for answers to "the pressing problems of
conflict, poverty and the environment." As in Nazi Germany, the
Soviet Union and Communist China, compliant religious leaders would
consent to a common UN-defined duty: to be used by political
strategists to persuade and manage the masses.

Ponder some of the suggestions in this Commitment to Global Peace. As
in most UN documents, it highlights the crisis needed to justify the
loss of freedom and the planned control. Notice how it commits
religious leaders (1) to accept its dubious presumptions, and (2) to
use their influence to serve the UN agenda for "sustainable
development" -- establishing a socialist welfare system and economic
equality around the world under the banner of "saving the
environment."

"Whereas our world is plagued by violence, war and destruction, which
are sometimes perpetrated in the name of religion....

"Whereas no individual, group or nation can any longer live as an
isolated microcosm in our interdependent world....

"Whereas there can be no real peace until all groups and communities
acknowledge the cultural and religious diversity of the human family
in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding....

"In light of the above, and with a view to discharging our duty to
the human family, we declare our commitment and determination:

1. To collaborate with the United Nations and all men and women of
goodwill locally, regionally and globally in the pursuit of peace.....

2. To lead humanity by word and deed in a renewed commitment to
ethical and spiritual values...

5. To awaken in all individuals and communities a sense of shared
responsibility for the well-being of the human family....

7. To educate our communities about the urgent need to care for the
earth's ecological systems....

The second point -- "no individual... can any longer live as an
isolated microcosm in our interdependent world" -- is already being
used in communities across the USA to justify pressuring people of
all ages to participate in the consensus process.
http://www.crossroad.to/text/articles/mc9-24-98.html The Columbine
massacre and the new quest to identify "loners" as potential
criminals have intensified this pressure.

Remember, the United Nations demands solidarity. Only a new set of
shared beliefs, values, attitudes, and behaviors can complete its
utopian vision of the global community. To succeed, it needs the
cooperation of spiritual leaders who will persuade their followers.

Absolute truth and political dissent are unacceptable. Uncompromising
positions could bring conflict and gridlock. Our Global Neighborhood
suggests a threefold approach to establishing " an ethical dimension
to global governance. " Do they sound familiar?

Encourage commitment to core values and strengthen the sense of
common responsibility for the global neighborhood.

Express these values through a global ethic of specific rights and
responsibilities.

Embody this ethic in the evolving system of international norms,
adapting, where necessary existing norms of sovereignty. (See Our
Global Neighborhood)   http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/#gn

This "sense of common responsibility" was as vital to totalitarianism
in Nazi Germany and the Communist block as it is to the United
Nations today. While the responsibilities (or duties) were adapted to
both real and artificial needs of the times, they served to focus the
masses on common quests.

Part 2: The UN Millennium Summit
http://www.un.org/millennium/

Like today's leading politicians, the Summit promised all kinds of
rewards to those who would bow to its reign. But its seductive
promises hide unthinkable threats to personal freedom and national
sovereignty. Their purpose is socialist control, not compassion. Hard
to believe? Then look at the roots of the United Nations.

Founded in 1945, the United Nations chose the communist spy Alger
Hiss
http://www.britannica.com/bcom/eb/article/4/0,5716,41464+1+40585,00.html
as its first, though temporary, Secretary-General.
http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/#5 [5] A Harvard law-school
graduate, he served as an advisor to Franklin D. Roosevelt at the end
of World War II. While secretly functioning as a Soviet agent, Hiss
worked with the forerunner to the National Council of Churches to
establish a world government that fit the Communist vision for
socialist control. (See Conforming the Church to the New Millennium)
http://www.crossroad.to/text/articles/ConformingChurch1-0 He didn't
stay long at the helm of the organization he had helped found. In
1946 he was elected president of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, and was replaced by Trygve Lie, a Norwegian
labor
leader.
http://www.britannica.com/bcom/eb/article/2/0,5716,49312+1+48173,00.html


Trygve Lie had earlier first been nominated to preside over the
General Assembly by Andrey A. Gromyko of the Soviet Union. As
Secretary-General in 1950, he urged that the UN admit the Communist
People's Republic of China. But he offended the Soviet Union by
supporting military intervention in the Korean War. From then on, he
faced its "official hindrance and personal insult." Meanwhile, as a
result of the McCarthy investigations against suspected Communists in
the UN, Lie's "secretariat was accused of giving jobs to disloyal
U.S. citizens." None of the charges were proven, but his authority
suffered and he resigned in 1952.
http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/#6 [6]

In the article, The Un-American United Nations,
http://www.newsmax.com/commentarchive.shtml?a=2000/9/6/092459 Steve
Farrell wrote:

"Of the 17 individuals identified by the US State Department as
having helped shape US policy leading to the creation of the United
Nations, all but one were later identified as secret members of the
Communist Party USA....

"... the ideological makeup of the UN¹s leadership has been constant.
In its 54 year history all eight Secretary Generals of the UN have
been either dedicated socialists or communists, all 15 of the UN
Under-Secretary-Generals for Political and Security Council Affairs
(the UN¹s military boss) have been communists (all but one from the
Soviet Union/Russian Federation), and two thirds of the membership in
the General Assembly, the Security Council, and in the World Court
have always been representatives of socialist and communist
nations....

"Besides the scandal of having American communists Alger Hiss and
company as the creators of the UN, a 1952 official Senate
investigation into the then 6 year old United Nations revealed,
'extensive evidence indicating that there is today in the UN among
the American employees there, the greatest concentration of
Communists that this committee has ever encountered.' And these were
high officials." http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/#7 [7]

Words that, to many, bring a sense of security such as peace, ethics,
compassion, rights, democracy, security, and sovereignty become
meaningless in this context. Like Gorbachev's "Council of the Wise,"
the minds behind the UN agenda are masters at deception. Having
rejected Biblical and moral absolutes, they are free to believe that
the end they envision justifies any unconscionable means.

Consider some of the main points in the "working draft"
http://www.sovereignty.net/p/gov/madeclaration.htm of the United
Nations Millennium Declaration "unanimously adopted"
http://srch1.un.org/plweb-cgi/fastweb?state_id=968860489&view=unsearch&numhi
tsfound=3&query=United%20Nations%20Millennium%20Declaration&&docid=1571&docd
b=pr2000&dbname=web&sorting=BYRELEVANCE&operator=adj&TemplateName=predoc.tmp
l&setCookie=1
by the delegates:

I. Values and Principles

1. We, the Heads of State and Government of the Member States of the
United Nations, have gathered... to reaffirm our faith in the
Organization and its Charter as indispensable foundations of a more
peaceful, prosperous and just world.

Fact: It cancels every Constitutional right we treasure in America.
The UN offers no balance of powers, no jury trial when accused.....
(See Trading U.S. Rights for UN Rules)
http://www.crossroad.to/text/articles/turfur12-98.html

2. We recognize that... we have a collective responsibility to uphold
the principles of equality and equity at the global level....

Fact: If your lifestyle fails to meet the UN's socialist standard for
equality and equity you will face the consequences.

3. We reaffirm our commitment to the purposes and principles of the
United Nations Charter, which have proved timeless and universal....

Fact: The UN Charter, as an international treaty, could cancel our
freedoms under the U.S. Constitution.

4. We believe that the central challenge we face today is to ensure
that globalization becomes a positive force for all the world's
people.... To be inclusive and equitable, globalization requires
broad and sustained effort to create a shared future, based upon our
common humanity in all its diversity....

Fact: This requires totalitarian training, management and monitoring
of human resources around the world. Today's teaching and
surveillance technology makes it possible to monitor compliance with
the UN's politically correct "mental health" (including community
participation and willingness to compromise) of each person and
community.

The UN claims the right to define the rules, manage the action, and
monitor compliance on each of the points below. The nice-sounding
terms help win public consensus, but they hide an agenda that opposes
the freedom we treasure in America.

For example, "Equality" would end your family's right to choose
traditional gender roles for your home. "Tolerance" carries the duty
to participate in the (dialectic)consensus process,
http://www.crossroad.to/text/articles/MentalHealth2-99.html put aside
contrary facts and absolutes, and join the unbiblical quest for
"common ground."

5. We consider certain fundamental values to be essential to
international relations in the 21st Century. These include:

Freedom: Men and women have the right to live their lives and raise
their children in dignity, free from hunger and from the fear of
violence, oppression or injustice. ...

Equality: No individual and no nation must be denied the opportunity
to benefit from development. The equal rights and opportunities of
women and men must be assured.

Solidarity: Global challenges must be managed multilaterally, and in
a way that shares the costs and burdens fairly in accordance with the
most basic principles of equity and social justice. ...

Tolerance: Human beings must respect each other, in all their
diversity.... Differences... should neither be feared nor repressed,
but cherished as a precious asset.... Dialogue among all
civilizations should be actively promoted.

Respect for nature: Prudence must be shown in the management of all
living species and natural resources, in accordance with the precepts
of sustainable development. ... The current unsustainable patterns of
production and consumption must be seriously addressed in the
interest of our future....

The next section is introduced in Article 6 as "the key objectives to
which we assign particular significance." It includes surrendering
legal rights such as a jury trial to the whims and inefficiencies of
a UN Criminal Court and to UN officials who often despise everything
America once valued.

II. Peace, Security and Disarmament

7. We will spare no effort to free our peoples from the scourge of war...

8. We resolve therefore:

To strengthen respect for the rule of law.... [i.e. the UN's
international laws]

To enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations in the maintenance
of peace and security, by giving it the resources and the tools
required to promote conflict prevention, the peaceful resolution of
disputes, post-conflict peace building and reconstruction, and by
strengthening the capacity of the Organization to conduct peace
keeping operations.

To take concerted action against the menaces of terrorism and drug
trafficking....

To take concerted action to prevent the illegal traffic in small arms
and light weapons, especially by creating greater transparency in
arms transfers....

To strive towards the elimination of weapons of mass destruction,
particularly nuclear weapons...

National sovereignty isn't mentioned here. However, the Security
Council Declaration
http://www.un.org/News/dh/latest/peace_security.htm signed on
September 7 "reaffirms its commitment to the principles of...
national sovereignty... and respect for human rights and the rule of
law." But, as in most UN treaties, there is a catch. (See Trading
U.S. Rights for UN Rules)
http://www.crossroad.to/text/articles/turfur12-98.html

If, in the eyes of the UN, a nation violates the rules and principles
of these treaties, they would face UN disciplines. If, under the
planned UN monitoring system, a person or nation fails to carry out
its UN-defined duties, it loses its rights. In this context, national
sovereignty becomes meaningless. The U.S. Constitution would no
longer guard the nation against UN legal or military interference.

For example, the Declaration "Affirms its determination to strengthen
United Nations peacekeeping operations by:

"taking steps to assist the United Nations to obtain trained and
properly equipped personnel for peacekeeping operations;"

"strengthening consultations with troop contributing countries when
deciding on such operations;"

President Clinton and other national representatives have promised to
provide the resources needed to establish a UN militia capable of
"rapid deployment" that could interfere in civil matters within
nations. In effect, they are handing the UN the very tools it needs
to destroy the freedom God once gave us.

In his Summit speech on September 6,
http://www.un.org/millennium/webcast/statements/usa.htm Bill Clinton
gave the kind of ambiguous message we have learned to expect from our
president. You may want to compare his Executive Order on The
Implementation of Human Rights treaties
http://www.crossroad.to/text/articles/turfur12-98.html with these
nice-sounding words. They take on a different meaning in the overall
context:

"We find today fewer wars between nations, but more wars within them.
Such international conflicts, often driven by ethnic and religious
differences, took five million lives into the last decade.... These
conflicts present us with a stark challenge. Are they part of the
scourge the UN was established to prevent? If so, we must respect
sovereignty.... but still find a way to protect people....

"We must provide those tools-- with peacekeepers that can be rapidly
deployed with the right training ad equipment, missions well defined
and well led, with the necessary civilian police."
http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/#8 [8]

This UN militia may well be necessary to quell the anger of the
masses when they awaken to the true UN agenda. The next section gives
another glimpse of the plan. It would establish a socialist welfare
system for the people of the world -- funded primarily by U.S.
taxpayers. Free enterprise, as we have known it, would no longer
exist:

III. Development and Poverty Eradication

9. We will spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children
from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty...
fully realizing the right to development and freedom from want.

10. We resolve, therefore, to create an enabling environment....

11. ... Internationally, success depends on the existence of an open,
equitable, rule-based, predictable and non-discriminatory
multilateral trading system, which guarantees special and
differential treatment of developing countries....

12. We ... call on the industrialized countries to: adopt... a policy
of duty-free and quota-free access for essentially all exports from
the least developed countries; to implement the enhanced program of
debt relief....

14. We resolve further: To halve, by the year 2015, the proportion of
the world's people (currently 22 per cent) whose income is less than
one dollar a day....

15. We also resolve:

To ensure that the benefits of new technologies, especially
information technology, are available to all. To develop strong
partnerships with the private sector and civil society organizations
in pursuit of development and poverty eradication. The Summit called
for ratification of several treaties:

IV. Protecting our Common Environment

16. We must spare no effort to free all of humanity... from the
threat of living on a planet irredeemably spoilt by human
activities....

17.We resolve, therefore, to adopt in all our environmental actions a
new ethic of conservation and stewardship and, as first steps agree:

To adopt and ratify the Kyoto Protocol, so that it can enter into
force no later than 2002- 10 years after the Rio Conference, and 20
years after the first United Nations Conference on the Human
Environment and to begin the required reduction of emissions of
greenhouse gasses, especially in developed countries. To press for
the full implementation of the Convention of Biological Diversity and
the Convention to Combat Desertification. To arrest the unsustainable
exploitation of water resources.... To ensure free access to the
information on the genetic code, since this belongs to all humanity.

treaties, click on these sites:

Environmental Perspectives, Inc. (EPI)
http://epi.freedom.org/

Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT) http://www.cfact.org/

V. Good Governance, Democracy and Human Rights

18. We will spare no effort to promote democracy and strengthen the
rule of law, as well as the respect for all internationally
recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right
to development.

19. We resolve, therefore:

To fully observe and uphold the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. To press for more inclusive and participatory political
processes in all of countries. To ensure the right of the media to
perform its essential role of informing the public, and the right of
the public to receive ideas and information provided by the media. At
the first glance, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights sounds
good, as do all the intrusive UN human rights treaties. Article 18
upholds "the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion..."
Article 19 affirms "the right to freedom of opinion and expression...
and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any
media and regardless of frontiers." (Trading U.S. Rights for UN
Rules) http://www.crossroad.to/text/articles/turfur12-98.html

But this basic end, Article 29 states that "these rights and freedoms
may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles
of the United Nations." In other words, these "rights" or "freedoms"
don't apply to those who would criticize the UN or its policies. Your
rights would be conditioned on your compliance. Only if your message
supports official ideology are you free to speak it. As Andrei
Vishinsky wrote in The Law of the Soviet State, "There can be no
place for freedom of speech, press, and so on for the foes of
socialism."

VI. Protecting the Vulnerable

20. We will spare no effort to ensure that women and children and all
civilian populations who suffer disproportionately the consequences
of natural disasters and armed conflicts, are given every assistance
and protection to regain normal life.

We resolve, therefore:

To combat violence against women in all its forms,

To encourage the ratification and full implementation of the
Convention of the Rights on the Child....

Few would disagree that we should "combat violence." But the word
violence, like countless others, has been redefined by the feminist
movement. At the 1995 UN Conference for Women in Beijing, it wasn't
limited to the dictionary definition: "the use of physical force so
as to damage or injure." http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/#_edn1 [9]
Diane Knippers, President of the Institute on Religion and Democracy,
gave some examples to show the new usage:

Economic violence included 'unequal distribution of wealth. . . as
evidence by world debt' and 'no wages for women's work.'

Political violence ranged from genuine examples of violence [such as
rape] . . . to 'women's exclusion in decision-making.'

Religious violence was 'intolerance and persecution of women who will
not conform' and 'exclusion of women from religious leadership.'
http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/#_edn2 [10]

Sexual violence [included] 'compulsory heterosexuality.'
http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/#_edn3 [11]

VIII. Strengthening the United Nations

23. We will spare no effort to make the United Nations a more
effective instrument for pursuing all of these priorities; the fight
against poverty, ignorance and disease; the fight against injustice;
the fight against violence, terror and crime; and the fight against
the degradation and destruction of our common home.

24. We resolve, therefore:

To restore the centrality and enhance the effectiveness of the
General Assembly as the chief deliberative and representative organ
of the United Nations. To call for the speedy reform and enlargement
of the Security Council, making it more representative, effective and
legitimate in the eyes of all the world's people. To further
strengthen the Economic and Social Council.... To give full
opportunities to civil society, parliamentarians, the private sector
and other non-state actors to contribute to the achievement of the
Organization's goals and programs.... 26. We solemnly reaffirm on
this historic occasion that the United Nations in the indispensable
common house of the entire human family, and through which it will be
able to realize its universal aspirations for peace, cooperation and
development. We will therefore pledge our unstinting support for the
attainment of these common objectives.

The last part would ensure that every nation bows to UN duties and
demands. It establishes the power of the world government to enforce
and punish those who refuse to conform. According to key UN reports,
http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/#gn the planned "reform and
enlargement of the Security Council, making it more representative,
effective and legitimate..." would end the Security Council veto. In
other words, the USA, a Permanent Member, would lose the authority to
block unwanted UN projects. On the vital issues of sovereignty and UN
control, the USA, as a minority member, would be forced to yield to a
majority of socialist and communist leaders.

Are you ready for this new world order? Are your children ready?
Whatever your answer, please pray for God's mercy on America, for a
change of heart in her leaders, for an awakening of its people and
churches, http://www.crossroad.to/text/articles/ConformingChurch1-0
for humble and watchful hearts in her children. Then equip your
family with His armor
http://www.crossroad.to/text/articles/armorofgod.html and Truths.
http://www.crossroad.to/text/spiritual%20ready/Scriptures.html Don't
forget, if you belong to Him, this promise is for you:

"Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or tremble at them,  for
the Lord our God is the One who goes with you.  He will not fail you
or forsake you." (Deut. 31:6)

Endnotes:

Maurice Strong.  This powerful Canadian multi-billionaire founded
both the World Economic Council and Planetary Citizens. He has served
as director of the World Future Society, trustee of the Rockefeller
Foundation and Aspen Institute, and is a member of the Club of Rome.
As head of the Earth Council, he began to prepare an Earth Charter
global code of conduct based on global values and radical
environmental guidelines.

Strong led the 1992 "Earth Summit" in Rio de Janeiro (United Nations
Conference on Environment and Development). It produced the
controversial Biodiversity Treaty and Agenda 21
http://www.crossroad.to/text/articles/la21_198.html ‹ the monstrous
plan for reorganizing the world along environmental guidelines. One
of his offices is only two blocks away from the White House.

Officially, Strong was "hired" by Annan to "reform" the massive,
inefficient, and corrupt UN bureaucracy so that the US Congress would
pay its dues. But his leadership brings little comfort to those who
remember Strong¹s occult and environmental ties, globalist ambitions,
and corrupt business practices.

global education system with psycho-social strategies for conforming
minds to the UN agenda. Started by Robert Muller,

former assistant Secretary General of the UN, the University of Peace
is now led by Maurice Strong.

"Power!" (November/December 1995); 10.

http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/#_ednref3 [11]Ibid. (Knippers, "Power!")

Our Global Neighborhood, the official report of The Commission Global
Governance (Oxford University Press, 1995), calls for (as does
http://www.crossroad.to/text/articles/RR8-99.html Towards A Rapid
Reaction Capability for the UN) a more effective UN police force and
an end to veto on Security Council.

But this more "efficient" world government would operate by a
consensus based on ethical solidarity -- everyone must conform to the
new global values and duties:

"The quality of global governance will be determined by several
factors. High among them is the broad acceptance of a global civic
ethic to guide action within the global neighborhood, and courageous
leadership infused with that ethic at all levels of society. Without
a global ethic, the fractions and tensions of living in the global
neighborhood will multiply.

"The most important change that people can make is to change their
way of looking at the world. We can change studies, jobs,
neighborhoods, even countries and still remain much as we always
were. But change our fundamental angle of vision and everything
changes our priorities, our values, our judgments, our pursuits.
Again and again, in the history of religion this total upheaval in
the imagination has marked the beginning of a new life, a turning of
the heat by which men see with new eyes and understand with new
minds and turn their energies to new ways of living.

"In our rapidly changing world, the standards and restrains provided
by commonly accepted values and norms become ever more essential.
Without them, it will be hard, if not impossible, to establish more
effective and legitimate forms of global governance." pages 46-47)

======================================================
THE MEDIA IS CONTROLLED - and THE INTERNET MUST ALSO BE
by Bob Ippolito
PropheZine Assistant Editor
from Issue #3 of The Watchman's Trumpet
======================================================

As a mature Christian examines the Bible and examines world events,
it becomes evident that we are in the last days. The relentless, yet
oh so stealthy push for a unified global government, as prophesied in
Scripture, has been underway for much longer than many of us would
care to believe. One of the primary characteristics of this age, as
set forth by the Lord Himself, is deceit, (Daniel 11:34, Matthew
24:4,11,24, etc.).

The Media has been, and continues to be, the primary weapon of deceit
and manipulation of the globalists. With the conglomeration that has
occurred in the mainstream press steadily over this century, can one
really wonder why every television channel (network and local)
reports the exact same news simultaneously? Then one picks up a
national paper to read again the exact same stories that day and the
local paper headlines are again, identical. Radio stations, the same!

The American people are being deceived and manipulated 1. By
censorship of the really important information, (dumbing down) 2. By
bombardment of the trivial (desensitizing us) 3. By continual and
repetitive exposure to selective issues often with slanted emphasis
or downright lies, (propagandism designed to shape our very thinking,
opinions and beliefs).

Why is the Multilateral Agreement of Investment (MAI), (which will
have greater scope and more drastic implications than NAFTA or GATT),
virtually impossible to find in the press while in its final stages
of negotiation, yet soap opera style trials, and stories of world
balloonists abound? (More information about MAI will be provided in
future issues, as God is willing.) Why does a boxer's bitten ear
receive local and nationwide coverage, but we are never told about
presidential Executive Orders that affect the entire nation?

By controlling press releases of economic strategies that shape
national trends, the power elite are able to not only tighten their
stranglehold on this nation's economic structure, but can extend that
control that quotes David Rockefeller, founder of the Trilateral
Commission in June of 1991, as he addressed a meeting of that
organization:

"We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time
Magazine," Rockefeller told them, "and other great publications whose
directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of
discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for
us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the
bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is now
more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government.
The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world
bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination [read
as "democracy"] practiced in past centuries." (This quote with
further references can also be found in the book "Censored 1996", by
Carl Jensen.) Now, however, there is a huge news leakage problem, and
it is called the Internet.

THE INTERNET TOO MUST BE CONTROLLED

A source from the FBI puts the entire issue in perspective, "there
must be some control imposed on the Internet, it is too dangerous in
its present unrestricted and unregulated state." In keeping with the
FBI concerns regarding the "dangerous" level of freedom of
information is a statement by Council on Foreign Relations member
Lawrence Eagleburger, "We have to be the world's THOUGHT policemen",
he said.

Now we see that the US is reaching out "internationally" to "combat
high-tech crime and
pornography in the Internet", (AP News 12/04/97). Has anyone stepped
into a local convenience store lately? Seen any Television? How about
billboards, magazines, movies, music? Let us therefore think and
examine what is behind this sudden concern on the part of Attorney
General Janet Reno to monitor and regulate the Internet, when
pornography is virtually protected everywhere else.

Pornography is not the real concern here. On the contrary, recent
history shows that our Government has been preoccupied with
protecting and supporting this 'Freedom of Speech". No, instead, this
is another attempt of Big Brother to Watch Over You by first
MONITORING, then LEGISLATING the usage of the Internet.

This is also why, the press was publishing all of the major concerns
"from top law enforcement officials from the world's industrial
nations" to develop and "agree on an international strategy for
combating the growing problem in computer crime" (USA Today,
12/10/97). At this same time, only 8 hours prior, news stories broke
of Internet Terrorists "demanding the release of an imprisoned
comrade and threatening to unleash a crippling computer virus" (also
USA Today, 12/09/97).

The Internet, by God's grace thus far, has become a medium by which
we can still proclaim the Truth about Christ, and expose the evil
deeds of this world. Here the Government must identify 'crises' or
create them so they can then convince the sheep of the need for more
Government regulation so that we will voluntarily surrender more of
our rights and privacy, without even realizing it - until it's too
late.

Let us pray, and use diligently the resources God has given us, while
we have them, to inform the Christian Body to 'watch and be prepared'.

Let us seek and serve Him as if there is no tomorrow (John 9:4, 12:35).

Ready for a Hebrew lesson?
by Barri Mallin

Step into any synagogue, reform temple or messianic congregation, and
you will most likely see a light burning. These are not the ceiling
lights, but a special light - it usually has its own visible place on
the bima or dais.

This is called the Ner Tamid, the eternal light, the eternal lamp. It
is always burning, never is it to go out. The word - Ner - is lamp in
Hebrew, and Tamid means eternal or continually. In I Kings 11:36 we
read:

"But to his son I will give one tribe, that My servant David may have
a lamp always before Me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen
for Myself to put My name."

God wanted David and his ancestors to rule forever. We read in Exodus 25:30
And you shall set the bread of the Presence on the table before Me at
all times.

And Numbers 4:7 says

"Over the table of the bread of the Presence they shall also spread a
cloth of blue and put on it the dishes and the spoons and the
sacrificial bowls and the jars for the libation, and the continual
bread shall be on it."

The bread of the Presence was always there.

In Leviticus 6:12-13 we read:

"And the fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it. It shall not
go out, but the priest shall burn wood on it every morning; and he
shall lay out the burnt offering on it, and offer up in smoke the fat
portions of the peace offerings on it. Fire shall be kept burning
continually on the altar; it is not to go out."

God was firm about the continual fire, because the fire originally
came from Heaven

Then fire came out from before the LORD and consumed the burnt
offering and the portions of fat on the altar; and when all the
people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces. Lev.9:24

The Fire which originally came from Heaven was to be visible by all
of Israel. Sometimes I think it would have been much easier to serve
the LORD back then, because of all of His VISIBLE signs - the pillar
of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night.

I know that God's word says that we walk by faith and not by sight,
and yet, I must confess to you, that sometimes I have "Chicken
Little" faith. You remember Chicken Little? He was the chicken who
when he felt one rain drop on his head, he ran back to the coop
yelling ' THE SKY IS FALLING!! THE SKY IS FALLING !

Wow, it is not too hard for me to emulate Chicken Little. One battle,
one challenge, and it seems as though my faith goes out the window.
Why can't I have that VISIBLE pillar of fire to guide me?

And then I stop.
And wait.
And read my Bible.
And wait.
And pray.
And wait.
And try to be about the Father's business. And wait. And pray.
And read my Bible.
And wait.

And then, when it seems as though eternity has passed, I realize that
I do have the eternal fire within, it is the Holy Spirit, the Ru-ach
Ha Ko-desh. The eternal fire has not gone out, it may just need the
fan of faith to stir up the flames somewhat. The furnace is still on.

The Holy Spirit gives us more than the Energizer Bunny can only dream
about ! The Holy Spirit helps us to be better than Timex - take a
lickin' but keep on tickin'.

Sometimes it seems like our light within is a 25 watt bulb, and
sometimes it seems like a floodlight. But the blessed thing is, is
that if you are born again, born from Above, then you have the Ner
Tamid, you have the Eternal Flame within you, what a gift!!!

Every good thing bestowed and every perfect gift is from above,
coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no
variation , or shifting shadow. James 1:17

"Seek the LORD and His strength;
Seek His face continually (tamid)." I Chron 16:11

Yeshua Jesus says

"You are the light of the world." Matt 5:16

SPIRITUAL AMNESIA
by Timothy Jon Barrett

Have you ever lost your thoughts,
just forgotten who you are?
A total lapse of memory,
your brain not up to par.

These strange and scary feelings,
that frequently will seize ya,
the inner person drifts away,
from a spiritual amnesia.

Those attacks come straight from Satan,
he makes you to forget,
a partial lapse at first,
then he steals it - bit by bit.

Cause a Christian needs his memory,
to remember who he is,
those thoughts that keep you going,
Satan wants them to be his.

The item that he wants the most,
is remembrance of salvation,
"Just rest a while", he tells you,
"give your soul a good vacation."

Then once you've packed your bags,
and journeyed out on this trip,
then Satan steals your purpose,
and tightens down his grip.

Then the farther on you go,
the distance you have traveled,
vacation time starts piling up,
and your memory has been unraveled.

Then in the midst of leisure,
the fun you've had so far,
you can't recall for the life of you,
your home, or who you are.

But the thought it lingers firmly,
that you've jumped the chosen track,
how did I get to where I am?
- and how do I get back?

First cancel your vacation,
pack your bags, start getting ready,
concentrate on Jesus Christ,
bring those thoughts back firm and steady.

Then keep your thoughts on Jesus,
where ever you may roam,
and don't forget your purpose,
if you travel far from home.

Cause Jesus loves the forgetful,
when repentance they do find,
so remember who you are my friend,
and keep Jesus on your mind.
