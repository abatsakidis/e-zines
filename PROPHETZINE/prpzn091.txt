==========================================================
Hi Everyone,

There is so much deception going on in the church today regarding what is of God and what is not that I thought an issue focusing on discernment and related topics might be timely. The following articles will not only give us a glimpse into how easy it is to be deceived but also show us a way out. As the Bible plainly explains, most sin is the result of Idol worship in one form or another. When we turn the focus on ourself or others then we are very easily led away from the most basic concept of Christianity--trusting in Christ and His Word. Without discernment we are like one of those complacent frogs sitting in a nice warm bath that is eternally getting hotter and hotter while the mind gets sleepier and sleepier until it finally dozes off, i.e., frog soup.

I hope you are blessed by this issue,

Lori Eldridge

WHAT IS DISCERNMENT?

Discernment of gifts is one of the most important functional gifts that those in the Body can be given. For it is how the Body gets the people God wants into the role He wants them in. 

Discernment isn't an afterthought tacked on at the end of whatever it is we do on the off chance that the Spirit was doing something. Discernment is a basic course of action. Church actions should be set up to discern the right direction before your event, to keep effective tabs on it during the event, and to debrief after the event, taking whatever disciplinary actions or clarifying lessons are needed. EXPECT that the Spirit will lead, if really asked and really given a chance to do so. 

Discernment of spirits is a gift given to the whole church, and within the context of the church, the gift may be given to individuals for leading the church in its discernment process. The gift shows itself in people who are given a 'spiritual eye' for cutting through facades and confusion, for getting to the heart of the matter. Someone who's gifted in discernment finds where the devil is at work in seemingly good things, and where the Spirit is working when things aren't working right. 

Some think of discernment as merely a skill, seeking those with the right skills. That sounds to me more like a corporate bureaucracy than a church, and we know how poorly those generally do the job. But we are God's people, where mere fishermen are history shakers, where stuttering fugitives become bold leaders for the people's freedom, where ordinary young men slay mighty warriors of great skill with a well-aimed stone from a slingshot. This is not skill, at least not until after they've exercised the gift for awhile. Discernment is a gift from God. 

That being said, discernment is not without means. There are processes and tools that God gave us to use in order to discern rightly; there are lessons God has taught us that help us find out what God is up to. Discernment is only rarely a zap from beyond; it is, as a rule, something that emerges. 

Spiritual discernment is a fallen thing; like everything else in this world we are part of, it is bound by our imperfections (1 Cor 13:9,12) and thus can be false or shallow or merely mistaken. But it helps greatly to have the right attitude toward it : 

1. Make sure you can be held accountable, on small things as well as large ones; 2. Allow others to hold you accountable (don't fight back nor blindly accept, but pay attention and be a servant about it); 3. Be ready to hold others accountable, if need be. 

It is important to discern the spirit of gifts: the devil makes imitations, and the human mind can create the appearance of a gift. (This is spoken of in 1 Cor 12:10; 1 Jn 4:1-3.) If a gift is being used to spotlight or further the earthly power of its wielder, it is to be distrusted as being of Satan. 

"Discernment" is sometimes used to throw bricks at other people, to defeat them in a struggle for power or influence, or just to pick at them until they quit or retreat. One has to discern whether what is done in the name of 'discernment' is done from love, or whether it just is a clanging gong or a noisy cymbal. Jesus didn't call us to love ideas, he called us to love people. When discerning, it's important to stay focused on why you are doing what you're doing. The Christian is called to ask him/herself, "By bringing this issue up, how am I pointing people to Christ? How am I helping them grow in the Spirit?" If there is no answer to those questions, or if you have to stretch far and wide to come up with a complicated or weak answer, then it's probably best not to speak. Indeed, it's probably time to focus on listening, because it's your time to learn. 

SCRIPTURE AND DISCERNMENT

When Peter wrote on the ending of his era, he was not in writing about a coming end of spectacular gifts, but of the end of the earthly lives of those who bore witness to the resurrected Christ. Their testimony had to remain when they were gone. The Gospels and Acts were all written with that very directly in mind. The Epistles were written as those apostle/witnesses did their apostolic duty. Their role was about to pass from the scene, but new roles would arise in their place, roles that are already mentioned in the Epistles. And with those new roles came new gifts. Paul, in 1 Cor 13:8, told us that the gifts will eventually end, because "when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away with" (v.10). Paul was not really speaking of the end of gifts, but of the end of all earthly matters -- gifts included -- keying on what will last, "faith, hope, and love" (v.13). 

For the Reformers, and for us today, we turn to Scripture to teach us what is the Spirit's. This is where we know the Spirit speaks, and because this is where the Spirit tells us the divine purposes; the Spirit will not work against it. It is in Scripture where the Spirit's priorities are shown, where the vision of the Kingdom is shared with us. We simply can't identify the Holy Spirit from the Deceiver without it. We will fail to distinguish our will and words from God's Purposes and Word. This is especially true of modern ideas and practices, but (as the Reformers insisted) is also true of those of the past, too, including our most cherished traditions. If the new or the old stands against Scripture or is used to thwart its central thrusts, we must stand with Scripture, or we will fall for anything. 

That said, this 'Scripture principle' is not intended to hold the Spirit in chains. It is to be read permissively, in the light of freedom in Christ, knowing that Scripture does not directly address most matters. One does not demand 'Scriptural warrant' for a practice, but for all of three things: 

1. that Scripture does not outrightly contradict it; 2. that what the practice or saying conveys is the Gospel, and that it is fully in keeping with the root and heart of Christian belief found in Scripture. 3. that it turns the focus onto Christ, not persons or organizations or manifestations or activities. 

If it meets those rules, then it needs no direct warrant from Scripture, tradition, or for that matter, even from common sense. The Spirit has every right to lead us into what looks like folly. The Holy Spirit is sovereign; discernment is just our checking to find out if it's the Holy Spirit and not someone else's folly. 

I'm not one of those who believes that every spiritual thing must have a Scriptural proposition to define it. However, when it comes to gifts and the discernment of gifts, we are indeed given some rules by Scripture. The 'proposition' regarding gifts is that they are there to be used to build up the Body and further the Gospel witness, whatever that means in a specific situation. They are also to be done in keeping with a sense of good order. 

There are some people who could read Scripture until it came out their noses, and still refuse to let the Spirit teach them anything. 

For the rest of us, though, the patient, prayerful, steady study of scripture brings many rewards. The most relevant reward for discernment is that the Spirit develops within us an understanding of why God acted in the past. From that, we develop a sense' of what God is doing now and what role we may have to play in it. It simply will not do to try to justify some unusual activity by using a biblical text that really doesn't match what is going on. It has to fit into the overall scheme. 

The Scripture principle is not a substitute for the Spirit, but rather is a recognition that this is how the Spirit works. It relies on the Spirit's communicating through the Scriptures when we read then in prayer and earnestness. If there is no action by the Spirit, the Bible's pages would lay lame, moving your life no more than a dictionary or encyclopedia. If the Spirit is working in us, the Bible is aflame with truth and vision for our own lives and all those of the world we live in. The Spirit wants us to study, trust, and shape our lives according to what is in Scripture, to steep it into our souls, to live by the contours and the world vision of the Scriptures. Noone can prove that Scripture is the authentic story of God's dealings with humanity. That has to be shown to each of us by the Holy Spirit; it becomes a matter of faith. 

Denial of the authority of the written Word in/for/by the church is denial also of the Christ who is the Word of God. One cannot just nakedly 'go by the fruit', because it is Scripture which tells us what fruit we are to look for, and in what contexts they are the work of God. 

Scripture shapes an authentic Spirit-led experience, and sets the bounds for our part within it. Scripture tells us many spiritual events, and we may find that the experience we went through may be in the same train as those events. Scripture tells us the most important course and purposes of what God is doing, and why. Scripture ranks first : if Scripture says our experience or what we are about to do is NOT of the Lord or according to God's will, it means NO. 

THE CHURCH'S ROLE IN DISCERNMENT

Discernment of gifts is one of the most important of the working gifts that those in the Body can be given. For it is how the Body gets the people God wants into the role He wants them in. 

We as Christians need to be aware that what we teach and discuss is inevitably our own understanding of Scripture. Other understandings, if drawn from Scripture and open to be judged by Scripture, are possible and even faithful. 

Herein lies the value of the testimony of 2000 years of churchgoing Christians (traditions) and the billion Christians of today (fellowship). Interpretation springs out of life; it is lived and experienced. Even more: it is lived and experienced through being a part of those who believe in Jesus and his good news, a body whose members are formed and shaped in this way as found in Scripture. It is a community which teaches each other, recalls its history, shares experiences, and affirms each other's value. It (hopefully) has the guts to say no and to get each other to amend our understandings and change our ways when they are going astray, and to show a more excellent way in all things. 

One of the keys to the believing community's role in discernment is that when one is being checked by the Body, one is being checked by others who have also done patient, prayerful, steady study of Scripture. The Spirit developed that sense of God's ways within them, too, in a slightly different way for each of them. If they didn't study that way, they won't have that sense, and thus are less trustworthy as part of a discernment process. (You'll never find out one way or the other unless you listen carefully to them, and have the guts to put away any defensive reactions you might have.) 

One drawback of the Body's role in discernment is that the Body is made up of people. (It's a benefit too, but here's one reason it is also a drawback.) People are fallen, flawed. They are not all-knowing, and have badly-damaged understandings. They can be fooled. People love to be sweet talked, to be showered with puffery and to get their egos stroked. They tend to push aside the bad news for the camp they're in. It's easy to become a yes-man. These facts must be kept in mind whenever talking about the church's role in discernment. But remember too that you also are a fallen person just like the rest of us, and you too can get taken in. Your role in discernment takes checking and re-checking and cross-checking. 

What bridges the biblical events and the Church putting them into living effect is neither the communicated Word nor the Church. It is the Holy Spirit's doing. 

When the Church was starting out, there was only one way she could learn the faith: on her feet. The Church had to learn while she was doing. The Spirit had to teach the Christians how to love at the same time as moving them to act on that love, teaching them mercy at the same time as inspiring them to live merciful lives. 

THE PASTOR

Most Evangelical, Baptist, and historic Black churches lean heavily on the pastor's authority to do the discerning. The pastor is the one who has the responsibility for leading the parish, and thus is responsible for seeing to it that the congregation stays on course with God. Churches of these traditions rarely suffer from a collapse into chaos. However, they may face an even more wicked situation. What happens when the one who is supposed to be applying the discernment is the one who needs to be held accountable? The result is often an authoritarian minister who wields enslaving power over the minds of parishioners. Something less sinister happens just as often : the parish and its pastor merely lose sight of Christ. Either way, it is bad news. The good news comes from the few congregations and humble ministers who have the guts to identify warps in doctrine or practice as they develop, strong pastor or not, and deal with them by working together to discern the Spirit. It can be done. It is far too rare. 

CHURCH TRADITIONS

Many church traditions have documents which state how they believe the Spirit works to help us discern. For instance, in my own Lutheran tradition, the Book of Concord : (references are to the Tappert edition) says : 

* The Spirit is given through the Word (39.3; 125.135; 313.11; 470.4; 471.13; 472.19; 520.4; 530.48; 535.72), * through proclamation of the gospel and sacrament (31.2; 82.9), * through Word and sacrament (262.70; 469.1; 534.65; 541.16), * through Baptism (105.35; 441.41).
* Where the Word is, the Spirit is at work (187.44; 312.3; 415.38; 418.58; 470.4; 520.5; 528.37-38; 531.55-57; 621.29; 629.77). * The Spirit does its work on earth through the church (168; 415.37; 419.61). 

The Book of Common Prayer 1979 (Episcopal/US Anglican) also addresses how to know when the Spirit is at work (Catechism, pp. 852-3): 

" Q. How do we recognize the presence of the Holy Spirit in our lives? 

  A. We recognize the presence of the Holy Spirit when we confess Jesus 

     Christ as Lord and are brought into love and harmony with God, with 

     ourselves, with our neighbors, and with all creation. 

  Q. How do we recognize the truths taught by the Holy Spirit?   

  A. We recognize truths to be taught by the Holy Spirit when they are in 

     accord with the Scriptures."

COUNTERFEIT GIFTS

It is no accident that Paul puts into the middle of his powerful excursus on gifts (1 Cor 12 and 14) his earth-shaking chapter on love (1 Cor 13). When they see what appear to be spiritual gifts, people are right to ask where the love is. For this is a mark of discernment: counterfeit gifts are marked by the lack of love in their use. Counterfeit gifts are also uncovered when someone or something in the place that Christ or the gospel should be. No matter how wondrous or spectacular the display is, and no matter how well it is couched in Christian terms, any miracle, wonder, or sign is counterfeit if the doer wants to develop a following. The fruit is to be found in life after the miracle, not in the moment of the miracle. 

Who makes counterfeit gifts? Mostly the human mind of the phony, through learning how to trick people or to draw them into dependent relationships. Sometimes there is power which comes from the Chief Deceiver himself, the Devil. Whatever the source, there's a lot of it going around. Where the counterfeits show up, they must be called for what they are. 

One situation that should arouse big questions is when the spiritual authority of one person 'sends' the Spirit into others, especially if chucked into them like a spear or shot into them like an arrow. Another variation is to do a countdown (like that of a rocket launch) to the arrival of the Spirit into the place, as if the Spirit follows some human's cue as to where or when to act. Things of the Holy Spirit are done to draw attention to Christ, not to an evangelist or preacher or movement, and are never done as a lampoon of God's gift-giving. 

WHEN IS GOD ON THE MOVE?

When God is on the move, it's characterized by: 

1. Christ-centered spirituality in every aspect of life 2. Rejection of all prejudice, class/ethnic/educational barriers, exclusiveness, and denominational warfare. When it follows the Spirit, the Body knowingly chooses to counter-model prejudices by living without regard to them. The Spirit does not build walls, it rips them down. 3. bringing attention and worship to Jesus Christ, and awareness of God's/Jesus'/Spirit's work. 4. an unusual level of passion and energy. 

The primary standards for evaluating the effects of spiritual gifts: 

1. they are governed by love (1 Cor 10:23, and chapter 13; Rm 12:9; Eph 4:15-16). Gifts without love are worthless (1 Cor 13:1-3); 
2. they center us onto Jesus the Christ and Lord (1 Cor 12:3) and His good news; 
3. they direct us to Scripture, not away from it; 
4. they build up the church (1 Cor 12:7; Eph 4:11-12), giving it power, wisdom, character, boldness, and unity (Eph 4:4-6).
5. they help to create in us as individuals a love of righteousness, a heightened sense of sin, and a turning away from known evil. 

Preaching on the Spirit creates an atmosphere in which it's seen as good to raise questions about the Spirit's leadings. A congregation would stop looking at someone who raised such questions as being somewhat, well, strange. Fewer folks would say "that's not how we do things around here", because they begin to see that if they are to be a church following Christ, then seeking the Spirit's leading is the way things are to be done. 

QUOTES

"I believe in the Spirit's guidance just as surely as I believe in God." 

------ Fredrik Wisloff, I Believe In the Holy Spirit. 

"God never gives us discernment in order that we may criticize, but that we may intercede." 

------ Oswald Chambers

"The mystery of Pentecost is that the gift of discernment is breathed into the world, enabling us to see the presence of the divine in the midst of the human -- not as an aside or an afterthought, but as the main event of our lives" 

------ Jay Rochelle, in Christian Century, May 22 1985, p. 535 

"It is impossible to frame a doctrine of the Holy Spirit by taking all the data indiscriminately and forcing them into the Procrustean bed of a formal system. We have to discriminate between what is true and what is false, ... between what is primary and what is secondary, between what is central and what is peripheral;... between testimonies concerning the Spirit which reflect different levels of apprehension, between those which belong to different stages of the divine economy, and between those which have relation to different moments in the dialectic of spirit." 

------ George Hendry, The Holy Spirit In Christian Theology, p.13 

"Conflating modern-day intuition, etc. with the real Spirit is like confusing a gentle breeze with a tornado. If the real Spirit were really working in the post-apostolic church, it would be just as ambiguous as a cyclone." 

------ Bill Brewer

"The majority of historic heresy is based on an interpretation of the written not the living word. The 'living word' -- which is the Word in action through the gifts of the Spirit -- is all application and totally subjected in interpretation to the body of Christian truth, not an elevation of subjective over objective truth." 

------Ron Zess

More of Jesus let me learn

        More of His holy will discern;

     Spirit of God, my teacher be

        Showing the things of Christ to me. 

------ More About Jesus, EE Hewitt, 1915) 

Some Questions to think about

(If these questions are being used in small group study: please talk about these with each other, and be honest with each other in doing so.) 

(1) Have you had the experience of thinking that you were being led by God to do something, and it turned out not to be so? (If you're doing these questions on your own, grab a pad and write down about it.) 

(2) What kind of matters have you sought God's guidance about? 

How has the result surprised you, if it did? 

(3) Have you ever used "God's will" as a cover for your own plans or ideas? Are you doing so now? (Please, when discussing this: don't start talking about when others have done so; that just breaks down into the blame game. Talk about <bold>yourself</bold>.) 

(4) Take a look at 1 Thessalonians 5:19-21. It says 'Don't quench the Spirit' and 'test all things'. 

* How do they fit together? * How might these be seen as working against each other? * Have you ever been involved in an activity or a church where one was used to render the other as void? <How? Why? Did you take any action? 

(5) For church-goers and cell members : how do the members of your church/cell use each other as a way of discernment? 

A challenge for any church leaders who are reading this : next time you hold an activity or event involving religious faith, make a 'debriefing' a part of it. (It will feel awkward the first time out.) Ask among yourselves the kinds of questions found under 'debriefing', after some reasonably long minutes of prayer together.

|The Hope Of Glory
|By: Ken Onweller
|

Every Christian will have those sins in his life which he just cannot seem to shake. Why? If Jesus has freed us from the bondage of sin why do we keep on sinning?

The purpose of this study was to answer three basic questions: Why Do We Sin? How Can We Stop Sinning? What Does It Take To Bear Fruit?

It Starts With Jesus

"On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you." (John 14:20)

"Jesus replied, 'If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.'" (John 14:23)

"To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory." (Col 1:27)

The true starting point is to have God inside you. Literally. This is what begins the process which I call "The Hope Of Glory". 

If you have not yet accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour, bow down and admit to him that you have messed up your life and that he can have it. As we progress through this study, we'll see that giving up our lives for the sake of Christ is very worth it in our everyday living.

Jesus Is THE Source

"My purpose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge." (Col 2:2)

By having Jesus Christ in you, you are given access to all of the hidden treasuers of wisdom and knowledge. But this wisdom and knowledge isn't necessarily related to physical things. Notice that the wisdom has to do with being "...encouraged in heart and united in love..."

To put it another way, having Jesus Christ in you is how you have access to what is needed to live the love-filled life! 

You Cannot Overcome Sin, Only Jesus Can

"I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!" (Gal 2:21) 

"To this end I labor, struggling with ALL HIS energy, which so powerfully works in me." (Col 1:29)

Paul certainly knew what it was to struggle against sin. And yet, notice the wording of Gal 2:21. If there was any way that your struggling could end your sin, then Jesus died for nothing. You just cannot do it on your own. It's that simple. At the same time it is probably the hardest thing to realize. It must be Jesus Christ doing the work according to Col 1:29. 

"I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me." (Gal 2:20) 

This is what it is really about. Your life ended when Jesus entered you. It is now Jesus's body, if you will, to use as he pleases. Yes, you still have control over what you do, think, and feel. But wouldn't it be better to let Jesus do it since he knows the right way to live and you do not?

"What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith; but Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained it. Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the "stumbling stone." As it is written: 'See I lay in Zion a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.'" (Rom 9:30-33)

This may seem kind of confusing, so let me simplify it. If anyone could be made perfect by working hard at it then Israel should have been the most righteous nation on earth. But this just wasn't the case, was it? The reason they fell so short of perfection was because they were trying to become righteous all on their own. 

Their failure will be your failure if you follow after them. We need to step aside and trust Jesus to perfect us. 

No matter how hard you try: you cannot make yourself any better. 

The New Life

"The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God." (Rom 6:10)

"In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus." (Rom 6:11)

What was so special about Jesus? Why was he so perfect? Yes, he was God in flesh, but there was more to it. He didn't live his life for himself, but dedicated his very existence towards the will of his and our Father.

As we walk after Jesus, our lives should be the same. We should set aside our own desires and dedicate our very existence to the Father.

"Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. Do not offer the parts of your body to sin, as instruments of wickedness..." (Rom 6:12-13a) 

Think about it, if you know that something will lead to sin, why participate? Would you willingly get into a car with a driver who is completely drunk? In the same way, then, don't give your life over to those things which will only ruin it. 

"...but rather offer yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer the parts of your body to him as instruments of righteousness." (Rom 6:13b) 

It becomes really simple: participate in those things which glorify God and lead you closer to Jesus Christ. Then, let him use your life as his instrument of righteousness. 

"Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as slaves, you are slaves to the one whom you obey--whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness?" (Rom 6:16)

If you keep pursuing a lifestyle that is enamored with sin, is it any wonder that you cannot break the pattern? Remember the analogy of getting in a car with a drunk driver? 

"I put this in human terms because you are weak in your natural selves. Just as you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer them in slavery to righteousness leading to holiness." (Rom 6:19) 

If you want to enjoy the transformed lives, you must radically change your lifestyle to be centered around Jesus Christ. This is what allows him to begin transforming you into a vessel of his righteousness leading to a love-filled life. 

Freedom From Sin = Slavery To God

"But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life." (Rom 6:22)

Something which seems so hard to believe is that God has freed us from sin. There really is no reason that we should fall victim to it. So, why is it that we do?

"Thanks be to God--through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin." (Rom 7:25)

It has to do with your mind. If you have your mind set on God, Jesus will literally transform you. But, if you take your mind off of him and set it on yourself or sinful pursuits you will fall victim again to the depravity of sin. But also remember the Jews. They thought they could do it by themselves. In trying to obey God by their own efforts, they became unwitting slaves to sin. It really has to be Jesus doing it all. You merely have to let him do it and keep yourself free from corruption. 

"...because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death." (Rom 8:2) 

"...in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit." (Rom 8:4)

In addition to letting Jesus do the work of transforming our hearts, we must also follow the leadings of the Spirit. And how wonderful the Spirit is. When I find myself slipping into selfishness, self-righteousness, or the depravity of sin, the Spirit is there saying, "Nope. That's not the way." 

"Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires." (Rom 8:5)

It bears repeating... If you have your mind set on what you want all the time rather than on what God wants, sin will result. As you learn to follow the Spirit's leading you will find your thoughts focussing on the things of God. Believe me, this is where you want to be.

Selfishness Leads To Sin

"The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace." (Rom 8:6)

"The sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so." (Rom 8:7)

So what's wrong with having it your way once in a while? Well, letting your mind become sinful causes you to rebel against God and to suffer all of the ill effects that sin brings. Is it not better, then, to enjoy the life and peace which comes from letting your mind be controlled by God? Yes, it is scarey to give up control, but the results are worth it.

Just imagine how your day would turn out if you began with this prayer, "God, I don't know a thing about living. Please take over and live my life for me today. Let me learn by your example. Jesus, here I am for you to use today."

"You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ." (Rom 8:9)

"In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express." (Rom 8:26) 

This is the key difference, brethren, between how we were before we were born again and how we are today. Before our conversion, we simply couldn't help it. Sin had us completely in its grips. This is no longer the case. Yes, we sometimes put the sin-leash back around our necks for a time, but the Spirit is always there telling us we can take it off anytime we like.

God won't force you into anything, but he will certainly help you. So, accept his help today and take that leash off (see 1 John 1:9). 

"Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit." (Gal 5:25)

"So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature." (Gal 5:16)

You want to know how to end all sin from your life once and for all? This makes it so clear: live by the Spirit. Set your mind on God, follow his instruction and leadings, and you will stop sinning.

"For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature. They are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want." (Gal 5:17)

When you give in to your selfish desires you will start sinning. This is not what you want, but it happens. The quickest way to turn it around is to let the Spirit start calling the shots. 

What are the results of a self-centered person? 

"The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy, drunkenness, orgies, and the like." (Gal 5:19-21a) 

Compare these with the results of someone walking by the Spirit: 

"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control." (Gal 5:22-23a)

You tell me, which is better? Obeying your selfish desires, or following the Spirit as he leads you ever closer to Jesus Christ? 

Adios, Selfish And Sinful Self

"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!" (2 Cor 5:17) 

"For none of us lives to himself alone and none of us dies to himself alone. If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living." (Rom 14:7-9)

"I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me." (Gal 2:20) 

Could it be any clearer? Your life as you knew it in the past is over. You belong to God. There is no more place for activities and desires that are contrary to what he has revealed in the Bible. You need to live a life of trusting in the Son of God who loved you and gave himself for you.

Avoid The Filth

"Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things." (Php 4:8)

"The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light." (Matt 6:22) 

"Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them." (Eph 5:11)

Do you think that listening to music glorifying sex and violence will help you get closer to God? Maybe listening to something that glorifies him would be better.

Would you rather watch a fierce action film with a lot of death? Or, would it be better to go for a quiet walk in a garden admiring the flowers and chirping of birds?

What you place before your eyes will have a great deal to do with how easily Jesus will be able to transform you. 

The Jesus Bath

"He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Saviour." (Titus 3:5b-6)

You are going to mess up and feel very dirty for it. And you should! Sin is nothing to be excited about. However, our rebirth and cleansing wasn't just a one time act. God is always ready to cleanse you when you admit you screwed up. 

The Jews have a festival called the Feast Of Unleavened Bread. Prior to this seven day festival they are to put all leavened products out of their homes. During the course of the week, something with leaven is always found. When it is, they were to throw it out of their homes immediately and go to God for cleansing.

This festival applies to our Christian life. We start out with all the leaven cleaned out--or so we think. But sooner or later, we'll find crumbs. Sometimes it is a loaf of bread. And sometimes it's an entire bakery! But the point is, you get rid of it immediately by confession and God will set you back on track. 

"But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere." (James 3:17) 

How do you get wisdom from heaven? You get it from the Bible. Notice that the first result of this is purification. Have you ever had a bible study that just had you feeling completely charged? Why was that?

"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless." (Eph 5:25-27)

It isn't you reading the bible which cleanses you, but JESUS USING THE BIBLE TO CLEANSE YOU. If you see bible time as just reading, you will never get anything out of it. However, if you get Jesus involved, what a difference it makes. As you read, talk to him in prayer. Ask him questions. Then listen to his answers as you continue reading.

"Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, and do not share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure." (1 Tim 5:22) 

"Everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as he is pure. Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness. But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is is no sin. No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him. Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. He who does what is right is righteous. He who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God's seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God." (1 John 3:3-9)

How do you become pure? We saw the answer to this already: Jesus purifies you as you read the word and get him involved. He also purifies you as you allow him to live his life in you. You need to avoid the filthiness of sin and the desire to give in to your selfish desires. If you do not, you will become enslaved to the devil again. Thankfully though, the Spirit will never allow you to be enslaved very long before he begins to turn up the heat on your conscience.

Jesus said he would never leave nor forsake one of his own. His investment is too high to do otherwise.

"Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you-- unless, of course, you fail the test? And I trust that you will discover that we have not failed the test. Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong. Not that people will see that we have stood the test but that you will do what is right even though we may seem to have failed." (2 Cor 13:5-7) 

Yes, even though to everyone watching we may look like big failures. And in my life how much it stings to be called a hypocrite by someone I was trying to share the gospel with. 

"For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth." (2 Cor 13:8)

But the way we know that we haven't truly failed is our love for the truth. It is the truth that sets us free. It is the truth that allows us to look into God's heart and see our names there. It is the truth that gives us access to Jesus Christ. It is the truth which guarantees our place in the Rapture. It is the truth that shows us love.

Love, Love, Love

"The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith." (1 Tim 1:5) 

As we are purified in our hearts, brethren, the Spirit will give us the greatest gift of them all: Love.

Summary

Thank all of you for taking the walk with me out of the trap of sin. To have the fruit of the Spirit (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control) requires that we let Jesus Christ live his life in us. 

We cannot do anything to make this happen. In fact, in so doing, we only make ourselves worse. It has to be all Jesus. 

There is one thing we can do, however. We can avoid the filth and temptation of sin. Find godly pursuits to replace the sinful ones. 

Devote yourself to reading your Bible as if you are talking with God. Listen to him. Follow every urging in your heart to do good that is in accordance with Scripture.

You won't do this perfectly at first and will find yourself entangled with sin from time to time. However, as you move on in your Christian walk you should find such entanglements decreasing as your love and joy in Jesus Christ increases. 

This is what the Christian walk is all about, brethren: Jesus turning us into duplicates of himself.

|  Pluralism: The Sin of the New Tolerance
|  by Zenith Merril
|

God Almighty, the God of the Bible, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, condemned modern "pluralism" and politically correct "tolerance," in the first of the Ten Commandments, which He gave to Moses: 

Exodus 20:3: "You shall have no other gods before me." 

How much more clearly can God speak?

Bible believing born again Christians should all love the practitioners of non-Christian religions, whether they be family, neighbors, or complete strangers, because all are beloved by God. It is the false religious practices He hates, and that we should hate, not those who are trapped within them. 

As the mentality of our present world society has become globalistic, because of our incredible communication technology, and the ease of world travel, man's philosophy and theology has become overwhelmingly pluralistic, and the belief in embracing diversity on all levels, especially religious, is increasingly applauded, although for Christians it contradicts Biblical authority. 

In pluralism, all religions are considered alternate paths to the same God, and as in the first century, when Christians who refused to accept Caesar and all other Roman Gods, equally with Christ, were in danger of being thown to the lions; those who do not adhere to this theological philosophy now, are branded as narrow minded, mean spirited, backwoods snake handlers, especially in the media. It was not the belief in Christ in Roman times that condemned His believers, but their worship of Him alone, and their unwillingness to worship all Gods. 

The World Christian Encyclopedia now informs us there are more than one and one half billion professing Christians in the world, one billion muslims, 650 million Hindus, 300 million buddhists, and 200 million Chinese folk-religion advocates. An ever increasing number of United States citizens have become followers of non-Christian religions. 

Islamic mosques and Buddhist and Hindu shrines and worship centers are now conveniently available to most of the country's population, located in most every metropolitan area and large university in the United States. 

As followers of Jesus Christ, we are commanded by Christ to share the gospel with all men, including those who adhere to non-Christian religions. Now, as in the Roman Empire, during the first centuries of Christianity, we are being asked to acknowledge that all religions are equal, that all are valid ways to worship God, and equally able to win God's approval. "Religious pluralism" is considered politically correct, and all of society is expected to affirm it as desirable and proper. 

For those Christians who regularly read God's word, the Bible, as all believers are instructed to do, it is impossible for us to knowingly commit idolatry by acknowledging the validity of false gods and false religious systems. These systems have been invented by the mind of fallen man, as inspired by Satan and his fallen angels, of whom God has said, in 2nd Corinthians 11:13 "For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their deeds." 

All Christians should respect and value the unique human worth of followers of other faiths, however; in spite of the teachings of the Bible, some are now unwilling to incur others displeasure by asserting that the Christian faith alone is pleasing to God, and capable of achieving salvation only for those who are in Christ Jesus. Rather, some Christians are now professing that belief in, and worship of Jesus is not the only means of salvation, and are said to be practicing "Christian inclusivism." 

Liberal (pseudo) Christians who espouse this opinion, believe that people of other religious convictions, because of their devout devotion to the belief they do follow, or even due to their efforts to follow the dictates of their own conscience, have their names included in the book of life. Although they have no knowledge of the gospel, or faith in Christ, and His atonement, and are unaware of being recipients of this incredible "free gift of God," they are thought to be included in the atonement Christ won by suffering and dying on the cross. 

The third opinion presently held is: "Christian exclusivism." This is the traditional belief of all Christians who base the authority for their religious faith and spiritual practise on the Bible. This orthodox belief is in only one saving truth, the gospel of Jesus Christ. This is the natural conclusion of those familiar with Jesus' well known declaration: "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except by me" (John 14:6). 

By studying the birthplace and originator of Non-Christian Religions, we may arrive at "naturalistic" explanations of the origin of all religions. Those who are committed to an existential, or naturalistic world view that precludes a supernatural God, or supernatural sphere of reality, believe that man, through his own imagination has somehow brought all of these beliefs and practises of worship into being. 

Anthropologists believe religion to be an outward display of man's desire to appease and manipulate the rampaging forces of nature, which he cannot control, and/or of his dread of encroaching old age, and death. 

This can in no way, however; explain the overwhelming universal evidence of mankind's need to worship and acclaim a higher all powerful spiritual "God." We have been created by God, to communicate with, and worship Him. Without this fellowship, we are completely unfulfilled, and "ever seeking to arrive at the truth." 

To understand the origin of non-Christian religion, we have to revisit the Garden of Eden, where man fell away from his close fellowship with God, because of his gullability in listening to the serpent, and because of his disobedience to God; and from there, proceed to the Tower of Babel, where again man turned his back on God's instructions, and fell into apostasy by developing his own religious system, without God. 

There is, most assuredly some truth in non-Christian religion, which we attribute to God, as He is the source of all truth. The first chapter of Romans clearly tells us that the truth about God was originally known, universally, to mankind. This "original revelation" moved, eventually, to all the world, with the survivors of the Tower of Babel, after God confused their language, and scattered them. Bits and pieces of it have been found in all the pagan religions established since that time, wherever mankind exists. 

Within all religions, there can be found some elements of truth, implanted within the culture from which the particular religion developed, through exposure to God's chosen people, Israel, whose very existence is proof of the existence of God, and the validity of His promises. During the last 2,000 years, contact with Christians, as well as contact with and knowledge of the Holy Scriptures have imparted bits of God's truth to those who could, or would absorb it. It is believed, that at an early age, Mohammed had contact with both Jews and Christians, influencing him in his later development of Islam. 

Second is truth which has been exchanged for a lie, or stretched into a half truth, the result of man's sinful nature in repressing the truth about God. Romans 1 states that man's nature is to suppress the truth about God which has been made evident to all men, and to substitute for it what Paul calls "futile speculations," as in the development of Greek Philosophy, which began with a mytholization of the creation story of Genesis into a form of "evolution," expressly denying the truth of the God of the Bible, and His Holy Word. 

Third, Satan, assisted by his hierarchy of demons, is always watching man for an opportunity to inspire "idolatrous" religious apostasy in doctrine and practice. In Psalm 106:36-37 God informs us that all who serve idols are offering sacrifices to demons. St. Paul repeats this alligation in lst Corinthians 10:20. In 1st Timothy, also, he attributes false religious teachings to "deceitful spirits." In 2nd Corinthians, he stated that Satan "disguises himself as an angel of light," and that his assistants are therefore disguised as "servants of righteousness." 

Satan not only promotes that which is evil, but takes delight in any deceitful method he can devise of taking people's gaze off Christ and onto a worthless substitute, behind which, it is Satan himself who is receiving worship, rather than God. Satan is delighted to suggest a system promoting great religious morality, or a religion of self works, which leave people smugly saturated with self satisfaction in their own self righteousness, and self morality, thereby removing their recognition of their own sinfulness, and their fallen state before God. This results in the loss of their eternal soul, as they are no longer able to perceive their need for the propitiation before God, which Jesus achieved for them through His shed blood on the cross of calvary. 


God Has Given Us One Way Only To Approach Him 

Non-Christian religions, do not share the Christian belief that God has provided only one path to Himself, as He states in His Holy Word. Most all other religions believe in "religious pluralism." Religious pluralism means simply that the differences among the religions are minor and of no importance, and that the similarities between all religions greatly out weigh any differences, giving all equal access to the throne room of Almighty God. For a Christian to affirm religious pluralism is to call Jesus Christ a liar, and to deny the claims of the New Testament that Jesus Christ is the uniquely begotten Son of God, come in the flesh to be the Savior of the world, to all who will believe and accept. One cannot believe in religious pluralism and also claim the Bible to be their authority in religious practice. Religious pluralism glosses over the marked differences between the teachings and doctrines of the worlds' religions. This is obvious in the radically opposing views between Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity, in their concepts of God, the universe and its' origin, the meaning of life, the afterlife and method of achieving "salvation," if it is even considered relevant or necessary. 

In Buddhism, it is believed that humanity is suffering because he experiences worldly and/or fleshly desire. Because the objects of men's desires are impermanent, and perishable and inevitably lead to frustration and grief, it is taught that the path to achieve peace of mind and ultimate "salvation" is by eliminating all desire, including the desire to live at all. This is experienced in altered states of consciousness, or trance states during meditation, sometimes for hours, during which man "experiences" his oneness with the universe, and in fact, his goal is to go beyond this to a complete sense of nothing at all, thereby losing his very sense of personhood, or individual being. 

Hinduism teaches that the problem humanity must overcome is being trapped in this illusory material world, over the course of many lifetimes, through reincarnation, due to our lack of realization of our true identity as divine beings. The solution to this quandary of mankind is through the personal understanding and belief in our true divine nature, consequently realizing that we have no need of a savior. This too can be accomplished by looking "within" through meditation, and making contact with "our higher self," which is in reality a demonic being of great deception. 

In Islam, man's goal is to live by the law of God, as revealed through His prophets, especially Muhammed, God's final prophet, or the "seal" of the prophets. The hope is that all good deeds will outweigh the bad, at the end of a man's life, when God weighs them. The Muslum's only sure hope of heaven is by dying in a "Jihad" or Holy War, as God's warrior. The Qu'ran teaches that in this case, he will be taken straight to a sensuous heaven, where he will be allotted seven virgins to serve him. 

In Christianity, the problem is our rebellion against the will of God. The solution is not through altered states of consciousness, rejection of reality, or living an impossibly regimented life of works, with no assurance of achieving heaven, or eternal life with the Creator. Through personal faith in and acceptance of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for our sins, as completed on Calvary, through God's eternal plan for the redemption and reconciliation of sinful man to himself, we are assured of being sealed by the holy spirit, completely without self effort, but only through God' grace. The good works which should naturaly follow in a Christian's life are the result of his/her salvation, and does nothing to achieve it. 

Though there are limited and superficial similarities among the religions of the world, there are overwhelmingly crucial differences! 

Most pluralists refuse to become concerned about differences in belief, or doctrine, emphasizing that in spite of these differences, a common "religious experience" (brought about by demonic delusion), plus moral and ethical works and effort, can yet unite all mankind into "one" and demonstrate to us that all ways to God are equal. It is obvious to a Christian that only God can know the heart, as He tells us in 2nd Samuel, that indeed, man looks only at the exterior, but He Himself examines the heart of every man. 

Because of the uniqueness of Christ, and the failure of every other religion to acknowledge Him as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, which He is, it is impossible for a bible beliving born again Christian to find any validity in "Religious Pluralism" or the claim that the differences among the world's religions do not matter. 

The difference is a matter of life or death for eternity, of a final destination of either heaven or hell, and that is too important to brush aside without the most serious search of God's word, which will assure us of God's one plan for mankind, through Jesus Christ, as "Faith comes from hearing," and "Hearing from the word of God."

| Discernment
| By Ray Stedman
|

1 Cor 2:15 (KJV) But he that is spiritual judgeth all things . . 

Mat 7:1 (KJV) "Judge not, that ye be not judged. . ." 

F.F. Bruce: "Judgement is an ambiguous word, in Greek as in English: it may mean sitting in judgement on people (or even condemning them), or it may mean exercising a proper discrimination. In the former sense judgement is depreciated; in the latter sense it is recommended." 

NIV Study Notes: The Christian is not to judge hypocritically or self-righteously, as can be seen from the context. [But] Scripture repeatedly exhorts believers to evaluate carefully and choose between good and bad people and things. The Christian is to "test everything": 

1 Thes 5:21 (Phi) "By all means use your judgement, and hold on to whatever is good."

A.W. Tozer: "Among the gifts of the Spirit scarcely one is of greater practical usefulness than the gift of discernment. This gift should be highly valued and frankly sought as being almost indispensable in these critical times. This gift will enable us to distinguish the chaff from the wheat and to divide the manifestations of the flesh from the operations of the Spirit."

For clarity, let's use the word Discern for the judgement that God encourages, and Criticize for inappropriate judgements. By context, try to identify whether the word judgement, when used in Scripture, means Discernment or Criticism.

SPIRITUAL MALPRACTICE

Luke 12:57 (NIV) "Why don't you judge for yourselves what is right?" 

Hos 4:6 (NIV) My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. 

It is important that we judge things properly, or discern. If a person with appendicitis is diagnosed as having an ulcer, it may seem a mere matter of terminology, but if judged improperly, treatment could lead to death! If a baby has a fever, you wouldn't put it in the freezer to cool it down. Treating the symptom may make the problem worse! Discernment by outward appearances, out of ignorance, confusing cause & effect, symptom with problem, can be devastating - even with the best of intents.

2 Cor 10:7 (NIV) "You are looking only at the surface of things." 

WHY ARE OUR PRAYERS AND MINISTRY SO INEFFECTIVE? 

Consider our lack of discernment: Of the causes mentioned in Scripture of God, the world, the flesh, the devil; each Christian sect seems to focus on one and ignore the others. Diseases are assumed to be demons and "rebuked" without discernment or effect. Demons are assumed to be sickness, and "treatment" is attempted. God's discipline is attributed to Satan, and made light of. The obvious promptings of the Flesh are assumed to be the Spirit, or even of the Soul. The Soul is confused with the Flesh and Spirit. A mere matter of terminology, right? With such faulty diagnosis, we attempt "ministry", to no effect, and often to great harm. Is this ministry? Is this us? 

John 7:24 (Phi) "You must not judge by the appearance of things but by the reality!"

John 7:24 (NIV) "Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgement."

COUNTERPRODUCTIVE MINISTRY

If a medical doctor were to make such outlandish mistakes, we would put a stop to his "practice". But the modern church carries on in this "anti-ministry", leaving behind a wake of damaged souls. It is a very bad symptom when we don't care if our prayers and ministry are effective; it shows that the object of our "spirituality" is self-glory and not love. We don't dare look to see for fear of realizing how badly we are doing. Ignorance is bliss. Clearly, we need to learn to judge properly before we act. We need discernment. 

Prov 19:2 (NIV) It is not good to have zeal without knowledge, nor to be hasty and miss the way.

1 Cor 4:5 (Phi) "The moral of this is that we should make no hasty or premature judgements."

If we were willing to ask, willing to wait, willing to listen, we might gain discernment, so that we could "know", and not have to waver. We might achieve real faith. We would see past the surface, into reality. Our prayers and ministry would be effective. We could know God's will and see it done.

Jam 1:5 (NIV) If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given unto him.

JESUS ON DISCERNMENT

Luke 11:9 (NIV) "So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you." 

Mat 16:3 (KJV) " . . 'It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering.' O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?" 

Isaiah 11:2-3 (NIV) The Spirit of the Lord will rest upon him - the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of power, the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord - and he will delight in the fear of the Lord. He will not judge by what he sees with his eyes, or decide by what he hears with his ears; 

John 8:15-16,26 (NIV) "You judge by human standards; I pass judgement on no one. But if I do judge, my decisions are right, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father who sent me. . I have much to say in judgement of you. But he who sent me is reliable, and what I have heard from him I tell the world."

John 12:48 (NEB) "There is a judge for the man who rejects me and does not accept my words; the word that I spoke will be his judge on the last day."

Heb 4:12 (NIV) The word of God is living and active. . . it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.

OUR DESTINY

Mat 19:28 (NIV) Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his throne in heavenly glory, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." 

Luke 22:30 (NIV) "so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." 

DISCERNMENT IN THE CHURCH

Are we to "judge" teachings, situations, and even people in the church? Many Christians are fearful of making judgements, and unclear if this is the mission and duty of the church. After all: "Judge not . ."! (We will consider hypocritical judgement, or criticism, in a moment.) This fear of using proper judgement may come from a simple lack of understanding of God's will, or from superstition (Col 2:18-19), or even from a lack of the Holy Spirit (Jude 17-19). Scripture is useful for correcting such conditions (2 Tim 3:16-17). 

1 Cor 5:12-6:6 (Phi) Those outside the church it is not my business to judge. But surely it is your business to judge those who are inside the church - God alone can judge those who are outside. . . When any of you has a grievance against another, aren't you ashamed to bring the matter to be settled before a pagan court instead of before the church? Don't you know that Christians will some day judge the world? And if you are to judge the world do you consider yourselves incapable of settling such infinitely smaller matters? Don't you know that we shall judge the very angels themselves - how much more then matters of this world only! In any case, if you find you have to judge matters of this world, why choose as judges those who count for nothing in the church? I say this deliberately to rouse your sense of shame. Are you really unable to find among your number one man with enough sense to decide a dispute between one and another among you, or must one brother resort to the law against another; and that before those who have no faith in Christ!

1 Cor 5:3,12 (NIV) Even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit. And I have already passed judgement on the one who did this, just as if I were present. . What business of mine is it to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? God will judge those outside. "Expel the wicked man from among you." 

1 Cor 6:2-3 (NIV) Do you not know that God's people will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases? Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life!

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OLD TESTAMENT PROPHETS AND NEW 

1 Cor 14:24-25 (NIV) But if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand comes in while everybody is prophesying, he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and he will be judged by all, and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare. He will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, "God is really among you!" 

In Israel, Prophets were rare and held to a high standard. You were 100% correct, or "stoned". For the church, the Holy Spirit distributes the gifts to many, and we must learn and grow into the proper use of the gifts, prophecy included. We have quantity, but not necessarily quality. Thus, the burden is on the listener to discern, or judge the prophets. Simon Peter makes a good example of the inconsistency of the church prophets. (For an after Pentecost situation, see Paul "judging" Simon Peter in Gal 2:11)

THE CASE OF SIMON PETER

Mat 17:16-17 (NIV) 22-23 (Phi) Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my father in heaven. . ." . . Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This shall never happen to you!" Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Out of my sight, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men."

Amazing how the same mouth that spoke a "word of revelation" was "in the flesh" just a few moments later. The gift is great, but the "in the flesh" part can be a real problem for others. Jesus, who had discernment, openly "judged" Simon Peter, moments after praising him. For most of us, we will not have to openly judge, but simply decide for ourselves whether or not the "prophetic" message is from above or from below.

THE CASE OF SIMON THE SORCERER

Acts 8:9-10 (NIV) Now for some time a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great, and all the people, both high and low, gave him their attention and exclaimed, "This man is the divine power known as the Great Power." They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic.

Acts 8:19-23 (Phi) "Give me [Simon the Sorcerer] this power too, so that if I were to put my hands on anyone he would receive the Holy Spirit." But Peter said to him, "To hell with you and your money! How dare you think you could buy the gift of God for money! . . . your heart is not honest before God. . . repent of this wickedness of yours and pray earnestly to the Lord that if possible the evil intention of your heart will be forgiven. For I can see inside you, and I see a man bitter with jealousy and bound with his own sin!" 

HOW TO DISCERN REAL PROPHECY FROM WHAT "SIMON SAYS" 

Mat 7:15-16,22-23 (NIV) "Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. By their fruit you will recognize them. . . Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'" 

A.W. Tozer: "The healthy soul, like the healthy blood system, has it's proper proportion of white and red blood cells. The red corpuscles are like faith: they carry the life giving oxygen to every part of the body. The white cells are like discernment: they pounce upon dead and toxic matter and carry it out to the drain. In the healthy heart there must be provision for keeping dead and poisonous matter out of the life stream."

1 John 4:1 (TEB) My dear friends: do not believe all who claim to have the Spirit, but test them to find out if the spirit they have comes from God. For many false prophets have gone out everywhere. 

1 Cor 14:29 (NEB) Of the prophets, two or three may speak, while the rest exercise their judgment upon what is said. 

1 Cor 14:29 (TEB) Two or three who are given God's message should speak, while the others judge what they say. 

Acts 17:11 (NIV) Now the Bereans were more noble than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true. 

CRITICISM IN THE CHURCH

Mat 7:1-2 (Phi) "Don't criticize people, and you will not be criticized. For you will be judged by the way you criticize others, and the measure you give will be the measure you receive." 

Mat 7:3-5 (Jer) "Why do you observe the splinter in you brother's eye and never notice the plank in your own? How dare you say to your brother, 'Let me take the splinter out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own? Hypocrite! Take the plank out of your own eye first, and then you will see clearly enough to take the splinter out of your brother's eye."

This is not inconsistent with other Scriptures that instruct us to "judge" and help others be delivered from sin. The message here is to make sure you have been delivered first! Then, and only then, will you be effective at ministering to others. "Splinter removal", after all, is an important work of the church.

Mat 7:5 (NIV) ". . first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye." 

Sin can be debilitating and painful, like a splinter in the eye. But removing a splinter from your own eye may be impossible. Often, we need each other for this type of healing. For removal, the "healer's" hands must be clean, the environment must be full of light, the approach must be sensitive and reassuring. This should never be attempted by the self-righteous, in an environment of darkness, or with dirty hands.

"JUDGES" WITH DIRTY HANDS

James 4:8,11-12 (Phi) . . You are sinners: get your hands clean again. Your loyalty is divided: get your hearts made true once more. . . Never pull each other to pieces, my brothers. If you criticize your brother and judge your brother you have become a critic and judge of the Law. Yet if you start to criticize the Law instead of obeying it you are setting yourself up as a judge. There is only one Judge, the One who gave the Law, to whom belongs absolute power of life and death. How can you then be your neighbor's judge? 

Rom 2:1-3 (Phi) Now if you feel inclined to set yourself up as a judge of those who sin, let me assure you, whoever you are, that you are in no position to do so. For at whatever point you condemn others you automatically condemn yourself, since you, the judge, commit the same sins. God's judgement, we know, is utterly impartial in its action against such evil-doers. What makes you think that you, who so readily judge the sins of others, can consider yourselves beyond the judgement of God?

DON'T JUDGE ANYONE BUT YOURSELF IN DISPUTABLE MATTERS 

1 Cor 11:31 (NIV) But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgement.

Rom 14:1,3,5,10-13 (NIV) Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgement on disputable matters. . Who are you to judge someone else's servant? . . Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind. . You, then, why do you judge your brother? Or why do you look down on your brother? For we will all stand before God's judgement seat. . . So then, everyone will give an account of himself to God. Therefore, let us stop passing judgement on one another. . 

Col 2:16-17 (NIV) Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a new moon celebration, or a Sabbath day. These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ. 

1 Cor 4:5 (Jer) There must be no passing of premature judgement. Leave that until the Lord comes: He will light up everything that is hidden in the dark and reveal the secret intentions of men's hearts. . . 

1 Cor 4:6 (NIV) . . "Do not go beyond what is written." . . 

PERSONAL JUDGEMENT: DISCERNMENT OR CRITICISM? 

1 Sam 16:7 (NIV) ". . Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart."

Suppose you think that your have "Discerned" something. A good test of whether this "realization" is from above or from below is: what do you feel. Does your "Discernment" lead you to help, heal, love, share? Does it lead towards purity of the Body, towards Christ? Then the Holy Spirit may have given you a taste of His perspective: the truth, with love. Your actions will prove the validity of what you think, and deeper fellowship and/or humility will be the result. 

But if what you feel in your heart as a result of the "Discernment" is superiority, scandal, bitterness, or a desire to detach yourself from the Body of Christ, then it is not of God. Whether it is correct, or not, is not the issue: The "knowledge" comes from below, not above - as judged by its fruit. God looks at the heart. If what you "know" about others isn't useful to them or you, forget what you "know". It's poison.

THE GIFT OF DISCERNMENT

Philip 1:9-10 (NIV) And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be able to discern what is best and be pure and blameless until the day of Christ.

Philip 1:9 (TEB) This is my prayer for you: I pray that your love will keep on growing more and more, together with true knowledge and perfect judgement . .

1 Kings 3:9 NIV) So give your servant a discerning heart to govern your people and to distinguish between right and wrong. . . 

1 Cor 12:10 (KJV) . . to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, .

1 Cor 12:10 (Phi) . . to another the ability to discriminate in spiritual matters, .

Heb 5:14 (NIV) But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil. 

Prov 15:14 (NIV) The discerning heart seeks knowledge . . . 

1 Cor 4:6 (Jer) . . (remember the maxim: "Keep to what is written") . .

John 7:24 (NEB) "Do not judge superficially, but be just in your judgements."

GOD'S THOUGHTS

1 Cor 2:10 (NIV) . . but God has revealed it to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. 

1 Cor 2:14-16 (NIV) The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned. The spiritual man makes judgements about all things, but he himself is not subject to any man's judgement. . . . we have the mind of Christ.

1 Cor 10:15 (NIV) I speak to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.
