GREETING FROM LORI ELDRIDGE
====================================================== 

Greetings Everyone,

This issue I thought maybe we should get back to some of the basics of the Christian walk, such as: what exactly does preaching the Gospel entail; why we get off track with the Lord and what we can do to about it; a study of the three foundational doctrines of Christianity, and a defense of the PreTrib rapture, plus a devotional on the Gospel and a post Rapture poem--something for everyone :o)

We hope this issue speaks to a place in your heart.

Our "cry' for Assistant Editors was answered by 10+ people and I thank the Lord for that.  We also received 30-40 articles which we will be reviewing in the coming weeks.  Thanks again!

We have been going through a site redesign.  We are working feverishly, changing the format of every (thousands and thousands) page on the site. We hope to have this finished in the next few weeks.  The new format may be viewed by going to the Book Store (http://www.prophezine.com/bookstore/ ).

We will soon be adding a Shopping Mall to PropheZine.  There are hundreds of stores to choose from.  Although not a Christian shopping mall per se, the owners have only invited stores that do not have pornography and other immoral items.  We will send a notice when the Mall is open.  It is in Beta test right now.

In the near future we will also be offering Long Distance service at 5.5 cents per minute with no monthly fees 24/7.   We will be offering these services to increase the donations to this ministry.  I'm also considering incorporating and becoming a non-profit so your donations will be tax deductible.  Basically, it is becoming difficult to maintain this ministry with 3 financial partners providing 50% and Bob Lally providing the other 50% of the monthly costs.  PropheZine carries no debt but I recently had to cut back one of the items that was costing PZ $20 per month.  I would like to purchase 2 laptops and begin webcasting conferences through PropheZine.  It would be an incredible way to grow the PZ ministry.  But, these items cost thousands and since we go month to month......

 Hey, It's Dark In Here!
 by Ken Onweller
====================================================== 


As believers we would like to think that we are always walking in the light but sometimes we find ourselves suddenly overcome with darkness. How did we get there and how do we get out? 

What IS Darkness?

"The wise man's eyes [are] in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness..." (Ecc 2:14) 

In this passage, Solomon is observing that each person has it in him to realize that he is walking in darkness and to get out of it. It is the fool who ignores the darkness and keeps on going. 

So what, exactly, is the darkness that we are supposed to identify? Let's start with what it is NOT. 

"This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not have the truth: But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin." (1 John 1:5-7) 

We see here that darkness is DEFINITELY NOT from God. So where does it come from? 

"To open their eyes, [and] to turn [them] from darkness to light, and [from] the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me." (Acts 26:18) 

Now you begin to see the key issue. To be in darkness is to be under Satan's control. A slave to do his bidding, if you will. This is why the gospel message is so important, brethren: it shows people how to be freed from Satan's dominance by turning to the freedom in Jesus Christ! 

Why We Love Dark Places

"And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God" (John 3:19-21). 

So why doesn't everyone shake free the bondage of Satan and turn to Jesus? Sadly, they enjoy their sin too much and don't want to leave it. 

We would think that this applies to only the unsaved, but it is also true of the believer. Sometimes we can get caught up in our own particular sins that we just don't want to abandon. Every time we are near someone who is shining with Jesus, it sickens us and repulses us. It certainly shouldn't, but this is the natural and scriptural result of walking in darkness. 

If you are finding yourself in this position, it might be a good time to humble yourself and openly seek that sin and to repent of it! 

"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us [our] sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:8-9). 

This passage has always perplexed me. It is obvious that we continue sinning after being saved. So why would someone say they don't sin? 

In doing this study it dawned on me. There are Christians who don't believe it is possible to walk in the darkness. They think that they are saved and that their walk doesn't really matter. This has to be what this passage is talking about! 

As a believer, you WILL stumble into darkness. Do not underestimate yourself. If you say that you are incapable of such a fall you are deceiving yourself. I mean, this is why so many of us have really cruddy walks, isn't it? We are miserable because we cannot serve both our sin and Jesus Christ. Jesus wants you to admit your sin and turn the other way but you don't want to. Your flesh wants you to keep sinning but your conscience condemns you. 

Vs. 9 above shows you that the only way out of this self- imposed misery is to admit that you are wrong. When you do, Jesus INSTANTLY cleanses you. It's really that simple. 

So, how is it that we can cause ourselves to stumble into the darkness of 1 John 1:8? 

"The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when [thine eye] is evil, thy body also [is] full of darkness. Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness. If thy whole body therefore [be] full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light" (Luke 11:34-36). 

"But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great [is] that darkness!" (Matt 6:23) . 

These two passages might be a mouthful, but the message they are saying is that if you allow sinful things into your life you are going to become ensnared by them. Why not replace those things which cause you to stumble with those things which cause you to grow in the grace and the knowledge of your Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ? 

Another Source Of Darkness: Hatred

"Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth. He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him. But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes" (1 John 2:8-11). 

In this passage we see that allowing ourselves to hate anyone will cause us to walk in the darkness. As long as we allow this hate to remain so our walk with Christ will become very painful and quite miserable. 

Getting Rid Of The Darkness

"The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light" (Rom 13:12). 

"And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove [them]" (Eph 5:11). 

"Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?" (2 Cor 6:14) 

When we come to realize just what it is that has been our stumbling block, we must get rid of it immediately. As Christians, our light should be revealing the sin around us (Eph 5:11) so that, if possible, we could shame someone into repentance. No, I don't mean that you should start preaching at sinners, but that by your actions you condemn their deeds as wrong. When there is no difference between you and someone heading for hell, something is VERY wrong. 

Jesus Is THE Light

"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising" (Isa 60:1-3). 

Satan's control of this planet is described in this way, "darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people." This is quite vivid, isn't it? But what happens when you turn on a light in a dark room? The darkness INSTANTLY flees. 

"Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated [us] into the kingdom of his dear Son..." (Col 1:13). 

So it is that when Jesus is welcomed into your heart that the darkness must flee. It is when you try and turn down the dimmer switch on your relationship with Jesus that the darkness comes back. 

If It's Dark, You Need The Light!

"To give light to them that sit in darkness and [in] the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace." (Luke 1:79) 

"Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: [he is] gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous" (Ps. 112:4). 

But this thing do remember: once you realize that you are in darkness and admit it, God will lovingly turn the brights way up in your heart. 

Only Jesus Christ can fulfill your life with light. If you have never experienced this light and want to turn from darkness, ask him in. He'll gladly come into your heart. If you are saved but have been miserable in trying to live in both worlds, admit your hypocrisy. 

Walking in darkness for a Christian is truly the most miserable experience both for him and those around him. The only solution is to return to the Light.

 SOUND DOCTRINE: FOUNDATION OF BIBLICAL CHRISTIANITY 
 by Alan Yusko
====================================================== 


This tract looks at three major, foundational doctrines of Biblical Christianity. Why is this important? Well we are living in the days when sound doctrine is not important to people. Many are forsaking sound teaching and Biblical doctrine. Unity is encouraged at the expense of doctrine. In fact some spiritually and doctrinally appraised people think it is unloving to stand up for sound Biblical doctrine! At all sides there are many that deny the Bible, deny the Trinity, deny salvation by faith alone, deny that the Lord Jesus is the only way to be saved, deny the doctrine of hell, deny the virgin birth of the Lord Jesus Christ, and deny many other fundamental doctrines in Scriptures. 

What does the Bible say about sound Biblical doctrine in the last days? Will people be lovers of the truth? Will people seek out and embrace sound teaching? Here is what God says: 

2 Timothy 4

2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. 3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; 4 And they shall turn away [their] ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. 

Notice verse 3 above. People will not endure sound doctrine but instead will be more interested in fables that tickle the ears. What doctrines am I talking about. This tract will cover three doctrines: the Lord Jesus is the only way to be saved, the Trinity, and salvation by faith apart from works. These doctrines have such importance that if a person or group denies any of them then they are preaching a soul-damning heresy. Lets begin by looking at three Biblical doctrines: 

1) The first foundational doctrine is the fact that the Lord Jesus is the ONLY way to heaven! There is no other way for a person to be saved and go to heaven outside faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. If a person trusts in anything other than the Lord Jesus Christ he will perish and spend eternity separated from God in hell. This means that Mohammed cannot save, Buddha cannot save, church cannot save, Mary/priests/popes cannot save, or any other so called Saviour or 'religious system'. Salvation is ONLY through the Lord Jesus Christ. Below are a couple of verses that state very clearly that the Lord Jesus is the Only way to be saved. 

John 14

6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. 

Acts 4

12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. 

2) The second foundational doctrine is the Trinity. Although the word 'Trinity' is not found in the Bible the doctrine and concept certainly is. The doctrine of the Trinity states that within the ONE God there exists three Divine Persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. These three Divine Persons are the ONE God. The following example shows the Trinity in the Resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

(A) The Father raised the Lord Jesus

"Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities" (Acts 3:26). "And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come" (1 Thess 1:10). 

(B) The Lord Jesus raised Himself

"Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up....But he spake of the temple of his body" (John 2:19,21). 

(C) The Holy Spirit raised the Lord Jesus 

"But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you" (Romans 8:11). 

The previous verses show that the Father raised the Lord Jesus, the Lord Jesus raised Himself, and the Holy Spirit raised the Lord Jesus. The Trinity is shown in the resurrection. 

This final verse shows that it was God Almighty who raised the Lord Jesus: "Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead" (Acts 17:31). 

3) The third foundational Biblical doctrine we will look at is salvation by faith apart from works. What role does works have in Biblical salvation? Does a person have to earn or merit salvation by performing good works? Or does the Bible state that salvation was completed by the work of the Lord Jesus on the Cross and there is nothing a lost sinner can do to add to or subtract from His finished sacrifice? 

Ephesians 2

8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. 10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. 

Lets have a look at the above verses. Notice verses 8 & 9 clearly state that salvation is not of ourselves... salvation is NOT by works. This means a lost sinner cannot earn or merit salvation. As a result (verse 9) no one can boast that they 'earned' salvation by doing good works. Rather salvation is received by faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ. Verse 8 also states that salvation is a 'gift' of God. Here is a question? If a person has to work to earn a 'gift' then is the 'gift' really a gift? Would the word 'wage' be a better word than 'gift'? You see a gift is freely received apart from works. On the other hand a wage is earned by performing some kind of work. Since verse 9 clearly states that salvation is NOT by works and verse 8 states that salvation is a 'gift' then we can easily see that salvation is a gift that is to be freely received. In fact salvation cannot be earned or merited in any way. 

All this leads to another question. If good works do not save then what role do works play in the saved persons life? Look above at verse 10. Notice that AFTER salvation God has a job (good works) for that person to do. The good works do not save but are a natural offspring of saving faith. In fact if a person does not have good works AFTER salvation then questions can be raised about the salvation of that person. Was that person really saved in the first place??? Good works clearly do not save but good works ALWAYS follow true saving faith. It is as natural as an apple tree producing apples. 

CONCLUSION

In this tract we have covered three basic doctrines that cults, false teachers, and deceivers seek to pervert to the end result of leading many to a Christless eternity. I would encourage people to stand up for the truth in these closing days of human history before the return of the Lord Jesus Christ. Deception and false teaching will abound. Watch and be warned of any teacher or group that denies any one of the three doctrines presented in this tract. They are false teachers and deceivers who are presenting another gospel than that which is found in the Bible. 

Galatians 1

6. I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. 8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. 9 As we said before, so say I now again, If any [man] preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.

 Fraud and Deceit in the Presentation of the Gospel, Part I 
 By Bernie Koerselman
====================================================== 


Fraud is defined as an intentional misrepresentation (or one made with reckless disregard for the truth) intended to cause a person to act to his injury in reliance upon the misrepresentation. As an attorney I am, by training, aware of the definition. 

What is the primary "fraud" in the presentation of the Gospel? You may be astonished at how fundamental it is. It has to do with the person of Jesus Christ. The present emphasis in the Christian church seems to be on Jesus Christ as our Savior. The invitations from the pulpit are usually, "Accept Jesus as your Savior and you will have eternal life!" Sometimes there is a variation that states, "If you believe Jesus died on the cross for your sins you will have eternal life." Are those statements biblically true? 

Nowhere in Scripture does it say or suggest that believing in or accepting or receiving Jesus as Savior can save us. On the other hand, it is clear from Scripture that Jesus must be our Savior if we are to have eternal life. The first announcement of his birth stated, "a Savior has been born to you" (Luke 2:11). Somehow the Christian culture has apparently, carelessly assumed that because Jesus must be our Savior then we need only accept him as Savior. 

Likewise, nowhere does Scripture say or suggest that we can have eternal life by believing in something Jesus did. Virtually all the scriptures that deal with salvation exhort us to believe in him - the person of Jesus (e.g., John 2:11, 3:15,16,18, 6:40, 7:39, 8:30, Romans 4:24, 1 Peter 1:8). 

If we're not to believe in, accept, or receive Jesus as Savior (or believe in something he did) in order for Jesus to be our Savior and to gain eternal life, then what are we to do? 

What did Jesus say? Jesus told his disciples, "You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am" (John 13:13). Jesus said, "I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am the one I claim to be, you will indeed die in your sins" (John 8:24). He described his authority as Lord when he said, "All power and authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth" (Matthew 28:18). 

Scripture states we are to believe in, accept, and receive Jesus as our LORD! Perhaps the most familiar salvation scripture is Romans 10:9, "If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved." Likewise, Paul told the Philippian jailer, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved-you and your household" (Acts 16:31). That was the message of the early church - the church that persevered through intense persecution! They received Jesus as Lord (Colossians 2:6). Paul exclaimed, "We do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord!" (2 Cor. 4:5). An especially convincing scripture to me is Paul's summary of his ministry to the Ephesians: "I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus" (Acts 20:21). He taught the same to the Thessalonians, "God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Thess. 5:9) and to the Romans, "The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Romans 6:23 - see also Romans 5:21). 

Peter confirmed Paul's teaching. At Pentecost he preached, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved" (Acts 2:21). He concluded his sermon, "God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ" (Acts 2:36). Later he taught, "In your hearts set apart Christ as Lord" (1 Peter 3:15). 

What does it mean for Jesus to be our Lord? He must be our master, our King, our sovereign, the one who has total authority over our lives. I explained it to my grandson as, "He must be your boss." 

If we listen to what is preached in many of our churches we would surely declare that the primary message of Scripture is that Jesus is our Savior. But is that the primary message of Scripture? Not at all. In the New Testament, Jesus is called Savior only fifteen times. Nine times God the Father is referred to as Savior. Jesus is referred to as Lord 618 times, forty times more often than as Savior. 

Is the distinction between Savior and Lord important? Is it important that we believe in Jesus as our Lord? The issue is of eternal consequence, whether or not we have eternal life. The proof is found in an unusual scripture. Again it was Paul teaching: 

"For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living" (Romans 14:9). 

How can that be? Doesn't Scripture teach that Jesus died and rose again to atone for our sins, to redeem us, so that we may be justified before God, so that we will be reconciled to God and presented holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation? Of course it does. Can Romans 14:9 be reconciled with those redemptive purposes for which Jesus died and rose again? Yes, by recognizing that all those redemptive purposes are valid only for those for whom Jesus is Lord! The reason Jesus died and rose again was so he might be Lord of all, knowing that he would be Savior only of those for whom he is Lord. 

Christianity is often referred to as a relationship, not a religion. The distinction in relationships is important as we note the differences that would arise from receiving Jesus as Savior versus receiving him as Lord. If he could be only our Savior, then the relationship would be between Savior and the one saved. When Jesus is our Lord, the relationship becomes Lord and servant. 

Which relationship does the New Testament teach? Overwhelmingly we are taught that the believer is a servant, or even a slave, of the Lord Jesus. Scripture teaches: "You are not your own; you were bought at a price" (1 Cor. 6:19). Isn't that the condition of a slave, not free but owned by a master? 

The New American Standard Version of the Bible correctly defines our relationship to the Lord Jesus as his bond-servant. The bond-servant is a special category of servant. It is described at Exodus 21:5-6: "But if the servant declares, 'I love my master and my wife and children and do not want to go free,' then his master must take him before the judges. He shall take him to the door or the doorpost and pierce his ear with an awl. Then he will be his servant for life." This was the case of the person who had sold himself into slavery but found his condition as a slave was far to be preferred to his prior circumstances. He chose to stay with his master as his bond-servant. The master often honored him with a gold earring as a symbol of his special status as a bond-servant. 

The conditions of a bondservant are:

(1) It is voluntary
(2) confessed publicly
(3) out of love for his master
(4) slavery - giving up everything, and
(5) for life.

Those are the same requirements for those who would follow Jesus and receive him as their Lord. 

The New Testament writers declared themselves to be bond-servants: Paul (Romans 1:1), James (James 1:1), Peter, (2 Peter 1:1), Jude (Jude 1:1) and John (Rev. 1:1). All true believers are declared to be bond-servants: "The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show to His bond-servants, the things which must shortly take place; and He sent and communicated it by His angel to His bond-servant John, . . ." (Revelation 1:1, NAS). 

Just as the relationship is dramatically different when Jesus is our Lord, so is our response to Jesus as our Lord. If Jesus could be only our Savior, our response would likely be gratitude for saving us from God's wrath. When Jesus is our Lord and we are his bond-servants, our primary response to him is obedience out of love. 

Scripture confirms that obedience is our proper response to our Lord Jesus. The writer to the Hebrews related salvation to obedience: "He (Jesus) became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him" (Hebrews 5:9). Jesus expected obedience from his followers. He asked those who claimed to follow him as Lord but did not obey, "Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?" (Luke 6:46). Jesus said there could be no salvation without obedience: "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven" (Matthew 7:21). 

Obedience is important as the natural response of our relationship as servant to Jesus as our Lord. It is also evidence that Jesus is truly our Lord. It should be no surprise then that Jesus made obedience a part of his last instructions to his church. First he declared his Lordship: "All power and authority in heaven and on earth has been given unto me" (Matthew 28:18). Then he told his followers what he expected them to do in his absence. "Go into all the world and make disciples of all nations" (Matthew 28:19). He told them two things they were to do with these disciples: "Baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teach them to obey all that I have commanded you" (Matthew 28:19-20). 

If I were in a court of law prosecuting the church for fraud in its presentation of the Gospel, I believe many churches would stand convicted. Does your church, and do you, present Jesus Christ as Lord? Does your church, and do you, make it clear that there is no salvation unless Jesus is Lord? Does your church, and do you, teach that obedience is the necessary evidence (to God) that Jesus is Lord? Finally, does your church, and do you, obey his final command to teach new disciples to obey everything Jesus commanded? 

Those who present salvation as accepting Jesus as Savior almost invariably also fail to teach the importance of obedience. That double error leads to still another salvation-denying problem concerning the Holy Spirit. 

It is correctly stated that all true believers are indwelled by the Holy Spirit. Scripture teaches it is essential to have the Holy Spirit if we are to have salvation: "And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ" (Romans 8:9). 

We know we must belong to Christ to be saved because Jesus said, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6). 

Many church leaders apparently believe that the Holy Spirit automatically indwells those who "accept Jesus as Savior." But is that what Scripture says? 

Jesus told us how and under what conditions the Holy Spirit is given: "If you love me, you will obey what I command. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever - the Spirit of truth" (John 14:15-17). The conditions are that we must (1) commit to obey Jesus (2) out of love. Then he will ask the Father who will give us the Holy Spirit. Scripture corroborates that teaching as Peter defended the disciples before the Sanhedrin. Speaking of the Holy Spirit he said, ". . . the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him" (Acts 5:32). 

Jesus explained the relationship resulting from obedience to his commands: 

"Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love him and show myself to him" (John 14:21). 

And again he said, "If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. He who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me" (John 14:22-23). 

Note that it is those who love Jesus and obey his commands that are loved by God the Father and Jesus and they will come and make their home with them (through the Holy Spirit). 

If we are not taught we must believe in and receive Jesus as Lord then we are likely not taught that we are to obey him. If we do not commit to obey him, we will not receive the Holy Spirit. The initial misrepresentation of the Gospel has led to three different reasons why such people will be denied salvation. 

Consider Jesus' chilling warning: "Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'" (Matthew 7:22-23). Who are these people that Jesus never knew? They had not received him as Lord, nor did they obey him, nor had they received the Holy Spirit. But didn't they prophesy in his name, drive out demons and perform many miracles in his name? Yes, indeed. That is part of the great deception that even now is in the church. Didn't Jesus warn, "For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect-if that were possible"? (Matthew 24:24). They will deceive by doing these things in Jesus' name. 

A church that has been deceived by a fraudulent representation of the Gospel, that lacks teaching on the need to obey, and that is not empowered by the Holy Spirit would be simply part of a Christian culture. It would lack power and discernment. It would be lukewarm; its members would hardly be distinguishable from the rest of the world; and it likely would begin to compromise fundamental beliefs. Ultimately it might question the infallibility of Scripture, then the deity of Jesus, the truth of the resurrection, and perhaps openly allow sin in the church and pulpit by accepting homosexuals and ordaining homosexual pastors. Such churches might also chase after various claimed manifestations of the Spirit but lack the discernment to know whether such manifestations are of the Holy Spirit. 

How closely does that describe some of our churches today? I fear many of our churches are part of a changing Christian culture rather than firmly anchored on the unchanging, immovable rock - the Lord Jesus and his word. 

In a court of law, fraud is actionable. Contracts can be voided when fraud is used to induce a person to enter into the contract. In our churches we make representations to induce people to make decisions that will immeasurably alter their lives forever. These decisions have far-reaching ramifications. Those who believe and accept our representations will change their lives and their life-styles. They will give their money to the church and serve in the church in various capacities, taking time, sometimes sacrificially, from their other activities. 

If we induce them to make that decision based on fraud - by presenting false information - we can do immeasurable harm. Not only may such persons not have a saving faith - and therefore not have salvation - but also they may become disillusioned and never thereafter be willing to make a saving commitment to Jesus. 

Years ago I began to suspect that one of the evidences of fraud in the presentation of the gospel is the high percentage of people who quickly desert the church after having "made a commitment." 

Ray Comfort's Bride of Heaven, Pride of Hell confirmed my suspicions. Ray quotes statistics of a major denomination in the United States that disclosed it obtained an incredible 294,784 decisions for Christ in 1990. Yet, in 1991, it could only find 14,337 in a Christian fellowship. There were 280,447 decisions that couldn't be accounted for. The leadership had no clue as to why this happened, but could only conclude, "Something is wrong!" The trend continued. In August 1996 a leading U.S. denomination revealed that during 1995 it secured 384,057 decisions, but retained only 22,983 in fellowship. It couldn't account for 361,074 supposed conversions. Ray told of another crusade at which 600 decisions were obtained, no doubt with much rejoicing. But 90 days later, follow-up workers couldn't find even one person who was going on in his or her faith. In 1991 in Cleveland, Ohio, 400 decisions were obtained in an Inner City Outreach, but, again, later not one person could be found who continued in the faith. 

Ray quotes Charles E. Hackett, the Division of Home Missions National Director for the Assemblies of God in the U.S.: "A soul at the altar does not generate much excitement in some circles because we realize approximately 95 out of every 100 will not become integrated into the church. In fact, most of them will not return for a second visit." 

This phenomenon is not unique to the U.S. According to Ray, a pastor in Boulder, Colorado sent a team to Russia in 1991 and secured 2,500 decisions. The next year they found only 30 persevering in their faith. In Leeds, England, a visiting U.S. speaker acquired 400 decisions for a local church. However, six weeks later only two were going on, and they eventually fell away. A pastor who traveled to India every year since 1980 told Ray he saw 80,000 decision cards stacked in a hut in the city of Rajamundry, the "results" of past evangelistic crusades. But he maintained that one would be fortunate to find even 80 Christians in the entire city. That is 1/10 of 1%. 

Ray also cited statistics of the Barna Research Institute that indicated 62% of Americans say they have a meaningful relationship with Jesus Christ. However, a Gallup Poll, taken around the same time, revealed something interesting about a special group of 6-10% of Americans who say they are Christians. Mr. Gallup said of them: 

"These people are a breed apart . . . they are more tolerant of people of diverse backgrounds. They are involved in charitable activities. They are involved in practical Christianity. They are absolutely committed to prayer." 

Neil Anderson in The Bondage Breaker, page 107, states a similar statistic, saying, "It is my observation that no more than 15 percent of the evangelical Christian community is completely free from Satan's bondage." Though Neil generously speaks of the remainder as Christians, from his description of them they have the behavior traits of those described in Galatians, Ephesians and Revelation who (Scripture says) will never enter the Kingdom of heaven. 

Ray Comfort's emphasis is that we don't tell the truth - again fraud and deceit - when bringing people to Christ. As a result, the seed is scattered on stony ground and though received with rejoicing the person falls away quickly in times of difficulty and/or persecution. I agree with Ray that there must be a 100% honest presentation of the gospel. 

Part II will deal with deceit in the presentation of the Gospel. The combination of fraud and deceit is likely the reason that 95% or more of the people who "come to faith" quickly fall away. 

Scriptures were taken from The New International Version, (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House) 1984.

 The Case for a Pre-Tribulation Rapture 
 by Leah Bourne
====================================================== 



Those of you who have read the main article on my webpage (see URL below) may be asking how I can be so sure the Rapture will be prior to the events of WWIII. Or, you may have been taught in a sermon or read a book that the Rapture will not take place until after the Tribulation, that the Rapture and the Second Coming of Christ are the same event. I ask you, then, to consider the following information, and see for yourselves that the problem posed by a post tribulation rapture are insurmountable. 

I am presuming that most readers are familiar with the usual and customary scriptural arguments. If, however, you are a newcomer to the study of Prophecy, I suggest you read the companion article to this post, an excerpt from the book Things to Come by J. Dwight Pentecost, which gives scriptural references. (http//members.tripod.com/~LCrBourne/things.html) *address IS case sensitive!* 

1. The time of the Second Coming

Jesus repeatedly told the church that we would have no idea when we would be transformed into our new and improved immortal bodies. "That day and hour no one knows," is one example of the oft-repeated refrain. So the Church will be taken from the earth at an unknowable time. 

However, the events described in the book of Revelation leading up to the visible return of Christ are also described in the Old Testament in many books - most particularly in the book of Daniel. Daniel gives some pretty specific information for those having to endure the Time of Jacob's Trouble (aka the Tribulation). Seven years before the return of Christ the False Messiah will sign a treaty with the people of Israel. Three and one half years later the False Messiah will come to Jerusalem, go up to the Temple Mount, declare himself ruler of the world, and unveil a statue of himself that everyone must bow down to. Then, another 3 and one half years later, Christ will return visibly with his army. 

We know the "abomination of desolation" that is to happen midway through the Tribulation has not occurred yet, even though a similar incident happened during the time of the Macabees, because Jesus spoke plainly of it as not yet happening in His sermon on the mount. He said, "When you see the abomination standing where it ought not" that the people in Jerusalem should flee to Southern Jordan without even taking the time to go back into their homes and pack. Other Old Testament prophets describe this scene as well. Nothing even remotely like this has happened since Jesus confirmed Daniel's prediction. When the Romans invaded Jerusalem in 79 AD, they did not erect a statue, did not make anyone bow down to such a statue, and Jesus did not return with his army 3 and one half years later. This has simply not yet occurred. 

Therefore we are anticipating it in the future. But wait! Anyone who sees the signing of the protection treaty for Israel, or sees the abominable statue erected on the Temple Mount (live on CNN, I'm sure), only has to read the Book of Daniel and the Book of Revelation to know exactly when Christ will visibly return! Daniel gives the figure TO THE DAY - two sets of 2250 days each, to be exact (each 3 and one half year part is 2250 days!) totaling 7 years. How can the church still be on earth when these things are taking place, when Jesus told us we WILL NOT know the day? People living during the Tribulation will certainly know the day, presuming they can read and they can count. 

2. What nations are those anyway?

Another problem with the theory that the Rapture will take place at the same time as the Second Coming of Christ is the description of events in the last few chapters of the Book of Revelation. Think about it - at the Rapture ALL Christians, alive and dead, are raised to new, improved, immortal bodies. Jesus tells us that in the resurrection, there is no marriage and that we will be as angels. 

Now, if you read the descriptions of the Millennial Kingdom in the Old Testament, you are repeatedly given pictures and verses that say things like, "infants will not die a few days old," and "someone a hundred years of age will be considered young," and "the elderly will sit under their trees happily." Now, class, if everyone has their new and improved bodies, and there is no marriage, where will those babies come from? And if everyone is going to live forever, who cares what the age of majority will be? And if we never get sick, never get old, and never die, who is ever going to be elderly? 

The answer to this problem is simple - the Rapture is not at the Second Coming of Christ. It is much earlier. Some people survive WWIII as mortal human beings and enter the Millennial Kingdom as such. These have babies, who becomes youths and grow old in an earthly paradise. 

We know this is true, because of what happens at the end of Revelation. After the 1000 year kingdom is over, Satan is loosed again. He once again turns some people away from Jesus and leads a rebellion of many Nations against Christ. Now, think about this for a minute. If you believe that the Rapture occurred at the same time as the Second Coming of Christ, then you are suggesting that resurrected, immortal people are rejecting Jesus at the end of the 1000 years! I find that a bit difficult to believe. It is MUCH more likely that the descendants of the original mortal settlers could be led astray than to believe anyone saved by grace and faith could ever throw that gift back in God's face. 

3. I don't know about you, but I have a hard enough time gardening in NORMAL weather. 

Jesus gives us an interesting picture of what will be happening at the time of the Rapture. He says that it shall be as in the days of Noah - people will be marrying, and working, and partying, and so on. Specifically, he notes, "Two will be working in the field, one taken, the other left." Working in the field is gardening or farming, of course. 

Now, think about this. What is going on in the world at the End of the Tribulation? ALL grain and grass and herbs have been burnt to a crisp. One Third of all trees are dead. All of the fresh water is contaminated. The ozone has been blown away and the sun is scorching the earth. Elsewhere nuclear winter has caused a thick, burning blackness to descend on the people. Everyone is suffering from boils and rashes from radiation poisoning. Earthquakes and hailstones 100 lbs. each have been falling - do you think anyone's going to be blissfully standing outside hoeing the carrots? Seriously, I doubt it. Do you think in all that there are going to be any wedding parties with all that going on with every island and mountain disrupted by the falling nukes? I find that a bit difficult to swallow, to say the least. 

On the other hand, before the Tribulation begins the earth will truly be in the days of Noah - people tripping along happily with no CLUE about what God is getting ready to do to them. Before the Rapture, there will be scoffers in the last days (I know, they're here now, but let me finish!) - do you think anyone is going to be scoffing AFTER the Rapture???? Is anyone going to be able to say with a straight face that the Bible is not true when all this is happening??? Notice in Revelation that it does NOT say people still refused to believe in God. It says they curse him for their pain and suffering. Whether God exists or not will no longer be an issue, I assure you. Everybody will know "that I am the Lord." The time when people will be calmly going about their business will end long before the visible Second Advent of Christ and his army. 

4. Well, it seemed like a dumb idea at the time. 

The last point I would like to make is somewhat related to number three above - it concerns the mark of the beast. How many people do you know would call you an idiot if you suggested that computerized banking had anything to do with the devil? Yet the Bible says millions of these same, carnal, rational, modern people are going to refuse to participate in the cashless economic system by refusing the microchip in their hand. What will change the minds of these millions of people? Think about it - do the carnal Christians you know now really look like people who will be willing to let their families starve rather than take the mark? Do they really act like people who would be willing to die rather than accept a simple microchip? Do you really think they could stand there and watch their children be executed? Their spouses? Their parents? And still not just take a simple 1 second shot? Not in this lifetime!!! Yet the Bible says uncounted millions will refuse the mark and be killed by the beast and his forces. 

How can that be? These countless people, who go to church but don't really believe, who more or less know about the Bible but don't take it seriously, what is suddenly going to convince these people to become Tribulation martyrs, to be willing to DIE rather than go against the Bible??? The RAPTURE, of course! It will take seeing their friends and family members vanish into thin air, seeing the mess made by people suddenly disappearing, JUST LIKE THEY WERE TOLD WOULD HAPPEN, that will get these people off the fence. It is only the Miracle of the Rapture, and seeing the events predicted for the Tribulation coming true before their very eyes, that will give them the fortitude to stand up for God and shun the beast. Knowing that Jesus will return with His army in only seven years will be a TREMENDOUS strengthening influence on them. How would you act if you read Daniel and could tell to the day when Jesus would return? A lot differently, I'll bet. When faced with eternity, it won't be nearly so hard to make the right decisions here on earth. So these people who witnessed the Rapture but were left behind will become those millions of martyrs and survivors of the Tribulation. They know they only have to hold out for seven years. That's how a carnal Christian changes into a man or woman of God - by seeing it with their own eyes. Trial by fire, to be sure. But those who "overcome" will live again in Paradise - what more motivation do you need?? 

- The End - for now.

 The Gospel Means Good News
  Dr. Jack Van Impe

Easter is the time set aside by the world to remember the crucifixion and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. To the genuine Christian there is no other plan of salvation. But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ (Galatians 6:14). That if thou...shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved (Romans 10:9). 

The subject content found in these two portions of scripture constitutes the Gospel message: Christ died for our sins, was buried, and rose again. This truth should be indelibly inscribed upon every believer's heart. There is no other "good news." Eternal life is eliminated if Christ went into a coma and then revived. The Gospel, meaning "good news," is "bad news" if Christ did not die by shedding His blood, for then the world has no adequate sacrifice for sin. If He died and remained in the grave, the dilemma is compounded because He then becomes an imposter by breaking all of the promises and predictions concerning His resurrection. 

Matthew 16:21: From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day. 

John 2:19,21: Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up...But he spake of the temple of his body. 

Had He not fulfilled these utterances He would have proven himself to be a fraud. However, 1 Corinthians 15:20 states, But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept [or were dead]. He proved His deity through the greatest miracle ever recorded in the annals of history. 

Oh, what a wonderful Saviour! Buddha, Mohammed, and Zoroaster never made such claims and are presently skeletons. The Lord Jesus Christ is the only risen Saviour. Were He still lying in the tomb in the Middle East completely decomposed-just a skull and bones-He would be disqualified to be the Saviour of the world. But He lives, thereby proving His Godhead and power.

Will It Matter?

When Messiah sits upon his throne,
to judge the nations true.
And every people, race and tongue,
profess their faith anew.
When Israel shall be blessed,
extolled by every heart.
Their curse erased by boundless grace,
that never will depart.
Will it matter if the faithful,
are known as something new?
Would it mean that much to anyone,
if a Christian were a Jew.
