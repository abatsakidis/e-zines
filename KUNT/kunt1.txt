                             Our Lady's Message
                       Through Gianna Stallone Segal
               at St. Cooze's Catholic Brothel, Emmitsburg, MD
                               July 4, 1996
  

    My dear little children, fornicate for Jesus!

    Little ones, do not be discouraged with impotence in your life, but trust
in Jesus and remain steadfast in your onanism. I am here to bring you closer
to Jesus' bed and He will bring you to the Father for "sloppy seconds". 
    Do not become excited when people fondle you. This is part of the
spiritual path to horniness and many times unavoidable. The more you become
a horndog the more the world will scorn you, humiliate you and persecute
you. Do not fear; I am your Mother of Lust and I will fellate you. All
who seek refuge in My Immaculate Snatch will be safe and filled with a deep
inner joy, if a little damp and slimy, and redolent of fish. 
    Here at this valley of My beloved St. Cooze is the center which My
Immaculate Furburger invites all children to seek refuge. Look to my Mons,
little ones, for strength in your wankings and rejoice in Them that He 
has lead you astray. He will lead you to hot wet sex and eternal Hellfire.
    It is necessary for all to respond to His soft touch if evil is to be
promoted. You cannot be limp. A lack of response is a lack of lust. It
is necessary to be disciplined and obedient to His call, not to mention His
Whips, Chains and Buttplugs. You must make an effort to scream convincingly
if Jesus is to make you one of His Bitches. 
    I love you little children, especially in those short plaid skirts,
and fondle you in His place. Piss to you, in Fond Remembrance of His
Predilection for Golden Showers.

                          SoMe DaY iN JuLY...i996

     WeLCoMe To KuNT!!%$^

     It's the first issue of KuNT. I didn't expect it ever to get this far
when me and the rest of the KuNT KRoWD decided to write a zine.

     Allow me to introduce myself...I lack both wealth and taste.

     You won't guess my name, though.

     Why are we doing this? Because there's a lack of truly k-RaD zines out
there, nowadays. Plus, we were all incredibly fucking bored.

     Now, just so I can get some stuff of my chest, I'm going to send some
thanks out to some people who really deserve them.     

     * Phlintlok Jesus, for The Book Of 416
     * TWaT, for the coolest zine to grace my disk's electrons
     * BooYaa, for being one of the funniest motherfuckers ever to live
     * KiploH, for his help
     * Filbert, for PHRuWT
     * Ken (nuff said)
     * David Lynch
     * Timmy Leary, we miss you
     * Jesus of Nazareth, for showing that Christianity was a crock of shit

     That's it.

     But before I go, my disclaimer, which applies to everything in every
issue of KuNT:

     NEITHER I, NOR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR OR MEMBER OF KuNT MAKES ANY CLAIMS
AS TO THE INFORMAITON CONTAINED HEREIN. IF YOU DO SOMETHING WE DESCRIBE IN
HERE, FUCK UP, AND GET CAUGHT, WE WILL REIMBURSE YOU UP TO AND INCLUDING THE
AMOUNT WHICH YOU PAID FOR THIS TEXT, NAMELY ZERO DOLLARS AND ZERO CENTS.
HOWEVER, IF YOU DO GET CAUGHT DOING SOMETHING, YOU AGREE TO TELL EVERY PERSON
WHO ASKS THAT YOU LEARNED IT FROM KuNT, AND NOWHERE ELSE.

FBI Arrests Dangerous Computer Hacker

(AP, July 18th) The FBI has arrested one of the most dangerous, and most
widely known computer vandals the world has ever known. Edward Peer, known for
resetting connections between computers on the Internet for many years, and
leaving his calling card everytime he did this. Mr. Peer would stop
communication between computers using a as yet unknown method, and directed 
the systems to report and error of "Connection Reset by Peer". 
      Under interrogation by FBI agents, Mr. Peer refused to give up any 
secrets whatsoever. Mr. Peer was asked if he knew how many systems he had 
infiltrated and disrupted over the years, but he refused again to disclose any 
information.
      It is believed that Mr. Peer worked in cohorts with the infamous group 
of computer delinquents known simply as 'KuNT' in disrupting communications 
around the world. Mr. Peer would give no statement concerning this hypothesis.
      Associated Press reporters established contact with a KuNT member who 
gave his identification only as 'The Silicon Farmer' for comment. Mr. Farmer 
was quoted as saying, "Give me a quarter, and I'll tell you your fortune." 
When asked to clarify his position on the Peer case, Mr. Farmer said, "A 
fortune for a quarter. I LOVE quarters!" Communications between Mr. Farmer and 
reporters ceased at this time, when Mr. Farmer proceeded to attempt and order 
a pizza with extra cheese and pepperoni from the reporters.
      A few hours later, The Associated Press was reached by telephone by KuNT
member 'Deadline', who informed us that he was on vacation in Miami Beach,
soaking up a tan and having sexual experiences with "Hot blondes on the 
beach."
      Deadline gave his position on the Peer case as, "Well, would YOU want 
someone touching you on your willy?" When asked to reconsider his position 
concerning Edward Peer, Deadline mumbled something into the phone that sounded 
something like, "Well, look I wanna get high, ok, but all I have is a handful 
of nutmeg." The phone conversation was terminated at that time.
      Further attempts at reaching the KuNT organization were made, and
eventually a third member of KuNT, SaTaNuS MaXiMuS, was reached via telephone.
Mr. MaXiMuS was asked to reply to allegations that Mr. Edward Peer and the 
KuNT organization were jointly involved in this series of computer break-ins 
and intrusions. "I have a dream.. that one day, I will make a fuckload of 
money and buy the damn Associated Press, and use it to further the KuNT child 
porn ring," Mr. MaXiMuS said. "There is someone that you should speak to about
this," we were informed, and a supposed second party, who identified 
themselves as Horatio, was brought to the telephone for comment. "Horatio says 
hi. Horatio is SaTaNuS MaXiMuS' penis," said this party who we assume to be 
KuNT operative Horatio. (It must be noted that speculation is abound that 
Horatio was indeed just a fake personage, because his voice sounded like Mr. 
MaXiMuS' voice, only a few octaves higher.) "Horatio get hard while looking at 
goat," Horatio stated. "Oh mama. My mama is [a] goat. Horatio fuck her ass all 
day long without getting soft." The phone was apparently dropped on the other 
end, and a few shouts of joy and a voice intoning, "YES, DEAR GOD, I'M 
CUMMING!" were heard before the phone connection was broken.
      The KuNT organization could not be reached for further comment.
      Currently, Mr. Peer is waiting arraignment on charges that could 
possibly range from criminal trespass to rape. Arraignment is set for next 
Tuesday.

From the AP Newswire, July 19th

Group Disclaims Responsibility for Airliner Bombing

      The Associated Press received a statement from a group known as KuNT 
today, disclaiming any responsibility for the recent bombing of TransWorld 
Airlines Flight 800. Flight 800 exploded over Long Island, New York, on July 
17th, starting a cleanup and rescue mission that included members of the FBI, 
FCC, and U.S. Coast Guard.
      The group known as KuNT called Associated Press offices in Greenbow,
Alabama, vehemently denying responsibility for the disaster. "I mean, if we 
were going to bomb the damn thing, we would have used a bigger bomb, and blew 
the damn thing up at the airport," stated a member of KuNT, who gave his only
identification as 'Deadline'. This person went on to state, "Besides, we were
too busy renting porno videos from the video store and having a nice quiet
circle jerk." When the Associated Press staffer pressed for details about 
their get-together, Deadline replied, "It was good for me. We'll invite you to 
cover it next time."
      This person went on to state that there would be problems in the future
concerning citizens of the United States, hinting that KuNT would be a major
player in these occurances. "Remember that blackout that occured over the
Western portion of the United States? We'll do it again," Deadline stated. At
this point, the phone was muffled, and conversation went on in the background.
We believe it to be between Deadline and another two members of this
organization, referred to by this mysterious person as 'Sis' and 'Honey
Bunches'. The phone was unmuffled at this point, and the spokesperson for KuNT
proceeded to describe the pleasures of oral sexual activities that a fellow
KuNT member was giving to him. "Yeah, Sis is good," he stated between moans 
and groans. After this, Deadline proceeded to mutter a quick few words that 
were not caught by the staffer taking the phone call, and hung up the phone. 
One can only wonder at what lies in store for America.

NYPD Child Sex Sting Backfires

(July 17) The New York City Police Department uncovered a supposed child sex
ring in New York City early this week, but a sting operation backfired when 
the Police themselves were found to be the culprits of this hideous crime.
      In the wee hours of the morning on July 15th, New York City Police
Department invaded a building in the SoHo section of New York City, where an
anonymous tip led them to believe that a child pornography and sex operation
was being run. The police found two members of the paramilitary group KuNT
sitting around a television set watching what was later identified to be an
episode of 'Barney and Friends'. These members were identified as KuNT members
SaTaNuS MaXiMuS and D1G1S4URUS H3X. (Their true names cannot be released,
due to their innocence of the charges brought against them.) Police placed
these men under armed watch while the rest of the building was searched.
      In searching the apartment, officers came across KuNT member Deadline in
the bathroom, taking a bath, along with what was identified as various Ken and
Barbie dolls from Mattel(tm), and a small sheep named Marko. Deadline was
engaged in anal copulation with the sheep named Marko, and repeatedly asked
police officers to leave the area while he "Finished his business with Marko."
      Police also came across a bedroom where KuNT member The Silicon Farmer was
downloading pictures of a person later identified as Wynonna Judd. Farmer was
found with one hand down in his underwear (later identified as Hanes Briefs,
Waist 32), and another hand pushing what appeared to be a large cucumber into
his anal sphincter.
      Needless to say, officers did not find anything out of the ordinary at 
the building, but were helpfully provided with a location of a Kiddie Porn 
stash at another location in SoHo. Later on that night, officers conducted a 
second sting operation, and found three NYPD officers, in uniform, performing
masturbatory acts while staring at a pornographic picture in a magazine
entitled, "Boys Love Their Daddies". Their erect penis lengths were later
recorded at one inch, one and a half inches, and one and a quarter inches in
length. These men were placed under arrest, and were placed under arrest and
charged with endangering the welfare of a minor, possession of child
pornography, and having really small schlongs.
      KuNT members could not be reached for comment. However, sources tell us
that KuNT plans to file a $50 Million defamation of character lawsuit against
the Mayor of New York and the New York City Police Department.

CERT(sm) Advisory CA-96.66 July 23, 1996

Topic: Hacked system -- whitehouse.gov

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CERT Coordination Center has received a report of a hacker
breaking in to the computer systems of the United States Govern-
ment, located at whitehouse.org. The hacker exploited a poorly
chosen authorization password by a simple brute force guess.

The White House wishes to emphasize that there is no threat to
National Security due to the fact that a complete log of this
hacker's actions is available, and no private files were accessed.

The CERT Coordination Center wishes to use this as an opportunity
to remind everyone of the importance of well-chosen passwords for
system security.

As  we  receive additional information relating to this advisory,
we will place it in

        ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-96.66.README

We encourage you to check our README files regularly for  updates
on advisories that relate to your site.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

A hacker known only as 'tsf', (based on his login at the system
he telnetted in from) successfully gained root access on the systems
located at whitehouse.gov two days ago. Following are the relevant
portions of the system accounting logs:

Jul 21 19:25:12 porch in.telnetd[4923]: connect from farm.kunt.org
Jul 21 19:25:12 porch in.telnetd[4924]: connection refused - no authorization
Jul 21 19:32:23 yard  in.securetelnetd[25]: attempted connect from kunt.org
Jul 21 19:32:45 yard  in.securetelnetd[26]: connect from kunt.org, root
Jul 21 19:32:52 door  in.syslogd[42]: root - who
Jul 21 19:33:07 door  in.syslogd[43]: root - w
Jul 21 19:33:55 door  in.syslogd[44]: root - cat > invis.c
  [utmp exploit removed from log for security purposes]
Jul 21 19:35:52 door  in.syslogd[45]: root - /opt/gnu/bin/gcc -o invis invis.c
Jul 21 19:36:22 door  in.syslogd[46]: root - ./invis
Jul 21 19:36:35 door  in.syslogd[47]: root - kill -9 -1

At this point in his break-in, the hacker killed all current processes
on whitehouse.gov. This signed him off, as well as all valid users. Upon
noticing this unauthorized kill, the authorized sysadmin changed the root
password to a randomly generated one.

II.  Impact

This break-in holds no impact to the Ineternet community, other
than to reinforce the idea of using secure passwords.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The  CERT Coordination Center staff thanks Doug Patecell for his
solution to the problem and for his support with this advisory.

c0d3n4m3: 0p3r4ti0n 4tl4nt4 X

Needed:

50000   square yards of polyester fabric
100000  square yards of velvet fabric
20000   pairs of platform shoes
1500    8-track tapes of assorted disco music
            (examples: BeeGees, Electric Light Orchestra)
1       disco ball
20000   leisure suits
50000   bean bag chairs
20000   mood rings
7500    bottles of InstantAfro(tm) Brand Shampoo
35000   lava lamps
1       really fucking huge lava lamp
20000   pairs of bellbottoms
100000  tapes of brady bunch, partridge family episodes, bad 70s porno films

All this can be purchased at local thrift stores and flea markets, recorded 
off Nick at Nite, or purchased through the 70s Preservation Society.

Plan of Attack:

o     Sneak into Atlanta using the secret KuNTMobile.

o     Go to Olympic Stadium.

o     Replace seats with bean bag chairs, replace astroturf with polyester.

o     Install 8-track player and hook it up to stadium sound system, remove 
      all other music playing devices such as trombones, etc, from the band. 

o     Mislabel 8-track tapes with names such as 'Zimbabwian National Anthem'.
      Leave them for unsuspecting technicians to discover when they play the
      Star Spangled Banner, and Fame comes on instead.

o     Go into Athletic Equipment lockers, replace uniforms with leisure suits,
      mood rings, and bellbottoms. Replace sneakers with platform shoes.

o     Replace Olympic Torch with Disco Ball and Huge Lava Lamp.

o     Replace video play back system tapes with tapes of old Brady Bunch and
      Partridge Family episodes.

o     Sneak into rooms of athletes of African descent, replace their shampoo 
      with InstantAfro(tm) Brand Shampoo

o     Repeat above steps for all Olympic Venues in the area. When interior
      operations concerning the Olympic Venues have been completed, the 
      remainder of the polyester fabric will be used to drape the exteriors of 
      the buildings.

o     Go to all hotels in the area, one by one. Proceed with the following 
      steps:

      o     Reupholster all sofas, love seats, with velvet. Replace all 
            bedsheets, pillowcases, etc, with velvet.

      o     Replace inhouse movies in the hotels with episodes of the Brady 
            Bunch, Partridge Family, and bad 70s porno movies such as Deep 
            Throat.

      o     Hack into the inhouse phone system. Set up an 8-track stereo 
            hidden in a back closet to pipe 70s music and assorted disco 
            classics through the phone system continously.

      o     Replace all lighting sources with lava lamps.

      o     Replace hotel uniforms with bellbottoms, leisure suits, mood 
            rings, and platform shoes.

o     Take all the items that were replaced, sell them for a huge profit on 
      the  black market.

o     Have members of KuNT take a fun-filled vacation to Club Med. Get laid
      multiple times by hot babes while watching Atlanta go back twenty years 
      in time to the 70s.

                 KuNT oWNS LeTTeRMaN, So We CaN Do THis

10 Things Lamers Do With or Thought About by Lamers concerning /etc/passwd

1.    They trade it.

2.    "/etc/passwd? there arent any passwords in here like i thought, only 
      some random letters and numbers.. this is worthless. i spent all that 
      time typing cat /etc/passwd for nothing!"

3.    Offshoot of #2: "Gee, lets take all those random numbers and letters and
      replace them with passwords that are easier to type.. The users will 
      thank me for this. Hmm, lets ditch this n5dwR7vgIUaWw thing and replace 
      it with.. 'taco', yes, taco sounds like a nice password. Ok, next user, 
      lets replace this dk38sd7a1Ad3 thing with.. hmm.. how about 'water'..."

4.    They think that * in the password field means you can login under any
      password.. cause * is a wildcard character, right?

5.    "Man, the passwd file said + + so i think it's like an rlogin thing! 
      Yeah!"

6.    "Hey, if the passwd file is shadowed.. that means that if the passwd 
      sees its shadow, it wont come out of its hole for another 6 weeks, and 
      we will have a late spring!"

7.    Removing all the other logins from /etc/passwd so that nobody else will 
      be able to login and trace them while they do hax0rly things.

8.    "Heh, I'll switch all the logins around so nobody will know who is who! 
      Ha Ha I am a master hacker!"

9.    "Damn, how am I supposed to get the passwords out of this thing? I know, 
      I will get the sysadmin's number by doing whois on their domain, and I 
      will ask them if they know.. After all it *is* their password file.."

10.   "I KNOW!!! I'll give this passwd file to the l33t d00dz at KuNT! They'll
      know what to do with it!!"
