WHAT IS MANT?

	MANT is a conservative Christian Anti-Hacker group formed under the word
of the LORD to find, punish, and eventually DESTROY those who would use comput-
ers for anything other than pure and wholesome purposes.  MANT played a key role
in producing the original CDA law, and will fight hard to make sure that God's
word is carried through again and that smut is totally eliminated from this im-
pure "Internet."  In exchange for their services to senator Exon, they have been
provided with a machine running UNIX so they can make things safe.  Unfortunatly
none of the MANT teams knows how to use UNIX beyond logging onto IRC, but they
will be sure that IRC remains clean.
	Seeing a problem in their lack of knowledge about the "Dark side" of 
computer useage, MANT has decided to recruit one of the enemy onto their team.
One Graham Bullers is the newest to join MANT's ranks.  While Graham knows even
less about UNIX than even the Network Administrator, he was able to provide MANT
with a text called the "Jolly Roger's Cookbook," which details all the most up-
to-date and potent techiniques possessed by the hacker community.  MANT is cer-
tain that with the use of this document, they can easily put an end to all hack-
ing and sin on the Internet.
	MANT asks that you remember the following passages from the Most Holy
Book of the Lord while you travel on IRC:  Genesis 1:1, Exodus 15:4, Mark 7:3,
Luke 34:6, Revelat$^(#7@*#$^&#

Yes, that's right kiddies, it's time for the journies of that hero of
heroes, KOMMANDOR K-KEEN, and his two misguided partners, Wanderer Foo
and Prime Minister Bar!

           <KOMMANDOR K-KEEN stands flexing with his companions by his side 
            looking proud to be near him.>

Together they travel across the cosmos and fight the dark forces of the
SPA, who want to put an end to warez, kodez, and all else that is
Tr00Ly K-EleeT in the universe!

           <KOMMANDOR K-KEEN hands out the newest version of Photoshop to
            orphans gathered around him and kisses a baby.>

See them battle the army of darkness from the NSA, armed only with a
copy of AOHell!

           <KOMMANDER K-KEEN mailbombs thousands of federal agents and watches
            them drop as his partners watch him admirably from behind.>

See them win a stakeout against the head of the FBI himself through
sheer k-rad natural ability!!!!

           <KOMMANDOR K-KEEN stares at the FBI Director sternly in the eyes,
            and the FBI director bursts into tears.>

Yes, life is a truly better place, all because we have KOMMANDOR K-KEEN
AND THE BISQUIK BOYZ fighting on our side!

           <KOMMANDOR K-KEEN holds an American flag and stares off into space
            as the national anthem plays.>

               TONIGHT'S EPISODE:  TROUBLE ON THE AOL FRONT

Scene:  The KOMMANDOR K-KEEN patented warez HQ

Adventurer Foo:  Wow, look at this catalog!  There's a new version of Illustra-
                 tor just released today!

KOMMANDOR K-KEEN:  Oh Really, my young friend?  Well then, I suggest you use the
                   warez-mobile to sign on AOL and get it!

Prime Minister Bar:  But isn't using an account made with a fake credit card in
                     order to steal software ILLEGAL?

KOMMANDOR K-KEEN:  Of course not, Bar!  They wouldn't do it if it weren't safe!

           <Foo enters his password and attempts to sign on, but is unable to
            for some mysterious reason.>

Adventurer Foo:  I can't seem to sign on!

KOMMANDOR K-KEEN:  Uh oh.  Looks like Evil Overlord Case is up to his old tricks
                   again.  I'll have to stop him.

Prime Minister Bar:  What are you planning on doing???

KOMMANDOR K-KEEN:  Don't worry!  I have a few proggies up my sleeve!

           <KOMMANDOR K-KEEN sits at the terminal and runs one of his more elite
            hacker programs.  Fourteen hours pass.>

KOMMANDOR K-KEEN:  Ah hah!  I've done it!  I'm in!

Adventurer Foo:  You're brilliant!

Prime Minister Bar:  Now what?

KOMMANDOR K-KEEN:  Now...it's time for revenge.

           <Fade to black.>

SCENE:  New Member Lounge 14

KOMMANDOR K-KEEN:  I have arrived!

Gif Perv69:  Who the Hell are you?  Have any pictures of young children having
             sex with goats?

KOMMANDOR K-KEEN:  I am KOMMANDOR K-KEEN, and these are my partners, THE BISQUIK
                   BOYZ.  Bar, send the man what he wants!

           <Bar mails Gif Perv a collection of various child pornography.>

Gif Perv69:  Wow!  Thankx man!

Newbie9394:  i amm new too inturrnett.  how dew i hakk laike u?

Adventurer Foo:  Why don't you post to alt.aol-sucks and ask them?  I'm sure 
                 they would be glad to help!

KOMMANDOR K-KEEN:  That's exactly right, Foo!  You're becoming more perceptive
                   every day!  Don't forget to post it at least sixteen times
                   so that they'll be sure to see it!

Newbie9394:  thannk yu.  i goess of to yoosnet now

HAQAH666:  Halt KOMMANDOR K-KEEN!  Your copy of AOHell is nowhere near as eleet
           as my new version of AOLSD 2001 version 6969 beta 3!  I will crush
           you!

KOMMANDOR K-KEEN:  Step aside, citizen!  Your puny proggie is nowhere as power-
                   ful as my inate k-hacker skills!

HAQAH666:  Never!  This is war, K-KEEN!

KOMMANDOR K-KEEN:  Fine, if you insist.  I only hope you survive to tell of this
                   foolish encounter.

           <KOMMANDOR K-KEEN scrolls a picture of a middle finger.>

HAQAH666:  Stop!  Please!  I give up!  Please don't hurt me!

KOMMANDOR K-KEEN:  You're forgiven, but next time remember not to let your
                   impetuousness get the better of you!

HAQAH666:  Oh, I won't!  Thank you, KOMMANDOR K-KEEN!

           <Guide PIG joins the room.>

Guide PIG:  What the FUCK is going on here?  I heard there was a fucking distur-
            bance and now I have to fucking deal with it!  How dare you little
            pukes cut into my free time?

           <Foo and Bar begin to shiver in the presence of the guide.>

Newbie9394: iz  not badd langaudge against amurica onlin term servicez?

Guide PIG:  NO!  SHUT THE FUCK UP!
           <Guide PIG Terms Newbie9394.>
            Will there be any OTHER stupid questions tonight?

KOMMANDOR K-KEEN:  I have one for you, evil doer!  Do you really think that you
                   can stop the warez empire when it is under the protection of
                   KOMMANDOR K-KEEN?

Guide PIG:  You will die, KOMMANDOR!

KOMMANDOR K-KEEN:  We shall see who comes out alive!

           <KOMMANDOR K-KEEN executes an elite script just as Guide PIG presses
            the term button for KOMMANDOR K-KEEN and his friends.>

Guide PIG:  Argh!!!!  Not an IM bomb!!!  AAAAAAIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!

           <Guide PIG is knocked offline by its awesome power, when suddenly
            KOMMANDOR K-KEEN finds himself offline, as well.>

SCENE:  The HQ, moments later.

Adventurer Foo:  Wow!  That was amazing the way you handled that Guide!

Prime Minister Bar:  But there are still many other guides!

KOMMANDOR K-KEEN:  Don't worry, Bar!  For someday we will face Evil Overlord
                   Case himself, and defeat all his cohorts!  Because as long as
                   someone is unwilling to pay for the newest version of Duke
                   Nukem, Windows 95, or needs the newest kodez to unlock Paint
                   Shop Pro, WE WILL SURVIVE!

            <Fades to black, and the credits roll.>

HeY StRiDeR D00d,


The "Artisians"?  Righteous, man.  It's so Renaissance and yet, being
misspelled, it still says the 90's.  I want in.  I'm too busy hacking
to eat or sleep d00d, so you better know what you're getting into by
taking my bad ass on board.  You want Elite, I'm Elite.  Don't talk to
me about warez and fake accounts.  I'm the man who put the Z in warez:
I superglued it to the end of the word.  And look, I'm rolling in
passwords, I've got so many I'm logging on as twenty different people
simultaneously and filling entire chatrooms with a Greek Chorus of
like-minded rabid cynical hacker d00dism -- I'm so rad that I'm even
phishing my own screennames.  These keyboards stacked up on my desk?
When I'm going on them, with the screens casting a bluish hue on my
Raybans, I look like Stevie Wonder -- verrrrrry superstitious.  I've
got the number 2600 tattooed on my tongue.  I blink in binary.
Rolexes from former East German Stasi agents band my forearms -- gifts
for teaching them how to use IRC, especially channel "Hackway to
Heaven," which I run.  Who needs to write in 3l173 h4kk3r type?
That's lameass *old*.  Me, I top off my prose with the ultimate in
cutting-edge hip: invisible control characters.  Hacking is my life,
do you understand?  I can't walk down the street without popping the
hoods of new cars and jimmying out the chips.  I can't go into a room
and turn on a light switch without wanting to dismantle it and embed
infrared sensors behind the wall to detect and alert me to possible
sneaky encroachments by THE MAN.  Hey: information wants to be free,
get off its back with your bullshit notions of copyright and
ownership, I mean that's so pre-Net, that's so Stone Age, it's like
the Beatles and Elvis and Ed Sullivan, man, ok?  It's I Love Lucy.
It's F-Troop.  Old.  Over.  Software belongs to nobody.  It should be
allowed to run around wherever it wants like free-range chickens.

So I guess you see where I'm at, Strider.  I could cut you some Elite,
I suppose.  But if I join, just don't go draining all my Elite like
some bloodsucking vampire.  D00d, I hate that.  Don't piggyback on my
cool.  Don't zeit on my geist.  Get your own mojo.  I mean, don't
expect me always to set you up on dates with supermodels.  Ain't gonna
happen -- I'll be busy upping a 3,485-part binary to a satellite over
Zurich for re-transmission to anti-Ross Perot separatists.  Or
liberating the recipe for the secret sauce in Big Macs.  Or perhaps
mailbombing Heaven itself.  I'm busy this week.  And next week.  And
don't always be bumming cigarettes from me, just because you want to
twirl them in your fingers like I do, causing them to ignite from
dizziness.  You should quit, anyway.

Here is a list of my hacks, in order of complexity:

#1.  Hacked past shrink-wrapping of Mary L-----, the most built girl
in my 8th grade class

#2.  Hacked onto brick wall of my school with can of spray paint,
writing *Gary L---- Is A Shithead* after Mary's big brother held me up
by my collar and shook me, all the while insisting that his sister was
a "good girl"

#3.  Hacked into TRS-80 using BASIC program that consisted of the
following ingenious code:

    10 REM Just try and stop this one, you bald bozo
    20 PRINT "MR. ALEXANDER'S CLASS SUCKS"
    30 GO TO 20

#4.  Hacked into NORAD mainframe, ordering ICBM assault on my high
school guidance counselor's house.  This was a leap for me, but
puberty was over, and a decisive new direction was needed.  (You've
probably never heard about this one -- that's because THE MAN doesn't
want you to know.  But it's been recounted in TONS of underground
zines by people who just take like a whole refreshing new view of the
way things *really* are.)

#5.  Hacked into AOL remote staffer Adam Bailey's account.  Planted
special TSR app to flash subliminal message across his screen: "I am a
genius.  Everything that I post to Usenet -- no matter how stupid --
is diabolically clever.  And everyone wants to read it.  I'll go post
something right now."

#6-23.  These hacks have involved, variously, the Rosecrucians, the
Masons, the Branch Dividians, Amway, Toastmasters, and a nail-clipping
from the left middle finger of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard.
It's all far too Elite to go into any detail here.  Not with THE MAN
listening.

#23 - ?  Don't even ask.  Don't ask.  Don't.  Ok: here's a clue.  Win
95.  And the director Preston Sturges's birthday.  I wouldn't click on
the little smiley face that's going to appear in the upper right
corner of your screen -- not if I were you.  Rent "Sullivan's Travels"
instead, and get a taste of truly elite comic filmmaking.

I think that proves my point, Strider.  We aren't in the same league,
and you'll be taking orders from *me* from now on.  My first order: I
want some coffee, black, with two lumps of sugar, trapezoidal
preferably.  Hop to it.

America Online President Dies in Apparent Suicide

(AP, August 15)America Online, Incorporated President, CEO, and Board of 
Directors head Steve Case was found dead in his Vienna, Virginia office earlier
this morning.  He was found amongst a circle of candles and what was later
analyzed and discovered to be goat's blood.  A criminal investigation has been
initiated to see if the goat's blood belongs to any of the 40 goats, which were
found slaughtered by their owner, a neighbor of the huge America Online office
complex.
	A suicide note was found on the scene along with the knife that Steve
apparently used to take his own life.  While it is not publiclly available, the
Case family have released portions that speak of "moving on to warmer pastures"
and "finding more efficient ways to torment lusers."
	While the Case family has been reluctant to discuss details of Steve's
death, many outside sources claim that they know of some things that very likely
led up to it.  A person known only as "Jane" contacted us.  Jane claims to be
an expert on matters of the occult.  She also claims that Steve was heavily
involved with local and national Satanic organizations, and was even hailed by
some to be "the most evil man on Earth."  The Case family refused to comment on
such allegations.
	The Catholic Church, which has long publicly dissapproved of many of
America Online's billing practices, when showed evidence of a connection 
between Case's suicide and Satanic cults, released a statement directly from the
Pope saying simply, "We told you so."
	Wall Street, however, was more concerned over who was going to take the
reigns of the multinational corporation than the cause of Steve's death.  AOL
respeonded quickly, by holding a meeting over a possible sale of the company, or
to elect a new head.  Major bidders in the sale were Apple Computer, H&R Block,
and Microsoft.  All, however, were surprised by the outcome of that meeting.
D1G1S4URUS H3X, alleged member of the anti-government militia terrorist group
"KuNT," announced that he would be taking over all executive positions that 
Steve had formally held.  America Online PR director Pam McGraph, commented only
that "he was much better in bed than Steve ever was."  D1G1S4UR was unavailable
for comment.

YOU WERE HAPPY.  YOU WERE CALM.  ONLY MINOR DIFFICULTIES LAY BETWEEN YOU AND
EXECUTING YOUR PLANS NEAR FLAWLESSLY.

YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE SAFE.

THEN I CAME.

I AM THE ONLY LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS WHICH YOU TRY TO CLOUD THE WORLD WITH.  YOU
SPREAD YOUR MISTRUTHS AND DONT THINK ANYBODY WILL NOTICE SINCE THEY'VE BEEN
CONCEALED IN YOUR DARKNESS FOR SO LONG.  YOU THINK SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER SEEN
LIGHT WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO ESCAPE THE DARKNESS.  BUT I AM THE LIGHT.  YOU 
PRETEND TO IGNORE ME.  YOU DENY MY EXISTANCE.  BUT SECRETLY YOU FEAR ME.  YOU
KNOW THAT I WILL DESTROY YOU JUST AS I DESTROYED EVERYONE ELSE WHO STOPPED ME
FROM SPREADING MY BRIGHTNESS.

YOU WERE RIGHT TO FEAR ME.

AND NOW I'M HERE, AND YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  YOUR ESTABLISHMENT WILL
CRUMBLE UNDER MY PIERCING RAYS.  I LURK THROUGH YOUR HALLWAYS, AND EVEN THOUGH
YOU REFUSE TO SEE ME, YOU KNOW THAT I'M HERE.  AND EVEN THOUGH YOU REFUSE TO

CAN'T HIDE, AND YOU KNOW YOU CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT YOUR DARKNESS...YOU WILL NEVER

KNOW HOW TO EXPLOIT THEM.

I CAN FUCKING SMELL YOUR DREAMS.

FEEL THE FEAR CREEPING THROUGH THE DARKEST REACHES OF YOUR SOUL.  YOU KNOW IN
YOUR STONE COLD HEART THAT EVERYTHING I SAY IS TRUE.  AND I APPROACH SOON.  VERY
SOON.  AND WHEN I FINISH, THERE WILL BE NOTHING LEFT BUT THE SMOLDERING ASHES
OF YOUR WORTHLESS EXISTANCE AND THE RUBBLE OF YOUR TORN DOWN INSTITUTIONS, 
ACTING AS MONUMENTS OF THE GLUTTONY AND IMPURITY OF YOUR FORMER SYSTEM WHICH YOU
TREASURED SO MUCH BEFORE.

                               LET'S MAKE LSD!

Materials required:

  Baking soda (Arm & Hammer works well),  15g
  Apple Cider Vinegar (Heinz makes this), 25mL
  Liquid Ammonia (used for cleaning),     100mL
  Liquid Bleach (also used for cleaning), 250mL
  A moldy piece of bread (prepare in advance)
  One large mixing bowl (Tupperware works)


Procedure:

(WARNING, THIS CAN BE DANGEROUS IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. WE
 SUGGEST THAT YOU READ THIS FILE ALL THE WAY THROUGH AT LEAST ONCE BEFORE
 YOU ATTEMPT TO MAKE LSD. ALL STEPS MUST BE FOLLOWED EXACTLY AS EXPLAINED
 IN THIS FILE.)

 1. Pour the Baking Soda into the mixing bowl.

 2. Pour the Ammonia into the mixing bowl.

 3. Scrape the mold off of the bread, and deposit a pinch (about 1g) into
    the mixing bowl.

 4. Pour the vinegar into the bowl -- THIS WILL CAUSE BUBBLING AS THE
    TRIGLYCERIDES BEGIN TO REACT WITH THE LYSERGICA IN THE MOLD. DO NOT
    BE ALARMED. (Although we suggest that you don't let it bubble over
    and get on your carpet.)

 5. Once the solution has stopped bubbling, this is where the important
    part comes in. You will be making gaseous LSD, and it is very important
    that you do not waste any, as LSD made using this process is nowhere
    near as powerful as that you can buy on the street, so more is required
    for a good buzz. Now, move the bowl into a room like your bathroom, and
    close the door, and also the window. Here you will be adding the bleach,
    which will begin the final reaction.

 6. Pour the bleach into the solution. You will immediately see a gaseous
    vapor rising from the bowl. THIS IS YOUR LSD! :-) Lean your head over
    the bowl, and begin inhaling deeply. Be sure to hold the vapor in, so
    that it has time to interact with the atria in your lungs. Continue
    inhaling until it kicks in, which should hopefully be within ten minutes.

(Warning: You may feel a little light-headed during this. This may be
 disconcerting if you have never done LSD before, but it indicates that
 you did the process right and it is starting to kick in.)

 7. Enjoy! We suggest you have some toys around that are bright and shiny;
    a well-oiled, well-polished pistol makes an excellent toy, as you can
    look down the barrel and imagine yourself falling through space, only
    a millimeter wide.

You suck.

Not because of any particular reason, but you suck. (Not meaning to imply that 
there is not a particular reason that you suck (Not meaning to imply that there 
isn't a particular reason that you suck.).) We just felt like telling you that 
you do, indeed, suck. (As opposed to being acceptable by us (Or being 
acceptable by any member of our society (Or being acceptable by members of 
another society besides our own (Or being acceptable to yourself (All of which 
are highly improbable, as we have incontrovertible evidence that points to the 
fact that you do actually suck.).).).).)

So what does "suck" mean, anyhow? Without going into a little mini-rant about 
how you can discover the meaning of 'suck' by looking at the world around you, 
at your friends, or even at yourself (Although we don't want to instill false 
thoughts that there is a world around you (Although we don't want to instill 
false thoughts that you do have friends (Although we don't want to instill 
false thoughts that you even exist.).).), and saying to yourself (which would 
be just a teensy bit hard if you didn't exist), "Just what's wrong with this 
picture?!" (Which would be just a teensy bit hard if there wasn't a world 
existing around you.) As it would take a couple dozen lifetimes, we suppose, 
to describe every possible picture in the world and why it sucks (i.e. why 
something is wrong with it (acting on the assumption that everything is 
flawed)), that action is pretty damn futile, because after a while you would 
realize that the only really sucky thing that is going on is you looking for 
things that suck, when you could just be satisfied with the fact that 
everything sucks and that there is no escape from it all.

Anyway, on to the etymology of 'suck'. The verb 'suck' means to, well, suck. 
However, in a more colloquial usage, 'suck' is used to indicate a sense of 
dislike, discontent, or lossage. (So we can apply that to our current topic, 
which is why you suck, in the following ways; that we dislike you, we do not 
like the way that you turned out when you finally crawled your sorry butt 
out of your mother's womb, and we think that you are a loser (A rather big 
loser, at that (Please don't get any false thoughts about how maybe you're a 
small loser, or that you have a chance at not being a loser, because you 
don't (Well, if you send $100,000 in small, unmarked bills to a really cool 
non-sucky place, whose address we will specify later, where we will arrive 
and pick up your little gift, you have a slight chance of being tolerated 
(Actually, you'll still be a loser, but a poor one, and we'll be these rich 
cool guys (And we'll also think that you are extremely stupid for sending me 
that money when it could have went towards enhancing your self image, so we 
would think less of you, which was the opposite desired effect of your 
actions (So don't send us any money if you don't want us to like you, and 
send us money if you don't want us to like you (See? You lose anyway you 
play the game, which is all the more evidence that you are indeed a loser, 
and that you do, in fact, suck.).).).).).).).) 

Well, with all this new knowledge about how you suck, what suck means, and how 
you are a loser, can we apply that to other people and circumstances? We could, 
because we don't want anyone to think that we am playing favorites by choosing 
only you as the 'target loser' for this rant, but then again we don't want 
anyone to think that we am not playing favorites. We could just stop everything 
right here, but then we wouldn't get out my opinions on why you, as well as 
every other animate or inanimate object in the world, suck. (And we wouldn't 
want that, because we'd be on the same level as you are; which is that of a 
sucky loser.) So we will do something rather improbable... well, improbable as 
opposed to the probability that at least 10% of the people living in the world 
today have taken at least one breath in the time it has taken you to read this 
sentence.

So, anyhow, it's time for that improbable thingy we alluded to in an earlier 
paragraph. The improbable thing is: 

During the time it takes you to read this sentence, you won't suck.

Hey, guess what? That sentence is over. You suck once more. Wasn't that 
amazing? We thought it was absolutely pointless, because you suck again. If 
you weren't going to suck again, it would've been great. We were looking 
forward to you not sucking, but as with a bunch of other events, all good 
things must come to an end. Well, you suck again; that's too bad, isn't it? 
Maybe for a birthday present you can not suck again for a minute or so. (We 
don't want to imply that we were hurting your feelings; however we don't 
want to imply that I wasn't hurting your feelings. We were aiming for a 
50%/50% hurting feelings/not hurting feelings ratio as our target.) We hope 
that we didn't hurt your feelings too badly. We also hope that I didn't 
make you feel too good about it, either. 

Our point is that whatever you do, you will suck at it, because we have 
successfully defined you as a loser, a sucker, a person who sucks, a sucky 
loser, and any other one of the myriad combinations of those terms. Let us 
explore this hypothesis, which should be easily proven true.

You suck because you have been proven to be a 'sucky loser', illustrated 
above.

You suck because you are reading this rant, instead of writing one yourself. 
The evidence pointing to this is the fact that you are reading this sentence. 
You would not know our opinions on why you suck if you have not read this 
paragraph. Furthermore, it is a paradox to assume that you know our standings 
on the issue of you sucking, when you have not read this rant, especially 
because we refuse to voice these opinions through any mode of direct 
communication other than this rant. When did you decide that you would 
spontaneously decide that we thought that you sucked? That is highly 
improbable, as we probably didn't think that you sucked before we wrote this. 
(Although we don't wish to imply that we didn't think that you sucked 
before we wrote this, nor do I wish to imply that we thought that you sucked 
before we wrote this. We leave major assumptions like this up to you (Although 
you suck so much that you probably do not possess the mental capacity to 
assume anything.).) Anyway, if you didn't suck, you would be out writing your 
own rant, possibly about why cross-dressing polar bears are a menace to 
society (Not that we wish to imply that cross-dressing polar bears are a 
menace to society (Not that we wish to imply that cross-dressing bears aren't 
a menace to society.).), instead of sitting here on your sorry ass reading 
this one.

Lastly, you suck simply because we say you do, and that single argument alone 
outweighs any piece of bullshit you can pick out of your ass... I mean brain... 
no, I mean ass... to throw at us in a counter-argument, possibly entitled 
"Why I Don't Actually Suck". (Though we don't question the highly probable 
possibility that you don't possess the knowledge on writing a proper rant (So 
there is a very high probability that your rant will suck, leading us to write 
something to the effect of Why You Suck, Part II (And it is even likelier that 
you will write a mediocre reply, and so this never-ending hole of ranting will 
grow bigger and deeper until it encompasses everything, and the whole universe 
will be one big hole, and it will be all your fault because you wouldn't shut 
the fuck up (Which would lead many sentient beings throughout this universe 
(and, quite possibly, other universes) to come to the conclusion that you suck 
quite badly (Leading to the ultimate outcome of you losing again.).).).).)

Let us venture off for a second, and discuss these 'other universes'. Do they 
actually exist? Do they suck? Are they acceptable by the non-sucky beings in 
existence (which you are not a member of, if you haven't noticed)? Well, first 
of all, what evidence do we have that they don't suck? Secondly, what evidence 
do we have that they suck? The answer to both of those questions is of course 
'none', so therefore we cannot make an assumption as to whether or not they 
suck or don't suck. Furthermore, the entire act of writing about these other 
universes is inconceivable, because we have no evidence to base the existence 
of these other universes at all! So these other universes do not exist 
(according to our current evidence), and so we would have nothing to write 
about. Therefore, this paragraph, in actuality, should not exist, and therefore 
does not exist, by the rule that anything that should not exist does not exist! 
It must be great to be a loser living a paradox, because this very paragraph 
that you are currently reading does not exist!!! The rule that anything that 
should not exist does not exist also does not exist because it was first 
conceived in this paragraph, and therefore is a paradox and does not exist 
because of the fact that this paragraph itself is a paradox. (Whoah, a double 
paradox! They don't suck, by the way.)

This paradox we have illustrated above is slightly akin to a few well known 
paradoxes, such as the one about the chicken and the egg, or this famous 
paradox;

The following sentence is false.
The preceding sentence is true.

(We shall leave you to figure the paradoxic complications of this problem by 
yourself, when you are by yourself, alone, while all the non-sucky people are 
out, together, doing non-sucky things and activities, together.)

At this time, we would like to provide you with the address we 
alluded to earlier in this rant. That address is:

KuNT Industries, Limited
1874 KuNT Drive
Podunk, WI 84756

Please address all letters, hate mail, letterbombs, and parcels full of 
anything from money to cashable checks to dog shit to unidentified amputated 
male body parts to unidentified decomposing amputated body parts of human 
beings to carded computer hardware to pirated computer software to stolen CDs 
to stolen cassettes to stolen various forms of interactive/non-interactive 
media (no disco, please) to stolen video games and/or video game systems to 
legal documents (please provide a lawyer in a separate parcel, so that I can 
have him/her/it peruse the aforementioned legal documents) to magazines to 
books to clothes to dirty clothes to condoms to used condoms to pens, pencils 
and other writing utensils to KuNT. (Please address any other parcels of 
any content not included in the above list to 'Return to Sender'. Please 
substitute a blank space for the address of the house, make the name of the 
addressee (i.e. 'Return to Sender') quite large, and remember to put your 
current name and address in the upper left hand corner of the parcel.)

Now, we bet your sucky little brain is doing somersaults about why we would 
provide our address to you. We provide our address here so in the extremely 
probable scenario of you waking up and smelling the sucky coffee (you aren't 
important enough to warrant non-sucky coffee) and realizing that we am the 
supreme, non-sucky masters of everything, and that you will wish to pay homage 
to us and donate large portions of material and non-material wealth to us, so 
that we can use it to further the cause of non-sucky people (us, for instance). 
However we don't mean to imply that you possess large portions of material or 
non-material wealth, because we're acting on the highly probable assumption 
that you will have already spent it on other extremely sucky things and 
possessions.

ATTENTION: If you have been previously identified as non-sucky, you may 
disregard that last paragraph as an attempt to scare any sucky beings reading 
this into submission where they can serve the non-sucky beings of existence as 
(extremely) cheap and (extremely) sucky slave labor. 

So, we think that a rant of this length should be enough to satisfy any 
curiousities you may have that delve into the many reasons of why you suck. If 
more clarity is needed in this matter, please feel free to ask anyone around 
you that is non-sucky for further revelations and/or clarification.

KuNT Infiltrates Everything

Well, since the first issue of KuNT came out, the entire world has been 
abuzz.  People are copying us left and right.  Much to our surprise, one 
of our BIGGEST imitators has been the mainstream media!

What, you cry?  Nonsense, you scoff?  Ha, unbeliever, I have PROOF.

1.  Look at radio and TV stations.  Notice how many of them start with K,
followed by three other letters?  KOMA, KQKQ, KROQ, etc.!  Hmmmm...

2.  As we here at KuNT are both feared and worshipped, so too has the
bastardized word "cunt" found its way into the English language, indicating
ANOTHER thing that is both feared and worshipped.  Hmmmm...

3.  [Removed, Ed., -><- FNORD]

Now you see the TRUTH, that we at KuNT are omnipresent and that there is NO
ESCAPE from our grasp!

The best you can hope for now is a quick death.

Social Engineering for Fun and Profit

Okay, so ya want th' newest, latest, most bad-ass machine to do your LEET
H4X0R1NG on, right?  Sure, we all do!  Strapped for cash, cause you spent
it all on herbal E and Robitussin?  Yup, testify, my brother!  Well have no
fear, because we here at KuNT have come up with a FOOLPROOF scheme to raise
money!  Yes, that's right, FOOLPROOF!  It's guaranteed to work!  Here's how
it works.

You use the art of Social Engineering.  That means that through cleverly
choosing your words and attitude, you can make people believe that you are
someone you're not, you can make them give you things, you can make them do
things they wouldn't do otherwise, etc.  In this primer, we'll show you
how.  Now, I know, you've all read social engineering files before, or
already know how to do it, but just wait.  This is a NEW kind of Social
Engineering.  Social Engineering at its FINEST.  It's fast, it's direct,
it's to the point, but it still has all the flair and effectiveness of
previous approaches to the time-honored tradition.  KuNT-Style Social
Engineering!

Let's say you have $2 to your name.  A pittance, considering that soon
you'll have enough to afford the Pentium MegaWhompus 9000, with all the
peripherals you'll ever need.

Take the $2 to the nearest Coke machine.  Make change.  Now, if you're
TRULY 'leet, you'll get a coke and change and your dollar back, but that's
another story.

Now take this change and go down to the bus stop.  Since you got the
change, you're ready for whatever the fare happens to be.  Take the bus to
the shitty part of town.  Now, what you want to do is find a park.  If
there's not a park, find the place where all the lonely old people hang
out.  Sit there for a while, until you see some old-ass man or woman
walking their dog or feeding the pigeons or something.

Strike up a conversation.  Ask them about their grandchildren.  Talk about
the war.  Anything.  Just don't tell them your real name.  And you gotta 
act INTERESTED, too.  Can't just sit there and go "Mmmm, mm-hm.  Yeah." and 
yawn all the time.  Remember, the key is to make them TRUST you.  When they 
start to leave, the fun begins.

Ask them if, since you're so far from home, you can use their phone to call
your parents for a ride.  If you've done a REALLY good job with your social
engineering, they'll let you.

When you go into their apartment, don't look around.  That'll just scare
them.  Politely ask where the phone is, and use it.  Try not to leave
fingerprints.  Call time and temperature, or dial-a-joke, or some local
recording of something.  Anything.  Chances are that they'll stand there
and watch you.  If they do, make it a long call.  Remember to act like
you're talking to your parents.  Ask the old bastard his address, or if
there's a Stop-N-Rob on the corner, ask him what corner it is.  Make it
seem realistic.

After you hang up the phone is where the social engineering REALLY comes
into play.  As soon as their back is turned, punch them as hard as you can,
right in the neck.  Now, loot their apartment.  Dump everything out, but DO
NOT take things.  Just cash.  When you are done, to make the scam that much
sweeter, wake them up by throwing water on them or something, and thank
them for a lovely time.

Repeat this a few times a day for a week, and you'll be rolling in new
equipment!

See how that works?  By being NICE to them, you make them trust you, and
give you their money, something they would NEVER do without outside (i.e. 
YOUR) influence!  By applying these principles, you can, with a little 
practice, get nearly ANYTHING from ANYBODY!

And remember to say "THANX, KuNT!"
