AN INTRODUCTION FRUM THA D1G1S4UR

SaTaNuS is busy, so I get to do the intro this time.  w00t.

Welcome to the special holiday issue of KuNT.  Originally this was intended to
be the Christmas issue.  However, seeing as we were a bit too busy getting laid
at the annual KuNT Xmas party, we didn't get much writing done before the 
big day.  And New Years...well, you know how big-titted chicks get when they're
in the presense of a master hacker on New Years Eve...

[AT THIS POINT IN THE TEXT FILE, D1G1S4UR'S DOSE OF DEXTROMETHORPHAN KICKS IN,
 THUS CAUSING HIS WRITING TO BECOME INCREDIBLY BAD. YES, WORSE THAN WHAT HE
 HAS WROTE SO FAR. SO SATANUS MAXIMUS EXERCISED vi's ELITE dd COMMAND AND
 NUKED THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF THE ANGSTBOY BABBLE. THANK YOU.]

Anyways, it's time for the table of contents, you latte-swilling fuckhead.

Attention -- For Immediate Release -- Attention

             KuNT Security Advisory

      Title: Vulnerabilities in netsex(8), /dev/pussy
      Date : January 18, 1997

Attention -- For Immediate Release -- Attention

Abstract:

KuNT has recently discovered a serious flaw in the implementation of 
/dev/pussy, which may lead to unauthorized system access and/or use. This 
announcement affects all users of any flavor of UN*X which may have installed 
the netsex(8) package, available from:

<http://www.kalifornia.com/~nexusfags/netsex.1.0.tgz>.

Explaination:

The particular flaw in /dev/pussy is related to its menstrual flows, related 
to buffer overflows, which a common way for intruders to gain access to a 
system. An example of this technique would be the various exploits which 
are available for sendmaild (various releases). 

Another similarly related shortcoming in /dev/pussy is its ability to be 
penetrated by another part of the netsex(8) distribution, /dev/penis. The 
very first time this particular attack to gain access through the /dev/penis 
penetration attack, there is a very high chance that it will cause a rupture 
of hymem.sys, causing a panic, and making blood run all over the place.

In addition, it has been reported from many different sites that frequently 
have /dev/pussy installed that unexplainable system errors occur approximately 
once per month. These have been affectionately dubbed 'PMS Attacks'. Users 
may expect to see random processes killed, the kernel unwilling to allocate 
space in the process table (thus disallowing new processes from being run), 
and in rare cases, a full kernel panic and system halt.

Solutions:

KuNT recommends the following steps to alleviate the threat posed by the 
netsex(8) distribution.

It is advised that a professional crisis team be called in to remove /dev/pussy 
and /dev/penis from your system, if affected. If such a team is unreachable 
through your means, we have placed a utility on warez.phantom.com/pub/faget 
that will remove /dev/penis from your system. This utilty can be downloaded 
as:

ftp://warez.phantom.com/pub/faget/castrate.1.0.tar.gz

As for the removal of /dev/pussy, we are only able to publically provide at 
this time a group of utilties that will alleviate the problem. These can be 
downloaded as:

ftp://warez.phantom.com/pub/faget/tampon.1.0.tar.gz
ftp://warez.phantom.com/pub/faget/midol.1.0.tar.gz

These daemons, when installed, should remove most of the threat posed by 
/dev/pu ssy, especially from nasty 'PMS Attacks'.

KuNT Industriez, Limited presents...


                          A KuNT FAMILY THANXGIVING

SCENE:  Thanksgiving day, dinner time, at the KuNT family household.

Mother comes in, and sets down a small table.  She puts a sign on top of the
table.  Sign reads:

                               SOBER KIDS' TABLE

Mother:(to people in living room)  Boys, time for dinner!
Father:  Dammit, hold on!  We're still watching the football game!
Mother:  I don't give a shit!  Get your ass in here!
Father:  Fuck you, whore!
Mother:  If you don't get your ass in here THIS FUCKING SECOND, I'm going to
         donate your good bong to charity!
Father:  YOU WOULDN'T FUCKING DARE!
Mother:  YOU KNOW I FUCKING WOULD!

Slight pause, then father finally beckons the rest of the living room into the
dining room.  Slowly a family gathers around the tables.

Cousin Richard:  Why the FUCK do I have to sit at the sober kids' table?  I just
                 smoked a fucking joint out there!
Father:  You fucking COUGHED, bitch!
Cousin Richard:  I have a fucking cold!
Father:  You heard me, bitch!  SIT YOUR ASS DOWN.

Mother goes into kitchen, and comes out carrying a blackened turkey.  Smoke 
fills the dining room.  Mother sets turkey down in the center of the larger
table.

Cousin Joey:  Come on, guys, let's say grace!
Father:  TAKE IT OUTSIDE, GODBOY!
Cousin Joey:  We must show proper worship to the Lord!
Uncle Bruce:  Lord?  FUCK THAT SHIT!  LET'S WORSHIP SATAN!
Cousin Susie:(wearing a NIN shirt)  Better yet, let's worship Trent!  Mmmm!
Little Billy:  Hey Baby, I'm all the God of Fuck you'll *ever* need!

Little Billy throws Susie onto the sober kids' table, and begins tearing her
clothes off.  Both parties begin moaning passionately.

Bob:(at sober kids' table)  MAAAAAA!  MIRANDA THREW POTATOES AT ME!!!!!
Mother:  CUT IT THE FUCK OUT, KIDS!
Miranda:  EWWWWW!!!!  BOB'S THROWING PEZ AT ME!
Mother:  I SAID SHUT UP!!!
Miranda:  YOU HEARD HER, SHE SAID STOP!
Bob:  SHE MEANT FOR YOU TO STOP!
Miranda:  STOPPIT!
Bob:  YOU!
Miranda: WAAAA!!!
Bob:  CRY BABY!
Miranda:(after kicking Bob in the nutsac)  FUCKER!
Mother:  I SAID FUCKING SHUT UP YOU LITTLE BRATS!

Grandma grabs an M-16 and fires a round of warning shots into the air.  Pieces
of plaster from the ceiling fall into the stuffing.  Little kids quiet up.

Mother:  BOB!  DON'T FEED THE TURKEY TO THE DOG!  DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH HASH I
         STUFFED INTO THAT THING???
Cat:  Weom!
Uncle Bruce:(after kicking cat)  FUCKHEAD!
Father:  OH DAMMIT JIM, YOU GOT THE CAT STONED AGAIN, DIDN'T YA?
Jim:  IT'S NOT MY FAULT THE FUCKER ATE MY STASH!
Father:  IT SHOWS WHAT YOU GET FOR LEAVING YOUR STASH WHERE THE CAT CAN GET TO
         IT!  DON'T YOU FUCKING KIDS KNOW *ANYTHING* ABOUT HIDING A STASH THESE
         DAYS?

Various family members break off crunchy pieces of turkey, and spit them out.

Uncle Bruce:  THIS TURKEY FUCKING SUCKS!  WHERE THE *FUCK* DID YOU LEARN TO 
              COOK?
Mother:  IT'S NOT MY FUCKING FAULT THAT MY HUSBAND WOULDN'T PAY FOR THE COOKING
         LESSONS I ALWAYS ASKED FOR!
Father:  SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Little Janey:  MOMMY, IS IT BAD THAT GRANPA'S NOT MOVING?
Father:  OH SHIT, THE OLD MAN WENT AND DIED ON ME!  HE *NEVER* LETS *ME* HAVE
         SPOTLIGHT, EVEN WHEN WE HAVE THANKSGIVING AT *MY* HOUSE!  HE CAN'T LET
         ME HAVE *MY* FUCKING DAY!  WELL, FUCK YOU, GRANDPA, *YOU'RE* THE TURKEY
         NOW!
Cousin Joey:  What?
Father:  PASS ME THE FUCKING CARVING KNIFE!
Mother:  You're not suggesting we *eat* Grandpa, are you?
Father:  DAMN RIGHT I AM!

Father begins cutting up Grandpa, and passes a small piece to each member of the
family.  Everyone slowly takes a first bite, and have a curious look on their 
face as they consider the taste.  Suddenly, everyone enthusiasticly eats the 
rest of what's on their plate.

Uncle Bruce:  Wow, this stuff is good.  Kinda a tangy taste, but not *too* 
              tangy.
Jim:(To Julie)  Sister dearest, can you pass me a piece of Grandpa's thigh?
Julie:(to Jim)  Why sure, brother, as soon as i finish with his scrotum.

THE FUCKING END

End the Holiday Madness


Anyone with half a brain hates the Thanksgiving to Christmas season.
There is too much family.  Too many happy annoying people demanding
things from you.  Too much forced joy specials on television.  And WAY
too many repetitions of songs you've been listening to since childhood.
Anything Kathie Lee Gifford espouses must, by definition, be evil.

The only way to escape this recurring nightmare is to: 

  1. Stick your head in the turkey just after it comes out of the oven,
     preferrably during the Christmas Day (TM) family gathering, but a
     Thanksgiving Day (TM) end may also serve your purposes.  Your timing
     really depends on your own peculiar circumstances. 

  2. Run around banging into family members all the while flailing
     your arms.  You can never go wrong flailing your arms when trying
     to kill yourself.  The more flailing the better. 

  3. Go into a room that can be easily locked so you won't be accidentally
     saved by well meaning but inconsiderate friends or family members.
    
     [Alternatively you can just flee the house and run through the streets
      aimlessly until you pass out.  NO ONE in a large city will ever go near
      someone with a steaming turkey on his head.  If you live in a wooded
      or rural area the best thing to do would be to run off into the
      wilderness so your body can be found with all sorts of gnaw marks on it
      from the multitude of animals that will flock to your decaying carcass
      (and the turkey's, too).] 

  4. An interesting footnote to this holiday might be to swallow a large number
     of Christmas ornaments (lights, small Santa dolls, actual fruit cake)
     before you follow your bliss.  Give your family and friends (if you
     have either) something to discuss the following year.

Mrs. Leach, I hate to burst your righteous bubble, but see, in my spare
time I study to be a TV evangelist.  It's a correspondence school --
Catechism Ray Tube, Inc. -- and one of the best.  Applying the lessons that
I've learned, tonight I attempted to shoot the shit with Our Lord and
Savior.  (Lesson 3: Talking To The Lawd.  Wait, no.  Lesson 3 is Where To
Find Pastel-Colored Suits.  I mean Lesson 4.)  You'll be disappointed to
hear what He said.

Me: Jeeeeesus!  Jeeeeeeesus!
Jesus: Allright already, I hear you.
Me: Praise be!  Praaaaaaaaaze be!
Jesus: Out with it. I've got a zillion calls on hold.
Me: Sorry.  It's my first time.
Jesus: Kid, your ears plugged? I'm busy as hell.
Me: Pardon me.
Jesus: Well, let's see what you do over the next 30 years,
           and I'll think about it.
Me: No, I mean, Lord, I've got a question.
Jesus: You came to the right place, me bucko.
Me: Lord, in your divine wisdom, I beg of You an answer.
Jesus: Whaddya want?   
Me: I wand to know...Is it true that You have blessed AOL?
Jesus: Bwahahahaha!
Me: Lord?
Jesus: Bwahahahaha!
Me: I don't unders--
Jesus: (in background) Hey, St. Peter! Pick up line 
           one. Got a live one here!
Me: I knew it wasn't true.  Fuck all!
Jesus: Ok, that's a demerit right there, kid.  Watch yer
            tongue or I might just set it on fire. Then
            I'll take yer wife and turn her into a pillar of salt.
            Then I'll send a plague of locusts followed by a
            million posts from former AOL censor Adam 
            Bailey to your favorite newsgroup.
Me: No!  Please!  I'm sorry!
Jesus: Hey, forget it.  I was just razzing ya.
Me: So, the AOL thing -- there's no special compensation
       from your office, right?
Jesus: Nope.
Me: Then can you tell me how AOL manages to keep 
       afloat despite all its screw-ups?
Jesus: Look. I don't run the only protection racket in 
           the cosmos, you know.  The guy you want to talk
           to is in the other place.
Me: You mean....
Jesus: Mr. Pointy Head. The Bad Ass with a Pitchfork. The
           Dark Dude. The Crispy One. Or, as we like to call
           him around here...SaTaNuS MaXiMuS.
Me: No!
Jesus: 'Fraid so, kid. AOL is in hock to the Horny Itemizer
           like you wouldn't believe.
Me: For what, souls?
Jesus: Souls, stock -- other convertible assets.
Me: Everyone, or just the top brass?
Jesus: Ah, it's a long list. I'll tell ya right now -- Case, Leonsis,
          Pittman, they're all going to hell. Most of the middle
          managers, same thing -- hell. The Guides, the Remote
          Staff, I haven't decided. Some hell, some purgatory.
Me: There's really a purgatory?
Jesus: Obviously you haven't tried signing onto AOL lately.
Me: Lord, one last thing. Am I going to heaven?
Jesus: Sure, whatever, baby. 

After receiving these startling revelations, I tried to confirm the most
shocking of them all with the CEO of Hell himself, Lucifer. For this task,
I followed the e-z instructions in AOL's Terms of Service: I constructed a
pentagram out of AOL bisks, sacrificed a goat in the center, and then read
the latest Community Update from Steve Case aloud and backwards.  Presto!
I was instantly in communication with a demon.

Me: Where's the Devil?
Demon: The Devil has gone home for the day. I can help you, sir.
Me: Is it true that you guys have a sweet deal with AOL?
Demon: Absolutely true.  They're some of our best customers.
Me: Are they all going to hell then?
Demon: One day, certainly.
Me: What if Steve Case changed his mind?
Demon: I wouldn't worry about that, sir. He's fucked.

So, Mrs. Leach, I think these Holy and Infernal chats are pretty
conclusive.  There's no time for you to lose.  AOL is party to a pact that
leads to eternal damnation, and if you have any sense you'll move your
"Christian Womens League" off of it pronto before you're all swallowed up
by a flaming pit and used by demons for unsafe sex for the rest of
eternity.  Get on the Information SuperHolyHighway, dear lady of God, if
you have any hope of dying a virgin!

  Exploiting Buildings. You think rdist is the only thing out there to hack?

Ok, we *all* know that diners are a staple of American society. Think 
about it. People of all classes and nationalities around the U.S. go to 
diners to eat, socialize, get drunk, and even to work there. If the 
diners of the United States went out of business, where would there be a 
cheap but filling place to go to breakfast/lunch/dinner/for a snack, that 
wasn't sleazy like normal fast food joints? America would COLLAPSE.

It is this 'foundation' that this article will attempt to teach you 
about, and how to use them in a manner that would benefit yourself and 
your friends.

                        ---FREE FOOD AND CASH---

This is the almost too obvious part of exploiting diners today. By going 
into a diner and ordering something trivial, like a coke, an unlimited 
supply of food is available. How, you ask? It's simple.

What you will need is a large coat (a trenchcoat will do), and a lot of 
plastic bags. These can be either Ziploc or a larger kind. Now, find a 
diner that either has a buffet or a salad bar. Just fill the friggin bags 
up when nobody is looking. Real simple. Easy. Fast. And the quality of 
food is generally higher in diners than, say, Mickey D's. This trick can 
provide you with food for days on end, if planned an executed carefully.

You will also notice during your visits to the diner that many stupid 
people leave money on the table and leave. We're not quite sure WHY they 
do this, or HOW this practice even started. (KuNT theorizes that it is a 
modern-day form of a sacrifice to a pagan god or goddess, in an effort 
for the person or persons leaving the cash to do better at work, at home, 
or somewhere in their lives. A white paper detailing this research will 
be available shortly.) We do not care about incurring the wrath of any 
deities; everyone knows there ain't no such thing as GOD. Pshaw. Like 
that would ever happen. You think there would be war, famine, disease, 
hatred, pr0n, and all that other cool stuff if there was GOD? I didn't 
THINK so. Sorry, got off the topic. Anyway, just take the cash, and be 
happy that you are slightly richer.

               ---DINERS AS REVOLUTIONARY MEETING PLACES---

Diners are not usually thought of as a place for the disgruntled of 
today to meet. But they are perfect. Nobody cares about a bunch of people 
chatting in the corner, apparently having a good time. However, the usual 
tactic of just going into a public place, such as a park, with 
sunglasses, fake noses, and the like, just isn't as inconspicious as it 
used to be. But diners are indeed great places to go. Take, for instance, 
the ability to switch on the 'jukebox' by your table in an attempt to 
prevent others from hearing your conversations. It's almost as good as a 
room with walls 10 feet thick that has been checked for wiretaps and 
bugs. Well, almost. Fuck off. The ability to purchase food and plan 
revolutionary actions for hours without drawing attention to yourself is 
simply outstanding.

In a pinch, a diner packed with the dinner crowd can work wonders as a 
negotiation pawn. The many hostages can be a plus while negotiating for 
your fellow political prisoner brothers and sisters inside the prison 
system. Considering that Al Sharpton himself is known to frequent a diner 
near this author's house, it can be definitely said that hostage taking 
would be a definite plus to any revolutionary group.

                        ---DINERS ARE FUN!---

The kids bored today? Been to Disneyland ONE too many times? Look NO 
further than your local diner! There is much fun to be had, and it is of 
such low maturity that kids will simply LOVE it. Fun activities that can 
be planned for the family during the day trip to the diner include:

o FOOD FIGHT! -- This takes many different forms. The first thing to do
                 is to GRAB SOME FOOD. Order it. Get a salad. Get those
                 bottles of ketchup and packets of sugar. Grab it all!
                 Then, as a coordinated move, all members of the family 
                 should turn around and plop whatever they have on a random
                 person near them. (NOTE: the target can be a family 
                 member, but it doesn't have to be.) Continue throwing food
                 until you have the whole diner embroiled in war. Sit back,
                 and laugh. A lot.

o THE REGISTER -- Run to the register. Open it. Don't worry if there are
                  people watching you, or at the register, or even using
                  the register. Just take the fucken cash. If people try
                  to stop you, throw those little after-dinner mints at
                  them. Or the candy behind the counter. Hell, if you just
                  want to have fun, throw the goddam money at them!
                  
o THE SOUND OF MUSIC -- This requires research. You will need to find the
                        main stereo system for the diner. (The one that all
                        the 'jukeboxes' at the tables control.) Find out
                        what format music that it takes, and bring music on
                        that format to the diner. The trick is, bring music
                        that is generally annoying to most people. This
                        includes such popular bands as NIN, Marilyn Manson,
                        and the groups that sing the songs that go 'THE 
                        ROOF, THE ROOF, THE ROOF IS ON FIRE' and 'HE'S 
                        GOING THE DISTANCE! HE'S GOING FOR SPEED!'. Those 
                        songs suck and are annoying. So play them. a lot.
                        
o RIIIIDE THE FERRIS WHEEL! -- This works best after a food fight. (See
                               above for details.) When the floor is so
                               sticky, gooey, slimy, and slippery, just
                               slide around on it. Do it on your ass,
                               on your side, even on your head. Pull
                               people that dressed up in decent clothing
                               in with you, too! They'll be happy you
                               showed them the delights of the diner!
                               
In conclusion, diners RONK. You can do so many things in them. Feel free
to send KuNT your ideas and experiences concerning how you have fun in 
diners, as well. Maybe we'll get them in an upcoming issue. As some corny
guy in some corny western movie once said:

                      "I'll make ya famous."
                     
HTH. FOAD. HAND.

Book: System Adminstrator's Manual
Section: Chapter 23 -- I Have Just Been Hacked, What Do I Do Now?
Authors: Horowanks et al
Publisher: Protoscum Corporation
Characteristics: Cover features an ostrich sticking its head into the sand
Common Names: The Ostrich Book

Abstract:

This chapter is typical of the entire book. It gives excellent advice to
system administrators who are forced to deal with the problem of an unwanted
hacker intrusion. The narrative style is unique, at times told like a story,
at times a dialogue, at times an instruction manual, yet always good advice.

This book is useful to all sysadmins, be they seasoned UNIX console jockeys
or newly-established Linux admins. The problems are pressing in the current
cyber-society.

Excerpts:

Shit! Sound the alarm! Batten down the hatches! We've been HACKASAURED!!!

"How do you know?"

"Well, someone changed our file, uhm, the, uh, file, that...uhm...they show 
when someone, uh...logs in?"

"The message of the day file?"

"By God, you're right, Richard!"

"Well let's have a look at it, shall we?"

Richard begins typing at the console, which is in single user mode for
system maintenance:

# cat /etc/motd

            _____                                          KuNT

#

"Jumpin' Jehosaphat! We HAVE been hackasaured! You, uh, go home, get some
sleep, I'll take care of this."

Richard sidles into the saddle. The warmth of the console operator's chair,
an honor reserved only for him! Like Kirk with his captain's chair, no one
else had this opportunity. And now someone dare tresspass onto his system?
Never! He will find the miscreant!

# w

root     co  console           7:01PM     0 w

"Jesus Christ." 

In this stunned moment, a small, yet putrid fart escapes from within Richard's
bowels. He looks around sheepishly for a moment, then realizes he is alone.
He smiles contentedly.

"It's my chair, IT DOESN'T MATTER! I FART WHERE I WANT! Oh yeah, what was I 
doing? OH JEEZ, THE HACKERS!"

# REM okay, gotta catch the hackerz now
REM: not found

"Damn. Well, I need some kind of temporary account so I can see if I can
hack into the system, and figure out how they did it."

# cd /home; mkdir "Bob's home directory"
# echo "Bob Simon:gandalf:0:0::/dev/tty:compress -f" > /etc/passwd

"There we go! I better remember not to bill myself for this account!"

Two sitez, both alike in dignity,
In fair ARPANET where we lay our scene,
From ancient grude break to new mutiny,
Where KouRieR blood makes KouRieR hands unclean.
From forth the fatal bandwidth of these two foes,
A pair of narc'd on KouRieRZ pay the price;
Whose misadventured piteous o'erthrows
Doth with their death chill their heels on ice.
The fearful passage of their fed-watched trades,
And the continuance of J. Edgar's watching eye,
Which, but their sentencing come, draw the shades,
Is now sent away in prep to die.
The which if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, KuNT shall strive to mend.

[Now imagine lotsa warez. I mean a lot of warez. I mean a motherlode of
 warez. I mean a dog-chokin motherlode. I mean a motherlode bigger than
 Kim Gordon's veins. See? It was a lot of fucking warez. But you're not
 elite enough for our warez. Our warez are 0-day. You aren't. Fuck you.]

At this time, the members of KuNT would like to claim responsibilty for 
rigging the recent NFL championship, also known as the Super Bowl. It is 
our intention to continue towards our goal of screwing things up and 
laughing while we watch the chaos, and so we would also at this time like 
to announce plans to rig the Stanley Cup Playoffs, the World Series, and 
the voting process for the Undernet IRC Network's Routing Committee. 
Watch for more developments in the future.

But anyhow, yeah, we fucked the Super Bowl up good. You didn't even 
notice, eh? That was the plan all along. See, we believe that if we can 
screw with things royally, and end up having everyone else believe that 
it was meant to be that way.. well.. it's just better. Trust us. By the 
way, you're all a bunch of stupid shits. Just because we felt like saying so.

Did you REALLY believe that Green Bay was supposed to win? By themselves? 
WITHOUT THE HELP OF KuNT?! Yeah, suuuuure they would have. We would like 
to reveal, at this time, that a representative from the football 
organization known as the Green Bay Packers approached KuNT on or about 
December 23rd, 1996. Their represenative, who shall be known as Damien 
Finkleberry Hopkins III (hey, that's what HE called himself, ok?), told 
us that Green Bay had already made deals on the side with many other 
teams in the NFL, in the interest of getting to and winning the Super 
Bowl. But they needed help from those wacky masters of social disorder 
and KuNT!

They had mathematically calculated on their state of the art IBM PCjr 
that Green Bay, would in fact, be pitted against the New England Patriots 
in the upcoming championship. The problem was, the Patriots were 
protected by a number of things that allowed them to see through the 
lies, greed, and ambition of the Packers. These protective items and 
attributes were identified by KuNT to be: a half eaten Nestle's Crunch 
bar named Figaro, a model truck molded from clay with the letters 
'PENISTRUCK' on the side, a rubber high-bouncing bouncy ball (the kind 
found in vending machines at supermarkets), 37 cents in assorted change, 
and one very grainy copy of the movie 'The Muppets Take Manhattan'. It is 
still uncertain, even to the geniuses of KuNT, how these items managed to 
make negotiations between the two teams difficult. (Rest assured that we 
are actively working on the problem, and will report on it as soon as we 
find out whether or not Agent Sculley will get naked in an upcoming porn 
movie, The XXX-Files.)

KuNT was paid a reasonable fee for services required of us. This fee 
amounted to 15 cents for each member of KuNT, and 3 bottles of Barq's 
Root Beer. All of us sat around and wondered, "So, how the hell are we 
going to do this?" We decided that the best solution would be to go into 
the Patriot's locker room before the big game and kill them all with a 
few guns and lots of bad jokes. This seemed like a decent plan, so on a 
cold January day, we all sprouted wings and flew over to the Patriot's 
locker room. On the way, however, we managed to drop our guns and forget 
most of our bad jokes, so we ended up standing around and watching the 
first quarter of the game. (Incidentially, we did purchase a few hot dogs 
and stuff like that. Flying takes a lot out of you, y'see. We were 
starved.) After a few minutes, however, we remembered that we kind of had 
a job to do. Sort of. Yeah, actually, we did. Anyway, we knew we had to 
come up with something fast. Something brilliant. And so we trotted down 
to the local hardware store and bought a few containers of oil. Upon 
returning to the stadium, it was almost half time, and we had to work 
fast. Well, to make a long story short, we sprayed the locker room floor 
with copious amounts of oil. 

And then we waited. And waited. And waited a bit more. A few screams and 
groans were heard from the locker room, so we went to check it out. And, 
to our COMPLETE surprise, every member of the New England Patriots was on 
the floor, moaning in pain and confusion. We were kind of at a loss at 
that point, because now that we had quite a few large, strong, and 
menacing men lying on the ground, we didnt know what the fuck to do with 
them. It was decided at that point in time that we would have to do 
something we had never tried on so many people in one small room with 
only a short bit of time to do it in.

We did the TOP-SECRET KuNT MIND CONTROL AND HYPNOSIS TRICK.

For those that may not understand what that may mean, it is a complicated 
process shrouded in mystery, even to certain members of KuNT. (Except the 
Supreme High Commanders and the Chinese Food Delivery Boy, of course.) We 
won't tell you how we did it. We'll just tell you that we DID do it. And 
you'll just have to believe us. (Ok ok ok, it involves many packs of Oreo 
cookies, whipped cream, whips, a half-dozen wrought-iron Punisher(tm) 
Dildos with Shock Enhancements and Added Spikes, a copy of the album 
'Twelve Inches of Snow' by Snow, and some secret techniques only KuNT 
knows about. There you go. Try figuring it out by practicing on your 
friends, relatives, enemies, pets, co-workers, and even Art Stone. But we 
have the feeling that Art actually likes the bit with the shocking 
dildos. So your results may vary.)

We wormed our way into each player's subconscious mind, and told them 
that they were going to lose. No matter how hard they tried. It was 
impossible. Because they sucked. And if they did manage to win, we made 
it excrutiatingly clear that we WOULD trigger the dumb but powerful KuNT 
SEKRET WEPHUN and destroy the entire planet. (Hey, what do we care about 
this stupid place? KuNT has a fucking spaceship. We fucking fly around in 
it. IN SPACE. HUNTING DOWN STRANGE AND NEW LIFEFORMS. TO BOLDLY GO WHERE 
NOBODY HAS GONE BEFORE, AND WE AREN'T TALKING ABOUT SOME VIRGIN'S TIGHT 
LITTLE YOU-KNOW-WHAT. Well, maybe we are. Just listen to the damn story, 
ok? Fucking insolent bastards.)

The team went back out onto the field. And lost. We smiled silently as 
the victory celebrations went on, and left unnoticed by anyone. We had 
done our job. And we did it well. So well, in fact, that we took the 
spare items that we used in mindcontrolling the team and went down to 
Hooters. And mindcontrolled a few chicks. For a night of fun. Woo.

Some questions that you may want answers to may include, 'Just what is 
the KuNT SEKRET WEPHUN?', and also the ever popular, 'But don't those 
people you mind-controlled remember that you did so, and so why didn't 
they go to the cops?'

Well, we'll TELL YOU.

The KuNT SEKRET WEPHUN is, in fact, lying dormant in a person somewhere 
on earth at this moment. It waits for the command given by us, and when 
it receives this command, it will strike terror into the hearts of 
humans. And probably kill a lot of people, but we don't really care. So 
that's the SEKRET WEPHUN. Hope you're happy, now that you know.

And, no, the people we mind-control never remember. Even under hypnosis 
or whatever the fuck they do these days. They believe that they were 
acting under their own accord. And that's all they will ever know.

Some people may discount this statement, concerning our admission to 
rigging the Super Bowl. But that's ok. We wouldn't do it if it wasn't for 
stupid schmucks like you that cannot possibly realize how much smarter we 
are than all of you. I mean, we're so smart, we named ourselves the best 
goddam name for a terrorist group/organization there is. KuNT. Yeah. 
That's why we're smart. Really.

That's it. Go the fuck away. We're off to blow up the Eiffel Tower or 
something. The French are so rude to everyone, so we are going to teach 
them a lesson and make them do that french laugh all the guys do over 
there. It goes 'HOH HOH HOH' really nasally. But you knew what we were 
talking about. So anyhow go away. Bye.

ok this is how you are supposed to really hack because only lame people
actually need to use computers to break into another computer

what you have to do is this
you need to get to the computer you want to hack -- this is the easy part
then you need to take the hard drive out and stuff from the inside of the
computer
once you have the hard drive out you need to open it up so you can see the
little disks inside. they are cute eh? i like them because they look all 
pretty and stuff

ok now you need to take your finger and almost touch the disk and you have
to feel for the magnetic thing that the computer puts on the disks so it
stores the data and stuff like that

once you can feel the magnetic of the disk you can read what is on the disk
-- it is lots of fun -- once you get really advanced at this you can run
your finger over a place on the disk where a pr0no picture is and you can
SEE IT IN YOUR MIND it is a lot of fun and impresses the chicks and you can
even do it if you are in high school and want to pass the time in a boring
class -- just whip out the disk and look at pr0n

once you are done just put the disk back inside the computer and it will be
ok.

also you can do this with cd roms because they have little bumps and stuff
on the cd -- you just need to look really hard and you will see lots of
little bumps and holes and stuff.. just try to figure it out and decode it
in your mind because it is harder than just feeling a magnet on a hard drive

when you get really good at this kind of thing you can start training to
write to a disk and record data there. first thing you need to do however is
train your finger (or whatever you want to write with, like your nose or ear
or penis or clit if you are a hacker chick) to be able to give off magnetic
fields -- the way i did this is i took a magnet and ran it over my finger a
lot -- like for about a year. and then i was soon able to pick stuff up with
my finger, like i would walk down the street and cars would pass me, and
sometimes they are assholes and almost run me over so i wiggle my finger at
them and their car goes all weird and gets into an accident because i used
my finger to magnetically move the car. it is fun. it is almost like magic.

man that is deep so anyhow once you can do that you dont need to do dumb 
or stupid things like write stuff down  because you can record it on spoons,
keys or something, like a spoon. you will never not have a thing to write 
in/on because there is so much metal stuff around and it is easy to find.

later on when you are really cool you will want to try to plug yourself into
a network of computers -- this is very hard and not many people can actually
do it. what you need to do is find a place where you can stick part of your
body into a network. like your finger. but not the same finger that you can
do magnetic stuff with because it is silly. and because i say so. you will
need to do this for a long time so you can interpret the data coming in
through the place where you are plugged into the network. it can get tricky
at times because it all happens so fast. but thats ok because you are elite,
right? and everyone that is elite can do cool things like pirate k-rad warez
and hack the planet like they did in that really cool movie called.. fuck i
dont remember what it was called i think it was 'Slacker' or something..
remember they went and hacked a gibson (i have a gibson in my room) and went
to new york city and hacked some grand train station? and there was
something about oil ships and this guy named joey that was really lame. i
thought it was funny and true because all hackers are like that. really. we
are all cool with cool names like ZeroCool and AcidBurn and even Da Chronic
or Puck (that is very original because nobody likes The Real World except
for real hackers like Puck because they are elite) or Optik (because a lot
of people want to be like Phiber Optik too) but this is kind of off the
topic because i was supposed to tell you how to hack without a computer.

ok so you have your finger in this network hub or transciever or maybe you
are even just biting on one end of a cable that is plugged in somewhere
important. you need to put a battery in your ear so you can make electricity
(or you can brush your hair and get a lot of static because it is fun i like
hair that sticks up all over the place because i look like a real hacker) so
anyhow you make electrical pulse a lot and you can fool the computers into
thinking you are a computer and they will be your friends. so then you ask
them something like 'hey can i look around on you for a little bit because 
i have never seen anything as powerful or advanced as you' and they will
always fall for the trick because they like their egos to be fed a lot and
it makes them happy. so then you are on the computer. you have hacked it.
and if you are nice the computer will give you something called root. but i
havent figured out what root is yet. i will report on that in another
article because i think everyone should be as elite as i am because i know 
a lot of secrets that nobody else knows.

oh yeah if you want to be able to hack without a computer you need to fool
the other computers into thinking you are one, like i said. so you need to
find stuff to wear that makes you look like a computer. make a big tower
case out of a cardboard box and wear it around. put something like 'packard
bell' on the outside and keep saying stuff like 'INTEL INSIDE' and 'PLUG AND
PLAY' and 'WINDOWS 95 COMPATIBLE' because computers like that kind of thing.
also buy lots of random cables at the store and wear them like necklaces
because they make other people stop to look at you and say 'wow he is a
hacker!'

ok that is the end of my exciting article i will write more later because
now i have to go into the kitchen and hack my toaster and make it make me a
Toaster Strudel from Pillsbury. they taste really good and all real hackers
eat them. all real hackers also drink buttermilk. i know because i am a real
hacker. well anyway i will talk to you later. bye and remember to hack the
planet, a lot

                               KuNT -- ScArEd????????


Yes, you heard it right.  KuNT is afraid of something.  Yes, even the most
elite hackers in the world occasionally get scared.  Well, rarely.  Really
almost never.  I mean, it just doesn't happen a lot.  Hell, I think this is
the first time.  But that's besides the point.

There's a new eliteness in town.  So elite it rivals even KuNT's power.  It
even brings with it a prophet foretelling of its power.  Observe:

--END HORRIBLE VISIONS OF THE FUTURE--

One can easily see why KuNT would choose to be wary of this mighty force
known only as 'highbloc'.  But can the words of this so-called 'Cathie
Franks' really be true?  We were skeptical, so we sent super-secret field
officer TrainRek into the field to witness the awesome power for himself.
Here are the frightening results:



<trainrek> 220 new.internet.terror.com
<trainrek> helo terror.verifier.com
<trainrek> 250 new.internet.terror.com pleased to meet your ass
<trainrek> vrfy hiblock
<trainrek> 250 hiblock
<trainrek> proof positive that hiblock *is* the new Internet
           terror
<trainrek> quit
<trainrek> 221 new.internet.terror.com kicked your ass



So there you have it.  Could the glorious days of KuNT soon be over?  Fat
fucking chance.  But even KuNT must recognize...highbloc *is* the new bad
ass internet terror.


You have been warned.

Like, okay...
       ...see, I was, like surfing...
                 ...on that Internetscape thing...

             ...when all of a sudden, the severed head of former president Billy
                  J. Portnar, like, totally came up from behind a mondo wave and
                                                   smacked me in the ass...

   ...it was, like, at this time that I decided "y'know, I'm so totally
   sick of being a faggot."  So I decided to do something about it...


            ...I went to the mall.  They had a cool store there.  I can't put my
                  finger on what made it so cool, but it smelled like incense in
                                    there, and the cashier had a pierced septum.


Anyway...

....I saw a shirt there, stained all sorts of bright pretty colors.
The tag identified it as a "tie-dye".  I think I saw these somewhere
before, so I decided to buy one.

    Then I got this cool Jerry Garcia bumper sticker.  I think he's like
    the King of Mexico or something.

                   After picking up the latest issue of High Times, I went home
                   and decided to be cool.  This Internet thing has like a chat 
                        room where you can talk to Gavin, so I signed on to the 
                                                                      Netscape.

       Soon enough, I was on Xworld, which I figured was about eXtacy,
       which is a cool raver drug so I thought it'd be cool.

  All of a sudden, some fellow net surfer invited me to something
  called #pot.

           I had never heard of *this* before.  There were all sorts of cool
        people there; so cool, in fact, that none of them could legally vote
                                            or even put a sentence together.

Eventually I got bored and went to #nethack, where I talked to
someone named bskin.

              And said "bskin, this is going absolutely nowhere, and I just
              remembered that thing that we had in a text file, the
              drug-commercial thing; why don't we do that instead of this
              pointless babbling because i'm busy and uninspired at the moment"?


                                                        The End.


      THIS PIECE BEARS ABSOLUTELY NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE MAKING OF KuNT 3

                                    HONEST.
