This is one of the quickest ways I've found to scam money.  Find a relatively 
large store that accepts returns and doesn't only sell worthless crap.  Go 
outside the store and look around for their publicly available trash cans.  
Without looking too obvious, search through the trash for some receipts.  
Look at the items on various receipts until you find something that is worth 
a good amount of cash.  Pocket the receipt and enter the store.  

Look around until you find the EXACT item on the receipt.  If it says Hoover 
DustVac, you don't go and get a Oreck Carpet Shampooer.  Check the price to 
make sure they match.  Nothing worse than trying to get a refund on an item 
from a store in which it wasn't bought.  Rip all the tags and shit off so it 
looks like it may have been used once or twice (the restrooms are a great 
place to do this).  If it is software (make sure they don't have a 'No 
Software Refunds' policy), be sure to break the seal so it appears that the 
box has been opened.  The object is to make it look like you took the item 
home and played around with it but didn't like it, so you stuck it back in 
the fruity multi-colored box in which it was sold.  Take this semi-worn box 
up to a sales counter and give them some shit about how you bought this item 
on <look at the date of the receipt before attempting to wing a lie> and it 
sorta blew goats so you wanted to return it.  They'll ask for your receipt 
which you readily hand them.  They'll check it with the item, then put the 
product under the counter and pop open the cash register and hand you your 
hard earned money.

Another thing you can do if you actually want the product and not the money 
is follow ALL of the steps up until you are at the counter asking for a 
refund.  She'll ask for the receipt, you give it to her, she verifies 
everything, and she will be about to put it under the counter.  This is where 
you decide that you don't want to return your item after all.  You suddenly 
find some use for it (use your imagination).  The clerk will watch you walk 
out the door with a stolen item and (s)he won't give a damn.  Ain't stupidity 
a great thing?

Enjoy the technique and always remember, people are always stupider than they 
look.
