while on vacation to south lake tahoe, i ran into an exclusive"Industry
and Law enforcement only" confrence on computer crime.  this exclusive
conference run by High Technology Crime Investigation Association
(HTCIA) featured speakers and vendors such as Network General, AT&T
Wireless, InfoTek, and Web Sleuth.  The talk was of preventing high tech
crimes (especially those on computers) and the new gizzmos that
available to cor(pirate)ations to do so. Unfortuneately I never got the
invite to this insider event.  However, those who did get invited ranged
from small ISP's to major cor(pirate)ations. The mostly bald attendies
of this conference seemed to talk the lingo(I heard hacker, and
phreaking and sniffers, more than once), but they were carefree and
loose lipped to the social enginerring I was doing. The last thing these
shmucks would have expected is to have a EBA Artist (Electronic Black
Arts) such as myself preying upon their little get together. I over
heard the vendors yaking about sniffers and making boasts such as
offering "immeadiate intrusion detection and automated response"
software. I was unable to slip into the conference, but I mingled with
the vendors as they packed up, I collected every scrap of literature I
could grab. I watched the vendors leave, returned to my room, thumbed
through the papers I grabbed, and thought to myself that if these nw
products could live up to their vendor's claims that the hacking world
is in immadiate danger of...having to learn new tricks to circumvent the
new security measures. But hey, that's what drives us to do what we do,
to learn, to know.  You can be sure I'll do my damnedist to get into the
next one of these get togethers, invited or not.  If you're intersted I
heard some damn thing about having to have a membrship to their little
club, but if you're not into that you can always crash the party.  One
of the next ones will be held Nov. 2-4 in Myrtle Beach South Carolina in
1998(featuring Jim Settle--former head of the FBI computer crime
squad).  I think a group of hackers making an appearance might cause
them to piss their pants so dress incogneto.

[As soon as I get a reply from him (he's still on vacation) then I'll
post all the inphoz he got.  Watch for an update, soon.  And by the way,
I live about an hour from Myrtle Beach.  Feer.  Me and my hacker buddies
here are going. -Def]
