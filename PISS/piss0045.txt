first pick a nick (example phanopB), change to it, and register it

okay, pick your target (lets say the nick is ROY)
act like you're female (don't have to, but it helps)

/msg them saying "i'm having trouble with nickserv, can you help me?
      i need to know if my nick phanopB is on kill, can you change to 
      it real fast and check, then change back to your normal nick?"

Most people will say yes.

After they change to your nick, when they change back to their regular nick,
type /msg NickServ GHOST phanopB thisguyisowned  (or whatever pass you set)

example:  ROY changes his nick to phanopB, then he changes back to ROY,
as soon as he changes back to ROY, you have around 5 seconds to type
/msg nickserv ghost phanopB thisguyisowned..  this will chain back to 
ROY, and you will get (NickServ(Killed ROY, ghost command used by phanop_)

ph34r dat #$(!$#!()#$((#(#!$()#!$$(!#$(!  
it's sort of like a ln -s unix link :)

ph34r muh nickserv hole finding skillz

[It's also fun to convince these people that you have their nick
password, and make them shit in their pants.  Either that or make them
teardrop you. -Def]

[This issue is also dedicated to a friend of both mine and phanop's,
Trent Hudson/Sutnerit.  He would've loved to do this to poor
unsuspecting people on dalnet.  (1978-1998). -def]
