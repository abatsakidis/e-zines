WinGates are the best invention to the IRC warrior (among other things)
since gay services (aka Dalnet, but I won't go into that now).  WinGates
are setup for some reason which seems to escape me, but who really
cares?  The point I am trying to make is that you can use WinGates to
effectively "spoof" an address, making yourself untraceable.  Let's see
how that is done.

IRC
---

If say, I wanted to take #operhelp on Dalnet, I would find an IRC
operator's /whois.

[This is taken straight from Cantaloop 3.0, which is not available yet
because I don't feel like putting it out.  All I can say is that it is
way better than the first two.]

Dakal is dakal@ppp41.lowdown.com : David Knepper
Dakal on @#operhelp
Dakal is using stlouis.mo.us.dal.net : Some stlouis bullshit here
Dakal is an IRC NaziSlut - Services Administrator
Dakal looks very helpful
End of /WHOIS list.

So he is on lowdown.com.  DNS him, and plug that address into the
WinGate scanner provided with this file (if it is not, email
piss@softhome.net and we'll give one to you.  Mine won't compile
correctly so I'll send another one until it does work.)  His DNS would
be 41.41.41.41 (not really).  So the WinGate scanner tries to connect to
port 23 on each of 41.41.41.'s class C, and when it gives a WinGate>
prompt, you've found a WinGate.  What exactly is a WinGate?  It allows
more than one person to connect from the same IP address.  Anyway, you
pull up a WinGate of 41.41.41.14.  So if you are using Cantaloop, goto
Setup and put that in the SOCKS firewall, and check the box.  No
username/password is usually needed.  

Sometimes, however, the gate doesn't accept you.  The mIRC SOCKS error
handling is bad, but in Cantaloop 3.0 I changed the responses to be more
accurate for your reason of disconnection.  You can try and close the
client and restart it, which sometimes works, or just rescan another
one.

Then change your identD to dakal (it won't pick this up, but 
just do it anyway) and change your email address to dakal@is.a.big.ho 
or something.  It will pick up the dakal from the email address and 
give you a /whois of ~dakal@ppp.14.lowdown.com .  So you can /msg 
chanserv access #operhelp, and it will probably still give you basic 
access.  You can sometimes social engineer ops or combine it with the 
services trick described in an earlier issue.  

For our Linux/Unix/Solaris/FreeBSD/yadda yadda yadda users:

Start your IRC client (ircii is the best, but some people like BitchX, i
have no idea why)

/server the.wingate.host.here 23

/quote the.server:6667

The client takes care of the rest.

There are a few drawbacks.  Like you can't DCC because their client
tries to connect to your gate, which isn't sending anything.  Also,
sometimes the gate gets really lagged or shuts you off altogether, then
you have to rescan.

And that's it.  For IRC at least.

HTTP WinGates
-------------

Linux/Unix:

I don't have a lot of experience with Lynx (our page isn't even lynx
friendly, I have to start changing that), so when I figure out how to
setup a proxy I'll say.  All you have to do is set the WinGate in as the
proxy server and put port 80 as the port.  

Windows:

For Netscape users, click the Options tab, then Network Preferences,
then put your WinGate in there and put port 80 as the port.  Better than
the Anonymizer, because you don't have to wait for 30 seconds or however
long they delay service.

FTP WinGates
------------

Again, if your FTP client can handle proxies, put the gate in but put
port 21 in this time.  Or with Netscape/IE, you have a choice of FTP
proxy, so put that in there.

There are many other services which WinGates can handle, such as SOCKS
support, Gopher, etc.  However, a friend of mine has gotten called by an
ISP for using their WinGates, so tread lightly and don't do anything
extremely stupid.  Have fun.
