Denial of Service Attacks - usage, detection and prevention
by devnull (reformed irk warrior and still a net.addict)

Overview:
Denial of Service Attacks (heretofore referred to as DoS Attacks) are
attacks sent over the internet to deny service to the receiving end.
(note: DoS attacks are illegal and easily traceable, I would never
suggest to do such a thing and would definitely never do such a thing
myself. - IF YOU DO SOMETHING STUPID AND GET CAUGHT, IT'S NOT MY 
RESPONSIBILITY)


Usage of DoS attacks:
(note: most of the .c source code files are available at rootshell.com)
(note: firewall refers to a windows firewall, i suggest conseal pc 
firewall, available at www.signal9.com)
(note: all patches available at www.webzone.net/ddg_computing/dalnet)

out-of-band:
  info: windows doesn't like tcp packets with the oob flag sent to netbios
  vulnerable: Windows (95/NT/3.x)
  protocol: tcp/ip, ports: 137-139
  used for: crash victim's computer
  symptoms: blue screen of death
  short-term fix: reboot
  long-term fix: firewall and patch - vtcpupd.exe
  detection: firewall
  launching: winnuke.c (rootshell.com)

jolt (ssping):
  info: icmp_echo fragmentation exploit
  vulnerable: Windows (95/NT/3.x), possibly old MacOS
  protocol: icmp (echo)
  used for: crash victim's computer
  symptoms: blue screen of death
  short-term fix: reboot
  long-term fix: firewall and patch - vipup11.exe/vipup20.exe
  detection: firewall
  launching: jolt.c (rootshell.com)

icmp_echo flooding:
  info: basic packet flooding
  vulnerable: all
  protocol: icmp (echo)
  used for: slow (lag) modem connection until it ping timeouts
  symptoms: major lag while not doing anything that would cause it
  short-term fix: redial into ISP
  long-term fix: firewall
  detection: firewall
  launching: ping (rootshell.com)

udp datagram flooding:
  info: basic packet flooding
  vulnerable: all
  protocol: udp, ports: all
  used for: slow (lag) modem connection until it ping timeouts
  symptoms: major lag while not doing anything that would cause it
  short-term fix: redial into ISP
  long-term fix: firewall
  detection: firewall
  launching: pepsi.c (rootshell.com)

icmp unreach:
  info: creates packets that trick client into disconnecting
  vulnerable: all
  protocol: icmp (unreachable)
  used for: disconnect from irc
  symptoms: unexplained (repeated) disconnections from irc
  short-term fix: reconnect to irc server
  long-term fix: firewall
  detection: firewall or other program that will monitor icmp unreachables
  launching: puke.c (rootshell.com)

teardrop (similar to jolt):
  info: one in a series of udp fragmentation exploits
  vulnerable: Windows (95/NT), Linux kernel 2.0.31
  protocol: icmp (echo)
  used for: crashing victim's computer
  symptoms: blue screen of death/total freezeup
  short-term fix: reboot
  long-term fix: firewall/vipupd20.exe
  detection: firewall
  launching: teardrop.c (rootshell.com)

boink (bonk/newtear):
  info: newest of udp header/fragmentation exploits (modified teardrop)
  vulnerable: Windows (95/NT)
  protocol: icmp (echo)
  used for: crashing victim's computer
  symptoms: blue screen of death/freezeup
  short-term fix: reboot
  long-term fix: firewall
  detection: firewall
  launching: boink.c/bonk.c/newtear.c (rootshell.com)

land:
  info: spoofs a tcp syn packet from the same ip as you send it to
  vulnerable: Windows (95/NT)
  protocol: tcp/ip, ports: any that are open on your system (113, 139)
  used for: crashing victim's computer
  symptoms: total freezeup
  short-term fix: reboot
  long-term fix: patch (vipup11.exe/vipup20.exe)
  detection: none that can be easily setup
  launching: land.c/latierra.c

to www.warforge.com and you can find most of them there.]
