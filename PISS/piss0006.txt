Lame people and newbies who talk to me on ICQ ask me "do you hack" 
and when I reply (if I'm in a good mood I say yes), they say 
"can you teach me how?".  This pisses me off big time.  People have 
this preconceived notion that hacking is just breaking into computers.  
THEY ARE WRONG!  I can't explain to them in 256 characters how fucked 
up they are.  So I thought I would write this file about the 
misconceptions of most people about hackers.

First of all, hacking is not breaking into computers.  Hacking has many 
different aspects besides the obvious.  Hacking is accessing systems so 
that you can learn more about them, not destroy all the stuff there.  
Hacking also is a state of mind; a state where you block out everything 
else and concentrate on getting through what you're working on so you 
can find out stuff and use it to your advantage.  By learning you can 
conquer bigger stuff to try to learn as much as possible about programs, 
systems, and security holes.

Second, I nor anyone else can teach someone "how to hack".  But people 
think hacking is easy enough to be able to be taught.  NO!  To learn 
how to do something, you must read.  Read read read.  Read until your 
eyes are sore from staring at the goddamn paper.  This way you will 
gain some knowledge about the type of things you may encounter along 
the way to doing something.  But accessing these systems is not as 
easy as these files say.  These files, put together, can help you to
get into systems and learn about the systems, NOT TO DESTROY STUFF!  
People think hackers are these badass mf'ers who just trash everything 
they see.  Nope.  These people are not real hackers.  These people are 
probably running canned progs and simulating hacks.  THESE PEOPLE ARE 
SHIT HEADS!  They think that since they can run a prog, they know 
everything.  You have to use your brain and not lines of C code to learn.

Third, there are lamers who pose as these great mf'ers and say they can 
do anything, but when you shut off their two main ways of trying to fuck 
people (winnuke and mailbomb), they break down and are revealed to be 
shit.  This is especially fun when in a chat and someone tries to nuke 
you and you just stay there and then they look at that hotmail address 
and they say (and i quote) "oh shit".  It is about this time that I have 
flood pinged the hell out of them and they drop.  These people need to 
get a swift kick in the ass.

There are also people who send out things like viruses which sole purpose 
is to destroy your hard drive.  These people can go fuck themselves 
because they think that viruses are good.  Sometimes, a trojan horse 
here or there can help you and do no harm to anyone, but these people 
don't know that, they only know how to kill, maim, and destroy.  These 
people are the dumbass criminals of our world.

Then there are people who don't do anything bad, and just learn from what 
they do and don't destroy anything, unless they put it back when they are 
done.  They are very knowlegeable and often enigmatic.  They try not to be 
a bastard to others who come across their path.  These people are the REAL 
hackers.  REAL hackers point out holes in systems to sysops.  REAL hackers 
could be trusted to not narc.  REAL hackers don't do anything harmful to 
systems or people unless ABSOLUTELY necessary, and even then it isn't bad.  
I'd like to consider myself a REAL hacker, but I don't think I am.  I 
still bring down people who are being pricks to others (not trashing 
anything on their HD but I could if I wanted to), but I don't do anything 
dumb.  I don't feel like ending up in a jail cell with a tranvestite 
satan worshiper who wants to have me as his little toy.  I don't fucking 
think so.  

I sound like Dennis Miller.  Cool.  You don't agree with me?  Don't like 
what I say?  You can shove those complaints up your ass.  Cause I don't 
care, and neither does anyone else.  You're a sorry piece of cybershit 
if you just like taking things down for the hell of it.  FUCK YOU PEOPLE!
