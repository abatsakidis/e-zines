[I think all this should work...hehe]


<Disclaimer: This is all theory and I have no clue if it works or not.  
Really.  Don't be stupid, I'm not to be held responsible for what you 
do with this info nor is the person you got it from.>

	Now this is an easy one, Juno in their infinite wisdom has 
placed free dialups all over the country so you can get free e-mail 
wherever you are, there's a couple of advantages and disadvantages 
to using this service.  

IS GOOD:
They don't ask a whole lot of questions about who you are.  You can 
have almost completely anonymous service by just pushing space twice 
in the name blocks and other required fields.
You can remove the annoying ads really easy.
They're FREE.  I am a firm believer in getting something for nothing.

IS BAD:
They're not completely anonymous, the fone company still has the 
records of your call to the service so don't get into anything too ugly.
They send you stupid and annoying ads all the time.
They don't support phile attachments for shit, text only.  If you send 
anything else it gets smacked into the message as text.  This works but 
you have to C+P whatever the phile is onto Notepad or a DOS edit window 
and change the extension.

IS INTERESTING:
They use PPP and TCP/IP to access your mail.
They leave the host address and passwords to the local server right in a 
config phile.

WHAT TO DO:
	First, establish an account.  Juno programs are floating all over 
the web and someone always has a program disk.  If you're using the account 
to do ugly things to people fill in a fake name or just push space a couple 
of times and push next.  The only thing the program is looking for is that 
you are pushing a button while the cursor is in the block.  Check your mail 
and ditch the two spam messages about you being their most valuable 
customer and all that usual shit.

	Second.  This is the fun part.  Get into the directory that you 
have the Juno phile in, (it should install right to a folder called "Juno" 
on your C: drive,) and then into the User0000 folder.  In there is a 
phile called Juno.ini, open this.  About halfway down there will be a 
section called [VARIABLES] with some rather interesting information.

	--SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS--
              [Variables]
              login=junox6
              password=actaobi
              hostname=x6.boston.juno.com
              port=1793

	Now the idea here is to take that nifty dial up networking or 
Linux program you have and establish a connection to their server using 
that information.  NOTE: These passwords are changed REGULARLY so send 
mail to yourself every now and again to keep it current, that is if your 
not using the account for regular stuff.  I wouldn't recommend staying 
on the connection for too long either, I personally haven't messed with 
this in a while, (since March '97) so it may or may not work still.  
Also the passwords and server names vary from area to area, and change 
to different ones without warning.  The one above is an example from 
where I live.  Handy idea, out beige boxing with a laptop and want 
REALLY anonymous mail, or need a genuinely anonymous connection?  
Hehehe.  You get the picture.

	Third, getting rid of the ads.  This is so complicated I cannot 
pay attention, you may want to read the directions on how to do this 
several times before starting, and then do it step by step.  Ready? K, 
delete the directory inside the Juno folder called ads.  Delete the 
whole damn thing.  No more ads flashing across the screen.  This has 
to be done every two to three connections, sometimes less.

--HERE'S THE ENTIRE JUNO.INI PHILE--  Keep some interesting stats on 
you, like the amount of time you were using the program last.
