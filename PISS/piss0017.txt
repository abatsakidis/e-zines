DISCLAIMER:  The information contained in this file is for informational

anyone I know can't be held responsible.  Yeah, whatever.  Here goes.

So one day my rents told me to drive down to the local Office Depot 
and get a file cabinet.  Don't ask me why because I have no damn clue.  
So I got the only other hacker friend I have in the 803 area code 
(there's only 1 hacker besides me where I live), and we called in a 
pizza.  The wait for the pizza was about 45 minutes, so we stayed at 
Office Depot.  And at Office Depot, they had computers with the 
Windows password that always stays on, and that you can never turn 
off.  I saw two wussy workers playing MicroShit Golf on one, so I 
decided to have fun with the rest of the others.  So I found that 
there were two computers without screensavers on, and proceeded to 
take my PISS logo (I bring it on a disk wherever I go, don't ask me 
why), and change it so that the Windows background was the logo, 
tiled over and over again.  I also changed the screensaver (on none 
at that time), to Scrolling Marquee (this comes with Windows), and 
typed in "THIS MACHINE HAS BEEN LIBERATED BY P.I.S.S.!!! HA HA HA 
YOU BASTARD WORKERS!!!".  This was rather childish, but what the 
hell do I care?  So I put a real long password in for the screensaver 
"lamerssuckbigmonkeydicks" (like they're EVER going to find that out), 
and then decided to try to crack the password on the other machines.  
Then I had a thought about how to turn off the screensavers since I 
only had 30 minutes and Ctrl-Alt-Del wasn't working, because it was a
Windows built-in screensaver.  However other screensavers that do not
come with Windows can be turned off with Ctrl-Alt-Del.

I turned the power off.  Now why the hell hasn't ANYONE ever thought 
of this before?  If they have then they never stuck it in a file.  So 
we both turned ALL the machines off and then rebooted them.  On some 
of the machines we stuck a trojan I wrote that kills all config files 
if the screensaver runs (like I'm gonna give this out..yeah right!).  
On others, we did the same thing that we did to the computers without 
screen savers on, which they were trying to figure out the passwords 
on when we came back about an hour later.  Hell, they'll never figure 
out to turn the damn things off.  On still others we deleted 
autoexec.bat just for fun and left the computers off.  Since they 
don't keep backup copies of autoexec.bat (dumb shits), that computer 
will probably have to have Win95 reinstalled or some other shit to fix it.  

But back to the story.  We got chased out of the store when we came back 
(how did they know it was us?????) but we both ran track last year and 
fat guys wearing dress shoes are NO match for runners wearing Nike 
cross trainers.  We knocked over these losers who skateboarded around 
there all the time and evidently had no life (neither do I).  We then 
called Office Depot through OCI (dumb shits! 1-800-288-2880) to 
op-divert and harassed the hell out of them.  The next day I called up 
my harassment program (CatCall), and fired that sucker up and left it 
on while I went to watch the people at Office Dipshit try to answer 
the phones that were oddly ringing off the hook.  Hmmmm, I wonder who 
could've done that?  Out of the gratefulness of my heart after 
laughing at the bastards all day, I turned off the program and everybody 
there probably breathed a sigh of relief.  


So, for those who want to skip the pious bullshit and just read how to 
bust the computers, here goes.

1.  Find computers with screensavers off.  Do whatever the hell you want 
with it.

2.  If you can't crack the password to the screen saver (yeah it's pretty 
easy but I didn't have a lot of time), then just turn the damn machine off.

3.  Boot into DOS or Windows, whichever you want, and then change all the 
screen saver passwords (this pisses EVERYBODY off and is fun to stick 
around and watch the swearing).  Then do whatever you want.

4.  Have fun!
