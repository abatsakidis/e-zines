****WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TO BE A REAL HACKER****
                AKA- writing code

*********************************************************************
DISCLAIMER:  IF	YOU DON'T LIKE THIS PHILE, TOO BAD!  DON'T READ IT! *
AND IF YOU DO, THEN GOOD FOR YOU!  AND KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS JUST   *
CODING SO FAR SO DON'T COMPLAIN, IT WILL GET BETTER!                *
*********************************************************************



Part of the PISS Philes collection....."COLLECT THEM ALL!"

ok listen up, if you want to be a real "hacker" you gotta know how to code.
i don't care what other ppl say about it, you need to know how to program, 
so listen carefully.

PART 1:  some basics : VARIABLES.


this isn't a phile for lamers so i'm not even going to bother covering BASIC.
if you don't know at least BASIC then you don't need to be a hacker, so leave now and come back when you're ready for some REAL programming.

for those of you that truly are begginers, we'll start with some ez stuph like turbo pascal.
pascal is basically a language to get you ready for higher programming like C and C++.
now that you know the subject, let's dig in....here's your first note....

--== FIRST PROGRAMMING NOTE: VARIABLES ==--
if you're gonna program, you gotta know variables, trust me, this crap is way more interesting that that algebra stuph you learned in hell (skool).

WHAT A VARIABLE IS:  i could tell you that a variable is a reserved block of memory in which you store a defined type of information, but this ain't no textbook.

WHAT A VARIABLE IS FOR THE COMMON MAN/WOMAN (for PC reasons):  if you wanna get into some comparison crap, a variable is like a box...
when you declare a variable, you're basically making an empty box.  then you have to fill that box.

WHAT TO DO WITH THOSE BOXES:  first of all, when you declare the variable, it's empty, so you gotta put something in it to make it useful.
this is called initializing the variable, you have to put something in it before you can manipulate in in any way.

TYPES OF VARIABLES:  ok, variables have types.  for example, you have to have the right box cause it doesn't to any good to put fine china into a huge refrigerator box...
some types are....

VARIABLE       PASCAL SYNTAX

integer        integer
long integer   longint
real           real
character      char
string         string


these are by no means all the types.


EXAMPLE TIME!

{declare your variables in a "var" section}

VAR

  x : int;
  y : char;

BEGIN

{use the freakin things or....initaialize em...}
x := 0;
y := 'a';

{manipulate em}

x := x + 1;

{output em}

writeln (x);
writeln (y);

end.


k, if you did it all right, it'll say....


1
a



and if you didn't you'll get some error message that you probably don't understand! mwahahahahah....

--== NOTE 2 : error messages ==--

Error messages are really a conspiracy to confuse you....they actually make some sense if you're from the planet Vogon.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm tired of writin about this crap.  It gets more interesting, trust me...especially when you get into memory manipulation...puter crashing...virii etc.
hehehe....I take coding seriously.  LEARN IT!  And get your hands on a copy of turbo pascal cause my examples will be in that at first, until we move on.
DON'T HESITATE TO SCREW AROUND!  you don't learn nuthin if you don't screw around, so screw around with variables...try not initializing em...
(which will sometimes give you garbage or a Vogonian error message).
LEARN TO CODE!  it will get you frendz and dates!  hehe....so maybe i lie.  but you'll need to know it.
and remember....there'll be a test on Monday.  hehe...
catch ya'll l8r.

[He's gonna be writing a series on code and crap like that, and I'm
happy that I don't have to do it.  YaY!  Also one more note, if you
don't initialize variables then you can dump all that crap into memory
and crash things...huhhuh..cool...crashing...shut up Beavis.  Ok, well
that's all for now..he'll be putting out more soon.  -Def]
