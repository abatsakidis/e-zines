Yes folks, you all know the drill.  You open your email box and you see
like 300 messages full of nothing, or even worse, subscribed to 50 mail
lists like "Gay Plumber's Repair".  This, of course, is mailbombing.
Mailbombing is normally done by people who want to get back at others
who make them mad.  This is normally done by lamers who don't know jack
shit about doing REAL things to people (not like I do them though ;) ) and
they just open a program and BAM, instant harrassment.  I used to do
this when I had no actual hacking knowledge (many could say I still
don't, but they can fuck themselves) and just wanted to feel like I
could ruin someone's life.  I still do it sometimes, though without a 
program, just with Linux commands.  However, I haven't done it in 
several months.  Now I know that mailbombing is pointless, because you
can jsut delete the mails (ooohhh...15 seconds worth of work) or if
you're subscribed to mail lists, block sender of all the maillists.  I'm
not going to rehash that.  I'm gonna tell you how to tell who mailbombed
you and how to get them back.

If you know someone has mailbombed you, turn on something called
extended headers.  This will show the entire route the mail took to get
in your mailbox.  The beginning part will be what you saw normally,
which implicates no one.  But if you look closer, you see all the hops
along the route.  Look at either the first or second one.  It should
show an email address which does NOT look like a router because it has a
username which someone might actually use.  This is either his email
address or how he connected to the net.  So you run a finger on that
email address, and if something comes up, then you've got him.  If not,
then try changing the domain name around and eventually you will get it.
Whatever it is, you at least have his username.

If you catch this guy, you can either mailbomb him back and be stupid,
or send a message to root@hisdomain or postmaster@hisdomain with a copy
of the mailbomb (for proof) and tell the guy that he mailbombed you and
just make up some bullshit like that (well actually it wouldn't be
bullshit).  It will probably get him kicked off his ISP, which is a
royal pain in the ass for those that have gone through it.  

If you didn't think I explained this too well, or have ONE copy of a
mailbomb you'd like me to work on, mail me at defenestrator@hotmail.com
.  If you want to mailbomb me, mailbomb dev/null@hotmail.com .  That
really pisses me off when you mail dev/null.
