One day you may find strange people knocking on your door, asking to
search the premises of your house.  Now for this reason, normally when a
cop comes by wy window (my window is right behind my computer) I run a
DOS window which runs a wipe program that deletes all of my dodgy files.
So far I've never had to do that, but maybe one day I will.

Anyways, if a strange person comes to the door asking to search the
place, ask him to see the search warrant.  If he has no search warrant,
then all he can do is to ask you to please let him in.  Tell him to go
to hell and then go to your comp and start deleting stuff, because he
may come back with a warrant later.  

I've never been raided, but I know of people that have and it's not a
pretty sight.  Some people in the h/p community have learned how to deal
with getting busted, and I've taken their advice and stuck all I know in
this shitty-ass phile.

The MiBs have tricks which they use to get people talking.  I have heard
that one way they use is to say you did something that you obviously
didn't do, just to get you talking.  But if you follow this one rule,
your ass will be better off.

WHEN TALKED TO --> SHUT UP

Most people convict themselves in the interview.  If your mouth is just
DYING to say something, say, "I want a lawyer", and nothing else.  They
can't do anything to you if you don't say anything.  

If the MiBz tell you that your friends narked on you (some friends huh)
then tell him back that they can go on their testimony.  If they offer
you some deal like "if you nark on your buds we'll let you off easier"
DON'T TAKE IT!!!  They are so full of shit it stinks.  And even if you
do get let off easy, your buds will kick your ass when you see them
again.

When you get your lawyer, he can tell the MiBs to shut up instead of
having to do it yourself.  This can help you immensely if your case ever
goes to trial.  No one wants to be in a cell with Roy the gerbil-fucker
for years at a time.
