This file's gonna become real long so I'll split it up into 5 parts,
one for each way to defeat the cable.

HOW TO GET SOME FREE CABLE
--------------------------

With all the crackdowns on cable stealers lately, (well where i live they 
are cracking down) I decided to post all the stuff you can do to 
get free cable from the mf'ers who run the cable company.  TV should 
be free, right?  At least HBO and Playboy should be free, along with all 
those other channels.

In different places, there are different security measures implemented 
to stop you from getting free stuff, which is my goal in life.  There 
are 4 or 5 different ways to get around these, some of which are real 
old and probably don't work anymore.  

REAL OLD METHOD - BACKYARD SCRAMBLING
-------------------------------------

This was the first way they tried to stop people from getting free
cable.  The company would scramble pay stations by placing filters in 
the cable relay according to the channels you had ordered.  The way 
you get around this is to go to your cable relay.  Cable relays are 
normally located in groups of four.  They will be found in groups of 2 
if your house backs up to the street.  For example, if you lived in a 
house on the corner of two streets, the house next to you, the house 
behind you, and the house diagonally across from you would all be 
connected on the same relay.  I'll try to make a shitty ASCII drawing 
of it.


	_____________
	|a	b	e
	|
	|
	|c	d

If the houses were connected in groups of four, which is most common, houses a,b,c,and d would 
be connected and the relay would most likely be in c or d's backyard.  If they were in groups of 
2 then a and b would probably be connected, and the relay would be in a's backyard.  Don't ask 
me why I drew e.  Must be all that caffeine.

The cable is split into 4 different cables at this point, all leading into the dome.  Depending 
on what each of the houses subscribe to, certain channels are scrambled.  The cable company 
scrambles channels by screwing the cable into a 3" metal cylinder.  These cylinders can range in 
size from 2" to 4" but it is usually 3".  The cylinder will have a sticker on it with one or 
more letters telling what channel(s) is scrambled.  For instance if it scrambles channel 20, it 
will say "NF-G", the last F being the important letter.  If it scrambles channels 20,21,22 it 
will say "NF-GHI".  Cable companies are weird, so they might put two of these cylinders on, say 
one "NF-G" and one "NF-HI", but it will do the same job the as the aforementioned.

NOTE:  This part is reprinted from some file I read.

GETTING CABLE IF YOU DON'T SUBSCRIBE:
-------------------------------------

This is for the way you've just read about.  First, you'll have to find where the "green dome" 
is.  The "green dome" will be either a green dome (of course) or a beige dome, with a yellow 
"Cable theft is naughty" sticker on it.  Like I said above, you have a one in 4 (or 1 in 2) 
chance of having it in your own backyard.  If it's not in your backyard, then find out whose 
backyard it is in, and go over there some day when they're at work or something.

Now that you've located it, you must get the master lock off.  There are three proven methods of 
doing this.  You can either kick the living shit out of it, or take some pliers and grab the 
loop that the lock goes into, and bend it off by twisting it back and forth, or take heavy duty 
wire cutters and cut the loop off.  And don't worry about the damage you've done; cable men do 
the exact same thing, and if you're lucky they might have done it already!  So it won't appear 
to be anything out of the ordinary.

Once you've got the lock off, you can take the big green dome off.  You will see a box with 4 
terminals (places to screw in cable):
                     _______
                    /       \
                   |  o   o  |
                   |         | <-- the "box", each "o" is a
                   |  o   o  |     terminal to screw in a
                    \_______/      cable
                       |  |
                       |  | <-- metal pole/big cable
                       |  |

they may or may not be any cable currently screwed into these depending on if you and your 
neighbors subscribe to cable.  If someone does not subscribe to cable, there will simply be a 
terminal where the cable is not screwed in.  The terminal where the cable is not screwed in 
might have a little dull grey 1" cylinder to prevent you from getting cable free.  See, the 
cylinder is hollow and will carry no signal, so if you reconnect the cable to it, you will get 
nothing.  DO NOT RIP IT OUT!!!  I have, and it will rip the terminal right out with it and then 
the cable company WILL come out to fix it.  These things use the same idea as child-proof 
bottles; you have to push "in"/towards the "box" and then unscrew.  It will take awhile to do 
this, so don't get perturbed.

So, if you are not currently subscribing to cable at all, there will be an unused terminal, and 
one end of a cable lying somewhere in the dome.  All you have to do is reconnect the unused 
cable to the unused terminal, and there you go!  Instant Cable with all pay-channels included!

If you are paranoid, you can connect it at 6 pm (when the cable company closes for the day), and 
then disconnect it before 9 or 10 am.  This way, even if they come out and look at it, it will 
be disconnected--nothing unusual.

Of course you can leave it hooked up ALL the time.  It sounds crazy, but someone I know has had 
the cable company come to his house four times and work on his box, and they didn't say a word!  
I guess the cable linemen don't have records of what everyone subscribes to.

GETTING PAY-CHANNELS IF YOU ARE ALREADY A BASIC SUBSCRIBER:
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you are currently subscribing to the basic cable service, and you want all the pay-channels 
that you aren't already subscribing for, read this. First you'll want to find out which 
cable/terminal you are.  Go turn on your TV and then go out to the green dome and unscrew one of 
the cables from a terminal.  Go back inside and see if you've disconnected the cable for 
yourself.  Once you find which cable disconnects yours, your done.  And DON'T leave your 
neighbors unconnected or the cable company WILL come out. 

Remember how I said that cable companies scramble the pay-channels? Using the cylinders?  Well, 
those 3" metal cylinders are kept in black plastic cases about 9" long.  There are a few ways of 
getting the cylinders off.  The first is to get some pliers and grab the cable tight, close to 
the black cylinder.  Then grabbing the black cylinder as tight as you can (so that it grips the 
cylinder inside), unscrew the cable.  Once you've got one side unscrewed, do the other side.

The second way is to get wire cutters and cut up the edge of the black plastic cylinder.  This 
is a lot easier, and this way you actually get to see the 3" metal cylinders inside.  I 
recommend this one.

When you're done with that, either attach the cable coming out of the ground to the terminal 
(leaving you with one short length of cable; go use it inside your house or something), or get a 
male-to-male coaxial cable converter and attach the two (this will not look suspicious, as the 
cable company uses them too).

And now you should have some free cable if that's all your cable system does.

Wait for part 2 on the site, which I'll out out when I get some time.
