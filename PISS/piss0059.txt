	      The Travler's Giude to Hotel Phreaking




--------------------Standard-Superstitious-Disclaimer:------------------
I don't know why anybody bothers with these; comercial cases have
found authors giulty of wrongfull collaboration with Idiots that
have been caught using thier Ideas (like the guy who wrote HIT-MAN)
so it follows that fone phraud articles would also have evil, 
nasty,giulty, authours too.  
 
  Here it is anyway:

FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY.  SEE DICK PHREAK.  SEE DICK FLUB.
SEE DICK SIT BEHIND THE DOCK.  THESE POSSIBLE SCHEMES ARE POSSIBLY 
ILLEGEAL AND ARE NOT MEANT TO BE ACTED OUT ON PLANET EARTH. 
DON'T BE A DICK.
----------------------------------------------------------------------


	Hi there.  Winkstart and I took an extended jaunt 
thru the midwest last winter and consequently stayed in a lot of those 
pre-fab travel lodges that dot the surface of our once-proud nation.  
After being snowed in enough times we found we had quite a collection 
of neat ideas that could cut a phreaks' phone bill (if not his/her
travel expenses) down to nothing.  True, there are a lot of smoother
ways to get phree calls in public places but we found that anybody who 
can afford to hire hotel security can afford our phone bill too.
	Wink and I will break this down into two parts:  Things you 
can do in the lobby, and things you can do in your rooom.  I'll cover 
the lobby section.
	Since the practial death of the redbox the lobby offers the 
phreak few options.  You can:

A. Jump behind the desk and grab the little fucker out of the suprsied
   hand of an unsuspecting desk clerk.

or

B.  Phreak the reservation phone.

	Unfortuantley many hotels have stopped using dedicated
1-800 reservation lines in favor of desktop reservation networks but 
some still do, especially in rural areas.
	Now most know about the reservation phone thing, hell
an unsupervised reservation phone is a fone junkie's wet dream, but 
there are a few different kinds and not always do you need a white box.
Some reservation phones are standrad phones that lazy manufacturers
have tried to disguise as faceless ones. You'll see these anywhere, 
from the lowest super8 to the classiest ritz, as most hotel managers 
don't realize that there's a phreak around every corner. These fones 
have either a plastic slip-cover or the kind that you bow a bit
to insert.  Or remove.  Underneath you'll find the button studs, sans
numerals, and if you can remember the order of 1 thru nine, and which
side the * and # are on, you can make your call.  Most of the people 
you'll find milling about in a lobby don't notice you doing this.  I 
once sat on the line for tow hours and watched the desk clerks in
a wall mirror the whole time.
	What I like to do for true faceless phones is carry around a 
little fold-up house fone I lifted from my ratty shack.  Pop a two
plug spliter in the back of the holtel's phone and a short-cord in the
other side and dial away.  If you feel really slick you can splice 
cross-connect wire into a modular plug beforehand, run a line through 
the plastic plants, over a doorjamb or two, and around the corner into 
the payphone booth and pretend your'e using the phone the fone in there.
Big hotel chains often use the same pattern rug and wallpaper
so you might only need a small pallete of wire to choose from.
If you think THAT sounds stupid you should have heard some of the 
schemes dreamed up in the midnight, drift-locked chatter we decided 
not to share.
	


	And that concludes the lobby.  The good Doctor leaves me 
with the more usefull, technial and, comfortable part to discuss:  Your 
hotel room.  
	This part of the phile is basically a reaction to an article I 
read in Wired.  real sophisticated stuff.  The author was 
complaining because a lot of hotels snip the very tip off the clips of
thier modular plugs so you can't remove them because they don't want
thier geusts pulling them all the time and wearing out the hardawre. 
These unich-clips were a real bee up his ass.
He made some comment about the well-wired traveller that allways 
carries a pen knife for such occasions and as with all Wired 
articles, I found myself wondering what that had to do with 
fashion, style, and saving the world.
	Because it's a legit magazine what he didn't say was that 
the even-better wired travler can elminate his phone bill altogether.  
Many hotels not only have adjoining doors, but also have adjoining wall 
jacks as well. Take the flathead screwdriver on that pennife and pop 
that cover off.  Right there between the two layers of drywall (only 
one in a Super8!) is your "neighbor's" phone line.  Wait till 
theyr'e either asleep or humping and go to work.
	Another thing he didn't tell me, and this I would find really 
problematic were I the modern biusnessman that he had intended his 
article for, is that many hotel PBX's don't give you a carrier for
anywhere near as long as would a local network.  Less than 10 seconds 
sometimes. This especially sucks if you use one of those untweakable 
modem proggies that are so common to 95.  If your program can't execute
your dial string before the line times out your'e screwed (My biggest 
complaint against windows is that Hyperterminial has all those goddamn
wizard screens between you and the modem.  THIS is why congress should 
outlaw Bill Gates Inc.).  We found the best-western and the clarion-comfort 
hotels we stayed in were like this.
	Another thing you can do in your room is use an inductive 
amplifier or some other current-sensing device to search the walls and 
ceiling for other lines, punch out your own holes, and tap in there,
but the maid seems to notice.  Don't ever forget to raid her cart for 
free soap and shampoo.
        So, if you want to enter a real nasty dial-up or some other
stupid thing and have cash and a legitamatley fake I.D., get yourself a
room.  My suggestion is that you do so on a weekday when your'e least 
likley to have neighbors. If you do have neighbors and they pick up 
during your call you can allways play it off like you don't hear them.
The hotel will never undestand what went wrong when they complain but 
are sure to give the more insistant customers thier money back.
If your'e on a confrence call have some scissors handy.
	Or you can always disconnect thier phone service beforehand,
but I don't like fucking up the wries too much.  Especially when 
I room under my own name. When they eventually check the problem the 
lineman or whoever will catch on:

"Hello? Mr. Lixard? This is Chip from Mariott security. Do you recall 
 your stay in room 212 on the night of the 15th?" 


And that concludes this file. Next: How to win a free subscription
