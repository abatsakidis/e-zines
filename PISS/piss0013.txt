A NEWBIES GUIDE 
TO PHREAKING IN THE '90s
volume II

It's that time again. Our Disclaimer: We in no way are responsible for any actions you take with the knowledge gained from this manual. It is intended for informational purposes only. Yadda, yadda yadda...just get to the manual.

This volume is going to be on Boxes.  As a good phreak you  should have skeptisism toward the boxes listed below, all have been reported to exist, all reportedly work, The one's I've investigated work.  I guess everything works in theory...use your own judgement.

  I.Box quick reference guide
 II.Short history of boxing 
III.Misc

It's not neccessary, but the ability to name a box and what it does when trying to talk to a fellow phreak is nice.  For more detailed information on the different boxes I reccommend checking out Super Sharp Shooter's page at http://www.cyberus.ca/~mdma/phreak/.

As far as I know boxing first became popular with the blue box...made famous (or infamous depending on your point of view) by Captain Crunch.  There are a bunch of great files out there about the Capt'n and the history of blue boxing.  In our opinon the Capt'n is the greatest phone phreak that has ever lived (yes he is still alive. However he is "retired/clean" at this point in time).  Blue boxing has become nearly imposible due to Bell upgrading their security precautions.  However blue boxing is still posible if you find the right lines and trunks.  After a few years more and more boxes came into being.  The list above is fairly current, and should stay that way until we the artisians of the electronic black arts get off our asses (side note: we've already made new boxes...your turn :-)) and discover new technologies instead of relying on the trailblazzing work of others, such as the Capt'n.

Needless to say most if not all boxing is illegal...therefore it would be fairly stupid to box from your own home.  If you make a new box that works publish it ASAP.  Boxes are just electronic devices that let you steal, gain, utilize,etc. different functions of  phones and phone systems.  Most of these are easy to make and only require minimal finacial investment. Good luck.

That more or less wraps up this short guide on boxing...If we get any feed back that asks for more complete info, we'll write a more complete version.  This is the end of another text file by Dial-Tone (dial_tone_2600@hotmail.com) and the rest of  PISS.
