Cantal00p!  Well, I haven't been writing for a while for various
reasons, the best one being I actually have to do work at my job now.
Oh well.  And if some dumbasses want to mail me asking what cantaloop
means (3 people already asked me) it means whatever you want.  Just use
it where you would use any other word.  Bah!

Ever notice how people can do simple tasks like programming their VCR
and microwave, but not figure out how to double-click on something in
Windoze?  This is for more than one reason.  One, they are stupid.  Two,
they don't take the time to learn jackshit.  They buy computers to be
trendy, and then bitch at tech support.  At the school I used to go to,
I was a semi-"tech support".  That means that everyone (and yes i mean
EVERYONE, even the computer teachers) came to me for help.  People would
ask me some stupid dumbass questions, like "How can you play that Hearts
game?".  For chrissakes, it's SITTING right in front of their stupid
fucking redneck faces.  Maybe they couldn't see the monitor above their
belt buckle/gun (if you don't get that, go to hell).

It amazes me how people will spend upwards of a thousand dollars just to
look like they're sophisticated, having a computer.  Ooooh, scary.  Now,
these are also the same people who actually work at places like Nynex,
which suck the big one.  Hehe, just kidding.  Maybe I'm not.  Bah!

From now until the end of the world, people will try to keep up with
technology, and eventually everyone will have a computer, because it'll
be like buying a small television (i hope!@!@).  But that still doesn't
mean that everyone will have a brain enough to use it.  If you notice,
most people that need help are people that didn't grow up with
computers.  Well, I didn't, but I got into them about two years ago.  I
have a brain, and can figure out things for myself.  I think the older
generations think that computers will just take over in a few years.
Maybe they will.  Then who would come out on top?  People like me.

uNF.
