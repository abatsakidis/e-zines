Everyone has seen those godawful Lpage guestbooks (hell, we even have
one) and I've always wanted to know if there is a way to fuck with them.
So one day I just idle on to IRC, and someone (no names, to protect the
innocent...hehe) tells me they hacked Santa's Lpage guestbook.  Which is
true, because I saw it myself.  So I asked him how, and like a good
person he told me.  What it does is mainly sort of comment out all the
html in their page, which is how the book works, if you ever view source
on it.  

To effectively remove all the entries on a certain page, post and add
this to the end of the post.

<xmp><plaintext>

Now it will seem like all of the entries, including yours, are gone.
What you do is hit back on your browser, and take out those control
codes and repost your ransom note or whatever.  But, if people post
after you, you have no control over that, unless you set up a Perl
script to do it for you, which I couldn't do because I know limited
Perl.  That will change however.

I have a saved HTML file of the guestbook, mail me at
defenestrator@hotmail.com to see it, and eventually I will post it on my
page when I get the urge.  

41!
