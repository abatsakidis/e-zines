	If you have a webpage now on a free provider, like geocities or 
tripod, you know the crap you have to go through with popup ads.  They're
annoying, pointless, and your visitors normally get pissed off so much
they never return.  Well worry no more.  There's relatively easy ways to
remove them, although it differs from provider to provider.  Find your 
provider on the list, and if it's not on here, see if you can figure it
out based on where the ad shows up on the page.  I'll have a section at 
the end on it. 

HostWebSite
===========

They stick their popup ads after the </html> on your page.  So, after the
</html>, add a <script language = "Crap">.  This will obviously not cause
anything to show after the tag, but all there is is a javascript with a 
goddamn popup window.

GeoCities *untested, because I've never had a page on there and never plan to
=========

Their popup ad is appended to the end of the document whether you have a 
</html> or not.  You can do the same thing as HostWebSite on removing it.
They have been known to delete pages doing things to remove popup ads, so 
I suggest finding a decent provider.

Tripod *also untested, same reason
======
They put their most annoying advertisement after the <head> tag, so again just
put a dummy <head> tag in or put a script language tag in there and end the tag
the line afterwards.  They have been known to delete pages getting around 
popup ads, so fuck them in the ass with sticks.  Another thing you could possibly
do is write a function in your document before the <html> with the name 
TripodShowPopup and make it do nothing.  That would probably work better as no
one would be the wiser.

I don't remember any others that make popup ads, but if there is, you can either
turn off JavaScript (I personally hate Java applets + JavaScript altogether) or
try to obscure the javascript that is read by either putting another script
language tag so that it doesn't recognize the script and effectively throws its
hands up in the air, or try to get the script put in some comments so that it
doesn't get executed.
