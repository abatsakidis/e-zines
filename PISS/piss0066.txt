Go buy on of those little thingys that you can hook two fone lines
into (you can get them at Wal-Mart or K-Mart for a couple of bucks) 
and get a flathead screwdriver.  Go to one of your enemies houses and 
take a handset with the keypad built in and some fone line.  Next, 
unscrew the little gray fone box and open it up.  Inside you should see 
a little fone line cord hooked in a fone jack.  Unhook the line and put 
the little gray thingy in the empty jack.  Hook the little fone line into 
one of the empty jacks.  Then hook the fone line from the handset into 
the other empty jack and dial away.  For best results get a really long 
line and sit on the street and make your calls or do it at nite.  You can 
even get one of the little gray thingys that has three jacks in it and a 
friend can talk or listen in too.
