I'll admit this idea wasn't mine, but the news was broken to me by
#phreaks on dalnet.  But I wrote the file, nyah nyah nyah.

I heard from someone on dalnet that he tried the 6.114 crystal instead
of the obvious 6.5536/6.5 and that it works, except in a different way.
Instead of using the "*", use the "0" and record the tones that way.  I
have not tested this but I assume this would work because you could base
the tones off of any of the number key tones and change the crystal
accordingly.  So therefore crystals could eventually become almost
interchangeable if someone ever ports crystals to every number tone.

On another tone dialer related note, Radio Shack supposedly is selling
new LCD memory tonedialers, but I have no information about them such as
price/capacity.  I also heard they changed what the crystal looked like,
but I think it is the brown capacitor-looking thing with 3.something on
it.  If you fuck up your tonedialer trying it then I bet you could take
it back to Rat Shack and maybe they wouldn't notice.  Hell, they dont
notice a lot of things.
