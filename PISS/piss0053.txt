Got a guitar laying around?  Don't know how to play it?  Well here's the
answer.  I'm not exactly going to teach you everything there is to know
about guitar, just a few simple and cool sounding songs.

Semi-Charmed Life (Third Eye Blind)
-----------------------------------

This song is alarmingly easy, only took me about 5 minutes to play it
pretty much perfectly.

If you know the way the song goes, the chords are this:

G:

---3
--2-
0---
0---
0---
---3

This is the way to play a G chord, with the high string being the first
string and so forth.  You play all of the strings on this chord.

D:

--2-
---3
--2-
0---
----
----

Only play the first 4 strings.  The part where the guitarist moves up a
notch at the end of the chord makes you slide the first string up to the
3rd fret, making it a Dsus4.

Cadd9:

---3
---3
0---
--2-
---3
----

Play the first five strings.  The Dsus4 to Cadd9 is the hardest chord
change in the entire song, and even then it's not that hard compared to
some other songs.  Just repeat this pretty much all the way through and
there's the rhythm part.


Smoke On The Water
------------------

The guitar part for this is absurdly easy, it can be learned by a non-
musical person or an advanced fish in about a minute.  The riff you hear
all the time is this, played off the bass E string (last string).

--0--3--5----0--3--6-5---0--3--5--3--0

You can substitute that last 0 for a 1, it doesn't matter a whole lot.
I wouldn't worry about any other part in the song except the solo, which
you probably won't be able to play anyway.

I'll add more songs when I find some as easy as this.  Right now I'm
trying to tab "Sweet Home Alabama" by Lynyrd Skynyrd.  It's harder than
both of these, but it's still pretty easy.
