WHAT IS PHREAKING?
------------------

For those of you who have been living in caves for the past 25 years, 
phreaking is the skill or art (damn right it's an art!) of messing with 
the phone company.  If you want the "real" definition, go look it the 
hell up.

THINGS TO DO
------------

There are many cool easy ways to have fun with the phone company.  There 
are boxes which can give free calls, become lineman's handsets (tap into 
phone lines), make yourself an operator (sorta) to get free calls, and harass 
dumb people.

RED BOXING
----------

Red boxing involves a box (for me, a Radio Shit tone dialer), which produces 
tones that simulate coins being dropped in a pay phone.  There are several 
easy ways to do this, with the best being to go buy a tone dialer WITH 
MEMORY from Radio Shit and also order a 6.5536 MHz crystal.  The tone dialer 
will set you back $25 and the crystal is about $4, but they will pay for 
themselves over time.  The employees are dumb and will look at you like 
you have 13 heads.  Tell them that you are not making this up and to give 
you a goddamn crystal.  It's even better to work there and just loot the 
store (duh).  Take the back off with your screwdriver (you HAVE a 
screwdriver don't you?  you should!) and look inside.  You'll see a thing 
that looks vaguely like the crystal you bought.  Unsolder that and jam the 
6.5536 crystal in there (and don't break it dumbass!).  Now take the memory 
buttons (DON'T TELL ME YOU GOT THE WRONG ONE!) and program them like this:

P1, *, *, *, *, *.  This is a tone for a quarter.
P2, *, *.  This is the dime tone.
P3, *.  This is the nickel tone.

My red box has two settings on it, which can easily be made by getting a 
SPST switch and connecting wires which go from one crystal to the other 
so if I have it one way it's a red box and if I flip it the other way it's 
a regular tone dialer.  The regular dialer comes in handy if you get busted 
or if you get a COCOT phone (more on that later).

Now to get this to work right you gotta find a Bell phone.  If you see a 
phone but it's not a Bell one, it's a COCOT.  You can phreak COCOTs or just 
break them.  I like phreaking the one at my school.  When you get a Bell 
phone, dial your number, but for the red box to work, you either have to 
go through the operator or dial it as a long distance call.  To dial any 
call as a long distance call add 10288.  This is good, except that damn 
recording butts in every 3 minutes asking for more money.  Also, it is a 
good idea to not say that you are phreaking the call because some 
operators are nosy and listen in on the conversation.  I can tell by 
now if someone else is on the line so I don't worry about it, but for 
you dummies out there just don't say anything.  To go through the 
operator, dial 0, and say something like "The keypad's bashed in and 
the 4 and 8 are stuck."  Be creative.  Don't use this one cause it's 
MINE!  Then when the operator asks you for money, use the keypad.  
Some operators pick up on this and say something like "I'm Getting 
Security!"  Normally they are full of shit.  But if you see pigs (cops) 
or hear sirens, get ready to run, especially if you've done a lot of 
boxing from that phone.  

Now call anyone you want to call in the world (I like calling Singapore 
to talk to my friends and to harass my former employer ;) ).  It's all 
FREE!!!  Thanks to phone company stupidity.

BLUE BOXING
-----------

Even though I have one, I haven't blue boxed yet only because I know 
people who got busted for doing it, and they only did it once or twice.  
So when I change cities in two years, I'll start blue boxing.  For now, 
I recommend going to any decent hack site and getting Better Homes and 
Blue Boxing.  Read it.  Also get the plans because they're too long to 
fit on here without leeching them AND LEECHING ISN'T RIGHT!! 

[Commented update: that hasn't stopped me it seems]

BEIGE BOXING
------------

Beige boxing is also called using a lineman's handset.  A linesman's 
handset is a phone with alligator clips which lets you tap into a 
phone line and use it for free calls.  I don't do this much either 
because I'm real lazy, but if you want to become a good phreak learn 
how to.  I recommend getting the plans for the box and reading any 
manuals you can find on it.  Sometimes in phone company manholes there 
are lineman's handset manuals (Bonus!) and you should be able to take 
these along with the handset and beige box until you get busted or you're 
tired of harassing dumb people (never).

COCOT PHONES
------------

COCOT stands for Customer Owned Coin Operated Telephones.  Why do 
businesses (especially hotels) use these?  One word: money.  
Businesses normally get a cut of these profits, so it's real fun to 
screw them out of money or even rob the phone (I don't advise doing this).  
To screw the COCOTs, you can either do something with a paper clip in the 
mouthpiece???? (didn't work when I tried it) or you can do it the easy way.  
For this all you need is your trusty tone dialer (not the red box) and an 
IQ slightly higher than one of a houseplant.  COCOTs operate by producing 
a fake dialtone loop which means you cannot just dial your call through the 
operator because you don't have a dialtone.  But ALL telephones MUST let 
you call 800 numbers for phree.  Dial ANY 800 number (I use 1-800-4-GO-BAJA, 
a number of some Mexican answering machine, or if I can't remember that, 
then use 1-800-LOAN-YES), and get them to hang up.  This is the real fun 
part because you can yell and scream at the person on the other end and 
call them all kinds of nasty names (I like pretending like I'm ordering 
at a drive through) and then letting them hang up.  Now you have a real 
dialtone.  Dial your call using your tone dialer, because the lame-ass 
"security features" consist of turning off the keypad.  Hell, I don't 
use it anyways.  

However, some newer phones cut back into that loop when the phone hears 
a dialtone.  Hiss into the speaker trying to mask the sound or start 
dialing your number VERY quickly.  It's weird hearing this guy in the 
cafeteria hissing into the phone with his girlfriend laughing her ass off 
next to him because he pissed of some Mexican operator by saying "eat shit 
and die, whore" (come mierda y muere, puta).  For some reason she finds 
this extremely funny.  So don't look like some kind of stupid fuck when 
you do this.  If you've done it right, then you have a dialtone and you can 
keep dialing with your tone dialer.  Mwaaaaahahaha!!!!!  Or, if you're 
too cheap even for a tone dialer, you can simulate pulse dialing with 
clicking that little lever that's pushed when you hangup.  1 click is 1, 
2 rapid clicks are two, and so on.

Sometimes the phone company figures it out and calls the number you dialed, 
so make sure you can trust the guy on the other end.  The calls normally 
sound like this:

Dumbass operator (DO):  "Hello.  I'm calling about a call you recieved on 
8/8/97 from Saratoga, New York."

Cool Guy:  "What call?  I don't know anyone.  Go to hell."

Dumbass motherfucker:  "Yeah, his name is Defenestrator, want his address?"

That's the real basics of red box and COCOT phreaking.  When I get more 
stuff on blue boxing and beige boxing, I'll make another damn file.
