[If you've become familiar with this series, you'll know that anything
in brackets is Defenestrator's.  I have never heard of this group or any
of these people, and they look rather lame to me.  If you want to bomb
the hell out of them go right ahead, although talk to Wu first because I
don't know why he wanted me to post this.  i think he used to be with
them but left.  Oh well.  -Def]

                     Shadows Enterprises Hackers

If any of these are wrong please contact WuForever or Defenestrator.
I'll try to fix them ASAP
