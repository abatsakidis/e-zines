Well, I was at work the other day and where I work, for some weird
reason there are lots and lots and lots of vending machines.  So I
figured I'd put all my vending machine knowledge into one of these
philez.  Bah.  Now that I've bullshitted enough, I'll start.

Coke Machines
-------------

Grench already wrote an issue on this, but he said to use duct tape.  I
use packing tape because it's easier and as long as you get all the air
bubbles out of the tape I've had no problems.  

Those machines you get gumballs out of
--------------------------------------

What you do is to get a lot of styrofoam cups.  Cut the bottom out of
them, and place a quarter on top of the cut-out bottom.  Cut around the
quarter so that you have a quarter shaped piece (duh).  Now go stick it
in the vending machine.  You probably have to turn real hard to get it
to work, but it should.  And for those newer machines like they have
some of at my work, you need to put in one quarter, turn the handle, and
then put in another quarter.  For this kind of machine I put in a real
quarter first (oh shit i spent some money), and then stick the styrofoam
quarter in next.  Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't.

Candy Bar Machines
------------------

There are two good ways to mess with these.  First, some machines have
holes in the top which let you stick something such as a coathanger
through.  If you have good dexterity, you can move the coathanger around
and get some free munchies.  Another way is to find a candy machine
which takes dollar bills and get an eyedropper full of salt water.  I've
only heard about this, never done it.  Squeeze the salt water into the
dollar slot.  This will fuck up the machine but it should release some
grub.  This is supposed to work on Coke machines too, but still, I am
not positive of this.

EOF Crap
--------

Yes, this wasnt very long.  If you have another type of machine you want
ripped, just mail me at defen@sdf.lonestar.org and i'll get back to you.
Bah.
