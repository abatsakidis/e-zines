For those of you who are stupid or just new to the phreaking world, OCI
is the dumbest long distance company there is.  Their number is 
1-800-288-2880 (1-800-ATT-ATT0) and they try to fool you into thinking 
that you get AT&T's rates for phone service.  Bull shit.  They charge 
exorbitant amounts of money for a simple intrastate call (I third-party 
billed this to someone and they complained....for 5 minutes it was like
$7.50...DAMN!).  Their operators dropped out of school in second grade
and the only training they got was how to press button 1 for "yo mama" 
jokes (more on this later).

So me and the only other hacker in this shit town (yes the same one in
the Office Depot one in #17) decided to just annoy the hell out of the
operators, which is what most people do.  I have heard that up to 50% of
the calls they get are from "hackers" which is what they call phreaks,
but since they have the intelligence of dead trees they never know this,
even after we explained to them at great length, and then they said "yo
mama".  The fun thing about OCI is that they are the ONLY 800 company
which cannot get your ANI (I've been told they have it now, but they'd
probably just call you back and yell "yo mama" at you.).

NOTE TO DUMB SHITS: ANI is the phone number you're calling from.  I
could go into more detail, but it's not necessary here.

It used to be that you could call from your house and op-divert (using
one collect call company to call another and THEN call the number) using
OCI.  But since they SUPPOSEDLY have ANI, be safe and call from a pay
fone.

It used to be that you could call them up and spoof your ANI because
they couldn't get it from the fone.  They asked you what number you were
calling from and I just said an enemies number and they took it.  I then
harassed the hell out of the ops (maybe I'll get sound clips).

There are some good OCI sound clip pages out there, so if you want to go
to all of the ones I know of first go to http://www.phonelosers.org ,
the home of the PLA.  These were the guys who told me about OCI and that
led to lots of fun at the ops expense.  

There's one guy who I think still works for OCI, named Kevin, that
sounds like he likes small animals.  The first time I heard his voice, I
nearly pissed myself laughing so hard.  It looks funny when you walk by
a pay fone and you see some guy rolling around on the ground, out of
breath laughing.  I bet lots of people thought I was deranged.  Ah, what
do I care what people think?

Sometimes you can also tell the operator what you're doing (like red
boxing) and she'll STILL put the call through because she's stupid.
Like one time I heard of RBCP (RedBoxChiliPepper of the PLA) telling
the op that he was calling with a red box and the op said that "Is that
a Private Telco? (meaning a telco can)"  I thought that was fucking 
hilarious.  If you don't get it then eat my shit.

It's fun to just make the operator quit his/her job by harrassing the
hell out of them for several hours at a time.  Some days (okay...most
days) I have absolutely nothing to do, so I go down to where I used to
work and go to the pay fone outside and dial up OCI.  I have devised a
point system that me and my friend use for OCI operators....

5 points - "Operator Leaving Line"

10 points - "Yo Mama"

20 points - "Go Suck A Dick"

50 points - If you get a supervisor

100 points - If you make them cry

I get a lot of points by getting op leaving line and yo mama a lot.
I've never actually made an op cry but I think Kevin was about to once.
It's also fun to 3-way in OCI operators when you're teleconferencing for
free (that's another file...damn i'm swamped) and then harass the hell
out of them.  It's brightened up lots of my days.

Shit, well I forgot the central point of this file because I left town
for a week and forgot what the hell I was doing.  I'll probably update
this file sometimes so watch for it.
