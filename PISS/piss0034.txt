I've been getting mails (one or two mails, but they're still mails)
about how I haven't put out a file lately.  Blah Blah Blah.  Well here
it is.  I've been real busy, and this is the last thing on my mind right
now....well maybe not...hehe.  Ok enough rambling bullshit.

I hope other members will write this crap about themselves just to get
the readers (okay...reader) to get to know us a little bit better.  But
who the hell would want to know us?  Not me.

Name - Defenestrator

Age - Yeah right

City - Charlotte, NC

School - Winthrop College

Web Sites - The one on the footer below, and my own page, 
http://members.tripod.com/~Defenestrator/index.html

EMail - defenestrator@hotmail.com, and davematthews@rocketmail.com
Note to stupid people - Dave Matthews is not my real name.  It's the
name of the band I rip off.

Hobbies - All this shit in the philez, harrassing my boss, playing 
guitar in my band, web site design business, and of course, sleeping.  A
lot.

Things he does when he's bored - Plays HardBall 5 or NBA Live 97, goes
out and makes fun of OCI, sleeps, and writes this crap.

Girlfriend - Used to have one until she said to keep away from the
phones.  Uh-oh.  Big Mistake...heehee.

Job - I have one.  Like I'm gonna say where I work.  

Questions People ask me -

Yes, some people ask me questions, so I'm not just making this up.  Bah!


Can you hack?

That's not as easy a question as it seems.


Can you teach me to hack?

Read file #6.  Then get back to me.


Well okay, then can you do this for me?

No.  Do your own stuff.  Read.  Learn.  That way you don't have to bug
the hell out of me.


What does your handle mean?

For those of you without functioning brains, my handle means, "One who
throws people and things out windows."


Well I'm kinda tired and running low on ideas.  Maybe when I'm bored
again I'll write some more of this.  Sure I will..
