Well, the Gibisonites that wrote the TORGverse into brief existence weren't the 
foretellers they probably imagined they were.  There never was a cyberchurch in 
cyberspace.  Well. Then again I don't know.  It's possible that on some server 
somewhere, deep in the net, that virtual congregations gather and hold text-
based masses.  They all sing and recite, hundreds hooked into the same huge chat 
session, some mighty old VAX resounding with the ascii echoes of a thousand 
scrolling hosannas.  Who knows?  There's more ludicrous things.
Everything I've seen suggests that real-time religion is no more than people who 
are so bored at work or nite-lifeless that the only way they feel alive is if 
they're hooked into IRC's Unitarian lobby.  These are like IRC versions of those 
pot-luck after sermon gatherings except without the casserole.  When VMRL takes 
over in the lala future where there are microtitian processors and infinite 
aceses rates and terabyte storage fits in your pocket maybe then somebody'll 
erect a digital cathedral.  This theological pioneer would certainty attract a 
congregation as the IRC God-jockeys and the PTL CRT-thumpers are proof that 
large groups of people can guilt themselves into anything.
Do I sound self-righteous or what?  I get the feeling these people imagine that 
they're patronizing Satan when they talk to me. It's really kind of sad.  Funny 
at the time though.

This is my tete-a-tete with Mik the Christian.  I met him on Praise_His_Name or 
somesuch channel.  I was wondering aloud if someone would help me blow-up a 
nonexistent abortion-clinic when he msg'd me.  What a hot topic I had used to 
bait my hook!  Mik tired to be a good sport about being had, kind of like a 
tourist that smiles about being took by the card sharp but the tourist is 
usually good natured because the man behind the card table might have a knife in 
his coat. 
Mik was just stupid.  I got him pretty worked up by the end because he was 
typing too intently to notice that I was breaking my statements into two lines.


Attempting to establish DCC session...

<mik^^^> hey... you might want to think about getting a life.... later fool!
DCC Session Closed

So mik left me. 

This shit gets kinda boring after awhile, at least Alec_Empire empire says so.  
Me, I never tire of baiting Christians.  Some'll kick you like a vicious 
Chihuahua, others'll pretend they don't hear you. Maybe I'm sick.  Maybe I 
really am Satan.  I keep asking people if they think I HE and they keep telling 
me "no".  I guess disguise is one of Satan's greatest virtues.

That's It for this file.  If I save any more Christian-baiting IRC logs I'll 
circulate them around.
