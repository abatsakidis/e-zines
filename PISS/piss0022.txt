AT&T has never been known as a source of money.  Well, it can be if you
have half a brain.  Let me explain.

Sometimes when regular people use payphones, the connection gets stuck
or they lose all their money somehow.  There has to be a way to get this
money back though.  AT&T has set up a coin refund department so that
they can give this money back.  But what if you just want some money?
You get to bullshit the op into giving it to you and pretending you
actually did lose some money.  Here goes.

ME: Hello, I was making a call overseas and I put in my ten dollars and
then I got cut off and the fone wouldn't give me my money back.

Dumb Op: Okay, where can we send your check?

Now don't be alarmed...give out your real address and name...because you
need to cash the check right?

Me: My name is Defenestrator, and I live at 41 (41's my basketball number
..and Glen Rice's too!) DumbOperator Lane.

Op: How much did you lose again?

Me: Ten dollars.

Op: Okay thank you very much (hangup).

Now you have ten dollars..enough to buy a CD if you don't lift
(shoplift) one.  Don't do this a whole lot or they'll send you notices
that say "we have been notcing lots of refunds blah blah blah" and you
might have to actually throw them out because they're cluttering your
mailbox.
