Quote of the week: "I wish I had a baseball bat the size of Rhode 
Island so I could beat the shit out of this stupid-ass planet."
  - Cheese from Milk and Cheese (get it it kicks ass)

I need some better art so just shut the hell up.  I can't draw worth 
crap.

I wuz doing stuph earlier today and thought..hey, why not start PISS 
Philez?  What the hell do I care?  So.....I'm going to provide a forum 
for our members and friends of mine to put their shit where everyone 
can see it.  And if you don't want to see it, Blow me.

I'm gonna use these philez for everything from hacking to stories and 
stuff.

Enough pathetic rambling, ON WITH THE GODDAMN FILE!

Today's Topic: Killer Ping and WinNuke

WARNING:  This file is for information only.  If you use this to do 
anything stupid, then the author, his friends, family, or anyone he 
knows cannot be held responsible.  Plus, you're just dumb if you do 
these lame methods of bringing a system down and get caught.  Even 
though these methods don't screw the hard drive over, it's still 
illegal.

I'm doing this completely from memory so it might not be 100% 
accurate.  If I find stuff that's wrong I'll change it.

KILLER PING
-----------

The killer ping method is widely used among newbies and lamers to 
bring down some Linux and Windoze systems.  It's some bug in the 
operating system which takes all the ping responses and overloads the 
connection, crashing the machine.  A good sysop would have 
updated the kernel by now, but you'd be surprised how many haven't.  
The fun thing about killer ping is that if you're a lamer or you don't 
have your own comp, then you can do it from Windoze.  

Killer pings:

ping -n 9999999999999 IP#

(In this method, 9999999999999 should be substituted with the largest 
number ping will take, which I think is 65510.  I don't use this one 
anyway, but since I'm doing this off the top of my head it's the first 
one I remembered.)

This method takes the 99999999999999 as the number of requests to be 
sent, and the program sends them as fast as it can.  

ping -t IP#

This pings the host until interrupted.  'Nuff said.

ping -l 65510 IP#

This sends a 65K buffer to your mark, slowing his connection a lot (he 
thinks it's for no reason).  It's cool to write a batch file that does 
these things over and over again, but I haven't found some way to 
input the IP directly besides editing the program.  If I ever cared 
enough to finish then it'll go up.

If none of these work, then maybe you're fucking stupid or the 
timeout is too long.  You can change the timeout by adding [-w 
timeout] at the end of the string where timeout is the number of 
milliseconds to wait for a reply.  Set this real low so more packets 
go out faster.  Duh.

WinNuke
-------

What the program does is connect to port 139 on the computer to be 
attacked, and sends out-of-Bounds) packets until the machine memory is 
eaten up and the computer has to be restarted.  Oh damn.  This works 
on all the Windoze OS's and it don't work for good OS's like Linux or 
Unix.  Stupid asses on IRC do this all the time, and since I'm too lazy 
to get them back sometimes, I just patch Win95 over with a patch you 
can get on the (oh no!) MicroShit site.  This will hopefully be the 
only time you ever use this site because MSIE sucks dick.  


If you plan on becoming a serious hacker, the only reason to get it is 
to take it apart for the source code.  Or just get the damn C++ source 
code somewhere.  And if you don't use C++, you're a fucking loser.  
LEARN IT!!  Look through it to see how the programmer set up the OOB 
packets and you can now add something to it (if you're not dumb).  

That's the lame way of taking down systems for now.

If you want to talk shit then e-mail me at defenestrator@hotmail.com
please..no discussion of hacking because hotmail has sniffers
