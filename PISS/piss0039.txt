[ phanop's comments in brackets, cause he's 3r33t ]

{Def's comments in braces, because he's the one publishing it f00l :)}

Well, I show up on IRC one day, and phanop tells me that he can exploit
a Dalnet hole to go channel fuxxoring with.  I think, cool.  So he says
he'll go hack a channel, for example, #nolifers.  #Nolifers is a lame
ass channel with just a  lone person normally in it.  So phanop exploits
his hole and becomes the founder.  Feer.

[ muahahahahaahahahaha.  dalnet was written by a drunk 12-year-old ]

So then we have a discussion with this loser and go through the normal
process of saying we 0wn them, and making her come to #bbb and say fruity
things.  We do this all the time.

But I'm not here to show some IRC logs, here's how to do it.
Some of you with brains know how to do this already, so if you know this
then don't read it.  

[ i figured this out by making an ident clone of ChowMein and pissing
  everyone off as him, and then i found that i was AOP in #f00fy. 
  so i like tried it on other channels and it worked and stuff ]

DA SHIT!
--------

First, do a /who *.your.fucking.isp.here

Then look at the character right after the H.  Is it a @?  Now you've
narrowed some channels down.  Then look at that person's IDENTD.
Remember it.  Now disconnect from dalnet, and then reconnect with their
ident.  Go into that channel they were in.  If they're an AOP or SOP,
then that's what you are now.  If they're just a normal op, then you're
screwed.  Instead of going to the channel, you can /msg chanserv access
#putdachannelhere .

[ if you can't type fast, i'd suggest making macros for this shit ]

The hole mainly exploits a Dalnet way of maintaining the AOP/SOP list.
It will mark the beginning part of the ISP whois (or the end, depending
on how you look at it) and the ident.  So if you're on their ISP, you 
got it.  It sucks that my ISP has like 6 clients, and I can't do any 
channel hacking.  That and I can't evade a kline very well because they
provider ban me.  

[ actually, this hole can be countered with two methods, adding AOP/SOPs
  by registered nicks and by setting the IDENTIFY mode on the channel ]

Now once you have their channel you can pretty much do anything you
want.  It's a good idea not to kick/ban them because they can always
come back in if they're an aop/sop.  A lot of people will go complain to
an IRCop, and then you'll probably get killed or klined.  (Speaking of 
that, Logic is going to have a /kill Hall of Fame when his #bbb page 
goes up.  Watch for it.  I've got my logs edited out and it's pretty
funny.)  That's why it's a good idea to have more than 1 dialup.  Phanop
has an aol dialup, and there's a whole shitload of people on aol.  So 
that makes for a lot of channel hacking.  If you do get klined, you can
always beg back in (LAME!!!) or if you're on a big ISP, change your 
identd.  There is also a telnet client for the very desperate that sucks
pretty bad, telnet.dal.net  .  Java IRC clients are also out, but I've
never used one that works.

[ if you takeover a channel, like def said, never kick them.  all you have
to do if you get kicked is type /msg ChanServ UNBAN #channel ME
(make sure to type ME, not your nick here)
and thats what they do.  if you need an invite, type /msg ChanServ 
INVITE #channel phanop (or your nick)

to fuck with them more, delete their aop lists by going through
/msg ChanServ AOP #channel DEL [x] where x starts at 1 and keeps going
until you get a message saying that is not a valid aop entry.  make sure
not to delete yourself!!! 

if you have founder or SOP access, you can hold the channel longer by
logging in as a founder/SOP, and creating a new chat client window with
a different IDENTD, and then adding an AOP from your founder account to
your new client.  say you have Iamdumb@place.org as a founder account
with the nick phanop0wnzm3.  open another client, but change your IDENTD
to iamdumber so you have iamdumber@place.org with a nick such as 
phanop1sg0d.  then from the phanop0wnzm3 (founder) window, type 
/msg ChanServ AOP #channel ADD phanop1sg0d, and use phanop1sg0d to
fuck with them.  when they delete your aop, use your founder/SOP account
to get another aop account, and they will ph34r yer skillz ]

And something else I haven't mentioned yet.  To evade klines or glines,
which you will get a lot of if you do this, change your ident.  Klines
normally wear off after a while, so it's not a big problem.  But if they
provider ban you, which they do to me alot, then you can look for a Java
IRC client if you want to bitch at the ops or you really just want to
IRC.  Also, you can telnet to telnet.dal.net but the SmallIRC telnet
client sucks.  You can also get shells or something or ask someone else
with a Linux box to let you IRC from there.  Coo', Slap Mah Fro.

Shameless Plug Section:

For IRC logs of this stuff you can either contact phanop at
phanop@hotmail.com or me at defen@sdf.lonestar.org

[ i may have a homepage soon, but not now ]

And I lied, here are two of the best fruity messages we got.

<Lady-Salem> *ahem* "I am 0wn3d by phanop, Defenestrator, Logic Box
and SysFail, I have a cute bucketass, and I am a cum-guzzling gutter slut"

<Lady-Salem> what do I have to do to own myself again? fuck all your friends?

Ok, well have fun channel fuxxoring, we sure do!  Slap Mah Fro!  What it
is, my man! (from ebonics.irc)

Special hello to those in DC who live in SC, j00 know who you are.
At is going to get you.  hehe.
