are welcome to put the names of people they want fucked in these

these people and just generally having fun.

    This guy
phucked me out of a pretty big amount of  $$.Was supposed to do a website for me
in a trade-out type of agreement.He didn't hold up his end of the bargain.

These
guys are just a bunch of  radio-wannabe losers.They fired me because I wouldn't
play their little "political" games.Then hired a d00d with absolutely NO
experience & an accent so thick that he should've been the poster child for
Hooked on Phonics!! Their dumbass engineers keep the place running by means of
gum wrappers & duct tape.  A bud of mine at ApTel installed their fone sys.  I even
have a schematic if needed.

#3:Billy Ray Reece III
No info on this guy.I just
hate the bastard!!  He disappeared when I came back to this area & beat the living
shit out of him.If anybody knows how to locate this FUCK-UP,please let me know.

Well,that's it for the first installment of my personal shit list.I'm sure that
it will be appended quite often as the dickweeds around here continue to PISS me
off and take advantage of my "generous" side.

I'm working on the E-mail
and/or homepage for WTNJ.I dunno if they have either but if they do,I'll let
everyone know.
