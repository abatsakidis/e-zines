I've been IRC'ing a lot lately, and found that harassing people is the
most fun thing on there so far.  Now most of it is just us being our
normal asshole selves, annoying the hell out of people and telling them
to come to our channel and say all kinds of stupid things.  I'm just
gonna print some logs and say some easy (and semi-lame) ways to either
make people mad or just kick people off IRC...hehe.

In DALnet, #dragonrealm is where all the IRCops are.  So one day we
decided to go in there and just make fun of them and pretend like we
were real stupid, which we can be :)

Here's me, Absinthum, Tannestt, Puppetmaster, and Portentia (#bbb 
people) messing with moronic ops.

Session Start: Sat Sep 27 19:46:16 1997
<Puppetmaster> this guy named Ace22 said he was gonna hack me
<Puppetmaster> and give me a virus that kills my computer
*** Now talking in #dragonrealm
<Prez> and dont accept anyhting form him.
<Puppetmaster> BUT IM GONNA GET HACKED!!!
<Puppetmaster> hes an evil hacker
*** Absinthum (gerbil@serialcon9.cyberannex.com) has joined #dragonrealm
<Absinthum> hey could you l33t0 IRCOPS teach me how to haxx0r??!@#!@
<Puppetmaster> hes gonna mess up my computer
*** Absinthum (gerbil@serialcon9.cyberannex.com) has joined #dragonrealm
*** Absinthum (gerbil@serialcon9.cyberannex.com) has joined #dragonrealm
*** Absinthum was kicked by Buddha (no)
<Tannestt> I am being harrassed by someone saying they are going to rape me
<Puppetmaster> YES HE WILL
<Puppetmaster> hes a genius
<Puppetmaster> hes gonna hack me
<Prez> Puppet: one last time: ignore - dont accept.
<Defenestrator> his name is r0y g3rbil..and he wants my hamster!
<Tannestt> I am being harrassed by someone saying they are going to rape me
<Raskah> puppet if he hacks you, contact your ISP
<Tannestt> This is very upsetting
<Raskah> tannestt do /ignore nick 3
<Defenestrator> Go fuck yourself raskah, you couldn't do shit about it
Session Close: Sat Sep 27 19:49:40 1997

Absinthum got akicked from there for just saying that...heh.  Those
people in #dragonrealm just tell you to ignore the people that you
complain against.  I said that last part and then got out of there,
because another time I spammed a URL ONCE and they kicked me off dalnet
and made me reconnect.  So I sent them a text flood..hehe.

This next one is just me being an asshole, and the channel was so boring
that I left after I said this, and phanop couldn't go backdoor and take
it over..heh

Session Start: Sun Sep 28 20:35:54 1997

-Gamaliel- Welcome to #mormon. This is a clean chat room. Please enjoy your stay.

Not very fun to read I know, but it sure was fun to do.  

This one was Faraz (aka Zer0-hex), a lamer who ripped a bunch of h/p
files and called them his own.  This guy was a loser to the extreme.

PISS, the author, and anyone else does not take responsibility for what
you do with the stuph contained in this phile.  If you get busted, 
don't cry to us.  We don't care.

Want more stuph?  Go to http://www.angelfire.com/sc/PISS/philez.html
The site will change as soon as I get money for one..
