Disclaimer: This may or may not be illegal.  If it is, then PISS, 
me, or anyone I know doesn't take responsibility.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

The ultimate goal in my life is to get everything I can for free.  
Whenever CompUSA here has some large sale in which they give away 
free disks, I go buy hundreds.  But this is not the free disk method 
I'm talking about.  That one deals with rebates and stuff.  I'm too 
lazy to fill those out.  So I use my innate natural talent of 
bullshitting.  Now that I probably bumped this file to 1K worth of 
shit, I'll tell ya how to get free disks.

FREE DISKS (AND SCREWING AOL)
-----------------------------

You know those disks AOL gives out with their system software on it?  
I have gotten these with MAD Magazine, Sports Illustrated, and even 
on Delta Airlines.  Since AOL sucks so much, I reformatted these disks 
and stuck stuff on them.  Then it hit me: if I could get like 500 of 
these things I never need disks again.  So I called up that number on 
the box which said to order or something like that.  I plainly stated 
that I was part of some large company and wanted AOL in my office.  I 
told them to send 100 Mac Disks, 100 Win3.1 Disks, 250 Win95 Disks, 
and they said they could.  So I waited.  It's best to get a P.O. Box 
for this so they don't get your real address (duh).  And then one day 
I discovered a big fucking package from AOL.  I got my free disks.  
Now I am storing info on them, using them as coasters, etc.  You too 
can get this.  Just call the AOL service number (damn if I know what 
it is) and bullshit them into giving you free disks.

There are plenty of phone numbers to call for this other than AOL 
(thanks to the PLA and RedBoxChiliPepper for these)
