Department and Retail Store Opportunities

<HEADER>
y0y0y0 and shit.  This file is a guide to getting things you need out
of department and retail stores.  There are all sorts of useful, fun,
and interesting things in these great places.

There are two different positions you can be in to use this information,
you can be a casual "shopper", or an employee.  Methods of information
retrieval for both positions are discussed.

At first I discuss more "general interest" stores, but things get more
interesting when I dive into more specific interest stores.

I am not responsible for anything you do, I am not advocating any
of this material, I have not done any of this (heh), I will not
do any of this, You shouldn't, God loves you, etc., etc., blah.

/* Shop til' you drop! */

Ok, we assume now that you are in the position of most of us, just 
a shopper.  In a departmental/retail store setting, this makes you 
God (well, actually, The Boss is more important than you... but you 
get the idea).  Employees will go out of their way to make you feel
welcome (unless they are just itching to loose their jobs).

Anyway, unless you're there to pick up some shampoo or food for 
your old disabled granny, you should pick something that you wish
to obtain.  If you really have no clue about all the neat things
that stores have, then I'll help you out, but bum-fuck Texas
isn't known for its extreme diverseness in stores, and your mileage
may vary.

/* Attention k-mart shoppers... */

I like to get a paging directory for those bigger stores such as
Walmart and HEB.  It's very easy to accomplish this, Walmart pastes
them by their phones that are strewn all over the building (unattended
of course), and HEB puts them behind employee desks.  Well, go to HEB
during off hours (in the morning, about 10am on a week day especially,
it's frightening, nothing but a few old folks wandering around), and
just help yourself.  I wouldn't recommend just taking the whole 
directory, but you can if you want.  You can also find things such
as manager beeper/cellular numbers.   fun4all!  Annoy people with
your newly obtained knowledge, calling and getting transferred to
the instore P.A. system is always fun.

/* the k0d3z ab0d3 */

I ran into this sort of thing at JcPenny and Weirs, behind their counters
they have the access codes to their automated 1-800-number credit checkers
(most stores now, however, use those neat little machines).  Anyway,
if you run across an older store, you'll most likely be able to pick
something of that sort up.

Go to the cash registers.  Many registers leave the "carbon copy" tape
in plain site.  Feel free to get some credit card numbers for your
personal use.  This will include the name, number, and expiry on the
card.  no-fun4yourvictims.  You can also look in wastebaskets for these,
but no-one is really desperate for k0d3z anymore, except weirdos like
me that would rather run up some poor losers credit card bill than use
his redbox at a payphone.

/* mommy, look at that man fixing the electric wires! */  

Something I'm planning on doing this summer...  Many stores now have
a neato-dorrito computerized inventory system.  Look around for their
computer room.  Two level stores (such as Fry's Electronics, and HEB)
have the bottom shopper level, and have management (and loss prevention)
stuff upstairs.  Computer rooms are obviously off-limits, but look
at those little wires running out of the rooms.  Most stores use 
10-base-T networking...  I hope you can see the possibility for some
serious fun here.   (attention k-mart shoppers, there is currently
a 69% discount on all items, run as quickly as possible to the registers
before our manager has a stroke and fires the computer guy...)

Ok... I pretty much covered all the fun things you can do out regular
stores that normal people hang out in... Let's move on

/* Do you want MMX with that Pentium II, sir? */

The wonderful world of computer stores!!!  Oh my, oh my.  Anyway,
more fun things to do here.  There are two major types of computer
stores now, the ones that "make it" (big stores), and the ones that
don't (bum-fuck stores).  Going to a local bum-fuck store is where
you get your most opportunities for fun.  We'll use the name 
"Hillbilly-Bob's Computer Sto'", just an example of course ;)

First thing to do at Hillbilly's is check out the place.  More than
likely, they have NO shoplifting protection at all, except all the
expensive merchandise is "in sight".  Having a friend tie up the
phone lines to keep the main fool busy, and another friend keep 
the salesperson busy, means plenty of fearless shoplifting for you!
(I have done this, it works wonderfully).  

Loot their trash.  The local store around my area puts their trash
outside for the night, to be picked up in the morning.  Notice that
since computer people rarely have a life, trash is filled with nothing
but GOODIES...  I've seen dumbfuck technicians throw out working
video cards, hard drives, even a 24-port Ethernet hub!  (The only
problem with it was that the power supply was not included, so
they threw it out.  The power supply was retrieved at Radio Shack
for about $15).  Steal their trash.  You will also find credit card
receipts (even though they have those machines, Novus requires carbon's
to be filled out also... bahahaha), and more.  Faxes with valuable
"sources" (which are the places that these people buy from, usually
you can find dirt cheap stuff listed in these), and quotes (undersell
the expensive bastards) abound.  

/* My phone can smack your phone like a bitch! */

Cellular booths!  Found in many Kroger and Walmart stores, and standalone
stores.  Whoopee!!  One of my most favorito places to "visit".  Steal
all their trash.  Laugh as you now have more ESN/MIN pairs than Kevin Mitnick
ever had in his sorry life.  Chuckle as you find access codes to their
databases, dance as you find "bad" forms filled out with customer 
information, especially Social Security Number and billing information.
Snort as you find old phone debug mode manuals.  Also, make friends with
the nice lady that sells it.  Wait till she goes on her break, and steal
all her stored phones.  Fun4all-but-the-cellular-carrier!

/* Does porn come free with this? */

Internet companies!  Although most sell over the phone, both times that
I have bought Internet access, I've had to GO someplace and fill out forms
and get software.  Loot their trash :) (are you sensing a pattern here).
Sneak past the secretary and steal their files.  Run into server
room and do a "echo roy::0:0:Roy:/:/bin/sh >> /etc/passwd" (or if they
run NT, do a format c:).  Generally own them and make them wish they'd
given you access for free.

/* I'll get right on it, Boss */

Oh... so you WORK at one of these esteemed establishments.  Ok, well,
thats good.  This means you can get away with more crap since you 
know what kind of security they have.  Just some ideas to expand on...

Steal their customer database, steal their internet/network related
stuff, steal their credit card info, steal from the register, steal
their merchandise, you get the idea :)

For more complicated things besides being a sticky-fingers, if you
work at a computer store, break all the computers you "fix" and build,
and then after you break a bunch, leave, start your own business, call
those poor folks, and tell them that you can guranteed, fix their computers.
This works pretty well as I hear from one of my friends, but I haven't
done it personally.

If you love notoriety, or being in the paper, messing around with your
store's normal operation can get you there.  Working at HEB would make
my little 69% discount scam a little easier, etc.  Just use that gray
matter that God supposedly gave you.

<APPENDIX>
Well, since you got here I guess you actually read my article.  Thanks,
you made me feel real happy.  Email me at phanop@hotmail.com for
questions/comments, etc.

If you really did like this, you might want to read my P.I.S.S article
(http://piss.home.ml.org) entitled "Mindless Phone Tricks".  I'm
planning on writing a computer based article on something, but I don't
have any good topics floating around my brain right now :)

Stay safe, most of this is just annoying, but you could get raped in
the ass by a horrible quasi-female District Attorney. 

Peace out,
  Phantom Operator
