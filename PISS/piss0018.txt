Ripping Off Change Machines By::::

Grenchant X. Rother & Cherg Rother




First get a buck (American money) and make it real flat
...Put it under alot of books....then get two pieces of 
duct tape (duct tape is the best) and put it on veryyy
close to the edge as close as you can get it..but make
sure that its not to close or the dollar will slip when 
u yank it out.....Then put that under tons of books to make
it reallllllly flat. Then trim the duct tape to the so the
edges match the dollar...then put it in and  let it read it
then yank it out......IMPORTANT!!!!!!! Make sure you 
are putting the tape on the right end or else the machine
wont accept it like Washington has to be on top and well
i think you smart enough...thats it AND KEEP PHREAKING


[This really works, cause I do it all the time.  You can get
free money (50 cents comes out) and get free drinks if you do
this to a soda machine.
