                      (International Calling Codes)

There are 9 total zones involved in international dialing.  Each international
  calling code begins with the zone number that it is in.  Ex. Germany, 49.  
 Germany is in Zone 4.  To use these codes to make an international call you 
     have two choices.  You can manually make the call, or have operator 
 assistance.  For manual dialing, use 011 to begin your call.  For operator 
assisted calls, dial 01 to begin.  Ex. 011-49-209-826-8268  This states to the
 CO that you are making an international call (011) to Germany (49) in area 
 code 209, and the residence's number.  If you should use 01 for this call, 
       when you are through dialing you are connected to an operator.

 That right there should satisfy your craving for a complete list of ICC's.
Call the Pope in Vatican City.  Call Japan and tell them that there lips move 
too much after they're through talking.  Call Austria and tell them that the 
 Sound of Music chick better shut the hell up before you come down there and 
rip her lungs out with a claw hammer.  You get the idea, do whatever the fuck 
you want to with these, that's why I compiled them.  Look for future updates 
such as prefixes for all the cities within each of the above countries.  If 
you have comments/questions, or just want to tell me to get my ass on the ball 
                     and write the prefixes, e-mail me.
