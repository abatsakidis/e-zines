Cosmik Debris is a zine that covers music of nearly every genre.  It's not
unusual to find interviews in the jazz, metal, punk, and surf genres in the
same issue.  A typical issue contains three or more interviews, 50 or more
reviews, and a fine slate of columns.  Robert Cummings' column, Classic 
Example, is aimed at people who are just starting to explore classical music.
(The online version of his column includes sound clip-examples of what he's
writing about.)  Author David Walley (writer of biographies of Zappa and
Ernie Kovacs) contributes Walley At Witzend, a free-form series of observations
of the modern world.  Disc jockey and surf music guru Phil Dirt writes 
Phil's Garage.  Political and social issues are addressed in Steven Leith's
Between Zero & One.  Closet Philosophy with Rusty Pipes and DJ Johnson's
Stuff I Noticed are about whatever crosses their minds.  Cosmik Debris'
interviews go into much deeper ground than is typical these days, so if you
are interested in interviews that ask real questions, this is for you.
