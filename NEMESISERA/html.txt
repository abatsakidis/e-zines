/.: ~THE BASICS OF HTML~ :./
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


I. The <head>
=============
Ok let's get it over with. The <head> of your HTML page is important cause i 
tells the visitors
the content of the page. Lets say your page is about snowboarding:

<html>
<head>
<TITLE>Welcome to my Snowboard Place!</TITLE>
<META NAME="KEYWORDS" CONTENT="snowboard, snow, pics, freestyle" />
<META NAME="DESCRIPTION" CONTENT="A snowboard page for everyone!" />
</head>

* Explained:
<html> (Every page opens with a html tag.)
<META NAME="KEYWORDS" (A list of keywords you can configure yourself.)
<META NAME="DESCRIPTION" (A description of your page.)

It does not matter or you type in UPPERCASE or in lowercase. Now we go 
further to the <body> of
the page. The <body> tag is different from the <head> tag cause the <head> 
tag closes after the
description with a "/" symbol. But the <body> tag closes at the bottom of 
the page.

<body bgcolor="#000000" text="#C0C0C0" link="#0000FF"
vlink="#0000FF" alink="#0000FF">

* Explained:
bgcolor (Your backgroundcolor.)
text (Your textcolor.)
link (The color of your hyperlink.)
vlink (The color of your link when visited.)
alink (The color of your link when active.)

Q: HEEEEELP! What are these fuckin "#000000" things?!
A: Don't panic. These are codes to configure your color. For example: 
"#0000FF" = Blue.

Now lets become to the fun part. The content of your actual page. I will put 
the most used tags
in here.

<p><div align="center"><img src="welcome.gif"></center></p>
<p><font face="OCR A Extended"><strong><u>Welcome!</u></strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Welcome to my snowboard page! Please sign 
my guestbook or
<a href="mailto:you@provider.com>mail me.</a> If there are broken links 
please notice me!</font></p>
<p><font face="arial"><a href="http://www.yahoo.com>Yahoo!</a><br>
Altavista</font></p>

* Explained:
<div align="center" (Centered text)
<img source (Image)
font face (Your text type.)
<strong> (Bold text.)
<u> (Underlined text.)
<p> (New line)
a href (Hyperlink)
<br> (New line but with less space between lines.)

Q: FµC|<! My image doen't appear!
A1: Your image is not in the same directory with your page.
A2: You have no "welcome.gif" moron!

NOTE: Do not forget to close everything! Else it'll not appear! </body> 
</html> etc.

Still have problems? <braincoder@yahoo.com>

Remember all this is VERY basic. It's almost impossible to make an avanced 
version cause there are
so many different options. Now i'll say something i'm gonna get a lot of 
comment on: See code from
others can learn you a lot. Not just ripping, but looking at the code. 
You'll see tags and code
you did never see before. New terms (Java, Javascript, ASP, CGI, etc.) New 
oppurtunities. There are
always things you don't know before. Explore them and you will know.

Be good.
