THE MOTOR
~%~%~%~%~%

The motor constantly varies the rate at which the cdrom spins so that
regardless of where a component, called a detected, is located in 
relation to the radius of the disc, the portion of the disc above the
detector is always moving at the same speed.

~%~%~
LASER
~%~%~

The laser projects a beam of light that is focused by a lens and a 
focusing coil.

~%~%~%~%~%~%~%
LASER (STEP 2)
~%~%~%~%~%~%~%

The laser beam penetrates the protective layer of plastic and strikes
the reflective layer on the bottom of the disc.

~%~%~%~%~%~%
LANDS & PITS
~%~%~%~%~%~%

The Lands are flat areas on the disc, while pits are the depressions
on the reflective layer of the CD. This is how the disc reads 1's
and 0's on the disc, which is Binary format the computer can read.

~%~%~%~%~%
REFLECTION
~%~%~%~%~%

When light hits a pit is is generally scattered, but when light 
hits a land it will reflect back to the detector, where it will
pass through a prism that deflects the reflected laster beam to
a light-sensing diode.

~%~%~%~
VOLTAGE
~%~%~%~

The pulse of light that strikes, and the electrical pulse determines
weither it is a 1 or a 0, the length is determined by the 
timing circuit on the CDROM.
