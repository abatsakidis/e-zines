-[WHO THIS GUIDE IS FOR]-
-------------------------
Anyone that ever needed to stay up late for something, or just for fun,
here are an example of execellent reasons you'd need to stay up:
a) For Studying for a test
b) For Parties, to enjoy the entire stinkin thing
c) Finish Work Papers

There are many others that validate a reason to stay up late.


-------------------------------
-[THINGS NOT TO DO WHEN TIRED]-
-------------------------------

~ Any alcohol is bad, it will slow you down and make you more tired
~ Over the counter drugs can also have a drowsy effect
~ Never lay down on a bed when you are tired unless you plan on falling
  asleep, because if you're like me, you won't be getting up :)
~ Don't eat Junk Food, this only raises your blood sugar temp. and then
  the blood sugar drops fast and hard making you more tired than normal.
~ Never get in any position that is "relaxed" or any position you feel
  you could easily fall asleep.

-[CAFFIENE: HOW IT WORKS/SIDE-EFFECTS/SOURCES]-
-----------------------------------------------
Toxic Dose: LD_50 (about 200 cups of coffee)
(note: varies on weight and size)


Caffiene is the best (legal) drug that stimulates you to keep you
awake. How caffiene works is pretty simple. When you normally get
tired your mind is thinking "It's time to re-energize" and it 
releases a sleep hormone that makes you go to sleep, but when 
caffiene is hanging around it blocks the receptor sites and 
prevents the sleep hormone from attaching and making you fall
asleep. Essentually it replaces the Sleep Hormone receptor sites
with Caffiene instead of the orignal Sleep Hormone.

[SIDE-EFFECTS (OVERDOSING/SHORT TERM EFFECTS/LONG TERM EFFECTS]

Overdosing is taking more than 250mg of caffiene
Short-term effects are immediate effects
Long-term is prolonged use of Caffiene

Legend:
OD = Caused by Overdosing
LT = Long-term effect
ST = Short-term effect


- Now the biggest problem with caffiene is the fact after you
  are out of caffiene in the body, you are much more tired than
  you were orignally, because in response to blocked receptors 
  in the brain, the brain will produce more sleep hormone and 
  more receptors. So when the caffiene wears off, the excessive 
  sleep hormone takes effect, thus you'll be much more tired.(ST)

- Restlessness (OD)
- Nervousness (OD)
- Excitement (OD)
- Insomnia (OD)
- Flushed Face (OD)
- Intestinal Problems (OD)
- Muscle Twitching
- Periods of inexhaustibility (OD)
- Psychomotor Agitation (OD)
- Diuresis (OD)
- Coma (OD)
- Death (OD)
- Cardiac Arrhythmia (OD)
- Addiction (LT)
- Headaches (LT)

-[SOURCES FOR OTHER SUBSTANCES-
-------------------------------

Vitamins & Minerals - You can get vitamins and minerals from either food sources,
                      or the easiest way is to get a simple multi-vitamin. I 
                      recommend getting Gel-tablets, because some of the hard
                      tablets just don't absorb at all.

Water -               Umm....how about the kitchen sink? or Fridge? or bottled?

Herbs -               Many herbs will need to be boughten at a health food store,
                      a lot of herbs aren't located in the grocery stores.                                

Narcotics -           Humm...your friends, your local drug dealers.

-[PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER]-
---------------------------

Now that you know what you need to keep your body awake and ready
to go, now I need to tell you my recommended way to pull this off:

1. Eat some complex carbohydrates
2. Take your Vitamins/Minerals with Water
3. Take Herbs (If any)
4. Wait 10 to 15 minutes for pills to digest
5. Drink your caffiene!
6. Insert any illegal substance here
