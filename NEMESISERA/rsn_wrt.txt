Name: Skyler
Age: 1111 (Binary-Coded)
Music I like: Cynic Project, Technoloop, DJ MARY-JANE, Limp Bizkit,
              Pretty much everything except classical...which is
              okay sometimes :)
Hobbies: Writing Documents, Strength Training, Food, Computing,
         Reading (information purposes)
Quote: "Knowledge is power, and it should be free!"

Reason for Writing:

- If you have half a brain, you'd know you either have to go buy a
  book on information you need or want, or search you butt off to
  get decent information on various subjects...Well I would like
  to change this, No longer shall you have to go buy a book, My
  purpose is basically to write information about various topics
  and make it absolutely free, I'd like to call this project,
  PROJECT ZER0.

- Although I write on Computers MOSTLY, I will write on various
  other subjects. i.e. drugs, anarchy, survival, various school subjects.


ALL INFORMATION SHOULD BE FREE!
