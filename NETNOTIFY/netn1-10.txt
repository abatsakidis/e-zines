Hubba Bubba Chewing Bunnies - They Glow
---------------------------------------

 Welcome Back Notified Ones!
 
 Several weeks after N+I in Atlanta and I'm still scratching my 
 head. Shows are a great way to learn about new products hitting 
 the streets, and to play with some of the latest tools. Yet, 
 one must ask -- what is it with a trade show that makes some 
 vendors lose their mind? Two issues to consider. Spiffs and 
 bunnies.

 You know, spiffs. All those goodies that vendors bring to the 
 shows to try and lure you into their booth. Unfortunately, it 
 seems that some vendors just don't understand the value of 
 time. 

 Networking professionals go to the shows to learn about new 
 products. Are spiffs a good thing? Sure. Offering a cool spiff 
 or a contest is a great way to get people into the booths to 
 watch the latest product demo. Exactly who thinks of these 
 things though? Here's a tip for the vendors - buy a new barrel 
 and stop scrapping at the bottom of your old one. I mean, if 
 you're going to offer spiffs, at least come up with something 
 better than a glow in the dark button. One vendor decided to 
 give out toe-nail clippers. Sure, they're useful and all, and 
 maybe it's just me, but there's something kinda funky about 
 giving out toe-nail clippers. It just seems, well, ummm, gross.

 Then we get to the bunnies. They'll try to lure you into the 
 demos, ram literature (and other foreign objects) in your face, 
 and generally just stand around trying to look pretty. Although 
 there are exceptions, most bunnies have the collective 
 intelligence of a snow pea.

 Being a bunny is a tough job though. Certified with St. Johns 
 Ambulance, I decided to put my emergency first aid skills to 
 good use by offering a bit of advice. Cassandra, a bunny at one 
 booth, appeared to be in serious danger. The poor girl had to 
 stand around all day, with her chest pushed out to the other 
 side of the conference center - now that can't be good for your 
 back. So, being the nice guy I am, I rushed to her side. Psst, 
 Cassandra, you know you're going to destroy your back doing 
 that. While chomping on what appeared to be a full pack of 
 Hubba Bubba, she asks - "Doing what?" Sighing, I hand her the 
 glow in the dark button and walk off into the sunset. Hey, 
 maybe the glow will shed some light on a few things.

 Oh well, enough babbling.

NT 4.0 Users - Consider Yourself Warned
---------------------------------------

 Users of NT 4.0 Server and Workstation, a word to the wise. 
 Do NOT run the ROLLBACK.EXE utility. This utility was 
 designed to help OEMs to preinstall NT 4.0, and to allow 
 end-users to perform final configuration according to the 
 desired role of the computer. By running this utility, you 
 will undo all configuration completed within the GUI portion 
 of the Windows NT Setup. There is no way to recover any 
 information deleted by this utility.

Cutting Your Spam Intake - From the Editors of NetNotify
--------------------------------------------------------

 If you've been hit by unsolicited advertisements in the 
 past, you are more than likely familiar with the workings of 
 Cyber Promotions (cyberpromo.com). The gang at Cyber 
 Promotions recently issued a statement to inform the 
 Internet community of their alleged good intents, and their 
 "desire" to ensure that no one receives advertisements they 
 don't want. Within this statement, they provided 
 instructions on how you can add your email addresses to 
 their master "REMOVE" list, ensuring that you no longer 
 receive unsolicited ads from them. For your benefit, we have 
 included the two options below. 

 1. You can send an email to mailto:remove@cyberpromo.com
 and type "REMOVE ALL" in the subject or message field. 

 2. You may also send an email to 
 mailto:manremove@cyberpromo.com and type as many email 
 addresses as you wish in the body of the message, each on 
 its own line, without any comments.

 Vendors look out!  Richard Beels, our man on the tech support 
 beat, kicks off his new column - Tech Support Hell - and 
 Palindrome is the prey. Vendors best lose the Jr. Techies on 
 the support lines . . . Richard will eat them for lunch.

The Winners Circle - Current Contests
=====================================

 From the contests in our past edition, we have some winners 
 to announce!

 First, the BDU Awards contest. Judging this contest was a 
 tough one for our team.  So many funny entries to choose 
 from. Trying to pick just one was impossible - there was a 
 tie for first.  Instead of just drawing one of the two names 
 out of a hat, we have two winners this time.  Charles Rose 
 for his story about the Labrador puppy chewing through the 
 network cabling, and Frank Pietersen, for his story of the 
 file servers that weren't just down - they were stolen!

 Second, the contest for a free 3 month subscription to 
 Novell's Support Encyclopedia.  There were many entries, but 
 there can only be one winner. That winner is <drum roll 
 please> - Marie James of Pomona, CA.
