Just How Bad is Microsoft?
--------------------------

 I've been directly involved with the networking industry now for 
 the past 8 years. In this time, the one thing that always amazes me 
 is the pure hatred that some have for Microsoft. Even more so, some 
 of the reasons.

 While sitting in the local wateringhole contemplating the meaning 
 of life -- that's my story, and I'm sticking by it -- I had the 
 chance to chat with an interesting gent. Throughout our 3 hour 
 conversation he described, in detail, why he and (according to him) 
 others hated Microsoft so much. Yet, after three hours of babbling, 
 I still don't get it. 

 It's really not that hard to find someone that hates Microsoft. 
 What is difficult though, is to find someone who can explain the 
 hatred, with valid reasons, without jumping into back alley 
 vocabulary that would make even a sailor blush. For examples, just 
 cruise some of the search engines looking for Micro$oft, Microsift, 
 or Micro???? -- replacing ???? with your favorite 4 letter 
 expletive.

 Many of the reasons that we've found relate directly to Bill Gates. 
 True, he is the figurehead for Microsoft, but to convince someone, 
 why not talk about poor management practices instead of irrelevant 
 personal "facts". One anti-Microsoft argument is based on the fact 
 that Bill makes too much money. Hello? Granted, there are folks out 
 there that don't want money and fame, but I suspect a great deal 
 would be tickled to be worth billions of dollars.

 Probably one of the "best" anti-Microsoft statements that we've 
 received so far, that are related directly to Gates, compares Bill 
 to an autistic.  It's said that hatred is a product of ignorance, 
 and there's really no other way to describe a statement like that.

 It's easy to blame one's own problems on someone else, but really, 
 what does that accomplish? Our wateringhole friend hates Microsoft 
 because his company chose Win95 as the official desktop product. 
 Apparently, in his world, OS/2 or UNIX would have been a better 
 choice. How so? In most companies, you'll likely find more 
 employees that are familiar with Microsoft products than OS/2 or 
 UNIX -- thus, reduced learning curves and retraining costs. Aside 
 from that, there's the whole issue of third party support and 
 products.

 For OS/2 fanatics, why not blame IBM? Many of the IBM 
 representatives I've dealt with to date actively push Windows for 
 the desktop OS. UNIX fans -- time for a reality check. If UNIX 
 vendors could really get their act in gear and produce, and adhere 
 to, a common set of standards to improve interoperability AND ease 
 of use . . .maybe UNIX would be a valid contender. There are more 
 "flavors" of UNIX than ice-cream at the local Baskin Robins ice-
 cream parlor! The sad truth is that the hatred and dislike for 
 Microsoft is, in many ways, misguided. 

 A key advantage for Microsoft is their established market base, 
 thus, familiarity. When you have millions and millions of users 
 running Windows on the desktop, that represents a significant 
 number of companies who might be swayed into using your NOS. Novell 
 had the opportunity some time ago with their "Novell DOS" and 
 UnixWare line . . .both of which failed miserably. As for IBM's 
 OS/2, in comparison to Windows, it's going nowhere fast. Who do you 
 blame?

 Some will criticize Microsoft's business practices by claiming 
 ideas for Windows were stolen from other companies. Or, better 
 still, the foundation for Windows and DOS was never really 
 developed by Microsoft. If one company is able to take an idea, 
 develop it, market it, and establish mindshare better than any 
 other company, who do you blame?

 Maybe it's not in vogue to like Microsoft but, I must admit, as a 
 company, there's no comparison. Although I've never had the 
 opportunity to meet Gates, would I? In a heartbeat. Even if all the 
 public statements about Gates are true, he's one hell of a 
 businessman.

 On with the show...

Virus Warnings - Yet Another Hoax
---------------------------------

 Seems that three hoax virus warnings are filtering through the 
 industry, creating unnecessary concern. At the risk of sounding 
 like a broken record, the Good Times virus...it does NOT exist. 
 Although information on this one has been published time and time 
 again, users still continue to spread rumors of the virus. Next, 
 the Irina virus. This piece of work originated as a publicity stunt 
 for Penguin books, and again, there's no such animal. Last, but not 
 least, the Deeyenda virus. Allegedly, this virus could be sent as 
 an email message. By downloading the message to your computer, it 
 would then hose your system. As an added bonus, those sending the 
 warnings out were claiming that the American FCC originally issued 
 the warning. Please note, the FCC does NOT issue virus warnings, 
 nor can your computer become infected with a virus just by reading 
 an email message. Special thanks to Sensible Security Solutions for 
 the latest hoax warnings.

-----------------------
The Ultimate UPS Gadget
-----------------------

 To date, most users were accustomed to configuring their UPS 
 through a computer. Fire up the PC, load the management software, 
 then clickety click your way through the configuration process. 
 Don't have a PC to use near the UPS, oh well . . . walk back to 
 your desk. Well those days are gone now, PowerView is here. A palm-
 sized UPS monitoring tool, PowerView allows you to configure your 
 UPS through a direct serial port connection. An added bonus, not 
 only can you configure your UPS through PowerView, but you can also 
 perform real-time monitoring of UPS stats, right from the palm of 
 you hand -- pretty slick. Weighing in at a mere one pound, 
 PowerView can be yours for $249 (U.S). Who makes it? APC of course, 
 who else?
