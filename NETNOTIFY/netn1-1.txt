                      NetNotify
         The Newsletter for Network Professionals
  
                May 5th, 1996, Issue 1
=======================================================
  
  --------
  Welcome!
  --------
  
  Greetings notified ones, and welcome to the first 
  edition of NetNotify, the Newsletter for Network 
  Professionals. The primary goal of NetNotify is simple: 
  to provide timely information on cool new products and 
  services in the networking industry. 
  
  Have you ever spoken with one of your associates and 
  heard about a great seminar they went to for free but 
  you never heard a word about it until it was over? Or, 
  have you missed out on promotions for free products 
  from vendors because you just didn't hear in time? 
  Well, judging by the hundreds of new subscriptions that 
  we've been processing each day, I'll assume that many 
  of you know exactly what I am talking about. That is 
  precisely why I started NetNotify.
  
  NetNotify is a publication that will be growing and 
  improving on a regular basis. As a service for the 
  network professional, we are interested to hear what 
  you have to say. When there are issues you would like 
  to see addressed in future editions, be sure to let us 
  know! 
  
  Future editions will only list new products, services 
  or patches released within that publishing period. 
  Within this edition though, there are several items 
  that date back to the early part of April due to a 
  backlog of some items waiting to be published. This 
  will be the only time that issues older than 2 weeks 
  will be addressed in NetNotify.
  
  Thanks for your early support of NetNotify!
  
  Douglas J. Archell
  Sr. Editor

  The Present and Future of NetNotify
  ----------------------------------- 
  
  Before jumping right into the newsletter, a couple of 
  notes regarding the services that are currently 
  available and some information on what's to come.
  
  Document Retrieval Service
  
  Occasionally you will notice a reference to a document 
  ID (DOC-ID). This field relates to a document that you 
  can request from our document retrieval system, all 
  handled through email. By sending a message to 
  INFO@NETCENT.COM, you can request specific documents 
  that will provide detailed information on the product 
  or service mentioned in NetNotify. 
  
  To receive instructions and get an index of all 
  available documents, send an email to INFO@NETCENT.COM 
  and place the word INFO in the body of the message. If 
  you would like to request a specific document, append 
  the document ID to the info command.
  
  For example, to request the "mcpenfaq" document, send 
  email to INFO@NETCENT.COM and place the command "info 
  mcpenfaq", without the quotes, in the body of the 
  message. That's all there is to it! It is important to 
  note that you should NOT include the text "DOC-ID" in 
  your request and all requests are case sensitive. 
  
  Should We Go HTML?
  
  Currently, NetNotify is distributed as a standard ASCII 
  based email. This does not make life easy to format the 
  newsletter and it makes it a "dumb" publication. We are 
  looking to change this by making things more 
  interactive. To do this, we are considering publishing 
  as an HTML document. You will still receive the 
  newsletter automatically, but publishing it in HTML 
  will make life a lot easier for you, the reader, to 
  request information on any of the services/products 
  mentioned within.
  
  If you think we should go to HTML, send an email to: 
  
  HTML-YES@NETCENT.COM
  
  If you think we should remain as is, send an email to:
  
  HTML-NO@NETCENT.COM
  
  Votes will automatically be tallied and presented in a 
  future edition of NetNotify. The polls close May 31!

  -------------------------------------------------------
  Support on CompuServe for Windows, Windows 95 and NT 
  You're In Good Hands!
  -------------------------------------------------------
  
  Microsoft may have moved their support services off 
  CompuServe, but the gurus from the Windows Users Group 
  Network (WUGNET) have stepped up to the plate to fill 
  some pretty big shoes!
  
  On April 20, WUGNET officially took over 24 of the 
  forums previously operated by Microsoft. Added to their 
  listing of managed forums, WUGNET now covers 38 forums 
  on CompuServe. Servicing over 1.5 million regular 
  users, they are the largest third party independent 
  support organization available worldwide!
  
  WUGNET's extremely large user base, combined with the 
  120 staff supporters, yields some impressive results. 
  Users coming to one of the forums run by WUGNET can 
  usually expect an in-depth response to their technical 
  problems in as little as 3-5hrs. Worst case situations 
  are usually overnight responses: an excellent track 
  record to say the least!
  
  WUGNET's long arms of technical expertise stretch far 
  beyond the electronic walls of CompuServe. The folks 
  from WUGNET also produce a line of software and CD's 
  for Windows, 95 and NT. They also have their own line 
  of extensive reference books published by IDG Books 
  Worldwide.
  
  For those of you that have benefited from the technical 
  expertise of the WUGNET guru's in the past, and for 
  those who are new to the WUGNET experience, rest 
  assured, you're in good hands! Be sure to visit one of 
  the many WUGNET supported forums on CompuServe. For 
  further information about WUGNET, you can also checkout 
  their web site at http://www.wugnet.com.
  
  -----------------------------
  OS/2 the Best? Virus says so!
  -----------------------------
  
  The folks at SSS-Sensible Security Solutions Inc., 
  representatives in Canada of Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus 
  Toolkit, have announced their findings for a new virus 
  lovingly know as Pretentious.680. 
  
  Pretentious is a parasitic non-resident appending *.COM 
  infector. Infected files become 680 bytes longer and 
  have their time stamp set to 62 sec (like the Vienna 
  virus). This change to the time stamp is not noticeable 
  when doing a normal DIR of infected files.
  
  When an infected program is run, the virus changes the 
  current DOS disk to C: and infects one file in the 
  current directory on C:. The DOS default drive is not 
  restored to what it was before, but changed to C:. That 
  means if you run an infected program on drive A:, for 
  example, you are returned to the current directory on 
  drive C:.
  
  Pretentious does not propagate if there is no C: drive. 
  The virus does not infect files shorter than 255 bytes 
  and longer than 64,000 bytes. It avoids infecting any 
  file with the filemask ??MM????.COM. This means it will 
  avoid infecting COMMAND.COM
  
  The presence of the virus is pretty obvious: in any 
  month but January when an infected program is run, the 
  virus will display the following text:
  
     "Windows 95 may be dangerous.
      OS/2 is the best operating system!
      I'll prove it soon..."
  
  The above text is kept encrypted in the virus body. 
  Pretentious also contains the non-encrypted text 
  "Gdynia 1996 * v1.0 *" (Gdynia is a large city in 
  Poland). All the text messages are verified by a 
  checksum by the virus. If they are found to be modified 
  (in other words, if the checksum does not match) the 
  virus reboots the computer.
  
  This virus was distributed widely via the amateur 
  "Packet Network". This means that the potential for 
  copies of this virus spreading is quite large. The 
  packet network sends binary files in a manner similar 
  to UUE as mail, with multiple copies spreading out on 
  BBSes world-wide. Many BBSes process such files 
  automatically, and append them to their download areas. 
  Even if the file is not read, and decoded as original 
  mail, there is a danger of infection at a later date by 
  a user downloading the infection from a BBS. Samples 
  received by the virus researchers at Dr Solomon's 
  indicate that the initially distributed infected file 
  was infected and then deliberately PKLite'd 
  (compressed) to hide itself. Dr Solomon's FindVirus can 
  scan recursively inside compressed and archived files 
  using the /UNZIP command-line switch.
  
  Users of FindVirus 7.55 and above will be able to 
  detect this virus when run with the /ANALYSE switch. A 
  future update to FindVirus (7.61) will allow you to 
  detect and cleanup this virus. If you would like to add 
  detection and cleanup for this virus now, or to 
  download an eval of FindVirus 7.59, be sure to visit 
  Dr. Solomon's web site at http://www.drsolomon.com.
  
  ---------------------------
  NetWare 4.1 Still the Boss!
  ---------------------------
  
  Wondering which Network Operating System (NOS) is still 
  tops? If you guessed NetWare 4.1, and you're a fan of 
  Network Computing Magazine, you're right. Once again, 
  NetWare 4.1 has won the Best NOS title from Network 
  Computing Magazine's "Well Connected" awards. This 
  brings the grand total to 15 awards that have been 
  bestowed on 4.1 since it hit the street in 1994.
  
  -----------------------------------
  There May be a Santa Claus Dorothy, 
  But There's No PKZIP V3.00
  -----------------------------------
  
  Although it's old news, after getting a message from 
  one client about how proud they were to be the first to 
  download the latest version of PKZIP in the office, 
  it's time for a friendly reminder. There is no version 
  3.00 of PKZIP folks! Well, there is one out there, but 
  it's a Trojan Horse that was first uncovered back in 
  May of 1995. When in doubt, or better still, when you 
  are considering upgrading your system with a new 
  version of PKZIP that you found, contact the folks at 
  PKWARE to be sure! Phone: (414)354-8699 FAX: (414)354-
  8559 BBS: (414)354-8670  
  
  ---------------------------
  Roll Call of The Certified!
  ---------------------------
  
  Just how many CNE's are out there? How many MCP's? 
  These are two very common questions asked by thousands 
  of people. You've worked hard to get your 
  certifications, now, are you 1 of 5,000 or 1 or 50,000? 
  Well, to answer those questions we gave the folks at 
  Microsoft and Novell a ring to find out just how many 
  of you are out there. 
  
  Novell Certifications - Status as of April 30th 1996
  
    CNAs over 97,500
    CNEs over 88,800
    Master CNEs over 6,500
  
  Microsoft Certifications - Status as of April 2, 1996 *
  
    MCSE 6,138
    MCSD 1,190
    MCPS 42,770
    MCT  4,272
  
  *Unfortunately, we were not able to get the April 30th 
  stats in time for publication.
  
  We are looking to include detailed statistics on the 
  vendor certifications within the first edition of 
  NetNotify each month. More on this later!
  
  --------------------------
  You Checked your Notebook?
  --------------------------
  
  Many have probably seen Toshiba's ads on TV depicting a 
  gentleman standing in the airport, panicking because he 
  checked his notebook instead of keeping it for carry 
  on. His laptop was able to brave the rigors of the 
  airline personnel, but if you're not careful, your 
  notebook may not make it through the airport x-ray 
  machines!
  
  There's a new scam being run at many of the countries 
  major airports that could separate you from your 
  expensive light weight buddy: here's how it works.
  
  It involves two suspects who look for a potential 
  victim carrying a laptop approaching a security check 
  point in the boarding area. The suspects position 
  themselves in front of the victim passenger. They stall 
  until the passenger puts their laptop on the x -ray 
  conveyor belt. The first suspect then moves through the 
  metal detector easily. The second suspect sets off the 
  detector as they move through, and then begins to slow 
  down the process of emptying pockets, removing jewelry, 
  etc..
  
  While this is happening, the first suspect takes the 
  victims laptop from the conveyor belt as it exits the 
  x-ray machine, and quickly disappears into the crowd. 
  When the victim finally gets through the metal 
  detector, their laptop is gone. There is sometimes a 
  third suspect who will take a hand off from the first 
  suspect, and the computer is out of the restricted area 
  before the victim even knows that it is missing. 
  
  Although difficult to do at busy airports, try to avoid 
  long lines at boarding area security check points, if 
  at all possible. When unable to do so, delay putting 
  your carry on luggage and laptop on the conveyor belt 
  until you are sure that you will be the very next 
  person through the metal detector. As you move through 
  the detector keep an eye on the conveyor belt for your 
  luggage and laptop to come through, as well as watching 
  what others in front of you are picking up.

  -------------------------------------
  Novell Master CNE Requirements Change
  -------------------------------------
  
  Novell Education has recently changed credits required 
  in the core and elective areas of Master CNE 
  certification. Course 210 Fundamentals of Network 
  Management has now been moved from a Master CNE core 
  requirement to an elective option for CNEs and Master 
  CNEs. Based on this decision, credits have been 
  realigned in both the Core and Elective areas for all 
  Master CNE certifications. Details regarding this can 
  be found in the CNE/Master CNE Participant's Guide 
  which can be obtained from the Novell Education faxback 
  system at 1-800-233-EDUC or 801-429-5363 document 
  #1443, or on the CNE Homepage on the web at

  If you've been around NetWare for awhile, you'll know 
  that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of third 
  party products available for NetWare 3.x. 
  Unfortunately, there are no where near as many for 
  NetWare 4.x, especially utilities that can make the 
  life of the NDS Administrator and users a little 
  easier.  Fear not 4.x fans, help is on the way with 
  DreamLAN's NDS Toolkit.  Packed with all sort's of 
  goodies, this toolkit is a must have for any NetWare 
  4.x administrators out there! For full details on this 
  gem of 4.x utilities, be sure to request the related 
  document from the NetNotify Document retrieval service!

  Double the Speed, Quadruple the Capacity
  ----------------------------------------
  
  Users interested in optical drives should check-out 
  MOST's new Jupiter 2 or Nikon's new Beluga drive: 2.6GB 
  Direct-Overwrite Magneto-Optical (MO) drives. The 
  drives offer transfer rates that are double that 
  offered by existing optical drives while also 
  quadrupling the storage capacity. Their incredible 
  speed and capacity make them ideal for image storage 
  and retrieval, and general network applications.
  
  Using Nikon's patented LIM-DOW (Light Intensity 
  Modulation-Direct Overwrite) technology permits the 
  drives to carry out the overwrite process in a single 
  pass at a full 3600 rpm, rather than the slower, two-
  pass process required by earlier technology drives. As 
  a result, the drives provide a sustained read and write 
  transfer rate of up to 4MB/sec and a burst transfer 
  rate of 10MB/sec, which make them the fastest 5¬" MO 
  drives available today. With the drive's 2X speed and 
  average seek time of 24ms, combined with their 4X 
  capacity, they provide performance levels comparable 
  with hard drives. 
  
  For further information on the Jupiter 2, or the

  Regal Unveils New 5-DISC CD-ROM Jukeboxes!
  ------------------------------------------
  
  There's not much in this industry that really gets me 
  excited. I have a deep love for computers and 
  networking, but there are so many new products coming 
  out on a regular basis that, in a way, I've become 
  desensitized to many of them. Regal Electronics has 
  changed that.
  
  You see, there's this problem I've had for a long, long 
  time, and that problem is my CD-ROM drive. The drive 
  work's like a charm, but it's a single triple speed 
  unit. I have a growing library of CD-ROM's that I must 
  reference on a regular basis: not an easy task when you 
  only have one CD-ROM drive. To date, I have resorted to 
  eating up hundreds of megabytes of disk space to store 
  my CD-ROM data so I can use multiple applications at 
  once. I have considered purchasing additional CD-ROM 
  drives or one of jukeboxes on the market but the 
  problem has been cost and real estate. Buying multiple 
  drives can become pricey, and jukeboxes have been 
  anything but cheap. Desktop space is very limited in my 
  lab and my sleek desktop computer that I use most of 
  the time has a serious problem with available space - 
  components are crammed in their tighter than sardines! 
  That's all about to change though.
  
  Regal Electronics has hit the streets with two new CD 
  Jukeboxes offering 4X speed and holding up to 5 CD-
  ROMs, that's 3.2Gb of data you can have available at 
  once!
  
  Their CDC-4Xi is a half height jukebox that fits into 
  the space used by a floppy drive, or, the space used by 
  your older single CD-ROM unit. Listed at $399, this PnP 
  ready unit comes equipped with an Enhanced IDE card, 
  cable, audio cable and one Regal 5-disc cartridge. The 
  4Xi is Win95 and Windows NT compatible and comes with 
  easy-to-use interface/minichanger management software 
  for DOS and Windows 3.1.
  
  The CDC-4X is a low-profile subsystem offering full 
  SCSI-II compatibility and a universal switching power 
  supply. This allows for PnP operation almost anywhere 
  in the world for the meager list price of $495! The 4X 
  is Win95 and Windows NT-compatible and includes high-
  performance multi-platter CD-ROM management and SCSI 
  utility software with support for DOS, Windows 3.1, 
  Macintosh systems, and NetWare.
  
  If you're tired of playing the data shuffle, swapping 
  CD's left, right, and center, contact Regal 
  Electronics.

  CNet Unveils Three Hot New Hubs!
  --------------------------------
  
  The new 8 port PowerSWITCH SH-1080 switching hub 
  integrates both 10BaseT and 100BaseTX networking 
  technologies in a single unit. Six 10BaseT ports 
  provide switch-selectable, full-duplex 20Mbps Ethernet 
  performance and two 100Base TX ports combine to form 
  the perfect "bridge" between existing 10Mbps networks 
  and the 100Mbps networks. The two Fast Ethernet ports 
  also support the Nway auto-negotiation standard to 
  detect the speed of attached devices.
  
  The PowerStack CNFH-1200 is a 12 port Fast Ethernet hub 
  that requires no configuration and supports all major 
  network protocols. It is a simple and easy to use hub 
  for small to medium sized organizations! PowerStacks 12 
  100BaseTX RJ-45 ports on the front panel can connect up 
  to 12 workstations using Cat5 UTP, one of which can 
  serve as a crossover port to link hubs at 100Mbps! 
   
  The PowerSWITCH SH-80 is an 8-port Ethernet switching 
  hub offering a potential throughput of 140Mbps. Using 
  high-speed, cut-through technology and advanced 
  switching technology, network delays are a thing of the 
  past! Each of the 8 ports deliver at least 10Mbps of 
  bandwidth to connected devices. 6 of the ports are 
  dedicated 10BaseT ports supporting 20Mbps full-duplex 
  Ethernet when connected to capable devices, 1 is a 
  combination BNC/UTP and the other, a combination 
  AUI/UTP port. 
  
  The sleek, trim hubs are a steal with SRP at $1,798 
  (SH-80), $1,998 (CNFH-1200) and $2,688 (SH-1080). Users 
  can purchase the SH-1080I with CView SNMP network 
  management software for $2,888., only $200 more than 
  the 1080!

  fibre channel PCI adapters are something you should be 
  looking into! Announced at NetWorld+Interop, these

  bandwidth interconnections for storage and networks. 
  The new cards, FibreStar FCI-1063-CI for copper (DB-9) 
  output and FibreStar FCI-1063-OI for optical 
  connections, support both switched and arbitrated loop 
  network architectures. By integrating the fibre channel 
  transceiver circuits onto the board, they have provided 
  the lowest cost gigabit fibre channel cards on the 
  market today. You could go FDDI, but fibre channel 
  solutions are available for the same cost with many 
  times the bandwidth. For you speed demons out there, 
  Windows NT and Solaris X86 drivers are available with 
  the cards.
