IMPORTANT NOTE - Due to the Networld+Interop conference in 
Atlanta, the next regular edition of NetNotify (which was 
scheduled for next Wednesday) has been postponed. We'll be back 
stronger than ever with the following edition.

=================================================================

Welcome Back Notified Ones!

Suprised to hear back from us so soon?  Although NetNotify is 
regularly published every two weeks, this edition is unlike the 
others. Throughout the year there will be various "Special 
Editions" of NetNotify (roughly 8 per year.) So without further 
ado, lets welcome Special Edition #1, Networld+Interop 1996 in 
Atlanta!

Although we could give you a pretty picture providing the floor 
plan of the convention center, where you could click on some 
mystery box to find out which vendor will be in that little piece 
of real estate, that's just not "us". We also could provide you 
with a full listing of all the vendors that will be at the show - 
<yawn> we decided against that though (did you know that Novell 
and Microsoft will be at Networld+Interop -- gee, we didn't <G>.)

So what's this special edition all about? Contests. Freebies. 
Transportation tips. New product demos. More importantly, where 
to PAR-TAY (if ya don't know what PAR-TAY means, the mainframe 
newsletter is down the hall and to the left.)

If you're going to the show, and you're interested in the 
possibility of winning one contest (worth roughly $19,000), 
partying it up at one of the best Amusement Parks in the US, or 
seeing THE man, THE legend, Little Richard -- better get reading!

The NetNotify crew will be in Atlanta, in full force, cruising 
the convention center and dancing it up at the clubs, so be sure 
to say "Hi" if you stumble across anyone. Wherever you end up 
going in Atlanta, from the gang at NetNotify to you -- have fun, 
and return home safely!

Parties And Special Presentations
=================================

  Before listing a few of the vendor parties, and definitely before 
  we tell you about ANY nightclubs in Atlanta, a word of warning to 
  all the men out there <ladies, just skip to the next section>.

  Men, there may be vendors passing out beanie caps with propellers 
  again this year. WARNING. Wearing those beanie caps and 
  propellers with knee shorts, black dress socks, sandles, and 
  Networld+Interop badges to parties and nightclubs is hazardous to 
  your social life. Failure to comply with this warning will result 
  in a lot of quality time being spent at 
  http://www.atlsingles.com/. Trust us. Beanie caps with 
  propellers, they're really not that cool.

Contests and Show "Specials"
============================

-----------------------------------------
Win $100 in Cash For Being a Notified One
-----------------------------------------

  Whenever we walk the conference floors, we have this little habit 
  of looking at the name tags people are wearing, you never know 
  who you will bump into. This little habit has inspired a fun new 
  contest that's sure to drive the vendor marketing reps at the 
  show CRAZY (what techie doesn't like playing with marketing's 
  head?) 

  Assuming this years show badges are the same as last years, 
  printed on the card will be your name, title, and your company 
  name. For a bit of fun, replace your regular title with "Notified 
  One". When the booth marketing reps ask you what a "Notified One" 
  does -- just give them some really puzzled look like they've been 
  out of the loop for a few years ;-)

  The 50th person we see walking around with a badge that says 
  "Notified One" will win $100 in COLD CASH, on the spot!

Transportation
==============

  Unless you're planning on renting a car and driving everywhere 
  all week, you'll be needing a little transportation.  In Atlanta, 
  the public transportation services most widely used are those 
  offered by MARTA (phone 404-848-3351).  For $1.50, you can take a 
  bus or train to virtually anywhere you'll need to go.

--------------------------------
General Train/Bus Rules and Tips
--------------------------------

  Non-smokers will be happy to hear that smoking is strictly 
  prohibited inside and immediately outside all rail stations. 
  Furthermore, no eating or drinking is allowed on the buses or 
  trains.

  Those with visual impairments are free to bring their guide dogs, 
  and other service animals are welcomed for any person with a 
  disability.

  If you're lost, fear not! Rail system diagrams and station stops 
  are posted near the fare gates and in each car to help you plan 
  your trip. When in doubt, ask. Train and bus attendants are 
  always more than happy to help. While riding the train, operators 
  call out each station on an intercom prior to stopping. One 
  important note -- make sure you're ready to exit BEFORE the train 
  stops, those doors don't stay open for too long.

  For bus travelers, every MARTA bus stop has either a tri-colored 
  sign or a white concrete post for identification. Stops are 
  available usually every couple blocks down the bus route.

---------------------------
MARTA Accessibility Options
---------------------------

  Although not all buses are, many are equipped with wheelchair-
  lifts. For information on when these buses operate call 404-848-
  4711. If you need to request a lift-equipped bus, call 404-848-
  5618.

  For the hearing impaired, TDD Schedule Information is available 
  by calling 404-848-5665 6-10:00am Monday through Friday, and from 
  8:00am to 4:00pm on weekends and holidays.

  For persons with disabilities who are unable to use the regular 
  bus or rail system, MARTA operates a special 11-passenger van 
  service (called L-Vans.) They operate 7 days a week, on a curb-
  to-curb basis, for a fair of $3 each way. Attendants, when 
  required by the patron, can ride for free. Call 404-848-5389 for 
  information.

  and if you DON'T like good food and drinks, please, don't go to 
  the Baja . . . ;-)

  Bell Bottoms Night Club - 404-816-9669, 225 Pharr Road : Not one 
  of our favs, but to jump back to the early 70's or 80's (why 
  won't they just die) here's a classic dance club.

  Have A Nice Day Cafe - 404-351-1401, 857 Collier Road : 70's fans 
  should love this place. Packed with 70's paraphernalia and music 
  to get you dancing up a storm.

Beer Joints
-----------

  If you just want to find a cozy seat and a barley sandwich, here 
  are three local favs!

  Churchill Arms - 404-233-5633, 3223 Cains Hill Pl. : "English 
  pub" atmosphere. Small, but cozy establishment.

  Fado' - 404-841-0066, 3035 Peachtree St. : Designed to display 
  the 5 different pub styles built by the Irish Pub Co. around the 
  world. For beer fans, Fado has THE best Guinness in town! Highly 
  recommended, and if you're a beer fan, definitely worth the trip!

  Melton's App and Tap - 404-634-9112, 2500 N. Decatur Rd. : Good 
  food, great micro brewery selection to choose from. 
  "Neighborhood-style" bar.
