Found Money For Network Pros
----------------------------

 Recently, one of my Windows 95 workstations took a nose dive. 
 Although a full restore from tape was one way to recover, I decided 
 to use this incident as an opportunity to reinstall from scratch. 
 Cleanup the system -- old drivers, you know the routine.

 Deep into hour 8 of the complete reinstallation process (ya, sure, 
 installing from CD is oh so fast) I came to a startling 
 realization. We've been brainwashed. The majority of network 
 professionals around the world have been brainwashed. Who did it -- 
 networking industry vendors preaching the beta-boogie (AKA - free 
 labor).

 There are three "classifications" of beta programs: open beta, 
 closed beta, and the damn-when-will-this-stupid-thing-work 
 perpetual beta. No matter how you classify the program, it still 
 works out to one thing: free labor. Think about it. Take a look at 
 your systems and find out just how many pieces of beta code you're 
 running. Beta browsers, FTP clients, email clients, newsgroup 
 readers, diagnostic software, maybe even your operating system is 
 beta.

 How have we been brainwashed? Oh, I don't know, maybe because the 
 majority of us grunts practically beg for beta code. We want the 
 code so we have the latest and greatest. We want it so we can learn 
 about the new products now, in some feeble attempt to stay ahead of 
 the game. Meanwhile, companies are slashing personnel budgets left, 
 right and center. Why hire when there are tens of thousands willing 
 to test for free? 

 When you think about it, the whole "beta tester" situation has 
 really gotten out of hand. At Networld+Interop this year, some 
 vendors were actually giving out beta code as prizes for contests. 
 Can you believe that??? In no other industry can you give away 
 broken stuff, and actually have people thank you for it.

 Beta software has become so commonplace, a great many of us run 
 these packages in our production environments. Imagine if GM sent 
 out a bulletin saying they've come out with a great new braking 
 system. It hasn't been certified yet, and there are "known 
 problems" driving alongside other manufacturer's cars. How many 
 would put their hands up, eagerly awaiting a set of those gems?

 Probably the worst program of all would be the damn-when-will-this-
 stupid-thing-work perpetual beta. Just how long should a beta 
 program go on for? Shouldn't someone set a time limit for a beta 
 program?

 My newsgroup reader: beta. It's been beta since I started using it, 
 almost a year ago. Don't get me wrong, I love the product, but it's 
 this whole perpetual beta thing. You see, since I started using 
 this product, one new 7-11, three coffee shops, a bowling alley, 
 and a subdivision of 90 houses have been built in my area. Entire 
 cities are going up faster than this product!

 After much thought, I believe I have come up with a resolution to 
 this beta dilemma - NBTU, Networking Beta Testers United. This new 
 organization, comprised entirely of networking industry 
 professionals, will provide beta testing services at a nominal per 
 hour fee. We'll form a union to deal with any scabs that choose to 
 beta test for free, and deal with vendors that try to circumvent 
 our established testing channels.

 Interesting thought. Mind you, with an organization like this, I'd 
 bet that the beta periods we've become accustomed to would be 
 trimmed down, drastically. Imagine. Beta testing that was finished 
 within a couple months, maybe even weeks.

 Ahhhh, dare to dream.

 On with the show. . . .

Upcoming Job/Contracting Opportunities
--------------------------------------

 Your trusty gang at NetNotify has partnered with numerous 
 recruiters and Human Resource departments at leading industry 
 vendors to bring you Networking Central. A sister e-zine to 
 NetNotify, Networking Central will provide readers with hot leads 
 on full-time and contract opportunities, references to work related 
 sites on the net, and tips and tricks for resume writing. 
 Networking Central will kick off in a few short weeks on a two 
 month trial basis -- provided free of charge to all NetNotify 
 subscribers. After the two month trial, if the service proves 
 successful, it will break off as a separate publication that you 
 can subscribe to.

--------------------------------------------
Upcoming Service for Certified Professionals
--------------------------------------------

 In a previous edition, we hinted at a new service that we were 
 working on for industry certified professionals. The release of 
 that service is getting real close (the wait is killing us <G>). At 
 this stage, we are looking for industry pros with web access that 
 would like to help review the service before it opens to the 
 general public. If interested, please send an email to 
 mailto:netnotify-marketing@netcent.com with the phrase "CERT 
 TESTER" in the subject line. The new service will provide some 
 great opportunities for ATECs and NAECs. So for all you ATEC and 
 NAEC marketing reps listening in, drop us a line for the details.

------------------------------
NetNotify Survey - LAST CHANCE
------------------------------

 This is your last chance to fill out the current NetNotify Reader 
 survey. Results from this survey will be tabulated, and used to 
 define the future of the services provided. If you don't fill it 
 out . . . prepare for a tongue lashing down the road if you ask 
 "Hey, why don't you cover XXXX?" ;-)

 The survey is available through the web, and can be found at the 
 URL http://www.netcent.com/netnotify/nn-survey.htm .

General News and Tidbits
========================

---------------------------
NT 4 Users -- Riddle Me This
---------------------------

 Interesting problem that was brought to our attention recently. 
 Although we contacted Microsoft on the matter, the proposed 
 "resolution" was one of two things: don't do that, or post to the 
 newsgroups (go figure). As this is a problem which could affect 
 many NT 4 users out there, we're posing this problem to the 
 Notified ones for suggestions. If anyone knows a workaround, please 
 drop us a line to mailto:netnotify-suggest@netcent.com. Should a 
 workaround be discovered, we'll post the answer in a future 
 edition. Now for the situation:

 Open a cmd window in 4.0. Run notepad from the window. You'll get a 
 notepad window in front of the cmd pane. Unfortunately, the cmd 
 pane goes right to a cmd prompt as if you typed "start notepad", 
 i.e. - it's ready for another command. In v3.51, the same process 
 results in a notepad session and only when you close notepad do you 
 get a cmd prompt in the cmd pane.

 Batch files in 4.0 don't wait for a command to complete before the 
 next line is executed. This is a problem if you're trying to handle 
 sequential tasks (the start /wait switch wouldn't work). 

------------------------------
Windows 95 and DUN Hanging Tip
------------------------------

 Recently we were able to resolve a problem with one of our Win95 
 stations using Dial-Up-Networking, and thought we would pass the 
 info on to the Notified ones. The situation: Win95 workstation 
 using DUN to connect with our ISP. Periodically, when disconnecting 
 from the ISP, the workstation would freeze up good and tight. 
 Initially, we suspected hardware conflicts, or the possibility of a 
 corrupt driver -- the fix is much simpler. Although we do not run 
 NetBios, seems that the file VNBT386 in the \windows\system 
 directory was causing us grief . . . its mere existence was the 
 problem. After removing this file, presto, no more hangups. If 
 you're in the same boat, with your Win95 station freezing on you 
 when disconnecting DUN connections, you may want to rename this 
 file to see how things go. Special thanks go out to the gang at 
 WUGNET for this tip!

----------------------------------
One Stop Patching For IntranetWare
----------------------------------

 Peanuts, patches, get your patches here. The IntranetWare 
 administrator's life has just been made that little bit easier, 
 care of the IntranetWare Support Pack. Now available from Novell, 
 the Support Pack is a comprehensive set of patches -- including 
 updates for all IntranetWare components -- in one sleek and compact 
 download. As an added bonus, the support pack includes an 
 integrated installation program, making the patching process quick, 
 and easy. Download it now from Novell's web site, or wait until the 
 96-12 edition of Support Connection.

Two New Exams From Microsoft
----------------------------

 certifications should take note, two new exams are now live: NT 
 Server 4.0 (test 70-67) and NT Server 4.0 Enterprise (test 70-68). 
 As for the new NT 4.0 workstation exam . . .according to

 and simple to hit the waves. Included with the updated Connection

Well Rounded Backup and Virus Coverage From McAfee
--------------------------------------------------

 Why use multiple products for your backup and virus protection 
 needs when you can get the same functionality -- and then some -- 
 using the new VirusScan Deluxe, from McAfee. The first integrated 
 anti-virus/backup suite includes new features not available in 
 other McAfee products, including: convenient push-button virus 
 signature file updating, the first anti-virus tutorial, hypertext 
 virus encyclopedia, a new ScreenScan feature and, of course, one 
 full year of free product upgrades. Tight, clean integration with 
 Windows 95 and NT makes this package easy to use and configure. 
 Flexible features abound, and the new ScreenScan utility allows you 
 to initiate virus scans during idle times . . . automatically. 
 VirusScan Deluxe supports a variety of backup hardware, not to 
 mention the ability to backup to offsite locations, like an FTP 
 site! Priced at $69 (U.S$) VirusScan Deluxe is available 
 immediately.

HP Mopier Attacks Copier Market 
-------------------------------

 No, that's not a typo, it's a Mopier. HP's latest release is the 
 LaserJet 5Si mopier. Instead of relying on photocopiers to produce 
 copies, the new printer is designed for the production of Multiple 
 Original Prints (mopies). Using your trusty mopier you can create 
 mopies right from your desktop. With print speeds (mopy speeds?) at 
 24 ppm, the mopier offers drastically improved paper-handling 
 facilities, like stapling, collating and mailbox bins. With a list 
 price of $9,549 (U.S$) the mopier is priced thousands of dollars 
 less than typical 25-30ppm copiers. Copy copies, print copies, or 
 mopy copies to make mopies cheaper than copies. For details, pop by 
 the HP web site, and be sure to look for the mopy info doc -- 
 "Dispelling The Myths of Mopying" (says he with a straight face).

MAC Users Get Explored - New IE3.0 Beta
---------------------------------------

 RAM. The new browser includes such popular features as HTML 3.2 
 enhancements, Java applet support, personalization, ActiveX 
 Controls, and multimedia support covering AIFF, MIDI, WAV, AU, VR, 
 AVI files and more. Interested users can download their free copy 
 of IE3.0 for the Mac from Microsoft's web site.

Time To Visit the Book Store
----------------------------

 NetWare and GroupWise administrators may want to take a stroll to 
 the local book store to review two hot new releases from IDG and 
 Novell Press. "Novell's Four Principles of NDS Design," provides 
 essential design principles for installing your NetWare 4 services, 
 or redesigning your NDS tree. Authored by members of Novell's 
 Consulting Group, it's sure to be packed with all sorts of juicy 
 tidbits. For GroupWise users, "Novell's GroupWise 5 User's 
 Handbook" gives you the quick and dirty on GroupWise, along with 
 more than 100 "power tips" that are sure to amaze.

USR Cannonballs Into The Pool
----------------------------

 Some slip in, some dive in, and some do a cannonball into the pool 
 -- modem pool that is. USR's new 8-port modem pool solution, the 
 Managed MP/8, is sure to make a BIG splash. Using the same core 
 technology as the USR NETServer/8, the MMP/8 brings the advantages 
 of V.Everything/V.34 technology together with SNMP management 
 capabilities. The MMP/8 allows network managers to manage and 
 configure their modem systems remotely -- a big plus for companies 
 with branch offices. Through the support of Flash-ROM updates, 
 MMP/8 users are a few short months away from being able to upgrade 
 their modems to the upcoming x2 technology -- increasing the speed 
 of your 28.8 modems to a whopping 57 Kbps! With a list price of 
 $3,595 (U.S$) AND the upcoming x2 technology, the MMP/8 is sure to 
 be a crowd pleaser!

Videoconferencing, A Classic from Boca Research
-----------------------------------------------

 Who said videoconferencing had to be expensive? The new Boca Video 
 Phone Classic is an H.324-compliant videoconferencing product, for 
 the bargain basement price of $199 (U.S$). Using a 28.8 or 33.6 
 Kbps modem, the Classic operates over regular phone lines without 
 the requirement for high powered PC's (like all those nasty 
 competitors). Bundled with multiple software packages, including 
 VideoLink and VDOPhone, the Classic allows users to videoconference 
 over the Internet, for the cost of a local phone call. If that 
 weren't enough, the Classic promises crisper, cleaner audio than 
 the competition, with comparable video. 

----------------------------------------
IntranetWare Client for NT -- It's a Snap
----------------------------------------

 NT 3.51 and 4.0 users with IntranetWare and NetWare services will 
 be tickled with Novell's new IntranetWare Client for Windows NT. 
 The new NT client offers all sorts of goodies including one-stop 
 GUI logins, co-existence with Microsoft peer-to-peer services, 
 auto-reconnection to servers, printers and other net resources, RAS 
 support, and full NDS support! Add to that an updated version of 
 Novell's Application Launcher v1.1, and the upcoming release of 
 Novell's Workstation Manager (due this fall) -- a very cool util to 
 integrate NT workstations into IntranetWare environments, and you 
 have all the makings for a top-notch client. Interested net pros 
 can download the new client from the NWCLIENT forum on CompuServe, 
 or Novell's web site.
