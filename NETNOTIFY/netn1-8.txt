 The Loss of Responsibility
 -------------------------- 

 Welcome Back Notified Ones! 

 Over the past few years, you have more than likely read at least 
 a half dozen articles talking about the "explosion" of the 
 Internet, of the Web, and of commerce on the net. There's more to 
 it than that though. The exponential growth of the Internet has 
 created an even more radical "explosion" - one of 
 irresponsibility. While the internet community continues to grow, 
 that growth doesn't just represent a new breed of "netizens". It 
 also represents more scapegoats than ever before. Private and 
 potentially confidential information (that people would have 
 guarded closely 5 years ago) is freely distributed across the net 
 without a care in the world. And why worry when there are so many 
 potential people to blame, right? Wrong.

 The Internet presents a virtually infinite number of 
 possibilities to help improve communications, crossing boundaries 
 of race, religion and sex. In return, it asks for one simple 
 thing that many just can't seem to deliver. Being responsible for 
 ones own actions has always been important, but in the world of 
 the internet, it's even more important. Consider something in 
 your life that you regard as private information. Let's say, your 
 visa card number. Would you take out a front page ad in the New 
 York times that said "Hi. My name is Joe and my visa card number 
 is X"? Of course not. So why, oh why, would you publish that 
 information on your home page. Then, to make matters worse, add 
 that home page to one of the many search engines on the web? If 
 someone sees your web page then uses your credit card number, 
 granted that would be illegal, but whose fault would it be for 
 letting that information out into the public domain. Yours, your 
 ISPS, or maybe the owners of the search engine?
 
 << Insert obnoxious sound of needle scratching across record.>>
 
 Alright, enough of the deep thought. This is the NetNotify 
 Editorial, and for all you long time subscribers, you know what 
 that means! For the newbee's on the block, time for a crash 
 course. There's lots of wacky things going on out there in the 
 electronic world, many of which I stumble upon (or crash into for 
 that matter). Stupid Pet tricks? BAH! Try Stupid User tricks. 
 We'll never provide the persons full name, nor will we give the 
 company name either (we sort of have this thing against libel 
 suits) but where there's a bonehead, we'll sniff them out and 
 bark like the dogs we really are!
 
 So let's get down to biz. What's all this "private" information, 
 and "responsibility" stuff that we're talking about? Consider 
 Mike, our latest winner for the Ultimate Bonehead award. You see, 
 Mike has this problem, and in reality, it's no different than the 
 problem that many of us face -- SPAM. You know, that disgusting 
 lunch meat that comes in a can (who the heck ever thought putting 
 meat in a can was a good thing, we have no idea!) The difference 
 here really comes down to responsibility. Should we take 
 responsibility for SPAM? Definitely not. But, who do you blame?
 
 In Mike's case, CompuServe is at fault. In fact, they're liable
 (according to him at least, go figure). The argument is this. 
 Mike receives spam (are we oozing sympathy yet?) and he feels 
 that CompuServe is to blame because they did not adequately 
 protect information which he considers private -- his email 
 address. OK, entirely new topic (is an email address private and 
 confidential) but let's give that one to him. Mike doesn't think 
 he advertises his address, so in his opinion, OBVIOUSLY it's 
 CompuServe's fault, right?
 
 Well Notified ones, your trusty pal in NetNotify land was 
 curious. So, taking 30 seconds out of an already busy schedule, I 
 popped over to a few search engines on the net and ran a browse 
 on Mike's email ID. Low and behold, cha-ching, out pops the 
 booty. A really pretty web page for an Internet club that he is a 
 member of. Pop over to this page, and behold, a listing of 
 members and their email accounts. To further complicate matters, 
 above the listing of club members and their email accounts was 
 the heading "Members who have expressed the desire to have their 
 names listed here."
 
 With this new found information, we posted our response to Mike's 
 public attacks on CompuServe - "Hey Mike, you say that your 
 information is private. Tell me, are you the same Mike that is a 
 member of the X Internet Club." Now to us, the rational response 
 would be "Ahhh, maybe that's where they're getting my email 
 address from." Instead, the response we received was that we just 
 proved how "big brother" and "hackers" could infiltrate sensitive 
 and private information. Furthermore, as a user of CompuServe, it 
 is (in his opinion) CompuServe's responsibility to protect his 
 email address. So. The ISP is allegedly responsible for a user's 
 stupidity for posting an email address on a PUBLIC web page? 
 Better still, by finding out that he was a member of this club, 
 we supposedly demonstrated how hackers can break into private and 
 confidential databases. Hello???
 
 No matter how we slice it, we just can't seem to figure out how 
 an ISP like CompuServe is supposed to be liable for breaching a 
 user's "privacy" when the user foolishly broadcasts that 
 information on a public medium. To confuse us further, last we 
 checked, it didn't take a "hacker", "big brother" or a rocket 
 scientist like Mike to use Alta Vista. So we're turning to you. 
 Our trusty Notified ones! If there's anyone that can explain this 
 one, drop us a line at mailto:netnotify-suggest@netcent.com, we'd 
 love to hear from you.
 
 Enough about Mike already! Lets dig in.....

 What's New and Feedback
 =======================
 
 Since our last edition, we regret to say that we haven't had much 
 of an opportunity to work on the new services. A little bugglet 
 snuck up on us with Edition 7 that forced us to redirect our 
 resources. We have made one minor enhancement though. Given the 
 number of suggestions we receive, and the feedback that we get, 
 we have since decided to expand the What's New area slightly. 
 This expansion will address some of the questions and suggestions 
 that we receive from our subscribers. The number of entries will 
 be kept to a minimum, and the responses - short and sweet. 
 
 J. Tachmal wrote: "I noticed that when you're quoting prices, 
 you don't mention the currency involved. Would it be possible 
 to include this information in future editions?"
 
 NetNotify: "Most definitely! To date, virtually all pricing has 
 been quoted in U.S. dollars. Consider it done."
 
 K. Staples: "Why doesn't NetNotify cover any vendor but Novell?"
 
 NetNotify: "NetNotify covers much more than just Novell, it 
 always has. We have had bulletins for vendors such as NetPro, 
 Adaptec, Cheyenne, Compaq, Hewlett Packard, SCO and many others. 
 We are trying to add more vendors to the listing, but sometimes, 
 things just don't move as quickly as one would hope."
 
 Q. Paxton: "I'm interested in helping out with NetNotify. Are you 
 interested in getting more writers to help with product 
 reviews?"
 
 NetNotify: "DEFINITELY! Anyone interested in  writing product 
 reviews should send an email to mailto:darchell@netcent.com with 
 "WRITING PRODUCT REVIEWS" in the subject line. In the message, 
 include details on your technical and writing background, as well 
 as your contact information and we will take it from there."

 Grab the Calamine Lotion, IE3 Is a Wee Bit Buggy
 ------------------------------------------------
 
 For those who haven't upgraded to the production version of IE3.0 
 just yet, you may want to hold off for now. One minor little 
 bugglet that can become a real annoyance is in regards to 
 accessing certain password protected sites. Normally when you 
 access a password protected site, you enter your user ID and 
 password once. Unfortunately, when the production version of 
 IE3.0 is used, some sites will require you to enter your user ID 
 and password whenever you move from page to page within the site. 
 Acknowledged by Microsoft, this bugglet has been pegged as an 
 inconvenience issue and does not affect system security.

 Novell Opens The Taps - The River is Flowing!
 ---------------------------------------------
 
 Wait no longer, NetWare 4.11 (aka Green River) is now in open 
 beta. With NetWare Web Server 2.5, a NetBasic scripting tool for 
 creating intranet applications that can access NDS, and a whole 
 lot more, there's a lot of coolness packed into this beta! For a 
 nominal shipping and handling fee, users can request their copies 
 of the open beta through Novell's web site, or by calling Novell 
 directly.

 Cisco Support Targets Small- and Medium-Sized Businesses

 Ever felt that a vendor just didn't really care about your 
 business because you're not a large organization? If you have, 
 you better checkout Cisco's two new service and support programs:  
 CiscoPro Remote Configuration and CiscoPro Onsite Response. 
 CiscoPro Remote Configuration provides customers with 
 personalized telephone assistance and configuration via a modem 
 for CiscoPro products, from a CiscoPro engineer. Once everything 
 is up and running, that's when the CiscoPro Onsite Response 
 program really shines. Offering immediate access to Cisco 
 technical support, access to support info through the Cisco 
 Connection Online, and more, this isn't just a nice thing to 
 have, it's a MUST have. If you're tired of getting the run-around 
 from some vendors out there, just do yourself a favor and call 
 your Cisco reseller today.

 So, you have a few minutes of spare time? Great! Interactive 
 Imaginations' latest game, Aha!, is the first interactive game 
 built exclusively for the IE3.0 Web Browser. Aha! incorporates 
 Microsoft's ActiveX technology and features a variety of puzzles 
 that are sure to stump even the most experienced brain bender. 
 Interactive Imaginations' renowned Riddler.com game site pulls in 
 close to 150,000 users. With most users staying on the site for 
 at least 1 hr, while others play for 6-7 hours at a time, this 
 baby is more than capable of helping to deal with all that free 
 time you have floating around. Please don't send the NetNotify

 Hewlett Packard Means Color Printing
 ------------------------------------
 
 Cost effective, high quality color printing is even better now 
 thanks to HP's newest printer -- the HP DeskJet 870C. A 
 replacement for the 850C, the 870C offers almost everything under 
 the sun needed by small workgroups. With a list price of $599 
 (U.S.) it comes raring to go, delivering black text at 600x600 
 dpi (8 ppm) and color at 600x300 dpi (4 ppm.) Not only is the 
 870C the fastest in its class, but it also boasts the largest 
 professional font collection available in a personal color 
 printer, and HP's Real Imaging System: for the most vivid colors 
 you'll find. That's just the beginning though. Connecting to your 
 peer-to-peer networks - no problem. HP's Tool Box for Windows 
 software (also included) will make things just that much easier 
 to be up and running in no time flat. For more details, give your 
 local HP Authorized reseller a ring, or drop by their web site 
 today.

 Taking Control of the Net - SMS v1.2
 ------------------------------------
 
 Sometimes, managing a network can be a real pain. Tracking 
 inventory, software distribution, remote diagnostics, and the 
 ability to monitor the network are all tasks that must be done. 
 But how? Sure, you can cough up an arm and a leg, but is there a 
 better way - yes, the just released Systems Management Server 
 v1.2 from Microsoft. Added bonuses for this management gem 
 include secure remote control of Windows NT workstations (can you 
 say - no need to leave your desk?), greatly improved network 
 monitoring, and Inventory control (just what is Joe running on 
 that computer of his?) Available through distributors throughout 
 Canada and the US now, a 5 user version can be yours for roughly 
 $923 (U.S.) for the server license. Further details are available 
 through your local reseller, or Microsoft's web site.

 A Color Printer For Less Than $200!
 -----------------------------------
 
 Seems that Hewlett Packard's marketing group needs a reality 
 check. For some reason, the gang has decided to let their latest 
 color home printer go for less than $200(U.S.) The DeskJet 400 
 offers consumers with color printing at 300x300 dpi, black 
 printing at 600x300 dpi, and standard output of 3 ppm. Not only 
 do you get high quality and the reliability that we've all come 
 to love about HP printers, but this gem makes switching between 
 color and black text a snap -- literally! Just snap that black 
 cartridge out and the color cartridge in....it's that simple. 
 Surely someone at HP made a mistake pricing this one, so you 
 better grab yours before they realize what a steal it is and 
 increase the price!

 Free GroupWise or NetWare Upgrade Anyone?
 -----------------------------------------
 
 Just when you thought you could finally start spending money, and 
 stop collecting on all the free offers out there, Novell has 
 spoiled all the fun. You already know about the great free 
 upgrade offer for GroupWise, so let's talk NetWare 4.11 (aka 
 Green River.) Starting Aug 15th, and running for 30 days after 
 4.11 ships, anyone purchasing NetWare 4.1 will be entitled to a 
 free upgrade to 4.11! So, if you've been planning on purchasing 
 NetWare 4.1 in the near future, you better hang on to those 
 reseller invoices - they'll be needed to qualify for the free 
 upgrades! Full details on the 4.11 upgrade offer will be made 
 available on Novell's web site and through the FaxBack service 
 after Sept 15th. 
 
 What's that? You forgot about the free GroupWise upgrade 
 offer....oh ok, pop over to http://www.novell.com/groupwise/ for

 in your ventures! Unfortunately, there can be only one winner, 
 and that winner is . . . <drumroll please> . . . Michael Musial 
 of New York <insert applause>!
 
 Congrats Michael, and good luck!
 
 For all the other subscribers out there, don't forget the two 
 contests still in effect: the BDU Awards, and the COLDCA$H 
 contest. Details on these two contests can be found in Edition 7 
 of NetNotify, available through our FTP site.
