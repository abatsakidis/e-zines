From Printers to Spam - We've Got You Covered
---------------------------------------------

Imagine our suprise, when from out of the blue, a quasi-competition 
newsletter hits our e-mail inbox bragging of readership levels of 
2,000,000. The publication, Web Link News, is put out there by 
Printerm Datascribe -- making us even more curious. Where did this 
publication come from? How did they get 2,000,000 readers? Is the 
printer business THAT bad, whereby a reputable company must jump 
into the SPAM business? Curious about this new publication, we 
decided to dig in and investigate.

What we found, it's not pretty. One piece of misinformation after 
another, not to mention complaints about them in the net-abuse 
newsgroups on the net. What kind of misinformation. . . . oh, 
let's see.

Details within the publication state that their distribution is 
2,000,000 readers. Visit their web site, you'll read how the 
distribution levels are 100,000 readers. Now, that's a pretty 
substantial difference - no? Of course, it does get better. Issuing 
a query command on their distribution list server returns results 
of 430 members -- that's it! But wait, there's more! Why rely on 
printed material when you can get it straight from the horse's 
mouth, and that's just where we went, Charles Katz, "publisher" of 
Web Link News. Putting on our best slime-ball suit, we gave Charles 
a ring to get the lowdown, with three basic questions:

Q. How many people subscribe to Web Link News?
A. Only a couple thousand, but we send it out to 2,000,000 user IDs 
anyway.

Q. What kind of response is Web Link News receiving?
A. Excellent. We're getting calls from everywhere.

Q. Aren't you folks the printer people??
A. Yes. But we found so many people wanted this information, that 
we've started our own bulk E-mail services.

Does this bother us. . . yup. Not because it's competition - we 
love healthy competition. The problem, 2,000,000 people are 
allegedly being spammed here. While there's a small amount of 
computer and web related information, the Web Link News "Market 
Place" section really defines the publication -- with ads like "You 
can earn an extra $60,000 over the next year" and "Market your 
product to over 2,000,000 people on the Internet for only $125". 
Last, but not least, it's SPAM services that make it difficult for 
legitimate e-zines (and there are a lot of them out there) to 
generate vendor support.

The effect of SPAM on the net is far greater than just a few extra 
messages in your inbox. As the number of SPAM services like this 
rise, publications that you have come to depend on -- like 
NetNotify -- face an increasingly difficult battle. Why? Simply 
put, bad impressions. When vendors get hit with SPAM like Printerm 
Datascribe's publication, many will become very reluctant to 
support other e-zines on the net, and rightfully so.

It is our personal opinion that SPAM services, like Printerm 
Datascribe's, pose a serious threat to publishers of all shapes and 
sizes, trying to operate in a "net friendly" manner.  To this end, 
we have investigated their services, and have escalated formal 
complaints to their affiliated providers:

SERVTECH.COM - Primary email domain for Printerm Datascribe
   Postmaster: postmaster@servtech.com
   Admin Contact, Dean Maxwell: dam@servtech.com
   Tech Contact, Justin Collins: jcollins@servtech.com 

BISINC.COM - Web Provider for Printerm's Bulk Email services
   Postmaster: postmaster@bisinc.com
   Admin/Tech Contact, Ted Buck: ted@bisinc.com

The last mailing from Printerm Datascribe was sent out this past 
weekend. For that mailing, the services of TotalNet Inc., 
(ACCENT.NET and TOTAL.NET) were utilized by Printerm Datascribe.  
We are happy to say that we received a response from their 
representative, Alain Grandemange, in less than 2 hrs of 
transmitting our complaint.  We are even happier to say that 
Printerm Datascribe's accounts there have now been suspended. 
TotalNet's quick response to this situation goes to show, there are 
some great ISPs out there!

The SPAM services of Printerm Datascribe are still in their 
infancy, but they can pick-up very quickly if not addressed. If you 
don't want your email addresses sold, and abused by SPAM services 
like this, or if you've been hit by Printerm's SPAM already, make 
your feelings known to Printerm and their two current providers.

Compaq Coverage Dropped from NetNotify
--------------------------------------

Although we regret to say it, until further notice, coverage of 
Compaq patches and new products will not be included within 
NetNotify. Unfortunately we haven't been able to generate 
sufficient interest from Compaq to continue the coverage. 

-----------------------------------------
Help Shape NetNotify - Our Current Survey
-----------------------------------------

If you haven't already done so, please take a few minutes of 
your time to complete the current NetNotify Reader Survey.  
Results from this survey will be used to shape the future of 
NetNotify, for the people that matter most -- the subscribers. 
The survey is available through the web, and can be found at 
the URL http://www.netcent.com/netnotify/nn-survey.htm .

-------------------------
NetNotify Needs Your Help
-------------------------

The NetNotify Resource center is in the works. Although there 
are various topics that will be addressed, the first phase of 
this center involves a type of "bookshelf", filled with 
listings of FAQs, discussion lists, and other e-zines - all 
related to the computer networking industry. To build this 
area, we're asking for your assistance. If you are the author 
of an industry FAQ, or you run a related discussion list, drop 
us a line at mailto:netnotify-suggest@netcent.com and give us 
all the details. Even if you don't run a list or FAQ, but you 
know someone that does - please pass this note on to them.

Jack-In With a Personal Web Server for 95 -- And It's Free
----------------------------------------------------------

Windows 95 users can now have a web presence of their own, for free 
-- excluding those nasty connect time charges -- thanks to 
Microsoft's new Personal Web Server (PWS) for 95 product. Designed 
primarily for small workgroups, businesses, and home users, use PWS 
to publish and share information through the Web and corporate 
intranets. Slick and easy to integrate with Windows 95, PWS turns 
any Win95 based computer into a low volume web server. Sharing HTML 
documents and FTP files through Control Panel or the Win95 taskbar 
-- a cinch! Installation is a breeze, and it's quick too. To 
download your free copy, skip over to the Microsoft web site today.

out there will be tickled to hear that Spyglass has generously 
offered to give away their HTML Validator software, for free. Using 
this handy dandy tool, developers can check HTML code before 
uploading to their web sites. Review your pages for errors, and

future. To download your free copy today, pop by

Free Software, $100, And A MessagePad For Dad

great offer for all you gift seekers. Purchase a MessagePad 130 
handheld computer between now and Jan 31, 1997 and Apple will throw 
in a coupon for the ultra-cool Win2Go Software (estimated value, 
$180 US). Using Win2Go, MessagePad users can seamlessly transfer 
files from a wide variety of MS Office for Windows applications -- 
including Word and Schedule+. But wait, there's more (the makings 
of a game show host or what?). Not only do you get the Win2Go 
Software for free, but Apple has cut the SRP of the MessagePad from 
$799 to a modest $699. A great gift idea for Mom, Dad, or your 
favorite NetNotify Editor.

Finally - REAL NetWare NLM Management
-------------------------------------

So. You're working this weekend, updating the NLMs on all your 
NetWare servers. Why?? Sure, you need to stay up-to-date, but dare 
to dream. Imagine an application that can scan all your servers, 
locating which NLMs are loaded in to the server's memory, or on 
disk. Compare the versions to standards, then transmit the required 
updates, including related messages files -- automatically, from a 
central location. Remotely configure and distribute NCF files. 
Sounds like a fairy tale . . . well it's not, it's the latest 
release from NetPro Computing; Config Central for NetWare. 
Supporting NetWare 3.12 and 4.1 environments was never easier, 
especially since Config Central can snap right in to NWAdmin or 
your trusty ManageWise installation. Licensed per server, a 10-
server starter pack can be yours for only $499 (U.S$). Get all the 
details by calling NetPro Computing today, or visit their web site 
to download a free evaluation copy of your very own.

New PowerBook 1400 Series - A Definition of Cool
------------------------------------------------

Slick. Powerful. Cool. The only ways to describe the new PowerBook 
1400 series of notebooks from Apple. Equipped with a 6X-speed CD-
ROM drive, the 1400 series comes raring to go -- with the base 
models equipped with 117MHz PowerPC 603e processors, 12Mb of RAM 
(expandable to 64MB) and a 750MB hard drive. Through the built-in 
infrared technology, you'll be sharing files with other systems in 
no time flat. What's a hard drive without software, right? That's 
why your PowerBook comes pre-configured with a variety of 
applications: including ClarisWorks, ClarisOrganizer, Claris 
Emailer Lite, the Apple Internet Connection Kit and more. For the 
finishing touches, the PowerBook has a customizable BookCover pane 
-- a removable clear exterior panel that can be changed to alter 
the appearance of your PowerBook. Today, the PowerBook is black. 
Tomorrow, a funky pattern of your choosing. Starting at a SRP of 
$2,500 (U.S$) the 1400 series will be available mid-November.

Protect Your Lotus Notes Data with McAfee
-----------------------------------------

Singing the anti-virus blues? Need to protect those Lotus Notes 
systems, but just don't know where to turn? Then pop over to 
McAfee's site for info on their native Notes Anti-Virus solutions: 
GroupScan and GroupShield. Protect your Notes desktops with 
GroupScan, and your servers with GroupShield. Get all the bells and 
whistles too: virus detection, quarantine, scanning encrypted

bombs, and a whole lot more. Selling for a mere $30(U.S$) per node, 
that's a pretty sound investment.
