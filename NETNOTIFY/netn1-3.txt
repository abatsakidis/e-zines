Greetings Notified Ones!

It has been two short weeks since we popped into your email 
basket and we're back with more great information.  In fact, only 
in edition 3, we have some changes to announce due to the 
feedback we have been getting from our subscribers. 

Previously, we asked readers for ways in which to improve the 
publication to add even more value. From the many responses that 
we received, change is now in the wind:

Increased Frequency - A key request from subscribers was to go 
from a bi-weekly to a weekly publication. Doing so not only gets 
the information to you faster, it also reduces the amount of 
reading you have on your plate.  Our weekly publication will 
start distribution on June 16th.

Views and Reviews - Our proposal to include product reviews 
related to the networking industry received a very positive 
response. Watch for our reviews section starting with the 
following issue!

Hot Sites - A new section will be added to NetNotify called "Hot 
Sites".  This section will provide references to hot new sites 
that our subscribers recommend.  If you have a site that you 
think is hot, drop a line in our suggestion box.  After we review 
that site, if it's HOT, watch future editions of NetNotify for a 
reference.

A common response that we received from our subscribers, which to 
be perfectly honest, was shocking, were wide spread offers of 
support and assistance. Although we just could not respond to 
every message that we received, for those making offers, a big 
thanks goes out to you! At this time, there are only two areas 
where assistance could be used - recommendations and vendor 
contacts.  We already have thousands of subscribers, but there is 
still a nice chunk of the industry that doesn't know about us.  
By all means, feel free to tell your friends, associates and user 
groups about NetNotify!

As for vendor contacts. We're always interested in providing 
details on patches and promo's from leading vendors in the 
industry.  If you have a contact at one of these vendors and 
think they would be well suited to NetNotify, please drop us a 
line at netnotify-marketing@netcent.com.

At NetNotify, we are always looking for ways to improve and add 
value for our subscribers. Literally, as you read this message, a 
great new service is being created.  No details on what this 
service will be (don't want to take the fun out of it) BUT, Phase 
1 of this service will be directed at all you Microsoft and 
Novell certified professionals out there! If you are a consultant 
with your MCP, MCSE, CNE or MCNE, or if you are an ATEC or NAEC 
and would like to hear how you could take advantage of this new 
service, drop our marketing group a line for the low down!

Last but not least, a word of warning. The past two weeks have 
been abnormally slow.  The number of new patches and fixes from 
the vendors that we monitor is greatly reduced, looks like all 
the software is running A-OK now ;-). Furthermore, everyone must 
have a lot of extra money floating around since the number of 
freebie offers and promo's has dropped off.hmmmmmm. Just wanted 
you to know, we're still on the ball!

`Nuff said, on with the show!

NetNotify Goes HTML? - Survey Says......
----------------------------------------

The vote on whether to go to an HTML format is over.  It was very 
close, too close for comfort actually, but the Nay's have won.  
For the time being, NetNotify will remain as is, not as an HTML 
document.  From the comments we received, one thing was apparent: 
confusion.  The comments that were provided from some subscribers 
made it obvious that they were a little confused about what was 
involved in providing an HTML version of the newsletter.  

Due to the amount of confusion, in a few weeks we are going to 
provide a SMALL sample copy of what the HTML version would look 
like. This sample will NOT contain all of the regular content in 
NetNotify but will give you and idea of what to expect. More on 
this as things progress.
