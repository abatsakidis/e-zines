 IMPORTANT - A Must Read! 
 ------------------------
 
  Edition 9 is here, the last of the single digit editions <<insert 
  applause>>.  Unfortunately, this edition's editorial will be a 
  little different than the rest.  Instead of being fun, there are 
  a few business issues that we must address. :-( 
 
  Since edition 1, a prime goal was to deliver NetNotify in a 
  format, and with the content, that people want most.  Many of our 
  subscribers have taken the opportunity to drop us a line with 
  some great suggestions. Although all feedback to date has 
  been helpful, determining which suggestions represent the 
  majority is no small task.
 
  To ensure that we are on track, and so we know where to start 
  dedicating our resources, we are asking all readers to take a few 
  minutes to complete the NetNotify Reader Survey.  Feedback from 
  this survey will be used to determine the future of the NetNotify 
  newsletter.
 
  Readers can access the survey from the NetNotify Web site, 
  http://www.netcent.com/netnotify/nn-survey.htm . We do realize 
  that some people just hate jumping to the web, but given the 
  number of subscribers we have now, conducting a survey like this 
  through an email message would be too difficult, if not 
  impossible, to handle effectively.  
  
  Realistically, the survey should take no more than 5-10 minutes 
  to complete. Please take a few minutes out of your schedule 
  between now and September 30th to complete this survey. The more 
  people that respond, the greater the chance of delivering the 
  information that people want most.
  
  The second, more serious issue, is in regards to NetNotify 
  content.  Although we've made these points clear in the past, 
  given a few queries we've received in the last couple weeks, a 
  refresher is in order.
  
  At NetNotify, we make every reasonable effort to ensure that 
  information provided to our subscribers is accurate. 
  Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of all 
  information. When reading NetNotify, please keep this in mind: 
  all information is provided AS IS, without any warranty of any 
  kind.
  
  In regards to file patches/fixes, and references to software or 
  other resources, the reliability of those products are not 
  guaranteed in any way by the publisher, or representatives of 
  NetNotify. For example, if you download a patch from vendor X, 
  and said patch hoses your system, that is not our responsibility.  
  The NetNotify services are here to help network professionals by 
  pointing them to new and exciting things in the networking 
  industry. We do not accept liability of any kind for what another 
  vendors product(s) may/may not do to your systems.
  
  As a subscriber to NetNotify, or someone reading NetNotify 
  through one of our download sites, please take a few moments of 
  your time to read the disclaimer message available on the web 
  site at http://www.netcent.com/netnotify/nn-disclaimer.htm . If 
  you do NOT agree with the terms and conditions within our service 
  disclaimer, please unsubscribe immediately. The disclaimer is 
  essentially a standard document that defines the terms of use for 
  the NetNotify services.
  
  Enough of the boring mumbo-jumbo already. . . on with the show.

 Patch that Internet Explorer 3.0 Bug Today!
 -------------------------------------------
 
  A new patch for Internet Explorer 3.0, resolving two problems 
  with Microsoft's web browser software, is now available. The 
  first issue resolved, although not critical, is in regards to 
  some web sites that require user passwords to gain access to the 
  pages. The production version of IE3.0 would force users to re-
  enter their user ID and password for each page accessed, instead 
  of just one time to access the site in question. The second, more 
  serious issue, involves a potential security breach discovered by 
  researchers at Princeton University. Under normal operation, when 
  downloading application documents from the Internet, IE3.0 will 
  warn users about the potential for viruses present within the 
  document (i.e. macro viruses). In some cases though, Princeton 
  was able to defeat this security check.

  ensure full compatibility with other factory installed software, 
  hardware, and peripherals, Dell is the first computer vendor to 
  ship systems pre-installed with NT Workstation 4.0. Why bother

 Scanning for Up to 33 Percent Less
 ----------------------------------
 
  Pass the Ginsu please! Hewlett-Packard has slashed the pricing of 
  their ScanJet 4c and 4s Scanners by up to 33 percent. The ScanJet 
  4c, a flatbed scanner which used to list for $1,179 (US) is 
  expected to sell for as little as $899, effective September 1. 
  The 4s, a sheet-fed grayscale scanner is available for roughly 
  $199 (US). When you combine HP's latest price cuts, and their 
  standard one year warranty and free technical support, the 
  ScanJets are quickly becoming a staple for scanner fans.
