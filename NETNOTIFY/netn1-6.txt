Sometimes, You Just Gotta Laugh!
--------------------------------

   Hello again NetNotify subscribers! 

   There's more to this industry than performance statistics and sales 
   pitches. There's humor. Yes indeed, humor.  Situations that can 
   have you laughing so hard, you'll be crying up a storm.

   Case in point.  If you noticed, in this edition, we've addressed 
   you as the "NetNotify Subscribers" instead of the "Notified Ones".  
   Hmmmm, why you ask? Well, for that answer and more, you'll really 
   need to ask Dave (last name withheld to protect the guilty). You 
   see, as the publisher for NetNotify, I get a LOT of email. On 
   average, 200-300 private messages per day. But last week, one 
   message really stuck out, from Dave of coarse. The situation is 
   this, Dave was, well, ummmm, how can we say this politely....offended  
   that he was referred to as a Notified one.  It seems that 
   Dave's been in the industry for 4 years now, has his CNA, and runs 
   a "large and hectic LAN of 117 users". With this experience, 
   apparently a certain degree of respect is warranted. I was a little 
   skeptical myself, but Dave's 31.3k message describing his 
   experience, and the type of respect that he should be shown (did I 
   mention he was a CNA?) made me think. What did I think about? 
   Hmmmmm. Well. Apparently someone has WAY too much time on their 
   hands. I guess the only thing I can say on this matter: Dave, sit 
   back, close your eyes and cross your legs.  Now, repeat after me.  
   I'm good enough. I'm smart enough. And gosh darnit, people like me!

   Lesson of the Day : NetNotify is supposed to be informative, yet, 
   it should also be FUN. If you don't enjoy reading the newsletter, 
   we're doing something wrong.

   Sometimes, the funny stuff doesn't come to you automatically 
   though. Let's consider Bob (again, last name withheld to protect 
   the guilty). Bob was an early subscriber to NetNotify. A few weeks 
   ago, he sent us a note requesting permission to post copies of the 
   newsletter on his web site. We were really delighted with this 
   request, and told Bob that as long as it was posted, as is, that 
   would not be a problem.  Apparently though, Bob took this to mean 
   that he could post the newsletter, AND change all occurrences of 
   the word NetNotify, to a new newsletter name, and even change the 
   name of the publisher to his own. Hmmmmm. When we reminded Bob what 
   the word COPYRIGHT meant, his response: "You were really serious 
   about that?" Sometimes, you just gotta wonder.

   In tribute to the Bobs and Daves of the world, we have a very 
   special contest kicking off with this edition -- The BDU Awards. 
   Send in your ballots and you could be the luck winner. Sorry Bob 
   and Dave, you'll need fresh material.

   Like all things fun and humorous, sometimes you need to get down to 
   business.  So, without further delay, here we go!

Sun Microsystems Introduces New Tcl/Tk Plug-In For Netscape
-----------------------------------------------------------

   The crew at Sun Microsystems have done it again with the new Tcl/Tk 
   Netscape plug-in. The new tool, which complements the capabilities 
   of Java, allows developers to create small to medium sized Internet 
   applications, and view those apps through the WWW. Tk, a graphical 
   user interface toolkit, is based on the Tcl embeddable scripting 
   language. Tcl/Tk makes it possible to create web pages, providing 
   custom user interfaces and simple animations within the Navigator 
   viewing area. Don't worry folks, although the initial release is 
   for Netscape, future support for additional browsers such as 
   Microsoft's Internet Explorer is in the works.

   Netscape Navigator users can receive further information about 
   Tcl/Tk and download a free beta version of the Tcl/Tk plug-in from 
   Sun's web site.

   Pssst. Hey buddy, wanna tip?  Unlike NetNotify's friends from

   don't have all the time in the world to horse around. It seems that 
   they've introduced Vycor Enterprise 3.1, a client server help desk 
   suite that can drastically reduce the burden placed on corporate 
   help desks. Apparently, Vycor integrates with McAfee's LAN 
   Management suite. It offers a shared repository of information, a 
   common console, automated data collection mechanisms, and improved 
   messaging capabilities, to name just a few perks. We suggest you 
   surf on over to their site to take a peek for yourself.

Dell Offers NT Server for FREE and Big Price Cuts to Boot!
----------------------------------------------------------

   Are they making too much money, or are they just crazy? Who knows. 
   What we do know is that Dell has slashed prices in the U.S across 
   their PowerEdge network server line; by as much as 18%. Not only 
   that, but running through the end of September, purchase a Dell 
   PowerEdge server and they'll throw in a copy of NT Server, for 
   FREE. Sound crazy? Hmmmm. If you think that's crazy though, you'll 
   think they're really insane when you hear that they'll also factory 
   install and custom configure your software, again, for FREE. Maybe 
   the price cuts and free software are a result of industry component 
   price slashing on memory, processors and tape backup units. That 
   doesn't explain the free NT Server software though, now does it.  
   To be safe, you better give them a call and ask for yourself!
