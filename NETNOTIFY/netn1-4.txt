Still Scratching My Head
------------------------

Every so often someone says something that just floors me. 
Sometimes, I chalk it up as a close encounter of the BDU kind. 
Others can be just too difficult to pass up. You know what I 
mean. The ones that you read once, then twice, trying to figure 
out what planet the person came from.

Last week I was speaking with a couple gents from the planet 
Venus. High level execs in two VERY large organizations in the 
networking industry. Hot companies, hot planet. The purpose of 
the discussions: to get these two companies on-board with 
NetNotify. It's really a very simple process you see. Vendors 
send listings of new patches/fixes to a central location, then 
presto, out the door it goes.

After much discussion, the results still have me scratching my 
head. Although the comments varied slightly between the two 
residents of Venus, the first comment really sums it up:

"Why would one of our clients want this? We post information 
about file updates on our web site. If they want details on new 
patches for our products, all they have to do is visit the site."

Bueller..
Bueller..
Has anyone seen Bueller?

After getting out of the hospital earlier this week (major 
concussion from banging my head against the wall), discussions 
resumed. As it stands right now, our friends from Venus will 
consider participation, but there's a catch. Somehow, I must 
prove that administrators and consultants don't actually have the 
time to surf sites high and low each week looking for new patch 
and promo information.

To this end, I'm looking for feedback from the notified ones. Do 
you like the publication? Does it provide VALUE to you? And, most 
importantly, do you think it's in the vendors best interest to 
participate? 

If you can, please take a few minutes to jot down your feelings 
on this issue and fire them off to netnotify-
marketing@netcent.com.

`Nuff said, on with the show!

Patches and Fixes
=================

 Before jumping into the latest listing of patches, some news and 
 general information.

 A few requests have come in for longer descriptions of each patch 
 listed in NetNotify.  Although we would love to accommodate these 
 requests, at this time it's just not possible.  Descriptions 
 provided are based on the summaries available from the various 
 vendors.  We are working with several vendors to 
 get more descriptive summaries listed, but until that time, we're 
 doing the best we can with what we are given.
  
 To expand on our patches and fixes coverage, a handy new robot is 
 almost ready for prime time. This `bot will allow us to cover an even 
 greater number of vendors automatically. Unfortunately, there is 
 virtually no consistency between vendor FTP sites. If all continues 
 according to planned, the robot will be churning away for the next 
 edition with coverage starting for Novell,Adaptec and Compaq patches. 
 From there, we'll be expanding with <knock on wood> a minimum of two 
 new vendors each week.

 Once the `bot is running at full steam, we will no longer be 
 providing references to forums on CompuServe.  Listings will 
 refer to FTP sites and directories only.

 That said, time to get patched with the following listing of new  
 releases since the last edition of NetNotify.

NetWare Century Fix Coming for Year End		
---------------------------------------

 If you've been wondering what would happen to your NetWare 
 systems when the year 2000 comes around, fear not. Development 
 for 3.11, 3.12 and 4.1 patches has completed and the fixes are 
 moving on to the testing stage. Expect to see updates made 
 available some time by the end of 1996. If they slip..oh well, 
 there's still four years to go ;-)

------------------------------------
Three More Viruses to Keep you Company
------------------------------------

 Once again, the sleuths at Dr. Solomon's have released 
 information about three new viruses that have hit the wires.

 WM.NOP is a new WordMacro virus 'in the wild' in Germany. In 
 order to spread, this virus requires the German version of 
 Microsoft Word for Windows 6.0 or above; under other language 
 versions of Word for Windows, the virus will infect NORMAL.DOT 
 but will not spread further. Infected documents contain the 
 macros AutoOpen and NOP.

 WM.AntiDMV is a new WordMacro virus; it is reportedly in the wild 
 in various Mediterranean countries. Although designed only to 
 spread until 1 June 1996, it is possible that many infected 
 documents and templates may still exist. 

 WM.AntiDMV contains only one macro, AutoOpen. If an infected 
 document is opened under Microsoft Word for Windows, and your 
 system date is set prior to Jun 1 1996, the virus infects 
 NORMAL.DOT. The virus also removes the macro AutoClose from 
 documents and templates, if it exists.

 Hare.7610 [aliases Krsna and HDEuthanasia] is a new virus which 
 has been reported repeatedly in many countries around the word 
 [United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Russia]. The 
 virus infects COM and EXE files on execution as well as the 
 Master Book Record and boot sector.  Infected files grow in size 
 by between 7630 bytes to 7800 bytes [approximately]. 

 The virus overwrites the partition table in the MBR. When the PC 
 is booted from a clean system disk, the hard disk is inaccessible 
 at a DOS level. Access is normal when the PC is booted from the 
 hard disk.

 On August 22 and September 22, the virus will produce the 
 following message, and will then proceed to overwrite all system 
 hard disks.

  "HDEuthanasia" by Demon Emperor: Hare Krsna, hare, hare...

So Long NOVHW
-------------

 CompuServe, the Novell Hardware forum (GO NOVHW) has been put out 
 to pasture. New message areas are available in the NOVCLIENT, 
 NETW3X and NETW4X forums to facilitate this change. Be sure to 
 adjust your online readers to compensate for this change!

------------------------
CompuServe Gets Explored
------------------------

 Normally I'm not a betting man, but a year ago I would have bet 
 the farm that it wouldn't happen. Now it has. So what's "it"? 
 "It" is a very cozy deal between CompuServe and Microsoft. This 
 new alliance involves the distribution of the CompuServe 
 Information Service and WOW! with the Windows 95 OS. CompuServe 
 will also be promoting Internet Explorer as its primary Web 
 browser, which will be included in CompuServe 3.0 (currently in 
 beta.)

----------------------------------------
