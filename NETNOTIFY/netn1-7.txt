 Food Stamps Anyone?
 -------------------

  Welcome Back Notified Ones! 


  After a minor hiccup that resulted in a one week hiatus, we're 
  back in your mailbox, bigger and better. For those that noticed 
  the one week glitch and sent us a note to see if we're still here 
  - HOWDY <insert cyber-wave>! We've got a lot to ground to cover, 
  and some changes to let you know about. Before jumping into all 
  the fun stuff (like those patches we all love to hate), what 
  would an edition of NetNotify be without the insightful 
  commentary <insert boo's>! 

  What is it with the Internet that can turn the typical "big 
  spender" into a real penny pincher? A person that wouldn't balk 
  at spending $80,000 for a car (that they drive only during those 
  summer weekends) yet getting them to pay $30 of $40 for an 
  application or resource that they use religiously is like pulling 
  teeth.

  Recently I had the opportunity to participate in an interesting 
  chat (read - heated argument) regarding the commercial aspects of 
  the net with a good friend of mine we'll call Henry. Henry is 
  fairly well off. As an independent "high level" consultant, his 
  time can be yours for the bargain basement price of $1,500/day 
  (that's Canadian folks, works out to about $19.95 US.) Needless 
  to say, Henry's not hurting.

  For this discussion, the issue at hand was his distress over a 
  product that he uses all the time.  Previously available for free 
  as a beta version, getting the latest release (now production) 
  would run him a whopping $49.95. Earth shattering news to say the 
  least.  Now, Henry has to take a couple days off work to locate a 
  new product to use, and to rewrite some of his personal programs 
  that are linked with the application. 

      <Scratch head now>

  OK, OK. You're thinking, why? Good question my notified ones, 
  precisely the question I asked! Although we've been great friends 
  for some time, little did I realize that Henry suffered from one 
  of the worst Internet related illnesses around - Freebeeism. 
  Currently, Freebeeism is not recognized by the CDC as a serious 
  threat, but give it time.

  What's that? You don't know what Freebeeism is? OK, for those out 
  there that don't know, Freebeeism is a debilitating illness that 
  sends a person into convulsions whenever they have to pay for 
  anything Internet related. Essentially, deeply seeded anti-
  commercialization feelings towards the net -- everything on the 
  net should be free.

  Many feel that it's commercialization that will be the net's 
  ultimate demise. Commercialization isn't the problem though. 
  Irresponsibility is. Ask someone that you know, who is suffering 
  from Freebeeism, why they are so anti-commercialization. Chances 
  are pretty good that they'll tell you about the 20 or 30 email 
  advertisements that they received this week alone. There's one 
  important issue that they're missing though: look where those 
  emails came from. Are the majority from reputable organizations 
  and services? Or, are they from one of the many users out there 
  sending out ads to tens of thousands of people each week with 
  claims of riches and good fortune. 

  Does the following quote sound familiar?

  "Would you like to; EARN OVER $200,000 IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS"

  For many, quotes like this represent commercialization. They 
  don't though. They represent just a small portion of the scams 
  and spams waiting to fill your in basket each day. 

  Full commercialization of the net by LEGITIMATE businesses will 
  be one of the greatest things to happen to the net. For the 
  skeptics out there, feel free to drop me a line at 
  mailto:darchell@netcent.com.  If there's interest, I'll work up 
  an article on the topic for a future edition of NetNotify. 
  Besides, commercialization of the net can also mean more free 
  stuff, lots of free stuff! If you're still doubting me, don't 
  miss the Promotions section of this edition of NetNotify, where 
  you'll find details on NetPro's FREE software offer for DS Expert 
  (ya save $1,299 - even Henry would be happy!)

  In the mean time, if anyone would like to donate some food stamps 
  so my dear friend Henry can get through the coming days, I'm sure 
  he would appreciate them. ;-)

  Without further delay, let's get this show on the road!

 ==========
 What's New
 ==========

 The What's New section, kicking off with this edition, will 
 provide you with details regarding new services that we are 
 implementing, and changes that have been made since the previous 
 edition of NetNotify.

 1.Many of the popular mail readers (i.e. Pegasus and Eudora) are 
   capable of interpreting URL's, as provided. To capitalize on 
   this functionality, starting with Edition 7, full URL's will be 
   listed for all net resources, whenever possible. This added 
   feature allows subscribers to take advantage of "URL-enabled" 
   mail readers. For example, if you're using the latest version of 
   Pegasus, you will be able to click on 
   http://www.netcent.com/netnotify/ to access out web site. No 
   need to cut and paste the URL into your web browser.

 2.NetNotify now has a home on the web at 
   http://www.netcent.com/netnotify/. Currently, the site offers 
   detailed information about NetNotify, subscription services, 
   contact information, and links to download past editions. The 
   site also provides links to some of our friends: NetNotify 
   subscribers providing links to our web site. If you are 
   interested in participating in the "Friends of NetNotify" 
   service there is NO fee) send an email to 
   mailto:netnotify-marketing@netcent.com.

 3.Each edition of NetNotify will provide a link and a brief 
   description to one of the subscribers participating in the 
   "Friends of NetNotify" service.

 4.Product reviews have now been added to the listing of 
   NetNotify services.  Brief summary reviews will be included 
   within each edition of NetNotify, with a link to the full review 
   - available on the web.

 5.The number of people writing auxiliary material for NetNotify 
   has increased dramatically over the past few weeks. New members 
   to our family, Team NetCent, are working like fiends on new 
   product reviews, and soon to be released feature articles and 
   regular columns. Who are they? Pop over to 
   http://www.netcent.com/teamnetcent/ for bios (and mug shots) of 
   some of our most recent additions.

 6.Previously we announced an impending release of the NetNotify 
   Subscriber FAQ. Release of this document has been delayed 
   slightly due to the enhancements/additions that we've been 
   working on. The NetNotify Subscriber FAQ will answer many of the 
   most common questions that are sent in to us, along with a bunch 
   of other juicy tidbits.  We're hoping to have this out within 
   the next couple weeks.

 7.Our distribution day has moved from Monday to Wednesday. Given 
   the number of "lumps" that Doug has received over the past 2 
   years from working almost every weekend, its probably a wise 
   move.

 8.To present a more "international feel" to the publication, 
   starting with Edition 8, we will be doing our best to provide 
   overseas phone numbers within each bulletin.

 9.We are still in the process of trying to expand the number of 
   vendors/products covered in our Patches section.  A 'bot is in 
   progress, but there are a fair number of hurdles that we've had 
   to jump that popped up out of no where.  We do regret the delays 
   for new additions in this area, and hope to expand it within the 
   near future.

 IE3.0b2 and Novell Client 32 - Not Playing Nice
 -----------------------------------------------

  You're running Internet Explorer 3.0 beta 2 and Novell's Client 
  32. For some reason, the kids just aren't playing well together - 
  you can't get to any site but Microsoft's. If you switch to the 
  Microsoft Client for NetWare - presto, you can surf till your 
  hearts content. Is there something you can do to use IE3.0b2 with 
  Client32? Yup, there sure is.

  Fire up REGEDIT.EXE, and drill down as follows:

  Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, SOFTWARE, MICROSOFT, INTERNET EXPLORER, 
  MAIN. Select the DEFAULT SEARCH PAGE or DEFAULT SEARCH URL.

  Now ,remove the setting 
  http://home.microsoft.com/access/allinone.asp. (EDIT, MODIFY, 
  del). Reboot your PC and you'll find that you can surf the Web 
  again......

 Activation Keys Available for NetWare Upgrades
 ----------------------------------------------
 
  Continuing with their current pattern of simplifying support and 
  administration of NetWare servers, the Utah Crew have really 
  struck gold with their latest effort. Commencing August 5, Novell 
  will begin shipping activation key-enabled upgrade software - 
  thus begins the newest way to upgrade your NetWare servers. 
  Making it easy is what it's all about, and that's precisely what 
  activation keys do. Now, when you're looking to purchase an 
  upgrade for your NetWare servers, simply fill out and fax a short 
  form within the upgrade box to Novell's Activation Center. This 
  data will then be compiled and your special activation key (a 
  unique number assigned by Novell) will be returned to you by FAX. 
  Quick, simple and easy. For details on Novell's no-brainer 
  upgrades, check with your local authorized reseller, or Novell's
