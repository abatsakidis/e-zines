 The Great Email Flood

  When you think "Flood", the first thing that usually pops into your 
  mind is water, lots of water.  We used to think the same thing, 
  until recently.  Within our last edition of NetNotify, we told you 
  about our friends from Venus. You know, the gents that assumed 
  networking pro's like you had all the time in the world to "surf 
  the web" for update information. To say that we received a lot of 
  email in response to that editorial would be an understatement. 
  Within the first week, thousands of responses came in from 
  subscribers around the world! Although we couldn't respond to 
  everyone directly, we would just like to thank everyone that took 
  the time to throw their two cents into the ring! 
  
  Before jumping right into the action, we've got some great news for 
  our notified ones! Starting this month, NetNotify will be bringing 
  even more great information, right to the desktop. Working in 
  conjunction with the new backend service that we hinted at in 
  earlier editions, NetNotify will start delivering product reviews 
  and networking related articles! Will NetNotify turn into some 
  monstrous e-zine? Definitely not. The goal for NetNotify has been, 
  and always will be, to deliver information to our subscribers, in a 
  brief, bulletin style format.  Are you wondering how we'll do it? 
  Well wonder no more!

  Our new backend service is a collaboration of our existing document 
  retrieval service, the NetNotify newsletter, and a new web site. 
  These three services all fit together into a much larger service 
  that we've named Networking Central. The goal of Networking Central 
  is rather simple - to provide a single source of information for 
  networking pro's.  It will take some time to get there, but we're 
  confident that we CAN get there.

  If you're thinking "Oh great, now we need to jump to the web," 
  don't worry, you won't have to.  Here's how it all fits together.  
  NetNotify will continue providing patch and news related 
  information, as we always have. The document retrieval service, and 
  the web site, will be used to provide links to resources, and more 
  in-depth information.  As an example, brief summaries of each product 
  review will appear within NetNotify. These summaries will give you an
  overall "feel" for the product and what we thought of it.  Should 
  you be interested in reading the full product review, you can pop 
  over to our web site, or request the review through the document 
  retrieval service. When it comes to networking related articles, 
  again, only brief summaries will appear within NetNotify. Should 
  the article be of interest to you, our web site will provide the 
  full text.

  To let you know which products have been scheduled for review, a 
  new section has been added to NetNotify, appearing at the end of 
  the newsletter. "Reviewer's Corner" lists the software, hardware 
  and books that are already in the hands of our reviewers.  There 
  are many other products that we plan to review, but we will not 
  announce any upcoming reviews until the product is in our hands.

  The Networking Central service will deliver much more than just 
  product reviews and articles. But we can't give away all our 
  secrets just yet, now can we? Watch the wires for important URL's!

  Before releasing you into the jungle of Patches, Promo's and News, 
  we have one last issue to address; subscriptions.  

  We want to ensure that as many people as possible can benefit from 
  NetNotify. To do that, we are interested in locating 'net pro's willing 
  to provide links on their web pages to our subscription services. 
  If you would be interested in providing a link, please drop us a 
  line at netnotify-marketing@netcent.com. In exchange for the link, 
  we will provide a link to your own home pages within a special 
  area of Networking Central.

  All the best....now, on with the show!

  P.S. An FAQ about NetNotify and the Networking Central service will 
  be available within the next two weeks. This document will answer 
  the majority of questions that we have received to date. Once 
  available, a special announcement will be made.
