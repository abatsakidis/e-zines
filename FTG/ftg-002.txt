  -+- introduction -+-

        it's only been two days since the release of issue one, and many will
  probably go by before the next issue is released.  i think everything said
  here will still be relevent, so ah well.  i've recieved two compliments on
  issue one, so i'm happy.
        yesterday i bought the new white zombie album.  it's not because  
  i like white zombie, it's because my parents don't.  this is the first
  time i've ever stooped that low, but i felt it was kind of necessary.  i
  feel like distancing myself from them.  you'll hear more about this later
  in the zine.
        putting together this zine is fun to me.  as long as i'm enjoying
  it this much, i think i'll continue for awhile.  fuck everyone else.

  -+- contents -+-

        i don't know why the fuck i bother having a "contents" section.  the
  headers for all the articles are pretty misleading, but oh well.  i guess
  i put it in here to take up space.

                {!}  issue two contents  {!}
           
                  one - "more human than human"
                  two - "bitch and moan"
                three - "this is your life"
                 four - "movie reviews but ends up in shambles."

        all of this bullshit was written by Easily Fooled aka your penis.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  -+- more human than human -+-

        as i said earlier, yesterday i bought the white zombie album called
  "astro-creep: 2000 -- songs of love, destruction, and other synthetic
  delusions of the electric head".  just typing out that title insults my
  intelligence, but that's not my point.  i don't really even like white
  zombie, but i bought it anyway.  
        i couldn't figure out why i picked it up off the store rack and
  put it into my basket along with an old breeders album and pavement single.
  after a bit of thought, i kind of realized that i had bought it to 
  "distance" myself from my parents.  that's a pretty crazy reason to buy an
  album, but i'm sure many before me have done it.
        look at it this way, my parents liked Nirvana when I was deeply into
  them (they're the first "real" band that i fell in love with), my parents
  can stand my Pavement records, and my dad actually was humming the tune
  "connection" by elastica the other day.  if my parents actually treated me
  like a human (MORE HUMAN THAN HUMAN - oh sorry), i wouldn't mind this.
        
        here's a list of things i've been yelled at for this week:

        1.  not watering my mom's garden.  she ALWAYS does it, but this week
            she forgot, so she blamed it on me.

        2.  not studying enough (i study damn two hours a day, remember this
            is the summer, but my dad wants me to study four).

        3.  for not having my license yet.  (for the record--i am only 15
            and not eligable for a driver's license yet.  i *DO* have my
            permit, however.  i think my mom just wanted to yell.)

        4.  for being on the phone with my cousin (he called me) as an
            employer tried to reach him with a job offer (he's 24, out of
            college, no work).  goddamn them for not having god's gift
            to phones, call waiting.

        the list could go on and on, but i'm not here to bitch about my
  parents.  i'm here to explain why i would try to distance myself with music.
  anyway, so you get the point that i'm fed up with my parents.  if you want
  to become my best friend, listen to the same music i do.  so i figured i'd
  try to get into something which i know they couldn't get into.
        sound crazy?  try it.  it works.  too bad white zombie's music really
  bites.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  -+- bitch and moan -+- 

        flipping through the channels on my idiot's box, i came across
  something that just blew my mind.  'twas on CNN.. they were reporting
  that an elderly woman had sued mcdonalds for two million dollars because
  she spilt coffee on herself and it burned her.  the big thing that came
  to mind was,"isn't that one of the risks of coffee?  it'll burn you if
  you spill it on yourself?"
        anyway, i figured the lawsuit would be laughed out of court so i
  just chuckled to myself.  a couple of weeks later i saw that she had won
  the case.  mcdonalds appealed and the amount was lowered from 2 million
  to 600 thousand.  mcdonalds was somewhat satisfied by that and rested.
        personally, i think it's crazy.  "come on kids, let's go spill coffee
  on ourselves and sue mcdonalds!"  jesus christ.  in japan, lawsuits are
  considered "evil", people who are involved (those that file the lawsuit)
  are brought into shame.  why isn't america like that?
        alright, so the mcdonalds lawsuit was an outrage.  i thought perhaps
  it was a freak thing.  then i found out that survivors of the oklahoma city
  bombing had hired johnny cocarain (i know the spelling is off) of the "oj
  dream team" to sue the company that produced the fertilizer used in the bomb
  blast.  the fertilizer?!?  why not just go after mcveigh?  it's he who
  used the fertilizer in a different way than it was intended.  
        for instance, say i was shot in the leg by a hunter.  if i had the
  same mentality (sue whoever has the most money) i would sue the company 
  that made the gun.  the gun was made to shoot animals (at least i would 
  hope so), not people (in actuality, a gun maker IS being sued for this 
  exact thing).
        what's my point?  how can we allow crazy lawsuits like this to burden
  our judges and prosecutors, who get paid from our pockets?  prison inmates
  are allowed to sue anyone/anything at any time they want to.  i've heard of
  prisoners sueing the state because they were given crunchy peanut butter
  instead of creamy.  i've also heard that each year, the amount of money
  that inmates run-up by making these lawsuits is in the millions.
        it's no wonder the judicial system has allowed O.J. Simpson a trial
  that has lasted this long.

  -+- this is your life... -+-

        here are some journal entries i did last year for my english teacher.
  (note: i recieved an A, and it was an honors class.  so you can see how
  bad our schools are).  the teacher told us what to write about, so note
  that i didn't voluntarily write about any of this stuff.
  
  blast-from-the-past-border=================================================

        ( 9/06/94 - fights )

        'when fights break out at school, i usually stick around to see two
  macho, testosterone pumped guys punch each other to accomplish a short
  break from school (up to ten days long, i believe).  they are soft of
  fun to watch though... i enjoy seeing my peers kill each other.  it means
  i won't have to.'

        
        ( 10/11/94 - angst poem )

        (note:  this is from my days when i was 'oh so angry' at the world.
                it's angst at its worst)

        [socially drained]

        it's the end of all i grasp
        it's the end of all i lack
        crystal clear and dark red
        the wound spills life; i get bored and go to bed

        fear now what is unknown
        for the unknow is the land to roam
        i don't fear anything
        because nothing can make me feel worse than i already do

        miserable, chained, ugly servant
        servant to society's separate god
        think like the majority
        or be killed as the minority

        creativity is something that died
        died along with an open-mind
        everybody plays as a puppet
        and those that don't...
        do not survive the discontent in their heads.

        
        ( 9/21/94 - rainy days)

        'the hardest thing about high school so far would be getting through
  the day.  high school is sort of like a disease.  when i walk into the 
  building, i catch the virus and my immune system battles it until i walk out
  of those doors at the end of the day  (my theory is that the virus jumps off
  of me as i walk out and waits for my return the following day).
        school seems like a big prison to me.  each year, out of seven 
  periods, i usually only have about two that i actually learn anything in, and
  i could learn what i learn in those in about four months (30 minutes a day).
  something that really bugs me is the lack of bathroom time.  my bladder
  is about to explode by lunch (the only time i have to go to the bathroom).
  it makes me really irritable (when i have a full bladder, that is).'

blast-from-the-past-border===================================================
        
        whew!  i never realized how much that stuff sucked until i typed it
  out.  well now you know something personal about me.  i used to be an angst
  junkie.  thankfully, i'm recovering now.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  -+- movie reviews ends up in shambles (rambles) -+-
        
        in a time of bad movies, i must bring two to attention which make
  me shiver every time i watch them--"pump up the volume" and "heathers".
  both star christian slater as an angst-ridden teenager who is a bit fed
  up with all of the bullshit we're forced to endure.
        "heathers" is supposed to be a comedy, but for some reason i take
  it seriously.  it's basically about killing off all the jock/popular   
  kids at school because christian is fed up with their bullshit.  it
  presents this in a pretty funny way.  "heathers" is a must rent (though
  i'm sure you've already seen it--it's required material if you've ever
  wanted to be an angst junkie).
        "pump up the volume" is more of a realistic movie where christian
  slater plays the dj of his own little pirate radio station.  he transmits
  it off of a radio that his dad bought him when they moved (his father
  thought he could contact his old friends with it).  anyway, people
  actually listen to the radio station and one kid commits suicide while
  listening to it.  the FCC track him down after the suicide.
        i can relate to "pump up the volume" because of an event in my
  life in which the FCC wanted me to go to the supreme court building of
  our state.  they had gotten reports of my bulletin board service having
  massive amounts of profanity and/or being a source of dangerous information
  (ie. explosive making, pirating, etc).  
        it's sad that the government would waste its time battling me
  when there are rapists, murderers, etc, roaming the streets.  needless
  to say, they dropped the case because of lack of information.  ah well.
  my parents still grounded the hell out of me.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  -+- the end -+-

        this is the end, my only friend, the end.  anyway fuck that mojo 
  risen bullshit.  none of that is important because i'm still looking for
  writers.  i know this issue was worse than the last, but hey - this one
  is bigger.  we want quantity, not quality.  wait, maybe i said that wrong.

        if you want to write for the zine, you can reach me at the following
  places:
