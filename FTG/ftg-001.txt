 -+-  fight^this^generation  -+- by Easily Fooled

        "fight this generation" is a pretty unoriginal name for a zine,
  considering I ripped it from a Pavement song.  The song is kind of a
  sarcastic, slacker if you will, attack on my generation.  Here's what
  Stephen Malkmus (the guy who wrote the song) says about it:

        "This was a song to be played at a mythic awards ceremony.  The
  singer/emcee asks people to come on up and accept their prizes but it
  becomes apparent there is no reason to award anyone.  The ceremony becomes
  a sort of self-examination but the audience is too weak to raise their 
  voices until a snake charmer takes the stage and gets a pathetic rage 
  going.  People mumble along but no one gets very excited so "the song" 
  ignores the audience and goes where it wants until a PUMA escapes from 
  a cage and mauls the singer/emcee.  The song ends without fanfare."

        Take it as you will.  this zine is dedicated to all the boring kids
  who sit around on their computer all day.  Masturbation is not the issue
  at hand.  Pardon the pun.

        "don't tell your parents, they might take it away"

        i think i'm only going to include three articles in here.  i 
  just want to see what people think.  if too many people think this sucks,
  or i don't get any feedback about it, i guess i'll quit.

        1. sub-conscious trend setter  
        2. oh the horror
        3. purpose
        4. do get in touch, love.  (note the period - it signifies the end)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(note--before i go on, i should attack the issue of my grammar.  it isn't
       very good, i admit, but i think it's readible.  my spelling is
       terrible as well, but i think you can understand me.  if you can't,
       tell me.)

  -+-  sub-conscious trend setter -+- by Easily Fooled

        the tale i'm going to tell you may be something you can relate to.
  then again, maybe you won't be able to.  i don't care.  this just proves
  that no one will dance with me in this zany town.  whoops.  too many
  pavement references already.
        i live in a small town down south.  smithfield, north carolina to
  be exact.  if you've ever seen anything written by me, i always tell you
  where i live.  to me, smithfield is equal to hell.  that's probably
  why i'm not afraid of hell, because nothing could get any worse than this.
        now that you know where i live, you should know another thing.  i
  haven't met anyone who has lived here more than five years and retained
  any intelligence (note:  NC competes against SC for worst schooling in
  the USA).
        i attended a private school until my seventh grade year, upon which
  my parents doomed me to a life of public schools.  actually, i didn't give
  a shit.  the only drawback (in my eyes) was that i didn't know anyone in
  smithfield.  i had always just hung out on my keyboard and with my buddies
  at the private school.
        anyway, this is getting too long and i haven't even started the story
  yet.  one day in english class, the teacher told us we had a biography
  "project" due in one week.  i was deeply into nirvana around that time so
  i decided to do my project on kurt cobain.  i wrote up a page or two about
  his life, his wife, etc. and found a video cassette with nirvana's mtv
  awards performance (lithium).
        the time came to present the projects to the class.  i think 50% of
  the class did whitney houston and the other 99% did their favorite country
  singers or tv actors.  when i went up to read, i saw bewildered faces 
  looking back at me.  "my mistake!" i thought to myself.  no one had even
  heard of nirvana.
        i finished reading my paper and pressed play on the VCR.  the girls
  were like,"aww he's cute" when kurt was just standing there.  when he
  started playing his guitar they changed their minds to,"he's a punk!".
  anything that didn't look like them was a punk.
        after about a minute of the song, people started throwing shit at me.
  at first it was just a paperball or two, but it soon errupted into erasers,
  pencils, etc.  the class started booing...
        now we'll time travel in thought to my freshman year of high school.
  kurt cobain had killed himself during my eighth, and i think that sparked
  interest with all my peers.  soon everyone was wearing the "never fade
  away" exploitation t-shirts.  that year, the same jock shitheads who had
  thrown shit and booed the hell out of it during my seventh grade year
  were going around singing the lyrics to "lithium".
        i don't really listen to nirvana anymore, i think it has to do with
  his death or something--i haven't really examined that issue yet.  my
  point is... figure it out yourself.

  -+-  oh the horror -+- by Easily Fooled

        i want you here as a witness.  free your mind, and the rest will
  follow, right?  bullshit.  i want you to realize it's all bullshit.  people
  don't give a fuck what you say, they only care what the majority says.  and
  you are definately not the majority.  only a select group of people have
  the power to order everyone else around.
        you want an example of these "special" people who have this power
  over everyone?  if you attend high school, try to envision the most popular
  girl and boy.  now remember, these people you envision don't express
  individuality, they want everyone to be just like them.  and hell!  every-
  one ends up being just like them...EXCEPT YOU!  right?  is that how you
  feel?
        don't feel.  it hurts too much.  don't have children.  they'll hurt
  too much - exspecially if you're male.  fuck you feminists.  i put that
  there on purpose.
        it's been a shitty day.  excuse me.

  -+- purpose -+- by Easily Fooled

        do underground zines actually make a difference?  have they ever 
  affected you outside of the computer world?  my answer--yes.  i'll use
  pEz as an example.  i hadn't written anything for over two years before
  i picked up pEz_023.zip.  after reading its contents, i started writing
  again.  i don't think i've written anything half as good as bF's stuff,
  but "practice makes perfect".
       i feel like a well written underground zine is 10x better than SPIN,
  ROLLING STONE, or whatever other big corporate magazines.  i hate wading
  through 20 GAP jeans ads to find something written, but written with
  apprehension because it may "hurt" someone.  with underground zines, you
  get to read genuine/heartfelt thoughts, ideas, and emotions.  
        i know my style of writing may be hard to read, but i feel like
  i'm actually saying something, perhaps making a difference with this.
  maybe this piece of shit will inspire somebody to do something better...

        oh well.  am i too down on myself?  of course not.

        thanks for reading this far.  in order for this thing to grow and
  make a difference we would like to see more people become involved in
  the content of the zine.  if you're interested in becoming part of the
  "staff" or just contributing something every once in awhile, please
  contact me.  i would exspecially like to find a female writer to express a 
  totally different perspective of things.  whether you're female or not,
  you can contact me at the following i-net address:  
                                
                                disgust@vnet.net.
                
                i also frequent #zines on IRC as "peter_pan".

             greetz:  nobody (wouldn't want to embaress anyone).
