                               Party Hats
                            8 February, 1997

        Pull out those dusty party hats and join me for the celebration!
        Oh, you'd rather not?  Well, that's alright, I suppose I can eat
this cake by myself.  What a lonely birthday for a young magazine!
        Today marks a year since I first sat down in a moment of mania,
pulled half of my hair out by the roots, and turned out a collection of
words that oddly enough resembled a magazine.  I named this collection
Cranberry Winters, and have maintained enough enthusiasm over the course
of a year to follow that first issue with six, now seven, issues more.
        I hope you enjoy this special issue of Cranberry Winters as much
as I will enjoy falling asleep later this evening...

			    The Drifter
		                1994
		
The Drifter had been exiled long ago to this desert, thousands of miles of 
unoccupied stretches of sand and merciless heat, after the murder of its 
child, vulnerable as only child Drifters are.

No longer could it remember the reason for it's exile; only memories of 
endless miles walked, day in and day out, occupied, filled its mind.  
Memories of falling and rising, once again to wander overran its tormented 
mind.  Memories of a desire to die.  Death could be nothing more than a wish,
the curse of the already mature Drifter being immortality.  The sun, the only 
sustenance a Drifter would ever need, had become its enemy.  "Were the sun 
to leave the sky, this Drifter in peace would happily die."  The Drifter had
forgotten, even, the rhyming tales that Drifters were so fond of.

There is no reality left save for the sun and the sky, the endless stretches 
of gently blowing sands.  Where once it had fought such a bleak eternity, all 
it could do was resign itself to wandering these endless sands, physical and 
mental agony its only companions.

Forever.


				Fire and Ice
			     25 Septembre, 1995

There is fire in her heart
burning out at times...
Until someone thinks to light it again,
placing with purpose eah twig and limb,
or carelessly tosses their lives' journals in
Till the fire burns hungrily, ceaselessly.

And there is ice in her heart,
winter ravages her emotions,
 memories
She wanders the frozen remnants,
touching slowly, closing her eyes, 
backing away at times
from things too hard to bear
        The snow crunches under her red, cold toes
        She wraps her arms over her breasts,
        shivering, stepping wearily 
         over broken dreams

There - a small light
she pulls one arm from her breast
Reaching for a light
That perhaps doesn't exist

It is beyond her reach,
  this fragile light
Now she stretches out both arms
Reaching with all the energy she can muster

The light blinks,
fades away,
and she curls up in the hardened snow,
her tears steaming, sliding
  over the glittering white dust
        that spans an eternity


  ...silence...

then
 the soft patter of feet on melting snow
   as of faerie's wings fluttering by earside

   a gentle hand
     on her frozen body

now, warmth, 
 as the stranger wraps his body around her,
 his face on her back

he brings life to the near-dead
  and she rises - 
  not healed,
but able at least to walk on the soft grass

and to share the bitter days
of the past

and someday to leave them there,
in the past


        
			Changing Seasons
                        31 Octobre, 1995

In the winter, the snow feel around her feet, landed gently on her face.
        It was beautiful, but she could not feel its coolness.
In the spring, the flowers bloomed in shades of purple, pink, red and yellow.
        It was beautiful, but she thought only of their short lives,
                and of how quickly they would wilt into ugliness.
In the summer, the sun lit up the countryside.
        It was beautiful, but she could see the clouds on the horison.
In the autumn, the falling leaves brushed against her pale skin
        and the wind played its gentle perpetual music against the trees.
    It was beautiful, but she was blind.


				Fini
			 14 Novembre, 1995

The woman waits patiently by the fountain, watching person after person parade
in front of her.

Soon a man comes to sit with her, silently watching the people playing and 
laughing and laughing with one another.

"Waiting for the end of the world, eh?"

The nameless woman turns to him, watches him for only a moment with her 
bitterly intense eyes.  She nods at him, then turns away and resumes her
people-watching.

"If you don't mind, I think I'll join you."


				Japan
			    16 July, 1996

Beep:  "Last time I called, you were in Japan, which I took to mean that
        you were eating a carrot and reading a mystery in front of a TV
        you leave on only for effect.  Was I right?  Give me a call."

        Erin replayed the message and tried to recognise the voice, to no
avail.  Her carrot and mystery novel lay forgotten on the couch, an old
Laurel and Hardy episode playing out on the television.
        Who was this man?  She had never been to Japan nor had she ever 
made plans to go.  To her knowledge, she had never met him.
        Erin decided to record a new message then and there.  Her simple,
"Please leave a message," did not appear to be doing the trick.  
        Still, it was bizarre how he had guessed about the carrot, the
novel and the television.

                                =+=

        In the meanwhile, Dr Alvin Simmons wondered what he was going to
do about his patient's bizarre problem with conversing on the telephone
in his sleep.


			the other side
			19 July,  1996

i see
the other side
of the pond
through the rippling water

i see
myself 
sitting on 
the other side
of the pond

myself does not see me
it does not want to see me

there is no reason to see me
i am as i should be

the world is as it should be

children play 
parents need not watch
for they are safe
women walk safe
the only gangs
are those
guys
sitting on the porch
seeing who can
spit
                the farthest

myself ignores me

it does not wonder 
about the way things could be


				Woman
			    18 June, 1996

        old woman
     looks out a window

     thinks she sees
       her husband
   (he's dead, though)

        photographs lay in her lap
     forgotten in favour of memories
      she no longer knows as memories


				To Climb
			    2 Novembre, 1996

                                i stand
                        at the edge of a great cliff
                                  wind
                           stinging my eyes
                         as it tries to escape me

                                my life
                            lays below me
                              spread across a vast terrain

                                  from here
                                     the view is not clear;
                              straining my eyes
                                  blurs the view further

                                  i must forget

                                  i turn 
                               to the mountain of the future
                                 and begin to climb
                                           to climb
                                           to climb


				Old Man
			   8 Novembre,  1996

his body, once so
beautiful, is hunched
and gnarled, his skin
yellow and wrinkled

he used to play football

his house is empty
of visitors but his
heart is full,
overflowing...
  ...with pain

fine young men laugh
at the prune on the
porch as they playfully
jostle one another

he did the same thing

he closes his eyes
he can't take it back


				Turning
			   21 Novembre, 1996

   i wandered a path
  free of obstructions

   i turned back
     in horror

   returned to the familiarity
     of agony


				Guilty
			    17 July,  1996

        in my world
     people feel hopeless
          something wrong
           but what?
       there seems 
          no hope for change
     we are set in our ways


        in my world
     a woman is raped
         and her lifestyle 
            is questioned,
             each indiscretion,
          each mistake she has ever made
               displayed for a jury

        in my world
     a rapist is set free
          because we must be fair to him
              he is innocent
            until proven guilty

                        she
              was guilty from the beginning


			       Whispers
                            11 June,  1995

Whisper.  Whisper.  Silence.

The wind is indecisive now, stopping for a moment and then starting again.
Maybe it's chasing after something, something that hides and confuses the 
wind.  It has to stop and think.

The people sit on the porch in silence, lined all in a row, waiting.  They 
are holding hands.

Vivid colours nowl all sorts of colours.   Orange.  Yellow.  Red.  Unnamed
colours.  The porch and its people are scattered all over now, at peace, by 
something so much stronger, so much more decisive, than any wind that could
ever exist.


			 Winter Rose
			25 June, 1996

                        I yearn to be
                     A rose in the winter
                        Red as blood
                    Against blinding white 
                          Distinct
                       The lone ruby
                     In a sea of diamonds

                        My tenacity
                      would be admired
                        My strength
                    adored and wondered at

                         The beauty
                      of all roses past
                        forgotten

                      My beauty alone
                        held in awe
                 Because I am all there is
                         to behold
