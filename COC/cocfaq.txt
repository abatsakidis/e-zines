                        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

WHO IS GINO FILICETTI?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Gino Filicetti is an 19 year old student and is one of  the  founding
members of Chronicles of Chaos, along with Adrian Bromley,  they  got
the idea of putting together an ezine for all  kinds  of  metal  fans
worldwide. Previously, Gino had another Internet ezine  called:  Loud
Lyrix, a forum for Internet  users  to  share  the  lyrics  of  their
favorite heavy metal songs. It lasted  from  March  to  September  of
1994. Gino has been a fan of metal his whole life with  his  earliest
memories being those of his brother blasting  KISS  records  all  the
time. Since then he's grown to enjoy heavier and more  extreme  types
of music. Gino is currently in high school for another semester,  and
plans on entering Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto.

WHO IS ADRIAN BROMLEY?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Adrian Bromley  is  a  24  year  old  freelance  writer  for  several
publications in and around Toronto and  throughout  Canada.  He  does
light freelance work for art magazines VENUE  and  MENZ,  contributes
work to RHiG Magazine  (indie  alt/rock)  and  is  one  of  the  main
contributors to the world  reknown  M.E.A.T  Magazine  and  it's  new
predecessor Alternative Rock Monthly (A*R*M). His  musical  interests
range from alternative to death metal. His work for CoC has  been  as
coordinator of the magazine (arranging interviews, product and record
label contact) and along with Gino Filicetti, has done  some  serious
time ruining his ear drums with loud  aggressive  death,  thrash  and
black metal while passionately promoting the mag. His work within the
metal community  has  been  strong  and  continues  to  aid  CoC  and
contribute countless record reviews as well as key  interviews.  Some
interviews have been with such notable heavyweights as Fear  Factory,
My Dying Bride, Bathory, Type O Negative,  Cathedral,  Napalm  Death,
Neurosis, Cemetary, Megadeth, Marilyn  Manson,  Nailbomb,  Sepultura,
Paradise Lost, Exit-13, Mortification, Mindrot and the list goes  on.
His prime goal with Chronicles of Chaos is to once again  bring  back
the need for metal in today's music.

WHO IS ALAIN M. GAUDRAULT?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Alain M. Gaudrault is a longtime metal fan disgusted with the lack of
media coverage given to extreme forms  of  music.  Impressed  by  the
content quality of the first issue of Chronicles of  Chaos,  he  knew
the editors could use an eagle eye  to  clean  up  errors,  and  even
submit the  occasional  review.  While  typically  preferring  speed,
death, and black metal, Alain's musical heros are Black  Sabbath  and
Alice Cooper, two highly influential acts who helped ring in the  age
of extremism in music back in the early 1970s. In his late  twenties,
Alain has  completed  a  Master's  degree  in  Computer  Science,  is
co-founder of an  educational  software  company,  and  is  currently
working  as  a  software  developer,  creating  software  tools   for
programmers.

WHO IS BRIAN MELOON?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Brian Meloon is a contributing writer for Chronicles of  Chaos,  with
just enough spare time on his hands to add a few reviews each  issue.
Brian recently moved to Ithaca, NY (otherwise known as the middle  of
nowhere) in August, 1994 after being born and raised in Madison,  WI.
Currently, he attends  Cornell  University,  studying  (appropriately
enough) chaotic dynamical systems. Brian's favorite kind of music  is
technical metal of all types.
                   
WHAT IS THE FORMAT OF THE ZINE?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chronicles of Chaos is  electronically  distributed  monthly  through
internet email. Most issues exceed 80k so they are delivered  in  two
parts since many of our subscribers mailboxes can not handle  such  a
huge load of information in one message. Chronicles of Chaos consists
of eight basic parts, an editorial, "Loud Letters," a 'letters to the
editor' type section. "Ferocious  Features,"  a  section  of  feature
stories with signed acts,  "Chaotic  Chat  Sessions,"  a  section  of
question  and   answer   interviews   with   signed   acts.   "Record
Revelations,"   record   reviews   of   signed   acts.   "Independent
Interrogations," a section of  stories  on  independent  bands.  "New
Noise," a demo review section. "Chaotic Concerts," a  concert  review
section. "Tours of Torture," a tour listing section and "What We Have
Cranked," a top five list of this month's favorite records  from  the
staff.

HOW CAN I HELP OUT WITH CHRONICLES OF CHAOS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
We are always happy to hear from our  subscribers,  any  comments  or
questions you have will be read and answered and printed in the "Loud
Letters" section of the following issue. Reader submissions are  also
welcome, what we really need is reports on  local  scenes...  if  you
live in a remote part of the world, we want to hear about your  metal
scene. Another thing you can do is ADVERTISE! Our goal is to reach as
many people in  the  world  as  possible,  so  every  little  bit  of
advertising helps, just spread the word around to ALL newsgroups  and
mailing lists. All help is greatly appreciated.

DO YOU REALLY REVIEW ALL DEMOS SENT TO YOU?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At this point in time we do review ALL demos sent to us,  but  we  do
not have the money to snail mail out a copy of the issue to any  band
that doesn't have Internet access. This is  an  unfortunate  reality,
but Chronicles of Chaos is an EZINE, so its natural  habitat  is  the
Internet. However, we greatly appreciate all demos sent to us, and we
always try and review them all, but I can not see  into  the  future,
and if we start to receive  unreal  amounts  of  demos,  it  will  be
physically impossible to review them all, but we will always try  our
best.

HOW DO I LEAVE CHRONICLES OF CHAOS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You may leave Chronicles of Chaos at any time by  sending  a  message
with "UNSUBSCRIBE coc-ezine" in the BODY of your message to the  list
handler at listproc@lists.colorado.edu. Please note that this command
must NOT be sent to the list address  <coc-ezine@lists.colorado.edu>,
but to the mail server which handles this mailing list.

HOW DO I REPORT A TECHNICAL PROBLEM?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Reports of any and all problems should be mailed  to  Gino  Filicetti
at ginof@io.org... we greatly appreciate any help you  can  give
us

CHRONICLES OF CHAOS IS TOO BIG FOR MY MAILBOX!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chronicles of Chaos is already being split into two or three parts to
make it easier on our subscriber's mailboxes, but if at any time  any
part of Chronicles of Chaos gets too big that it will  not  fit  your
mail quota, mail us immediately and inform us of the problem, we will
split the issue for you into smaller pieces, and make a note for  all
subsequent issues.

THIS FAQ WILL BE AMENDED AND POSTED AS REQUIRED.
