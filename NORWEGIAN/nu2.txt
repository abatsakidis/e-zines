Homemade Pepper Spray:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pepper spray may be good for getting away if being chased after
doing some shit.
Here's a couple of recipes on how to make pepper spray at home.
1. Get some marinated jalapeno pepper. Pour the marinated juice into
   a spray bottle.
2. Have bleach in a spray bottle.
3. Use a spray can of oven cleaner.
4. Beat up a cop and take his pepper spray.


How To Get Into Theme Parks:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Shit, why pay lots of cash just to get into a freaking theme park,
when you might as well get in for free.
Here's a some ways to get into a theme park for Free.

The Easiest Way:
Find a part of the fence which is easy to jump.
Jump over or cut it to get past it.

The Medium Way:
Pretend you are retarded, frequently clap your hands, and ask
bypassing people and the people that work in the gates stupid
questions. Tell one of the workers that you are to meet your
mother on the inside(a place you know exist in the park).
If they tell you that you cannot go in, start to cry and keep
saying that you mother told you to meet you on the inside.
After a while someone will, hopefully, take you to the place.
The person that took you there will probably wait with you a while,
but will in most cases leave you alone after a while, to come back
later to check if you are still there. When the worker leave,
simply disappear in the crowd.

The Hard Way:
Put on a suit, and get a briefcase.
Look like you are stressed and walk up to the workers in the gate
and tell them you are going to meet the manager(or some other
important person). They'll probably take you to him(hopefully inside
the park, depends on who you asked for). Walk up to the person you
asked for and start talking. The worker that took you to him will
walk away because he thinks you really had set up a meeting with
the dude.


How To Make A Smokey Box:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ok, you might figured what a Smokey Box is for, if not, I can tell
you that it is for smoking stuff with.
You will need:
*A round, 12 cm tall tin can.
*The tin can lid.
*Something for making holes in metal with.
*A small plastic pipe.

First make a hole in the bottom or on the side almost at the bottom
of the tin can. Then make a hole in the side, about half way up, on
the tin can. Put the plastic pipe in the hole on the side.

Figure:
Tin Can Bottom         Tin Can Side
   ---------           ___________
  /         \          |         |
|           |         |         |
| O         |         |    O    |
|           |         |         |
  \         /          |         |
   ---------           |_________|

              O = hole

Now light up some some shit, put it in the tin can and put on the lid.
Then smoke through the plastic pipe.
You can also have toothpaste around the hole on the inside to get
and extra kick out of it.


How To Get A Fake ID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Not old enough to buy booze? Well here's the way to change that for
you kids.

First you take a birth certificate(doesn't matter who's), use a
scanner and scan it onto the computer. Identifying what font
they use shouldn't be too hard, now that you have found the
font-type they use, simply remove the part which contains the
birth number, the name and your birthday.
Now use a graphical edit program(PSP or something) and enter your
new name, birth number and birthday. Then print it out on a GOOD
printer. You have a ID which is accepted by most people, but why not
have it even better.
The next thing you do is to go to a bank or any other
service which provide ID cards. Tell them something like that you
need  an ID card because people won't believe that you are as old
as you are and stuff like that(just make a believeable story, ok?).
They'll take a copy of your birth certificate and take a picture(if
you wan't to save time you might consider to take a picture in
advance). Then come back in a couple of days to pick up your ID
(don't have it sent to your house, it's too risky.) Now that you have
your new ID,  walk with a normal speed out of the bank, house etc.
Then when you get out, walk away from the entrance, and then, get
the hell out of there as fast as you possibly can.


Scaring The Shit Out Of People #2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Okay, issue one had some recipes on how to make som shitty stuff to
use on people.
Here's some other ways to scare people.

THE SHOOTER
What you need is a fire cracker and a laser pointer.
Go to someones house, ring their doorbell, then run and hide.
When they come out, light the firecracker and use the laser
pointer on them, but make sure they see the laser point on them,
now see what they do when the firecracker go off.

TOXIC WASTE
Take one of those tubes of glow in the dark stuff and pour the
stuff on whatever you want to throw and when it gets on the victim,
they think it's some deadly chemical or a radioactive substance so
they run in total panic. This works especially well with flower bombs
since a gummy, glowing substance gets all over the victim.

THE SCARY ANTHRAX
Take a wet paper towel and pour a given amount of baking flour in
the center. Then wrap it up and put on a rubber band to keep it
together. When thrown it will fly well but when it hits, it covers
the victim with the flower or causes a big puff of flour which will
put the victim in terror since as far as they are concerned, some
strange white powder is all over them. This is a cheap method of
terror and for only the cost of a roll of paper towels and a bag of
flour you and your friends can have loads of fun watching people
flee in panic.


Shoplifting And Not Getting Caught In The Sensor:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Okay, shoplifting is Easy, just stuff the shit in you bag, backpack,
whatever, but getting out is harder, those sensors at the entrance
sets of and an alarm if the stuff you are lifting haven't got the
"chip" disabled. There are many ways to get through this sensor, and
here's three of them

The Most Risky Way
When no one is at the counter, put your merchandise on the counter,
then take it off, the counter has a machine that disables the "chip".
Stuff it back in your bag and walk out.

The First Less Risk Way
Get yourself one of those machines that disables the "chip" and
make it portable if you have to, take it to the shop, get some
stuff you like, use your machine on it and put it in your
bag, then walk out of the shop, and the alarm won't go off.

The Second Less Risk Way
Get yourself a lead bag, or a bag with lead-walls on the inside(
easy to make) put the stuff you want to lift in the bag and
walk out, the sensors at the entrance can't "see" through the
lead shielding, something that makes it think there is nothing
there.


How To Make Fake Drugs & Drinks:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You might be saying, "What The Hell Do I Need Fake Drugs For?".
And the answer is, "To Sell To Local Junkies And Shit Like That".
You might even make some good money on selling fake drugs.

THE NUTTY MARIJUANA
Yup, this is how to make marijuana from nuts.
Take a bunch of nuts, crack them open and put them in boiling
water for a while so that the peelings come off.
Eat the nuts and save the peelings. Dry them.
Get a piece of white paper. Wrinkle it real good, then lay the
peelings on it and roll it together. Now you got yourself a
little fake joint. Sell this shit to some lameass and he
won't find out it's a fake before he smoked like 10  of them
and still don't get high.

SOME REAL KILLER ACID
Acid is Easy to make, but could kill, only do this if you have
a hell of a lot of nerve. Fake acid really is nothing but
houshold ingredients mixed together to some real badass shit,
you can use stuff like bleach, rat poison, liquid plumber etc. etc.
But I can't guarantee what it will do to your body.

GOOD HOMEBREW WINE
Okay, homebrew wine(as long as no one knows it's homebrew) sell
at a decent price but cost almost nothing to make.
What you need to make this is some red household juice and
ferment or dry ferment. Mix the juice and the ferment together
and let it stand for a couple of weeks, then you got yourself a
nice bottle of wine to sell(would not drink too much of it if
I were you).

MAKING CIDER
Use same method as the wine, only this only have to stand for
two or three days.
