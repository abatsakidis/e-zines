|  1:.   How To Make A Pea Gun                 |==|  Acidous   |
  \_____________________________________________/  \____________/


A pea gun might not seem to be one of the most dangerous
weapons around, but the type of pea gun I am going to explain
here is VERY powerful.
You can seriously hurt people with this thing.
Anyway, here's what you need to make it:

----------------------------------------
| Amount |  Ingredient                 |
|--------|-----------------------------|
|   1    |  Balloon                    |
|   1    |  0,5 l plastic bottle       |
| 1 roll |  Strong tape                |
| 1 pack |  Peas                       |
----------------------------------------

HOW TO BUILD IT:
1. First, cut the bottle where it starts to go straight(A little
    below the nozzle).
2. Now throw away the bottle, but keep the nozzle
    part.
3. Then take the balloon, cut it 1/2 cm above the end of the
    part you blow in.
4. Tread the balloon on the nozzle where the cork
    used to be.
5. Tape it so that it wont fall off then you pull
    in it.

ILLUSTRATION:

      -----  <-- Put
     |=====| <--Balloon
     |=====| <-- Here
    ---------
     /     \
    /       \
   /         \
  /___________\


HOW TO USE IT:
1. Get a hard pea.
2. Put it into the balloon so that it falls to the end of the
    balloon.
3. Grab the pea through the balloon and pull it back.
4. Release the pea and see it fly through the air with an
    incredible speed.

WHY USE IT:
There are many reasons for you to use this powerful weapon.
So I made a little list of stuff you can do with it.
1. Shoot at people hunting you.
2. Shoot at cats.
3. Shoot at windows(and break them).
4. Shoot at your friends.
5. Shoot at your teacher.
6. Shoot at stuff in stores.
7. Have a shooting contest.

|   2;. How To Crash A Computer                |==|  Acidous   |
  \_____________________________________________/  \____________/


This section shows you a couple of ways to crash a computer.
And it's easy too :)
So, on with the crashing!

LOOPING THE COMPUTER
This does only work if you have physical access to the victim
computer, or you have write access to it's windows directory.
What you do is to create a program in VB(Visual Basic)
Double click the new form and type in:

Do
Loop

Then compile the program and call the EXE file EXPLORER.EXE.
Then go to the victim's windows directory, delete the old
EXPLORER.EXE and place your EXPLORER.EXE in the directory.

BLUESCREEN OF DEATH
A bluescreen is every Windows user's most feared phenomenon,
and here you're going to learn how to make one.
Note that this only works under Windows 9x
It's really easy, only type /con/con at the START -> RUN menu
in Windows. But now you're going to learn how to make it
execute every time the poor soul starts his computer.
Of course, this requires physical acccess to the computer, unless
you have already hacked yourself into it.
What you do is to create a new program in VB.
Double click the new form and type in:

Static Msg as String
Msg = "Your computer will now have a bluescreen. This is probably caused
        by the users incompetence. Thank you."
MsgBox Msg, vbCritical, "Incompetent Fool!"
Shell "/con/con"

Compile the program into an EXE and call it EXPLORER.EXE.
Then go to your target's Windows directory and delete his
EXPLORER.EXE, then copy your EXPLORER.EXE to his Windows
directory.

|   3;. Using A Modem In QBasic                |==|  Acidous   |
  \_____________________________________________/  \____________/


A while ago I saw b0g had instructions on how to use a modem to
call in QBasic. I don't know what version of QBasic they used, but
it sure wouldn't work in QBasic 4.5.

I kinda borrowed their code so that I could make it right.
Hope you guys don't mind if I post it here :)


DIM num AS LONG
1
CLS
PRINT "Accessing Modem, Please Wait..."
COM(1) ON
OPEN "COM1: 9600" FOR APPEND AS #1
PRINT #1, "ATZ"; CHR$(15)
SLEEP 1
PRINT #1, "ATX4S11=50"; CHR$(15)
SLEEP 1
PRINT #1, "ATM1"; CHR$(15)
SLEEP 1
PRINT #1, "ATL5"; CHR$(15)
CLS
INPUT "Enter phone number to dial or type 0 to exit ", phonenumber
PRINT
IF phonenumber = 0 THEN GO TO 2
phonenumber = num
PRINT "Dialing:"; num
PRINT #1, "ATDT"; num; CHR$(15)
DO: LOOP UNTIL INKEY$=""
2
PRINT #1, "ATH0"; CHR$(15)
SLEEP 1
PRINT #1, "ATZ"; CHR$(15)
END

This oughta do the trick.
b0g's code only let the line open for 15 seconds, this code
makes it stay open until you press a key.
If you want to keep a record of what you get when calling people
up like this, you could tape a mic to the speaker, and then sit
and laugh of it later on :).

|   4:.    Hacking Windows 95                  |==|  Acidous   |
  \_____________________________________________/  \____________/


I really doubt this is going to help for anything, but I'll include it
anyway. If someone are dumb enough to still run an unprotected version
of Windows 95, then they deserve to get their shares hacked into bits
and pieces.
Of course this is a share-hack. It's just like a network, only over
the internet.

Here's how to do it.

net view \\[TARGET IP]
net use X: \\[TARGET IP]\[SHARENAME]

Just to give you some 31337 knowledge I'll "analyse" these
commands for you.

net view \\[TARGET IP]
Of course NET is an EXE file. View is a sub-command in
NET which returns a list of  all the shares on the host
with the [TARGET IP].

net use X: \\[TARGET IP]\[SHARENAME]
You must use the NET file here too. Only this time the
sub-command USE is being given. X: is the driveletter
the share will be mounted to, and can of course be
replaced by any other letter which is not in use already.
You will need the [TARGET IP] here too, but this time
you will need the name of the share to mount to the
selected driveletter.

Okay, now you (hopefully) have mounted the victim's share
to the wanted drive letter. If the target computer have
no write protection on the folder, you can easily remove
or insert new files and other stuff.

|   5:. How To Hack Tripod/Bigfoot Homepages   |==|  Acidous   |
  \_____________________________________________/  \____________/


Hacking homepages on hosts like like Tripod, Bigfoot and the likes
is really easy.
Yes, easy indeed, yes, so easy..... yes.....
So I'll share one of the simples methods of hacking a homepage on
Tripod, Bigfoot or something in that direction.

I'll use Mark's homepage in this example(Who the hell is Mark?)
Let's go to his homepage.

www.tripod.com/~mark

We look a bit around, gather a little personal info about him and
shit like that.
Aha, you find out his e-mail address is mark@fagface.com.
Cool, you now have his e-mail address, that's so to say the only
thing you need to hack his little page.
Now, get software, or find a net page to send fake e-mail from.
You must be able to set the address it's supposed to be from, or
else it won't work.
Fire up your fake e-mailer and insert his address in the "From" field.
Then type in the address to Tripod Help or whatever it's called.
Type something concerning Password Lost in the subject field.
In the e-mail body type something like:
"Hi!
  I lost my password so I can't
  get into my homepage so I can
  update it.
  Couid you please e-mail me the
  password to mark@beet.com.
  This account is a send only
  e-mail account."

After a couple of days you will receive "your" password.
Then log into your victims page and do whatever you want with
it.

And remember: Defacing is for script kiddies :)

  \_____________________________________________/  \____________/


Bypassing the Win9x login promp can be used to get passed restrictions on
your user. Of course, every dumbass can click the Cancel button, but
that doesn't remove the restrictions. So here's how to bypass the
login prompt in a real 1337 way.
The first thing you have to do is to find the persons username.
You can see all the usernames by going into command prompt,
enter the Windows directory and type DIR.PWL then press [ENTER].
Now, when you have found yourself a user, go to the command prompt.
Start -> Run : Command
go to the Windows directory and type DIR.PWL.
Find the file with the username you choose(it may be shortened by Windows).
Delete the PWL file with the password information for the user you chose
and start Windows. You will be able to set a new password, but still
you won't delete any of the info the user already had(ie. restrictions and
stuff like that).

Yup, how to hax0r mIRC. I won't explain something difficult which takes
long time, like how to get op on a channel(the 31337 way of course).
In my first example here, I will learn you to have mIRC send messages to
other people without you noticing it.
It's all really simple.

Look at this code I included:

n30=on *:connect:/.remote on
n31=on 1:join:#:/.timer 1 10 /msg $nick Hi! I was wondering if you would let
me suck your dogs cock if I gave you a dollar. | /.timer 1 5 /msg $nick 
Would you?

This is something I coded for my mIRC, and it works perfectly.
Let me just "analyze" these lines with commands for you.

n30=on *:connect:/.remote on
When you connect, it turns REMOTE ON. DCC's and other stuff allowed :)

n31=on 1:join:#:/.timer 1 10 /msg $nick Hi! I was wondering if you would let
me suck your dogs cock if I gave you a dollar. | /.timer 1 5 /msg $nick 
Would you?
This one is a little more complex. Let me just remove all the unnecessary
code first.

n31=on 1:join:#:/.timer 1 10 /msg $nick Hi! | /.timer 1 5 /msg $nick Would 
you?
Here's the code stripped down. Now the first part tells the program
to start Timer 1 when someone joins the channel. Timer 1 is supposed to
run for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds have passed, it sends the message with
suck your dog and all that crap to the person who joined the channel.
Then, after sending that text to the person, it starts a Timer 1 over again,
only this time it runs for 5 seconds and sends the Would you? crap.

This code is to be addedd into the SCRIPT.INI file in your mIRC directory.
Of course you can replace any of the code with something else.

  Have Fun :)

|  11.         How To Make Kilju               |==|  HYBRiDO   |
  \_____________________________________________/  \____________/



iNTRODUCTiON
------------
Aaah.. When I think of the alcohol culture over here in Finland, I really 
think I
live in a wonderful country.. It's cold in the winter, and you assemble with 
your
buddys at somebodys house and drink until the morning sun shares the first 
rays of
light to your sensitive eyes.. Well life is not only about 
hardcore-computer-using ;)
It is also there to have some fun, and the kilju [kil'yu] will surely add 
some factor
to the party.. So follow with me and Razor to another trip of our alcohol 
information..


KiLJU RECiPE CONVERTED TO AMERiCAN UNiTS AND SUPPLiES
-----------------------------------------------------
This finnish "national drink" is also easily brewed overseas.. Just grab 
some empty
bottles (prefer empty, plastic 0,5l Coca&Cola bottles..) and the following 
stuff:

  .--------------------------------------------------------.
  | o  one gallon milk carton                              |
  | o  one pack of any baking yeast                        |
  | o  3 quarts of water                                   |
  | o  1/2 cup of apple juice or a pealed and sliced lemon |
  | o  5 cups of sugar                                     |
  `--------------------------------------------------------'

  - Wash the milk cartons first (and wash them very well!)..
  - Then mix 2½ quarts of body temperature water and 5 cups of sugar in any
    kind of pot or bowl (has to be clean too!)..
  - Funnel the mixture into the carton..
  - Add 1/2 cup of apple juice into the carton..
  - Mix the yeast and half quarts of body temperature water and funnel it 
into
    the carton, and SHAKE it!
  - After this, find a good place for the carton, the warmth should be about
    72-76 degrees warm (room temperature)..
  - After a short while, the carton should release quite a stink.. ;)
  - The carton will also produce CO2 and some foam, that is why your carton 
is
    not full, the rest of the space is used for the pressure and the foam..
    You should leave a small opening where the pressure can escape (remember 
the
    stinky ;)
  - You should notice some pressure coming out in about 24-48 hours, 
otherwise
    your yeast is dead because of too hot water or your place for your 
cartons
    is too cold.
  - After a couple of days, shake the carton a bit..

  ....AND TiME PASSES BY... . .   .  .     .

  - In 7-14 days your kilju should be ready.. It is ready when it does not 
produce
    any more pressure..
  - When the kilju is ready, you should change the kilju from the carton to 
one of
    the clean Coke-bottles.. Just be careful, because the yeast stays on the 
bottom
    of the carton, just pour away the clear kilju (and not the dead yeast 
which will
    turn your stomach upside down!!!)..
  - Pour the kilju into the Coke-bottles, and cap them (not too tightly, 
because there
    can be some pressure left).. Store the bottles into some place cool/cold 
and wait
    a couple of days..
  - The alcohol percentage should be about 15-17%, so it is pretty close to 
some
    strong wine.. Enjoy it with your buddys and enemies.. Forget the world 
around you,
    just enjoy the taste.. (by the way, grab a couple of beers, because 
kilju tastes
    pretty shitty sometimes ;)


FiNNiSH RECiPiES
----------------
Now, finished with the finnish/american version of kilju, we turn the page 
and arrive
at the completely finnish section.. These are the best ones, and I hope that 
the people
overseas get the idea and brew them also..

Because the finnish people are fond of kilju, they produce bigger loads of 
kilju at one
time.. Here are some things you can use when preparing a bigger load of 
kilju (for a
real party ;)..


   STUFF YOU NEED FOR BiG LOADS
   ----------------------------
   o  25-30L bucket is a good friend for big loads..
   o  A cover for the bucket, with a hole..
   o  A "air-lock" for the hole.. Like I already said, kilju produces an 
unpleasant
      smell, so you can use a "coal-lock" to lock the smell..
   o  A thin, plastic tube for running the kilju into the bottles..
   o  Lots and lots of bottles..


   THE DiFFERENT YEASTS
   --------------------
   o  Super yeast - Kilju will be ready in about 2-8 days..
   o   Beer yeast - Kilju takes about one week to get ready..
   o Baking yeast - It will take about 7-14 days..


   THE RECiPiES
   ------------
   Well, now over to the good recipies.. Big loads in one week.. Think
   of it, about 25 liters of 10-15% alcohol.. Have a kick-ass party ;)


   THE BASiC KiLJU iN BiG LOADS
   ----------------------------
   For about 30 liters you need: -  7 kg of sugar
                                 -  28 liters of water
                                 -  one bag of super yeast

   The sugar will be melted into the water, and the yeast is poured into the
   sugar-water.. Mix the whole stuff a bit.. Let it be for one week, you
   should get A-Class kilju in a big load..


MiSC iNFO ABOUT KiLJU
---------------------
  o The approved price for kilju is about 10mk (finnish markka) per L..
    10mk is about 1-1,50$ .. You should think of a righteous price for
    the stuff, just how good it is.. If it is shitty, give it away for
    free ;)
  o Some people say that drinking kilju makes your stomach hurt.. It
    depends for every person, but try it and you will know if your
    stomach hurts (mostly in the morning, because of the yeast which
    is still alive ;)
  o A good idea is to pour the kilju through a coffee-filter, which
    removes the most of the yeast, which will make the kilju clear
    and better-tasting (no little pieces of yeast swimming around
    in the bottle ;)


TiME FOR A GOODBYE
------------------
Me and Razor did it again.. Hope you enjoyed this file about kilju.. We
think that you will enjoy this drink around the world.. Spread the info
and remeber to stay tuned on this channel..

  \_____________________________________________/  \____________/


How to make a BIG bomb for your enjoyment :).
Kids, do not try this at home...

WARNING: If the instructions in this article is performed
         a nuclear holocaust may appear, resulting in a nuclear winter,
         which again result in mass death and total destruction of land.

Okay, let's just go through the list of stuff you'll need to
make this.

- About 20 kg of an unstable isotope of uranium
- Proton accelerator
- Lead box
- Protective gear
- Remote control
- Receiver
- Cables
- Lot's of guts
- A deathwish

Now, let's get on with the construction of the bomb.

First of all, put on the protective gear so that you won't start
glowing in the dark if you survive this.
Put the uranium in the lead box and put the lead box in
the proton accelerator(it depends on which type of proton accelerator
you have.) Then take off the startbutton on the accelerator and cut off
the cables. Then open the receive and put the cables from the startbutton
in the receiver so that it will receive the electrical impulses from
the receiver.
Double check the whole thing if everything is connected and set in
the right way. Then get your best chair, put on one of those nasty
white stringvests, turn on the TV and switch to a football channel(Do NOT
use the remote for this!) Get a case of beer, then sit down, start to
drink a beer, and then try to change the channel with the remote...

Now have fun creating your own nuclear bomb! And don't bother writing
a note with your last words, unless you put it three states away
or something.

*** NUKES TO THE PEOPLE ***

|  14.        My Invisibility Theory           |==|  Acidous   |

Well, well, well... Am I not a very good scientist.
I thought about how light worked and how the eye worker, and I wrote
this little theory on invisibility.

Anyway, here goes...

BACKGROUND INFO:
Everything you see is light reflected by other things.
When you see a blue sweater, it's because the sweater absorbs all
other colors than blue. So the blue color will bounce off the sweater
and go into your eye and into the brain. That's how you see it.
Light is simply enough electro-magnetic radiation, and the human
have invented ways to make the light go in other directions than
just straight forward. A mirror can be used to change the course
of the light.

Short reflection rule: in-angle = out-angle.

Illustration:
  |
  |   / <- angle of outcome
  |  /
  | /
  |/
  |-------------  <- axis of incidence
  |\
  | \
  |  \
  |   \ <= angle of incidence
  |

THE THEORY:
If we were able to bend the light in a way so that the light from
behind you were bent around you, but never reached you.
Then the person in front of you would only see what's behind you.
I have not yet came upon an easy way to bend the light, but
magnetic powers may be a solution(but then I need a ***REALY*** strong
magnet). Gravitation could also be a solution, only problem would
be that both these ways would need such a huge power so that it
would most likely destroy the earth before it bent the light.

THE RUMOUR:
I heard somewhere that NASA had invented a type of suit which
made you invisible, but not fully of course.
I think they have used some sort of optical fibers, or something
like that... But I am not sure.
If anyone know more about this, then please send us an e-mail.

If you read Norwegian Underground earlier, you should know that
this is the first issue which actually is something to read.
Try reading the earlier issues, and you know they are just
some short pathetic pieces of shit...
I had lots of real good stuff in it, but it was just too little.
Every issue were about 8-9 Kb, something which is WAAAY to little.

All the next issues will be about the size of this one,
yes, that means about 40-50 Kb and up.
Hopefully I will get all the way up above 100 Kb per issue,
so send us your articles!

Send us everything you write, we'll be happy to add it :)
Send it to: acidous_@hotmail.com .

See you next issue :)
