Announcement:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sorry for the hold-up, but now we're back with new
issues of the Norwegian Underground.


Sneaking Around In Malls:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sneaking around in places your are not allowed to be in are cool.
This is especially cool in malls which are crowded.
There are always a side-door which leads to a place within the mall
where you are not supposed to be, but who gives a shit anyway.
What you need to carry with you is explained in a former issue, so
you better check there if you are uncertain.
The first thing you do when you get into the "forbidden" area of
the mall is to look for cameras, but only do a quick overview for
cameras before you move on, this is because you only have a short
delay before the security guards come in to tell you it's a forbidden
area. So after looking for cameras, find a safe place to hide.
If it's a little niche in the wall a couple of meters up on the wall,
then try to jump up to it and climb in. When the security guards then
arrive, they won't find you.
You should try to move as silently as possible and always stay alert for
security guards, cameras and other people. If you have a laptop and
a digital camera you could take a picture of the room with a camera
in and then load it into the laptop, all you have to do then is to
hotwire the security camera and make it only show the picture of the
empty room(do only work with new cameras).
You could also use some thin wire(the one you use when fishing) and a
bell to make a trip-wire so that you will be alerted if someone is coming.

When inside you could try finding some power-wires, microphone-wires,
phone-lines, etc. to plug up with. Cutting the power, and then
connecting a switch to it is a real killer. You can then turn the
power on and off as you please. But remember to never stay long
at the same place. The security guards and other personel may
come looking if something fishy is going on.


Fun Stuff To Do - The Police:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Get or make some "KKK Forever" bumper stickers and attach them
to the police-cars. Also make some smaller ones and attach
them to the police-officers.
Then call and say there is some fighting or some shit like that
at a colored persons shop. Then hang outside the shop until the
police arrives and watch how cooperative the shop-owner is once
he see the stickers.

Put super-glue on their baton, in the car-keyhole.

Put bananas, apples, potatoes, etc. in their exhaust pipe

Use a spray-can and tag someone elses name/alias on the police
cars, or the police-building.

If you can get to their lockers, put marijuana, acid, coke, or
some other strong shit in it.
Also do this with their cars.

If one of your enemies is having a party, then tell him some guys
are going to come to the party disguised as police-officers just so
they can destroy the whole thing.
Then, when the party have been going for like an hour, call the police
and pretend your are an angry neighbour and complaint about all
the loud music and screaming from your enemies house. Also tell the
police that you tried to tell them to be a little more quiet, but
they just pushed you away and almost beat you up.
Then hang around and see what happens when the police arrives.


Dumpster Diving:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dumpster diving is both cool and informative.
The cool thing is that you can find all kind of stuff in a dumpster.
In public paper-dumpster one can find social security numbers, names,
addresses, porno-mags, magazines you didn't even know exist.
And in those large company dumpsters one can find all kinds of
info about the company, passwords, security lists, etc. etc.
Now, on to the diving.
There are a few security subjects you need to take care of before and
while goind on a dive.
Make sure there is nobody around to see you, also make sure there is
no cameras around when you dive.
Kinda boring getting busted when diving.
Well, anyway, if someone should see you, make sure they won't be able
to identify you later on. Wear dark clothes at night.
If someone sees you, run as fast as you can, and try to always face away
from them. In that way they won't see your face, and won't be able to
give a positive ID on you.


Social Engineering:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Social engineering is a real beauty.
It takes a lot of time and practice to become a good social engineer.
Social engineering could be to call, let's say US National Bank HQ, and
pretend you are Vladimir Khrustsjov, what will they do then?
They'll probably just say something like "Sorry, but we have no Khrustsjov
in our database" and hang up on you.
But if you call the local US National Bank and asks who's in charge of that
specific bank(maybe pretend you're an angry customer), and then call the
HQ pretending you are that person, and tell them you need the info on,
let's say Johnny Johnson, for verification, and it seems there is a problem
with the upling to the HQ. Then give them a FAX-number within the bank.
You might want to try hotwiring the local banks FAX machine so that it
forwards all FAX's to a public FAX machine. Since I used a bank in this
example, it will be very unlikely it will work at all.

Another way to gain the info you want is to dumpster dive(see last topic).
Just search through all the papers in the dumpster and pick up everything
of interest.
Then use the info you found in the dive and pretend you are the person you
gathered info on. This is also a very good way to get info on people
so that you might blackmail them, sell the info or whatever you want to
do with it.


Making Money, Fast:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OK, everyone needs money, only someone need the money a little faster than
others.
So I included a few ways to make money, fast.
And if you are looking for a way to counterfeit money, then look elsewhere.

CHARITY
Take a large cup, or a large plastic cup-looking-thing.
Make a hard lid with a coin hole in and cover it with paper
Print out from the computer or draw the logo
of some charity foundation on the front(American Cancer Foundation or 
something).
Then go from door to door(not your own neighbourhood) and collect cash.
You can easily collect a few hundred dollars this way.

BLACKMAIL
Use social engineering(see last topic), spy, pay for info etc. etc. to get
information on a person, and then blackmail him.
But remember not to blackmail for too much money, then you will have a
hell of a problem with the cops later on.

PROTECTION
If there's a little kid that get's picked on all the time, tell him
you'll protect him from the big bullys if he give you some cash.
You can also do this to shop-owners and people like that if you are a
little older and have a couple of comrades with you.

SCOUTs COOKIES
Get on some scouts clothes and bake some cookies. Then go door to door
and sell cookies to stupid people who thinks you really are a scout.
A tip when doing this is to look real innocent.

SELLING DRUGS
You can make a lot of money by selling drugs. Not any real drugs
of course(you can get busted for selling real drugs).
Just make yourself some drugs with some shit you got at home(see earlier
issue for info on how to make some drugs).
Then sell it at school, in the streets and stuff like that.
And you can't get busted for selling oregano either, hehe.

SELLING KILJU
The liter price for kilju is pretty good(if the kilju is good of course).
Check out HYBRiDO and RAZOR's file at www.textfiles.com for instructions
on how to make kilju.


Scaring The Shit Out Of People #4:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Yeah, back with the Scaring The Shit Out Of People again.
Got some new good scaring methods in this issue too.

ROOFTOP SNIPER
Get a big plastic bag(you get them in grocery stores).
Then fill it up with stuff like mustard, honey, syrup,
shampoo, mayonnaise, piss, spit, fat, oil, etc. etc.
Then get on the top of a tall building. And then
when you see a group of people with nice clothes on them
drop the bag and see what happens when it hits your victims.

EXPLODING ROOM
Place M80s all over a room and connect them to each other with fast
burning fuses, then connect a tripwire to something that might light
them up(the flaming box trap works perfect, see earlier issue for charts).
Then, when your victim enters the room and trips the flaming box, a
few seconds goes by, and suddenly the whole room starts exploding around
him.
