Introduction-------------------------------------------------------------------I apologize, but this issue of Banana Juice is coming out a couplemonths late.  I don't mean to make excuses, but we were having web spaceproblems, and personally, I was having computer problems.Still, we have one fucked up, righteous issue of Banana Juice/issuenumber five.  In my opinion, this could be one of the better issues everand definitely the most humorous.Unfortunately, this could be one of the last text issues of BananaJuice.  Our next issue is going paper back--but, if sales are alright, Iwill release this in ASCII text once again for you text nerds out there!So kick back, read on, grab a banana and enjoy!-------------------------------------------------------------------2. We Need Help!!!-------------------------------------------------------------------Banana Juice needs your help!We have a severe lack of funding (being a teenager, and the most worthything I own is a bin of pornos), we need your help to keep this thinggoing.Banana Juice would like to start a cd reviews section for all theunderground local music (Chicago area) that we can get.  This cause aproblem with purchasing the cds--We can not afford them!  So, I havecome up with two solutions--1.)  If you see me anywhere, you can hand me the album that you wouldlike to be reviewed.  I am at a lot of shoes in the chicago area, so Ihave included some pictures (<ahref="http://www.shoecandy.com/~bananajuice/i1/mugshot1.jpg">here</a>,<ahref="http://www.shoecandy.com/~bananajuice/i1/mugshot2.jpg"> andhere</a>).  I will also try to wear a self made banana juice patchsomewhere on my apparel, so you can recognize me that way.2.)  If I have put a pay pal sign somewhere on this site, idea numbertwo is already in effect.  The idea is that if you like this site, andwant to see it grow, you donate money to us.  The first thing I wouldbuy is a P.O. box so you could send your stuff to us.  Plus, the moneywill also fund for us to go to shows, equipment, etc.So, in other words, please help us!  We are desperate!-------------------------------------------------------------------3. Freedomby Nick Velk-------------------------------------------------------------------Freedom fries. Freedom toast. Freedom dressing. Sound gay and stupid?You bet. You can thank your local member of Congress for changing thenames of French fries, French toast, and French dressing in the Housecafeterias. Spearheaded by Republican representatives Bob Ney and WalterJones, the name changes are meant as a protest against French oppositionto the Bush administration's Iraq war plans."This action today is a small, but symbolic effort to show the strongdispleasure of many on Capitol Hill with the actions of our so-calledally, France," said Bob Ney, the chairman of the Committee on HouseAdministration.I guess somebody neglected to tell Mr. Ney and Mr. Jones that Frenchfries originated in Belgium. The "French" in French fries doesn't referto its country of origin. It refers to the way in which this side dishis prepared. Food that is cut into strips is said to be "Frenched."Since French fries are strips of potato that have been fried, theybecame known as French fried potatoes, or "French fries." Dumbasses...So this is how our elected officials are spending their time?!? What thehell is wrong with these people?!?  It's just food! Do you really thinkyou are helping the country, or anybody for that matter, by eliminatingthe word "French" from your cafeterias?What's next? Is the government going to outlaw the instruction of Frenchin our public schools? Are we going to stop learning French history too?During World War One and Two, many schools dropped German instructionfrom their curriculum. During the Cold War, instruction in Russianlanguage and culture went the same way. Are we going to repeat thesesenseless actions once again? Maybe we're going to bomb the Eiffel Towerreplica in Las Vegas.It's no wonder why half the world hates America.America is like a conceited, narcissistic cheerleader: Her head is sofar up her own ass that she can't see why anyone wouldn't like her.-------------------------------------------------------------------4. Boy plays hide and go seek; never foundby C.B. Renz-------------------------------------------------------------------A little boy is missing following an intense game of hide and go seekthis thursday. The boys name is Mikey Smalls, and the incident occurredon 144 W. Green St. on Chicago's lower west side. According to Mikey'sfriend, Jimmy Little, Mikey has been missing for the past three days."We were just playing, I didn't mean for anything bad to happen. I toldhim not to do it," cried Jimmy. "He offered me his fire truck if Iplayed, and it goes vrrrrooommmm, so I said yes."The incident has left the neighborhood stunned. Many mothers are nowboth angred and saddened by the incident. One of the mothers, CynthiaKieger, has founded a new organization to help keep kids safe."We're calling this the Mothers Against Children Having Fun (MACHF),"commented Cindy. "We believe that it is better to be safe than have anyfun at all. Our children's futures are depending on it!"While the mothers were teamed up in their fight against entertainment,many officials came in to view the scene--little was found. Localinvestigators then began to bring in outside help.One source of help came from the University of Illinois' Gregor Mezdel.Gregor Mezdel has degrees in both nuclear physics and astronomy, and hasbrought up an important theory in the mystery of Mikey: The Black HoleTheory."When the positive energy is too high in a child," stated Gregor, "thiscan create a tear in the space time continuum. This would suck the childin like a worm, and collapse due to the matter of the child. It isreally quite simple."While many debated over the 'Black Hole Theory', and also Gregor'ssanity, there were other possibilities that were put forth. Suchpossibilities include falling in the garbage disposal, being mailed toChina, and even murdered by O.J.Still, many believe that Mikey is still out there. The parents of MikeySmalls urge you to notify police if you see a small blonde hair, blueeyed boy that resembles a mouse. Your help would be greatly appreciated.-------------------------------------------------------------------5. Politicians; Scum of the Earthby Nick Velk-------------------------------------------------------------------There's some good news and some bad news in local politics, folks. First, the good news: Rod R. Blagojevich was sworn in as Illinois' 40th governor, replacing George Ryan, who is well known for the "Licenses for Bribes" scandal and for recently clearing all inmates off of Illinois' death row. The bad news? Rod R. Blagojevich is now Illinois' new governor.Blagojevich has been accused of having mob ties and many feel that he owes his entire political career to his father-in-law, Dick Mell, who happens to be an alderman for the city of Chicago. Why are politicians so corrupt?  That's the very question I've been grappling over lately. Men like Blagojevich, Ryan, George W. Bush, etcetera, are known as "Professional Politicians," meaning they make their living through politics. Sure, they may have had a career before they were elected to public office, but not anymore. Once they became professional politicians, all else became null and void. Their families are just an obstacle. Anything about their past will just get in the way of their futures in politics. You may be asking yourself, what can we do? Aren't all politicians "professionals" and therefore scum? Believe it or not, no. There are some politicians that were elected to office for some odd reason. Take Jesse Ventura, former governor of Minnesota. He was a pro-wrestler and then he decided to run as an independent candidate in Minnesota's gubernatorial election. Ventura, being a former wrestler, probably isn't that intelligent of a man, but I bet he's smarter than the average politician. With his limited intelligence, he isn't able to get involved with scandals or embezzle money. He just thinks about holding the economy in a headlock and body slamming that abortion bill. All and all, I think Minnesota became better with Jesse as governor. Another example of an unconventional politician is Ronald Reagan. He acted in B-rate movies in the fifties and later became governor of California and a B-rate president. He actually made California a better place and, in my opinion, didn't fuck America up too badly either. We didn't get into any wars <ahem> George W. <ahem> and the only thing he screwed up on was his management of the economy during the early eighties (Reaganomics). Then there was Sonny Bono. He was a shitty singer during the seventies and he also lacked intelligence, but he did a fairly decent job as a congressman in California until he skied into a tree. I see I'm rambling a bit, so I'll get to my point: All politicians should die in skiing accidents.-------------------------------------------------------------------6. Big Mediaby C.B. Renz-------------------------------------------------------------------Never has there been a more persuasive tool than the media and itsairwaves. It is clear that whoever rules the airwaves generally rulesthe opinions and sympathy of the country's citizens. Unfortunately, theairwaves are getting into fewer hands and releasing fewer opinions asmulti-billion dollar media conglomerates are beginning to buy up theircompetition.It used to be that corporate media firms were only allowed to own onemedia station per city and were not allowed to own a TV station andnewspaper in the same town. But, in 1996, Congress passed a bill thatset aside most limits on how much of America's broadcasting industry bigmedia firms could own. Now a third of the country's radio stations havebeen bought out by media conglomerates and more than three-quarters ofall Americans watch television stations owned by one of six companies.This combats the guidelines set by the Carnegie Commission ofEducational Television which was written in 1967: "We seek for theartist, the technician, the journalist, the scholar, and the publicservant freedom to create, freedom to innovate, freedom to be heard inthis most far-reaching medium. We seek for the citizen freedom to view,to see programs that the present system, by its incompleteness, denieshim."The problem with "media consolidation" is that multi-billion dollarmedia conglomerates buy up their competition and then centralize theiroperations. Not only does this take away from better local programmingand more news stories, it also puts forth the possibility of endangeringcommunities due to inaccessibility to the town's airwaves.One case of this possibility would be what occurred in January of 2002in Minot, North Dakota. In Minot, a train derailed, spilling 210,000gallons of ammonia. Officials wanted to put out a warning to itscitizens through the media but were unable to because 6 of the 7channels in the town were owned by the Clear Channel Communications,located in far-off studios.Also, a recent study by Columbia University's Project of Excellence inJournalism proves that local programming produces better newscasts withless celebrity profiling and more local stories. And, one of the biggestthings the big media conglomerates don't cover is themselves.Most Americans, seventy-two percent, aren't even aware of the debateover media consolidation. And, according to the Center of PublicIntegrity, big media conglomerates and our government are too tiedtogether to be comfortable. According to the center "the fifty largestmedia companies and four of their trade associates spent 111.3 milliondollars between 1996 and mid-2000 to lobby Congress and the executivebranch." Also, from 1993 to 2000, media corporations have given 75million in campaign contributions to candidates for federal office andto the two major political parties.This means that the government is in the wallets of big mediaconglomerates and therefore the media conglomerates don't cover mediapolicy debates in their newscasts.Plus, more and more often newscasts are finding it not enticing tochallenge the policies that their bosses philosophize so often. One casewould be a story that Channel 7 news was doing on their parent company,Disney. In the story it was stated that Disney was not doing properbackground checks which were leading to the hiring of convictedpedophiles. ABC quickly dropped the story when it was contended byDisney.This trend of media consolidation brings up the question that if thisoccurs at the same pace it has been--Will democracy still exist in theyears to come? It is true that we are persuaded by television which canbe proved by our current war with Iraq and the 90% approval rating ofour president due to the media pushing for presidential support andpro-war protests. But, are we on our way to a future dictatorship run bythe IBMs and Mickey Mouses?On June 26, the FCC is voting to remove all remaining buying laws over airwaves.  Contact your local Congress and tell them that you do not agree with media consolidation and that big media conglomerates should not have amonopoly over the airwaves, which technically belong to the public. Bepatriotic, help democracy, and help keep news media independent andworthwhile.-------------------------------------------------------------------7. Cloudsby Capn'-------------------------------------------------------------------In the post 9-11 world, clouds are more important than ever. Withoutclouds we would be pouned on by extreme amounts of sunlight. Sunlightcan lead to skin cancer, and that ain't good.  So it would seem like I would be an advocate of clouds and the thingsthat clouds do for society. But I'm not.Now I bet you want to ask me, "Mike, how can you possibly hate clouds. They stop skin cancer.   Are you saying you like skin cancer?  Maybeeven love it?" To that I say, "NO!". How could you possibly ask such athing.  Skin cancer is one of the most horrible diseases of the skinknown to man.  Acne can't hold a candle to some really nasty melanoma. So, no dear reader, I don't like skin cancer.But that doesn't mean I have to like clouds and you know it.Sometimes clouds can be nice.  Those long whisphy clouds you see in thesummer while your eating a delicious Eskimo Pie are unforgettable.  Butfor every day of what some cloud-enthusiasts call "wonder-clouds", thereare dozens of days of heavy gray clouds that cover the whole sky. Thosesuck!Not being able to see the blueness of the sky just plain reels in myrod.  "Wonder-clouds" are not worth the depressing gray (sometimesblack) days of winter.  So in conclusion, I ain't a cloud fan and I never will be.  Now somebodyget me some cotton candy. Hey!, did you ever notice how cotton candylooks like a cloud.  I like cotton candy. Change in plans.  Clouds (i.e.cotton candy of the sky) are sweeeeeeet-------------------------------------------------------------------8. Ugly fat woman under fire for wearing tight clothingby C.B. Renz-------------------------------------------------------------------An ugly fat woman is under major controversy after walking down a NorthRidge street while wearing tight clothing.The incident happened around noon on Sunday. Local pediatrician, MichaelSpinner, was receiving his mail when he observed the incident. "I hadnever seen anything like it," claims Michael. "The ripples in the shirtlooked like an aftermath of an earthquake. I have never seen anythingmore grotesque in my life!"While sightings piled up, police became bewildered. "We've had reportsfrom anything resembling an elephant looking lady to someone who resembles thenutty professor in some way," quoted Police Chief Zimber on Sunday. "Weare currently looking into the situation."Local police have put out a bulletin since that report. The North Ridgepolice urge anyone who has seen a lady with ripples like anearthquake's aftermath in her shirt to please report the incident tothem. There will be a reward of five jelly donuts to whomever comes upwith information which resolves the situation.-------------------------------------------------------------------9. Dear Colleen-------------------------------------------------------------------Dear Colleen,	I've always taken my relationships very seriously,ever since my first relationship back in eight grade.I've always expected (even demanded) a great deal ofemotion linked to every relationship. I'm a huge fanof cuddling and sharing thoughts, all those kinds ofsweet things. I'm definitely one of those girls whodoesn't care what her boyfriend looks like, as long ashe's as sweet as pie and just as tasty to talk to. Buthere comes my problem. I recently went through a veryvery rough breakup with the love of my life, who Iwas... lets say very intimately attached to. I feel notlike the sweet innocent single and searching for thatperfect cutie-pie kinda girl I used to be, but insteadI'm desperately trying to get with the hottest guyaround... all the time. I've been finding myself doingthings I never would have even thought about doingbefore with guys I've never even met. Is this just abounce-back craze? Am I just looking for the action Imiss getting from my ex? Or have I just changed to ahorny slut because I got my taste of sex and now Ijust want more more more? Please please help! I'mdesperately in need!							-Desperately Lonely,								Trinidad, CO        {plain}Dear Desperately Lonely,	Life really sucks I'd have to say. I remember myeight grade years! I used to sit by this really cuteboy in our German class. Mmm, except now he's not cuteanymore, because he got his haircut and he's a gothypunk boy with a really ugly girlfriend. That happensto a lot of boys... it bugs me to the max definitely.And then all the ugly boys grow up to be hotties andthat bugs me too. It ticks me off when the really sexyguys hook up with ugly girls, its all like 'what doesthis tramp have that I don't?!' What really bugs me iswhen a guy is so gorgeous, but he's all sensitive andwants to like cuddle and writes me poems and stuff.Ick, that stuff just icks me out crazy style. I justwant a guy to be big and muscley, and not try toimpress me with his big head, I think smart guys aretotal turnoffs. Oh gosh, speaking of turnoffs, I can'tstand guys with ugly teeth! Oh my gosh, some of theseguys at school really need to learn how to use atoothbrush for gods sake! Oh my... its so annoying.Especially when a sexy guy has gross teeth, and he allwants to kiss you and stuff and its like 'woah woah' Idon't want that crap on my teeth! I (unlike somepeople) clean my teeth regularly because yellow teethlook terrible! Especially with lipstick, gahross-ness!Even worse when gross teeth have gross lipstick onthem! Heheh yuckers! Oh oh, so what I'm really tryingto get across to you and all my spectacular awesomereaders is make sure you brush and floss and payattention when you're putting on your lipstick babes!Catch yah on the flip side! MWAH!          {italic}Dear Colleen,	I was in a seven-year relationship with a wonderfulmarried man I'll call Hank. We were discreet andrespectful with his wife. She died three months agoafter a lingering illness. A month after that, Hanksuggested we date openly and talked as though we werea couple. But, two weeks ago, he canceled our plans atthe last minute, saying he had had a "surrealexperience" and "what was OK then is not OK now." Hewould not be more specific. I begged for anexplanation and closure. He refused to be morespecific and became defensive. We have not spokensince. Colleen, I am still reeling from this because Ithought we had a strong friendship and a foundationfor something in the future. Friends have told me thatrejection of the mistress after the death of a wife isvery common. Can you give me some insight into theemotional dynamics of this situation?-Former Mistress in Mourning	Brigaton, CA         {plain}Dear Mistress in Mourning,	Oh my god, this married guy totally wanted to cheaton his wife with me this one time! I was at a carnivaland he touched me a couple times in line and saiddirty things to me, and he was wearing a wedding ring.Ick, it was pretty nasty I'd say! I kicked him in thego-nads so it was all good after that, 'cause I ranpretty fast. Speaking of surreal experiences, I hadone, but I didn't know it until I looked up surreal inthe dictionary for my English paper. But I was runningdown the street from this guy I kicked in the go-nads,and this other guy totally shouted behind me. I turnedaround and saw that it was my friend Jonathan (oh mygod is he a hottie! Yowzers) and after I turned arounda car totally crashed into the building like ten feetbehind me where I was about to run to! Isn't that madfreaky? Surreal even... at least I remember thinkingthat after I looked it up in the dictionary. I wonderwhats going on at the mall, maybe I could get adictionary there. The mall has been fairly lacking inhot guys lately, I went there to check some out andthey were all pretty gross or with gross girlfriends.Or the skanky ones, I hate the skanky girlfriends!Gosh, all guy are looking for in a girl is an emptyhead and a full chest! Our peoples in this world areso shallow! Oh crap, I have to go my mom just camehome and she's flippin out crazy style, no problemwith the help lady!Dear Colleen,	I'm so sick of the world. It seems like out of mytight knit group of friends, I'm always the last toknow everything. In fact, I'm the last to hearanything period! I found out this evening that mybrother has a girlfriend, one that he's been datingfor over a year and a half. No one tells me anything,it seems like no one is listening! It seems like I'mnot here, or not important, people just blow me offlike I'm nothing, like I'm no one. This sick cruelworld hates me. I hate it. I hate it. I just wantsomeone to listen to me talk, I want someone to answermy questions. Am I crazy Colleen? I just want to feellike someone cares, like someone feels that I'mimportant, and that I shouldn't be the last to heareverything. What's wrong with me Colleen?						-Lacking Self-worthDear Lacking Self-Worth,	I'm sorry to say, but the other two people wrote alot of crap about their lives. Here at this Bannanathingy we don't get much room to write our columnarticles so I am kinda cramped on my space. I'll getto you next time babe, make sure you just read thenext issue. Catch yah on the flip side sweetie!-------------------------------------------------------------------10. Local pot head sees Godby C.B. Renz-------------------------------------------------------------------This Saturday, local pot head Johnny McSmoke claimed to have had anaspiration from god.  According to Johnny's remarks, God apparentlyreached down from heaven and asked Johnny if he had "any Dorritos."Johnny then cleverly answered, "No, but I have some Fritos, man!"Scientists are still looking into the claims.-------------------------------------------------------------------11. Santa's Reindeer to bomb Iran by C.B. Renz-------------------------------------------------------------------After failing to get the UN on his side in disarming Iran, George W Bushhas moved up north in his endeavors (way up north).  In order to helphis cause, George W Bush has hired all of Santa's reindeer, includingthe infamous Rudolph, to aid in the United States bombing on Iran.George W. is also dealing with Santa to allow elves to plant peppermintbombs on Iran soil.-------------------------------------------------------------------12. Poor homeless guy has the bomb; Bush disapprovesby C.B. Renz-------------------------------------------------------------------Poor homeless guy Marcus Smith has released a statement to the publicinforming Mr. Bush that he now has the bomb.  Mr. Smith has warned thecurrent Bush administration that if they don't meet his demands, Mr.Smith will bring cruel and certain armageddon to the the world.  Hisdemands consist of (1) five cans of tuna, (2) twenty dollars in cash,(3) a new jacket, (4) a new pair of shoes, and (5) a weeks worth oftrojan condoms.
