                         Hacker's Information Report
                           I N T R O D U C T I O N

Well the first issue turned out okay, but it was incredibly short.  Thank
goodness I can announce a few new writers! Those of you familiar with such
well-known works as the Legion of Doom/Legion of Hackers Tech Journals,
Phrack Magazine, and the old Communications of The New Order Mags might see
a stunning resemblance.  The goals of this magazine are simple: to continue
the spread of knowledge that helps keep information free for those who wish
to have it (that means you if you're reading this)  All articles are
completely H/P related.  No death or destruction; no credit card phraud or
stealing things from stores.  This is HACKING and PHREAKING.  Exploring phone
networks, pbx's, data structures, and contributing to the general spread of,
well, Hacker's Intelligence is what this mag is about.

  First off I'd just like to mention some of you, you might have read about
this in the last issue of blacklisted!411, and I cover much of the same
information but expanded on it quite a bit, Also my writing won't be very much
of quality now because I'm just struggling to sit down right now, but believe
me the information is worth your while.  A couple weeks ago I picked up a
copy of blacklisted and stumbled upon an article that someone wrote in
about hacking the cops.
        Basically what it said is as follows:

yah know those nifty little 
thingies the cops got in their cars that they use to run license plates on
to find your identity.  And believe me, if a cop has a car he has a laptop
inside, they've got me twice on that when me and a friend took his dad's car
out for a stroll.  Anyhow, if they've got the power, why shouldn't we?
You can run reports for your friends, see whats on their permanent record, 
find out their phone number, name, social security number, and about
anything else there is to know about any given person, if they've got a car.

What the thing is, is a little device you hook up between yer laptop(and i say
laptop for a reason i'll explain later) and your scanner/ham radio. It turns
ordinary data binary or ascii into a terminal node a scanner or ham radio can send
to the destination it is trying to reach.
   Like any other bum I know, I wanted to know more about this device.  It
especially sparked my interest that the nationwide manufacturers of this thing
were local, at a place called:

Kantronics
1202 E. 23rd St.
Lawrence ks,
66046
913-842-7745
fax: 913-842-2031

I gave them a call and they proved helpful, i talked to a guy named Don Rixon,
real nice guy, after asking a few questions about the KPC-3 device I asked if
he could send me a packet of information before purchasing.  Not only did he
give me that, he gave me numbers to several Radio and Electronic stores around
my area and catalogs and magazines that might be useful for beginners.
A few days later I got the information about the device and everything it
works with. They included a packet which included guidelines and help from
remote accessing your TNC(terminal node, what the data is sent onto), the
packet personal mailbox(PBBS), working with a full service BBS to forward
messages (neet stuff), GPS interfacing, the KA-Node networking system, WEFAX
(for KPC-3 and KPC-3 plus), the NEW EMWIN mode, KISS mode (for TCP/IP
operation), and DAMA mode (the European node system mode).   ok..that probably
sounds a little foreign to you now and i'm not going to go into depth about
all of this stuff because some of it takes a little bit of background in the
workings of other protocols and Ham Radio knowledge and such.
******************************************************************************
Note to wise: when i said laptop earlier, i meant it, because when you are
hooked up on ham radio, you can go anywhere you want without being traced (in
our case the same freq the cops use to run license plates, it shouldn't be
hard to find.  But when you broadcast something (enter plate number?) you are
a sitting duck.
******************************************************************************
    All the stuff they gave me was very up to date.  The best thing they sent
me was the information on their software of choice(Host Master II+) for now
I'll list the units manufactured by Kantronics/RFconcepts and how much they
cost before I explain them.

Now that I've bored you to death I'll Tell you a lil bout the software pack
they sent me, on Host Master II+ Simultaneous Multi-Mode Terminal Software,
and wOOP it's fer pc's yew juss need DOS 3.1 er higher...

   Hostmaster II+ is used to match wif Kantronics KAM, KPC, or Data Engine.
Multiple windows allow seeral packet connects at the same time, each displayed
on it's own window.

WHen used with KAM, simultaneous operation on HF is also supported in RTTY,
ASCII, G-TOR, AMTOR, pactor, or CW. it also is pretty leet kos it provides
the ability to select non-standard address and interupt vectors for the
serial ports installed in a komputah, allowin use of com3 and 4, while com1
and 2 are used fer other activities.  If you want to learn more about
the KPC-3 or KAM device which i didn't cover as much as I would have liked to
call up Kantronics 913-842-7745...or ask me...muh inet accounts theese days
are unstable so just look for me on
irc as kminor or round 913/816 as tgsnoop/ttysnoop

I guess I'll make it a tradition now to include at least one project for
the guys who just can't keep their hands off the soldering iron.  Pardon
the cheesiness of this article.  I wrote this about the spring of 1996,
nearly a year and a half ago.  I modded this article a bit to fix some
of the bugs.  There are many things you can do with this fuscia box.  I
have one that has 2 LEDs on it, one green, and one red, with a toggle
switch instead of a pushbutton.  The Green lite turns off and the red one
turns on when you bypass the "detection circuit".  Fun.  Anyways, on with
the show..

        By Axon



I dunno if there is already a "fuscia box" with some other 
function than this one has, so if there is, I'm sorry.  Ain't 
heard of it as of yet.  This is so much easier to make than most 
boxes.  Almost ANYONE can do it! (Heh.  Look, even *I* can!)
I based this from an article that I saw in 2600 magazine.  I 
tweaked it a little, and made it a bit more portable. (The 
version in 2600 suggested taking apart a FONE and building it 
INTO the fone...ACK!)  Commends to "No comment" and "Crash 
Test Idiot" an their skills, to which I owe gratitude (too bad
they can't even get the part #'s right though). But I think this
will work a bit better, and a tad more portable (stick it in a
pocket!)

Heer's a phun device for those late nite boxing raids...
How would you like a device that alerted you when someone 
picked up a phone, either in yer house, or if yer beiging, in 
the house yer borrowing the line from?  Even better, if you 
attempt to hook up to a house where there's a conversation 
going on on the fone, it doesn't even let you in, so they have 
no idea anyone even tried to beige (no click,click)...now, add 
the ability to override this little device...does it sound good?
If so, jot down this parts list, an head for radio-haq...
(make sure u got a soldering iron, a screw driver, electrical 
tape, a few strands of thin insulated fone wire, and some solder,
as these will come in handy for this project...)

We'll need only a few inches of 2-wire fone base cord, and all 
u need is 1 connector, not both, If u need 2 buy a 6" cord at 
radio haq, I dunno the Cat. #, but I'm sure u can find some...

It's important that you get these specific parts except for the
switch...just make sure the switch fits inside the box without
whacking up the stuff inside. You want this specific modular jack
because It forms a nice, completely closed box, when you assemble
the wiring plate (included) with the cover, and it has plenty of
free space inside for this little project.  The rectifier and
zener diode are fairly specific to this project, due to the load
and voltage of the phone line.  Take it from me, don't substitute.
You can use almost any 2 volt LED, and any type of switch you want,
but I recommend the ones I specified, 'cause I know it'll all fit
in the box.
                               
._.>-*?HoW DoeS iT Werk?*-<._. 

For those of you who know very little about electronix, the 
whole heart of this toy is the zener diode.  What in da world 
is a zener diode?  Well, how do I say this?  Okay, it's like a 
dam, you know, for water.  If there's not enough water to 
reach the top of the dam, nothing gets through.  Well, with a 
zener diode, if there aren't enough volts, it don't let any 
electricity pass through it, and it only works one-way. have 
you ever seen water go UP a dam? (If so, get a UA...) When a 
fone is picked up, the telco "sees" it, and sends a 20 er so 
volt dial tone. If you pick up another fone on the same line, 
each fone gets only 10 or so volts...see where I'm headed.  
Remember? Our zener diode is set for 15 volts.  If 2 fones are 
on the same line, and one of them is going through this 
device, it won't let you through, and the LED will turn off, 
saying that someone else is on that line.  That's where the 
pushbutton switch comes in.  What if you don't give a rat's 
ass if someone is using the line, like, you wanna scream "GET 
OFF DA FONE!!!" or something...Easy.  Press the little 
override button, and talk...you gotta HOLD the override 
button (unless you get a toggle)...sorry (bad memories of my
walkie-talkie days...push the button, THEN talk...)  The
reason this device cuts your line, is so that if you aren't
looking at the red LED the whole time, you will still know
that you've been had.  I'd imagine there's a way to work
around the muting effect of this apparatus, but this is
easier to make.

After you get good at making these, you may just want to buy 
2 Boxes and 2 rectifiers, since everything else comes in pairs...
these DO sell, assuming you know people who would buy them.  
Don't go ready to make extras your first time, you may need 
some of those spares, believe me.  Get good at this before 
mass-producing them.

._.>-*!aSSeMBLY oF THe FuSCia BoX!*-<._.
 
1) Read through all these instructions before you so much as
   rip open a package.  It'll help you.

2) Open up all the packages, and arrange the parts on an 
   uncluttered workbench or counter.

3) take the nut off the collar of the switch.

4) Identify the cathode of the zener diode and the LED.
   a) The Zener diode's cathode is the wire coming from the end 
      that has the black stripe painted around it.
   
   b) The LED's cathode is the SHORTER of the two wires.

5) Solder the two cathodes together, making sure not to get 
   solder on the main part of the components.  (you may want 
   to solder as close to the components as possible, and chop 
   off any extra wire.)

6) Get the Bridge Rectifier.  It has 4 leads coming out of it. 
   One of them has a + sign next to it, and the other one has 
   a - sign next to it.  solder the free end of the LED to the
   lead labeled "+", and the other free wire from the Zener 
   diode to the lead labeled "-". Notice that you have not
   done anything with the other two unlabeled leads on the 
   rectifier, yet.

7) Cut 2 strands of fone wire, about 2" apeice. Solder each of 
   these to a lead on the switch.  Screw one of the wires down
   to the red terminal on the wiring block, and solder the other
   wire from the switch to a place between the LED and zener 
   diode.  You may just want to join it in to the same place you
   soldered the LED and zener together.   
   
8) Cut off one of the connectors on the short fone cord, and 
   the outer cover, and then strip the red and green wires.

9) Cut off a few more inches of that fone wire, and strip the two 
   ends.  Solder one end to the minus sign of the rectifier,
   yes, the same place the zener diode went... solder the other
   end onto the red wire on the stripped end of the short fone 
   cord.

10)Remember the two unscathed leads on the rectifier?  Well, 
   point to one of them at random.  Now, solder another peice 
   of fone wire to that lead, and screw the other end down to 
   the red terminal, with the switch wire.

11)Screw the stripped green wire from the short cord to the 
   green terminal on the wiring block.  TADAA!  U just 
   completed the ELECTRONIC part of this thing. 

12)Drill 2 holes in the cover (for the LED and Switch).

13)Before putting the cover on, wrap all loose connections w/ 
   that electrical tape, so u don't short anything out...

14)stick the switch through the hole in the cover (omitting the
   lock-washer, and then put the nut back on the collar of the
   switch.  Push the LED through the other hole, and reassemble
   the case!

15)There should be a fone wire hanging out of the back of this 
   thing... plug that wire into a fone jack.  now, plug another
   fone into the jack on your box.  Pick up the fone.  does the
   LED light up?  If not, you screwed up. if so, your halfway
   there.

16)have someone pick up another fone on that same line.  If the
   LED turns off, and you hear the line go dead, press and hold
   the button on the box.  If the LED lights back up, and you 
   hear the line is back to normal, then it's a success!

17)Find many creative ways to use this device, and have fun!

This article will cover ports.  What are ports?  Well, on most internetted
computers, especially in the UN*X world, there are MANY programs running at
once.  Many of them are servers, or daemons (pronounced "demons") as we shall
call them.  When you telnet to a host, usually you connect via TCP (Transmiss-
ion Control Protocol) to port 23, which usually services Telnet connections.
Typically, a program on the remote computer is running called "telnetd", or
telnet daemon, a program serving telnet connections.  To make this simple, I
will just list TCP functions of the ports.  (there is also a UDP <User Data-
gram Protocol> function that is specified for most ports as well.  I won't
mess with these, because most of them are the same).  I fought with myself on
exactly how to put this thing together.  "Do I make it short, showing only the
really nessecary ports, or do i list all of them i have?"  I kind of made this
a compromise between the two.  This is a list of some of the most popular
ports, and most of them are all you'll need to either find out more info from
the server, obtain superuser status on the server, or bring it to its knees.
Labels marked with a * will be discussed after the list, because they offer
some interesting points of hacking interest.

80      http            Web Stuff (web browsers use this port to get HTML)
110     pop3            Post Office Protocol-Incoming mail
113     auth            authorization service

Some of these ports are really worth mentioning twice (some of them have 2 or
more uses!)  I guess I'll start from the top, but first, "How do i connect to
these ports?!"  As I mentioned earlier, these are all ports that use TCP.  It
just so happens that Telnet is almost a raw TCP connection, so what better to
use than telnet.  I'll assume we're dealing with a standard UNiX system here.
Typically, when we type "telnet somewhere.yermom.com" the telnet client will
default to port 23.  (how fitting, that's the "telnet" port!)  Well if you
want to connect to a different port on the same server you can simply type
"telnet somewhere.yermom.com" followed by a space, and port number such as 25
if we wanted to mess around with SMTP.  I don't really want to go into the
"how do i haxor r00t with this inph0?" kind of data in here.  If you are a
true hacker (that is defined as "not a malicous cracking leech giving the
people who know what they are doing a bad name" if you care), you will want
to play with what I have given you.  It isn't really hard to find out what
makes the box in the back office tick once you find open ports (and possibly
a good port scanner is in order...search the net, for there are tons of these
pearls swimming around in the ether out there).  On with the show...

Netstat- This port, if the connection is accepted, will give you multitudes
of information about network connections being made to and from the host.  It
shows where people are coming from, and what is going on on the network in
general.  Be patient with the data here, as it can get very cryptic at times.
try running netstat on any unix machine and looking at the results, if you
can't find a host that supports this externally.

FTP- It's a great thing to be able to snag files off of a remote host.  It is
amazing to me how many hosts allow a user to connect with anonymous FTP, and
allow them to download /etc/passwd...sometimes not even shadowed!  This has
often gotten me that little extra bit of data that I want so that I can finish
off a good hack.  Navigate as much of the system as you can, and look at
ANYTHING you run across that you can get.  This is a HUGE payoff.

Telnet- This is about as close to the front door of a host as you will ever
get without setting foot inside the server room (which would be AWESOME!).
Typically, telnetting to the "Telnet" port gets you some sort of a logon
screen, where you are prompted for a user name and password (hrm I wonder what
THAT can be used for...)  It's almost always the place you make your first
attack, and it's usually also the place you go to do your nasties after you
have some usernames (but not always)

SMTP- This is where we can do some really fun things that aren't that messy.
there are various vulnerabilities in SMTP that allow one to execute arbitrary
commands as if one were root, but I will not get into that.  I think there are
half a quintillion cookbook hacks for this out on the net, but if you aren't
lame, you'll just try to figure it out yerself.  I will however, cover how to
write some pretty kick-ass fake e-mail.

        this requires a "friends" email address, or an enemy, or someone
        you don't know.  Try it on your own email address if you have one,
        just to test it out first.

        1) telnet to a host, and make sure you go to port 25  (telnet host 25)

        2) if you get a message like "220 hostname SMTP Solarisx.x; Wed, 1 Aug
\           1997 10:19" or something like that you are in!

        3) Try this step first: type "MAIL FROM:" and then the e-mail address
           that you want this to look like it's coming from.  It doesn't have
           to be a real E-mail address either!  Just make it something phun.
           (please make sure there is a space between MAIL and TO, but not
           after the :   example MAIL TO:god@heaven.org).

        4) If you get some complaint about no HELO command, type "HELO " and
           then the host you are telnetting from.  if not, go to step 5.

        5) Type "RCPT TO:" and then the email address you want this fake mail
           to go to.  Maybe yours if you are testing it.  Follow the same
           rules as with the MAIL FROM command.

        6) It should say "Sender is Valid" and "Recipient is valid" after you
           do these commands.  if this happens, you are ready to spoof mail!

        7) type "DATA" alone on a line and hit enter.  It'll give you a shpeel
           on how to enter the message.  just remember to hit enter at the end
           of each line and you're okay.  When you are done typing, hit enter,
           type a period (.), and hit enter again.  It will then send the
           e-mail along its way, even if it's on a different host, it will
           eventually find its way.  type "QUIT" to close the connection.

        If you mailed yourself from god or bill gates or something, check your
        mail in 5 minutes or so...there it should be.

Some versions of SMTP allow you to type "VRFY " and a username, to see if
such a user exists on that host.  In example:

VRFY Jsmith
250 <Jsmith@haxord.com>

had Jsmith NOT existed on the system, it would have gone like this:

VRFY Jsmith
550 Jsmith... User unknown

This is a good way to see if a user exists on a system before you attempt to
try cracking their password (like if you found some usernames and no passwords
somewhere and wanted to know if maybe those users existed on this specific
system.) This brings us to our next phun port...

Finger- this is very similar.  it is often used for gathering names of users
on a remote host.  By opening this port and hitting enter, if finger is
enabled, you get a list of who is logged on, and some other stats about their
connection.  If you type in a user's name after you connect to port 79, and
then hit enter, if the username is valid and finger is supported on the host,
you get some more detailed info on them, including a plan and project, if they
created one.  This is fairly self explanatory.  Rumor has it, that as well,
with a finger connection, by confusing the fingerd (daemon) program, it is
also possible to execute commands as root.  I'm only working on some of the
lighter duty aspects of hacking.  Like I said earlier, figure it out.


Some extra stuff:

some of you may wonder why i don't openly publish cookbook hacks for how to
swipe root access out from under the nose of unwary sysadmins.  This is a
simple answer.  if you spend a ton of time figuring it out, you will be more
careful with using it, knowing that if it is abused and the admin knows about
it, it will be fixed.  In order to keep all these hacker wanna-be's out of the
way, i figure I'll just let people know what all's out there, and if they want
to spend time messing with it, they will learn more and be careful.  I've been
on both sides of the security issue, and I love a nice equilibrium between the
two sides.

        Shoutouts to the coderz at Studio 3DO who participated in the making
of what I believe is one of the best programs written for the die-hard data
freaks out there (more specifically, those who love to screw around in hex
editors, looking through saved games to try to "transcend" the rules of the
game).  A retail store I worked at was given a demo copy of Game Guru.  My
boss told me to just go ahead and keep it, and tell him what exactly it was.
He read the box, and it looked like something a hacker-type would like.
Just reading the package, it seemed almost cheesy.  I was unsure how a box
with a single floppy and a scant 20-page manual would achieve all of the
results that were flaunted in the product description.  But indeed I know that
coderz can work miracles, so I gave it a shot.

        I took it home and installed it on my laptop.  I wanted to see what
all it would do for Duke Nukem 3D, which was about the only game I had
installed on my laptop at the time (before I got an external CD Drive).  When
I pulled it up, I was asked to "remove the disk, and un-write-protect it."
It was strange.  I've never seen an install disk that needed to write to its
own disk.  Creepy.  It installed fine after that.  It runs in 4GW protected
mode.  Rather mundane.  When I ran it, I was shocked with a really kick-ass
graphic of some sort of virtual game-buddha sort of character.  There was
even a list of dozens upon dozens of games, and several codes for them.
There were a ton of them for my Duke3D.

        As I read through the instruction manual (Oh yes, I read the manuals
after i install the software.  I make a religion of it, but i wished I hadn't
practiced this on this occasion.  It turns out that this software could only
be installed three times, then, the disk would be useless, much akin to AOL
dikettes that are mas mailed to our doorsteps to prevent us from needing to
purchase the media ourselves.  Then it struck me.  This thing was WRITTEN by
hackers, for hackers.  Of COURSE!  So I played.  I ran a DISKCOPY of the
install disk.  Nada.  Would not install.  It needed "the ORIGINAL Game Guru
Install Disk" and wanted me to feed the Floppy drive the genuine disk.  I
zipped up the installed version, and copied it to a 486 i had.  After I
uncompressed it on the 486, and attempted to run it, it asked me to install
it from the install disk, because it wasn't originally installed on that hard
drive, but another.  I was truly puzzled.  Truly, a work by hackers, for
hackers, just like the manual said.

        ...and so i hacked...

        What did i find?  I decided to go with my diskcopy theory.  when a
diskcopy is run, it literally lays everything, or so i thought...Sector by
sector, the same.  What in the world was it forgetting to copy.  Obviousely,
the writers of Game Guru knew that something wasn't copied with DiskCopy,
which I'm sure would be one of the most obvious choices for copying a single
disk install.  I wanted to know what it wasn't copying.  I made 3 diskcopies
of the install, none of which installed (surprise, surprise).  I pulled up a
copy of PC-Tools by Central Point, which is a must for most hackers that rely
on power tools for the PC.  It shows all kinds of stuff on the disk, even FAT
layout, serial number, and header info.

(I found out the serial number, which can be seen with a dos DIR command, is
actually reversed.  It's in hex.  If the Serial number shows up in DIR as
"5F31-8E4F" it will be in hex on the disk as the characters "O0_" which is
in hex "4F 8E 31 5F", exactly reversed from the serial number.  As you can
tell, I tried changing the serial number of the disk to match that of the
install disk.  No go.  (I did learn that trick about the serial number though.
I didn't know that until this project.)  This is when I used the header
viewer.  The OEM ID feild of the illegitimate floppy read "WIN4.0" or
something like that, because the floppy was formatted on a windows 95 machine,
my laptop.  Strangely enough, the header veiw of the true install floppy
revealed that the OEM ID was garbled...horribly so.  It was a mass of strange
characters, I cant remember which characters.  I did this hack nearly a year
ago.

        This Really should be done with Central Point's PC tools.  Norton
Just doesn't cut it.  The industry standard requires the OEM ID feild on the
diskette to be in ALL CAPS.  Norton wouldn't let me enter a letter lowercase,
and wouldn't let me insert any higher ascii characters either.  Please for the
love of hacking use PC Tools.  It rawx.  View the OEM ID of your Game Guru
disk (which can be purchased for 9 bux or so), and jot it down.  Then, all you
do is diskcopy the install, and edit the Fake install's header to make the
OEM ID read the same as the original install.  Voila!  You just hacked Game
Guru.  Now...you know a TON about Copy protection, as this was one of the most
challenging schemes I have gone up against.  I wanted a copy because Floppy
disks shelf lives just suck.  There should be no reason I coudln't make a
backup. I bought it, and learned a lot while trying to hack it.  It is not
often that one can hack a program that will help you hack.

        When you first run Game Guru, Go to the "Edit Settings" Menu, and
activate everything cool.  There are quite a few things there to play with.
Advanced mode is a must.  This opens up options for a very powerful hex-editor
to your disposal, as well as a few other things.  The HEx editor has a dual
window display.  If you load up two files that are the same size in either
window, you can compare them.  This works well for saved-game files.  It will
even suggest what possible values the changes represent.  If you like to hex
out BBS software, like Renegade, you can save the original, and then hex edit
a copy of the original, reviewing EVERY difference in the two files at any
time.  If you open an executable in the hex editor, you can launch an edited
version from within Guru, without saving the file itself.  If the edit works
the way you want, save it.  if not, you don't need to worry, just exit the
editor.

        Anyone who has ever messed around with saved-game files also knows
that sometimes the programmers make Checksums part of the file.  This is a
very annoying practice, for when you edit the saved game file, the game will
freak out and say that the file is corrupted, so it's erased...with your hard
work inside it, as well.  Game Guru contains a really great CRC Calculator.

        When you add these great hacking features, with the ability to add
special game guru patches to games, (patch codes available all over the net),
and the "Knowledge base", a list of cheat codes.  The Game Guru File List
feature doesn't care about hidden files.  They are openly readable, and
writable, as well, as long as the other file attributes allow such.

        If some of the other many uses for this program are not already
beginning to form inmm your heads, you may not be able to justify buying this
program.  If so, go get it.  Search for it on the web if you can't find it in
stores.  There is a free version (it looks like game guru but doesn't really
do much of anything.  I think you may be able to get it from Studio3DO direct,
if you can't get it anywhere else.

        This has pretty much covered the ins and outs of Game Guru.  How to
hack it, how to hack WITH it.   It is a good quality program, and i hope that
these methods of hacking are not used for Piracy, which I do not condone in
any way.  I do encourage the technique described here, in order to make a
backup of the install, because if my drive crashed, I would probably die if
I couldn't use it again.  HAppI HAqN!

        This is a new section that we are incorporating, starting this issue.
No, Hacker Newz was not in the first issue, but we hope to continue the newz
in furure issues.  Some obvious news with the HiR crew, is the addition of
two new members!  Yes, TG SNooP and Dr. Freeze have jumped in to save Axon
the task of writing the whole thing himself.  <Wild Applause>  However, due
to some problems, such as a now-formatted hard drive, (no thanks to the powers
that be) Dr. Freeze couldn't quite get his articles in, but he's got some
good stuff for HiR 3.  On a much happier note, TG SNooP just got a brand-new
box up and running (replacing his 386, thank god).

Top 10 weird things found in the trash by HiR members since the last issue:

        A List of all vehicles, including price, assigned driver, and VIN
          that are currently owned by one kansas city SWB office.

        Landscaping plans for 2 Bell offices, one in Kansas City, the other,
          somewhere in nevada or something.

        Huge list of pager numbers and PINs for some Southwestern Bell people.

        A lawn sprinkler timer schedule.  

        Estimating Department Quote Schedule

        December 1997 calendar showing the employee review schedule.

        A paper showing 2 different ways to pull a huge concrete slab out
          of the ground, and the price differences ($82,000-95,000 ???)

        Standard Crew pay rates for 1997, various positions.

        A quote sheet for a project called "One Fountain Square".  Got me.

        A moldy burrito (half eaten...or decayed).


WOW!  That's newz!  We found some other mundane things in the garbage as well
but these were just the weird ones.  Check out the HiR Distribution web page
at     students.johnco.cc.ks.us/~axon2017/hir.html    Take a look on Dec. 1st,
the planned release date for HiR 3.  Hopefully the site will have a few links
and extra files just for fun.
