HiR is an electronic publication that is written by real hackers and phone
phreaks that have the desire to share information.  We only publish articles
related to hacking and phreaking.  We don't cover viruses, stealing, carding,
or blowing things up.  

As a general rule, we don't do many walk-thru's; occasionally we might, 
but we almost always focus more on explaining a given aspect in enough 
depth to help the reader understand why things happen.  With that 
information, they may learn for themselves and discover many other 
things related to the article.

We are always looking for new writers.  If you are (or were) in the H/P
scene, and consider yourself a decent writer, send us some of your work.
Our e-mail is h_i_r@hotmail.com.

HIR now has a much easier to remember URL, thanks to Monolith Internet.  It's
just an http redirect, (so the old URL still works) but if we end up shifting
the mag to another server ever again, this virtual domain name will redirect
you to the new site (since we have the power to modify the target URL).
The shorter url is: http://hir.home.ml.org.  Note that you will be redirected
to the old address transparently.  This is not abnormal. 

Along with the new site, we also have added a links and files page.  If we
mention any good sites in the mag, you'll probably find a link on the links
and files page.  There is a subtle link on our main page, but if you like
to have URLs, it's at http://hir.home.ml.org/hirlinks.html.
We will also put some useful shareware and freeware files on the page. Also
we add just plain cool sites, which may be overt hacking related sites, or
sites that are related to the general hacking subculture (Jolt Cola, etc.)

You can find us at the following places (that we know of):

Official HiR Distro Site Virtual Domain URL:           http://hir.home.ml.org 
Official Southwestern U.S. Mirror site:     http://azure.rcn.nmt.edu:2007/HiR

Useful URL's:

     o FTPSearch (http://ftpsearch.ntnu.no)
         Ftpsearch is a great internet resource to use.  It is extremely
         flexible, and makes no sacrifices when it comes to power.  If you
         have ever used the "advanced mode" of most internet search engines
         (Like Yahoo or Excite), then this page will look fairly mundane.
         for others, it's kind of confusing at first, but it eventually
         makes sense.  Axon showed this gem to Asmodian X one day, and he's
         used some of axon's ideas blended with quite a few of his own, and
         wrote an article that will appear later in this issue.  It's a
         must-read.

     o HTML edition of The New Hackers Dictionary 
       (http://www.earthspace.net/jargon/)
         If any of you have ever read "The New Hackers Dictionary", it is
         a book that is taken up mostly by entries of the "Hacker Jargon
         File", but also contained within its pages is a healthy amount
         of information that would help anyone better understand hackers
         (such as the "Portrait of J. Random Hacker", and some of the
         grammar usage notes).  This is a site containing the ENTIRE book
         in HTML format, and you can jump to any part of it through the
         table of contents.  (Also if you have a favorite word in the
         jargon section, each word has a tag, so you can link to a single
         word, not just the page of words starting with "H").  Very good!

Books worth reading:

         o Pages: 350
         o Price: Around 25 bucks.
         o Overview:
           This is THE book to read if you are at all interested in the
           mysterious Registry.  The information inside can bring a novice
           up to speed in no time, and give the power-user (that's me) an-
           other fun toy to mess with.  This book brings to light many
           helpful registry issues such as security, user preferences, and
           other handy stuff.  This book was one of 5 books read in order
           to prepare Axon to write the windows 95 article (later in this
           issue).  Not only was it the best of the 5, it was good enough
           for Axon to BUY (instead of hanging out in a bookstore for hours
           on end, reading it and putting it back, like some books).  This
           book is not recommended reading for newbies, though.  Some of
           the stunts they pull require some decent (intimate?) knowledge
           of how windows handles things...                                            -=- A Tell Tale of the FTP Search Tool -=-
                                  HIR 6 - 3 

A Short Overview of the FTP search service.
By Asmodian X

        A while back Axon and my self triped upon a wonderful ftp search
utility, aptly named "FTP SEARCH," that allowd our wandering eyes to search
vast numbers of public ftp servers.At a point, for some "Unknown" reason, we
felt a bit prankish, and searched for some really stupid stuff like..
passwd, .rhosts and some other nifty things like that.  The FTP search 
engine dutifully obeyed our requests, and gave us a really nice, really
long, list of hosts, full pathname to the files, and their permissions. 
As a credit to the standards of computer security, all the files we 
found were permissioned to not allow any old user to read them..  
However this service could provide invaluable information about 
individual systems as a whole.

        The "FTP search," page is at "http://ftpsearch.ntnu.no" for 
those of you itching to try it.  Not only can you tell it to bluntly search
everything. But you can set up sorting parameters.  Such as domain, paths,
and you can tell it to hide certain types of files, such as software 
packages...etc.  It may be an interesting test to see how much you can 
learn about your self using this useful search tool.  

        One interesting note however, this search tool only has a snapshot of
what a server has available on a anonymous ftp session.    The really secure
servers will have already removed themselves from the ftp database or have
made a ls-l R.gz, which the ftp-tool updates itself off of. The ls-lR.gz file
will be readinto the database insted of making a recursive directory scan.
Thus the sysadmin can block out whatever directorys they wish, and the ftp
search database will never know any different.
        
        If you have the burning desire for your internet ftp server be
removed from "FTP search", send an email from your server to
"remove@ftpsearch.ntnu.no"

      [the official toy of the modern Phone Phreak: The Cellular Phone]
              [This article covers mostly Motorola Cellular]

This is the first article of HIR completely devoted to all that funky cellular
stuff.  As you may recall, in HiR 3 we mentioned that we found a really kick-
ass course guide used for employee training with motorola phones. This article
is the first fruit of the knowledge contained within that book's old tattered
pages.  I've sort of divided this article into two sections: 

 I. A flowchart of the chain of events that happen inside a cellular phone
II. user- and test-mode cellular programming introduction

On with the show!

I. Cellular telephone chain of events

Sometimes it's nice to know what exactly is going on inside something.  Maybe
you want to troubleshoot it.  Maybe you just want to be reassured that every-
thing isn't just being powered by rubber bands and springs. Who knows. 
Regardless, I've finally found a flowchart that describes in detail every
action that a cellular phone takes after you power it up.  The flow chart
does NOT cover what happens once you make or receive a call, however.


 1. Power button pressed.  Self Test Occurs.  NoSvc indicator activated.
 2. Scan preferred system (A or B).
 3. Scan all 21 control channels for that system.
 4. Use strongest control channel.
 5. If Overhead information is received and decoded, jump to step 8.
 6. Tune to second strongest control channel.
 7. If overhead info still cannot be recieve d or decoded, jump to step 12. *
 8. If the system ID matches the cell phone's home SID, jump to step 10.
 9. Activate Roam indicator.
10. Turn off NoSvc indicator.
11. Rescan after 5 minutes (Jump to step 2)
12. Turn on NoSvc Indicator.
13. Switch to non-preferred system (A or B), then jump to step 3.

* In most phones, only the 2 strongest control channels are scanned, but some
  phones scan more than 2.

II. Introduction to user- and test-mode programming on motorola cell phones

There are 2 types of programming on motorola phones.  The easiest of the two
is called user mode programming.  This method also goes by the name "security
code programming", because there is a security code that is used when
entering programming mode.  Once in this mode, it is possible to change the
security code, which is 6 digits long.  After that, the old security code 
will no longer let you in to user mode programming.  Take note that there is
never a need for any special equipment here, as long as all the keys on the
keypad work normally. 

The other method is called test mode programming.  There is never a way to
get into test mode with the keypad alone.  Sometimes it takes a whole desktop
system with special interface cables and custom software, but in some cases,
it's quite a bit easier than that, and can be done with nothing more than a
little piece of aluminum foil or a pair of needle-nose pliers.

I will only cover User-Mode programming in this article, but in HiR 7 I'll
expose some ways of getting into Test Mode, and compare the features that
make each programming mode diverse.  Some (but far from all) actual
programming operations will be covered in depth, but since I myself have not
messed with actual programming to much extent, all that i can provide is
what I've done.  I will descibe each memory location, and the function of
each bit or byte, though.

Getting into User programming mode:

This varies quite a bit from model to model.  When it comes to motorola
phones, there are 6 main user-mode entry sequences.  Some phones may not
allow user-mode programming, and a very small group of phones have another
way of accessing user-mode programming which is more complex than I wish to
cover here.  Below is a table of the 6 user-mode entry key sequences.  Then
there will be another table of which handsets use which of the 6 sequences
to get into user-mode programming.  Wherever %CODE% shows up in the sequence,
you'll have to enter the 6-digit security code twice.  By default, the
security code is 000000.  So, where %CODE% shows up, you would want to try
000000000000 first, unless you know the security code is something else.
if the security code was 852030, then where %CODE% is, you would need to enter
852030852030.  Simple enough?  Just remember to enter the security code twice.

Once in User-Mode Programming, you can do quite a bit, but not quite enough
to satisfy the desires of most phreaks.  I'll show you what each value in
user-mode programming means, and I'll focus on the ones I am familiar with
(remember, I'm not a HUGE cell phreak, I just study it occasionally).
If you modify the phone number, an internal counter dubbed the "3-Times"
counter, will increment by 1.  Once it hits 3, the cellular phone goes nuts
and will not operate.  According to the manual, you're supposed to turn it
in to a cellular technician who will then ask why the phone number got
changed so many times...heh...Well all they have to do is enter test mode,
and modify the counter (Reset it).  Of course if you can weasel your way
into test mode, you should be fine.  =]

Pressing the * key steps through each entry in sequence.
Pressing CLR returns the current data field to the previous value.
Pressing # will exit the program without saving any changes.  This does not
   have any affect on the "3-times" counter.
Pressing the SND key while entering data has no effect.
Pressing the SND key while on an entry field will save the data.  If the
telephone number was changed, the "3-times" counter will increment.

Entry   Default   Description
 01      00000     System ID.  This is the system ID of your cellular
                   carrier.
 02      111       Cellular Area Code.
 03      1110111   Cellular Telephone Number.
 04      XX        Station Class Mark.  Varies according to channel access,
                   VOX capability and power out.  You probably will never
                   have a need to mess with this one.
 05      00        Access Overload Class.  Level of priority for accessing
                   the system in case of a system overload.
 06      00        Group ID Mark.  Specifies how many of the SID bits are
                   significant.
 07      000000    User Security Code.  Code used in accessing user-mode
                   programming features.  Also used for changing the un-
                   lock code.
 08      123       Unlock Code.  Supplied by the user to allow only those
                   people who know the code to use the phone.
 09      0334      Initial Paging Channel.  0333 for side A SID's,
                   0334 for side B SID's.
 10      011100    Option Programming.  These are toggle bits, read from
                   Left to right:
                   1. Internal Speaker disable. Disables the Handset call
                      processing speaker if using an external speaker.
                      0=Internal Speaker on, 1=Internal Speaker Disabled.
                   2. Local use.  If set to 1, the phone responds to local
                      control orders when the group id is matched.
                   3. MIN Mark. If set to 1, area code is transmitted on
                      every call.
                   4. Auto Recall.  1 enables access to phone numbers
                      stored in memory locations.  0 disables access.
                   5. Second Telephone Number Enable.  Allows entry of
                      telephone data into Second NAM (or into programming
                      memory if the phone does not support second NAM)
                   6. Diversity. If the dual-antenna feature is present,
                      and you want to enable the diversity feature (use
                      both antennae).  1=Enabled, 0=Disabled.
 11      11110     Option Programming 2. This set of option bits is only
                   available on phones with software version 8735 or
                   later (Phones with 832 channels).  Some phones only
                   have 3 or 4 bits instead of 5.  These will always be
                   the rightermost 3 or 4 bits (the last 3 or 4 of this
                   table, Failed Page and Enhanced Scan may not be pres-
                   ent in every phone).
                   1. Failed Page Indicator.  Informs the user of any 
                      in-bound call attempt that failed (typically due
                      to a weak signal) if set to 1.
                   2. Motorola Enhanced Scan.  Newer high-perfomance
                      scanning technique is utilized where multiple
                      signalling channels are present if this bit is
                      set to 1.  Motorola started implementing this
                      feature in mid '91.  Phones produced before
                      this time do not have this feature.
                   3. Long tone DTMF.  If set to 1, the DTMF tones
                      are transmitted long enough to make it easier
                      for certain DTMF-Sensing equipment to pick up
                      the tones.  This helps when trying to access
                      voice mail or automated phone menus from a
                      cellphone.
                   4. Transportable Internal Ringer/Speaker.
                      0=Audio routed to external seaker of "Tough
                      Talker" or Carry Phone.  1=Audio routed to the
                      handset speaker.
                   5. Eight Hour Timeout.  If phone remains inactive
                      for 8 hours straight, it automatically turns
                      off.  This is mainly for carphones, to keep
                      them from totally draining your car battery.

If the Second Telephone bit was enabled, the whole process will
start over again, except with a "2" to the right of the entry 
number.  Entries 7, 8, and 11 are not repeated.

Keep a lookout for info on getting into test-mode programming, where
the REAL fun begins.  It should be ready by HiR7, but I want to make
sure there's concrete info.                                                                                                          m o b i l e   h a c k i n g   p a r t   d e u x . 
                        equipment, manners and etc. 

                               by Asmodian X

     Hacking is a risky sport at best.  When in the field, it's best to
look like you're supposed to be there, or better yet, looking like you're
not there at all. 

You can achieve this in several ways, some of which are:

o costuming 
o camouflage 
o equipment 
o background 
o social engineering  

I can not cover everything, because what you need will vary drastically as
per situation.  Some examples of poor preparation are... 

scenario 1:  
     An employee of wally-mart exits her store at about 10:30pm. She hears
some loud whooping, and sees several teenagers all dressed in black.  The
teenagers all hop over a wall into a cell phone company's trash bins. 
They continue the commotion and then leave the bins <thoroughly trashed>
and haul away their spoils.  Afterwhich they peel out and leave the area. 

Our person here is left with several options,
A. call the police and report a disturbance/trespassing.
B. Go home with the incident on their conscience.
C. Scream "AHHH! HACKERS!!" really loud and faint.

They will probably do A and C.  chances are that spot is un-trashable for
the duration of the store's management cycle, until new management comes
in and wonders why they have armed guards guarding the garbage... 

Some of the things that could be avoided were: Time period, Conduct, gear,

and location. 

* Part 1 * Timing
     Always survey your destination ahead of time, find out the hours of
operation of the destination.  Businesses are likely to have professional
cleaning services after hours.  Find the location of your desired target
<ie. dumpsters, bell cans, etc.>, and assess any possible security
measures of the surrounding area.  Stop by one night and see if there's
night security on days and weekends.  Take note of surrounding areas, fast
food restaurants will not be vacated until after midnight usually.  Retail
will close at 8-10pm and will be vacated by 11 usually. Cafe's and
specialty stores my vary.  Some stores never close.  <ie. Denny's>

     So your ideal time is about 11:30pm to 3am in the way of timing.
Although the police will be patrolling during those times, some say 4 to 5
am, but morning crews tend be more active then.  So use your best
judgment.

* Part 2 * Conduct
     Attracting attention to your self is generally not a good idea in
hacking, so its important to blend in.  Don't wear clothing that stands
out, such as bright colors, odd styles such as tie dye...etc Look like
everybody else.  Generally favor darker colors for clothing, DO NOT USE
ALL BLACK.  The important thing is to look and act like your just out for
a midnight walk.  It's also important to have the same reason for being
there as the guy standing next to you.  If some one asks and there's a
difference in everyone's alibi, then y ou're in trouble.  Another item to
be aware of is shoes, tennis shoes are not a good idea, wear something
like thick soled boots or some hightops with thick soles, jeans or a good
idea as well, trashing some times can be dangerous if there are sharp obje
cts in the bin with you, be careful! 


Above all else, LEAVE THINGS THE WAY YOU FOUND THEM!


scenario 2: 

Jim: Well officer me and fred and timmy over there were just out on a walk
and we ... 

Fred: Well me Jim and timmy over there were on our way home from a party
over on west street. 

Timmy: I was walking back to Fred's house after we checked out some one I
knew at that coffee shop over there.

Busted...

*The right equipment*

There are several situations that you may or may not face.  
o Surveillance
o Gathering 
o Mobile light weight, hit and run 
o heavy base station

(surveillance)
     Generally you will want very few items on you, hauling a laptop
extension cords...etc tends to make you look suspicious.  Just wear
something casual, maybe a polo-shirt, with some jeans. Don't look like a
punk, or a freak, look clean cut.  If checkin g out what a place does,
pose as a customer <if applicable> or a tourist <when applicable> and
generally you want to take everything at leisure.  Your equipment should
simply be cash, only what you need to prove you are who you say you are
<you probably better off going on foot and not bring ID's>, a small pocket

flash light, maybe a small camera < if necesessary>, a small pocket knife,
pen, and a notepad, Only 3 or 4 things.  If you only have jeans on, just
bring a small pocket knife, and a notepad and pen.  Don't have bulging
pockets that also looks suspicious.  Avoid going in a group, side remarks
to your cohorts are some what suspici ous. 

     If surveying from afar, avoid the classic "park the car across from
where the place is" routine, Umm Gee boss are we being watched? Look like
you're supposed to be there, park farther away if necessary in a less
conspicuous setting and use binoculars
 if necessary.

(Gathering)
     It is important to rehearse the gathering session ahead of time with
your cohorts.  Go over your <alibi(s)> and if everything goes bad what to
do.  Your gear should be able to be concealed in an overcoat. Clothing
should be comparable to your setting , and alibi.  During night time
operations use darker colored clothing and avoid bulky<loud> equipment. 
<if you have a large keychain, detatch only what keys you need, and leave
the rest>.  Bring the only ID's you need, if on location, leave real id's
behind at home or in the car <somewhere>.  Also pay attention to your
footwear, don't wear your bright white nike hightops, bring running shoes,
or something that ma tches the terrain, boots for poor terrain ...etc.

     The equipment you will probably need will be a small pen light <or
one of those Mini Mag lights> or a clip on light. What ever works, it must
be small and fit into your pocket with ease.  Good pair of leather gloves
or rubber gloves, its important to
 get a good grip w. the gloves with out cutting the finger tips off. ie.
finger prints.  If your going to be hauling papers or stuff in general,
have a cloth sack with you.. something stuffable, like into a pocket. 
Paper and plastic sacks make WAY too much noise.  A small pocket knife and
what ever tools you need must also be pocket-sized.  Metal tools make
clanking noises, so wrap them separately from each other.  Or cover them
with foam tape or electrical tape to reduce the noise.  Be sure to have
closeable pockets ..ie. Zippers and buttons, so when running nothing
bounces o ut.
        
(Light weight Hit and Run)

     A light weight hit in run will be a will be just as rehearsed as the
pervious two types of actions.  Same scenario, ie. clothing types
stories...etc.  You will be using items that can be fit into a backpack.
Items such as small laptop and or palmtop with necessary tools for your
goal.  Avoid stuffing a backpack full with books and stuff.  Just the bare
essentials to get things done.  Around no more than 8 pounds of equipment
should be put into a backpack.  Anything above that will affect stamina
and running speed, though if you are physically fit, more weight would be
acceptable.  Items to be considered would be a Clip on flashlight, with a
laptop or a palmtop a person would have their hands busy with the computer
and not have time for fiddling with a flashlight.  Also consider using a
red lens with a flashlight, it will not affect your night vision as much. 
I must stress that you have very little equipment, because there is less
to toss in the backpack and haul ass with.

(Heavy Base station)

     You will only want to use a base station setup if you have access to
a private area with hook ups for utilities, possibly a telephone, power
and air-conditioning with shelter.  It is also preferable to not be in
plain sight (i.e. some utility room, o r closet).  A base station is a
mobile <luggable> setup that can easily be scraped down in a short time,
and carried <lugged> away.  An example is Kevin Mitnicks car setup..  He
found a remote location, had a car battery hookup for a Pentium 90 desktop
sy stem.  complete with cell-modem.  With a base station setup, a person
could set up a quick and dirty Dialup server for others to use. Even a CB
relay setup could be feasible. 

     A person would want to use a laptop or some other IBM PC based all in
one unit.  Palmtops or Macintoshes are not very flexible unless it can run
Linux or some other REAL operating system.  DESKTOPS are only to be used
if you absolutely need the most capacity possible, ie. for like multiple
modems, special devices...etc.  In all situations it is preferable to
gather what you need, and then digest it later.  The goal of the base
station is to have an independent computing center that is self sufficient
but can tap into external resou rces when available.

     In the way of personnel, 3 people is about all you can get away with,
any more than that would be un-necessary chatter.  A person could push it
and bring more than that if in a remote enough area, and there were no
danger of passer by's being attract ed by the noise.  Posting a lookout
with a handheld CB-radios, Family band radios or long range walkie-talkies
may also be a good idea. 


*LOCATION*
     Some places just are not worth going to, to do dirty work.  If there
are security guards, lots of lights and a fairly busy surroundings, it
would be wise to look at other ways of obtaining information.  When
surveying a spot, also take note of meetin g places, like a denny's down
the road, or the quickie mart across the street.  If anything goes wrong
have a set meeting place to regroup at.  <also, depending on how bad
things get, you may want to set a period of time where no one may
associate with each other, anything over 8 weeks is generally a good idea.
<but it really depends on how bad things get, 2 weeks may work just as
well>.  The meeting spot must be in running distance, and far enough away
from your site so that to not attract any attention.  The location must
have food, warmth and must be secure.  Talk to your cohorts outside and
away from listening ears. calm down out side and catch your breath before
entering, and try to look normal.

                    Tools of the trade: The disk o' death
                                   by Axon

A disk of death?  No, we are not speaking of cheapo cardboard-crust pizza.
I have always carried one or more disks of death on me since I came up with 
the idea.  So what's ON a disk of death?  How'd it come to earn such a name?
Soon you will know.

Creating your disk(s)of death:
------------------------------

A disk of death contains software tools and possibly text files that will
help you in a given situation.  Basically it's a 3.5" x 3.75" x .2" tool-
box, filled to maximum capacity with toys, programs, and othet stuff.
The disk of death acquired its name when I formatted a diskette that
contained the ANTICMOS Virus.  Someone wrote on the disk: "DEATH TO HE
THAT PUTS THIS IN A COMPUTER!"  After formatting it, I threw a hex editor
and saber onto it.  It eventually got more and more toys.  It eventually
bit the dust (started getting errors and stuff, totally corrupted), 
so I put the same toys on a fresh disk, and wrote on it: "Axon's Evil
Disk o' Death".

What toys should you include?  That's entirely up to you.  The disk of
death that I use most often contains lots of fun stuff to mess with 
windows 95 (specifically the machines at my old high school and others
where where people have tried to secure the system).  This is what my
Win95 disk o' death  contains:

 o The disk is a Windows 95 Formatted Bootable disk
 o A self-extracting pre-configured version of WinTD (See HiR 3, also, WinTD
   is available not on the HiR Links and Files page)
 o A copy of Regedit.exe (Registry Editor)
 o A hand-made registry patch file that unlocks most security settings that
   are stored in the registry (restrict on command.com,  printers, 
   configuration, network stuff, etc.  Read the Windows article later this
   issue.  It will help you create one of these)
 o Saber, a great tool to directly read what's in memory 
 o Hacker View (hiew.exe.  My favorite dos-based hex/text editor, available
   on the HiR Links and files page)
 o An OLE-Enriched wordpad document (See Windows Holes in this issue)
 o A batch file that renames all files on my disk to strange names with
   .dat extensions, then deletes them (and itself) 
 o Password Thief (Passthie.exe, as well as a usage tutorial are available
   on the files/links page at the HiR site), a program that can find out 
   what those silly asterisks (saved passwords, etc) in a text box REALLY
   mean...
 o Hide-It, a simple program that uses the Windows API to cloak a running
   program.  Also available on the HiR page.  Drawback: it sets up a system
   tray icon.  sigh.
 o Windows PS and KILL.  Gives you a nice "UNIX" feel, lets you kill off
   specific threads, not just a program.  MUCH better than Windows' little
   Control-Alt-Delete menu.  Also on the site.
 o ClearURL, a program I wrote that clears the URL list in the Location bar
   in Netscape Communicator.  (Still being updated.  New updates will be
   available on the page.)

The registry patch probably will work anywhere that someone had fun
with the registry to make things more secure.  My wordpad document
has a OLE link to the registry file. This is because often times I
cannot open the disk from the desktop, but i can open the document
with wordpad or Word 97 (the computers allowed people to save and
open documents to type and print them).  I just used OLE to create
links to executables and other data files.  If you aren't quite fam-
iliar with OLE or the registry read the Article on windows that
appears later in this issue.

For the old machines still running DOS I have a DOS Disk o' Death:

 o Formatted with DOS 6.22 as a bootable diskette.
 o Hacker View (for text/hex editing)
 o Central Point's KILL utility
 o A TSR keystroke logger
 o TSR Basic (For creating a dirty, memory hungry TSR on the fly)
 o The DOS Intersvr programs (fast file transfers between 2 systems,
   laptop, other desktop, etc)
 o BC.EXE, LINK.EXE, and some of the other files that are necessary 
   for compiling QuickBasic source code in a pinch.

I'm always coming up with new toys for different environments.  The
ability to scrub the really incriminating stuff is somewhat import-
ant, but not a necesity.  Come up with lots of fun stuff to use.

toys, visit the HiR Links and files page at:

                                                                       HiR 6
              Windows 95: User Friendly means Hacker Friendly
                                   by Axon

Everyone knows that Windows 95 is extremely insecure.  I would argue that if
you're going to plop Windows 95 on a machine in a public place, you might as
well put a sticky note on the monitor that proclaims "Hack Me!".  From the
very genesis of Windows, it's been a huge hacker target.  Microsoft has tried
their damnedest to make it more secure, but even with the way Windows can use 
the "magic" registry mechanism for "security", there are still many holes
that need help.  Even the registry has its holes.  In this article, I'll
discuss several of the little inner workings that lie under the "gee whiz"
graphical loser interface that Bill stole from other companies anyway. 

In short: Many things that add power or ease of use to Windows will also
decrease privacy and security:

       b. Registry keys that are used for security

Closing Remarks on Windows 95 Security

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In long:  I'll expand on that outline, but keep its structure.

I.  The registry

     The registry is a good idea.  It does everything from getting rid of the
     need for .INI files for Windows programs, to keeping track of what 
     applications should be used for each file extension type (which was its
     only function in Windows 3.x).  In windows 95 and NT, it's even an okay
     security mechanism.  If you find this section interesting, then I'd
     suggest checking out Appendix A of this article, "Advanced Registry Fun"
     which covers more complex registry toys.  Note: Due to the power that is
     held within the registry, I am telling you now: "Back up your registry
     before you play with it, EACH AND EVERY TIME YOU PLAY WITH IT!!!"  This
     is easily accomplished by running Regedit.exe, and selecting the file
     menu, and exporting your registry file.  I usually save it with the
     date, such as 6-3-98.reg.  if your registry gets messed up, it is easy
     to blow away and restore it with this backup.  Also, looking at this
     backup with a text editor will show you a great example of a huge
     registry patch file (see below).

  a. Why the registry is good for security
     It would seem like the ideal way to enforce security permissions: Alter 
     the registry so that it no longer allows certain things to be done 
     anymore, and then, throw in a registry value that keeps the user from
     running the registry editor.

  b. A registry patch file is one of several ways to make "Cookie-Cutter"
     changes to the registry (I will cover a more advanced method of creating
     registry-editing files, .INF files) in Appendix A, Advanced Registry 
     Fun).  The first line of any registry patch file is "REGEDIT4".  The 
     keys are stored in registry patch files in the following format:
--
REGEDIT4

      [HKEY_...\PATH\WITHIN\REGISTRY\TREE\TO\KEY1]
      
      "NameOfKey1Value1"=dword:xxxxxxxx    (Hexadecimal)
     
      [HKEY_...\PATH\WITHIN\REGISTRY\TREE\TO\KEY2]

      "NameOfKey2Value1"="blahblah"        (String value, text)
      "NameOfKey2Value2"=dword:xxxxxxxx    (Hexadecimal)
      "NameOfKey2Value3"=hex:ff,00,20,1c...(Hexadecimal Bytes)
      "NameOfKey2Value4"=dword:xxxxxxxx    (Hexadecimal)
      "NameOfKey2Value5"=dword:xxxxxxxx    (Hexadecimal)
 
--
     You get the picture...

     Here are some of the registry keys and values used for security. These
     values are mostly policy values.  I will explain a LOT more on policies
     at the end of this article. (values are all DWord.) 00000000 is 
     basically a "No" and 00000001 is basically a "Yes" for these values. 
     This is not true with ALL the values in the registry! This is true with
     the values listed here, though.  All of the following values are DWORDs,
     not Hex or String. 
     
     You can probably figure out what most (or some) of these values do:
     I'll explain some archaic values in ()'s next to the value.

     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies
         \Explorer
            * NoAddPrinter
            * NoDeletePrinter
            * NoSaveSettings
            * NoRun ("Run" item doesn't show up in Start Menu if 00000001)

     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies
         \Network
            * NoNetSetup (Won't let ya use "Network" from control panel)
            * NoFileSharingControl
            * NoPrintSharingControl
            * NoEntireNetwork (Can't see entire network on Net 'hood)
            * DisablePwdCaching (stuff you type in Run doesn't stay in the
                                 list box below.)

     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies
         \System (Stuff under System/Display Properties Control panels)
            * NoDispCPL
            * NoDispScrSavPage
            * NoDispSettingsPage
            * NoSecCPL
            * NoDevMgrPage
            * NoConfigPage
            * NoFileSysPage
            * NoVirtMemPage
            * DisableRegistryTools (Keeps regedit from being run...kinda)

  c. Why the registry's security features mean nothing.
     The registry editor might not allow you to open it and screw with the
     underlying registry (thanks to the DisableRegistryTools value) but the
     funny thing is that you can create registry patches (using the format I
     described above) and name them with a .REG extension.  If you double
     click on a .REG file, the registry editor reads the registry patch file
     and des a "merge", or in other words, changes the values contained in
     the registry to match the ones in the patch file.  This means fun for
     the little guys!  Here's a snippit from my favorite registry patch file
     that I keep on my Windows 95 disk o' death (anything in parenthesis 
     isn't part of the registry patch.  Square brackets ARE a part of the
     patch!!!).  Here we go:

     ----------------------< Cut Edit-reg.REG >-----------------------
REGEDIT4
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System]

"DisableRegistryTools"=dword:00000000  (Lets us use the regedit now)

     ----------------------< Cut >------------------------------------

     If you double click on Edit-Reg.REG (Or double click a link to it via 
     OLE), you will be able to launch registry editor without the "Registry
     Editing has been disabled..." message.  The rest of the system is yours
     once you "adjust" the setting for those other values I listed in section
     Ib.

     By the same token, replacing the 00000000 with 00000001 in the
     "DisableRegistryTools" value in the registry itself, or in the patch
     file (of course you need to run the patch file first) will disallow
     access to registry-altering tools such as regedit. This is why the
     registry needs some work.  How do you fix it?

     I would advise giving technicians a copy of regedit.exe (and other stuff
     like a registry patch file like this one) on a floppy disk, and erase 
     regedit.exe from the machines.  Regedit accepts command line arguments,
     running "A:\regedit.exe a:\Edit-Reg.REG" will then allow the technician
     to run "A:\regedit.exe", then edit the registry for that system.  (Then,
     before quitting the registry editor, modify the DisbleRegistryTools value
     again, or run another patch to lock the registry down again.)  Secure? If
     someone has a copy of regedit.exe on a floppy and can fabricate a patch
     (not hard to do, as shown above) then you're not much better off.


II.  OLE (Object Linking and Embedding)

  a. OLE features that make the user cheer "OLE!"
     OLE isn't necessarily a bad thing. It allows tons of funky things to be
     done, such as throwing a digital image into a plain-old text document.
     Introduced full-force in win3.x, it was very similar to what the people
     at APPLE had been toying with for a while.  Add sounds to your documents
     or plop part of your spreadsheet into a fiscal report for your boss, and
     even attach a whole file to the essay you e-mailed to your English
     teacher!  OLE handles 2 types of connection methods, Linking and
     Embedding (imagine that...).  Linking will not place a copy of the
     linked document into the work in progress.  It merely points to it on
     the current computer.  Any changes you make to the linked file will be
     reflected equally in any document that it is linked to. Embedding a file
     places a copy of the embedded file INTO the work in progress.  Any
     changes made to the embedded part do not have any effect on the original
     file, nor do changes to the original have an effect on the embedded one.
     You use OLE often when doing clipboard operations such as cut, copy and
     paste.  OLE is not a bad thing...at first glance... 

  b. Why OLE opens some major security holes
     OLE allows you to attach or link to almost any file that Windows knows
     how to handle.  One can link to a bitmap file and Windows will access
     Paintbrush, and use it to show the bitmap as if it were PART of the
     document.  If an executable file is embedded, it will be handled like
     Windows normally handles an executable (runs it).  Granted, some times
     command.com still won't work (This is a registry thing again... See 
     "Advanced Registry Fun, Appendix A of this article.), but there are still
     a lot of things you can pull off.  I know of no workaround for problems
     with OLE, because it's impossible (I think) to disable it.  Frogman is
     experimenting with the idea of removing OLE from Windows.  This far, he's
     seeing that apps which do not require OLE to function work fine, but
     many programs use OLE to ovcmmunicate between modules, as well.  These
     programs do not run properly, and sometimes not at all.  It is a hypo-
     thesis that if a secure system is needed, anti-OLE mods can be made, and
     specially chosen software programs (which don't require OLE).  Perhaps
     an article on anti-OLE techniques later, if we find a decent way to pull
     it off...


III. Windows 95 Login Screen
     I really don't have a lot to say about the login screen.  It is an 
     extremely pathetic (almost worthless) security mechanism.
     It's basically good for each user having a customized desktop.  By 
     hitting the Windows key (CTRL-ESC), you can launch the task manager, and
     go to the file menu, select "RUN", and browse through anything you'd 
     want to run. A fun thing is to run "explorer.exe", as this is what 
     creates the desktop environment.  Granted, you still have a login
     dialog box on-screen, but you have a desktop and start menu.  Often
     enough, if the system is REALLY insecure, you do not even need to go 
     through that mess.  Just hit the escape key at the login and it'll give
     you a desktop.  Fun stuff.  To fix this, there are 2 paths to be taken.
     If your system does not give a desktop when escape is hit at the login,
     all you must do is delete taskman.exe out of the C:\Windows folder.  As
     long as A:\ isn't in your path (so that someone with taskman.exe on a
     floppy could still use this bug), you should be secure in this aspect.
     If your login screen gives up the desktop when escape is pressed, then
     you need to not only erase taskman.exe, but you must either modify the
     registry to disallow this behavior, or modify the desktop settings so
     that it is locked down in the registry and nothing can be run from
     within the default desktop.


IV.  Windows AutoRun
     AutoRun is a feature that was introduced in Windows 95.  It senses when
     a CD is inserted into the CD-ROM drive, then scans the root directory
     of the CD for a file called AUTORUN.INF.  This file contains only a
     file name and an extension.  No path, just a file name.  This is usually
     (but not limited to being) an executable that is found in the root of
     the CD-ROM.  If AutoRun is enabled, Windows opens (or runs) the file.

  a. AutoRun is obviously a very handy thing.  Programs that use AutoRun
     will seem to launch themselves when you insert the CD-ROM.  Some pro-
     grams will launch a menu that allows you to install the software (in
     case it isn't installed yet), change installation options, launch the
     program, or quit.  The original idea behind this feature was to add yet
     another level of convenience and ease-of-use.  

  b. AutoRun can spell disaster for your dreams of a secure computer.  Not
     only does it allow people to walk up to your system and install a game
     they bought down the street somewhere with ease, even if they can't SEE
     the CD-ROM drive, or run an install program; there are several other 
     problems that AutoRun introduces.  One that is less obvious than most is
     that AutoRun is willing and able to bypass the screensaver password (if
     one exists), bomb out of the screensaver, and run whatever it was that
     the AUTORUN.INF file points to.  This is an easy way around a screen
     saver password.  Also, with the advent of CD-ROM Writers (Burners), 
     and the falling prices of the same, more and more people (hackers,
     crackers, little kids with rich parents, etc) are getting ahold of 'em.
     Those who can program worth a darn could easily make their custom
     program run as soon as they inserted the CD-ROM they just burned, just
     by making AUTORUN.INF point to it.  Do you REALLY want anyone to be 
     able to run whatever they can program/copy on your computer?

  c. Disabling AutoRun
     On my desktop, I leave AutoRun enabled.  It's convenient.  But when I
     am trying to secure a system, this is not a hole I wish to leave un-
     scathed.  It takes me all of 30 seconds (or less) to disable AutoRun,
     and it'll probably be one of the quickest security modifications you
     will make.  The first step is to get to System Properties.  This is
     done by right clicking on the "My Computer" icon, and selecting the
     "Properties" item on the pop-up menu, or by selecting "System" from
     the Control Panel.   Next, choose the "Device Manager" tab.  Find
     "CDROM" on the Device Manager tree, and expand it (by clicking the +
     sign to the left of it).  This shows a list of all CD-ROM devices
     attached to your system.  Select the CD-ROM that you want to disable
     AutoRun on, and click the "Properties" button.  Then, click on the
     "Settings" tab.  The check box labeled "Auto Insert Notification"
     is the key here.  If it is checked (which it probably is), then
     AutoRun is enabled.  Uncheck it to disable AutoRun.  This is one
     of those settings that don't get read in again until the system is
     restarted.  If you have other modifications to moke, make them
     before restarting (or else you'll probably reboot 4 or 5 times).
     If you want to (re) enable AutoRun, it should be fairly obvious how
     to do it.


V.   Help
  a. Help is a very useful aspect of Windows programs.  It's like having a 
     personal online quick reference for many of the programs.  When you 
     select a help screen (or when you press F1 while on the desktop), one of
     two programs are usually executed: WINHELP.EXE or WINHLP32.EXE in the
     Windows folder.  Pressing F1 at the desktop will give you a very large
     and possibly exhaustive database of answers about various user-level
     Windows stuff.  It has a very powerful find utility that allows the user
     to quickly seek answers, and to do so with quite a bit of speed.  Very
     handy, indeed.

  b. Sometimes, however, Windows' help facility can "help" a little too much,
     for instance it can "help" people circumvent those restrictions that
     you've worked so hard to fortify.  By searching for the right help 
     topics, such as help topics on installing software, one might be able to
     navigate the hard drive, delete files, and even execute any file on the
     system, including things on floppy disk. This is very bad.  The only way
     to get around this is by deleting the Windows help executables: 
     WINHELP.EXE and WINHLP32.EXE in the C:\Windows folder.  Not always the
     best way, as this will disable Windows' help, and most likely help will
     not work in many other aplications, either.


VI.  Find
     Find is a great utility for locating those files that get lost in the
     maze of your hard drive's directory structure.  It can be accessed by
     pressing the F3 key when you're at the desktop.  Find, similar to help,
     can also sometimes allow people to run illicit programs, delete files,
     or copy stuff from your system to a floppy disk.  The only workaround I
     know of is to remove the find option from the start menu (Another 
     registry toy I'll discuss in Appendix A), and then rip the F3 key off 
     of your keyboard.  This can be circumvented by a psycho who brings in
     a keyboard when trying to take over your machine.


VII. Boot Menu
  a. Explanation of the Boot Menu.
     The Boot Menu is a menu that is accessed a few different ways.  It is
     most commonly accessed when Windows Does not start all the way up, and
     the boot menu prompts for a safe-mode boot, but the user can choose what
     boot option to proceed with.  This menu is also accessible by pressing
     the F8 key right when the computer starts to load Windows 95 (if you see
     the splash screen, it's too late).  This allows access to a normal DOS
     mode session, which is typically option #6 on the menu.  Sometimes this
     is a good option if some of your DOS apps just don't like Windows.

  b. Dangers of the Boot Menu
     Hackers will often try to reboot the computer and use F8 to get into
     a DOS session (where Windows' petty security settings haven't even been
     enforced).  This is an extremely dangerous hole, in that any monkey with
     half a brain could look through anyone else's stuff, and Crackers could
     format your hard drive or plant viruses with ease.  When Windows 95 is
     booted into safe mode, ALL policy setting are TOTALLY IGNORED.  This is
     a Bad Thing, as almost all of your security settings have temporarily
     (or permanently, assuming the user knows his stuff) bitten the dust.

  c. Modifying MSDOS.SYS (Which contains Boot Menu options)
     MSDOS.SYS is a hidden system file, usually found in the root directory
     of the Booting Hard Drive.  You will need to change its attributes in
     order to edit it.  This is done with the "attrib" command.  If you don't
     know how to use it, read a DOS manual, and it'll help you out. This is
     what a typical MSDOS.SYS file looks like:

[Paths]
UninstallDir=C:\
WinDir=C:\WINDOWS
WinBootDir=C:\WINDOWS
HostWinBootDrv=C

[Options]
BootGUI=1
DoubleBuffer=1
Network=1
;
;The following lines are required for compatibility with other programs.
;Do not remove them (MSDOS.SYS needs to be >1024 bytes).
;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxa
...(File continues with xxxxxxxxxx...ending in letters a-s)...
;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxs


     It is not hard to disable the F8 (and other) keys while booting.  All you
     need to do is to add a line under [Options] saying "BootKeys=0".  It is
     still possible to induce a Boot Menu by restarting the computer, then
     pressing the RESET button or turning it off and back on again while the
     Splash screen is still up (Windows 95 still loading).  You can also add
     another line saying "BootMenuDelay=1" so that the menu will only appear
     for 1 second.  If you set this to 0, the boot menu will display for an
     indefinite period of time.  Below is a full table of all (that i know of)
     options that can be placed under the [Options] section of MSDOS.SYS.

     BootMulti=         If set to 1, allows booting into previous operating
                        System with the F4 Key.  Default is 0.

     BootDelay=n        Initial Delay before boot (This Determines how many
                        Seconds the user is given to hit a Startup Key such
                        as F4 or F8, before the system boots)  Default is 2.

     BootMenu=          If Set to 1, Boot menu Will appear whenever the
                        Machine is booted up.  Default is 0.

     BootMenuDefault=   This sets the default menu item on the Boot Menu.
                        Look at the boot menu if you want to know what all the
                        options are on your machine.

     BootMenuDelay=n    This sets the number of seconds that the boot menu
                        will wait for a user to enter an option before using
                        the default option as set with BootMenuDefault.
                        Default is 30 seconds.

     BootKeys=          When set to 1, Boot Keys are enabled.  When set to 0,
                        User cannot use boot keys to access boot menu.
                        Default is 1.

     BootGUI=           When set to 1, Machine boots into windows mode.  If
                        Set to 0, machine will always boot into DOS mode.
                        Default is 1.

     Logo=              If set to 1, The Splash Screen logo will appear while
                        Machine starts up.  If set to 0, no logo will be
                        displayed on startup.  Default is 1.

     BootWarn=          Enables starting in SafeMode without warning.  Default
                        is 1.

     DoubleBuffer=      Enables Double-Buffering driver for SCSI controllers.
                        Default is 0.

     Network=           Enables Safe Mode with Networking as a Boot Menu
                        option.  Default is 0.

Apendix A: Advanced Registry Fun

The registry contains more power than the human mind can comprehend. Through
it, a lot of very scary things may be accomplished, as well as quite a few
useful things.  At any rate, This section is not for people who just started
learning about the registry as they read the first part of this article.  I
strongly urge you to back up your registry before you do anything here.

The first thing I really must explain is the idea of policies.  Microsoft
has a "policy editor" called "poledit.exe" which is basically a cheap-ass
cheesy, user-friendly registry editor that edits a very small and specific
portion of the registry that contains policy information.  It also creates
".POL" files, where a handfull of other elusive policies are stored.  I don't
intend on covering the Policy Editor, though.  In my eyes, the policies are 
easier to edit with the registry editor (or through patches) than through the
policy editor.  If you know the locations of each policy key and can remember
what subkeys and values are under the policies, then you'll be in good shape.
More likely than not, you'll have to create the policy keys and values in the
registry editor.  They won't already be in place.  If they are, someone knew
what they were doing.

The policy key is actually locted in:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies
There are 4 Subkeys under policies: Explorer, Network (If the computer is
networked), System, and WinOldApp.  For those of you who still aren't
getting this, I'll do a little tree thing:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER
   |
   Software
      |
      Microsoft
         |
         Windows
            |
            CurrentVersion
               |
               Policies
                  |
                  Explorer
                  Network
                  System
                  WinOldApp

In this segment, We'll only be dealing with stuff under policies, as this
alone is a very powerful part of the registry.  There are other parts as
well, but I would need to write a novel if i were to cover it all.  I
won't talk about an HKEY path anymore.  I'll just talk about "This and
that value under the Explorer subkey".  Remember, if the policies key and
the 4 subkeys under it don't exist, then CREATE THEM in the place I said
they should be.

Locking Down the default user (When ESCAPE is pressed at login screen).
  HKEY_USERS contains a list of all users with accounts on the machine.
  when expanded, there is a list of subkeys that, when the user logs on,
  will become the structure of HKEY_CUERRENT_USER key.  By editing the
  .default user under HKEY_USERS, you can lock down the default desktop
  to allow next to nothing to occur.

Restricting Programs From Being Executed.
  Restricting the command prompt is somewhat easy, but I'll tell you that
  restricting executables is extremely messy.  This does not work the
  way you think it should, though.  You can specify what executables
  you want to be able to run, and all others will be locked out.  There
  is no way to lock out a handfull of specific applications.  The value
  that locks down executables is the "RestrictRun" Value under the
  Explorer subkey.
  
  When RestrictRun is set to 0, no execute restrictions are placed into
  effect.  If RestrictRun is set to 1, restrictions are placed into
  effect.  Before you take off and enable this, please be sure to set
  the names of programs you wish to allow run access.  These are values
  labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. These are string values under the RestrictRun
  SUBKEY of the Explorer Subkey.  Do not confuse this with the value by
  the same name.  I'll do a Mini-Tree (this one just goes back to the
  policies key, not all the way back to the HKEY)
              ...
               Policies
                  |
                  Explorer ------------> RestrictRun=0x00000001 (1)
                     |
                     RestrictRun ------> 1="Niceprog.exe"
                                 |       2="Regedit.exe"
                                 |       3="cdplayer.exe"
                                 ------> 4="telnet.exe"

  A registry patch that would lock out all software except for regedit,
  poledit (Policy editor), netscape, wordpad, and explorer would look
  like this:

(This is a file snippit.  Text may run off the right margin.  Please look
carefully at this segment)
----------------------------<Software-lock.reg>-------------------------------

REGEDIT4

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\]
"RestrictRun"=dword:00000001

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\RestrictRun]

"1"="REGEDIT.EXE"
"2"="POLEDIT.EXE"
"3"="NETSCAPE.EXE"
"4"="WORDPAD.EXE"
"5"="EXPLORER.EXE"

----------------------------<END>---------------------------------------------
  If this has been inserted into the registry, nothing will run except the
  applications you listed. I believe this modification kicks in after reboot.
  This is really not an efficient method to go about locking out programs, and
  I would advise using EXTREME caution when playing with this aspect.

  To disable a command prompt while in windows, you just need to set the value
  called "Disabled" (under WinOldApp subkey) to dword 1.  The drawback to this
  is that no dos-based programs or executables will run (due to the poss-
  ibility that they might induce a shell).  This is good for security unless
  old DOS-based apps are still being used.

Desktop Effects:
  Sometimes, a good way to hinder a user's ability to do harm is to make it
  harder to navigate through the hard drive.  One common trick is to remove
  all of the desktop icons.  This makes it harder for them to execute 
  anything that is not in the start menu, and makes it difficult to browse
  through the hard drive.  If that's too drastic for you, you may just want
  to hide all the drives under My Computer, and disallow "Entire Network"
  browsing under Network Neighborhood.  There are many options.  All of
  the below values are under Explorer unless noted by another subkey (i.e.
  Network\NoNetHood)

    To do this:                                Set this value to a dword 1
     Remove all desktop icons                   NoDesktop 
     Hide all drives in My Computer             NoDrives
     Hide Network Neighborhood                  Network\NoNetHood
     Disable "Entire Network" in NetHood        Network\NoEntireNetwork

Start Menu stuff:
  It's always nice to remove as many intrusive things from the Start Menu as
  possible.  This is also achieved with policies.  Since the "Start Menu" and
  taskbar are all handled by EXPLORER.EXE, these values will need to be under
  the explorer subkey of policies.

    To do this:                                Set this value to a dword 1
     Remove Run option from Start Menu          NoRun
     Remove all folders from "Settings"*        NoSetFolders
     Remove Taskbar Properties from "Settings"* NoSetTaskbar
     Remove Find option from Start Menu         NoFind
     Disable Shutdown Command%                  NoClose

  * if both values are set to 1, Settings will not show up on Start Menu
  % This is not adviseable, as it is no longer possible to "correctly"
    shut down the machine.

Another way to edit the registry is through an ".INF" file.  These files
are similar to patch files, except for a few slight differences.

.REG (Patch) files and .INF files compared:

Similarities:
Both can seriousely mess up a registry file
Both can add values or edit existing values 
Neither are restricted via the "DisableRegistryTools" stuff

Differences:
.INF files are MUCH more difficult to create.
.INF files can delete registry values and keys.
.INF files need to be Right-Clicked and the "Install" option selected in
     order to affect the registry, therefore they are a little safer.

Using .INF files for registry editing:

All .inf files start with:
--------<CUT>---------

[Version]
Signature="$Chicago$"

----------------------

After that, you need to make a section called "DefaultInstall", and
include the names of the sections that will hold registry editing
Data.  Then you need to create the proper sections (Called Add.Entries
and Del.Entries in this example).  If you place a semicolon (;) at the
beginning of a line, it will be ignored, for commenting purposes.  Look
at the following example:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
[DefaultInstall]
AddReg=Edd.Entries
DelReg=Del.Entries

[Add.Entries]
HKCU,Software\Microsoft\,BillShallDie,,"Down With Bill!!!"

;Registry Entries are stored in the following format:
;Branch (Abbreviated), Key (Path), ValueName, ValueDataType, ValueData
;
;There are a few things that need explaining here.  The first is
;"Branch Abreviations", the next is "DataTypes".  Here We Go...
;
;Abbreviations:
;HKEY_CURRENT_USER   = HKCU
;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE  = HKLM
;HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG = HKCC
;HKEY_USERS          = HKU
;HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT   = HKCR
;HKEY_DYN_DATA       = HKDD
;
;datatypes:
;0=string
;1=hex:01,ff,...
;2=string (but don't replace value if it already exists)
;3=hex (but don't replace value if it already exists)
; Note: As shown in the example, if the DataType value is left blank,
; A DataType value of "0" is assumed.

[Del.Entries]
HKCU,Software\Microsoft\,BillShallDie
;The format for Delete Entries is similar:
;Branch (Abbreviated), Key (Path), ValueName
------------------------------------------------------------------------



Appendix B: Some final stuff

Although you might be able to restrict executables from being run with
policies, in some cases, the shortcuts in help files will still allow
an application to be run.

The registry is almost impossible to secure.  As noted in section I,
it's fairly easy to mess around with the registry restrictions by using
simple little patch files.  There are also rumors that Norton's Registry
editor is fully capable and willing to mess with the registry, regard-
less of the setting contained within the registry that supposedly will
protect the registry from "Tools" that access the registry.

About policies, if the .POL files are stored on the local computer, and
not on a network, then it's potentially easy for someone to locate and
delete these files.  This would ultimately result in a loss of certain
policiy restrictions.  If your Windows 95 machines are on a network, you
would be wise to keep the policy files stored on the server, rather than
on each machine.  Be sure to restrict user access to these files via
your network's access restrictions.  This will make it more difficult to
mess with the policies.


Closing Remarks on Windows 95 Security

The point of this article was to bring to light some of the major security
flaws that are associated with Windows 95.  There are some really good 
3rd party programs that will totally patch some of these holes and many
others, but the programs themselves might have a few little flaws of their
own.  Please do not rip any keys off of your keyboard, though.  Most of
these little modifications do nothing more than keep the newbies and
wanna-be's from being little destructive punks.  Some examples in here
were simply to show you that no matter how hard you try, someone will
almost inevitably find a way in if it means enough to them.

Sorry for getting on the website so late.  We ran into some last-minute
problems with the Zine (like certain articles not getting finished, and some
other things.

On a happier note, Axon added a couple of little things to spice the site
up.  The first thing he did was to add a navbar to the top of most of the
pages.  Then, Hoolio (an HiR Reader) suggested that we come up with a
graphical Schem for the goldbox.  Axon spent a few minutes in Photoshop and
whipped out a schematic.  It's accessible through the HiR Links & Files page
on the distro site, and it's an excerpt from the Mobile hack/phreak article,
the entire section dealing with the goldbox, except the ascii schematics
have been replaced by jpegs, and I also included a picture of what a
finished goldbox looks like.

Also, Axon was looking at the site in lynx a while back ago, and noticed
that all the graphics were showing up as [INLINE], meaning that no "ALT"
properties had been set up on the images.  This has been fixed, and the
entire page is VERY Lynx friendly.

The new Links & Files page has tons of other cool stuff on it.  Be sure to
take a peek.


HiR 7's Tentative release date is Sept. 1, 1998.  Happy Hackin'!
