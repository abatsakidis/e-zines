This is the fisrt issue of HIR.  Hopefully this will be a bi-monthly
publication.  Those of you familiar with such well-known works as the
Legion of Doom/Legion of Hackers Tech Journals, Phrack Magazine, and the old
Communications of The New Order Mags might see a stunning resemblance.  The
goals of this magazine are simple: to continue the spread of knowledge that
helps keep information free for those who wish to have it (that means you if
you're reading this)  All articles are completely H/P related.  No death or
destruction; no credit card phraud or stealing things from stores.  This is
HACKING and PHREAKING.  Exploring phone networks, pbx's, data structures, and
contributing to the general spread of...well, Hacker's Intelligence is what
this mag is about.

        So many people way too often ask me "how do I hack?" or ask me to
TEACH them how to, as if it was like cooking (add a little this and that and
bake for 2 hours).  Unfortunately, it's far from being easy to "teach" all
the skills that are needed, but over the last few years I've come up with
a list of things that most people don't have, that they either really need,
or would just be good help if they want to be serious about this sport.

  1) A computer
        Let me explain this one.  I survived on an 8088 laptop and 2400bps
        for quite a while.  I wasn't cracking password files with it, but
        I could have my modem software/scanner, and a slow but useful modem
        attached.  Most of you will want something with a little bit more
        power (for games, if nothing else).  Any x86 (386/486/Pentium) based
        system should work, as long as it can run any popular operating
        system.  Ideally, I would suggest having at least a cheaper, old
        laptop that's pcmcia (PC-Card) modem ready, unless you want to find
        a 120v wall outlet in farmer jones' pasture... (I'll discuss lappies
        later)

  2) A modem
        These are very handy.  Pick one, I don't care what kind, no one else
        will either.  Just don't get a ZOOM series and you're good to go.
        Now that I got the two basic things out of the way that make people
        say "DUH!!!  Axon, do you think I'm an idiot?!".  No comment.

  3) A touch of phreaker power
        Most hackers have learned that they have to, at one time or another
        borrow some tricks from another popular cyberculture sport, phreaking.
        My suggestions are to know how to build and use a device called a
        "Gold Box".  It allows you to hack from home, and it's traced to a
        different number.

        for those of you that choose to dabble with a laptop, familiarize your-
        selves with another tool called the "beige box", which allows you to
        directly tap into someone else's phone system and use their line.  If
        a trace is run on you, it's not your number, it's the number of the
        house (corporation etc.) you were using.  Fun, huh?

...and while we are talking about laptops...(a brief tanget by Axon)
When I first got into computers, the modems were strange...one didn't plug
something into a phone line and type commands in.  They placed the actual
handset of the phone onto some rubber cups (that picked up and sent out the
carrier sounds and translated the sounds into characters for the computer).
Recently there has been a popularizing of a device similar to the old acoustic
modems (which were capable of no higher than 1200 bps).  The newer cousin of
the modems-of-old is called an Acoustic Coupler.  It looks like a whacked up
telephone.  On the old modems, you didn't need to find a jack to plug into,
just find a phone, any phone that works.  That's the idea behind the Coupler.
Usually running off 9v Batteries, the "phone cord" from the coupler plugs into
your modems "line" jack, and you simply strap a handset down onto the rubber
cups, and dial.  I recently acquired one of these, and I've gotten speeds up
to 19,200bps with it.  That brings me to #4...
(end of taqngent)

  4) Acoustic coupler
        Just for those of you who might be using a portable computer, palmtop,
        laptop, or some other strange device to hack with.  (I won't explain
        this any further, read above if you haven't already.)

  5) Curiosity and Drive
        Many people who really feel that their destiny is to become a hacker
        just don't have that drive that makes them want to know more.  This is
        important.  You MUST be curious; enough so to keep you hooked on
        hacking.  If you don't have this much, stop reading and go into
        basket weaving or something.

  6) Decent study skills
        No, this doesn't mean you should be a straight "A" student.  School is
        boring and pointless.  I had a 1.6 GPA after i finished High screwl.
        If you can't stand the thought of sitting down and spending lots of
        your time observing, writing, brainstorming, programming, and testing,
        you can forget hacking as well.  Hackers need brains.  (Read the
        article "Preparing the hack" later this issue.)

  7) Other things that help which are not always needed
        Know some programming, I don't care if it's assemlber, C++, Pascal,
        QuickBasic 4.5, or what.  A hacker should be able to at least write
        small programs, but if you insist that coding is not your thing, it's
        not really 100% important.  Also, some Hardware knowledge is good (as
        well as knowing how to use a soldering iron and electrical tape).
        Most of the quality hacking tools available on the net are good.  Try
        things like "ToneLoc" and many others.  Also, if you have a printer
        you should use it.  I have file cabinets FULL of info I've printed
        on operating systems, companies, networks, and other things.  Remember
        those study skills!


Technically, I guess that's all you really need in order to start hacking.
Of course some kewl-ass little toys are good to have, such as a multitester
or Oscilliscope (the oscilliscope's uses for computer hacking are a few and
far between from my experience) and anything else you can use to help you hack
into your mark.  (Remember: A hacker is a survivalist who will use whatever
he can to his advantage)

There's a lot that goes into a really good hack.  Everything, of course
depends greatly on what you are actually hacking.  Before you think about
guessing usernames and passwords, Try a few intelligent things.

If the place is local, by ALL MEANS go there!  Sit across the street and
watch what goes on. Stay there all night even, and see when guards arrive,
and when they make their rounds.  Look for security cameras and other things.
Your target: The Dumpster.  That's all you're physically going to do at the
site of the place you are hacking is wading through a dumpster.  Look for
papers with phone numbers on them, Printed and discarded e-mail, and anything
else that looks like it could provide useful information.

If the place you are hacking is on the internet, then try telnetting to it
first.  IF it asks for a login, print the screen or write the info down, and
then break the connection.  We aren't going to guess just yet.  Finger the
host and print that out, too, unless it refuses a finger connection.  You
may also want to run a port scanning software on the host.  This will tell
you what services they have enabled for use from the outside world.

If they are internetted AND Local, use BOTH of those above tactics (DUH).

Internet Service providers (ISP's) are easy to mess with.  Call some up and
ask if they offer shell accounts.  IF they say no, don't waste your time.
Call the next one.  Once you find a place allowing a shell account, ask if you
could test a guest account for a day or two.  You can demand this, because
after all, you don't want to spend your money on a piece of shit ISP. You want
to know what you're buying first.  You don't buy a car straight off the lot
after you did no more than peek into the window.  Once you have a guest
account, Set your terminal software to log the comunications, and type
"cat /etc/passwd" and hopefully you'll get a list of usernames, and some other
funky looking stuff (like encrypted passwords and other things).  All the
different fields in the password file are separated by a colon (:).  The first
field is always the user name, and the second is (usually) the encrypted
password.  If the password field is one character (such as x, * or !) then
the password file is shadowed.  You can read many text files on how to attempt
to un-shadow the file.  Once you have the passwd file you have 2 things:  A
list of every username on the system, and an encrypted password list.

If you feel like spending a few days or weeks without using your computer,
it is easy to crack a password file.  Download any of the password crackers
you can find on the internet, and find "Dictionary" files (a huge file with
tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of words, that can be used to crack the
passwd with) for each password the cracker encounters, it encrypts all the
dictionary words, and compares them to the encrypted password in the list).
I would suggest "Star Crak" for this...it's one of the fastest programs I've
seen.   Along similar lines, is a program called "Guess", which checks for
those dorks that make their password the same as their username (i've found
several passwords this way).

If you feel gutsy and try to hack a system/network at your school, be careful.
Usually these places know they are vulnerable, but don't have enough money to
go and buy fancy security systems, so they compromise by being extremely harsh
on hackers.  The people never found me out at the high school because I had
my laptop hooked into their network and they didn't know where I was
physically (they had a map of the school and kept track of their computers'
network ID's so they knew exactly where things were coming from...except for
me...  Several people got busted at my school.  No expulsions, but a few good
scares and within 2 months of having the network up they had enough hacks to
force them to create a poster containing "Internet Usage Guidelines" or some
bullshit like that.

Colleges are a different story.  As soon as I started there I came in with a
clean record, but I frequent the computer labs.  If you are going to play
hacker at a college, act computer dumb in the highest degree.  DON'T be
found in the computer labs 3 hours a day.  I would suggest going to the labs
long enough to find out network ID's, IP addresses, Physical locations of any
servers, and other things like that, doing so over the period of a month.  In
other words, keep it to a max of 1 hour, and always complain about having to
type.  You hate typing but all your instructors want typed shit!  ARRGH!!!
you get the dripht.  Find your info ON campus, Ask who runs the servers maybe
if you feel like being bold, and do your hacking from OUTSIDE of the campus
if at all possible.  (about noon-3pm is a good time to do that, and 2am as
well....the bussiest times and the times where NO ONE is there).  Most Junior
Colleges, universities, and colleges have no hesitations about expelling a
rogue computer user.  You can always have a friend at another school get info
for you about their school, and you give your friend info about your school
and hack each other's schools till doomsday.  (That trick works sometimes, and
if you're careful you won't get caught and you don't even need to act stupid
about computers)

{[(----------------------------<[By: Axon]>--------------------------------)]}

A hacker's dream...to be able to dial up anything, anywhere, and hack it
without leaving a traceable path.  Sometimes it becomes nessecary to pay a
few cents (or bucks) to do this (or a way to "transcend" the cost if that's
what kind of person you are.  It's riskier to do it that way).  There are a
few decent ways to make sure your mark never finds you out (via caller ID,
ANI, or tracing methods).

Some people think that if you snatch a UNIX shell account and telnet all over
the place to hell and back again a few (hundred) times, It'll be so hard to
trace you no one will bother.  THIS METHOD IS 100% BULLSHIT.  By checking
system logs, it's easy to find where the shell acount you dialed up to
resides.  After that, the system logs will show what line you called in on and
what time.  Face it.  The phone company knows what number called that line at
that time.  From there, you might as well bend over and take it like a man,
because if they want to find you now, you're screwed.  I don't want anyone
(at least one of our readers) to have that happen to them, which is why I'll
tell you a few good ways to anonymize your phone calls.

Actually, we aren't anonymizing at all.  That's impossible.  There has to be
SOME phone number that the call originates from.  The only main LEGAL ways to
anonymize yourself is to use either a payphone.

Payphone:
Some of you lesser-educated hackers might be asking "payphone?  Payphones
don't have rj-11's on them"  This is usually true.  Some, however do.  Of
course this typically works best if you have a portable system and modem that
don't require any outside form of power.  Most payphones don't have rj-11's, 
so this is where the phun part comes in.  Remember in the second phyle?  Yah,
That's it...the coupler!  Strap it onto the fone, dial up someone else's shell
account and telnet, or if ya got sum balls, just do a direct dial to yer mark.

Most of the juicy places information loves to hide is dial-up only.  No
internet, nothing.  A single computer attached to a fone line.  Often, this
is even protected by intricate passwords and often call-back systems.  On a
call-back system, a hacker needs to intercept the outbound call.  I will not
go into this now, because there are many files on hacking call-back systems,
and this really does not fall into the scope of anonymity.  The point is that
sometimes, the only way into a system is through the phone.  Learn the ways to
mislead the origin of the call.

There are obviousely a few non-legal ways to go about making your phone call
anonymous.  These are ways that, in some way or another, tap into someone
else's phone line.  

One method is to use a beige box adapted for a modem.  This, again is usually
a tactic that works better with portables, unless you feel like running the
phone line underground to your house.  An alternative is the Gold Box.
Gold boxes at one time were fairly popular, though their use is declining.
I would suggest reading some of the many phyles on the gold box. It is
a very fun toy, and will help you sharpen your solderinng skills if nothing
else.  Note that if law enforcement gets ahold of your new toy, and they can
prove "intent to use", you get the shaft.  (you don't even have to commit the
crime to get the book).  The theory behind a gold box is if you can find 2
phone lines in the same box (Sometimes this is behind a business building) You
place a device between them so that when you call the first line, it picks up
the second line and puts it through to you, giving you a dial tone--Someone
else's dial tone.  The foneco would trace it to the second line, and if you go
back and take your precious gold box out of that location before they find it,
chances are you're home free.

There are more technical and fancier ways to make sure the foneco can't find
out where you are coming from, but that typically takes some very advanceed
hacking techniques, large amounts of time, and knowledge that originates only
from years of hardcore phreaking (that i don't have).  This kind of setup
would be more down the alley of a phreaker that wanted to use a touch of
hacking for his own uses, rather than a hacker who uses a little phreaking to
mask his/her activity.  If anyone knows these methods, though, they could
write an article up on the topic for us.  =]
                How to build your own telephone bug
           A Hacker's Information Report Article by Axon

Now, of course, this article is going to display the principle of radio
transmission, as well as showing how to use an alternative power source;
therefore this article is completely educational.  You'll even get to
practice soldering!  Wheee!  (By the way, listening to someone else's
telephone conversation without their permission is against the law, and
it's also mean.  Never attempt to bug my telephone.  I'll find it as soon
as I pick up the phone.  Don't point fingers at me if you get busted for
doing something non-educational with this info...snicker)

The first thing I would recommend to all you crazy hacks is to scroll to
the BOTTOM of this text, and ogle at my Ascii-Schem for how to make this
awesome device.  I may put a Gif version of the schematic up on the HIR
Distro site later if i get a whole lot of complaints.  Note the parts list
under the schem...jot all those things down, and go to some place to get
them.  You may need to special order the transistors, but probably not.
Radio shack might have them, or an equivalent.  Just ask and they'll look
through a huge old book to find equivalents.

Now that you have your parts, let's continue... I expect most of you should
be able to assemble it from the schem.  you will probably want to etch a
small pc-board (I've fit this project on a board as small as a quarter), or
something.  This is REALLY simple.

To make the coil, take the 6 inches of enameled 28 gauge wire, and scrape the
enamel off the ends (1/8 inch is good) and wrap the wire tightly around a
pencil, and carefully remove it, taking care to keep its shape.  If it gets
deformed, you are screwed.  Redo it.  

Since this article is educational, I might as well teach you guys how all
this crap works together to send a fone conversation over the radio waves.
This device is a combination of a high frequency oscillator, and a voice
amplifier.  The voice amplifier takes the signal from the phone line, and uses
it to modulate the oscillator, causing a nice clear FM signal.  Let's take
a look at what's happening inside out little circuit.

The parts of the bug that makes up the oscillator circuit are Q1, L1, C1, C2,
C3, C4, R2, and R3, and a power supply, which happens to be the phone line
(wow!  No batteries or nothing?!) Q1 is Biased into conduction by R2.  The
collector of Q1 is attached to L1, and C2, 3, and 4. This array of coil and
capacitors happens to cause an oscillationn ranging between 88MHz and 108 MHz,
depending on how the trimmer capacitor is adjusted.  This range of frequencies
is typically known as the FM (frequency Modulation) Band.  That's right, the
stuff your FM radio can "hear".

Q2 and R1 make up the Voice amplifier, which is used to amplify the audio
signal, and is then used to modulate the signal that the oscillator is
generating.

Okay, so how do we hook this up, find what frequency it's on, use it, etc?

Well, ya gotta hook it up first.  Testing this device requires a phone line,
a phone, and an FM radio that you can have close to the phone.  To hook it
up, you have to put it between the phone.  This will be hooked up sort of in
series with the phone, and kinda parallel, too.

Green wire: Hook this up to the green line wire on the FAR side of the fone.
Gray wire: Hook this up to the green line wire on the NEAR side of the fone.
Red wire: Attach it to the red wire.  IT just needs to make contact.  Don't
          Cut the red wire, and if you do, twist all three red wires back
          together.

green line wire/green bug wire    Gray Bug wire      Green fone wire|""""""| 
---------------*--------|"""""|---------------------*---------------|      |
                        | BUG |                                     | FoNE |
                        |_____|--| <---RED Bug wire                 |      |
---------------------------------*----------------------------------|______|

To test it, tune to an empty station on your FM radio, one with only static.
pick up the fone your bug is attached to, and then adjust the Trimmer slowly
(preferably with something insulated or plastic) until you hear the dial tone
(or if you wait too long, the "We're Sorry..." message) on the radio.  make
sure you aren't touching any of the wires (especially the coil) as this will
slightly change the frequency when you release it.  You now have a working
bug. IF you just can't seem to tune it in, check to make sure you don't have
any loose connections or solder bridges.  IF that doesn't work, try using
a different empty radio channel.

For permanent installation, you may want to mount it inside a project box,
with one male, and one female RJ-11 jack sticking out so you can just plug
it straight into any normal fone line, or you may consider mounting it INSIDE
a telephone.  This device is small enough.  As far as the Antenna, I've tried
various things.  you may want to make a long wire, or just hook the antenna
wire up to the yellow modular wire (which is used for a second line.  This
will not, however, mess up their second line if they have one, just make it
a huge antenna.  You may be able to pick up the conversations from as far away
as a quarter mile.  Good luck!
