                          Post-Defcon 6.0 Issue

._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-.

Two months ago, 3 HiR Members were thrilled to be a part of Defcon 6.0,
one of the largest annual Computer Underground conventions held here in
the U.S. Axon, Asmodian X, and Frogman all attended.  Each member has 
written an article on the event, what they learned, and how they feel
about Defcon. This was the fisrt underground convention for all three of
them, so this should be interesting.  Read and find out, but don't be
surprised if you read some things more than once...

This issue was delayed by a month.  We aologize for any inconvenience this
caused.  The delay was caused mostly by a change of jobs for Axon, and
school starting up again for some of our other writers.  The job change
brought a new server for the 'zine, however.  It's now running off of
Axon's workstation, axon.jccc.net.  It's still under a directory.  I hope
that the personal pages for HiR members will be located there in the near
future.  Also, the URL we advertise, hir.home.ml.org, still takes you to
the site, as promised.

._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-.

HiR is an electronic publication that is written by real hackers and phone
phreaks that have the desire to share information.  We only publish articles
related to hacking and phreaking.  We don't cover viruses, stealing, carding,
or blowing things up.

As a general rule, we don't do many walk-thru's; occasionally we might, 
but we almost always focus more on explaining a given aspect in enough 
depth to help the reader understand why things happen.  With that 
information, they may learn for themselves and discover many other 
things related to the article.  

._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-.

We are always looking for new writers.  If you are (or were) in the H/P
scene, and consider yourself a decent writer, send us some of your work.
Our e-mail is h_i_r@hotmail.com or hir@axon.jccc.net.

This time around, we're going to hand out a few good news sites.  These
are places whose contents are very dynamic, usually changing several times
throughout the day (but don't worry, they all archive the past
god-knows-how-many days.)  These are the places to keep your eye on if you
want to stay on top of the latest updates and fun toys.  Here we go:

Freshmeat (http://www.freshmeat.net)
News and software for the Linux user. An awesome Linux news/software
resource!

Slashdot (http://www.slashdot.org)
Another techie news site, info about Linux, Win9x, Everything
else.   Pretty Humorous, usually.  Retains the Informative nature.

Hacker News Network (http://hackernews.com)
Hacker News Network posts information on the latest web-site hacks with
lots of technical info.  It has info on Exploits and other fun stuff.  
Looks like Slashdot with a dark twist.

			Mobile Hacking part III
			By Asmodian X

As always, Mobile hacking is an enormous subject so i suggest you read
up on Mobile Hacking parts one and two.  In this section I hope to cover 
A bit more on devices, software and go over physical security a bit.

Part 1
Physical Security

Well to put it simply, the company with the most cash has the best
security.  So heres a general chart that deals with countermeasures on a
per location basis.

Location   | Rent-a-pigs | Company Cops | feds | Video Survalence | 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Retail
strip mall    	yes             
----------
stand alone	yes		maybe			maybe (*recorded)
retail
----------
small		yes		maybe			maybe (*recorded)
business
park
----------
warehouse 			yes			yes (CCD)
----------
corporate			yes			yes (ccd,recorded) 
office
----------
Corporate			yes			yes (ccd,recorded)
HQ			(big guys w. guns)
----------
Govt. office       			yes		yes, yes, yes
(*Don't go near
fed. offices*)

	I can imagine you saying now, "Geez asmo, what are we talking
about Burglary"  To that I would have to emphatically say NO!  The point
here it to rummage through what they already don't care about. Ie the
Garbage cans.  Yes, the entire point of this section is about trashing.
Taking the saying, "another mans trash is another mans treasure," to
heart.  You see our government has grown so entangled with laws and
regulations, that it has become impossible for a company to just GIVE
stuff away.  There's mountains of paper work to just GIVE stuff away,
therefore its cheaper to pay Defenbaugh <or whatever trash service the
company uses> to take everything away for you.. out of sigh out of mind
right?  

Well Generally, company's still care (*for some dumb reason or another*) 
about their garbage.  A few company's even feel that it requires armed
guards to keep those (*evil people*) out of their stuff . So thats the
main intent of this article, how to avoid trouble when going through some
one else's garbage.  Legally speaking, if all your doing is trashing, the
most you will ever run into is tress-passing charges.  Which isn't really
worth prosecuting so they just tell you never to come back. 

In my table above, I listed some locations and in general terms what
external security those locations would probably have.  Keep in mind that
the more important the location, the better the defenses. 

Rent-a-pigs: Privately owned security officers who's job is to
patrol a large area and keep it free of disturbances.  They usually don't
make a habit of hanging around the dumpsters.

Company Cops: Security Officers who are hired for the specific purpose of
patrolling a single company.  They are more common amongst larger
installations, and are less privy to intruders.  Avoid these people.

Feds: If your dealing with feds.. please format your drive now...
if your that stupid...  We never met... Happy Nachos to you and say hi
to Kevin Mitnick for us.

Cameras: Well there's two uses for cameras, 1.) To look at after the fact
and identify suspects. 2.) To watch everything from a central point and
then direct your boys to hot spots.  Ie.. there's a bunch of kids
trashing.. go get 'em J.D.

If your going to go up against some security, don't just run in.  Do some
planning..

Part 2
Mobile Electronics.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Item		Attack platform|Server|dial-out|Term.	|
TI-Calc*	no		no	 no	yes
Old Laptop	no		no	 yes	yes
Palmtop		yes		no	 yes	yes
Laptop		yes		yes	 yes	yes
Desktop		yes		yes	 yes	yes
	
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

If you need gather information, chances are that you need to some kind of
electronic device to access the net.  Well heres some more thoughts on
mobile computing.

To start off, id like to give honorable mention to the TI calculators.
TI calculators have been one of the more popular requirements for
algebra classes everywhere.  Because of this, there have been more
programs and doo-dads made available for it than macintosh <not really but
there's a lot of stuff for it.>  For instance, there is a terminal emulator
program available for TI-8x series of calculator which turns the
calculator into a dumb term, of course you would need the serial cable.
Specs for the Serial cable can be found at HTTP://www.ticalc.org, you will
also find a large software archive for the TI-8x series of calculators.

It is not too hard to find a cheepo 286 lappie.  Just something with a
screen, some ram, and form of storage media, and a floppy drive.
A battery is always a plus, although you can always substitute a UPS.
Typically this configuration provides an ideal dumb terminal <with some
form of communications software like Telex > or a dial out if you can get
ahold of a modem.

If you have the cash, you might even consider an upper end PDA or Palmtop
computer.  These handy devices are usually self contained with display
keyboard and battery's, plus some internal storage.  The newer ones use an
operating system called Microsoft Windows CE v. 1.x or 2.x.  And its
pretty easy to find utility's for it at HTTP://www.hpc.net
For more information on HPC's see some of my previous articles on HPC's at 
HTTP://www.hir.home.ml.org/.   I consider Windows CE as an attack
platform because Windows CE <both versions> have a TCP stack, and PPP
dial-out capability's.  Not to mention it has a built in PCMCIA card slot,
so you can use just about anything on it.  bare in mind that WIN CE 2.0 is
the only version as of date that supports NIC(*Ethernet*), cards.

Ahh, the laptop!  All the whole-grain goodness of a desktop crammed into 
an itty bitty proprietary case.  Typically a full powered laptop has about 
3 hours of un-plugged use before you need to re-charge the battery.  With
a newer laptop, you will have dual PCMCIA card slots, complete with the
usually Parallel and serial slots and maybe even an IR port and a USB port.
Laptops make decent Servers and exelent attack platforms.  

A desktop can run just about anything but simply lacks portability.  So it
could be considered a Server or an Assault platform. In general, a person
could hack with a plastic spork and a rubber ducky, but its probably
easier if you stick to using something technological.

Part 3
Operating systems

Now you got your Slash Bang 2000 486 laptop, now what do you run on it.

PC (80x86 or pentium) Opperating Systems		
Device		Dos	Win 3x	Win 9x	Win NT	Linux	BSD	 SCO
---------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------
old Laptop	yes	maybe*	no	no	maybe*	maybe*	no
newer Laptop	yes	yes	yes	maybe*	yes	yes	yes
Desktop		yes	yes	yes	yes	yes	yes	yes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note the first four entry's are all made by Micro$loth(tm).  There
are generic versions of Dos, like DR. Dos, Free DOS and a few others. 
Free DOS is a GNU MS/PC 3.x DOS compatible OS, more information can be
found at HTTP://www.freedos.org/.  The Latter 3 are Unix derivatives and
are generally free, except SCO Unix. SCO Unix is a commercial
implementation however there are free Non-commercial licenses available. 
Linux and Free BSD are free, and covered under the GNU free software
policy. 

Free/PC/MS/DR DOS

Plus:
The version you might want to shoot for is MS-DOS 5.0 compatibility. 
There are more dos productivity applications available than ANY OTHER
OPPERATING SYSTEM.  Not to mention dos runs on ANY PC based computer.
You can find dos drivers for DOS MUCH easier than with the Unixes.  They
also have much better commercial support in general.
 
cons::
Dos is a Single user, Single processing operating system.  Any
Multitasking is done on the application level.  Memory management is
Horrid, if not non-existent.  Its a 8 bit operating system thats
impossibly archaic. 

Windows 3.x:
plus:
It utilizes the 386 instruction set and performs multitasking.  Has an
*easy* to use GUI, and there are many applications available for it.  
It runs on pretty much any 386 class CPU with a video adaptor.

Cons:
Runs on-top of dos... inherently unstable.  See DOS for rest of
complaints.

Windows 9x:
plus:
Every one uses it now.  much better memory management.  Does not rely on DOS
to run.  network capability is much better than win 3x.  Much more stable
than Win 3.x.  has multi user capability and some security features

con:
Every one uses it now.  Multi user Wanna be.  Marketed to be several
things it wasn't.  

Windows NT:
plus:
Stabler than windows 95, has Multi user, high speed file system.
Multi user.  Runs windows dos/3x and win 9x programs.  Full 32 bit os with
multi processing support yadda yadda....

cons:
In the way of networking and being a *SERVER*, it isn't very secure.  A
person would need to install a great deal of Patches and bug-fixes before
I would even bother to use it as a server.  Its protection mechanisms are
dwarfed by Novell netwares permission setup and file permission setup..
not to mention that it costs WAY too much.  And when NT says it CAN use up
to 32 processors it does not mention that you OUGHT to use 32 processors..
because the Opperating system it self is so huge that it requires a monster
computer to run it as a server, under a typical network load.

Linux:
Pros:
Linux can run on any 386 class Intel compatible processor, you can run it 
with as much as 4 megabytes of memory, but generally requires a swap file
to load correctly.  Linux is FULLY POSIX compliant and is SYSTEM V
compliant.  It is a full FREE implementation of UNIX, and is one of the
most popular non-Microsoft operating systems.  Is also a full development
environment.  There is also a plethora of support available on the net.
A person can even run a GUI, such as XFree86.  When set up right, Linux
can out gun any NT server in the way of speed and services.  

Cons:
Unix environment is Complex, and generally more text based.  Because of
this, only people that have intermediate to expert level of knowlage about
PC-based computers should consider using Linux.  There is also NO
commercial backing, if the server crashes, there's no one to sue but your
self. there are also a limited amount of drivers available for devices and
virtually no support for proprietary devices such as PDA interfaces, some
digital cameras and other peripheral devices.   Linux is a MULTI USER
system which means that it dose not make a very good Home, desktop
Multimedia PC.  If your looking for an Assault platform and you don't want
to get into the nitty gritty details of setting up Linux, then forget it
and use Windows 9x.

BSD:
pluses:
BSD is more like a heavy duty UNIX distribution, it has Better memory
management than Linux and is generally more stable.  The actual code
under goes more over seeing and is generally cleaner than Linux.  In fact,
a great deal of Linux software was ported from BSD.  Generally, if your
going to run a server, do it with BSD.  BSD will also Run some Linux
binarys.

Cons:  
Bsd is slower to release new software and drivers, consequently
hardware drivers are harder to find.  PCMCIA support is known to Lag, and
for that reason, I don't not recommend BSD for a laptop.  

* Writer note: When I was at las Vegas at DefCon 6.0, the NetBSD people
had to go around begging for another brand of PCMCIA NIC card because the
card services were on the Fritz. The Linux people had no problems
what-so-ever.

SCO UNIX
pluses:
SCO Unix is a commercial implementation of Unix which means there's support
available for it, not to mention that every driver disk I've ever looked at
has SCO drivers.  In addition you actually have some commercial ports of
software like MS-WORD and WORKS and stuff for it.

cons:
SCO does not have the open software background, which means its a bitch to
patch.  Typically the free Unixes are patched faster then the commercial
ones because its a huge communal effort versus a centralized commercial
effort.

Def-Con 6.0

I could rattle on for a bit on this subject for a while but for now ill 
send greets to WW, Schemerz, Axon, Frogman, Aramadillo, and Jack the
techno dragon.  Pardon any handle mangling.  There was an even amount of
hackers to groupies.  Which was nice because then I can just blend in with
the crowd and enjoy the surroundings rather than having to deal with
obnoxious wannabes.  If you check out NY Times for day 2, you will see a
punkish looking fellow, he was in my group for capture the flag.  A
reporter also interviewed me but i didn't hear anything about again.  I'm too
tired at this point to go into much detail about it

I'll just quote from my wanna be web page about that.
<EXCERPT FROM HTTP://axon.jccc.net/~asmodian/>
   While attending a massive computer convention called Def. Con 6.0, A
   writer for the New York Times once scoffed at my choice to deny him my
   real name.  He said something to the effect of, "no wonder people get
   the wrong idea about hackers, they wont even give their real name."

   That really made me think.

   At first I felt bad, I wondered if he would put the quote in the
   paper, and then wondered how my parents would feel if they read the
   article.  Now that I reflect on the situation, I was right to remain
   anonymous.

   If you think about it, your name drags a lot of people along with it.
   Your first name is what every body knows you by.  Your middle name is
   what your parents know you by.  And then there's your last name which
   hauls the rest of your family into the picture.  So if you were an
   actor, you would choose a stage name, something that wouldn't haul the
   rest of your family with you into the spot light of the world.
   Some famous stage names are (insert weird symbol here) the artist
   formerly known as prince, Madonna,
   Walter Mathau ...etc.

< end EXCERPT>

Any way, I think I made a good choice in remaining anonymous.  If you
disagree by all means blast me an e-mail at asmodianx@hotmail.com.

I also hooked AEGIS my laptop into the capture the flag network, and it
survived.  On 4 Mb of ram I would have expected it to die, but it survived
and was relitivly un-hacked (except for 1 guest account which was captured
by shoulder surfing because they user was stupid.  not Bad for Slackware
Eh!?

-=- Window CE -=-
Something that you might want to keep in mind is to avoid plugging in power
hogging PC CARDS.  These little dudes tend to over heat when you start
sucking 1 amp, and thats WITH THE AC CORD!

As for the lateness of my articles, i must apologize, I put Debian 2.0 on
my home PC and in-advertantly fried my pub directory which houses my
submission archive... oops!?

                                      HiR 7
                            Axon's Defcon Experience
                                   Defcon 6.0

I sit here in this bizzarre place surrounded by psychadelic light shows, 
reflecting upon the past 2 days worth of events.  This is quite possibly the
best place to start my reflections, as I am totally immersed in techno music
at the Black & White ball, dressed in a three-peice suit and sunglasses.  When
we actually arrived in Vegas, it was a day early for the Con.  While lounging
around in the casino, we heard phone pages for Kevin Mitnick.  That was our
first clue in that the crew was already arriving.  There were several shady
figures hanging around the place already, in the pool, casino, in the halls,
etc.

Friday morning, the HiR crew arrived at the convention center in plenty of
advance.  We were among the first into the con.  We were all awestruck by
the amount of hardware for sale, and some pretty good deals.  There were
shirts for sale, stickers, magazines, modems, hard drives, radar guns,
geiger counters, tons of cellular phones with "EVIDENCE" stickers adorning
a good percentage of them.   People were scurrying to apply for an IP
address, and still more were already attaching the veins of life to their
laptops and other systems.  They already had techno pumping full force for
the con in the same room as all the hardware and booths.  

The first thing that actually surprised me was the number of middle-aged
hackers at the con, and how few of them were actally feds.  After that, I
was amazed at how many people actually knew their shit.  Sure, I was
approached by people who were eager to learn.  Newbies, but at least they
were eager, which makes any newbie worthwhile to talk to.  Most of the
lesser experienced entities there had a general additude of "So what do
you have to do to get to hackerdom?  Where can I find more information?  I
want to know how it works!" instead of the typical "how to i get root with
sendmail?  How do I screw up my enemy's box?  Damnit I wanna hack!"  I
really enjoyed the eagerness.

The first day there wasn't a whole hell of a lot of demonstrations.  There
was an okay demo on lockpicking, and some stuff on casinos.  Not a lot.  For
me it was more like a time to enlighten myself about what all was out there.
The scene in Kansas City is not nessecarily reflecting what the rest of the
underground world is up to.  It turns out that the KC scene is a tad bigger
than I had expected, as there was  a whole load of 913/816 people there.

As far as what I actually learned, I'm not sure any amount of typing or
talking will ever summarize it.  I learned so much more than just what was
demonstrated or talked about.  DefCon is something that one has to actually
experience to even comprehend.

Of course we weren't the only group there.  It seens that many people were
hanging out in their own little bands of like-minded hackers.  Some of the
groups were actually professionals, with a business structure.  Others were
just kind of there.  Many of these groups covered all their bases when it
came down to knowledge and skill.

Among the groups which I had quite a bit of contact with was the Hack Sec
Klahn.  They were selling card readers, barcode scanners, and various other
items.  Other groups that were there: 2600 (the magazine staff), L0pht
Heavy Industries, Cult of the Dead Cow, and many others.

One of the most memorable events was the grand release of Back Orifice.
The official announcement of a final product by the cDc.  There'll be an
article on it later.  Grandmaster Ratte startled the crowd with chanting,
screaming, and free M&M's coupons.

One thing to note, though, is the fact that you should never bomb out of
a seminar that covers a topic that you aren't interested in, just because
it shounds boring.  After all, it's only an hour of your life, maybe you
could learn some new ideas.  There were several tech talks that I wasn't
particularly thrilled about attending at first, but I ended up sticking
around, and picked up some cool information (like router passwords when
I was sitting through a mundane talk on how radio works in the Pirate
Radio thing)

All in all, the con was one of the most enlightening experiences I've had.
I picked up new tricks, new ideas, and new knowledge about what the rest
of the hacking, phreaking, underground, hamming psychos of the world are
up to now.

             Cross-platform fun with Virtual Networking Computing

                                   by Axon

First, I'd like to give you all some background info on a program called
VNC (Virtual Networking Computing).  It's produced by ORL (www.orl.co.uk).
VNC is a client-server application, with support for java over the web.
It was originally designed for the X window environment, allowing users to
remotely use X through another computer.  like PC Anywhere, for unix.  VNC
servers already exist for many flavors of unix, Windows 95, and there's an
alpha VNC server for Macintosh.  Viewers have been ported to many unices as
well as windows, DOS, Macintosh, OS/2, Palm Pilots, and even Windows CE 2.

I work in an environment which requires use of programs available only for
Windows 95, but i really prefer using my Linux workstation.  I'm not given
enough desk space for 2 monitors, keyboards, and mice, and neither one of
my systems enjoys monitor/keyboard switches.  A colleague of mine pulled up
Netscape one day, totally taking remote control of his office computer.  I
was floored. 

Always on the hunt for new information, I asked him what he was using, and
I could have never been prepared for what was about to come.  "VNC", or
Virtual Network Computing, was the answer.  It's a totally cross-platform
remote control program, sort of like PC Anywhere.  VNC Has servers for many
flavors of unix, Windows 95, and macintosh.  There are viewers for
*EVERYTHING*, including palmtops, palm pilots, all the OS's that the Server
can run on, and then some.  Even DOS!  In the X-Window System, VNC creates
a different display and uses that one, but with Mac and Win9x/NT, the VNC
server allows the remote client to TAKE OVER the mouse and keyboard of the
console.  Imagine the fun there... of course for Win9x and Mac, there is a
"Sit back and Watch" mode for the server, which doesn't allow the client do
take it over, which makes for a very good helpdesk application, allowing
remote technicians to watch what's happening as the user on the phone shows
them the problems, and since VNC uses TCP/IP, it works from anywhere on the
Internet/Intranet.

With the X-Window system, the VNC Server/Viewer combo can be a free
replacement for that bulky and expensive X-Server software for Windows,
Such as Hummingbird EXceed and Reflection X, and when you disconnect from
VNC and reconnect later, the screen doesn't change.  Your work stays put,
unlike X servers where applications close when you disconnect. VNC can't
take over an existing display in X-Window System, though.  It's ability to
go cross-platform (a viewer for one OS works on servers for any OS) makes
it even more useful for support technicians.

                       How to not get (physically) noticed
                                 by Frogman

	Here I will explore a few concepts to extend on HiR's "Mobile 
Hacking" series.  In addition to his ideas, I have a few of my own which 
may be of help.

Hiding in Plain Sight.

	This is a concept you may have heard about in relation to Ninjas and 
various government agencies. (the Alphabet Agencies should spring to mind)  
This involves looking like you are supposed to be there, and that you are 
not someone worth looking for.  How can you expect to be overlooked by a 
pursuer in a crowd if you are the only one there in black sweats with a back 
pack, while everybody else in in a tee-shirt and shorts?  A good idea is to 
be original enough so that you are not so normal you stand out, while also 
being forgettable enough not to be recognized.  Don't dress like a Goth and 
walk into Denny's.  Don't dress in a three-piece suit either.  Wear a tee-
shirt and jeans, or a polo-shirt.  Make like you're there to study your 
college material and have some coffee.  Who is going to think of you when 
the officer pulls by the restaurant slowly, looking in the windows.  If he 
enters and asks about suspicious characters, the Goth will get pointed to 
quickly.  The suit has less chance of this, but it would still be the same 
type of thing.

	One the same note, who would more likely be questioned by mall sec-
urity for using a coupler on a payphone?  The Goth of course.  Business men 
are respecable, and have business to do.  Goth's are strange teens who are 
probably up to no good.  I have had some experiences of this type.  I tend 
to be a polo-shirted semi-prep.

Scenario:
	On a payphone next to the restrooms, dialing into your ISP, and 
FTPing the latest HiR.  People coming and going, and all have some typical 
reactions.
     1.  The typical strange look.
     2.  The crazy woman "Help, help, Hackers!!!"
     3.  The envious GenX'r "Hey, cool!"
     4.  The Security Guard "Pardon me, but you aren't allowed to do that 
	 from mall phones."
     5.  The interested stare and disbelieving giggle of the girl on the pay
	 phone next to you, as she explains to Theresa that she is missing 
	 one of the coolest sites at the mall in a month.

	The Goth would get the security guard and crazed woman almost for 
sure.  The suit would get the strange looks.  While your average tee/polo-
shirted Joe would get the envy and respect.

	As Axon explained, carry the least equipment you need to get the 
job done.  A way to hide that equipment without bulky pockets is a crotch 
pocket.  Cut a hole in a hip pocket, or try splitting the seam in the inside 
upper thigh on a pair of loose, but not extremely baggy pants.  Sew in a 
custom pocket for the piece of equip. you intend to hide, and install either 
a narrow tooth zipper, or eyelet hooks.  If you are skillful, you could try 
swappable pockets.  The pockets could simply be attatched with eyelets, and 
an eyeletted opening.  Snaps may also work, but they need more force, and 
are noisier.  If the equip. causes a noticeable sag, use a belt, and run 
support cords to it, or tie the pocket the your thigh with a cord or strap.  
The main downfall of this is obvious: How and where to get your stuff out.  
If you are going to use a payphone near a bathroom, make a quick pit stop.  
If you are in a restraunt, you can take it out under the table.  Just try 
not to look like you are playing with yourself.

Frogman's Layered/Morphing Theory of Concealment

	This is a very good way to enter/exit the scene of the target.  Make 
the entry to the scene in one outfit.  Do some buisness on the scene, then 
go to the restroom or such and either change clothes with some you brought 
(ie. in a briefcase), or, wear layered clothes.  A pair of shorts under 
pants, or two pairs of pants.  A short sleeved shirt under a long sleeved, 
or the long under the short, with the sleeves pulled out of sight.  If you 
are using the layered and not completly changing clothes, you can be out of 
one set and ready to go in less than a minute, and back in the same.  To 
change clothes, pullovers, and zippered pants are fastest/best.  Hopefully, 
you could do buisness in one set, then make a bathroom run and change.  Go 
do your shady biz quickly, change back, and return to the first buisness.  
If you are quick, all you seemed to do was make a run to the restroom.  A 
pair of convertable cargo pants works well.  These have zippered legs that 
can come off to become shorts.  This reduces the need for somewhat baggy 
pants to cover the shorts/other pants.

Scenario:
	A person wearing trousers and a long sleeved flannel shirt is seen 
entering the building.  He goes to a desk, and fills out some dated forms.  
He thens asks where he can find a restroom.  Someone reports seeing a 
stranger in shorts and a tee-shirt messing with the phone box.  The flannel 
and trousers leaves, having completed some other buisness in the building.  
With an alabi and a different identity, the same person did both.  He imple-
mented the layered/morphing theory.  He has proof that, yes officer, he was 
in the building at the time the phone box messing was going on, but he was 
busy filling forms, the whole time.  Well, except the five mins he was in 
the rest room.  Plus, what he wore that day doesn't fit with what the sus-
pect was wearing...

	Now, I'm not advocating running around commiting crimes using these
methods of concealment, but I have had times where I need to get something
done, and didn't have a reasonable excuse to just walk in and do it.  If a
guard saw me doing some things that I know are perfectly legal, I know I 
would be stopped and be made an embarrasing scene of while he checks with
his boss.  This is what I am trying to put forth.  If you are going to
trash a site, but there are alot of people, these methods can be employed
as a quick way to disappear.

                         Making a 2 phone line adapter
                                  by Frogman   

        Ah, the added wonderment of a second line.  Fax machine, data line,
Dual modems, three way confrence on each line, five people at once.. <g>
But wait, how am I going to install all this stuff?  I've got a student
budget for home improvement of 0 dollars and 0 cents.  I also have no
flexibility to rewire the phone jacks all the way through the house to
get two seperate lines.  I have to use a double line cord with equipment
that recognizes only line one.

        I solved my little dilemma by remembering that I can just cut the
cord and swap wires.  This a technical kludge and is not all that elegant.
I started sifting through the piles of obscure equipment I keep on hand for
just these types of situations.  

Axon has seen some of my wierd junk in the Frog lair:

An ancient amber monochrome text display, great for use as a dumb terminal.
An original Amiga 1000 system, complete with an IBM emulator Sidecar box.
Piles of obsure connectors, like several DB-23's, large DIN8's, DIN6's...
Old, old, old palmtop -- Panasonic's Hand Held Computer (HHC) circa 1983.
A couple almost useless MFM/RLL/ESDI drives.
A souped IBM PC-XT -- 286 accell, card slots filled out the wazoo...
And alot of phone junk.

     And in my various and sundry phone junk pile, I had nothing that simply
split a four wire line into a pair of single lines.  I resigned to the fate
of skipping the Radio Shack box for $7 and decided to hack a box of my own
from spare parts.

        I keep several of those breakout boxes that turn one RJ jack into
two around, they are invaluable.  I found out how much more when I popped
one open and looked inside.  They are built with wires running from the
input side to both outputs.  These magic wires are nicely color coded like
a standard phone cable!  The first thing you should check is that there are
eight wires in there.  Yes eight, two wires for each line, two pairs for
each of the two jacks.  If you only have four, then you are outta luck.
The only other problem is that sometimes they get the colors for each line 
backwards, but that doesn't really matter, as long as the pairs match up.

        To do my hack, I had to figure out how to get those wires out,
swap them around, and get the whole thing back together in the nice beige
unit.  This means no cutting and soldering/taping the wires.  If you look at
how your box is built you will see the ways it is held together.  On the
sides of the box are four square holes, through which you push a pen or
paper clip to release the prongs that hold the unit together.  Once the two
parts release, the only things holding them together are the wires.  Where 
they meet the two jacks, there are some nice, removable inserts that hold
the wires in the proper order and position.  To get these inserts out, the
makers, understanding phreaker needs, provided slots on the front, under
each jack, that if you slide a screw driver or a paper clip in they come
right out.  For this hack, just take out one insert.  Unbend the wires,
pull them out of the holes, noting what went where, and swap colors.  Swap 
red for black, and green for yellow.  Bend the wires back, and replace the 
insert.  Snap the box together, and you are almost done.  You must remember 
to label which side has line one, and which side has line two.

        See, it's that easy!  You start out with a $2-$3 box, and hack it in
five minutes into a $7 box!  Now, just plug it into the wall recpticle.
Decide what you want for line one use, and jack it up.  Do the same for line
two.  The magic of this approach is that it is completely reverseable, will
not get accidentally torn apart (in most calm, non-moshpit type homes), and
is easily removed and taken with you when you move, unlike rewiring the 
entire place.

Late Issue...
-=-=-=-=-=-=-
HiR 7 was REALLY late this time around, due to a lot of really messed up
stuff.  We're sorry for keeping ya guys on hold for so long.  Axon can't
write as much as he used to be able to, due to more hours, and a job that
actually requires some work (rather than sitting there typing articles on
the job.  =] )  Classes have kicked back in for Frogman and Asmo... But
HiR will still kick out information.  We aren't dead... just overworked.

NEW URL
-=-=-=-
okay, folks... ml.org is broken.  It's *very* broken.  And Axon moved
again.  This time, to his workstation.  the new URL is:

http://axon.jccc.net/hir/

Just in case you couldn't tell, Axon has full control of this server.
It'll also be the place to find homepages of HiR members.  Also, the
articles and software are all available from there via anonymous ftp.
