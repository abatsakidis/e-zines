		      reflections on the coming of ostara


	The first sabbat of my coming Wiccan experience. Also the last day of
class prior to "Spring Break", a wonderfully PC term for "Easter Vacation",
i.e., the Christian bastardization of a holy pagan festival.

	But this is nothing new. The traditions and customs of every major
Christian holiday came directly from the festivities of the cultures they
raped with their dogma. Ostara to Easter. Beltane to May Day. Samhain to
Halloween. Yule to Christmas. Even the so-called "revolutionary" doctrine
of "peace" (except to non-believers, of course) comes from the Wiccan Rede.
Harm none. But even that was perverted. Now it's about power and money,
politics and repression.

	But a few delusional weaklings mustn't be allowed to obscure the
meaning of the season. The beginning of Spring, when Goddess gives us life
again, through her replenishing fruits. Spring is rebirth and restoration.
Beauty. The animals come back out, the sun returns, the cycle begins anew.

	Blessed be.
