				let's make lsd!


Materials required:

  Baking soda (Arm & Hammer works well),  15g
  Apple Cider Vinegar (Heinz makes this), 25mL
  Liquid Ammonia (used for cleaning),     100mL
  Liquid Bleach (also used for cleaning), 250mL
  A moldy piece of bread (prepare in advance)
  One large mixing bowl (Tupperware works)


Procedure:

(WARNING, THIS CAN BE DANGEROUS IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. WE
 SUGGEST THAT YOU READ THIS FILE ALL THE WAY THROUGH AT LEAST ONCE BEFORE
 YOU ATTEMPT TO MAKE LSD. ALL STEPS MUST BE FOLLOWED EXACTLY AS EXPLAINED
 IN THIS FILE.)

 1. Pour the Baking Soda into the mixing bowl.

 2. Pour the Ammonia into the mixing bowl.

 3. Scrape the mold off of the bread, and deposit a pinch (about 1g) into
    the mixing bowl.

 4. Pour the vinegar into the bowl -- THIS WILL CAUSE BUBBLING AS THE
    TRIGLYCERIDES BEGIN TO REACT WITH THE LYSERGICA IN THE MOLD. DO NOT
    BE ALARMED. (Although we suggest that you don't let it bubble over
    and get on your carpet.)

 5. Once the solution has stopped bubbling, this is where the important
    part comes in. You will be making gaseous LSD, and it is very important
    that you do not waste any, as LSD made using this process is nowhere
    near as powerful as that you can buy on the street, so more is required
    for a good buzz. Now, move the bowl into a room like your bathroom, and
    close the door, and also the window. Here you will be adding the bleach,
    which will begin the final reaction.

 6. Pour the bleach into the solution. You will immediately see a gaseous
    vapor rising from the bowl. THIS IS YOUR LSD! :-) Lean your head over
    the bowl, and begin inhaling deeply. Be sure to hold the vapor in, so
    that it has time to interact with the atria in your lungs. Continue
    inhaling until it kicks in, which should hopefully be within ten minutes.

(Warning: You may feel a little light-headed during this. This may be
 disconcerting if you have never done LSD before, but it indicates that
 you did the process right and it is starting to kick in.)

 7. Enjoy! We suggest you have some toys around that are bright and shiny;
    a well-oiled, well-polished pistol makes an excellent toy, as you can
    look down the barrel and imagine yourself falling through space, only
    a millimeter wide.
