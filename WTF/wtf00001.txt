			       why another zine?

     I shall present my reasonings behind another zine in the form of a
dialog, between you, the idiot, and me:


I: Why another hate-filled zine?

M: Because maybe, possibly, someone out there with the slightest bit of
   intelligence, unlike yourself, might relate. Or it might be just be
   some more self-administration of therapy, which is cheaper and much
   more interesting than the commonalities of sex and drugs.

I: Who are you?

M: I'm a full time college student at the high schoool with ashtrays known
   as College Of The Sequoias. I wear blue Levi's 501s, black steel-toed 
   workboots, black teeshirts with various Anarchist Sayings(tm) on them, 
   and a green and blue flannel. I look like a reject from a Mudhoney video. 
   I don't stick out. 6'1", really thin, I blend in well with you mindless 
   fucks, which is good, because that's all the less I must interact with 
   blatant ignorance.

I: Who killed the King of Rock N Roll? Tell me, I just got to know.

M: "Not I," said little Lisa Marie. "I loved him, and he loved me. He was
   my dad, legitmately. He named his airplane after me. When I get all of
   his money, I'll give it to $cientology.


End of interview. Time for French II class.
