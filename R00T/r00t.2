my bust by, gweeds.


I know I talked to a lot of you about this but I need to make this clear 
before I start anything: I didn't mean to lie to any of you.  I was 
waiting until r00t-news #2 before I said anything.

Corporeal and I are under investigation for what appears to be access 
device fraud.  Some other members of l0ck were half-involved, but so far 
they haven't gotten any mail and we don't think they will.  Anyways, 
on to the bust.

Corp and I were over at my place alone one night in January.  We'd been 
hanging out for a while when I got into my bathrobe and punched some 
digits on my new 900 portable..  We'd forgotten to call Eric Corley 
earlier so we phoned the guy up.  We had to talk about some 2600.com 
business.

It was pretty late at night, and we were kind of surprised when Eric told 
us he'd just gotten home.  But he sounded serious and we weren't sure 
what was really up.

As it turns out, he'd just gotten the word from sdsc.edu (see last 
article) that Shimomura was pissed as hell (forgot to divert from max q's 
2600 acct) that we'd fucked with him, and that he was going to be 
busted.  Didn't take long for the feds to swing in to action, either: 
corp and i woke up to two guns pointed at our respective faces.  All my 
shit is gone, but luckily, since corp wasn't home, they left his house 
alone.

I just wanted to tell you all what was going on with l0ck: if you don't 
see any more released of our magazine, that's why.
