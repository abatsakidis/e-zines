******************************************************************************

          r00t in association with t3 productions proudly present:

				r00t t-shirts

Yes that's right, you too can own and proudly wear a t-shirt from the 
most elitest "group" on the Internet.  These t-shirts are no half-assed 
silk-screen deal.  These shirts are 100% pure cotton (Beefy T's) and 
never shrink or get lame after a year.  You too can proudly wear this  
elite shirt on your pestilent back and show people your stylish ways. 

These shirts are created using digital offset and custom transparencies 
that are heat-pressed onto the shirt.  The ink melts *into* the shirt, 
not *on top* of the shirt, and the color *never* bleeds or fades (unless 
you don't know how to wash clothes).

"Okay okay, but what do they say?"  Well I'm glad you asked.  These are 
minimalists t-shirts, as in, they don't say much.  On the front it reads 
in large black print:

				r00t

(witty, eh?)

and on the back it reads:

(on the very top)- "we're all idiots." - including the quotes.
(on the very bottom)- "but we own you." - also in quotes.

You have two choices of shirt color: white and beige.  If you are 
familiar with this process, you understand why we can't print onto black 
t-shirts.  If you aren't, try getting a clue.

The shirt sizes come in medium, large, and xtra large.  These shirts 
shrink only a LITTLE bit after a wash.  So if you're a regular guy (ie: 
not fat), you should consider getting a large. 

As for cost:  If you are not a r00t member (chances are, you're not.  And 
don't ask to join either), the cost is TEN bucks.  Money order or 
*CONCEALED* cash.  No checks, no credit cards, no bullshit.

If you *are* a r00t member then the cost is 6 bucks.  This is exact cost 
of the t-shirts (4 bucks) and the transfer (2 bucks).

Shipping: one dollar.

Mail to:

Red Dye/r00t
5 Greenview Avenue
Princeton, NJ  08540

Money orders payable to Alex Swain.  Dig?

Give two weeks to get your shirt.

There are VERY limited supplies of these shirts.  I suggest emailing me 
prior to sending away for one.  t3@escape.com.

And if you think it couldn't get more elite.  Tsutomu Shimomura hates us.

 your group "r00t" and your attempts at accessing our systems

 skills but I would like you to realize that what you are doing is 
 illegal.
        
 You have pointed out several (trivial) weak points in tigerfish, and I
 have since fixed and secure them.
 
 This is a formal warning to you:  If you should choose to work
 your way into my systems again, you will not be receiving email

 You will be receiving a call from the FBI.  I'm sure you're familiar with 
 them.

For Public Release


		r00t Announces Involvement with IRA

On Monday, infamous hacking and computer terrorism group "r00t" announced
it's envolvement with Sinn Fein, the political party of the Irish 
Republican Army.  

In an interview Monday, spokesperson Ypcat said, "They are good at fighting a 
conventional battle, but they needed us for a different kind of war."  

Ypcat, known only by his handle, went on to say that r00t was 100% devoted
to the IRA's battle for freedom.  "We will do anything in our vast power to
put the brittish back where they belong, and keep them out of where they
don't.", says Ypcat.

In Washington, the Department of Defense reports that it is not yet ready to 
respond to electronic warfare assaults.  According to Kevin Bacon, DoD 
spokesman, U.S. forces have just begun planning data warfare units, but 
these units aren't due to be manned until the year 2003.

Meanwhile, United Kingdom network providers report increasing problems
maintaining network connectivity.  "We feel it is sunspot activity," remarked
one systems administrator, "There's no way anyone can hack our network."

r00t officials maintain that they are indeed responsible for the United 
Kingdom's network troubles, and Ypcat warns that, "this is just the tip of
the iceberg."

Digital Systems security advisory: November 27, 1995 08:14:00

This is an interoffice memo meant for distribution to only those 
authorized engineers and security techs. for the B division.

Roger C. Sykes (roger@ds1.diderot.digital.com)

Hackers identified as "slick, buttery ones" have managed to enter through our
dt8 gateway (our primary firewall) by using an old, outdated method of ip 
fragmentation called Tiny Fragmentation.  Please refer to memo A-8B72 for 
further information on this method.

These hackers while connected erased a great deal of information, 
primarly from the /tmp directory.  Proprietary source was not taken but a 
few copies of our Netscape multi-license contract were ftp'd back to a 
host at: digital-gw1.pa-x.dec.com (204.123.0.241).  This is obviously our 
gateway.

Upon further investigation we noticed that they had compromised root on 
the gateway machine by using an (unknown to us) rlogin bug.  However, we 
contacted CERT and they sent us the proper patch to fix this.  These 
intruders, known as the group "r00t" were using our gateway as a trusted 
machine to violate other hosts.

As a security precaution we have closed off all of our outside 
connections past our firewall-1 (.38) until we have analyzed and patched 
these holes.

Dan Risco will be heading this investigation.  If you should find any 
bizarre activity on your system, please notify him (danr@digital.com) or 
by pager by emergency (xxx-xxx-xxxx).

As for this group, we have heard that these intruders are not a malicious 
group, so much as a group that likes to, as they put it, "play".  The 
following is an example of their tactics we have monitored on hobbes and 
delilah from Friday (18:42) to Sunday (21:08):

For now our machines are secure.  We have commented out the telnet port 
(23) on every machine.  Therefore there is absolutely NO way they can 
enter back in.  Granted, this is a hard workaround for us, but if we all 
work together, we should be able to solve this quite quickly.
