-After much thought and planning a decision of TGR's future was made.  This
is the last TGR.....to appear alone!  (No, calm down, you'll still be able to
get the scene's most reliable source for true, unbiased, honest reviews) It's
just going to be found somewhere different.  Reality Check Network, now up to
their 12th issue, will now be the new home for TGR.  Every Sunday, including
this one, TGR will be found in it's own section of RCN.  So now, along with
the best game review, you'll get a packed filled issue of latest group news,
interviews, polls, and so much more!  Please don't write to me asking what
happened to INQ.  INQ is not dead, but due to the fact that it is MOST LIKELY
they won't release on a weekly basis, TGR would have no appropriate place in
their mag.  I wish INQ best of luck in the future, & thank them for carrying
TGR in the past.  (Ok, you're done reading, you can go read the reviews now!)

*For the most part most of you liked the new way of displaying the info about              
the games (with the diz).  So unless I get an overwhelming amount of
complaints about the format, it will stay this way!

The nfo says you need Win/V to run this, but it ran fine in regular winblows.
However, I don't speak Japanese, except for sushi, honda, and habachi, so it
makes it kind of hard to play an adventure game based mostly on dialect.  But
don't worry, you aren't missing much from the looks of the game.

A _TEC_ exlusive!
Johnny Bazookatone
From ARC/US Gold
A Stryper/Nogroup release
-They only WISH this platform game could compare to Rayman, as stated it
could in the .nfo.  It's your typical platform game with your guy with a gun.
He runs, he shoots, but he doesn't score.  Your Johnny Bazookamotherfucka,
you got this weird bazooka gun, that you can play like a guitar sometimes, &
then it emits a huge blast.  The bad thing is, in order to get this to work
crash-free you need to turn off all the sounds (music and fx).  So in setup,
put no soundcard, and then when you load the game up, make sure it's on no
sounds again.  The graphics are ok, but we've seen better, and this game just
isn't put together very well.

°±²Û - DUKE NUKEM 3D v1.0 -- Shareware - Û²±°
°±²Û ---  by 3D Realms Entertainment --- Û²±°
"It makes every PC game we've seen, DOOM
included, look dull. Honestly!" Ä PC Gamer.
Duke blows away everything you know about 3D
action games. Blow thru walls, jetpack over
buildings, fight underwater--all in a truly
interactive game like you have *never* seen.
Supports SVGA modes, multiplay, most game
contollers.  Music by Bobby (DOOM) Prince.
Now, go kick-butt in futurustic Los Angeles!
- Well we already told you about this one last week.  Apogee released the
official SW version with a few additions, such as counting how many times you
played (might be a limit), and lots of little things.  Here's the review from
last week in case you missed it:
       "WOW!  Move over doom, move over quake, make way way for the classic.
Although just a beta <and sw> this game KICKS ASS.  If you have the computer
to put in SVGA and a good graphics mode you'll love this.  Pretty soon you'll
be saying "Doom?, what's that?".  Perhaps it's the fact that the game <1st
episode> takes place in a real life area, rather than those boring and stupid
catacombs we've been drowned with.  Your in the city, but the one bad thing
is that Apogee is still using monsters, I mean why couldn't they make it all
different types of gangsters or something.  When's the last time you saw a
monster in the city (no, that big fat lard was still human).  Anyway, you can
take a piss, watch a porn flick, and blow up motherfuckers and watch their
blood splatter on the walls.  This game appears to have it all.  Now if you
will excuse me, I need to go find some dramamine.
                        RATING: 83/100 (Yes, even though it's SW)"
        Some other cool things I noticed was when you get to the level with
the bar, theres lot of cool stuff to see and do.  You can pay the bitches to
shake their tits at the nudie bar.  You can watch the OJ Bronco chase on
the tv in the far corner in the bar <as long as you don't blow it out first>.
Also, you can easily replenish your health by blowing up a toilet, or fire-
hydrant and then simply using the open door button to drink the water.

This contains avi's of the following: That old dude saying "Beavis and Butt-
head are not rolemodels, they're not even human...", The opening part where
they are in the circles, and a quicky episode at the Mcwhatever place they
work at, where Todd comes in and kicks their ass.  This group says they plan
on releasing the .wav's which would be nice, and make for a complete game.

ARCADE AMERICA (7th Level) [00/61]
  - Full CD - demos have been RiPped!
  - Plays off your hard drive.
  - Humorous Action/Platform game.
  - 10,000+ frames of movie quality anim.
  - View the NFO file within for details!
  - A Chowdery independent release.
Yup, a whopping 61 disks, 125 megs once installed.  Is it worth it?  Depends,
if you like this type of game, but personally I can't picture anyone over the
age of 12 wanting to play this.  Your an animated character on your quest to
find someone or get somewhere, one of those, and you have to do little games
and puzzles in which you avoid characters and other boring stuff.  It's not
exactly go shoot guys and stuff.  Each time you get past the level you move
up to some other kind of puzzle or something of the sort.  Nothing special,
but very nicely done with the humor (if ya got half a brain to get the jokes)
and graphics.  If you got a little brother and sister and 125 megs free doing
nothing, then you might want to be nice and get them this.  It is a little
hard and sometimes frustrating though.  Also make sure you get the 5.9 meg
fix that includes a file which was missing b/c they incorrectly numbered the
arj files in the zips <missed 45>.

Not only did the intro go slow as hell, but picking the player moved slow as
hell too.  Then when I tried to play it, it was missing some texture file.
Looks like someone needs to do a lot of work.

NFL QuarterBack Club '96 *REPACKAGED* [XX/25]
Well the first version to get on the net had plenty of arj errors to last you
a lifetime.  But this one works fine.  An extremely good football game if you
have the computer to handle it.  The normal 320 graphic modes on a 486 makes
the game JUST playable, so I'd reccomend a pentium/90 for it too look any-
where near decent and playable at the same time.  It's got the usual football
seasons, and an addition of a simulation of classic/historical games.  It's
got touchdown dancing, in your face sacking, audibles, and anything else you
could want from a football game.  If you got the computer (Above 486/66), it
is worth it, but if you don't, it might not be worth the effort.

I couldn't figure out most of the controls, because there's nothing to config
your keyboard with.  So rather than trying to get my plane off the ground, I
picked the quick action.  It looks like any other normal flight sim, the gfx
are nothing great the sound is way below average.  It's not too good, but it
might satisfy you if you love sims.

-That's it for this week, hope it was of help.
-Don't forget to continue getting RCN every Sunday if you wish to read TGR                              
plus many other great articles and information.
-This week's list is a little short, and I realize there are still some Win95
games I have yet to review.  Trust me, I'm getting to them, and as soon as I
get my network up & running, they will be reviewed the week of their release.
