-Rating scale:
                 (0-19)/100 = In a nutshell, it sucked!
                (20-39)/100 = Still crap but slightly better.
                (40-49)/100 = Possibly worth downloading.
                (50-69)/100 = Pretty decent game. Might want to check it out.
                (70-79)/100 = Worth the download if you like that type.
                (80-89)/100 = Very good, 9 outta 10 its worth the download.
                (90-99)/100 = Excellent game, a MUST download.
                    100/100 = HOLY SHIT I'VE NEVER SEEN A BETTER GAME!

RATINGS are based on the game idea, graphics, sound, playability, ingenuity,
versatility, and a lot of other words ending in `ity'.  These games are based
on what happens on MY COMPUTER ONLY, unless stated otherwise.  I always first
follow .nfo directions, and if those don't work or are not available, I then
try other ways.  So just b/c it doesn't work for me, doesn't mean it won't
work for you.

This game sucks.  It's a combo of RPG and Doom style.  But it's more confusion
than anything else.  There's no music, only sfx, and they suck.  The graphics 
are horrible.  Unless you adore ugly looking, shitty designed games, then
don't bother.

Piece of shit doom clone.  Disgusting purple and green colors.  Stupid weap-

because you walk into them and then they open and it's just retarded because
you have to wait.  Garbage.

Another shitty game for the week.  This is a terrible pinball game, the engine
of it sucks.  The ball even fucking got stuck on my goddamn flipper, and I
couldn't move it, and you can't shake the table.  It's real lame, and you
won't enjoy it.

Uhhh yeah.. Like if you leech this I'll call YOU a twigger. I ain't even gonna
justify this thing with a reason. I asked Ion, and he said he was pretty sure
this was a real release. What a waste of fucking space. I've seen better games
coded in 64k of memory on my C64.

This is the epitomy of SUCK.

POINTS: 5 -The lowest score I've ever given a working release.

                [xx/36]
-Filenames: I76APH??.ZIP
It won't let even install the game unless you have;
Pentium 90, 16 megs Ram, Win 95 and 1 meg Ram on ya video card.
You need roughly 230 megs depending on which option you install, but once you
nuke the install files, the "full" install is 125 megs.

Special notes:
Two things to keep in mind, when the install is finally done you need to fix
the shortcut.  Originally it's set to "splash.exe" which always crashes, so
change it to "I76.exe" which is in the same dir.  Then launch the game.  Once
you start setup the options, since it's an alpha, the steering settings are
messed up, only thing I noticed so far is you have to switch the buttons for
the steering, change the left to right and vice versa.  Sometimes during the
game it might mess up the controls again, don't ask me why.  When you start
the game, there's no sound, so right when you hit the main menu, smack the ESC
key and they'll come on.

The Game:
I played it for only a few minutes, so far your training in a car, driving 
around and shooting things, but later on, as I remember it from the adver-
tisement at the store, you get out and walk around and shit.  But I may be
wrong, it has been a while that I seen that ad.  The GFX rock in this game, if
you've got 2MB of VRam, turn it up and enjoy, otherwise I haven't tested it
with the detail turned down.  The sounds need some work, it's one guys voice
talking, before he says the line it says the name of the person that he's
supposed to be.  You have to keep in mind it's an alpha and the guy probably
did this one late night on his own.  As for the game controls, they're your
typical "flighing simulator game", there are a LOT, but you get used to using
them as you play along.  The controls are pretty basic, driving is smooth and
killing and blowing up trucks and shit is pretty cool.  The game at this
point, the "alpha" stage isn't worth the download since it has WAY too many
bugs.  But keep a lookout for the FINAL, this one will definately be worth
getting.

Well, this is kind of a weird game.. Kinda stupid, some of the grafix weren't
that great either. The object is to go around and collect nuts. No man, not 
choopin em off, but the kind of nuts on trees. You're a squirrel, (or what's 
called a "squeezil" in here..) so you do squirrelish things. Climb trees, jump
from branch to branch, fall out of trees (and somehow always manage to live),
slide down branches, etc.. The grafix were all polygon shaped with some flat 
.bmps thrown in for good measure. Sounds pretty shitty huh? Yulp, thought so.
Heh, anyway, I think I'll be like a squirrel, and nut. (err sumthin)

out Interstate 76 Alpha Release, but you've been warned, it's an Alpha.
