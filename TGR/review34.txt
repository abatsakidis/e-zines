try other ways.  So just b/c it doesn't work for me, doesn't mean it won't
work for you.

"Holy Cow" -Phil Rizuto.  Yes, Holy Cow, holy pigs, and HOLY SHIT.  Man, this
game is sweet as sugar.  It's by far the best baseball game out, and for those
who like arcade type baseball games, rather than the sim, this one is the
best ever.  This game has it all as do many baseball games.  The game play is
quick, to the point, and has great sound effects and announcer <yes it really
has an announcer in the 45 disks, no addons>.  The announcer also doesn't
just say lame ass like "Now batting 1st baseman".  No sir, he says the name
of the player, sometimes comments if he has scored a run and stuff like that.
Anyone w/ at least a 486 can run this game, b/c it has a nice low resolution
mode, that at first may seem crappy, but you'll soon see it ain't that bad.
Those of you with p/75+ will be able to experience the beautiful high resol-
ution graphics that make this game even more exciting to play.  It even has
modem play and serial play.  Home run derby of course, season of course, and
all of the types of play you could think of.  Real players, real teams, and
real stats.  This is as close as we've gotten to a really good baseball game
that was actually a GAME and not so statistical.  It's not impossible to hit
the ball, and the game follows no "boring nintendo like" patterns where you
can always steal or stuff like that (I've actually even been able to pick off
the computer from first base, when it had a big lead).  This game is without
a doubt, a must for anyone looking for sports or baseball games, and a defi-
nite worth checking out for others, unless you despise sports.  Easy to
install, no subst, it's what we here in `Reviewland' wish everything was like.
So go grab your mit, your bat, and oh, bring your balls <G>.

This is one of the lesser quality war games.  It's a simple map of the flags
and they move towards each other and you get to have the fun of controlling
the supplies and people, etc.  This one ain't too hot, lot's of different
settings inside the game, but it's pretty plain and basic looking.  Sound
like went off after the opening for some reason.  Looks pretty boring, if you
find yourself playing this for more than 5 minutes on a friday or saturday
night, call 1-800-DR-KEVORKIAN and ask about the special "Fast Serve" plan.

TOTAL MELTDOWN (c) Sierra            [xx/48]
Bad BAD BAD Prestige!  Naughty naughty!  Yuck, this is not only freeware, but
it is crap too (oh wait those are the same thing).  This is a collection of
addon shit for DN3D.  It's got shitload of .maps, most of which were already
released in Nuke It and other misc. packagings.  It include's an install
which doesn't work and stuff, and a shitty program to view levels, which sucks
balls anyway.  This is just a plain out waste of time.  It includes also some
animations, but it tells you nothing about how to run it, and there is just
so much crap in this, that it takes up like 170 megs, (even though when I del.
it, I had 333 more megs) and it's a total waste of space and time to d/l.
Even if you're a die hard DN3D fan, don't waste your precious life.

This review brought to you by the letter C, K, and a close friend of Z, Mr. Y.
This game closely compares to C&C, but it just lacks the faster paced action
that C&C has.  The game, although could easily made better by some faster
movement of the characters <and it has nothing to do with the cpu, they are
just designed to move only a certain amount of space per time> and maybe a
little more close up action.  The game has two people, you and the computer,
and your job is to take over sections of the land and build up an army, get
weapons and vehicles etc.  Once you've done so <or you could just go straight
for it> you try to knock down the enemies fort.  Also, the movement of the map
is pretty damn slow too, and the controlling of it is a pain in the ass when
you have people all over the map and you are trying to move them a little
further down past where the screen shows (you can use the zoomed out map, but
it's still a pain in the ass).  Plus every time you click on one of your guys
it centers the screen, pain.  The robots (they are the ones who fight) talk
to you on videophone and say stuff like "What the hell is wrong with you, I
said we are under attack."  Sometimes they will give you an attitude, if for
example, you tried to send one soldier after a huge tank, it will say "Are you
crazy?" or "No way!" but it will still of course do it.  The game could be a
lot better if they just made it more fast paced.  But if you don't mind wait-
ing 1-2 mins for your guy to go from your side to the other, than by all means
try this one out.  It certainly isn't on the C&C level, but it tries to be.

Wow I was impressed by the looks of this game.  Although it's more fighting
than it was using your brain, it's still a good game.  How can you describe
this one, well, picture it this way, you know how in Alone in the Dark you
could fight, well that's what this game is like, except it's on a better game
engine, better fighting, and better graphics.  This game amazed me because
it runs smoothly on anything (486+) in the top notch gfx mode.  It's really
fun to play, but there are only a few levels because of the large size.  Also
don't use the Reflux installer, I think it's set for *.r* and so it goes in
a loop, do it manually.  This game is one worth checking out if you like those
3D looking games and wish they had more action to it.  Although the game gets
boring, it's still a nice step in technology and looks cool to show off to
people.  There was also an animation pack, which will get it's review in next
issue.  Great game, but lacks the umph (more levels) that the CD would have.
Also, once I got to the level "European Middle Age - Level 1" I would keep
on beating it and it would just take me back to that, seems like the ending
is not there or there is none.  Here are two passwords, apparently the only
ones you can get from playing this rip:  VSINSYEA and TWXPPGGA or RDDXBPGA.
                                RATING: 77/100

Not enough time to get Olympic game, will be in next issue.

If you got into tetris you might like this. It wasted about 15 mins of my 
time though, which is about 10 more than I thought it would. The game is 
almost exactly like tetris, as far as the shit dropping out the top goes, but 
it drops animals and food instead of shapes. Only certain animals eat certain 
food and the more food they eat the more points you get. Kinda hard to 
explain, so either screw it, or leech it to find out. The grafix were a 
little better than average for a game like this, and the midis were cool too. 
2 player mode was also included, like side by side Dr.Mario. Be sure to get 
the .dll fixpak for this too. 

** Points: 61 -After all, it's only 3 disks, especially if you like tetris.

 SLIDERS FOR WIN '95 (c) MALACHITE [X/2]
Heh.. A nifty little game for a 4 year old maybe. I dunno why NPM released 
this, Slippin?? At any rate, it's just like those little slider puzzle games 
ya used to get at the doc's office for not cryin when he jams that 6" needle 
in your ass. The only thing that halfway didn't suck was that it uses 64k or 
16M color mode, and you can load your own bitmaps. Otherwise pretty useless 
junk.

** Points: 20 -If you have a brain. 79 -If you're 4 years old.

Another SimXXXX type of game, but I like this one for some reason. Maybe 
because there's combat stuff in it too? Maybe cuz there's a different type of 
strategy involved? Dunno. There's definately alot of stuff to do (and for me, 
to fuck up..heh) The main goal in this is to build up your technologies, 
while keeping your ppl fed and happy, not running out of resources, and not 
getting waxed by your competitors. I picked a crappy race when I started, 
and my competitors got alot more colonists than I did. Ya gotta have alot of 
colonists for a fast growing empire. I had a little trouble trying to do 
stuff, but a nice help system wasn't ripped in case you can't figure out how 
to do something. The music is pretty cool, the grafix are about like any 
other SimXXX game, and netplay wasn't ripped either. A little side note, 
Ionizer couldn't get this to work on his win31 box, it says it will under 
Win32s in the nfo, so I dunno if the nfo is correct on that. No problems 
installing in 95 tho, just run Razor's supah hax0red Setup.exe. WinG and the 
Adobe .pdf reader were included too. All in all, I can pretty much say that 
this game seems to be SimCity taken to a new and interesting level. Nice 
game. (from someone who barfs at the word SimShitty)
-Ionizer's note: .NFO said it would run in win3.1, but it didn't.

** Points: 25 -Not a miissprint see next review.

               IRQ57
Deadlock - Minimal-RIP               [04/04]
-This is what IRQ57 had to say about this release:

                        ****** RELEASE NOTES ******

      "Another Stripped down release from us, Deadlock was released by
       Razor on 29 disks. We give it to you on 4.

       We have ripped out the music (not the sfx) and the Mplayer/Ten
       Internet packs, so you can't play this version over internet.
                        ***************************"
Ok, same game, no music, no netplay. Minus 25 disks. What gives?! I played 
this for about 2.5 hours, no bugs, nothing wrong with it. Just 25 fucking 
disks smaller. No setup shit, just click on the exe and play. I'd like to 
give IRQ57 my Kick Fucking Ass Award for the MONTH on this one. Keep rippin 
the rips guys, dunno wtf you are, but just keep it up. Maybe some of these 
other groups could take lessons or something?? If it came down to a music 
track or a release that was 25 disks smaller, I (and I'm pretty sure I speak 
for almost everyone here..) would pick the 4 disker hands down. 

** Points: 83 <-- The score the original release got.
   110% to the group IRQ57! To school with tha rest.

     [Hoyle Internet Blackjack v1.1.0.4]
                    [xx/xx]
I tried this a week or 3 ago, and it wouldn't install. This one however does, 
looks to be exactly like the regular Hoyle blackjack. I couldn't get it to 
play non-inet, it would immediately look for the network presence and 
completely crap out if it didn't find it. Since I've got better things to 
than to load up the shitty ppp crap on my system and try this, I'll just give 
it a NA.

** Points: NA -Looks to be working this time, but no non-net play.

Sure it's 24 disks.. If you got a leet ass 2.88 floppy drive. So in order to 
install this and keep the zips, you'll need 373 megz. Yeah, yeah, so it's 
under the 50 disk limit, big deal. Doesn't mean that it doesn't suck. 
Actually, the game itself wasn't entirely too awful, but it was a really 
shitty rip and not worth the dl time. You can't see any of the mission 
briefings (to tell you what kind of equipment you need), or any of the 
debriefings (where they tell you how god-like you are when you wax all the 
bad guys). This isn't one of those 1st person 3d mech games either, it's one 
of those 3rd person, hex style maps where you have to move a guy here, move a 
guy there, shoot here, shoot there, and end turn so the bad guy can move. 
Of course, would you expect anything different from SSI? The pre-mission 
command center was way cooler than all the in-mission grafix. When it first 
loaded up and I saw the command center stuff, I thought, "Hey wow, fuck, this 
is cool shit!" Until the actual mission started, when I thought, "I spent HOW 
MUCH time leeching this?" Kinda reminds me of any of the 1000 scrolly 
shootemups for the PSX. All the intro, config, and pre-game stuff rocks, but 
the game sucks. Oh well, this thing wasn't a very rewarding experience, due 
to the ripping of all the text.

** Points: 48 -Not worth the time/space.

HYBRID --> Release the brief/debrief stuff and I might change that score. 
Better yet, fix that 148M file, and repackage it smaller with the text stuff.
