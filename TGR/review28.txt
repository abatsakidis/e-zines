RATINGS are based on the game idea, graphics, sound, playability, ingenuity,  
versatility, and a lot of other words ending in `ity'.  These games are based  
on what happens on MY COMPUTER ONLY, unless stated otherwise.  I always first  
follow nfo directions, and if those don't work or are not available, I then  
try other ways.  So just b/c it doesn't work for me, doesn't mean it won't  
work for you.

Thanks to M8 for releasing this previously non-working game.   In it, you  
race against other races in an effort to make your planet just a lot cooler  
and better than the others.  Basically a sim game, but with planets.  Plenty  
of shit to do in it, building all kinds of things.  Graphics are ok, but the  
words are sometimes a little to dark to read.  Pretty good music and sfx.  
Only bother to get it if you really think you'll sit down and play it for  
long periods of time.

Well, as Ionizer stated, this thing doesnt work at all from MS-DOS it keeps  
asking for the CD. But if run under Win95 in MSDOS mode, it runs just fine.  
I also got it to work in Win95 mode, but it ran much slower and crashed when  
loading the main game, so.. Anywayz, after the game was up and running, it  
played ok on my 486/66 with all the options turned on (Parallax and High  
Details), so it probably jams on a p75+.  You play some sub type machine and  
you have different missions with each level.  You collect different weapons  
and there are plenty of obstacles and enemies.  Its pretty much just a  
straight arcade shooter with an underwater background.  Nice SVGA grafix and  
they managed to leave in some sfx and music which are ok too. I enjoyed play-  
ing this game for about 2 hours, which I then got bored and frustrated with  
it. Not worth the 100+ megs of HD it takes. They should rip out all the Win95  
and nonworking shit and then re-release a smaller ver.

Napalm goes and breaks the 40 disk limit that they originally agreed to set.  
However it doesn't seem to matter much since the game didn't work for me any-  
way, although some others said they have gotten it to work, others have had a  
million different problems with it.  I followed the nfo exactly, ran the  
install, installed to where it asked to, and ran lb.exe.  All it did was sit  
there, no errors, no nothing, just lockup.  I noticed that the installer made  
two subdirs of "longbow" so I even arj'ed it w/ one dir, but still nothing.  
Nothing is corrupt, so I'd love to hear what I did wrong.  Apparently their is  
a new type of .exe that has a mind of it's own and only works when it feels  
like it for only certain people.

It's been a while since I made fun of one of these kiddie games.  This one is  
supposed to teach kids about "the information superhighway" and more about  
computers.  I sincerely question the way they teach kids.  The game has this  
singing dog, Gus, and he sings all these stupid songs with words that barely  
rhyme.  Everything is called like cyber-somthing, like cybertoys, cyberpark.  
The thing is, they have absolutely nothing to do with computers.  If you go  
into the laundromat, to clean your clothes, there's a little bag with  
clothing.  You click on it, and some alien dork says "a modem is used to send  
data over a phone line".  WTF DOES DIRTY LAUNDRY HAVE TO DO WITH MODEMS?!  
In fact what the fuck does a laundromat have anything to do with computers or  
the inet.  The title is extremely misleading, someone wanna call the Better  
Business Bureau?  Anyway, you basically walk around from place to place and  
click on anything on the screen and it will do a shitty little animation.  I  
can't even reccomend you getting this for your little brother or sister to  
help them learn, because it is to retarded.

  American CivilWar (c)Interactive Magic x/26  
This war simulation game has a very informative and nicely done intro.  The  
game itself is the usual war type.  You're giving a map type playing field.  
You have your army's and brigades and whatnot.  You manage the supplies and  
moves and when to attack and when to defend.  Nothing we haven't seen before.  
The usual million of differnet factors that effect the outcome are in here,  
with the thousands of options.  Looks like a nice, well put together game.

This is the final version which fixes the problem of not being able to exit  
the highscore menu, and now it gives you the password to the level you were  
on when you exit.  Read TGR #26 for the full details of this game.

Here's a simple yet complex (impossible you say?) fantasy league program.  It  
allows you to set up your fantasy league so that you can waste all your money  
on guys who end up being injured.  I'm not too familar with fantasy league  
programs, but this one, I assume, has all you need, since it has tons of shit  
to set up and stuff.

Umm here's a stupid game if I've ever seen one, and believe me I have.  You  
are giving like a bunch of different paths, you hit spacebar, and pick one,  
it's extremely stupid, and pointless.  I don't see the strategy or brains  
involved in this, it's just spacebar, click, spacebar click, unless I'm just  
so extremely smart that I'm naturally good at the game.  Don't waste ya time.

Well here's the review on all of betas/SW for Quake.  I know many of you will  
get all pissed at me for this review, but to you- Go fuck yourself.  Quake,  
the big deal doom like game, the one that's supposed to top all the rest, the  
one that is supposed to have shit we could never dream of.  Would someone  
like to tell me where all this is?  I mean I'm not giving up on it, I know  
it's a beta/SW, but is this game really any different from the shit we've  
already seen.  The graphics are nothing spectacular, and if you are amazed by  
the sky graphics, then I know tons of web sites where you can look at back-  
ground type shit just like that.  The game simply is nothing spectacular..yet.  
You're all too hyped up about it, with the idea that it will be the best game  
out ever, and it really isn't.  That's not to say it isn't good, it's still  
good, but way over-rated and way over-hyped.  Oh, and spare me the bullshit  
about my computer not being good enough for this, I ran it on my sister's  
p/100, and it didn't change my feelings about the game.  Some good things to  
comment about it:  The nice outlay of the game lets you pick the level you  
want to go through by walking to it, rather than just selecting it from a  
menu.  The nice realism when walking up slopes, that makes you fall back down  
if you stop.  All in all, I think the "catacomb" idea for doom like games has  
been way overdone, which is why when DN3D came out, it was a big hit, because  
it wasn't just those boring catacombs.  The game is also very dark, and making  
it brighter just doesn't seem to help out much.  A million of you will prolly  
complain about this review, and I don't mind it, but if you do, all I ask is  
you prove to me what is so great about it, why it's so much better than any  
other game... because I know you'll have a hard time doing it.  You're going  
to need a pretty powerfull computer to play this full screen, 640X, and not  
have any slowdown, so go buy a p/100.  I don't want to give the impression  
that this game sucks, it's not that, it just may not live up to how good you  
may have thought it would be.   Oh, and don't bother to get it if you have  
a 486, it's too slow, and the graphics are degraded to 320, and it looks real  
bad in that mode.  
        Anyway, as for "what is what" the 8.5 meg is the "SW" beta, only cont-  
aining the first of the four different levels.  The 21 megger is the full  
thing, still called a beta, but it has all of the levels.  The ROR release:

appears to be exactly the same as the 21 megger except it `says' it's the  
registered version and does not have the beta graphics that are in the 8 and  
21 meg versions.  However it still has the same .txt files that say it's a  
beta and it's the same exact size as the 21 megger.  RoR claims the following  
as stated by the leader TKLP when asked "What *DID* you release?":  
[Tklp] Well, its the final pre-release, the difference between ours and the   
       actual final that will be in the stores is we dont have the 400 megs  
       of music, no modem play , and u cant hack up dead bodies.  
When asked "What's the difference between your version and the 21 meg beta?":  
[Tklp] It doesnt crash with that ipx shit, and it doesnt say beta all over  
       the place.  
So you want to know which version you should get?  If you can find it, get  
the ROR version, otherwise just go fetch the 21 meg zip.  Or you can always  
just get the official SW version if your a faggot.  It still gets a good  
rating, cuz it's still a good game, it's not necessary to talk much more  
about it, you know what it is and what it's got.

Haha, this is a pretty clever and witty sim game.  You are the controller of  
both heaven and hell, and it's your job to make sure the dead are either  
punished or satisfied.  The game had a nice intro, funny at times.  Then when  
it loads up it gives ya some humor, like instead of just saying "load ##%"  
it says "Warming burrioo ##%" and some other funny shit.  The game has nice  
tutorials to help you figure out how to play.  Mrs. Heaven and Mr. Hell are  
your little sidekicks to help you figure out what to do.  They have some, at  
times, witty things to say to each other.  The graphics for the game coulda  
been a little better, but they are still good, and the sound is fine.  This  
is a well put together quality game.  If you like sim city, you will definte-  
ly want to check this one out.  It will hog a nice 150+ megs though.  Oh, and  
be sure to pick up the dos addon if you don't have win95.  
                                RATING: 82/100

A soccer game released by Hybrid?, NO WAY!  Haha, yet another soccer game by  
Hybrid, the king of the foot fairies.  This one is very similar to the last  
one, Kick Off 96, it has that 3D aspect.  I didn't fool around a long time  
with it, but it seems like I wasn't playing.  I set my keys, but they didn't  
do anything, and it just seemed like no matter what option I picked, the game  
played itself anyway.  However, I could still tell what the game was like.  
Your average soccer game, nothing great.
