RATINGS are based on the game idea, graphics, sound, playability, ingenuity,
versatility, and a lot of other words ending in `ity'.  These games are based
on what happens on MY COMPUTER ONLY, unless stated otherwise.  I always first
follow nfo directions, and if those don't work or are not available, I then
try other ways.  So just b/c it doesn't work for me, doesn't mean it won't
work for you.

Ok, the nfo said it was the "based on the famous Israeli T.V. show, The Com-
edy Store."  They never said it was actually IN HEBREW.  I tried to under-
stand it, but I just couldn't.  Baruch ata adonai elohaynu melach ha-olum.
Or something like that, anyway, I did run it, but it's hard to read Israeli
comics.  One thing I did find funny, was the pictures of the guys looked more
like spanish people then they did Israeli.  But then again I don't live in
those shitty third world countries, so how would I know.

Some said this is a dupe, I believe ya, but I just don't remember reviewing
it or playing it.  If it is, I also take partial responsibility in the duping
so sorry ;) .  Anyway, it's a strategic war game for windows.  You move your
little planes and people and blah blah shoot em.  Kinda reminded me of the
game four corners, even though they have absolutely nothing in common, but
having four corners.  Not too exciting, but nicely put together.

Well, what can  you say.  There back, only this time, there not as fun.  The
title of this game is totally indescriptive.  Although you play paintball,
it is only to hit one of your munchkin buddies in the head to see them drop
to the ground and "puff" there gone. One hit kills them. This game is much
more of a puzzler.  Instead of hitting the little green haired freeks, you do
alot more pulling switches, or flying on a balloon across a lake of fire.
The games funny in a way. When you put your self in a cannon and go flying
across the lake, then the little doink lands on the ground  and bounces up
and down a couple of times, then dances around with a top hat, or even
stumbles up as it walks up the stairs, you just sit there and think, heh.
Although the animation is smooth, the graphics blow.  Its a pain to move the
little rats around the screen and shoot the right guy, or even move from one
plateau to another. I did get a chance to play it over the net.  It ran
decent for me, but between each game the damn thing kept disconnecting from
the other person, so i gave up on that. If your a die hard lemmings fan, and
are really into err.. semi-puzzlers grab it.  Otherwise, screw it :)

Here's another 3D shooting game.  This one takes place in more medieval times
and so you start off with a sword.  Oh but isn't technology amazing, the very
next weapon is a gun, just sitting their waiting for you back in 1500's or
something.  Anyway, the graphics are actually not to bad on this one.  The
game still lacks anything as good as we've seen, like a jump button, der.
Not impressive or anything, not really worth the bother.

A lame ass rebuild the world game.  The intro was semi-good but the game is
just another boring sim.  The graphics are pretty ugly and the sound is bleh.
Not much to say, the whole world is blown up by nuclear warfare, and you're
like one of the few to surive and now you gotta rebuild everything.  So hurry
up and get those damn phone lines working ;)  And go outside and repair the
cable so you can watch some Spice, oh shit, no people=no nudees = shitty
world to live in.  Maybe that's why the made the game so shitty.

     CHAOS OVERLORDS FOR WINDOWS '95
      (c) NEW WORLD COMPUTING [X/5]
The game installed fine with no problems under win95. It took me a little
while to figure out exactly how to play the game, as the online help
really wasn't that helpful. Basically it's like a reverse Civilization or
Colonization. You are a Gang Leader and are trying to take over the city.
You have sectors which you "influence" the business owners to pay you $$$
for your protection. With that money you can hire various warriors to
work for you and you can equip them with all kinds of weapons and armor.
The graphics aren't that great, and there is only a statistical type
combat, but if you enjoy strategic takeover the world type games, you'll
enjoy this one once you figure out how to play it.

A foreign platform type game with a wannabe sonic.  You're a racoonish type
character, and you punch your way to enemy bosses and collect crap on the
way.  Gay music, cheerfully bright scenes.  Lame anime for an intro.  Just a
pretty boring game.  However, a younger bro or sis might like the gayness.
Also make sure you overwrite the shakii.exe by putting the .exe in the 6k arj
over the existing one from the other arjs.

Even with the fix <dos4gw.exe> this one doesn't seem to work in dos mode for
me.  Others had lots of problems or didn't get it to work at all.  It kept
coming out with dos4gw errors and yes I rebooted cleanly.  Like I said back
in a talent show, in elementary school, where I did a magic trick and fucked
up "Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't."

Everyone says it's a dupe, I don't remember it and it was never reviewed so
it's getting reviewed anyway.  It's a win/win95 strategy war game.  It's got
some nice graphics, and you get to click "ok" a million times for errors and
setup.  The game is very complex with little itty bitty details.  Good game
for strategy fanatics, but to the rest, just a boring game.

Here's the full registered version of this game.  It uses the same engine as
Doom did.  It's pretty shitty graphics and all, but it adds a touch of RPG
to the game.  You talk to people, and if you don't like em you can still kill
them.  It mighta been better had the graphics been better and if it didn't
take place in such medieval looking times.  Not really worth 27 disks, maybe
if it were like 5 or something it might be.  The weapons in the game really
suck too.  It has all the modern functions <jump, run, etc>, but no duck.

This is a nice collection of "brainteasers" and stuff that your elementary
teachers would give you for homework to make you feel stupid and to make sure
you had no fun as a child like he/she did which is why they are a teacher.
(I'm sure I'll even get criticized by a teacher for that run on sentence).
The games include things from unscrambling words, to finding out patterns, to
decoding secret messages.  It's pretty fun if you like to challenge yourself,
but after a while you'll be like "why the fuck am I doing this?".  It's perf-
ect for teachers though, which is kind of stupid because they can't even fig-
ure out how to work the VCR's in the school, neverless a computer.

These are the expansion sets for WC2.  The Razor release includes the orig-
nal for those of us who deleted the game a long time ago,  while the Sailor
release is just the addons and requires the originial TDU or HBD version.
Nothing much to say, we all know what WC2 is, the expansions are just a bunch
of different missions for you to challenge yourself with.

Here's a nice shitty soccer game for ya.  It's arcade like.  It sucks though
because you can't pick the guy you want to control, it just picks the one
that is closest to the ball which is quite annoying.  It's like impossible
to score or do anything, it sucks, and it's really frustrating.  It's like
trying to take a shit when you've just eaten a box of matzah.

No, it's not a game, and yes, you are still reading TGR.  Occasionally I do
get SS and review them, especially if they sound interesting.  This one is
really cool.  I just wish that they would do the Bud-weis-er by themselves.
It has the 3 frogs sitting on a lilly pad, with a Budweiser sign behind them.
You hit ctrl-w, or b, or e, to make them say "bud" "weis" "er".  It's really
fun, and cool to have.  Impress your friends!

  TONY LA RUSSA BASEBALL 3: 1996 EDITION
     (c) STORMFRONT STUDIOS [XX/35]
It could just be my slow computer on this one, even though I meet the system
requirements, but the game moved at like one frame a second <seriously>.  And
the background crowd noise moved at the same rate too.  It's kinda hard to
play the game when it takes 2 minutes for the guys to get on the field.  How-
ever im sure it works better for you people with leet pentiums and stuff,
coughsomeonecoughcardmecoughone.  It's still a good baseball game, it's got
all the options you could ask for, although I don't remember seeing a homerun
derby in it or modem play.  It's got all the stadiums and it has jumbotron.
A good baseball game if you're looking for one, but if you really plan on
playing it a lot, you might have to end up buying it anyway, nuless Napalm
puts out the speech pack like they said they would.

      DEADLINE (c) NOVA SPRING [xx/16]
+-------------------------------------------+
Here's a pretty cool game where you are giving a squad of guys who have to
break down doors and arrest people, or make the appropriate actions in hos-
tage situations, and kill 'em if necessary.  Only problem is trying to figure
out how to do stuff.  Some docs for this one might be a little helpful.  It
looks like fun, but it's hard to figure out how to do stuff.  This game could
be really cool, if it just had an easier interface and not so many complicat-
ing things in it.  Might want to check it out if you got some time and are
willing to explore this.  So you don't think it's immediately lame when you
start, I suggest hitting the "live action" button and start exploring shit
that way.

This is version 2.0 of this, for some strange reason, loved scrolling shoot
'em up.  I don't know why people seem to like this, it's pretty boring if you
ask me.  You just hold down spacebar and dodge little dots.  The graphics are
however pretty good.  The sound and music are average.  The difference b/t
this one and the old version must be new levels and options <weapons>.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This weeks GOTW is a tough one.  Since win95 games don't qualify, because I
can't review them, Chaos Overlord doesn't have a chance.  This week's GOTW
would have to go to NAPALM for their release of TONY LA RUSSA BASEBALL 3:
1996 EDITION.  It's the first baseball game out, and it's pretty good if your
computer can handle it.  In behind with a close second was DYNAMIX for their
release of DEADLINE, it's good but it's hard to figure out.

-Blake Stone was released in 1994, and therefore was a major dupe, my bad.
-RoR's release of Cyberia 2:  I incorrectly assumed that the directions
meant to copy over the second 2 after you had finish arj'ing the first.  You
are supposed to do the first arj, play it, beat it, and then do the second
arj, however it still didn't work, it was missing a .m95 file.

-I'd like to thank Piston for sending in the review of Lemmmings Paintball,
(And for the new TGR ascii logo/ascii) and to Scrooge for his review of Chaos
Overlords. As stated before, anyone wishing to review a win95 game may do so
as long as it is in the same style. Then simply mail me it and I will use it.
-Happy Mother's Day!
-That's it for this week, hope it was of help.
