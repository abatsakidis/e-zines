Star Turtle H.C.J [24/24]

=========================
-Filenames: STRTLT??.ZIP
This is one of the stupidest, most drugged out shit I've ever seen.  The
entire thing is just a .mov/.crap of Harry Connick Jr. and this satanic talk-
ing turtle who comes from another planet and Harry Connick Jr. saves the
fucking turtle's species and shit.  I think H.C.Jr was on that "tar heroine"
around the time he made this fucking crap.  The whole thing is stupid, H.C.
takes this reptile turtle <who has magically flown to earth from another
planet> around to discos and shit, and the turtles back begins to glow greener
and brighter, it's really stupid.  I've never seen a more fucked up thing in
my life.  The only reason I would tell you to download this was if you wanted
a good laugh at some crazy shit, or if you're whatever state that is prosec-
uting H.C.Jr for drugs, and want to use this as evidence against him.

This game just sucks.  The intro takes fucking forever, because it's this
old ass English fellow yapping away to his fucking butler on a train to
England.  It's an adventure game, talk to this person, listen to unstimulating
conversation, and if you manage to stay awake you win!  The graphics are
cartoonish like on a shitty cartoon like background.  I don't really care if
the Brit's did like this one, but it ain't my cup of tea and I doubt it will
be yours either.  It's not worth your time or effort.  If you refuse to list-
en to me and get this one, make sure you get the .ini fix too.

CRUSADER, NO REGRET (C)ORIGIN [xx/25]
+ MUSIC ADDON/FIX (C) ORIGIN  [xx/06]
-Filenames: CD-RGT??.ZIP, CD-RSND??.ZIP
Crusader is back, and improved.  While you may go and call this Crusader 2,
it's really a little stretch to do that.  This game is pretty much exactly
like the original, except a few minor improvements, new levels, different
exclamations from the enemies, smarter artificial inteligence of the enemies,
and limits on your animation (bad).  While some of you remember this game as
"that one you could blow up everything in" you will soon find this one loses
some of that fun because of the fact that you are limited on ammunition of
even your main gun.  For those who didn't play the first one, the game idea is
simple.  It's a 3D overview of rooms, you walk around, shoot people, shit that
you wish you could do in real life.  You have tons of weapons to pick up, and
so many things to blow up, you could spend your entire life blowing up every
single thing.  If you liked the first one a lot, then I still reccomend gett-
ing this one, although it just isn't as good and simple as the first one.
If you thought the first one was so-so-good, then well you really don't need
to check this one out, because it isn't much different.  I would have thought
they could have made some more improvements to the game, add some better
features, and improve it a little more than they did.  When you hit "s" it
also will make an annoying beep sound (it gets annoying trust me) if there is
nothing to use it for.  Also, they didn't really improve on the game engine,
which although good, could have used some bug-like fixes.  Still a great game,
make sure ya get the save game fix (which is just a stupid .com file to make
a dir "savegame" in your game dir), and the music addon for music.  Oh, one
more thing, the install.exe you are supposed to run to set the sound, it takes
quite a while to load, so don't go rebooting your machine when all it does is
sit their for about anywhere from 10-20 seconds with a black screen, the
regret.exe will also take quite a while to load up, just be patient.  Also,
there are some rumors about this being a `beta'.  As far as I can tell, the
game runs fine, exactly like the first did, and there really is NO PROOF that
this is not the final.  Oh and ONE more thing, on level 1, at one pt in time
you will be given a code #121 for those keypads, the correct # is really #122,
I don't know if the game was designed to do that, but it's not #121.

You travel from planet to planet looking to start life by research and minor
building.  It's sim city in some ways and sim city in the other ways <G>.
You are given two scientists who have specific tasks to follow on different
planets.  You must cultivate the land and shit and grow weird mutant combos
of plants and animals.  It's tough to get going in the game, but if you're
willing to give it a shot, it has some potential.  I wasn't getting any sound
during the game, but I got it in the little intros.  The gfx are your usual
land layout, with actual depth to it, not just flat.  Be sure to run the
genewars.bat and not just the gw.exe, b/c the .bat has some switches to take
off the mouse position in the top left and some other shit.  The game wasn't
too exciting, and will take hours to learn the little itty bitty details to
go along with it.  I just hit `s' on the first level and it said level comp-
leted and moved me on to the next one, so if you're bored of a task you can
always do that.  Anyway, only get if you are desperate for a sim city like
game.

Here's an adventure game for the kiddies.  It takes place in a western setting
with a beginning shootout on wagons.  The graphics are all cartoon animation.
The game has the typical "use/walk/talk/open/look" features you use.  The
conversations are pretty boring and stupid and simple minded.  Like a man
will talk about something, then your next question could be from a choice
like "Who is <the man>".  Then the guy blabbers on and you ask more detailed
questions.  It's just pretty damn boring, not funny, and sketchy story line.
The sound was fucked too for me.  Overall it's a pretty basic adventure game
geared a little more toward `dem yoots'.

** FixNotes: RLX released a fix (which isn't needed, just follow these dirs)
All you need to do is to move \hellbend to \hellbender by either using the 
move command in WinDos or renaming it in the Explorer.

I waited till this was out for a while to play it. People have been calling 
this Terminal Velocity II. Don't think so. TV was at least somewhat controll-
able with my gravis pad. The controls on this suck if you use a gamepad type
of controller. I plugged in the ole MS Pro stick and it was just a little
better. It is the same type of game as TV though. Decent grafix, but even
better music. I had my stereo turned up a little loud from listening to some
tunes before, and when this thing started playing I thought it was gonna pop
a woofer. Strong shit! The voice was done pretty well too. All the usual
features: joy config, detail levels, sound config, etc.. I dunno though, this
game didn't really interest me a whole lot for some reason. Prolly cuz of the
oversteering problem. It does support rudder controls if you have that capa-
bility, which made it a little bit more controllable, but I still couldn't
fly this very well.

** Points: 70 -Mainly due to not being able to aim at shit cuz it moves too
               fast.

A little collection of reg'd shareware video casino games. Some of em aren't
too bad, and would be something to play while leeching a few megz at 28.8.
There's a couple of 8 payline slots, a couple 1 payline slots, and a couple of
video poker games. There's a few options to speak of, one of them being auto-
play, where you can set a value and it'll only stop when you win that much or
more. There's also other special payoffs and doublers in most of these. Not
gonna talk too much about this ware, I think most of us know what slots and

Here's what HBD had to say about this:
"Hello fellow pirates! This time we bring you a kewl platform game, where
 you take on the role as GEX, lizardrious but not too green! Basically, you 
 start out by choosing a TV-station. Then you must choose a channel on      
 this particular TV-station (channel=level!). Then you're off to run around 
 whopping zombies with yer sturdy tail! WHIP WHIP WHIP! You can also climb  
 walls 'n shit (like any GEX lizard!). This game was first out on the SEGA  
 Saturn (I think!), and this is an exact port to the PC. We recommend that  
 you play it on a P133 with 32MB of ram and a Matrox MGA card. Latah!"

This is a pretty cool game. I think this was the very first playstation rom I
ever popped in the console, not sure. The only differences between this and
the one for the psx was this one is missing Gex's little phrases that he says
at certa in times throughout the game, no big deal though. You'll have to have
a fast system though, it ran slightly slow on mine. Maybe due to the fact I
was running in 64k color mode @ 800x600 oh, and my grafix card ain't cuttin it
no more (I'm gonna start the "Donations for pAth0s's Matrox" Fund.) Other than
that, all of the sound fx are here. I thought I might've ran into a little
problem though, it seemed to take forever to load up the stage select after
completing a level, I paused, then unpaused, and it went back right after. So
if it hangs on you at the end of a level, try pausing and unpausing. The gfx
were pretty decent for a scrolly adventure. All the usual options, keyboard
config, joy config, sound, and window size. This is prolly the best PSX port
I've seen yet, but then again, there haven't been that many.

** Points: 81 -Should keep you busy for a while, and not 1.02e22 disks long.
