on what happens on MY COMPUTER ONLY, unless stated otherwise.  I always first
follow nfo directions, and if those don't work or are not available, I then
try other ways.  So just b/c it doesn't work for me, doesn't mean it won't
work for you.

     Descent II (c) Interplay [XX/19]
The long awaited release of Descent 2 (yes all three people waiting for it)
was finnaly released.  It's not much different, at first, from the first one
for appearance.  It's still that same nauseating 360 degree doom type.  There
are so many keys it's not even funny.  There are also a million fixes out for
it, one for the setup, one for the game, one for the 3rd level, and I lost
track after a while.  The main thing is, it was not packaged well, because
most of us don't have a clue wtf a "digidevice" is and therefore could not
setup the descent.cfg to properly get the music to work.  You'll also need
a pentium to play this with decent graphics.  It's just not the way it used
to be anymore :( .

Well, like Hybrid says, this pinball game pretty much blows.  It looks very
outdated and it's only one table.  It just sucks, it's those single table
pinball games where you try to move the ball up higher and higher w/ several
pairs of flippers.  Graphics are ugly and sound is pretty bad too.

No, you're not seeing double.  Another release that was released by two
groups (RZR & NPM - for those who can't make out two diz's smashed together)
It's so nice to be told something is for DOS (ahemrazorahem) when it's really
only for Win95.  So since it is, here's what the two groups had to say.
RAZOR.NFO:
    Game Format : Flight Simulator            System Type : DOS
      Packed By : The Speed Racer          Install Method : See below

                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~                       
        24 action-packed missions take you through Central America,
        the Middle East and Korea in one of the most devastating
        ground attack planes ever created. Huge explosions and new
        texture-mapped terrain reduce other flight sims to twisted
        wreckage.                   
         
NAPALM.NFO:  
  Release Notes:  
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The most indestructible closeattack plane ever built, the Thunderbolt II.
  In this sequel to the highly successful A-10 Tank Killer, you'll dive into
  3 fast-paced campaigns with 24 action-packed missions.  This is a must
  for all you flight sim fans!   This is for Win95 ONLY!

Sigh, well I copied all 13 disks to disk so I could recopy it to a computer
with Win95, but for some unknown reason, when I ran the game, it just kept
loading different levels, eventually reaching level 81 and some others, so
I got someone else to review it and here's what Scrooge had to say about it.
"I really liked the RoR installer incidentally.  The Game installed fine..
 no problems.  It reminded me of the Old Xenon game except you could go in
 any direction, not just the way the screen scrolled.  Same kind of Air to
 Ground or Air to Air fighting tho'.  It was rather slow on my machine
 (486dx2/80 with 16megs of RAM), so I suppose a Pentium is needed. Sometimes
 in the game you could fly under trees for some period of time. The graphics
 aren't that great so I ended up running into something I couldn't see.  I
 suppose if you really wanna destroy something, you could install this game.

Ardennes - Battle of the bulge[10/10]
-------------------------------------
I believe this was released before, (at least something with Battle of Arden-
es was released before) whether or not it was Battle of the Bulge, I don't
know.  Anyhow, it's another war strategy game for windows.  The game is just
a bunch of icons on a map, with many factors affecting the war such as the
land, the weather, and everything else that effects troop moral (last time
they got laid, if their gum has run out of flavor, etc...j/k).  I can't pict-
ure this as being too entertaining, as the pictures alone are dull and boring
looking.  Unless your desperate for a wargame, go for it.

Another pinball game from Hybird.  I put this in the directory the game wants
it in, but it still refused to run, which isn't surprising since HBD states
`they' couldn't get it work eiter <relating to graphic cards>.  So another
one bites the dust.

game with some extra crap you won't care about anyway.  And isn't this wonder-
ful, we get double crap b/c two groups released the same shit again!  TGR
isn't about to go deciding who duped who on this one, but it's evident this
duping is lame, and even lamer when it's for shitty games such as this.  Oh,
back to the game, the graphics are so fucking plain and ugly it's not funny.
The sound is so disgusting it hurts your ears.  And it's like impossible to
get your plain off the ground without reading the boring docs in the game.

Even if this does have a different name then the below, Firestorm Thunder-

"=Firestorm Thunderhawk 2=
        Razor, 14 disks.  A very good helicopter sim.  I couldn't experience
it to the fullest because it required installing it to/from a different drive
it was unarj'ed so i ran main.exe, but it didn't seem to run the sound.  It
looks very good, there's not much to say about it however.  Graphics look 
ok, but not exactly crystal svga."

  Your wish has been granted: EarthSiege 2.  You'll get more than 50 missions,
  true 3-D texture-mapped terrain and incredible new burn your eyebrows off
  pyrotechnics.  The controls and cockpit interface are easy to use and

Before you bother to unzip and unarj, make sure you have first gotten the
correct disk #56 with arj 55 <the arj has an error so arj t karts.a55 first>.
This game is very similar to a previous `kart' racing game we've seen before,
I just can't place my finger on it though.  It's got good flowing graphics,
but they are still a little grainy.  The music is pretty upbeat and the sfx
are ok.  You can race around a variety of tracks from New York streets to
somewhere in fucking Italy or something.  The only thing is, it's only racing.
There is no shooting other guys or anything.  The hard part of the game is
making the turns quick enough, because they come up quick on you because you
can easily pick up speed fast.  The graphics don't exactly help you out in
that area.  The game will easily get dull, basically because it's like hard
as hell to come in anything but dead last place.  But if you got some d/l
time and around 85 megs, check it out.

Ringworld II - Return to Ringworld
% full CD % [xx / 64]
-Here's the sequel to Ringworld, a nice colorful adventure game.  This is the
full cd, so you don't miss out on the intro, animations, speech, etc.  It's
a very good quality game, so if you got 285 megs free and are too cheap to
shell out the money for it, and you're looking for an adventure game, this
is the answer.  It doesn't have anything noticeably different from other good
adventure games, but like I said it's quality.  It also took about half an
hour to "un"RAR the entire thing.

     Fantasy General (c) SSi [XX/26]
Here's a long awaited release by stratego-manio's.  I think it sucks and that
it is one of the most boring pieces of shit, but rather than be biased
against strategy games of this type, I'll just state fact.  You're giving a
playing field with octagonal `places'.  They all contain certain kinds of
areas.  You move your varied types of characters and plot out moves to take
in your turn to try and kill the other dudes.  There's no close up fighting,
just lame icon biting an icon and then statistics of the fight.  Someone
please write mail to me and tell me WHY you could like something like this,
something that looks so dull and requires so much thinking, yuck.  Anyway,
this is supposed to have been a big release to war strategy likers and stuff
so umm enjoy, if that's possible.

A nice little mini golf game.  The graphics are a bit grainy however.  Theirs
6 courses to choose from, each with 9 different holes.  It's got some moving

Living Pinball Full CD        [xx/27]
-------------------------------------
This is the full version of the previously released game.  What does that
mean??  It means d/l like an extra 25 disks for a 2 minute long intro <which
actually was pretty good, but had absolutely nothing to do with the pinball
game> and then still getting the same shitty boards for pinball.  If you
already have downloaded it, check out the intro <fuck the game> it's sorta
worth looking at.
Here's the quote from review16.txt, when EOD released it as 2 disks:
"A very simple, small, and basic pinball game.  It includes 3 tables, which
each contain 2 bonus tables.  Their is no music, and the sfx are below avg.
It's not very good, and it looks extremely old.  Not worth it even to have as
a `just to have' game.

A shitty platform game that was previuosly released about 9-12 months ago.
This might be some `new version' but it still sucks.  You choose from two
robots to do your pathetic sword swiping and double jumping moves.  It's not
a pretty sight, the sfx are dull and repetitive and the music is pretty lame.
Graphics certainly aren't your current 3D backgrounds and stuff. Don't bother.

This is the sequel to PGA golf.  It's got crisp clear graphics and a nice
layout.  It's a pain to install all these seperate addons, but if your a golf
enthusiast or an old fart bag who can't move his legs, you might have fun
witht this one, but you'd probably need to buy it to enjoy it to the fullest
anyway.  It's golf, not much more to say, quality.

I know, I know, you're sitting there thinking "What the fuck this isn't a
game, has the leet Ionizer gone crazy?"  No, I downloaded this because as the
nfo says, I thought it might help me out in real life.  And it looks like it
can do that.  It's a helpful small utility for windows to help you prepare
applications, give pointers, and automatically puts in addresses for shit.
If you are a Junior or Senior in high school and haven't begun applying yet,
GET THIS NOW, it will really help you out when it's time to start filling
the shit out or requesting to fill it out.

You know you've got an itsy bitsy problem when the diz says 26 disks, but the
addon says the game was 27 disks.  Well I didn't realize that it's actually
27 disks until 2 weeks later, and the chance of finding that last disk is
almost impossible.  The .mov's looked pretty cool though ;)

Thanks to Razor for this nicely working, and easily installed version.  This
is a very addictive and cute little game.  You have two sides to a board and
the object is to get 21 of your wind-up toys to the other side before the
computer does.  There is an assortment of toys that all have special things
that they do to other toys.  Depending on how long you let them wind up, all
depends on how long they can last on the playing field.  The graphics are
excellent, and the sfx and music are pretty good.  An excellent new witty
idea makes this game something to check out.

     Revolution X (c) Acclaim [05/05]
A pretty good shoot-em-up starring Aerosmith, that really shitty band.  My
ears are just about ringing now from playing this game for about 30 minutes.
It is addictive and you just want to keep going on, but it does get boring,
and you start to wish you just had brought along a nuclear bomb to blow up
everything.  The graphics are a little shabby, and the sound effects could
put you to sleep after a while <or make you deaf>.  The only way to actually
play and get somewhere would be using a mouse or joystick, and the mouse
control isn't exactly great.  The game gets really boring, but is worth the
time if you like shoot em ups.  BTW, did I mention Aerosmith sucks?

Dynamix nicely tries to avoid the 40 disk limit rule by sizing up the zips to
a nice 1.77 meg.  As if we wouldn't notice and make fun of them?  Anyway, it
is yet another war game out their.  This one for win3.1/95 is similar to the
more high quality ones.  It is not too detailed in strategy, and a little
mor graphicy then others.  However, it's still not worth the size.  As with
most war games, the object is to plunder gold and kill the enemy, blah blah.
Oh, it'll also take up a nice 185 megs once installed.

For 10 disks this thing sure lacks a lot, besides being new.  I think this
"asteroid" type game is just getting A LITTLE old, dont'cha think <of course
you don't that's why your listening to what I say the games are like>.  It's
not worth 10 disks, maybe 1, but not 10.  Prolly like 8 disks of that were
devoted to the opening avi <which seemed to go on for eternity> and the crash
avi.  Don't bother.

A very basic soccer game.  It's not fifa, and it's not some stick figured

it's just your basic plain soccer game.  No extravagant things, just the
basics of soccer.  Regular vga gfx, and average sfx.

I believe I reviewed a demo/beta of this about 1 year ago!  It's about time
the morons finnaly finished the game.  Well, the game is still as annoying
as it was a year ago.  This platform game is quite annoying and lame.  You
use the mouse to aim around you in 360 degrees while you use keyboard to move
the character.  It's like impossible to shoot the bad guys cuz they move so
fast and the your weapons suck.  The game is just lame and outdated.  If you
find yourself playing this longer than 10 minutes I know a good psychiatrist.

STOP THE INSANITY!!  Stop fucking releasing this game, it sucked the first
time, it sucked the second, it sucked the third and the fourth, and on the
fifth time it STILL SUCKS.  I've downloaded this game 5 fucking times, stop
releasing it!  Do you realize the precious time you've wasted of my computer's
life?  It could have been spending that time fucking some cd-rom chick, or
connecting up with a modem, it's got better things to do then download the
same thing 5 times, ok?  Anyway, it's a lame racing game, that is practically
impossible to control because the turns come up to quick and you can't turn
to quick or you spin out.  It basically sucks, some dumb fools might find it
fun though, fun enough to release it again and again...and yet again...and..

Here's the final version of this one that had a demo out about 6 weeks ago.
An excellent, upbeat, humorous, un-controlled racing car game.  This one has
tons of tracks (24 total, I think).  It's got millions of wacky .wav comments
during you're game, such as "Holy taco!" <mexico> and many other neat catch
phrases dealing with the course <G>.  The racing is not a sim, but more like
a polyshaped virtua fighter type graphics.  If you get bored with it, you can
always discover new ways to fly your car off a ramp and make it do 7 flips
and land on the top of your car to see how much damage you can cause.  The
car is pretty bouncy and it's sometimes fun to just screw around.

 GAMEINFO ...... FLIGHT SIMULATOR FOR DOS
 IN THIS VERSION CAMPAIGN-MODE WORKS 100%
------------------------------------------
Another in the line of flight sim games.  This one is similar to most, with
it's campaigns and specific missions.  Graphics can be great, if you got the
computer to handle it.  Sound effects are ok and music is fine.  I couldn't
seem to get anywhere, I started up a single mission, and I'm just flying in
the sky, and I go lower to the ground and then I've failed my mission :(.
It looks pretty damn good though, just hope you can get into it, because it's
not going to get into you.

Ok, this time it has nothing to do with me or my computer, so don't be all
"his computer must suck".  I ran the setup.exe like the .nfo says, setup my
sound car, tested it, then it says to run ta.bat.  Well if you run ta.bat,
it runs a go.com, and go.com get's some syntax error "go".  So I tried to run
the go.exe, which loads up the intro, which played fine.  The game then app-
ears to start loading, but it then stops and the screen is blank.  I even
tried to edit the setup.cfg and change the cd letter, nothing.  So there.

     TOTAL KNOCKOUT BOXING            
(C) 1995 Digital Lobster Company
--------------------------------
A demo version of this female boxing game.  The actual fighting part of it
is somewhat similar to Mike Tyson's Punchout in the arcade, but the graphics
are of course much better.  It looks pretty cool, but it's only a demo, and
you can only bash the tits of one bitch <and some meat>.  I'd like to see a
full registered version of this hopefully sometime soon.

There Baaaaaack!  Those cute, cuddly, pms'ish, little worms are back.  This
time they brought along some cooler scenery, a shitload of sound effects, and
missions, rather than just pointless playing.  They made sure not to miss out
on any options this time.  Customize worms to fit your needs.  They have a
Beavis and Butthead sound effects, Simpsons, Tiny Toons, and so many other
premade ones.  You can make your own scenes, sound effects, and make it the
way you want it.  You can play it over a network, and over modem <at least it
says you can, I'm still trying to figure out how>.  Oh, you're probably like
"that's fucking great, but WTF IS WORMS?!"  Welp, if you missed it the first
time around, with what now would look like a dull version, worms is very sim-
ilar to that basic tank game.  The one where they sat on a hill and you shot
at each other.  No no, it's not boring like that, this game has attitude!
In your first mission you try to kill James Brown as he shouts some of his
more famous lines.  I'm told Elvis is somewhere in their too.  You can have
fun launching kung fu kicks on Bruce Lee, or sending homing missles at The
Beatles.  Make up your own team and sound effects.  This is a must download
for anyone who loves a little humor or just feels like blowing the shit out
of someone or torturing them.  Simple, fun, and customizable.

I followed the nfo WORD for WORD, even used the same examples it says.  Yes,
it did work, it got the game to run, but as soon as I was killed/crashed/
whatever you want to call it, the game would black out and then throw me back
into dos with some crap telling me I didn't use the right CD.  Anyway, from
what I could tell, you control a ship underwater and your giving missions to
do shit.  It's sorta platformish, and you shoot the stupid sharks that get in
your way and avoid shit that fires at you.  Couldn't discover much else.

Similar to lemmings but with people like magicians, barbarians, and knightish
people.  You try to manipulate the people on the board, using their limited
array of abilities to do things.  Your object is to get them all to go near
the exit, or maybe it's just to get one their.  I don't know which, cuz it's
kinda hard.  Lots of obstacles get in your way, requires major thinking (in
other words recommended for ages 10 and under).

It's hard nowadays to find such quality CRAP like this.  Actually it's really
easy, just download the "latest ware" from some group you never heard of.
This is a pathetic doom-like <if you can even call it that> shitty ega look'n
graphics with lamer than lame sounds.  You can't shoot, you just have to walk
through the doom like atmoshphere and collect shit and reach the end.  It's
some kind of stupid promotion or something for duracell, and the energizer
bunny.  The bunny doesn't look like the one on tv, but then again it's hard
to recreate an image using almost block like graphics.  Dont even bother even
if you do it just cause your curious.

rather than the traditional top to bottom scenario.  You can also play two

like this.  It's not on the same level, but it's like a smaller scaled down

First I'd like to congratulate Napalm for not fucking it up.  Secondly, I'd
advise you not to download it unless you have at least a pentium/100, b/c
this shit requires a lot of power.  Anything below that will most likely
result in severe choppiness and makes the game hard to play.  Theres not much
difference <game wise> then from the first one.  It's got a few added things
here and there, but don't look for a complete overhaul or anything.  Only for
true diehard fans of the first one.

Please note, the fakecd.exe included in this has the taipan.438 virus in it,
but you can simply use your own fakecd.exe, just delete the one in this.
This is a typical tennis game.  The gameplay is pretty plain, just blurry
characters walking around on the court smacking a ball back and forth.  You
don't control the swing, you just have to move to the ball.  It get's really
boring and repetitive.  BTW: Use the "1" key to serve.  The sound/speech
addon adds a little more to the game, but not too much, it reads off the
players info, and says a few things more here and there.  This one is a
little disappointing for it's size.

Yeah. yeah, it may be chink shit, but you can still run it.  Just get past
the setup of your soundcard, and the game menu is in english.  Too bad once
you're in the game you can't play.  None of the keys do anything, and it's
impossible to serve.  So hope you have a joystick <if that even works>.  The
game is pretty gay looking though.  It's just a platform volleyball game.
You can't move up or down, just left and right.
