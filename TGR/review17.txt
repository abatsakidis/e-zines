RATINGS are based on the game idea, graphics, sound, playability, ingenuity,
versatility, and a lot of other words ending in `ity'.  These games are based
on what happens on MY COMPUTER ONLY, unless stated otherwise.  I always first
follow nfo directions, and if those don't work or are not available, I then
try other ways.  So just b/c it doesn't work for me, doesn't mean it won't
work for you.

Well if your a fag or under age 10 you might like this.  It's actual pretty
good, but it's not like YOU will have fun playing it or anything.  A little
brother or sister might enjoy it.  It's got an interactive book, with puzzles
and pictures, but the movies <since they are cut> sometimes fucks it up.  It
also has a bunch of other games and informationa bout whales in it.  Quality,
but not something you'd want.

Like the nfo states, it's a chinese rpg.  How this is an RPG, I have no idea,
it looked more like a sim city wannabe type.  It's that usual chinese anime
shit, and the non-people-pictures are ugly.  Don't bother even if you do
speak chinese or whatever the fuck this shit is written in.

It may have more of a story line then other doom type games, but the graphics
and gameplay in this one suck.  First off, it's missing many of the essential
commands that any decent doom type game would have, like jump, run, strafe,
etc.  Secondly, it's graphics are plain ugly, and their is no music.  It's
pretty bad, and for some reason I have the urge to call it childish looking.

  Star Quest I ...in the 27th century
    By Virtual Adventures [0X/03]
A simple minded space game.  You have those lame briefings, and then go and
perform the task.  Example: First mission is to defend some stupid satelite
thingi from asteroids, even though your standing right in front of it pract-
ically, the asteroids AMAZINGLY will not hit you, but do manage to directly
hit your satelite, makes you wonder!  Der, anyway, it's not really good, in
fact it sucks.

I was very surprised by this game.  I figured, oh joy, I get to sit at some
lame dock and wait for fish to bite at my line.  But it was nothing like that
at all.  You take a boat out and travel through a choice of areas with some
fish detector thingi, then you stop the boat, then you cast the line, then
you need to attract the fish by having your lure move a certain speed.  It's
a lot more sophisticated then you could imagine.  You can purchase new boats,
lures, rods, or compete in tournaments if you have no life, etc.  Overall,
it's pretty neat, but I can't picture too many playing this over and over.

The nfo will tell you it's like Myst.  It is in a way, but there really is
not much of a storyline, if any.  The game is just a weird place that you
travel through, and you encounter "mind" games that you must, not only figure
out, but figure out how to play too.  I didn't encounter any other people,
just games, and a lame layout.  The graphics are similar to Myst's and the
games are slightly similar.  Their's just some lame music, and wind noises
as sounds.  Kinda boring, might challenge the intellectually superior (you
know those aliens you've been hiding in your closet and dressing up like
girls and fucking every night <ET>).

      College Slam (c) Acclaim [X/5]
Hmm, I coulda sworn I've seen this game before...hmmm oh yeah!  Can we say
`hello Mr. NBA Jam TE in disguise'?  This is exactly like that game except
it's with college teams, and there's SLIGHTY more options.  There's also a
few more different <and stupider> phrases for when you slam dunk.  All in all
it's pretty much exactly like NBA Jam TE, there really are no major diff-
erences between the two.  The game play is exactly alike, and I think we'd
all consider it to now be boring.

I knew many of you would be asking me about this if I didn't do this so here
goes:  The game is for win95, and until I have my network up (god knows when
that will happen, oh and there is no god) I'm not able to review larger Win95
games because it would require me to copy it to disk, then back onto another
computer, and I just don't have the time for that lame shit.  I'm taking dork
volunteers if you'd like to help out in that department, I pay .01 an day.

Holy shit, I just came up with this new idea:  Groups should TEST their
releases BEFORE releasing!  Wow, what a fucking concept!  Doesn't work: pk'ed
em, ran install, ran dart.bat, for one thing it was missing dos4gw.exe, so
it's obviously not packaged right, I ran all the other .exe's too, and it
still didn't work even when I copied another dos4gw.exe still didn't work.

In order to get this to work make sure you arj it to X:\mrk, not stated in
the nfo.  However, after doing that, and editing the mrk.cfg file, upon enter-
ing the main menu, my mouse would not work nor the keyboard.  It says a joy-
stick is not required but apparently it is.  Please note that others HAVE got-
ten this to work, so try it yourself if you wish.

This one was a pain in the ass to finnaly figure out how to work.  The nfo
states to just unarj to root, but there is no built in dir for the game to
unarj to, so here's what ya do:  On root drive, make a dir "fa" then arj
everything into their, then type "soundset X:\fa\soundset.ini X:\fa\fast.ini"
Then after that's done, make a dir savegame in FA, and then you can finnaly
run fast.bat to play.  Now, on to the game, it's a submarine game.  You make
your plans and attacks just as you would with a war game.  The game is mostly
maps, but their is the occasional picture.  Sound fx and music is average.

Well this game agreed with my video card like an old man's arteries agree
with a lard sandwhich.  It's kinda hard to play a game in 10 tiny sized
screens.  I'm sure it works fine, as long as you get the video setup right.

good quality fishing game, but not exactly something you might enjoy, al-
