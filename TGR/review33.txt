     IMMORAL CUMBAT iS A FANTASY ADULT 
     ADVENTURE GAME. ENJOY THE QUALiTY!
If you haven't played the older versions of this classically bad game, then
you should check it out for a laugh.  It's a first person 3D perspective
(Doom like) in black and white, except your a dick and you shoot cum.  You
hit the fire button the hand starts wacking off and then it shoots cum.  The
game gets boring quick, and the graphics are pretty dull.  You shoot at other
dicks, old fart 3 inchers, and tits and ovaries.  Your life stamina is shown
by the length of your dick and armor in this game is a condom.  I didn't
notice any differences from this version and older versions, but supposively
they are there.  If you want a good laugh, go ahead, if not dont bother.

Interactive Preview CD
     [xx/08]
Yes I do occasionally review demos, and this is one of those times.  This is a
playable preview of this upcoming Mechwarrior like game.  In fact it's pretty
much exactly like Mechwarrior.  Nice graphics, and layout for a demo, with
pretty much all the options.  If you want to see what it's like so when the
full version comes out you can see if it'll be worth the download, I reccomend
getting it.  If you liked Mechwarrior you should also get this.  You will
need at least a p/90 to play this one.  You basically, like in MW, just go
around and shoot at other robot like fighting machines, you have missions to
follow, etc.

Eh, so it's old as hell, maybe we should get B&B to do a little review on it.
Butthead: Uhhh, what the hell is this crap?
Beavis:   It's um, like stuff with death and destruction.
Butthead: Uhhh, no.  You dumbass, that's the name of the group.
Beavis:   Oh yeah, heheheh, I knew that.  So like what's it about?
Butthead: It's old, huhuh.
Beavis:   Yeah, old things suck!
Butthead: They should like take all the old stuff and burn it.
Beavis:   Yeah, fire, fire, fire!
Butthead: I heard this was like an R-P-G game or something.  It like stands
          for Really Poor Game.
Beavis:   No way, Stuart said it's an adventure game from like 1940.
Butthead: Huhuhuh, you dumbass, they only had that game Pong in 1940.
Beavis:   Ohhhh right, yeah yeah.  So like what is this?
Butthead: Uhh, I dunno, I think your some guy and stuff, and you like are
          on some Quest for Glory and like you click on stuff and stuff
          happens.  It's stupid.
Beavis:   Oh I see.  How come you're so smart Butthead?
Butthead: Uhhh, I read this magazine TGR, it like tells me everything.
Beavis:   Ahh so that's what you do when you're in the bathroom. *PLOOP*
Butthead: Yeah, it makes me in-tel-uh-gent and stuff.  It told me this game
          sucks and has shitty music and old vga graphics.  It also said
          it has naked pictures of you masterbating in it.
Beavis:   NO WAY!  That would be an improvement to the game.          
Butthead: Umm, whatever.

RPG, with lots of interaction and boring non-humorous talking between charac-
ters.  The movement <with the mouse> is kind of a pain to manipulate and to
do actions, but you manage.  Music is gay, no noticeable sfx.  It's the usual
plot of your space ship landing on some strange land inhabited by other
cretures/people.  Game gets boring quick.  You have an eagle's eye view over
the land and people.  Not much to say, not so hot, don't know why Reflux
thought it was the best game this year, because it's not.  If you like RPG's
with lots of talking and roaming around not so hot graphic areas, then you
might like this, but even then, you might not.

Finally the real version of Quake is out.  I've said enough about this game
to last you people a lifetime.  You know what it is, you'll probably download
it no matter what I say.  I did notice a speed improvement from this one to
the previous final beta ones, although not much.  You will still need a p/75
to play this one in full screen.  The game is still too dark <and brightness
doesn't affect it, so shutup> and the weapons still suck dick with their
shitty dot-like explosions.  If you think you'll like it from all the hype,
then go ahead and get it.  But, if you showed this and DN3D to someone who
has been in a coma for 10 years, without a doubt they would think DN3D is
much better, b/c they haven't heard of the hype.  Anyway, I don't need to go
on much more, if you didn't catch the review of this the first time, refer
to issue #28.  Rating stays the same.

  Nice game in Warcraft/Command'n'Conquer style
It's easy enough to just say that this game is Polish Warcraft (no, not b/c
the guys in it are stupid or anything) but because it is partially in Polish
and the game looks practically exactly like Warcraft 2.  The color scheme for
the land is like exactly alike.  The buildings however are different.  Like
WC2 and C&C you are given certain missions to follow.  The game doesn't feel
of the same quality because of the foreign like atmosphere it has.  The game
has the guys say shit when you click on them just like WC2, and they are
pretty much just like WC2.  If you're polish, smart enough to `get this',
you will enjoy it.  For the rest of you, stick the 100% english games.

Blah, all this is basically the same exact levels that were in a previous
release and also in Nuke It.  It also includes, even though it's stupid, the
sound files in the game, icons, and midis.  You really don't need this if
you already downloaded any other package of map files.  Not really needed.
This shit also makes like 100 individual directories for each seperate map.

In Pursuit Of Greed         
RAZORCD
-Uhhh I don't know what's up with this plain diz, but I did at first think
that this was fake b/c of the way shit was worded in the nfo.  You'd think
it were fake too if you saw that diz and this stuff in the nfo:
      "Razor 1911 proudly presents: In Pursuit of Greed! In the 3rd
       age of man, the criminal elite direct you, the hunter, to
       travel to distant and hostile worlds. Armed with the latest
       in hunter hardware, your mission is to kill everything that
       moves and steal anything that is not nailed down. This is a
       nice game with great graphics. Up to 8 players on network play
       to go at it in 10 network levels. Many great features make this
       game well worth the download! On-screen features such as A.S.S.
       cam rearview, heat and motion sensors, and rotating maps. Serial
       and modem play for head-to-head action. Enjoy!"
Now after readint this, I saw "armed with the latest in hunter hardware your
mission is to...steal...".  I thought that maybe some group was accusing
Razor of stealing and thought it would be funny to word it that way.  And then
when it said the "A.S.S." cam rearview, I thought "you gotta be kidding me".
But sure enough there really is an "ASS" camera view.  Anyway getting to the
game, the intro was really cool, and pretty misleading.  The actual game play
is a dull doom like game, with terrible graphics <although the guys you shoot
at are nice and big and die pretty cool>.  The graphics however just suck and
will remind you of Wolf3D.  You're supposed to go around, shoot people, and
ultimately find the treasure you're out to steal.  If the game were a lot
more like how the intro made it look, this would be a kick ass game, but it's
not, so don't bother.
                RATING: 32/100 <15 of which come from the intro>

*Wasn't enough time to get Triple Play 97 or Civil War, so tune in, <wait this
*ain't a radio or tv station> I mean uh be sure to read about it next issue.

This is a DEMO. However, no one said shit to me about it being one. Nothing 
in the nfo about it either.. This is a playable demo though, and I guess I 
can talk about it briefly, before I give it the phat O. Basically, you've got 
3 choices of vehicles, and after that it's Terminal Velocity in a car. Well, 
not as good as TV, but you get the idea.

Not bad. It's definately a beta, still swaps and pauses right in the middle 
of gameplay, along with a couple audio glitches thrown in for good measure,
and it installed its own directX2 drivers without asking (quite unlike MS).
I'll like it a lot better once the final comes out. I do have to say that the 
synth muzak flippin rocks though and the grafix are a lot better than 
average. This will prolly be one of those "unbelievable directX games" I 
talked about a couple weeks ago. As far as the juice of the game, you can 
pick one out of about 10 of the most popular monster trucks to race with. 
Theres 4 different types of races too. Drag (side by side car crush), Rally 
(offroad enduro type), Circuit, and Tournament. You can set up suspension, 
gearbox, and tires on your truck for the different types of tracks/races. 
Don't have more than 4 other trucks racing against you when you first start 
out tho, the traffic kinda sucks. There's many different resolutions, 
textures, and toggles to optimize video/processor speed, as well as audio, 
and joy/keybd setup. As a little side note, from what I gather about the help 
files included, MS is planning on devoting a whole webpage to this game, with 
possible tournament type netgames once the game goes final. This one will 
definately be worth checking out!

** Points: 74 Some points off cuz it's a beta and has a couple probs.

This is what the pc.nfo reads:
Crack for Hardwood Solitaire 1.4 (I don't know if it works on other version)                                                    
-copy hwsolk.com in windows directory
-execute it                                                       
Have fun!
Giraffe

This is what the pAth0s.nfo reads:
This hwsolk.com file is a generic virus produced by the PS-MPC virus creation 
kit that anything will detect. Oh! If you run this in your windows directory, 
it'll do really neat things! blah.. This wasn't just an infected file, the 
whole .com file is a virus, meaning it was intentionally spread. You'd think 
they woulda put a nice polymorphic in there or something. A couple zit faced 
13 year old FUCKS prolly made this shit. Didn't get me tho bitch, I scan 
everything before I run it, like any other sane mofo would. heh I'm starting 
to build quite a nice little collection of virii.. I could try running the 
game itself but I wouldn't touch this thing with a 286.

Well, not a whole hell of a lot to say about this, all you do is answer 
questions basically. And thanks to about 5000 .wav files, there's voice in 
it. I swear it took me about 7 minutes to delete all those .wavs. Oh well, 
this one's pretty boring, nothing major, and you prolly won't wanna grab 
this.

** Points: 48 -Pretty boring, plain and simple.

That's it for this week, not a lot out, and most of what was out is spag.

Quick greetz: ME! (heh.. no one else does!) And everyone else I know in the 
scene. You know who you are and what you do, and if you do it just to be in a 
greet list, FUCK OFF.

Well, I didn't want to have to do this, but GOTW goes to, you guessed it,
CD/RZR for both of their same releases of QUAKE.  I'm glad this shit is
finally out so I can stop listening to all you whining over it, because now
you all can see how much it sucks compared to Duke Nukem 3D.  Anyway, congrats
to both groups (if one of you feels you can not fulfill the duties, then the
crown will be given to the runner up and... oh shit that's a beauty pageant).
