This is very similar to Slipstream 2000, however, you are confined between  
tight walls.  There are around 10 different tracks to race on.  You get to  
choose your character and ship (whoopy) and race along the enclosed course.  
There are signs that tell you "hard right" or "easy right" before turns to  
help you out.  Your going to need a decent computer to play this one.  I'd  
reccomend a p/90 for VGA, and a p/133 for SVGA in order to play at a fair  
speed.  It might seem fine on a 486 in practice mode, but once you get some  
other competition when you race, it lags it down nicely.  This is a pretty  
good racing game, although the enclosure is kind of annoying.  Most people  
like to be able to freely run off track if they wish to.  When you race  
against others or the computer you are given weapons which you can freely  
fire at them.  To get you started you should know that the ?/ key (one next  
to the right shift) will make you go forward and the .> will make you go in  
reverse, although I don't know why you would need to.  Also, if you are not  
using a joystick, when you first load it, your mouse might keep moving to  
the bottom right.  It's a pain in the ass, but your going to have to, with  
your funky moving mouse, to get to the control section in the options and  
change your control to keyboard, once you do that, it's fine.  The graphics  
in this one, can become a bit repetitive, but if your looking for a nice race  
game, similar to Slipstream 2K, then try this one out.  I have no clue what  
that HI-RES text addon does, but it's nothing noticeable.  Be sure to get  
the multiplayer addon for, der, multiplayers.  
                                RATING: 67/100

|         (c) Activision           |  
+==================================+  
Somehow instead of a mantis.nfo and a malice.nfo, this release got two nfos  
from malice, one named malice.nfo and the other mantis.nfo.  However, it's a  
good thing you only need to arj this to root directory to get it to work.  
It's a win/win95 puzzle game.  You may remember the first Shanghai game, yeah  
you remember that crap?  I didn't know how to play it back then, and I'm  
proud to say, I still don't have a fucking clue.  There's a bunch of tiles,  
and you do stuff with it (that about sums it up).  I don't see why this had  
to be 43 disks for just a little puzzle game.  Anyway, it's not fun, unless  
you know what the hell your doing.  So, unless you've played the first one and  
know how to play, don't bother with the second.

In the tradition of war games, comes the fourth edition of Battleground.  
However, there really isn't much <if any> difference b/t this one and the  
previous one, other than the battle at hand.  It's your typical war game,  
with an eagle's eye view over the land and people.  You must strategically  
set up and utilize your army.  There's not much more to say about it, you all  
know what war games are like.  One thing to note about this release, I'm not  
sure who in Prestige thought it would be cute, but you may have read in the  
nfo about a "daily double avi".  The game needs to see the name of the .avi  
it is supposed to run at certain points, however rather than put a blank one  
byte .avi, PSG thought they'd put a nice Daily Double (from Jeopardy) .avi  
that is 70k.  This might all be fine and dandy, however there is a total of  
145 avi's totalling OVER 10 MEGS.  That's 10 totally useless megs, that could  
have been as small as 100k.  They could have simply done it for maybe one  
.avi, but they went a little overboard and cost us about 6 more disks to d/l.  
One other note,  when I was playing there was a constant tick-tick noise in  
the game, may have just been me, but it was really really annoying.

This is an action shoot-em-up.  Haha, no it's blackjack, what the hell else  
would it be?  Small, nice and to the point, animated characters that play  
against the dealer with you, betting, and simple sounds.  Nothing much more  
to say, it's one of those games you might want just to throw into your Win  
games directory.

Here's the somewhat awaited release of this excellent car racing game.  I was  
a little disappointed with the control methods, the keyboard setup would not  
edit.  The game has tons of configurations to play with to get it the way you  
want it.  The graphics are really only capable of being their best with a at  
least a p/90.  Less than that, makes it look similar to Stunts.  The game has  
the capability of being the best race car game ever, the question is, do you  
have the time to play around with it, and the computer to handle it.  If you  
like racing car games, you of course have to get this, and if you don't, I  
wouldn't go crazy trying to get this.  To really enjoy this one, you need to  
be able to throw up all the gfx and svga.  If you don't the game won't seem  
like anything special.  Some negative points: the computer kinda controls your  
car in a crash and stuff, so like you can't turn around and go the wrong way  
on purpose to like have fun and crash into cars.  Stupid steering controls for  
keyboard are: a & z for accelrate and break, < & > for left and right.  Over-  
all, if you have a pentium/133 you can really truly enjoy this game the way  
it was meant to be, less than that, you might have to enjoy it a little less.  
Someone wanna buy me a p/166? <G>.  That about covers it, it wasn't as good  
as I thought it might be, but it's still very good, plenty of tracks, and  
cars, plenty to do, it'll keep you busy for sure.  
                                RATING: 82/100

BICYCLE PINOCHLE (c) Swfte           [xx/09]  
I don't know how to play it, but I won 6 rounds in a row, or as they are call-  
ed `tricks'.  I suppose if for some strange reason you love Pinochle you  
should get this, plenty of options, got modem and network, and it's nicely  
put together.  It's another card game to add to your collection for win/win95.  
Voice commentation, sorta, tells ya who won and that's about it.  If you don't  
know what Pinochle is, don't bother.

rip for win95 disk [19/19]  
-Here's what I have to say about this (Oh and it's also for win3.1).  You'll  
understand this if you've heard the song `Aids Kills':  
"Stupid releases suck, word up respect this, the scene is dying slowly."  
This is a retarded release <not just releasing to the scene, but the actual  
making of it>.  All it is, is a stupid bunch of interviews, information for  
dumb people about aids and how to put on a condom, and the lyrics to the  
tracks of the CD.  This is stupid, a waste of money, and a waste of time.  
I don't see what person, who would need to know this, would actually either  
HAVE A COMPUTER or even go out and buy it.  It's about as stupid as offering  
a book on `why you should read books', the person who needs to read it would  
not be reading it, der.  Anyway getting back on track, I think their hearts  
were in the right place, but their minds were on some nice heroine.  Also  
if you listen to the interviews, you'll realize the guys speaking are a bunch  
of dumb blacks (not that I'm racist but it's true).

LINKS: LS 1997 (c) Access Software   [xx/45]  
Golf, golf, golf, how do I hate thee?  Let me count the ways, 1, 2, 3, FOOORE!  
Here's the newest edition of Links, of course there will be some EVEN newer  
version in a couple of months that will cost a little more and will be even  
better.  This one includes Arnold Palmer taking swings, and all the moving  
pictures use him.  There are 3 different courses to choose from, all with  
nice graphics (that can take a little time to load).  You can practice and  
do whatever ya want.  You can go off track and smack the ball off a house or  
plunk it into a river (fun things to do once you realize how boring the game  
is).  However it's still a great golf game, and perfect for daddy or grandpa.  
The sound is average, with the usual nasty english accent comments, such as,  
"You suck, you bloody bastard" and "God save the queen, you can't shoot for  
crap!" j/k.  Still, in order to really enjoy this one, it would be nice to  
have the full cd.

This is another card game, same company as the Pinochle one.  Not much more  
to say about this, other than, I don't think anyone really wants it.  It's  
the same format and style as the other card game release.  Same narration,  
same opening .avi file.  Once again, only get it if you want a Hearts and/or  
Spades game.

  Speed Rage - Animation Pack [01/30] &  
  
The packaging was fucked up and there was no arj .016, but I did it manually  
and was able to only play parts of the game.  The race part didn't seem to  
work, it would hit me back into dos when I tried to load it.  I was able to  
try the qualifying, and after that, I wasn't really enthused to get it to work  
100%.  It's a simple racing game, with either a dune buggy or a boat.  The  
turning however is too sharp and too sensitive, I kept smacking into the  
fucking sides every time I tried to round a corner.  Nothing special for  
this one, graphics not impressive either.  It does have nice support for  
modem/network play however.  Only bother if your desperate.  The animation  
pack addon was more impressive than the game itself.  
                                RATING: 44/100

Did you ever want to manage a soccer team from scratch and control every  
asset and have every responsibility of the team?  No?  Well tough shit, this  
game let's you do all that.  Ugly ass graphics and shitty music make this  
one a dirty mofo.  Make sure you have your mouse loaded, b/c Hybrid's little  
closing comment at the end covers up the "Must have mouse loaded" notice.  
Anyway, you get your office, you make the deals to play in whatever cups or  
charity events, etc.  You hire, you fire, you make money, you lose money.  
Don't you just hate these games that are more of a job then they are fun?  
                                RATING: 37/100

      Here is the all new, win95 version of this  
      hit game from Maxis Software! Enjoy!  
______  
  
First question: You got about 413 megz free? That's what it takes for the   
zips (70M), rar files (70M), and the install directory (273M). Also, reflux   
lied, in the .nfo. It says 200M needed, even at the bare minumum, you'd   
need 273M.. But I suppose no one'd leech it if it said 300 would they?  
Second question: Do you really want to play this? Well, maybe. I personally   
ain't a big fan of the SimXXXX games, but this one don't look all that bad.   
There's quite a few different islands, each with a different thing you're   
supposed to do. Raise population, build cities, increase productivity, and/or   
anything else they throw your way. The interface could've been a little more   
intuitive, the toolbar was a nice touch though. The grafix in this one wasn't   
anything new, or spectacular, but the background music was halfway decent.   
Scrolling up/down, left/right was kinda choppy on my p90, and the music stops   
if you have a titlebar menu showing for too long. I really wasn't into this   
game too much after realizing 400+ megz were used, and a 15 minute unrar.   
So, I didn't really spend as much time with this one as I should've, and got   
kinda frustrated at the whole mess. Path0s blew his cool.. Imagine that.  
  
Note: This would however burn to CD quite nicely. When you install this game,   
it only copies over about 10M to another dir and runs the rest offa the "CD".   
So, you don't need the whole thing on your HD. Then again, would you really   
wanna smoke a rom for this??

Ahhh finally drifting out through all the spag this week comes something   
worthwhile and leave it to Razor to bring it to you (Gee, do I sound like a   
nfo file yet?) This is a fine release though. Too many options to list here,   
but they include modem/netplay, many music selections, many different   
3d boards and pieces, exp levels, a tutorial level, and some other stuff I   
didn't try, like the ability to create a character with strengths and   
weaknesses. It's pretty straightforward if you just wanna sit down and play   
though. I'm not a real big chess fan (cuz I can't really play too well), but   
I might sit down with this for a while and learn.  
- PS to Razor: Nice supah hax0r on the Install Shield!  
  
** Points: 82 -Prolly more if you're a chess fan!

Well, the game does work, but there's a few menu screens that are all screwed   
up. I couldn't really do much except the combat simulator (maybe you have to   
be a certain rank or something before they give you real missions?). The   
combat stuff is pretty decent (not as good as earthseige 2 though). Pretty   
cool fireworks display when you blow a mech up. It's got all the nifty sounds   
and that computer generated female voice. The graphics weren't all that   
spectacular (again, I didn't get to play any of the real missions). It's got   
the usual stuff, mech building, etc.. This game didn't really do much for me,   
the graphics could've been much better. If you just wanna sit down and play a   
game, it'd be alright, but if you're looking for a good mech sim, get   
Earthseige 2 from a while back ago, it's much better.  
  
* Note: This game was ripped after install, which is good cuz you don't need   
alot of extra room for install files.  
  
** Points: 71 -Not that bad, but not that great.

Dunno exactly what the deal is with this, only part of it was upped to the   
net, and then when it was supposedly finished, all the files weren't there.   
If it's all upped by next week (hey it could happen), I'll catch it then.

Welp, that's all she wrote for this week.. My pick of the week would have   
to be A.I.D.S.. HAHA NOT! What's up with all the nonworking shit and general   
spag lately? Come on, have a little pride in your work. All the leechers   
depend on you, the groups, to provide us with quality. It's getting to the   
point where I have to give at least a 50 to a game if it just works. Blah..
