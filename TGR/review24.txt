-Rating scale:
                 (0-19)/100 = In a nutshell, it sucked!
                (20-39)/100 = Still crap but slightly better.
                (40-49)/100 = Possibly worth downloading.
                (50-69)/100 = Pretty decent game. Might want to check it out.
                (70-79)/100 = Worth the download if you like that type.
                (80-89)/100 = Very good, 9 outta 10 its worth the download.
                (90-99)/100 = Excellent game, a MUST download.
                    100/100 = HOLY SHIT I'VE NEVER SEEN A BETTER GAME!

RATINGS are based on the game idea, graphics, sound, playability, ingenuity,
versatility, and a lot of other words ending in `ity'.  These games are based
on what happens on MY COMPUTER ONLY, unless stated otherwise.  I always first
follow nfo directions, and if those don't work or are not available, I then
try other ways.  So just b/c it doesn't work for me, doesn't mean it won't
work for you.

TOTAL MAYHEM (c) Domark/Formgen!      [xx/22]
Damnit, I didn't have this one reviewed last week b/c Prestige states that it
is for win95, when it is actually for both.  So I copied all fucking 21 disks
to disk and then on another computer, to find out it didn't work on that
computer.  So I read the readme.txt and found out it was for win3.1 too.  So
I installed and was kinda disappointed since I thought it would be a lot like
Crusader: No Remorse.  It's the same type of game, but this one lacks any
intensity whatsoever, and the engine SUCKS.  Plus the mouse control is terr-
ible.  The graphics are nice svga, but I'd rather go down a level in gfx, and
still be more like Crusader.  You are given certain objectives and able to
buy weapons just like Crusader.  You can blow up practically anything, but
it's just not as much fun was it was in Crusader.  To put it this way, if you
wanted to d/l this, just look around for Crusader: No Remorse, it's much
better, and definitely worth the time, this on the other hand, is not.

Here's another edition with new tracks to a now popular and well known game.
Micro Machines 2 TE has all the shit it had before, but it now includes a
bunch of new courses, and an editor so you can make your own courses.  You
can also now play up to 16 people!  I think it's a good game, but the course
is just too small and cars too fast, and the turns just come up too quick and
you can't turn good enough for them.  For more about MM2 read past issues.

Seems like GNX fucked up the packaging on this one.  When you rar, and you
get to the 4th disk, it comes up with some error "Solid archive..." and then
something about needing the first one.  Anyway, maybe they will re-release it.
I was able to only extract part of an amish paradise .wav, so I have no idea
what the program is like.  Anyway Al kicks ass.

Total Knockout Championship Female Boxing x/11 
Here's the full version (despite the fact it tells you to order it) of this
excellent boxing game.  It's very, very similar to the arcade game Punch Out!,
but the graphics are far more superior, and there are special moves.  Yes,
you did read write, there are only women in the game (and you know that men
made this game, because the tits are like 3 times the size they should be).
You go through a title card of people, from "Fearleader <cheerleader>" to
amazon like monkey calling bitches.  Instead of getting TKO's, you can get
PMS! (j/k).  Anyway this is a great boxing game, only thing I could think of
to make it a little more exciting would be more types of punches (left and
right - high and low) and different reactions to getting punched because it's
sometimes hard to tell if you got hit or if you hit the other person.  Other-
wise a great game, but this little 11 disk'er does take up a whopping 68 megs.

This is the fullcd <except for the sw versions of some games> of DN3d. It
includes the following: DN 1 REG, DN 2 REG, DN3D REG, DN3D official level
editor, Doom WAD files to DN3D map file maker maker, animation files from
DN3D, DN3D music files in .mid format, DN3D sound files in .voc format, 3d
Realms and Apogee Official .FAQ, DN3D .RTS maker, DN3D univbe <for SVGA>,
and previews of: Blood, Prey, and Shadow Warrior.  The only really good use
you might be able to get out of this, is the rtsmaker, the doom-->dn3d map
converter, and the level editor (if you don't have it already).  So you
really don't need to get the game again, just get those.  Also, don't run
the install shit, just go into whatever dir you need to and run the setup.

Battleground 3: Waterloo (c)TalonSoft xx/36&====[x/12]=====[ úDúOúGúSú ]=====
Here's the 3rd in the line of this strategy war game.  I don't know how many
more detailed options they can make these war games have, but this one seems
to top the rest.  Excellenty detailed graphics showing the type of land, and
type of army on it.  However, they still can't seem to go away from those
octagonal shaped areas where you move the army to and from.  There are so
many options in this one, I'd need 30 years to type 'em all out.  I only
reccomend those with a lot of time to play this out, to get this.  The movie
addons aren't much, and not really worth it.

This game is extremely similar to Stardust.  It's pretty much exactly the
same, the only thing that is better about this one, is that you have better
control of the ship.  You can make quicker turn arounds and stuff.  Other
than that, it's exactly like Stardust, same objective, same gfx.  Just shoot
the stone'ish objects, they break up into smaller, and then smaller, and then
still smaller things (the stones, not your dick).  You will get bored event-
ually.

Wizardry GOLD (c) Sir-Tech           [14/14]
+------------------------------------------+
This one was a pain in the ass to figure out.  First off, to insure that you
don't sit through the 5 minute opening (4.5 of which are just credits), make
sure you do a nice combo of esc-enter-spacebar, and eventually the thing will
end.  Once you are in the game, you need to select 6 characters.  Once you do
that you'll finnaly get to play this ugly gfx rpg game.  It's the rpg type
where you have human/elf, etc, and you can select their skills and stuff.
It's not exactly real great, but those of you who like rpg might be able to
overlook the graphics and gameplay ;).
