on what happens on MY COMPUTER ONLY, unless stated otherwise.  I always first
follow nfo directions, and if those don't work or are not available, I then
try other ways.  So just b/c it doesn't work for me, doesn't mean it won't
work for you.

you get to pick a store you want to own, and you buy products wholesale and
the sell them in your store.  You must advertise carefully, and sell at some-
what fair prices <hey not too fair, this is a Capitalist market you know> and
try to make you and your store rich.  There is no sound which makes this only
more boring.  Unless you think this could help you plan for the future by
testing out your business management skills, then you probably won't enjoy it
at all.  It's for win/win95 and the graphics aren't too bad, but it's not a
game you'll have `fun' playing.

This isn't a game, but some of you may have thought it was.  It has to do with
games however.  It allows you to play some of the older dos games in windows.
Now why in hell you would want to do this, I dunno, maybe for someone who is
totally clueless and doesn't know how to use anything but winblowz, other than
that I don't know why you'd use it.  Anyway, if you do need it, pick it up,
nice and small, and then you can have lots of fun playing old games in win.

Same thing as the Strategy shit, except you got some even more boring puzzle    
like games.  They are: WordMax, Easy Crosswords, and Word Squares.  All of
which you can get by buying a newspaper for 25 cents.  So once again, don't
bother unless you have a need for it.  They aren't going to blow you away.

JAGGED ALLIANCE: DEADLY GAMES        [xx/40]
+------------------------------------------+
-Filenames: PSGJAG??.ZIP
Deadly Games is the follow up to the original Jagged Alliance game.  However
back in those days, games were at the most maybe 35 disks, and they had sound
clips and intros and what not.  Today you get 40 disks, and all you get is the
frigging core shell game itself.  No speech, no intro, no nothing.  You're
really better off just getting the 1 level demo and be able to experience it
much better.  The game goes like this, you have a mission to accomplish, and
you select your crew of men or women, dorks or psychos, scientists or drunks
on probation to help you out.  You pay their salary, you get to use them how-
ever you want to.  The people are equipped with all different weapons and
knowledge, ability, resources, and other stuff.  You use them on a map like
game engine to manuever them to the main objective, without of course getting
them killed.  The graphics did not impress me, as they were a lot more blurr-
ier and less detailed then they were in the original.  There is no speech <see
sound addon review>.  The game will certainly challenge you, and is not an
easy game, and the computer ain't a dimwit.  However it does take a while for
the computer to act out it's turn <b/c the game is based on turns where you
only have a certain amount of points of action to do things like walk, shoot,
or anything else>.  Anyway, if you do plan on enjoying this one, you will
need the addons, so read the reviews on those too.  The RATING for this game
is BASED ON ON THE CORE OF IT only, so to judge what it would be like with the
addons, add each addon's rating accordingly.

Yes, you need to get another 49 disks, ON TOP OF the original 40 disks just
to play it over your network.  You can't just get this alone, so enjoy the
humongous space hogging.  Remember, add each addons rating to the original
game to figure out what your final rating would be.

This is the addon, that if you bother to even get any, you should get.  It's
not exactly worth the 55 disks, but it makes the game a lot more realistic
and enjoyable.  Now you'll be able to hear your people say how much of an
idiot you are and you can hear them cry out in pain.  Also you can hear the
mission briefings <not everything he says, but some of the stuff he says>.
So if you found that you liked the plain game, then look into getting this.

Additional Jagged Alliance Notes and Help
=========================================
Although I wasn't able to get to it in the limited time I have, I am told that
the game crashes after the 2nd or 3rd mission.  Well a person named MrData was
kind enough to suggest this method for fixing that problem.  I'm pretty sure
it works, but if you are having problems, it couldn't hurt too much to try
this out, or you can try out the second method listed after, OR you can get
the fix released by a group called Axis.
(1) Copy any file from GUS directory to MIC directory,
(2) Then rename that file to those files that are in MIC directory.
<EX> Like this: goto GUS directory
           copy 95A X:\DEADLY\MIC
           goto MIC directory
           copy 95A 96A
           copy 95A 96B
           copy 95A 96C
           copy 95A 96M1
           copy 95A 96M2
           then you can delete 95A

--OR-- You can use this .bat file <just copy it and follow the directions>
@echo off
echo.
echo Jagged Alliance Deadly Games Level 2+ Fix
echo =========================================
echo  This fix should be run from /DEADLY games dir or whichever dir game was
echo  Un-RARed into.
echo.
echo Please wait...
copy GUS\95a MIC\96a
copy GUS\95b MIC\96b
copy GUS\95c MIC\96c
copy GUS\95m1 MIC\96m1
copy GUS\95m2 MIC\96m2
echo.
echo Patching Complete... Game should now work past Level 2
echo.
--END of .bat--

If you do find an interest in getting Jagged Alliance, the most suggested
thing to do would be to get the original game core <40 disks> and if you find
you really still like it, you should get the sound addon <55 disks>, which
will give you a grand total rating of 78/100 <95 disks however>.  The game
is very similar to the game Deadline, however it's much more sophisticated,
and on a totally higher game engine design.  So in conclusion, the general
rating for Jagged Alliance will be the below listed which is basically an
overall estimate, not total, of the game and it's addons.
                        RATING: 74/100 <General Avg. Total>

Minimal Rip of Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games

You could just say "screw all those addons and those huge amounts of disks to
d/l" and get this simple, 9 disk, perfectly working game.  A major congrats
to these couriers for nicely cutting this game down, and to be honest, I did
not notice any differences of importance between this and the 40 disk PSG
release.  It works fine, no need for a fix.  So get this one if you can find
it.  I'm not sure if the addons will work accordingly, but you don't need
a network addon because this one works with it, or so they say.

-Filenames: PSGQBC?.ZIP
Another great game this week, is this football game.  Graphic modes to support
those with p/166's all the way down to those with a 486/25.  This game has it
all, from the touchdown dancing, to the linebacker's screaming "I'm going to
get you suckah', to measuring with the chains for first downs, and plenty of
weather, field, and other options to keep you busy with.  It has of course
the full seasons, simulation and a quick play option.  It's a great game, and
it definitely is worth getting if you play football games.  It has all the
real players (pictures of some too) and teams.  It's just a really good foot-
ball game, with tons of camera angles to customize it the way you want to see
it.  Nice close up action, so the guys don't look like little stick figures
from a blimp.  This one has got it all....except modem play.  No need for any
cracks or addons <just have a cd popped in> and you're ready.

Basically this is 4 avi files.  Two of which are a waste of space, the acclaim
and iguana <makers of the game> avis.  The other one is the intro, which does
not even play and can't be viewed with an avi viewer b/c of some weird decom-
pression it uses.  The other is the avi for when you win the superbowl, which
might end up being the only one you ever even see.  So is it worth it?  Hell
no.  Don't bother even if you liked the game, unless you really think you'll
win the superbowl and want to see the 26 second avi.

You know, I wasn't feeling tired at all, until I played this game.  Now I'm
ready to go hibernate.  In the SSI tradition of war games, comes Great Naval
Battles #529,637,245.  The difference from the last one?  Nothing other than
different scenarios and some options you'll never use anyway.  It's just yet
another war game with lots of statistics and graphics that remind you of road
maps <ok well ocean maps, but I don't think you read those too often>.  There
didn't appear to be any sound in the game, even though there is a setsound.exe
and they said they didn't rip anything out.  Only for those dying for a war-
game, and even then you could go get Jagged Alliance.

Here's a cheapy pinball game.  There are three tables, a jungle-cavelike one,
a futuristic wannabe one, and uhh well another one.  They are not that good,
mainly because it is way too hard to follow the ball because it goes too fast
for the screen and the colors they chose for the balls are stupid because
they blend in with the background at times.  The game is pretty basic, not a
lot of `inside' games in them, except for the second one which has foosball in
it.  It supports low and hi res gfx mode, except the low-res is close up and
goes too fast, and the hi-res <yes the hi-res> is further away and looks like
shit and makes it hard to see some things.  Unless you need one, don't bother.

Bubble Bobble Combo (c) Acclaim      [01/04]
+------------------------------------------+
-Filenames: BOBBLE-?.ZIP
Here's the classic game, which I thought was that game with the bubble and
like you blow them up and trapped the guys in it, but I guess I was wrong,
because this is the one where you are some faggot little kid and you can shoot
rainbows and kill the little bugs and you collect fruits and vegetables (b/c
they are healthy and good for you) and you move up higher and higher, then
you move to the next level and then eventually you get to a boss.  It's not
too hard, very simplistic, but the controls are a little annoying (a for left,
w for jump, d for right, and spacebar to shoot faggot rainbows).  The graphics
will remind you of your old nintendo games, be sure to get the fix to make it
work <and put it in the /bubble/game directory, not just /bubble.

This one get's it to work, here's the excuse...I mean nfo <G>:
  "Most crackers use Soft-Ice/W to crack 4GW/DOS programs, for this reason
   the cracker probably didn't test whether the game works in dos
   environment, as expected, I come to the rescue and release a better
   cracked version (that doesn't even check the floppy drive)."

This is a figthing game <and look from Apogee too>.  It's kinda crappy, but
yet kinda good.  The characters are nice and close up, but perhaps too close
and too bulky.  They are limited to a strong and weak punch.  They do however
have certain moves per character.  There are finishing moves and all sorts
of secrets too.  The sound is pretty good and the music is even better.  But
the graphics are not that impressive, even with the SVGA on.  It has enough
options, setting up keyboard and joysticks, and game options to let you make
it the way you like.  There are however only a choice of 8 different charac-
ters to choose from.  If you do get it, be sure to check out the "Demo" from
the menu, it's actually the intro, with a demo at the end of it.  Not bad for
it's size, and if you like fighting games it's worth looking into, however
you can easily beat this one or easily get bored with it.
                                RATING: 60/100

Well this is supposed to be for Win 3.1 too, but apparently it isn't or some-
thing.  I unarjed the mofo <to root too> and then pkunzip'ed the cracked .exe
and then ran it in windows, and it came up with a Win32s error saying some
shit .dll was not in the library.  So that only leads me to believe it's miss-
ing some win files or doesn't work.  Path0s tried to get it to work also, see
his problemsin the win95 section.

I reviewed the beta a few weeks ago, here's what I said about it then:
"I'll like it a lot better once the final comes out. I do have to say that the
synth muzak flippin rocks though and the grafix are a lot better than average.
This will prolly be one of those "unbelievable directX games" I talked about a
couple weeks ago. As far as the juice of the game, you can pick one out of
about 10 of the most popular monster trucks to race with.  Theres 4 different
types of races too. Drag (side by side car crush), Rally (offroad enduro
type), Circuit, and Tournament. You can set up suspension, gearbox, and tires
on your truck for the different types of tracks/races.  Don't have more than 4
other trucks racing against you when you first start out tho, the traffic
kinda sucks. There's many different resolutions, textures, and toggles to
optimize video/processor speed, as well as audio, and joy/keybd setup. As a
little side note, from what I gather about the help files included, MS is
planning on devoting a whole webpage to this game, with possible tournament
type netgames once the game goes final. This one will definately be worth 
checking out!"
To be quite honest, I couldn't see a whole lot of difference between this
version and the beta. I think some of the screens looked different in the
final, but nothing by way of game play. It still swaps in the middle of
gameplay, which is kinda funny that all the directX games I've played don't
run choppy cuz of a swap, plus I really dont think it should swap with 16M of
ram with nothing else running.
Same score as the beta. Still a great game!

** Points: 74 - Good game, but still had the swap problems like the beta.

** NOTE: This game is supposedly for Win AND Win95, however it gave Ionizer
         some weird Win32s errors, but it runs fine under Win95.
A cool sim type of game. Your job is to set up a company and produce products
to sell. It's not the average simcrappy type of game though. You play the role
of a plant manager, and you have to set up and place machines, and workers for
the machines, as well as different office people and so forth. There was only
one major problem with this, the largest time advance you could set was 10
minutes. Meaning you could only jump 10 minutes at a time in the game.
It takes a little while to setup as far as purchasing your machines, and
getting your employees settled, but after that, rock and roll... Lotsa stuff
to look at, mess with, and fuck up :P
This one's a winner.. Kept me busy longer than I shoulda been :)

** Points: 81 - At least give this one looksee, unless the only games you play
                are 3d kill em all clones.

*** A hardware-only DirectDraw object creation was attempted but the driver 
did not support any hardware.
        Could not initialise DirectDraw.
Umm bullshit. MS Monster truck just installed directX2, OSR2 comes with 
DirectX, so this things on crack. My guess is that a file was left out or 
something.. Dunno. If anyone else gets this thing to work, mail me and let me 
know how.

** Points: NA - DirectX error, on a perfect directX2 system.
