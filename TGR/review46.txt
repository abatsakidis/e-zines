-Rating scale:
                 (0-19)/100 = In a nutshell, it sucked!
                (20-39)/100 = Still crap but slightly better.
                (40-49)/100 = Possibly worth downloading.
                (50-69)/100 = Pretty decent game. Might want to check it out.
                (70-79)/100 = Worth the download if you like that type.
                (80-89)/100 = Very good, 9 outta 10 its worth the download.
                (90-99)/100 = Excellent game, a MUST download.
                    100/100 = HOLY SHIT I'VE NEVER SEEN A BETTER GAME!

RATINGS are based on the game idea, graphics, sound, playability, ingenuity,
versatility, and a lot of other words ending in `ity'.  These games are based
on what happens on MY COMPUTER ONLY, unless stated otherwise.  I always first
follow .nfo directions, and if those don't work or are not available, I then
try other ways.  So just b/c it doesn't work for me, doesn't mean it won't
work for you.

This was a nice fucking waste of my time.  I followed the directions, as
always, and then after that there was no .exe <icon> in the window, other than
an uninstall and readmes.  So I just assumed that you would run the main .exe
in the main install dir.  So I ran it, title screen came up fine, then it
showed the credits.  But then after that it said "Error cannot find commun-
ication device."  Now, my modem was on, not that it had anything to do with
this anyway, but I don't know what fucking communcation device it's looking
for, and you probably won't either.  The nfo said it was for all of the
following OS's: win95, winnt, dos, os2, win3.x.  I don't see how it works
for dos, but that's what the nfo said.  I think this may have been for win95
only, but the group doesn't get a review then b/c they fucked up the nfo.

What can you say about this game, it's just a really bad platform game.  It's
way too busy <meaning it has too much going on> and the girl/she-wolf jumps
like a sissy.  It's just not fun.  The graphics are nothing special, if you
could even classify them as decent.  The sound is internally set really low,
so crank up your volumes.  You're some kind of wannabe Jill of the Jungle,
and you can turn into a wolf (it loks more like a pig, but that's not import-
ant).  But you can't just turn into the wolf-pig whenever you want, because
you have to enough potions and shit, and it's just too boring.  Don't bother.
And as if you wanted to play this game any more, you can grab the 7 disk level                                
editor...but I really don't think you will do get either.

Once again, someone has decided to release a version of this game without
first cracking the CD check.  So don't bother because you will only be prompt-
ed to insert the worms cd, just like the last time someone released this game.

This is a cute little puzzle game.  Your this fat blobby small guy on a maze
like boards who has a sword.  You swing the sword in a 360 degree direction
and the object is to hit yellow balls to turn doors on and off.  There are
sometimes little monsters that you must kill with your sword.  The graphics
aren't that good, decent midi music, and repetitive sound effects.  I believe
the side of this box says: "Requirements: A computer and the ability to use
your brain."  So if you don't have both of those your in trouble.

Well that's so sweet of this group to package up the games released by Webfoot
which have already been put out by Reflux.  So, in honor of their duping
ability, I will just mention the name of the game, and then the issue # of
the review it was in.
Chain Reaction, Issue #42.  H2O, Issue #25.  Cyborg: Hopy One, Issue #42.
Twinblok, Issue #19.  Tronic (This one seemed corrupted and I was unable to
locate the issue it was in), Issue #??.

==================
-Filenames: P-PACK?.ZIP
Oh joy, what a nice job of packaging this one.  This supposed to be a collect-
ion of "puzzels" as they spell them.  However, once you find that you got
5 .exe's which then are unzipped, and then finally installed, you will realize
how much time you have wasted (unless of course you read this first) b/c you
will only end up with a readme and an uninstall program.  GREAT JOB OF RIPPING
THIS ONE, you ripped the entire game!  Anyway, I didn't test each .exe b/c
there were 6 different ones, and after this happened on the 3rd one, I assumed
they were all like that.

A required .DLL was not found: VIDEOSERVICES.DLL

Also, in the "bonus release" included, both the setup and the .exe is infected
with major.1644 virus. Yay rah.. Damn, if yer gonna go through the trouble,
find a good one.. Ionizer had alerted me to the possible virus, but I scan
everything before I run it anyway.. So should you. If you don't scan releases
before you run them, you're just a fool and deserve the nasties you get.

POINTS: -90 for originality on the virus. Another -50 for a broken release.

Cool.. Been a while since something halfway decent has came out.. This is
basically a Mech Warrior type of game. I even plugged in the ole MS Sidewinder
pro for this one. Although it didn't support the extra 4 buttons like
Earthseige II did, it still was able to use throttle/rudder/hat. Every single
control was able to be user defined too. The grafix as a whole were pretty
much average, but the sound/in-game voice wasn't too bad at all. Probably the
coolest thing about this is that you can get out of your Mech and walk around.
In the off chance your mech gets blown up, you don't die, you just get
auto-ejected out of your mech. When that happens, the other guy gets out of
his mech and ya go man to man with grenades and a laser rifle. If you happen
to beat him, well, hey, free enemy mech to strut around in! Of course, there's
the off chance that the mech you lost to is a two seater, in which case the
guy that gets out AND the mech is looking to wax your ass (Not fun!) You also
have to get out of your mech to do certain things. Like in the 2nd mission,
you have to get out to go into a control center for a drawbridge so you can
lower it and go across the river. Pretty cool I guess. As far as speed and
shit goes, it actually ran pretty decent on this p90 & 16M machine. My vid
card prolly slowed it down some, so if you got a new leeto 3d card and 32M,
with a p133 (umm send it to ME!) this thing should really kick ass. I think
I'll just shut up and let you go leech it, cuz this is prolly the best W95
game in the past few weeks. (BTW, hit 'h' during the game to get a listing of
commands and stuff..)

** POINTS: 82 -Good speed, and somewhat unique.. Decent game.

Hrmm.. 47 disks for chess.. Are you dumb? No, so I would imagine that you
could really give a rat's ass about this. I know I really dont. Well, ok, I'll
describe it a little I guess. It's chess. It's 47 disks. Hmm good enough? heh 
heh Ok, if you like play chess for money, or are a serious chesshead (get it..
chesshead.. Sorta sounds like cheesehead.. hrmm ya..god I kill me) then by all
means, this is the game for you. But for everyone else, chuck this one into 
the recycle bin and get all your precious megz back. All I really did with 
this is loaded it up, started a game, and said, "Yulp.. It works, it's chess, 
and it sucks." So here's what the nfo says about the features:

   ≥   Features:                                                          ≥

There ya go..

and played the game.. This really isn't all that bad of a game, but it's just
got a frustrating quality about it. Too much puzzle in it or something I
guess. There's 4 main missions (maybe more, but it only showed me 4), and 4
or 5 characters you can be, and about 5 different helicopters (each one having
different abilities and so forth). I played all the way through one mission
(they're made up of multiple stages) and was fairly frstrated with the whole
thing. It really ain't a sim so to speak, but more of a terminal velocity
type of flying game. I just figured out why I don't like this a whole lot,
it's a real pain to change altitude, because you dont go forward or backwards
while you're going up or down. It's either-or. There are a lot of different
types of power ups, and the weapons are pretty cool. As far as grafix and shit
go, they're pretty good overall, I think there coulda been more detail in
certain places though. This game reminds me alot of what you would get if you
crossed Terminal Velocity with Descent, and added a few semi-hard puzzles to
it. As far as leechability goes, it's definately a unique game, something I
really haven't seen before, but it is rather frustrating at times. It just
seems like the helicopter doesn't go as fast as it should, and that whole deal
with the altitude change sucks too.

POINTS: 64 -Nice grafix (mostly), but just really isn't a fast, seat of your
           pants type of game like you'd expect.

Got a nasty empty feeling this week. Leeched 7 releases thinking, "Cool, 
finally I'll have a kick ass review week.." But nooo.. Junk don't work. 
Problem number 2 this week was the inability of the .nfo writers to actually 
write a correct and easy to understand .nfo with regards to exactly what 
platform the game will run on. I actually seen an nfo that said the game 
would run on dos/win/win32/os2/unix.. Nice. Bleh.. Cya next week.

Greetz: All 5 million people I've kickbaned from various channels in the past
week. Here's a buck, go buy a clue.

Look for my webpage coming soon to a url near you.
