-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
=Red Ghost=
        RazorCD, 14 disks.  A multi-challenging stratigical tank/plan/etc
game.  The graphics aren't as good as Razor makes it sound in the nfo.  The
game is a little complicated and would require in depth playing to figure it
all out.  You're presented with missions to accomplish, and a playing field
with icons of tanks, buildings, roads.  Wouldn't reccomend this to anyone who
is looking for some fun quick.
                                RATING: 61/100

=Defcon5=
        RazorCD, 3 disks.  Me unzip, me run install, me subst E: D:\games\
defcon5\install, me run install, install bad, install tell me no open
install.ini, me no happy, me want to play game that razor nfo say "This game
is a killer!"  Me now wonder why me talk like caveman.
                                RATING: NA/100

=Wayne Gretzky and NHLPA All Stars=
        RazorCD, 30 disks.  Ahhh, nothing like a game where you can sit back,
relax, and KICK SOME ASS!  An EXCELLENT hockey game, it's not NHL '96, but
at least the sucker moves more than a frame per minute, has sound, pictures
and real players/stats!  It even has close up fighting!  This game is a must
for all hockey fans.  It may not be the best out their, but it's pretty good.
The playing field is a view from center ice, but up a few rows for an angle.
Oh, but one thing, umm can anyone figure out how the hell to score?  I think
I took about 75 shots off of Brodeur and not one in.  Actually, I finnaly got
a few in, it's hard, you gotta like shoot and have it deflect and then have
another guy smack it in, or you can try to get lucky around the post.
                                RATING: 81/100

=Mystic Midway: Rest In Pieces=
        Legacy, 9 disks.  I followed the directions for exactly, cept I used
D: instead of C:, and it just didn't work/install properly.  I then went for
help from someone from Legacy, and his directions did not work either.  It
would keep saying "cannot find data, please run install" <or something like
that>.  They told me I wasn't missing out on much anyway.
                                RATING: NA/100

=Congo: Descent into Zinj=
        Legacy, 38 disks.  An excellent adventure game for windows.  You are
in the congo, a vast jungle.  You're equipped with nothing but a knife, you
must use mad skillz to get this bitch your supposed to rescue.  Excellent
graphics, music, and sound effects.  A walkthrough for this one would be
great, since I'm stuck.  My boat doesn't seem to go anywhere when I go in it.
                                RATING: 86/100

=Impact (Full CD)=
        RoR, 5 disks.  A jump and shoot arcade like game, similar to Realms
of Chaos.  Nothing special, nothing negative.  You'll get what you expect
from it.  Graphics nothing to brag about, music ok, sfx are limited.  Move-
ment is normal, characters are boring ;).
                                RATING: 53/100

=Commodore 64 Action Pack=
        RazorCD, 5 disks, Win95.  This collection of 15 games is sure to put
you to sleep.  We have PC's for a reason, why bring back this old crap?  I
mean they are not classics, so who the fuck wants them?  I could understand
bringing back pacman, donkey kong, jumpman, etc... but games like "Toy
Bizzare", come on...what a waste of production.
                                RATING: 37/100

=Battle Stations: USS John Young=
        Energy, 5 disks.  The intro worked, too bad the game didn't.  There's
no method of subst/fakecd/cdemu2/etc, that worked for it, I tried the all, in
different ways, and everytime it would say it needs the cdrom.
                                RATING: NA/100

=Cybermage=
        RazorCD, 23 disks...
 "RAZOR CD brings you Origin's Cybermage. This is Origin's answer
 to DOOM. In this hot release you can use tanks, aircars, skybelts
 or just walk. You have 14 weapons and 8 super powers to chose from.
 This is an excellent game and well worth the download. From all of
 us at Razor 1911 and in the spirit of the holiday season. ENJOY!!"
        If this is Origin's answer to doom, boy are they in fucking trouble.
This is a cartoonish like doom, the graphics are cartoonishy smoother than
doom, but the game is a gay ripoff.  The game is not even full screen <and
it doesn't matter what system you have>.  You'll either hate this or love it,
but in my opinion it's a waste of time.  If you like doom types, then you'll
probably like this, but if you've seen enough, then don't even bother.
                                RATING: 47/100

=Power Dolls=
        RazorCD, 18 disks.  They knew it sucked, yet they released it anyway.
Let's just forget about the downloading part, this one isn't even worth the
effort of installation.  It's a chinese-character type game with battle plans
and tactics, but it's not exactly your classic war game.  Save some energy
and move on to something else.
                                RATING: 24/100

=Fatal Racing (DISK)=
        Razor, 6 disks.  No sound, but not such a bad car game.  It's not
N4S or Screamer, but it's pretty decent for a 6 disker.  The absence of sound
makes it seem empty however, and if your computer can handle the SVGA in full
screen, it looks very good.  It'll keep you occupied for a little, just pop
a cd in your box.
                                RATING: 51/100

=Brainiacs 2nd Edition=
        RoR, 3 disks.  Another 3 win/win95 board games of high quality.
These include some games you've prolly never heard of.  Reversi-like othello,
Hoppers-like Chinese Checkers but with a square board, and Hex-like..err..
like....it ain't like anything, it's a weird ass game where you connect your
balls to the other side (it doesn't hurt don't worry).
                                RATING: 68/100

=This Means War=
        RazorCD, 8 disks.  It's a cross of C&C and Sim City, for windows.  
The graphics are like Sim City, the style of game is a little like C&C, but
the sound effects and voices are annoying as hell.  "The Com- The <mand>
Comman- The <d> Command center is under attack!" <think of that being said
with an operator like voice, pretty nauseating."  Overall, if you can figure
out how to play and deploy your troops into battle, then you should be able
to enjoy this for a while.  Oh, and BTW: don't get scared from the introduct-
ion, it's just showing how a doom like game had a virus that destroyed the
world's computers and important shit.  You're not really getting a virus, you
dumb shit.  And also, after running the razor install, copy the .dll in the
dlls dir to your /windows/system dir.
                                RATING: 71/100

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Small selection this week (der small week), but If it does in fact work 100%
and I just can't figure out hwo to get the boat working, then the game of the
week would have to go to Legacy for their release of CONGO: DESCENT INTO ZINJ
The voices are all in tact in this release, and you won't remember your even
in winblowz.

                            <*>CORRECTIONS<*>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-After further, more in depth review of Terminator: Future Shock, I have
decided that I underrated the game.  The rating of 44/100 is nowhere near 
what it deserves, and I have decided to give it a 75/100 upon further playing
of the game.  I also would reccomend a computer above 486/66 for it.

-Legacy's release of Tony Larusa Baseball 3 was in fact, not a dupe, and I
apologize for stating it as one.  The previous release of TLB3 was a beta.

-Please note, due to my refusal to install that crap you know as Win95, I am
of course not able to review any win95 games.  HOWEVER recently my sister got
a computer w/ that shit pre-installed, so occasionally I will be able to rev-
iew some win95 games.
(+)I'll be away during the vacation, and therefore unable to review any games.
(+)Depending on how much and what is released during this time will determine 
(+)if I plan to catch up or not.  Have a Happy Holiday(s).
-That's it for this week, hope it was of help.
