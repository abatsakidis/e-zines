-Rating scale:
                 (0-19)/100 = In a nutshell, it sucked!
                (20-39)/100 = Still crap but slightly better.
                (40-49)/100 = Possibly worth downloading.
                (50-69)/100 = Pretty decent game. Might want to check it out.
                (70-79)/100 = Worth the download if you like that type.
                (80-89)/100 = Very good, 9 outta 10 its worth the download.
                (90-99)/100 = Excellent game, a MUST download.
                    100/100 = HOLY SHIT I'VE NEVER SEEN A BETTER GAME!

RATINGS are based on the game idea, graphics, sound, playability, ingenuity,
versatility, and a lot of other words ending in `ity'.  These games are based
on what happens on MY COMPUTER ONLY, unless stated otherwise.  I always first
follow .nfo directions, and if those don't work or are not available, I then
try other ways.  So just b/c it doesn't work for me, doesn't mean it won't
work for you.

Well besides the fact that this is like old, I tried to run it.  There was
just a setup.exe which you were supposed to run, but when I did it gave me
some bullshit about not enough memory and to close some windows.  I of course
have plenty of memory and had nothing else even running.  I took a look at the
.gif's that come with this, and it looked like they were just ripped off
internet sites.  Don't believe me, then try it for yourself.

Well this is supposively very good on PSX.  However this port doesn't make the
grade.  While the game itself is pretty cool, it's got a lot of faults to it.
For one thing, the car goes too fast for the narrow road it is on, and the
tracks are extremely small.  The steering is way to sensitive.  The game is
almost a blur b/c it goes too fast.  There's lot of different graphic modes
for this Go-Cart racing game.  However no matter what gfx mode you use, the
game play doesn't utilize the entire screen and it's kinda annoying.  You race
on many courses that have lot's of weapons and shit to grab so that you can
beat your opponent up if you can't beat him in the race.  This game coulda
been a lot better if they pumped it up to full screen and just made the width
and length of the courses longer, because it's just not a shitload of fun the
way it is now.  There is also a demolition board, similar to Destruction Derby
but not as good.  There is also split screen for two player mode.  But all
this doesn't help if the actual game play isn't too hot.
                RATING: 54/100 <coulda done so much better>

I can't believe this group had the nerve to say this in their nfo:
"If you think this is a child's game your sadly wrong, I think we should take
note of this new cool game. I sat here for hours playing it."
This is exactly that, A KIDS GAME.  It's a stupid children's game of mazes.
It's got a nice story line however, but it's like Pacman, but with more colors
and different enemies.  If you got a little kid who likes colorful cartoon
animated games, you might want this, but it gets boring really quick.  You're
a stupid fish who has to pick up these green pieces of turd in a maze, with
who the fuck knows how many levels.  Nicely put together, but boring game
concept.

While most of this, well actually all of the words, is in chinese, no one
said you had to be a genius to play a fighting game, and that's because you
don't need any of the words.  Just select the first gibberish from the menu
and smack enter a couple of times and then your in the game.  It's a fighting
game where you move along from scene to scene, pick up weapons and food, etc.
It'll get pretty dull and boring after you beat the 3rd or 4th boss, if not
before that.  I didn't find any sound in this cocksucker even after using the
setup.exe.  If you like repetitive fighting games, then go for this one,
daniel-son.  If not, "me suggest yoo looky looky elsewhere."

Haha.  This is a funny theme.  The game uses the same engine as Duke3D.  The
setting however is much different.  "Ya' shee now, down herez in hick-sh-ville
we have's to shoot chicken-sh and sh-tuff.  Dis'h'ere game is mighty funny if
you like making fun of ush' dumb hick'sh."  Although I couldn't get it to work
w/o the sound off, the game was pretty funny.  It says there's a lot of fuck-
ing cursing, so I fucking missed out on that fucking aspect of it, cuz I
really wanted to hear the goddamn fucking cursing.  This is only Alpha Demo 
of it, so it's not anywhere near the entire thing.  The game takes place,
at least from what I can tell, outside, and you shoot chickens, big old hick-
looking guys, and all that fun stuff.  You of course, like any good hick, are
armed with a shotgun.  This only runs in SVGA, so you'll need at least a p/75
to run it smoothly.  The shooting is slightly off, but there wasn't any other
noticeable bugs.  Get it for a laugh, it's kinda funny.
PS:  See pathos's opinion and more detailed review on this in the win95 sec.

This game is so blah.  You're some investigator or something and you go all
around to different towns and you are involved in a bunch of different things.
Sometimes you have a little shoot-em-up at the warehouse and sometimes you
have to solve a puzzle.  The graphics really suck and I don't believe there
was any sound to be found.  For the size it is (2.8megs/disk) X (35 disks)
it just isn't worth it.  There's so much to do in the game that it's almost
overwhelming, but the graphics make it seem to shitty.  However, if you like
comprehensive games you might enjoy this, but I don't see how.

"Holy Shit!" No, that's not me talking there.. Thats the actual startup 
sample. heh heh.. I realize that this is a demo, and an alpha demo AND last 
but not least for Dos, but I just really couldn't fucking pass this up. 
Besides, there's only one other review in here, so fuggit. This basically 
looks like duke nukem in the middle of Hickville, Arkansas. For the readers 
outside of the USA, take 1/2 of the most illiterate, drunken, ass backwards 
people in your country, stick em in a state, and you've got arkansas 
(Pronounced BTW as "arkensaw") Now that we've got the basics down... 
You're in upper Hickville, Arkansas complete with corn fields, barns, and an 
old fashioned water tower.. oh, did I fail to mention that your neighbors 
would rather spit their chaw on ya than look at ya? Well, ok, maybe just shoot
ya... The weapons are great (theres only 4 different ones in this demo), 
consisting of a crowbar (equal to the foot in duke), a revolver, a shotgun, 
and dynamite.. Yulp I said dynamite! "Gonna fry yer ass in molasses!" 
Actually, if you play this, be careful with that shit, cuz I couldn't figure 
out how to throw it after I lit it.. haha Suflee` o hick. The voice-overs and 
sound effects are great and dont forget to read the readme file with it.

If I were you, I'd definately leech this, but if not, make sure to grab the 
final.. for real It'll make you go watch Deliverance again. "Squeal like a 
pig, boy!"

Well, so it's another rally racing game. Whooptie shit. This is like the 50th 
one of these in the past couple a months.. However, this one has the 
distinction of being the worst one for W95 I've played. What an honor. The 
grafix weren't good at all. Really fucken grainy. There's about 3 different 
types of sounds. The car engine, the voice telling you which way to go like 
"hard right", and a dumb sounding crash when you run into the side of the 
road. This thing does keep track of damage though, but big deal, it looks, 
sounds, and plays like shit. 11 disks or not, I couldn't give this a thumbs up
if it was 2 (hmm as a matter of fact, it DOES look like it was 2 disks) Didn't
see any network play, or really anything else of interest. heh.. There were 
detail levels and the highest detail looked like shit.. The lower detail was 
just disgusting. End of this shit..

POINTS: 15 -It did work, but thats about the only thing saving it.
