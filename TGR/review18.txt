The Game Review Song (Sung to the tune of The Brady Bunch)
----------------------------------------------------------
<dun dun dun dun dun...>

Here's the story, of a kid named Ionizer,
who was busy downloading a 50 disk game,
the x-fer finnaly finished and was complete,
So he proceeded to unzip.
Things were going fine and dandy, till he tried to run the huge game,
the fucking piece of shit, didn't work, man this was really lame.

Till the one day this kid got really pissed off,
he was sick of downloading non-working shit.
So one day he decided to do something about it,
and he proceeded to write about the lame group's shit.
He dissed their lame asses for their crap,
and he praised the groups of working games.
He had not realized it yet, but that's the way he formed The Game Review!

The Game Review, <dun dun dun>
The Game Review, <dun dun dun>
That's the way he formed The Game Review, <dun-dun dun dun-dun>.

-Rating scale:
                 (0-19)/100 = In a nutshell, it sucked!
                (20-39)/100 = Still crap but slightly better.
                (40-49)/100 = Possibly worth downloading.
                (50-69)/100 = Pretty decent game. Might want to check it out.
                (70-79)/100 = Worth the download if you like that type.
                (80-89)/100 = Very good, 9 outta 10 its worth the download.
                (90-99)/100 = Excellent game, a MUST download.
                    100/100 = HOLY SHIT I'VE NEVER SEEN A BETTER GAME!

RATINGS are based on the game idea, graphics, sound, playability, ingenuity,
versatility, and a lot of other words ending in `ity'.  These games are based
on what happens on MY COMPUTER ONLY, unless stated otherwise.  I always first
follow nfo directions, and if those don't work or are not available, I then
try other ways.  So just b/c it doesn't work for me, doesn't mean it won't
work for you.

If I'm not mistaken, I believe this is Rise Of The Robots 2.  It has crisp,
smooth, SVGA graphics.  Their is however less detail then in the first one.
The sound is nothing great and could be better.  It's still pretty good, but
it will take up a whopping 160 megs on your HD.  Their is a large selection
of characters to choose from, 18 to be exact.  The game lacks the intensity
the first one had, probably due to the lack of background screen involvement
(as you may remember, often the screen background played a role, like the
cage level) and lack of player detail.  Each character has 3 punches and 3
styles of kicks, so get those super duper joysticks or just use the keyboard.
Time is alotted for special "finishing" moves at the end, so I imagine there
are some.  Variable match settings are available.  If you have the time for
it, you might want to check it out, but don't expect it to be better than
the first one.

This piece of shit is weird.  It's supposed to be a screensaver, but all it
seems to do is show a map, a line move on the map, reach a point, and then
show a picture, and then go on to the next one.  Once that's done it goes
back in order.  The point?  Who knows, I couldn't find any "entertainment" in
this one.  Besides it sucks, although it did have some pretty good music.

Well for those of you who don't know what it is (that's me included) cricket
is similar to baseball.  It has a bunch if different rules and stuff, and
it's umm weird, so go figure it out for yourself.  One little problem, Hybrid
failed to test this one out sufficiently.  Although they mention they know
about the video screen coming up in the beginning and that you can just get
around it by hitting enter to go into the game, it's still fucked up.  Once
you're in the game and you pitch the ball and the guy hits it, if he hits the
wall with it, the dumb video shit comes up again and it doesn't go away.  So
you can't play the game with this retarded shit in your way.  However, if it
did work, it seemed like a pretty cool game.

Small but cool shoot'em-up. Parallax scrolling
    and that kind of stuff. Beats TYRIAN!
(=[03/07/96]================================)
A sideway scrolling shoot em up game.  You have your little ship, you fire,
you have missions, you can build up your ship.  It's still in test form, but
it worked fine, except for when I beat the last mission, it just hung.  The
music is ok, and the graphics are ok, with decent backgrounds for 5 different
scenarios.  Not bad, but I still think they could make these shoot em ups a
lot better than they are.

Here's the final registered version of this   ﬂﬂ ﬂﬂ €€ €≤ ﬂﬂﬂﬂ  ﬂﬂ  ﬂﬂ  ﬂﬂﬂﬂ
game that RoR released a final beta of around ﬂ ﬂﬂﬂ €€ €± ﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂ ﬂﬂ ﬂ
14 weeks ago.  The reason why both groups have      ﬂ€‹€∞
different company name is because Safari is a division of Epic Megagames.
The reason for the different disk sizes is because the RCD version contains
the game plus the included demo games in the install.  A 360 degree overhead
view shoot em and rescue game.  Gfx are nothing to brag about.  I'm not one
to decide who duped who, but don't do it again, do you realize how much of a
pain in the ass it is to get two diz's next to each other on the same line?
Anyhow, here's the review from review4.txt:
"Neat little game, similar to desert storm, but not so detailed.  You can be
a tank, plane and something else (I think) that skips my mind.  Your given
missions, usually to pick up people and to get in and out of the area alive.
Nice little game to keep someone busy with."

I got a dos4gw.exe error.  Unarj'ed it with x -y -v -a, like the nfo said,
ran setsound.exe, tried it from root dir, subst, fakecd, loading mscdex,
nothing worked.  So here's what razor had to say about it:
        "Get ready for dozens of Missions in space against a brutal
         enemy in this action packed Space Adventure...
         SVGA graphics and an excellent gameplay making this game a

         The intro, some of the animations/speech have been removed..."

Although it is a huge 55 disks, if you have the time for it, it is pretty
