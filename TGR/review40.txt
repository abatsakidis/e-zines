It's games like this that make me wonder, why can't they just put out those
old fashioned, nintendo like basketball games.  This game is boring without
the soundaddon, so don't get one without the other.  The movement is annoying
because it shows three angles, one when you are on your side of the court,
another when your moving from one side to the other, and then the other angle
when you're on offense.  Now why is this annoying you ask?  Listen, I'll fuck-
ing ask the questions here, ok?  This is annoying because as the camera angle
turns, you then must also turn the direction of your player.  The game isn't
fast paced like nba jams is and it's not as sophisticated as some other bask-
etball sims we've seen.  It's got two buttons, each having two things, depend-
ing on whether or not you tap it or hold it down.  The ball movement is slow,
and when you pass it, it's like you're seeing an instant replay in semi-slow
motion.  The guys are also pretty slow and very delicate, meaning you bump
into a guy and you're called for a foul, or you lose control of the ball and
it rolls on the floor.  There are shooting fouls, so it's somewhat realistic.
The actual game overlay is similar to the EA sport games, and the actual game
play is like NBA Live '96, but with the moving camera angles.  The sound will
make the game a little better, but it's not too much except dribbling noise,
constant crowd sound, and the announcer in the beginning stating the matchup.
This one isn't too hot, coulda been much much better, but it's not, so like
go fuck yourself.

YES!  You know how fucking long I've been waiting for the Special Edition of
this game to come out?  No, guess again.  Nope, keep trying.  Nope try once
more.  Nope, keep going.  Come on, you can do it.  Yup that's right, I HAVEN'T
been waiting.  I think I saw the box of this game in the store, yeah it had
one of those "Reccomended for" stickers on it.  It said "Reccomended for 40
year old people with no jobs, no wife/husband, no life, and a strong sensual
attachment to putting pieces together."  If you think you fall under that
category than by all means get it.  You can use the shitty pictures they have
and put the pieces together, or make your own from bitmaps and whatnot.  I
think there's a word to describe people who like this...yeah...DORKS!

This is pathetic.  This is just plain lame.  All this game is, is a stupid
jigsaw puzzle incorporating 4 different story lines.  Can you guess what
jigsaw puzzle it incorporates?  Very good, "Jigsaw Puzzle Special Edition".
It's obvious what was done here, this game obviously included a copy of that
Jigsaw shit and so PSG tried to get a 2 for 1 deal and released that too.
Anyway, all you do is to solve a case, you put together a big ass jigsaw
puzzle, with shitloads of small pieces, and solve the case and advance the
lame story line.  Once again, same requirements, except now you have to have
all the above mentioned Jigsaw review, plus you need to have half a brain.
Oh, and the intro addon, all it is, is an intro avi which is simply the theme
song and credits that are done on the tv show...once again, only needed if
you are a loser.

You may recall Bud Tucker's first boring adventure.  Now they bring you anoth-
er one.  This a cartoon'ish adventure where your object is to save someone
or something <does it really matter what the thin story line is of these adv.
games?>.  You have the usual commnads of open/close, walk, look, use, move,
talk, etc.  There's not much more to say, we all know what they are like,
there are sound fx, but no speech, so listening to his annoying dialogue
sucks.  If you like adventure games, this one MIGHT keep you occupied for a
bit.  It's nothing great though.

Just when you thought you'd never have to hear about doom and any of it's off-
spring, some fucker had to go make this.  Well, it's actually not bad, well
ok it's bad, but at least the characters are just like the game.  It's doom,
but it's platform style, you run and shoot and jump <I guess that could be
considered a new feature>.  It's actually a little hard, cuz the brown monster
dudes like throw these fireballs that kill you so quick.  Be careful of your
ammo, it seems to run out pretty quick.  This one will get boring a lot quick-
er than doom 1 or 2 did, that's for sure, but it might keep you busy for 5
mins, before you realize it's too hard.

Here, finally, is a a preview of this much talked about game.  Basically, you
are a group of cops and your job is to go around the city and protect it's
citizens by blowing up shit, and killing the enemy with machine guns right on
the sidewalks in front of all the innocent bystanders.  Now see, the problem
here is, they got a good game, excellent menus, but the actual game engine
needs some major retouching.  The graphics are liveable with, but the slow
response time to the shooting, and the fact that you can't run away from the
gun shooting, and the fact that you sit there for about 1 minute of nonstop
shooting before a guy decides to die.  Plus there are way too many bad guys
to deal with for a "first mission".  Also, the screen does not go along with
your guy, meaning if you walk to the left, you gotta scroll to the left also,
which is a pain in the ass when your sitting their in a duel.  Anyway, this
game really needs a lot of work, and to just add some speech and a bunch of
missions, won't make this any better, so go back to the engine drawing board.

Well after figuring out that the only way this sucker would work was by put-
ting it on C:, I got to see the excellent pinball creativity by the fat comp-
uter programmers are 21st Century.  Now these guys know how to make a pinball
game.  However, I was disappointed to find that there was no music, just sfx.
Music for a pinball game is an essential part, b/c without it, the game is
just a bunch of ping's, ming's and ching's <like a chinese phone book>.  There
are 4 different tables to occupy you with, all with excellent graphics, and
5 different graphic modes available to suit <sp?> your needs.  The 4 tables
consist of a car-like theme, an ocean theme, hollywood theme, and a ball-park
sports theme.  They all have the ramps, multiballs, light-like score board,
and all the stuff that makes up a good pinball game.  The only thing this one
is missing is the sound, so go find a cd and pop it in.

Hmm a pretty cool game if your into soccer, which I'm not.. heh But It looks 
pretty cool so far. There were a couple beta problems, as with all MicroShit 
betas, but playable nonetheless. About the most interesting feature I found 
was an option to let you play in 1024x768 mode. I was playing in 800x600 mode 
just fine on my system, and it was pretty smooth. I don't think you're allowed 
to actually play different teams, although you can select them in the opening 
screen, one part of the game told me I was Canada, and the other part told me 
I was Uraguay, when in all reality I picked USA.. heh Oh well.. I'll review 
this in greater length once the final comes out, cuz I really hate trying to 
review betas. The final should be pretty cool for all you 3rd world soccer 
nutz, but I really wouldn't recommend leeching this beta unless you are 
seriously into soccer and couldn't live without it.

*> Points: 54/100 -I'll review this again for the final.

Hmmm, this week's a tough choice, nothing really that great, the GOTW deciding
committee <that's me, myself, and I> were thinking of giving it to HYBRID for
ABSOLUTE PINBALL...but we didn't.  Instead, the GOTW goes to RAZOR for NCAA
CHAMPIONSHIP BASKETBALL.  While this isn't the greatest basketball game, it
sure as hell beats a jigsaw puzzle game.
