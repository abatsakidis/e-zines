 didn't read the news section of #36.

As I surf through ftp sites, where I store my warez,  
I take a look at my hard drive and realize there's no space left!  
But that's just typical for a game fanatic like me,  
You know, having nothing to download is not my cup of tea.  
At 4:30 in the morning, you're waiting for a game,  
half the time it'll end up just being real lame...fool.  
Cuz I've been downloading and couriering so long, that,  
Even top uploader lists tell me that my mind is gone.  
  
I'm a man of games, I'm into playing them,  
If they dont have good graphics and sound then fuck 'em.  
But if you give me some games, and I'll give you some too,  
then tonight I'll be up late, playing against j00.

A local lamer asked for a ware last week,  
I just smiled at him, and said go to #m8leech.  
I really don't care, in fact I wish him good luck,  
'Cuz I'll be laughing my head off when he realizes the game sucks!  
But I ain't never ignored a lamer even if he deserved it,  
A Game Reviewer with an attitude, you know that's unheard of.  
He should have read T-G-R and he'd know what's cool,  
but the dumbass downloads things without a clue...fool.  
If you don't read it, you're really missing out,  
So when you leech and the game don't work,   
Please dont go shout and pout.  
  
There's no reason to not read it,  
It's really simple you dumb shit,  
It's like typing a .txt,

                 (0-19)/100 = In a nutshell, it sucked!

                (40-49)/100 = Possibly worth downloading.  
                (50-69)/100 = Pretty decent game. Might want to check it out.  
                (70-79)/100 = Worth the download if you like that type.  
                (80-89)/100 = Very good, 9 outta 10 its worth the download.

follow nfo directions, and if those don't work or are not available, I then  
try other ways.  So just b/c it doesn't work for me, doesn't mean it won't  
work for you.

I guess in the Carribean they are either so liquored up, or so fucked up from  
hurricanes that they can't even play poker the normal way.  So they have this  
Carribean poker, which just seems to be poker, but you don't get to pick up  
cards.  Anyway, I don't like it, and you won't either.  It's your typical win-  
dows card game, minimized nicely by IRQ57 so you don't need all that added  
crap to find out this game sucks in the first place.  If for some reason you  
or maybe your g-parents have a fetish for "CARRIBEAN" Stud Poker then get it.

I was taught "If at first you don't succeed try again.", so that's what I did  
after this game crashed the first time, right after the it showed the vga pic  
of the company that made it.  Then it crashed again, and I was taught, "If  
at the second time you don't succeed, try harder!".  So I did, I figured maybe  
I had to have my cd loaded cuz it gave me the typical error shit for when you  
need mscdex loaded.  But it still did the same thing, and I was taught, "If  
by the third time you still fail, then go write a review and tell everyone  
the shit don't fucking work!"  So, I'm here to tell you that this shit didn't  
fucking work for me, and probably won't work for you either, unless there was  
some kind of fight that went on with my computer and the game before I unarjed  
it, that I don't know about.  The game is supposed to be a run'n'jump game  
if you care to try for yourself.  I'm told a fix will be released soon, and  
that if you manage to get it to the intro, hit esc and it just might work.

Oh yeah!  More soccer and from Hybrid too!  All these soccer games are just  
beginning to become a big blur and start to all appear the same.  This one  
will be a little slow on anything less than a 486/100.  It's the usual soccer  
game, with tons of different controls for types of passes.  The announcer is  
there <with an English accent of course> and the crowd noise, and all the  
usuals.  The menus are very similar to the ones in Olympic Games US GOLD.  
If you like soccer and just can't get enough of it, then go ahead and get it.  
But I'm telling you, one can only have SO MANY soccer games before you just  
get tired of them all together.

This is just a smaller rip of the game, plus you can install it to any drive,  
not just C:, but still you need to put it in a dir called SDSOCCER.  Read the  
above review for what the game is like.  This rip is missing the voice commen-  
tary heard during the game.

Well this game has originality that's for sure.  It's a board game for windows  
and you start off as ice and you must make your way around the board as you  
are converted into water or steam by the many obstacles in your way.  Fun for  
the kids maybe, but not for anyone else.  Games like this should have one of  
those "Reccomended for ages 9 and below."  The graphics aren't so hot, but  
there are lotsa diff noisy sound effects to go with the game.  The game will  
get boring quick, and the game play is kind of slow, because first you have  
to click "player one" then it goes to your guy, then you have to spin, which  
takes about 5 seconds for it to do, then you finally move which could take  
like 10 seconds to finish doing, and all in all your turn ends up taking like  
30 seconds by the time it's over.  Get it for a little bro or sis, but don't  
get it for yourself.

Ok this is only a demo and all, but it's still pretty funny and it's only 3  
disks.  It's your typical MK style fighting with cartoonish like drawings.  
However there's a nice intro storyline behind it all, and it's kinda funny.  
The game just has tons of blood and guts and stuff like that for all you  
freaks who like that shit.  The intro shows some demonic character taking a  
screwdriver like tool and shoving it through some guys eye and shit.  It's  
kinda nasty, but funny at the same time.  The game play has blood just flying  
all over the place and some examples of the humor are this:  You beat the guy  
and it says "Roses are red, violets are blue, now that your dead, im going to  
piss all over you."  And he also says "What's that gray crap all over the  
floor?  Oh yeah it's all the shit I beat out of you."  And since it's a demo  
the guys even had a nice attitude about registering it, with some funny more  
funny shit.  It shows a picture of some retard going "Pwwease wegistduh ya  
game so you can raise your IQ .001 percent and get a cool `TARD CARD'"  Even  
if you don't like fighting games, just check this one out for a good laugh,  
and make sure you sit through the entire intro, then play the game and win  
against both guys and watch again.

You will need mscdex to play this one <the nfo writer said he was unsure>.  
This is a typical fly around and shoot things up.  The graphics are a little  
bit box'y and not impressive at all.  It's not too exciting, as you sit there  
with in inside the ship perspective, shooting endlessly at objects that only  
look like red dots on the map, and by the time you can see them in full they  
have already shot you down.  You use the mouse to control your movement and  
firing, but it's not too quick or slow, it's just right.  Still nothing great  
and not worth the download.

Finally, here is the final version of this game which had a 4 disk beta a  
while back, since the game is the same, here's the quote:  
"A crappy 3rd person small screen viewability game.  It makes you appear as  
though your some high-tech robot who analyzes like every piece of crap you  
find.  The viewing ability is like 1/4 of the size of you monitor.  Average  
background sfx, nothing special.   Unless you are uh....hmm...a....uhh..a  
dork, then you won't like this."  
The game won't excite you unless you love to spend hours figuring out what to  
do and getting stuff to use somewhere else, etc.  Otherwise don't bother with  
50 disks.

The wargames just keep on rolling.  I wonder who actually supports these  
games.  I mean you can only buy so many of them.  Your typical horse, people,  
and other type icons.  You have a certain amount of moves and you take your  
little turn and fire your little weapons.  You kill people, you die, you get  
bored quick.  Unless you live and die for war games don't bother.  It's got  
all the historical data and battles for you history freaks.  The graphics  
are standard, sound fx nothing great, and no music.  Tons of different buttons  
with tons of options.  Nothing much else to say except don't forget to load  
mscdex and pop in any cd, which wasn't mentioned in the nfo and the `cracked'  
.exe didn't seem to fix.  They later released a fix for this.  The intro is a  
total waste of time and totally un-needed.

Solitaire Antics            [xx/o3]  
-----------------------------------  
-Filenames: M8SOLA-?.ZIP  
This game was released to make me happy, at least that's what the motiv8.nfo   
says:  
"To make Ionizer very happy we hit the scene with this cardgame. Another of  
 those solitaire cardgames, but anyway this one is both for DOS or WIN."  
Well that's what it is, solitaire for dos or windows, just in case you don't  
have 5,000 different brands of it already.  If you own a computer and you  
don't know what Solitaire is then your name must be like Forest Gump or some-  
thing.

HONG KONG MAHJONG FOR WINDOWS       [xx/05]  
+------------------------------------------+  
-Filenames: PSGHKM??.ZIP  
Oh joy, mahjong.  How much more fun can we have in a day then a game of mah-  
jong.  I don't know how to play this game, nor do I ever wish to know.  It's  
for win/win95 and that just doesn't help.  You'll need it in the specific  
graphics mode it asks for or it'll look fucked up.  Anyway there's like lots  
of oriental ppl to choose from to pick as your opponents.  It's actually  
quite funny to pick them and listen to them pretend to be cool and be like  
"Yo" or "Hey man waz' up"...dumb chinks.  Oh shit, now that I've offended  
half the readers out there let me just tell you don't bother unless you like  
mahjong <and don't take things offensively>.  For a good laugh, take a look  
at the HK*.BMP files and see the shmucks make all these dumb faces.

The Prestige release was supposed to be cracked better and supposed to not  
need fakecd.  However after unzipping their dosarl.exe, I found that it didn't  
matter and I still needed fakecd.  So download whichever one you want I don't  
care.  This is Australian Rugby, that sport sorta like football but for those  
tougher Australians.  It's in the typical EA style with the check and X but-  
tons in the menu, lots of options.  It's hard to play the game, and trying to  
score, but I assume you could find the computer's weakness if you play it  
long enough.  Only reccomended for diehard rugby fans, otherwise it's not  
really worth your time.  The game play is an eagle's eye view at a slant over  
somewhat small looking people.  Their is a commentator, crowd sfx, but no  
music.  Not too impressive, but not too shabby.  The movie addon didn't seem  
to do much since I didn't encounter any playing of any videos in the game nor  
at the startup.

You know, I really wanted to play in Barbie's Magical Whore House, but the  
dumbass who packaged this forgot some important files, namely the barbie.exe.  
It's also missing the icon and wri file, but you could just create those your-  
self to get it to install, but without the barbie.exe your fucked.  Oh well,  
I guess Ken will just have to wait for some other whore house.

I followed the directions exactly and it appears like that D&D-CRK.COM that  
came with it doesn't do much, because it still asked for the CD.  Anyway, this  
like for the major D&D freaks out there, a collection of the following:  
5 Complete AD&D Rule Books, Players Handbook, Dungeon Master Guide, Monstrous  
Manual, Tome of Magic, Arms & Equipment Guide, 2-D MapMaker with 3-D viewing,  
Character Generators (Both Human & NPC) with printout options, and Monster  
Creation utilties, + more.  So if you're really not into D&D then don't  
bother, but if you are, I'm sure your probably going to want to keep this one,  
that is if you get it to work.

Basically this is just a Doom style game with hi-res graphics.  It ran like  
crap on my computer (486-dx2/66mhz), so I ran it in low-res.  Believe it or  
not it still ran like crapola :P.  Anyways, when I played it I didn't like it  
at ALL.  The graphics in low-res are incredibly fuzzy, but hi-res they are  
pretty sharp.  But the gameplay is very crappy, nonetheless. Somebody told me  
Marathon 1 was good on mac, and that's why they put Marathon 2 on PC.  Well,   
in my opinion they really shouldn't have :), the only thing good was the  
music/sound and the cool art before the levels.  If your starving for another  
duke/doom clone, get this, if your looking for a quality game, don't bother.  
This game is kinda lame in my standards :).

                       -WIN95 REVIEW COURTESY OF AIRDOG-  
Here is a fine NBA Licensed Microsoft basketball game.  I believe it's got all  
of the players, all teams, all pix of the players.  It's also got season,  
playoff, & exhibition modes.  This game ran quite good on my computer even  
though it's always in Hi-Res (which can't be switched), but besides that it's  
a great game.  The AI is half decent, and the realism is really good.  EX: not  
all of your shots go in, this one will be a challenging b-ball game. I never  
got to play NBA Live 96, but people have told me this one is better.  There  
are also sound and music addons released by RLX, but i never got them. The  
only thing that's tricky about this game is the installation, but RLX released  
a fix the next day I believe to fix that up, +, RAR didn't have long-named  
file support =).  The view is an overhead view, but there are no different  
camera angles.  This one smokes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
-This week's GOTW goes to REFLUX for their release of FULL COURT PRESS.  A  
great basketball game, too bad it's limited to Win95.  Speaking of REFLUX,  
it appears as though the ban on them has been lifted and forgotten.  
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
                            <*>OTHER RELEASES<*>  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
-Since a lot of games came out while I was gone, that were not worth d/l,  
 I'll just list them (the ones not reviewed), and remember, none were  
 `extraordinary' or really `must haves'.  Also listed are the win95 games  
 that Pathos will hopefully have in next week's issue:
