I couldn't agree more with the Razor.nfo when they say: "Can I say Master of
Orion 2 clone? YES! Only smaller..."  This is just like MOO2, except it is
a lot better, has music, better graphics and a lot cooler all around.  Only
for those who seem to enjoy building up cities and conquering the world and
the galaxy...so only download it if you have futures in those areas ;).  The
music in this game is pretty damn good.  For those of you who don't know what
MOO2 is, well simply put, it's a sim city like game, but it takes place in the
galaxy and run an entire planet rather than a city.

Another chink game, but 98% playable since most of it is in English.  This is
a mechwarrior-like game, but it's not as detailed.  It runs nice and smooth
and the game is simple, but it's like impossible to get any action in the
game.  I couldn't fucking find any enemies to blow up, but it is beta, and
maybe it doesn't have any.  You set up your ship and listen to the briefing
(the one part in chinese) and then launch and your out there in the wet rain
shooting two kinds of missles using the mouse.  Graphics are pretty grainy
and the lightning gets to be annoying.  You will see two little other fags
following you around the entire time, I have no clue what they do, but they
like your ass.

Hemiech Rachu Weinner.  Uhhhhh, yeah ok, great, stupid dipshits, coulda told
us that your game was 100% NOT IN ENGLISH.  Some lame card game in some lang-
uage, looks like German.  Lot's of .wav sfx and music.  The game looks conf-
using, but maybe it's b/c I had NO FUCKING IDEA what it was saying.  All I
could figure out was it had something to do with the suits of the cards.  Next
time tell us your game is not in English fools.

Both Pathos and I were not able to get this to work, but it does work.  So I
got someone else to review it, and here's what he had to say:

"This is a real time strategy game, released by a small time company,
featuring so-so graphics, and the usual "Move my pieces over there press
attack" kind of gameplay.  Of course you can make buildings, built transpor-
tation all of that stuff we have seen before.  What we haven't seen is that
during any battle, you can jump into any of your units, and command the battle
from within the unit, as well as control the unit itself.. That gives you a
perspective as seen in NecroDome.  Well, I must say fairly that the graphics
are WAY better in warcraft 2 and Red Alert (Win95 mode).  Although this game
runs well on even a pathetic 486 (Good news for the lame losers who have those
old pieces of crap :)  Well, the plot is also kind of "Been there, done it,
got the T-shirt."  it's WW2, and you pick between Germanny or USA (Kind of
funny, since Russia was who led the main battles against germany, shows how
much game developers know or want to admit).  The units include infantry,
APC's, artillery, anti tank guns, fighters, bombers, ambulances (yes you can
pick up semi-dead men bleeding from their anus and rush them to the nearest
gay bar for all to enjoy).  Do not get me wrong, if you like games which let
you decide how history went, and let you re-live wonderful realtime WW2
battles, get this game.  If not go out and buy Diablo, and play a fucking good
game for once in your life.  The sound is average, nothing special.  Back-
ground music is totaly out of place imho.

Well someone must like Cricket, cuz they are still making these games.  This
is in the usual tradition of EA style sport games.  Very well put together
and great quality.  However w/ the lack of sound, the game seems a little
dull.  You'll definitely need at least a p/90 to play this sucker, or else
the guys move slow.  If you don't know how to play cricket, then don't bother
with it, but if you like the game of cricket <for whatever strange reasons>,
then I'm sure you'll enjoy this.  Just blast some music or you might go crazy
from having no sound.  Overall, great quality, small size, I just wanna know
where those little insect crickets were? <J/K>

Here's an upbeat, cartoonish looking Jump and Run game.  The graphics are
cartoonish and not too detailed.  It's a really simple game, the music is
very good, and the sfx are pretty good too.  There's 6 different settings or
levels you can choose.  They range from forests where you can shoot the shit
out of happy plants and butterflies to haunted houses where you can shoot bats
and zombies.  You're armed with a gun, and you can pick up superbombs.  The
game is somewhat like EWJ in the aspect that during levels, you will come
across little "tricks" or special parts that require doing something other
than running and jumping.  The game seemed to get boring quick though.
For a list of cheat codes, see the closing section.

I played the demo of this already.  It's your classic run, jump, shoot game.
The graphics aren't that great, and sound is average.  It gets boring REAL
quick.  In fact it get's boring so quick. *How quick?*  It get's boring so
quick, it makes Mike Tyson fights look long.  Unless you have to play every
run and jump game out, don't bother.

Release Date: 15 JAN 1997

* Here's what the nfo said you needed to play: Pentium 60, 8 Megs RAM, 108 HD

* Here's what pAth0s *really* needed to play:

 Directory of C:\WINDOWS

WIN386   SWP     144,786,496  01-17-97 12:31a WIN386.SWP
         1 file(s)      144,786,496 bytes
         0 dir(s)       7,408,000 bytes free

Overall, it's an ok game. But as you can see, it's one memory leakin bastahd.
I imagine it would be ok if you only played for 20 minutes at a time, but I
played for about an hour and it got really swappy and laggy. Checked the swap
file, and to my dismay, that's what I found.

The game itself really aint all that bad. You race a dirtbike over about 8
different tracks, the last one being a special track on the moon in
microgravity (means you pull air for what seems to be miles). You can punch
and kick to try to knock people off thier bikes too. There's nifty tricks you
can do in the air and you'll get bonus points for em.

Joystick setup was kind of a bitch. You have to go into the config menu and
click on each movement thing (lean forward, lean backward, etc..) and then
click on the keyboard equivelant, and hit disconnect. Then you click on what
you wanna do again, and hit connect, then the joystick checkbox, then the
joystick movement to do it with. It's just a pain cuz you gotta do it for all
of the movements and it's setup for keyboard. Also, it told me that some of my
joystick movements conflicted with others, but it'll say that for stuff like
right/left turn where they both use the x axis.. Same for lean forward/back.

There's support for 2 player mode as well as multiplayer network (untested).
Hey, for 2 player, would you need 288M of swap space?

**POINTS: 59 -Hard to call, but it is 50 disks, and leaks memory bad...

I normally don't review betas, but I do play most of em that get released,
just to kinda see what's up ya know.. This little 2 disker is pretty fucken
cool :) This is a netgame, and although you can play this by yourself, it
sucks, cuz you're all alone. Fans of subspace will probably like this. It's
not really anything like subspace itself, but it's free and was actually kind
of fun to play by myself. Check out www.grokksoft.com for the latest updates
of this Inetgame. BTW, I couldn't find any kind of joystick setting, so it
looks to be keyboard only :( Leave enuff bitch mail to the author at that url
and tell him "THE WAREZ COMMUNITY WANTS JOYSTICK SUPPORT, YA LAMUR!!"
Enuff said.

POINTS: Nada.. Zilch.. Empty handed. Nothing. Beta & Free

Pretty cool game.. Too bad there was only like 3 tracks. Other than that
really nothing to bitch about. The car seemed a little hard to control, but I
think it was designed that way. Supposed to simulate high speed on dirt/gravel
or mud. The grafix were decent.. It's pretty much exactly like Network-Q rally
was, with the co-pilot telling you which way the next turn is and shit. So
this one really ain't nothing too special.. I couldn't find anymore than 3
tracks, so if anyone else does, lemme know how you got em. Really the only
thing that saved this release was that it was only 8 disks. So I gotta give it
a few points for that.

POINTS: 75 -Decent grafix, easy to play, easy to leech, and easy to beat :(

Release Date: 16 JAN 1997

Word of warning.. The .rar's blow up to quite a few megs.. Almost 200 to be
exact. It's cuz of the .bmp's the game uses. The cool news though, is that the
game supports 800x600@16bit. I enjoyed playing this for some dumb reason,
prolly because the grafix were really kick ass. Everything in the game was
3d rendered. Title screen, course views, and playing area.. Everything. Some
halfway decent music in here too.

The guts of the game is pretty simple. Put the ball in the hole. There's 3
different courses, each with 9 different holes and different hazards for each
green. I did run into one small bug though, the ball went into a part of the
screen it wasn't supposed to. Good thing there's a shot limit (defaults to 6)
or else I woulda been stuck there. It just skipped to the next hole after 6
shots. I dunno, I can't really give it a great score, cuz I played all the
holes in about 20 minutes, but the grafix were great.

Says it'll do 4 player network, but I didnt test it.

POINTS: 67 -Good grafix, but 40 disks and only 20 mins of play time.

===============================
From time to time, we here at TGR will bring you reviews like this of releases
that simply couldn't make it in the scene.  Here's an outside review:

It has been long since i have played an RPG Game. The last game remotely
related to role playing that I have enjoyed, was Lands of Lore 1 from West-
wood, which I loved because it was relatively easy to understand, and was alot
of fun, even on my 386sx at the time.  2 weeks ago, I got my copy of Diablo,
and will not be afraid to admit that it is now one of my most favorite 5 games
of all time (Civilization, Dune2, Quake, and Warcraft 2).  The game can be
played in single player mode, as well as multiplayer.  You play via a charac-
ter you pick in the beginning.  Your choices are a warrior, a rouge, and a
sorcerer.  Your character starts the game at level 1, with relatively low
attributes for strength and magic.  As you proceed your way down the labyrint
of Diablo, you kill enemies in all forms (Skeletons, animals, winged creat-
ures, girls with big tits that you can zoom into on ('z' key) once you kill
them and see nipples that would make Pamela Anderson jealous :P.  All sorts
of demons, sorcerers, zombies, butchers, and other creatures found in your
typical every day hell atmosphere.  As you go on killing them, you receive
experience points, which lead you to higher levels.  Every level you go up in,
you can raise your attributes in strength, magic, dextermity, and so on.  The
more you kill, the cooler weapons you obviously get.  For example you start
playing with the warrior with a wood stick with a spike in it, which is
perfectly fine for killing skeletons in level 1, but later you find all types
of swords, bows, daggers that have the ability to destruct 30x more.  There
are many other items affecting your game, like what kinds of rings you wear
(Rings can make you stronger, magic higher, kill enemies faster, have more
armor), what kind of armor you carry on your body (You start with a peasant
suit, and by the time you are at hell levels, you will have plates that are
nearly impossible to penetrate).  Also of course you have a shield, which can
be as good as a regular buckler and go up to a plutonium covered kings shield
which does not let anyone even hurt you.  Most of the best items are rather
hard to find, but considering other people have found them already, some of
them might be quite willing to sell theirs, or to trade it for something else.
You get my point, you are interacting with every other owner of Diablo, you
can play with them, against them, or be totaly unrelated to them but still
being in the same game. The sounds in this game are VERY related to the theme,
the enemies make JUST the right noises all the time, and the background music
fits every level perfectly.  Ok, I could write more about certain strategies,
and how to cheat, but its all been discovered already and is located on the
plethora of Diablo WWW pages that are on the net.

This is simply a game so unbelievable, and has so little flaws, that even
though i rated uhmm 2 games so far (Gender Wars, and Muzzle Velocity) I will
simply give this a 98% because it deserves it.  The net play is smooth on 28.8
(not many games have that to say for themselves) and just the SIZE and the
amount of options and stuff to find in this game, is so enormous, that the
replay value is 100%.  That is you can go on playing this forever even if you
kill Diablo himself more than once.

A bit about the rip: The stupid thing has no sounds, and no movies.  Who cares
about that. Buy the CD, or if you are so cheap, at least get it burnt for
$15-20 bucks since this game is like totally worth it.
                                RATING: 98/100

-In City of The Lost Children, I mistakenly believed that there were all of
the movies.  Only some of the movies are still intact.  Due to this error, 3
points are knocked off the score to give it a final rating of 68/100.  It
still was GOTW.
