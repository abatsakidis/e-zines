News Updates  (Sometimes the news can be funny...ok well maybe never,  
============  (but it is now, ok?  
-Some of you have been wondering how do I manage to get all the games releas-  
ed each week and have time to play them and review them.  Well, it's simple!  
I own this magic wand called the "Game-o-rizer".  What it does, is it magic-  
ally downloads shit at 100MB/S and then it automatically follows the direct-  
ions in the .nfos and installs them, plays them, and then writes about it.  
See I don't actually do anything, it's all my Game-o-rizer magic wand.  And  
now for a limited time only, you too can purchase a Game-o-rizer magic wand  
for the low price of only $1,999.  A steal at this low price, it comes in the  
following colors: Green, Red, Blue, White Cum, and Yellow Vaginal Yeast  
infection.  To order, send chicks or babes to "Game-o-rizer", 11 Bullshit Dr.,  
Smokey-Air, Los Angeles, California, 90210.  Shipping and handling only $50.  
Please allow 2-4 centuries for delivery, as it will be shipped through UPS.  
  
-AND NOW from the home office in So-Sue-Me City, Iowa, it's time for Ionizer's  
Top Five List.  (I couldn't afford all 10 so I got the half price deal)

                 (0-19)/100 = In a nutshell, it sucked!  
                (20-39)/100 = Still crap but slightly better.  
                (40-49)/100 = Possibly worth downloading.  
                (50-69)/100 = Pretty decent game. Might want to check it out.  
                (70-79)/100 = Worth the download if you like that type.  
                (80-89)/100 = Very good, 9 outta 10 its worth the download.  
                (90-99)/100 = Excellent game, a MUST download.  
                    100/100 = HOLY SHIT I'VE NEVER SEEN A BETTER GAME!  
  
RATINGS are based on the game idea, graphics, sound, playability, ingenuity,  
versatility, and a lot of other words ending in `ity'.  These games are based  
on what happens on MY COMPUTER ONLY, unless stated otherwise.  I always first  
follow nfo directions, and if those don't work or are not available, I then  
try other ways.  So just b/c it doesn't work for me, doesn't mean it won't  
work for you.

A New Duke3D Dukematch Level     
================================  
This is a deathmatch only level.  
Small to medium in size. 7 megs.  
================================  
Just a bunch of .map files to addon to DN3D.  Nothing special, a nice collec-  
tion to have for games against other people.  Some are really shitty, some  
are really good.  That's about it.

This is a lameass collection of hacking, phreaking and virii shit.  It's  
basically 180 megs of .txt shit.  You must have a lot of free time, be an  
extremely bored person, or extremely desperate for hardware type person if  
you actually read all this.  It's all crap from ages ago, so half the info.  
is most likely outdated, "There is a new high-tech thing out, called a cell-  
ular phone and you can steal the codes!".  Ya know, shit like that ;)  Don't  
waste your time.  It's barely even helpful to newbie hackers.

used it, would not make it run.

Knowing the leader of this group, I thought that this might be a bunch of  
gay games with naked guys, especially since it was "Victor".  But, I soon  
found out it was more like Virtual Vallery, but you see the robot like guy,  
Victor, fucking some chick.  You can blow her, fuck her from behind, on top,  
or be on the bottom.  It's practically just like Vallery, you need to gain  
stamina, by talking to her, fucking her, etc, and then you can goo all over  
her.  Graphics pretty good, sound, uhh well it's a lot of "uhhh ohh ahh" etc.

Wow, what is this "Doom" thing...it's really revolutionary, I've never seen  
anything like it, pff.  What is this really?  It's really just doom with some  
new .wads (levels).  They are pretty good wads, but the game engine and des-  
ign is still the same.  Same monsters, same weapons, same shit.  It seriously  
just isn't fun anymore.  Unless ya get a kick out of beating any new level  
that comes out, you really don't need to waste your time.  Also, there is no  
".exe" or anything that will allow you to play in dos, you have to go into  
the subdirectories plutonia and tnt and install those seperately, which is  
the same thing as the two releases by Mantis.  So if you're just using dos,  
you're better off getting the Mantis releases.  Oh, and both releases (RZR &  
PSG) are the same exact thing, so I don't give a shit which one you get.

Yaaaawnnn... oh excuse me.  Yes, still more doom.  It's just a bunch of new  
levels once again.  Nothing you couldn't just d/l off some lame ass SW board  
and get a million .wads, why pay 50 bucks for it?  Again, nothing new engine  
wise, and you really shouldn't bother to get it unless your a doom freak.  
                RATING: 50/100 (More newer levels than Final Doom)

Ok now I'm sleeping.  Not only am I playing the same game, but I'm playing  
the same levels.  However for you dos users, I suggest you just get these two  
for final doom, because this contains all you need and nothing more.  For  
more details about it (not like I need to describe Doom to you) check out the  
articles on RZR & PSG's Final Doom.

CYBERJUDAS (c) MERIT STUDIOS [XX/58]  CYBERJUDAS: MOVIES & MISC ADDONS [XX/26]  
A huge war game, and when I say huge, I mean 220+ megs with the addon.  Once  
again Napalm ignores the disk limit, it seems like everyone's doing it, so  
what the fuck.  This is a detailed war game.  War, as in future war types,  
between nations.  It has a nice collection of maps of the world :) .  Tons of  
shit to do in this one, but it's not really worth it, unless you like war  
games and plan to burn this one to cd.  It's a good quality game though.  
                                RATING: 61/100  
  
Ok, OK!  I know this was released late, but listen to me, I HAVE BEEN DOWN-  
LOADING 24 HOURS A DAY SINCE 0627 when groups started dumping games every half  
hour and there was a total of 1/2 a gig released in 2 days!  Because of this,  
and the always favorite aborted downloads, I was unable to review a few games  
and still get this out on time.  Once again, sorry, but they will of course  
be in next week's issue.  (I know this ironic considering the first thing  
in the news article, but just shutup and go along with it.)

-That's it for this week, hope it was of help.  
-I'd like to thank the hundreds of you who wrote in about the fact that you  
agreed with my review of QUAKE.  <Not one single e-mail complaint about it>.  
-The group Rise 2 Power explained the reason for their non-working release                                                   
of Grand Prix 2, in one of their other releases.  Here it is (Thanx Nohand)  
   "DDMM[ Group Notes ]MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMDD  
    3                                                                   3  
    :    All groups make mistakes, and we made a big one by jumping the :  
    :    gun on releasing GP2.  This release was an alpha, so we really :  
    :    couldn't have fixed it.  Ohh yeah, and all you fargin lamers   :  
    :    that pop in and out of our channel, fuck you.  You wouldn't    :  
    :    have given 1/2 a shit if a well known group such as Prestige   :  
    :    made a mistake like this.  Just because R2P is a new group,    :  
    :    doesn't mean we're going to crumble from your idiotic pleas.   :  
    :    R2P is here to stay.  R2P does all this for pure fun, the      :  
    :    scene is not a full time job for us.  We are no longer going   :  
    :    to listen your pathetic crying.  Go sit in a corner.           :  
    :                                                                   :  
    :             ------>      Shit Happens!      <------               :"  
-First off, I agree with most of what they said, but it is TOTALLY not true  
that "people wouldn't give a shit if a more well known group made a mistake".  
People get on anyone's ass if they want to, they don't care who it is.  
-REMINDER: Win95 reviews still wanted and accepted!
