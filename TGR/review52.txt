-Rating scale:
                 (0-19)/100 = In a nutshell, it sucked!
                (20-39)/100 = Still crap but slightly better.
                (40-49)/100 = Possibly worth downloading.
                (50-69)/100 = Pretty decent game. Might want to check it out.
                (70-79)/100 = Worth the download if you like that type.
                (80-89)/100 = Very good, 9 outta 10 its worth the download.
                (90-99)/100 = Excellent game, a MUST download.
                    100/100 = HOLY SHIT I'VE NEVER SEEN A BETTER GAME!

RATINGS are based on the game idea, graphics, sound, playability, ingenuity,
versatility, and a lot of other words ending in `ity'.  These games are based
on what happens on MY COMPUTER ONLY, unless stated otherwise.  I always first
follow .nfo directions, and if those don't work or are not available, I then
try other ways.  So just b/c it doesn't work for me, doesn't mean it won't
work for you.

Great sim game.  It's got comedy, nice tutorial, good graphics, music.  We've
all played at least one sim game in our life.  This one is, obviously (der),
based upon you building your own hospital and managing it.  It's fairly easy
to do, and easy to control.  Patients come in with all different problems and
the you just set up the hospital so that they can be cured.  A must get for
anyone who likes sim games, and even if you don't love them, it is worth
checking out.  Good game, well put together, and it even has some animations.

those really hard words, "Requirements: Win95", they will not get reviewed. 
Next time, take the 3 seconds to say so.

Not too shabby of a space shoot'em up.  You fly around in space shooting at
shit.  Pretty good graphics, nice interface.  Ummm, not that much fun, but
then again, it's a bunch of white dots on black background with 3 or 4 moving
ships to shoot at (otherwise known as a space shoot'em up).  You'll need at
least a p/100 to run it smoothly, or else it fires slowly and does just about
everything else slowly.  There's different missions you can have, or you can
just go around shooting and exploring.  The explosions in this game are pretty
realistic looking or at least they look pretty good.

A very bland sidescrolling shoot'em up game.  You collect weapons and const-
antly upgrade your ship.  Graphics are very mediocre and the sound is below
average.  The story plot is about as thin as the walls at a cheap motel where
you can hear the people next to you fucking.  The game has little parts where
you can upgrade your weapons (by collecting money in the game) during the
actual levels.  You have your standard fire weapon, which you always hold down
b/c it's unlimited and b/c it's stupid not to, which is also upgraded during
the level if you catch certain bonuses.  Your other weapon can be changed from
all different types of missles and other goodies.  It has the standard boss at
the end of the level, which is usually not too hard to kill.  Pretty basic,
pretty simple, and pretty fucking boring.

You know, I wrote this fucking review, and then I deleted it by accident,
goddamn it.  Anyway, if you take the overhead feel of Gauntlet, mix it with
the level complexity of the typical 3D Doom style game, and add 2 tablespoons
of Diablo, you'll get a delicious tasting cake.  No, seriously, this game is
a little bit of all those.  It's not really that great, but it's pretty good.
In VGA mode it sucks dick, but in SVGA it looks a lot better.  All pentiums
should be able to handle SVGA.  Your this dude with a mohawk and you blow up
shit as you walk around.  Everything seems to blow up except for the walls.
Shift fires your standard fire, q and w switch weapons, and space bar puts
down a land mine (be sure to get the hell outta the way or it will blow up on
you), and there is a grenade, but I couldn't figure out how to set it off.

Pretty fucking boring space game.  Very sim-ish, meaning you build colonies
and stuff on different planets.  No music, makes you sleepy, and not exactly
easy to figure out.  Don't bother unless you love sim-space games.  Graphics
are pretty good, but it's not of much.

This game is similar to Project Paradise in the look.  The graphics work
almost the same, but it's VGA and you can switch b/t 640X and 320X.  In this
one, it seems less inteligent as all you seem to do is constantly fire at
natives and blow them to pieces w/ their guts all over the floor.  It was
one of the most mindless games I've ever seen, and it got boring quick as
hell.  You only have a gun and a `devastator' type weapon.  The scenery was
boring, the enemies were boring, and the game made me go to sleep.  You might
need to loaded univbesa to get this to work.  I can't believe someone put out
a sound and music addon for this game.  The animations were pretty good, from
the few I did see.  The music was ok, upbeat, but nothing great.

The only difference I could see in this is that you can play it in a window.
Big deal, games in a window suck. This also has the id W95 frontend, letting
you do all the networking, .wad select, level and map select, and deathmatch
options. Some people say this was faster than the original, but the original
flew on my diamond stealth 64 too, so I dunno. BTW, you don't have to run
setup in order for this to work, just run the .exe... (getting sorta redundant
ain't it?)

** Points: 76 -Updated version of the original - nothing more.

This is a nice game. PC Magazine ran a review section in thier last issue on 4
different flight sims.. Half expecting to find this one there, I looked and
saw some old shit about A-10 Cuba, USNF, and JetFighter 3.. Decent games, but
come on people, this is April 97 we're talkin here. Another reason TGR beats
the hell outta the shit you pay for. Nuff of the rant.. How bout the game?
Simply amazing. First off, it's fully rendered images. No bitmap shit. On top
of that, it's NICE rendering. The sound effects were great too. I bailed out
one time, and actually heard the bad guys trying to shoot my ass in my chute.
There's about a thousand different camera angles, and a thousand different
controls (which BTW, PDM included keys.txt after you unrar, thanks guys).
Simple flight isn't too hard. Hit the throttle, take off, G for gear, F for
flaps, [ and ] to select weapon, and <enter> to fire. All the other stuff is a
nightmare though. Well, it's not *that* bad, but bad enough. Call me stupid,
but I couldn't find anywhere to let me use any buttons. There was a regular
josytick box to check, and a programmable joystick box. Tried both and neither
would let my buttons do anything. I've got a 4 axis, 8 button stick, with
hat, and the only thing that would work was X/Y/throttle/rudder.. Ah well.
640, 800, and 1024 res is supported, a couple of different detail settings,
and that's about it as far as settings go. As with most flightsims though,
you'll probably need the dox to get full enjoyment, theres a few things on the
hud that make absolutely no sense. Oh yeah, I only saw one other area of the
world besides the training and multiplayer areas. That was Iraq. Dunno if it
was ripped, or you have to complete all 8 of the iraq missions or what. Hell,
for 7 disks though, this is a definate leech.

** POINTS: 84 -Great detail, so-so controls, 7 disks. Check it out...

Blah.. What a waste of good leech time. 50 disks for something that looks like
it should be out on about 10. This is basically your average side scroller
beat em up. There's 3 ugly dudes that you can switch between that all pretty
much do the same thing, but with different weapons. Cartoonish, crap. If this
was released on like 5-10 disks, I'd give it 80 prolly, but on 50... Next
time: RIP IT I mean there actually was a very ugly avi whos main purpose
between levels was to say, "Uh duuuh.. We gotta go over here.." Crap, with
an extra order of crap, supersized, is still crap.

** POINTS: 27 -No one should grab this unless they got a T1 or ether running
           to thier house. (Or a mental problem)

Well, 47 disks for a flight sim, you'd think it'd be good right? Errrrggg!
Wrong answer there. First off, the graphics look like Terminal Velocity in
extremely low res, there's no speech, way too many keys to have to learn, no
dox, and just way too much shit ripped. This was just a very troublesome
gaming experience for me. On that note, lemme tell you a story of a dude that
used to play Gunship by microprose on his commie 64.. He played it alot. He
got the Congressional Medal of Honor. He played Longbow Gold for a half hour
until he said fuck it, and loaded up C64s and had a blast from the past.

** POINTS: 36 -Grafix looked like shit, and you definately need a ref card.

Outlaws.. Doom in the wild west. Pretty simple. Not too bad of a game, I'm
still waiting on redneck rampage though. This one was kind of slow and choppy
sometimes. There's a lot of different weapons I would guess, there's slots for
9 plus your fists. I only got 2 of em though.. Regular 6 shooter, and a rifle.
Ohhh.. This one also has a built in trainer :) Just go to other-options in the
options menu and click on invincibilty. One thing though, I had it turned on
cuz I wanted to get to the 2nd level pretty quick and I went into this room
and like instantly died.. Not sure, maybe it does that in the final room
because of invincibilty mode. Dunno. Anyway, decent game, but still, just a
slightly different variation on the doom theme. This one does let you jump,
light a lamp, and do some other stuff. Grafix was ok, and the sound samples
were somewhat redundant, but all in all, not too bad. 42 disks is kinda scary
just for a doom clone.

** POINTS: 68 -Not bad, but not real good, wait for Redneck Rampage :)

A casino game.. Whee. Been a long time since I reviewed one of them. Even
though I happen to be an avid casino goer, this one has absolutely nothing new
in it. So, BFD who cares? It's got blackjack, craps, roulette, keno, vid
poker, and slots. The blackjac game wasn't too bad, you could tell it wasn't
actually random though. Blah... who really cares? Not me so....

** POINTS: 42 -Ok, if you don't already have any casino games.

Release Date: 04 APR 1997

Well, I know this is supposed to be a decent game, and I looked forward to
playing it and all, but it falls real short. The game is super choppy even on
my p90/32M/4M vid.. On top of that, there's lines and shit in the track like
the bitmaps don't line up.. Like when you can see through corners in doom.
Dunno what's up with this, but it's fucked. It looks like you're doing about
35 on grandpa's moped. Instead of 220 mph in the top of the line auto's of
tommorrow. I know I prolly shouldn't say this, but I don't think this is a
final version. If it is, EA deserves to go bankrupt. AND I've never seen EA
release a game this fucked up ever, and I've been playin EA since the little
EOA speedload on the commie 64. So if it is actually final, I dunno what to
say, if it's not I'll say I told you so. There's just too many bugs, the
bitmaps don't line up right, the little dots representing the cars showing you
where you're at don't appear to be on the track, but an inch or so away,
definately not what I would expect to see as a sequel from such a kick ass
game. It don't even save your joystick mappings or anything. Everytime you
play you gotta redo your joystick config. I don't recommend leeching this, I
wish it wasn't true, but I think this one sucks.
Editor's note: The `buggyness' is due to the ripping, according to a member
               in Reflux.  They said it was taken straight from a shrinkwrap.

** POINTS: 66 -Too buggy, too slow, and I don't think this is final.
