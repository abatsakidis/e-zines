Basically this is Mechwarrior 2, but with a lot of pumped up features and new
missions.  Razor.nfo says you'll need a pentium for this one, but it seemed
to run smoothly for me <486/33, shutup stop laughing>.  If you have no clue
what mechwarrior is, well then here's the previous review: heh, look at that,
I can't find it!  Oh well, anyway, mechwarrior is a game where you sit in the
cockpit of a giant robot and you go around colored terrain and shoot at other
huge robots and types of machines.  You have all different missions to comp-
lete.  The graphics are very good, especially if you can support all the
shading, shadows, and shit (known as the three s's).  The game supports net
play, but the chance you find someone with this game, a pentium/100+, and
willing to play it at the time you want to is about as slim as someone making
a pacman svga version.  Anyway, it's a good game, only 87 megs installed, and
I do mean ONLY :).

NETWORK Q RAC RALLY CHAMPIONSHIP     [xx/41]
+------------------------------------------+
-Filenames: PSGRAL??.ZIP
Now here's what a GOOD racing game is like.  This one has all of the cd,
nothing ripped.  It's got the cool animations, the sound commentary <tells
you which way to turn and how hard> and the sfx.  You can put this in a va-
riety of graphic modes and different options.  However you'll need a p/75 to
enjoy this one at full effect.  This one has all the options, edit your racer,
his car, and anything else you want, cept the tracks.  It woulda been nice if
they let you go off the tracks, but they keep you enclosed in them.  Good, but
limited sound effects.  And with network play, you can't ask for much more.
If you're looking for a good multiplayer racing game, and got at least a p/75
defintately try this one out.

Well it sounds lame, and gee wilpers, it is.  You have to raise chickens and
then raise them to win in races and try to gain lotsa money.  It's for windows
and most of it is button clicking.  The racing is lame, and at times frustrat-
ing.  Don't bother unless your completely bored, which is impossible this
week.

Ok, I have no idea how to play this fucking game.  It's some 3D type of view
over these triangles and you rotate them and shift them and make them fit
right or something.  The graphics aren't that great, but the sound and menus
are good sounding and looking.  Pretty basic, not too complex, but understand-
ing how to play the game might be.

Well here, finally, is the final that should put to rest any more finals to
come out of this game.  It's got all the levels and it works and the graphics
aren't all fucked up.  Basically it's a platform shoot'em'up in the water.
You use a ship that is able to send out a diver to shoot, and the ship can
pick up shit and let go of it elsewhere and of course shoot.  The game is
kinda hard since your ship is so big and the pathways pretty small.  You can
easily bump into shit such as landmines....or would we call them watermines.
It'll be a toughy to get past the first level on this sucker, takes lots of
patience and time.  The graphics are excellent, no music, and avg sfx.  Have
a nice day, please drive through.

Huhuh, black screens rule, especially when it sits there, and listens to all
your bitching and moaning.  Sometimes I talk with it about my problems and
stuff, and it gives me advice.  It told me to tell you that this game is for
win95/dos, but when this version was run from dos, our friend black screen
would appear and he didn't do anything.

WOW!  What an amazing RPG.  This is just a fucking great rpg.  It's got the
3rd person feel, but it's more got more freedom, like not just left, right,
forward and back, it's got nice 360 action.  The graphics are excellent and
the movement is smooth.  We all know what rpg's are, and to say a lot about
this game would almost insult it.  It is truly the top rpg out there, and
even though it installs to 433 megs, if you like rpgs, it is worth it.  You
basically form your character by answering some questions, and then you're
off into the cavelike passages.  Battle with little annoying animals to big
monsters.  The only bad things is the controls are slightly annoying, but you
will overcome that if you like it.

Another outer space like game.  You travel from planet to planet and talk to
people and avoid enemies.  The game for the most part is just managing your
weapons and people correctly.  There is a little bit of fighting, which is
pretty lame and reminds me of an old "flash" game for major bbs.  All that
part is, is you fly around in your ship and shoot at the enemy, but it's all
from a step away perspective and you see your ship flying around, not you in
it.  The game could be really cool if you had all the cd, but the rip is not
worth bothering for, even though it is pretty good.  But if you don't like
managing/simcity like games, then you won't like it at all.  The trainer will
allow you to cheat by editing fuel, resource untis, landing pods, ship crew,
and weapon charge.  A manual in that .pdf format was also released.

We just saw the demo, here's the final.  This is an excellently put together
football game.  However in order to play it with all the great graphics and
sound, not only will you need to download 50 disks + 35 for the speech addon,
but you'll need a p/100.  If you don't have a p/100, you'll end up having to
reduce the screen size, and take away shadows and the crowd and stadium gfx.
Then it looks kind of boring.  The game play is great, very realistic, and
allows you a good deal of freedom to move around.  Three different camera
angles, blimp, sideline, and goaline views.  If you like football, think your
computer is good enough, and willing to get at least the 50 disks, then by
all means get it, because it is very good.

Yet another great game this week.  This one is a Crusader: No Remorse like
game, where you blow up everything, but it's more single mission like, and it
takes place outside.  It's got lots of cool things to do, and you can get tons
of different weapons.  The only set back is that you control with the mouse
and it's not as good as controlling it with k/b, and your robot kinda just
flows around, it's not a man who can jump or anything.  Also, the view is a
little too far back, it would be better if it was closer up, and had a little
more graphic detail, cuz the way it is now, it's similar to sim city type of
view.  But it's got lots of cool videos, and all the sound and shit are there.

Although a simple sim game, this one has pretty good graphics, great music,
and the usual sfx.  The game is pretty well balanced, not overpowering with
too much specifics, but yet it's still got a good amount of technical stuff.
You fly your plane and complete missions.  You are armed with weapons, so yes,
you can shoot someone.  The hardest part is just figuring out how to get your
plane up and moving and controlling it, but hit "k" for the key list in the
game.  Not bad for it's size, but it's not superior.  It will lag on anything
less than a 486/100

Around this time, if you haven't heard already, my former secondary `trusty'
Western Digital 1.2 Gig harddrive decided it would feel cool if it burnt a
few of it's brain cells <aka bad sectors>.  As a result of this, my hard drive
is extremely fucked up, I lost 4.5 years collection of quality pr0n pics and
animations, classic games, and other things not as a vital <G>.  As it would
just so happen, the sector where I had 300 megs worth of games to be tested
fucked up also, and I had to delete those games and there was no way in hell
I was going to redownload them.  Because they were on bad sectors, I couldn't
even unzip them to another directory or find out the name of the games.  So
listed here are the filenames of games that were not reviewed because of this.

How interesting.. A fix for this was released that included the 2 missing
.dlls but guess what? It's still fucked. Wanna know something else? It's
either uncracked, or cracked wrong. Here's why: I loaded it up after I copied
the fix shit like I was sposed to, and got to the part where it shows the
little world or whatever and it crashed. After the crash, I left all the
error crap on the screen, went to dos, and typed "ps" (all you unix users
know what this does). The unix "ps" command tells every process running..
Anyway, ps gave me the usual crap, dde & rpc stuff, but also a process called
"CD Verification" IE: CRAP - NON WORKING - BROKED

*> Points: NA/100 (I'm starting to think I should start giving out negative
                  points, for making me download non-working shit.)

Well, at least all but 1 of the included games work. Too bad all but 2 of
these mini games have been released already. I hadn't seen air guitar or the
drive-thru games before.. I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this,
basically if you like Beavis and Butthead, never played the others when they
came out, grab this. After all, it's only 6 disks. But if you've played the
others, the 2 new ones won't keep you occupied for more than 10 minutes
anyway.

*> Points: 27 - All but 2 are dupes, 1 mini-game don't work

Wow.. Finally something cool this week! I remember playing the PSX version of
this game and thinking, "heh.. too bad ya couldn't get away with this in real
life!" Being a motorcyclist myself, I pretty much fucking dig this one. It's
a motorcycle racing type game with the ability to beat the shit out of your
opponents while doing about 150 MPH through heavy traffic. heh heh Sound like
fun? You betchya! Oh, did I mention that you can whack cops off thier bikes
too? Imagine the look of horror on Ponch's face as you ride up next to him
brandishing your 4 foot chain... <path0s wakes from his state of euphoria>
Ahem.. Yeah. Your main goal is to get 3rd place or better for each track in
your level, earning money as you go, so you can work your way up to the
"Super Bikes" (bikes that manuever really good and have NITRO!). Once you've
qualified on each track, you go up a level and the tracks become longer and
more densely populated with vehicles/hazards. I got up to level 4.. (Level 3
The City = A BITCH!!) Level 4 just plain SUCKS. You can only crash so much
before you trash your bike out, and if you crash when there's a cop around,
you'll get busted and have to pay a fine. The first few times you crash, I
bet you'll laugh you ass off, cuz it seems like you fly through the air for
miles. On a technical note, the grafix on this one were damn good for as fast
as stuffs drawn to the screen, and it really looks like you're doing 150 MPH
or better.
A couple quick tips: #1 Save after every successful race #2 You start each
race with a pipe, but it can be taken away from you by someone who dont have
a weapon. If you get the pipe taken, find someone who has a chain, and keep
hitting the use weapon button, you can take the chain away from the other
dude. About 3 whacks with a chain and they'll go flying.

*> Points: 80 - Kept me busy for hours.. It should you too.

FileNames: NHL97-??.ZIP
Release Date: 26 SEP 1996

Ionizer had me review this cuz he was getting excessive page faults, but more
on that later.. This is a so-so kind of a game here, prolly the best grafix
I've seen for a hockey game yet, but it's got a few problems. The biggest
problem I found was that the actual RULES of the game are wrong. I know what
you're thinking, "BULLSHIT!! How could a game authorized by the NHL Players
Association be WRONG??" Well, trust me, the rules on icing and offsides are
wrong. This game tells me I'm offsides when I dump the puck in the opposing
teams zone, hit the goalie with the puck, and none of my players are in the
zone. It's plain wrong. In real hockey, it's called a "dump in". You can fire
the puck all the way from your goal, hit the other goalie, and it's playable.
Now on to a few more complaints about this one.. The goalie *NEVER* leaves
the pocket. In real hockey, the goalie does much more than just stop pucks.
Another big gripe is that the cpu controlled players have no brain. They
don't reach for the puck too often. I actually seen the puck at a dead stop
and no one would touch it until I moved my guy over to get it. Not anyone
from my team or the other one would skate over to grab it.. Pretty lame ehh?
Something else that I couldn't ever figure out was how come the computer
could pull thier goalie to have 6 skaters, but I couldn't.. I looked
everywhere. The line editor had an option to display goalies, but all I could
do was switch between the backup goalie and the starter. A few other
complaints: Only 2 buttons supported, couldn't change the camera angles, the
game would lose your joystick config, some others I dont remember. Now about
those invalid page faults.. I played this in real dos mode, and in win95. In
Win95 it seemed to crash less often than dos mode. Didn't matter where in the
game, it'd crash, and I couldn't ever repeat something to make it crash. So I
dunno what the problem is. Sometimes I could play for hours and it wouldn't
die on me, other times it'd crap after 5 mins.. I guess what this whole
review is trying to tell you is NOT to leech this if you are a hockey fan,
cuz you will be seriously disappointed. Once you get past all the hocus pocus
grafix, it's really a shit game.

Quick tip: If you've got the "fast game" option turned off, you can abort the
intermission (like after you ice the puck, or a penalty, etc..) by hitting
both the A+B buttons at the same time.

Not trying to imply anything here, well, ok, maybe I am.. There's also the
possibilty of this not being the final release version. I just can't imagine
they'd let a game like this out with the actual RULES being wrong.

I was going to get the addon pack for this at Ion's request, but I decided I
didn't want another 40+ disks to leech for a game I really didn't like in the
first place. Oh yeah, if you play this under Win95, it tells you to install
the W95 version of this game, but you can continue and play it anyway. So..
Next question RZR: Where IS the W95 version!! Preferably not another 50 disk
release, but maybe an addon or something cuz it prolly uses alot of the same
files. <HINT! HINT!>  :)

*> Points: 40 -Gonna catch shit no matter which way I go, woulda been lower
               if the grafix weren't so cool.

_____________________             ___________           ____________________

Final Notes: Ever try to leech about a 1000 disks over 288? Well, don't 
unless you've got a dedicated line and about 80 free hours on your hands. 
Anyway, I would personally like to congratulate all the games groups that 
released over the past couple weeks. I wish I had time to count out exactly 
how many disks I downloaded needlessly because of shit not working, or 
fucking retarded ass intro.mov files. At any rate, it's really no wonder why 
people call the scene "dead" and "completely FUCKED". What good is a 20 
release week, if only 5 of em work and ripped right? I would've been able to 
review all the WORKING releases if I didn't have to get all the non-working 
shit too. So, I guess you can thank the groups that released broked shit for 
the lack of reviewing everything.

And after making that last comment, me and Ion has pretty much decided to 
temporarily stop TGR until the New Year rolls around. He's got ALOT of REAL 
non-scene related stuff to do, and I'm getting quite burned out, and really 
fucking frustrated with the whole gaming scene. Basically, I can't handle the 
amount of PURE FUCKING GARBAGE I've been seeing lately, plus I've got my own 
fair share of shit to do in #real_life.

-To all the people who have sent me mail, and talked with me on IRC: Thanks 
for really keeping me motivated at times. 
-To everyone else who are my friends, namely #W5, and everyone from #k0k, 
you guys RULE!
-To the people who try to keep the scene respectable, take pride in thier 
work, and REALLY make the scene happen: You people are the ones that TGR has 
always been for, and will continue to be for.
-To all the rest: Fuck off.

See ya in the New Year! And that's a PROMISE.

-These two weeks were filled with tons of quality games, mainly because groups
have decided to just utilize the max disk limit rather than ripping smaller.
This of course has it's good and it's bad, it means you might enjoy one of
7 games a lot more, but it also means that you're going to download an extra
20 disks for 6 other shittier games.  Anyway, it would be impossible to award
only one GOTW(s) because of the amount of games put out and because so many
were good.  Also, a lot of games were not able to be reviewed, so this week
I will just list the games all worthy of it:
DAGGERFALL, MADDEN '97, ROADRASH, and NHL '97 <if you love hockey games>.

"TactCom for EF2000!! This is a GREAT release from  ROMLiGHT!          
 Launched in November 1995, Digital Image Design's EF2000 has become        
 renowned as one of the finest modern air-combat flight simulations for the 
 PC. The company is proud to announce the imminent release of EF2000        
 TACTCOM - an upgrade disk for EF20000 which offers a comprehensive         
 Tactical Mission Planner, new communications options, new views and the    
 definitive EF2000 Patch. Due for a summer release, TACTCOM for EF2000 will 
 be available at a mid-range price.                                         
 The Tactical Mission Planner allows players to plot their own sorties      
 within a campaign. A simple point-and-click system is used to set          
 waypoints, targets and altitudes. In addition, players can call-up tactical
 information to help plan the safest routes to and from the target position.
 The system also delivers highly detailed battle statistics following       
 campaign sessions. TACTCOM will maintain a record of the individuals       
 progress during a campaign and display and overall picture of how the      
 TACTCOM offers EF2000 players a variety of communications options.         
 Computers can now be linked over and IPX network, serial link or modem.

<This section has been posted in several areas to ensure that readers read it>
OK IM GOING TO WRITE THIS IN ALL CAPS SO THAT I DON'T HAVE PEOPLE ASKING ME
WHERE THE NEXT ISSUE IS, FOR 3 MONTHS.
THIS IS THE ***LAST*** ***TGR*** ***UNTIL*** SOMETIME IN ***JANUARY***.
REASONS WHY: (1) AS I SAID BEFORE, I HAVE 7 COLLEGE APPS TO FILL OUT, AND
                 ADDED TO SCHOOL WORK, LEAVES LITTLE FREE TIME.
             (2) I GOT A LOT OF OTHER SHIT I HAVE TO DO FOR SCHOOL.
             (3) MY 1.2 GIG DRIVE <THE ONE I D/L AND PLAY THE GAMES ON>
                 HELPED "ICE THE CAKE" ON MY DECISION WHEN IT DECIDED TO
                 HAVE A BUNCH OF BAD SECTORS AND START FUCKING UP ON ME.
                 THEREFORE I ONLY HAVE 90 MEGS ON MY OTHER DRIVE TO WORK
                 WITH, WHICH IS OF COURSE NOT ENOUGH.
PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT TGR IS *NOT* DEAD, AND I **PROMISE** IT WILL BE BACK!
I HEREBY *DO NOT* AUTHORIZE ANYONE TO TAKE IT UPON THEMSELVES TO `TAKEOVER'
THE CONTROL OF TGR.     -Ionizer [THE GAME REVIEWer]   (Sorry for the caps)

-That's it for this week, hope it was of help.
<This section has been posted in several areas to ensure that readers read it>
OK IM GOING TO WRITE THIS IN ALL CAPS SO THAT I DON'T HAVE PEOPLE ASKING ME
WHERE THE NEXT ISSUE IS, FOR 3 MONTHS.
THIS IS THE ***LAST*** ***TGR*** ***UNTIL*** SOMETIME IN ***JANUARY***.
REASONS WHY: (1) AS I SAID BEFORE, I HAVE 7 COLLEGE APPS TO FILL OUT, AND
                 ADDED TO SCHOOL WORK, LEAVES LITTLE FREE TIME.
             (2) I GOT A LOT OF OTHER SHIT I HAVE TO DO FOR SCHOOL.
             (3) MY 1.2 GIG DRIVE <THE ONE I D/L AND PLAY THE GAMES ON>
                 HELPED "ICE THE CAKE" ON MY DECISION WHEN IT DECIDED TO
                 HAVE A BUNCH OF BAD SECTORS AND START FUCKING UP ON ME.
                 THEREFORE I ONLY HAVE 90 MEGS ON MY OTHER DRIVE TO WORK
                 WITH, WHICH IS OF COURSE NOT ENOUGH.
PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT TGR IS *NOT* DEAD, AND I **PROMISE** IT WILL BE BACK!
I HEREBY *DO NOT* AUTHORIZE ANYONE TO TAKE IT UPON THEMSELVES TO `TAKEOVER'
THE CONTROL OF TGR.     -Ionizer [THE GAME REVIEWer]   (Sorry for the caps)
