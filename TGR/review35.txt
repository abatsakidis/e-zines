on what happens on MY COMPUTER ONLY, unless stated otherwise.  I always first
follow nfo directions, and if those don't work or are not available, I then
try other ways.  So just b/c it doesn't work for me, doesn't mean it won't

The patch for this was supposed to let you install to any drive, but it didn't
seem to do that for me.  However I used it to get the game to actually work.
First off, you'll need at least a p/90 to play this game, or else it will be
too slow.  Also, don't think that is has crashed, or locked up, because it
does take a while for some stuff to load, and it may appear as though it's
not doing anything, just give it a little time.  Even the best gfx mode isn't
too hot, but if you are going to play it, don't play it in anything less than
640X.  This game is exactly what you'd want from an olympic game.  It has tons
of different events from archery to a 100m sprint.  It's got an announcer and
it's pretty realistic game wise, meaning they pant or take a victory lap after
winning.  One annoying thing about the game is the sound, the shrill of the
crowd is enough to make you go deaf, it seriously hurts your ears.  You have
all the different games, and I don't think I need to explain to you how to run
100m or shoot archery, but you will have a difficult time figuring out which
buttons control what in each event, and like I did in the discus throw, you
might end up looking like a dumbass and throw the discus on top of your head
and then see the stars fly around you.  However if you practice enough, you're
sure to get the hang of it...eventually...maybe...hopefully.  Oh and one thing
this one was missing that any olympic game should have, is that really jazzy,
spiffy, keen olympic theme: "Dun, dun, dun dun dun dun dun dun, dun dun..."

Here, finally, is the full non-beta version of this MK style game.  However
the more and more I try different versions of this, the more and more I think
it sucks, and is just another wannabe.  Here are some previous reviews:
 "This is the beta version of this MK like game.  The previous release was
  just a playable preview.  This one still is a little buggy, but Demolition
  released a patch to fix some things.  It's got a lot of cool things, and the
  graphics are good.  But the movement of the characters just has something
  about it that makes you just not like it.  Also you'll need a pent/100+ to
  play this at a decent speed.  Pray for Death isn't going to be the next
  great fighting game, but it might entertain a select few.  If you do make
  the effort to get it, might as well get the patch to, it lets you play
  certain modes, and also let's you see the character's stats and stuff, even
  though there is no animation of them."
Not much new to add, the animations aren't a necesity, but they will enhance
the appearance.  The opening to each match gets really annoying with that dumb
"Reaaaaaaadddy To Diiiiiiiie" voice that just makes you wanna smack the person
who said it.  Make sure you get the fix to install to places other than C:
and to fix the game over shit.

Here's 4 more levels to keep you busy with.  Although the game starts to get
a little boring and repetitive with killing the enemies, but the new scenery
and stuff to do kinda keeps it lively and entertaining.  I got stuck on level
3 after beating some knight in armor, anyone know what to do?  Anyhow, if you
liked the game, defintetely get the addon levels 2-3 and if you really love
it, got for 4 and 5.  There was a 3rd pack, but I don't think ANYONE got it.

Pretty basic and plain flying game.  Not too much complexity, simple polygon
shapes and plain ugly graphic colors.  You shoot at shit and blow it up,
that's about it in this one, not much else to say.  Not worth the time, it
ain't too pretty looking.  However, then I tried out the hybrid version, which
is the final one.  It was much better, it seemed as though they had added
graphics to it, rather than polygon type shapes, it had actual details and the
plane flew a lot better.  Still nothing too hot, just barely `ok'.  A speech
addon was released, 27 disks, for this game a couple days later.

Disk 1 was spread to a lot of places with arj errors, but there are a few good
copies out there.  However this one didn't seem to like my video card, it
would load up in B&W fucked up screen, and when I tried univbe, it was just
a blank <black> screen.  Guess that just sucks.

Here's another in the endless line of adventure games.  You get thing1, to
undo thing2, which will help you get thing3, which you need to use for thing4,
and in the end you save your uncle from the aliens.  Not much different then
any other adventure game, it has a simple to use interface where you only need
to click left, or click right.  Simple enough, yet boring enough too.  Gfx are
nothing to talk about, so I won't <G>.  Sound is lame music, semi-good at
times.  Overall unless you got lots of time and love playing these things,
then go ahead, otherwise don't bother.

+==================================+
How dare Mantis say that this is not "kiddie crap".  If the game is made by
or associated with Disney, has statues that talk to you like you're 3 years
old, and animation and cartoon like people with an easy to use interface,
then you know it's kiddie crap.  This game has characters from the movie...
uh I guess, not like I've seen it.  It's got 5 different games, all of which
are pretty much a rip off of other games, cept they put their cute little
people in place of it and make a cool million.  Arkanoid, food fight, bowling,
are the types of games you play.  Not a bad gift for a little brother or
sister, but most of you don't have a reason to have this.  Nicely done, speech
and animations and shit are all there, not bad, but I'm not a toddler.

There was a lot of rumor about this game having a virus, and I was really
hesitant to try it even after running mcafee and shit.  It had a couple of
0 byte files that were ascii like shit that's fucked up.  But I assure you,
the original copies of this game have no virus, in the game itself, nor in
the installer.  The game is *NOT* the best ever soccer game for the PC, as
the .nfo so braggingly states.  It's a simple, yet pumped up version of that
fairy sport.  You can run this baby in enhanced gfx mode without any speed
problem.  However the game looks like it was designed for 386's and 286's
because it moves so fast.  Also the ball bounces in weird ways when you kick
it with the up-style kick.  The keys for kicking/sliding are left shift, left
control and uh `z'.  The graphics and sound aren't great, and there is an
announcer, but this really isn't such a hot game.  It does have indoor soccer
arena choice, which is cool in a game like fifa, where the game field is not
the size of your dick like it is in this one.

+==================================+
Oh yes, another pinball game.  This is only one table, hardly what I would
classify as an "edition".  It's for windows, and therefore by nature sucks.
The game doesn't have any scrolling or anything, it's just a flat out picture
of the table, pretty small looking too.  The sound is gay, and the graphics
are not hot.  Yeah it has shit like multiball, but that's about it.  Pretty
bland, pretty boring, pretty much not worth the time.
