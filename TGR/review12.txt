-I'm trying out a new way of displaying the reviews, instead of the usual
format of =Game= and then the Group, disks, I'm going to be showing the diz's
instead.  They will never have any courier tags in them so don't bitch or
moan that your group couriered it.  IF YOU LIKE THIS WAY OR DON'T LIKE IT YOU
HAVE TO LET ME KNOW!  If you don't write to me saying whether or not you like
it, I'm going to assume you like it.  So if you prefer the previous way more,
then TELL ME!  Write to ionizer@ns2.clever.net, takes two seconds to do!  And
since I feel I must give credit to where credit is due, thanks go out to
Rebel Chicken for the idea, we'll see how people like it soon ;) .

Important Information:  B/C TGR's purpose is to review games and not explain
(Yes, AGAIN...)         controversey/problems/misunderstandings, I won't go
                        into detail.  TGR will continue to appear in INQ, as
                        long as INQ continues to appear, and basically that's
                        all you, the reader, should care about.

if u liked the movie, get this!!!! -jim ;)
(=[01/22/96]================================)
Although a bit huge in size, 81 megs installed, this is a full length comic
book involving the plot of the movie "The Mask".  The music <when applicable>
is excellent, and the entire comic book is voice narrated with tons of comic
book like pics.  In some instances there is also animation to go along with
the pictures.  To get started quickly, click the face picture in the bottom
right after clicking the "Who's laughing now" picture, this will pretty much
take you through the whole comic book, so hope you have some free time, it's
lengthy.  This is not a game, so don't think you'll have fun "playing" any-
thing, it's just a comic book for your computer.  Another thing to note, is
after you get through the first "chapter" you'll find more and more sounds
were ripped, which makes it less enjoyable, and eventually you'll see that
the entire last chapter was ripped.  <Fuck, now I don't know what happened.>

Although only a demo, it doesn't seem to be missing much.  This sim game is
a lot like warcraft, but it's missing the real time action that makes WC2 so
great.  This is more of the SVGA, skill thinking, rather than just simple
building and fighting.  I'd also reccomend a pentium for this sucker, it
takes forever for it to load up and set the scenario.

This is a non-playable demo of the game.  It looks very similar to NBA Live
'96.  It doesn't look too promising unless they plan on improving the graph-
ics and some better sound, because it's pretty ugly right now.  It's also not
to fast even on a pent/100.  We'll have to wait to see if they improve it,
but as it looks, this ain't not NBA Jam.

Hmph, this is far from quality, or something you'd expect from Penthouse <G>.
It's a really buggy game, constantly locking up, and hell you don't even have
to play the game to see the good shit!  The pictures are all in gif format,
der DreaMedia!  So have fun copying pictures of your friends mom and renaming
them, and listen to her say nasty things to you, all over a good game of BJ.

No, this isn't the same thing, although this group seems to be very in to
porn games.  This is a pretty big game considering there is only 2 bitches to
play poker against.  When they lose their first 100 bucks they take strip off
some clothing and you watch the video, then another 100 and some more clothes
and it goes on till they are nude, and then it's over.  You don't get to fuck
the bitch, or get some nice close up shots, so it's really not worth it <G>.
Hint: When you get the bitches shirt off, click the picture so it's off the
      cards, and then grab <click> her tits *Honk, honk*.

Well this name sounds familiar, so it could be a dupe, but don't take my word
for it.  Anyway, this is a pretty good tank shoot em up.  The graphics for
the intro and game over part is pretty good.  The actual game play doesn't
have the best graphics, but they are still ok.  You have to rescue hostages
in your first mission.  It's definitely challenging, and the controls are as
follows: q <up>, a <down>, < <left>, > <right>, spacebar <shoot>, and I think
s is to change weapons.  To get started quickly, go to the briefing room on
the right, then go inside the next door, and your mission begins.  A doc or
instructions for how to get the other shit to work would be nice.

Consider it a wannabe Leisure Suit Larry crossed with a lame adventure game.
It's got those bright ega looking type colors, although it is vga.  There's
no humor <and if there is, it sucks> and there is way too much yacking and
sitting around waiting for the lame convo to end.  It's just not a very attr-
active, and it doesn't keep you drawn to it.  I think I'll go take a nap now.
Note: There were like a bunch of .exe's after you unzipped it, I don't know                                
      what they are, but I wouldn't advise trying them out, so be safe and
      delete them, and you'll have nothing to worry about.

=Duke Nukem 3D (BETA)=
        WOW!  Move over doom, move over quake, make way way for the classic.
Although just a beta <and sw> this game KICKS ASS.  If you have the computer
to put in SVGA and a good graphics mode you'll love this.  Pretty soon you'll
be saying "Doom?, what's that?".  Perhaps it's the fact that the game <1st
episode> takes place in a real life area, rather than those boring and stupid
catacombs we've been drowned with.  Your in the city, but the one bad thing
is that Apogee is still using monsters, I mean why couldn't they make it all
different types of gangsters or something.  When's the last time you saw a
monster in the city (no, that big fat lard was still human).  Anyway, you can
take a piss, watch a porn flick, and blow up motherfuckers and watch their
blood splatter on the walls.  This game appears to have it all.  Now if you
will excuse me, I need to go find some dramamine.

I got two words for ya pal...but I'd rather say it in many more.  It's a fake

There's no .exe's and it appears as though they just took some .arj's from
some kiddie program and renamed the arj's.  Don't waste our time faggots.

A small and weird arkanoid game.  It's got all this shit coming down at your
thing when you try to break the blocks.  Lots of obstacles to avoid and other
hard shit.  I would only reccomend this to someone who loves Arkanoid games,
lives in a mental hospital, jail, or just has a lot of spare time in which
they can't go anywhere.

Another great game released this week!  This is very similar the screamer
type of racing game, but you race with either a luge, a skateboard, a bicycle,
or with rollerblades.  Personally I reccomend the luge, it picks up speed
fast on the downhills.  There's 5 or 6 different tracks you run.  You face
15 other computer players, who you can kick and punch off the course.  You
have to avoid many different obstacles on the course, which are usually rele-
vant to the place the course is in.  A good game, but it can get boring quick.
A modem patch or network might help make it more interesting, because the
computer players are very good, and coming in 1st or 2nd means you have to be
more than just perfect. Definitely check it out if you like racing type games.

Real Deal and Arcade America will be in next weeks.  The reason for this is
because they are for win95, and I have to copy them to disk then x-fer them
to another computer in order to try them out.  Hopefully I'll have my arcnet
<network stuff> up soon, and therefore this will aid in the process.

                         <*>GAME OF THE WEEK<*>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-This week we have another tie for GOTW!  Believe it or not, for the first
time, a BETA/SW wins the award, DUKE NUKEM 3D.  Also receiving the award is
RAZORCD'S release of ESPN EXTREME GAMES.  Duke Nukem 3D is your typical Doom
game, but consider it to be the most advanced of all them, not to mention
funny and appealing.  No more lame catacombs, this SW episode takes place
in Hollywood.  Whether your in the streets or in the porno shop checking out
a porno flic, or taking a leak, you'll always have your `gun' with ya ;).
ESPN Extreme Games is similar to screamer but your not in a car.  This is the
more athletic side, either rollerblading, skateboarding, luging, or bicycling
this is a great game.  The scenery might seem to get repetitive, but it does
not last too long, and pretty soon there will be some new graphic.  For fun,
on the race where you're in a greenhouse type place, and there are chickens,
punch the fucking chicken and watch it explode.  Mmmm Mmmm, KFC for dinner!
