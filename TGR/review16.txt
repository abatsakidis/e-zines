SYNDICATE WARS/BULLFROG -PREVIEW- [02/02]
Uhhhhhhhh...someone tell me what the fuck the point of this lame ass preview
is?  All it has is two blue bars on the left, and four of the same figures
in the middle of the screen.  All you can do is move them around in circular
paths, there's not shooting or anything, wtf?

A very simply, small, and basic pinball game.  It includes 3 tables, which
each contain 2 bonus tables.  Their is no music, and the sfx are below avg.
It's not very good, and it looks extremely old.  Not worth it even to have as
a `just to have' game.

Poorly packaged, first arj isn't even an arj.  But in the end you can manage
to get a few .avi's out of it.  Even then it's still pretty lame, only a
major loser would keep these starwars avi's on his computer.  That's valuable
hd space that could be used for quality things such as pr0n.

Marilyn Monroe Multimedia CD-Rip [xx/33]
COREL CD HOME Products - Over 100 Photos,
with newreels footage & narration.
-This rip is missing all, but 2, movies.  It's basically a timeline of MM's
life.  It includes tons of pictures, journal entries, and at times voice nar-
ration.  It would be perfect if you had to do a report on her, or if you are
or were a big fan of hers.  Other than that it's kinda pointless ;) .

Welp, here's the full version.  Like the .nfo states, this game is very sim-
ilar to fatal racing.  It includes around 10 tracks.  You're restricted to
the road, so no off-track racing, but you got lots of tracks with jumps and
those 360 things in the air.  You'll need a 486/66 for the minimal graphic
settings, for it to be decent.  I'd suggest a pentium/133 for full SVGA and
full graphics.  It's a good game, but could become boring quickly.  It does
have modem play which might keep it a little more entertaining a little
longer.  Overall it's a good car game, but certainly not the best.

OUCH!  What a blow to ID this is going to be.  Although we all know their
purpose in releasing this was to get reports of bugs and problems, but MAN
this is still going to kill sales.  THIS IS THE PIECE OF SHIT THEY'VE DONE
IN THE PAST 2 YEARS?!?!?  WTF WERE THEY DOING HALF THE TIME?  FUCKING EACH
OTHER?!?!  Not only was Duke Nukem 3D better than this crap <by a longshot>,
but I think it would be safe to say that Doom 1/2 is better than this too.
Damn, I hope the SW/Final is a lot better than this crap, b/c this is a piece
of junk.  Don't even bother downloading it no matter what, b/c it will either
(a) dissapoint you (b) make you not want to d/l the final which might be
better (c) make you think you're back in the early 90's beta testing wolf 3d.

A very colorfull scrolling shoot em up game.  Just one little itsy bitsy pro-
blem, HTF DO YOU SHOOT?!  I can move left, I can move right, I can move up,
I can move down, so now I can play dodge-the-bullets.  Maybe you need a joy-
stick, but I hate those things.  Other than that MINOR problem, it's similar
to tempest 2000, and it has great color and arial view, like the shit on the
ground is not actually perfectly straight from you.  You do see like both
sides of a house, etc, depending on which side you're on.  Oh, I also could
not get any sound to work.
                RATING: 50/100 <add another 5 if you got it to shoot>

A crappy 3rd person small screen viewability game.  It makes you appear as
though your some high-tech robot who analyzes like every piece of crap you
find.  The viewing ability is like 1/4 of the size of you monitor, and the
game play is choppy.  No music, average background sfx, nothing special.
Unless you are uh....hmm...a....uhh..a dork, then you won't like this.

What a fucking piece of shit for 28 disks.  It's a lame War simulator thingi,
and it's ugly.  This thing looks like it's from 1988, and it probably is.
I think it's from SSI, but the gfx were so ugly I couldn't make it out.  Even
war sim fans shouldn't bother.

SUPER STARDUST PLAYABLE PREVIEW by BLOODHOUSE
---------------------------------------[3/3]-
A very upbeat space game.  It has two parts, one is inside a tube and your
thrusted forward trying to avoid and shoot things.  The other part is similar
to a game of the past <but I dont recall the name> in which your in the mid-
dle of things, and you shoot asteroids and can go all over the screen.  The
music makes it seem lively, but it's a pretty simple game preview.  Not bad.
