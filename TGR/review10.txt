                     -<*><*> THE GAME REVIEW <*><*>-
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
=Full Destruction SVGA Commercial=
        FCS, 6 disks.  Kept coming out with an error.  Tried subst/cdemu2/
fakecd, none worked.
                                RATING: NA/100

=Tilt=
        ?, 32 disks.  I believe this is the also known as "3D Hyper Pinball"
or something like that and it was released by Hybrid, 13 disks a while back.
However, I was unable to get their version to work, but I was able to get
this one to work.  This is an excellent realistically looking 3D rendered
pinball game.  It contains 6 boards, some of more quality then others.  The
sfx are what you could expect, but there is no music.  Their are 3 graphic
modes you can use, which changes what type of mode you play the game in (such
as following the ball up and down the table, or an entire view of the table,
or a mixture of, etc..).  Try and play around with the graphic modes and view
modes to get it so that you aren't going to want to vomit by the time your
done playing.  This is a very good, realistic pinball game, if you're looking
for one.  It's not the Pinball Fantasies type series, but it's very good.
                                RATING: 76/100

=Virtua Girlfriend Krondor=
        Has the "1024" virus, and 99.9% chance it's fake.
                                
=Need For Speed Plus=
        FNW, 35 disks.  It includes two bonus tracks, extra pictures, extra
sounds, "new intro" and more according to the nfo.  If you don't know what
this is by now <then your a newbie lamer>, then I'll tell you!  Actually, no
I won't, you should know... ok, ok j/k.  NFS is one of the ultimate, if not
the best, pc car racing games out.  The graphics when put into full effect
are supreme and realistic, and you don't see the same trees going by every
second.  The sound effects are what you can expect from a car game, and the
horn on the cars is a cute feature.  It has modem play, which I haven't test-
ed yet, but would love to some time soon.  This game is full of quality, it's
from Road & Track, and they know their cars, ferrari's, acura lsx something
or another and lots of other cars are included.  An absolute must for any car
racing fanatic.
                                RATING: 95/100

=Realms of Chaos " '96 "=
        NFS, 3 disks.  Ok this is like the fucking third time I've downloaded
this registered Apogee piece of shit.  How many more times do we need to
release it.  So I'll just DUPE my review like they duped this release:
       "Welp, no need to write something different for a game just because it
was registered.  We all know this just means more levels, but in some diff.
color or some slight difference.  So here's the quota from review4.txt:
       "Suprisingly somewhat good.  Similar to Jill of the Jungle.  I beat
the sw version in less than 20 minutes.  You'll be bored of this in less than
1 day if the reg. version came out."
        I stand by my word.  I was done with it in 5 minutes." <REVIEW7.TXT>
                                RATING: 41/100
        Wow, a quote of a quote of a quote of a quote...

=Fun 'n' Games Deluxe=
        For Kids Only (4KO), 9 disks.  Well it's pretty good for size and
what it has.  Your little brother/sister or son/daughter might enjoy it. If
you find yourself enjoying it, then I would assume your parents are also
having a babysitter come over to watch you while they are out.  It's got some
games, paint stuff, music stuff, and well, just other `stuff'.  It's not top
quality, but it's not a piece of shit either.  The games are probably good
for someone aged 5-9, can't picture anyone else enjoying it.
                                RATING: 61/100 <for a kid>

=Power Rangers SS=
        ?, 22 megs <16 arjs>.  It was so nice of this anonymous group to
include all the files but the actual SS program itself.  Now you can listen
to really cool .wav's of lasers and other lame sfx, and have a bunch of use-
less .ssi pictures on your hd, w/ no way of viewing those leet power rangers.
                                RATING: NA/100

=Beavis & Butthead: Virtual Stupidity=
        Legacy, 29 disks, WIN95.  RoR's release from a while back was only
the diff. games that can be played during the "REAL" game.  It's an adventure
game where you, uhh huhuh, uhh Beavis, what's the point of this crap?  Uhm,
heh, I dunno, they just like wanna make money and stuff.  It's a pretty good
game, but the release cut out a lot of the .WAV's that are needed to play the
game.  So you hear some of the things they say, but have no idea what to do
b/c you don't hear some of the other things.  If you like this, I suggest
buying it b/c that's the only way to fully enjoy it.
                        RATING: 82/100 <if you had all the wavs>

=BigTop Interactive (DEMO)=
        VCR, 9 disks.  This is very similar to Fun `n' Games Deluxe, except
it's for windows.  It includes music, drawing, and some stupid ass "groove
thing".  It's for kids <*grumble hmrph*> and I'd say the age group for this
one goes down to like 4-8.  It's pretty much a strict-budget product, and
is nothing that I'd go run out and buy for anyone.
                          RATING: 42/100 <for a kid>
=Tornado V1.0E=
        Legacy, 4 disks.  Here's another version of this not too good flight
simulator.  The lack of decent graphics and colors make it seem so dull.  I
wouldn't even reccomend it to major flight sim enthusiasts.  Although for its
small four disk size, it might still be worth checking out.
                                RATING: 53/100

=The Unreal Editor / Unreal Beta=
        RoR, 3 disks, WIN95.  This is supposed to be Epic Megagames competit-
ion for Quake.  While this is just a beta version of the game, it looks VERY
promising.  The graphics are excellently smooth and good.  The music is
extremely superb.  I was only able to walk around <didn't find any monsters
or anything to shoot> so it's hard to judge as to what the actual game will
be like.  This incorporates a lot of new things that we haven't seen in the
usual "doom" type games.  We'll have to see how the finished product turns
out before we can fully judge it.
                        RATING: 60/100 <for a beta>

=Xenophage Beta (Public BETA)=
        Exile, 4 disks.  It's Apogee's wannabe MK.  The traditional fighting
game.  This one shows close up fighting, which makes it a very weak game, b/c
it's more like smashing a couple of buttons fast and then you win.  Not much
movement involved if any at all.  The graphics aren't too clear either, even
though it's SVGA.  The sound fx are barely heard over the lame music track.
The announcer's voice makes it sound like your computer is losing power.  It
just doesn't have what it takes to compete with the rest!  The beta includes
1 background and 3 characters, reg has 10 of each.  Don't be expecting it to
be the next MK or SF, it's just not good, but that's Apogee for you!
                                RATING: 46/100

                         <*>GAME OF THE WEEK<*>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Games released a second time <even if it is a different version, ex: B&B,
and NFS +, are not eligible to receive GOTW>.  So if you take those releases
out, the best game of the week Tilt.  Yeah, it was released before also, but
had I gotten it to work then, it would have at least had a chance to win GOTW
Tilt is an excellent realistic pinball game, a must for anyone who likes pin-
ball games.  It's got plenty of boards to keep you busy with, and the usual
games to play on the LCD boards on the pinball game.

-The WC2 Animations need to be run by doing this:
After running the install, go to the main dir and edit the war2.ini.
Look for the line "intro=0" and change it to "intro=1".
Then run war2 <don't click the mouse or anything, just watch.>
It would be nice if the retarded group who released this, wrote this in an
info.  Don't worry if you already deleted it, b/c the intro was nothing
special compared to the game.
