-A very brief, and I mean brief, summary of the worthy games out during TGR's

-Did you miss us?  You did?  Awww poo' baby, had to download games without

-In early December, one of the only magazines to compete with TGR for
 longevity and popularity, decided to call it quits.  Yes, I'm talking about
 RCN.  Not everyone liked it, but everyone did read it.  Good luck, in life,
 to those who ran it.  For those of you who read TGR through RCN, please
 read the section on ways of obtaining TGR.

                (40-49)/100 = Possibly worth downloading.

                (80-89)/100 = Very good, 9 outta 10 its worth the download.

RATINGS are based on the game idea, graphics, sound, playability, ingenuity,
versatility, and a lot of other words ending in `ity'.  These games are based
on what happens on MY COMPUTER ONLY, unless stated otherwise.  I always first
follow .nfo directions, and if those don't work or are not available, I then
try other ways.  So just b/c it doesn't work for me, doesn't mean it won't
work for you.

No sound, shitty graphics, but it's got this neat little feature to let the
guys battle.  Rather than check mating and whatnot, you actually fight with
the guys in this little square and you're sword determines how much power you
have.  This is the only chess game in my life where I've actually played...
lost of course...but I played the entire thing.  You really don't need to
know how to play chess, because you can always fight your way to winning, but
it helps to know how to play.  Nice concept, lame gfx and no sounds.
PS: Unarj it manually, the installer doesn't seem to work properly.

This is a collection of shooting games, but they also stuck in one fishing
game.  The games are all pretty similar, except you shoot different things
in each one.  The one I'm sure you'd have to enjoy (especially if you live
in the city) is the Pigeon Shooting one.  This single game is pretty cool,
pigeons are flying around in some park and you shoot them with a shotgun and
there blood and guts fly all over.  Just like what you'd wanna do in real
life!  The graphics are mostly sceneries with little birds flying across.
The sound you really only hear is the one of your gun.  Oh, for fun, in DH2,
shoot your dog.  The name of the games in this package are: Duck Hunt II,
Pigeon Hunt, Fly Fishing, Pheasant Hunt, and Trap Shooting Pro
PS: Once again the installer doesn't seem to work, but it's got some decent
    art work in it.  So just unarj it manually.

Criss Cross Quiz Vol 1.

=======================
This is windows crossword game.  The kind that are in the newspapers.  You get
a clue and pray to god it fits in the square boxes, and if it doesn't you go
around bugging people all day for help.  Anyway, it's garbage unless you have
some kind of strange fetish for crosswords.  Check out this part of the nfo:
"Expect to see much more from CtL (The Cartel) real soon!!!".  Man, if I had
a dime for everytime an nfo said that, I'd have like $3.40.  Yeah I'd be one
rich motherfucker...I wonder who would give me the dime for everytime the nfo
actually...oh right the game, don't bother.

SNOW WHITE:  Mirror, mirror on the wall, who writes the gayest software of
             them all?
MIRROR: While MVP Software is a threat, Microforum is by far the gayest yet!
This is probably one of the stupidest ideas for a software program in ages.
While it is programmed very nicely, they don't program bad or anything, it's
just a really DUMB idea.  All this is, is a tarot card thingi, a highlighting
picture of a palm that tells you how to read one, and a how-to on tarot cards.
Their is like 8 different buttons at the main menu and they try to make it
look as if there is a lot to offer, but most of them are garbage, like: quit,
credits, options, guest list, etc.  Only two of them are any good, the one
which produces tarot cards and the one that tells you how to read palms.  Un-
less you plan on becoming a tarot card reader and making below minimum wage
at some side show carnival, don't bother.  It does happen to be put together
well, like when it loads it shows a picture of a lit candle getting smaller
and it's got a nice main menu with these eyes that follow you, but if you
look passed it's shell, you'll see it's crap.

This is another 3 outdoor sportsman like games, hunting and fishing.  The
setup for the game doesn't work properly, so just load the .exe's from the
program directory (as later indicated by Reflux with an apology/fix).  The 3
games are a duck hunt, a prarie dog slaying, and winfish.  The duck hunt and
prarie dog have been released sometime in the past by themselves or in some
other package.  The winfish is just a different version of the one released
in Sportsman's Paradise.  Anyway they all suck and if your going to get a
hunting game, go get Sportsman's Paradise.  These are just too crappy to be
bothered with.  TBS later released a minimized version, as if anyone wanted
it in the first place.

Well this sure as hell doesn't match up to the level of game like "You don't
know Jack!", but it sure tries hard to.  It's a quiz game, questions come up
on the screen, you click on a little circle shaped thing on A,B,C,D to the
corresponding answer.  It has several cartoon animations of what Tiger Soft-
ware designers must think is a "cool teenager".  He either compliments you
or disses you, but the animations become repetitve after a while and then
are annoying.  Pretty good quiz game, just not that great.

Sure this game is a dupe, but there was nothing out, so I got it to review
anyway.  It's not really even a game, it's more so of a util that helps you
setup and customize your win/w95 with screensavers, backgrounds, sounds, and
other shit.  The theme focuses on this faggot Wallace and his dumb dog Gromit,
they're really gay.  Don't bother unless it's for a little bro or sis, and
even then, procede with caution and stuff.

This game got off on a bad start.  First the install.exe would not properly
install.  So then I went to the setup, worked fine, setup everything.  Then
I went to run the game, runs fine, intro works, all the options at the main
menu work, except the "New Game" one.  After you hit new game, it asks for
the level <which you'll notice is backwords according to the background
pictures>.  Then when you choose the level it comes up with an error about
not being able to find a file.  So in conclusion, it don't work...for dos at
least.

Well it might be a dupe, but we hear at TGR Fun Palace are really bored right
about now, so we're reviewing pretty much anything.  Here's a smaller version
of MOO2, no sound, no movies, just the game itself pretty much.  The game, for
those who don't already know, is a sim city but in a larger sense.  You're
dealing with planets and solar systems here rather than a city.  You get the
point.  The interface is pretty good, but there's so many different things to
pop up in different windows, that it's not as simple as the sim* games.  Only
for those with a lot of time on their hand.

Wow.  This is a pretty good game for it's extremely small size.  Sure, it's
chinese based, but it's 100% playable b/c it has english sub titles for the
menu, and that's all you need.  This is exactly like mario kart, but in the
chinese tradition with their characters.  This is a beta, but I didn't notice
any bugs.  You race your vehicle through paths <excellent steering control>
against a bunch of other computer opponents.  You pick up either firing weap-
ons or bomb laying weapons which you use by hitting ctrl or alt.  This beta
only has 3 levels, and after getting the hang of the game, I beat it in no
time.  Pretty fun, of course it's worth the very small size it is...and hell
it's a shitload better than anything else that came out this week.  This will
keep you occupied for however long it takes you to beat it, but it provides
some quick fun.

Here's a decent shoot em up.  It's almost exactly like Virtua Cop.  The gfx
however are not as crisp, and the sound is average.  You don't control the
direction you move, you just have to aim at the guys and shoot them before
they shoot you.  It's great if your looking for a game like Virtua Cop or any
shoot-em-up b/c it's so small.  However it's certainly not the best out there.
PS: Run the setup.bat then the play.bat and if you get sharing violation
errors, just hit `F' for fail and the game will still work fine.

Well here's yet another wannabe tetris game.  I coulda sworn that companies
would have stopped designing these games by now, but I guess some people never
learn.  It's got nice psychodelic backgrounds to it, and the music is ok.
It's just tetris but with weirder shaped objects.  Nothing much else to say.

Well this is certainly an original game.  It's really weird, your this pogo
stick-like object.  You can bounce, or you can grow taller and then make a
rope so you can get across things.  It's hard to describe, but for 2 disks it
can either keep you busy or make you laugh if you find it pathetic.  It's one
of those games where you get to see the entire level on one little board, and
you have to collect objects from the board and then move on to another level.
It sometimes requires thinking, but it's pretty simple.  Gfx and sound are
below average.

Saved the best for last.  First off, in order to run this game, you need (or
well I did) to have MSCDEX running.  Here's a long awaited title for those of
you who follow the gaming industry.  It's based on some foreign movie or some-
thing.  It's an Alone in the Dark game engine, but much more simpler, graphics
a hundred times better, and SPEECH AND MOVIES! (Amazingly they're in there).
The only negative to this game is it's a little slow when the characters
speak and the dialogue also shows up, it takes a while before you can move or
do anything.  The game is a great 3D adventure.  I think your some kid who is
supposed to rob and steal for some old ladies or something.  At least that's
how the beginning starts off.  This is a great game, and anyone who likes 3D
adventures should try it out.  The backdrops are splendid ;).

Sorry folx for creating the delay, there were a few problems today, a
couple I'm not gonna go into to, but to really make a long story short,
something I played within the last 2 weeks roached my install of directX3.
I got kinda worried when anything I tried to rewiew wouldn't play, so I
loaded up Red Alert, which I know works.. Anyway, I was up about 12 hours
past my bedtime this morning trying to get dx3 working and to get the
W95gr out the door with no luck.. Off to reinstall 95 (which I was hoping
I could get out of doing until Memphis final hit the net). A dx3 reinstall
didn't do the trick. Take this and the other problems that came up today,
and you have "pAth0s is a fuckup today" :P
So, be careful with the games from the past couple weeks, one, of em
roached my directX.

As evident by the size of the `Other Releases' section, their was more crap
or level addons or repackagings or just plain dupes than usual.  However
through the mess and slow moving game week, rises a small peak that barely
rises over the fog...I feel like I'm writing a fucking novel...anyway the
damn GOTW was going to go to TRD for their small, but decent game: KARTRACE.
This would have been a first in TGR history, as would have been the first
ever game written mostly in Chinese to win GOTW (actually it's the first
chinese game to ever be in TGR with out me making fun of chinese ppl).
HOWEVER, the GOTW goes to REFLUX for their release of CITY OF LOST CHILDREN.
This excellent 3D adventure game is one to sure keep you busy, and I'm sure
we'll see walkthroughs out for it in a matter of days.

with a t3 connection is not going to bother getting it.  It will take anywhere
from 5 hours to 1.5 hours to unrar this depending on your computer.  This is
such an unbelievably stupid thing to do and you are equally stupid if you try
to download it.  If you want it, buy it. The group, RTC, should stand for:

-Over the time TGR was `absent' there were numerous games released.  However,
 of all the games released, the only two I can seriously reccomend for their
 quality and size, were TOMBRAIDER (c) Bethesda from PRESTIGE [xx/21] and
 C&C2 (Red Alert) (c) Westwood from RAZOR [xx/34].  Tombraider is like an
 improved Alone In The Dark engine combined with kick ass fighting, story
 line, puzzles, and overall quality that will most likely become addicting.
 As for C&C2, you should know what it is, if not, it's basically the Warcraft
 style game, but with missions rather than just conquering.  The graphics
 are great, and the options are plentiful, but you can only run SVGA in win95.
-Extra special thanks goes out to Comwood and Blackened for their help.
-That's it for this week, hope it was of help.
