Un-Releastic:  "I have never played a game I didn't like."  -Stu Pid Fewl
Realistic   :  "This game sucks more than 3 lesbians and a blow pop!"
                                                                    -Ionizer
(*) SPECIAL NOTE (*)
-Since I started this review/magazine about 4 months ago (with WWN), there
have been a lot of other wannabe's with their neat little coded reviews that
require you to actually download the 130k review <for just one game> and then
unzip it and then run it.  The Game Review has a simple concept, to inform
you of what is what in the gaming world, what works, what doesn't work, how
to fix things, and an occasional game hint.  The idea is simple, making it
easier for you the reader to get a hold of it, and view it.  No need for
unnecesary color viewers.  It's released on a consistent basis every Sunday,
and even has the latest game on Sunday in the review.  Sometimes you have to
wait weeks just to get ONE game review from another group.  This review/
magazine allows you to evaluate the weeks games and then decided what to
download after having heard everything you need to know.  Other groups put
information that you never could possibly dream of needing to know and they  
seem to think that EVERY game is a 8 or 9 out of 10.  What was the point of
me writing this?  Absolutely none, but it was something to do.  And that's
another thing, The Game Review is honest, and is not bias to any group
whatsoever.  What the game got or criticism a group got, is what they
deserved.  I also try to add a touch of humor to it, because we could all use
some of it during our day.

("Where and when can I get The Game Review?" The Game Review (c) Ionizer,)
(will be released every SUNDAY, in IRC, in #warez5 and other channels and) 
(can be obtained by /m iondcc xdcc list or /m ionizer xdcc list on Sunday)
        (This magazine is also released in the magazine Inquisition)

-Do you live for games?  Do you want to play games every second of your life?
Do you find yourself picturing me playing these games and reviewing them?, If
so I'm calling the police and filing a suit against you for stalking, but
that's besides the point...

                     -<*><*> THE GAME REVIEW <*><*>-
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
=The Last Eicchof=
        Uhhhhh.  Who are the wackos that come up with these ideas?  It's an
asteroids game, but with beer.  Your not a ship, your a beer bottle and you
shoot beer, you buy beer weapons and you shoot more beer.  Strange.
                                RATING: 42/100

=Powerslave Playable Demo=
        Another doom type.  It's a little different then others, but still
the same 'ole thing.  Might keep you occupied for like 5 minutes.
                                RATING: 38/100

=Descent 2 (Nonplayable Preview)=
        Looks like descent all over again.  Sure it may appear to have cooler
graphics and all, but when it comes down to it, there can't possible be too
much difference b/t this one and the first one.

=Virtual Karts=
        RazorCD, 22 disks.  Tisk Tisk Tisk! Poor packaging = a game that orig
does not work = an addon thats really a 28 disk fix.  First off, the nfo says
to run "VKARTS.EXE" when there is only a VKART.EXE, secondly when you do run
it, it says the sound config file is missing.  So you NEED the 28 disk addon
which somewhere in it has the file it was looking for before.  So now you got
a 230 meg <unarjed> game on your puter (22 disks + 28 disks = 50 disks).  Now
you want to play it, well you better hope you have a pretty fast computer, &
a steering wheel type joystick.  The game runs extremely slow and unplayable
on a 486/33 and the mouse method of controlling it is impossible, and you can
not use your keyboard for the actual game playing.  The game is racing, but
in go-karts, lots of different tracks, and options, including network.  If
you really like it I would suggest the need to buy it, unless you have 230m
to spare.
                 RATING: 68/100 <predicted on a fast computer>

=Front Page Sports Football '96=
        Hybrid, 27 disks.  If you ask me this one's gone a bit over the edge.
Too much sophisticated options, and not enough hard core tackling.  Plus I
don't think I was even playing the game because even though I set the control
for the k/b, all I could do was yell "BLUE 32, BLUE 32" and a bunch of other
shit.  It woulda been nice if they put a keyboard config in the game, but no
they had to waste all the time making little detail shit like "humidity at
the start of game" and a million other weather factors.  All in all, it's
just another brick in the wa.. er I mean football game on the shelf.  Some
docs would be nice.
                                RATING: 63/100

=Torin's Passage=
        Legacy, 38 disks.  Doesn't work, what did you expect.
                                RATING: NA/100

=Lion CD=
        Hybrid, 20 disks.  YES!  I love typing the lion.exe and getting shit
that says "hr_hires.c #1.-1" and locking up my computer.  Thats the kind of
fucking shit that just makes my day!  Damn, If only all games could do that.
I even edited the stupid lions.cfg to my dir, and it still did that shit.
BTW: Unless you feel like having the taipan whisper virus, get the fix, which
is simply the hybrid install.exe w/o a fucking virus, unless of course you
don't believe me that it does not work.
                                RATING: NA/100

=Extreme Pinball REG=
        COL, 5 disks.  Why is it some no-name group can manage to put togeth-
er a game to work, damn it's about time too.  It's the full version of the
pinball game, it's got 4 tables, all nicely done, except for the fact that
they all have too many ways for your ball to go straight down the center of
the pinball machine and lose your ball.  Otherwise it's the same as all the
rest, pretty much.  The usual `dot-light animations' in the game.
                                RATING: 72/100

=Radix, Beyond the Void=
        Since it's still the same game, here's the quote from review2.txt
of the shareware version.

SW:     "Anothe....heart pound...zzzz..OH sorry, um right, another heart
pounding Epic Megagames.  Doom atmosphere in a ship, wow something new <G>.
Annoying soundtrack, and crappy sound effects.  Maybe the other two missions
in the reg. version will really kick ass!   Pff right, and maybe dragon will
release something in english (j/k guys ya know i love ya).  Not much else to
say about this one.
                                RATING: 41/100"

REG:    The registered version has two other missions and the game still is
the true quality Epic that we know (it sucks).  Unless you drool over games
like descent, then you'll probably fall asleep over this one.
                       RATING: 41+2 more missions = 43/100

=Rayman (Non Playable Demo)=
        The demo takes you through parts of the game, in actuality showing
you how to beat it.  It's a nice 3D Scrolling Jump and run type game, similar
in my opinion to Earthworm Jim.  Looks like a pretty fun game if you like
those Super Mario type games.

=The Dig (FLW)=
        FLW, 38 disks.  It's nice to know that when a group fucks up on a
release, that their is another group right behind them to fuck up too!  I
mean how long would it take for these geniuses to realize that their subst
method does not work?  The moron who packaged it probably substituted the
drive WITH the cd rom in it and went "Er, gee Mr. Wilson, it works!"  Come on
wake the fuck up.
                                RATING: NA/100

=Pool Champion=
        Tdujam, 24 disks.  A good windows based pool game, similar to virtual
pool, but a little less virtual, and more role playing.  You play against
certain characters with different artificial inteligence.  The game play good
and the graphics are not as dull as virtual pool.  However tdujam fucked this
one up, because after you play your first game, it's missing the animation of
the characters reaction, and so the game closes.  Other than this minor fault
the game is what you would expect a pool game to be.
                                RATING: 74/100

=Pro Pinball: The Web=
        DOM, 19 disks.  Damn, seems like everything is too big this week. 19
disks for a single table.  Although the nfo criticizes it much more than it
should.  The gameplay seems normal, and it has the now standard `dot-light
animations'.  However the abstination of music may make you think the game is
duller than it actually is.  It's got the usual ramps and multi balls and all
that shit.
                                RATING: 62/100

=Ecco The Dolphin=
        Tdujam, 10 disks.  Far too many problems to name, plus the fact that
it woulda been best run under a pentium/60 as the nfo states, makes this one
unreviewable.
                                RATING: NA/100

=Pro Team Soccer=
        RoR, 400k.  Oh come on guys, I mean don't take me wrong, but WTF IS
THIS SHIT?!  Did you find this lying around on an old 5 1/4 floppy?  Ugly ass
soccer game (must i describe to you what 400k of crap looks like).  The shit
is programmed pretty bad to, like waiting around an hour before kick off. 
Don't waste your time on this.
                                RATING: 9/100

=Fist Light Action Fighting Game=
        RoR, 14 disks and Hybrid dupe, 6 disks (Both exactly the same, how I
have no idea)  I don't know why the nfo (BOTH) refers to this as a "mortal
kombat and sf" type game b/c it's neither.  It's a Double Dragon type game,
but of that `foreign-chinese' type.  Pretty shitty movement, graphics, and
gameplay.  Nothing to get all excited about.
                                RATING: 39/100

=Jigsaw Power=
        Tdujam, 16 disks.  It takes pictures (BMP/AVI/PZL, etc) and it cuts
it into pieces that you fit to make a puzzle.  Why people enjoy doing this, I
don't know, but I know they do, b/c losers in my school sit their playing
some shit just like this on the leet Macs for hours.  The only thing is, I
have a program just like this, except its a minor 39k and this is like 30 or
so megs.
                                RATING: 57/100

=Cog Hill Golf Course=
        Razor, 4 disks.  It's a golf course for links386, must I really try
to install this to disk, just so I can tell you "It's a golf game."  I mean
we all know or should know what links386 is like, this is just yet another of
the million courses available for it.  It's not like it's going to turn the
golf course into some MK type game or make the people in the background nude,
so I don't think there's a need to rate/review it.

=Worms CD=
        ACC, 48 disks.  It's not even really the entire cd, since it doesn't
have the music files.  This one just had the 80+ megs of .avi's that are in
a way fun to watch, but then who the hell wants to see them again after once.
Anyway that's the only difference, and of course the game doesn't just subst.
like the nfo's always say to do, so here's some install help.
-Install nfo:  (1) Unarj <x -y -v> all the files into any dir you want.
               (2) Run setup.exe and install it to any dir other than where
                   it is unarjed to.
               (3) In the dir you unarjed the shit, type: 
                   "xcopy *.* /e <X:\dir\you\told\setup\to\install\to>"
               (4) Then change all the directories in the `install.bat' and 
                   `batch' files to whatever dir you told setup.
               (5) After that is done, make sure you have mscdex running,
                   then subst your cd-rom drive or one past it for the dir
                   you told setup to install to.
               (6) Run "WRMS.EXE" <not a spelling error>, make sure you got
                   your mouse loaded, and note it takes a while to load up.
                   
                 RATING: 94/100 <Non-cd was 93 + 1 for avi's>

=Beyond The Wall Of Stars=
        TUB, 26 disks.  This thing runs like a storybook.  You remember those
stories that there'd come a point where you had to make a decision and then
you would turn to a certain page?  That's exactly what this is, but for win.
It's got plenty of pics and moving animations, its not of top quality gfx, &
neither is the sound, but it is a brilliant idea and done extremely well.  I
only got a chance to go through one game of choices, but I was drawn to it &
couldn't stop playing.  If you have some time, and you don't mind reading a
little, check this one out, it's not your usual game.
                                RATING: 78/100

=Tie Fighter Enhanced=
        Hybrid.  Has the tai-pan virus AGAIN.  Their packager obviously
either hasn't realized it or is not bright enough to get rid of it.

=Darkseed 2=
        Hybrid, 21 disks.  Another adventure click and play, murder solving
game.  Your some dude, who doesn't remember what happened on the night of
your high school reunion where some lady got killed.  So now your a suspect,
and you must figure out who really did it to protect yourself.  The game has
nice digitized animation of the characters, and gorgeous backdrops.  The avis
were cut to make this game downloadable, and they would probably make the
game a lot better.  I didn't seem to want to play this game very long as it
got dull and boring.
                                RATING: 58/100

=Fifa 96 (TFR)=
        TFR, 8 disks.  Let's just say, stick with your other copy if you
managed to get it installed, b/c this one is just as much of a pain if you
have two different hard drives.

=Shannara=                                              (Courtesy of Woody)
        RazorCD, 27 disks.  Better be asking for a new hd for Christmas,
because this game takes up a whopping 101 megs!  This game is a very good
rpg game based on the Shannara book series.  Unfortunately, the game suffers
because the fight scene animations have been ripped out.  The music is very
cool, but the sound fx and voice have been ripped.  The SVGA graphics look
great in this game.  The storyline is good, too.  You have to use your items
to solve various puzzles, travel to different cities, and fight monsters.
And like all good rpg games, this takes place in medieval times.
-NOTE: While playing the game, be sure not to read your journal, if you have
       written anything in it, the game will freeze.
                                RATING: 78/100

=The 11th Hour : The sequel to The 7th Guest=           (Courtesy of Woody)
        4 CDs.  Of course this game won't be ripped, but it needs to be
reviewed since it's so cool.  This game is absolutely amazing.  Probably the
best graphics I've seen on any game ever.  Incredibly detailed SVGA graphics
and video that looks better than tv.  Has an awesome soundtrack too.
Requires a 486dx2/66, and I'd recommend at least a p60.  I'm running it on a
p90 with a 2x cdrom, and I have to run the video in quarter screen because
the double speed makes full screen video choppy.  If you have a 4x or better,
full screen video is no problem.  The game takes place 70 years after the 7th
Guest.  You're a guy that needs to go after your girlfriend who's a reporter
that went into the Stauf mansion and never came out.  The puzzles and games
are even harder than in the 7th Guest, but still very fun.  Buy this one.
                                RATING: 95/100

=EarthWorm Jim=                    (Review Courtesy of HellRaiser aka _HR_)
        Razor, 5 disks.  This win95 game is a translation from a very popular
SNES console game.  This is one of the few console translations that do the
original justice.  Only sound ripped was music, all voices etc are here. The
game play is extremely smooth. Not the slightest bit choppy, in any size
window.  And jaggies are only the tiniest bit noticable in full screen mode, 
in a smaller window they are totaly invisable. This game is a standard side
scroller, where you beast big boss #1 to get to level 2 etc. The handling is
pretty much ok with a joystick, though the keyboard makes it a little
difficult. I have yet to see a dos action game run as smoothly with as much
detail. Here is a perfect example of win95's capabilites when used right. One
notice, the game dir MIGHT need to be in your path depending on your win95
setup.
                                RATING: 95/100

=Hooves of Thunder=
        Tdujam , 15 disks.  Unless you've got a knack for horses and betting
or something like that, you're not going to have fun with this.  You place
bets, or manage a horse, watch the race, and try to become rich.  And just
like in real life, you'll end up losing all your money and becoming a bum.
                                RATING: 60/100

=Bermuda Syndrome=
        ?, 18 disks.  It's a combo of adventure (click + play) and the game
"Out of this World".  This is however only a demo/preview.  Looks kinda neat,
especially the amazon chick in the beginning who's got one tit showing.  Bleh
wtf am I talking about, it's just a drawing.  Anyhow, the game's got nice
music, but the actions are a little slow, and don't work as soon as you press
the button.  Overall the CD is probably going to be somewhat good.
                           RATING: 62/100 <demo>

=Rings of Magi=
        Tyranny, 1 disk.  Cute little puzzle game.  One of those brainteaser
types where you really do have to think.  It's a new idea, not some tetris
wannabe or anything.  Nothing special about the graphics or music.
                                RATING: 57/100

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Nothing overall impressive this week, but the award would have to go to TUB
for their release of Beyond The Stars.  It's a game that we haven't seen the
likes of much, if at all.  It sure as hell ain't the best game in the past
month, but for this week it was the only thing that was a fun thing to play.
I'm not recomending this game as a must get, because to be honest there were
no MUST gets this week.

-Sorry for the late timing of the day, but I like to have the review as up to
date as possible, and this is when time allowed it to be released.
-ANY AND ALL MAGAZINE GROUPS HAVE PERMISSION TO USE THIS IN THEIR
 MAGAZINE, AS LONG AS IT HAS NOT BEEN EDITED IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM
-I was, for a day, w/o an account so I missed a few things AGAIN, but I
got someone to help me out in reviewing them.
-Federal Law prohibits editing and dispensing or something.  You may not edit
this file and spread it w/o the expressed written consent of The New York
Yank.. oh snap, anyway the point is: Feel free to spread this wherever as
long as I don't get in trouble for it, and as long as it has not been edited.
-Please note, due to my refusal to install that crap you know as Win95, I am
of course not able to review any win95 games.
-That's it for this week, hope it was of help and thanx to Woody, and HR.
