-It's pretty empty for a 6 disker.  It's not a screen saver, it's not a game,
it's just a bunch of crap the band shoved together.  Don't bother, even if
you do like 'em.

Gulfwar Firststrike / 4 in 1 Game Pack
NFL (No) (Fucken) (Lamers) 1996
-Actually not too bad for it's size, but like the group that released it,
it's still lame.  It's that MVP software shit, so you know the type.  This
one has a shoot em up, a scud shoot, and a dodge the bullets and shoot game.
It's low budget software, so don't expect much.

Infograms brings you a great SimCity type
game! Although this rocks SimCity's World!
(=[02/16/96]================================)
Like the diz says, it's like SimCity.  However this game deals with more of
the technicalities and numbers, rather than common sense like putting an
ice cream shop in the area where people like ice cream.  You could compare
this with being the governor of New York.  You have advisors who warn you of
problems or suggest things.  There's no music however.  If you plan on becom-
ing governor or a city, you might wanna practice now, but if you don't, you
won't find much enjoyment from this one.  (Plus you can't just go around and
burn or destory everything, easily, like in Sim City.)  Also, this game takes
up a whopping 78 megs, a lot for only 12 disks.

I'd have to disagree with legacy on this.  This is nowhere near the same
`style' of gaming that duke nukem is.  Sure it's still the same type, but
this one is still that catacomb dwelling, sorta heretic type play.  And since
it's an alpha, it has its problems.  Parts of the screen were constantly
flashing for me, that was the only noted PROBLEM.  The music is nothing
great, and the sfx are average.  It might be worth the 13 disks if your
curious enough to see what's coming out, but unless it runs good, you figure
out the keys and everything, don't expect it to be good enough to make you
want to delete your SW Duke Nukem 3d ;).   Included below is legacy's blood
faq for anyone having problems getting it to run.
                                RATING: 57/100
     -The game wont run, says sound fuckup, Pick regular SB
     The pictures is jumpey, and Slow refresh:
     for that one all you do it run SEUTP.exe pick your soundcard
     and set the MHZ to 22 or 11 anything low, all fix, and game 
     will fly, also makes it run faster.
     -If the game says, /snd/something missing
      or cannot locate mpu-401, change music to SB not Midi
      and disable doesnt do it
     -Bad disk 1 Unarj the game MAnually, find Bloodexe.zip it replaces 
     the Blood.exe file all set.
     -You will get CRC errors in 3 files, it uploaded bad, and didnt get 
     caught in time, There is a NEW disk 1 and a Bloodexe.zip
     either one will fix it! 
     -KB goes insane, Unload Doskey, and should be fine, or use Numpad.
                                             -ROAD REBEL!

-Well, let's see, this SS sucks, umm it sucks, and oh yeah it sips too.  No,
actually it doesn't do anything besides play a bird tweet, and a dog bark.
Otherwise it just sits there, a picture looking out a window with a JD on
the ledge, and a JD statue outside.  I mean HTF is this saving my screen?

   Batman Forever (c) Acclaim  [X/6]
It's a platform game.  I've never played the SNES version, but this is supp-
osively exactly like it.  You should definitely have over a 486/66 to run
this game at a normal speed.  The game is not too sophisticated, similar
enemies that you fight off.  You are given riddle (by the riddler of course)
which you need to figure out or understand in order to go on with the game.
If you can figure out everything, it's a decent game, but it's not exactly
a hit.

Stardust Final CD-Rip       [02/02]
-----------------------------------
This game was released before, but I'll just give you a quick reminder of
what it is.  It's one of those asteroid type games, you have a ship that you
can move around on the screen and asteroid type rocks move across the screen
and you have to shoot them.  The rocks divide and you have to shoot them
again.  Also note, don't play this at night, or the sound level they have
this thing set at, will wake up the entire fucking neighborhood.

and registered! A cute little, and addictive
miniature golf game!
(=[02/18/96]================================)
Well finnaly someone got this little game cracked.  The reg includes 8 more
mini-courses, which become much more challenging then first 8.  It's a nice
little game to have if you ever become bored.  Here's the previous quote of
how the game is:
"The holes are in black and white for some stupid reason, so it's a little
hard to tell where the hills and bumps are, but it's a decent miniature golf
game 4 win."

It's yet another platform game from Hybrid.  This one is no where near as
good as some of the recent ones.  It's very similar to those Commander Keen
and orig. Duke Nukem platform games.  You're just some teenager with a pistol
and a hoverboard (ya know your average teenager) and you go around shooting
monsters (just like in everyday life) for god knows what reason.  The music
in this game is pretty upbeat, and it makes it seem as if the game is good,
so don't be fooled!  This is w/o a doubt NOT WORTH 18 disks.

- NBA Live '96 Working CD-RIP
- Net Warez Inc.
[71\71]
Yes, it's the review you've been waiting for.  As many of you know, Napalm's
release did not work, and the misc. sound addon by some group wasn't going to
help.  Well NWI, whoever they are, brings us this huge 71 disker.  Does it
work? YES!  Is it good? YES!  This one's got it all, player pictures, awesome
soundtrack, a million options, you name it, it's got it <except for play by
play>.  However, in order to enjoy this one you'll definitely need a pent/100
or higher, b/c anything lower will result in either having to pick shitty gfx
or screens that come at the rate of 1 per 5 seconds.  The menus and shit are
very similar to NHL '96.  The gameplay looks a little barren with the default
camera setting, so play around to see which way you like it best, there are
over 10 different camera angles possible.  The only people I'd reccomend d/l
this are those with fast computers, plenty of ram, and who like basketball
games.  Although I'm sure you won't keep the 219 megs it takes up on your hd,
you'll get a good preview in case you want to buy it.   If you have a slow
486, don't even bother, because the gameplay will look ugly or slow, and then
it's not worth it.  Oh, and in case your an idiot, which is a good amount of
you, you need to mkdir nba96, and then you arj x -y -v nbalive.arj D:\nba96.
Make sure you copy over the install.dat to that dir.  There's a line about
which dir it goes to, whether or not it works if you change it, I dunno, but
just go with whats there, makes life easier.

It's got a lot of boards, but the screen setup is really crappy.  So the ball
moves faster than you see it, and sometimes in places you can't see.  If you
manage to get it configured well, it's a pretty good.  The boards are pretty
good, nothing special, and the sfx are average.
