-Rating scale:
                 (0-19)/100 = In a nutshell, it sucked!
                (20-39)/100 = Still crap but slightly better.
                (40-49)/100 = Possibly worth downloading.
                (50-69)/100 = Pretty decent game. Might want to check it out.
                (70-79)/100 = Worth the download if you like that type.
                (80-89)/100 = Very good, 9 outta 10 its worth the download.
                (90-99)/100 = Excellent game, a MUST download.
                    100/100 = HOLY SHIT I'VE NEVER SEEN A BETTER GAME!

RATINGS are based on the game idea, graphics, sound, playability, ingenuity,
versatility, and a lot of other words ending in `ity'.  These games are based
on what happens on MY COMPUTER ONLY, unless stated otherwise.  I always first
follow .nfo directions, and if those don't work or are not available, I then
try other ways.  So just b/c it doesn't work for me, doesn't mean it won't
work for you.

Here's a story, of a real dumb game, released by Goddamn Warez.  It loaded up
to the main screen, and played some muuuuuuusic.  Here's the story, of a guy
named Ionizer, who tried to review games for fun.  Then the one day Ionizer
tried to review this, and he got really fucking pissed...b/c the stupid game
just played loud music.  Yeah, uh, anyway, it just loads up the main title
screen and lets you move your mouse around, but absolutely no keys or mouse
buttons do anything, and it just stays there.  Supposed to be some lame ass
soccer manager.

Well this is just another shitty game.  It's a really cheap, bad, flight sim,
with terrible everything, gfx, sfx, control.  It just fucking sucks.  It's not
even worth the 3 lines of review it's receiving.

This isn't even a game.  It's more like a screen saver for windows.  All it
does is show the movement of the body for the `perfect' golf swing.  You don't
control anything, you just watch this silver-ish looking figure swing over and
over.  Quite a waste of time, and quite boring.

Wow, this sure is minimized.  They took out all the backgrounds and pictures
of the buttons of the icons you push.  See review #50 for the review of the
game.  This is just to let you know it's been ripped severely, no sound, the
menus are kinda like guessing at where the buttons are.  But if you want the
game and don't have the room, go for it.

It's bad enough that they didn't mention this was a FUCKING DEMO, but it's
even worse when the demo itself doesn't even setup right, and that there's
two fucking .mov files and all they do is play sound, not even animation.
So this was not only a complete waste of time, but I was so pissed I didn't
get to see any cute, adorable, cuddly, little, koala bears that I could beat
the fucking living shit out of.

Once again, another release that really isn't a game.  This is some kind of

you what certain controls do and shit like that, but it's not really a game.
It's really boring, don't bother.

Editor's note: It crashed on me, so here's a nutshell review:
"Ok started this game up and immediately it tells me it has eaten up memory,
 kinda scared me for a sec.  Then I got to the startup screen, very easy to
 configure and a nice setup.  Then you get to choose between a hummer, a jeep,
 a landrover, or a chevy truck (pick the hummer).  Then like any racing game,
 starting line and GO!!   Cool sounds and good graphics.  Recommended to
 racing fanatics.  Only downfall: I wish there were more cars and trucks to
 choose from."

Yaaaaa knooooow, I fucking downloaded 58 disks, then had the game tell me
that my computer (486) was too shitty to run it anyway.  Like I need a game
to tell me that I can't run it (Ack, hold on, this dos editor is lagging my
machine...just kidding!).  Anyway, b/c of this, I'm going to present you with
several reviews of the game.  Why not just one?  B/c it's a "big title" and I
don't trust just 1 person's opinion.  Oh, and I included each person's rating.

"This long anticpated game is well worth the download even though it is 58
 disks.  The reason it is so big is because Razor knew it was a long awaited
 game so they left most of the game/sound/animations in tact.  Most of the
 game is there.  This is a 3D adventure game.  The basic object is to walk
 around and blow shit up that the computer tells you to do.  This game
 requires VESA 2.0 drivers installed, so if the game plays in infared, thats
 why.  This game also supports 3D video boards, but still looks fantastic with
 out them.  I recommend a p-100 to have it run smoothly.  87/100"

"At First, i was psyched to play the game after all the hype it got...but it
 was kinda dissapointing.  It sounds cool, a game with no point just running
 around killing, how fun.  But, it was mildly entertaining and then it got
 pointless.  With no point, but to run and kill.  It got boring, no new
 enemies.  All the enemies are some dumb robots that are easy to kill.  So I
 give this game a 60/100 because it was not worth my time d/l and installing
 and wasted space and caused me to delete programs to make room."

"MDK (which stands for different things depending on the day, according to
 Shiny's web site) utilizes a 3rd-person view (ala Tomb Raider), and runs
 very nicely on my p100 w 32 meg.  It can best be described as a shooting/
 puzzle game, you run around shooting robots (who wave goodbye to transports
 that drop them off, cower on the ground with their heads under their hands,
 and put their hands up after you shoot them a bit), opening doors, and blow-
 ing up more robots.  The best part of it is the sniper mode, where you can
 zoom in and shoot robots in the head :)  There are a variety of amusing pick-
 ups, including the worlds most interesting bomb (enemies stop shooting you
 and stand around it, then all get killed when it explodes), and a dummy decoy
 (with a picture of you with a clowns head).  Definitely worth the 58 disk
 download, would be better if Razor hadn't taken out mdk95.exe (the win95
 executable).  Probably too hard for them to crack."

Hrmm.. An adventure puzzle game. Well, I guess I should say no adventure,
puzzle game. This is for win 3.11, but the .nfo says W95.. Anyway, this is
just a pretty dorky game. There's 2 puzzles in the first room that you have to
do. Who'd a thought it would take 15 minutes to turn on a light switch? And I
couldn't get passed the 2nd one to open the door. No matter, not missing much.
This was an actual, honest to god, disk based release, which was kinda cool,
but it still don't change the fact that pure puzzle games suck. I suppose if
you're remotely interested in those types of "fuck with it till you figure it
out" types of games, then you could leech this, it's only 5 or 6 disks. For
the average gamer... Don't mess with it.

** POINTS: 50 -Blah who cares?

Ok for starters I tested this game on a P200MMX with 64MB Ram and 4MB Matrox
Mystique.  This game is "supposed" to be a take off of dark forces, but it
isn't even close.  First, even in 800X600 the graphics were choppy on my
system I turned them down a notch and they were accetable.  For an mmx game
it should have been a lot smoother than it was, e.g POD was liquid smooth in
high-res.  The levels in the game are very dark and dismal with no monsters to
shoot just a couple of robot towers and some little droids.  After about 5
minutes of this game I was totally bored.  In my opinion this is not worth the
download try the demo and you will see.

Yulp, the nfo says it all. Yet another 1st person shooter. ie: doom clone.
This one ain't entirely too bad, got super boring though, and I didn't really
understand what you were supposed to do either. Basically you're a robot, or
maybe a person inside a robot, and you blow the shit outta anything you see.
But, that was my problem, I only see one thing to blow up. Nothing really
fancy about this game, just your run of the mill clone. Ok, maybe it was
really all that bad. I mean the grafix were pretty good, but everything else
was shitty. No plot that I could see. There's plenty of other good stuff to
leech.

** Points: 67 -Nothing great about this one.

Wow. If you're into golf, this is the shit here. Probably the best looking go-
lf game I've seen. The grafix are just way cool. I'm not exactly sure what
more to say though, I think we all know what golf is.. You hit the little ball
into the little hole, and if it don't go, you scream and throw your clubs.
Well, I guess if we were in Happy's world. Unfortunately, we're in Jack's.
Jack's a little more civilized. I would've like to had some voice like in MS
golf, but the grafix make up for it. I mean, you can even see mist over the
ground. In order for this to work, you have to un-rar into C:\JNG and you have
to double click on the .reg file inside C:\JNG I'm not a big golf fan, so I'll
shut up. If *you* are, definately give this one a leech.

** Points: 84 -The grafix were outstanding for a golf game.

We had someone review this, and they said it didn't work:
"I had a look at that space simulator MMX, no worky.  I tried everything, you
 hit setup choose english install and boom it exits.  It doesn't install and
 it won't run without installing."
                                RATING: NA/100

Haha Wow.. Holy shit, and all that. This IS the most kick ass tank game I've
ever played. I knew it was coming, but I didn't know exactly how good it was.
This muthafuckahz got it all. Everything from smoke screen, to laser, to
infared, trajectory, and more.. Everything that's in a real abrams. Trust me,
I've been in one :) Ft. Benning, GA. This is from the same people who made
Apache and Hind sims too. And get out the high-end stick for this, lots of
controls, and the more buttons/axis the better. I really didn't get to play
this as long as I wanted to, I've only got about 10 more minutes before this
has to be turned in, so I really didn't get to fuck with every single thing.
Great grafix, and awesome sounds. Had a enemy shell blow up right next to me,
and I literally jumped cuz it was a loud, concussive explosion. You'll need
about 230M not including the .rar's or .zips for this though. And BTW, you
don't need to run the setup.exe either.. Just go into \abrams\abrams and run
the .exe there. I didn't try this, but you can probably delete all the dirs
other than the abrams dir after you unrar.

Not much else to say except to leech this if you can, and have the room to
unrar it.

** POINTS: 93 - Just flat out AWESOME!

This one's kinda neat. You're in this hybrid hovercraft/submarine sorta thing
and you can either be on top of the water, or dive down underwater to blow
stuff up. Not bad grafix and sound. It supports MMX and 3dfx, and not having
either, I was still able to play it in 640x480, with 44khz,16b, stereo sound,
quite smoothly. There's a few controls, and a multi-axis stick is a definate
plus, but I was able to play it fine with my gravis. I just couldn't roll,
unless it was with keyboard. I was able to pull off some killer moves. I went
all the way to the bottom, then shot straight up, out of the water,
continuing the arc, and then hit the water facing straight down again. Kinda
nifty. Oh, BTW, you don't have to run title.exe like the nfo says and install,
all you gotta do is go into the bin directory, and run the config.exe then
tshark.exe to play. Screw that install bullshit.. Not a bad little game for 9
disks, even though it had the standard 3 disk directX install (umm once again,
I'm quite sure we all have directX installed by now)

** POINTS: 83 -Give it a looksee.. Specially if you have MMX or 3dfx.

Haha! This game kicks ass.. Kind of a cross between Quarantine with a fro and
the old commie game Autoduel. You travel from place to place on the highway,
and blow shit up. Your partner goes with ya and helps you out with stuff, and
tells ya what to do in some places. This one actually has a pretty good plot
line to it. As far as weapons go, you've got a machine gun, rockets, and oil
slicks to name a few. You can pretty much control *everything* about your car.
Like it's an automatic, but you can still shift into different gears, like l1,
l2, N, and reverse. Parking brake does awesome power slides, horn, a map, even
binoculars. You can set up the keys for all of it too. I'd really suggest at
least looking at em in the options menu. The voices and sound effects really
kick ass, and add a lot to the game. One of the coolest things about this is
that you can go all the way up to 1024x768 mode to play it. Lots of detail
options too. One gripe I do have is the controls seemed real touchy with my
gravis.. Guess I coulda got the Sidewinder out, it woulda worked a lot better.
Anyway, why are you still reading this? You should be leeching and playing
this game!

** Points: 91 -One of the best games I've played in a while. Not 50 disks
               either.

Whahoo.. Sorry this is do late, but I had to take a road trip on sunday to 
grab some hardware, and on top of that, got hammered on saturday nite with 
about 3 40+ disk releases. Which wouldn't be so bad if the damned box would 
stay up for me to sz the shit off of it. Anyway, have fun leechin all the 
stuff I've recommended for you to leech :) I know I did.
