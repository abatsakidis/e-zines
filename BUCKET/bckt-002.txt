 With eerie in Quebec for three weeks, pretty much the whole issue was put
 together by me.  With him back and around for next issue we can look forward
 to his R.E.M. review and a whole lot more.  In the meantime, I hope you're
 satiated by skinhorse's interview with Hum's Matt Talbot and six more album
 reviews.

 Initial response has been very positive, and we hope that we can improve and
 release a quality music e'zine much into the future.

 I won't ramble.  Go for the substance.

 Interview:  Matt Talbot of Hum                            by skinhorse
 --------------------------------------------------------- --------------------

 [ Editor's note:  This interview was originally done for the Illinois
   Wesleyan _Argus_ as part of the feature article on Far Left Carnival III,
   which took place on September 7 on the Illinois Wesleyan University quad,
   featuring Hum, NIL8, Roots Rock Society, Free Range Chicken, and Busker
   Soundcheck.  Space constraints forced 1,300 words to be chopped from the
   text in the _Argus_, and dear skinhorse has happily consented for the
   entire text of the interview to be reproduced here in BUCKET.  This text,
   also available at the WESN web site (http://www.iwu.edu/~wesn), has been
   left as skinhorse initially had it, including references to what would
   have been at that time the impending Far Left Carnival III.  This in mind,
   here is the text of skinhorse's phone interview, with introduction (minus
   those points just mentioned). ]

 ... Anyone who has run into a member of Hum at some point in time (and if you
 ever go to bars in Champaign, you're sure to run into one of them) knows that
 they are local celebrities with incredible humility and modesty about their
 astounding music and success.  They can be almost self-deprecating; upon
 meeting Bryan St. Pere, my friend and I informed him that he was one of the
 most incredible drummers we've ever heard (truth), to which he responded,
 "Well, then you sure haven't heard many drummers."  Special thanks to Matt
 for agreeing to do an interview with a radio station that he knew next to
 nothing about, and for offering to help us with promotion beyond the call of
 duty of any band that has achieved such great things.

 q:  To make you reiterate something you've probably told a million
     interviewers before, can you tell me a little bit about the band's
     history?

 a:  I started the band with some guys when I was in college in '89, no big
     aspirations or anything.  We played a lot a shows around town and got
     lucky in that we found people to put out our music, even at a point where
     I didn't think we were all that good.  Eventually we wanted to play a few
     shows out of town, so we booked some shows ourselves... I don't know,
     it's been a very slow and gradual thing to the point we're at now.  I
     don't think we were ever seeking to be on a major label or anything like
     that, but when the opportunity came our way two years ago, it seemed like
     a good way to get more time to make more music and to get it out to
     people.  It seemed like a logical step for us.

 q:  And of course by that point you had already put some albums out...

 a:  Yeah, one in '91 [_Fillet Show_ on Headhunter/Cargo] and again in '93
     [_Electra 2000_ on Headhunter/Cargo], a couple singles in there, and then
     there was the astronaut record last year [_You'd Prefer an Astronaut_ on
     rca].  But we're pretty slow; I mean, for being together seven years I
     wish we had more music out, but we're not very fast songwriters.

 q:  Since you didn't aspire to be on a major label, how did that happen?

 a:  I don't want to make it sound like something we were totally against,
     like we were a big indie band; we just got lucky....  The story goes that
     this guy from RCA was in Chicago.  He went to some small record store and
     asked for new local stuff, and they had our _Electra 2000_ record in, so
     they gave him that along with five or six other Illinois bands.  The guy
     listened to our cd on the airplane ride home, and liked it, and called us
     to ask us if he could come see us play.  He came to see us play at the
     Lounge Ax [in Chicago], and then he said we could be on RCA if we wanted
     to be.  We said, "ok, we'll think about it," and about eight months
     later, we decided to do it.  We just waited until we had a chance to talk
     to some other labels and educate ourselves on what we were getting
     ourselves into...

 q:  Speaking of recording for RCA, I heard a while back that the band is
     going to start recording soon.

 a:  Yeah, we're getting to ready to record again in October.

 q:  Can you give us an idea of what you plan to accomplish with the next
     record?

 a:  We're still writing some songs, and I can't say for sure exactly what the
     record's going to sound like.  We're going to do it again with Keith
     [Cleversley, producer of _You'd Prefer an Astronaut_] at his studio.  We
     felt like we had a good experience there, and by the end of it Keith
     really liked our music and said he'd love to do another record with us.
     He'd never heard our music, seen us live, or even heard of us when we
     went in there to do the album.  It's been a long time since we did that
     record -- two years, anyway -- and we feel like we've gotten better, and
     he's called us and he thinks he's gotten better at his job too.  We feel
     like we can go in there and make a record that's not a carbon copy of the
     last one; we've got lots of different kinds of songs now.  We thought
     it'd be neat to work with the same guy two times in a row, so we can go
     in there the first day, start making music and not have to worry about
     things like where everybody's coming from, or egos, stuff like that.  It
     should be fun.  We're trying to go into it as relaxed as we can.  We've
     got ten or so songs written, and hopefully we should have some more by
     the time we get there.

 q:  Are we going to get a preview of the new songs at Far Left Carnival?

 a:  Yeah.  We've been playing ten or twelve songs in each set lately -- five
     or so from _Astronaut_, a couple from _Electra 2000_, and then three or
     four new ones.  We just wrote another one that we're enjoying playing, so
     sometimes we're playing that too....  We understand that most people
     would rather hear songs that we know, and I would too, you know, but we
     gotta make sure we play the new songs and see how they sound.

 q:  Speak for yourself; I'd rather hear new tunes too.

 a:  Yeah, I'm kinda that way.  I think it depends on what kind of music fan
     you are and how you feel about the band.

 q:  If you could burn down a fraternity house, which one would it be and why?

 a:  [laughs] Uh, I just don't have it in me to commit arson.  I just don't
     think i could do it.  I, uh, I get along fine with the members of our
     fraternal community.  I got no complaints.

 q:  You guys have accomplished a lot that most so-called national acts
     haven't been able to accomplish.  You've got a cult following as well as
     a continually growing new fan base, and yet you manage to continue
     satisfying the old fans.  You've had a massive hit single and a couple
     other big ones... what's the next step from here as you see it?

 a:  I don't know, world domination, selling out, spandex, Pepsi commercials.
     [laughs] No, I just hope that we can keep going on the same track that
     we're on, maybe reach a larger audience.  I'm finally getting comfortable
     with playing in front of a lot people; before, it kind of freaked me out,
     and now, it really doesn't bother me and it's kind of exciting to play
     bigger shows.  Hopefully we can still keep it real gradual, keep our wits
     about us.

     We're still mentally prepared with the notion that our next record might
     not have any songs that get played on the radio, that we might not reach
     any new fans, or even lose some fans.  There are no guarantees, so we
     just try to keep an open mind and try to satisfy ourselves with our
     music; whatever happens from there happens.  We do try to maintain a
     little bit of self-respect along the way if we possibly can.  It's not
     always possible.

 q:  Just on the commercial side of things, how many records has Hum sold?

 a:  I think it's around 200,000... most of those were sold all at one time,
     when "Stars" was played last summer and fall.  A guy from the label
     called me a week ago and told me it was still selling 300 or 400 copies a
     week.  we're not really getting played on the radio anymore, so I think
     that's mostly through word of mouth or something.

 q:  Why should the uninitiated listener check out Hum?

 a:  Why should he?  Man, that's a tough one.  It's hard for me to talk our
     music, the merits of it, and what's good or bad about it.  We're just
     four guys who work to write good songs and we put a lot of mental work
     into our songs, probably too much so sometimes; we kinda drive ourselves
     crazy, and I don't know sometimes that the songs turn out that great for
     having so much work put into them.  I'd just say that we put a lot of
     work and passion into what we do.  Hopefully that shows up in the music.

 q:  On a less philosophical level, what kind of musical influences make Hum
     sound like Hum?

 a:  I think it's the different elements of the band coming together.  I think
     we sound like all the different kinds of music that we all like.  We all
     listen to completely different stuff.  We're lucky we got a good drummer
     [Bryan St. Pere] who really likes Van Halen and Rush.  I'm more into
     atmospheric guitar stuff.  The other guys [guitarist Tim Lash and bassist
     Jeff Dimpsey] are into other music... at the end of the day, it sounds
     like Hum.

 q:  Do you feel like a national act or a Champaign band at heart?

 a:  Well, we feel like a Champaign band, and we hope we forever shall be...
     [laughs].  I really like where we're at, in terms of success, if you want
     to call it that.  It's a really comfortable place to be.  It hasn't
     created some kind of really weird lifestyle.  We're still the same guys,
     no new wardrobe or anything.  I just feel like we're a Champaign band
     that got really lucky; when we tour, instead of playing in front of
     twenty people, we get to play in front of four hundred, or sometimes
     4,000, and that's a fun thing to do.  It's a pretty cool place to be.

 q:  Speaking of the "Champaign scene," what do you think of its merits?

 A:  I like it here... but people, especially people who don't really know
     what they're talking about, always ask, "dude, what's up with that
     Champaign scene," and "what's that Champaign scene like?"  Well, it's a
     bunch of guys who sit around at bars or around their porch drinking beer
     and playing bad loud rock music.  It's pretty much like any other lazy
     college town. [laughs]

     Maybe, compared to some communities, it's more supportive of our kind of
     music.  I don't know that it's any different from any other college town,
     really.

 q:  It seems like there is a larger number of bands, especially quality
     bands.

 a:  Well, it's being going on down here for so long....  There are just a few
     success stories every now and then that keep people in town interested in
     it, and kids come to college here, and they see bands they like.  They
     think, "wow, this is just a Champaign band, and i can go see them at
     Mabel's or the Blind Pig, and that's pretty neat."  I mean, that's how I
     got into it.  I didn't know anything about being in a band, or that I
     would ever want to be in a band.  I didn't even really know anything
     about the kind of music that I like now.  I was just in college, and I
     met some guys, and they sat around listening to music and drinking beer,
     and then they had their own band that sucked, but they had a great time.
     [laughs]  It was kind of a cool thing.  I said, "oh, that's cool.  I
     think I'll do that for a while." [laughs]

     So I'm sure that's how lots of people start....  I will say that there
     are lots of guys who grew up here who are really good players and write
     really good songs.  A lot of the bands around here are people who are
     college students or were college students, but it seems like a [lot of
     local talent] comes out of dudes who just grew up in Urbana.  I'm not
     sure why that is.

 q:  Anything you want to say in conclusion?

 a:  We're really happy to come up [to Bloomington] and play.  It's been a
     really long time since we played there.  It's close enough to home.  We
     should do it more often.

 Archers of Loaf, _The Speed of Cattle_ (Alias)
 Archers of Loaf, _All The Nations Airports_ (Alias/Elektra)

 It seems like an odd endeavor to discover a band through a b-sides and
 rarities compilation, but then again, the Archers of Loaf don't qualify as a
 typical band.  _The Speed of Cattle_, with material originally recorded
 between July 1992 and February 1995, is a power-packed 18-track rarities
 package that features the Archers in some of their noisier moments.  People
 used to the quirky pseudo-punk of "Web In Front" from _Icky Mettle_ or
 "Underachievers March and Fight Song" from _Vee Vee_ will find a mildly
 surprising ensemble; the Archers demonstrate that not only can they write a
 slick pop song, but they can get down and dirty as well.

 "South Carolina", "What Did You Expect?", and "Quinnbeast" show the Archers
 in true guitar-rock form with a confusing groove in the background that
 makes you want to move, even when you don't know why or where it might take
 you.  "Tatyana" ably demonstrates Eric Bachmann's atypically melodic gravel
 of a voice and still keeps you on the edge of your seat.  "Telepathic
 Traffic" and "Mutes In The Steeple" go far to solidify the Archers as
 songwriters extraordinare, some of the creme de la creme in the loosely
 defined "indie-rock" scene nowadays.

 And that's all from a rarities album, so what could be expected from the
 Archers' next full-length?  Expectations are raised a little bit as Alias
 signed a distribution agreement with Elektra, sort of kind of making _All
 The Nations Airports_ a major-label debut.

 Disappointment was not to be had.  A minute into the album the Archers have
 you planted and "Strangled By the Stereo Wire".  The guitars are less noisy
 even during the more driving numbers, and the Archers spread themselves out
 with a little more piano on tracks like "Scenic Pastures" and "Chumming the
 Ocean", where the piano fuels the rest of the band.  "Assassination on
 X-mas Eve" gets you to listen oh so closer to figure out exactly what's
 going on; you've almost been so caught up in the melody to forget that
 Bachmann is singing anything.  "Vocal Shrapnel" will set you straight with
 one of the true guitar-pop gems of the year, and "Form and File" will put
 over the top that lingering thought in your mind that you're listening to a
 true classic.

 With perhaps the most original slant on the post-punk-pop world, sacrificing
 no melody for schtick, sacrificing no schtick for radio friendliness,
 sacrificing no radio friendliness for some classic guitar lines, and
 sacrificing no classic guitar lines for melody, the Archers of Loaf have
 made a truly impressive statement about modern rock 'n' roll -- with _The
 Speed of Cattle_ they've said "we're going to do whatever we want, and it's
 still going to rock", and with _All The Nations Airports_, they come back
 with "and not only are we still going to rock, we're going to do it our
 way."  Here's to the Archers' way being our way for a long, long time.

 Tool, _Aenima_ (Zoo)

 Tool's second full-length, _Aenima_, kicks your fucking ass, okay?  Tool had
 already progressed from their debut ep _opiate_ to their first full-length
 _Undertow_, growing from pseudo-heavy metal to a gloomy, grinding, slimy
 groove.  The progression of Tool has not ceased, as one good listen to
 _Aenima_ will demonstrate.  Tool has taken a slightly industrial edge; not
 implying that _Aenima_ is full of drum machines and sound effects, but
 vocalist/lyricist Maynard James Keenan has been playing with buttons and
 stumbled upon some vocal effects.  This only adds to the general discomfort
 the album spews.  Not a single track will leave you still in your chair, as
 _Aenima_ will have you squirming from the outset.  Although bassist Paul
 d'Amour has left the band due to "creative differences", replacement Justin
 Chancelor (ex-Peach) holds his own wonderfully.  Danny Carey pounds the drums
 in the same strong, melodic hypnotic rhythms that made _Undertow_ raise the
 hairs on the back of your neck.  Adam Jones has recognizably improved his
 guitar playing, and is grooving and crunching with more power than he ever
 has before.

 Keenan is still unusually obsessed with perversions of sex, murder, and pain;
 all of which are lyrically illustrated, in one form or another, in almost
 every song.  There are, however, exceptions; he tackles sell-out accusations
 in "Hooker With a Penis", his childhood in "Jimmy", and drugs in "Third Eye".
 Also included is a recipe in German for the eggs of Satan in "Die Eier Von
 Satan", and four shorter interludes interspersed throughout the album hold
 the other eleven tracks together nicely.

 The disc's packaging itself is interesting.  The CD cover is holographic,
 along with the images in the sleeve if held in front of the hologram.
 eyeballs roll, stare, and jump; shapes contort; the band watches a naked
 woman (yes, it's a woman) twist her body to, i think, stimulate oral sex on
 herself.  Maynard James Keenan and Danny Carey are also nude, which is worth
 the price of the CD all by itself.

 Also noteworthy is the band's tribute to the late Bill Hicks (12/16/61 -
 02/26/94, death from pancreatic cancer), a controversial (and in my opinion,
 brilliant) stand-up comedian in the beginning of "Third Eye", in which they
 include portions of his acts on the topic of drugs.  The CD sleeve also
 includes a painting of Bill Hicks playing doctor with, apparently, a severely
 injured Keenan.  Unfortunately, this image is not holographic.  So it goes.
 You can invent laser-guided bombs but you can't make paintings holographic.

 All in all, obviously, I love _Aenima_.  It hasn't left my CD player since
 September 30th (yeah, I got it a day early because I'm really cool, let me
 tell you - I don't even work at a radio station, people just give me free
 shit all the time because I'm the only sod in town who can get crystal meth -
 I spend all my money on used, discounted porn and jamaican lovebeads - email
 me your pets) and I don't plan on removing it any time soon.  As cliched as
 it may sound, _Aenima_ is an intense album not meant for the faint of heart
 (but, if you are faint of heart, buy it and listen to it anyway because at
 least you'll drop dead doing something constructive.)  This isn't something
 you'd go to sleep listening to.

 As keenan howls in "hooker with a penis":

 "shut up and buy, buy, buy my new record / buy, buy, buy / send more money"

 If you send me your receipt, maybe I'll send you your pets back.

 New Radiant Storm King, _Hurricane Necklace_ (Grass)

 Back in the spring of 1990, the first time I ever heard New Radiant Storm
 King, I was blown away as the feedback reverberated through the tiny
 Hampshire College venue.

 Listening to their latest release, _Hurricane Necklace_, brought that
 feeling rushing back again.  Their music has matured greatly in the past six
 years.  _Hurricane Necklace_ displays a full range of styles and techniques
 that Peyton Pinkerton (guitar) and Matt Hunter (guitar/bass) artfully
 combine.  "Embrys' Crossroads" country swoon bridges into surf rock, and
 then back to the western tinge behind the words, "I am quite shocked, 'cause
 you know I can't sleep, I am stupid, and lazy, and mortal, and weak.  No you
 don't know, you don't know."  "C/Swoon" starts out with a woozy, airy
 instrumental, then, ever so naturally, does a 180 and proceeds to tremble
 with an angry rejection, "I've got ten good reasons and you're not one of
 them."

 While _Hurricane Necklace_ shows off Storm King's ability to ease in and
 out of different moods within the same song, it never sounds choppy or
 calculated.  NRSK's trademark warbly, throbbing feedback glues the sound
 together throughout.  They even stretch that sound to new boundaries in "The
 Kind Ghost," which features Pinkerton playing with a guitar slide you can
 feel massaging your brain if you crank it up just right.

 Besides the amazing musicianship, the lyrics are thought-provoking, and
 sometimes just outright humorous, as in "Lovers in Waco" about "fucking in
 an air-raid shelter...we brush our M-16s, we made a pact with god that we
 would never retreat."

 "The Bastard Song" mixes music and lyrics to embody the feeling of driving
 home in the rain after getting screwed over, "when everything I fear seems
 to reappear, and you're just getting smaller as I drive the fuck away."

 _Hurricane Necklace_ marks some considerable changes for the band, most
 notably the loss of their powerhouse drummer, Elizabeth Sharp, who has
 moved on to Skinner Pilot.  Their new drummer, Garrett Fontes, provides
 another layer in the rich tapestry of Storm King's sound and never
 overpowers the more "thought out" sound of this album.  Storm King's
 transfer to Grass Records will allow greater distribution of _Hurricane
 Necklace_ than past albums, as well as the possible reissue of some of the
 notoriously difficult to find earlier releases.

 Silver Jews, _The Natural Bridge_ (Drag City)

 The first thing that usually gets thrown into a discussion about
 Charlottesville, Virginia's Silver Jews (in essence David C. Berman)
 is the Pavement connection.  Well, forget it on this album.  There are no
 Pavement members to be found on this thing, and it actually makes for a
 better record than their previous outing, _Starlite Walker_.  The reason for
 this improvement is cohesion.  Berman's thick voice and rootsy songs work
 much better with the arrangements he provides (and are capably delivered by)
 to his "new studio band" on this album, which is comprised of two members of
 Massachusetts heroes New Radiant Storm King.  _Starlite Walker_ was not a
 bad album, but the lack of fractured formlessness and stylistic wandering on
 _The Natural Bridge_ makes it much more accessible and pleasant.  While this
 can also be construed as "safe" record-making, it's hard to argue with the
 lilting piano on the album's opening track, "How To Rent A Room".  This song
 sets the mood for the rest of the album, and on this one much more so than
 the Jews' previous efforts, Berman's voice is allowed to shine through and
 his probing (and often cheeky) lyrics can be appreciated fully.  His theme
 of choice this time around seems to be the dissolution of relationships (not
 entirely original, but he pulls it off admirably), and he has really been
 practicing those allegorical allusions and southern gothic references to
 give this album the feel of a heartfelt "dear john/jane" rather than an
 outright dis, even with the line "I don't really want to die/ I only want to
 die in your eyes," which is delivered wryly, not scornfully.  In the
 instrumental department, "The Right To Remain Silent" is just as hypnotic as
 "Bar Scene From Star Wars" and rewards repeated listenings immensely.  And
 while the overall feel of this album never wanders much from an easy-
 listening formula, it's a positively enchanting ride that leaves a warm
 taste in your mouth and plenty of material to think about, even if some
 of it refers to seeing B. B. King on General Hospital.

 Din, _Fantastic Planet Revisited_ (Hypnotic)

 Din is my favorite band of all time.  There, I admitted my bias.  Of course,
 you've probably never heard of Din before, but that's okay.  Din's songs are
 most clearly defined as electronic trance soundtracks, and are created
 entirely by Pupka Frey.  Put simply, the songs written by Pupka are meant to
 be the soundtracks for unwritten movies or stories.  This is Din's second
 album, their first being _Decade of the Brain_.  This CD is meant to be
 filled with space horror tracks, and I think it achieves that goal pretty
 well.  On this disc Pupka moves towards a harsher, more up-tempo feel.  He
 also experiments with some new instruments, such as the organ on "Clown
 Suit".  Pupka also sings, which is a first (without a vocoder).  All this
 gives this disc more of an EBM feel, but don't be expecting Front 242 or
 Leaetherstrip.  It's just Din's special version of trance:  peppier, harder
 hitting, with more varied elements to keep it from getting redundant.  The
 standout tracks include "Stab", for its eerie vocals, "Travesty", for being
 a more evil version of Din, "I've Seen It Done", for being even more evil,
 and "Clown Suit", for the single greatest organ solo in a song with the word
 'clown' in the title.  All the rest of the tracks are very good as well, and
 I don't believe Din can make a bad song.  But that's me.  I wouldn't
 recommend this disc to you if you don't like electronic music, or if you
 dislike trance music specifically.  I would recommend this disc to anyone
 who doesn't fall into one of the above categories.

 Gee, after rereading that I now feel compelled to point out that I don't
 work for Din or BMG.

 Kaia, _Kaia_ (Candy Ass/Chainsaw)

 "Finally A Dyke Album For The Whole Family" reads the back cover of this
 record, and it could not be closer to the truth.  Kaia, the singer/
 guitarist of the highly acclaimed riot grrl band Team Dresch, has
 executed a great collection of acoustic emotion.  Her beautiful voice and
 guitar playing create wonderful songs of mistakes, break ups and
 unforgotten love.  Songs such as "16" and "Test" are perfect examples of
 the end of relationships.  Definitely recommended to the heart broken.
