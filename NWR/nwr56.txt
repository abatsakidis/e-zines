	Yes bitches, we  know  it's late.  Nd  hasn't been around and it's really 
	just not  the same without him, but we've waited long enough. Most of the
	staff is  still with us and  doing thier parts, but  some are either in a
	transition period  or just fucking lazy. We will however, do our  best to
	get out the issue with fill-in reporters and people who are up to the job
	until we can get a fulltime  crew again. If  this issue sucks, it' really
	not my fault.. it's umm.. that other guys fault.

	On a lighter note, ttol  is doing our games report  now and  hopefully in 
	the near future we will have some sort of coded mag (been saying that for
	a year) but this time it's a definite maybe! Bud was nice enough  to give
	us the missed reports from the past 3 weeks as well as  the  entire Bud's
	Biased Report Archive, and we  have a special  photo of  what sex is like
	in  the  summer in  Canada, a  jess- pic with  her  best  friend, and  an 
      interview  with  the scene's most  notorious person.. riches! Be sure  to 
      check out the video of what we're  going to do to ndetroit when he  comes 
      back.. He deserves this..

	We also need a few  people  to help out with  scene news, rumors, and any 
	special  comments or letters you  want  published here.  Unless your just
	incredibly lame or  have nothing to say, we WILL  publish  your comments,
	thoughts and  ramblings  in the mag. We also will have a  Letters  to the
	Editor section  hopefully  starting next week  as long as  you write. You
	don't have  to kiss NWR's ass (but it helps) just  have  something to say 
	that concerns  the scene  or the mag. All  submissions should be  made to
	nwr@netmonkey.org (If you want your name in NWR, this is your chance)

	Schools back in, old sites are back, new sites are up, people are making
	bail, and the scene is once again one big dysfunctional family..


     					               - Ryche [Fill-In Editor]




	Yes we are back, and so am I. It seems NWR  can't function without me (at
 	least that's what I will go on believing to make myself feel special). Nd
 	has vanished and the rest of the staff has  had other issues to maintain. 
	So Ryche and I have  come back to bring  you guys what you want. Which is 
	me. Or I mean NWR. We got alot of  different people  doing different jobs
	and maybe  they will be permanent  and maybe not. Cedric steps in  on the
 	courier report, Ttol on games and other ppl on other things.

-----------[ ndetroit's sites and stats section ]-----------


 (Note: nd is being a gimp again.. the usual stats will return
  when he pulls his head out of his ass)

 Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale..  if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site
 they get #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. 
 Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... 
 heh... fuck off and die..

------------[ Lester's Biased Courier Section ]-------------



Note: Lester is taking a week/month/year off for a while, so we are gonna 
have one  or two "guest authors" every week from now on to fill in on the
courier report. Guest's are allowed to do the report in  any style/format
that they want, with whatever ratings and graphics  system that they deem
applicable.

Guests  wishing to apply for  the position should  be an active trader in
one of  the  scene's  top groups.. (ie: someone who  knows  wtf they  are 
talking  about...  ..  heh.. although, that  never  stopped  Lester  from 
writing!!)  <g>

This week's special guest: Cedric_ of ANGELS ON DRUGS!

=------------=

Hello  fellows, here's  cedric  to the rescue to deliver  you this week's 
courier report. I'm trying to make it unbiased, but if you feel it isn't,
well  just  skip it  and go to  the  next section, I don't give a fuck ;>
By the  way, english  isn't  my native  language, so if  I make mistakes,
bear with it...


AMNESiA         : Well, umm..... what can i say there? idleness?
                 After losing their 3 active traders, there's no one left
                 to  show  on  weektops.  They   got  a  good  leadership
                 and resources, i'm sure  they can get things  going soon,
                 if  they  can  get some  good  traders, which  is, hmmmm,
                 pretty useful for a courier group :>
                 Btw, you also need to know that glen is very fat.

                 Overall: You'll do better next week ;D
                 Rating : 0/10


AOD             : I'm trying to be unbiased here, but well, that's a fact,
                 the wrecked angels dominated the week by far. They  made 
                 #1 groupweek  on most sites  with a nice  combination of
                 preing from  sins &  freakshow  and  mass  trading  from
                 Faith, sins & darkwolf, helped by gollie. As long as AOD
                 can keep things going that way, they won't have to worry.

                 Overall: Great work.
                 Rating : 9/10


DSC             : I don't know much about that group, but  all i can say is
                 that sax and prozax are doing a very good job on all sites
                 they're trading  on. They  need to get more  good  traders 
                 added on euro sites to be able to face "the big ones".

                 Overall: Growing every week, good job guys.
                 Rating : 5/10


DEVOTiON        : The usual things there, Jaydee prewhored  his normal amount
                 of megs making him #1 on most sites, helped  by silentjoe/tc
                 to complete the  pre team. Trading wise, well only  godbless
                 did his usual mass trading, but well, with  jd/tc preing and
                 gb trading, DEV will remain one of the best groups out there.

                 Overall: Nice job as usual.
                 Rating : 8.5/10


EQUALiTY        : Nothing to say here, everyone's idle.

                 Overall: ...
                 Rating : 0/10


ESPRiT          : Didn't see anyone there on any weektop.

                 Overall: Idle....
                 Rating : 0/10


RiSC            : Well, RiSC is not  yet what it used  to be, but their frog 
                 team is doing a very good showing on top sites. If they can
                 get some more traders working along with  Psed0 and  Flavor,
                 RiSC could take back a dominant place in  the courier scene.

                 Overall: Slow week, but no worries there.
                 Rating : 4/10


TFA             : Slick, Slick, Slick, and, hmmm, otherwise, i don't see 
                 anything else...

                 Overall: Get working!
                 Rating : 4/10


ViCE            : Seems like  ViCE is  really emerging like  a major force  in
                 the  actual  courier  scene,  with  a  awesome  trading  team.
                 mrp, redman, citizen, gregk and nailz brought ViCE once again
                 in the top3. They just need some pre's to surpass AOD and DEV.

                 Overall: Excellent job, keep it up guys.

|'   In lieu of  recent  events  contributing to the  breakdown  of the  now   |
|defunct S.P.A. (Software Piracy Association), a private  meeting between the  |
|key contributing and  contending groups was held.  On October  15th, 1998 an  |
|agreement and compromise was reached between the 3 attending parties, CLASS,  |
|PARADIGM and RAZOR 1911.  Let it be known that this type of compromise could  |
|not be  achieved under  the  S.P.A. environment; it  took a  clean  break to  |
|accomplish in  a day what had  previously gone  unaccomplished in  2 months.  |
|The end  result being a  new council whose sole  purpose is to set standards  |
|for  the  game-releasing subsector of  the  scene, to  be  adhered to by all  |
|admitted  parties.  Represented  members  of  this  new  council  named  THE  |
|FACTION, have  pledged to abide by the  following set of rules created a) to  |
|ensure  a quality minded  end  result  and b) to encourage  fair  play and a  |
|productive competitive environment for involved groups.                       |

|    145,766,400 bytes.  Using 2.88  megabyte archives enables us to keep the  |

|4.  Intros,  Outros and  Cut-Scenes  should be  removed  if the size of  the  |
|    release is 40  x 2.88 disks  or more with them  included.  Intros should  |
|    NOT be  iuncluded  in a  Movie Add-On,  only Cut-Scenes  and  Outro (aka  |
|    End-Scene) should be  included.  Animation files, such  as .SMKs, should  |
|    be "framed"  and  not blacked out.  Re-indexing of  large  files, should  |
|    consist  of an actual re-index instead  of just creating  a file full of  |
|    0's, (which  doesn't  change  the  actual  file size, but  allows  it to  |
|    compress to virtually nothing), thus promoting  more quality minded rips  |
|    and cracks.                                                               |
|                                                                              |
|5.  Only  2 Add-Ons should be  released per game.  Each Add-On should  be no  |
|    more than 25 x 2.88 megabyte archives.                                    |
|                                                                              |
|6.  A brief  outline  of what  has been  stripped from the  game  should  be  |
|    clearly stated in  the  game-release .NFO, as  well as information as to  |
|    whether or not Add-Ons can be expected.                                   |
|                                                                              |
|7.  Children's games (aka  Kiddie  games) and  Edutainment  software  do not  |
|    qualify under THE FACTION's guidelines for acceptable releases.           |
|                                                                              |
|8.  In regard  to games  distributed  in the  United States  that are  LATER  |
|    distributed in Europe  or vice versa under  the same or different name /  |
|    publisher.  These games  if released  AFTER another group's  release are  |
|    counted  as DUPES  unless  it can  be  proven that  there  is  a clearly  |
|    noticeable PLAYABLE  difference in the  latter release (eg. new  levels,  |
|    enhanced graphics, or other new features).                                |
|                                                                              |
|9.  Fully  cracked Update Patches  and Trainers are highly  regarded, though  |
|    they are not  the responsibility  of any group (including  that of which  |
|    released the original game.)  If 2 trainers from the same  or  different  |
|    groups are released  for 1 game, this  does NOT qualify as a dupe unless  |
|    the latter trainer provides no new features over the prior trainer.       |
|                                                                              |
|10. Admittance to  THE FACTION is  done on an   invite / vote-in basis.  The  |
|    group invitation  must be proposed  before ALL  current FACTION  member-  |
|    group representatives, and the corresponding vote must  be undertaken by  |
|    ALL FACTION  member-group  representatives.  This  council operates in a  |
|    purely  democratic  manner and  all  parties therein have upon  joining,  |
|    agreed to  follow all stated  guidelines  of this  Declaration  of Scene  |
|    Independence.  Today is not only a new dawn  in the games scene, but our  |
|    Independence Day where  differences are  at least  temporarily put aside  |
|    and our unity re-consolidated.                                            |
|                                                                              |

Paradigm  did an awesome week, and  Super Kudos(tm) to them.   Although  they
released  two  games only, and  the  rest were small stuff, it's  still good,
considering the recent busts of half their members.  I'm glad that this group
is still in the game, and still swinging the bat.  Let's just hope they don't
strike out when the ball comes whipping by....

This has been a wonderful week for Class, as they had gotten out a ton of
releases this week.  In some  of their nfos, they  state it's because the
"competition" is  dead. Is  this  a reference  to the busts?  Maybe.  Who
knows, at least what others lack, still others will followup and release.
Class get's a Super Duper Kudos(tm). Go Class!

Although Razor 1911  started  the  week  looking promising with  2 patches,
they went a little dormant for the rest of the week.  I hope with all  the
releases due out in September, they  will pick  up their fair share  of it.
Now that summer is over, everyone's back and in action.  Let's  hope Razor 
1911 gets more releases!

What went wrong with Origin?  They were  rocking  before, and now  they're
just lying dormant.  They  must be tired, from  all  the releasing before.
Like Razor 1911, I hope they grab their share of this month's releases too.
There are a lot of them due out, so expect a ton soon :)

Well Divine released a controversial addon..which  I uhm..authorized..DOH!
I thought that was allowed, you know..with  Warrior and NOViCE doing  some
other group's game's addon releases.  Well at least it was allowed on some
sites  (no, other  than the  Divine affil'd ones).  So I'm  sorry  if this
raised hell or whatever, but  it didn't seem like  the original group  was
going to release that anytime soon.  At least  we  tried to grab our share 
with two WizardWorks games!

 Bud's Biased Utils Report #32
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 A bit rushed and scaled down this week... seems NWR is back and waiting on
 me. If you missed my little IND release of all my reports to date, it's
 been included in this issue of NWR (that would be 56 if you're blind).

 Missed a week again... moved... I hate boxes... I also hate moving.

 Lets just get on with it, shall we?
  
 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 08/31/99 to 08/06/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.


 Groups: (In no particular order)

 A fair week at the PWA camp, with several plugins for SoftImage,
 followed by what could be PWA's best offering this week in
 MiniCad Vectorworks. A decent showing, although the tutors
 for Fanuc (Lathe and Mill) are basically bookware, so I won't
 credit them.

 Not a whole lot from SHOCK here, but they did manage to snag
 Norton AV 2000 away from DOD, as well as getting the newest
 PowerQuest app, SecondChance, and a little IBM title.
 Everything here is half decent, nothing spectacular however.

 A busy week from PFT, with some nice releases (CADdy 16 and company),
 some of the usual PFT fare (QuickWorks, Veritas) and several other
 decent tools. CADdy is my pick here... and apparently PFT enjoy
 grabbing a CAD app away from LND, the supplier here is listed
 as FuckyouLND - although this is a pretty common sentiment at
 times... PFT also manages to tell off Corp in the same NFO, at
 least they're all for equal oppurtunity.

 Wow, who would have expected AV stuff from DOD?!? Enough sarcasm,
 a release is a release, although DOD doesn't exactly get a whole
 lot of competition with this stuff (they did miss Norton AV 2000 for
 NT, someone must have been asleep at the switch on that one).
 Catalyst SocketTools showed up as Nuked by Request of DOD on some
 sites, not sure what happened there, if it's anything important
 I'll mention it next week, for now I just won't count it.

 You know they wanted it, badly. And they got it, although we haven't
 seen an ISO yet, which is nagging at me. Still, we see Delphi 5 Enterprise
 from the group that pretty much single handly dominates the Delphi
 development niche, and if anyone deserves it, it's FCN. Nice to see
 they went straight to the Enterprise level edition and skipped the lesser
 versions, which sometime (especially in the case of Inprise) seem to 
 be dragged out over multiple releases... FCN was also quick to cash
 in on a new crop of development tools supporting Delphi 5, expect
 many more in the weeks to come.

 so what we end up with is whatever is in shops that doesn't need much
 in the way of cracking. Two apps this time around, ummm hey, didn't
 Data Becker make that KO Boxing game Razor released?

 Undoubtably one of the busiest groups this week, Harvest pumped out some
 great tools for the art/design community, most notably with the popular video
 editing tool Speed Razor from In-Sync. They also put out a slew of decent
 3DSMAX plugins, and were the only group this week other than PWA to
 release anything for SoftImage. With XF possibly getting the odd tool in,
 it looks like the real story in the art scene in the coming months will
 be between Harvest and PWA. Sloopy job on DEI Tools 2.01 however, having
 to repack the working version after the original was broken doesn't look
 so great - if you screw up the first time, AT LEAST take the time to make
 sure you get it right the second time around. Aside from that, a nice
 looking week from the crew at Harvest.

                       ^^^ Has PRMSUX reformed under a new monikor, or does Corp 
                           have an entirely new fanclub? <g>

 Give it to FCN for the obvious reason, a great release in Delphi 5, much
 anticipated. Also kudos go out to Harvest, as well as PFT for strong
 weeks.
 
 I yanked PRM off the list this week, they're pretty much dead now... Versus,
 a group I really liked, called it quits this week, which means they'll be gone
 as well. Not planning on adding anyone currently however.

 Maybe some suprises next week... maybe not... maybe NWR will be released on time
 next week... probably not...

  Sure  he's  a  prominent  scene  member, leader  of  the #1 courier 
   group, and  former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did  you  also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated  television  show, where  he plays a  big fatass who has 
   nothing  better to do  with his time than go  to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 



Runaway Bride
Starring: Julia Roberts, Richard Gere
Rating: 3 1/2 out of 4 Stars

Well, Julia and Richard  make  their triumphant reunion, grossing  something like  38 
million dollars  on their  opening weekend. I went and saw  this with my  girlfriend, 
which is essentially  what all of you  males  ought to do, and the movie is  actually 
pretty damn good. It's got some good  comedy in it and it's all  romantic  and  sweet  
and  shit  like  that. So  you  come out the sensitive  type  guy  and next week  you 
can  make  them  go  see Blair  Witch  Project or  something  like that. But  in  all 
honesty I really liked the movie, it's better than  Notting Hill anyways.  Julia  and
Richard pair up really well and  Joan Cusack and  some of the  other supporting  cast 
add a little spice to it as well. So I recommend it to everyone as a date  film or if 
you go into those romantic comedies solo, well by all means go for it. <g>

Deep Blue Sea
Starring: Samuel L. Jackson, LL Cool J and other people
Rating: 2 out of 4 Stars(i feel generous)

Well basically  like  I had  thought  this  movie  might be  kind  of  cool, watching
people get  ripped  up by  sharks and shit, and  sure  enough  when  people die  it's
pretty  fucking  cool,  but  I  probably  watched  half  the   movie  and  slept  the 
other  half. It  has  it's  moments and  LL is cool in it, but  this movie is a  dud, 
it's  got  basically  no   story  and  the  character  development  is  shit.   You'd 
expect  some  depth  from a  Sam Jackson  character  but  he had  really  nowhere  to 
go  with  this  guy.  So  if  you  wanna  watch  the VCD, be  prepared  for  alot  of 
peoples  heads in  the  movie, but  I wouldn't  suggest  shelling  out  any  cash for 
this. Go rent any of the Jaws films and you'll feel much better.


--------

The Sixth Sense
Starring: Bruce Willis
Rating: 3 1/3 out of 4 stars

I wasn't entirely sure  how  good this movie  would be, seeing as  how it is a  Bruce 
Willis movie  and  all, but  surprisingly he isn't  bad in it and the movie  is  very 
good.  The kid  can  actually  act  which  is a  refreshing  change  from  Mr. Anakin 
Skywalker. Story goes  like  this, Mr. Willis is a child  psychologist  and this  kid 
sees dead people. Willis  has to  try to help the kid  and doesn't  know whats  wrong 
with him and  doesn't know how  to help him, etc..etc.. It has some good scary  spots 
and a little bit of comedy in it, but it's just an overall good film. 


--------------

The Astronaut's Wife
Starring: Charlize Theron, Johnny Depp
Rating: 2 1/2 Stars out of 4

Well, even though the workprint came out some 6 months  ago, I waited  for it to  hit 
theaters before  checking this out, I was  kind  of skeptical about the whole  thing, 
but I figured with  Theron and Depp it had to be  somewhat good to  land both of them 
in it. Theron is excellent  in this movie, and Depp  delivers a lukewarm performance, 
but the  movie  itself is not  exactly  original  persay  but it  has some twists and 
surprises that makes it interesting to watch. Theron's character more or less carries 
the movie  though. The  plot is  that  Depp  goes up  into space with  his buddy  and 
something happens, when he comes back he's not quite the  same, and Theron  begins to 
suspect that  he's not  her  husband  anymore. So  I'd suggest  seeing  it  either on 
video/matinee/vcd but not for 8.50 or whatever the fuck it costs now.


-------------

The 13th Warrior
Starring: Antonio Banderas
Rating: 3 out of 4 Stars

I thought  this  movie  looked  pretty  cool in the  trailers, but  I  also saw  that 
Banderas was the main star  and that wasn't exactly  a  good thing. <g>. I did  enjoy 
this movie  and it  isnt' like  your everday  movie. Hollywood doesn't make  alot  of 
midievel  movies  and  magic/knights/dragons type  shit anymore.  Generally  this  is 
because they don't know how to make them without making it stupid. Hence Dragonheart, 
but  occassionally they do good, hence Braveheart. Now 13th warrior is definately not 
Braveheart, but  it  isn't  Dragonheart  either. It's about 12  warriors  and 1  poet
(Banderas) who go North to fight demons who are ravaging a village. The fight  scenes 
are cool and it has some  jokes and whatnot in it. I enjoy this type of movie  though 
so maybe it's not as good as I thought it was <g>

------------

Mystery Men
Starring: Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Hank Azaria, William H. Macy, 
Geoffrey Rush, Pee-Wee, Greg Kinear.
Rating: 2 out of 4 Stars


Well, it's basically a  Batman spoof kind of movie. Kinear plays the superhero who  
is a sellout with endorsements on his  uniform  and shit. Stiller  leads a gang of 
rag-tag superheros who are trying to get some of the  publicity that Capt. Amazing
(Kinear) has. The  movie  more or less drags  until  Garofalo and  the rest of the 
superheroes enter. A few of the arguments and  witty exchanges  within  are pretty 
good, but  basically  other than  Garofalo, this  movie is  pretty weak. I  almost 
enjoyed Orgazmo more<g>


-----------

Now, I know  that the VCD review  is Ryche's area, but I'd  like to take a moment to 
discuss Lost Souls released by  KING-VCD. It is labeled as the new Winona Ryder film 
which has yet to be released in theaters, so I was like  wow good job guys. I go and 
watch this movie and find it to be a *TV* movie called Lost Souls which is basically 
a Haunting for TV. The movie  isn't that bad I guess for a  tv movie, but the simple 
point is they led me to believe it was  the new movie and it wasn't.  So you are now 
in the  NWR Hall of Shame for life. Thank you and good nite.

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is  usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear  people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination  of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.

Ryche's Really Biased VCD Group Report #20


Bleh.. I edited this whole fucking issue  and Im freaking tired. If you think
I'm going to do a VCD Report too your an idiot.. Wasn't anything good put out
anyway really.. Naked Man  from EViLISO is hillarious, done by  the same guys
who did Big Lebowski.. cartoon from VCD-Europe, Iron Giant.. and some crap as
usual from the other groups.. Group of the week is whatever group I'm in.. =)

One thing I do want  to address is  subtitles though. I think they suck, they 
should be  nuked and always were  until lately. It's not the fact  that there
AREN'T versions without subs, it's just that groups are too  lazy to get them
and are in a hurry. They're  also cheaper and more abundant than to hunt down
the ones WITHOUT subs.. its  group laziness.. and people  trying to win. Fuck
em..


See Lester's above comments for the KingVCD fuckup..

------------[ The Riches Interview [------------

=----------------------------------------=----------------------------------------=


Riches/Mray/Metaray is a well-known person in the scene.  Although the  situations
mentioned in the article are all in the past, we at NWR thought you'd like to hear
his thoughts and opinions on alot of the rumors and news from the past year. After
all he has been in about 50% of them..



<NWR> Ok, to get things started.. tell us  who  you are, what you do, what  kinda 
      experience you have in and with the scene, and any groups or  organizations 
      your are or were a part of.. the usual opening question..


<metaray> I've been in the scene since early 97/late 96, started out  couriering for 
          DST (the group which was in RCN for ruining some 50gb site or something :P), 
          moved on to ATOMIC/MNM for 1 day :P /EMPIRE/DMS. I've been in a few util 
          groups, the best one would probably be PNC
<metaray> also been a part of that group known as TAW :> which is really not what 
          everyone thinks =))
<metaray> oh ya, and I cracked for DNG/MTY/CORP/GPF 
<metaray> oh ya another past affil is NWR :P people never believe me .. but I was an
          original founder with novo/tdp :P


<NWR> Im glad you brought up TAW which is probably what everyone wants to hear about 
      but we'll get into that in a minute.. 

<NWR> Alot of  people  think you as  a person are anti-scene.. and from  your list of 
      ex-affils and your past history, that doesnt appear to be true.. would you care 
      to address and maybe clarify that?


<metaray> I'm not anti-scene, I never was.. my early time in the scene, I was a  LOWLY 
          courier,  I  kissed ass to  get  PRES/get on  sites/I  was the  biggest  ass 
          kisser ;) I basically just stopped kissing  peoples asses =] but the  reason 
          they think im anti-scene is because it all started with some idiot no talent 
          moron named koyote, he was leader of risciso at the time.
<metaray> I founded a channel called #releases and he was opt in it, at the time, we 
          didn't hate eachother ;) but back then.. I was NOT  security conscious...
<metaray> koyote/risc members deleted my drive, to  this day I don't know  what/how
          (backorrifice and all these other gay windows trojans weren't out then :P) 
          but it was most likely some stupid trojan that I ran, cuz like 
          most people I trusted didn't ever think of security.


<NWR> Do you know who the other members were who did it?


<metaray> Yes, one of them was Inebriate from what Koyote said. I heard  they all 
          had a good laugh in the risc channel about it =) well, I had  some good 
          laughs over eagle_1's usc box too =))
<metaray> anyways, it was because of that incident that I started leaarning about
          Security


<NWR> eagle_1's USC box?


<metaray> yea, that comes much later :P
<metaray> when I got into "hacking" (though I was 90% scriptkid) which I admit ;)


<NWR> How did you start learning? scripts, webpages, friends? or just pure 
      determination?


<metaray> well, I was good friends with helter aka blank
<metaray> and he was really into linux/coding/hacking
<metaray> he is the one who helped me learn eeverything i know ..
<metaray> he's like, really elite =]


<NWR> About what time period was this?


<metaray> hrm.. this is like a month or so after my drive getting deleted
<metaray> thats when all the takeovers started
<metaray> all the "lame" takeovers I call it
<metaray> because how I tookover most of those chans was by getting someones bot 
          password
<metaray> just because warez groups don't care (atleast then they didn't) about 
          security..
<metaray> you could take a bots nick and do like /notice some member "you don't have a
          password set"
<metaray> that was the early times :P
<metaray> I took like #ascent, #releases..
<metaray> #releases was mine though but sparc/koyote had like taken over control heh
<metaray> TAW still wasn't formed then.
<metaray> I met an old friend BARNIL, he was the one who hacked MS/ET (sites) and
          distributed all those passwords
<metaray> he also is the one who hacked the UTWENTE news server and posted ET's 
          information in the topic
<metaray> something like, WELCOME ET AS UTWENTE'S WHQ
<metaray> but no ip or anything, and it was only for a few seconds so the siteop could 
          see it, then comes that SKANK chinablue
<metaray> she gave barnil hardware to stop fucking with ET
<metaray> =)
<metaray> thats how I met that whore.


<NWR> So they didnt REALLY narc it, but put a good scare into them?


<metaray> ya
<metaray> never put an ip or anything, just the name "ET" on the news server
<metaray> ya, I can tell you lots of stuff.. now that I'm out of "hacking" or rather, 
          breaking into boxes :P I don't really care.
<metaray> and I can tell you the TRUTH about TAW... its really not what people think =]


<NWR> Ok, lets get into that.. tell us about TAW, how it started, what it stands for.. 
      and what it's REAL purpose is..


<metaray> ok, well I don't know WHO gave us the name taw..but it wasn't us, it 
          originated from one of those news sites TCA/JADED
<metaray> it all started because me and (Barnil) had really got into hacking and we 
          were taking like every warez channel there was.. but every time we took a 
          channel, we would give it back..
<metaray> me barnil and thug actually
<metaray> but thug like dropped out/went back to trading, *yawn*
<metaray> ;]
<metaray> most of the times when we would give the chans back it would be because 
          chinablue asked us too
<metaray> and barnil like kissed her ass because of the hardware she gave him before
<metaray> anyways, she came to us with her offer of hardware when we took                     
          #CIFE/#CLASS/#ISOSITES
<metaray> one day she told me
<metaray> "I got a christmas present for you"
<metaray> "I got you blankie bwound and banil all 8.4gb hds"
<metaray> "and I have an offer for you to stop taking all these channels"
<metaray> she told us to make a list of what we wanted
<metaray> ME/BLANK/BWOUND/BEN/MASTER1 (got a little, he was never really in TAW or 
          anything ..just a friend)
<metaray> the only reason blank/bwound got any is cuz me and ben took all the chans
<metaray> and we like hung out with them in #nigglets
<metaray> TAW's channel :P
<metaray> TAW was actually comprised of me and barnil
<metaray> we did it all..bwound/blank were just are friends..
<metaray> blank was skilled though but bwound is a no talent piece of trash ;)
<metaray> everyone for some reason or another, believes in this myth, the bwound myth 
          that he is some sort of hacker


<NWR> You and bwound are still friends?

<metaray> no.
<metaray> cuz I don't kiss his ass like everyone else in #nigglets
<metaray> he can't code, he never even was a scriptkid.. he's lame as shit
<metaray> he's a lackey, nothing more.
<metaray> ok about this time I met z1p
<metaray> z1p is extremely elite, he cracks for origin
<metaray> z1p got into hacking too .. so now it was me/z1p/ben
<metaray> and bw/blank were always in the backround there too
<metaray> also with that, we had lots of people who idled in #nigglets
<metaray> like TOTH, RiSE leader
<metaray> and like emplate, pyros, moomoo
<metaray> who would always post on message boards
<metaray> and always ended it with like "TAW 4 life"
<metaray> like, what a joke;) none of them ever did anything =)


<NWR> TAW groupies?


<metaray> yea, thats a good name for them.. though they were friends
<metaray> I'm just trying to say, TAW is not what everyone thinks.. someone got it right
<metaray> when they said it was a bunch of warez scene rejects
<metaray> for the most part, it is. But you have people like z1p and blank
<metaray> who are soooooooooooo elite
<metaray> heh
<metaray> you can't classify them as warez scene rejects :D


<NWR> It was more like people who wanted to do something else?


<metaray> well ya, I could get in most util groups :P i just didnt want too..


<NWR> So TAW maybe outlaws but they were'nt ANTI-warez..


<metaray> :P
<metaray> and NO, it wasn't antiwarez;)
<metaray> look at the people in our chan
<metaray> toth = RiSE leader
<metaray> r0sc0 OGN/CORP
<metaray> z1p cracker for OGN
<metaray> hrm, we had others too
<metaray> I forget, I haven't been in the chan for a while cuz bwound is such a dork


<NWR> So what made you and Ben decide to start taking #CLASS and #CIFE and the like 
      to begin with? Boredom or just for a challenge?


<metaray> Ya, it was for fun... it was just fun, something to do.. most of the chans 
          it was because we wanted to piss off either TEMP or RISCISO/EAGLE1
<metaray> and cause of the fun ;p it was just channels, it was fun
<metaray> in like every case, within a few days/hours usually, we gave it back


<NWR> And you looked at it like.. no blood, no foul?


<metaray> yes.
<metaray> except for #risciso
<metaray> we kept them longer:D
<metaray> it started to not be fun anymore though, risc would just change channels
<metaray> hehe
<metaray> like we took #ascent
<metaray> they moved to #mint
<metaray> we took #mint
<metaray> they moved to #risc99
<metaray> or something like that
<metaray> its not fun when they don't whine/try and get it back ! =p


<NWR> Why is/was RiSCiSO always so easy to take?


<metaray> they were all easy, we just took them more cuz we hate them
<metaray> a lot of the channels were taken
<metaray> because
<metaray> we were sniffing
<metaray> some ISO site
<metaray> its down now, I forget which site
<metaray> but like everyone on the site, we had their passwords
<metaray> eagle_1 = !RiSCiSO!
<metaray> what a joke =]
<metaray> and most people use the same password for everything, so we would just ident 
          on the bots
<metaray> the last time we took #risciso, me and z1p owned some usc box eagle_1 was on
<metaray> z1p owned it, and I hijacked eagle_1
<metaray> and made him op me and bwound
<metaray> eagle_1 was like
<metaray> "let this be a lesson guys, don't ever trust 14 years old and don't irc from 
          an unsecure box/screen"
<metaray> he thought i just resumed his screen, funny thing was he wasn't running screen
<metaray> we've also been on aludra.usc.edu
<metaray> thats the box he's always on now
<metaray> Ive also been on that wayne.edu box
<metaray> i sniffed it from korea
<metaray> hah
<metaray> some korean in RiSCiSO
<metaray> was logging into a .kr box to/from wayne.edu box in RiSCiSO
<metaray> I had like a whole log of me looking around the box
<metaray> looking in pussheads directory..
<metaray> seeing their stupid bot with dumnb ass ident binded to like letmein


<NWR> You've also been known to have a running fued with Karl (the RiSCiSO botmaster) 
      is that all true or just someone you like irritate when you deop his bots?


<metaray> he is such a dumb twit..
<metaray> he's like
<metaray> "risciso security"
<metaray> which is a total joke
<metaray> one of the quotes on #nigglets bots is of karl asking how to prevent someone 
          from smurfing him
<metaray> we have like tons of quotes of that stupid kid
<metaray> he's a noone, he's just really dumb/annoying ..
<metaray> sort of like a Jr. Eagle_1


<NWR> Ok, now one thing I want to get into..
<NWR> Is that you were accused of narcing, posting ips, and all that..


<metaray> ya


<NWR> And you've also accused eagle_1 of being a narc, and all those rumors..
<NWR> You wanna talk about all that? set the record straight from your side?
<NWR> The chinablue is a narc posts come to mind too..


<metaray> ya, sure
<metaray> I have NEVER narced anyone
<metaray> I have threatened too
<metaray> i threatened EVERY risciso site
<metaray> because they had called up my isp
<metaray> and got my last name an stuff, they were making up bullshit to get the
          information.
<metaray> I don't care if they do that..
<metaray> just the fact that if they keep making up shit
<metaray> my isp will start to actually log me or something
<metaray> and then they will see shit a lot worse.. heh or atleast, back then they 
          would of.
<metaray> So I told them, I pasted them all the info, and told them if they keep doing 
          that shit, I'll email everyone of the sites/schools to spa


<NWR> So they drew fist blood by calling your isp?


<metaray> ya.
<metaray> and chinablue
<metaray> I never narced her..
<metaray> she tried to narc me
<metaray> or rather, atleast scare me
<metaray> she doesn't have my full info
<metaray> she has a last name/city though
<metaray> she looked up all the last names "------" (my last name :]) in my city
<metaray> called some girl my dad works with, but she's of no relation
<metaray> saying that I hacked into her company in florida
<metaray> and that the cops would be contacting me
<metaray> heh
<metaray> that girl told my dad, he asked me about it
<metaray> and I was like.. "hacked into some company in florida?! maybe"
<metaray> hah =]
<metaray> I knew it was chinablue
<metaray> and my dad doesn't know what hacked/hacking some company means


<NWR> She just got lucky by calling all the people with your last name? Were there 
      alot of them?
<NWR> Chinablue is a bit of a social engineer eh?


<metaray> ya, there's a few
<metaray> my number isn't listed though
<metaray> i know for a fact it was her
<metaray> because the day before on irc
<metaray> she tried to threaten me
<metaray> saying she had my info
<metaray> my aunt "donna" hah,
<metaray> funny thing is
<metaray> I do have an aunt donna
<metaray> but its on my moms side
<metaray> ie: different last name
<metaray> :P
<metaray> it didn't hit me at the time
<metaray> so I was like "fuck.. wtf?@#$"
<metaray> the next day, my dad tells me about it


<NWR> Did this put a damper on things for you? or scare you a bit?


<metaray> the next day, my dad tells me about it
<metaray> scared me a bit i guess, she kept going on about her mafia connections,
          hahahahahahhahaha (this kind of took away the scare and made me laugh 
          at the little wh0re)
<metaray> and if people don't believe me, there has been like
<metaray> 5+ people on TCA who have said the same thing about her


<NWR> Weren't they all TAW or ex-TAW members though?


<metaray> nope
<metaray> former crackers in SIEGE even said it
<metaray> that she threatened them if they were to quit siege
<metaray> which is why it is believable


<NWR> Care to name some names?


<metaray> CrackZ
<metaray> I hope he doesnt get mad at me:>
<metaray> :P
<metaray> crackz is really respected in the scene.. so ;)
<metaray> there was others too
<metaray> but i forget the nicks
<metaray> they were all on TCA board
<metaray> noone else from TAW..
<metaray> everyone in taw still kisses her ass like bwound, to get more hardware


<NWR> Didn't you also take #PARADiGM at one time? Or was bwound?


<metaray> ya, I took PMD a few times.. but always gave it back within hours
<metaray> bwound never took anything, he simply got opt by us when we took a channel


<NWR> Any particular reason or just to irritate Mason?


<metaray> nah, I like mason...
<metaray> PDM has a lot of people with huge egos
<metaray> like utopia/goaman
<metaray> and again, Temp gets opt there
<metaray> so it was always fun :P


<NWR> That brings up an interesting question..
<NWR> Alot of people don't know what kind of power an IRC opper actually has..
<NWR> What can/can't someone like Temp do?


<metaray> not much really ....
<metaray> not much heh, K-line us?@# so what, we spoof another host/bring on another 
          hacked box/go on another server
<metaray> but someone like Temp has a bit more, because he has an oline on like 
          almost every server
<metaray> but still, ever since efnet took away the
<metaray> "no mass kills allowed"
<metaray> or rather, brought that rule back
<metaray> they can't really do much at all..
<metaray> and if they do we would packet the server and hold it down
<metaray> which is pretty pathetic, now that I look back ;)
<metaray> pathetic on his part too, he shouldn't care so much about a channel
<metaray> when he knows we're gonna be stupid and packet the server
<metaray> but he never cared
<metaray> nor did we
<metaray> ;>


<NWR> So how do you feel about all the recent legal issues and problems that have 
      popped up in the scene?
<NWR> Paradigm, the hacks on the govt. webpages, LucasArts/EA/Sony taking a stand..


<metaray> well, from what I've personally heard, it's all because of one greedy 
          idiot.. jlennon, but of course mine could be wrong ..
<metaray> gH is another group .. people probably think
<metaray> "WOW THESE GUYS ARE MAJORLY SKILLED"
<metaray> people in TAW like z1p/blank are 100x more skilled the people in gH
<metaray> gH is full of scriptkids
<metaray> hacking a governement server isn't hard
<metaray> you scan *.gov for the latest krad exploit
<metaray> and you're bound to find a few boxes
<metaray> then you setup a sniffer
<metaray> sniff some more
<metaray> pretty soon, you can deface a page a week and be kRAD
<metaray> its a joke =]


<NWR> Have you faced any kind of legal retribution from some of the stuff you have done 
      or been accused of doing?
<NWR> Like the "riches got busted" rumors..


<metaray> nope...no legal retribution
<metaray> all the rumors were fake..


<NWR> So do you have any advice for the "scene" on security?


<metaray> ahh
<metaray> well, I think the scene has come along way :P they're a lot more secure now,
          atleast, they no longer have the defaul op/ident binded to just ident/op
<metaray> heh
<metaray> they never really had to be secure
<metaray> they shouldn't have to, in a perfect world i gues s:P but of course you're 
          gonna have dickheads like us (TAW) HEH
<metaray> but really, i don't know... all someone has to do is hack some *.se box
<metaray> and ask to join as a shell box
<metaray> give them some shells
<metaray> and get added to the bots/sites
<metaray> they just have to watch who they trust mostly, they can secure their 
          boxes/channels/botpacks/etc.. they just have to watch who the trust 
          the most :))


<NWR> Ok, since I got you here.. one thing thats been rumored lately
<NWR> Is how easy it would be for feds to setup an efnet server and monitor our 
      channels, conversations, etc
<NWR> Is this possible.. and could you give me a scenario on how this could be done?


<metaray> they do
<metaray> irc.arpa.com
<metaray> from what i heard, arpa.com is a "fed server"
<metaray> I really believe it..i don't know if you're familiar with antionline?
<metaray> and their "hacker list"
<metaray> they were all idiots from irc, that list was mostly conf kids, they all
          were on irc/people i hung around with
<metaray> on irc.. it was all NICKS/CHANNELS
<metaray> from irc..and i had heard rumors that arpa.com was being monitored
<metaray> for a while..
<metaray> that just made me believe it more..
<metaray> how can it be done?
<metaray> very easy...... just setup a sniffer
<metaray> monitor all the traffic
<metaray> search for keywords like "illegal" "hack" etc


<NWR> Even private channels?


<metaray> ya of course
<metaray> when you set a sniffer
<metaray> it will record ALL data being sent over the server
<metaray> it doesn't matter if the channel
<metaray> is +i :P
<metaray> hehe
<metaray> or +p or whatever
<metaray> get PURENOISE (www.purenoise.com)
<metaray> thats elite
<metaray> IRC encryption
<metaray> but it only works with other users who have it.. that should be like a standard


<NWR> It only works on private chats also.. not channels


<metaray> ya
<metaray> still... better than nothing
<metaray> but i wouldn't worry of getting busted because of something i said on irc
<metaray> I would just be worried that if they are already looking into me.. then by 
          saying stupid stuff on irc.. they could just amass more and more evidence
<metaray> or, say you did some high profile hack
<metaray> like whitehouse.gov
<metaray> coming on irc and saying you hacked it.. would be stupid
<metaray> it doesn't give them the evidence they need to prosecute
<metaray> but it gives them a reason to look further..
<metaray> heh
<metaray> but against little stuff, like I always said all the boxes I hacked and 
          stuff over IRC
<metaray> cuz they dont care about some universities really .. :P
<metaray> they're not gonna open an investigation into it heh
<metaray> its really up to the universities to catch them, atleast its what i always
          thought/seen it as...
<metaray> the fbi wont make it a priority.. I'm sure they have more important stuff :P
<metaray> like catching that bin laden h0m0
<metaray> :P


<NWR> This has been a pretty long interview and we need to wrap it up, but I wanna 
      give you the chance to say hi or fuck you to whoever you want.. and any other 
      comments you want people to know.
<NWR> This is your chance to tell the scene whatever you want 


<metaray> ok one thing I wanted to get through here was that BWOUND IS NOT A BIG BAD 
          HACKER STOP KISSING HIS ASS ;) and TAW...was nothing special :P Greets to
          z1p/blank/xtr and jess :> and toddle.. Im in his cracking group but I forgot 
          the name :/ and haven't been on recently... toddle msg me @## :>


<NWR> No hugs and kisses for eagle and cb?


<metaray> Nah, they don't even deserve a fuck you


<NWR> Thanks riches! Keep doing whatever it is you do.. just please dont do it to my
      channel.

Stop the hunt for Software Piracy Rings.


*The real world  of Software Piracy  constitutes a  diverse group of people. Stop
the investigation and  criminalization  of software distribution groups and focus 
on people who make money by selling this material*



The recent 'victories' and 'important milestones' in  the fight  against Internet 
Software Piracy big software companies EA and  Sony have been clamoring all  over 
the world news might turn just a  little bleaker if  you see things from  another 
point of view.
                                                                                
The  war  on (mostly teen) software  traders  is  misdirected.  These  youths are 
being criminalized for minor offences motivated  by circumstances  brought  on by 
these software  companies  themselves, the  real  threat is  obviously ignored in 
what seems to be only a publicity stunt  to let the  shareholders and  the public 
know that the companies are doing something about this 'obvious problem.' 

Sadly the methods used are hurting the wrong people. 

The people  targeted  by this  campaign  are generally  young male  teenagers who 
make it  a sport  to get a  piece of  software fast, give it to  friends (thereby 
proving that they got it first), test  it  out to be able  to talk about it  with 
those friends, and nothing more.
 
Also  obviously  overlooked   by  the  Anti-Piracy   divisions  of  the  software
companies is that these teens do not  have the money to buy these games, even  if 
they wanted to. Add  to that the  staggering amount of  software  that comes  out 
each week and it is obvious why this kind of software copying is going on. 

Remember: a lot  of games  aren't  even WORTH  buying, so a lot of  these  people 
just get the  illegal version, try it  out, and  if they actually like the  game, 
maybe even  buy it and  reap  the benefits: Ability  to play online, Nice  manual 
and the warm feeling of having rewarded the people who made something good.

The real threat  to software companies are  other companies that structurally use 
pirated  software in office  surroundings, and software pirates who  own  huge CD 
copying plants that are able to churn out thousands of illegal CDs every day.

The problem that some of these  software pirate rings  have 'insiders' in  gaming 
companies is  completely irrelevant. Obviously  companies are free to try to weed 
out these people, but the difference in profit loss  between a game that has been 
sent  to  the  software  rings  one  day  before or  one  day after  the game was 
officially released is completely  negligable. Bulk illegal cd's are manufactured 
months after the  release  date  anyway, and these  manufacturers get their  data 
either  by  buying  the  originals  (to be able  to  color-copy  the manuals  and 
cdlabels as well)  or  by  being  way  down  the  software  distribution  ladder, 
receiving the software via-via-via, long after  these internet piracy  rings  had 
their hands on it, so procecuting people high up this ladder simply doesnt work. 

At all. 

If the  companies  think  they  can banish  software  piracy completely  they are 
living  in  a  dream world. If  they think  they can destroy the  lives of  a few 
unimportant individuals, they are right.

Last but  not  least, it is  a well-known  fact that  the _actual_ owners  of the 
intellectual property, being the  programmers, betatesters, artists  and so forth 
are only  receiving  a minute  part of  the  huge  profits these  companies make. 
Where are the extra rewards for  having produced top-games?  Why do all  the beta 
testers get minumum wage? These questions no one will answer.

We more  than  pad these  companies' pockets, so why  not send some of that money 
back to  the   programmers and  game  testers if you  really value  'intellectual 
property.'  Or, make  the  software  (programs  and music albums alike)  cheaper, 
so more people will be able to just buy something they actually like.

Rings', who actually call themselves trade and releasegroup guys, get the facts
straight)




---------------[The Scene News]----------------


All the news thats fit to print... 
and then some...



-Ah shit.. Now I have to work again, we missed alot of stuff and I damn sure as hell
 haven't kept up with what's been going on.. so off the top of my head..


-www.screnewreview.com was taken down by a TV/Web show.. Not only  is this  the truth,
 ttol confirmed it for us, but now you can watch it on the web. The  recording of the
 particular show can be found at: (This shows www.scenereview.com being attacked LIVE
 while they were ON THE AIR!!)

 http://www.pseudo.com/links/archiveplay.asp?archid=7026&archtype=vid

 You WILL need Real Player G2 to view it.. (www.real.com)
 While  ON THE AIR  at www.allgames.com  (6pm everynight) not  only did they call the 
 webhost of scenereview they also attempted to  contact Westwood studios.. apparently
 they're a slight bit  ANTI-piracy and enjoy  picking on warezers.  Scenereview  then 
 decided  that  it would be  best to remain  offline for a while, keeping  thier good 
 image and fans safe.. Be sure and call the show, contact them, and humiliate them in
 return..


-Versus is dead.. Life support no longer continued to work.


-Krazey retired while we were idle.. read his retirement letter to the scene
 included in this issue.. he will be err.. missed ;>


-RAGE, whoever they are, were, or were gonna be.. merged with AMNESiA making that

-Here's some news I stole off the web but it made me laugh..
 "StarPlay has accused  GT Interactive of  pilfering a copy of its Alley 19
 Bowling game then marketing and  distributing the game  throughout  Europe 
 under a different name through GT Interactive's German division, GT Value."
 Yeah, but can they crack and what sites do they have?!


-Newsreports all week say the NSA has a key to windows.. what a surprise..*cough*


-HF has become OGN Archive HQ.. now they need something to put in it..


-Anyone that lives in  the Toronto .CA area and would be intrested in coming  to a 
 scene Lan/Keg Party msg axi0n` on IRC. Get fucked up and pick on canadian geeks..
 Sounds like fun to me!


-We're 99% sure that ndetroit is  still alive.. reports are pouring  in about him like
 Elvis sightings.. I just hope they spell his name right on his tombstone when we kill
 him..


-Ahh, now here's a bit  of new news.. a certain  ex-number one US site has  come back..
 Same staff.. same link.. same affils (as every other site).. and a nice little archive
 of the old SiEGE stuff.. go bug them for it. :>


-And the hottest news of the week.. bizzy lost his #1 alup on LA.. ehehhehehe



-Some sites you can check out: 

 ppgr.webjump.com    : Prozac's old page!!!! a lot of good gear.. many of the older

------------[Stories from the Watercooler]--------------

Ahh yes, rumors. We all love them, even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are  about us- and these are  some of the better ones
circulating  around  this week. Email us or find us on  irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd  like entered, (your name will not be included), and  we
do not add rumors like "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion"  because 
we know that Fusion is only  having sex with Xtremist and therefore there 
is no  hard evidence of that  rumor. So, if you have real rumors, let  us
know. Let's begin!



-Rumor has it that TNO releases fake updates and older versions as new ones..
 (With keygens!)


-Rumor has it a certain previously mentioned site is making a big campaign 
 to be number one in the US and there's not much competition  to stop it..
 Beg for those pre's boys!


-Rumor has it that PARADiGM is running on fumes..


-Rumor has it that ORiGIN will fold..


-Rumor has it that several large groups are talking about setting up "scene-
 servers" and abandoning efnet..


-Rumor has it that NWR will be late next week.


-TRUE FACT: Male sperm (Y) swims faster and die sooner  than  female  sperm (X),
            because female sperm contain heavier genetic material, which  slows 
            them down but allows them to live longer.

            THEREFORE: Males  with  longer  penises tend to produce  more  male 
            offspring because  they deposit the  sperm closer to  the egg and Y 
            sperm cells win  the "sprint". Males  with shorter  penises tend to 
            have more female offspring because sperm is deposited further  from 
            the egg, Y sperm die off thus allowing X sperm to win the "marathon".

            CONCLUSION: Look at your family. This tells you whether or not your
            father had a big cock.
