Well, we took a few weeks off, and much has happened, the longest 
living and most revered group in the scene, faced a major setback
this past week. I don't intend to focus too much on it right now,
as details and final results are not 100%. But suffice to say,
it is a sad week for the scene as a whole. If things go the way
that they are expected to go, and we all hope they don't, then
NWR will be doing a special tribute to this group and it's
unforgettable legacy.

Also in this issue we have an interesting log of Devotion
getting grips on the WLW cheating script, and well, the log
speaks for itself. We also finally have games and utils. <g>
No stats though, just be glad we released at all. Just get
CWS or EUCR for your weektopping needs. We are also including
our first Monthly ISO utils report. We did the weekly thing
for awhile, and now it's been a month, it'll probably remain
a monthly deal we think. The author does not appear to have the
time for a weekly report. Anyways, I hope you like the mag. <g>

 OMG YET ANOTHER GAMES REPORT ISSUE #4
 -------------------------------------

 Note: This report is best viewed in DOS Editor, AcidDraw, some other
       good ASCII editor, or on the chest of a Playboy Bunny.

 What the?!?
 I'm back again! And again it's at the last minute!
 Well thanks guys... maybe just once I could get some advanced notice???
 Please???

 Lots of fun in the games scene over the past few weeks... while the titles
 were few and far between, groups kept interest up by making asses of
 themselves, thus amusing their fans and keeping everything running smoothly.
 After all, we couldn't have a week where the releases spoke for themselves,
 now could we?

                                                        - The Preacher Kane

 The Points:
 -----------

 * Games will be scored on a scale of 0 to 5, points being awarded according
   to the quality of the title. And not just quality by name - after all,
   an anticipated "blockbuster" can suck as badly as the worst budget
   schlock.

 * A fix will result in a loss of .5 (one half) of a point. If the fix
   is released by a group other than that which released the game, they
   will earn the extra point.

 * Addons such as Movies and Music will earn between 1 and 2 points,
   depending on the title AND whether or not they actually ENHANCE the
   gaming experience. Addons released by groups other than the group
   who originally released the game will not be considered. Addons of
   essential features (IE Textures, 3DFX, stuff that should not have
   been ripped to begin with) will result in the loss of 1 point. Which
   means certain titles can earn points even if some people consider them
   "rapes" - I'm on a modem after all!

 * Retail addons will recieve a score of between 1 and 4 points if they
   are developed by the original developers of the game, or are officially
   licensed. Unofficial addons will not be considered. Standalone addon
   packs are always preferable to a standard addon release. If a group
   releases an addon which is later released as a standalone, only
   the standalone will recieve points.

 * Update patches and trainers will earn 1 point each provided they
   are fully working. A trainer released by a group after an existing
   trainer has already been made available in an earlier release will
   only be considered if it offers something NEW, otherwise it will be
   considered a DUPE.

 * Cheat codes will be worth .5 (one half) of a point. Since updates and
   trainers take more skill to produce, simple cheat codes cannot be
   assigned an equal value.

 * A DUPE of a game will result in the loss of 1 point, with the
   following exception: A game that was lost during a race between two
   groups will not result in the loss of any points (we do need some
   competition in the scene!).

 * Repackaging of a game will result in the loss of .5 (one half) of a point.

 * Non-English games will not be considered. Sorry, I only speak one
   language.

 * I retain the right to bend the rules any way I see fit!


 * DATES *

 This time around I'm including all the releases since my last report - 01/11/00 thru
 to 02/08/00. Or something like that.

 Comments:

 Class was without a doubt the busiest group of the past few weeks, but
 they really had to stretch to keep it that way - it seems CLS isn't
 against doing 10$ Jewel Case titles just to keep the pace going. Which
 would be fine if they didn't screw up a few of the good titles they did,
 and watch a decent sounding golf game go out under MiniMe.

 The Good:
 
 Class kept busy during a dull period, and scored some interesting titles.
 Stephen King's F-13 was anticipated not because it's a great game (kinda
 sucks, it's three little games in one) but becase it features a new, never
 before published novella from the master of the macabre, Stephen King himself.
 Nice to see that CLS was smart enough to leave the story in. As for the three
 games, Whack-A-Zombie (think of the Whack-A-Mole game at Chuck-E-Cheese) is the
 most amusing (I got up to level 33 before tiring of it) although feeding cows
 to flesh eating fish is pretty amusing for about five minutes.
 Class also managed to secure the lastest title from Talonsoft, Rising Sun,
 so all the war buffs can get their monthly fix. And a holiday edition of
 Sim City 3000, but only bother with that if you're a sim buff.

 The Bad:
 The Sims. First, CLS/FLT put out the Multilingual version, which is going to
 cause compatibility problems when it comes time for updates. And of course
 any trainers made for the game won't work with the US edition of the program.
 Not only that, the word "RAPE" quickly came up after CLS released the title, 
 as almost ALL sounds were removed from the game. Class claimed only ambient
 sounds were removed, and cited precedent (OGN and others have done this in 
 the past) as justifacation for doing so. Gamers say that practically every
 sound is gone, even the mouse click sounds in the menu screen.

 CLS put out both a sound and music addon. Since no one has come up with a
 better rip (Precise tried, but do you REALLY want to leave a title like this
 in the hands of Precise???) I've given them one point for the game and one
 point for each addon. Bottom line, CLS got sloppy - the addon wasn't that
 big, and the full game was only 37 disks - so they could have EASILY left
 more in it.

 Mahjongg Madness is a 10$ jewel case game, but it's legit. Did I mention
 it sucks though?

 The Ugly:
 Aside from the Sims, CLS did a rather PATHETIC fuckup with Demise. First, the
 install notes were butchered. Now, most people can muddle through a game install,
 but lets face it, we're dealing with people around the world here. Not every
 user is going to be proficient in English, so make the bloody directions
 SIMPLE AND EASY TO FOLLOW.

 Next point. CLS fucks up a disk. No problem, disk fix, right? Oh no... instead,
 CLS slips in an extra disk over an HOUR after the release has been spread. Meaning
 no one notices, the final disk doesn't get spread well, and people wind up having a
 hard time getting a working copy. Plus the NFO is fucked. PLUS The Sims NFO was
 fucked as well. Ok CLS... the disk limit is only 50. If you can't count that
 high, there's something really wrong. Stop releasing until you get packers who
 can COUNT.

 You can see my final thoughts regarding CLS at the end of the report.

 Comments: 

 Divine saved me some work by doing only two trainers and a patch.

 The Good: 
 Some action, with two money trainers and a decent patch.

 The Bad: 
 The Sims money trainer will not work on the US store copy of The Sims, but
 this is the fault of FLT/CLS, since they put out the Multilanguage copy,
 which is what the trainer is based on. So if you have a legit copy of The
 Sims, skip the trainer, at least if you're in the US or Canada.

 The Ugly:
 Nothing

 Comments: 

 Although having a slow year, OGN did manage to pick up three titles, but
 the did miss out on a few titles their UK team should have had.

 The Good: 
 Some games. The Iron Plague addon for TA:K is probably the best... otherwise
 it's budget racing with a twist or Limey junk.

 The Bad: 
 Lost on a few titles they should have had. Is their UK team experiencing some
 more competition, or were they just lazy?

 The Ugly: 
 Nothing

 Comments:

 If Paradigm wants to make snide NFO comments about other groups, they
 should release some games people want to play - otherwise, no one's going
 to see them. Bashing about quality in a game like Aztec Empire is sticking
 your foot in your mouth - but PDM seems to have a pretty wide mouth, considering
 they've got about two dozen feet crammed in there by now.

 The Good:
 Nothing much.

 The Bad:
 Titles released just aren't good enough to support their egos.

 The Ugly:
 At least they haven't repeated the LeMans fuckup yet.

 Comments:

 I'll review them as long as they keep releasing, but I'll never use another
 Precise release. Lets face it, the only thing more fitting right now would be
 if TKLP or JDA joined the group and they hex-edited some betas.

 The Good:
 Even with a ton of fuckups, it was the most successful period for Precise
 so far. And they seem to have a trainer maker now, so maybe it's a sign
 of improvement.

 The Bad:
 The trainer maker decided to train Speedy Eggbert - an Egames.com title
 which is so pathetic I won't even give the trainer points.

 They also don't seem to comprehend why Flight Sim addons aren't ripped,
 and, not understanding this, went ahead and ripped a lame, unofficial
 addon anyways, which absolutely no one will use.

 The Ugly:
 The Sims - so far there's not much indication either way about the
 Precise rip. So why am I docking it points? CLS fucked up, but even
 with the sound addon their release was just about within the limit.
 Precise, however, wanting a claim to fame (other than being the ROR
 for the new Millenium) rushed out a crack they simply "borrowed" from
 elsewhere. Plus, most people already had the CLS release, and not
 many sites nuked it. Precise simply doesn't have the power to play
 these sort of games.

 Comments:

 Razor did their second game of the century!!!!

 The Good:
 Boa Bite 3D - a centipede rip off. Ok, I can play a similar game on
 the LED of my cell phone, but it's still a title, and better than
 some other crud of late.

 The Bad:
 A beta patch - but I gave them credit, since it works fine as has
 several fixes.

 Word has it Boa Bite can be carded for download. This suprised some
 RZR members. But they say the game came on CD, and pointed out that
 some gimp football game CLS released can also be carded for download. 
 Who cares... you card card MS Word online for download, pretty soon
 you'll be carding everything for download.

 The Ugly:
 Nothing

 Comments:

 Hey, Scar rocked out three games! Word is they have more coming.

 The Good:
 Puzzle Bobble is cool... but I'm more of a Bust A Move fan.

 The Bad:
 Puzzle games, puzzle games, and more puzzle games. Maybe something
 different soon?

 The Ugly:
 Nothing.

 Top 3 Releases This Report:

 TA:K - Iron Plague (OGN)
 The Sims (CLS/PCS)
 Stephen King's F-13 (CLS)

 Springerish Final Thought:

 Class had better make up its mind. Since the dawn of the new century, its
 struggled between putting out some good games, and rushing out shit unchecked.
 I don't mind the budget - some people will want Mahjongg Madness, I'm sure - 
 but for a group that, on paper, is #1, Class is sure fucking things up a lot
 and making life hard for themselves. CLS would dominate without question
 if they put more work into quality control. Come one, guys, lets not go
 back to a year or two ago.

 If you want a quick package to pass the time, grab F-13 (or if you wanna
 read, since the novella included is pretty cool). If you're looking for
 a better gaming experience, well, Maxis knows what makes a success, so
 try the Sims.

-----------[ Bud's Biased Utils Section ]-----------

 
=---------ISO utils by NWR Staff--------------------------=



. This covers 01/12/00 - 01/1800
Our 3rd week of the iso utils rep Bud's Biased Utils Report #47
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Another major shakeup in the scene... people running around like chickens
 with their heads cut off. Certain people would like to claim that this
 is basically CyberStrike Part 2. Sorry, but I have to disagree. CyberStrike
 was widespread, but targeted mainly at BBS operators. The recent bust
 focused more on the supply chain and organizational end of things.

 But is there a reason to fear? Maybe, but no more so then there already
 was. If you were on a certain Quebec based site, I suggest you format and
 fill over multiple times. Or try a DOD-level wipe delete. Otherwise,
 simply don't do anything overly stupid.

 If you think I'm being cryptic here, well, I am. I really don't think
 we need to help the feds anymore than we already have. We give them
 site names, group names, member names, etc., through websites, NFO
 files and public IRC chats. If you don't think those have helped
 in the information gathering process, think again, and read some of
 the press on the recent incident, where scene pages are referred to
 (admittedly, rather vaguely, but still referred to).

 I had considered landing an interview, or doing some sort of special
 feature on the recent "events" as I've been referring to them as. Instead,
 I will simply convey my sympathy and regret to those involved, it's sad
 to see these things happen, yet they always will. I hope the group in
 distress in this case bounces back, and I wish all of its members well.

 That said, I'm going to shut up about it entirely, at least publiclly.
 Some of the people invovled still may have a chance to clear their
 names, however much of a longshot it may be.

 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 02/01/00 to 02/07/00. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.

 PIRATES WITH ATTITUDE:

 Releases: 

 Best.Case.Bankruptcy.v8.0-PWA
 Rational.Clear.Case.v4.0-PWA

 PWA put out two apps early in the week, both quality titles, Rational's Clear
 Case 4 a little more anticipated. However, they admittedly took the 4.0 license
 from MFD... I wonder if MFD knows this.

 The SHK team put out a fairly wide mix of apps, from development tools
 (QBIIF, Web Survey, Comm Objects) to Enterprise level apps (Bluestone XML
 Server, Resonate Central Dispatch) to a user-friendly graphics suite
 (Arcsoft PhotoStudio 2000), but nothing from the week really stands out
 as a killer title. However, still a strong week from SHOCK, especially
 with the Resonate app retailing at 12K (BTW: NOT WORTH IT!).

 Releases:

 QARun.4.6.307-PFT
 Sniffer.Pro.3.5-PFT

 Nothing much major from PFT, certainly nothing we haven't seen
 before. The interesting thing here is Sniffer Pro, as a certain
 PFT member was very vocal in the past about having this app nuked,
 since it is easily obtained. Oh well, when the megs are on your 
 side... as far as I'm concerned it's legit so I'll leave it at
 that.

 this app, but should I ever need to record any observations on
 meteors, I'll be sure to use it.

 TEKSOFT.PROCAM2000.SUITE.V17.0-SCuM

 Procam 2000 is quite possibly the app of the week, and
 is one of the most anticipated CAM tools of late. This
 release basically carries what was otherwise a fairly slow
 week from SCUM, and grabs more points than any other single
 app.

 HARVEST:

 Releases: 

 STAGETOOLS.MOVINGPICTURE-HARVEST
 STAGETOOLS.ONSTAGE-HARVEST
 ULTIMATTE.V2.04.FOR.PREMIERE.5.1-HARVEST

 Nothing much special in two standalone apps and one plugin from Harvest, 
 with the Stagetools apps appealing only to video/film producers and
 directors. Onstage is a visualization tool (think storyboard, but a bit
 more intricate) while MovingPicture allows pan and zoom on hi-res images.
 Pretty specialized but interesting, even for amateur filmmakers.

 I said earlier that Procam 2000 was the release of the week. That honor
 should have gone to Unigraphics 16 - except that it needed a fix. I'm
 docking RiSE a point for carelessness on this - sorry, Sins, but despite
 your feelings, that license never should have made it out the door.

 To explain it briefly, RiSE claimed in their Uni 16 NFO that the rel was
 the first 100% crack for Unigraphics, with all modules available. The
 problem is was that it didn't work - when the license was compiled, the
 cracker's clock was set to year 2001 (to test for exp.) - and he forgot
 to turn it back. Thus a ton of features were screwed for people who
 tried to use that license, saying that they weren't enabled yet, since
 the license started in year 2001 and it's only 2000.

 A fix isn't a big deal, but it's the testing problem here - I know RiSE
 tested this license well, but then they compiled a final version - and THAT
 SHOULD have been tested. Always test the copy that goes to the public guys,
 even if earlier cracks or licenses work 100%, it's the final copy that
 counts the most.

 Despite this RiSE wins the week, as everyone else was idle or just not
 impressive enough to really beat RiSE for the week.

 I don't knit, and I hate Microsoft. So lets face it, this won't be a great
 week for Corpgods. Ok, I know that embroidery software can be expensive
 (we're talking in the thousands here) but how many warez users are ever
 going to use that? In the past year I've had ONE request for an
 embroidery app, and I get a lot of requests. 

 As for Windows... my next OS will be Linux. Bill can cram it. Win2K
 isn't even in stores yet and already has an official bug/security patch
 from M$, so who the hell knows what Millenium is going to look like.
 Enjoy the baby-MS's Bill.

 has seen Machv, let me know. I also broke a promise to a few people. I said
 once I removed a group (which I've done with PROS now) I'd include Arsenic.
 However, due to time constraints I wasn't able to do that this week. They
 will, however, be in the next report.

 Now the next issue. This is a utils report, not a rumor rag, although it may
 seem like one at times. So I won't comment on the bust, nor will I comment
 on the CORP situation, save to say this - the only people who have any right
 to bring back Corp are some of the original founders - Uncle John, or DavNGol,
 you get the picture. The releases going out under Corp now are fine as releases,
 but should never have had the Corp label on them. A lot of you know who is
 behind the CORP rels, if you don't, well as I said... this isn't a rumor
 rag.

 Oh and to add to that, while I will review Corpgods I won't review Corp again
 unless those involved honestly have claim to the monikor.

 What else can we dredge up this week. Well more crap in the games scene, what
 else is new. I got to edit TPK's gaming report (note: I don't even edit my
 own report! (well, not much) so why he had me do it is beyond me) and it
 seems like a soap opera... this whole week seems like a soap opera in fact, 
 so I'm very glad to be free of it.

 Rise wins the week, and Scum can lay claim to a nice rel, those two CAD/CAM
 tools stood out as the best of the week, not much else... yawn.

 It's 1am. We're officially late again! Oh, and you can blame me for the last
 week or two, so my apologies to everyone.

=---------------Monthly Iso Utils Review------------------------=


Well we finally come to our monthly report on the iso utils scene at the end of January.
It's been an interesting month, with the newcomer Rise on the iso scene, and we even saw
DOD enter into the mix a little bit. Alot of mistakes and fixes throughout the month
though, so hopefully next month will prove better. But let's take a look at
January in review.

*NOTE*: This list was made by dupechecking on some good sites, so some dates may be off 
or possibly a release missed, if we miss anything, please email nwr@netmonkey.org with
your release list at the end of the month to help us properly catalog and review your
group each month. Thank you.

Well, Rise has a solid beginning and a solid end to the month, but
they had a pretty quiet middle of the month which hurt their totals
for the month. In their first full month of existance they have
followed suit to Rise 0day, focusing primarily on the cad/cam field,
though they did grab a few more mainstream apps in Netobjects fusion
and the Rational product line. The only real problem this month
was the release of Inventor, it appears this program only works if 
it is a first time install on your system, so some people were not
having much luck making it work. Rise has said they are working to
fix this problem, and that at least shows some integrity. They fixed
another groups mistake in Staad Pro as well. Though the release was from
a few months back, it is still nice to see some notice to the end-user.
Rise also managed to one-up the once dominant TFL with the release of 
Jobboss 5.0, the day after TFL released 4.2X. Rise will obviously
get the credit on this rls instead of TFL.

The top titles of the month for Rise are easily seen as
Multigen Creator, Netobjects Fusion, Catia 5R3, Jobboss 5.0, and
Euclid Quantum.

Alphacam is an honorable mention as well.

TFL started the month out slow, and gained momentum throughout
the month. Sticking to what they are good at they focus
almost completely on the cad/cam field. A few glitches
on their record this month are the releases of Jobboss,
which was mentioned in Rise's review, and the Primavera project
planner release which was from 1997. Otherwise, a very nice 
month for TFL. Most notably grabbing the new Icem CFD, HPADS
and Solidmaster 9.00J. They did not have to fix any mistakes
in cracks this month, so a very good job to them for that.

Top releases: Solidmaster 9, Icem CFD, HPADS 1.3

Risciso doesn't have a big month, but they do get a decent
# of apps out, the start of the month was the new MS kits, which
is nothing special to brag about, but then they landed a couple
store apps in the Quickbooks pro and Sigmaplot 5. Powerbuilder
7.0.1 update was a nice pickup for them as well. The L&H line
is a nice thing for voice recognition typing, but not
a big time target for the majority of the scene. 

Top releases: Powerbuilder and Quickbooks Pro 2k.

PSF, also does not have a huge month, but they have a decent month indeed.
Most notably ar the releases of Cold fusion server and Ulead Photoimpact.
The Dialogic suite was a nice release, but why the 2nd release with the SDK
is unknown to me. They dabble their hand in the cad field a little bit as
well with WysiWyg, which isn't exactly top of the line cad, but still
in the field. PSF has the ability to land some really good titles, but
they aren't keeping up in the total number of titles throughout the month.

Well, icoiso started the month off with 4 titles in 2 days, and then goes completely
idle until the 27th. Not that they landed any real impressive apps this month.
The study bible is the biggest joke of the bunch, but they did manage to
pickup Home office 2000 which is not bad if you refuse to use MS products <g>

than that was really quiet throughout the month, Javlin enterprise
is a nice title, but still only 2 releases.

PFT blows up in the middle of the month with 6 titles in 2
days, and then goes back into idleness for the rest of the 
month. They don't really attempt to compete on the #1 spot
in the iso side, just releasing when they have them.
Best app here is the SAP R3 GUI, the rest is Oracle stuff.

Top Releases: Sap

Total Releases: 6

Overall: 4/10


--------------

Every month I will be rating in my personal opinion, the top 10 releases of the month.

These are also in no particular order.

--------------

1. MULTIGEN.CREATOR.V2.3.ISO-RiSE
2. CADMAX.SOLIDMASTER.V9.00J-TFL
3. CADKEY99.Release.1-SHOCKiSO
4. JOBBOSS.V5.0.FINAL.ISO-RiSE
5. DASSAULT.SYSTEMS.CATIA.5R3.FULL.SET.ISO-RiSE
6. MATRA.DATAVISION.EUCLID.QUANTUM.V2.0D.ISO-RiSE
7. ICEM.CFD.V4.0.7-TFL
8. Intuit_Quickbooks_PRO_2000-RiSCiSO
9. NETOBJECTS.FUSION.V5.0.ISO-RiSE
10. Allaire.Cold.Fusion.Server.v4.5.Wintel-PSF

Again, those are in no particular order. I would have too much
trouble trying to decide which was supposed to be where in the top 10.

-------

Well the month of January goes to Rise by a landslide. TFL kept it real close
and probably would have tied for the lead if not for the Jobboss scenario.
Rise getting the points and TFL not getting any for that cost them the month
I think. Both groups had very good months and we'll see how next month goes.
Congrats to Rise and to all the groups for a fairly clean month without
alot of nukes.

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 


Scream 3
Starring: Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Parker Posey, etc.
Rating: 4 out of 4 stars

Well, I can't say too much, or it would ruin it for you who have not seen
it, but suffice to say, this film far surpasses that of the 2nd sequel,
it is utterly hilarious and has some excellent casting choices as well
as cameo appearances. It is a great way to end the series that brought
back the slasher flick genre. Surprising that it is as good as it 
was, since this one is written by the guy who did Arlington Road,
instead of Kevin Willliamson who penned the first two. But he does
an excellent job.

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is  usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear  people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination  of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.

-----------[The Scene News]-----------

All the news thats fit to print... 
and then some...

New util group called trinity is starting.

Doobie says i should say good shit about FL too.

Some major guy got popped this week :(

My Penis is on fire.

A certain news page that is members only, is run by a few
people that need to learn not to censor posts that they feel
are not representing them in a proper fashion. The person who
submitted our cheating.log to NWR, posted also on this webpage,
and it was edited by one of the "moderators" and then the topic
was closed, all because that certain moderator(his nick is 2 letters),
didn't like the fact that he said he wanted to use it to cheat.
We here at NWR feel this information should be made available to the 
public, so come here instead of a biased censored webpage for
all your scandalous needs.



--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors, we all love them even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us. And these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, your name will not be included, but we
do not add rumors like that say "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion"
because we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore
there is no hard evidence of that rumor, so if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!

Rumor is that a dynasty will be ending very soon.

Well friends.. Thats about it. If you've read this far, we sincerly thank you.
We like to know this thing gets read, so if you get the time, drop one of us
a quick msg, and tell us what you think, give us suggestions, tell us it sucks,
or just say "hi" to us!....
