   Oh my goodness. When Ndetroit is gone, NWR is actually done on time. 
Time to stop waiting for his punk ass to release me thinks. Maybe the issue 
will suck though, who knows, and when you get right down to it, who the 
fuck cares. We got all our usual shit, and since I'm writing this on 
Monday, I can't say whether or not we have any cool stuff or not cuz I 
haven't read anyone elses shit. I will tell you my shit is nothing 
special though <g> Anyways, Nd has yet to visit me here in Cali so 
I can't make fun of him in this issue, next issue though I promise!

   Intro update: ND never visited me as I couldn't stay up till
5am waiting to goto breakfast with him. So that sucks and I'll
just make up shit for the story about him<g>. We have no
utils report this week, Bud was working some OT at the strip
club. Ryche does a special report and doesn't review the VCD
scene. We also have a change of NWR policy, please read the
special letter from the editors and also a potential new 
section that reviews the cracking scene by none other than 
krakhed koka(english help from Sketch). <g> We also have the return
of one of the greatest steeds of trading to NWR! The jesspic is back!

Biased Courier Report

Well, it's me again guys. I am stuck in this god damn cycle.


AOD: Well with Tirre back and Faith pretty active, as well as the mass 
pre'ing that is turning AOD into another Prevotion. AOD is giving Dev a real 
run for their money, if TC and the pft mania die down, AOD is #1. And since 
their people are actually trading as well as pre'ing, I still say they are 
#1 right now. Heard some rumblings of unhappiness and shell trouble though, 
so hopefully they can settle all that.

Devotion: Well TC pre'd like 1.4 gigs or something on his own last week, so Dev 
defaults to #1 on most scorecards, Garoto and the ex-siege prewhores have 
been pre'ing around PWA rlses to sites and continuing the trend of mass pre, 
but no real trading of any kind from this crew with Godbless inactive. 

Amnesia: Bizzybone came up with a huge week pulling down some big numbers, 
and Psych/Sins did their pre'ing and trading, giving AMN a comfortable 
#3 on most sites. They don't yet compete against aod/dev and the mass 
pre'ing, but they keep picking up old school traders, if they ever trade 
it should be interesting, picked up Devan from Risc, Smooth, and Zeus21. 
Also HOX joined as CHQ. As well as E coming in as WHQ.

Vice: Well soon to be "Out of SerVICE" it seems, alot of complaints about 
lack of shells and childish antics. They still have a decent team, but the 
meggage is not there in europe without Mrp going full steam. The US team of 
skimp/blitz is still a formiddable force, but all that does is piss off 
Risc who thinks they own US..<g> This group is pretty much the same boat 
DMS was before the split.

Risc: Brain seems to be really pushing back into activity and pushing to make 
XDR a top notch site again, whether or not he can is yet to be seen. But the 
effort is at least admirable. The loss of Devan doesn't help things much as 
they aren't exactly overflowing with couriers, but at least they have 1 guy 
pushing to make Risc do something in Brain.

EQL: Blink continues to try to give EQL some credibility on sites, and a few 
other EQL peops are popping up here and there, will we finally see a little 
stability from this group?

RTS: Wow, I don't think I ever reviewed these guys. (Hi Ord and Ninja!). 
Kruzin moves over to RTS and so if he is trading and Krs-one is active they 
will have some showings on sites, but RTS lacks any real euro resources at 
the moment so they will compete against Vice on the US field it seems.

THD: Hi Sketchie poo:)



Welp folks, another week goes by and I'm still doing this shit. Enjoy !

---------- [ A letter from the Editor ] -------------
	Well folks, this has been a long time coming, and I think it's time 
we changed our policy around here with NWR. Couple major issues will be 
changing, in the site rankings for the courier stats we will no longer be 
listing the full site name or even the complete abbreviation. We feel that 
if you don't know what the site is, you should not know what the site is. 
NWR is here to offer information and entertainment to the scene, not to 
be a source for the people we wish to stay away from. We are also removing 
any and all web page endorsements, minus Prozac's page in respect for his
contribution past and present to NWR, and the porn advertisement, since 
we all love porn. We advise and suggest that everyone avoid using the 
message bases and overtly public methods of discussion on these webpages. 
It is in no way meant as disrespect to the hosts of the pages that we were 
supporting and many are our friends. It is simply becoming far too open and 
dangerous to have every detail of the scene being displayed for anyone. 
Now you might be saying, wasn't NWR working on a webpage? Yes we were, and 
still are. Our webpage will still go up as planned, we will no longer have 
a daily news section and if we have a webboard at all, it will be ipchecking 
and user/pw enforced. Just like a BBS, if you deserve to be in there talking 
about shit, then you will get in there. If you don't, then you won't. As 
far as group moves and site changes and news. We will do our best to 
abbreviate any and all site names in any important news that is addressed 
to the scene. No siteops will be mentioned or addressed (please remember 
that mistakes will happen). We do however allow Bud, Ryche and Blitz to 
do their report as they see fit, any information in those reports are 
entirely up to their judgement if they feel the entire scene should 
read it. Obviously as the above statement shows, we will still be listing 
who released what and the scores/etc of that. NWR is still going to be 
bringing you the same things that we always did, we will simply be a little 
more mindful of small things that are not necessary to the magazine and 
simply offer more information than we would like to give. I would like to 
thank everyone for reading NWR over the past year and for all the support 
that has been given, we look forward to continuing to bring you NWR for as 
long as you all like to read it. Ok, enjoy the magazine and look forward 
to Issue 53 as the big retrospective and anniversary issue(yes I know it 
should have been 52, but ND is out of town.)

THE BLITZ REPORT FOR THE WEEK OF 06/14/99 - 06/21/99
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 [NOTE FROM BLITZ - This was ready last week, and should have been 
included, but as we all know our editors ndetroit and Lester are morons.]

 Seems we can't just have a regular week of releasing without controversy. 
This was certianly not the best week in history, but damn we had some huge 
games come out. Origin USA (or so they say) continues to show off their 
newfound skills, and want you all to know about it. Class might go the 
way of Siege without China Blue. Lots of action, let's start the report 
with our weekly roundup of releases.

 \______/   \____|_/\___   /___/___/   /
--------|___|---------/____\------/____\-

 No dropoff from last week, Origin has their biggest week ever with four 
games and a huge title in Dungeon Keeper 2. Summer isn't supposed to be 
the best time of the year for games, but Bullfrog follows up their hit 
from a few years ago with the sequal. This one looks like a sure-burn.
Two addons are probably musts for those of you without burners, a game 
like this deserves to be played in full glory. The intro movie on the 
ISO was worth it alone. Breakneck and Peacemaker are a pair of lesser 
games, but still excellent titles that would have got more attention in 
a slower week. Rich Diamond is crappy, but a game. Unzip it sometime in 
the next month. Total Annihilation... man. Well first of all this one 
came out 2 hours after the Razor version beat out TPC. Now, Origin claims 
Razor raped this game. With a word like rape, you would expect there to 
be some serious damage to the game. Well you can judge for yourself. I've 
included copies of the before and after jpg's from the backgrounds. 
There's a minimal difference. Even assuming that you don't agree with the 
majority and feel Razor's rip is bad... Origin lost to TPC by 2 hours. 
Either way Origin's late release was lame. What's lamer is cutting down 
Beowulf in the nfo. Origin could have had a week to remember, now all 
they will be remembered for is how bad they looked in their loss.

 Wham. Seems more and more games are getting ripped off the ISO now. Razor 
ripped TA:K from a CIFE release, now class returns the favour finishing 
what Razor gave up on with the Heavy Gear II rip, our third 5.0 title of 
the week (a first since I've done this report). I wasn't crazy about this 
one either, but it seems that as I get older I like fewer and fewer games.
I can still appreciate good work though. This one looks like it's going to 
have a lot of fans. Tarzan got nuked on most sites as a kiddie game. When 
I leeched it... it wasn't too bad. But the game is intended for ages under 
10 years, and in my books that spells kiddie. Those are never legit 
releases, and we're going to have to penalize CLS for it. Frankly, I just 
can't see justification to take points on this one, however... even though 
it is a kiddie game. I won't deduct any points. It was close enough. The 
auxilliary team was damn busy. Four patches came out, as well as three 
trainers. As per the new rules, only the Need for Speed trainer recieved 
an award, being a 4.0 quality game.

 Steady as she goes... Razor is consistently releasing now, unlike 
the first three months when they were getting flack from across the 
scene (read back in NWR for an ironic quote from me). This week we 
see the legit rip of Total Annihilation Kingdoms. This game I'm a 
little neutral on, but Beowulf wanted this one real bad. He got it, 
the rip is supported by every group that didn't release a bastard 
copy, so this one stands. The addon and two patches round out the
week. Topic in #Razor welcomed Genesis P'Orridge from Origin to 
the group. Apparently he's had second thoughts about joining Razor, 
but he's not in Origin either. A free agent? Sure to be a sought 
after one at that, with Dungeon Keeper 2 and Descent 3 on his resume.

 They tried. This rip of Total Annihilation Kingdoms was the worst 
of the three... basicly the ISO less movies and music. It was the first 
one to hit sites, but the Razor pre team managed to beat them out. 
Perhaps the fact that the rip was almost 250 megs slowed them down. 
It's a nuke, but they would have walked away with it, were it not for 
the work of Beowulf. A patch gives them their only points.

 I was going to work up a compilation of a certian cracker's series 
of nukes, but I didn't really feel like spening the time. It would have 
been amusing, but probably unfair to him. I can't crack, why should I 
rag on someone who almost can? Origin is looking strong right now. 
Not sure about the Origin USA label on Dungeon Keeper II though. 
Sources tell me that was just another limey title. Still, the game 
scene has really balanced out. Origin has picked up a few USA titles 
to go with their UK dominance, which has elevated them past their 
third group status.  Razor is releasing again, and PDM/CLS have tailed 
off noticibly. This trend rarely continues, we usually see members leaving 
the groups on their way down in favor of the ones on their way up. This 
time, however I don't know if that will be the case. Joining Origin is 
generally considered  to be about as desirable as a trade to the 
LA Clippers, and their recent success has been tainted by the insane 
posturing of their leaders. ][ce and Cypher seem to be lashing out at 
anyone and everyone. Success has either gone to thier heads, or caused 
them to go completely insane. Razor could make a move, but except for 
the aborted move of Genesis from OGN to RZR, nobody has made the jump 
as of yet. The scene seems to be waiting to see what happens with Class. 
New leadership almost always comes with change, and there are a plethora 
of skilled crackers to be found there. I'm sure all the groups have 
their eyes on them, but for now, Class seems stable enough. 

 That's all for this week, I'll see you on the sites.

THE BLITZ REPORT FOR THE WEEK OF 06/22/99 - 06/28/99
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Wow, this report will only be one day late! Seems more often than not 
by the time my report reaches you guys, it's old news. Hopefully that 
will change sooner rather than later. Last week we saw the two dominant 
groups from early this year strike back after a couple of weeks of taking
a backseat to the upstarts. Class hasn't missed a beat with Prozac taking 
a real hands on approach to running this group. I even saw him pre a few 
releases on sites... now THAT is attention to detail.

 "Rumours of my demise have been greatly exagerated". I can't remember 
what movie that is from, or even if it's an exact quote, but it pretty 
well sums up the week CLS had. Only one game from these guys, but it was 
a good one. Sega Rally is a really nice improvement over the original. 
I like the way you can slide sideways like a real rally car (much 
improved over the previous, which felt like a video game). No fix for 
this one either... CLS added the complete package: cheat, addon, and 
update, milking this game for all it was worth. Western Battle Front 
I did not try. It's an addon, getting two points. I didn't hear any 
complaints about this one. Actually I didn't hear much of all about 
this release. The patch and trainer team kept busy as well. A nice 
all-around week from the CLS boys, they take down top spot.

 Not to be outdone (well, only outdone by a hair), Paradigm also 
had a solid week. There was lots of whining about outcast only being 
playable in low-res. Well, the game don't look too bad in low-res, 
but we're going to deduct a point from this 3.0 title. I don't like 
this new GFX mode ripping that is going around, but all the groups 
seem to be doing it. This one was a lot more extreme than just ripping 
D3D or 3DFX too. Black moon chronicles from new supplier ResureXi0n is 
a pretty vanilla RTS. I don't know who this new supplier with the K-Rad 
nick is either, someone fill me in. PDM really dropped the ball on the 
Unreal addon too. Blah, two fixes, please. No point for you on this one. 
A couple of updates, a trainer, add that up and it's good enough for 
second place in a week where Razor and Origin faltered.

 Maybe ][ce and Cypher were too busy taking on the world in #scenerags 
to pick up any games, but Origin didn't do much at all. All quiet from 
this group, too bad I couldn't say the same for its leaders. A trainer 
for a marginal game and the god-I-hope-its-the-last update for Warzone.

 Oops. Read back a few issues and you can quote me as saying that a 
non-working dupe is about the worst thing you could do in the scene. 
Well here's Razor with a non-working dupe of a bad game. A two point 
loss is not offset by a nice little patch from Beowulf, and a sweet 
trainer for Dungeon Keeper. Even with the minor patch for Asghan 
thrown in the mix, Razor ends the week worse off than they started 
it. Maybe there just weren't enough big games this week for Razor 
to bother, who knows. Not a week to remember for my own group.

 The game scene these days is far too hostile to be a fun place to 
hang out. The constant whining from groups who lose on games gets 
old after a while, and although all groups are guilty of it, it's 
coming more from a certian group of individuals. How long I wonder 
until these people learn to co-exist with their competitors, and 
even give props for major releases? I can't remember the last time 
Origin actually complimented another group on a release. It's a 
sign of not being secure enough in their own right that they can't 
recognize the good work of others. 

 In other news, TPC has folded their rip division and decided to 
delve into the less-competitive realm of ISO releasing. A few months 
ago this move might have paid off, but I don't see TPC being any 
more competitive in that realm than in their former. The ISO groups 
have gotten a lot faster on their store titles, although they still 
seem to rely on the larger groups for their insider releasing. 
Since it's hard to remember the last insider game that TPC landed, 
I can only fear the worst for TPC. CIFE and FLT are owning the 
ISO scene right now, and their store teams are just as fast as 
any game group's.

 That's the week in review. See you all next week for another look 
at the game scene.

 Koka's Biased(duh!) Cracking Report #1


        Here we go, I am gonna try to make the scene people pay a bit more 
more attention into the cracking scene, so here comes my report. I will be
rating each group and it's releases, with a ranking of them all on the end
of the report, based on my rating and the points I gave,.  I am only going
to report  the top  10 cracking  groups of  the week,  but if you  (REALLY
REALLY)  want your group  to be reviewed,  bug me on irc and I  will think
about it :P
        If you have any suggestions, msg me on irc. Thanks :)
        Kudos to Sketch/THD for helping me out with my english. Thanx bro!


Week is based from 20/06 to 26/06.

  them,  they seem to be doing better everyday,  with madly releasing. An
  average of 5 releases per day, with 10 keygens on the whole week. A fix

  to some bigger meggage not usual on cracking group's releases.  A good week
  overall, though Sensi  (one of their leaders) retired from  the scene after
  that french incident, and that may hurt them in the future. We'll see..

  still were one of the best groups on this past week. :]

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 

Wild Wild West
Starring: BIG WILLIE STYLE, Salma Hayek, Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh.
Rating: 3 Stars /4

Well Big Will is back again on his patented 4th of July big show. This is 
another remake of some old tv show that I never saw, but apparently the 
guy wasn't black back then. So a few things have changed. What hasn't 
changed is the basic same style of a Will Smith film, you've seen the 
other films so you know what to expect. Salma Hayek looks way hot and 
there's some cool effects and then just the general comedy and action 
that comes with a Will Smith film, you either like him or you don't. 
Enjoy the show.

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------




Ryche's Scene Rant Volume 1

There will not be a VCD report this week. Why? Well, I've had some thoughts 
and wanted to share them with you this week. You may find this interesting, 
you may not. If you don't, Fuck you.

Let me preface this by saying this: I am as loyal to the scene as they 
come as are most of my friends and associates. I do this for fun, for 
the cutthroat competition, and for the free stuff. Pretty much the same 
reason all the true people do it. While I do this, my close friends and 
I laugh, we argue, and we have fun. Nothing more, nothing less. With that 
said, let me also add that these are my opinions, and my opinions alone. 
I am as much to blame for the current state of the scene as anyone. Some 
would say more, some would say less, and some would say I'm the root of 
all that is evil and should be burned at the stake.

The entire scene is in trouble, and no one is safe. Warez, MP3, ISO, 
and lately especially VCD has been in the media over and over again. 
Some would point at VCD's and say it's all because of Star Wars. You 
can put the blame wherever you want, but it's everyone's fault. 
Including mine. Movies would have eventually been pirated. Everything 
is pirated. It just so happened the VCD scene was coming into its own 
as one of the most popular scenes at the same time as the most hyped 
movie ever was. If its media, whether is music, software, movies or 
even books for that matter it's pirated. There are more people on the 
internet, and the pipes are getting bigger. We are now at the center 
of attention for technology, and if you ask anyone who makes money from 
it, we are a menace. Now anyone involved with the scene internally knows 
this is not true, but it is how we are seen and probably always will be. 
MP3 is slowly being accepted into mainstream. Instead of trying to 
stop it, they want to know how to make money off of it. They are afraid 
of VCD's. They know the infrastructure isn't there to make money off of 
internet broadcast movies. Streaming video sucks and it always will 
until we all have megabit connections at home. Even then, it could be 
sketchy.

As a scene, we have been far too open with what we do for far too long. 
Once again, I blame myself as much as anyone. I think back to when I 
first got into warez. See if this sounds familiar. There were no places 
that told me everything I needed to know. I had to learn. I had to FIND 
out what IRC was. I had to listen for months. I had to meet people, make 
friends (some of who are still my friends today), and it took me a long 
time. I still don't know it all. I never will. But it is much, much easier 
if your starting out today.

If you read any of the scene pages, you can find out about anything you 
need to know. The larger groups have open channels. Questions are answered 
freely about groups and group leadership. We brag too fucking much. Our 
message boards aren't private. We talk to people openly about what we do. 
We are all targets for arrest, and yet we say anything and everything 
publicly. We are criminals in the eyes of the law. No more, no less.

I know Im not the only one who feels this way, as I'm sure most of you 
reading this who are really true to the game probably feel the same way. 
I've talked with many of you about it. Many of you have talked to me 
about it. I'm not preaching. I don't give a fuck normally. As I sit here 
and read the LA Weekly online and see my groups name pasted all through 
the article, as well as hear reports of people from the scene doing 
interviews with the New York Times and major wire services, it becomes 
crystal clear. We are idiots. All of us. If you are in a major group, or 
even in a minor group that releases. THEY know who you are. I'm not 
paranoid, I don't smoke crack, but they're coming to get us. You can just 
feel it. In the past two months, we have been the subject of over 10 news 
articles, one of them on CNN and in the Associated Press, and at least 2 
Television reports. If there is a public outcry, and the authorities 
consider a news report a public outcry, they will take action. There is 
too much money involved. This is piracy, and they know they can't stop 
IT. But they can stop US.

What can we do? We can do what is best for the scene. Public message 
boards, and the warez papparazi must go. Im sorry, I love some of those 
pages as much as the next person and many of the webmasters are my 
friends, but it is THE most public part of our scene. Anyone can read 
them, you don't need to know the channel, the key, the ip, or the password. 
All you need is to follow a link on CNN.com or follow a link through 
one of the articles that listed the url of our scene pages. I don't 
want to single out any one page, it's not fair, but you know what I'm 
talking about. Get off of Efnet. Ask anyone where all the groups are.. 
they're on Efnet. Public channels are not for private groups. 
100 people in a channel, I know 10 of them, 4 or 5 more are talking. 
Who are the other 85 people and what are they doing here? A NFO should 
not have anything more than info about the release. No one needs to 
know who supplied it, or who is in your group, or what your sites 
are called. Know everyone on your sites. Use whatever tricks you can 
to hide your IP. No site on the planet needs 200 users. If Im not on 
your site, I shouldn't even know about it now should I?
I realize all of this is extreme, and it will probably never happen. 
Nothing may change. But if I don't say it, maybe no one will. 
Everyone at the top thinks it. I know. We've talked about it since 
#thematrix had over 500 people begging for the VCD. It's too big, 
and we're too open about what we do. If it doesn't change, I hope 
my friends and I are in the same prison. We
have alot of fun when we're around each other.

                                                              - Ryche -

Ahh yes, rumors. We all love them, even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us- and these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, (your name will not be included), and we
do not add rumors like "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion" because 
we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore there 
is no hard evidence of that rumor. So, if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!


-Rumor has it that a lot of people are going down in the new Cyberstrike that 
will be coming round anytime now.
