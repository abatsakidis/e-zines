-----------[ ndetroit's sites and stats section ]-----------

    
        
    Zeus 21 kicked from being siteop of DMZ..
    
    TOS is back up after some router problems, and is doing quite well..
    of course, I could have said that they were doing *really* well, if
    only SJ had given me a couple more gigs of creds... <g>

    RFO also doing great.. if i was doing stats this week, i'd make them
    a x3... not cause they are better than fs/e/et/etc, etc, but more
    because this is my section, and i'll do whatever the fuck i want.. ;p

    I had 5 bottles of wine last week worth over $3000... just thought
    I'd share that.

    Yes, i am drunk now.

    D-unknown has retired from the scene. His contributions were many.
    Perhaps the most famous of all was FireSite, one of the best sites
    of alltime. Good luck to him in his Real Life. 
    He leaves FS in the care of Jaydee, and the rest of the dev monkies.
    Good luck to dunk, and good luck to FS.
  
    HOG is back up, talk to a siteop for details. Speed is a bit off
    since i was last on it, but I'd still rate it up there in the top
    10, after 1 week of being back.

    E is just fucking awesome. I love it.. E is out of control. Its
    definately my favorite. ... ... .. oh wait... you mean the *site*???
    Oh. ... well.. thats good too.
    

    Siteops!! send your weektops to: nwr@netmonkey.org... Thanks
  to all those that support us every week... ;)

Lester's Biased Courier Report. 

Yes that's right it's me again, I'm running short on time and don't have 
anyone to fill in this week. So your stuck with my stupid ass. One good 
thing is I actually traded this past week, so I might kind of know what 
I'm talking about. <g> On with the show since I am now a day late :(

Ambition: Wow, I haven't reviewed these guys in, well almost forever. <g> 
AMB has made a nice push recently, picking up a number of couriers and 
getting some of their own pre's to pop up on a weektop or so. Plouf is 
probably their best guy right now but he has a restarting problem that 
he needs to work out. <g> Sup Weeze :)

Overall: 4/10

Amnesia: AMN has one of it's better weeks in recent memory, with a great 
deal of pre'ing and an unprecendented amount of couriers active. They 
end the week with picking up Drunkkid, Arcus, and a few others. Fear 
that guy Lester making the NWR top 10, and Chill ends up on there too, but
they had alot of guys on weektops, but with the loss of Cardiel for awhile, 
they will need to see if anyone else steps up, but Darkangel and Nail are 
back in action. So we'll see.

Overall: 8/10

AOD: As of right now AOD picked up Creater from the now dead? ASN, and 
last week they had a barrage of pre's from Freakshow/Cedric and misc 
others. Last week was pre-week for all groups I think, but Faith was 
also back trading. AOD had a real fine week though. No new traders though, 
but with Faith and Cedric they don't really need it <g> Also, Cedric 
is extremely fucking fat.

Overall: 8 1/2 / 10

Ascension: Well this may be the shortest lived super hyped group since 
the reformation of GODS back in like 96 :). Zeus21 retires and it all 
falls apart! that great leader left and they couldn't hold it together 
anymore!#! And now in the real world. ASN was doomed from the start 
by Zeus21's big words and lack of ability to lead. A highly unorganized 
and also highly attacked group, was never given much of a shot, and 
with in the past week Godbody/Drunkkid/Phenyx going to AMN and Creater 
to AOD. They decided to close up shop. Well goodbye ASN, you will not 
be missed. <g> HI DV!#@

Overall: -1/10 (Suicide costs you a point)

Devotion: TC..and Jaydee..hehe mass PFT action. They also picked up 
Aenima for some more pre's to go under devotion's label <g> Godbless is 
back in action this week, so that sucks. hehe, but Officedog was also 
popping around so really Devotion had a biggest week in a long time since 
JD is back. But I must give them some credit, JD and TC were actually 
trading some too. So go dev I guess. <g>

Overall: 9/10

Risc: Brain is a moron, Psedo/Borg/Flavor/Avalanch make up a decent 
trading team, but only Psedo and borg really show up on the top sites. 
Though they did have some pres of their own to make it on some weektops 
higher. Well if Risc can keep Bender out of the pftp world and Brain's 
mouth shut, they might have something going.

Overall: 6/10


Well that about does it folks, a busy busy week in the courier scene. 
Over a gig a piece in pres for the big 3 and all the other groups 
chimed in with anything they could find too. Hopefully this tide
will go down and we'll see more rls groups releasing instead of 
courier groups <g>

THE NWR GAME REPORT ------------------------------ 11/17/99 - 11/23/99


Wow, another new person is writing the games report for NWR, isn't this
interesting? A new person seems to write the NWR gaming report every week.
So instead of waiting on Blitz to submit his report, the staff
at NWR has created their own report. It doesn't matter who pens the report,
it only matters if people get an overview of what came out this week in
the gaming scene.

The rules for this report are simple. If it wasn't nuked on sites, and
was accepted by the scene, it makes it in the report. All groups that
released a couple times during the week will be reported.

The scores will be very easy to follow. There won't be a scale of 1-5
based on one person's opinion. Using the same formula that is less
controversial from the ISO charts, every game, no matter of the quality, will
be 5 points. If a game is truly undisputed exceptional, it'll get an
additional +1 bonus point. Patches will get +2 points, Trainers & Addons will
get +1, and Cheat Codes will get +0.5 points. A nuked release will get -1.
If minor fixes are released, and are needed, the release group who originally
released the rip will be penalized.

COMMENTS:
Well Class continues its streak of just pumping out the releases. None
of the releases are stunning, and the quality spectrum are
on are on extreme ends. Consistent, but still a little sloppy. They
did win on Rally Championship, but people complained about the transparency
problem. They get points for putting out the release first.

COMMENTS:
Well Paradigm is now reverting to heavily relying on ISOs to keep surviving.
Thanks in part to their solid cracking team, they'll be able to continue
to tackle games other groups can't get ripped. PDM cleans up CLS's bad
release of Rally Champ, and do a commendable release. Some were bitching about
Indiana Jones missing Ambient Sounds, and others moaned that Indiana crashes
after Chapter 1 for them. It has also been passed along that in Gorky 17
you can't save a game. While PDM has been winning on the ISO rips, they
will need to tie up some loose ends.

COMMENTS:
Sad. No matter if you love or hate Origin, Test Drive 6 just proves that
they can't properly package a game that involves a setup.bat. An Origin
release is just not an Origin release without a setup.bat fix anymore.
One has to wonder what the hell OGN was rushing about on the game. Even
worse, they rushed on fixes! If a game can't be fixed within 2 fixes,
then the group should bow down and admit defeat. Seriously FUBAR.
At least OGN won on the cracking battle of TR4.

COMMENTS:
Just like PDM, DVN now heavily relies on ISO rips to survive. At least the
groups are now giving the curiosity of greeting where they got the ISO.
People probably didn't know that Shanghai Essentials is just a repack
value version of Shanghai Dynasty, but since no one really in the scene
plays Mah-Johgg, it wasn't noticed. DVN did attempt to fix OGN's screwup
of TD6, then messed it up themselves. DVN's rip didn't work either for
several people, and the fix was needed to get it working. Stop rushing,
and start ripping correctly! Basically take 10 min and you have 2 more
games working (td6,cc4)

COMMENTS:
Another ISO ripping group, they take on the games that the big groups who
have good track records have passed up on, declaring to big or unrippable.
They did a nice job on HYPE, but screwed up the addon.

 OMG YET ANOTHER GAMES REPORT ISSUE #2
 -------------------------------------

 Note: This report is best viewed in DOS Editor, AcidDraw, some other
       good ASCII editor, or on the chest of a Playboy Bunny.

 Holly Leeching Lamers Batman! I'm back in NWR! 

 Well at the last minute I was asked to return to NWR. So what the
 hell. This time around I will only review games released since
 the last issue. The deadline for releases will be when ever I 
 finish writing this.

 Warning: Do not attempt to consume this report. If swallowed, consult
 a physician. If tasty, try it with ketchup!

                                                        - The Preacher Kane

 The Points:
 -----------

 * Games will be scored on a scale of 0 to 5, points being awarded according
   to the quality of the title. And not just quality by name - after all,
   an anticipated "blockbuster" can suck as badly as the worst budget
   schlock.

 * A fix will result in a loss of .5 (one half) of a point. If the fix
   is released by a group other than that which released the game, they
   will earn the extra point.

 * Addons such as Movies and Music will earn between 1 and 2 points,
   depending on the title AND whether or not they actually ENHANCE the
   gaming experience. Addons released by groups other than the group
   who originally released the game will not be considered. Addons of
   essential features (IE Textures, 3DFX, stuff that should not have
   been ripped to begin with) will result in the loss of 1 point. Which
   means certain titles can earn points even if some people consider them
   "rapes" - I'm on a modem after all!

 * Retail addons will recieve a score of between 1 and 4 points if they
   are developed by the original developers of the game, or are officially
   licensed. Unofficial addons will not be considered. Standalone addon
   packs are always preferable to a standard addon release. If a group
   releases an addon which is later released as a standalone, only
   the standalone will recieve points.

 * Update patches and trainers will earn 1 point each provided they
   are fully working. A trainer released by a group after an existing
   trainer has already been made available in an earlier release will
   only be considered if it offers something NEW, otherwise it will be
   considered a DUPE.

 * Cheat codes will be worth .5 (one half) of a point. Since updates and
   trainers take more skill to produce, simple cheat codes cannot be
   assigned an equal value.

 * A DUPE of a game will result in the loss of 1 point, with the
   following exception: A game that was lost during a race between two
   groups will not result in the loss of any points (we do need some
   competition in the scene!).

 * Repackaging of a game will result in the loss of .5 (one half) of a point.

 * Non-English games will not be considered. Sorry, I only speak one
   language.

 * I retain the right to bend the rules any way I see fit!


 * DATES *

 This time around I'm including the last 7 days of releases - 10/17/99 thru
 to 11/23/99. Or something like that.

 Comments:

 Class again showed dominace. They still have somewhat of a link with
 FLT, and those US FLT release are paying off, since CLS gets a jump
 on them. They did face intense competition from DVN, PDM, and OGN
 this week.

 The Good:
 A lot of average titles. Dominated all the Hasbro games this week.

 The Bad:
 Class was unable to win on ANY of the major races for ISO titles.
 They used the FLT allegiance to their advantage, and won several
 races, but failed to pull in any grand titles. And is CLS taking
 over the hunting game junk from DVN???

 The Ugly:
 Rally Championship was unplayable. Class knew they were racing and
 rushed it, end of story. Minus 1 point since it's unsalvageable.

 Comments:

 Another week provides another hard rip from DVN. The problem with
 these guys seems to be inability to race on store pickups and
 easy rips. Anything difficult lately has turned up DVN, showing they
 have some great ripping skill. What they don't have is speed.

 The Good:
 Close Combat 4, one of the best releases this week. While everyone
 was leeching ISO's to race and doing the smaller titles, DVN won
 out on this great one. If you remember Close Combat 3 couldn't be
 ripped, so that's pretyy impressive.

 The Bad:
 Horse Racing games suck. Test Drive 6 is working with the fix (1 fix better
 than OGN's many, but we'll get to that). But it shouldn't have needed any.
 Plus the game sort of sucks.

 The Ugly:
 Spats with OGN and Precise... shut up and rip guys!

 Comments:

 Still stuck with racing ISO's, OGN would do anything they could to
 get a good jump over FLT. With Deviance not much help and Ice, Butcher,
 etc., not having as much control in the aforementioned ISO group as in
 the past, OGN has to rely on it's quick rips - and OGN isn't great at
 it.

 The Good:
 Tomb Raider 4! Lara's back. She's hot! She's gonna kick butt! CLS got
 caught with their thumbs up their asses here, word on the streets was
 they had it ripped LONG before OGN. 

 The Bad:
 A lot. Again. Test Drive 6 is FUBAR'd. Yes there's a FINAL fix from
 TK4. Dozens of people were bitching in #origin that it STILL didn't
 work. Some were morons, some were legit. I personally ran it and
 STILL found some bad textures. Oh well. The game sucks. But here's
 the reasons I gave DVN the points:

 1) 3 fixes (3rd one is all inclusive, don't apply the first 2)
 2) 2 repacks of fixes.
 3) OGN released fixes as IND and -TK4. WTF? That's going to confuse
    end users, many won't run an IND release for phear of fucking
    something up.
 4) Final fix left bugs.
 5) Compression - OGN converted SOME textures to get the game
    under the limit. Why stop at SOME? At least DVN converted them
    all, bringing the game to HALF the size. There's no noticable loss
    in quality, fewer credits are lost, and ISP/Phone bills are lower.
    
 The Ugly:
 Origin rushed TD6, period. They're the SECOND group to do this the past
 week.

 Comments:

 Someone said PDM wasn't doing good this month. I say that person needs
 to pay attention. PDM has the fewest fixes, and the most decent titles.
 Class and Divine seem to release either AMAZING titles, or pure JUNK
 games. Yes those two groups release more and earn points that way,
 but PDM is actually doing well.

 The Good:
 A working version of Rally Championship, which runs much better with
 textures intact. And it turned out to be a GREAT game, much better
 than TD6. Gorky17 is a Euopean title, it was released in the US
 the next day as Odium. Now Odium is identical (RiscISO duped on
 the ISO release of it due to this), and even the speech hasn't
 changed, so Odium talks about Gorky17. But the game looks
 fun. Indiana Jones was a very hard rip, seems PDM figured out
 the sound file troubles. And Star Trek: Hidden Evil was anthor
 quality game... for Trekkies at least.

 The Bad:
 It's rumored Indiana Jones needs a fix. No confirmation, and no
 fix as of yet.

 The Ugly:
 Nada.

 Comments:

 Well again not a good week for Precise. This new group is struggling
 due to lack of suppliers. They tried to race on the ISO of Horse
 Racing but well...

 The Good:
 They're trying.

 The Bad:
 Horse Racing has freeware demos left in it. Now DVN raced and won
 on most sites (god knows why they'd want to race a horse game though).
 DVN's was also smaller. They removed track animations. Does this matter?
 Not really, because the game is a manager. Running the hourse in a circle
 doesn't do much. You want that, get the old Riding Star from CLS.

 The Ugly:
 Lack of suppliers relegates them to ISO ripping. Lack of skilled
 crackers/rippers relegates them to smaller titles.

 Did I mention Razor is idle as hell? Ok well they released the
 Unreal Tournament ISO this week, which OWNS. But they fucked up
 the original pack and missed a CD, then did a proper repack.
 Problem is I don't review ISO's.

 The Good:
 They managed to do something.

 The Bad:
 Only Backlash and Precise did worse in the past twenty days.

 The Ugly:
 Things are not going to get any better in the near future.
 Does this sound familar?

 Comments:

 Again Scar shows themselves to be the better of the two upstart groups,
 even though they only really do ISO rips and junk shareware.

 The Good:
 Hype: TimeQuest was a HARD rip which many had written off.

 The Bad:
 Stop doing these lame cardgames!

 The Ugly:
 TimeQuest addon had to be redone. The addon I gave 1 point to. The need
 for a fix cost Scar -.5 (one half) of a point.

 Springerish Final Thought:

 Should Class get all those points for releasing crappy games? I dunno, 
 everyone else does though, so it's a level playing field. Should the disk 
 limit go up? Probably. But something has to be done to ensure that ohh... 
 lets say OGN's ripping habits (Mortyr, TD6) are stopped. I'm just using 
 OGN as an example. Racing to rip ISO's has created a lot of difficulties, 
 the #1 problem being shoddy rips that need many fixes, or aren't ripped 
 as small as they could have been within the current set of standards. 
 The Faction is no longer in control of its own members (of which, 
 technically OGN is not, but they did at one time state that they would 
 FOLLOW the rules). Is it really needed? Maybe its time the end users out 
 there made themselves heard.

 Well that's the end of my report. Don't know when/if ever I'll be back. 
 I didn't even expect to be here this week. Hope you enjoyed it. Singing 
 off...

 Bud's Biased Utils Report #41
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Next week will mark the 1 year anniversary of my utils report in NWR.
 Damn! I can't believe it's been a year. I can't believe I missed so many
 issues! I can't believe I've wasted so much time! Anyways I'm hoping
 to have some fun shit included next week for the occasion. I'll be popping
 pointless questions to scene figures all week. I'll be annoying. This
 column will be twice as long as the rest of NWR! <G>. Or I'll be late...
 or NWR will be delayed a week... whichever is easier.
  
 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 11/16/99 to 11/22/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.

 Thankfully PWA brought us the latest build of MS Windows 2000 Server
 this week, so we can have another early look at all the new bugs
 that will be implemented in the new OS. Woops I meant features...
 wait, no, bugs was right. We also see the latest update of Geomedia
 in the Service Pack 1 release. All thats left was a plugin for 3DSMAX
 and a collection of Xtra's for Director.

 not sure anyone will want it. Grams32 is a Molecular Imaging suite... my
 field was the Arts... so ummm... don't even ask we what this is good for.
 Maybe some Bio students will like it.

 Shock slowed somewhat this week, with only three apps. An MP3 encoder
 for CakeWalk Home Studio 9 (A demo of this is included in that package),
 and one of the latest apps from Object Design Inc, (developers of
 Objectstore) eXcelon Stylus. Most suprising is the newest version of
 Motivate, a high-end 3D gaming/multimedia development system.

 release back in August. If 2570 works well for you, don't
 bother switching. On the other hand, HomeSite 4.5 is worth
 the download if you are a 4.0 user.

 LEGENDS NEVER DIE:

 Releases: 

 3D_LIGHTYEAR_1.0_WINNT-LND
 THINK_DESIGN_3.01-LND

 Think positive thoughts... I will release, I will release... ;)
 LND actually gets two apps out this week, their best effort in a while.
 In fact it's their first two releases of the month. Not bad titles either,
 and with NS back in action LND might actually do something if the trend
 continues... still they're a long way from their strongest. Think Design,
 a 3D design tool that allows drafting, conceptual design, wireframe, and
 and surfacing, is my pick for the better of the two.

 seen before, and it's nothing special.

 With SolidCam 99 4.01, DOD officially gets out of the "Oh My God

 a strong start on the 16th it was all quiet on the Eastern front.
 Hopefully they'll continue onwards next week.

 Those guys over at Scum simply DOMINATED the week in warez (my apologies
 to WWN) over the past seven days. Looking like Siege or the briefly revived
 PWA of a short time ago (wonder why) they got out the largest amount of
 quality titles this week. And while people will complain about the Solaris
 app and the Linux release or say the the Installshield release is minor,
 there is still a LOT of nice titles here. Most notable are Vision Jade Dev
 Studio 5, PowerDesigner 7 from Sybase, the Lotus titles, VisualAge Smalltalk
 Enterprise 5, and Synergis NFM, for use with AutoCAD. Only problem with NFM
 is that they released 3.1 and 3.6 in the same week, so I'll only score one
 of them. The Linux/Solaris apps get half points (both are X86 apps).

 FCN also showed some dominace this week. While they had their usual slew 
 of Delphi components, they also picked up the 8.0 final of InstallMaster, 
 and are a good bet when the InstallManager final comes around. Raize
 Components and VSFlexGrid Pro 7 are also worth noting.

 Sonic.Foundry.Acid.Style.2.0-PROS
 Music.Write.2000.Professional-PROS
 CakeWalk.Home.Studio.v9.0-PROS

 Pros gets a few good apps this week. CakeWalk Home Studio 9
 is a lot of fun for the amateur composer who wants to create
 a few tunes on his home computer. Compatible with several
 formats, you can import samples... but don't expect something
 stylized such as Dance/Techno/HipHop eJay or what-not,  CalkWalk
 is a tad more complex and mainstream. Music Write will be beneficial
 if you know actual musical notation, but all of you guys using Tab
 can use it as well. Acid Style is also a sweet release, but shame
 on Pros for missing the serial, it was pretty obvious, and although
 the program claims the serial in the the PDF docs, it isn't.

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 




Uhh..ya so I saw some movies


Sleepy Hollow
Starring: Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, & Gary Oldman
Directed by: Tim Burton
Rating: 3 1/2 out of 4 stars

Well this is one of the movies I have been waiting to see for a very 
long time. I love Burton, Depp, and Ricci, so I went in to this movie 
with very high hopes. I was not totally disappointed but it wasn't the 
film I had hoped it would be. It is still Burton, very dark and secret. 
It's a wonderful setting and adds a great deal to the movie in just 
the backgrounds. Elfman does some great music to set the mood. Depp 
and Ricci are both good but they have a few weak lines and the movie 
just seems to lack something. But it is indeed a very good movie. 
Alot of big names involved in this movie and you should check it out, 
it's worth seeing for sure.

Starring: Pierce Brosnan, Robert Carlyle, Sophie Marceau, Denise Richards
Rating: 3 out of 4 stars

James Bond is back in action again with one of the better Bond films 
that I have seen. You get 2 hot chicks in this one and unfortunately 
it's Bond so you get no nudity. Alot of nice little puns and quick 
jokes that Bond films are famous for. The action is top notch and it's 
just an all around Bond movie. Real good, check it out.

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is  usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear  people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination  of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.

--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors. We all love them, even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us- and these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, (your name will not be included), and we
do not add rumors like "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion" because 
we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore there 
is no hard evidence of that rumor. So, if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!

-Rumor has it that mandrake is back!(*&!*&#&!

-Rumor has it that TMS would have been back this week, except that a certain
 someone accidently fried its bios, and needs to buy a new MB.. <grin>

-Rumor has it that AMB is set to make a huge comeback. Good luck to them.
