Well, you all may have noticed last weeks blunder of the nwr-77.txt inside
nwr-78, my bad. Anyhow, we are back again and the month as ended, so iso
report is upon us, a couple other things I'd like to bring up. unless someone
wishes to volunteer their time to the stats and courier rankings section,
NWR will be abandoning that. There are plenty of stat mags and it's just
too time consuming for me to do right now. So if you want to volunteer,
be my guest, but if your not going to do it for real every week, dont 
volunteer. Another couple things are, it appears Ryche will never return,
so if you want to take over the vcd group review, then contact me and we'll
give you a shot. Also, since we now have a gaming review once again, i was thinking
it might be interesting to have a PSX review as well, so if you are into PSX and
play all the games, let me know and we'll see if you can write. Anyways,
enough about me, let's get on to the show. New picture this week from
Tdpriest is of Jess tricking Sins into thinking he's goin to get some
of that great squirtage, but he gets a yellow surprise.



Cool Person of the week: Well as it stands, this may become the Jess award,
nobody else has made much effort to attain this title, and so it goes
to Jess again for the webpage: www.bangedup.com. Keep up the good work 
squirtie.


Loser of the week: Well I messed up last week, it should have gone to Gza
for leaving Rise over a name calling incident, so now I will rightfully
give the award to Glen this week, since he didn't really get it last week
and i'm sure he's very upset about it. So glen here you are, loser of the week.

Grumblings and Observations:

Well, I will grumble a bit first of all about Stile, I give a nice msg to
vote for him and support his page, and he rips on us for using a couple
of the pics from his page. Very well, fuck off and die Stile, thank you.

Next on the agenda is movie prices. Now I know theaters dont make much
off the door, and that is why the snack food is so outrageously high,
but now ticket prices are up around 8-8.50 a pop, and so that's an 
increase of over a dollar in some theaters in the span of a month or 2.
Now this might be ok if like say the concession stands deflated their prices,
to help equal it out, people are going to movies more than ever before, and 
it is ludicrous to assume that theaters and Hollywood are not making money. So
you could look at it from the standpoint of, well they are going to the movies anyways
so let's make a few more bucks off them since they are gonna go anyways. But if you
looked at it from a standpoint of a non-money grubbing facist bastard, you would see that
since so many people are going, and if you have to raise ticket prices, then maybe a little
downslope on the concession wouldn't be that horrible, to lighten the blow to us poor
bastards who take their girls out to a movie. So a big fuck you to movie theaters, especially
the Block at orange for being the most expensive one.

Ok guys, let's have a little thing here, you the readers write in, on the topic
of my grumblings, this weeks is kind of 1 sided and I dont care what any
of you think about it, so let's base it upon last weeks Riding tips for morons.
write or find me on irc and tell me of your worst recent road rage or moronic driving
items, and i'll put the best 5 or so in and you guys win a chocolate dildo from
Nicki's porn world. email me at lester@netmonkey.org or find me on irc.

I have a new topic to grumble about, but I'm gonna save it for next week, since we
are already late and last week some people said my rant was too long. <g>

 Bud's Biased Utils Report #51
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Here I am, two weeks in a row! Can I beat 3???

 I said last week that I'd tally points for all the original groups who've been
 here all 50 weeks, and do that last 10 weeks for the rest. Then I started on it
 and realized that issues 9 & 31 didn't have scores. I had forgot about 31. So
 you'll get it next week. While I'm on the subject, I've changed my mind
 about who to include. I won't do any of the groups not here since day one, since
 some of them haven't been on the charts for 10 weeks yet. I'll only give a tally
 for PWA/XF/SHK/PFT/LND/PNC/DOD/RBS. I should note that RiSE disbanded for a 
 period last year so that's why they aren't included. Eventually I'll do some
 sort of averaging thing for everyone. When I'm feeling up to it. NOT anytime
 soon though. 

 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 03/28/00 to 04/03/00. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.


 Groups: (In no particular order)
 
 ‹ ﬂﬂ€€‹ ‹        ‹      ‹
  ﬂ€‹ ﬂ€›ﬂ€‹ ﬁ  ‹€ﬂ  ‹‹€€› A Group

 PIRATES WITH ATTITUDE:

 Releases: 

 BYTE.INTO.THE.MARKET.2.103-PWA
 ProSTATS.Tracking.System.V.2.0-PWA
 Hillgraeve.HyperAccess.V.8.32-PWA
 MetaStock.PRO.v7.0-PWA

 PWA continues to move along. While they're not exactly the strong group
 of old, some dedicated members are getting some releases out. Highlights
 this week are MetaStock Pro 7 & HyperACCESS 8.32. MetaStock was actually
 being requested by several people I know since v7 was announced, and the 
 Pro offers a ton of features - although some may confuse novice users.

 X-FORCE:

 Releases: 

 SYSTEM_ARCHITECT_2001_V6.6.2-XFORCE
 ALIASWAVEFRONT_MAYA_FUSION_2-XFORCE

 Two decent releases from XF this week. As usual they win with Maya. I'm
 not sure what suprises me more, that XF is still around or that they're
 still managing to win titles like this. Should they ever loose their grip
 on the core library of apps they release time and time again, XF will be
 in a lot of trouble.

 SHK's week on paper looked good, but there's really nothing major here, besides
 a gem in PC MACLAN for Windows 2000. The Quicken Legal apps may look nice but
 they really aren't all that noteworthy.

 VERITAS.Backup.Exec.8.0.3314.NON.STOLEN-PFT
 VERITAS.Backup.Exec.8.0.3314.NON.STOLEN.nfo.fix-PFT

 I'm always supportive of groups getting credit for their work, thus
 I'm fine with PFT releasing their own copy of Backup Exec. *BUT* - there's
 always a "but" - if you're going to do it, do it right. Don't screw up the
 NFO when you should be taking the time to write an extra-detailed one
 describing the reason for releasing something saying "non-stolen".
 For the record, the -MGY release was the stolen one, and I have no idea
 what MGY is.

 and don't really feel up to delving into it here. The NFOs and dirnames are
 a tad confusing but the Integral rels are apps + source code - I think. Yes,
 I'm too lazy to leech the 2MB to find out. Honestly I don't care either way,
 I'm sure those who want it will find out.

 I gave ParticleSuite points last week, so the repack gets a fat zero. It
 just came out too late for me to get in last week, I'd passed out by that 
 time. Canopus SoftXplode was nuked - for not having a version. Problem is,
 if the program didn't have a version, Harvest had no choice - some apps
 don't, especially with plugins. No idea what the case with SoftXPlode was,
 but nukers need to be aware of this. SoftImage XSI v1.0 is the gem here.

 ARSENIC:

 Releases:

 IntelCAD.BLITZ.xRepath.v2.2.0.7-ARSENiC

 I gave Arsenic 5 last week but forgot to mention it. Don't start drinking
 halfway through something you're writing - you tend to rush to the finish.

 I have no CLUE what that app this week is btw... but I'm not sure it matters,
 because as I was writing this Arsenic gave word that they'd merged into SLT.
 Total: 1/10

 New this week: N/A

 Idle this week: PNC

 Quote(s) of the Week: <[nj]> i tried driving while i was stoned yesterday 
                       <[nj]> and i drove into a fuckin tree :/

 RISE and DOD did some good stuff. This week was rather slow, aside from Arsenic
 merging there wasn't much action, and Arsenic was a young group so it wasn't
 a big shakeup or anything. Kudos to Rebels for doing Netware 5.1, despite the
 fact that Novell's client royally f@&!ed up my networking last week.

=---------------Monthly Iso Utils Review------------------------=


Well well well, it seems NWR can't do anything without being copied. A new
iso utils report has popped up, and though we welcome some added opinions, it
is funny that NWR seems to start alot of trends. Guess thats why I agreed to do
this when Lester asked me to. Anyhow, enough about that other report, it's time
once again for us to delve into the iso crap.


*NOTE*: This list was made by dupechecking on some good sites, so some dates may be off 
or possibly a release missed, if we miss anything, please email nwr@netmonkey.org with
your release list at the end of the month to help us properly catalog and review your
group each month. Thank you.

Well Rise has easily it's weakest month since the rebirth, starting out
really strong with the BC++B release which was indeed very nice. Some
contraversy was surrounding this release, but only by jealous people
I assume, as if you pay attention to the website, you can get companion
discs for BC++B, but they are not actual parts of the program,
and so the iso that Rise released was still the valid iso. Just not
*retail* as that other report points out, those companion discs are
free of charge, so obviously if you bought it from a store, you would
receive them, just like receiving an AOL disc when you buy crap, should
groups start releasing those too just because they came with the retail package?
Anyways, After that, they kind of hit a big lull, grabbing only SF Acid DJ
in the span of 2 weeks. The end of the month was strong with a UG16 addon,
and the Photoscript plus is a nice scanning program but won't come close to
our top10. But then you come to a new SolidView Pro, which is a big title and
a nice update since the last, and also PC-DMIS, which was extremely small, but
I don't rate based upon site rules, I rate based upon merit of title. PC-DMIS
is an overlooked cad/cam app but indeed a popular and good one. Cisco got nuked
on sites as old, but it was from 99, which isn't that old in my opinion so
I'll give them the credit. Hopefully we will see Rise do better next month.

If you look at TFL's month on paper, it looks like they 
blew up in what was a fairly quiet month for
the other big groups. But if you examine the repacks and the
clipart, you realize they had alot of filler in between the big titles,
but they did do well, no doubt about that. Couple notes about
last month, they receivsed possitive points for the delcam
powermill/powershape isos, and come later to find out the translators
are not cracked and no fix has been made. So a thumbs down to
them for their work ethic on fixing titles. I don't care much for
clipart, but I know alot of people do so they aren't going unnoticed,
but getting past all that and the MCSE crap and the repacks, we are left
with one of the best apps of the month, in Lightwave 3D V6, a really
nice pickup for them, although nearly a month after the rip. Macromedia
freehand 9 and Lotus smartsuite millennium are nice pickups, notable mentions
would be Cisco Works and Veribest suite, but overall the total # of apps
kind of sag against the actual # of really good apps.

Risciso has a big month, some of the apps are pretty mediocre, but
they do pick up Solaris 8 which tho not PC, is still a nice app
to grab, opnet and Winfax and Oracle Enterprise round up the better
apps here, Missing the bin/cue of that Gay chariot app wasn't a very
good move. But a strong month for them, their best since our inception
anyways. I'm sure alot of the MS freaks out there would appreciate
those apps, but if your MCSE you get them anyways, so..:)

With cedric leavin for Risciso, PSF has a very very quiet month.
Which probably also explains Risciso's surgence in releasing,
Adobe Premiere is a good app, not sure of the benefits of 
a whole iso, but I'm sure it has plenty of useful fluffed up
shit. Not much to say, the Creature creator sounds pretty 
impressive to play with.

by the bigger groups. Crystal Reports 8 is a solid app for them as well.

Well RBS has a positive month, it's nice to see
people are getting back into releasing Novell,
the whole Novell super crackdown seems to be less
 severe than back in the days when no one would even
touch their stuff. Seems RBS has gone the way of Rise and
dropped the ISO part of their name. <g> I'm not familiar
with much of this other stuff. the Vbasic SDK is nice to see 
though, the repack hurts them though.


Top Releases: Novell/Vb SDK

Every month I will be rating in my personal opinion, the top 10 releases of the month.

These are also in no particular order.

--------------

1. NEWTEK.LIGHTWAVE.3D.V6-TFL
2. INPRISE.BORLAND.C.PLUS.PLUS.BUILDER.V5.0.ENTERPRISE.EDITION.ISO-RiSE

8. LOTUS.SMARTSUITE.MILLENIUM.EDITION.V9.5.2-TFL
9. Streets.USA.2000-iCOiSO
10. MIL3_OPNET_6.0-RiSCiSO

Again, those are in no particular order. I would have too much
trouble trying to decide which was supposed to be where in the top 10.

-------

This was a bad month overall. I had trouble even picking out 10
apps, despite the large # of crap released by some of the groups.
The month clearly goes to TFL, mainly for Lightwave and a slew
of clipart. Next month Shock or FCN will be gone and with LND
coming back, they'll be added to the list, and some other groups
will get tossed in. I think I'm going to modify some things
and score a little more regularly, but it could just be BS
as usual, but NWR is late and so am I. lester is yelling for
me to close up, so enjoy and look for us in a month.

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is  usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear  people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination  of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.

DENNISON'S GAME REVIEW
----------------------

ok, if you will notice this issue we have only reviewed 2 games, well, i decided
to cut our reviews down to only 4 games per issue since these reviews take A LOT 
of time! :( so I'm really sorry. anyway, knowhing that a lot of you out there
have very short attention spans like me, loading up an issue with a lot of
reviews would only make you skim through the good parts and not actually read
them, and what I want is for you to actually read the reviews because they're
really good and we spent a lot of time testing them and doing research for each
game just to come up with a high-quality review (yeah right :P comparable to
those that you get in commercial magazines like pcgamer .. and for free too! :)
WTF you're still reading??? duh :) for all i know not many people would even
bother to read up to this part but if you're still reading then good.. hehehe
Oh my.. you're really reading this shit huh? *blush* Ok ok fine.. Anyway, this
isn't a 0sec release review, heck it isn't supposed to be warez-related so if
you're expecting a review for a game that already "came out" like sof and
messiah, then you'll probably find them next issue since we don't wanna rush
and well, wtf are you still reading this crap for? hey did you ever notice i
rarely use caps?? you do? screw you man! you're giving me the creeps! hey that
reminds me of the time when i was a little kid, i had this pet frog named
cedric, i used to kiss her (yes, my frog is female) everyday thinking that one
day she might turn into a princess, she was the only friend i had! i was a
lonely kid.. i had no friends except for my little pet froggie.. i was so close
to this frog that i even brought her to school everyday, wherein i carried her
on my bike. but, one day, the unthinkable happened.. while i was going to school 
cedric jumped out of my backpack and i unkowingly sqished her with my bike! :( i
was heartbroken. i cried and cried.. i had lost the only friend i had.. :( oh
wtf am i saying.. damn too much vodka.. wtf are you doing still reading this
shit!?? argh!#  -dennison


After playing EA games for a long time now, I got the chance to play some other
games from different companies, like Microsoft and Eidos. Cool thing is I got 2
baseball games Microsoft Baseball 2001 and Triple Play 2001 so I thought why not 
compare them in a review? That's what I did, so you can read what one is better
for you to get. It was a week full  of sport games again :)  -senator

ESRB Rating.: E (Everyone)

Graphics....: 10/10 - The graphics are simply spooge-able, they are very sharp
                      and highly detailed, from the peasants to the heroes, to
                      the small structures, to the trees, down to the majestic
                      castle.. simply spooge-able. Remember how games like Age
                      of Kings (AOE 2), Pharao, and Setllers almost blew your
                      eyes right our of their sockets? Well, wait `till you get
                      a load of Majesty!
Sound.......:  9/10 - The sounds are crisp, clear, and high quality, I have no
                      complaints here either.
Control.....:  9/10 - The controls are very easy, and the game presents a lot of
                      keyboard shortcuts which I find very handy and useful.
Gameplay....:  8/10 - Unlike most strategy games, in Majesty you don't erect
                      structures or direct your units like they were dummies
                      waiting for directions from high above. Here, houses just
                      spring up on their own as the community expands, units
                      like the guards, peasants, tax collectors, etc. all do
                      their own thing without need of care or instructions.
                      Basically you cannot directly control everything which can
                      be a bit frustrating for control freaks like me, but the
                      tradeoff is that this adds more to the realism of the game
                      where in you rule and organize rather than control and
                      direct. And this is what gives the game its own glory and
                      charm.
Story.......:  n/a  - Basically you're some sort of ruler in a fantasy kingdom
                      wherein you are supposed to enlist the aid of Wizards,
                      Elves, Barbaians, and other fantastic heroes in order to
                      aid you in conquering neighboring kingdoms. Hence, the
                      story unfolds as you play the game.
Movies......:  n/a  - I haven't played the game much to see see much movies from 
                      this game yet so in fairness, I won't rate it.
Replay......: 10/10 - Definitely an addictive game. Its uniqueness and charm
                      has this magical pull which makes me want to come back for
                      more action.
Gender Bias.:  9/10 - Well, this game may involve a lot of action and fighting
                      but the avoidance of gore and foul language would surely
                      entice women to play too.
Fun Factor..:  8/10 - This game has high production values and is very well-
                      planned. The game balance is good, and the gameplay is so
                      unique. It may prove a bit challenging for some people
                      who aren't into fantasy or strategy type of games but it
                      should still prove to be fun no matter what.
Multiplayer.:  8/10 - Registered users may play for free over The Zone, wherein
                      you can play head to head against up to 7 players in an
                      all-out deathmatch. Could be better if they added other
                      game modes like capture the flag or quest mode or
                      something.
Overall.....:  9/10

With Majesty, Microprose presents to us a new game concept wherein strategy,
adventure, and simulation are presented all in one game. Although it leans more
into the strategy side, you can't control your units directly, which makes it
somewhat like Settlers. The units and structures are controlked by the computer
AI, which makes it a simulation, and the prescence of heroes, foes, items,
attributes, and quests make it an adventure game. I don't think there is a game
out in the market that plays Majesty, so maybe the developers are trying to
start a new trend here? Only time will tell.. all I know is I almost ran out of
words to describe how great, fantastic, unique, majestical, cool, superb, pr
whatever this game is, so check it out for yourself :) This game goes up to
one of my game of the year candidates.

-
The Bottomline:
WTF are you waiting for??? Diablo 2?? Daikatana? well, while you're waiting for 
those.. go get this!$#$!@ Gee.. Microprose should start paying me for this kind
of advertising ;D Anyway, get this game, seriously.

ESRB Rating.: Everyone

Graphics....:  9/10 - As aspected from game by EA the graphic are great as
                      always. The players are extremely detailed, same for the
                      stadiums. One thing that EA does great too is the menu
                      interfaces and once again, they made an awesome one for
                      this  new title, no complicated menus with nice graphics.
                      The player animation is done very good, every year you
                      think EA can't improve the great games, but they prove you 
                      wrong again every year :) But there is one thing, the
                      crowd. In every sport game of EA I played the crowd
                      is just a bunch of different colors. But on the other hand 
                      of you would have 3d rendered crowds you would need a much 
                      faster cpu.     
Sound.......:  7/10 - When you arrive in the menu, you will hear some cool
                      music. During the game there are two commentators.
                      Probably well known people but I don't know them, but
                      that's because I life in Europe and MLB isn't on tv much
                      here :) I really liked their commentary...doesn't get
                      boring fast.
Control.....:  9/10 - I started a quick game and I noticed the controller I got
                      was the mouse, I thought better change it, but that wasn't 
                      nescessary. Controlling the game with the mouse is very 
                      easy and it's really cool. When you are pitching you get a
                      little screen with all blocks so you can aim easily, you
                      choice how you wanna pitch, for example, curve, sinker
                      etc. Point the mouse in the block where you want to throw 
                      it, press the left mouse button to actually pitch. The
                      longer you press the left mouse button the harder you
                      throw. Can it be more easy? :) 
Gameplay....:  8/10 - Playing the game isn't really hard, depends on your
                      difficulty settings though. I played with the default
                      ones. If you control the game by mouse and you are the
                      team in the field you can easily throw to all 4 bases.
                      When you catch the ball in the field a small map of the
                      field will appear on the screen and you simply click the
                      base you want to throw the ball too. If you played some
                      matches you will be really comfortable with playing the
                      game. And if you got the right players and you know how to 
                      really hit the ball the best, you will make nice homeruns
                      and win games :)
Story.......:  7/10 - This game is all about the best baseball league in the
                      world, Major League Baseball. Most people know it, so I
                      don't think I have to explain it some more.
Movies......:  7/10 - It's getting the same story with all EA games I review.
                      Like no other game from EA sports this game also features
                      a very cool intro movie, with great sounds and very cool
                      footage.
Replay......:  8/10 - This game will definately keep you busy for a while. Every 
                      time you play the game you improve your skills and will be
                      able to take on a higher difficulty level. 
                      Triple Play 2001 also features the option to create your
                      own players and put them in your team. I always like such
                      options ;)
Gender Bias.:  7/10 - I can be short with this part. The game is real fun to
                      play for everyone no matter the gender :)
Fun Factor..:  8/10 - Maybe in your first few matches you don't think it's that
                      much fun, when loosing all the time. Maybe it's because I
                      suck playing this game, who knows :) But after sometime
                      you will make the coolest homeruns and stuff and you would 
                      really enjoy playing this game.
Multiplayer.:  7/10 - I played the game on LAN, it was easy to setup and it
                      worked fine. According to EA it's possible to play this
                      game on the internet too, I didn't have the time and
                      oppurtunity to test it. 
Overall.....:  8.5/10 (This aint an average of all seperate scores)



Microsoft Baseball 2001
-----------------------
review by senator

Publisher...: Microsoft http://www.microsoft.com
Homepage....: http://www.microsoft.com/sports/baseball2001/
Genre.......: Baseball
Accelerated.: YES
Price.......: $ 39.95 (Estimated)
Demo........: 30.31 MB http://www.avault.com/bb2001/
Requirements: Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows 98 operating system, Multimedia PC 
with a Pentium 166 MHz or higher processor with 4 MB video card, 32 MB of RAM,
100 MB of available hard-disk space for minimum install, Quad-speed or faster
CD-ROM drive, Microsoft Direct 3D compliant 3D accelerator card and 8 MB VRAM
recommended 
ESRB Rating.: Everyone

Graphics....:  7/10 - During the install I was getting curious, because of what
                      the voice in the installer said: "...top notch 3d rendered 
                      graphics". Time for me to play and judge if this is really 
                      the case. Well, if they ment the players faces I would
                      have agreed with MS. The people out in the field are far
                      away from being "top notch 3d rendered".  The only player
                      that is really great rendered is the player that is on the 
                      batting place. The stadiums are not bad. The thing that is 
                      really good readable are the advertisements, why didn't
                      this surprise me? :)    
Sound.......:  8/10 - Microsoft also puts commentary in their installers, pretty 
                      original. In the menu you will hear a nice tune. During
                      the game this game also features commentary done by one
                      guy. Good commentary. I liked the crowd noises, finnaly
                      some that are not the same all the time.
Control.....:  7/10 - Microsoft did a good job on making the controls be as easy 
                      as possible. When pitching you choice your type of throw,
                      like fastball, a white block will appear on the screen
                      with a circle in it that projects the spot where the ball
                      will come. Very easy. Same with batting. You simply choice 
                      the way you want to hit the ball, normal/power etc. The
                      button to bat with is always the same no matter what type
                      you choise.
Gameplay....:  6/10 - I noticed immidiately when I played the first time the
                      batting is very hard. After the pitcher threw the ball,
                      it's a matter of 1 second till the ball is has reached the 
                      spot where you should hit it. You have to really get used
                      to it and be very fast. When you bat and the cpu pitcher
                      throws you can see if the ball goes wide or not. I don't 
                      know if this is a good thing or not, but one thing is for
                      sure it will prevent you from trying to hit balls that are 
                      wide.
Story.......:  7/10 - This game is all about the best baseball league in the
                      world, Major League Baseball. Most people know it, so I
                      don't think I have to explain it some more.
Movies......:  7/10 - It's getting the same story with all EA games I review.
                      Like no other game from EA sports this game also features
                      a very cool intro movie, with great sounds and very cool
                      footage.
Replay......:  8/10 - Because I have to be as unbiased as possible I need to
                      forget I played Triple Play  2001 :) I think when you are
                      a baseball fan and you are used to the controls I think 
                      this game is will keep you inside your house for a while.
                      Microsoft implented some nice features that also makes
                      this game partly a management game. It lets you control
                      everything from the financial responsibilities of tracking 
                      a club's payroll to the  general managerial duties of
                      fostering trades and signing free agents.      
Gender Bias.:  7/10 - No matter if you are a girl or a boy, if you like Baseball 
                      you would like Microsoft Baseball 2001
Fun Factor..:  7/10 - With actually playing the game and the management features 
                      this game will be alot of fun for the true baseball fans
                      out there. For people that aren't into this sport that
                      much, you better think twice to buy the game.
Multiplayer.:  N/A
Overall.....:  7/10

Ok, here is what you have been waiting for what games is better: EA's Triple Play 2001 or 
Microsofts Baseball 2001? 

-
The Bottomline:
Triple Play 2001. I came to this conclusion because TP 2001 was easier to
control, the game has better graphics, it features multi-player support unlike
MS Baseball 2001 that doesn't feature any type of multiplayer gaming except 2
players on 1 computer. Microsoft did a nice job of putting some management into
the game though. I like the sound of MS Baseball 2001 better than the sound of
TP 2001, it is has some more variation. Supposing the prices of these two games
are about the same, I advice you to get TP 2001. Enjoy it!

Star Trek: Hidden Evil
----------------------
review by dennison

Publisher...: Adcivision http://www.activision.com
Developer...: I don't care
Homepage....: http://www.activision.com/games/hiddenevil/ but why bother?
Genre.......: CRAP Adventure
Accelerated.: YES
Price.......: $19.99
Demo........: 24 Mb http://download.activision.com/activision/hiddenevil/demo/hiddenevil_demo.exe
Requirements: Pentium 200, 32 Mb RAM, 225 Mb hard disk space,4x CD-ROM,
              DirectX compatible sound card, 4Mb DirectX compatible video card
ESRB Rating.: T (Teen 13+), contains animated violence

Graphics....:  6/10 - Yeah it has 3d acceleration.. but the world is still in
                      2D
Sound.......:  0/10 - Blurred, lifeless voices that I don't understand wtf
                      he's saying.. lasergun sound effects, no ambient or
                      environmental sounds.
Control.....:  0/10 - You can only play by the keyboard and there's no option
                      to change the keys.. and I hate the default controls too.
Gameplay....:  0/10 - You're supposed to be following this lame storyline which
                      and solve gay puzzles, overcome stupid obstacles and waste
                      your time thinking, WTF you're doing and why you even
                      bothered to play this stupid game.
Story.......:  0/10 - Eh? You're supposed to defeat the forces of evil.. why do
                      I even bother to review this crap?
Movies......:  0/10 - CRAP
Replay......:  0/10 - CRAP
Gender Bias.:  0/10 - CRAP
Fun Factor..:  0/10 - OF COURSE, CRAP!
Multiplayer.:  0/10 - I don't care anymore, I won't spend another minute playing
                      the game.
Overall.....:  1/10

If you want to waste your money on another crappy Star Trek game, then be my
guest, but get the demo first. Don't blame me if this review is as shitty as the
game is, it's here to help people avoid wasting money for overhyped games that
only serve one purpose--to feed the pockets of money-hungry gimps who are 
already fat and rich, like Activision. I have yet to see a good Star Trek game.
Too disappointing. Even the game's catchphrase "An Epic Adventure to Save
Paradise" is lame. What Paradise??? Epic Adventure?? OH GIVE ME A F*****NG BREAK
-
The Bottomline:
Yeah so it's 30% cheaper than your normal games out there. Now you know the
reason why.
