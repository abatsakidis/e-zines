    Well! We are maybe a couple hours late but that aint too shabby with how
late of a start we got. Ndetroit is unable to make it for this week and so we
had to rally together to get this out. Special thanks to Bones, Ryche,
Blackacid, and Duranged for all their help. We don't have any super special 
items this week. Tdpriest's journal will be continued next week and we will 
also have the webpage up. The domain name was registered today and the page is
finished. So it WILL be here next week I promise. <g> Ok, I have to do the rest
of my stuff peoples. Enjoy the mag.

Biased Courier Report


Yes kids it's that time again, and it's time to have an intro again as well!
For those of you new to our magazine this is a BIASED courier group report, 
presented by yours truly, Lester. (Asst Editors Note: Gimpus Maximus)
Why do you ask is it biased? Well that's because I run a little group called 
Dimension, and I am the "Catalyst of the scene" so therefore I must live up
to my reputation!

On with the show

Devotion: Well a little change of pace, I'm starting a group other than DMS 
as my first group to report on, and you all call me biased, I really don't
understand it! Well, Norseman was running his mouth off today about how great
Devotion is doing and how they broke the FS groupweek record. Well this is all
true, but if you look closely, on any site where JD/Garoto/Dunk/Sneeze/etc do 
not get to pre, Devotion was mortal, relying 75% of it's megs on Godbless' no
life trading. Devotion was #1 or #2 on every site though and WAY out in front 
on their pre sites. So you have to give them credit. Though the non-pre'ers 
have a chronic restarting problem. :)


Dimension: D-E, D-I..see it's just midly alphabetic now! Dimension had an 
explosive week in getting back on track. Having 3 or 4 guys at least on most
every site, taking #1 group on a large number of sites or falling to 2nd on
the Devpre'd sites as well as a couple AOD pushes. DMS has the most active
traders of any group right now, using power in numbers over single powerhouses.
A change of pace for this group and we'll see how long it lasts. Midgaard also 
came back up on Easter so they have another site back up.


AOD: Yes yes, A comes before D, I know..don't message me about it. Cedric,
Glen, Tirre and Morbid. The AOD foursome continues to trade, though the mass
numbers have been declining slightly. Cedric is still dominant placing in the
top 3 on virtually every site he trades to. But AOD has not picked up any new 
talent in some time and they may be hitting the inevitable idle period of older 
traders. :) Hi Morbid!


Risc: I really pissed some of these guys off. <g> Especially a fellow by the 
name of N-crawler. Man you gotta lighten up a little buddy. Remember the AMN
days? Anyhow, other than causing a major ruckus for Risc all week. They didn't 
do jack shit on their sites. Darklogic quit because Risc assumed he gave out 
the log since he was opped in NWR's channel. Nice investigation guys. I want
to apologize to Johnny for a second though, as some of his stuff was personal 
in the log and I apologize for letting the entire scene see that. Well out of
all the people who screamed at me, I also got alot of people telling me they
aren't happy in Risc at all. So we'll see what happens in the coming weeks.


VGN: You guys should really step it up on CAT and STH and well any site you
guys are on, this is pathetic. Even worse than the OLD performances on STH.


MNM: Well..at least no one quit this week right?

DSC: The US guys, they really think they are hot shit, but they aren't yet. 
Though they do a pretty good job if they don't get any serious competition going.
up and comers maybe? Probably not though.



Well kids, that wraps up yet another week in the trading scene. Couriers are 
putting up huge numbers as the Spring rush is in full swing. Mass games and
mass utils flying out.

-----------[ Prozac's Kinda Biased Gaming Report]-----------
            

Prozac's Kinda Biased Gaming Report - #11

Welp, yet again, I'm the one that holds up NWR #41 with my late report. Some
might understand why I am busy this week. Well, my webpage is back up. It was
shut down, but it's now fixed, but I removed all the N64 ROM images because
I'm sticking just to focusing on the PC Scene. Oh wait, wrong place. I'm
suppose to talk about what's happening in the gaming scene, and a look at
each group. Welp, this week was very interesting, to say the least. Let's
take a look at the groups:

Class-
Well we start off fresh in April, and man o man, has Class jumped in front
for the month, hitting April 1st with a record amount of releases (well,
it might not be official, but it sure is a fuckload!) of 6 games in one day.
It's not even one full week in April, and Class is already up to 8 games for
the month. They've already brought in some big games for the month, but of
course in the gaming scene, it brought along some controversy.

For hours competiting groups was ragging on the release of Requiem, becuase
D3D & 3DFX was ripped out to get it under the faction rules of 50 disks.
I know some people want my stance, but I'm going to keep quiet on what I think,
because whatever I say, it'll obviously piss someone off.

Hot Releases:
Jimmy White 2 Cueball - 30 disks
Requiem: Avenging Angel - 50 disks
Virtual Deep Sea Fishing - 45 disks
High Heat Baseball 2000 - 24 disks
Baseball Edition 2000 - 43 disks
Sci-Fi Pinball - 26 disks
HellCopter - 43 disks
Sports Car GT - 44 disks

Paradigm-
Well a major blow hit PDM this week, as Sun Dancer has left PDM. This brings
up two questions: Where will he go? And what now happens in the CB Vs Sunny
D controversy? When the dusts settles, I'm sure the scene mags will have
a field day with the news. While a couple have said Sunny D wasn't a major
part of PDM, and it won't hurt them, this is wrong. Sunny D was a major
block of PDM, and it looks as if it'll hurt PDM in the long run? If you
hadn't heard why he quit, well.. go read it on TCA (http://tca.phatchicks.com).
We also saw Drizzt come back from a vacation, and immediately hit the scene
with a game. Is the '99 dynasty over for PDM? Hey, you know me, I always
like to end with speculation. :)

Hot Releases:
Grand Theft Auto: London 1969 - 17 disks
V-Rally - 22 disks
Creatures 2 Deluxe - 23 disks

Razor-
Well it's not looking good folks. We're seeing people quietly jump ship,
and the leader is still not around that much. It's pretty much idle over
there at the blade, and not much is really going on. I think this group
is hanging on a thread from disaster.

Hot Releases:
N/A

Origin-
Well, well well.. seems this group is grumbling, some might say they
are pouting. First they ban just about everyone who they distrust and
distaste from #origin. Next they grumble about Powertool backstabbing this
group (I've heard multiple stories about this). In the end, what matters
the most, not a single game comes from this group for the week. OGN, please,
bitch and moan, but everyone knows action speaks louder than words. If
you're going to bitch, bitch with dignity.

Hot Releases:
N/A

Other-
Well TPC, what can I say. This group is trying there hardest to get the
respect of the scene, but they just can't, no matter what. Just keep trying
TPC, never loose hope. What is funny is that for the month, TPC & TBT are
beating OGN & RZR for releases in April.

Hot Releases:
Speedy Blupi - 5 disks
Karate Fighter - 7 disks
Extreme Boards & Blades - 13 disks

Springer'ish Final Thoughts:
Rumor and hearsay is something that is prevelant and rampant in the scene
these days. People seem to have a lot of trust in other people in the scene,
and people, unless you've known a person for at least a year, never believe
what they say, and take it with a grain of salt. Some say, well if they're
willing to mention it on a public message board, it must be the truth! It
isn't people. We are in a hobby where are main focus is stealing software
from companies. The outside see us as thieves. Do thieves always tell the
truth, or do they lie and cheat so they can cover their asses? Or maybe
they lie to piss someone off. Who knows, but I believe people in the
scene should never believe anything that happens in the scene, especially
from a message board. Unless your instinct tells you its the truth, it
probably isn't unless it comes from at least three or more sources.

  Bud's Biased Utils Report #16
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 Emmm... lack of inspiration for intro... stuffed with food from Easter, where 
 relatives attempted to set a record for the most leftovers in history... just
 go read the fucking thing.

 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 03/28/99 to 04/03/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.


 Groups: (In no particular order)

 CodeSoft_4.20E_Win3x-PWA

 More activity following the impressive showing PWA made last week, this time
 putting out several more Intergraph titles, as well as the Enterprise edition
 of Protoview's ActiveX suite. A bit of a questionable move in putting out
 the Win3x version of Codesoft and the Lite version of SmartCD Duplicator when
 the full is available... hmmm I thought I was the last holdout to switch over
 to Win95 (only a few months before Win98 was available).

 THE CORPORATION:

 Releases:

 ChemINDEX.Addon.v5.0.for.CS.ChemFinder-CORP
 ChemMSDX.Addon.v5.0.for.CS.ChemFinder-CORP
 Pantone.OfficeColor.Assistant-CORP
 Andromeda.VariFocus.v1.1-CORP

 Faxmail.Network.for.Windows.v9.6-CORP
 Andromeda.Measurement.Filter.for.Photoshop-CORP
 Xpose.for.Visio.v1.0c-CORP

 Pretty much a mixed bag of offerings from the Corporation this week,
 including a few Andromedia filters for Photoshop, a new Pantone release,
 a Visio addon, and SmartStuff's Foolproof, which isn't what it claims.
 This one will appeal to a) Admins wanting to tighten security (aka in the
 classroom) and b) students wanting to learn how to bypass it. Smartstuff
 refuses to give trials to students, and you cannot obtain a demo without
 a voice call... but in the end the program sucks without additional security
 on you network. The lazy admins at my highschool network (which I dearly
 miss.. jeez highschool was easy) left the ability to log in with safe mode
 on. If this is the case, you can just log in and move the damn files out of their
 directory, or simply delete them, then reboot as normal. I've seen a ton of 
 requests for this app so its good to see someone put it out.

 AC2000 because they only "deal with higher end stuff", ok well whatever...
 There's been a few complaints Moldflow isn't working properly... but hell
 I was enjoying Easter chocolates and shit so I dunno the story there. ;)

 Ben (errr Death Angel) was busy this week, and as a result we see SGE
 putting out some major Lotus finals. Discounting the Solaris release
 of Notes 5, there's still some pretty impressive stuff here, I think
 they speak for themselves. Also impressive is Bryce 4 from Metacreations,
 one of the top apps in its field. Amorphium looks decent, a clay-style
 modeling app with Direct3D and OpenGL support, since the market for
 products such as this is fairly bare it's a welcome entery.

 Fabric Simulator just didn't do it for me, at least for the time being
 I'll keep buying my clothes. Actually I'd prefer a yardwork simulator.
 Ok well I shouldn't knock this too much because I'm sure there are plenty
 of Fashion/Design students who would appreciate the package, I'm just not
 sure how many will actually have access to it. XF's other rel was an AW
 Maya Live beta which I'm sure will be enjoyed by those wanting an early
 glance at the program.

 Punch_Home_Design_Complete_V2.0-SHOCK

 The usually busy SHK slowed considerably last week, starting of strong
 with a nice home design suite from Punch! Software, then dwindling down
 towards the long weekend. They duped PFT on FormTool Express, rest of
 their titles werre run of the mill... Punch! is really the only notable
 offering.

 Releases:

 Seagate.Storage.Migrator.2.52-PFT
 VERITAS.aka.Seagatesoftware.Backup.Exec.WinNT.7.3.FINAL-PFT

 In the on-again off-again releasing spree that PFT has had of late, they
 seem to be off again, with only two offerings of Seagate apps, although
 backup exec 7.3 final is an excellent release. Looks to me like they're
 saving up for the weektops next week.

 Releases:

 VDS_IRONCAD_V2.0-LND
 TIMBERLINE_PRECISION_ESTIMATING_COLLECTION_V2.6-LND
 CADSI_DESIGNWORKS_98_PLUS_FOR_SOLIDWORKS-LND

 LND put out IronCAD 2 this week, one of the top offerings in the
 CAD field, and only a few months after the SGE release of 1.4... I failed
 to make much of a deal about it then, and was flamed by CAD enthusiasts
 so I figured I'd pay special note now <g>. With an extremely popular
 visual interface, and a slew of improvements, I'm sure all users of
 previous versions will want to make the switch. DesignWorks 98 Plus
 for Solidworks and Timberline Precesion Esitmating rounded out a
 decent week for LND.

 PINNACLE:

 Releases: N/A
 
 With Kirk Hammit gone, and no one else waiting to step up in PNC,
 they're in deep trouble. Kirk kept PNC going for the past few months,
 after many (including myself) thought them dead in the water. Well
 this time around they may be, but old groups, like old habits, die
 hard... still, don't expect much activity in the near future.

 PRM was the busiest group of the week, looking more like the mass releasing
 Premiere of old. A lack of major quality titles kept them from getting top
 marks for the week, but there is a decent selection of software nonetheless.
 Akthough I must say AMF Daily Planner/PIM is pretty shitty... I'm not a big
 AMF Software fan.

 Ultimate.Bulletin.Board.v5.31-TRPS
 D-Lusion.DrumStation.v1.06.WIN9XNT-TRPS
 Complete.Cleanup.v4.11-TRPS

 My apologies to TRPS for last week, as I listed the same releases
 as I had the previous week, Mediaware titles. Instead, for issue 15,
 I should have listed the two entirely different apps TRPS put out.
 Didn't affect their score however, and TRPS is looking pretty thin
 right now. The highlist for this time round is UltraBac, an NT 
 app which is fairly popular, it's a new protection scheme for
 this version (5.01 might have had it), aside from that nothing major.
 Still an improvement though.

 point out I missed mentioning a few good Extensis releases from them, 
 QX-Tools and Portfolio. Not as good this week, still decent.

 The last of three groups I messed up on listing dirs last week, this
 time it did affect scores, as Scum released only CC Rider Deluxe...
 should have had 2 points on that, not 4. Jeez what crack was I smoking.
 This week they finally did something worth mentioning, in Centura
 Team Developer... I'm not impressed with the AS400 rel but it is legit.
 They're at least looking active.

 beta paired with a more decent release in Imagecast Server. 2KAD
 just doesn't seem to have the ability to move in amongst the top groups,
 but expect them to keep doing some decent work.

 The suprise of the week was FCN getting Acrobat 4 final done.
 FCN is a nice group so it's cool to see them grab a top title, and
 perhaps a little humbling for some of the other groups going after it...
 The rest of the week they stuck to the development/programming field,
 with some good efforts aka PICVideo Motion and ForeHTML Pro, and some
 lower end stuff such as TVicHW32 (the upgrade to which I'm still
 waiting for, hope my license hasn't run out :P).

 Idle this week: SDM, DOD, PNC, RADIUM.

 Quote(s) of the Week: 

 <Grada> LND originally started out as a label for me to release crap with

 Grad forgetting that LND started before he was in it.... oh well he's refering
 to his reign, though I have to admit, over the past month or two, LND has
 shown some major signs of improvement. This week, however, goes to SGE for some
 outstanding titles both in and out of the graphics community, and special mention
 goes to FCN, for Adobe Acrobat 4 final.

 Hope you're all not full to the brim of Easter chocolates and food... I've
 got leftovers in the fridge to last a few days anyways. That should keep
 me going... dunno what's gonna keep SDM/SCUM/PNC going however, if
 anything, they'll be needing a miracle...

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 



Movie Reviews


The Matrix
Starring: Keanu Reeves, Lawrence Fishburne
Rating: 3 1/2 Stars

Well, to top it all off, I got the Star Wars trailer again, plus Wild 
Wild West. So right off the bat you got some bonus points. I also got 
the soundtrack before I saw the film and the soundtrack is GREAT. I 
recommend it to all. Especially track #4 and #10. <g> Anyways, about
the film. Matrix is a special effects blast. Keanu Reeves is the ONLY
bad part of this film. Sure it has some holes in the plot and all,
but the overall movie is epic. I suggest you all pay money to see this
in the theater as it will not be as good if you see it on your tv, or
for most of us on your computer screen. <g>

10 Things I Hate About You

Asst. Editors Note: I thought it was a movie about RiSC and Lester

Starring: Jason Gordon Levitt and a bunch of other kids
Rating: 2 3/4 Stars


This is another 90's remake of a Shakespeare classic. This time around we
get to see a 90's version of The Taming of the Shrew. It's about a girl
who keeps as much distance from everyone else as she can, her popular 
sister who can't date unless the "shrew" does and the boys who try to
setup the shrew with a date so they can take out the popular sister. In
my opinion the shrew is hotter and cooler than popular sister but the 
movie itself is still funny and smooth running. I'd suggest a matinee
show or VCD. <g>


=----------------------------------=-------------------------------------=

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

Telesync/TS: Telesync is a procam on a tripod in an empty theater with a 
separate audio source. If there's an audience, you hear people coughing, 
camera is shaky, etc. It's a CAM.    CAM = banned. If you want a movie 
extremely early, Telesync is the way it will be.

Workprint: Workprint is a pre-release copy of a movie, stolen copy, etc. 
that usually has the film running time on the screen.

Screener: Screener is usually the BEST quality, an actual vcd of the movie, 
made from a reviewers copy, etc. Screener's are generally released after 
movies have left the theaters.


Special Thanks to Ryche of EViLiSO for the education in VCD terms, and to 
come.to/vcddupe for keeping us up to date on the new titles.

Ryche's Really Biased VCD Group Report #9

Ok, this one is going to be short and sweet because Im stoned, Futurama 
is on, and Lester's harassing me to get this done. There wasn't a whole
lot going on this week in the VCD scene so don't think Im shortchanging
my millions of fans out there. I just dont have alot to report on. 


Releases from 3/30/99 - 4/05/99

03301999 - A Simple Plan - Screener - HIGHSPEED 
03301999 - Simply Irresistible - Telesync - KRAVEN 
03311999 - Another Day in Paradise - Screener - HIGHSPEED 
04011999 - Celebrity - Screener - PMTVCD 
04041999 - The Theory of Flight - Screener - VCD-EUROPE 


- HighSpeed -

Thier only release for the week was A Simple Plan which had been 
released before as a shitty workprint and a good telesync. Its a good
movie directed by Sam Raimi with some academy award nominated performances. 
I'd recommend this one if you had any questions about the evils of money.
(I dont have these problems of course, because Im fucking broke.)

Total - 2 Points -

- KRAVEN -

Usually one of the worst of the newer groups, this week Kraven got a good
title out and they actually achieved getting it all out on the same day
unlike most of the others. Simply Irresistible is the Sarah Michele Gellar
flick that came out before Cruel Intentions and flopped at the box office.
My guess would be because she didnt say "I will fuck your brains out" in 
this one like she did in CI.

Total - 2 Points -

- PMTVCD -

Uneventful flick called Celebrity which the latest Woody Allen flick. 
Doesnt that name just make you wanna download it? I didnt think so.

Total - 1 Point

- VCD-Europe -

Yes, this too has been released before. In fact, just a few weeks ago 
if my short-term memory serves me correctly. PMTVCD put out the 70MM 
(Whatever the fuck that is) copy of it which was in my opinion a Screener
in Widescreen, but now thanks to VCD-Euro we have the full-screen screener 
of it. Joy. Its about a retard who wants her cherry popped. How does
an actor pull off such an groundbreaking role? It's easy.. stick your tongue
out, drool, flap your arms a bit and do your best impersonation of a
TFAiSO trader.

Total - 1 Point


Im gonna give the nod to HighSpeed because its a screener and its a good
movie. Kraven came in a close second with Simply Irresistible Telesync.
Im sure quite a few will disagree with me this week, but fuck you Im not 
letting a group win for a movie about a retard or a Woody Allen flick.
The report reflects the WEEK for those of you who don't quite grasp the reality
of time

--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors, we all love them even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us. And these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, your name will not be included, but we
do not add rumors like that say "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion"
because we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore
there is no hard evidence of that rumor, so if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!

-Rumor has it that Metaray, better known as Riches, has been narced by none
 other than Eagle-1.

-Rumor has it that Blackacid is an idiot, and Kirk Hammett is NOT using PNC 
 crackers for Rise titles.

-Rumor has it that CAT will be doing some major HW upgrades

-Rumor has it that the #1 US Site will be changing affils.

-Rumor has it that Sky Masterson and Ndetroit are having a gay vacation and 
 that is why they missed this week's nwr!

-Rumor has it that Core takes on the image of a Mafia family and if you
 attempt to leave the family you suffer the consequences

-Rumor has it that alot of Risc people are fleeing the ship.
