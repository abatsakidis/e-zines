    Hey hey hey... lets learn about sites and shit..  ;p

    E still not back.. and someone from OGN told me this week that
  E was only ever the the *Temp* OGN WHQ... heh.. wtf is that all 
  about? Oh well.. it still ain't back, so...

    I guess we have pretty much fallen into the predictable pattern
  of the top 3 sites in the world being FS, STH, and FH, with ET a
  close 4th... The 5th is up for grabs, i guess....
    Top 2 sites in the US have gotta be TOS and ATX... TOS is very
  well supported, and has the nice Class/Siege/DEV affils.. ATX is
  the whq for a couple of good groups, VGC, and OGN, as well as the
  (dead?) cracking group, KAC.. 

    Word has it that mgoh is set to bring TV back for a(74th?)nother
  go at it... He's lost count of how many incarnations of TV there
  has been, so this one is just gonna be called "TVx"... no word on
  whether or not TViSO will return with it...
    Speaking of mgoh, he has a new site up called.... "SEX".. not 
  overly sure what that stands for, but it's already up, and has
  Gcrack and SCUM affils already.. Cheaters beware--the sitebot
  announces bad-disks and restarts... ouch!!
 
    FF = down perm after HW problems?... i heard its only an "upgrade",
  and it'll be back..
    Not new news, but i haven't reported it here yet... SS is back up
  on a PHAT PHAT super-fast .fi link.. Affils are CORP/DSi..
    SS used to be MnM whq.. not sure if they took MnM back.. doubt it.

    I threw DF3 into the charts this week, cause i basically needed another
  good US site to round out the charts, and it has a "site lastwkup" 
  command... LAZY SITEOPS, CODE THAT SHIT IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT.. ;p

    House Of God is another good site included this week... LND/MFD,
  RZR, and AV are the affils there.. Apparently it has a pretty out of
  control daemon, HOGFTPD... The one cool feature of it that like is the
  "site vote" system that they have implemented.. Users can vote every
  week on certain site policies.. Cool idea. 

    Oh, and some other late-breaking site news: MDK is back!!... the
  daemon is up, its on the same link, and will be 2kadWHQ, DMS HQ, and
  gcrack HQ among others..  good to see... contact your favorite
  MDK siteop for further details!
    

    Siteops!! send your weektops to: nwr@netmonkey.org... Thanks
  to all those that support us every week... ;)


=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. 
	Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... 
heh... fuck off and die..

Biased Bullshit



AOD: Cedric and Blaze and a few other boys. Still, relying so heavily on 
Cedric is only going to lead them into trouble when he finally decides to 
take a break. The picked up Dthangel from DMS and that's about all the 
changes this week.


AV: Kind of winding down from the merger excitement. Jess is still preing 
and Manioc is up on a couple weektops here and there. But they are slowly 
heading back to the land of the idle I think

Devotion: Dev is still going strong..no changes this week and basically 
just so long as they get to pre and GB/Garo are around..they will be on top. 
Officedog joined dev..that's right..so they gained another pre guy! 

Dimension: A little better this week, some signs of life from the dismal 
performance of the past 2 weeks. Have started off this new week with even 
more positive things. Gregk joined from MNM. No other changes other than 
the mass cuts.

MNM: Mossyjoke is back at his pftp game..been trading 1 day and already 
caught slowupping..how sad.

I know the report sucks..sorry, I'm rushed preparing for my big day of 
trying to get Star Wars tix..I vow to be back to normal next week..:)

-----------[ Prozac's Kinda Biased Gaming Report]-----------
            


Prozac = at E3, doing his behind-the-scenes NWR coverage of the games world's
BIGGEST event of the year.. He is working hard, taking notes, dispatching
reports, and interviewing notables... (Note to prozac: that expense report
that you sent me that had "screaming orgasm x 24" in it... was that the drink?
and why did it cost so much for just a few shooters...?)

In place of the roving-reporter, we bring you:


THE BLITZ REPORT FOR THE WEEK OF 05/03/99 - 05/10/99
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Prozac is still on vacation, so I'm back again this week with my third issue 
of NWR. The week that was wasn't the most active, but we do see a game-of-the-
month candidate from Origin in Expendable.

 Paradigm owned the week with their standard all-around releasing. About the 
only thing they didn't manage this week was a trainer, probably their weakest 
area. Puma Street Soccer probably deserves a little more than a 2.0, but frankly 
that's enough soccer games thank you very much. Puzzle Bobble 2X is another 
sub-par title that was just good enough for the PDM stamp of approval. Their 
biggest release of the week was another RTS game for your collection. Final 
Odyssey is a mediocre game, but let's face it... this week was Expendable and 
not much else. PDM got the quantity and pull down first place on numbers.
 PDM stole CLS's points for The Operational Art of War II. CLS was docked the 
entire 4.0 for failing to fix a game within a reasonable amount of time. The 
two F1 racing fixes were deducted last week, so they won't hurt them now. The 
patch team got yet another Warzone patch (how buggy is this game anyway?).

 One of the biggest titles Origin has ever landed, Expendable makes their week 
(and month most likely). Nothing at all from the rest of the team all week, it 
makes you wonder why there are more than 5 members in this group. The 
trainer/patch/USA teams have almost nothing to show for May thus far. The 
long-anticipated arrival of Cyric from Razor finally happened, giving this 
group more punch in Europe. Still no USA suppliers around, but a step in the 
right direction to be sure. After being snubbed by Smokey for PDM, Origin had 
to be feeling good about getting this proven supplier over PDM and CLS. Give 
the assist to TK4, but we'll hold the fanfare until Cyric manages a title in 
his new group.

 Class ties with Origin for the week on the back of one release plus extras. 
Shattered Light is yet another RPG in the sea of RPG's we already have. I've 
heard it spoken very highly of, but it looked pretty run of the mill to me. 
Regardless, it's a fine game to try out if you have finished the award-winners 
already. RPG's take up so much time I can't see anyone picking this up over 
LOL3 or Baldur's Gate, but I guess this one got ripped. Four points with the 
addon. Class shows a little attention to detail with a patch for Expendable. 
Really a minor thing, but let's give credit for the small touches. Joystick 
is nice with this one, so it's not irrelevant at all. Note that last week's 
Championship Manager 3 "fix" was actually a patch. It wouldn't change anything 
though, since a NT patch or fix still means nothing except someone gave a shit 
to make it.

 Divine made it back into NWR this week, but not in the way they would like. 
If sites nuked games for minor updates like they do for utils, Heretic 2 v1.06 
would be nuked anyway. But DVN had a better way to get themselves negative 
points, how about we pack without the nfo file? Shit, even Warrior remembers 
the nfo file (what happened to those guys anyway?). To cap it all off, our 
good friend ttol, ex of Razor managed to put out a dupe of ASS. Yes folks, 
sites everywhere were spewing out [NUKED] DUPE_ASS. The couriers could 
hardly contain themselves. Rumours that the release was stolen from an ASS 
dropsite are as yet uncomfirmed.

============================================================================

 Well, this week's first interviewee needs no introduction. He's the leader of 
Razor 1911 and one of the best suppliers the scene has ever witnessed. Currently 
retired on his own island in the South Pacific, The Punisher took some time to 
speak on a variety of issues for our readers.

<NWR> Hello Punisher, and thank you for agreeing to do a NWR games interview 
this week. Let's start off by stating your full nick and past and current affils.

<The Punisher> The Punisher - Razor 1911, Drink or Die.

<NWR> Razor 1911 is indisputibly the best known name in scene history. How did 
you come to join Razor 1911, and what is your position there currently?

<The Punisher> Actually, the story behind me joining Razor is kind of interesting.
I didn't want anything to do with the scene originally, however I decided to 
donate a 4 gig SCSI drive to a Razor site back in 95 to be able to leech what 
I wanted when I wanted.  Turns out I was forced to earn my credits, (still trying 
to figure that one out), having time on my hands then I smoked all the current 
couriers upload stats on the sites and was invited to join Razor as a courier 
by my friends Vitas and Sir Alf.  So I was couriering for a good while and 
doing quite well at it when I managed to figure out how I could supply Razor 
with the original Quake.  After succesfully doing so, I decided supplying was 
my route to the top.  Many titles and a year later, I supplied Red alert (c) 
Westwood Studios and TSR decided to make that title his going away ride.  
With his retirement came my getting the opportunity to run the group.  I have 
since retired and returned and now I am in a state of limbo.  I still run 
the group, but not like I used to.

<NWR> Like so many in the scene, you got your start as a courier. You are 
probably one of the last people who I would have expected to start as one. 
I was not around when the scene made the transition to the internet. What 
is your take on the transition from BBS's to sites? Has it hurt or helped 
the scene?

<The Punisher> I've always been a person who believed in the theory that a 
good leader will lead by example.  "Follow me!" instead of "Go ahead!"  I 
started as low as I could possibly go and earned my way up.  I got a lot 
of grief from others who weren't couriers that liked to put me down at the 
time saying I was just a simpleton courier, but after beating every supplier 
on their own turf (their best company to get games from), and being voted 
#1 PC game supplier of all time, I think I've proven my point.  As far 
as BBS's and the Internet I believe it's a mixed bag. The BBS's were much 
more secure and personal, people know who each other were.  Scene parties 
were much more flagrant and get togethers were encouraged between the elites.  
Now it's terrifying if someone get's your phone number let alone your full 
name. I'm not going to bag on the internet however, it has revolutionized 
the scene in more ways then one. It has brought everyone mainstream and 
given even the newbies a fighting chance against the old conglomerate 
groups like Razor, Class, Paradigm etc.  I think that competition breeds 
quality and revised methods of thinking.  Something we didn't have with 
the boards.

<NWR> Quake and Red Alert are both huge titles. What other blockbusters 
have you been able to bring in for Razor? 

<The Punisher> Oh hell, let me think...Heavy Gear, Comanche 3, Star Wars 
Rebellion, Interstate 76, Grand Prix Legends, recently Midtown Madness and 
Xwing Alliance, over 140 titles altogether from me. However, I seriously 
doubt anyone wants to read about me patting myself on the back...

<NWR> It's good that you bring up X-Wing and Midtown Madness, because I was 
going to ask you about those two titles in particular. My collegue Prozac 
and I have noticed Razor tends to still have the ability to find the top 
titles like those, Starcraft Brood Wars, and others. With the resources to 
get titles like that, why aren't we seeing more quantity to go with the quality?

<The Punisher> Well, I'll be honest.  There is a lot of talent in Razor with 
no one to guide it or hone it into a blade, (excuse the pun), I had more 
time when I wasn't concentrating on my career and paying off all those 
fucking bills.  I guess the time hasn't come for someone to take the initiative 
to carry the group to a new level.  I come around when I can and supply what 
I can when I have time, but that's not enough to keep a group alive.

<NWR> What do you say to the critics of Razor, those who say "they aren't 
what they used to be? Is it unfair to compare the Razor of today to the 
great teams of the past?

<The Punisher> For the most part the scene today is based on groups 
revolving around one to two insiders with the occasional store pickup. 
Class does it with Hemp, Prozac and Skill and Paradigm with Leno, Zeus, 
Drizzt... Razor, with yours truely being the lucky person and Origin 
claims not to rely on one or two people but at the same time they can't 
compete in the US market and never will without USA insiders.  So no, 
it's not fair to compare... in the past Razor had a team of suppliers 
and crackers instead of one or two to count on.  If one method fails, 
goto another if all else fails call the insider and get it from him.  
A chain reaction so to speak of supply methods.  That still exists but 
not as effectively.

<NWR> If the groups today are indeed supported mainly by a few people, 
why do we still see 20-30 members in each group? What do the rest of 
the people do?

<The Punisher> Different things I guess...cannon fodder on one hand, or 
card suppliers, organizers, couriers, people that used to do shit and 
dont anymore, people that promise to do shit and never do and a few of 
them are actually friends you enjoy having around.

<NWR> A lot of the people in other groups were surprised to see ttol as 
a Razor member this month. From what I understand, he was at least 
partially responsible for your release of a dupe last week. One of 
your other active suppliers left to join Origin, apparently over some 
mishap with ttol as well. Although it was rumoured that Cyric was leaving 
Razor for some time, what happened there, and why was ttol offered membership 
in the first place?

<The Punisher> Actually, I don't know why he was invited to join Razor and 
he was responsible for the dupe that he stole from TPC's shell unbeknownst 
to any other Razor members.  Cyric left because of those actions he says 
but he joined Origin awfully quick.  Since I'm familiar with the recruiting 
game, I'm willing to bet it would have happened anyhow.  TTOL was given 
the boot and life goes on.

<NWR> It seems that Paradigm and Class have really broken free from the rest 
of the groups this year. Origin does their UK games, and Razor does the 
odd big title, but those two groups take all the rest. Why do you think 
that we're seeing two groups dominating like this? In the past we would 
see 4-5 groups putting out titles, but now it's a surprise when a US game 
is not put out by PDM or CLS.

<The Punisher> They've got the talent, the determination, and the force. 
(couldn't resist since Phantom Menace is so close).  Realistically, they 
are on the swing this year and more power to them.  Things change and people 
change, it will happen and you will see different outcomes as always.

<NWR> The scene is constantly in flux, as you mentioned. Groups rise and 
fall, and suppliers come and go. Yet Razor's membership stands virtually 
unchanged month after month. Is Razor still seeking fresh blood? Who will 
carry the torch in 2000 if you are semi-retired?

<The Punisher> Good question, if you find someone with a decent resume...
please send him my way. :)  I'm not sure really...only time will tell and 
I may be back full swing sometime soon.  At this point I highly doubt it, 
but you never know.  

<NWR> Who does the day to day work in Razor? If you don't have the time, 
who is on top of the store games every day? Who tracks down the patches, 
kicks the crackers in the ass? Does Razor have people working on the smaller 
stuff, or will we continue to see only your big games?

<The Punisher> The day to day chores are handled a little bit by everyone.  
Toast has been a great asset to the group as well as Jkowall and Shinobi not 
to mention others.  We do still have one of the if not the greatest crackers 
in history who we all know as Beowulf.  Not to mention Wolverine, Beep, MrNop 
and a few other crackers who we recently recruited.  Razor will continue as 
it is and with the flow of games from myself and others will do what we can 
to bring the scene the quality it has come to expect from us.

<NWR> Last week NWR spoke to ][ce in this space. He has been one of the most 
vocal opponents of Razor. Although he has always been a handful, there is 
no doubt that he and Cypher can and do supply many games. What happened 
with them leaving Razor, and why all the bad blood?

<The Punisher> Ok, lets get it out...Ice (I refuse to spell it with the ][), 
and the babbling no english speaking Cypher situation.  Ice and Cypher were 
a great asset to Razor at one point and they carried a lot of the weight of 
the group.  Ice is a fantastic supplier that still needs to learn some people 
skills and what fights to pick and which to pass.  (funny me saying that, 
everyone told me the same thing)  Anyhow, he will eventually someday grow 
up and get laid for once and lose the brash attitude he carries.  Ice and 
Cypher tried to split Razor into Razor US and Razor UK and wanted to run the 
Razor UK part of the group which was unacceptable.  It's Razor 1911...period.  
They didn't agree and felt like it they had single handedly changed the world 
of Razor somehow which albeit they supplied a great deal, wasn't going to 
happen.  Then came the point of the seniors meeting which even though I was 
retired I was invited to join since I had originally recruited Ice for Razor.  
It was a tragic mess, everyone fought and nothing was solved, Ice asked me to 
pick sides and I refused to do so since remaining neutral would have been the 
only thing for me to do since I was inactive.  This upset him at me personally 
for a while and they eventually got the boot from the other seniors.  The 
reality is I had spoken with Pitbull, (leader at the time), and The Speed 
Racer (friend and advisor), on a conference call and I was against them 
being booted since I felt it would really hurt the group.  But the decision 
was out of my hands and they were toasted.  Seeing how they reacted to me 
personally as well as the group which had helped them in more ways then one 
really upset me and left a bad taste in a lot of peoples mouths which is why 
they eventually had to form their own group since no one else wanted them.  
Now they are doing great...more power to them.  I wish them the best of luck.

<NWR> I'd like to thank you for taking the time to speak to NWR today, do you 
have any final comments or greets?

<The Punisher> I'm really glad to see Lester is doing something productive 
and hopefully this scene mag continues to grow.  I don't do interviews very 
often so you should all feel honored. :) Only greets I have are for my real 
life friends from the scene and the Razor family.  Oh yea, I'd like to ask 
everyone to message The Renegade Chemist on irc and ask about his fucking 
couch. That has to be the ugliest god damn thing I've ever witnessed.


============================================================================

 Lechucky hasn't been around for as long as The Punisher, but he has done 
something few others have managed to do... put a dent in the Origin stronghold 
known as the UK. We get his thoughts on the state of Class, the Thrust, Twist 
and Turn release, and more.

<NWR> Hello Lechucky, and thank you for agreeing to do a NWR games interview 
this week. Let's start off by stating your full nick and past and current affils.

<Lechucky> Lechucky - Class - Fairlight - Aod

<NWR> Class has been a very successful group from their creation. How did you 
come to be a part of Class, and what is your role in it today?

<Lechucky> Well close to a year ago, i contacted a friend in Class, as i noticed 
i was able to get games early enought to be able to supply and wanted to give 
it a shot at supplying. he UK is a very hard place to supply from but it has 
worked out towards our favor a few times, my role today in Class is still as 
before, Supplier.

<NWR> What are some of the games you have done in the past?

<Lechucky> The games i am most proud of are Championship Manager 3, Warzone 
2100 and F16 Agressor, although i cant really stand Championship Manager 3, 
find it so boring and slow. It was a long awaited game, and a funny supply.

<NWR> Last week, NWR had a chance to interview ][ce of Origin. He and Cypher 
have been the ones most active in the UK scene, but Class has gained a 
foothold there of late. Is the UK still Origin's backyard, or will CLS be 
taking more of that pie for themselves?

<Lechucky> Well Origin will always have a the upper hand in the UK as things 
are now, and they do a pretty good, the balance latey has tipped away from 
them, its a hard place to supply from and not alot of people have been able 
to supply constantly, I think for now its there backyard for now but unlike 
before were they didnt have to race when a game came in, they have to now to. 
Its only been this year ive been able to become more active, Studying and 
working and trying to juggle a girlfriend isnt the best combo for a supplier :]

<NWR> A lot of people who have the same hobby we do tend to get so wrapped up 
in it that their other lives suffer. I know people who have dropped out of 
school because of the scene, or made other sacrifices. You mentioned your 
girlfriend and your studies... does she know what you do?

<Lechucky> For me, studies will always come first, no matter what... oh and 
my girlfriend of course :). I only wanna go through this studying shit once 
and not ever come back to college.  But i understand how some people can take 
it all a bit to seriously but its not worth dropping out of college for, its 
not somthing worth giving up the finer points in life (i.e shagging) and 
theres always the risk factor but like alot of things No risk, no fun.

<NWR> Class has a reputation of being very difficult to communicate with. You 
have no public channel, and even for people who have been around for a long 
time in other groups don't seem to know much about you. Why the seclusion? 
Is it for security reasons, or are you all just naturally unsocial?  

<Lechucky> Well if you remember back Class used to be public chan even tho 
it was +m at all times, after a few take overs the channel went +i. I dont 
think its seclusion, if someone really wants to contact us there is a way, 
and most people in the scene know a few members (love or hate us), its not 
really a security thing i thing... well i dont think so anyway. Its More of 
one less agro to deal with. As channel takeovers can be a pain to deal with.  
I always try to be helpful if i ever get msgs with someone having a problem 
with one of our releases and try to reslove any problems for them but 
sometimes you cant help certin people there just plane dumb.

<NWR> Recently the scene has seen a lot of fixes for games. Paradigm's Formula 
One required two official fixes last week, and your release of The Operational 
Art of War 2 went unfixed by CLS for over 5 days. Fixes are unfortunately 
a product of the need for speed in today's competitive scene, but why do we see 
CLS ignoring the need to fix their games more frequently than other groups?

<Lechucky> Well fixes do happen, they're a nasty thing and no one likes it when 
one is required, but when a group is in a rush, wanting to win on a game, over 
looking a point, not testing all the possable funcations. It happens to all 
groups at some point, sometimes you wont know it needs a fix until later on in 
the game or how the game funactions (i.e settlers 3 / gangsters ). 
With The Operational Art of War 2, yeah Class fucked up on that one i'll be 
the first to say, i didnt know it needed a fix until the pdm one was out.

<NWR> Last week we saw The Player's Club release a game from the UK in Thrust, 
Twist, and Turn. I've already asked ][ce what the hell happened on that one, 
as Origin or yourself generally nail down those UK titles before a group like 
TPC would have a chance. TPC seems to have been unable to continue their 
success into this week (no releases), but Grind seems to think TPC has a 
chance at those titles now. What do you feel about TPC's chances in that 
tough market?

(The Thrust Twist and Turn section from NWR46 was pasted for Lechucky)

<Lechucky> Hmm well i dont like taking away anything form TPC and there great 
work on TTT, but with ice/cypher (fast bloody limeys) and me it will be very 
hard, but maybe not impossable to keep their work up. There's alot of factors 
which are against them, one being the ever increasing protections on games, 
in the past some games have been in the stores for a good few days before they 
were cracked.  Also there's only a hand full of crackers in the scene that 
can deal with these ever increasing and changing protections in a fast manner. 
I guess were only have to see how well they do in time, i wish them all the 
luck, the more compation the more fun it gets.
 
<NWR> There have been rumours of internal trouble in Class lately, and even 
talk of a break in the crew. Is this just wishful thinking, or perhaps 
recruiting propaganda? Are there problems in Class?

<Lechucky> all i can say all groups have problems, its the strong ones that 
work out the problems and keep going.

<NWR> Last month Class put out Requiem - Avenging Angel. The game was really 
solid, but some of the other groups cried foul because of the D3D/3DFX being 
ripped and released as addons. My opinion on the matter was that it was a 
good enough game to circumvent the faction rules your group abides by, but 
it raises the question... are the Faction rules out-dated?

<Lechucky> Well, releases like Requiem will always cause a stir and bring 
up new questions, should the faction rules be updated or changed? There 
have been a few releases done in the past in the same style as Requiem... 
i.e releasing the working game and making addons for the brand of 3d card 
you have, or doing 2 releases 1 being the software, other the 3dfx etc. 
PDM [has] done it with Redguard a while back, i didnt see anything really 
wrong with it. For now i think chaning the Faction rules is not needed and 
would be silly :). 

<NWR> A lot of couriers read this scene review, and there is a lot of talk 
about the Devotion/Class/Siege relationship and how it affects the power 
base of the courier scene. What is the relationship, and why do those 
three groups tend to occupy the same sites?

<Lechucky> Well take a example, Garoto, he is in all the 3 groups you said 
above, and I dont think anyone can dout his trading skills, and I've worked 
with him on a many times and has done a great job, a few times we would 
have lost if it wasnt due to him, i think your find the relationship is 
well earned.

<NWR> Last month, CLS made up for a poor showing in the year to date by 
winning the month running. China Blue publicly announced prizes for the 
best supporters of your group last month. I've spoken to a few CLS members, 
and they were unanimous in saying they were definately thinking about 
those P3's when wondering if they should spend time tracking down a title, 
or go to the movies. CLS has so far maintained that momentum into May. 
How much of a dropoff if any do you think we'll see this month? 

<Lechucky> well of course when ever there is a prize like that, were all 
human and of course it will enter a suppliers/crackers mind, but there 
was The same effort put in by me as i do every month regardless, if you 
take a look at the past 2 years, there was hasnt been any sort of prize 
then and we still saw a Strong constant showing by Class. I dont think 
there be a drop off, we can speak all we want about it, but only time 
will tell show.

<NWR> Where do you see yourself a year from now? 

<Lechucky> Well, I think a year from now rips will be still going strong, 
and were gonna see a new generation of protection schemes. so crackers will 
have their work cut out for sure. I dont think iso will take over anytime 
soon,  I hope i'll still be in the scene.

<NWR> I'd like to thank you again, Lechucky for agreeing to speak with us 
today. Do you have any final comments or greets?

<Lechucky> Thanks for having me, wish you guys all the luck with nwr and i 
hope you keep it up, greets to all of my great friends in Class, Fairlight 
and Aod, and also to most of the hard working groups in the scene 
pdm/rzr/ogn etc. personal greets to, ofd, lgb, sun tzu, hemp, cedric, 
Thargon, xfrog, ][ce(die), Gal, morbid(fat), gollie and everyone else or 
somthin :)

-----------[ Bud's Biased Utils Section ]-----------


Beats me where the fuck bud is... ;p
Think he's at E3? ... i dunno....
Lester is pissed tho, cause we haven't gotten a single review
of VGC yet.... heh...

Come back, bud, for god's sake... or grad will want to do the
report.... ... ... (he *is* the leader of the #1 CAD/CAM util
group in the scene, you know)...

Come back, or we will bring JJ out of retirement...... ack!!!


=----------------------------------=-------------------------------------=

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 




The Mummy
Starring: Brendan Fraser
Rating: 3 Stars


The Indiana Jones for the 90's. Though this is based on the Anne Rice novel. 
Pretty gnarly effects and a decent cast to bring together this story about 
a really old guy who tries to destroy the world to get his girlfriend back. 
jeez..now every girl is gonna want their guy to do that..sigh god damn 
hollywood does it again.


------


Election
Starring : Reese Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick
Rating: 2 1/4 Stars


MTV Films brings us yet another youth driven flick. There are some quality 
jokes and one liners in here, but the overall movie and tempo is not so 
great..also there's a little too much attempted depth for an MTV picture. 
<g> I'd suggest renting or vcd..because it IS funny


=----------------------------------=-------------------------------------=

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.


Special Thanks to Ryche of EViLiSO for the education in VCD terms, and to 
come.to/vcddupe for keeping us up to date on the new titles.

Ryche's Really Biased VCD Group Report #13 


Ah yes, I am back. Here's a few sample comments from people about 
NWR without me.

<Anonymous> SUCKED
<Anonymous> SUCKED
<Anonymous> SUCKED


  Never fear fans, Im back in action and better than before! The itching 
and swelling has gone down and Im peeing clear again. This week we saw a 
new report pop up doing its worst imitation of this one. Call out the NWR 
Lawyers! They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but 
not when it sucks as bad as that one. Don't be fooled, NWR is your true 
VCD Group report source.
  
  Sometime last week, a few of the VCD groups got together and had a small 
meeting (fight)about some new rules, which some groups did and some groups 
didn't agree to. Basically its over the Telesync and whether they have to 
have PERFECT sound to be considered a TS or with out perfect sound its a 
CAM and should be nuked. I have news for you guys, a Telesync IS a cam. 
Its just a good one. There is almost ALWAYS some flaw with each one. Whether 
its the audio, the picture, the slanted screen, etc. No one considers them 
Cams unless theyre just absolutely horrible and unwatchable. Nice try to 
enforce rules on people and sites that dont give a fuck though. Kudos for 
acting like a real scene for once.. 

  One thing I would like EViLISO to address, however, OWNS is that lately 
Ive taken YOUR some heat ASSES for being a little "too" biased. I dont 
think BOW Im too out of line DOWN and I try to be as AND fair and WORSHIP 
even in the report as possible. Almost every group has had good THEM weeks 
and when they did, LIKE we do a good job of THE letting the public know 
about GODS it. Everyone has THAT good weeks and THEY bad weeks. And no, 
I do not, despite what people ARE say, use subliminal messages in the 
report. 

  Was actually a slow week in VCD but Ive thrown in some goodies this week 
like an interview with two of the members of DTD, about porn VCD's, and 
the Wired article on George Lucas' concerns over net piracy with my 
commentary included. Now, without further ado..


Releases for the Week of May 3, 1999 to May 10, 1999 (Yes, I missed another 
week, so what?) European Translation: Releases for the week of 3 May, 1999 
to 10 May 1999


050499 - Pushing Tin - Telesync - VCD-EUROPE 
050599 - eXistenZ - Telesync - EVILISO 
050699 - Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane - Telesync - NOTCTP 
050799 - She's All That - Screener - EVILISO 
050899 - Entrapment - Telesync - EVILISO 


- VCD-Europe -

Well theyve gone to releasing telesyncs which is off from thier normal stance 
of mostly screeners. This is the trend for the european groups this week. 
Pushing Tin is the Billy Bob Thornton and John Cusack movie about Air 
Traffic Controlers. Comedy is what I think it was supposed to be.

- Total 2 Points -


- NOTCTP -

Yeah, right. Its not Centropy. Really its not. Another example of one of 
the Screener groups releasing Telesyncs but not wanting to "soil" thier 
image by doing it under thier own name. Instructions: Pull down pants, 
stick from ass. Blood and Guts is an action comedy that mixes violence 
with being funny. What a concept.

- Total 2 Points -


- EViLISO -

EViLISO released a few things this week, the most recognizable being 
Entrapment. Now all you horndogs can watch Catherine Zeta Jones stick her 
ass through the lasers at home where you really wanted her. Other releases 
this week were ExistenZ (WTF?) which is a movie directed by David Cronenberg 
(whacked out freak who made The Fly, Scanners, Videodrome, Naked Lunch)
about virtual reality and wierd shit like actually plugging yourself in 
through your belly button or something. Strange. She's All That? Well.. 
the IGN screener wasn't all that so we get another screener of it. No 
points for it though.

- Total 3 Points - 


Group of the week? EViLISO for ammount of releases and for Entrapment, 
which was on the most wanted list of the week. Hopefully next week will 
give me more to do. Until then, read this over and over.



                                       Wipe them out. All of them..

DTD Interview by Ryche


This week I continue the Porn VCD Group Interview series with a fireside chat 
with Xarion and K|Z of DTD (#dtd) who are a newer group in Porn VCD. I didnt 
get to interview them together but thier respective interviews are here in 
full. Xarion is a senior in the group while K|Z is one of thier top encoders. 
I'd like to thank them both personally and if I met you in person I'd probably 
shake your hands (if you washed them a few times first maybe). Support your 
local porn group!


------------------------


<Ryche> Ok, tell me who you are, where you come from, and how DTD started.

<Xarion> well, I should start with how it started, the main founder Dalamar 
was recruiting members, and then I and a few others joined.. from there it 
was going to be a 0day and ISO group, currying and releasing whatever we 
could.. but then Dalamar had to move, and things really slowed down.. it 
was dead for a while, and then Fobsolo, Night-Owl and myself tried to get 
things going and we started getting sites, couriers and just get things 
going again..

<Xarion> as for who we are, well DTD is really a release and curry group.  
Since it started off as a curry group, we are still doing that, but we are 
also releasing VCD's (xxx of course) :) just for fun.. but that also brought 
us to currying VCD's as well, so we do a lot of things 

<Ryche> Where did you guys come from? other groups.. or just hanging out 
in chans over here?

<Xarion> well, a lot of it started off with people in public channels, 
because that's where Dalamar was recruiting.. once the 3 of us picked up 
the group since Dalamar was not here for so long, the 3 of us were 
getting people from groups, and friends who were in groups, etc..

<Xarion> so far we've had 8 XXX vcd's released.... 3 of them were Jenna =)

<Ryche> So I take it most of you are Jenna Jameson fans?

<Xarion> hehe, yeah... and we will be doing a bunch more Jenna flicks soon =)

<Ryche> So are you guys a buncha young cats or a buncha old pervs with hairy 
palms?

<Xarion> well, we are not a total XXX vcd group.. DTD stands for Dominant 
Trading Division, we have just released XXX vcd's so far because they are 
easier than say apps and games.. we just had a few members who were able 
to rip them, so we decided we would release them to build DTD to what it 
is now, and it seems to have worked :)

<Ryche> heh, but no comment on the hairy palms thing.

<Ryche> Is there any kind of porn you guys wouldn't release? fisting? horse 
fucking? nuns with whips?

<Xarion> haha... no, we aren't a bunch of freaks =) we stick to normal, but 
hardcore porn..

<Ryche> Nuns with whips isn't normal?

<Ryche> err.. lets move on..

<Ryche> Do you think theres too much porn on the net, or do you live by the
too much is never enough rule?

<Xarion> well there is a lot of porn on the net, yeah =) but when we started 
releasing there were only a few other groups, so as for VCD porn, there isn't 
that much really.. there has been a few new groups popping up.. but, IMO 
too much is never enough =)

<Ryche> So do you spend alot of time with your porn collection?

<Xarion> haha, no...

<Ryche> Do you get alot of requests for certain movies/actresses/actors?

<Xarion> yep... that is a big reason for the Jenna ones, a lot of people like 
her so we like to release what people like to see.. and we usually release 
what people request too, if they are good and well known..

<Ryche> Whos your personal favorite besides Jenna? any up and cumming actresses 
we should know about?

<Xarion> hmm... probably more of Shane, Chasey Lain, Stephanie Swift and 
Saint

<Ryche> Do you guys get alot of flak from other porn groups? Is there alot of 
cutthroat competition like there is in ISO/VCD?

<Xarion> nah.. to us it's mostly just for fun.. since there isn't really a 
porn "scene" or a big one like ISO/VCD anyway, there isn't much competition, 
not in our eyes anyways..

<Ryche> Not much competition as in DTD owns all these worthless faggot ass 
groups, or as in not a whole lot of releasing groups at the moment?

<Xarion> nono... a lot of our members know members from other groups like 
pornorder, pornolation, and tok.. we don't think we are any better than any 
of them, or think they are worthless faggot ass groups.. hehe

<Ryche> Awww come on.. you dont hate any of them?

<Xarion> hehe... there is just one group, heaven.. new group I guess, and it 
seems they are releasing PPV porn's ..those are censored, which is pretty 
lame to release... that's the only group I can think of =)

<Ryche> CENSORED?!?!

<Xarion> hehe, you don't see any of the action, you hear the chick but you 
don't see whats happening..

(Note to self: Nuke Heaven releases 100x)

<Ryche> Those are nuked immediately though right?

<Xarion> hehe, well we don't put them on any of our own sites, but i've seen 
their releases staying on some sites...

<Ryche> Oh thats something I wondered.. what are your sites like? Are they 
just chock full of pics, avi's, porn vcds, etc?

<Xarion> nah... no pics or avi's or whatever, hehe... just the porn vcd's.. 
but since we curry as well, ISO's too.. we are not total porn freaks =)

<Ryche> Sure your not Xarion... sure your not. Keep telling your therapist 
that.

---------------------

-K|Z is one of the main encoders for DTD and was nice enough to give me an 
impromptu interview from the "working class" of perverts. <G>

---------------------

<Ryche> whats it like being in a porn group?

<K|Z> dunno it's like going to a store
<K|Z> you don't want to be seen going in

<Ryche> HAHAHAHAA
<Ryche> so you guys dont want anyone to know your in DTD?

<K|Z> no DTD is fine cuz we're curry's
<K|Z> but if we had a name like PORN-DTD
<K|Z> i wouldn't hang in that channel
<K|Z> my sister drops by and shit
<K|Z> she can read irc

<Ryche> how olds your sister?
<Ryche> never mind, next question..
<Ryche> so are like everyone in this group a buncha undercover pervs hiding 
as a curry group?
<Ryche> or just a curry group acting like pervs?

<K|Z> perv's hiding under curry group name
<K|Z> we're the old guy nekkid under the trench coat

<Ryche> So you were saying earlier to me that the XXX scene isnt organized. 
Edge- from Pornolation was telling me that there really hasnt been alot of 
dupes or races yet in the scene. Is it getting tougher or just full of more crap?

<K|Z> yah it's not organized, i'd like to see some organization...hopefully 
some of the established groups, deciding on something or other...
<K|Z> i haven't checked out the new stuff released
<K|Z> so i can't say if it's more crap
<K|Z> or not

<Ryche> Porn rules(!) ?

<K|Z> what is valid
<K|Z> are old stuff okay
<K|Z> does it have to have known stars
<K|Z> if they should have sample files
<K|Z> or not

<K|Z> it's not telesync so why'd you need a sample file? as far as i know there 
is no TS pr0n releases yet.

<Ryche> I wouldnt think cam recording in a porn theatre would be that big of 
a hit anyway 
<Ryche> instead of seeing someone get up and walk away and hearing coughing
<Ryche> youd see splooge on the camera lens and hear a buncha people going 
"UHHHHH" in the audience.

<Ryche> Whats the wierdest porn you ever saw?

<K|Z> I don't watch weird porn...

(Editors Note: Yeah, right..)

<Ryche> Do you think porn vcd is just a fad or its here to stay?

<K|Z> it's here to stay, the net is infamous for nekkid pictures, xxx vcd 
is just one step up

<Ryche> Do other iso/vcd groups take you guys seriously or are you looked 
down upon because you release porn?

<K|Z> wow that's a tough one...don't know really...they don't really care 
i suppose

<Ryche> Do you encode your own tapes or image original vcds?

<K|Z> 2 of our releases were images from original vcd, but as for me i encode...

<Ryche> Do you get alot of people coming in the channel begging for porn?

<K|Z> unfortunately we do :P, but that's like any release channel, mostly 
we get people asking for a certain rar file...

<Ryche> Anyone we would know? or we could make fun of?

<K|Z> anyone you would know? uhhhh no they all wear caps sunglasses, and a 
fake mustache when they come in here.

<Ryche> You ever get a guy named Lester begging for "Animals Who Love Men?" 
or something similar?  How about people with the hostmask of @r0cks.risciso.com 
asking for anal exploration videos?

<K|Z> No, but i'll keep a eye out for em

<Ryche> Whos the hottest new porn star we should be downloading and watching?

<K|Z> dunno, it's all a matter of opinion now isn't it? depending what you 
like...we try to release different stuff now and then...
<K|Z> different types of pron , not just the usual vivid stuff

<Ryche> well in your opinion, whos a hottie thats just a dirty slut? :)

(Editors Note: No chinablue and jess jokes) <G>

<K|Z> jenna's a dirty slut, (I don't like girls with silicone) oh shit i'm 
gonna get killed for that comment :)...doubt she can feel it...she'd feel 
mine though...uhhh most euro girls are nice cuz they have real tits

<Ryche> eurogirls? like who? gimmee some names!

<K|Z> anita blond, and sylvia saint..

<Ryche> Ill be looking for those two then..

<Ryche> Well, its time to wrap this up.. anybody you wanna give a shout out 
to or say suck it to?

<K|Z> suck it? hahaha ..shout to people who actually do shit to make the 
scene better, iso release groups, mp3 release groups , vcd release groups 
etc... cheers mate, it was fun talkin to yah.

<Ryche> Uhh.. yeah, same. :D

=----------------------=

Ahhh... another fine mainstream media article.. this one is from our good
friends at wired.com... you'd think they'd get it right, after that dead-on
"warez" article they did a few years back about the (shocking!) warez 
scene, and its massive use of the "usenet" as its main technique for
file transfer... *sigh*... that was strike one.. i suppose this article
is strike two... would someone please put wired news out of their misery? ;p

                     Lucas: Net Piracy Is a Menace
                     by Joyce Slaton 

                     (as printed on www.wired.com)


                     Eight bucks is a lot to pay for a movie,
                     but it's a small price next to a jail
                     sentence. 
                     
                     (NWR: This opening line must have taken about 
                     2 seconds and one brain cell to come up with)

                     That's the message being sent by
                     Lucasfilm, which has enlisted the FBI's
                     computer crime task force to fight its war
                     against Phantom Menace piracy. 

                     "We have referred certain matters to the
                     FBI," said attorney Terrence P. McMahon,
                     whose firm, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe,
                     is Lucasfilm's Phantom piracy
                     representative. "We are combining forces
                     with law enforcement and the motion
                     picture industry to attempt to eliminate
                     the distribution of bootleg and pirated
                     copies of Episode I." 

                     Calls to the FBI for comment were not
                     returned. (NWR: How surprising)

                     Lucasfilm's piracy fears aren't
                     unwarranted. The first Phantom trailer
                     spread online faster than pinkeye in a
                     kindergarten class. It was uploaded onto
                     fan sites mere minutes after its release. 
                     (NWR: duh, Lucasfilm posted it on 
                     www.starwars.com, what'd they expect?)

                     Company insiders fear that Web piracy
                     will make a serious dent in its theater
                     receipts. Piracy is big business, says Ken
                     Jacobsen, vice president and director of
                     the Motion Picture Association's US
                     Anti-Piracy Operations. He estimates that
                     pirates cost the motion picture industry
                     US$3.5 billion worldwide every year. 
                     (NWR: Sigh, another ESTIMATE. Based on what?)

                     "What's ironic is that pirates are hurting
                     themselves indirectly," Jacobsen said.
                     "Making movies is such an expensive
                     proposition. If income is not made, then
                     new, good films won't be made either. It
                     damages the industry as a whole." 
                     (NWR: What?! No more Barb Wire? No more
                     Ernest Saves Christmas!? Say it isnt true!!)

                     Wary from watching what MP3 files are
                     doing to the music industry, moviemakers
                     are determined to stop pirates from
                     diluting their trademarks and draining
                     cash from their coffers. 
                     (NWR: Heaven forbid they should make less
                     than 200 gazillion this year)

                     "Pirating has long been a problem for the
                     movie industry, but now with the
                     widespread use of the Net it becomes an
                     even [more] heightened concern,"
                     McMahon said. He claims there have
                     already been indications that pirates plan
                     to post illegal copies of Phantom online. 
                     (NWR: Everything is posted online morons)

                     "Anybody with a computer is potentially a
                     pirate," said Frank Creighton, antipiracy
                     chief of the Recording Industry
                     Association of America, who has learned
                     a thing or two about Net piracy in recent
                     years. "With a click or a keystroke, you
                     could be distributing unauthorized
                     recordings to hundreds, if not millions, of
                     users. The potential for financial damage
                     is exponential." 
                     (NWR: If you have millions of users on your
                      site, its time to make some cuts)

                     The process of pirating films is certainly
                     simple enough. Sometimes a studio
                     employee steals a copy of a
                     yet-to-be-released movie for duplication,
                     but more often a projectionist or movie
                     watcher uses a camcorder to record the
                     movie at a theater showing. Once that
                     video is transferred into a digital file and
                     uploaded, it spreads like a virus. Just ask
                     the makers of The Matrix and
                     Entrapment, two movies that have been
                     making the digital rounds via college
                     campus networks. 
                     (NWR: This is where Joyce Slaton uses what is
                     known as literary license. Entrapment hadn't
                     been released on the net yet when this article
                     was posted, throwing out what little credibility
                     the article might have had)

                     Complicating matters further is the Net's
                     international reach, Jacobsen said. 

                     "The seller of a pirated film could be in
                     Malaysia, the buyer in Germany,"
                     Jacobsen said. "The laws in each area will
                     be different, they'll be enforced
                     differently. How's a copyright holder
                     supposed to enforce all these different
                     laws in the far-flung locations of our
                     cyber-swapmeet?" (NWR: Hint: You can't)

                     Perhaps that's why Lucasfilm has
                     seemingly decided that the best defense
                     is swift offense. Last week Lucasfilm
                     representatives sent letters to about 700
                     ISPs, warning them that unauthorized
                     distribution of copyrighted material on
                     their servers would bring swift retribution
                     under the aegis of the October 1998
                     Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The
                     prospect of Lucasfilm and attorneys
                     swooping down on noncompliant fan sites
                     is a scary one for Star Wars fans -- but
                     not as scary as the possible outcome of
                     rampant piracy. (NWR: Please use retribution
                     on the bastards at my ISP. I keep getting
                     disconnected)

                     "The fans need to listen to what Lucas
                     has said about piracy," Jacobsen said. "If
                     no income is generated from this movie,
                     we won't be seeing the next episode." 
                     (NWR: You dont really believe that do you?)

-----------[Blast from the Past!]-----------

Here is another in the NWR series of "Blast From the Past" articles, where
we hope to share some of the scene's rich and coloured history with some of
the newbies out there... ;p
The full text of these interviews can be found in INQ-5 and 11 for those 
of you who are interested...


/** The Scenario: It's late 1995, and its a battle to the death between
 Razor1911, and Hybrid for games supremacy.. There was not a lot of love
 between these 2 groups, and even less love between them and TDU-Jam..
 Hoson is the leader of Hybrid, at a period many considered to be the peak
 of HBD's run... **/


INQ   : Who founded Hybrid and when?            
Hoson : I founded Hybrid together with a german guy called LowTec back in
        Winter 1993.
INQ   : So it is an Euro group correct?  
Hoson : Yup, correct.  It used to be ran from Europe, but a few months back,
        Bluewater and his old CD group, Dynamix, decided to join us.  So, I
        guess you can say it's not Euro based anymore, but both US and Euro 
        based.
INQ   : If you were to rate Hybrid in realsing vs. TDU, RAZOR, ECLIPSE how do
        you think you stand?
Hoson : Well, I personally think that our releases are the BEST, they are
        nicely packaged, most of the time.  They work, we have a cool intro,
        and all files fit onto 1.44 floppies.  TDU releases have the ugliest
        NFO file, and Razor CD-Rips are a bit unprofessional, but they seem to 
        get better.  Eclipse, well I'm in Eclipse as well, and since there's 
        not so many floppy titles anymore, Hybrid of course releases alot more 
        stuff.
INQ   : What do u think of RAZORCD and do you think they pose a problem in 
        competition?
Hoson : Yeah, they got a good grip on UK and US, so they pose a real threat,
        but it's nice with competitoin.  The good thing about CD-Rips is that
        not just anyone can go and release a CD-Rip.  You have to work with 
        the game before you release it, and since Hybrid has the best crackers 
        (Randall Flagg, Cyber, Excessive Knight et cetera), we often win 'coz we 
        crack and rip them quite fast.  To be able to crack and strip CD 
        titles, not only must you be good at cracking, you must also know alot 
        about game programming and Assembler coding.
INQ   : Could you rate the CD groups from best to worst?
Hoson : Yeah sure, 1. Hybrid 2. Razor 3. TduJam 4. hmm.. are there any others
        worth mentioning?
INQ   : Will HYBRID stay in the games scene or branch off to utils, since 
        there are alot of utilis on CD now?
Hoson : Games only.  Never utils.  I hate utils, 'coz 75% of all utils are not 
        useful.  Most util releases sux.
INQ   : Who do you think has a better grip on suppliers TDU, HYBRID, or RAZOR?
Hoson : I think RAZOR and HYBRID.  TDU - nah.
INQ   : Do you think HYBRID will ever merge?
Hoson : No, I don't think so.  Merge with whom?  RAZOR or TDU?  Haha.. 
INQ   : Who are HYBRID's offical couriers, and do you think HYBRID with ever 
        have a couriering section?
Hoson : Well, we don't have any official couriers, since we don't really need
        them.  I mean game releases spread themselves, and we already have
        quite an impressive courier section with BBS/Internet couriers.             
INQ   : IF Hybrid were to have official couriers who would it be?
Hoson : RiSC
INQ   : Any big releases from HYBRID in the near future?
Hoson : Yeah, I've got a few aces up my sleeve.  A few big titles we're getting 
        inside, but I'm not gonna reveal the names coz it would look bad if I 
        said we were gonna release a specific game and then perhaps Razor or 
        TDU would release it.
INQ   : Why does HYBRID's realses tend to have virii?
Hoson : VIRUS?  Hmmm...  They don't.  I know Caesar II had a virus in the
        VESA.EXE file, but it wasn't in all versions.  I heard something 
        about a virus in Fatal Racing as well.  I have no virii on my 
        computer, so I doubt it contains one.  It might be my encryption of 
        some .EXE files that some virus killers identifies as possible 
        viruses.
INQ   : Do you guys have or planning to have a web page?
Hoson : Yep, check the pre-web page out at: www.tripnet.se/~electro/home out.
INQ   : What about the DYNAMIX MERGE.  What are your feeelings show?
Hoson : Well, without that merge we would probably not have released ANY of
        the US releases that BlueWater, ChainSaw M., and Celestial Wizard put
        out on regular basis, so that merge was a big leap for us.
INQ   : Didn't Chainsaw M. leave RAZOR for HYBRID?
Hoson : No, he didn't.  I don't think he ever was in Razor. :) 
INQ   : What is the WHQ?
Hoson : Park Central is our WHQ.
INQ   : We're going to name off a few things - I want ya to give me your 
        opinion on the topics we name off.
INQ   : Razor 1911/Razor CD
Hoson : I'm sceptical; they don't deserve that name, but they do release alot 
        of good games. 
INQ   : TDUJam
Hoson : Very ugly NFO file, really cool intro, terrible installer, way too
        many non-working releases.
INQ   : Utils Scene 
Hoson : Lame.  NTA always release cool stuff though. DOD are kinda cool, but
        they put out to much SHIT that no one downloads anyway, it just files
        for traders so they can earn their credz... bah!
INQ   : The GEcko
Hoson : The Gecko?  He is a nice guy!  I was in NEXUS together with him for 
        one month or two.
INQ   : Eclipse
Hoson : Cool!  Good style, good release if not to many lately.
INQ   : Courier Scene
Hoson : Don't know too much about it.  What's so fun with a courier group?
        Getting famous for pumping meggage here and there.  Nah, I'd say 
        they're excessive, but RiSC's cool.  Good FTP sites and stuff.
INQ   : FanFan
Hoson : Don't know him personally.  He might be a nice guy, but he's probably 
        one of those who doesn't stand being defeated.
INQ   : Well we don't want to name off all your competitors.  :)  So I would 
        like to thank thee for your time and efforts to INQUiSITION.  

This interview was conducted by GFK and Riot on Sunday, October 29, 1995. 


/** Park Central was the Hybrid WHQ at the time, and most considered it the
 best board in the world.. RiSC was still dominating the scene, a phenonmenon
 that would not stop until amnesia unseated them several long months later..
 Hybrid went idle for a while after this interview, and Rzr1911 more than 
 picked up the slack.. **/

.....
...
 (several months pass)

... ...


/** The scenario: It is early 1996, and the BBS is dying, if not dead. 
Razor 1911 was still dominating the games scene, and CLASS/PARADiGM weren't 
even ideas yet... Hybrid was in a downward spiral, tho they would have one 
last gasp at greatness before finally succumbing to complete idleness 
(remember xmas of 96/97, when they kicked some major ass, releasing, among

Judge DRedd Interview With: The Speed Racer [Razor 1911]

INQ : Do you think that now as Cyber Angel and Tyranny are retired the floppy
      scene is dead?
TSR : As far as the floppy scene goes it does look dead.
INQ : As for Hybrid?
TSR : Hybrid, I don't see releases from them in over 2 weeks, I know they owe 
      some suppliers, including Zeus money for his phone bill.  :)
INQ : Well we CAN NOT assume; it is not official is what you're saying, right
TSR : I havent seen anything from them in over 2-3 weeks let us assume they
      are.
INQ : So now as TDU is gone and so is Hybrid, do you and the Razor crew see 
      any more serious competition?
TSR : At this moment, we see no visible competition but who is to say what 
      lies in the future.  I am not really worried about other groups coming 
      out.
INQ : Yes, I have to admit myself I think Razor's member list grows day by
      day?  Any new patential suppliers?
TSR : We are always on the lookout for potential suppliers and people who can 
      contribute to the group in a positive way.
INQ : What do you think about some new groups like LEGACy, ENERGY, NAPALM, 
      et cetera?  Do you think there will be any competition?
TSR : Energy is a group that supplies sporadically mainly because they are
      only German; they have no contacts in the US or UK which is where most 
      games come from.
TSR : We have a diverse group of suppliers and talents managed along with
      great resources at our hands that makes us a force to be reckoned ith
INQ : There was a rumour that you were gonna quit the scene after 1995; you 
      did not what are your plans now?
TSR : OK, what I did do however is distribute a lot of my duties around to
      other members giving them some added chores which would help the group 
      out, so that nothing would be lost since I dont have the time to do so 
      much.
INQ : Now back to Hybrid, what do you think was the major reason they're
      dead?
TSR : Well they don't have to many "decent" suppliers and financially they are 
      BANKRUPT.  I heard that they were going to file a petition to Chapter 
      13; I'm still waiting on the final word on that subject; fortunately 
      under my guidance we have successfully maintaned a great budget, due to 
      creative financing at RAZOR Industries.  We find that we are in the 
      positive side financially with money saved.  :)
INQ : Yes, that's a very important aspect.  Well good luck to you and Razor in
      the future.  It's not that often we can find you on IRC anything you'd 
      like to add to our readers?
TSR : Yes, actually.
INQ : Please.
TSR : I would like to especially thank the fans who worldwide download our 
      games and play them, as we enjoy putting out these games for them.  :)
INQ : OK, I'm sure there are a lot of people who do play the games you put 
      out, and before I let you go, I have one more question.
INQ : A lot of readers are wondering, now as it's 1996 and things change who 
      is the REAL leader of RAZOR 1911?  As a leader I mean a person making 
      the most importanat decisions, now that EOS is gone who's left?  You 
      and...
TSR : Well we don't look at it as a single leader, because it is a group 
      effort, and we are a team where we draw from each other's stregnths and 
      patch each others weaknesses, but if you wanted to look at it that way it 
      would be Pharaoh, Third Son, The GEcko, and myself.  :)
INQ : OK, we wish you luck in 1996.  Thanks for your time!
TSR : Thank you very much :)  We enjoy getting every issue of yours since 
      Druidkin ALWAYS puts out your issue on email to all the RAZOR guys on 
      the net
INQ : And as always RAZOR 1911 is on the top of the scene.  This was an
      interview taken on the IRC with The Speed Racer.  We all wish him good
      luck and health in 1996 and I guess we'll finish it right here.  Thanks 
      for you time.
TSR : My pleasure.

	* This was conducted by by Judge DRedd on January 7, 1996 *




/** Of course CLASS started up soon after, claiming several good razor and hybrid
members. ZEUS ended up leaving hybrid, to start his own group.... i think that he
ended up calling it... .... PARADiGM?... ;)   Razor Floppy and RazorCD ended up
merging into one group (just razor1911), and TDU-Jam did not make its intended
comeback under the infamous Fanfan La Tulipe... (though some say that Hybrid
was re-incarnated-- as the limey power, ORiGiN!!!!)   **/

                       are scene-friendly, and got some decent deals... only
                       reason why i mention is cause the dude was fat enough

-Well... i still don't see bleem out on the market, only further supporting
 my claim that bleem = all a hoax... ;p

-"citizen" of RiSC is doing surprising well in the US, #1 on a lot of good 
 sites... Of course, he's also the #1 restarter on all of them, so... blah
 to that shit.. ;p

-I see dthangel/ben left DMS after indignantly protesting the kicking of the
 incredibly idle nitro... i remember once when dthangel said to me something
 to the effect of "that fucking cock-sucking queer can suck me, cause i'll
 never be in another group with him again"... shortly after the first breakup
 of gcrack... nice to see those 2 bitches patched shit up.. ;p

-thats all for now.. aye-aye, and goodbye... ;p

--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors. We all love them, even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us- and these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, (your name will not be included), and we
do not add rumors like "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion" because 
we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore there 
is no hard evidence of that rumor. So, if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!


-Rumor has it that things got a little out of control the other day when
 Caserd went over to play barbies at Lester's house, and lester's mom
 gave them both spankings..... uhhh... who gave us this rumor...?!?!?

-Rumor has it that greyline is going to release the full source code to
 his much celebrated (maligned?) daemon, GLFTPD.. It will not be an open-
 source project however, and the "official" version will be maintained
 by greyline. No word on whether or not a certain infamous feature will
 be included.... ;p

-Rumor has it that several old RiSC members (now prominent AOD/DEV members)
 are getting set to return to the RiSC nest, under the leadership of eagle_1..
 yeah... right.... ;p

-Rumor has it that Chinablu is set to have yet ANOTHER child.... but in a
 shocking twist, this one is NOT via her husband of several years... no!..
 This one is the love-child product of her long-time secret relationship with
 bwound of TAW!!!!
