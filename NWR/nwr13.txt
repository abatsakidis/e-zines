                       The Netmonkey Courier Report
                                 Issue XIII
                         July 5th - July 11th, 1998



	Hey hey... here we are. Back another week. Phear some more,
 and stuff...
	
	So there was a lot of crazy shit going on this week in the scene. 

First off, Digital Overload got narked. I won't go into the details of that, 
but I think that it was pretty safe to say that DO was the best US site out 
there. At the time of its demise, DO's affils were: Razor USHQ, Siege WCHQ,
and Ambition.

Boy, the US just can't seem to make its comeback, eh? On top of DO's narking,
United Center was down for most of the week. Again. So, its been left off
the report this week. 

But, back in action is Firesite. Sooo fast. Its up there on our x3 section. 
Also added to the list is WTC, cause i couldn't think of another deserving
site, and dee said he'd beat me up if i didn't add it. <g>
 (check out archive.pheared.com if you just can't get enough of dee, he's
 looking for articles, and ezines, and old .nfo's and shit...)

=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
	Anyways, here's the way its done: 		
	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. We total it all
 up, and rank the 10 best couriers. And because we are only using the top 
 sites out there, you can rest assured that they are the scene's 10 best. 
	Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... 
heh... fuck off and die..
=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=


  the top ten sites for this week are:

  x3 STH -*- FS -*- E -*- MW -*- NMS
  x2 MSV -*- TMS -*- ET -*- LA -*- WTC

=-----Lester's Biased Section-----=


Well It's time to write again, weeks go by so damn fast, NWR is back as
you all noticed last week, new guy is doing the calculations and things,
so that's good. Once Blackacd is off his ass, this WILL be on his page
in it's own area,etc..etc.. but who knows when his fat ass will do it.
Until then I'd say just look for NWR or I think archive.pheared.com has
them every week. I told BA i'd put that i'm a supporter of his little
lamers online bullshit, but I am not gonna do it till i see my part
of the page:)

So let's move on

Dimension:  Well do I even need to say anything? MGD is like back to his
old tricks, severely raping the competition, and the rest of the guys are
kicking ass too. DMS broke the alltime groupweek record on FS and did
some other cool stuff this week. So I'm happy. 

Risc:  Well hrm, Brain and Thug are trading, but not a whole lot, and
Risc is really basically fucked in the ear.

Devotion:  Well with acidapple/native/garoto and sneeze pre'ing, Dev put
out a decent performance, they tried to beat DMS on MW this week, with
about 250 megs of Sneeze pft's pre's, but they fell about 200 megs short.
But still alot better than before. So good effort guys:) 

Ambition: Losing Acidapple was a big stake in the heart for them in my 
opinion, and the loss of Do, etc. AMB took somee hits this week, we'll
see if they have  the power to come back strong.

Millennium: Uhmmmmmmm, Roller. Somewhat of Dual, and well basically a Risc 
mirror otherwise:) But Roller is doing well:)(pftp!..hahahaha <kiss kiss>)

That about covers it I guess, hrm, we had some cool things go on this week
so let's get to that shall we?

DO was narced and is gone possibly for good, so we mourn that loss of
 a very good US site. Erm, Snakeeyes is like making a comeback, and supposedly
no cheating this time, so let's all watch closely. Biggy is gay, I thought
i'd go ahead and throw that in here real quick. Reflux is back or
something, not courier related, but somethiing worth mentioning I suppose,
Seems Atomic-X has disbanded and reformed NGT, looks basically the same to
me only NGT and not A-X, so go figure, still not much  trading going
on. I've decided I may have to bust a move and pass brain on E again,
but it may be another few months before I actually get around to it,
so watch your ass brain:P (should give him something to talk about:P)
it appears the NWR folks are ready before me this time, so I'll close up
shop. Enjoy
