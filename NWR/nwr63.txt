Woot, woot, pretty big issue this week, a new section we are going
to experiment with, the mp3 report..if you'd like to do the rock side
of it, to help powertool out with it. Devestato is back and has a 
double issue for us to make up for last week. Bud is out of action
this week and so myself and with a little help from Elocin fill in
for him. Enjoy the mag kids. We also have a pic of what Glen
does in his spare time included in the zip.
BTW, editor note. Kdogg is not Draft, our apologies for the
mistake

Biased Courier Report

Well I'm here again, next week we will have 2 special guest writers 
to do this, and if they are any good I'll let them take over, cuz 
this is definately getting to be too much work. Pretty soon I'll 
be doing the vcds and games :(

Owell!@# enough complaining by the editor, time to talk some shit


Amnesia: AMN has by far it's best week in a long time, owning HOG by 
over a gig and placing well on E. They also do a fair bit of damage 
on the other sites, pulling down 2nd and 3rd places on a number of 
sites. Most notably are Glen, Nail and Darkangel for doing so well on
sites. It will be interesting to see if they can continue this new 
trend. Especially with Lester trading!@#!#@$@#!. Pullin down a 
nice #3 on HOG and nothing else I think:( But anyhow, AMN has it's 
best week in a long time here.

Overall: I can see clearly now the rain is gone. (6/10)

Ascension: Well, Drunkkid is their main star, but they had a few 
other guys pop up on the 8-10 spots of a few sites. This group is 
still alot of hype and little follow through. Though word on the 
street is they have alot of boxes, but very little coordination 
to follow it up.

Overall:  That don't impress me much! (2/10)

AOD: AOD continues along unphased with the ASN splitoff. 
Cedric pre's his little fat ass off and pulls down #1 on alot of 
sites. Bizzybone and Tirre come out of the dust and bust out a few 
weektops as well, and then they also have the usual Darkwolf 
presence on sites. Overall a normal week for AOD, nothing 
extroadinary or bad happened to them.

Overall:  I want it that way...OH TELL MY WHYYYYYYYYY..er.sorry..
(7 1/2/10)

Devotion:  Godbless continues to roll along like he's Garoto on 
steroids, and we also see Wishmaster back in action after a long rest. 
Which allows Officedog to take a break apparantly, Dev appears to 
believe only in trading in pairs. <g> CYBRWOLF is also trading, but 
we all know how bad he sucks. <g> Dev remains on top though for the 
majority of sites with AOD knockin em down a few times.

Overall:  Restart my heart!@# (8/10)

Risc: Wow, like 4 ppl in Risc are trading, and Bender is also back. 
Which puts Risc in a decent little position of actually having done 
some trading. They were all over the ET weektop. Anyhow, still not a 
dominant trader, althought Psedo had himself a big end of week 
performance to boost his ranking and Risc's as well.

Overall:  God, it's late I can't think of a song..(5/10)

Vice: Little bit of citizen, little bit of Redman, little more of 
Mrp..nothing spectacular from the boys though. I hear Redman is a 
vice leader now though, so big congrats to him. Anyways, Vice
still maintains that loyalty that they are known for..so you can't 
knock em much anymore.

Overall: Little bit of Nailz all night long, a little bit of 
redman bla bla bla..(Mambo #5)..(5/10)



Welp, nice little themed shit..and pick the one that isn't a song 
and you win absolutely nothing

BYEBYE

===========================================================================

THE Devestator REPORT FOR THE WEEK OF 10/11/99 - 10/17/99
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not many releases this week, but be prepared for a boatload in the coming 
weeks as the christmas season draws closer.

THE RULES
~~~~~~~~~

- Games are rated on a 0-5 scale. The average rating for a game will be 3.0. 
Games are rated on how good the game is, and how anticipated the title is. 

- Fixes are punished by deducting half the points for the game. If a competing 
group fixes the release, they recieve those points. If a fix is very minor in 
nature, or is embedded late in the game, a single or no deduction is possible. 

- Faction compliancy is NOT required to recieve points. If a faction compliant 
rip is released at any time without having essential gameplay components 
removed, it will supercede the previous attempt. 

- Trainers for games that rate higher than 4.0 will be given a half point. 
Only one trainer per group, per game can recieve points. This includes 
level skippers and cheat codes, as well as editors and multiplayer cheats. 
A truly remarkable trainer for a major game could recieve a full point.

- Patches are worth a half point. Major patches for important games could 
recieve a full point.

- Addons for games are given a 1.0 addition provided the addon is not:

  (a) a movie addon of any kind... or
  (b) An essential component removed for faction compliance (3DFX)
  (c) For a below average (under 3.0) game
 
Any group may release a game addon, regardless of the original release group. 
Multiple addons packed within one release (a speech and music addon for example 
may be given two points.

Wow, seems like DVN took over CLS's job of releasing a lot of crap 
stuff, and then doing trainers for the crap, like anyone cares about 
training crappy games. But I guess it gives them second place for the 
week.

A Nice 5.0 from Origin this week in GTA2, and finally someone did a 
Pong trainer. :-)  Can't give them any points for that Rollercoaster 
Tycoon addon, since it's not standalone, and if they would have put some 
time into it they could have made it that way.  Dynasty came behind 
them and cleaned up their mess.

Ahh finally a group who releases! Shock continues
to massively rape the SFS line taking a few more
Siteforum releases. Nothing special to say about 
those though. Webdev is a nifty little item. I seem
to remember PC Reseller from last week though, so
maybe we'll see them do one every week now<g> 
(PRM syndrome) And other notables are Maclan, the
first new version in over 6 months. Overall a medium
range week for the Shock boys, but they do find enough
releases to stay active in a relatively slow week.

 DataKure.2000.Pro-PNC

Well PNC continues their little run of
medium range titles. Little AutoCAD plugin
is neat, but nobody uses Acad anymore if they are 
smart. ERDisk hasn't been released in some time, 
so good job to them for bringing that back and
taking something from the Aelita line away from MFD.
And they grab another version of Infinity Power, they
pretty much have that line covered. A fair share of
medium range titles but nothing special this week.

Wow, 2 DOD titles and none of them are AV software.
Who would have thought. Java Web Server is a decent
little program and I have no idea what Cerebellum does,
and I dont think anyone else has ever released it. <G>
But it's good to see the old boys do something.

RBS continues to gain momentum and put out some 
truly nice apps. Most notably would be Partition and
Boot Magic from PowerQuest. RBS also grabs a few
titles that most ppl wouldn't use but they get alot 
of credit for grabbing the finals from PowerQuest.
Unfortunately CLR Script was a dupe of GWA. 
Also good to see the new version of ArcView GIS.

 SEGUE.LIVE.QUALITY.V1.3-SCuM

 
Well we can see the Lotus supplier went to SCuM with
SJ and the ex-siege boys. Not a great deal of hype
behind the .1B versions though. We do FINALLY see
a 100% working fix of Cimatron 10.5. After many
groups talked about fixing it, Scum fixes what 
they messed up when they were in PWA. So kudos for that.
Jade Developer studio was rlsed by PFT as 4.1.55,
not sure what the difference between 4.1a is and that.
A few more Vision Jade's, nothing really special but
Pads Powerlogic and Applix are good titles. A decent show
of releases but more high end utils could be strived for.
So not exactly the kind of quality we expect from SCuM 
recently but not a terrible week either.

FCN continues to knock out a shitload of apps, the
real gem in here is the PSX development kit which
allows you to design your own PSX games. Most of 
us netmonkies probably aren't cool enough to do that
but you gotta give em credit for the app. FCN also
rapes the Protoview line with V7 all the way around the
line. We see a Clarion 5 Inet Connect, not sure
what the difference in that is other than XF's Clarion 5
Enterprise Suite. A bunch of Delphi Addons and Goodies,
but Ulead Videostudio is what really stands out with
the PSX kit. A Good week for FCN, large amount of output.

Rise slows down from last week, but they grab Siteworks,
one of the better titles of the week and an update for 
Solidmaster. They also grab Archicad V6.0R5 which is a
very sweet title and Steelcad 16.01 to top it off.
Another decent showing but more titles could have been
pumped out and there was no real need for ArtGem. (nuke)

 Welp, the week is tied with Scum and Rise as usual, my personal 
thoughts were that Scum was a little bit better, but Elocin chimed 
in with his that Rise had better quality releases, and so we decided 
to go with a tie. Good work to both groups and honorable mentions to 
Shock and FCN

Game Recognize Game's MP3 Reviews - Issue #1
=========================================================================
Allright, well, here is my first installment of (hopefully) many more.  Mp3's have
become a part of the scene more than ever lately so it's about damn time we had a 
report for it, right!  I plan on featuring reviews from the top titles (in my eyes) 
rom each group.  Like all other reports in NWR, this is biased as well, so respect 
my mind!  Each week, I will also give my top pick as well as some hiphop noteable 
quotes.  Well...lets get this show on the road...

=========================================================================
Hot Title Of The Week Goes Too...<drumroll>.....Lil Wayne - The Block Is Hot (CFC)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lil Wayne, in my humble opinion is the most lyrically talented artist on 
Cash Money Records.  With his clever story driven sound effects, he sounds 
almost as if he is a cartoon character.  Manny Fresh once again brings out 
his arsenal of beats to create a musical masterpeice that seems to fit in
with Wayne's flesh hungry lyrics.  From the opening intro, you hear the 
normal Cash Money gloating about their money and the way they spend it in 
their own beautiful way.  Next up, the title track for the album, The Block 
Is hot.  Here, Manny digs in his archives and samples UNLV's "Drag'em In 
The River."  The sample is fitting over Lil Wayne's sly vocals, although I 
think he could have turned himself up a bit.  At some parts in the track, 
the beat becomes too overpowering, so much that you cannot understand Wayne's 
lyrical assault.  The next impressive track off this album is song number 5,
 entitled Kisha.  This is a tale about how each member of of the Hot Boys has 
sex with a little freak named Kisha, describing the sexual acts she performs o
n them.  This is the best 'story" track from the CMR camp that I have ever heard.  
The next two tracks, High Beamin' and Lights Off both songs to ride to on a 
night on the town.  Track 7, entitled Fuck The World is my favorite track off 
the entire album.  In it, Wayne talks about his everyday struggles over a soft, 
rhythm and blues beat produced by Manny Fresh.  The next notable track is Enemy 
Turf.  In this song, Juvenile and Lil Wayne state that they are ready to go to 
war with their enemies at any time, any place, and anywhere.  Rounding out this 
chewy morsel of ear candy is the final track on the cd, titled Mike.  Lil Wayne 
and Turk hit hard with more punch than Hi-C.  If you are a fan of Down South 
Bounce music, than this is a must buy.  Even the Eastcoast hiphop heads will 
appreciate Manny Fresh's producing abilities.  There is a little something for 
everyone on this album, which will make this a classic Cash Money Records release.

=============================================================================
And the rest of the pack....
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
98 Degrees - This Christmas (RNS)

     On the heels of last years N'Sync Christmas album, comes 
     98 Degrees - This Christmas.  I am not going to to into detail on this 
     album because you already know what to expect.  Your standard Christmas 
     tunes are sung by the worlds #3 boy group, 98 Degrees.  There's nothing real 
     spectacular here, although the album will sell a decent amount of units 
     based on it's 14 year old teenage fans alone.

Master P - Only God Can Judge Me (RNS)
     First off, I already told you my report is biased, so deal with it.  I don't
     even consider Master P even an artist.  It's hard to find any lyrical content 
     whatsoever between his "UGHHHHHHHHH's" and "Bowdy Bowdy's".  I will be honest 
     with you on this, I listened to 7 songs on the album, and said "enough." I 
     deleted this from my hard drive ASAP because it's just random garbage.  Master P 
     has been saying the same verse over different beats since 1994.  My advice, don't 
     waste your money on this cd, unless you're the 12 year old suburban whiteboy who 
     listens to this incoherent nonsense.

DJ Skibbles - Traffic Jams 2000 (RNS)
     Everyone's favorite MTV DJ is back with his sequal to Traffic Jam.  Overall, 
     there is quite a good mix of songs here.  I especially like the track with 
     Juvenile and BG - 187.  Here's a solid cd that's worth the buy, however if it 
     gets stolen or something unfortunately happens to it, it's not worth the second buy.

Various Artists - Cross Country Riiiidahz (ERB)
     A decent mix here from the South to the Westcoast.  I particularly like the new 
     music by Big Syke and SSP.  The Gigalo Skilloni Remix with RBX and Shiesty is pretty 
     good as well.  This record would be even hotter if Diamond Life Inc could master.  
     Throughout the cd, their are annoying pops and fizzes.  Maybe after they sell a few 
     copies of this album, they can find something to master with:)

Various Artists - West Coast Never Dies (ERB)
     Ahh..another album from the Deff Trapp label.  Seems like they put out an album 
     every week.  Nothing new here at all. All are cuts previously released as well as 
     a joke of a Makaveli bonus song.  You all may remember Trapp from his butchering 
     of other 2 pac and Notorious B.I.G songs.  Stay away from this album..if you already 
     own it, I feel sorry for you.

Hopefully, there will be more next time..but I am getting too tired to type.  Notice, 
there wasn't any APC releases listed.  Sinned Soul didn't want them in it, so if ya got a 
problem, message him and give him an earful.  tS is also not included because they are an 
amature group that releases xing rips as well as steals rips off the internet etc.  I 
didn't include RageMp3 and CMS respectivly because I ran out of time, hope to get to you 
next week guys.  Also, if someone wants to add rock/dance reviews to the report, message 
me on IRC and I'll give ya a shot.

Lastly, here are some hiphop quoteables...

"Cuz you heard me on the radio, seen me on the TV, If you get me drunk enough, 
I'll eat that pussy like a Kiwi" - Tash

"When it comes to dissing my shit make Makaveli sound like Macarena" - Chino XL

"I was told two wrongs don't make a right, but three rights make a left" - Ras Kass

"I pull up in the expedition they be like ah no, no, no he didn't" - Lil Wayne

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 


Bringing Out The Dead
Starring: Nicholas Cage, Ving Rhames, John Goodman, Patricia Arquette..etc..
Directed by: Martin Scorcese
Rating: 1 3/4 out of 4 stars

Well, I must say I haven't been that disappointed in a long time. 
Cage and Scorcese?
With that kind of supporting cast? Oh my, there are some truly 
funny moments in this movie but it does not even come close to making up 
for the drug out slow parts of this movie. Cage is good as he can be, and 
the moments where they drive in the ambulance are probably the best parts. 
Ving Rhames with Cage has to be the best part of the film. But overall NOT 
worth the money to see it.

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is  usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear  people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination  of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.

Ryche's Really Biased VCD Group Report #22


<IdyllWild> I have come to the conclusion that the Utils report is rigged.


Oh how low we have sunk.. Has anyone noticed the DVDRIP scene and theyre 
extremely leet releases? Let's see.. Cliffhanger, Blast From the Past, 
Life, The Negotiator. Nice. Only problem, theyre all crap or dupes of 
screeners already released. Jeez man, get a real scene or do something 
unreleased for once. Kids with DVDROM drives acting like a releasing
group. Please, we beg of you.. stop it.

Another super week in the VCD Scene.. sigh



CENTROPY

Another great week for Centropy. That makes 2 in a row. A first for this group in the 
history of the report so let's break em down (gettin jiggy) for the viewing public. 
Mystery, Alaska is the film from that guy who writes all the TV shows David E. Kelly. Its
sitcom type funny about a amateur hockey team who gets to play a pro team. Slapstick 
humor but the movie's a dud. Plunkett and Macleane missed it's mark by about 1 year. Its
a period piece about a robin hood team from ye olden days. This shit mightve flown last
year when Shakespeare in Love and Elizabeth had everyone going to see this type of crap.
This year, if theyre not being chased in the woods by a psychic kid who sees the dead, it's
not gonna make money. Screener tho.. thats nice. New Rose Hotel eh? Nobody knows what this
is but we do. Its a VERY limited release that played in NY in early October starring
Christopher Walken and William Defoe in another of thier washout roles. Its about a 
future where companies and gangsters fight over biological patents. Even Chester Cheetah
would say this one is cheezy. The one good thing that did come out of all this was
the redo of one more of VCD-Europe's fuckups in the Generals Daughter re-release. Grab
that one, its the highlight of the week. (Unfortunately)

Total - 3 Points



TiLT

This no-name group graced us with one more of thier releases in the Jakob The Liar telesync.
We saw the workprint months ago, and the movie sucked then and it still sucks. Robin 
Williams playing to the tortured jewish community about the holocaust. No thanks.

Total - 1 Point



EViLISO

Has been quiet from this camp for a couple of weeks and only a few people know why, and
theyre not talking. They did manage to squeek out one screener of Trippin which was 
only available as a shitty telesync. Its a shitty black comedy thats not very funny and
doesnt show enuff bootay!! 

Total - 1 Point



DVNVCD

Ok, here's where I get to rant. For once, Im on the side of DVNVCD even though alot of
thier nukes have been deserved. The last few weeks (hell, months for that matter) DVNVCD
has continued to release Direct To Video (DTV) Movies. Most sites nuke these, and I dont
know where that rule originated but to me its worthless. Three are quite a few gems of
movies out there that will hit as DTV only. Smaller studios and independent companies
bypass the theatrical market and hit DTV to make thier cash. Now if you look up most
DTV movies prices you'll see that they usually start out around $80 bucks U.S. Pretty
hefty. If a releasing group brings you the screener or telesync before the video stores
and does it whithin the current releasing rules, the movies should be allowed. Whichever
stupid stuck-up siteop with no clue about the movie scene made up this rule or whatever
group thinks theyre too good for DTV needs to stfu and recognize where a majority of
movies are going and coming from nowadays. DVNVCD gets a point for the release even though
it was nuked. (Im not crediting them for the 10 other nukes they got for this reason in
the past few months tho :D )

Total - 1 Point
                                                   


If your downloading, grab the third release of Generals Daughter from Centropy and maybe
the New Rose Hotel if you like sci-fi cheez. Other than that, not a whole lot worth 
mentioning. CENTROPY takes the award the second week in a row without any stiff
competition from the major competing groups. Good work, but Id like to see less crap
and more mainstream.


                                                    Juggling my balls..
                                                         - Ryche -
