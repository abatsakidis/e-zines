===========================================================================

-----------[ The Devestator Report ]-----------
==========================================================================

THE Devestator REPORT FOR THE WEEK OF 10/25/99 - 10/31/99
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some new point system changes new this week!

THE RULES
~~~~~~~~~

- Games are rated on a 0-5 scale. The average rating for a game will 
be 3.0. Games are rated on how good the game is, and how anticipated the 
title is. 

- Fixes are punished by deducting half the points for the game. If a 
competing group fixes the release, they recieve full points for the release 
and the group needing the fix loses all the points. If a fix is very minor 
in nature, or is embedded late in the game, a single or no deduction is 
possible. 

- Faction compliancy is NOT required to recieve points. If a faction compliant 
rip is released at any time without having essential gameplay components 
removed, it will supercede the previous attempt. Official Addons for a 
game should be in standalone format, unless it is not possible within standard 
disk limits.  If someone releases a non standalone official addon and another 
group does a standalone version that is not raped, the group that released 
  the standalone version will recieve credit.

- +3 and up Trainers for games that rate higher than 3.0 will be given a 
full point. +2 and under trainers and cheat codes only recieve 1/2 of a 
point. Only one +3 and up trainer or   one +2 and under trainer or cheat 
codes will be accepted per group, per game.

- Patches are worth a half point. Major patches for important games could 
recieve a full point.

- Addons for games are given a 1.0 addition provided the addon is not:

  (a) a movie addon of any kind... or
  (b) An essential component removed for faction compliance      (3DFX)
  (c) For a below average (under 3.0) game
 
Any group may release a game addon, regardless of the original release 
group. Multiple addons 
packed within one release (a speech and music addon for example) may be 
given two points.

Class had a really nice week this week, one repack and they put out 
another West Front Addon that was standalone, so they get the points, 
OGN doesn't.  Overall a pretty good week for Class.

Not much from OGN this week, Pharaoh is a pretty nice game, except for 
the need for a batch file fix. We couldn't award any points for their 
West Front Addon since it was non standalone, hopefully this will encourage 
groups to do standalones if possible, because those are better for the 
end user.

Special Section

This week we will conduct an interview with a member of class who has been in 
class for a while, each week we will interview an active member of our competing 
groups OGN, CLS, RZR, PDM, and DVN.

This weeks Interview is with Goldorak of Class.


NWR> Thanks for the time for this interview.  Let's start by naming your 
current affils past and present.
<Goldorak_> I've been in RZR for a few month and quickly joined CLASS around 
march-april '97, a few  month after the group started.
<Goldorak_> I've only been interested in games , so I never go interested by 
any other scene , I am also in kalisto but that's more a recreation than 
anything else.

<NWR> How did you get your start in RZR and in the "warez" scene in general?
<Goldorak_> In europe we were a little bit late so I only got a modem around 
1996. Before that in europe it was mostly mail trading and local rings on the 
C64 & Amiga.
<Goldorak_> With i'net and irc everything became easy (too easy?) and it was 
quite easy to get in group.

<NWR> What have been your roles in first RZR and now class?
<Goldorak_> Supply & cracking are the only two importants things for a game 
group. Supply are the raw material and the crack made the release possible. 
All the rest , leaders , courriers etc... are of lesser importance 

<NWR> So what roles have you lead when you were in rzr and now in class?
<Goldorak_> so obviosuly having no progamming skills I could only supply :)
<Goldorak_> supplying is fun because it's a challange.

<NWR> Who taught you the ropes in the Art of supplying?
<Goldorak_> supplying is not an art , it's a simple thing. It's about 
motivation.
<Goldorak_> Take USA for instance , it's about who has the courage to go 
get the stuff early.
<Goldorak_> the rest , ripping winning races is only about practice and good 
coordination with cracker.
<Goldorak_> it's all about being available and being dedicated

<NWR> What got you interested in supplying in the first place?
<Goldorak_> The challenge of being able to get something done faster than 
the rivals. It's more like a sport.
<Goldorak_> in that sense the scene a good school for us in our future lives 
to be performent in an extremly competitive and mercyless enviroment :)

<NWR> Are there any big differences between the european and US supplying 
scenes or are they about the same?

<Goldorak_> not the same , USA is easier in a sense , cause all you got to do 
is check ebworld.com to know what's coming out.
<Goldorak_> so everyone know what to expect it doesn't need much preparation. 
but you got to be really fast cause games are often out around 11.30 AM - 1PM
<Goldorak_> for the one that don't need reindexing or such things
<Goldorak_> while in europe the channels of distribution are much more complex.
<Goldorak_> you have distributors and retails and some distros from certain 
euro country get some games before the others , ie : most infogrames 
games go to germany.

<NWR> What have been some of your favorite titles that you've supplied?
<Goldorak_> well
<Goldorak_> I'll pass on that one I'd rather not give out too much 
detail about my supplies as it has always been CLASS philosophy.
<Goldorak_> but I can tell you something tough.
<Goldorak_> the game I'm most pround of are not the big names games from 
EA or whoever , those are boring ones.
<Goldorak_> but getting a total no name suprise title is certainly more fun!
<Goldorak_> or the good games are also the one why nice stories behind.
<Goldorak_> ie : CLASS will certainly always remember the way Quake 2 was 
obtained.

<NWR> So how do you feel about the new Class turnaround, because of recent 
scene events, and what has helped Class have less fixes lately than in years past?

<Goldorak_> CLS has always been a conistant groups during the past 3 years, 
they only had one weak time , it was like Q1'99
<Goldorak_> but otherwise during their 3 years existance I would say they 
lost like 5 months / 34.
<Goldorak_> as for the fixes. Hard to say.
<Goldorak_> I think ISO protection made it easier for the fixes
<Goldorak_> because they are hard but don't have hidden tricks if I may 
say so.
<Goldorak_> once you've removed c dilla you're all set it's not like a ubi 
soft game like POD with 150             encrypted cd checks on the exe.

<NWR> Being in class and a faction member, how do you feel about the faction 
rules and today's releases, and do you think they should be updated at all? 
Or do you think the rip scene will be dying soon, so there really isn't a point 
in updating them?
<Goldorak_> well the last week has been rather bad for rip scene with many 
unrippable games coming out , but overall I think still 85% + of games are 
rippable without decreasing too much the gaming experience.
<Goldorak_> with mp3'ing and new creative way to rip we can fit more in 
50*2.88.
<Goldorak_> increasing limit would certainly make things easier for supplier 
but on the other hand the limit is also stimulating the crackers to find new 
ways to fit more of the game within 50 disks.
<Goldorak_> take the case of driver
<Goldorak_> the iso is like 650 Mb
<Goldorak_> if you get OGN rip and PDM music addon (pdm ripped the audio tracks 
of the cd into mp3 and has             its own player to emulate the audio tracks)
<Goldorak_> you got the full cd running from your harddrive and it's only like 
100mb vs 650
<Goldorak_> and it's the EXTACT same thing minus Dx :)
<Goldorak_> also many people still have modem and I still think for 85% of games 
rips is superior to ISO
<Goldorak_> think about it
<Goldorak_> rips are so practicle , leech fast , unzip unace and run
<Goldorak_> for an ISO even with cable it takes time to download and it cost a 
media , it's quite annoying             honestly.
<Goldorak_> take axis & allies addon from FLT last week
<Goldorak_> the iso is 650 mb
<Goldorak_> and to play it you need to have kept original ISO game
<Goldorak_> who wants to leech that shit? and who still has original game?
<Goldorak_> like nobody :)
<Goldorak_> with on the other handle class offers a nice standalone rip for 12 
disks or so
<Goldorak_> of course for games like gabriel knight 3 or Nomad Soul iso scene 
can't do much...
<Goldorak_> actually I think more games were unrippable in the past than 
nowadayas
<Goldorak_> before 3D games took over if you recall
<Goldorak_> all publisher were doing thos gey interactive games with movies 
that were 2,0000 cd's each
<Goldorak_> like under a killing moon and similar shit
<Goldorak_> rules should be updated because they don't take in account a few 
thinks like :
<Goldorak_> - mp3'ing
<Goldorak_> how should mp3'ing be done , is it legit to downgrade wav's 
quality , up to what point
<Goldorak_> ?
<Goldorak_> also there should be clear rules about bmp & tga => jpg
<Goldorak_> what else
<Goldorak_> that's it I guess until new creative ripping ways apprears :p

<NWR> On that note, don't you think maybe the faction should mandate standalones 
for official addons, unless       it just won't go under 50, because it is hard 
to find older games.
<Goldorak_> yes
<Goldorak_> I think addons should be standalone if possible
<Goldorak_> of course for HOMM3 since the original game is like 48*2.88 you 
can't make it
<Goldorak_> but for game like axis & Allies that are almost one year old
<Goldorak_> it would have been idiot to put a non standalone version...

<NWR> What are you views on some of the things going on recently in the US in 
regards to lawsuits and such,       and do you think some of it may carry 
over to europe?

<Goldorak_> as for the USA problems I don't think it will move on to Europe
<Goldorak_> because Europe has so many countries all having a different 
legisations so it's pretty complex             to carry on busts in Europe
<Goldorak_> plus certains countries such as nothern europe seems to have very 
tolerent rules regarding             piracy.
<Goldorak_> keep in mind electronic thief and similar concept are pretty hard 
to understand for all those             old farts from countries justice dept.
<Goldorak_> I don't think many countries in Europe have really uptodate laws 
on that matter.
<Goldorak_> Also european suppliers didn't use the same methods as USA one , 
so people are safer here I             think

<NWR> What methods are risky in the US?  Do you think it's risky at all for 
any group to even touch a gold?
<Goldorak_> I'm not a USA person so I couldn't command on the means people 
as Punisher / RZR or other others             used but in any case putting 
out a game before retail can only attract attention and low profile is the 
key word to last in this activity.
<Goldorak_> I think all the games should go to store...everyone got the same 
chances and that way the one             group that has a better 
team work / organization wins
<Goldorak_> there is no honor to win a game that only you have like days 
before the rivals...

<NWR> Okay well you got any last comments/shoutouts/anything not discussed
<NWR> you want to bring up?
<Goldorak_> I'd like to say that rips vs iso debate is pretty worthless.
<Goldorak_> if in the USA cable in pretty popular , keep in mind in europe 
like VERY few people have cable             at this time
<Goldorak_> and modems people are still the majority of users , I think 
there will always be room for 0day             sites and rips.
<Goldorak_> the only thing that is changing and that is new
<Goldorak_> is that now iso's are coming out before rips which was 
unthinkable before 
<Goldorak_> but for the crackers iso scene is boring , each iso group just 
have one cracker or 2 that update             their tool everyone in a while...
<Goldorak_> pretty boring 
<Goldorak_> you should expect some interesting changes next year when the 
new breeds of iso protections will             come out.
<Goldorak_> the one that cannot be generically removed and have to be dealt 
with on a case per case basis...

<NWR> Any other comments or shoutouts you'd like to make?
<Goldorak_> it's ok I've said all I had to say :)

===============================================================================

That's the week in review. See you all next week for another look 
at the game scene.

 Bud's Biased Utils Report #39
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 I'm back this week, with report #39... wow 52 weeks worth of reports isn't
 far away... I'd like to thank Lester for filling in last week while I was
 away, he's the only reason NWR is even CLOSE to on time... well at least
 those odd times when it actually is close and not days late. Honestly though
 kudos to him, and hopefully I won't miss to many more reports before Y2K
 hits and my out of date system dies (this is my excuse for a new computer -
 I'm leaving mine totally unprotected, and will use the slighest Y2K bug
 as an excuse for a new system!).
  
 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 10/26/99 to 11/01/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.

 PROFESSIONAL.QUESTv1.7_WIN9xNT-CORP
 NETWATCHER2000.v.1.0.187-WIN9xNT-CORP
 AIRPLAN.v2.3.2.0-WIN9xNT-CORP

 Look who's alive! Well kinda... The Corporation shows some
 movement this week with a small selection of mostly minor
 stuff. AirPlan can create professional flight plans, and
 with planes dropping out of the skies like rain recently,
 perhaps more private planes should consider filing the odd
 flight plan... honestly though this app is limited to a
 pretty small user base, and is localized to the US, further
 reducing its overall appeal. NetWatcher sounds like an 
 enhanced version of NukeNabber, though I haven't checked
 it out, Quest, possbly the best release here - it allows
 you to design questionaires. Given those threee titles... don't
 expect too much from Corp in the near future.

 PC.Install.with.Internet.Extensions.v7.0-SHOCK

 The crew at SHOCK worked some real magic this week, with by far
 their best effort of late. They pulled in SoftQuad's HotMetal Pro 6,
 after an earlier cracked demo missing half the program's features
 was distributed IND. This package is the full deal, with some
 optional addons. The addons aren't great, but HotMetal is a leader
 in the website design field. Shock also managed to get PC Install
 with Inet Extensions 7 final from 2020, as well as the latest
 Cowon app, Jet-Toolbar VR edition. Add in DigiTools, a high-end
 addon for Visio, and you get a nice week, but perhaps the most
 interesting release of the week was Shields Up, a program
 that minipulates grc.com's personal security check features
 and allows you to port scan/probe any computer on the net.
 GRC even took notice and were nice enough to post screenshots
 of the app on their site, claiming any security flaws would
 be corrected in their next release of Shields Up. Uh-huh.

 Wow, LND is alive... if a little dusty. SurfaceWorks and SaberDesigner
 are nice, even if the latter needed a fix. Virtual Gibbs is released 
 frequently, but 5.12.02 is the first build of 5.12 to be released, 
 so it's not entirely minor.

 Releases: 

 DOD_DVD_Speed_Riper_V1.0_for_Linux_REPACKED-DOD

 Great tool for Linux users... I've come to this decision
 about *NIX class OS's: If I give them points, I should
 have to (in fairness) give points to other non-win OS's
 (ie OS/2). So as of next week, I will begin scoring
 non-win releases. However, they will recieve half the
 credit a Windows app would, since there is a smaller
 userbase for them... last note, they must be
 for the x86 platform (PC). Alpha, Mac, and any others
 (including palmtops) will not be counted.

 offering a fix AND a repack, so that four months from now some
 poor user isn't trying to hunt down the tiny fix file no one
 kept. They also put out full cracks for TMG's Midpoint releases,
 amongst other things these cracks allow unlimited licenses.

 A lot of apps out of the Scum camp this week, including a release
 of Artcam with all modules present. LND had two shots at this one,
 although their second try worked it was missing certain features
 (not essential for all but appreciated by many). Scum also puts
 out ULead Java Razor, however both the apps included in this package
 (Button Applet & Animation Applet) have been release seperately, and
 I'm not too sure what, if anything, is new here. Aside from that
 there's some good apps all around, and the pickups from PWA are
 paying off... but then, PWA picked them up for SGE... so how long
 will this last?

 Pros get out a fairly nice package for the home user in
 Home Publishing 2K, whoever the rip does not work for NT

 no cause whatsoever. Since it only works with Win9x I gave
 it just 1 point - probably more than an MS app even deserves.

 <p0tz> i knew i shouldnt have skipped that day at school
 <p0tz> come to think of it i shouldnt have skipped that semester

 The week in utils went to Scum and Shock, for two different ends of the
 spectrum. Strong showing by Rise as well, meanwhile LND... well is alive.
 Most of the fun was in the games scene this week, hate to say it but
 it's true.

 So a new rule next week, non-windows platforms will be scored, but at
 half the points I'd give a Windows-based counterpart. Non-x86 platform
 apps will not be counted.

 Thanks again to Lester for filling in last week!

 If you aren't bored of the utils scene quite yet, SJ & Poison have given
 me there Married Couple Utils Report #4, so take a peek at it! It's umm...
 somewhere in this issue... hey look I don't edit, for all I know you've
 already read it cuz it got billing over me <G>.

 On a sad note, RIP Insanity (DEV), who died in a car crash over the weekend.
 Return, sorry I missed you for that farewell letter.

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 

Being John Malkovich
Starring: John Cusack, Cameron Diaz and obviously John Malkovich.
Rating: 4 out of 4 Stars.
Directed by: Spike Jonze

This is easily the most original movie I have seen in recent memory.
The premise is that John Cusack is a puppeteer, who has to get an office
job, and the office is on the 7 1/2 floor so everything is half-size. He
finds a small door that leads into John Malkovich's brain. So he starts
charging admission to Malkie's brain and lots of funny ass shit takes place.
It kind of sounds cheesy on paper, but trust me it is a hilarious film. It's
in a very limited release right now but hopefully we'll see it on more screens.


---

House on Haunted Hill
Starring: Geoffrey Rush, Taye Diggs, Chris Kataan, and a bunch of other peopz.
Rating: 3 1/2 out of 4 Stars

This is I believe a remake of an old horror flick with the same title, but I'm
not 100% sure. I wasn't real sure of who was in this movie or the exact
plot but I was pleasantly surprised by the people in it as well as the
actual story of the film. It takes place in an old psychiatric institute,
where a ton of people were murdered after the director went crazy and sealed them
up inside. Flash forward to present day and Rush's character throws his wife a 
birthday party in this house. 5 people are given a chance to stay the entire night
and if they do, they win 1 million dollars if they are alive in the morning.
This is a very wicked movie. It is alot like a Tool video in certain parts,
but it's very good and blows away The Haunting anyways. <g>

releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is  usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear  people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination  of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.

Anyways, ratings are based on quality of isos and releasing more than 1 
iso a month helps <g>

Not much activity from RiSCiSO, no points are being given 
for SoftImage Toonz as the crack was stolen from HARVEST and no 
authorization for RiSCiSO to use it was given 
by HARVEST. Painter 6 is a very nice title though.

PHXiSO is mainly budget store crap...with an odd decent 
title like Cakewalk Groove Maker or MS HPS 2K.

1. I dont care about my NERVOUS SYSTEM and its spelt PHYSIOLOGY 
NOT PHISIOLOGY.
2. Call a travel agent for your trips! Rand McNally is fat!
3. I know how to type and i can do my stocks in my head :P
4. WOW A SERIAL FIX! KICKASS WORK!

 New this month: everyone <g>

 Idle this month: N/A
 
 TFL takes first place this month due to their dominance in the 
ISO Scene. RadiumISO and PHXiSO tie for second
 due to PHXiSO releasing a few quality apps. Everyone else did 
fairly poor this month. (lacking releases)

--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors, we all love them even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us. And these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, your name will not be included, but we
do not add rumors like that say "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion"
because we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore
there is no hard evidence of that rumor, so if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!
