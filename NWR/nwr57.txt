	Well, well, well. NWR is here again. Hey it's even fucking on time. All this without 
the help of our wonderful co-editor, Ndetroit. I think a story of his disappearance may 
be in order if he does show up soon. Ryche is away on business this week so it's just little 
old me getting this ready. The issue is pretty stock with the usual items,
no stats this week and no vcd review obviously since Ryche is gone. If you want 
to take over doing the stats for us, contact me or email us at nwr@netmonkey.org since 
Tech is never around for us anymore!@# Blitz is also back, you can check out his report 
in the usual spot, we'd like to thank Ttol for filling in and you can check out his report 
included in the zip. In talking to some people this week, I noticed there are a shitload 
of stat mags out there, and I ask myself, what the fuck for? They are all virtually the same,
only run by each different courier group to make their group just a LITTLE bit better. 
Guys we really don't need all this <g>. We also have a new pic this week, sent to us by our
photographer Tdpriest, who caught 2 of Mrpumpkin's girlfriends fighting over him. Check it out.

    Hello fellows, here cedric to the rescue to deliver you this week's 
courier report. I'm trying to make it unbiased, but if you feel it isn't,
well just skip it and go to the next section, i don't give a fuck ;>
By the way, english isn't my native language, so if i make mistakes,
bear with it...

===============================================================================================

THE BLITZ REPORT FOR THE WEEK OF 09/05/99 - 09/12/99
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 NWR is back baby and so is your favorite columnist, yours truly. Lucky for everyone 
my Ultima Online shard is down so I actually have time to give a shit about the game scene 
this week. Just kidding folks, I've kept up with the news. Last week we saw a good... 
effort on the part of ttol to fill this space, and my sincere thanks to him and Ryche for 
releasing without me (you cocksuckers). Little excerpt about my feelings on sharing this 
space with the likes of my old friend The Tree of Life:

<ttol> so wha am i suppose to do with this 3/4 finished gaming report
<ttol> for nwr 57
<Blitz> stick it in yer ass?

 Suffice to say I wasn't pleased to see my column taken over without talking to 
me =P. Anyhow, enough of the bullshit on with the meat of the order. Where's Origin? 
Patches 1911? Paradead? Read on for the whole story.

 Hrm nice week for Class. Ok starting at the top. Class release a game that they just 
loved to scream lame about when I did a patch for 1.0. I did an (Origin) standalone patch 
for 1.0 to 1.1 since the game is only 4mb anyway. Well CLS rightly pointed out that this 
is a good game and people ask for it but they should shut up when other groups release good 
games that might be small or otherwise not Quake 3.  Okay Soul Reaver. As I said above, 
Class won the rip race on this one, but the points go to PDM. I think the reasons are 
pretty clear above. The PDM is made up of beta speech + "CLS exe" + parts of the 
final. Well CLS exe is not gonna win an argument from me because it's been long established 
that once a game gets released as an ISO, the crack is fair game. Total Annihilation comes to 
mind here. Sorry CLS, I'm not picking on you guys I swear.  Kinda sucks running a site with 
two members from CLS as staff because they get to convince you that dung like 
Star Trek The Game Show is a 3.0 game, but after playing it... *sigh* I guess it's not so 
bad after all. I just feel like I'm giving in to SJ and Devestator's geekdom by even rating 
this game. Three stars and to hang on SJ's parent's basement wall.  The big prize for 
CLS this week was Railroad Tycoon, and yup this game still rocks and there's a lot of 
people who just can't get enough of it. I'm past the stage where I find this game 
entertaining (I played the first version for a few months in oh... 1991?), but this kind 
of classic strategy game always deserves an overhaul. A good rip here from CLS for a change 
and the meat of their 9.5 week.

 Looks like enough members of Paradigm managed to rat out on enough people to get the 
group going again. Who is left? You won't hear it here, but PDM shows their depth by 
continuing to release quality stuff even after assholes like Leno and Drizzt 
(I thought you were cool Driz) turn states on their "friends".  What do we have here. 
Well Prince of Persia 3D is the best game this week I would say. It's a far cry from 
the platform classic we all loved (except maybe you kids who grew up with 3DFX instead of 
waiting for long-delayed Atari 2600 like me), but a seriously fun looking game. 
From what I hear the game crashes after the third level, and CLS was very happy to provide 
a savegame that proved their case (and coincidentily won them the week).  Soul Reaver is 
the question of the week isn't it? Well after some thought and compelling arguments 
from CLASS, it goes to PDM. Reasons? Well, the PDM version is just better. 
Since this report tries to inject a little quality assesment into it's inevitibly 
quantity-driven ratings, we're going to ignore the beta speech files on this one. 
The game is better, and nobody outside the small circle of the rip elite give a 
shit that CLS put it out first or the exe has FLT fingerprinting or any of that crap. 
All the end user (hey that's me too) cares about is the best rip and here it is. 
Three points.  As stated before, a pool game is gonna need something special to 
rank above a two. Looking at the points I guess a music addon is pretty special 
because add it up and there's a three. Points ain't perfect, remember that. =\ 
Blitz considers making his trainer-must-be-for-4.0-or-better rule apply for game 
addons as well. Consider it done starting next week.

 Typical. Origin don't release shit while I'm away, but as soon as the report 
comes back I gotta say nice shit about these guys. Well I don't have to be too 
nice because Space Bastards is budget (ten bucks webware), and Settlers 3
 is just an addon. It's well ripped as usual though and they did manage to 
jam the original and the last addon in there so that's pretty sweet. I 
just don't see what the attraction to this game is though really. 
The graphics are poor and if you want a TBS there are better ones, but an 
average rating for the game.

 I think DVN has an extreme insider, because like either every other group 
passes this shit or they have it LOCKED! Three guesses as to which one is the 
attempt at humour. They all get ones, although DVN does do a service putting 
out the games that the other groups feel they are above doing, so yes they do 
fill a needed role in the game scene. And heck, every once in a while there will 
be a Superbikes for these guys... but not this week.

 Okay well jack fuck from Razor this week except a patch which is basicly a 
map for DK2, which was a pretty good game. So hell half a point. What we missed 
while I was not printing this report was my group stomping everyone with the release 
y'all gonna remember in Tiberian Sun. Typical Razor, you guys fight over Star Trek 
Trivia, we'll save our money for the good games =).

Points Release Title

 0.5   Dungeon.Keeper.2.Bonus.Pack.3-RAZOR (0.0M)
 
 Well well. The more shit changes the more it stays the same. What do we have? 
PDM and CLS duking it out for first place. Origin not quite over the hump but 
landing all the UK titles that A&D don't decide are huge, plus the odd USA courtesy 
of their ISO friends. DVN releases the crap titles. And Razor waits for the next 
blockbuster. WTF?!?! Where is the massive change we expected after the busts? 
Well here's the scoop folks. PDM/CLS are made up of the die-hard win at all costs 
guys who bleed the game scene and go balls to the wall for every game. Origin is 
still the Rick and Dan show with a huge army of maybe's and wannabe's who deliver 
the odd title. DVN is DVN, and Razor is the old semi retired guys who can't be 
bothered unless it's for the big one. That's the game scene in black and white and you 
know? I kinda like it.  One last note. The Blitz report monthly is ready and in 
a fucking SWEET coded format (MrNop is your god). We're working on interviews 
and articles for the October 1 debut. See you all next week... unless I'm sharing 
the game report with ttol this week, in which case it's... 
HASTA LA VISTA MOTHERFUCKER and thanks for all the fish.

 Bud's Biased Utils Report #33
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 Bless the cable company... without them I wouldn't be able to sit home for 
 two straight days waiting for my cable modem to arrive... did I mention I'm
 installing the f@$!ing thing myself, so they barely have to do anything in
 the first place? I did manage to scam some free cable TV out of them though...
 
 A bit of a slow week throughout the scene release wise... a few good apps,
 a few good games, and a lot of people sitting around staring blankly at
 their monitors bored out of their skulls.
  
 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 09/07/99 to 09/13/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.

 released by Harvest, so half the points I gave to it go to them.

 Eicon Aviva for Java... umm since Java runs on virtually any platform,
 there's no much point adding Win9xNT2K.Linux to that directory name
 guys...

 Releases: 

 DELCAM.ARTCAM.PRO.V4.0-LND

 One nice release from the recently silent LND. ArtCAM Pro
 allows users to create 3D renderings from 2D bitmaps and
 so forth... a pretty decent package, marketed at a wide
 range of potential users... if you're pissed at LND's lack
 of a discription in the NFO check out www.delcam.com for
 more info.

 A bit more in the way of variety from DOD this time around.
 Yes there's another Symantec app, but also some development apps
 (CORBAplus, an ORB for class distributed object applications),
 even a keymaker in there. While most of this stuff follows the old
 "If you don't know what it is you don't need it" rule, it's nice to
 see DOD branching out a bit more.

 to be the only real challenge to LND's CAD/CAM dominance.

 and also released a vague addon pack that found itself nuked on
 many sites. Still a nice release, and one of the few products
 Seagate is still developing internally after selling off 
 several of their traditional products.

 Week goes to PWA, who managed a bit more on the quality end than PNC and PFT,
 who came close. Also, great work done by Scum over the past seven days.

 Now that the cable is here, there will be some spotlights on certain
 niches of the utils scene, and on the groups that dominate them. I keep
 promising Radium and that will come... anyways that's all for now.

                                                                       - Bud

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 

Stigmata
Starring: Patricia Arquette, Gabriel Byrne
Rating: 3 1/2 out of 4 Stars

Stigmata is a fuckin great film. If you like disturbing religious type shit, 
then go see it. I am too rushed to do a good review!:P


=----------------------------------=-------------------------------------=

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is  usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear  people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination  of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryche is on vacation this week and will be back next week with a damn report !@#



=----------------------------------=-------------------------------------=


-----------[The Scene News]-----------

All the news thats fit to print... 
and then some...

Prozax joins up with Dev. How stupid is that?

NF is in AOD. Who knew it even existed?:) (Well ppl who pay attention to the scene probably:))

Hey, uhm there's not alot of news to talk about.

Did you all know that the scene is truly boring these days? Start some more fights or something.

I believe it is that FF8 and some other huge games have come out and so everyone is spending
their time playing games instead of being whores.




--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors, we all love them even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us. And these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, your name will not be included, but we
do not add rumors like that say "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion"
because we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore
there is no hard evidence of that rumor, so if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!

Have you noticed our little rumor intro is the same since the very beginning of 
NWR doing rumors? They really are not nearly as funny as they were back then <g>.

Rumor has it NWR will change the rumor intro!

Rumor has it Ryche is an idiot for thinking NWR would be late this week.

Rumor has it that Cedric is actually a unicorn.

Rumor has it that Bud, our own utils reviewer is actualy David Faustino who played 
"Bud Bundy" on Married with Children!

Rumor has it that Ndetroit is being anally raped by large numbers of mongeese.

Rumor has it that Elocin spelled backwards is actually NICOLE. Which leads NWR's 
crack team of investigators to believe that Elocin is really a girl named 
Nicole who likes to be spanked.
