    Well, Well, Well. Ryche promised me a "REAL" article for this week
    to get back into the flow of things. BUT, he was MIA again as 
usual. Now we have a staff change this week. Blitz has left us for
good and Devestato is the current and hopefully permanent replacement
for our good friend Blitz. Sorry to see you go old buddy. Also, the
iso charts I promised are MIA as Djay is a fag and never sent me them!
(DJAY msg me or call my ass and get me those reports:))
I have also decided to return to the courier report for awhile. Cedric is a good 
replacement but he refuses to do it without stats and nobody
ever gives me weektops. :( PLEASE send your weektops to 
nwr@netmonkey.org or contact me/nd on irc. Thankyou
                                       
						-Lester [Co-Editor/Head Writer]


    Well.. 
    We lost Blitzkrieg this week, and in my mind, that signals the end
    of an nwr era.
    His report was *always* top quality - incisive, cutting, to the point,
    and full of tremendous insider info that the average scene member
    can only guess about.
    Thanks for all your work here blitz.. 
    (ps: private to blitz: no, seriously... it *is* coming back.. soon!
    i'll call you when it does, so you can unretire!!  ;D  ...  )

    So we had a games vacancy for a period of a couple hours, but no
    sooner did i find out that blitz was gone, when lester informed me
    that we have a new guy now: Devastato of CLASS. Good luck to you,
    Devestato!

    I am slowly starting to work myself back into scene shape. I need
    more leech accounts, please... Remember: the staff of nwr *can* be
    bought. We're willing to whore more than our integrity!!!
 
    Hmmm.. .... that might be a good new slogan.

    Oh.. also: webpage is done.. I'll post the URL in the #nwr chan once 
    we have made sure that the box hosting it is 'secure' from all the
    31337 h4x0rZ..

    Ciao!

Biased Courier Report


Amnesia: AMN had a pretty dead week once again, not much of any action. Few guys 
placing on certain sites, but they clean up the group a little bit with some kicks and add 
a few resources from what inside sources say. We will see if anything pans out. 
Still needs alot of work.
Overall: 1/10(Activity Needed)

AOD: Well as of yesterday AOD ran into some bad luck. Losing Creater, Grave, Thug, 
Johnny, Yoda, Phenyx and some boxops. AOD has been in a bit of trouble as of late,
 we will see over the next few weeks if they can hold it together. Already other traders 
are looking at other groups to join. Would be a shame to see this group fall apart after 
doing so well.
Overall: 4/10 (Rough waters but still maintain some good talent)

Ascension: Our newest addition to this little report. ASN is run by 
Aeiou(you probably know him from any other courier group you've been in), 
Thug(ex risc courier, and aod guy, hasn't moved a meg in years), 
Grave(box recruiter type guy for AOD and aodiso co-leader?), 
Dv(i forget where he comes from, but I know him), and Zeus21(Former AMN 
and a few other groups, kicked from AMN shortly before ASN started for 
idiotic behavior). They have a few decent traders like Ydevil and..uhm..well they 
have ydevil I know, not sure who all else they have. So far things aren't looking 
super bright, but they claim to have alot of great things, so we will see if they do or not.
Overall: XX/10 (No performance yet to rate)

Devotion: Godbless and more godbless.Officedog is also trading and Prozax has 
begun to show up on more and more sites. So dev is starting to pick up a little more 
momentum again.
Overall: 6/10

Risc: Not alot happening here, Flavor trades and Psedo trades as well. 
They have no new blood and not a bunch of excitement, but they aren't 
totally idle anymore.
Overall: 3/10

Vice: Mrpie and company continue to do their thing, but they aren't 
blowing anybody away now that Nailz isn't super active and Redman is 
still doing school. They seem to need a little new blood. 
Overall: 4/10

Bla this report sucks ass

For those of you who remember my article in the early days of
NWR may remember that I used to be pretty much an asshole to
everybody. And after reading back, I think it was alot more fun
when I was an asshole and caused trouble. So now that I'm coming
back to this report. I will be heading back to my roots. The
"Weekly Happenings" will return to the report and Themed reviews
as well. If you don't like it, I don't really care and never did, 
but it's more fun for me this way.

-----------[ The Devestator Report ]-----------


THE Devestator REPORT FOR THE WEEK OF 10/04/99 - 10/10/99
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This week sure was a slow week, with an awful lot of garbage releases.  
Not much racing this week, CLS easily took the week with a boatload of 
small games.  


THE RULES
~~~~~~~~~

- Games are rated on a 0-5 scale. The average rating for a game will be 3.0. 
  Games are rated on how good the game is, and how anticipated the title is. 

- Fixes are punished by deducting half the points for the game. If a 
  competing group fixes the release, they recieve those points. If a fix is 
  very minor in nature, or is embedded late in the game, a single or no 
  deduction is possible. 

- Faction compliancy is NOT required to recieve points. If a faction 
  compliant rip is released at any time without having essential gameplay 
  components removed, it will supercede the previous attempt. 

- Trainers for games that rate higher than 4.0 will be given a half point. 
  Only one trainer per group, per game can recieve points. This includes 
  level skippers and cheat codes, as well as editors and multiplayer cheats. 
  A truly remarkable trainer for a major game could recieve a full point.

- Patches are worth a half point. Major patches for important games could 
  recieve a full point.

- Addons for games are given a 1.0 addition provided the addon is not:

  (a) a movie addon of any kind... or
  (b) An essential component removed for faction compliance (3DFX)
  (c) For a below average (under 3.0) game
 
Any group may release a game addon, regardless of the original release 
group. Multiple addons packed within one release (a speech and music addon 
for example) may be given two points.

+=\/======================\/=======\/==

Class released a shitload of stuff this week, but nothing really that great.
Facts are these days an average game just isn't worth playing. CLS also 
threw in their usual assortment of below-average fare, including B-Hunter, 
Scooby Doo, and a snowmobile racing game game. Throw in yet another Hoyle 
game and you get 15.5 points worth of crap.

Origin was pretty quiet this week, just a trainer for Freespcae 2, which 
according to our rules earns them 0 points because CLS did the cheat 
codes last week.

Paradigm has been pretty quiet ever since the mag stuff, yet another 
released ISO title for them, and a movie addon which gets them no 
points, gives them a whopping 3 points this week.  But hey, it's enough 
to give them second place for the week.

Well seeing as this is my first week taking over for Blitz, you might see a 
few point system changes and look for some great upcoming interviews with 
some members of the gaming scene!  Lets hope we can get some fresh blood 
in the scene to give Class a little competition, maybe grind should restart 
TPC. =)

 Bud's Biased Utils Report #37
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 I'm not going to even try to write an intro after all the blabbing I did
 last week.
  
 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 10/05/99 to 10/11/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.

 PIRATES WITH ATTITUDE:

 Releases: 

 Project.Launcher.v1.0-PWA
 Spectrum.Element.Manager.v2.2-PWA
 Microsoft_Photodraw_2000_Version_2_Final-PWA

 When the breakup of SGE took place, we all saw PWA gain a ton of
 potential power. What we witnessed was the strongest incarnation
 of the group in what was probably years. Last week, it seems much
 of that newfound support left the fold and moved over to SCUM. That's
 about all the hyping I'll do on the issue... but the question remains:
 Is PWA back to Winbetas and the occasional good release?
 This week, well, suprise, suprise we see an oversized PWA app, which
 I'll pretend I didn't see and tell you all to get the ISO, should one
 be released. Aside from that, two standard apps, nothing compared to
 the quality and output of several weeks back however. For now at least
 things aren't looking great for PWA.

 I think we covered FlexLM enough last week, don't you?
 OnTime Enterprise was nuked on certain sites as "Bad"... note to
 nukers, broken means broken, dupe means dupe, bad means your dog 
 pissed on the rug. Mentor Power Elite got killed as being a collection
 of dupes. RBS fixes the ModelSim license, both the SCUM and SLT 
 releases had problems due do a dongle on top of the FlexLM protection.
 Best release here is Renoir 99.2 in the end. A strong week discounting
 the nukes.

 Not too much too show for the PWA influx yet, but Painter 6
 is a very nice pickup for SCUM. StarOffice was nuked as free
 however, although at least SCUM realized their mistake and requested
 the nuke. AutoDesk Express Tools and PhotoDeluxe Home 3.1 are
 both strong titles, but SCUM has thwe potential for more, and
 it's time they stepped up in the release department.

 Now we get interesting. I over-hyped RiSE last week, but they
 are a good group. However, several days after the end of last week
 several of the Rise releases I listed turned up to have problems.
 It doesn't help much that NO ONE bothered to nuke them, so again
 we see what a major problem nuking (or lack thereof) has become in
 the scene. In those supposedly broken releases were Staad Pro Design
 Studio 3.1 and Steel CAD Detailing System 2 v6.114 for WinNT. Now
 Steel CAD I can't vouch for, but I've tested out Staad Pro Design
 Studio and it *seems* to be working fine for me. However, given
 the complexity of CAD apps, and this app in general, there could be
 bugs anywhere, so I won't discount the complaints (sorry but I've only
 had a couple of hours to play with it, and given my schedule I won't
 get many more any time soon). If anyone can email me (bud@shocking.net)
 with a bug that I can replicate or /Msg me on IRC, it would help, so if
 you use this app feel free to do so. Not sure if a fix from RiSE is pending
 on these or not... for now the points issue is mute, as there's too many
 iffy factors here.

 For this week we see and update for Unigraphics, as well as an addon
 (MoldWizard) for the previous version... not sure if it will work with
 the 15.03 update. Steel CAD Detailing system got a damaged zip fix,
 but that doesn't answer the functionality questions that have been
 floating around. Best of the week for RiSE was the newest Delcam Powermill
 release.

(*editors note: no bud... not YODA... K-B0T!!*)


 Seems no one got an 8/10 this week... 7 turns out to be a hard earned 
 score. Why? RBS and SCUM faced nukes, RISE was forced to fix some mistakes 
 and didn't really come up with anything major, and PFT really didn't do 
 as much as it seemed. Looking at the four I give the advantage to PFT 
 however, while the Cognos stuff is really one package split up, it's still 
 a nice catch  (grrr my free 30-day trail CD was in the mail :P).
 
 An Interview with Poison of SCUM:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 An interview with scum?!? Yeeeckkk! J/K. Well I finally followed through on
 a promise, and this week present you with an interview with Poison,
 a driving force behind the success of Scum.

 -----

 <Bud> Near the beginning of 1999, SCUM made it's return to the utils scene.
       So the readers can have some background info, kindly tell us about 
       yourself, and your past affils/positions in the scene.

 <Poison> well.. ive been in both versus and pinnacle before, jroger pretty 
          much brought me in with pnc (been in other groups, but ill stick to
          the utils ones ;>) .. since we were about the only ones working in 
          pnc at that time we decided to split and reform jr's old utilgroup 
          scum where he was a ppe coder back then
 <Poison> now i am in scum / tfl / ambition

 <Bud> Where there any other reasons in bringing back Scum at that time, aside
       from the lack of activity in PNC? Also, what was your role in making 
       the comeback a success?

 <Poison> well.. the reason was that we both were interested by the utils 
          scene, and both already familiar with it for some time helped that
          we didnt just quit utils, but wanted our own group. we basically 
          were (and still are) a good team together, and jroger still had 
          contact with his buddies from the old scum so it was more like a 
          natural decission for him and i gladly joined it with him. making 
          it a success was a combination of dedicating a lot of time, and 
          bringing in the right skilled & hardworking people.
 <Poison> besides that i think we did right by keeping the group small
 <Poison> most groups expand too much too soon and what ive basically seen 
          before is that a crew cant get used to eachoter and gets a lot of 
          misunderstandings.

 <Bud> Scum perhaps suprised quite a few people by putting out a steady, if 
       small, amount of quality apps... one never heard many complaints with 
       cracks/broken releases from Scum. To what do you attribute your success
       in this area, and what if any pressures were added in trying to live 
       up to the reputation of the earlier incarnation of SCUM?

 <Poison> well, sounds like a cliche but we always prefered quality over 
          quantity, so we always make sure that an app is 100% by letting it 
          get tested by one or 2 skilled people, i personally never felt too 
          much pressure in what we're doing

 <Bud> Sounds something like a certain slogan from a certain utils group.... 
       Quality Over Quantity... hmm who could that be <g>

 <Poison> hehe.. i wouldnt know.. shoot me :)

 <Bud> In the first few months of Scum's return, we saw some decent 
       networking apps, developments apps, etc... then this past spring we 
       saw you make a move into the CAD/CAM/Related field, coming up with 
       some apps like Solid View, ModelSim, etc.
 <Bud> Was this a calculated step towards the CAD/CAM field, or more of an 
       accidental occurance?

 <Poison> well it was a natural move towards it, while we were going more 
          good crackers teamed up with us able to crack hard licenses and 
          dongles, so we were able to get harder protected programs out, 
          and cad/cam/cae/fea stuff is often harder protected. Ofcourse we 
          also gained new suppliers who worked more in cad related fields 
          of supplying which helped :) ..
          it wasnt planned completely but the stuff we do now interests
 <Poison> me more then the stuff we did in the first few months
 <Poison> for various reasons

 <Bud> At the time Scum moved into the field, LND was dominating CAD/CAM 
       titles, to a certain degree anyways, and seemed extremely sure of 
       themselves. Aside from the odd release by SGE, and a decent showing 
       by RiSE, SCUM was the first real competition that LND recieved. With 
       the retirement of SGE, and the slowing then retirement of RiSE, PWA 
       gained some CAD/CAM power and managed to get some titles (such as 
       Cimatron IT 10) out, making it a player in the field.  
 <Bud> So at any given time there's been three main groups competiting over 
       a fairly small niche market...
 <Bud> With the recent idleness of LND, and the loss of several PWA members 
       to SCUM, do you feel SCUM has a real oppurtunity to dominate the 
       CAD/CAM field?

 <Poison> up to a certain level i do think we can be dominant in that way yes,
          a recent proof of that was today since we released 7 apps all 
          $40-50k titles in that area. tho.. were not a 100% cad/cam group.. 
          since we like to release apps in diffrent areas aswell, which u can 
          see from other recent releases.
          basically aslong as it is quality, and we like it, we will give it 
          a go if time available :>

 <Bud> So as opposed to what may be LND's fatal mistake, you continue to branch 
       out into other areas.
 <Bud> Who do you feel is your main competition at this point?

 <Poison> at this point im not sure yet, lnd seems dying due recent events.. 
          and the restart as rise i dont see as a real competition yet (which 
          might change i dunno) .. also pwa i dunno how they will turn out 
          now. so its hard to tell.. 

 <Bud> Where do you see Scum at in the new year?

 <Poison> as i see it now, i see scum dominating the utils scene (with an 
          expection of the highend gfx stuff by harvest) for a long time.

 <Bud> Hard to live up to, but possible nonetheless

 <Poison> well the will is there along with the skills, so it is possible :>

 <Bud> That's about all I can think of right now, so I just want to thank you 
       for taking the time for this interview. :)

 <Poison> yea sure.. np ;> 

 <Bud> hehe I better write this thing now or NWR will be late again :P

 <Poison> hehehe.. well what else is new =)


 Ok... done... with a few hours to spare for once. No promises for next week,
 if I do an interview, well, then we're lucky. For now I just want to watch
 the shifts in power in the utils scene play out... or meddle a bit and
 actually do something... whatever... <G>.

                                                               - Bud

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 

Nothing worthwhile came out this week. I have nothing to review.
Though I did see a vcd.

Double Jeopardy
Starring: Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones
Telesync
Video Quality: 3 - Nothing special and nothing terrible, few glips and 
slips and a few head shots but with the shittiness of recent
TS's I've seen, this one was top notch. The groups need to go
back to a little more quality control.

Audio Quality: 4 1/2 - Good solid sound, no problems here.

Movie Quality: 2 1/2 - This is an even movie. It's not really good and 
it's not really bad. I didn't exactly find it all that believable,
but it was something to do for an hour or 2. Judd goes sailing
with her hubby and wakes up to find blood everywhere and him missing.
The cops arrest her and she is convicted of murder. She gives up
custody of her boy to her best friend who is actually fucking her
husband and they run off with the boy. In prison she finds out that
she can't be convicted of the same crime twice so when she gets out
she decides to hunt down her husband who is actually not dead and find
her child. Tommy Lee Jones plays her parole officer. (he seems stuck
in that Fugitive role)

Peace
ratings are 1 for worst, 5 for best


=----------------------------------=-------------------------------------=

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is  usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear  people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination  of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.

--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors. We all love them, even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us- and these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, (your name will not be included), and we
do not add rumors like "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion" because 
we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore there 
is no hard evidence of that rumor. So, if you have real rumors, let us
