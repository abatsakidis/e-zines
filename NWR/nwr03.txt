					NETMONKEY WEEKEND REPORT ISSUE #3!

	In case you havn't read NWR issues 1 and 2, this is a courier report.  We take the top
10 sites in the scene and tally up the points each courier gains and rank them from 1 - 10, 
1 being the best courier and 10 being the 10th best courier <grin>.  In this issue we will
have a new section called Lester's Biased Courier Report! this special section will be 
included everyweek from now on (that's if he finishes one every week <grin>). As you know 
hades is backup, we may include it in our top10 next week given that it stays up.  NoS was down
at reset, so it's not included.

the top ten sites for this week are:

x3 MP -*- STH -*- FH -*- ET -*- FS
x2 NoS -*- LS -*- FOS -*- LA -*- TRM


STATS BABY!

LESTERS SECTION BABY!

Lester's Biased Courier Report!@

Well here it is kids, my little tribute to JJ's biased utils report from INQ.
and of course it's biased because how could I be objective when I run
Dimension, I hate Risc, and I'm fathering Xtremist's child? I can't, so
I'll be biased and make fun of everyone..:) Enjoy, and remember dont get
so upset, it's fun to make fun of yourself.
So the format is like this, I'll review each group, and then I'll point out 
some interesting things from the week and whatever else I feel like saying.
Rating System is : The Shit, Even, Half-Assed, One Man Crew, & Cheating
Bastards. Oh ya and Sellouts, hey new one for MNM, Total Losers.


Dimension: Well must I bother?:) #1 on most every site...to all the ppl
who say all we do is pre, get a life.:) Not as good as we could be of course,
so I would like to take this moment to tell my other traders to get off their
damn asses. Thank you:)

Overall: The Shit

Vengeance: The 1 man trading team!@# Xtremist your the man, your a crazy
Prewhore who doesn't know how to package, but your still the man. Other
than that, VGN has nothing much else going for them, oh but they did pickup
Grim Reaper from risc, who hasn't traded in months and has no loyalty to
any group. :)

Overall: One Man Crew

Risc: We got to witness the return of Geno and Pele, and we got to see Pele
retire within 3 days due to the fact that he is a slowup cheating bastard
(see nwr2:)) So he cried about being harrassed and retired. What a joke,
but anyways..Geno is doing well, but who knows if he is using slowup or not
I haven't looked, but he was always good so probably not eh? Frozen Water
is still the main man in Risc though, mad props to the Water boy.
Holy Shit, Morbid's back! I cower in fear, no he's done quite well
for the first few days of coming back, so maybe Risc is getting their
shit together again?

Overall: Cheating Bastards/Half-Assed 

Devotion: With placing Dizzident as leader of devotion, a monumentally stupid move
in my opinion, just goes to show that Dev is not the group it started out
as and that they are focusing on trying to compete instead of being family.
None the less, 6 very old original Devotion members have left citing the 
same reasons I stated above, time will tell if Dev will be able
to keep it together now. Considering their lack of shell boxes and that
their star Garoto is forced to trade on a shitty shell. 

Overall: One Man Crew/Sellout

Vice: The Little people! Mrpumpkin and Bluie are pretty good, but they are
being slaughtered on their WHQ by DMS. So that's not so good, but they
are a good little group so I give them a thumbs up. Mrpumpkin's resurgence
throughout the week has improved Vice a great deal, they are now winning on
their WHQ, so good job!

Overall: Even

Millenium: Should I even bother saying anything? The PFTPing group hasn't done
much on their own sites, let alone other ones, they managed to be #1 on their WHQ this
week because Ivan got to put out a bunch of PRM releases..:) The only thing that
MNM has going for them is Red Obelisk, he's Amnesia so obviously he's good, Sitez
is banned on some sites and half the other semi-decent couriers ask to join other
groups daily..so not much happening there..:) Purchasing PL may not have been the
best idea:) Psyber showed up again this week and was immediately removed
from 2 sites for uploading stuff from yesterday repeatedly, script must
be a little rusty I guess.

Overall:  Cheating Bastards/Sellout/Complete Losers

Equality: Damn too many groups, but Equality aint so bad, they have Snap & Dawn mostly,
Snap is really good but not consistant, and Dawn is getting there. Other than that,
I dont have a clue what their sites are or who runs the group or anything, So I'll
just say they are decent and that they need more couriers:)

Overall: Even/One & a Half Man Crew
DAILY NEWS:
Sunday April 19th: Quiet day today, except for 1 thing, the slow up cheater
Pele, got raped on a release and so he cried and retired..sample quote:
<Pele_> WTF YOUR STUPID IDIOT ?
Nice grammar btw. :)

Other than that, Devotion decided they wanted to become a mainstream group
and made Dizzident the official leader of their group, causing some old truly
devoted members to quit, such as, Snapcase, Elmo, Nightsky, and Rmz. It's
sad to see Devotion turning away from it's roots of not having a leader and
being 100% democratic.

Monday & Tuesday the 20th/21st: Pretty dead, some nice fat releases. I got
to be a prewhore of a PRM release, much to Xtr's  delight:). We also
got to witness Xtremist in all of his packaging glory...15 disks of diz and 
nfo and no rar's..:)

Wednesday & Thursday the 22nd/23rd: Pretty quiet, Morbid is back and put up
some big meggage on sites, other than that it's alot of the same, I've been
trading myself so maybe I missed some news..:) Getting to the end of the week
though, so we'll see how the last days go..:)

COMMENTS ON SPECIFIC COURIERS/RAMBLINGS/BULLSHIT:

Well that kinda lays it out, hrm, I'll go ahead and give my mad props to the 
top 3 dudes for the week in my opinion, regardless of stats:
Garoto, Stix, Xtremist
Hey look at that, only 1 DMS guy, maybe I'm not biased!
3 People who should be removed from all sites:
Sitez, Psyber, Pele

Well looks like I may even get ranked this week in NWR, shocking isn't it?
So my final thoughts for this week is it was nice to see some of the older
guys get active again but then it was disappointing to see some of them
had resorted to cheating, but life goes on. If you dont like something I
said in here, lighten up, or dont, I dont give a fuck either way. I'm
debating a full scene report, but that might be too much work and make me
too many enemies, so let's stick to the couriers for now. Now you can
yell at me on irc if your a real baby and then I'll make fun of you next
week, so please go right ahead, or just mail me lester@legendsneverdie.org
or simply cry and retire like our good friend Pele did! That'll about do
it for this week kids, dont want to get this thing too long. Enjoy!
