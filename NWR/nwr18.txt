Netmonkey Weekly Report
Issue XVIII
August 31th, 1998
New Format


It's been a couple weeks, hell it's been a month since I've seen my co-editor,
so with all
that's happening for me right now, NWR is a little tough to do every week all
by my lonesome,
I'm still waiting for someone to volunteer to do the stats, and Jaydee/SJ/MGD
were nice enough
to write some stuff for the issue, and that's basically the only reason I'm
releasing this week.
One correction from last issue, Jaydee is not a senior in Devotion, he's just a
gimp.:)
On with the show people.:)

					Lester [Co-Editor/Head Writer/WTF IS ND]

-----------------------[ Lester's Biased Report ]
-----------------------------------------------

Unfortunately kids, I haven't watched shit that closely because of all that's
happened the past
few weeks, so I wont do much in this issue, if I dont get some more help on
NWR, then what
I'll likely do is continue with the Biased report and include articles/etc
whenever I write them
or they get sent, until I have more time or ND decides he wants to come on irc
again.

Dimension: Seems to be back in swing, falling only behind Class on sites this
past week:)

Risc: Hrm, back to normal again, that whole week of trading must really have
worn them out.

Devotion: Always there, nothing spectacular to preach about, but least they
aren't MNM.

Millennium: The previous review kinda sums them up eh?

Vengeance: uh Hawkeye is back, where's the feared comeback?:)

NGT: Least you can say they are loyal right?

EQL: Snap, Crackle, Pop, credit whores!

Promise to do a full fledged rag session next week:)

Movie Review Of Blade

Blade
New Line Cinema (1998)
Starring: Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff
Rating: (***1/2=out of 4)

Blade is a feature-film remake of the comic book Blade(hard to guess that title
huh?). Well the
plot is pretty simple, Blade's mother was bitten by a vampire while she was
pregnant, she died
during labor and Blade underwent dna changes and is now like half
vampire/human. All strengths
and no weaknesses. He walks in the day, likes garlic bread, silver bullets, the
whole bit. So
you might be saying it sounds pretty lame, and what if it's like that stupid
PG-13 Spawn shit,
well not the case my friends, this is full-fledge rated R and is a bloody/gory
vampfest that
owns your ass. After the first 15 minutes, you will have no more doubts about
whether this
movie will be good or not, because Blade rips some vampire ass. If you dont
like blood/death/
exploding heads or Wesley Snipes, then don't go see it. But if you love that
shit, Blade is
where it's at, and Wesley is mr. cool as always. Stephen Dorff puts together a
nice villain
performance too. Final thoughts? Go see it in the theatre, and if you dig
jungle/techno/
electronic music, you'll dig on the soundtrack as well, which sets off the
fight scenes real well

3 1/2 out of 4 stars!

PROHOBITING MINOR UPDATES AND LAME ADDONS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the last issue of nwr you might have seen an interview with me
where Lester and me talked about minor updates which is killing
the scene, cause of lame utilsgroups trying to put out as many
releases/megs as possible and DO NOT think about quality.

<NWR>     I'm writing an article about nuking, and what are your thoughts on
cracking down
          on the crap that is allowed to go through sites these days, because a
          ridiculous
          amount of software comes out every week now, easily twice as much as
          just 2 years ago.
          And a great portion of it is there only to get credits on sites, do
          you think that
          more groups should be banned or nukers given more leeway to nuke on
          their best
          judgement?


<Jaydee>  Yes yes and yes. I hate all the shit some groups puts out Minor
updates, Builds,
          Betas, whatever. Some utils are released in newer version every week,
          I can
          understand if ppl want updates on their major utils but somewhere in
          this mess it
          has to end
          An example:
          200-  980612   ISP.Companion.v7.4.51-PREMiERE 17515KB
          200-  980615   ISP.Companion.v7.4.53-PREMiERE
          200-  980621   ISP.Companion.v7.4.55-PREMiERE
          Etc.Etc...
          Now how gay isnt that ?

There´s one example.

Lester and me talked about it and thought this was VERY hard to prohibit,
BUT its not. The other day I was talking to my friend mgd and he too
seem to think this sucks. In many cases of theese releases same serial can
be used. So he just made an nfo telling ppl where to get the updates
(yes this is webware ofcourse), and put in the serial which will work
until the next major update.
ISP.Companion.v7.5.91-7.9.99.SERIAL.ONLY-IND. This was a very good move
BUT there will still be alot of minor updates.
And to prohibit that, we put in a rules on one of the best sites which said:
* ONLY 1 VERSION PER PROGRAM PER 2 WEEKS UNLESS ITS MAJOR
  UPDATE. 1.0a->1.0b=NOT OK - 1.x->2.x=OK. NUKE X1.

And hopefully this will reduce the amount of crap released by some unnamed
groups. <cough> premiere <cough> versus.


Now to the addons part.

In many games releases you find a movie or intro addon released by some lame
group or even IND a couple of days after the main release was released.
Theese releases is of no other use then to get creds on sites by some
lame trader who releases it. If u want movies, I suggest you get the iso
cause if there would be music-speech-movie-intro addon released to a game
thats exactly what you would have, therefor the games groups have to put
priority to make the game feel groovy. In most cases music and speech
gives the game more plessure then the movie clips.
So in order to stop this massive lameness, we banned intro/movie addons
on one of the best sites around and I know several sites will follow.

If you dont agree with any of this, put out an articel by yourself,
and give us some good arguments on why this is wrong. I do not want
to be disturbed on irc with anything regarding this. Cause mostly this
is my personal thoughts. Untill next time, be good :)

]-----------------------------------------

On August 8th, '98 the scene was blessed with a beta from our friends at
PARADiGM, yet thats not the issue at hand here, Lester and I nuked it on
a couple sites for it being a BETA / ALPHA, yet there was one little
distressed immature, whining, stupid little cocksucker named Snap who
wouldn't stop insisting it was final, and that lester and i misnuked the
release that paradigm put out, that we proved as a beta / alpha. But as
he is illiterate and cant read for shit, wouldn't even listen to what we
were saying and went to go suck off some site ops to get it unnuked,
after stuffing them with bullshit (like usual), claiming it was really a
final. Yet as you can see now after Divine released the STORE final and
pointed out several differences showing us that theirs is truly a final
and paradigm's was a beta/alpha.

<Begin:Snip from DIVINE.NFO>
  Why was Gun Metal beta? simple .. PDM released it ... This is the final
  sales version .... PDM's version has version 0.91 .. this is the official
  sales version thus v1.0 ... PDM's exe was dated 01/08 ... the official
  version amazingly has a 10/08 exe and its bigger in size then PDM's ...
  The PDM version also has a alpha readme text ... We believe in delivering
  FULL games to people ... so this is as full as it gets ... fuck beta's!
<End:Snip from DIVINE.NFO>

We thank Divine for standing up PDM and showing them who's boss. As for
that stupid little dutchie, go fuck yourself and NEVER doubt us again,
especially when you have NO fucking clue about what you are babbling about.
