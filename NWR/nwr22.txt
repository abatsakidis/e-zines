	Hrmm... Lester hates me this week, and didn't give me any
    material, so i guess i will have to do the intros..

	Well... It was both a happy week, and a sad week for us
    here at NWR.. Happy in that there were no sites narked this
    week, and things seemed to go along pretty smoothly..
	Sad in that we have some things that we think you should
    read. (most of you have already, as this file has been DCC'd
    around quite a bit from what i hear..)
	The file is called "rts-pft.txt", and details the presence
    AND use of pftp by some well-respected members of the scene..
	So.. before you jump to conclusions, i would encourage
    you to read what we have to say on the matter, and then think
    about for yourselves....
	
	On a bit of a happier note, PaleDeth is back with some more
    of his weird stuff, and SJ has an awesome feature on todays utils
    scene... Duranged: thanks for the weektops..
        And look!!! We have a logo!! Guess who owns??

	Enjoy the issue!!

  rejeuvinated RiSC... good job!
	Even VGN managed to take care of STH... so...

	So... good job duranged on your phearsome site.. keep
  up the good work, and you will surely be in the top row next week..


=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc.

--------------------[PaleDeth Returns!]----------------------


Uhh... heh.. ok... so he's back, everyone!! thats right.. 
Yes... he was so wacky and zany last week, he has written us
some more.. uhhh... "stuff"... ermm.. heh.. yeah...

This week PD comes at you with a little "Y+M" style quiz..
uhh.. i mean... it WOULD be "Y+M" style... if either of us
READ Y+M.... which we don't... 
Y+M? what is that?? i only read MAXIM... no.. thats not my
copy of Y+M opened up the "Most Embarassing Thing I've Ever
Done" page!!     fuck off!!!

                                      -editors


Hi, this is Pale and his new couriers quiz er thingie.
Just answer thruthfully and no one will get hurt!

ok lets get it on.

--1-- You have just joined a release group (just to get pres of 
      course...after all, you ARE a courier) and tonight they will 
      release a whole bunch of big juicy appz for you to pre. 
      At the same time a boy/girl ask you to go out with him/her... 
      what do you do?

	A. I stay at my computer and pre like a mf, i can get a 
           boy/girl on the net.

	B. I go out on that date (maybe i get lucky) and hope he/she 
           has a puter at home so you can pre from there.

	C. I will do neither, i will stay home and watch tv with 
           mom and dad.

	D. Whats a pre?

--2-- The feds have confiscated your computer cuz they belive you 
      might have been doing bad things with it.. what will you do 
      about it?

	A. I will raise hell and phone them feds every 5 minutes 
	   telling them to give my puter back cuz i need to pre some.

	B. I'll just get my backup puter that i have hidden in my 
	   closet in case the feds come by.

	C. I wont do a thing, i dont really need my computer, i 
	   can watch tv instead.

	D. Whats a computer?

--3-- You just got on a pretty phat site, but you notice that 50% of the
      couriers are cheating in one way or another, what do you do?

	A. I get fucking pissed off and immediatly inform the siteop so 
           he can deal with the trash.

	B. I tell the siteop politely to remove the cheaters or myself.. 
	   up to him.

	C. I start cheating myself, since everyone else id doing it.. 
	   why not me?

	D. Whats a site?

--4-- You are asked by Paradigm Class and Divine to pre for them, but 
      they tell you that you only can pre for one of the groups, what 
      do you do?

	A. I go behind their backs and pre for all 3.

	B. I pic the one wich is best at the moment.

	C. They all suck so i try to narq on them as much as i can.

	D. Whats a Paradigm Class and Divine? Ice cream?

--5-- A good friend of your's asks you if you want to start a new 
      courier group with him (not a crappy  5 min to make group that 
      dies after 1 week) what do you do?

	A. You tell him that you'd love to but that you are too loyal 
           to leave the group you are with now so you have to denie.

	B. You like the idea and since you dont have anything else 
           to do you say yes.

	C. You tell him that you will do it if he supplies you with 
	   shells and pres.

D. Whats a courier?

--6-- You are confronted by a very angry courier who says you are 
      cheating and he is going to get the siteop to get you removed, 
      what do you do?

	A. I will myself contact the siteop and tell him what that 
           courier has been saying, and since i dont cheat im not 
           really worried.

	B. I will get pissed and start yelling at him and see to it 
           that hes the one who will be removed.

	C. I will try to make the siteop delete all logs so that no 
           one will see that i cheated.


D. What time is it?

Did you have most A's? if so you are damn good courier and a loyal 
member of a very lucky group. (if you got this you were probably 
cheating)

Did you have most B's? if so you are a good courier but you need to 
chill down. (Most couriers got this i suspect)

Did you get most C's? if so you are a disgrase to the whole courier 
community and should be banned from all sites and all groups.
(i'm ashamed to be a courier when guys like this run around)

Did you get most D's? if so.. how did you get this mag in the first 
place?

End of quiz.. now wasnt that fun?          //PaleDeth





We have bugged several appartments with hidden microphones, all 
are located in famous scene ppl's homes.. this is what can be heard 
from them!


Tklp's home.

Tklp's mother - Time to go to bed.
Tklp - But mom, i gotta test a release before we get it out.
Tklp's mother - I told you to go to bed.. no excuses.
Tklp - I guess we dont have to test it.. probably works anyway.


Bizzy's home.

Bizzy - I need energy.
Bizzy's mother - Ok i'll connect you to the socket as soon as this 
                 tv program is done.
Bizzy - Need pow w w w ... shutting down mainframe ...


Lester's home.

Lester - C'mon detroit.. lets do it before mom gets home.
NDetroit - But it hurts.
Lester - Dont be such a wuss.
NDetroit - Ok ok but do it quickly, and dont make it bleed again.
Lester - oh happy days .. here i come..

More inside scoops to come next week... this is PaleDeth for NWR.

=---------[ Lester's Movie Review Section ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 



Uhh.... 
Lester didn't go see any movies this week..

He just stayed at home and masturbated...

---------------[SJ's Three Questions for the Utils Scene]-----------------


  Recently, SJ set out to find the answer to 3 of the UTILS scene's
  most pressing questions.
  He asked the leaders of each of the scene's largest utils releasing
  groups the following questions:

1.) In your opinion: what makes an utils group a top utils group, such 
    as [the group that you run]?

2.) There is a big question about SIZE in the utils world, such as 100 
    megs max size, or more.. Are you for/against it, and why?

3.) What do you think makes a "true" utils group: ripping CD's that 
    you bought on your $/carding stuff, or pure supply off your 
    work or contacts?


  Here are the responses:

    =-------------------------------=

kflex, SiEGE Leader:

-What makes your group so good?
1.) A good combination of both people and products. If you don't have 
    good people you might as well hang it up. Same goes for having access 
    to good quality titles to release.

-Util size limits?
2.) Right now it's all messed up...

<S^J> how so?

    -Some sites are stuck at 100 mb, while others are as high as 200. 
    With every new release of a util they get bigger.....and soon we'll 
    have to decide whether or not to release a good util based only on 
    size, and that sux.
    With the iso scene taking off as it is, I'd prefer to see a limit 
    established where there's a breakpoint.  For instance..........if a 
    util was over say, 150MB, it would automatically be put out iso and 
    not warezed.  That'd be a good limit for games also.

<S^J> hmm so u would rls oversize if rls worth it?

    -Of course.

Cash or contacts?
3.) Carding is lame, totally lame.  Buying is ok, contacts are best!  
    All carding does is get more people on our backs trying to take us 
    down, cause you're talking real dollars, not "potential" dollar sales.

4.) if you're planning on publishing this...................DIE!

    =-------------------------------=

Jaydee, PFT Leader

-What makes your group so good?
1.) The people in it, of course, I dunno, we got the right dudes!

-Util size limits?
2.) I dont care about size, if I rip something, I rip all the crap 
    and if it still is 140 megs, I'd release. I discussed earlier 
    today with one-30,  how we´d want to keep clipart in some 
    releases, not clipart collections, but some program are worthless 
    without the clipart...

-Cash or contacts?
3.) Well, they are all utils, no matter if they are carded or bought,
    but there´s alot of crap out there. Major utils cant be carded, cd´s 
    are preferable.
<S^J> would u say that parts 1 and 3 are are 'true' utils groups? 
      and part 2 for cracking groups?

    -I think so. Yes, cracking groups... laff, they are so worthless.
    donno why they call themself cracking group, they have no real 
    suppliers and crack shareware, but if they ever get some major 
    thing  they release it anyways.
<S^J> so who would  provide u with the cute ftp /secure crt  if not them?

    -I dont care,they release whatever they get their hands on, trps 
    even released a game: doh, and this week fallen released 2 oracle 
    things which didnt need crack or anything, and last week 2kad fucked 
    up on some MGI PhotoSuite. How can they be a cracking group ?

4.) Fuck off stix and lester, I hate you guys. That would be it.
    I wanna diss Eternal too, he suck haaaaard!!!! 

    =-------------------------------=

Toth, RiSE Leader

What makes your group so good?
1.) There are many qualities that make up a util releasing group. 
    The most important thing in my personal opinion however, is that 
    a util group should release quality retail utilities. 
    I am not speaking of the majority of cracked shareware and webwarez 
    being released, but almost always retail software that you have 
    to either special order, or purchase from a store. Not every store 
    release is viable either, if the release is junk. 
    RiSE in particular l.applications due to the large ammount of 
    feedback we get on them. However there are a large ammount of art 
    utilities, Operating systems, and other quality programs out there 
    that would be considered quality releases.

Util size limit?
2.) Ahh the age old question of size limits. At this time I still 
    believe there should be a 100 meg top, aside from releases that 
    are specially approved on a majority of sites. There are two major 
    reasons for this. 
    First we have to remember not everyone yet has access to fast 
    connections, maybe in another couple of years a size increase 
    should be made, but not quite yet. Second, if we have no limit on 
    the size of applications.. why not go straight i fast connections 
    or cd copiers for that reason. Warez are for the masses not for those 
    with fast connections to horde. We're providing free software here 
    and should make it accessible.

3.) A true utils group is ripping QUALITY store bought releases and 
    working through contacts you are able to aquire in companies. 
    Carding ends up with the webwarez concept and in my opinion should 
    be an area of releasing on its own. The util scene is largely 
    separated on its judgement on who should release what and keep it 
    all under utils, but the util scene of today is really a variety of 
    catagories. Retail, webwarez, cracked shareware. The util scene 
    Function I believe, one that will set standards for groups to follow, 
    disk limits, etc. No one has bothered to take the time to form one 
    and there is mass confusion by many groups on the need to have a 
    standard. We need to, as groups and people, work together more in 
    order to set guidelines for ourselves to follow so things are more 
    organized and quality is increased.

<S^J> hmmm, who would get u stuff like cuteftp/securecrt etc?

    -In my personal opinion, cracking groups should either release 
     reg code generator or the program with a crack for the public. 
     Thats another issue a util scene based SPA or Function should 
     come up with. There are both keygens and software with a code 
     being released and all it's doing is wasting disk space on sites 
     which, though, if you take just a few applications is relativly 
     small, though when you go through everything ever released, 
     can take up quite a lot of room.

4.) * Toth nods
    I'd like to send some shoutouts too all of the members of RiSE for 
    all their loyalty and support, then to everyone out there who has 
    enjoyed our products. It's your feedback and support that keeps us 
    going.  Then some personal shoutouts to Slice, Idyllwild, Return, 
    Damus, and Flounder for being such buds, and helping so much. And 
    then to ALL of my friends out there in the scene =)

UncleJohn, Corp Leader

What makes your group so good?
1.) First and foremost i'd have to say the crackers, with all the new 
    protection out there, without crackers, we'd be without some very 
    useful programs. Second, and not far from first is organization 
    and good leadership. Without those factors, everybody ends up 
    running around like chickens with their heads cut off.

Util size limits?
2.) There are certain programs that NEED to be released that big. 
    You dont want to rape a program of all of its essential/main 
    functions, because then you might as well not release it.

Cash or contacts?
3.) In my mind, what makes a good utils group is having inside 
    contacts, and getting stuff from your work to supply. Back when 
    i first started this stuff, there were no web pages to card 
    software off of, there was no such thing as "WebWarez". We all 
    had to scrape our resources to find something good to release. 
    Back then, there wasn't as much crap as there is today being 
    released. Certain groups that i wont mention seem to like to 
    get all of their stuff that way. They aren't a utils group, 
    but sometimes that stuff is useful.

4.) Sure, i'll say hi to a few people, Davngol, chinablue(miss ya 
    guys!), My corp staff - Great work, and everyone else that has 
    helped me out in the past.

Eviltea, DoD Leader

Why is your group so good?
1.) That encompasses many things. The first thing that comes to mind 
    is infrastructure. Without a proper "system" in place, the final 
    product will not be up to snuff.  

    Any group can release mass qty's, but if its:

    A) a dupe
    B) non-working
    C) worthless crap no-one wants.
    D) poorly distributed/packaged.

    Whats the point in doing it in the first place?

    Any of the above reflects very poorly on a groups reputation 
    and overall longevity of a group. We've been here 5 years+.  
    We haven't been around this long by accident. Hard work and 
    dedication is what it takes.

    Producing a working/quality product is foremost in our eyes.  
    Loyalty and experience is also very important aspect of 
    Drink or Die. All of our staff/council has been around since 
    the dark ages, and the average age of them is probably around 25.  
    Kiddies running the show will reflect poorly on any group.  
    Greed and For-Profit groups are also big downfalls.  
    We have always had the attitude of keeping it "Fun and Non-Profit".

2.) You have to grow to accomodate the current situation the software
    market is in. Obviously everything today that is produced by 
    software developers is bigger than it was a year or 2 ago.  
    But, for the most-part, on the scenes side, overall speed, site 
    capacity, bandwidth etc has grown even more. 
    We take the same stance that some of the respected games groups 
    have taken recently (ie: Razor, PDM, Class) in raising their limits.  
    We see no reason to rape a quality release just to satisfy an old 
    and outdated disk-limit.  

    100 MB is just too small for todays world. 150MB is definately a 
    more reasonable limit in DOD's eyes and will soon be the standard 
    on all of our sites regardless of anyone else's opinion.  

3.) Well, we always have believed that "inside" contacts and
    store-suppliers are definately preferable and we pride ourselves 
    in having such contacts.
    Its unfortunate that so much today is distributed via the Web 
    in the form of time-trials and eval's, because it leads sometimes 
    to frankly, shitty releases.

    I know personally. I hate downloading a quality title only to 
    find some lengthy 5-step Houdini crack process only to find 
    it is splattered with "Demo Version" or the like.  
    I find it disturbing and get pissed off when we aquire a 
    "Final-Retail" or store-bought copy of the same thing after
    someone has released a cheesy cosmeticaly or install-handicapped
    version.
    Some groups have that, "Well, we got it to work..", or "So what if 
    you have to change your system clock to install it.." attitude.   

    Everyone out there knows the feeling..  When you download something,
    unpack it and glance at the nfo, you get that gut-feeling that 
    this shit ain't gonna work or is some hodge-podge psychedelic 
    creation of some first-time cracker.  Poor packaging, along with 
    the "jump-thru hoops mastah" install instructions is always a 
    dead-giveaway.  I dont know why some of the newer groups just 
    dont pay attention to detail and quality of the final product.

    Nonetheless, web releases are a necessary evil these days.  If its 
    a quality product that isn't available first via an insider or 
    store-buy, we always hope that we are the ones to get it via the 
    web to let our capable crackers properly crack it and clean it up, 
    instead of having some idiot from one of the notorious webware-only 
    releasing groups fuck it up.

  So... that about sums it up.. To all the respondants, NWR thanks you
  for your time, patience, and honesty. There are a lot of people
  that could learn a few things from this article...


=----------------------------------=--------------------------------------=

--------------[RTS PFTP Scandal]--------------

  A lot of you have probably already seen the file "rts-pft.txt" that
  comes attached with this week's NWR. It details both the presence, 
  and use of pftp on the shells of several prominent RTS members.

  A lot of you are probably saying "RTS? why cares? they are not a 
  top 5 group... why is it shocking to discover this?"

  A lot of you know why... 
  RTS is one of the scenes most respected and admired groups. Not 
  because they trade a lot of megs, or because they have the best WHQ,
  or shells. They are respected for their integrity, and the fact that 
  they are a group that is, for the most part, "family".. 
  (this fact is suspect at this point, see "scene news" for details)

  To many outsiders, it doesn't seem to make sense that RTS would use
  PFTP to further itself... why would it need to?

  The scene inside RTS however tells a different story.
  There are stories of RTS's leaders not caring whether or not their
  members use PFTP or not.. Indeed, there are stories of couriers who
  were given the ultimatem: USE PFTP OR GET OUT!!

  Hmmm.. Perhaps things were a little more group grim inside the
  group than many had expected.....
  Maybe the 4 couriers in rts-pft.txt were not using pftp to further
  themselves in the trading games (indeed, when was the last time you
  saw "Speedy" trade, much less weektop anywhere? <g> )
  Perhaps those traders were simply doing whatever it took to stay as
  members in their favorite online family... If thats the case, then
  it is a very sad thing indeed... If not, well.. 
  
  I guess it is up to them to explain themselves to the scene...

--------------------[Regarding PFTP]---------------------


  The scene has been at a crossroads for a long time, regarding PFTP...
  We are the digital elite... We move the files faster and better than
  any corporation, government, or organization. The level of competition
  on our sites, and in our release groups approaches what amounts to much
  much more than a game...

  We do everything that it takes to move the files the fastest.
  This is not a game.
  
  Or is it?

  A long time ago, someone by the name of pSI invented a little
  something that changed the face of our "game" forever. He invented
  a couriering aid called "PFTP". Sure, it wasn't the first program
  invented to help out a courier, but it certainly was the most
  dramatic. Within a short time of its release, lifelong mediocre
  couriers became legends.. weektopping 20 or 30 sites at a time...

  This wasn't to last. 
  PFTP was quickly banned on most sites, because it gave the trader
  using it an unfair advantage.. it wasn't "normal" trading. 

  Those who chose to use it, in attempt to faster move files were
  branded cheaters, and expelled from sites. PFTP today is a word
  that is synonamous with "cheating" in the scene...

  The reason for that is simple. The advent of PFTP, RiSCFTP, NFTP, and
  and the like meant that, for the first time, the technology was
  better than the person. For the first time, PFTP traders were beating
  "normal" traders.. sometimes by a large margin. 

  At that point, the competition that we call "trading" became a "game"
  more than it ever has in its history. Perhaps "game" is the wrong
  word... perhaps we should use the word "sport". 

  After all... in athletics, something that enhances your performance
  beyond normal boundaries, and gives you an unfair advantage is called
  "Steroids"...

  In the trading scene, its call PFTP.

-----------[The Scene News]-----------

All the news thats fit to print... 
and then some...

-RiSC is back?? RISC IS BACK??? WTF???
 Are they for real?? Are they legit?? Is that FOUR RiSC traders on
 the NWR Top 10?? What year is this?? Will someone please msg me
 when its time to wake up??

-It appears that a bunch of people from RTS, the now-dead MnM, and
 a handful of other groups (including RiSC) have all jumped ship, 
 to form a new group called "Quasar" (QSR).. No word yet on who
 is leading..

-what is up with that crazy mgd? first the dude owned STH for like 2
 months, now he refuses to trade there, only upping the occasional
 pre... mgd now claims "FiRESiTE = only true site"
 wacky.

-www.defacto2.net got HACKED early this morning... hahahah...
 pretty lame hack, if you ask me, but at least whoever did it
 had a message to spread... (See the attached html files in this
 issue's zipfile)
 This takes me back to the olden days when our two scenes were
 constantly at war... They were the  31337 h4x0r dud3s, and we
 were the "warez pups" or some shit like that... bleh..
 i hope there is a big war, and everyone gets pissed off and starts
 pointing fingers and narking each other... bleh... ;p

-Not much more to say this week, other than bummer about the RTS thing, 
 and good work to SJ on his articles... oh, and lester: get off your
 fat ass and write something!!

--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors, we all love them even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us. And these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, your name will not be included, but we
do not add rumors like that say "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion"
because we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore
there is no hard evidence of that rumor, so if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!


-Rumor has it that RiSC's recent success is due to divine intervention
 from none other than: Eagle_1!!!  Apparently Eagle_1 has been guiding
 the group from his grave, offering his usual blend of sage advice:
 "trade!! damn you all!! everyone sucks!! eternal is good!!... i love  donuts!!"

-Rumor has it that mandrake's wedding to "George", his aussie lover
 has been CALLED OFF, so that mandrake can rethink his commitment
 to the warez scene..

-Rumor has it that both STiX and duranged have been unable to trade
 worth a damn recently, because they have a cyber-sex obsession with 
 each other!! Apparently the both spend up to 10 hours a day, just 
 sex0ring each long distance! Hrmm... what is the sound of one hand
 typing?

=-------------------------------------=--------------------------------------=
