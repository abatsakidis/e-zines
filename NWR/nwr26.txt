    Wooohoooooo! we are fucking on time. Can you believe it? This 
    is a big issue! We have lots of shit. A biased utils report, a 
    profile of Amnesia, and some other shit too. 
    The profile of a prominent group will happen maybe once a month. 
    This is the first and kind of rushed, I expect to do more thorough 
    of a job next time. But I hope you enjoy and learn from it. 
    Enjoy the mag!

        Its beginning to feel a lot like christmas...

    Well.. i'm currently drunk, as i put this 26th issue of NWR
    together. To all who i insult tonight in my drunken wu-rage:
    uhhh.. sorry..
        To all who deserve it: well.. dammit.. you deserve it! ;)
    
        Nice fucking work to Bud, who comes at us this week with
    the first of his weekly biased utils reports.. I am still on 
    the lookout for an experienced and active member of the games
    scene who might want to do a similar weekly thing..
         Thanks this week to digger, mgd, and kane for clarifying
    a few historical facts for me, and thanks to sick for the sweet
    log of duranged, and his religi0us hax0ring... ;p
         The .jpg that we included this week is from the most ridiculous
    online auction item i have ever seen.. go over to:
    http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=46597669
    and check that shit out.. ;p
         For all those interested, i have also included a few more
    logs regarding the HADES/cardiel situation, courtesy of our good
    friend, zeus.. For those of you who don't want to read them all,
    and like to be spoon-fed your opinions: CARDIEL SUCKS, and deleted
    HADES cause he is a little pussy.. there we go.. :)

        We also have some AWESOME funny logs. One called "lamelog.log"
    in which a pretty fucking dumb LND member goes off about how
    much he hates NWR (hey, i didn't know i traded!)  ;D
        And we have a fucking INCREDIBLE log of BARNIL, pretending
    to be a shellbox owner, pimping himself out to RiSC/AOD/DMS/RTS,
    and whoever else he can fuck with.. read it!  :)

         Coded mag/HTML version coming soon... welcome back bacid!

-----------[ ndetroit's sites and stats section ]-----------


    Oh man.. if you run a US site, and its affiled with Class,
  just do yourself a favor, and pack the damn thing up, cause
  it just isn't your week..

    The respected US site, XENOSIS (XNS) finally closed its doors
  on dec2 this week, after (apparently?) being narked out.
  At the time of its close, its affils were CLASS, RiSE, DNG, 
  and PHOENiX... The site is perhaps best known for its actions
  earlier this summer when they dropped MnM after lackluster
  support.
    Tower Of Power is also rumored to be going down soon, no
  word yet on why. TOP's affils are currently CLASS and Siege.
    That leaves IC (i'm sure i'll be corrected if i'm wrong)
  as class's only US HQ right now, tho a source from class made
  it quite clear to me that they are *A* US HQ, not *THE* CLS USHQ..
  everyone got that?  ;p
    While we are on the subject of downed US sites, no-one is
  quite sure what is happening with DF.. its been down for a 
  while now, and the siteop is nowhere to be found..
    
    Over on the other side of the pond, yet ANOTHER class site
  has inexplicably disappeared. MPower is down, and there seems
  to be a bit of contraversy over whether or not it will ever
  be returning. One staff member i spoke to assured me that
  it would be "back soon", while another said "there is no
  way it will ever be coming back"...
    Reading between the lines gets you: "We sure hope it
  comes back soon, but we haven't heard a damn thing from
  the boxop, so it could be gone for good, but how the fuck 
  do we know?"

    DMS picked up yet ANOTHER site, this week stealing MDK 
  from AoD (formerly AOD WHQ).. Add that site to the DMS MP3 HQ,
  the DMS ISO HQ, the DMS VCD HQ, the DMS pr0n HQ (not i'm NOT
  shitting you) and the heap of warez sites that they have, and
  that brings the total number of DMS sites to... .. 257.
    Ermm... maybe i counted wrong..   ;p

    PDM is pre'ing to STH now, apparently.. PDM trying to woo
  themselves a new HQ?
    DST picked up OGN and uCF this week, giving them XFORCE, MFD,
  OGN, and MFD... ermm... can you say DUAL-GROUPED?
    TH, the site that has been "going down forever" for the past
  2 months has now decided that it will be up forever.. 
    Firesite, the new SEiKO WHQ continued to do well, on the 
  strength of over 5 megs (!) of Seiko pre's this week, including
  the tremendously useful: 
  (biohazard/TFA/TEE - EFF - AAY) Phony.Utility.in.Disguise.Win98-SEiKO

    Apparently Millenium has a new WHQ, called RAY... ... ..... or..
  ermm.. wait.. nm, mnm is dead, sorry, i forgot... in fact, RAY is
  the new iND WHQ... so, congrats to the RAY staff on that nice
  affil.

    
  
=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. 
	Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... 
heh... fuck off and die..
=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=

          The Top Ten sites for this week are:

	                                   
          x3 FS -*- STH -*- ET -*- E -*- MP
          x2 RDX -*- ROC -*- DLS -*- IC -*- MDK



   
 Sadly, no TOP 10 Courier Section this week, as i was unable to get enough
 top sites.. :(
 If you wanna grab some weektops and DCC them my way, would be greatly
 appreciated... thanks!




 * = no weektop this week.

Lester's Biased Courier Report

Well it's been another week, I got the good news of my super shell being 
up today, so next week I should actually have alot to say! But let's do 
it one more time halfassed.

Dimension: Continuing to grow strong internally, owning their sites and 
other peoples. Starting to regain the strength they had at the beginning. 
Will it continue? (I guess I should know that)

Devotion: Well shit, I just found out Jaydee isn't Devotion anymore, and 
word on the street is that a few others wont be either. Jaydee was about 
all they had going for them besides Garoto. So Dev is really up a shits 
creek.

Risc: Well havent' we responded maturely to the loss of E? Hah, and you 
ask me why they left. Take a look in the mirror folks. 

VGN: See below, semaj remarks. But as you can see in the rumors later, 
it's rumored STH will be leaving VGN shortly. Just too bad for STH 
it's a little too late. VGN still alive and kicking though, TC is 
trading and I saw Daman on some weektops. But Semaj was a dick so I'll 
say they suck again.

AOD: I'm really sorry, I just dont have much to say about you guys. 
Morbid is elite though, oh ya and Siim is real cool for giving me the 
TFA quote.:)

TFA: Hah, ask and ye shall receive huh? see quote of pftp action later. 
Go live in a hole boys, I was also messaged by the mp3 coordinator of 
the group, apparantly they specialize in porn/mp3/warez/art/iso/vcd. 
So aren't they talented.

MNM: Glen quit, what a laugh, the only thing they had going for them and 
they fucked it up!



WEEKLY HAPPENINGS:


insanity-> 200- |< > 6 | nightshad | Detected: pftp stealth | Idle for 00:34

<[semaj]> "VGN: Yew Suck!" 
<[semaj]> wanna fix that next week please?
<Lester> what else is there to say?:)
<[semaj]> we arent dead
<[semaj]> fix it
<Lester> i didn't say you were dead now did i
<[semaj]> close enough
<[semaj]> you wanna elaborate on dms
<[semaj]> do some nice shit for vgn also
<Lester> you wanna not tell me how to do my report?:)

Just a couple quotes, thats all. Enjoy the mag, it's big this week:)

-----------[ Bud's Biased Utils Section ]-----------



Bud's Biased Utils Report #1 (see below)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            
  Welcome to the biased Utils report. It's been a while since the last one 
graced the pages of NWR, and I wasn't involved with that, but with the 
mass quantity of utils released each day, people need to be able to 
weed out the shit, and those who consistantly put out a good effort
should get the credit. So lets get on with it...

  Take note I'm writing this on Saturday, so it takes into account only 
the releases of the week up to the time I finish this crap. However, I'll 
probably spew out a bunch of junk from earlier in the month. These won't 
be counted in the groups score however.

Notes: 

Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of 
            mail & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like 
            it... SCREW YOU =]

Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of 
          releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher 
          score. Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP 
          will lower a groups score. However on the occassion that a title is
          nuked which I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES 
          PRECEDENCE. Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for 
          any other reason I see fit.

Week: Week is based from 11/29/98 to 12/05/98 - any late 1205 releases were 
      probably missed. I'm in EST time zone so dates/times run according to it.


Groups: (In no particular order)


PIRATES WITH ATTITUDE - 

Well, aside from one HUGE ass 200MB+ release of MS SQL 7 Desktop & Server, the 
PWA crew has been pretty quiet this week. Not much to say here really - that one 
title was quality, and the couriers loved it - when they weren't nuked for size. 
Good marks to PWA just for being consistant over the years, and 7 marks for the 
SQL title, cuz a lot of people have been waiting for it.
Total: 7/10


THE CORPORATION: 

Corp is affirming that they are serious about their comeback, but then how many 
times has Uncle John tried this? No matter. I have mixed feelings with Corp 
(being part of an earlier brief Corp comeback), they have the talent - if the 
important players are active. So far it seems as if they are - but honestly 
someone should teach these guys to use Max compression when they package. Releases 
are steady - and good points go for releasing Macromedia Director 7. With a couple 
months under their belt now, it looks as if they're here to stay. 
Total: 7/10 


RISE: 

Quality over quantity - very true of RISE, but I almost want to kick them and 
say "Release More!!" Almost no presence this week, but still overall a true 
quality group, and consistantly bringing out excellent titles. Thus even though 
we didn't see anything from em this week I'm still giving em a good score just 
for being RISE =) Had they released something they probably  would've seen at 
least an 8.
Total: 6/10


SIEGE: 

Nothing extraordinary, but some decent utils, and some cool Director plugins. 
Should be some more of these coming with Director 7 here. A couple of dupes 
didn't help their effort, and having to put out a fixed Extra Office Client 
4.6 took a point off their total, but still a very good week for these guys. 
Arguably the best group this week. Since their cracks keep showin' up in LND 
rels, maybe I should give em extra....
Total: 8/10


X-FORCE:

Woah, what's happened here? Just Lotus Betas this week, and not great at 
that :P I mean, really, Beta2_163.1 NORTH AMERICAN VERSION ??? Not a whole
lot of people want to take the time to download stuff like this, but I guess 
there must be some. They lost out on SQL 7 to PWA, which is a blow as we saw 
some betas from XF in that area. This is NOT the X-Force of old... hell it's 
not even the Clip-Force we all know and love ;) Hopefully we'll see them back 
again next week.
Total: 5/10 


SHOCK: 

Decent steady releasing... but then they've always had steady releasing. No nukes, 
nothing broken, no incredible titles but consistancy is what works best. (Note to 
the idiot who uploaded Bill Power Plus 4.6 -SHOCK - the group released it months 
ago. They released 5.0 since that time. Please quit the courier game as your vain 
attempts for credits are pathetic). Good points for having a steady week. They took 
some heat for re-releasing what LND stole but tough shit.
Total: 7/10


ENTITY: 

A VIRUSFREE repack on the IBM Visual Age Generator release didn't help what was 
a slow week for Entity. They've lost a lot of the dominance they showed in past 
weeks, and saw the loss of MGD to Corp about a month. Still, they're far from out 
of it. Not much else to say, see ya next week guys.
Total: 6/10


PENTIUM FORCE TEAM:

PFT continues to be a releasing force, and one that seems to be underestimated by 
quite a bit. Steady releasing again this week. A lack of ego's and good quality 
titles make them an excellent group. No nukes or fix's for the week... hrmm I 
dunno what else to say so I'll stop there. They get 8 points for an excellent week.
Total: 8/10


LEGENDS NEVER DIE:

What THE FUCK happened to this group? The current incarnation of LND, even with 
some cool members (hiya Powertool,) does not live up to past editions. Check out 
releases saying "Cracked by: Siege" - LND does not have the cracking talent it 
once did, and now resorts to taking cracks from other groups. They also got 
nailed for stealing serials from SHK and that earned them a nuke on a lot of sites. 
The blame for all this lays entirely on Grad, and he's admitted as much, but 
refuses to change his ways. Now LND does have some legit releases, but the crap 
outreaches the quality. Lets hope someone in LND can talk some sense into Grad. 
Or get him to quit the scene. LND place dead last for trying to take the credit of 
others.
Total: 3/10


PINNACLE:

Pee N' Cee had a HORRIBLE October, then improved a bit in November. So what is 
ahead for the PNC crew? Well in the past week, not much. Showbase Forms is an ok 
title, File Fission Wizard I've used (and released) so I won't harp on it... 
but thats ALL Pinnacle has done this week, and that won't win them top marks. 
Pinnacle should take their own advice, FUCK THE COPYRIGHT - a little more often, 
and get their name out there. Otherwise you have to wonder why sites like (their WHQ) 
hang on to them.
Total: 5/10


DRINK OR DIE:

Alright DOD is one of my favorite groups, they've established their name over the 
years - quality over an extended period of time is the top factor in a good group, 
nevermind these 3 month wonders that pop up and then promptly die. That said it 
wasn't a great week for them, but for all those expecting DOD to die everytime 
they have a slow week: Fuck off and get a clue.
The DOD team picked up MNS this week as well, strengthing the site side of things.
Total: 6/10


HERITAGE:

It's been rough for HTG the last while. They are putting a bit more out in 
the past few weeks, and JrMafia is putting a lot off effort into bringing 
the group back to its feet. Both John Astig and JrMafia are cool guys 
(thought I'd plug em). Now they just need a stronger supplying team - a lot 
of dupes and nukes are really hurting them. Near the end of the week HTG lost 
their WHQ, MNS, to the Drink or Die clan, another blow against them. Not a stellar
week, as the points show. 
Total: 5/10


REBELS:

Rebels is simply a cool crew, and while I haven't used a lot of their 
releases over the years, I've never had a single problem with what I did use. 
RBS had a slow week with just 2 standard releases at the time I was writing this, 
so they're low on points, but don't let that fool you.
Total: 6/10


So thats it for this week. Top slot goes to PFT & SGE for a well rounded week, 
and LND hit the bottom of the barrel. Cracking groups were totally left out 
because I don't have the time to check out all those little keymakers... it's not 
that I don't appreciate them though, its just too much work. Groups may be added 
or dropped week to week as they keel over and die, and make their presence known... 
now enough of this shit. Go actually USE something.... feed yer feeble minds.

                                                                       - Bud

--------------[AMNESIA Retrospective]--------------


Note: Every now and then we are going to try to feature a bit of history
      on a famous or influential scene group. The first of our NWR Retrospectives
      focusses on Amnesia.. read on if you want to learn a bit about what the
      scene used to be like.......



    Amnesia was started 199? by Lester, HR, The Resistance and Captain Blood. 
They had all been in Malice for the past few months and after a bonehead move 
by Dorian Hawkmoon, they decided to walk, and let the best malice people follow 
them. This was how it began, originally Rapier and Amnesia were nearly the same 
group, but it never panned out, thus spawning the later rivalry. Amnesia was 
rocky at the start, Captain Blood being named as a narc and becoming one of 
the more hated men in the scene at that time. He was removed from the Amnesia 
leadership and then it became just the three amigos. Amnesia quickly grew into a 
power. 
	Some of the better traders in the scene who were already in Malice, 
quickly moved over to the newer, less fucked up group. Lester quickly capitalized 
on this, picking up some of the better traders from smaller groups with alot of 
potential. TSA, Yoss, Crazy, Aurora(mgd), Davan, Shafter. Two of the top sites 
at that time moved over to the group. BBX and CRC. The problem was simply that 
there was not enough loyalty to go around. Risc being highly threatened by AMN's 
emergence as a solid competitor, began deleting traders who wouldn't quit, nuking 
them x2, doing whatever it took to take AMN out of the fold. So many many traders 
would move to risc, at the end of AMN, only Lester and Prozac were left from day one 
of AMN. But it was one hell of a ride. AMN dethroned Risc and removed the monopoly 
on sites that they had, also taking the BBS scene away from them as well. In the peak 
of AMN's days they were undisputedly #1 on BBS and NET. Having such bbses as Street 
Spydrs, Malevolence, The Screwy Gecko, etc. 

	AMN linked up as Official Couriers for PWA, a task that has since not been 
accomplished. But AMN was not perfect, there was the incidents with Trite and Dreamland. 
Couriers leaving and trying to steal people. Gahn breaking off and forming Empire, 
a group war that amounts essentially to what MNM and DMS is right now. I just wanted 
to sum it up for you guys, included below is some quotes from people who were around 
or in AMN during it's days. Also are some info files, I could not find the first info 
unfortunately. 

                                        -Lester - Co-Editor/EX-AMN Founder

QUOTES -

<MossyOak> From what i can remember about AMN.. they had a really neat looking 
           header in their .nfo file.  Laugh.  Very organized group.. and very 
           good couriers.. much of the top talent from my trading era was in or 
           had came from AMN at some time.  Too bad the trite/DL thing brought 
           it down.. or maybe Lester would still be AMN leader.. therefore resulting  
           in no MNM vs DMS fights back in the day.. :)

<_HR_> Sometimes you need to break apart a group to bring its members together, 
       thats what AMN did for Malice.

<MossyOak> i remember them :)
<MossyOak> i remember when you wanted me to join AMN :)
<MossyOak> i remember Fubar was AMN USHQ :)
<MossyOak> i remember AMN was very good until whats his name
<MossyOak> ummmm
<MossyOak> trite!

<NyteMyST> i think AMN was one of the best groups that had a shitload of potential 
           and gave RISC nice competition. And was also the most fun to be in.

<mgd> AMN? where to start, back then everyone loved us, except risc, because 
      we were their main challenger, we had all the best traders, and sites that 
      were considered to be some of the best ever like BBX and CRC were AMN and 
      SWMP was pretty much made by AMN, on top of that we all did it with us shells 
      and self supplied shells when traders actually deserved any credit for what 
      they did, they weren't a buncha clueless brazillians or isrealis, back then 
      the net was elite and to be even a trader was an honor. I can recall risc 
      phearing us so much that they would allow risc traders run scripts and cheat 
      on risc sites back then just so risc would win - i.e. why bizzy was even worth 
      a damn.
      Also, all the traders in AMN made it in amn cuz they were worthy, not cuz their 
      macros were worthy, no one in AMN used macros, or any trader at that time. Wasnt 
      AMN the only official couriers ever for PWA? what can be called the greatest 
      utils group ever? 


<scan-> when amnesia died it took with it the last true courier scene.

<Caserd> AMN was the bomb..we had hot couriers, good organization/leadership, and 
         lots of fun..the only prob was the fighting and lack of loyalty.. the best 
         couriers ever had went through AMNESiA and it made me feel good to be a part 
         of the organization

<shatter_> well I've been out of the scene for like a long time now....but I remember 
           AMN being a well organized group with leaders with good experience...they 
           had competetive traders...I was asked to join but I guess I liked being in 
           RiSC or whatever group I was in...
           that's about as vague as you can get cuz I don't wanna sound like i'm on 
           crack or some shit

<chinablu_> I have this opinion of Amnesia
<chinablu_> like a little band of Peter Pan boys....mischievous
<chinablu_> fast, great curries
<chinablu_> that just ran all over efnet like little mice getting pre's
<chinablu_> hehe
<chinablu_> hehe that's what i thought of you guys
<chinablu_> cuz of Bomb and you and the rest of the guys
<chinablu_> a little merry band of thieves =)

<kali> AMN, it was fun for awhile, but warez back then was like, you go with whoever 
       is good, it wasnt really about loyalty and AMN fell apart because of a lot of 
       that, not realy loyal people, but i was one of them, but when AMN was on top 
       they werent even letting anybody come close to them, #1 BBS #1 NET

<toast-> AMNESIA was a group formed out of the negative degredation that occurs 
         amongst powerful groups
<toast-> that is, groups that are powerful eventually rub off and form new groups
<toast-> AMN started the seed that has shown true leadership in the new kind of 
         courier group
<toast-> AMN was always the next best, during the RISC-monopoly days
<toast-> many people had no loyalty, while the few did, and carried the seed along
<toast-> the few but dedicated stuck through the thick and thin and taught new 
         traders the same morals: trade and have fun, but kick everyone's ass =)

<thepunish> Amnesia: Great in concept, terrible in implementation


I had hoped to get some quotes from more Risc people, but time limitations 
have made that not possible. I want to thank everyone for contributing.

=----------------------------------=-------------------------------------=

=---------[ Lesters Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 


Home Fries
Starring: Drew Barrymore, Luke Wilson
Rating: 2 and a half / out of 4 stars


Well I would call this a solid date movie. I saw it simply because Psycho 
was sold out that night. Turned out to be a decent flick, funny and different 
from the same old movie you see every week. Drew has been able to put together 
a pretty good string of different roles and she's quite good in them(See Scream, 
Wedding Singer, Ever After). Luke Wilson is her current real life boyfriend and 
he's pretty good in this as well. There's his brother, don't know the guys name 
but he's been in some flicks like Starship Troopers and he's a good goofball. 
Their mom is played by the mom from Home Alone and she's a great neurotic freak. 
The premise of the movie is that Drew is pregnant by a married man. The man is 
the father of Luke's character. He ends up dying and Luke begins to fall in love 
with Drew, and it weaves a nice little comedic web. I don't want to give away all 
the information because that would take away more of the fun. But I suggest you 
see it with your girl, show her your sensitive and into those Drew flicks.


Psycho
Starring: Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche, Viggo Mortensen, William H. Macy, and 
          Julianne Moore
Universal Pictures
Directed by: Gus Vant Sant


Well, I'll be blunt, rent the original and pay true homage to the great fat man. 
If you can't STAND black and white, then go see this. I was disappointed to put it 
mildly. Although Vaughn is quite good in the Norman Bates role, and the other actors 
are all fine actors. They had said the murder scenes were spiced up and gory even by 
todays standards, and that just is not the case, they seem to be hardly gory for even 
those days standards. So rent the other one, fuck the B&W. I would congratulate Vaughn 
on his performance though. He was quite good.

This file was written by Vantmas, a clearly disgruntled member of the scene. 
It is a sad little bit of rambling, written by someone who has nothing better
to do than attack a group that seems to have just a *little* bit of dislike for..
We include it for comedy purposes and also possible truths. Note: we are not
agreeing in any way with what Vantmas has to say.. We will try to add some 
comments to his points.. Enjoy!

CORP: Bunch Of God Damn Retired Circus Clowns

This File is about CORP, the biggest joke (literally) on the scene, and
made up of mainly former Clowns and Video Store Clerks ( "Filmrarians"
as they like to call it).  The scene shouldnt put up with such anticts.
CORP pretty much based its existance around members recruited blatently
from other groups.

First I would like to comment on there releases.  That MS release,
you know, the tutorials one, all i have to say is WOW, what a dumbass
release.  And there Reflections NetApps release, which before packed
was 11 megs, and all of a sudden after packed was 23 megs, deserved
moron release of the year.  Its like getting 20$ from someone,
putting it in your empty wallet, opening it back up and having 60$,
like you wouldnt NOTICE that. (Nice packaging Beck, btw).  And Beck,
who's only friends are in CORP, and they just suck up to him cause
he's a rare cracker, has serious loser problems.  Can he please
make fun of every group other then CORP?  I dont go around making
fun of your freakishly small penis. Beck is clown #1.


clown #2 in corp that deserves a paragraph is mgd a.k.a Midnight Gimp. 
Defected Senior from about 2,000 groups, recently leaving Entity for Corp.
He has the loyalty of my 7 year old brother in a handball game.  He is also 
very power hungry, ironic since he still lives with his mom and he's 32.
just one of those guys you just wish would die or get hired by the circus
again.

*Editors Note* MGD has been clearly loyal to the editor and DMS for 
some time now.

Lets next comment on clown #3, UncleJohn a.k.a AuntJemima.  He is good 
in the heart, but what were you thinking of merging with a shitty group 
Delusion, lost a lot of respect for CORP bro.  First, you inherited a 
true asshole ([Semaj]) and the only cool guy was kicked out for dual 
grouping (knoweffex).  Good one!

*Editors Note* Semaj, I agree.:)

Clown #4 is a man by nature, woman by surgery.  His nick is Easy_.  
He is a member of a group called Massive, known for its massive amount 
of lameness, and leader of Esprit, some sorta couriering group last 
time i checked.  He siteops on a couple sites (to this day i am trying 
to figure out one thing: HOW? ).  Note to Easy: Learn how to speak 
english before cracking a not funny joke.

As i have mentioned before in this report, CORP has blatently tried 
to recruit members from many other groups including: Entity, FCN, 
ACE, Heritage, HV98, RiSE, and FATE (rumored to be making a comeback, 
CORP wanting to recruit there l33t couriers). This is very sad and 
pathetic, not something the scene or its members should be proud of.
Last time i checked, the prupose of the scene was to release things 
that ordinary people could not afford, not to mess it up.  I am 
suprised no one has done anything about it!


Here are the Video Store Clerks, in no particular order:

^Jman^- One of those d00ds thats in like EVERY group, but you dont know
wtf he does, so i'll leave him alone, but his nick deserves a gimp label.

machv- semi-responsible for the breakup of one of the greatest couriering
groups in my opinion, ViCE.  If he's not a chick, he is one god damn 
bitchy dood.  

*Editors Note* Machv is probably completely responsible for the breakup 
of Vice and is a disgrace to the scene.

omega- former RiSE guy, no loyalty whatsoever, came from the Delusion
merger.  Nice guy, one of the very rare CORP members I like.

Lithium- Prez of PGC and formerly of RiSE (Safe to say CORP raped RiSE
of some DECENT members, err, stole i should say).  He acts like he's high
all the time, note to my bro lithium: Cigarrettes DO NOT make you high!
A waste of members space in my opinion.

MrPumpKin/Zip- The only true members of CORP which CORP should be proud of.
Both are very respected and are very good people. Btw, they're the only 
members of CORP who dont own a blow up "girlfriend".  Shout outs go to 
them, why the hell are you in CORP guys???

I would like to comment on Corp's WHQ, which goes by the initials of RAY.
Please, any site that has the same name as my grandpa has some serious
problems.  Please, someone name a site DANIEL so i can laugh my ass off
even more.


Scattered Thoughts:

* They have a site called The Dome, makes me think of my penis everytime I hear
that name @#$@#!$
* Observing Semaj in the channel, I have laughed harder having dinner with my
grandparents then watching him. <[semaj]> prs, your late fucker!=)   
Believe me, I'm laughing on the inside bro. He is clown #4-25.
* CORP's slogan: Why form our own group when we can steal members from existing
groups!  ( I got that from a CORP member, exposing there slogan for the first 
time to the public).
* Rumors were that [Semaj] was 13, but in fact its been confirmed that he's
19, many people did not believe, but its true.
As I close this story, I encourage everyone to join the corp channel and laugh at 
them or give them the cyber finger, they deserve it! Also, I could devote
2 pages on how semaj is an asshole/backstabber/as funny as spoiled milk in your 
cereal, but he doesnt deserve even a paragraph! I end on one final note:

*** Linda_Tripp (~blonde@whitehouse.gov) has joined #corp

'Nuff Said' (If you dont know who she is, then your a moron)

					- the Winged Lewinsky

shout outs: Delphic, Bones, FCN, ENTiTY, SiEGE, Lester (NWR RULES),
Bandido, SlyFox, Tacti[c]

R.I.P The Courier Scene- It was fun while it lasted (ie. Apoc, Empire, ViCE)
The true scene was great while it lasted.  Now the current state of the scene
is crap and i consider it dead, and will never be great like the old school days.
Shout out to PFTP for ruining it, PSi for coding it, and [trite] for releasing
the source code.

--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors, we all love them even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us. And these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, your name will not be included, but we
do not add rumors like that say "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion"
because we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore
there is no hard evidence of that rumor, so if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!


-Rumor has it that STH is SERIOUSLY considering dropping VGN..
 Now that they have lost 2 of their affils, curries are starting to
 ignore it, and they need a massive kick in the ass.. No word on who
 they are looking to pick up... won't be dev or dms, thats for sure..
 That leaves AoD, RiSC, and *cough*MnM*cough*

-Rumor has it that Mandrake's scene comeback could be soon. Seems
 that mandrake and george have returned to .au to live together
 for a while, and listen to old village ppl and Pet Shop Boys albums
 while learning to swing dance... bizarre... 

-Rumor has it that some sites are debating BANNING LND releases
 for their "incorrect releasing behavior".. Shock apparently took
 offense to the fact that LND stole some ISO release, (ermm.. an ISO
 release that was.... ..... already stolen....?) and is on the warpath
 to get LND banned.. we'll see what happens!
=-------------------------------------=--------------------------------------=
