Sigh, Well ND was here for what 1 issue? You gotta give him some
credit for that right? Anyhow, he's gone again for who knows how
long. No games report this week, Devestato was a flake. Hopefully
he won't make this a habit <g>. Ugh, we have stats this week though!
Thanks to Prozax and the AMN guys for getting me them, and thanks  to
me for getting some as well! Anyhow, issue isn't so great but fuck
off and die ok?

 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc.

Biased Courier Report

Well, it's that time again boys and girls. Last week was shit, and I 
shouldn't have even done a report then. But I did and Cedric didn't 
give me any sex for 3 whole days because of it. SO this week I'm gonna
try really hard to Ceddie will put out again.


Amnesia: Well AMN has it's best week in recent memory, showing up on a 
number of weektops, pulling down some #2's and a couple #1's, but primarily 
the #3 spot for them this week. Cardiel and Nail and a few others 
trading alot, with Sins/Stix pre'ing a bunch of stuff. Eek even Lester 
traded this week, too bad he sucks so much. They picked up alot of people 
from the now dead? EPT, including Zenke, Ragger and Darkangel. AMN
showing more and more signs of life here.
Overall: 5/10 (Finally a little action)

Ascension: Well, alot of big talk leading up to this group, and currently 
no megs to show for it. They did make a number of pickups this week, 
including Vulcan from DSC, Cablegod from EPT, Drunkkid from somewhere.
All medium range couriers who could do some megs if they had the chance, 
but Vulcan/Cgod are shelless as I'm writing this and alot of fighting 
and lack of organization has alot of ASN ppl grumbling already. If they
don't get their shit together quick we'll be seeing some people fleeing already. 
Overall: 1/10 (Show me some megs)

AOD: Well Cedric got mad cuz I didn't give them #1 last week, and well I 
can't give them #1 this week either, only because GB and OD owned everyone, 
but AOD did have a good week. Tirre was back for the first time in
awhile and Faith put up some big #'s, few other AOD'ers were out and 
about but not a huge week for them, enough to secure a comfortable #2 spot 
though. They looked to be making a good move by getting Citizen from
Vice, but he quickly returned back to his old team. 
Overall: 6/10(Sorry Ceddie, couldn't do it, maybe more ufo pre's get you #1 this week)

Devotion: Godbless and Officedog explode this week for #1 and #2 on 
virtually every site. I never once raced officedog this week though so 
I'm not sure what he did, but Godbless was on fire. Prozax also puts up some
respectable #'s and earns a spot on the top 10 for the week. Overall one 
of the better weeks for Dev in recent times.
Overall: 8/10(Will GB and OD be able to keep up this pace though?)

Risc: Flavor was trading again this week and managed to sneak up onto 
#10 for the weeks ratings. Psedo was also trading but they didn't have a 
big week. Some news that they picked up some old blood in Gahn/Digger
and some others. Word on the street is they whored a hut from AOD 
already. So maybe some rumblings of life in this old camp.
Overall: 2/10 (Still not much meggage though)

TFA: I don't believe I reviewed these guys before, but since Dirtman 
showed up on the top10 I figured I should go ahead and talk about them. 
Dirt pre'd alot to get these megs but he also does a fair bit of trading,
they also gain Icpphreak from EPT's demise. So good job to TFA for 
holding onto Dirtie:)
Overall: 4/10 ( Good show, let's see more couriers)

Vice: Well it looked bad for Vice at the beginning of this week, losing 
Citizen to AOD and no Nailz or Redman in sight, but Mrpumpkin busted 
out and placed on most weektops with Redman doing some pre'ing, and at weeks
end they had gotten Citizen back into the group. Still some shell 
troubles in this group and not a great deal of trading going on, but 
from where they were at midweek to now, they are doing ok.
Overall: 3/10 ( Need more than just the pumpkin )


Well that's it. I hope you liked it this week, if not well I'll be 
here next week to annoy you again.

 Bud's Biased Utils Report #38
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 No interview this week, sorry didn't have time... this issue is very
 rushed due to a hectic schedule on my part, so we have a new concept
 this week (and only this week): One sentence performace reports for
 each group! So I'm gonna be biased as hell and have some fun, and
 get things back on track next week. Scores remain done as normal
 however, I'll try to to be tooooo biased about that <G>.
  
 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 10/12/99 to 10/18/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.


 Groups: (In no particular order)

 I tied SCUM with RiSE... they both did some sweet titles, SCUM managed to
 do a few more, RiSE's were a bit better, it evens out. FCN had a f@%#ing
 HUGE amount of releases this week, they just weren't up to par with the
 quality shown by RiSE and SCUM, else they'd be right up there as well.

 Special mention to XFORCE for the new Adobe app, Press Ready. Special
 mention to DOD, CORP, PFT, and LND for cutting down on my workload.

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 

Fight Club
Starring: Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter
Rating: 4 out of 4 Stars

I don't even know where to begin. This is the newest offering by 
David Fincher, director of Seven, and he brings to life a truly
original film. I don't even want to talk about what it's about
because it will take away from the joy of the film. Suffice
to say there is alot of fighting and some excellent acting on
the part of Norton, as well as Pitt and Carter even. There's
some good comic relief thrown in and Norton's character has that
dry sense of humor that I love. YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE! 
Edward Norton is one of the best, if not the best actors
in Hollywood today. Next to Kevin Spacey.

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is  usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear  people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination  of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.

Ryche's Really Biased VCD Group Report #21


[21:43] <MR_SLaM> what kind of worthless bastards are writing this shit anyways


Ok, so I haven't been here for what? 4 weeks or something? I got ndtroit's 
disease! Send contributions! Have a telethon! Help me!!! (btw: I saw the faggot 
bitch comment in one of the issues I missed Lester. So suck me beautiful.)


Releases For The Week Of October 12th, 1999 to October 19th, 1999

101299 - Wild_Wild_West_REAL_Screener-CENTROPY
101299 - Breakfast.of.Champions.Telesync-CENTROPY
101599 - Heart.Screener-TiLT
101799 - Superstar.Telesync-IGN
101999 - Deep_Blue_Sea_Screener-CENTROPY
[NUKED] - Blue.Steak.TS.NON-SUBBED-VCD-EUROPE


Jeez.. what a load of shit..


VCD-Europe

Well, after a couple of weeks back in the summer when everyone jumped on the bandwagon
and said they ruled, they continue to show thier true colors with one more in a series of
many fuckups. This time, thier RE-RELEASE of another groups subbed telesync which they
said didnt have subs, actually STILL had subs even though it was labeled, non-subbed.
What's even funnier is they started the whole subs thing by releasing them first. Nice one
guys.

Total - Null



CENTROPY

The other european based group has rejoined us this fall with a few releases here and 
there (some of questionable quality) but scored well with week with 2 screener of pretty
popular movies. Thier Wild Wild West was a re-release of another groups (ReQVCD) fuckup
(bad sound) but the movie did deserve to be released properly. Deep Blue Sea is the smart
shark movie which I thought sucked but its a good release. Breakfast of Champions is the
story of a mental dude who believes everything a certain writer has written. The problem
is the writer has written some really whack shit. Opened in theatres in Sept. to limited
release and has Bruce Willis and Nick Nolte. Nice week from Centropy, the first one in a
looong while. :D

Total - 4 Points



TiLT

New no-name group which may or may not be fake but probably is. Heart is some thriller with
no-name actors (how appropriate) about a girl covered in blood arrested at a grave site.

Total - 1 Point



IGN

I hate it when this group releases Telesyncs. Theyre actually those crappy bootlegs they
buy off the street in NY and then encode them with thier Snazzi cards. Which leads to bad
pixelization and video distortion but I guess thats thier bag. Superstar sucks in every
possible way.. geeky girl acting stupid. Sweet eh?

Total - 1 Point


Well, that about wraps it up.. CENTROPY takes the week with a few good releases in a week
with simply no competition. 

                                                     My work here is done..
                                                         - Ryche -

-----------[The Scene News]-----------

All the news thats fit to print... 
and then some...

Citizen back to Vice, Drunkkid/Vulcan to ASN, Zenke/Ragger/Darkangel to AMN.

Some new sites up, PD and EOE that apparantly are pretty good.

Still no sign of Jaydee(Thank god says Glen).



--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors, we all love them even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us. And these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, your name will not be included, but we
do not add rumors like that say "Glen is going to die a virgin" because
that would be a fact. Or say, "Risc is making a comeback to #1"
because we know that Risc will never be #1 again and therefore
there is no hard evidence of that rumor, so if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!

Rumor has it that Elocin is madly in love with Lester and will be changing
his name to Retsel soon.

Rumor has it that the reason behind Zeus21's nick is that his IQ level is 21,
not his age.
