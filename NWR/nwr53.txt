    Hey.. this one has been a long time in coming.. sorry guys.
    
    This issue has kind of a security theme to it.. Check out the "who
    are those sexy guys" article to read about the included pics..

    Lester had the issue off this week, he deserves it after all the 
    slacking i have been doing, so.. lets home he returns to action next
    week.. ;)

    We got a new section this week, a cracking section by KOKA.. not
    sure how long it will last, but looks like he put a lot of hard work
    into it, so.. kudos to him...

    I have some other pics and articles and whatnot that other people
    have sent me, but those are gonna have to wait until next week.. 

    Our thoughts go out to those who were busted this week, and our respect
    is with those who chose to continue on, and are now faced with running
    razor, paradigm, and class. Good luck to all of you.

    Have a safe week, kids.. Nwr will be out on tuesday sharp next week,
    and as regularly as possible.

-----------[ ndetroit's sites and stats section ]-----------

    
        
    Ok... here i go with the new ? replacing letters scheme.. 
  If you can't figure out wtf site i am talking about, then by all
  means, please go fuck yourself..
  Alright.. lets get started, shall we?

    TO? is down sort of temp/perm with a few HD problems, and as a
  sort of general precaution.. with all the busts and whatnot..
    i? is down pretty much for good, after they lost their link.
  Boxops are looking at moving the site somewhere, potentially euro..
  We'll see what happens with that.
    ?OL is down.. temp/perm.. who knows.. ;/
    C?T is down... not sure wtf that is..
    ?OG is down for .. ... well.. god only knows why its down this 
  week... ;p
    P?L is down for good... but.. hell.. i've never heard of that
  site before, so.. blah..
    
    ?E? is back up, and already kicking ass... i would put it at
  top 5, i think.. still no sign of the "thread-lightly" daemon,
  but... its apparently "coming"..

    So... i guess that sort of alters our picture of the world's
  topsites... i can basically only think of a couple of good US
  sites... so.. don't even bother with a "top 10".. or even a 
  "top 5"..
    The ones that you wanna worry about are T?, S?C, and ... ..
  ermm.... thats kinda all i can think of right now.. 
    I am assured that some phat ones are coming up soon to pick
  up the slack tho, including the return of a legend or rwo.. ;)
    More on that next issue.. 

    Over onto the euro side of the pond, ?OG became CORP, dropping
  LND.. 
    ?H became a CORP site, now that RiSE is officially dead..
    
    I guess thats about it.. feel free to take wild guesses about
  what the "?"'s are supposed to be... 
    My top 5 for this week have gotta be ?S, ST?, ?T, ?E?, and ?H..
  
    Siteops!! send your weektops to: nwr@netmonkey.org, or give them to
  _tech_... Thanks to all those that support us every week... ;)


=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. 
	Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... 
heh... fuck off and die..

-----------[ Lester's Biased Courier Section ]-----------



Note: Lester is taking a week/month/year off for a while, so we are gonna 
have one or two "guest authors" every week from now on to fill in on the
courier report. Guest's are allowed to do the report in any style/format
that they want, with whatever ratings and graphics system that they deem
applicable.
Guests wishing to apply for the position should be an active trader in
one of the scene's top groups.. (ie: someone who knows wtf they are 
talking about... .. heh.. although, that never stopped lester from 
writing!!)  <g>

THE BLITZ REPORT FOR THE WEEK OF 06/29/99 - 07/06/99
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Well, it had to happen sooner or later. Last week the game scene saw a lot of 
the big players go down in one of the worst series of busts in the scene's 
history. The leaders of the three USA based groups were taken out of comission, 
and rumours of more on the way are rampant. Apparently there is a rat in the 
chicken coop. All this is rumour and hearsay, but from what I understand, a 
promient PDM member turned in everyone in exchange for lighter treatment. Nice. 
Hopefully he'll get his due, I believe in Karma. 

 Life goes on, however... and even though each group seems to have lost some 
of their best suppliers, the games still get released. In a way the scene is 
a lot cleaner now. Most of those who went down sought to make profit from the 
scene. Although there are still people who sell their cracker and supplier's 
work, there are a few less of them. 
 This week we see some very good games released. Kingpin and Hidden and 
Dangerous were both long-awaited games, and both got ripped.

 Class didn't land either Kingpin OR H&D, but they still managed to edge out 
PDM for the week's top group. This is mostly due to their fix of the PDM game 
Kingpin. I was a little sceptical about this one, but after playing multiplayer, 
I did see the problem. It's a legit problem, but understandable. Had PDM 
bothered to fix it instead of ignoring it I probably wouldn't have penalized 
them, but on a major game such as this the rip has to be good. People are 
going to be playing this one for a while, and they deserve a good rip. CLS 
didn't really land any spectacular titles, bringing only Skydive and Mike 
Stewart. Both are fairly minor titles, and scored as such. Trophy Bass 3D 
had the 3D ripped. Now this is all good on major titles, but you know. I 
don't want to see what is in effect a 200mb rip of a Bass fishing game. No 
thanks guys, use your heads please. CLS did a lot of stuff that didn't get 
points. The trainers were for minor games, and movie addons never get points. 
They did put out the music for skydive, which does actually make the game a 
lot more enjoyable. Other than that, they managed but one patch and the kingpin 
fix. That rounds out the week. Solid releasing from Class.

 Shades of Thrust, Twist and Turn. DVN wins a UK store title in Castrol 
Honda Superbikes. This is a nice little motorcycle racing game, and the 
best game to come out of DVN in recent memory. To that, they add a pair 
of their normal games in Dragon's Challenge and Sportsman's Challenge. 
Neither is very good, but they aren't horrible. Add to those releases a 
patch and DVN has bragging rights for a while. Solar declined to be 
interviewed for NWR this week, perhaps remembering the curse that followed 
TPC after the Grind interview. TPC never did another game... perhaps Solar 
knows something we don't.

 Wow. Paradigm outdid themselves, almost matching OGN's big week from last 
month. PDM's quality control has really sucked ass lately though. BOTH 
major titles needed fixes. The Hidden and Dangerous is completely unplayable 
(at least on a Voodoo 3) without this addon, and definately deserves the 
deduction. The Kingpin fix is less severe, and as I stated above would 
not have gone against this group, except for the fact that they seemed 
to ignore the need. Well the fix is needed, and the point gift they 
sacrifice as a result tarnishes their great release. There's no excuse 
for ignoring a fix that is obviously needed, albiet minor. As usual, 
PDM owned patches again. The GTA patch was packed as an addon, but it's 
a patch and scored as such.

 ][ce himself declared this a bad game, and I have to agree. It's from 
Psygnosis, however so you have to at least respect it's developer. The 
OGN patch team isn't doing much at all, which cost them in the standings 
last month (Read PPGR for the most accurate monthly summary).

 This week, I've gone to my own group for the NWR game interview, talking 
to Toast from Razor 1911. One of the oldest members of the scene's oldest 
group, he gives insight on the recent busts and a reply to Sundancer's PPGR 
tirade.

<NWR> Hello Toast, and thank you for agreeing to do the NWR game report 
interview this week. Let's start off by getting your full nick and your 
past and current affils.

<Toast> Full Nick: Toast. AKA: Burnt Bread (sometimes).  
affils: 9000c/narc/exile/tra/mennen/scum/razor/risc/prophecy/cartel/gnx/dod/
amnesia/trg/apoc/dimension/ (chronological order too) , and umm current: 
Razor 1911, Amnesia, Trg.

<NWR> This hasn't been the best month por so for the game scene. First we 
see the French busts, and now comes word of problems hitting closer to home. 
Do you see this as a new action against our hobby, or was it just "time" to 
shake us up again?

<Toast> Well honestly i think it's a bit of both.  It's been over 2 years 
since the last large US-based bust (the ones that hit the hardest) and it 
has been anticipated for  quite a while.  But it IS also an action against 
our hobby.  The internet is STILL bringing large numbers of people to the 
warez scene, and with the advent of easily reachable warez news pages, 
message boards, other means to get information, companies are also more 
aware of what we do and how we do it. This is what  has helped put more 
money into the anti-piracy efforts and led to what we have seen here. 
(which is  unprecendented, BTW, most busts have been boards or sites, 
now: it seems tactics have changed)

<NWR> I think it's safe to say that all games will be ripped and cracked, 
regardless of these busts. What then do you feel is the government's 
motivation for going after pirates?

<Toast> Well as you can see, it's not just the government, it's also the 
companies themselves who are feeding money into anti-piracy (this should 
be obvious). They are after the people responsable for getting it out, 
and those are the major game groups and/or other release groups (read 
this util groups: you are not exempt, don't count yourself as perfectly 
safe). But really, part of busts is propoganda. Companies want their 
shareholders to know they are against piracy and for profits. Governments 
and politicians want the public to know that cybercrime is also being 
fought with, and  thus they can pick on an easy snag, the software pirate. 
Further, with joe-ibuygames reading news pages and seeing latest news on 
a bust, he willl incur on his brain subcouncious links where piracy=bad 
and thus when he goes to search yahoo for warez, he'll decide "i can't do 
this, it'll get busted!" (subnote: i tnink everyone has thought at some 
point or another, that copying a game or warezing one game can get you 
in jail)

<NWR> How do you see the forced departure of so many long-time standouts 
affecting the big picture? DVN pulled down second place on the week charts 
this week, could that be related?

<Toast> Well it is real sad. Many of those affected are legends to even 
ME, and it will, no doubt, change the face of our scene. As for divine, 
i suggest you let the big picture  show itself instead of jumping to a 
conclusion so quick. It's too early to tell.

<NWR> A lot of people don't seem to give you much credit when it comes 
to your supplying skills, but they are forgetting titles such as starcraft. 
What other big games have you landed for Razor in your many years with 
your group?

<Toast> Well perhaps they are correct? I've only supplied: Hexen (c) 
Raven/ID (disk version), Starcraft (c) Blizzard, and Co Supplierd with 
Big Boss on Star Wars: Episode One, and Star Wars EP1: Pod Racer.   

<Toast> remember disk based games? heh. 7 floppies.

<NWR> Very fondly =)

<Toast> sigh. =)

<NWR> Razor has always been competitive on the early releases, but it seems 
that your store team lacks the same polish as those of PDM and CLS. Is Razor 
going to be able to compete on the store titles again any time soon?

<Toast> Of course.

<NWR> All three of the old groups now seem to have voids at the top, with 
the possible exception of CLS, who have just recently named P????? overlord. 
Is Razor going to have a new leader, or will the gruop be run by commitee?

<Toast> As beowulf said in PPGR,  Razor 1911 is a brotherhood. It's more 
than just a leader and it's peons. Our fearless 'leader' did retire a while 
ago if you remember correctly, so has  there ever been a void at the top? 
who knows.

<NWR> Well that about wraps it up. I'd like to thank you Toast for doing 
this interview, and wish you the best in the future. Any final words or greets 
for our readers?

<Toast> A bit of a response to sun dancer in PPGR...

<Toast> Of course i can't run a group, i'm not the leader of a group.  I'm 
just a dude who's had over *4* CONSECUTIVE years in RAZOR 1911, and with 
these experiences i bring a unique amount and variance of skills and knowledge 
to the Brotherhood.  Yes, i've seen a lot of things happen in  Razor, perhaps 
you missed the RazorCD split off in '96? What about the split in early '95? i 
WAS there, just  a very shy newbie courier.  Regardless, i dont' jump from ship 
to ship, as you won't gain much from doing that. I'm part of the Brotherhood, 
and again over 4+ years of which speaks for itself. Those who have been here 
most of those years surely appreciate what i've done  As well as i appreciate 
what they, and every other single member (no matter how small) has done, even 
those who aren't in Razor 1911 anymore.  

<Toast> In Summary: I sure can't run a group, but  in the time i've been in 
Razor 1911: You quit Razor, dissapeared for a year or two, Came back to Razor, 
Left for Paradigm, Left PDM for Class, and Retired shortly after.  Next time 
your in a group for a few years, you may appreciate or undrestand what people 
like myself do. (i'm not alone BTW) =)~

<Toast> Greets: To all those who were recently hit, you know who you are. 
We are here for you guys, and wish you the best of luck in whatever your 
future has in store for you.. Keep in touch with us, and rest assured, we 
will carry on, we always do.

 Bud's Biased Utils Report #26
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Our first full post-SGE week. Most of SGE has gone in two directions, with
 many to Harvest, and others to PWA. Rumors have been abundant as always,
 and there's still plenty of them regarding who will go where... but
 who cares, lets check out the releases!
  
 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 06/22/99 to 06/28/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.


 Groups: (In no particular order)
 
 ‹ ﬂﬂ€€‹ ‹        ‹      ‹

 So could this be the summer that PWA comes back with an attitude? With
 several top SGE members moving to the old favorites, the results are already
 showing, with PWA having a ton of activity. Not everything is great,
 and a couple of betas (good ones however) as usual make an appearence...
 PWA has stated that it will not focus on any one niche in particular,
 a wise move given the influx of talent and potential... expect increased
 output in the next few weeks.

 Could this perhaps be the first week LND actually deserves its self-titled
 utils scene dominance? They send out some excellent CAD/CAM apps which,
 in comparison to other apps this week, remain at the top. Specifically,
 PTC Pro Engineer 2000i, which boasts an improved interface, Working Model 5,
 and Soldview 3.21 give LND a strong week. However, Scum releasing SolidView
 3.3 soon after took some of the shine off. Expect to FINALLY see them recieve
 some competition, from PWA/SCUM, in the near future. I didn't deduct for the
 DIZ fix... too minor a problem.

 DOD is making a bit of a comeback, and picks up TK4 from... well
 a lot of groups of late. Should he stay put, he's a nice pickup.
 Still, it's mostly Symantec apps and antiviral tools, although they
 prove they can do something more with Hard Info Pro and Emulive Producer,
 plus a few more. Expect this to continue next week.

 Another fairly active week from RBS, although a few too many minor titles
 for my taste. A build of Web Trends (which is released what, every week it seems?)
 and a build of MyEureka Report Designer (same deal). MediaHouse Enterprise
 Monitor is a nice little tool though. Overall, not too bad, but could have
 been better.

 Some action out of Versus finally... although Post-It Software Notes

 put an actual yellow fucking sticky note on my monitor...
 Mini Phone Book wasn't really worth it either, very minor...
 Macromedia users check out the work on Flash they've provided. The SWF
 Unprotect tool allows users to capture protected SWF files from the
 web and load them into Flash... great job keeping the end users in

 Solid View, others say it runs fine... so we'll have to wait and see, but for
 now full points.

 becoming to much of a dumping ground for what other groups pass over.

 Quote(s) of the Week: 

 "Poultry producer Cruddy Intl. has today announced a $1 Million drop in first
  quarter profits" <--- perhaps it has something to do with naming their
  chicken company "Cruddy"!

 Since this is a double issue (of sorts, report #27 will follow this one
 immediately if you're reading this in NWR... and where else would you be!),
 I'll leave most of my thoughts till later. For this week I gave it to LND
 and PWA... LND were dominate in the usual areas, and PWA well... PWA has
 benifited more than any other group from the disbanding of SGE, several
 key members have gone there, and it shows, with a wide variety of quality
 titles. Expect them to show some real releasing power in the weeks to
 come. 

 Next week, I'll start reviewing Harvest, home to some other ex-SGE members.
 Some interesting art apps could head our way from them, and they should
 be decent competition for PWA.

 More and more it seems that the more mature groups still hold the power,
 while newer challengers aren't making the cut... how many decent utils
 groups are less than 3 years old? Just blabbing here... but with
 the resurgance of PWA and possibly DOD, you have to wonder <g>.

                                                                    - Bud

 Bud's Biased Utils Report #27
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Bla bla bla bla yak yak yak yak... I'm lazy, just skip this paragraph.
  
 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 06/29/99 to 07/05/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.

 For a second week PWA shows the benefits of a new member influx, and
 shows the scene how good they can be. Aside from the usual MS domination,
 they put out a pair of apps from Metacreations, Poser 4 final and Ray
 Dream Studio 5.5, which several other groups had their hopes set on,
 and are excellent titles for the art community. Also Domino Workflow
 2 from Lotus, and SPSS Answertree. PWA now shows diversity that SGE
 lacked, and I'll stop with the mindless comparisons between the two
 groups now. :)

 Corp gets MS Small Business Server, and fucks up Extensis Portfolio - 
 the earleir PWA version is the same as Corp's minus some PDF's
 apparently. Not sure if this is the fault of Corp or Extensis,
 Extensis has a habit of playing around with their install files... 
 finals usually show up a few days on the Extensis FTP site before
 being announced, and occasionally get repackaged before being
 publically distributed... well most of you are reading that
 as "blah blah blah" I'm sure <g> A few other decent titles.
 Corp's improved from last week but is still lacking. The loss
 of Twizted has hurt them.

 RISE:

 Releases:

 Encryption.Software.Top.Secret.Messenger.for.ICQ-RiSE

 Well, the end is near for Rise from the look of things. Toth, Flounder
 and a few others have moved over to PWA... the RiSE cracking team is
 basically non-existant... to put it in perspective, even two months
 back you likely wouldn't have seen an addon for ICQ released by Rise.
 Business Cards N' Cerificates is a cheap store title, but at least 
 it's something... Rise was a good group at its peak, and I think
 maybe the remaining Rise members should make some serious decisions
 as to the future of the group.

 This week saw a pair of cd rips from Shock, both budget, in Expert
 Antivirus Guard, a decent antiviral package, but nothing compared
 to Norton AV, and Sierra Web Studio, a quickie web site development
 package geared more towards novice HTML users. Informix SDK is only
 going to appeal to Informix Dynamic Server users, leaving a couple 
 of Adobe plugins. PDF Embedder allows the user to embed any file
 in a PDF document, and Silvertone is a decent pre-press tool.

 PINNACLE:

 Releases: 

 StarTeam.v4.1-PNC
 Trix.Raster.Server.v3.09-PNC
 Trix.Drawing.Center.v3.07-PNC
 TracTrix.2000.v3.0.1-PNC
 OfficeExpress.2000-PNC

 A few nice apps... best is probably StarTeam 4.1 from StarBase,
 a team orientated SCM app. However, PNC would have been better off
 releasing the components (Client, Server, 3RD Party addons, StarDisk)
 seperately, as they are provided by StarBase, to give the end users
 a few more choices...

 get into the CAD/CAM game with TrueCAD and TwinCAD.

 Lack of major titles are versions are about all that's hurting RBS these
 days... would love to see them really put their talent to work. Nice to
 see a little DOS app, remember this is the PC scene, not the Windows Scene,
 and some of the best hardware related apps (and recovery tools for that
 matter) are DOS based.

 A new edition of VRS's SWF unprotect for Flash... haven't checked out
 what's new in it, it was released shortly after the initial release.
 AtGuard 3.2, Transit HTML Editor 4.0, and Xml Pro 2 are all worthwhile
 releases. I haven't used Trumpet Winsock in years... so I have no
 clue if it's gotten any better =).

 MARC.K7.32-SCuM
 Solid.View.IGES.v3.3-SCuM
 Solid.View.v3.3.RP.Master-SCuM

 Well, several groups talked about it, but Scum did it. Marc K -
 a top FEA app. Protected by Flexlm, as most high end CAD/CAM
 apps are these days, the Scum-provided license missed a few features,
 thus grab the LND fix. The point I gave to LND is removed from
 Scum, but still, congrats to them... while Grad may wish to go
 on about LND's dominance, there will without a doubt be more
 challenges in the coming while... good to see Scum providing one
 here. They also get some more from the Solid View line, with IGES
 being another title from the LND wish list appearing in various
 LND NFO's. Also honerable mention to Intel Landesk Client Manager.

 This week RDM puts forth Voyetra's Digital Orchestrator Pro, a fairly
 popular MIDI sequencer, and although a minor update, still a pretty
 sweet one. Again, although I promised an in-depth review of some
 RDM audio tools as a special feature, I'll wait for a week with some
 more variety, and if that doesn't happen soon, I'll just combine a
 few weeks into a special segment.

 One of two groups new to the report this week. Pros is run by Machv and
 Twizted, you remember Mutiny from last week, well after some contreversy
 regarding the monikor they decided to switch names.

 Pros looks to have a fair backing of store titles, supported by a variety
 of web apps. Which means a decent supply team, backed by the ever improving
 PHXiSO. They lack on the cracking side, however, and will likely be stumped
 by tougher protection schemes.

 This week we see some good business/legal apps from AIFR in Smart Attorney
 and Smart Business Plan Pro, as well as one of the titles from Micrografx's
 recent iGrafx series, iGrafx Developer. Good overall, next few weeks should
 set the tone for them.

 HARVEST:

 PUFFINDESIGNS.COMMOTION.V2.1.NT-HARVEST
 SPEEDRENDER.V2.02-HARVEST
 ALIAS.WAVEFRONT.MAYA.V2.0.FINAL.NT-HARVEST

 That "other" new group... yeah you know, from parts of SGE...
 Well that's how many people will look at them for some time, and
 comparisons will be made, especially with a strong graphics/design
 background. Don't expect to hear much about this group "politically"
 in the scene.

 Some good apps here as expected... and their debut was Boris FX 4,
 which isn't listed since it's actually from next week, but I thought
 I'd point it out... definately a good title to debut with.

 No DIZ ascii from them... so none here... if they get one I'll paste it.

 PWA easily takes the week, but honorable mention to Scum, who would have tied
 save for the incomplete license on Marc K, and to DOD as well, who look REALLY
 active for the first time in... (days/months/years <--- please make your selection 
 <g>).

 Well my eyes are going fuzzy again... so it's time to get outta here!

 Koka's Biased(duh!) Cracking Report #1


        Here we go, I am gonna try to make the scene people pay a bit more 
more attention into the cracking scene, so here comes my report. I will be
rating each group and it's releases, with a ranking of them all on the end
of the report, based on my rating and the points I gave,.  I am only going
to report  the top  10 cracking  groups of  the week,  but if you  (REALLY
REALLY)  want your group  to be reviewed,  bug me on irc and I  will think
about it :P
        If you have any suggestions, msg me on irc. Thanks :)
        Kudos to Sketch/THD for helping me out with my english. Thanx bro!


Week is based from 27/07 to 03/07.

  They seems to have slowed down.. 44 releases last week and 22 releases
  this week, with 3 being nukes, so they still had 08 (with keygens)
  fine releases. If you want to download something from BLZ, get
  WinDac and NetContact, both are very good programs. On the bad side, Two
  X-Squeeze's in one week. Its kinda gay, no? :)

  12 releases total, 0 nukes. Much slower than last week, but still ok,
  keeping the releasing alive for this week. Anyway, Bullet Proof FTP 1.13
  is the best thing here. I heard a rumour they slowed down because of the .fr busts,
  which made some members scared about it, so that may be the reason why
  they didn't do much.

  13 releases, 0 nukes. WebSpeed Optimizer is a good release. Zmud is also
  pretty cool, lots of people requested it, and it had a lot of server
  checks to be cracked. WebSpeed Optimizer is also a quality release. ZLA
  joined recently as another Crystal HQ. Overall, not good, just keeping
  alive. They can do better than that.

  A Repack, A keygen and a normal release. 3 Releases this week. DSi is
  lacking crackers lately, and recently Ivan and Sting retired, which leads
  to a total lack of motivation in the group. To make it worse, one of their
  crackers was french and disappeared because of the .fr bust. Well, we
  hope DSI gets it all fixed and do a better next week :]

  software here in my opinion.

  After being bugged by senator (heh), here is a Harlem review. :]
  First of all i suggest taking off these dirs "CRACKED,REGGED
  SUCKED". Anyway, they have been doing well since SOD merged into them.
  Easy CD Da is the best proggie here. Loop Record and DragFTP are good
  releases as well. Sync it With Atom is a dupe from CST :(
  Good week, but we hope they'll do better next week :)

  If you are from Europe, grab Euro Converter.:P Find It Now is also a
  good program. Nice week for PGC, almost as good as MFD.

   This week goes to TNO and MFD.  Congrats to both MFD and TNO.
   TNO is the keygenner group of the moment no doubt and MFD is doing
   their cracks well, but many releases *cough*QUANTITY*cough*.
   The group slowed a bit this week but still pretty well, enough for
   being #1. PGC and ECLIPSE were close to TNO, though the mainly-keygens
   philosophy makes TNO the #2.. DARKSTAR seems to be dead, we see no signal
   of life from them. :[

   NEW this week is HARLEM
   NEXT week: dF and ORiON.

=---------[ Who Are Those Sexy Guys? ]----------=


Well, seeing as how this issue has a sort of general security theme, we here
at nwr thought we'd fly in the face of convention, and do a sort of "fuck the
man!" type of theme, to show that the freedom of the press must live on.

Therefore, we have decided to include pictures of ourselves for this issue.
FREEDOM OF SPEECH MAN!!!!

There is nothing illegal about publishing an emag.. And we firmly believe that.
Here is a breakdown of the included pics....


nwrstaff1.jpg: The illustrious man behind the curtain, this dashing fellow
               is the leader of Eviliso, and a powerfull man in the VCD empire.
               His weekly column saves thousands of young lamers from needlessly
               downloading shitty movies... he is Ryche!

nwrstaff2.jpg: this older gentleman has been providing bot and protection 
               services to nwr almost since the start. He is the botmaster
               of Netmonkey and Impotent, and can often be found kicking 
               people from the #nwr channel with the slogan of "It will be
               out when its fucking out!".. 
               It is of course "NotZeus"!

nwrstaff3.jpg: the tough writer of nwr's non-nonsense games report, this oldschool
               member of razor1911 has been known to kick a few asses when
               the need arises. He is the crazy Blitzkrieg!

nwrstaff4.jpg: longtime member of the utils scene, he is also one of the oldest
               people still active in SHOCK. His games report really takes a lot
               out of him each week, so its no wonder he looks a little worn out.
               We thank him for all his hard work each week, as we salute: Bud!
               (ladies: did you know that he's only 27?)

nwrstaff5.jpg: editor and head fatass, he writes the stuff about the sites, and
               throws it all together to make it look real pretty.. If nwr is
               late, chances are its his fault.. But with a face as cute as that,
               i'm sure that you will forgive: ndetroit!

nwrstaff6.jpg: the evil genius behind all of nwr, head of a ton of former groups,
               and a scene resume way too long to list. He is currently taking it
               easy enjoying time with his new girl.. (she's a lucky one!).. The
               man that needs no introduction can be none other than... Lester!

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 



Lester saw a bunch of movies apparently, this week, but did not feel
like writing a review about any of them, so i will write "Lester-style"
reviews about some of the flicks that i went to see... ;p



Wild Wild West - ** of out 4
Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Salma Hayek

Holy fucking jesus CHRIST in a handbasket... Salma Hayek is HOT HOT HOT HOT.
CRAP!! ... .... A lot of people have really been ragging on this movie,
calling it the worst movie they have seen since Godzilla... I didn't think
it was that bad, and payed the tuesday admission price to check it out.
Basically the whole deal takes place in post-emancipation America, with
Will Smith playing the tough-ass cowboy who likes to shoot things, and Kevin
Kline playing his wacky (wacky!) sidekick who likes to.. .. .. invent things,
and dress up as a woman.. .. Yeah, ok, maybe it was the worst movie since
Godzilla, but Salma Hayek's ass more than makes up for the lack of such
insignificant things as "plot", and "characterization".. This movie gets
two **'s, on the strength of Ms. Hayek's show-saving performance.

South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (1999), R
            CAP Score: 29
     CAP Influence Density: 10.65
           Thomas A. Carder
            CAP President 

SUMMARY / COMMENTARY:

*South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut* (R) -- WARNING! This analysis is blunt. *South Park* 
is another movie straight from the smoking pits of Hell.

*South Park* is an *incredibly dangerous* movie for those who do not understand or are 
developing an understanding of the Gospel .......INCREDIBLY dangerous.

Satan is portrayed as the homosexual lover of Saddam Hussein and is portrayed as a 
sensitive, loving and caring being. Hussein waves his disembodied male member around. 
And it was not a cardboard drawing like most other images of the movie -- it was of 
photographic resolution. The most foul of the foul words was clearly spoken *by the 
children* at least 131 times and many other times in a muffled or garbled way. The 
three/four letter word vocabulary was used at least 119 times. God's name in vain was 
used 11 times without the four letter expletive and 6 times with it. And many times the
child characters were saying things like "What's the big deal" (about the foul language). 
"Suck my --", "Let's ([homo]sexual intercourse)", and repeated questions about a female 
private organ were but a very few of the vulgar expressions used by the kids.

Angels were portrayed as females - nude, very nude. God was called many vulgar and 
hateful names. Satan was glorified. Jesus was equated with sexual anatomy. A child 
was graphically incinerated by igniting his anal wind, then another kid tried to beat 
out the flames with a stick and was concerned about the stick catching fire. Body 
parts dripping with blood were ripped from a child by a surgeon who expressed shallow 
concern. The dead child was then seen with an exploded chest. The dead child, after 
being rejected from Heaven (by nude female angels) and cast into Hell, was then presented 
as a ghost trying to influence the other kids. An all-male chorus line wore pink bikini 
briefs. Homosexual acts were described. Decomposing burned bodies were cast as live 
occupants of Hell. "Big brother" electronic shock control of a child was used to prevent 
his use of foul language (each time he cussed he was shocked -- he used this shock later 
to defeat Hussein by shouting every known and several unknown foul words). A man 
committed suicide by jumping out of a window. And throughout the movie was script to 
promote licentious belittlement of wholesome life and entertainment: rationale to 
lessen even further the threshold of acceptance.

These are but a very few of the examples of ignominy in this celluloid developed in the 
fiery pits of Hell. And the kids in the audience loved it, almost as much as the adults 
with them. May God have mercy on us.

That is all I will say about the content this extraordinarily vulgar, vile, and repugnant 
movie. Other examples are just too vulgar and vile to even try to describe without being 
as vulgar and vile. Please note that the final score of 29 is not the lowest of scores 
earned by the movies we have analyzed, but this movie has earned the most severe CAP 
Influence Density (ID) of almost 200 movies: a CAP ID of 10.65! *Natural Born Killers* (R) 
earned a CAP Influence Density of 7.46! Most R-rated movies earn CAP IDs between 1.00 
and 3.00. A child cannot escape being influenced by this useless.......

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.

No ryche this week!!!

Go home and cry about it!

-----------[Protect Yourself]-----------


We all know that there are going to be more busts, just around the corner.
Each of us has lived with the fact, for as long as we've been in this scene
that eventually there was a good chance we were going to be busted.. either
by the cops/fbi in a federal case, or by our network admins, our employer, 
you name it...

The interesting thing about the most recent series of criminal proceedings
is that for the first time, someone other than siteops were caught.. 
This time, it was crackers, suppliers, group leaders, and (shocking!)
couriers, as well. Let me drill this into you: YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING ILLEGAL
IF YOU ARE "just a" COURIER.
I hope that most of you are aware of the sad case of kevin mitnick..
(www.freekevin.com). Yes, he did do some illegal shit. He stole some source to
some cell codes. He stole some source to some Sun OS's (which they GIVE away
to students on their webpage for a small $100 fee..), and he did a small
bit of hacking.. 

Boys and gals.. what he did is NOTHING compared to what your average scene
person does in a WEEK.. ... $100 worth of source code??? HAHAHAHA.. thats
practically fucking WEBWARE... how many times has RiSE released a big fat
$20,000 app?.. heh... now.. consider.. thats $20,000 x a thousand shitty
sites. If you had a hand in supplying/ripping/cracking/packing/preing/couriering
that util, then you are partially liable.

The US govt has left this kevin mitnick kid in jail for 4 YEARS without a trial.
Hate to break it to ya, but thats how the system works.. You think you got rights???
You don't got shit.. i hate to get all political on ya'll here, but.. If the 
government wants to take you down, sorry.. you're gone.. its just that simple.

So where does that leave us?... fucked, thats where.. thats why we ALL have to
take some steps to protect ourselves.


When your big day finally comes.. what should you do to maximize your chance
of getting off without incident, and minimize your chance of a rooming with
Bubba for the next 20 years?...... .... 


Here we go.


1.) Logging
    A large majority of the most "leet" people that i have talked with over the years
    have always told me "if you do one thing, make sure you LOG EVERYTHING.. you never
    know when its gonna come in handy".. Good advice, however, in this day and age,
    its simply no longer practical. Sorry kids, you're just gonna have to rely on your
    memory from here on in. True, logs cannot be used as evidence in a court case,
    but the FBI/RCMP/whatever WILL make good use of your logs, that is a virtual
    guarantee. Don't give a shit about whether or not someone else gets busted using
    your logs? Fine. Expect them to be more than happy to further incriminate you.
    
    The bottom line: don't log. ever. If you have 3 gigs worth of logs that simply
    cannot bear to lose, then back them up somewhere, and shove them in a safe/secure
    hiding place. A safety deposite box, a (non-scene) friend's house, etc. Don't
    leave 3 gigs of potential evidence simply sitting on your HD.

2.) Personal Info
    Now i *know* that sometimes its unavoidable, and in order to get things done, we
    have to call each other, or mail each other shit. Thats how it works, here in the 
    big leagues, but remember: each person you trust with your personal shit increases
    your chances of getting caught by 1000% percent. Now, no one out there goes out
    randomly giving out his phone # in the channel, but people still are not careful
    enough with personal info.
    People think that just because XxxxxxxX has been in the scene for 2 years as a 
    game supplier, then he MUST be trustworthy, cause no FED would spend 2 WHOLE
    YEARS in an undercover sting... .... uhhhh.. yeah... i saw Donny Brasco too,
    fellas..  which bring me to the next point:

3.) Trust
    We all wanna get what we need to do accomplished, and in order to get shit
    done, we gotta trust one another, and in order to trust one another, certain
    small bits of info/time/resources/etc need to be shared.. If you know what
    a "sting" is, then you know how much bullshit it is to say that "the feds can't
    supply games", or "the feds can't trade, that would be illegal!"..
    Well, let me put it to you this way: if *I* was the CEO of EA, and i knew that
    i was gonna lose half my profits (a lie!) on NBA LIVE 2000 to some damn
    pirates, then i sure as hell would bite the bullet, and supply an advance copy
    to Joe Fed, to aid his investigation. 
    I mean, by now they KNOW that the shit is gonna get released eventually anyway,
    so why not help themselves out a bit, and give up the goods to the boys in blue?
    Does this mean that every game supplier is a fed, and every courier is a nark?
    Of course not. But remember, you can never fully trust anyone.. ANYONE.

4.) Bounces
    More and more people are getting ADSL or cable modem connections, and the nice 
    thing about these wonderful services are the static IP addresses that they afford you.
    Now instead of logging into a site, mget'ing shit to you shell, logging into your
    shell, and downloading it to your home, you can now just FTP right to the site, and
    grab your ISO, or whatever.. Saves a hell of a lot of time and effort.
    But its bullshit.
    Consider your IP address as being as important as your home phone # and house address.
    The wonderful thing about static IP addresses on the @home/adsl network is that
    there is one central office located somewhere that knows who the subscriber is
    that owns xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx IP address, and where he lives. As an additional bonus,
    if you are an @home network subscriber, you will be have the wonderful "feature"
    of having everything you download cached..
    IE: if you are downloading Backstreet.Boys.mp3, they will know, cause they are caching
    it!!! ... and your IP will be flagged as downloading "illegal" mp3's... Hooray!!!
    Lucky you!
    Can anyone see how important having a bounce suddenly becomes?
    Lets say JoELeEt has had a dialup connection his whole life, and so has had the
    relative freedom of security that a national ISP provides him. Suddenly he comes
    online, and joins all his regular channels, and appears as:
    joe@pr666135-a.rct1.on.wave.home.com
    Well.. Now i know that JoELeEt lives in ontario, canada, and he is a happy
    subscriber to the @home system. Good for you, joe!
    But unfortunately, since i am a federal agent, i am going to be paying a visit to
    joe and his family, and i'm going to take joe away for a long time... ;/
    Bad for you, joe!

    People, i can't stress how important is is that you GET A BOUNCE. it doesn't have to
    be an eleet riches style spoof, (mray@i.own.you), it just has to be something that
    is NOT your home IP.
    DON'T get your home IP added on sites.. DO NOT LEECH from now... how many of you
    100% know who has adduser access on EVERY SINGLE site that you are on? all it takes
    is "site user ndetroit", and anyone with staff access on all my sites will get to
    see the IP of my shells and my home connection.
    What if just 1 of those people was a fed, who was trying to bust ndetroit?
    Heh... well... i guess today was his lucky day, wasn't it?

5.) Scene Info
    This one is a bit contraversial right now, and i don't think that i need to spell
    it out for you, but i will list a few things that we all need to think about.
    Scene pages: messageboards, group moves, sites up and down, who the siteops are,
                 what the link is, how big it is, whether or not sites have mp3/iso/vcd/
                 porn/PSX.. all of those are flags that will spark the interest of whoever
                 it is that we don't want interested. YES, the scene has to have a way
                 of spreading information (that's what we're all about, isn't it??!!),
                 but NO, a lot of that shit just isn't necessary...
          NFO's: Yeah, i know.. Its an ego thing, and credit should be given where credit
                 is due. It also lets people get in contact with your group a LOT easier,
                 but..... .. but nothing, don't list names in nfo's. its that simple.
            NWR: We're just as bad as, if not worse than, everyone else out there... but
                 we're tryin' REAL damn hard to change. 

6.) Group Members
    Who are the 5 most recent people that have been added to your group? Did you know
    them all quite well before they became members? Did they have a good reputation
    in the scene as honest, contributing, legitamite people? I can't think of many
    groups these days that can honestly say "yes, we carefully screen each member
    before we allow them to join, and we simply will NOT take someone who we don't
    trust".. The groups that i *can* think of are DOD, PWA, and maybe RBS.. the games
    groups used to be good about it, but not so much any more.. I mean, if rzr1911
    allowed k****n and g***d into the group, they are in need of some. ... restructering.
    RiSC used to be a group that was *impossible* to get into without an invite back
    in the day.. and the only way that you were invited would be if you had proved 
    yourself over a long period of time.. We all know its not like that anymore, but
    if anyone cares about security, they should sure start to look into it...
    I don't wanna get preachy, but these days its pretty damn easy to join any group
    in the scene, so long as your ident looks something like: blah@fast.hut.fi...
    Who's gonna turn that person down for group membership? ... start thinking twice.

7.) Profit
    Hmmm... Well, i guess the busts this week pretty much said it all: if you are making
    a profit on the scene, you're gonna go down.
    That's not to say that if you *aren't* profitting then you are SAFE.. It just seems
    that the way things are for now, you are gonna be caught sooner if you are making
    money of the scene... That includes selling CD's, VCD's, access to sites, CC's,
    HW, and all the other shit out there........ last i checked, it wasn't illegal to
    sell t-shirts.. (but that may change.. <g>)
    Be careful.
    Now.. we all know that the scene can't be $$$ free.. the competition in the games
    scene is such that... ... well... anyways... Better to be lean and mean, and not
    pocketting the excess, right guys?

8.) Have a kill button
    Most good hackers that i know (and quite a few scene ppl) have a magic file called 
    "fun.exe" or something to that effect that will erase all the files that they
    specify within a matter of minutes. You should get a program like this, and you 
    should TEST it.. better to know that it works.
    The file should erase the data, and then overwrite it 7 times, or whatever the 
    lastest DOD standard is.. (no, the OTHER dod). 
    In addition, if your program is supposed to erase c:\sceneshit, then for fuck's sake,
    don't deviate from that directory, and start to store shit on your desktop.. ;p
    While we are on the subject, please dont' leave VCD's/ISO's/burned CD's lying
    around... store them somewhere non-obvious. It might be a bitch to have to go
    fish a CD out of the lampshape every time you need it, but.. in the long right you'll
    be better off.. ;p

9.) Shut the fuck up
    When you get busted, you are read your rights for a reason. Anything that you say
    can, and WILL be used against you in a court of law. It WILL... many times the
    police will arrest someone, and then IMPLY that if that person co-operates NOW,
    then things will be a lot easier on them in the long run. That's bullshit.
    You don't have to co-operate. In fact, you don't have to say a damn thing, except
    "I would like to call my lawyer now, please".
    For god sakes, don't start yelling "this is a conspiracy by THE MAN to take me down!!
    Well.. the scene will live on, man!!!! fuck you, i won't do what you tell me!!
    Razor1911 forevah!!!"... ... that would be stupid.
    Don't say a damn thing without your lawyer present. If the cops wanna cut a deal with
    you, (ie: "Give us the names of the leaders, suppliers, and crackers of the scene's
    big 3 groups, and we'll knock a couple years off your sentence, Mr. Lennon") then
    by all means cut a deal with them, AFTER your lawyer has shown up to preside
    over the whole business. 


I guess thats about it.. I hope i've given you all something to think about. Try your
best to take some of these steps if you feel that you have any glaring security holes
in your personal scene life... If you don't feel that way, then maybe you'd better
change your outlook on things, cause brothas and sistas.. they're coming for you.

I can promise you that.

-----------[The Scene News]-----------

All the news thats fit to print... 
and then some...

-Well... We still haven't officially decided on what news we are going to
 print, and what we are going to smokescreen.. sorry guys.. So i guess i'm
 gonna err on the side of caution, cause i don't want any of you cocksuckers
 fingering me as the brotha who ratted ya'll out..


-Some sites you can check out: 
 ppgr.webjump.com    : Prozac's page!!!! a lot of good gear... many of today's
                       popular reports, and an NWR archive that is practically
                       0 second.. ;)
 www.socalsys.com    : need shells, bounces, vhosts, web space?... these dudes
                       are scene-friendly, and got some decent deals... only
                       reason why i mention is cause the dude was fat enough
                       to hook up nd up with some action... *cough*... HAHAHAH!


-group moves: gee left amn for vice, moon left vice for aod, beck+vylent to rts,
 blitz left vice for iCC (wtf??), and thats about it for all.. ppl joined and
 left games groups (including rzr picking up someone whose reputation is... 
 questionable.. to say the least), but fuck it.. if you are in games group,
 then you know wtf i am talking about anyway.. ;p

-the old classic site Q? has come back.. i remember the good old days, when it
 was one of the top sites in the US, with that LEET-ASS mad daemon.. *sigh*.

-brain is trading again?... wtf?

-snakeeyes is trading again.... ...??.... WTF??

-RiSE is dead... no matter how you slice it.. what a bummer... first RiSE, then SiEGE..
 But on the upswing, DOD and PWA look like they are startin' to kick a little more ass 
 all of a suddent... phat!

-TPC it seems is dead and forgotten, which isn't really a big loss, but.. whatever.. at
 least they tried.. 

-bacid.. make that damn board of your private.. ;p

-So no one has managed to crack CuteFTP 3.x, as of writing this, tho a hell of a lot
 of people have sure tried.. The makers of CuteFTP were even kind enough to keep score
 for us: http://www.cuteftp.com/support/cracks2.html... thanks guys!
 Now, i personally downloaded the ESI version, and it sucked a bit of ass... thanks for
 fucking up, you dumb shits.. 
 But just to counter the Globalscape FUD, i didn't find any virii in it.. ;p
 I respect a company that is willing to go to all that work just to fuck with the 
 crax0rs out there... On the other hand.. i respect a cracker that can step up to bat
 and go deep against the Big Man.. 
 Two scoops of phat raisens to the first group that can release a *real* working CuteFTP
 3.x crack... go to it, boys!

-so i'm sure you all know who it was who squealed like a stuffed pig to the feds,
 in order to lighten his own sentence. In doing so, he's managed to screw the life
 of some of the biggest players in all of the major groups. People, you know that
 there are gonna be more busts, and soon, too. Do what you have to to protect yourself..
 Read that article we got about wtf to do... and then DO IT.


-Full issue of news next week.. nwr will be out on tuesdays from now on, i'm
 told.. so.. you'll have to wait until then..
