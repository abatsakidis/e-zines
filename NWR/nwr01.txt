                       NETMONKEY WEEKEND REPORT

        This is the first issue of The NetMonkey Weekend Report.  This EMag
(if you can call it that) was formed because of the demise of WCR,
and the fact that there are many complaints about CWS ("It's lame etc..),
I think CWS is great and should continue!.  So we're here, and probably
here to stay, unless we miraculously get a life :).

        In this issue we will feature the top 11 sites in the scene.
The way we got the top 11 sites was that we surveyed a buncha ppl and
we totaled up the points each individual site received.  If you're a
siteop and you don't agree with the rating you received, suck my dick,
it's the couriers who have voted.

In addition, if you think that we should have more than 11 sites message
rc , tdp or novo on irc.

The top 11 sites are as follows 

x3  MP -*- VDR -*-  STH -*-  MS -*-  FH  
x2  ET  -*- FS -*-  NOS -*- LS -*- FOS -*- LA

We Multiplied by 3 and 2 because the difference between them is less
than 1 and 2.

                                                                  -NWR Staff!

STATS BABY!
