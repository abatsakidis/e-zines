Well, we are a day late, a dollar short. But we have all our shit,
iso monthly report is in there, games from our fill in guy TPK, and
Elo fills in for Bud since bud was busy, he promises to be ontime next
week, but we've heard that before eh? :) In the zip file is also
another old report of elo's that I never received until now, so
it's in here, it's not in the text cuz I think it gets cluttered
and confusing with all this shit in text, someone has got to
code us a viewer. <G> Someone do something for us at least. <G>

 Weektops are calculated by top10 traders on each site, points go as
 follows: trader #1=10p x site multiplier.
 Grouptops are calculated by top5 groups on each site, points go as
 follows: group #1=5p x site multiplier.
 FS/MG had cls as #2/#4 group in gpwk so i pushed each group (cept #1/#3)
 up one spot to replace for cls as they are not a trading group.

		     Group Review For This Week
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 ANGELS ON DRUGS:
 The domination continues... aod traders didnt get as high positions 
 individually in the wkup chart as last week's, but we see great
 teamwork from the angels - with 5 traders on the wkup chart.
 cahor is finally showing off his real skills and places at #5 tied with
 sax with his usual trading, although he slipped off from last weeks 
 preformance hes still showing solid trading, we also saw cedric doing
 some nice trading+preing, and faith+darkwolf pulling some megs here and
 there to make it into the wkup chart, and also plouf scoring some nice
 positions but still not good enough to make it to top10 this week. 
 
 Ranking: 9.5/10
 Comments: didnt get 10/10 cuz they are not showing off thier full potential
 yet :)

 AMNESiA:
 nail nail nail nail nail and again nail... thats all we see from amn this
 week and its becoming a steady thing for the amn crew, although they have
 picked up virus and he did score on some sites - but he still needs to gain
 more experience, and except for that jfking popped up here and there, but 
 nothing serious, with the resources amn have id expect them to show more
 traders on the top10 chart.

 Ranking: 4/10
 Comments: where'd drunkkid go ?

 RISE iN SUPERIOR COURIERING:
 Well i did say last week lets see some more from the risc crew, and they 
 sure as hell are showing it - another good team effort from this group,
 even though they have only psedo with his usual ownage and worp with some
 nice trading in the top10, they had avalanche and flavor backing them up,
 and it seems this foursome will get risc some solid preformance in the coming
 weeks, if flavor and avalanche try harder i think risc can secure themselves the
 #2 position and even maybe try to go for #1.
 
 

 Ranking: 8/10
 Comments: teamwork... thats the key word here

 DEVOTiON:
 Nothing new this week... the usual tc preing+trading and jaydee preing, backed up
 by some serious jaydee preing and some of sj and garoto, no team effort but still 
 they dont have competition  at #4 position... is that what we'll see from dev until
 officedog/godbless/native come back ?
 
 Ranking: 4/10
 Comments: make garoto trade again
 
 ViCE:
 Leme just say WOW about citizen... pulling off a great #3 showing off his skills
 but noone was there to help citizen and get vice out of the #5 spot, and until
 someone wakes up i dont think well see vice getting out from #5 any time soon.

 Ranking: 3/10
 Comments: time to call nailz :)

 MOONSHiNE:
 Just after i congratulated msn for the successful invasion to europe they have
 a so so week, not doing some real damage like last week, showing they are new 
 to this and there is no stability there yet, but they should be able to compete
 with vice for #5.

 Ranking: 3/10
 Comments: lets see some stability

 FastLane:
 Still nothing serious from the FL crew, and unless Fl ppl start showing up in 
 some more sites and in higher positions than they have had this week i dont think
 FL would be a serious force in the euro scene.
 
 Ranking: 1/10
 Comments: ok so your here... now where are the megs ? :)

 Insanity:
 Cept for being in the top5 in thier whq and scoring at low positions in some mediocre
 sites theres nothing impressive going on in the INS camp.

 Ranking: 1/10
 Comments: show some presence!

-----------[ The Gaming Report ]-----------
==================================================================================

 OMG YET ANOTHER GAMES REPORT ISSUE #6
 -------------------------------------

 Note: This report is best viewed in DOS Editor, AcidDraw, some other
       good ASCII editor, or on the chest of a Playboy Bunny.

 Back again, with more consistancy than Hugh Hefner on viagra!
 With all the wit and intelligence of The Howard Stern Show!
 As recommended by... ME!

 It was a rough & tumble week in games. Lots of player moves. Franchises
 folded, new ones were born. OMG this is worse than Novocaine's courier
 sports center.
 

                                                        - The Preacher Kane

 The Points:
 -----------

 * Games will be scored on a scale of 0 to 5, points being awarded according
   to the quality of the title. And not just quality by name - after all,
   an anticipated "blockbuster" can suck as badly as the worst budget
   schlock.

 * A fix will result in a loss of .5 (one half) of a point. If the fix
   is released by a group other than that which released the game, they
   will earn the extra point.

 * Addons such as Movies and Music will earn between 1 and 2 points,
   depending on the title AND whether or not they actually ENHANCE the
   gaming experience. Addons released by groups other than the group
   who originally released the game will not be considered. Addons of
   essential features (IE Textures, 3DFX, stuff that should not have
   been ripped to begin with) will result in the loss of 1 point. Which
   means certain titles can earn points even if some people consider them
   "rapes" - I'm on a modem after all!

 * Retail addons will recieve a score of between 1 and 4 points if they
   are developed by the original developers of the game, or are officially
   licensed. Unofficial addons will not be considered. Standalone addon
   packs are always preferable to a standard addon release. If a group
   releases an addon which is later released as a standalone, only
   the standalone will recieve points.

 * Update patches and trainers will earn 1 point each provided they
   are fully working. A trainer released by a group after an existing
   trainer has already been made available in an earlier release will
   only be considered if it offers something NEW, otherwise it will be
   considered a DUPE.

 * Cheat codes will be worth .5 (one half) of a point. Since updates and
   trainers take more skill to produce, simple cheat codes cannot be
   assigned an equal value.

 * A DUPE of a game will result in the loss of 1 point, with the
   following exception: A game that was lost during a race between two
   groups will not result in the loss of any points (we do need some
   competition in the scene!).

 * Repackaging of a game will result in the loss of .5 (one half) of a point.

 * Non-English games will not be considered. Sorry, I only speak one
   language.

 * I retain the right to bend the rules any way I see fit!


 * DATES *

 This time around I'm including all the releases since my last report - 02/13/00 thru
 to 02/29/00. Or something like that.

 Go Razor, Go Razor!! Oh damn, this is Backlash. Who from this
 moment forth shall be referred to as Patchlash.

 The Good: 
 Quake is cool. Doom is GOD. 

 The Bad:
 Don't expect a repeat of this momentus effort anytime soon.
 ^^^ I said it last week and they doubled their effort, doing
 not one but *TWO* (yes, two!) patches. So maybe if I say it
 again we'll see three next week.

 The Ugly:
 Connie Chung didn't die this week. Neither did Richard Simmons.

 Comments:

 The biggest news this week is that CLS might have some real competition
 soon. We shall see. For now they did their usual healthy mix of decent
 games and patches, with no major problems for once.

 The Good:
 
 Invictus looks ok, I haven't played it though so don't hold me to
 it. Grand Prix World from Microprose doesn't look to special, but you
 can manage "every aspect" of an F1 team, according to the box hype.
 Honestly I just want to race.

 Believe it or not, I actually saw PBA Tour Bowling 2 get some GOOD
 reviews. I'm still only going to score it a 2 though.

 The Bad:
 Multiplayer maps were once apon a time considered essential to the
 enjoyment and playability of a game. Removing them would get one's
 enemies screaming rape. So I docked CLS a point, but I don't blame
 them for removing the maps. On this note, a lot of groups have been
 having talks on and off regarding the disk limit and ripping issues,
 yet as usual it's mostly egos and nothing gets done, despite some
 promise. If a change happens, lets just hope it's not an excuse
 for oversized games.

 The Ugly:
 I forgot to rag last week: MiniMe did a HORRIBLE dupe of OGN on Heartbreaks.
 Now the game blows, it lasted five minutes on my system. If you remember,
 I noted OGN could have made it a disk or two smaller with MP3'ing but
 they didn't bother. And I didn't care since it was seven disks. Well,
 MiniMe not only duped but somehow made it almost three times the size
 of the OGN release! Now why is this under the CLS section...

 Comments: 

 No games, but a fair amount of patches and trainers, and with certain
 group moves over the past week, it looks like DVN is pretty secure in
 third place.

 The Good: 
 Well, nothing stands out, but nothing wrong with any of the releases,
 which makes my job rather boring. The UT Bonuspack, for those who didn't
 know, includes new skins and other new goodies (including a WarCow!!),
 and was free to registered users. It's a legit release though since it
 need "modifacation" to make it work for rip users. And unlike a lot
 of UT update patches, this baby works, so if you're a UT fan grab it.

 The Bad: 
 Well, no games.

 The Ugly:

 Comments:

 Know that song by Powerman 5000, "When Worlds Collide"? Well,
 this is what happens when EGOS collide. That's right kids,
 Origin and Paradigm have merged! Twice the ego under one roof!

 Both of these groups have struggled recently, but it is a slow
 time of year. Still, this definately creates a strong group that
 can provide competition for CLS - if certain members don't kill
 each other first. And it seems not everyone was happy with the
 merge, and a few are rumoured to have jumped ship, with others
 considering it.

 The Good:
 A big start, with four games so far. C&C TS: Firestorm was a great
 score, and getting it out as a standalone was even better.
 
 The Bad:
 You can see the OGN influence in Whitetail Extreme. Leave the hunting
 games for Divine, at least when they release them there's usually a good
 NFO to read. Oh, and Valusoft owns. Really.

 The Ugly:
 One week, some good releases, but a fix already.

 Comments: 

 Origin has merged with Paradigm to form Myth, so I'll score what
 they released before the merge, and that will be it (presumably)
 for OGN on this review, and in releasing period.

 The Good: 
 Complaints about the mistakes of two groups can now be directed to one
 channel.

 The Bad: 
 It's invite only.

 The Ugly: 
 They probably wouldn't be much help anyways.
 Swat3 1.2 Patch was released four times this week. PDM screwed up, CLS
 did a good one, and OGN and PDM's fixed copy were slow to be spread.

 Comments:

 Paradigm has merged with Origin to form Myth, so I'll score what
 they released before the merge, and that will be it (presumably)
 for PDM on this review, and in releasing period.

 The Good:
 Darkstone patch worked.

 The Bad:
 Swat3 update was just plain horrible. The game has Cdilla, the patch
 needs cracking, yet it wasn't done even CLOSE to properly. CLS did a
 proper one, followed by PDM's own working release and one by OGN.
 CLS made it around first where I looked so they win.

 The Ugly:
 That patch thing had to be REALLY embarassing.

 The Bad: 
 Beatmania Da is barely a game, seems more like a music exercise.

 Springerish Final Thought:

 Many thanks this week go to a group of drunks for keeping a certain dupe
 resource up when most others are failing, and to 1*2.org (fill in the *
 yourself).

 I debated combining the points of OGN and PDM and adding them to Myth.
 Then I thought better of it. Myth will be judged on their own merit,
 they will get a clean slate, but I'm not helping them out any.

 The sad part about PDM going... try as they might, they never could catch
 up to DVN over the past few months, and it was a good race.

 In just one week, Myth hops past Precise and Backlash on the to-date
 ranking, and it doesn't look like Razor will last long.

 SPECIAL FEATURE JUST TO FILL SPACE AND KILL TIME: 

 THE ORIGIN & PARADIGM MERGER: AN EDITORIAL
 ``````````````````````````````````````````

 The games scene has been pretty steady as far as brand names have gone
 over the past year. Razor, Class, Paradigm, Divine, Origin. The big five,
 all visible. Sure, there were some busts, members changes, and idleness.
 And Precise and Scar hit the scene, but really, MiniMe has caused more
 of a stir than those two.

 So the gaming community sat back and grew fat and happy with some reliable
 names. But this past week, that all came crashing down (Unnessecary
 dramatics inserted for shock value only - Ed). 

 So Paradigm and Origin have merged. So what? The games will still come,
 right? If you're a game player, have no fear, they'll still be there.

 On the other hand, the field just got a lot smaller. The scene's gone
 from five top groups to four. With Razor faltering and fading fast (it's
 been said before, and they're stormed back, but for now it's true) we're
 really left with three groups. And in all honesty, with Divine lacking
 on the supply front, we're down to two.

 So will it be a showdown between Class and Myth? Well, expect those two
 to dominate the gaming scene over the next few months minimum, if Myth
 can hold it together and not fall victim to internal conflicts which
 plague the birth of all new groups.

 The only thing left (that's interesting) is the reasoning behind the groups
 decision to merge. Lets simplify this into a brief paragraph. Paradigm has
 been faltering. Most of its original members, and newer core players, are
 gone. Many have faced busts and lawsuits and the like. Even if everyone
 was able to walk away free, the group would never be the same. Without
 a solid core, and with too much unwanted attention, a quick change was
 in order. For Origin, on the other hand, internal faltering may not
 have been the problem. The limeys did managed to pick up some good
 titles over the past year. But lack of ripping and cracking talent saw
 many of their better titles buggy or broken. A marge with Paradigm
 brings them additional ripping skill and experience, as well as stronger
 connections in the US. The Origin/Deviance relationship which was once
 incredibily strong is no longer a factor giving the Limeys an advantage,
 and this makes up for it.

 And there's a little thing called competition and the need to trimuph.
 Myth is undoubtably stronger than either group alone was. Lets just hope
 quality is impacted in a positive way, since the field of competitors
 has narrowed so greatly.

 From the Myth NFO file:
 ```````````````````````

 MYTH is the new star in the gaming heaven. We have been founded by members
 of the groups PARADiGM and ORiGiN.

 Of cause we accept new members. That means, if you are able to get games
 because you have connections to a Electronic Botique or a Games Magazine
 or even in a game company, you should apply (see the contact section below)
 We will reimburse the costs you have to supply the game and may also feed
 you with a leech account in any of these countries: USA, DE, NL, SE, FI.

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

 Well that's from the NFO file so don't bitch about me including it here,
 NFO files will spread a lot further than NWR, and if Myth didn't want
 it read, they wouldn't have wrote it.

 An interesting week, to say the least. Too bad most of the games sucked.

 Greets to: Ionizer, Jimmy Jamez, Bud, Prozac, Lester, and anyone else
            who's written reports which I am basically leeching off of
            for format and style!

was a requested nuke when +Xtremist- <g> showed nick0rz
that nick0rz needs to learn to dupe <g>). 
Note: +Xtremist- balances his fatness with the +/- in his
nick. we have it logged that he admitted to this :D

=---------------Monthly Iso Utils Review------------------------=


Well, our second month in existance. I've decided to go completely away from the weekly
report of isos, not enough releases come out and I do not have the time to do it anyways,
but our monthly charts will continue to grow and become better each month, but this month
is like last months. IF NWR is on time, this report will time out perfect, the 29th of feb
and NWR will rls, so no releases should be missed on the monthly report and no time lapse
in the release. That's a big if though, knowing NWR and lester.

*NOTE*: This list was made by dupechecking on some good sites, so some dates may be off 
or possibly a release missed, if we miss anything, please email nwr@netmonkey.org with
your release list at the end of the month to help us properly catalog and review your
group each month. Thank you.




So no in no particular order:

Well, not quite as big a month as last month for the boys at rise. 
They land some pretty nice titles, but only 6 releases, since they
had 14 last month. Unigraphics is obviously the cream of the crop,
they had to do a little fix on the crack, but it still was a nice
release getting it out before shipping date. Cimatron comes out
finally after a long wait, guess it took em awhile to finish
the rest of the stuff on the cd, but there it is. Ironcad is the
other gem here, a real nice cad program that gets overlooked alot
in the top rankings of cad/cam titles. They also put out a new
solidmaster update, with an extra update on the cd, which was
a nice touch. So a nice quality month, but not as active.

022700 FORM-Z.V3.5.REPACK-TFL

Well, TFL has a big month here with 16 total releases, and some
nice ones indeed, they had some bookware and less than stellar
titles mixed in for filler, but they land Powermill and copycad,
2 fine titles off the delcam line, procam2k which is also an
overlooked cad/cam gem. 3dsmax 3.1 has to be the top title of
the month for them though. A few updates of some nice titles,
they repacked FORMZ, which loses them a point on the quality
scaled, but clearly the top group of the month, getting their
spot back from last month.

Well, Risciso does it's general run of the mill apps, releasing
their standard 2 ms apps a month, the same 2 apps i might add,
and they get Corel deluxe but it's for linux, which is a nice
release, but not as good as grabbin the PC versions. PVCS is 
a nice release too.

PSF has a decent month here, but they had to fix some problems,
two of them were their problems, and one was a fix for Rise's
inventor, which is a bonus for them. But they had to do a crackfix
on Omega research and a re-rls of SF acid rock, so not a real
smooth month for the boys at PSF. The apps are nice, but nothing
super spectacular here. Inventor is obviously the best, but
it's been talked about alot, massive props to PSF for the fixup
though. Metacreations Vector effects is another real nice program
for PSF this month, I'm not familiar with the first 2 apps but they 
seemed to be of nice quality from the descriptions, downloading
and burning every iso released does not appeal to me. <g>

I'm hoping this isn't a Mcafee program you can download from their
ftp site like most of the mcafee softwares, but since it did come
in iso form, I assume they at least got a free cd. So I will give
the benefit of the doubt here. I dont even want to know what Home

get one more appearance with the rls of Mediastudio pro

--------------

Every month I will be rating in my personal opinion, the top 10 releases of the month.

These are also in no particular order.

--------------

1. EDS.UNIGRAPHICS.16.FINAL.FULL.SET.ISO-RiSE
2. CIMATRON.IT.V10.6.FULLY.CRACKED.AND.WORKING.ISO-RiSE
3. KINETIX.3D.STUDIO.MAX.V3.1-TFL
4. Autodesk.Inventor.1.0.Fully.Working.And.Cracked-PSF
5. TEKSOFT.PROCAM2000.SUITE.V17.0-TFL
6. Total.3D.Home.Deluxe.v2.0-SHOCKiSO
7. DELCAM.POWERMILL.V2.510-TFL
8. VDS.IRONCAD.V3.2.ISO-RiSE
9. Total.3D.Landscape.Deluxe.v1.0-SHOCKiSO
10. Metacreations.KPT.Vector.Effects.Pro.1.5-PSF

Again, those are in no particular order. I would have too much
trouble trying to decide which was supposed to be where in the top 10.

-------

The month of February goes to TFL with a commanding number of releases over
the rest of the competition, with rise pulling second and PSF grabbing 3rd.
All of the top 3 had some real nice apps through the month and each group
had a few mistakes as well, hopefully we will see less and less of these nukes,
but seeing as how this is today's scene, I doubt it. A nice month though, with
some of the top cad/cam titles of the year out, as well as probably one of the 
best overall apps of the year, 3dsmax. until next month, I bid you adieu.

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 


Uhmmm..wtf did I see?

OH YEA

Wonder Boys
Starring: Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, Katie Holmes, & Robert Downey Jr.
Rating: 3 1/2 out of 4 Stars

This is a nice little comedy about writers. Douglas plays a teacher with
some...problems..his wife left him, one of his students lives with him,
and another student is well, disturbed. It's hard to really describe the
scope of this film, as you'd give away alot of the fun. It's a great movie
and all the actors are superb in it. If downey could just stay out of jail
and make a few more movies, he might have a nice career. <G>

------


Reindeer Games
Starring: Ben Affleck, Charlize Theron(OMG), Gary Sinise
Rating: 3 out of 4 Stars
Directed by: John Frankenheimer(Arlington Road/Scream3)

Well, Frankenheimer is turning into one of my more
favorite  screenwriters and directors, I loved Arlington
Road and Scream3 was a pleasant surprise, he's done plenty
of other movies but these are recent gems for him. This film
is also quite good, has some nice surprise twists that you
don't really see coming(much like his style), and Theron is
just a goddess, she is amazingly hot, and she's naked as per
her contract I guess, she is naked in every movie she makes but
that damn monkey one. Affleck plays a convict who gets out of jail
and gets with his penpal(theron) and they do the wild thing and then
her brother spoils the party by trying to get affleck to help his
gang of idiots to rob the local casino. Fun times for all.

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is  usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear  people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination  of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.

DENNISON'S GAME REVIEW
----------------------
Denni has a busy week, so no reviews here, I'll do one tho.

Whitetail Extreme
rlsed by Myth sometime last week

Ok, I thought hey, a hunting game sounds like a little late night
fun while i'm bored, shoot some animals and shit. So i fire it up,
you get a bow and a gun, nice deal, all looks fine so far, but
then you get to the actual "gameplay" which is like less interactive
than a fucking XXX game. You click and the screen changes, every
once in awhile a damn deer pops up, half of them you can't even shoot
at. You can't shoot at random shit either, it has to be a deer your
supposed to fire at, etc..I played this thing for about 20-25 minutes,
didn't  fire my fucking gun once, exitted and deleted the bitch. Thank
god for the scene, if I had purchased that game I would have got my
own gun and gone hunting for best buy employees. 

So in review, the game sucks dick.
