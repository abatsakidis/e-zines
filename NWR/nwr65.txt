Well buddy boys, we didn't make it last week, due to the fact
that nobody came up with anything for me and I was also too busy
so this week I will include Poison's fill-in utils report for last
week simply out of respect for him doing something when no one else
did. Anyhow, we have some new ppl workin shit. Bud is mr. reliable
as usual again and Novo tries his hand at the biased report.
Hando is our stats man for good now. If you have weektops
please get them to me or him. Blitz is back, maybe for good?
Who knows. Anyhow guys I'm real busy, enjoy the issue.

Les.

Novocaine's Biased Courier Report

Angels On Drugs:  These guys are good with their mix of pres and trading.
Faith appears to be on vacation but MoonSabre and Darkwolf pick up the
slack!  Cedric was preing and trading quite a bit creating semi-record
breaking weektops!
Overall rating 7 / 10 (Still Numero Uno)

Rise In Superior Couriering:  Not quite as dominant as they were from years
before.  Psedo putting up great numbers with Borg helping out.  Avalanche
was showing up on lesser sites, but great overall effort from these guys!
Overall rating 5 / 10 (getting there!)

Amnesia:  Kruzin getting back to his oldself?  Possible.  He's doing very
well on most sites.  Not being on FH hurts his score.  Cardiel also doing
some work.  But these guys arn't doing as well as the weeks before.
Overall rating:  5.5 / 10 (higher score because more guys active)

Devotion: Where's Godbless?  with only Jaydee preing, a weak presence was
shown.  Prozax didn't help much either.  Let's hope these guys bounce back
soon.
Overall rating:  3 / 10 (the sleeping giant waiting to reclaim #1)

Ascension:  These guys suck without Drunkkid :/
Overall rating:  0 / 10

Ambition:  Where's the ambition? not there :)
Overall rating: 0 / 10

A mediocre week for all groups, let's hope things get more exciting next week.


Power Ratings:

1)  Devotion:  With a trader like Godbless and prewhores like Jaydee, and a
               multitude of amazing boxes, these guys appear to be #1
               Boxes: 10/10
               Leadership:  7/10
               Couriers:  6/10 (godbless accounts for 5, Prozax 1)
               Pres:  10/10
               Score:  33/40 

2)  AOD:  With Cedric preing and decent box, these guys are a stable second.
               Boxes: 6.5/10
               Leadership:  8/10
               Couriers:  9/10
               Pres: 9/10
               Score: 32.5 / 40

3)  Amnesia:  A group of talented traders and many boxes, they appear to
              be building a fine comback.  Only time will tell.
               Boxes: 7.5/10
               Leadership: 8/10
               Couriers: 6/10
               Pres: 0/10
               Score:  21.5/40

4) ASN:  Drunkkid is their star, without him they are in trouble
               Boxes:  6/10
               Leadership: 5/10
               Couriers: 3/10
               Pres: 5/10
               Score:  19/40

5)  RiSC:  Not bad, but just not good enough to compete hard.
               Boxes:  5/10
               Leadership: 4/10
               Couriers: 8/10
               Pres: 0/10
               Score:  17/40

THE BLITZ REPORT FOR UMM TODAY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<citiznfsh> mrp!!!
<citiznfsh> i have a good news
<citiznfsh> MrPuMPkiN: blitz is fully back
<MrPuMPkiN> how is that good?
<MrPuMPkiN> his *retirement* was all shit anyway
<MrPuMPkiN> after his track record its not hard to see why
<MrPuMPkiN> you only need to read his retirement letter to see how fucked up he is

   Seems not everyone is happy to see me... no surprise there. Sorry MrPoWeRTRiP. 
What can I say? It's crack. The scene drags you back in every time you try to leave. 
The internet got hooked up and I came online. Next thing you know I'm adding users 
to my old site and getting railroaded into doing NWR next week. So yeah, expect 
to see the same old shit from me again... more ragging on Origin for lack of social 
skills, more bitching about CLS chess games.. maybe even a little making fun of 
Razor. Don't expect to see much more than that though, time is tight these days... 
but at least for a while NWR will be fun again.

===============================================================================
 OMG YET ANOTHER GAMES REPORT ISSUE #1
 -------------------------------------

 Note: This report is best viewed in DOS Editor, AcidDraw, some other
       good ASCII editor, or on the chest of a Playboy Bunny.

 Yes that's right, yet another games report to bother you with. Please don't
 ask me how I ended up in NWR, I don't even know. Well I do, I sent it to Bud
 to review and he got it in since people seem to have been complaining about
 a lack of a games report recently. I'm doing this intro sort of last minute,
 so I guess I'll just get on with the scoring system.

 One last note, I'm not involved much in the scene, but am instead more
 of an enduser and observer - so this report will take its perspective
 accordingly.

                                                        - The Preacher Kane

 The Points:
 -----------

 * Games will be scored on a scale of 0 to 5, points being awarded according
   to the quality of the title. And not just quality by name - after all,
   an anticipated "blockbuster" can suck as badly as the worst budget
   schlock.

 * A fix will result in a loss of .5 (one half) of a point. If the fix
   is released by a group other than that which released the game, they
   will earn the extra point.

 * Addons such as Movies and Music will earn between 1 and 2 points,
   depending on the title AND whether or not they actually ENHANCE the
   gaming experience. Addons released by groups other than the group
   who originally released the game will not be considered. Addons of
   essential features (IE Textures, 3DFX, stuff that should not have
   been ripped to begin with) will result in the loss of 1 point. Which
   means certain titles can earn points even if some people consider them
   "rapes" - I'm on a modem after all!

 * Retail addons will recieve a score of between 1 and 4 points if they
   are developed by the original developers of the game, or are officially
   licensed. Unofficial addons will not be considered. Standalone addon
   packs are always preferable to a standard addon release. If a group
   releases an addon which is later released as a standalone, only
   the standalone will recieve points.

 * Update patches and trainers will earn 1 point each provided they
   are fully working. A trainer released by a group after an existing
   trainer has already been made available in an earlier release will
   only be considered if it offers something NEW, otherwise it will be
   considered a DUPE.

 * Cheat codes will be worth .5 (one half) of a point. Since updates and
   trainers take more skill to produce, simple cheat codes cannot be
   assigned an equal value.

 * A DUPE of a game will result in the loss of 1 point, with the
   following exception: A game that was lost during a race between two
   groups will not result in the loss of any points (we do need some
   competition in the scene!).

 * Repackaging of a game will result in the loss of .5 (one half) of a point.

 * Non-English games will not be considered. Sorry, I only speak one
   language.

 * I retain the right to bend the rules any way I see fit!


 * DATES *

 Since it's been some time since a games report has been available, I'm
 including the last 20 days of releases - 10/28/99 thru to 11/16/99.

 Comments:

 Not much. Stick to german titles.

 The Good:
 They did get Flanker 2 and FIFA 2000, but they're too far back to include
 here.

 The Bad:
 7 Kingdoms patch was broken.

 The Ugly:
 Lack of... everything... when it comes to US titles, but they aren't
 really serious about it (I hope).

 Comments:

 So far in November Class has continued the steady releasing pace we
 have become accumtomed to seeing from them week after week, month after
 month. Steady releases, some good titles, and clear domination of US
 store titles. Still, with ISO release groups seemingly no longer waiting
 for their rip group counterparts, CLS is facing increased competition and
 finding itself in more and more races.

 The Good:
 Spec Ops 2. Despite the fact that many were disappointed by the original,
 it will nonetheless be a popular download this week. Plus they were raced
 by Divine and held off to win - a good thing since the DVN rip turned
 out to be broken. A good job as well with Hasbro's Axis & Allies
 continuation, Axis & Allies: Iron Blitz. While the PC version isn't as
 fun as drinking beer with friends and playing the board game, it's still
 worth a play or two. Keep note: I gave 1.5 for that trainer with cheats
 since they included both.

 The Bad:
 A Disk fix for Sim Theme Park, and a repack of an update patch.

 The Ugly:
 Virtual Chess Academy. Just because it's an ISO doesn't mean it should be
 ripped. This package is actually Virtual Chess 2 with new tutorials for
 1999 - thus the name "Academy". Unfortunately, since Class ripped these,
 we wind up with Virtual Chess 2 - which CLS released in 1997! Didn't you
 guys notice every file date in the game was old???

 Wow, Divine woke up! The group normally flooding the scene with hunting
 junk finally took advantage of the recent flood of ISO games not ripped
 to show off its own ripping skill. While not everything went smooth for
 Divine in the past twenty days, they did manage two pick up two of the
 best titles in that stretch.

 The Good:
 Omikron: The Nomad Soul for EIDOS. This turned out to be one of the biggest
 suprises of the fall - a great game, and an incredible rip, down from 3(!)
 CD's. Ignore TBT's (and we know who they area) claims as to textures being
 ripped, they're all there. However, the game still did end up needing
 two fixes for crashes, which together cost DVN a full point.

 The other big suprise was Delta Force 2. Divine managed to get it in at
 50 disks, despite cries of Beta. Well, guess what, it's identical to the
 store copy - version and all - thus making it final. Origin's so called
 FINAL patch is actually just a regular update - and it makes the multiplayer
 more screwed up than it already is. Speaking of which, Inet play via
 NovaWorld will not work due to a ByteCheck feature.

 The Bad:
 A loss of the race for Spec Ops 2 (DVN gets lucky here, there version
 was broken, but they don't loose points since a loss counts as 0 either
 way). Also, a few fixes, and repacks, lowered the score here.

 The Ugly:
 Perhaps taking a page out of the CLS book? Snow Board Racer was rumored to
 be a repack of Snow Wave Avalanche. Seems nothing much changed aside from
 the name, some graphics, and a few new file dates. At least it's not from
 1997!

 Comments:

 Yikes, is this the new ROR or what?!? That's exagerating. but Origin is NOT
 running strong, in fact it seems the limey invasion has stalled. In the
 past twenty days, OGN fell victim to poor ripping, slowness on getting on
 top of titles, and inability to race on some of the bigger ISO games rushed
 out by FLT and Deviance. Judging by this measure alone, you have to wonder
 if the partnership between Origin Deviance is in jeporady???

 The Good:
 Pharoah. And even it needed a fix. Bust A move 4!!! OLDSKOOL BABY!!!!

 The Bad:
 A lot. West Front Sea Lion was able to be released standalone, and CLS did
 it, so no soup (woops, points) for you! OGN looses by two hours on Sim
 Theme Park. They complained about the CLS rip, but it was within the limit
 and working. Divine's Delta Force 2 turned out to be final, so the patch is
 misleading, an actually screws up the multiplayer option worse than just the
 NovaWorld problem. Mortyr, the Wolf3D clone from some Polish developer, was
 poorly ripped, and PDM put it out just two hours later at over 10 disks
 smaller in size. 

 The Ugly:
 Just about everything I meantioned above. When almost your only good game
 needs a fix, and your releases are constantly being redone due to poor 
 ripping, you're in some HOT water indeed.

 Comments:

 After the John Lennon fiasco earlier in the year, Paradigm had a bit
 of rebuilding to do, and it seems that it is just now getting back on
 its feet with several titles. Unfortunately no one's ever heard of half
 of these games. PDM is doing well in the Euro market however.

 The Good:
 They did a proper rip of Mortyr. Yes OGN's rip was only one disk over
 the limit, but OGN didn't put ANY effort into it. The PDM rip is essentially
 the same, just much smaller. Too bad the game sucks though.
 Theif Gold, of course, is worth noting, and Abomination.

 The Bad:
 Nothing really, except perhaps the lack of a spectacular title.

 The Ugly:
 Nada.

 Comments:

 Precise is the first of two fairly new groups I'll review this month.
 Their first release was a rip of the Deviance ISO Half Life: Opposing
 Force, an addon for Half Life where you take the role of a soldier on the
 other side.

 The Good:
 Competition is heating up... more groups in the games scene than I can
 ever remember.

 The Bad:
 A fix for the addon, and a fix for the NFO as well.

 The Ugly:
 The rip of Half Life was a nuke to begin with. Class did it at 59 disks.
 I gave them a point since SOMEONE is bound to want this, but the two
 fixes balances it out at zilch.

 Comments:

 *COUGH* There seems to be a bit of dust clinging around here. Razor hasn't
 seen a game in some time. The group is mostly idle. They don't even manage
 to get in on the ISO races, and aside from patches and trainers can't get
 anything done. This is really sad to see, since RZR is one of my favorite
 groups of all time - and one of the few QUALITY orientated groups of the
 entire scene. Unfortunately, members are getting agitated, and things look
 like they're only going to get worse. The council is basically running the
 group these days, and most of them are idle as well.

 The Good:
 They managed to do something.

 The Bad:
 Only Backlash and Precise did worse in the past twenty days.

 The Ugly:
 Things are not going to get any better in the near future.

 Comments:

 Scar is an upstart group which says it will be releasing "what other
 groups won't". However, unlike pathetic jokes such as TBT and INTERGANG,
 or even half-decent front groups such as MiniMe, Scar is a legit group with
 real members. So give them a shot.

 The Good:
 A great rip of Monopoly 2, which OGN had before any other group yet
 didn't "monopolize" on. A ton of re-routing in this one. And of course, NBA
 Live 2000. Now this will be contreversial. Yes, they ripped 3DFX. According
 to Faction rules 3DFX is essential. Ok. I don't give a shit about the
 Faction personally, but I'll accept that. So a point is docked for
 making an essential component an addon. It's still a great release for
 those on modems or without burners.

 The Bad:
 Keanu Reeves??? Ummm... no comment.

 The Ugly:
 Avoid the crap games... stick to hard rips... otherwise things could
 go downhill... but so far so good.

 Top 3 Releases This Report:

 Interstate 82 (CLS)
 Omikron: The Nomad Soul (DVN)
 Delta Force 2 (DVN)

 Springerish Final Thought:

 Few last things... I didn't rank Dynasty (German junk mostly). CLS was the
 #1 group on sheer quantity alone, but took only one of the top 3 games
 listed here. They're going to face increased competition from groups such as
 Paradigm and Divine. With ISO groups releasing more and more without waiting
 for rips, groups such as Scar and Precise could actually snag a title or
 two.

 Well that's the end of my report. Don't know when/if ever I'll be back. Hope
 you enjoyed it. Singing off...

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Sorry about last week... seems all of NWR was MIA... hopefully everything
 is back to normal now. Of course I can NEVER be considered NORMAL...

 La-dee-daaa..... in a bit of a rush so if this week's report kinda sucks...
 blame Lester! <G>.
  
 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 11/09/99 to 11/15/99. I'm in the EST time zone so

 Lemon... that could describe a few groups this week... pulling a big fat ol' lemon...
 XF did alright though. Mobile Services was nukes as a dupe of Scum, but I haven't
 seen the Scum release around... boy we've all become far too reliant on web-based
 dupe-checkers it seems.

 took the final of Woll2Woll's InfoPower 2000, which FCN did
 a beta of some weeks ago.

 this app in some time. Sniffer Pro from NAI is... well ok but

 and hope I do. The strongest title here this week was likely the
 CAD tool AutoManager View, which DOD beat several groups on.

 is the RBS has opened a PDA division, making them one of the first well
 known utils groups to do so.

 If my Dentist is using pirated software, I'm getting a new
 Dentist. Sorry... but I don't wanna even think about being gassed
 by such a person. A minor version of Virtual Gibs as well (this
 time with Solid Surfacer) and a new version of CC Mail from Lotus
 round out the list.
 Hmmm I think dental software is one of the smallest niches a utils
 group could cater to...

 ArcSoft.Photo.Fantasy.2000-PROS

 Not much has changed since v2.0 of Photo Fantasy, the 2000 edition
 is actually a fairly minor update - ArcSoft just wants to make
 a quick buck. Decent, fun tool for the inexperienced art types
 to play with photos, however.

 While the fall games rush is at full steam, eagerly anticipating the holiday
 season, the utils side of things has slowed. Expect more next week. Not much

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 

Anywhere But Here
Starring: Natalie Portman, Susan Sarandon
Rating: 2 3/4 out of 4 stars

Well this is more of a chick movie than anything else, but it's still
a very good movie as it is. Ya so I'm a sensitive guy big deal. Move on!
If you have a g/f then take her to it you'll earn yourself a few points,
but the movie is about a mom and daughter from Wisconsin who move to
Beverly Hills to live a more glamorous lifestyle. It's about what
a single mom and a daughter go through. Anyhow it's worth seeing. 
Sarandon and Portman are both very good in it and Portman is a little
hottie.

---

The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc
Starring: Milla Jovovich, John Malkovich, Dustin Hoffman.
Rating: 3 1/2 out of 4 Stars

This is directed by the guy who did The Fifth Element. It's a very
nice story(most people know the story), and it's well acted by
an ex-model in Jovovich. The action scenes are solid and the religious
interventions aren't too overbearing. Hoffman is a surprise casting choice
but a good one, and the supporting fighters of Joan are very good.
It's long at 2 and a half hours or more. So it's an epic, but it's
worth your time for sure.

Peace yo.

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is  usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear  people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination  of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.

--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors, we all love them even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us. And these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, your name will not be included, but we
do not add rumors like that say "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion"
because we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore
there is no hard evidence of that rumor, so if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!

Rumor has it that Jaydee is back in action and is working to father
a child with new recruit Aenima.
