        Merry Christmas boys and girls, our present to you is a HUGE 
    jampacked issue of stuff. We have a new website sponsor in union.jaded.net 
    hosted by our much ragged upon friend Union. So check that out and pick up 
    the new issues. We will also be holding surveys on BlackAcid's page once in 
    the coming weeks. So please participate in those so we can post the results 
    here in the magazine. We are a little late this week and so we apologize for 
    that, but I think the magnitude of the magazine will make up for it. 
        Thanks for reading and please dont message us daily if NWR is late. 
    It will be out when it's out:)

                                       -Lester [Co-Editor/Head Writer]



        Its beginning to feel a lot like christmas...

        Well dear readers, as i write this, i am something on the order 
    of 37,000 feet in air, with my IBM thinkpad, and some FSOL (no shit!)
    on the airline radio station... Yeah. phear me, negroes... ;p
    The majority of NWR is being edited aboard an Air Canada 747-400... 
    only 2 hours late after takeoff.. ;p
        Btw, Air Canada can officially suck me for all who care. Also, 
    i am drunk on rum+cokes and white russians (--not a good combination 
    for all who are keeping score at home) so if the issue is
    unnecessarily "nice" or "uncritical" then... uh... sorry.. (what can
    i say? i'm a happy drunk!)

        The Xmas season is in full swing now, with Razor1911 putting out 
    a few very nice releases, finally giving Class a bit of competition.. 
    Check out Prozac's Games Report for the full details.. Also, Bud is 
    back with his (biased?) Utils Report for a third straight week. 
    Coincidently, the in-flight movie is "Air BUD 2 - The Golden Reciever"
    Did i mention my love of Air Canada yet?  ;p
        Also in the Xmas theme, Siege had a few problems last week with
    #SiEGEXMAS, but things should be all worked out by the time this gets
    released, so stop by there, and pick up one of SiEGE's 400+ 1998 
    releases... 

        Well, we honestly never thought that our pics of JESS would be
    such a big hit.. likewise, we never thought that tdpriest's artwork
    would go over so well.. So, without further ado, we present you with
    jesspic3.jpg, featuring the artwork of tdpriest!

        This issue features an article we have been planning for a damn
    long time, the "Top 10 Couriers of Alltime"... We realize that no
    matter who we picked, there was going to be a hell of a lot of 
    contraversy, so skip ahead to that section, and let the bitchin' begin!
        
        This could be our best issue ever, so go read the damn thing!!

-----------[ ndetroit's sites and stats section ]-----------


    So.. big discussions this week... Why wasn't TV included
  in the Top10 sites section, if IC was? A lot of ppl that i 
  have been talking to swear that TV gets shit 10x faster than
  IC... I watch both sites pretty closely, and i would call them
  about even. A lot of ppl say that TV's link is the best in the
  US, and owns IC's... well, not quite. It owns IC's, but its 
  not the best link by a longshot. The best link in the US belongs
  to a site that we never mention in NWR, out of respect to the
  siteop's wishes. If you are on both these sites, i think you'll
  agree with me that the xfer rate on XXX2 is faster than TV.

    TV has better affils than XXX2..? probably. Better than IC?
  That is arguable. Unquestionably, IC has better traders
  supporting it (garoto, etc), but that doesn't mean that TV
  isn't faster.
    What is boils down to is: What is the best site in the US?
  At this point, its all a matter of opinion. But i can say that
  I am thoroughly convinced enough that TV warrants a spot on NWR
  this week, if only for the fact that we have ignored it for so
  long... and it damn well would have been there, had someone given
  me a f@#$king weektop for it! :)
    From what i hear, TOS (the site with the ass-kicking welcome
  ascii) also has a pretty unbelieveable link..I would love to
  wholeheartedly get behind this site, as it has a good pedigree,
  (DEV) and knowledgeable, experienced siteops... my only problem
  with it is: CLS/SIEGE/DEV... this is the same goddamned site as
  IC!#&%#!!  ... something will have to give. Which do you think
  will win out?   ;)

    Dreamland is back. The original DL was the best site in the US
  for a DAMN long time, and had been up for about 3 years before 
  being narked. It's 2nd time around, it was just starting to get
  to the point where it was before, before another narking.
    Now its back, and the siteops are determined to make it last..
  Its already damn fast.. my bet is that it will be top5 by new years.

    Well, well, well... Guess who has their CLASS affil back?
  That's right.. after parting with MGD, and welcoming home CHINABLUE, 
  class took STH back.. STH = EHQ (i think?) While STH is a great
  site for any group to have, only time will judge Class' decision
  to (essentially) choose cb over mgd.... 

    I am convinced that BHZ is not a real site, and simply a joke
  being purported by Eagle_1 in his old age... (the dude's always
  idling in the BHZ chan..) No, BHZ is not real.. Its E1, et al,
  trying to see if they can affil with as many possible groups as
  they can in the least amount of time. They are going for the 
  scene record, formerly held by kruzin and koka (tie).
    Good luck Eagle_1!!

    CO... i don't know wtf is going on with that site, cause i 
  don't have an account there! BAHAHAHAHA!
    In case you didn't understand what i was Very Damn Ready
  about last week, i will make it simple for you: the lake is
  back, and already kicking ass. Two scoops of raisons to those
  (*ahem*) bitches... 
    Uhh.. RAY sucks, and i haven't heard much about NCT.. if
  someone wants to give me leech accts on either, i will check 
  them out... BAHAHAHA.. ;)
    FS is still the #1 site by a longshot, but at least STH will
  start to make things interesting again. ET is great, (someone 
  said to me the other day that PDM should only ever pre to ET,
  and i agree with them... thats what makes ET great)
    Earlier i mentioned a us site, XXX2 (you figure it out).. I
  feel as tho its only fair to say that it is not the only site
  that we exclude from NWR. Another site that could certainly
  be in our X3 row is also missing on a weekly basis. 
    That site is DAMN private, and most ppl that i know that are
  lucky enough to be on it say that it is easily the (site with the)
  fastest link in the world. I don't wanna get in any shit over this,
  but if you know wtf i am talking about, then i think that you
  will agree that this site deserves including. As always, the 
  wishes of siteops MUST be our single deciding factor. 
  
=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. 
	Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... 
heh... fuck off and die..

          The Top Ten sites for this week are:

-----------[ Lester's Biased Courier Section ]-----------


	I traded this week, I think I showed up on 2 or 3 weektops. So fucking 
fear that, but in my mild trading I noticed one thing: restarters are fucking 
everywhere. 
	It is ridiculous, there are about 20 traders trading at one time and 
maybe 2-3 of them dont restart 5 or 6 times a release. I watched Kruzin restart 
the same file 9 times on a games release. And tons of other people as well. 
Me and Morbid were having some laughs about it. Anyways let's check out the 
groups


Dimension: Well DMS just pounced on everyone this week. Severely dominating 
every site by up to a gig over the next group. But at the end of the week, 
Godbless, #1 ranked courier the past few weeks, was whisked away to Devotion. 
So the stats evened up a little bit, but DMS still held it's top spot on all 
the sites. Some people asked me how it felt to lose the #1 guy, and it's not 
that big of a deal, in AMN I lost MGD when he was much more dominant than 
Godbless..so no big deal. :) DMS is still the top group in the scene right 
now. Whether it will last or not we shall see.

Risc: Risc up to their old tricks? Deleting Godbless from HOL (he was #1 
alltime) for "excessive restarting" now I'll admit, godbless does restart a 
hell of alot, but one wonders if Risc was a little upset that another DMS 
guy was dominating their sites. But oh well, either way, Risc is still highly 
fucked.

Millennium: 2 pickups for MNM this week, trying desperately to prove to NWR 
they aren't dead. Moonsabre and Vylent joined up, we will see if they can spur 
some life into the group.

Vengeance: Still sucking ass, Lethal going to Devotion is a downer for this 
near dead group.

Devotion: The biggest moves of the week, grabbing Lethal and Godbless, also 
making the neccesary changes to keep Jaydee happy. Devotion makes a push to 
get back on track, we will see what happens. They still have Snakeeyes and 
shit like that who continually make dev look bad with their idiotic actions 
though. 

AOD: Currently the number 2 group, but they may lose that title to Dev now 
this week. They are quiet and don't talk shit. I also have to add that 
Nightsky is also AOD so I now know of 3 ppl. :)

TFA: Man you guys are still on sites?

Phoenix: I dont have the slightest idea who is in this group, so you need 
to do a tad better

Ambition: Word on the street is they will attempt a comeback, if they 
can convince DM to trade again it'd be possible. Who knows..AMB was 
always a pretty decent group

-----------[ Prozac's Kinda Biased Gaming Report]-----------
            
Prozac's Kind of Biased Gaming Report

Part two of I don't when this will end gaming report is here, talking about 
all the games from Sunday, December 13th to Monday, December 21st. This week 
was not as interesting as last week, but several major games came out during 
the week by RZR & OGN, then the usual j0nx from the rest. Here's a weekly round 
up report about all the groups:

Class-
Another week passes, and the usual "stuff" just comes out from Class. Nothing
too exciting, though Luftwaffe Commander was in stores for over 48 hours
before Class put it out. Shows how little activity there is in store pickups,
which in the past use to be fierce. Expect CLS to keep on bringing the usual
mediocre games for the next coming weeks.

I do have to say one thing to a couple people out there in the peanut gallery:
FUCK YOU. Yes CLS did two hunting games in December, but one was by a company
with a very prestigious name (Sierra, Trophy Buck), and another where the game
was actually quite cool if you people actually PLAYED IT (Carnivores). NO,
we are NOT releasing just so we can beat OGN for the month. If this was so,
I could go out and do three games lying on store shelves FACTION APPROVED.
OGN's Pinky and The Brain WC? Ppppplllllzzzz...

Hot Releases:
Carnivores - 15 disks
Luftwaffe Commander - 48 disks

Paradigm-
With Drizzt gone, and the Germans & French on vacation, expect PDM to be 
slow for the next couple weeks. While they finally got some .au competition, 
it's not much. RUMOR: Zeus of PDM (Founder) has gotten pretty fed up with 
some certain "problems" outside of the scene, and will be taking a very 
long vacation.

Hot Releases:
N/A

Razor-
For the second week in a row, a group comes out of left field for an awaited
game. Too bad RZR fucked it up. Many people are complaining about the speech
& music ripped out, taking out a lot of the fun in the game that made the
original rip an instant classic. RZR then turns around and does 2 lame games
(Dupe PDM on a bad RTS game, then put out a gey darts game that I passed over).
RZR should be quiet for a couple weeks until some people get off their asses 
and do something. Also, RZR displayed its pure immaturity when Smokey recanted 
from leaving CLS. Grow up people!

Hot Releases:
Starcraft: Brood War - 40 disks
Elite Darts - 6 disks
Hespian Wars *DUPE* - 12 disks

Origin-
Whelp money talks. OGN steals a potential supplier from CLS by paying him 
money for a game (Outrage), then manages to do a well-awaited US game 
(heh, the mag in action, yeah baby!) Starsiege Tribes, but got a lot of 
groans for being a multi-only game. Also, Cypher wrote the STUPIDEST .nfo 
ever for Starsiege Tribes, by writing up about Starsiege, the mech game! 
PENATLY BOX!
The Christmas rush is slowing down, but it looks like OGN has the chance to
win one month in Dec. (phear ][ce going to every channel boasting this, the
scene has been fair warned)

Hot Releases:
Outrage - 23 disks
Starsiege Tribes - 27 disks

Divine-
DVN is back to releasing crap passed up. Another bad expert game from DVN this
Week. Hey where's Bow Hunter?! It's only $10, and not out! Expect DVN to go
back to their old ways, inactive and releasing j0nx.
Hot Releases:
Mountain Game Hunter - 17 disks

Last minute comments:
If you don't know already after being in the scene for years, the day after
Christmas to about the end of February is absolutely boring. Between then,
usually only about 15-25 games are put out among major groups, while it picks
up for the spring rush. I suggest finding those games you've been wanting to
play but had no time to get them now, and play them in the first 2 months of
'99, because if you don't, you'll be moaning for weeks, "I wanna play
something new!" While Jan. might be interesting, it won't make up for the 
flow of games that usually come out all during the year. If your into the
scene, invest into finding a gaming archive site, it'll help fix those boredom
blues.

Word up to Union & his scene web site, http://union.jaded.net.

Bud's Biased Utils Report #3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Back again! Last weeks report was a bit rough due to exams on my part. My
editing sucked in that edition, this week it's much cleaner. And more biased!
Starting with this issue I'll be listing the weeks releases from each group,
instead of droning on about each of them... and perhaps some other changes
as well. I'm also displaying the DIZ of each group reviewed now since they
look so pretty. ;)

For those of you wondering why this report differs so greatly from the one
found in CWS, well, I feel that any ranking of releases should be based on
quality - not quantity. I also tend to differentiate between cracks, regged
shareware and utils - there is no fair way to compare a 10$ system
monitor program to an app like Director 7, for example.

Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
            & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
            it... SCREW YOU =]

Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
          releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
          Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
          a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
          I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
          Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
          reason I see fit.

Week: Week is based from 12/13/98 to 12/19/98. I'm in the EST time zone so
      dates/times run according to it.

Groups: (In no particular order)

PIRATES WITH ATTITUDE:

Releases:

Microsoft.Windows.2000.Professional.Beta3-RC0.build.1946-PWA [31 x 10MB]

Well Windows 2000 Professional is the new name for NT Workstation 5...
but enough with the Win beta shit already! Do we really need more buggy
software from Microsoft??? Some people will enjoy this... personally my
system is fucked up enough from Win95. Oh and it was WAY over the limit. 
Some sites nuked, some approved, so I'll still give some points for it.

THE CORPORATION:

Releases:

Cognos.PowerPlay.v6.0.199.4.User.Edition-CORP [14 x 2.88MB]
Disneys.A.Bugs.Life.Print.Studio-CORP         [30 x 2.88MB]
Datametrics.Viewpoint.v4.2.Win9xNT.FINAL-CORP [05 x 1.44MB]
McAffee.Office.Suite.v.1.0-CORP               [30 x 2.88MB]

After the loss of points for D7 beta last week, Corp gets a fresh start...

I thought A Bug's Life Studio was a joke when I first saw it - 
unfortunately it wasn't. Maybe your kids will enjoy it for Xmas. They 
released McAffee Suite v1.0, proudly stating none of the programs in the 
suite could be downloaded from McAffee's FTP - too bad every single program 
in the suite has already been released seperately. Seems quality problems 
are still abound. Corp picked up DL this week on the site side of things, 
and dropped RAY after some problems with Easy, who was then  removed as a 
siteop... hrmm now wasn't he involved in the Entity/MDK thing? Sheesh. 
And has the parting of Semaj taken its toll? Corp certainly isn't releasing 
as much. Be sure to check out the Semaj/CORP logs on TCA though =)

This week saw RISE releasing once again - wow! Since RISE is one of 
my personal fav's it's great to see that excellent cracking team at work. 
Again, I'd love to see some big name mainstream apps out from RISE. 
What else.. well these guys have more sites then I can fuckin' believe, 
and they picked up BHZ as AHQ. And RAY. And CO (which has announced no 
other affils besides SHK/RISE). Then BHZ went to CORP, and after a brief 
stay from CORP to ENT. I'm soooooo confused with that fucking site. 
Oh well. I just hope we don't see any RISE MEGA HQ's reminiscent of 
XF. This week also saw Drizzit & Bunter join the group!

SGE has taken top spot two weeks straight, and took the two best utils of
last week - but it's doubtful they could have matched their previous
performance this week. Still they're one of the most powerful groups
around, and that's not going to change anytime soon. Ewww.. a virus!
Oh well... I think every group's done this at least once. A good week
overall.

Releases:

NOVELL.GROUPWISE.v5.5-ENTiTY [38 x 1.44MB]

Despite the fact the some sites nuke all Novell software, Groupwise is still
a nice title, and a lot of people have been waiting for it. Bones seems to be
doing a good job holding the group together, so for all the recent problems,
Entity has shown it's still in the game. The new site BHZ joined on as AHQ,
and they also picked up Alkivar from TRPS. Alkivar was at odds with TRPS
since he (then a TRPS member) nuked their 1000th release (See the log in
NWR27). Oh and Warlord joined. Problem this week was in getting the 
releases out - they stalled after groupwise, due to finals week for Bones..

DocuShare.v1.5.For.WinNT-PNC    [10 x 1.44MB]


OMG PNC released! After being completely idle last week, they finally
put something out!

Well it's nice to see Pinnacle releasing, but to be honest I'm not
sure what kind of a future the group has left. Even when they are
releasing, the titles aren't close to the quality of old. DocShare is
ok, but MFD released the PRO version of Media Palatte 1.5 a day before
PNC did the PLUS edition, and the PRO contains more features. Still, 
for the most part PNC has managed to avoid fuckups/dupes/broken releases,
which has hampered other struggling groups such as HTG - but it's hard 
to fuck up a release when you don't have any. The rebirth of SCUM saw 
PNC take another blow as they lost members to the reformation.

"They're Baaaccckkk!!!" (Think Poltergiest). PRM makes its return
this week, with Fusion once again at the helm, and many of its former
members have returned to it. Despite its rocky history PRM certainly
has some releasing power, and this incarnation starts out with a clean
slate.

Oasis 6 was the "premiere" release for the reborn PRM, although I'm not
sure it's one I would have chosen as a debut. OASIS stands for
Operater Assisted Sewer Information System, and I'm not sure how
many people would be interested in that, since most of us don't operate
our own sewer system. Yes that's right, there was no typo - OASIS is an
addon for MS Access which is for use with "wastewater collection systems."
Bad news for PRM though.. shortly after the OASIS release, several people
began complaining it was uncracked. I decided to test it myself, and
during installation was given a message saying  "You are installing the
demo version of OASIS." The program reports that when you purchase you
will be given an unlocking code... only no unlocking code was provided.
Fusion and the other leaders acknowledged the mistake, and there's no
doubt they'll make up for it. Releases such as Software Remover Plus
3 are much nicer, and should have been considered for the initial release...
In any case they're back, they're releasing, and they had a decent week
if you look beyond the bumpy start. They would have scored a 7 but the
nuke cost them a point.

As for other news.. MDK needs a utils afill... PRM returns... hrmmm.
Could be something to that.

Cubase_v.3.6_Docs-DOD                       [31 x 1.44MB]

I wasn't sure what to expect from DOD this week, after being
fairly idle recently. Despite the fact that I personally feel they're
a great group, I didn't think they'd do much of anything. Everyone
was surprised to see Cubase 3.6 (tough dongle crack) from them (and a 31
Disk DOCS addon :P). Unfortunatly, the excitement was short-lived, as Cubase
was broken (bad CRC in the rars), and there's been no fix as of yet. That
leaves them with another Command Antivirus and Trados Translator.

Ok MFD did quite a few decent utils along with some minor regged programs
and cracks... good job on those but perhaps they need to choose a direction?
As usual I'm not listing the cracks etc. Still, in an extremely slow week,
they were one of the few bright spots.

Tekno Rage & Pirasoft are back for the second week in a row. As usual
I'm going to discount the cracks/regs of shareware/useless junk and
judge only the releases that fit into the Utils category, since this
is a utils report. TRPS saw Alkivar leave this week, taking his
shellbox with him. Apparently he's given them a few days to find a
new box before he removes their accounts, which is more than a lot
of people would have done.

I haven't tested Mr Photo yet, but I've had earlier versions and
decided not to release them - the program is horrible! Perhaps
there's been some improvements in v2.0 - lets hope so anyways. The
GOLD edition contains some other apps - Presto! Photo Album & Presto!
Photo Designer.

On top of the cracks and other releases that I don't feel fit into
the utils category, I decided not to consider WebHub Developer
v1.683, as 1.670 was released the week before by TRPS, and I'm not
going to give points everytime the group releases an extremely minor
update. But TRPS still had a strong week.
Total: 8/10

New this week: Premiere makes their return.

Idle this week: Heritage

Quote of the Week: <Toth> is idle: PRM is back.. toth ponders suicide =)


Well the underdogs took top slot this week, MFD & TRPS sharing the
lead with 8 points each. Most of the powerhouse release groups were
hurt by inactivity, nukes or both.

It was a pretty tame week as far as releases were concerned... SGE/CORP had
an NFO war and then ended it, with Freakshow from CORP making a public
post on TCA's message board apologizing for CORP's recent quality
problems. Premiere makes its return with a shakey debut, but quickly makes
up for it with some strong releases. A new group has arrived this week, IUC
(Intelligent Underground Connections), and says it will be focusing on
enterprise level applications. Not a good showing for them though, their
first release was nuked for no DIZ. Plus there's the SCUM revival, so
expect to see titles from them soon. They're yet another entry into a
crowded field... at least one group will bow out soon. BHZ switched
so many affils this past week that I lost count, so my apologies if
anything is fucked up in that regard.

--------------[The Smurfs Were a Communist Plot]--------------

Well, raberts is back... This has absolutely nothing to do with trading,
sites, cracks, or pr0n... No, this is a political article written by 2-time
NWR contributor, Raberts... enjoy!
                                                -editors


  According to this writer's theory of "Smurfian" Communism in the Post-War 
  Era, the Smurfs television show was created as part of a Soviet plot to 
  brainwash the children of the free world, as part of the USSR long-range 
  strategy for world domination...

  Note that all the Smurfs look exactly the same. They are all blue-skinned 
  with have white hats and white tails. This reflects the classless society 
  the theory of Communism proposes, in which all men and women are comrades.

  Papa Smurf is the only Smurf who wears any clothing other than the 
  standard-issue white uniform. Instead his outfit is red, which is, of 
  course, the background of the Hammer and Sickle, and the color which 
  insiuates communism.  Furthermore, Papa Smurf's unique facial hair is 
  clearly meant to conjure up images of Lenin, Stalin, and Castro.

  The Smurfs on which the show is focused are Hefty, the soldier, and 
  Handy, the worker.  On the other hand, the Smurfs portrayed negatively 
  are Greedy, who simply eats all the time, Vanity, who contributes nothing 
  to society and is lost in his own narcisism, and particularly Brainy, 
  who is but a thinly veiled caricature of Trotsky, who thinks for himself 
  too much and undermines the Smurf state.  He is repeatedly thrown out of 
  the colony.  Trotsky was, of course, assassinated in Mexico.

  The prime enemy of the Smurfs would be Gargamel, and his cat Asrael.  
  There can be no doubt that this duo of villan and sidekick are to 
  represent the Jews, who were persecuted under Soviet rule.

  One may attempt to challenge this theory with the claim that the mid '80s 
  introduction of the younger generation of Smurfs was an attempt at 
  Americanization.  Conversely, I submit that this addition occurred just 
  as Perestroika and Glastnost took hold in the Soviet Union, and that 
  openness was reflected in the addition of new characters.

  Luckily, the United States was able to win the Cold War, and the 
  Communist message of the Smurfs has gone by the wayside. Of particular 
  contribution in defeating this threat was the cartoon GI Joe, the real 
  American hero.

--------------[The Art of Good Trading]--------------


	I had decided recently with all the people who believe they are great 
traders, and their misconceptions on how to be a great trader, that i would
write and article on the subject. 
	I would write about how to be a truly great trader and what that 
encompasses, I'll also get quotesand bits of wisdom from some of the alltime 
greats, and some of the newerguys who are true traders. 

	Now some of you may already be confused and say, a trader is a trader, 
if your #1 then you're good. This is not entirely true for any number of reasons, 
and I will try to cover them all in this article. 
	I'm going to start with some of the misconceptions about what makes a 
good trader, and then move into what really does make a good trader. 
	Let's begin.
	A common misconception about traders is, oh well he's #1 on such and 
such sites, but that doesn't neccesarily mean shit. Anyone can be #1 on any 
given site at least 1 time if the circumstances are optimal. Now good traders 
are also not people who solely pre to get their #1 spot, I will go over pre'ing 
later in the article, as pre'ing AND trading is the perfect combo. Someone who 
trades only to 1-2 sites and dominates those sites, is not really a great trader.
He excels at 1 specific area, which does not encompass much of the scene. This 
type of person is generally a proxy trader or just using a mirror script from 1 
site to the other. The 2nd of which is cheating and they should be banned for 
claiming to be a trader. Proxying on the other hand, is part of a trader's skills. 
	Most of the great traders I traded with or that I know now, only use proxy 
when it is neccesary, like say a release going pre to a slow US site that they 
can't compete on without proxy. But if you  solely use proxy to trade, then your 
not REALLY trading, as the effort is reduced and it forces you to do less sites. 
	Proxy Trading is the closest form of trading to real trading though. 

	FXP is not true trading either, as it is simply point and click and all 
that nice stuff, and is essentially proxy as well. Usually if someone uses fxp, 
they will branch out to linfxp/pftp/nftp/riscftp, whatever the case may be. 
	You also then have your screen traders, the true form of trading, but you 
have the people who restart excessively to win, or use riscftp/nftp or some other 
form of technology to improve their performance. They are all cheaters obviously,
as the rules state, and should not be allowed to compete on sites.
	The second problem with screen traders, in the age of all the scripts, is
that screen-traders have begun making macros with MacroMagic or just their own 
telnet programs. I am not in favor of this either. 
	A few are almost a neccessity these days, if you compete on the major 
sites against the cheaters and the people of that sort. But macros that do 
essentially everything for you with just a few keystrokes,(ie. mkdir/cd on all 
sites when a new dir is made), it is getting to the point where it is just an 
idiot's script. 

**********
I stopped writing this article for awhile and now after some consideration I've 
decided to finish it up.
**********

	I had some conversations with people regarding cheaters. How it took real 
courage for someone to admit to cheating (I'm not going to use names for this 
article to avoid losing the points through bias), and therefore they should not 
be punished because they admitted to it and said no i wont do it again. 
	I find this incredibly ridiculous. An extreme comparison of this would be: 
if someone killed a dwarf and then admitted to it, should we not send him to jail? 
He still committed the crime, and this trader STILL cheated. He broke the trust 
and honor (what is left of it anyways) of being a trader and a part of this scene. 
During my conversations I also began discussing bad disking (restarting) and how 
a large number of people seem to think that it is OK to do so. What the fuck is 
that? If you're incapable of winning without timing the release properly or having 
the best resources to win, then you SHOULD lose. You shouldn't win simply because 
you can hit your mput *.zip macro a bunch of times. Accidents will happen, EVERYONE 
will restart now and again. But repeated restarters are just as bad as scripters 
and other forms of cheating. There is not enough action taken against restarters 
in my opinion. People argue that if all these methods were removed then tons of 
people would be removed from sites. My response is simple:  So?

	Why can't we remove these people and work with the real traders and start 
building a tighter-knit net community again? What are siteops afraid of? I imagine 
it has to do with their affils not backing them up in removing the people. Or they 
worry about losing that split second of speed that determines #1-#10. But that 
can be rebuilt, siteops are being narced daily, and it exists because of the 
amount of shit that is allowed on sites. Tighten up your belts siteops, bring 
down the thunder. Group leaders, kick the cheaters or teach them the error of 
their ways. Stop worrying about public opinion and whos gonna be #1 if you kick 
your best trader for cheating. Start worrying about siteops lives being ruined 
and the scene being quickly flushed down the toilet.

	But enough dramatics and downers. Let's talk about how you go about being 
a great trader. First thing is first, don't do any of the shit I mentioned above. 
Then get yourself a nice shell and learn to use screen. Make sure you get setup on 
all the good sites where the pre's go so you always have a chance on any race. 
Lock up a games/utils affil to give you some pres to boost your stats in those down 
weeks. The perfect courier will have pres (not an overabundance, but as many as 
he can get as long as he's still trading hard), screen trading with proxy ability 
and few to zero macros. 
	The ideal courier should also be willing to support sites that may not be the 
best, but are significent to their group or themselves personally, whatever the case 
may be you cannot forget the litle people. 
	
	It's not only about being number one.

	I see alot of people tossing around the "Best Courier" title to alot of 
different people. To me, that title belongs to one person and one person only: 

	Darkhosis. 

	But, to be considered one of the greats, you have to be able to RACE releases. 
A large number of these couriers today that are consistantly on weektops, aren't 
neccesarily racers, they just get pre's or trade small shit or whatever, getting 
raped on big releases. If you trade enough hours a day and move 1-3 diskers all 
day your gonna be high on a weektop. You have to have the total package guys. 
	It's just too bad that package doesn't really exist anymore, because of the 
way the scene has changed. But most people dont even have part of the package. 

You veteran traders need to spread the word and teach the gospel about trading. 
	Enough bullshit! Teach the young guys how to Trade!

--------------[The TEN Best Couriers of Alltime]--------------

  Well, this is it. This is probably going to be our most contraversial
article ever. No matter what, i don't think that it will be easy to find 
anyone who will agree 100% with our list. I guess that doesn't matter
much, since we have been a biased magazine from the start, and will remain
that way till we quit publishing.. 
  #1 was pretty damn easy. #2 through #10 were sweated, shouted, and fought
over between Lester and I. Don't agree with our selections? Come up with
your own list, and... show it to someone else, cause we don't care.. ;)

  Having said that, i'm sure that there are 2 or 3 ppl that we DID forgot, 
and someone will approach us, and say "what about so-and-so?" and we will
kick ourselves, and say, "SHIT! we forgot about whoever"... If we have
grossly omitted someone, then we apologize.. Also, keep in mind that our
list is simply the 10 best NET couriers of alltime.. We will probably do 
a BBS list at a later date, for all your newbie kids out there who want a
history lesson.. ;)

  Enough talk. Lets get to the goods...






  Top 10 Couriers of Alltime

1.  Darkhosis   
2.  Prozac      
3.  MGD
4.  HR          
5.  Shatter Star
6.  Lester
7.  Dark Druid  
8.  Fronthead   
9.  Garoto
10. Darkside    


1.) -Darkhosis- (by lester)

	Well, where to begin really, he could do it all. 

	Sure he would be labeled a cheater these days, and he did plenty of 
underhanded shit to win. But he did it all, he was able to proxy before 
anyone even knew what it was. No matter what kind of lead you had on him 
during the week, before that weektop reset, he would make sure that he had 
pulled ahead of you, either with pre's or just faking releases to get the 
extra megs. 
	I remember one time, on a Risc site I needed like 8 megs to pass someone 
and I was talking to Hosis and he says to me, hold on lemme see what I have 
in my windows directory. He finds some demo and zips it up and has me upload 
it to pull ahead. This is the kind of stuff he would do just to mess around. 
The scene wasn't so stupid back then and there were only a handful of really
good traders so what Hosis did was never a big deal, he was respected for 
his resourcefulness if nothing else. 
	I can also recall the countless headaches he gave Druidkin and the Razor 
net team. We would be ready to put out a release and all of a sudden it would 
be (Dupe Darkhosis) and we would all scurry around and try to figure out 
where the fuck he got it. Either by hacking a shell or he would go onto BBS's 
and d/l the release and get it to the net first. 
	You have to respect that. I'm supposed to limit this to like a paragraph 
and I've already run past that, but hey, the #1 guy should get a little longer 
right? The other thing about Hosis, was despite the fact that everyone knew he 
was the best, he wasn't an outrageous dick about it. 
	Sure he knew he was the best. But he had fun, and we all had fun racing 
him, even if it was frustrating. So in closing, I say *BOG* to the whole scene 
and remember Hoser.


2.) -Prozac- (by garoto)

	There are a lot of true stories floating around the net about prozac.
I never had the pleasure of trading against him, but i remember when i first
joined RTS, there was something called "prozac.txt" on the RTS bots.
(editors note: included in this issue, as 'netcurry.txt', in the NWR.zip)
	Anyways, this text bascially said something like "not to become too 
passionate about couriering", and it was written by him. I was just starting
out, and i read it, and i msged him saying "dude, i would like to be like
you", and all he said was: "good luck, don't take it too seriously"
	I have a lot of respect for him. 


3.) -mgd- (by ndetroit)

	Well, the thing about mgd, is that he has done something that not a
lot of other couriers have done, and that is to be successful in TWO separate
eras.. He used to dominate a few years ago, before he retired, and he used
to dominate QUITE well, during his AMN days. I never traded against him back 
then, but i remember reading old RCN's, and they would have the courier 
rankings, and week after week mgd would be there.. #1...
	Then the dude retired.. This year he came back to help lester with DMS,
and romped all over the NWR rankings. #1 on STH for many many weeks running,
breaking most of its records there.. 
	I can't really explain why he was so good, he just WAS good, and he
was good for 2 lifetimes worth of couriering.. thats some pretty decent work.
	A LOT of ppl hate the dude. Massive ego. Has pretty much always been
like that, i think.. But hell.. trading isn't a goddamn popularity contest.


4.) -HR- (by lester)

	The Two Lettered Couriering Machine. HR, my partner in crime. 
Many accused us of being one and the same person, and we split our sites and 
traded to certain ones only, letting the other one dominate the certain sites. 
He was consistantly #1 or #2,(depending on if Darkhosis was trading that week:)) 
and also managed to be a cornerstone in the famous 1995 DOD team. I can't say 
enough good things about him, and I guess I'm biased, but he was a solid courier. 
Using the netcom shells and screen only, he was still one of the fastest around. 
Only drawback being he didn't trade for a terribly long time as DOD got to be 
too time consuming. The easiest way to show the domination of our tag team was 
our linkup as TheForce on ScumSite. Making it to #7 alltime in the span of 2 
weeks, roughly 2.7 gigs, this in a time when 2 gigs didn't come out every week.:) 
But most of the credit goes to him in the early days, he was a trader and then 
a utils buff, I was the other way around. 


5.) -Shatter Star-  (by prozac)

Shatter-
Ah, he can't get away from being chinese. He's
always riled in DoD & RiSC for being "different",
but that doesn't mean he wasn't pheared by the 
scene. He teared up all of the major RiSC and 
major sites between 94-96, and topped the charts.
In '95, RiSC was a major force of the scene,
and Shatter was a major part of this. Always
#1 or #2 weektops for months at a time. While
he took the abuse, he left people in the dust. 


6.) -Lester-  (by mgd)

	Err, where to start? Lester has always been there to help me 
whenever I've needed him, even though his ass doubted me when I first 
tried to join AMN.
	Lester was always the dude who could get anything done, from 
trading to being a leader in two top groups on more then one occasion 
(AMN and DOD, DMS and LND, and now DMS and SiEGE). Lester was an on 
and off trader for many years, longer then I can remember, as he was 
already an AMN Leader and Founder for when i entered the scene. 
	Before that he had already accomplished being a senior in Malice. 
All of that has little to do with the fact that he has traded over 
such a long period of time against every single one of the other greatest 
traders ever, and he did well against them all. From never using macros 
up until recently (since now everyone is a macro whore), Lester always 
kicked ass while running the best groups and doing his best to keep 
everyone happy. After being around for something like 5? 6? 7?...
god knows how many years in the scene, two of his greatest accomplishments
ever were: founding and leading the first real group that could challenege 
and defeat RiSC (AMNESiA), founding NWR, and just recently he single 
handedly killed MnM  (THANK GOD THEY ARE DEAD). I could literally go on 
forever about all the things Lester has done, but I tried to keep it as 
short as possible covering what needed to be covered.
                  

7.) -Dark Druid-  (by mandrake)

	When i was asked to write a short paragraph on who i believed to 
be the alltime best courier, many names came to mind. Penstar, Shatter Star, 
Darkhosis, darkside, kang6902, colt45 (now mrsandman), mgd, garoto...... so 
many great couriers names came to mind, i wasn't sure i could choose one that 
could be "the" best. In the end i had to go with Dark Druid. 
	Sorry to everyone else mentioned above, you were/are all incredible.
My view may very well be biased though. Seeing i live in aus, i missed out on 
most of the early bbs trading that took place in the US. Though, Dark Druid, 
who was then in RiSC was still known and revered over here. First time i ever 
saw his name was on probably, Sydney's most well known and arguably the best 
board sydney has ever had: "Tombstone". After that i saw his name on a few 
boards here and there, most of which i can no longer remember. The untouchables, 
park central.... most overseas boards i only had the opportunity to call a 
couple times so it is hard to remember things vividly. 
	Though back to the point, Dark Druid was damn good in the BBS scene, and 
when in 1995 (maybe late 1994 i cant remember) i came over to the net scene he was 
here and seriously kicking arse once again. Then while i was in Empire, Vengence was
formed, and anyone who was trading at the time of the first week of vgn's opening
will know exactly how much almost every top site was seeing DDruid as no.1. 
	I remember having a conversation with a few people at the time, seeing 
this was when i has just come back to trading after my first "retirement" not 
being able to believe how unbeatable he was. I was simple replied to as "dont 
worry so much about, when ddruid wants to trade he is just too damn good". 
Only spoke to him a couple times, but from his personality, which i find to be 
quite oldscene, and his ability in both the net and old bbs scene, ddruid you 
in my eye's are the best courier this scene has ever seen. I apologize to 
Darkhosis, but i never knew all that much about you. Most of what i know is 
rumour, and i cant make a decision up on other peoples views on you.


8.) -Fronthead- (by mgd)

	Fronthead was one of those traders who came from a euro based 
groups called Rapier. He wasn't much of a trader, yet he always found 
his ways to get the megs to put up the numbers. It was like he would do 
almost anything for a "pre," and was the pretty much the scene's first 
prewhore. 
	He would do what ever it would take to get the pre, kissing as 
much as ass as possible of any given group leader or simply group 
hopping over to the release group that was performing the best. 


9.) -Garoto- (by silent joe)

	A lot of people ask: How the hell did he weektop 6-12 sites 
regularly? Even more ask: how did he get time to curry when he has 
a full time job (yes he does have full time). 
	And most of the people say: is he cheating?????
	During 1998 we have witnessed him dominate like bizzy/dragoth/
frozenwater used to do.  They all had the same skills: fast hands,
good memory, and kick ass shells ;-) 
	Garoto owned in 1998, being in dod/rzr and curry under devotion. 
As you all know he didn't get any pre as he would have had last year when  
razor/dod were  dominating. That aspect  makes  it even more amazing how 
does what he does. When bizzy owned the scene he had all the xforce pre's 
he wanted, and at that time, risc sites were the best!
	Garoto never had any pre's. (maybe some seiko) and he traded 
truthfully and he managed to get on alltimes on MANY respected sites 
such as ff/fs/et/sth/ic/e and others.
He has been doing it day after day, not for money or hw or anything else
not to be greedy saying how  he has owned the sites but FOR FUN...
Many know that he is in class/siege/devotion these days which would place 
him along elite couriers like ones i have mentioned above. With the help 
of pre u can see him in a few month being at top 3 on  repsected sites 
and it's all done in about a year 
	Many people dont get 1/3 way to his greatness  while curry much 
longer than him!


10.) -DarkSide- (by lester)

	Darkside, the brazilian stud. Somehow he mastered speaking
proper english and trading at the same time. Just before he resigned, 
back in 1995 or 96. I'm not sure. He resigned at his peak, 
you gotta give him that. 
	In fact he was a good trader, dominating the scene at his peak. 
Time's a blur, I think this was 1995 or 1996. Always ragging on me to 
ban all kinds of personal enemies of his (lester, mgd ;) ) he kept 
on threatening to ban the siteop who would not budge to his 'arguments'. 
All through his career he was risc, even though he never made it to council, 
senior, or leadership.
	I haven't spotted darkside for like forever. He must have a real 
life now, who can blame him with brazilian temperamental beauties all 
around him?
	Darkside did seem to play fair though, when it came to trading. 
His outside-trading methods werent that refined, but he could simply beat
his competition straight on.



	Well, that about wraps it up... Like we said, if you disagree, whine
  to someone else about it: we don't wanna hear about it.. There are about
  another 10 ppl that we could have just as easily included here, like
  frozenwater, jess, hurricane, nine, asmodeus, bizzy *cough*cheater*cough*,
  crueger, etc, etc... the list goes on... needless to say, that was the
  Ten Best of Alltime.. May they live forever..

=---------[ Lesters Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 

Movie Reviews

Ok well small week for movies.

The Prince of Egypt
Dreamworks Pictures
Rating: 4 out of 4 stars

Katzenberg has definately pulled it off. He wanted to show Disney who 
was the shit in animation and he did it, stealing some of the biggest 
names that Disney had and putting together this 50 million dollar epic. 
The fact that he did it so quickly is also a reflection of his talents. 
I give him alot of credit for that and I personally like Dreamworks 
Pictures as a whole. But let's talk about the movie. I don't think I 
really have to say what it's about. It is the story of Moses, from the 
book of Exodus. There is some comedy, but not a great deal. Lots of 
singing and the typical cartoon style, but the animation is far superior 
to that of your run of the mill Disney flick. Though the preview for 
Tarzan shows some nice animation on the Disney end too. It's almost 
2 hours which is quite long for a cartoon, but you don't really notice 
it, the story is obviously quite good and unless you get tired of all 
the singing, you wont be bored in it. Check it out, and if you are a 
religious person and can't get your kids hooked on the bible, this is 
an easy way to get them to learn about it.:)

-----------[ Return of the SCUM ]-----------


  The Return of an Icon in Utils Releasing. 
  SCuM has announced they will attempt a comeback, with a large number 
of the original members returning. Not all of the members and staff have 
been announced as of yet, but the leaders promise that they will break out 
with a huge title or a large number of releases at once. I believe this 
comes at a perfect time when the scene truly needs an old-fashioned utils 
group. 
  No group has been able to establish the dominance that DOD/PWA/SCUM 
had established in the past years. The talent is spread so thin and 
cluttered with webwarez and cracked shareware that no group has been able 
to efficiently dominate all major titles. It may be too much to hope that 
SCuM can change all of this, I may just be extremely optimistic, but I do 
know that it can't hurt. The scene needs to remember the great groups that 
have come and gone and been forgotten so quickly. So despite the fact that 
it brings strong competition to the utils scene which I am actively a part 
of, I welcome Scum back to the scene. Best of luck to you guys.

-----------[The Scene News]-----------

All the news thats fit to print... 
and then some...

-Ok, even i have to admit (and i'm pretty fucking impartial..BAHAHAHA)
 that DMS did ok on the sites this week. At one point 9 of the top 10  
 ppl on FS that i saw were "[DMS Rape Squad]". Now, the weird thing is 
 that DMS has only really gone through a trading resurgence ever since 
 JESS joined, which of course accounts for the rumor that we have 
 published in our rumors section.

-PREMiERE is back. Love 'em, or hate 'em, you gotta admit, the fuckers
 sure can produce.. They are both a couriers and siteops's dream. Now,
 no offence to the staff of MSV, but MSV used to be a pretty weak site..
 until they picked up PRM, that is... Remember how damn good that site
 became, very very quickly? 
 I'm not saying that i'll suck-off fusion any time soon, but...

-TRPS cards releases? bleh, oh well.. They got the release out first, 
 and it worked. Stop bitching ppl. I said the exact same thing last week, 
 and i thought i would repeat myself here... (of course, they ARE a crack-
 ing group)  <g>

-Apparently Chinablue agreed to come back to CLASS on the condition that
 mgd wasn't in the group.. Everyone thought CLS would be in trouble after
 she quit the first time, (or at least not dominate as much as they did
 during her reign), but the group managed to do pretty well in her absence.
 However, for the good of the group, mgd volunteered to step aside, if
 thats what class's leaders truly did want. They did, and he is gone.
 I'm not too sure yet wtf i think about all this... like him or hate him,
 mgd is good at what he does for the groups he is in, so... time will
 fucking tell (it always seems to) whether or not class made the right
 decision..

-On the same theme, Garoto jumped ship from the blade, and hooked up
 with class. Don't look for rzr1911 to be sending any xmas cards to garoto
 this christmas: it wasn't an amicable parting..
 No word on where mgd is headed, if anywhere....

-godbless and lethal both joined DEV.. gb cited the fact that "his 
 DMS shells were too fast, and he was bad disking everywhere", as his
 reason for leaving... BAHAHAHAH.. godbless, do i ever have the PERFECT
 fucking shell for you... <g>

-no word yet on whether or not the ORiGiN legal dept has had a chance to
 pursue their lawsuit again www.avault.com (see last week), but good luck
 to them!!

-group moves: fusion formed prm, dragoth joined prm, blackacid
 joined prm, semaj joined prm?, etc, etc. mgd quit class (or was
 he forced out?), youthx joined DMS (wtf?), moonsabre to mnm from
 ins, vylent to mnm from int, bonhz to MnM (after being caught for
 cheating on TD) and lethal and godbless both joined DEV.

-is AMBiTiON making a comeback? Would be nice to see. 

-thank-god BLACKACID removed those damn porn-window things on his
 webpage... lotta ppl were accusing the guy of "selling out".. 
 Dude has to pay his bills somehow, i guess, but... bleh, we are
 pirates, he should be STEALING his web-hosting, goddamnit!!

-www.yellow5.com/pokey owns every single one of you. go there.

-dasker/EPT is still about the worst goddamn curry i have ever
 seen.. bleh.

-i guess that shit i wrote about ndt being mad about the cocksucker
 that broke into his house did the trick... no breakins this week..
 it was either that, or the $140 in re-enforced steal bars that he 
 bought to put up over his windows... BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

-I saw a quote in a channel the other day about some Esprit dumbass
 going on about how RAY was a Top5 site... WTF??? Hello??? wake the
 fuck up, you stupid shits. EPT has about 1 good trader, and that is
 ragger, and i can't remember if he cheats or what, so... ;p

-Lester, you suck. Trade once in a while.. 

-Fluke put out a little "Note.to.the.scene.from.FLUKE" or something
 in the middle of the week. I have no idea what it said, because it
 was nuked on every single site before i had a chance to DL it.. 
 BAHAHAHAHAHA..

-RiSCISO got taken by (apparently) members of DMS/AoD... blah, takeovers
 are lame. 

-and finally:
Scientific.American.Surgery-RiSCiSO

Another quality RiSCiSO title

--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors, we all love them even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us. And these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, your name will not be included, but we
do not add rumors like that say "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion"
because we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore
there is no hard evidence of that rumor, so if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!


-Rumor has it that AoD uses some sort of trading script, a la RiSCFTP, or
 nftp.. No AoD members were available for comment at press time (press time
 was 3am PST, on a 747), but lester had earlier been quoted as saying:
 "I don't believe its true"

-Rumor has it that the reason why DMS has been doing so well is because
 JESS has promised each DMS member that weektops 1 hour of cybersex...
 it will be a busy week indeed for her. 

-Rumor has it that mandrake is set to go into fulltime trading mode soon,
 eschewing his lover GEORGE, and once again falling in love with his
 hut.fi... good choice, mandrake. 

-<mgd> rumor has it that pixel is starting a furby collection :)
