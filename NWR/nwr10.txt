I decided I should change my opening, because what's fun about repitition?
Nothing, unless it's DMS domination of course<G>. But Anyhow, this is
my report, I talk shit on everybody and anybody and any courier group,
so dont feel bad if you get ripped on 1 week, because guess what? Next
week I'll do it again if you fuck up, or I'll move to someone else, No
I'm not an asshole, I just want to lighten you guys up. So Enjoy, btw
since NWR is lagging and you all keep requesting my report, it will
now be posted every week on blackacid.pheared.com in it's own cool
section. Enjoy !

First up, Since BA will be hosting my report, I feel the need to mention
a log that has popped up on there, this union disses lester shit. Something
that tends to go on alot, but ALWAYS when I'm not around, because when
we fight and I'm there, I always win. Some people are truly pussies huh?
He seems to think everybody hates my report, and we all know he hates
BA's page, so it's a match made in heaven! More of my conspiracy to PISS
Union off ! It's all coming together now. Ok enough ranting on his lame
ass. Let's get to the good stuff

Dimension:  Well they keep coming out of the woodwork, DMS has spurted
back into first place and is dominating the weektops, MGD/Xtr/Tdp/Stix,
Mrp/Madboy/Davan/everybody. So I am much pleased. We'll see if this
continues to improve or slumps down. I intend to make it improve:) Oh ya,
and Trite sucks.:P

Risc:  No more geno, so no more Risc, cept for the pre's of course.
But lo and behold, since this is Wednesday, Morbid has exploded with
some life for them. Let's see how long he lasts

Devotion:  Snakeeyes retires and admits to using nftp, which I kinda thought
was weird, because he always restarted. But an inside source to nftp, says
that you can make it mput the file every 5 seconds until you decide to stop
it or whatever. So that would explain it huh? I hope none of the other
Dev folks are using it, I noticed the chief Nailbomb is back!#!@ He r0x,
so I am gonna keep him drunk and out of action:) And the ever present
Garoto is still there.

Ambition: Well I didn't think I'd review them too often, but here they are
because they have some activity, not much to report on though.

Millenium:  Fuck Union. End Review

That's it, rest of the groups I dont care..:)

Misc Bullshit:  Hrm, Brain says I scripttrade, because he doesn't believe
I ever used to trade..hrmm funny, I'm ahead of him on the alltime on E,
and ya I'm sure that was all pre's. But ignorance is rampant in the scene
these days, his nick is pretty ironic though, "Brain". Snakeeyes released
a text stating he was a cheater all this time using nftp and speed control
etc,etc..some ppl dont buy it, either way he restarted with or without it.
and besides, he hates me and wont give me a reason for it. So I shed no tears.
More sites going down which makes trading boring as hell. but we struggle on
Uhm, I'm gonna tell BA to make a comment area for this report, so I can
hear what you guys might want me to add. Some people said I should do
utils/games...So go ahead and tell me if you think it's worth it. I 
dont particularly care, courier groups are more fun:) So since it's
Wednesday and I want to get this out, I'll end here. next issue on Sunday 
evening, I PROMISE!
