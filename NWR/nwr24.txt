        Well damnit man, 3 weeks in a row. I don't think we can keep 
    this up too much longer. We continue the "Quote of the week" 
    segment we added last week, and we are also going to add the 
    letters to the editor stuff. I will be thinking about some other 
    new sections this week and so expect another strange area of the 
    mag next week. We would also like someone to do a game group 
    review weekly, if you feel you can do this well, let us know. 
    Cya next week

-----------[ ndetroit's sites and stats section ]-----------


    Good week this week. A lot of strong sites out there, and most
  of them making a good showing. I dunno what is going on with those
  TFA guys, but they have more traders on chart this week, so... wtf?
  Good work to them.

  Shocking news with that whole STH situation... read up more later
  in the issue about that.. ;)
  
  FS = far and away the best site in the world, making it difficult
  to find competitors for, now that STH has taken such a big hit. 
  I have grave doubts that they will get either Razor or Paradigm
  to fill the gaping hole left by CLASS, and losing MFD didn't help
  them too much either...
  oh well.. at least they still have VGN. ;>

  MP is back to being the hotshit site it was before it went down..
  thats good to see, and they will probably get either pdm or
  class soon, i imagine, now that class has that lovely EHQ position
  open...
  
  IC was good enough to be on the list this week, but i had to leave
  it off, because some bitches (not naming any names, *cough*kf*cough,
  cough*sj*cough) didn't bother to add me to the bots, so fuck if 
  I could find a weektop... :) next week tho.. 

  Darklands seems to be showing up fairly regularly these days, so
  good job to them, and new this week is MG, midgaard, dms's ehq, or
  smth... Look for MDK to join the list next week if they can pick
  up a few good affils, and get their daemon issues fixed up..

=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. 
	Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... 
heh... fuck off and die..

Lester's Biased Courier Report

Biased Report Bitchez

My second week in a row being back at the old post. Again, I didn't 
trade so I missed some things but I do have a few nuggets to toss out. 
So read up.

Dimension: Another solid week, not quite as good as last week, but still 
won where it counted. The other surprise was DMS picking up Jess, the 
longtime VGN slut who has departed from them. More information on that 
at the end. Jess was a trading force again last week, pulling #1 on a few 
key sites.

Devotion: Solid as usual, making the race closer this week than last week. 
Same crew, same story, and Jaydee is a fag.

Millennium: Well, after stating they were dead last week, I got alot 
of harrassment from their sole trader, glen. He traded as hard as he 
could this week and turned up #3. So they aren't dead, but close enough 
to it to make me happy:)

Risc: Bahahaahahahahhahahahahahahahahaha. Need I say more?

VGN: Read above review. I will also add the 2 of the 3 things VGN had 
going for them are fucked now. Jess is out, and STH is now fallen 
completely from grace. I guess my story couldn't save them. Losing Class 
and Manifest in the span of an hour.. get more info later in the mag on how 
that happened. So VGN's one shining mark of having STH as whq is more or 
less useless now. 

Other groups: are there other groups? Who gives a shit.

Well I said I would talk about Jess a little bit here. I'd like to 
continue my chronicling of the fact that Hawkeye has become a total moron 
in his days, maybe a little too much man on man action from his army days, 
I dont know. Jess wants to trade again, and so the logical reaction for a 
dead group would be: GREAT. Jess may be a slut, but she can trade pretty 
damn good. But what does VGN's fearless leader do? Laugh at her and blow 
her off. What does Ddruid do when she asks for a shell? Blows her off 
as well. Some respect for the loyalty she has shown, so you can really 
hardly blame her for quitting. I asked her for a quote, check it out:

<Lester> want to give me a few quotes?
<jess0r> no!
<jess0r> :)
<Lester> haha
<Lester> bitch
<jess0r> u are :)

So, as you can see, she's plenty upset..:P
I will also show you a little more of the log here as we kept talking

<jess0r> Damn you make me so hot, I can barely even trade anymore. I'm 
always thinking about you.

And it just goes on and on from there.

Enjoy the magazine babies.

=---------[ Lester's Movie Review Section ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 



Well boys, I was even busier this weekend, seeing 3 films in 2 days, 
all 3 were quality films and so I'll go over them for ya.

American History X
New Line Pictures
Starring: Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, Beverly D'angelo
Rating: 4 Stars / Out of 4)

Well this is probably the best film I've ever seen where the director 
didn't even want his name put on it. There's been numerous articles 
and interviews with Tony Kaye on his feelings that the movie was raped 
by Norton and New Line Pictures. They deny doing any more editing than 
normal, but none the less, Kaye wants nothing to do with his own film. 
Which is a sad thing, American History is the best film of 1998 as of 
yet, the second oscar caliber film of this year, the only other being 
Saving Private Ryan. I consider this film better than SPR though, the 
performance that Norton gives as the lead character is amazing, the 
emotions that he delivers with just the look in his eyes is enough to 
give you chills. I really dont wish to give away much of the movie, but 
Norton proves for the third time that he is a truly gifted actor, debuting 
in Primal Fear with an amazing performance, and then in People Vs. Larry 
Flint he was once again very good. Neither performance compares to this 
one though, I was highly impressed. The rest of the cast is pretty good 
as well, Furlong plays Norton's younger brother who grows up idolizing 
big bro. The movie is disturbing in the sense that you are faced with 
the fact that there truly are people that ignorant. But we all faced that 
fact last week with Sitez's log. :)
If we had to give out awards right now I'd have to give this movie Best 
Picture, so I tell you all to check it out! Also look for Sitez playing 
the character "Seth"!

*PICK OF THE WEEK^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



Celebrity
Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Charlize Theron, Kenneth Branagh, and a 
bunch of other people you will recognize. 
Rating: 3 stars / out of 4

I am not usually a big fan of Woody Allen films, the whole black and 
white and his terribly annoying speech. Well this film is also in B&W, 
but it does not have Woody in it at all, which was surprising. They do 
make Kenneth Branagh's character a woody allen clone in the way he speaks, 
which was one of the few things that bothered me. The movie is about 
celebrities and the different lives that they lead, it centers around 
Branagh's character, a strugglin travel magazine writer who wants to get 
someone to act in his screenplay, and his ex-wife a neurotic woman who's
life gets turned around. Most of the big names have small parts in the film, 
just appearing to play for 15-20 minutes at the most. One of my friends was 
telling me that he had to see this movie, because all of Woody's movies are generally about oral sex, and this movie being no different, there are a few 
oral sex based scenes. If you like Woody Allen films, you'll like this one, 
and even if you don't really like him, like myself. You may still enjoy this 
film, it's got comedy, and alot of big names in there. Also, it is not overly 
long at a mere 2 hours and 10 minutes, which is a change of pace for the way 
movies are going these days. So anyways, check it out.

-----------------------------

Enemy of the State
Touchstone Pictures
Starring: Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight
Rating: 3 and 1/2 stars / out of 4)

Well, Mr. Smith is back again with another bigtime movie. Little 
bit different role for him, not battling aliens, but still a role 
that fits him. Directed by Tony Scott and produced by Jerry 
Bruckheimer, with Smith in the lead role, you pretty much have 
yourself a money making film. Bruckheimer has produced some of the 
biggest movies of all time, and consistantly does it every year, 
last year it was Armageddon. Anyways, the movie is about a lawyer 
who has a videotape of a congressman being murdered handed to him 
unknowningly, and the murderers proceed to hunt him down and try to 
ruin his life to get the tape. Hackman plays the only one he can trust 
and they play off of each other quite well in this movie. Jon Voight 
plays his typical anal retentive bad guy, and he does it as well as 
always, a few highlights that most people may not care about. Jason 
Lee, Seth Green and Jamie Kennedy are all in this movie. Jason Lee of 
the Kevin Smith films, Mallrats & Chasing Amy. Seth Green from hundreds 
of films but most recently playing "Oz" in Buffy the Vampire Slayer 
series. Jamie Kennedy, the best character in the Scream films, 
playing Randy the video store geek. All are fun to watch. The movie 
is typically what you would expect, lots of action, plenty of Will 
Smith jokes, the usual bit. But it doesn't come across as the same 
old shit. The story doesn't develop too predictably, and there's
plenty of high tech devices for us computer freaks to be impressed with. 
For the general movie going audience, this is the film to see this week. 
If you want to see the best film, then AHX is the best one, but Enemy 
of the State is still a very good movie. Enjoy folks, I need to sleep:)

--------------[STH Loses Its Affils]--------------



    Well, well, well.. What a week it was for the scene's two best sites.
  Firesite and Stairway to Heaven, long regarded as the scene's #1 and #2
  site (depending on who you talk to!) had one hell of a weekend.. ;)

  Lets start at the start... namely: mgd.

  It all started a few weeks ago, when all siteop privilages were taken
  away by the STH staff, in the hopes of "tightening things up"..
  Mgd happened to have useradd, etc privilages, as he was a member of 
  class, and longtime supporter of STH... 
  He wasn't too happy about his privs being revoked... 
  Mgd's tagline on STH and other sites the past few weeks:
  200- | 09 mgd       FiRESiTE=The ONLY real site       0   116.207 megs
  
  Needless to say, this didn't sit too well with the STH siteops, especially
  considering STH was class..

  So they removed him.. 

  Probably not the best idea.. Not only was mgd a high-ranking member
  of their games affil (cls), but he was also ranked somewhere on their
  alltime list.. 

  All hell broke loose. 

  And.. (there has been a lot of dispute over this) Class dropped STH..
  (not, it WASNT the other way around)..
  Class stood by their member, and lost an affiliation with the #1/2 site
  in the world for him..

  What happened next is perhaps not as well known in the scene, but what 
  it amounts to is those wacky guys at mfd dropping sth, "just so they could 
  piss gimi and hawkeye off".... bahahaha... hey, i didn't say it... ;)

  FS picked up MFD, on the justification that MFD released both larger
  and better quality releases... Fallen left FS shortly thereafter, 
  and is still on the lookout for a new WHQ..

  My spin on the situation:

	Love him or hate him (and there are a lot out there who do!), what
  mgd did amounts to siteop and group manoevering GENIUS. By getting CLASS
  to drop STH, he not only improved CLASS's position (freed to take MP, or
  one of the other promising EUROs), but he also did FS a HUGE favor, by
  seeing to it that CLS now only has one euro site that they can pre to..
  (for now)...
  	The holiday season is coming up, and having a games group becomes
  critical for both the desireability and credibility of your site, during
  the BUSY BUSY weeks ahead..

  	STH lost out bigtime, as they are unlikely to pick up PDM (not a lot
  of love between the two), or razor (already have more than enough HQs).
  	What will likely end up happening is that FALLEN will go to STH,
  effectively making it so that they and MFD swapped sites... Which is better
  is a matter of opinion, but you can bet that mgd isn't a real popular guy
  in #g???? right now..  

  	If i were STH, i would get moving now, to try to find SOME affils
  to replace my lost gems.. (siege alone ain't gonna cut it).. Current 
  reports are that ORiGiN is lukewarm at best to the prospect, and one
  member is quoted as saying "I will NEVER let STH be ogn WHQ.."
  Hrmm... 

  	If i were mgd, i'd watch my back.. There are an aweful lot of pissed
  off ppl right now who are out for his blood... <g>

-----------[The Scene News]-----------

All the news thats fit to print... 
and then some...

-Well, well, well... what can i say? Did i call it, or what?
 Last week, i believe i said something all the lines of "Firesite
 is the best site in the world"... or smth.. This week.. well,
 lets just say this: where the fuck else is CLASS going to pre
 all those big fatty fat XMAS releases now?? 

-Mpower is doing DAMN good.. dms whq soon? cls ehq soon? you'll
 find out here first!!

-group moves: dthangel to mnm, hazzy quits ent, cedric to mnm, 
 jess to dms, (nice pickup, btw), stigma quit mnm, and weeze
 joined vgn.. 

-Apparently Stigma quit MnM over some huge fight, in which
 he called dee a "homo", or "loser" or smth like that.. this
 pissed off weeze, who MnM were recruiting, and caused MnM
 to take a vote on whether or not to kick stigma for his
 disrepectful comments... All of this is 2nd-hand info tho, 
 so fuck me if i am wrong.. and really.. who the fuck cares?  ;p

-Bleh.. i did NOT say that QSR = Quasar last week.. ndetroit
 wasn't looking wtf he was doing, and pasted that shit wrong..
 FOR THE RECORD, QSR = Quicksilver, and are still a bunch of
 wankers for not kicking darkiex... wake the fuck up, you homo's,
 or read the goddamn log we have this week..

-REBELS: i'm sure you are a good group of ppl, and you put out
 some nice stuff, but PLEASE, do the fucking scene a favor, and
 LEARN HOW TO GODDAMN PRE@!@^*#(&*!^!
 12 mins/disk is NOT cool... it took you 2 hours to do a 15 disk
 release!!! make friends with some nice curry group, and let them
 do it for you, or smth.. for GOD'S SAKES.

-darkiex = kicked from mdk, good work mdk staff..

--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors, we all love them even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us. And these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, your name will not be included, but we
do not add rumors like that say "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion"
because we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore
there is no hard evidence of that rumor, so if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!


-Rumor has it that MnM is not dead?!?! wtf?? yes they are!!

-Rumor has it that pdm is going to MDK, cls is going to MP, 
 and rzr is going to pick up another 15 HQ's this week.. ;p

-Rumor has it that MP will soon be DMS WHQ, now that jess has
 joined up with them.. DMS currently only has MG, TV, and TMS..
 none are of world hq caliber quality..

-Rumor has it that mandrake and george have LEFT australia, 
 and are on their way to LAS VEGAS this week, to ELOPE together
 Mandrake: for the good of the scene, DON'T DO IT!!

-Rumor has it that [grind] has a 3 inch penis!!! (i guess its
 not really *that* shocking)

-Rumor has it that Kruzin is still a big fat cheater, and if you
 haven't kicked him off your site yet... wtf are you waiting for??

=-------------------------------------=--------------------------------------=


Well friends.. Thats about it. If you've read this far, we sincerly thank you.
We like to know this thing gets read, so if you get the time, drop one of us
