                                       -Lester [Co-Editor/Head Writer]


    Hey guys... i'm back in the hot seat this week... The rest of the staff
    decided to release without me last week.. thats cool.. i've been mad
    idle, and i can't expect them to do all that work for nothing... so
    if ya didn't like last week's issue, then TOO BAD... don't read it,
    or smth.. ;)

    Big hats off to sketch and tech, and a combination thereof... the stats 
    look better than they ever have, and its nice to see a return of the group
    stats, after a 40 issue nwr absence... hehe... they put a lot of hard work
    into it, and it shows.. msg them and thank them this week.. ;)

    Back by popular demand (a repeat tho) is jesspic4.jpg!

    We got some SERIOUS shit this week.. probably one of the biggest
    scoops ever: an internal memo from EA about the tightening up of their
    security, and how they are planning, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FBI, AN ALL-NEW
    SERIES OF BUSTS..

    Let me say that again.. EA is working with the FBI on another set of busts,
    and they got a LOT of info... And they know that we know that they know that
    we got insiders out their ass... so.... .;D

    May we live in interesting times..

    As many of you already know, Lester, my co-editor is sort of... well... 
    bordering on retirement.. it would be impossible to list the innumerable
    things that he has done for and with the scene, so i won't... he is 
    still sort of semi-active anyway... 
    If you see him on IRC tho, go thank him for everything he has done for the
    scene.. or.. if you hate, tell him to fuck off and rot in hell..  ;D

    On a little heavier note, nitro died this week. He was in a high-speed car
    crash, died on impact. Dthangel will be attending the funeral, and with him
    go the thoughts and prayers on many members of 'the scene'... .. good luck
    nitro, wherever ya are.


    I know i say it every week, but it seems to have a little more meaning now..
    Have a safe week, kids.....

    Hi!... a lot of shit happened since i been gone.. lets get to it!
    
    Afaik, TO? is gone for good.. sadly... ditto for ?C, tho the siteops
    are potentially looking for a phat euro link for it..
    ?OG picked up HLM, becoming its EHQ..
    ?DR L??e got a Rebels affils, becoming their EHQ..

    C?m?l?t is back, an oldschool ftp4all site... yay!

    ?G is also back this week, talk to a siteop for details..

    Ughh.. these question marks are annoying.. but you will be thanking me
    when your favorite siteop is not getting gang-raped in some mississippi
    prison.. ;p

    Now that mgd has quit AMN, will he become DEV, and make the whole 
    ?S staff DEV? .... who knows.. stay tuned! ;p

    ?TH = fastest damn site in the world.. thats not really a shock, but..
    get out your proxy skillz, kiddies!
    
    
    I guess thats about it.. feel free to take wild guesses about
  what the "?"'s are supposed to be... 
    My top 5 for this week are still ?S, ST?, ?T, ?E?, and ?H..
  
    Siteops!! send your weektops to: nwr@netmonkey.org, or give them to
  _tech_... Thanks to all those that support us every week... ;)

 
          The Top Six US sites for this week are:

                 ----------------------------------------
                         x2.5x  T? R?O 
                         x2.0x  D?T C?D R?

*** - We Missed the weektop from SB?. So we only have 5 sites now, but SB?

          If you can't guess what sites are what, chances are you
          Aren't on them. If you got ranked then you know what the

=---------[Alltime Stats]----------=

*** Alltime Stats from Since NWR #1 to NWR #55
    Around April 1998 - July 1999

                 
We are gonna do an alltime stats from now on,  which will be shown on here at
every 5 issues (no need to show one at every issue). Since this is issue #55,
here is  the first one.  Next one will  be shown on issue #60,  and so on. We
used all issues we could get,  except the missing ones (#8-#11)  and the ones
were we hadnt done the stats.  The respective groups for each courier will be
added based on today's situation. Most of those couriers were on other groups
when they ranked on the older issues,  but we will be showing the groups they
are in right now.  In a few months,  we will start to rank the group alltimes
and US's alltime stats as well, since they had just started to be done around
one week ago..  So here goes the top55  alltime couriers  of around 1 year :]

courier report. Guest's are allowed to do the report in any style/format
that they want, with whatever ratings and graphics system that they deem
applicable.
Guests wishing to apply for the position should be an active trader in
one of the scene's top groups.. (ie: someone who knows wtf they are 
talking about... .. heh.. although, that never stopped lester from 
writing!!)  <g>

                                                    -editors


This week's special guest: Bizzy Bone of AMNESiA... !

=------------=

Greetings fellow earthlings, well that... and Caserd.  Your homie bizzybone
delivering you all the hits, misses, wanks, and pisses this week - so hold
on to your tighty whities and check out the brighty highlighties! :)


AMNESiA: SiNs and Alex out kicking some serious ass this week, skyrocketing 
         on many weektops enabling AMN to place #1 on groupweek.  The
         question remains, is it just a one man show?  Thus far it may seem 
         so, but I have heard from many sources (i'm a really cool guy :)) 
         that AMN support will really pick up... 

Overall Opinion: Excellent work, but more guys working would help :)

pickups: -

losses : mgd to AOD, alex to RC.


ViCE: ViCE remains to pretty much dominate sites, with many guys showing
      constant dedication.  mrpumpkin, redman, & nailz, showed up on many 
      weektops, placing ViCE #2 on the groupweek.  I have heard mrpumpkin maybe 
      taking a deserving break, lets see how the troops manage to march on by 
      without this big goof :)  maybe redman will find a cockroach in his
      underwear highering his self-esteem to pre!
      
      (cablegod & zeus21, next time you do webcam together - be sure to
      leave a warning for those with weak stomachs..) :)

Overall Opinion: Great job guys, solid work. Keep it up...

pickups : some male stripper recruited by cablegod...
 
losses  : -   


AOD: Well, it's gotta be the drugs if nothing else - half these guys seem
     like they have passed out leaving Faith alone to weektop sites.  I also
     saw Freakshow preing a little, helping there #3 on the groupweek.  I have
     heard some of these guys are away on vacation, lets hope they come back
     and give these guys a helping hand. :)

Overall Opinion: Good job this week, but potential is far greater :)

pickups : mgd

losses  : -  


DEVOTiON: Well, activity is definitely lacking here.  Insanity showing up on
          some weektops, as for Garoto and tc, but they seem to be going
          through a slump at the moment.  Godbless is getting geared up to
          trade again, maybe this will help the squad a whole lot.  One can
          never count this group out though, they have many experienced
          traders, and even more experienced pre'ers. <G> hi DiZZiDeNT!

Overall Opinion: Not so hot, hopefully things will improve..

pickups : -

losses  : -


RiSC: A few guys here and there, Pseud0's efforts most definitely worth
      mentioning.  Some serious work has to be done before RiSC can claim the
      title of a worthy contender.

Overall Opinion: Not good at all.  Lets step it up guys!

pickups : -

losses  : cubanpete, for RTS.


Thunder: RZ3 doing well on a couple of sites here and there, pulling in some
         good numbers for THD.  They seem to be very good at what they're out
         to do, they seem quiet, but they seem to work hard...

Overall Opinion: Decent.

pickups : - 
         
losses  : -


TFA: Slick kicking some major ass.  It seems the rest of the squad is idle
     here, hopefully things will pick up for them...

Overall Opinion: Downer ;( Get more guys going here...

pickups : -

losses  : -


Espirit: Well, not too many guys moving much here... they showed up on the gpwk
         is it :)  A little more work is needed to compete with the others...
         (Hi Fro_Cold!  Dhal 4 Life!) :)

Overall Opinion: Downer - lets get going...

pickups : -

losses  : -


Equality: Equality always manages to pull through on their sites as always.   
          Hopefully more guys will show up soon on others though :) 

Overall Opinion: Good job on Headquarters...

pickups : -

losses  : -


DSC: Sax did a job worth recognition, good work there... A decent week
     for this us trading squad :)

Overall Opinion: Decent Week...

pickups : -

THE BLITZ REPORT FOR THE WEEK OF 07/26/99 - 08/01/99
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Looks like I woke up ndetroit, and he's doing the full NWR this week. Good thing 
too, because I'm so far in to Jagged Alliance that I really haven't payed much 
attention this week. Luckily only two games got released, and the first is just 
a "final" of a beta from last week and the second is a game I worked on. So I 
didn't even have to do any research =). We'll do a full review of Jagged Alliance 2 
this week because it's really the only thing I did.

 God dammit DVN, you did a beta =(. Well this one looks final, as PDM states in 
their NFO, this is a USA game and probably the final. PDM did a bunch of patches 
too. Finally a generic crack for Warzone (I think every group had one by now there 
were so many patches). No points for the warzone patch, but a half point for the 
generic.

 Origin won the race cracking Shadowman against Razor. Not a bad looking game, but 
when you come down to it, it's just a Lara Croft clone, and everyone is tired of 
Tomb Raider anyway. Above average, and a major title so four points. Nice trainer 
from OGN on Darkstone, rubs out the DVN version.

Idle this week


 
 My apologies to the rest of Razor for forgetting Arcade Pool 2 earlier this month. 
Ice brought this to my attention (albiet while claiming I "forgot" it because OGN won 
the title). I checked around and seems RZR stuck on most sites including PDM/CLS WHQ's. 
I guess Razor wins, but despite Ice saying it's a major, I think it's just a shitty pool 
game.



 Now for a little analysis and strategy for Jagged Alliance 2. I've spent most of my free 
time these past 2 weeks playing this little gem, and it's really an outstanding game. I 
haven't gotten this much play out of a game since Baseball Mogul '99. Now I don't know how 
ringing an endorsement this is for the game, seeing as how BB Mogul seems to be only a 
classic for me, but I think everyone should pick up this game. 
 I experimented with a few strategies off the start, and the mass recruiting of low-level 
mercs was quickly discarded. Getting mercs with explosives and mechanical isn't really 
that high a priority off the start I found. You don't have use for it for at least the 
first week or two. What you do need is medical. I found most of the doctors in the game 
to have several weaknesses, so I created my own merc as a medic (50 medical), with 0 
is explosive and mechanical to jack up the other skills. Everything else was set to 
70 or 80. That gave me a good leader with a good starting gun (MPSK). Using the 
personality analysis a few times I managed to get one with stealth (starting your 
merc with a silencer), and ambidextrous (there are some kick ass guns you can use 
later on for dual-weapon guys). 
 To this starting merc, I added Lynx on a week contract. Lynx pretty well clears the 
first 5 areas all on his own. His long-range rifle picks off the sidearm wielding 
grunts one by one. I didn't even use another merc for the first whole 2 days. The other 
merc I started with was Trevor. Now I said you didn't need explosives or mechanical 
off the bat, but one thing you DO need is lockpicking skill. He has this as well as a 
good marksmanship and wisdom. High wisdom, explosives, and mechanical/lockpicking make 
him perfect for opening doors and chests without setting off traps. With the high-priced 
Lynx on a week's contract, you will have to pay his salary daily, but his skills more 
than make up for this penalty.
 On the first day, clear the first area and follow Fatima over to the second. Once 
there, recruit the useless Ira anyway. We'll get her something to do. Move your mercs 
directly to the mine in the first town. Don't bother fighting through the airport and 
middle section of the town before you secure the mine. One space to the west of the 
mine, you will find the helecopter pilot. Take him along with you, but leave him with 
your other 2 mercs while Lynx single-handedly picks off the bad guys. After fighting 
your way through the town (make sure to receruit the mine and talk to the priest on 
your way), set yourself up with the chopper pilot in the airport. Set Ira to heal 
your guys while they rest. After they are healed, move her back down to the mine and 
start training militia. Your other three mercs should move over to knock out the SAM 
site east of the first town. 
 Once you've knocked out the SAM, rest up a bit and then take your mercs to take the 
second-easiest town in the northwest. On your way, pick up dimitri at the rebel 
hideout and explore the abhandoned mine. The 30 grand there is more than enough to 
put Trevor on a weekly contract. Once you clear the mine and other sector of the 
northwest town, escort the two vacationers back to the airport. Keep Dimitri there 
training militia. Once the vacationers are back in the airport, they will send you 
some guns which you can use with your two-handed merc leader. The third town you 
should go after is the one in the southeast. It's there where you will find the 
chalice to return to the northwest town.

 That's all for this week, maybe next week I'll have more scene bullshit and less 
on the game I've been wasting time on.

 Bud's Biased Utils Report #29
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Two weeks in a row on time! That has to be some sort of record for me...
 and for NWR now that I think of it. Of course I'm assuming as I write this
 that NWR was on time and you're reading this when you're supposed to be.
 Whatever.

 This weeks interesting story was a continuation of last weeks anticipated
 release, 3DSMAX v3 - if you recall, it was originally released by SGM.
 Which was then nuked as a beta... well word has it the SGM release came
 from Harvest, who weren't sure if they had a beta or a final... then we
 had DOD release a final, which was indeed final from all accounts, except
 it needed a fix, graciouslly provided by Harvest. Remember how I congratulated
 them on the class they showed in releasing the fix with no ego to match?
 Well I may have to take it back...

 This week Harvest decided to release 3DSMAX itself. The version is identical
 to DOD's, except Harvest included the setup routine while DOD simply
 gave you the program. Now we have both sides bickering over which is better...
 here's my problem. Harvest went to the trouble of FIXING the DOD release. Which
 means it works, and I've seen plenty of happy users with the DOD copy. So what
 exactly was the point of Harvest re-releasing... hrmm... well one of the
 rumors floating about is that all 3 release were identical, INCLUDING the SGM...
 and despite claims to the contraty, the SGM does indeed work, which would
 make IT the legit release =) Harvest doing damage control, pissed over the
 fact that they let 3DSMAX 3 slip through their fingers? Or are the installation
 options really that important? (I won't get into the addon debate here, this
 is long enough as it is...). In the end the users will decide I guess... ho-hum...
 all this huffing and puffing between groups... oh yes and CORPiSO got nailed for
 using DOD's reg info in it's ISO release... what a mess. And it only hurts the users,
 some of whom will be downloading what is basically the same shit three times over.

 Blah... on wit zee show.
  
 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 07/27/99 to 08/02/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.


 Groups: (In no particular order)

 Materialise.Magics.Communicator.v1.0-PWA
 Statistics.Server.ISP.v5.0.for.NT-PWA

 Lotus.Domino.5.01.Solaris.Intel-PWA
 Geomagic.Decimater.v1.02-PWA

 PWA slowed a bit this week compared to the outpouring of last,
 but still managed some steady releasing of decent titles. Nothing
 incredible, Statistics Server 5, Cimagraphi, and Enterprise Monitor
 are the highlights. The releases (of pretty much every group this week)
 were left in relative obscurity by all the crap and politics (one and
 the same) going on. Oh and no points for the Solaris, although it's a good
 release and Lotus has been doing well with that platform.

 "HASP protects your software from piracy" - too bad they didn't protect
 themselves. Well we all know HASP, (dongle protection scheme, and if you
 still don't know I'm not getting into it any further), and while it may 
 seem odd to release a protection scheme designed to work against us, 
 hey - Know thy enemy. Words to live by. That and don't keep old logs...
 and don't sell copies of software that can be traced back to you...
 gee I'm just full of wisdom today.

 Aside from the HASP packs we see the Migration pack for PWA's
 Architectural Desktop 2 release, as well as the Corporate Dev. copy
 of SQL 7 from M$, and an early look at SolidWorks 99 for the 9x
 platform. Not bad, not great, average week from those working at
 the Corporation.

 Releases: 

 ZAXWERKS_INVIGORATOR_V2.0_FOR_MAYA_2.0_NT_REPACK-XFORCE

 I think I missed a Linux release... doesn't matter, I'm still
 not scoring non-win apps for the time being. As for Invigorator,
 once you get past the repack problem, it's a decent release, and has been
 used in TV shows such as Sienfeld (not that there's anything wrong with that).
 Looks to be a nice 3D addon for Maya from what I've seen... too bad that's
 all we saw from XF for the week.

 A mixed week from SHOCK, and their busiest one of late. Standouts
 include the new crack for EnCase (at 600KB it's worth to download to
 see what you thought you deleted), and Embarcadero's ER/Studio 3.5
 final. They also beat FCN on the first InfoPower update in a month
 (Hi Delphic!). They also released a working version of Acid Style, 
 however it seems the loaders used to bypass program protection don't
 work too well in NT, so while 9x users are fine, NT users should
 avoid it and wait for a possible fix.

 it's Veritas Backup Exec from now on I guess. Nice welcome to

 KPT Equalizer, as well as the newest edition of Eudora Pro (which I'm really 
 debating on switching to). Some other middle of the road stuff, all in all a
 steady week and good showing from PNC.

 accused of Serial theft, although I don't even know by who... just
 showed up as the nuking reason. Hate to see that from Versus, who I 
 normally really like. Nothing special here in the other titles but
 they are active again at least.

 Jeez guys, stop releasing so much, you're taking up half my bloody report! <g>.
 FCN dominated their niche and got a few other titles out as well. A working
 solution for SoftICE 4 Suite (we REALLY need to get rid of fake label groups
 such as Kamel), Wise Solution's Install Manager 7.04, and QuickPak from
 Crescent. Lots of other goodies in there as well this week. Great work guys,
 keep it up (I sound like a little league coach here, don't I? :P).

 Final note, although Eon Studio 2.5 has been released before, some updates
 have been added since it moved over to a new development team, thus it's
 not really a dupe.

 Well Harvest has had a decent first month of existance, but I can't agree with
 the shit that went down this week. First, what should have been kept a private matter
 between CORPiSO and DOD was thrust into the public spotlight thanks in part to
 Harvest members. Secondly, after FIXING the DOD release of 3DSMAX, Harvest goes ahead
 and re-releases it. Guys, YOU FIXED IT - obviosuly at the time you were happy
 with the DOD copies performance, and it was working with your fix - so changing
 the story now to say "DOD's doesn't do such and such" doesn't look too great.
 From the users I've spoken to and overheard, DOD's works fine, despite questionable
 packing, the need for a fix, and the huge addon... so anyways, Harvest got points
 for the fix, DOD for the final, and it ends there. If a user decides he wants the
 Harvest copy, great, but in the end it's a dupe.

 Aside from that it's mostly plugins this week, and Maya Fusion.

                       <Caserd> ?!?!?!
                       <[STiX]> NO!

                       <Caserd> WHY?
                       <Caserd> ITS PHAT

 I was sort of suprised to see FCN won this week, but the more I think about
 it the more sense it makes... they did their job and released, with good
 consistancy, and while in this case the amount did help, there were some
 nice titles. Special mention to PWA for a great month (#1 for July in my
 eyes) and DOD for Talkworks.

 This Monday deadline is really fucking things up for me... looks like
 I'll be back to finishing the week on Saturday 12PM EST... or maybe Sunday,
 who knows... fuck it's annoying. I was just getting comfortable with the
 Tuesday deadline.

 I removed 2KAD... simply no activity, and when there is activity is minor
 versions and betas... they have their place but since I'm trying to lighten
 the load... PRM could be next as they've been at a virtual standstill for
 quite some time.

 This heat is keeping me indoors... so with luck I'll be on time next
 week as well!

   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 



No Lester this week... just those wacko right-wing fundamentalists back for

The Blair Witch Project (1999), (R)
          CAP Score: 49
  CAP Influence Density: 6.81 

SUMMARY / COMMENTARY:

*The Blair Witch Project* (R) -- Believe it or not, more of the most foul word 
than South Park!

That this story is based on a true story is an illusion. The Blair Witch is supposed 
to be a legend, but the rest of the story is fabricated.

*The Blair Witch Project* was an empty movie. There was nothing there except attempts 
at fright. It was bare of any need for intelligence. Void of any special effects, this 
film relied on our supposed innate fear of the unseen to project its impact. Devices
such as crudely made forms from sticks, a bloody piece of flesh wrapped up in a remnant 
of the shirt of a missing cohort, and evidence of a satanic ritual site were among the 
effects. A long sequence of the portrayal of stark terror and stories of human mutilation 
and abduction murders of children were other devices to build the horror face of the move.

One hundred thirty eight uses of the most foul of the foul words. *The Blair Witch Project* 
actually beat *South Park:BLU* in use of the most foul of the foul words. Also were 71 
uses of other three/four letter foul words PLUS 17 uses of God's name in vain, 6 of which 
were with the foul letter expletive and 3 of which were vain use of the name of our Savior. 
All other ignominy were paled by such a flip-off attitude. Yet one more excuse to lower 
standards of acceptance I suppose.

Of most significance in violation of righteousness was a single sentence by one of the 
trio. I will not describe it, abbreviate it, or otherwise explain it to you other than 
saying it was an extremely vulgar expression of hate of God.

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.

Ryche's Really Biased VCD Group Report #19

[19:09] <dan> we have designed the botnet
[19:09] <dan> to lose ops once a day at a certain hour
[19:09] <dan> its zeus's expert tcl codeing


Another week, and another report. Two in a row this time? NWR on time this time? 
The world just surely be coming to an end. No disturbing trends this week, no 
huge errors in judgement (couple of small ones though), and quite a few VCD's 
worth watching. Here we go race fans..


Releases for the week of July 27th, 1999 to August 2nd, 1999

072799 - The Mummy - Screener - VCD-Europe
072899 - Simply Irresistible - Screener - VCD-Europe
072899 - Lake Placid - Telesync - VCD-Europe
072999 - The Out of Towners - Screener - VCD-Europe
[NUKED] - Who Am I - Screener - TWCiSO
073099 - Inspector Gadget - Telesync - VCD-Europe
073199 - Deep Blue Sea - Telesync - IGN
073199 - South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut - Telesync - TWCiSO

I mighta missed one or two, I was real busy this week, so die and stuff I missed your
release.


TWCiSO

Making great strides.. well sorta. Who Am I is the Jackie Chan Crapumentary, its on video
by the way. South Park, a good TS of it to make up for VCD-Europes Cam. Probably TWCiSO's
best release yet.

Total - 2 points


IGN

Theyre back with a vengance. Not. This looks like a home encoded bootleg of Deep Blue Sea.
Only way they could win on it I guess. I would expect to see an Improved Telesync of it
if I was betting. The picture is good, the sound isn't that great though. You can tell it
was recorded with a microphone. Most sites did keep this one though.

Total - 1 Point


VCD-Europe

A very nice week from VCD-Eu. The Mummy Screener would be my standout movie of the week.
Simply Irresistible has Sarah Michelle Gellar, so it gets bonus points. The Out of Towners
sucks and so does Inspector Gadget, but it's new so it's good for VCD. The other nice
release they had was the Lake Placid Telesync which improves over thier crappy cam that
they released before. Killer aligator, killer mummy, killer chick, and gay movie made from
a gay cartoon.

Total - 4 Points.


For the week, the award goes to VCD-Europe for some choice releases. TWCiSO has a good
release in South Park, and IGN tries to release a semi-ok Deep Blue Sea on the viewing
public.


                                          I cant wait for the Captain Planet movie..

Now are you scared? 



We are.

-----------[The Scene News]-----------

All the news thats fit to print... 
and then some...

-First off, I personally have to give shout outs to nitro.. Former DMS member, 
 former leader of gcrack, former member of... well.. a lot of good groups..
 the brotha is gonna be missed...

 And i also gotta say, that what dthangel is doing with gcrack is one of the
 classiest things i've ever seen in a long time. I remember the old gcrack
 days, when those 2 used to fight like cats and dogs.. in the end, they formed
 one of the closest partnerships in the scene..
  
 Take care..

-While we are at it... we didn't really get a chance to say goodbye to acidapple,
 who recently retired from the scene. We will be interviewing him about retired
 life in a future issue, because it has been one of our most requested interviews
 ever.. ;)
 Good luck buddy, wherever you are!

-Some sites you can check out: 
 ppgr.webjump.com    : Prozac's page!!!! a lot of good gear... many of today's
                       popular reports, and an NWR archive that is practically
                       0 second.. ;)
 www.socalsys.com    : need shells, bounces, vhosts, web space?... these dudes
                       are scene-friendly, and got some decent deals... only
                       reason why i mention is cause the dude was fat enough
                       to hook up nd up with some action... *cough*... HAHAHAH!


-group moves: aeiou(andsometimes'y') left AMN for ind, psychic_a was kicked from
 amn for being a moron, mgd was traded to aod for a player to be named later, 
 alex left amn for RC, archive joined amn, stormwatch to amn, mgd to corp, like,
 all of mnm to rts, 

-Yes.. its true, millenium has finally called it quits. But you gotta respect the
 fact that the leadership was willing to put it all behind them, and do what was
 right for the group. MnM used to be (dare i say it?) a major force in the scene,
 competing right alongside RiSC/DEV/EMP/APOC, and then later in some famous battles
 with DMS.. but throughout it all, the group survived, and at times flourished..
 A large majority of the scene's best traders passed through the mnm doors at some
 point or another..  good luck to the group in the future..

-mossyoak is trading again.. wtf??

-apparently psychic_a was kicked from amnesia cause "he had a bad attitude".. heh..
 nice that a group stepped up and did the right thing.. we don't need no bitches
 here... but if i recall correctly.. wasn't he already kicked from DEV? ;p
 Bah.. maybe he wasn't.. my memory is going.. too much pot.. ;/

-in a bit of a shocker, mgd left amn for aod recently (or is it dev?).. his reasons
 are his own, but amn is reportedly somewhat shocked.

-BACID: MAKE FUCKING BOARD PRIVATE!!@&^$#^!#(*&!!    thanks! ;)

-Ermm.. more busts are coming.. I hope you all read that leaked email from EA that
 one of our boys scored.. Thing is: its time to be afraid, because if a major 
 company like EA can actually get its shit in gear, and start to clean out the
 insiders.. well.. whats next? ;p
 To mr XXXXX XXXX, security... : dude.. don't go patting yourself on the back just
 yet.. you're still WAY behind.. And its one thing to clean up your own company..
 I hate to break it to you, but you ARE NOT gonna stop the games from being released.
 They are just gonna be 2 or 3 days later now..

 And no, thats not the reason why ppl are making pirated copies of your shit, just
 so that they can "play it early".. ppl pirate stuff cause they WANT FREE SHIT.

 What you need to do is get some better copy protection.. seriously.. hire some
 crackers, bro.. i hear beowulf is available... .*cough*...

 HAHAHAHAHAHAH...

 In all seriousness tho kiddies.. you'd all better start to knuckle-down here and
 watch your back, cause our old friends at the F . B . I . are in the game now,
 and they are a whole load of fun to play with... ;p


-go buy bounces from socalsys.com.. they are the official NWR sponsors, and they are
 damn good to us. Run by some fairly "scene-friendly" admins, they got bounces, shells,
 eggs, and all kinds of goodies.. and i will personally fucking guarantee you that they
 will not assfuck you.... ... heh... how's that for an endorsement?

-nwr is on tuesday from now on, or something..

-where in the fuck is our webpage?
 and the coded version?
 nd + lester = 2 lazy fucks!   ;D


-MnM iS DEAD.

--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors. We all love them, even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us- and these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, (your name will not be included), and we
do not add rumors like "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion" because 
we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore there 
is no hard evidence of that rumor. So, if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!


-rumor has it that frozen water, one of the greatest curries ever, is 
 primed to make a comeback for some (unnamed) lucky group!

-rumor has it that CGS is coming up soon.

-rumor has it that ?xx Mxxxxx Sxxxxxxx will be up this week, running the fat
 ftp4all daemon.. YAY!!.. (about FUCKING time..)
