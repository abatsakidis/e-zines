    Well, might as well make the release date Tuesday after all. Fucking 
    gimpish co-editor and his little basketball game he had to goto! Well, 
    this week was certainly interesting for me anyways! Hehehe. Anyways, 
    we have the usual stuff, and a few other quirks. The webpage is almost 
    done thanks to our good friend Zeus and so by the next issue we should 
    be all set. I'd like to take a minute to mention Defacto2 and it's scene 
    archive. This is a place EVERYONE should go. Every old school guy can 
    relive some old memories, and the new people can learn about the better 
    times of the scene. Mass respect to them for this. I also want to 
    especially thank Bones for filling in for Bud last week and yet in our 
    confusion to get it out we failed to include it. Prozac was kind enough 
    to post it on ihs page and if you didn't check it out, you should. It's 
    quite good. Thanks again bones.

    Ok people... This issue is dedicated to acidapple, who is sick
    and dying in a german hospital somewhere right now. I talked to
    him the other day, and the dude isn't doing so well.. he is one
    thin motherfucker... 
    I won't go into specifics, but he has a laptop every now and then
    so if you see him, wish him well.. He promises to once again become
    fatapple, and trade like a mofo.... so... good luck, bro!

    On to some happy(?) news! The mag is once again out on a tuesday..
    heh... like muthafuckin' clockwork, yo!... or something.. ;)

    OMG, we got a sweet jam-packed issue this week.. it will own
    you massively.... 

    We have a wacky log of koka this week, called kokah.log...
    Man.. i dunno.. is there a SERIOUS language barrier there, or is
    the dude honestly that stupid?
    We also have a "fantasy" pic this week, drawn by none other than
    the allstar NWR photographer, tdpriest... he is a man of MANY talents..
    (or so i hear).... Anyways, this pic, called tdp-draw.jpg is something
    that he came up with one afternoon, after one of his many erotic daydream
    sessions that he is so famous for......

    I also have a leet txt file called ZER1006.TXT from when i was very
    cool, and used to hang in #zeraw on undernet.. phear.

    Anyways.. #releases is back.. Slice interview.. Chinablu log, etc, etc
    check it all out, hope you enjoy!!
    
    take care everyone, have a good week!!

    Well, i guess COD was narked this week. So... too bad.. Its sad to
  see that site go, but i guess its gone forever now, so not much we
  can do about that. 

    FH is back and doing quite well, we welcome it to the list this week.
  FH welcomes FALLEN, becoming FALLEN WHQ. (A spot that previously belonged
  to the now-dormant MDK)
    APOC became 2000ad EHQ.. good to see. Apparently 2kad is primed for a 
  comeback..
    In other news, we welcome back the site "COD". Many of you will remember
  COD, from a long time ago, when it was narked. Good to see that the site
  finally made it back.

    AF1 is coming back... nice to hear..
    NEC is doing pretty well in its first week.. saw the usual suspects
  trading there.. as well as nutcase.. wb nutty.
    
    Sorry i don't have much more news, but i'll try to come up with something
  a little more interesting for next week.. Thanks to the ppl who helped me
  with weektops... take care..
    
    Man.. the RDX weektop owns me. cedric had 2200 megs this week.. nice
  work, dude.. i guess its more of a "monthtop" now, or smth..

    I didn't have enough weektops this week, missed out on HOE, E, and STH..
  so if the scores look fucked, then... deal with it.. someone collect
  more weektops... siteops: get in the act if you want your sites represented.
  Mail your weektops to that address, or give them to tech, or duranged..
  

=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. 
	Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... 
heh... fuck off and die..

Biased Courier Repot


Well, Unfortunately, due to my Utils side of things taking up much of this 
week, I didn't pay too much attention to the sites..but i do have a couple 
of things..:)


Dimension: Welp, Toadie continues to own, and as of presstime today, 
Tuesday, Caserd is movin up quick, along with the other DMS boys they are 
starting to get back into a groove

Overall: DMS = Dyslexic Midget Syndrome


Devotion: Another so/so week from the boys. Nothing special but nothing 
less than special either. They did their job, despite losing Leddy to DMS.

Overall: DEV = Diabolically Evil Virgins


AOD: AOD is not quite the mass domination of the past few weeks, but they 
are still going strong, on the strength of Cedric and some others. With FH 
back up it only increases their recent site list.

Overall: Anally Obsessed Dwarves


RiSC: Well, I don't think much of them, but i have to include this little 
tidbit about the new risc traders and their talent:

<SuckTHis> [dragoth] New STH Util Upload by Garoto/DEVOTiON - WINDOWS.2000.
           DIZ.FIX.FOR.THE.INFO.FIX-SEIKO

<SuckTHis> New STH Util Upload by hfb/RISC - WINDOWS.2000.DIZ.FIX.FOR.THE.
           INFO.FIX-SEIKO

HFB proceeded to make this dir on all the other sites he uploaded to. So you 
have to applaud Risc for trading those info lines.


Special thanks to Sketch, who has provided alot of good dirt on some of 
these fools lately.:)

Overall: RISC = Ravenously Incestual Siamese Chickens


Well, the theme for this week was Failed Acronym meanings for the groups. 
I think some of them woulda been more fitting huh?:)

 Bud's Biased Utils Report #9
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The warped minds here at the Biased Utils Report (that means me!)
 opted for a change of pace this week. Instead of my usual *somewhat* truthful
 reviews, I've instead thrown professionalism and quality journalism out the
 window and gone for showmanship! So in place of the normal report, I bring
 you a selection of SUPER-BIASED reviews done by various members of the utils
 scene.

 Some info about the format... there was none. I gave all guest authors free
 reign over their chosen topic. Some decided to take a look at a given groups
 performance over a single week, others looked at the group as a whole. Finally,
 this was originally scheduled for last week, so if any dates are off, blame me.

 Here's the "Bud saves his ass" disclaimer.... these aren't my opions...
 keep that in mind (although I may choose to agree with some). And it's all
 for fun... don't take it TOO seriously.
                             
 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Time Periods don't really apply this week, although it would have been
       01/31/99 to 02/06/99.

 Groups: (In the order they were submitted in (I think)) 
  
 THE CORPORATION:

 Reviewed by: Bones

 Hey, Bones from ENTiTY here, giving you my biased view on CORP this week.
 I'll start with this week. Nothing too fabulous this week, a blatantly
 obvious dupe of XFORCE on their best title, Opticad.. 3 apps were also put
 out for all you biochemists in the scene. 2 Points off for the Dupe and
 The Biochemical apps (I'm sure they are nice apps, but think honestly about
 how many people will use them). The MetaIP stuff is pretty nice so a point
 they lost is regained. All in all this week was nothing special at all.
 This week I give them a 6/10.

 200-  990130   CheckPoint.MetaIP.v4.1.Enterprise-CORP                23030KB 

 Now for a more overall look at this group. They came back to life, pretty
 much out of nowhere around September of 98, bringing some controversy with
 them. At the beginning they had a bunch of problems, probably just
 (re)growing pains. A whole bunch of early releases were packed with 0
 compression (one actually grew in size, go figure) Here and there an app
 which went out as FINAL was actually a beta. Problems with other groups
 were around, think back the the corp.txt released a while ago. NFO wars
 with SIEGE cost a certain council his spot in CLASS. There were a few broken
 releases and a few dupes, but this happens to everyone and is not the norm
 for CORP.  Aside from all that, Corp has been relatively steady in their
 releasing, with good quality titles. They seem to have GREAT support from
 their leaders in terms of supplying, and they have good support from their 
 members (hi machv!). Anyways to sum it up, hopefully they can probably keep 
 up the momentum they have started with. Overall I'd give them a 7/10, the 
 score being lowered for all their early problems. Perhaps in a bit more time 
 they can show that those problems are completely gone, as they have done, 
 and this score can go up (and i think they have certainly tried, mosty 
 successfully).

 
 X-FORCE:

 Reviewed by: Bud

 No one signed up for XF, so I did a quickie job on em. :)

 XForce was at one time supposedly the top group in the scene. Of course
 that #1 is debatable... but they were up there if you ever gave a shit 
 what mags like RCN had to say. Either way they were once a decent releasing
 team. Oh my how the mighty have fallen. They've passed the torch on to
 Siege as far as quality graphics utils go, and they can't even seem to get
 the clipart out anymore. So what are we left with? Betas, builds, and maybe
 the odd quality title... but for the most part, XF is gathering dust.

 In my heart they'll always be ClipForce, movers of 1000$ artpacks.
 Where would my life be without BODACIOUS_TEXTURES_RUST-XFORCE!! And of
 course who could survive lacking the twice monthly appearence of Ultimate 
 Toolkit for MFC. Let us not forget that this is a group that felt a need
 to give some sites MEGA-HQ status. Well, the Mega HQ and all the others
 are still around, but the titles have dried up. When all is said and done,
 kudos for the past work, and get yer ass in gear if ya wanna reach 
 the millenium!
 

 LEGENDS NEVER DIE:

 Reviewed by: Lester

 As former leader of this once great group, I feel uncomfortable about 
 writing this, and yet I feel it is neccesary for me to do so, as I was 
 once apart of the true Legends Never Die. The true 'Legends' of this 
 group have long since passed on into their real lives, leaving this 
 group with a immature and immoral leader. Nightsky, who I have a great
 deal of respect for, is left to run this group with Grad, and does not
 seem to be able to control his antics, or maybe is turning a blind eye 
 to it, as even I did for some time. LND has released some very reputable 
 titles recently, but all titles are released to the largest size possible,
 and with other peoples cracks on a large number of them. Grad has numerous
 times stated that LND is simply for the prewhores and will use any means
 neccesary to release. This is a blasphemy of what the old LND stood for
 and was. Such grand names as Orion, TMOD, Snake, and Hannibal, are left 
 as distant memories in the now heavily mocked LND. One can only hope that
 they may return and bring LND back to it's glory, or that the other leaders
 of LND will realize the harm that Grad is doing to this group.


 PINNACLE: 

 Reviewed by: Vantmas

 This is my biased report on the group PINNACLE.
 I would like to startout by saying I was a little iffy on reviewing 
 them because I am not a big fan of groups who name themselves after 
 a baseball glove/ball manufacturer ( a poor one at that, my pinnacle
 glove is a piece of shit).  I have talked to Kirk_Hammat, a senior/supplier,
 good job pnc of making him a senior, so he would stay and supply :) he 
 wouldnt send me an nfo when i asked for one, so its a bad start for the 
 pnc boys.  I decided to checkout there 6 latest releases, and was suprised
 to find out that 4 out of 6 could be downloaded as shareware off the web,
 and looks like thats where they got it.  I was going to say they were 
 exactly like CORP but with respect, but thats because I was under the 
 impression they were non-shareware, MY BAD.  Looks like they might be
 the present day PRM, with a sprinkle of commercial releases.  They have
 HOE as there whq, but last time I checked cardiel was still coming on irc,
 so it might not be up for long.  Also, there nfo is very boring, take pride
 in  your releases, maybe change it atleast ONCE A YEAR. I would rather read 
 the dictionary.  I dont know how long PNC can keep there current members,
 looking at there nfo i notice a LOT of dual grouping. I also notice that
 mr_zima and Kirk_hamma have ops in SCUM and few of there members are members
 of scum, so I dont know if there is a potential merge there. i have two 
 final sentences for PNC: 1) Looks like PNC is the idle PNC of old but 
 with 1-2 gifted carders and/or web suppliers and a supplier in kirk. 
 2) PNC will not be a group that lasts, guranteed and they will not release
 there 1 a day release for long, mark my words! This is VantMaS of ACE, 
 saying I WANT MY ADSL, IDIOT PACBELL PEEPS.  Watch for ACE in 99.

 
 SCUM:

 Reviewed by: Kirk Hammet

 Well, here we are...I'm hungry and tired so your not gonna read anything
 good about Scum (you werent gonna read anything good anyway). Lets start
 with the releases. They got six releases since they restarted. There first
 release "Livelink Ontime Enterprise v4.64 For WinNT" they raced PFT and 
 lost on most sites...good job. There second release came the next day. 
 "Sniff Plus Java v3.0.2", It's is a minor update from Corp's release of
 v3.0.1 and it didnt even work but at least the fix was out the same day!
 Excellents Work Guys!. "MGI Videowave v2.0" is actually a good title, gotta
 give them that one. Except for the fact that it didnt really work. Some 
 options werent working, and it would crash more times than fusions mom on 
 herion. Another outstanding job by our Scum friends. The Next item on the 
 acuation block is "Vision Jade v4.0a FULL SUITE", seems to me like a dupe 
 of TRPS's version. They say its different and the difference is that its 
 a fuller version, so basicly its the same shit just more .doc's and crap 
 files for me to download well woopdy fucking doo I'm happy bout that one. 
 I dont think it can get any better then that release...do you?	The nfo 
 reads ..."As pointed out before in this nfo, SCuM is an old group refounded.
 We dont want to be another group at the front we just want to release what 
 we like most ourselves, quality utils and applications." I guess they are 
 still trying to achive that!! And what the fuck is "Another group at the
 front"?!? Note to scum boys...dont smoke crack and write nfo's, it's not
 a good thing! "Have Fun, Dont Die! - Poison/SCuM" Yeah...Ill try not to
 thanx...I wouldnt of figured that one out with out you guys thanks. Without
 that comment i would have had a boring life and died early but now that I 
 have read that I'll have fun, and I'll NEVER EVER die!!! So in closing i 
 leave you with another quote from SCUM nfo "WE ARE ALL HUMAN, BUT ONLY THE
 GREAT ONES CAN BE SCUM!" So why are there so many ppl in your group? I 
 know your all not great! Time to kick some people out, actually kick all the 
 people out. Go do something productive like Bingo or GinRummy.              
 

 SIEGE

 Reviewed by: Grad

 Siege has been around quite a while and is best known as a group that
 caters to graphic and design aficionados.  They have, by far, some of the
 best resources of any group (China Blue) and can buy/bribe just about
 anyone into doing what they want. 

 **************The Key Member**************

 China Blue - this self-proclaimed robin hood of warez has tremendous
 wealth and influence.  She was great working with but annoying as
 an opposition.  She's a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type person that
 you don't want to catch in a bad mood.  She is the top supplier
 of both hardware and software. 

 *************The Followers*************
 Siege is rather large group with ~40 members (not including siteops).
 This is substantially larger than most other groups but is fine if 
 they can manage and satisfy the constituents. 

 ************The Software************
 As I stated earlier, Siege is a predominantly graphics based group. 
 Every group should have a mission statement and it seems that Siege's 
 screams "GRAPHICS, GRAPHICS, GRAPHICS."  Occasionally they'll get a
 few gems outside the graphics genre (about 15-20%).

 *********The Sites*********
 Siege has 12 sites listed in their nfo with the most notable
 being ET. Personally I question the siteops who consider siege
 as an affiliation. Why would anyone in their right mind pick
 Siege (other than for the name) when traders (who are the people
 that actually support sites) can get Siege releases from 12 other
 sites?  Also, what about those 40+ users? Who wants to give them 
 all leech?  From Siege's point of view this was probably done out 
 of necessity (and with bribes) due to their large membership base.

 ************The Crackers************
 My favorite, the crackers.  Siege has plethora of crackers. 
 Flat Chicken, Kashmir/Only/Bspline (same person), Fuhrley, StPark, 
 KrK, Wayward, OrionYoun, CrackZ, and probably a few others I forgot.
 Siege seems to think that they own these guys--just try to persuade
 one to leave and watch the reprimands fly from both s^j and china blue.  
 thought people were raised to make their own decisions but such is not
 the case when you join Siege.  My guess is that half these crackers 
 were bought out by 'gifts' of hardware because as one cracker told me,
 "I have a debt to cb wherever she goes as long as she is in the scene."
 Take that for what it's worth.

 ***********************The Lame-Assed Couriers***********************

 Recently Siege took a lame-assed courier into their ranks (Garoto). 
 Depending on how you look at it: A) package deal with a site or site(s) 
 B) desperation for site support (someone has to pre these 12 sites)
 C) both of the above My Take:  A Stupid, myopic move.  Traders should
 be no part of any group unless they can rip, package, and spread effectively.
 Brains helps too so that just rules out Mr. Seiko.  Mr. Seiko probably 
 thought that joining Siege he'd close in on my alltime record on ET. 
 SORRY CHARLIE!  TAKE A LOOK THE GAP IS GETTING WIDER.

 **********Conclusion**********

 A big group with tons of cracking talent (regardless of how they were 
 acquired), plenty of sites, and good suppliers.  As long as China Blue 
 remains a part of this group it remain among the top 3 or 4 groups.

 Well, PFT had a pretty good week, with a lot of QUALITY over quantity which
 is nice to see for a change in the scene.Turbo Tax is an okay release, not
 really something people but more or less need to keep their finances in
 order. Folio Live Publish 5 was the highlight for me, it is a really nice
 nice app, one which I was a bit disappointed about being beaten on, but hey
 shit happens :/. Novera jBusiness 4 is also a nice title, and for me has to
 tie with Live Publish for their #1 release of the week, although maybe a
 bit specialized. Lost and Found, although not big in meggage is a really
 useful little util for recovering data, although the installation is a
 bit weird, since you must install from disks :/.The Java-addin for Winrunner
 just seems to enable a lot more functions most of us would never use anyway.
 Cactus WorkBench is a nice title, but a very minor update. Attachmate
 Management Console is another quality release, something I have come to
 expect from PFT. The Reflection app I am not too sure about, as a slightly
 diff ver was released as 7.01. Also good work on web reports, another nice
 app. Overall, a good week for PFT , 7.5/10.

 I think PFT are probably one of the better utils releasing groups on the
 scene today. Unlike some others (not mentioning any names) they seem to
 have a standard set for their releases, which is something good to see in
 the scene today, with it being the way it is. A lot of groups could learn
 something from PFT.


 ACE

 Reviewed by: Powertool

 Well, it looks as if these guys finally bit the bullet.  Culture as well
 as Vantmas left this week and there is no real hope for them now.  
 I know that a lot of sceners are not familiar with ACE, so I have 
 decided to give you a little history about ACE.

 ACE started out as a curry group.  Oh yeah, we had the elite sites like
 the DoggPound (Jman useta' beat my ass on it:P.)  Later on, we decided
 we were gonna release utilities and get away from that lame thing called 
 currying.  We began to accumulate crackers and supplies daily.  Many of 
 the top sceners were in ACE upon my arrival.  Some of these were
 woodson, techfuzz, gza, brainski, OlieW, keewee, marbitoz, avoozl and many
 others.  We kept on releasing and releasing until culture left for a while.
 Culture's roomate Vasa took ACE by the helm and well, sunk ACE to the bottom
 of the sea.  By this time, I was in F4CG (hiho mates) and was just an 
 onlooker of a group of people who I spent a lot of fun nights with.  ACE 
 eventually split up.  A few weeks/months later, REUNiTED was formed.  
 REUNiTED did very poorly, so they decided to switch names back to ACE for
 a boost.  With culture back and many new suppliers, ACE looked to have a 
 bright future.  They were releasing daily once again and had some very 
 nice releases.  Then, Vantmas leaves for RiSE.  Culture stays around just 
 for a about a week longer, then decides he is quitting the scene.  So ACE
 now has no leader or well, in a nutshell, no chance.  It's a shame to see
 this one go because I loved them all so much. 

 Releases this week: N/A (Group has Died)

 Score: 10/10 for Effort!  Best of luck to you all in your future endevors, 
 wherever they may lead you to.

 PS: This was actually damn hard for me to write.  I enjoyed my time with 
 you all and we had some very memorable moments.  You were my first real
 group and i will never forget you guys for it.  Much love for everything...
 now time to put this biatch on ice.    


 SODOM 

 Reviewed by: Poison

 The comeback of Sodom some weeks ago completely surprised me, in a 
 positive way. I have always liked this group and the members which it 
 contained. They had some nice releases first 2 weeks of their new existence 
 but after that it became a little quiet with them. I dont doubt that they 
 will have many more releases though, because i know how much work it is to 
 reform a group :). For now i wish them all the luck with the things they have
 to sort out (its a lot of work guys, but worth it) and i hope when thats done
 that we will see a lot more from a fine oldskool group, i am sure u guys 
 will be a nice competition to other util groups.

 Quote(s) of the Week: <MrBones> this is taking FOREVER
                          ^^^^^ Bones learns my pain :))

 <superjess> make sure u put in ur util report jess rox, k?
 <Bud-> hahaa sure :)
 <Bud-> consider it done

 All the reviews are untouched and unedited, exactly as I recieved them.
 So if they suck, at least I can't be blamed. It was interesting
 anyways... judge for yourself which were a success. There may even be
 a few people up there who could steal my job <G>. It's all in jest
 and I hope you all took it that way. To be honest, I expected
 them to be a lot more biased, so some people got off pretty easy. 

 There were a few other people who were going to be involved in this,
 but I either didn't get a chance to see tem in time or they didn't
 have time to finish, but thanks to everyone!

 Next week I'll be back with my normal report, but I suppose I should give
 my REAL thoughts as to the actual week of utils, briefly. When the dust
 settled after the past 7 days, DOD had suprised a LOT of people.. 
 they appear to be back for another round, and if they can keep it up, they
 could really shake the utils scene (they have before). A lot of nice titles
 out of that camp this week. Also, congrats of sorts to PFT for getting
 PowerQuest's Lost & Found (recovery software) out... this thing had some
 nasty protection on it, which PFT cheated by WinImaging.. but it works
 (as long as you have a disk drive =]).

 This week also saw the resurgance of XFORCE.. at least to some extent, but
 several of the releases were a bit iffy. SGE and RISE were mostly idle, SGE
 doing the most recent build of Speed Razor on top of a few plugins, 
 and Rise doing just one title after some internal reorganizing. For the
 rest of the pack, we saw some ups and downs... TRPS had a fair amount
 of releases, and SHOCK released a massive amount of apps, but neither
 had any real top quality titles. Entity was idle, and Manifest Destiny
 was suprisingly quiet compared to previous weeks. Corp had a decent run, 
 with some Webtrends products including the new Security Analyzer 2 as well
 as some other decent apps, although a Canadian tax proggie really wasn't 
 necessary. PRM also made their presence felt. Finally, LND, despite public
 opinion and contreversy, had a good week overall, with Visio 5 Enterprise
 and Autocad's Quickcad 6 Millenium.

 Anyways that about wraps things up for this edition... see ya next week!

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

Telesync/TS: Telesync is a procam on a tripod in an empty theater with a 
separate audio source. If there's an audience, you hear people coughing, 
camera is shaky, etc. It's a CAM.    CAM = banned. If you want a movie 
extremely early, Telesync is the way it will be.

Workprint: Workprint is a pre-release copy of a movie, stolen copy, etc. 
that usually has the film running time on the screen.

Screener: Screener is usually the BEST quality, an actual vcd of the movie, 
made from a reviewers copy, etc. Screener's are generally released after 
movies have left the theaters.


Special Thanks to Ryche of EViLiSO for the education in VCD terms, and to 
come.to/vcddupe for keeping us up to date on the new titles.

Ryche's Really Biased VCD Report #2

[2:28] <Lester> well i dont want to spread misinformation

This week saw alot of releases from the VCD scene, and we see a disturbing 
trend developing among the releasing groups and the sites that allow VCD's. 

This week, another new *sigh* VCD group appeared and released The Thin Red 
Line. As I write this on Sunday morning, the VCD is over 3 days old.. and 
CD3 is STILL NOT COMPLETE ANYWHERE!! Has it been nuked by siteops? Fuck no. 
Theyre excuse? "Well its a good movie.." So fucking what? I guess release 
groups can take as long as they want to release a movie now. This is the 
second week in a row something like this has happened, and last week 
Centropy was punished with a well-deserved nuke for not releasing the .rar 
file of thier release of The Minion last week (Although, to thier credit, 
they did finally release 3 days later). 

Siteops: Wake The Fuck Up! Hold VCD releasing groups to the same rules 
you hold ISO groups. If they cant release correctly, they shouldnt even be 
releasing. You complain about crap releases taking up your precious gigs, 
but you'll let a 3CD movie sit incomplete for 4 days? Other than that, an 
overall good week for VCD's and the groups that release them.

020699  The Progeny (Screener/VHS)
[NUKED] Subspecies 4 (Screener/Centropy)
[NUKED] The Thin Red Line (35MM/HighSpeed)

-VCD-Europe- 

A relatively slow week for VCD-Europe but they did manage to spit out Antz 
which is an all computer animated movie and did well at the box office. The 
only other copy on the net was a shitty telesync so props for releasing this. 
HOWEVER, it does come out on video Tues. Feb. 9, in the US (hmm..same time as 
NWR? :P) so whatever props you got for releasing it, I take back cuz you 
released it so late.

Total - 1 Point

-EViLISO-

Good week for EViLISO. 4 Movies in one week, and all good titles. Dusk Till 
Dawn 2 is SUPPOSEDLY going straight to video but not before late march so 
good job no matter what people say. Civil Action I hear is blurry, and 
Varsity Blues theyve admitted you can hear people laughing in some parts, 
so -1 points for fucking up there. For the week tho, they did good and put 
out movies people want.

Total - 4 Points

-FiZ-

Havent heard much from FiZ lately so its nice to have a different group to 
review. Bride of Chucky was the last installment of the killer doll series 
with Jennifer Tilly and her large breastesses. Decent release, and we didnt 
have to wait 7 days for them to finish uploading.
Hope we see more from this lesser-known group in the future.

Total - 2 Points

-Centropy-

Well last week I was a little harsh on Centropy for not releasing that .rar 
file for 3 days.
I usually write my report on Sunday (No, not on Tues. night like the rest 
of the staff) and when I wrote that, the file wasnt out. They did however 
finally release it late on Monday like they promised but it still took 
them a dog's age to complete it. Ill give you a 1/2 Point for following 
through on your promises tho. This week they released Shadrach which is 
a family movie starring Harvey Keitel (figure that one out) and 
Subspecies 4 which is already out on Video in the US and was consequently 
nuked. If you dont know by now, Subspecies is about the worst direct-to-video 
Vampire story ever made, so with the fourth installment being nuked, dont 
think your missing out.

Total - 2.5 Points

-VHS (Videoholics)-

VHS released The Progeny on Saturday night, just before my report deadline. 
What is it? Its a future video-only horror movie directed by Brian Yuzna 
who has made a few good ones in the past that I cant recall (short-term) 
right now. This group is one who wishes to remain anonymous, but since they 
continue to release, I say no dice. TFAiSO which up until just recently used 
to release under thier own name, pre's VHS releases and quite a few 
Centropy/TFAiSO members seem to know alot about them. If your really 
curious about this *ahem* unknown group, I suggest you pick thier brains 
about it, not mine.

Total - 2 Points

-HighSpeed- 

Who the hell are HighSpeed? Remember last week when I listed the current VCD 
releasing players and said "with various groups rearing thier ugly head to 
throw shit in the game"?
Bingo. Supposedly a 2 man wondergroup who actually had 2 great releases with 
one large problem. They dont know how to pre. Once again, 3 days after their 
"35MM" release, which is actually a Telesync, it's still incomplete on every 
site including the one they pre'd to. If your going to release to major sites, 
pre right. You dont start a release, go to sleep if you get tired, do a 
little more, go idle for a day and expect any self-respecting site to wait on 
your lazy ass. Thanks to this, your 2 great releases knocked you down to one
good one with a penalty point for being lazy. And I got through that without 
making fun of the irony of their name. :)

Total - 1 Point


Altogether it was a pretty good week for VCD, filling in with lots of gigs 
for traders and sites in one of the slowest times of the year. Our second 
group of the week award goes to EViLISO for thier number of releases and 
movie selection. Centropy despite their nuke comes in second for fixing 
their screw-up last week, but I fear theyve started a trend by taking so 
long to release. FiZ and VHS each come in with horror movie screeners with 
FiZ's being the prefered one to download. Our dumbass of the week award 
(should we call it "The Centropy"?) goes to HighSpeed for going on vacation 
during a pre.

Shakespeare in Love - 01/22/99 - Telesync - IGN - 2 Discs

Video Quality: Not incredibly great, a dim kind of bland picture, but not 
overall bad quality. No people moving or other harsh problems. 
Rating: 3

Audio Quality: Again, nothing special or bad here
Rating: 3 1/2

Movie Quality: Again, a movie I had not yet seen, but was interested in 
seeing. It is indeed good, but best picture of the year would be a stretch 
indeed. None the less, it's a good romantic comedy and I recommend getting it
Rating: 4

Review by Lester
------------------------

Varsity Blues - 02/02/99 - Telesync - EViLiSO - 2 Discs

Video Quality: Pretty good, I have seen better from this group though, no 
complaints on the video side.
Rating: 3 1/2


Audio Quality: Now we run into the goof up of the week. :) There's some 
snickering and laughter during the comic scenes of the movie, and the 
occassional talking that you catch. It's not too bad since you are probably 
laughing at the same time they are, but you will still notice it. So they 
lose points for that, but it's still less noisy than being in a theatre. 
And 2 cd's is cheaper than 7.50 admission anyday.

Movie Quality: Good movie, I saw it in the theatre and now here, so I say 
it's worth it.
Rating: 4

Review for Childs Play 4 Screener : Chucky's Bride

Quality = Good. No glitches or sound interferences, Though there is the 
Property of Universal thing that swings by 3-4 times during the movie, which 
didn't bother me at all.

Quick Review = Chucky's back and now he has a doll sized bitch to help him.
There is some comedy in this horror movie, and its definately worth seeing 
if you haven't already seen it before.

-----------[Interview with Slice]-----------

<NWR> : For the record, please state your current and past affils.


<Slice> oh geeze lester..  ok.. one sec
<Slice> PCW, NVC, FATE, RAPIER, ATOMIC, CONCORD, EMPIRE, AMNESIA
<Slice> past affils
<Slice> current affils: 
<Slice> Razor 1911, Risc, Rise


<NWR> Let's start by talking about Rise, in the past 3 days, they have made 
some big acquisitions. Lester from Siege, Bones and the Entity crew, 
Knoweffex, Billdo from LND. etc, You have to be pleased with this, but did 
you forsee all of this happening?


<Slice> I have been vying to make RISE the number 1 utils group for quite 
awhile, our cards played in right this time and we cashed in big time.  
Not only has RISE as a whole gained from these acquisitions, but the people 
who joined are extremly happy to be in our innovative little group


<NWR> Rise has long been respected for releasing high quality apps, but 
it's always been infrequent, and long has Rise been up and down with weeks 
at a time of no releases. Is Rise looking to become an everyday release 
group with these recent moves?


<Slice> Everyday is not the key, as many beleive in the scene.  RISE has 
never been the group to release 20 titles a day, or gigs per week.  We look 
at the apps we have, the apps we will get in the future, and decide which we 
will release

<Slice> Everything we do is based upon the standard fact that we want to be 
the HIGHEST quality utils group availble to the user base.

<Slice> Every crack we do is just a little bit better then our competitors, 
every title we release in turn is just that much better.  Perfection is what 
we are after.  Not releasing daily.  


<NWR> Rise has also had a very large membership base and isn't known for 
kicking members very often, but with all the recent pickups, are you worried 
Rise will get too big for it's own good?


<Slice> RiSE has always been a very very large family.  We have members from 
all over the world!  Once a member is accepted into RISE..  it is a commitment
by the group to that person as well as a commitment by that person to the 
group.  It is important that we maintain our family style atmosphere and dont 
turn RISE into a business.  We do remove people as they start not showing up, 
or if they violate group policy.. or violate their responsibilities..  because 
that is lacking on your commitment to the group.

<Slice> Other then that, we encourage our members to have fun, and enjoy the 
ride :)


<NWR> Looking back on the Pro Mechanica release you guys did, you received 
alot of praise for that, but then you received alot of flak for putting out 
the Dec Alpha version. Why did you choose to release that version, knowing 
virtually all sites would nuke it? And looking back now, would you still have 
done it?


<Slice> Parametric Technologies releases products to be used by a very 
exclusive group of people.  To forgo an operating system that would benefit 
our userbase, and ignore our email message boxes is not in our best interest.  
Regardless of site policy on DEC alpha systems, if the demand is there for 
the release, RISE will release it based upon its quality value.


<NWR> Moving on, you have been fiercely loyal to Razor and Rise, and up 
until recently Risc, but in the not too distant past. You changed groups 
quite often, what finally instilled a sense of loyalty in you?


<Slice> hahahaha :)  

<Slice> Well, quite frankly, in the previous groups I was affiliated with, 
I didnt find a group of people I could hang with on a regular basis :).  
RiSE works perfect becuase I get to pick and choose who I want to hang 
with <grin> :).   Razor has some awesome people and so does RISC regardless 
of what people say about it today :).  

<Slice> Well
<Slice> that and I enjoyed being in lots of different groups and leading 
the rushing charge :)
<Slice> GOO RAPIER!! :)


<NWR> Well none can argue the desire to remain loyal to a group such as Razor, 
and then Rise goes without saying since you are a leader. But let's touch on 
Risc. A few weeks ago you left Risc, but as of a few days ago you returned 
to senior status. What was the story behind that?


* Slice ponders
<Slice> Should I retire from RISE for a few weeks?  :). . I have done it 
before

<Slice> i take breaks from my affils just as anyone else does..  the RISC 
break was a bit more official.


<NWR> Well, you have gone ahead and returned to Risc, but what do you think 
of the Risc of today, you've been around long enough to watch their downward 
spiral. So what do you think of the Risc we see today and who is at the head 
of it?


<Slice> Risc takes alot of flak from alot of different people for in my 
opinion the wrong reasons.  

* Slice grins
<Slice> Risc is at the forefront of the courier field regardless of what 
people say about it

<Slice> It is the grand daddy of couring, and the group has amazing depth.  

<Slice> The reason I remain in Risc is because I beleive in quality, and 
regardless what people say, what I see every day in their channel.. is 
quality minded people. :)

<Slice> Cmon, who doesnt love scans antics? :P 


<NWR> I just believe your being politically correct here, because if your 
willing to say that the recent pickups by Risc are reminiscient of quality 
minded people, then you need to retire for awhile for sure. And also, if 
Risc has such amazing depth, why do they proceed to recruit seemingly anyone 
and everyone they can?


<Slice> Hrmm..  Quite honestly, I am not involved in day to day operations 
of RISC.  You know I dont play the courier game that much any more :).  I 
have been there, done that..  even from a leaders perspective for a short 
period of time.  I hold my own opinions about couring in general ..  because 
I used to be a courier myself :).  

<Slice> The courier scene is tragically flawed now a days.
<Slice> you would have to agree with that ;)


<NWR> Is it true Rise is based around Chicago and the council of Rise meets 
together often for gay orgies?


<Slice> hrmm
<Slice> You will have to ask toth for an answer to that question <grin>


<NWR> I'll assume thats a yes.


<NWR> Returning to Razor, they have been taking some slack from less 
respectful members of the scene for not releasing alot and for some recent 
betas and things. The old scene members continue to respect the Blade for 
being The Blade, but what is happening with Razor and where does the future 
stand?


<Slice> Razor 1911 has a strong future regardless of what people say.  People 
talk continuously in the courier and game scenes and it just causes problems 
and develops into fights.  Razor has amazing potential, an amazing membership 
role, and some of the coolest mother fuckers you will meet.   They are working 
to fix certain issues.  thats all I can say.

<Slice> I support Razor through high and low
<Slice> EVERY group goes through its high and low times.  
<Slice> Thats how it works.


<NWR> What are your personal plans for the future?


<Slice> Well,  Jenna Jameson doesnt return my calls...  I REALLY want to star 
in a porno :P.  

<NWR> might be better off callin toth about those gay orgies..

* Slice laughs
<Slice> as I said, talk to Toth about those :)
<Slice> No future plans...  scene life is played day to day


<NWR> So how big is your dick then? just a Slice? or the whole Pie?


<Slice> Ask Jenna Jameson that question <GRIN> :P


<NWR> And what kind of a lame handle is Slice anyways?:)
<NWR> that soda sucks

<Slice> hahaha
<Slice> what kind of name is lester?


<NWR> i'm asking the questions here
<NWR> but if you must know
<NWR> It's from Skate or Die
<NWR> i was 8
<NWR> i'm loyal to my name


<Slice> Slice was a nick I choose because I couldnt think of anything else
<Slice> i had the soda in front of me
<Slice> go figure

<NWR> One final question...is it Lemon Lime Slice? or Orange?

-----------[Pray for a Scene Friend]-----------

We would like to send our best wishes and prayers to Acidapple, of Devotion, 
Blizzard, and co-siteop of TMS. He is currently in the hospital and suffering 
from gastro-intestinal disease. We have spoken with him and he is recovering 
and hopefully we will be able to see him online and back to his normal self 
as soon as possible. He's already been asking for a shell to start trading 
again. :) Anyways, everyone send their best wishes to him if you see him or 
direct them to NWR and we will try to get them to him.


                                                 -The NWR Staff

-----------[An Unflattering Log of a "Big" Fan]-----------


Well, I had originally planned never to print this out of respect for 
Chinablue and Siege itself. Now some things have changed. 

I idled ever since the day of this talk, waiting to make peace with china, 
which never came about. I don't slander China because I still respect her 
for her contributions to DMS and many other groups. But, I will say the 
way she handled me and the way Siege handled me was inappropriate. 

Yesterday, which was Saturday, in case NWR comes out on Tuesday again<g>. 
I was told that I either needed to quit Siege or be removed, or get involved. 
So I told them I would leave of my own free will and had been planning to do 
so anyways, but I stayed out of loyalty to friends like David & Goliath and 
Snapz and SJ and the like. So now my destiny was sealed. I figured fine, it 
ends well. I get to leave and they are happy as well. But evening time rolls 
around and I haven't yet quit because I would like to say goodbye to my friend 
D&G, and so I reboot and when i come back, I'm no longer on the Siege bots. 
No one msgs me or tells me I am not a member any longer. And now today, it 
is being sent around that I was kicked out. So I print this only to clear 
the air. Siege did the same kind of thing to Unclejohn, and not many people 
noticed. Maybe now a few people will notice.

<chinablu-> yeh
<Lester> about that utils report in NWR..
<chinablu-> d0h
<chinablu-> i dont care
<chinablu-> im not reading NWR anymore
<Lester> if you are going to stop reading NWR simply because siege wasn't 
ranked #1 for a week, I am extremely disappointed in you..I mean it 
WILL happen..Siege will lost to a group every now and again..:)
<chinablu-> oh bullshit lester and you know it
<chinablu-> i didnt give a damn about siege's rankings
<chinablu-> not in that bullshit report
<Lester> then I dont see what the problem is
<chinablu-> the problem was what your bud sed
<chinablu-> haha
<chinablu-> did you see what rise released?
<Lester> bud doesn't use lightwave plugins
<Lester> big woop
<chinablu-> it was nuked on every site
<Lester> ya they beat us on pro mechanica
<Lester> and they put out some stupid hospital shit too
<chinablu-> it was a dec alpha
<chinablu-> pro mechanica was a dec alpha
<chinablu-> not for pc
<chinablu-> n e way
<chinablu-> i dont have to justify my opinion to you
<chinablu-> your rag is biased
<chinablu-> and its based on bullshit
<chinablu-> i dont wanna read it
<chinablu-> enuf sed
<Lester> laugh..you are beginning to take certain things far too 
seriously..the mag is for comedy..the utils report is the least biased 
of them all in my opinion..cuz bud is shock and he knows they aren't 
competing for #1
<chinablu-> wutever, that's your right as the head of the mag
<chinablu-> i wont read it
<chinablu-> alot of people aren't reading it anymore
<chinablu-> n e way
<Lester> is that so?
<Lester> that's why i am msged by more ppl than i can count for when it 
will be out?:)
<Lester> if you dont like nwr, so be it..i can't make everyone happy
<chinablu-> wutever lester
<chinablu-> dont let delusions of grandeur go to your head
<chinablu-> =)
<Lester> but I dont see the justification..Rise gets a good rating and 
siege gets almost the same rating..and so nwr is tainted forever
<Lester> it's a scene emag..it is no grandeur
<Lester> but I know people like it
<chinablu-> no lester
<chinablu-> your boy fucked up
<chinablu-> admit and you'll go further 
<chinablu-> he gave a great grand rating to a group that released a HUGE 
release
<Lester> so what? maybe he did? he still rated corp above siege too
<Lester> :)
<chinablu-> that was nuked cuz it wasn't even a pc program
<chinablu-> oh gimee a break
<chinablu-> good for corp
<chinablu-> u sound like a corp boy anyway
<chinablu-> maybe you'll be happier over there?
<Lester> oh why thank you
<Lester> you want me to leave?
<chinablu-> nah i dont really care one way or the other
<Lester> well that makes me feel better
<chinablu-> good you shouuld feel better
<chinablu-> n e way 
<chinablu-> cyaz

-----------[#releases is back!]-----------

The channel that is near and dear to the hearts of many many scene members,
#releases, is making a comeback!
KFLEX has guaranteed to restore the channel to its former glory, when it
was the leetest channel on efnet <g>...
At its peak, it was home to more than 300 leetos, lamers, and... at least
a few feds... <g>
Ahhh.. the good old days...

<dude> !dupe Quake
<dude> ok.. like... how do i get the releases now, man? the bot's not
       giving them to me!!! 
<dude> wtf??/ this channel fucking sucks!!!!

Heh.. the good old days..

Seriously tho, i am told now that riches and sparc are even peacefully
idling in the same channel together now, so... that alone is worth the
price of admission.. ;)

Good luck to KFlex, and the rest of the #releases ops... stop by there
and chill.. i'm sure you'll see a few faces that haven't turned up in
a good year or so... ;)

-----------[The Scene News]-----------

All the news thats fit to print... 
and then some...


-Hey... acidapple is sick, so that fucking sucks. But you heard it
 here first: acidapple will get better, get a net connection, get
 a shell, and make the comeback of the year... and he will own you
 all..

-Well, after going out to the store, and actually BUYING sc3k (yeah,
 i'm so leet), i have decided that whatever they say it was, OGN's
 sc3k was not the store final.. who knows wtf it was.. Class's 
 version was the same as the one i got outta my shrink-wrap, so..
 I think that pretty much settles it, and i'm sure we won't hear
 anything else about this, any more....... ..... (yeah, right)

-if there are any congressmen reading this right now (and i know there
 are at least a few of you!) then hey: don't impeach the muthafuckin'
 president, man! We don't want no muthafuckin al gore... The dude was
 quoted the other day, busting out: "the message is clear to all those
 pirates out there... DON'T copy that floppy!"..... man... al gore
 is just gonna be FLOORED when he finds out about the ISO scene...

-Lester and his bitch, Tdpriest have jumped ship from wherever they
 were, and hooked up with RiSE.. now i was told that tdp was retired,
 so that he could concetrate on taking nude pics of jess... now someone
 tells me he is in RiSE?? ... omg... could this mean the return of
 the machine?.... 

-Karl is a whiny bitch, and TAW took #risciso just to prove how useless
 the dude is... 2 scoops of raisins to TAW, they GAVE it back after a
 bit.... ... no, Karl didn't get it back... ;p

-2 Groups picked up a ridiculous amount of members this week, Rise 
 and 2000ad... Check out all of 2kad's pick ups at: www.loke.org/2000AD
 In particular, they got madboy, tk4, rantnrave, and duranaged(!)
 Check out Rise... well.. never mind.. Half the scene is in Rise now,
 Just ask someone you know, they are probably a member..

-group moves: Lester to RiSE, tdpriest to RiSE, knoweffex to Rise, 
 all of ENTity to RiSE, Mrlefteye to scum, billdo to rise, leddy to 
 DMS, hfb/kruzin/vantmas kicked from rise, slice to RiSC, dual leaves
 DSi and XF, hfb to pnc, 
 
-Blackacid has a nice new layout... damn lot better than that purple and
 black shit he had going on before... but i still prefer the oldschool
 white background, from the good old days...

-Someone please castrate that airbrush dude.

-Why does this fucking mag keep coming out on tuesday?? grrr!

-That whole PNC/FTD stolen releases thing?? Wake the fuck up, people..
 EASY = PWA. PNC didn't steal the fax release... FTD = who are they? aren't
 they a florist company? just in time for valentines day.. leet.

-Not much else to say... ciao, babe.

--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors, we all love them even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us. And these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, your name will not be included, but we
do not add rumors like that say "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion"
because we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore
there is no hard evidence of that rumor, so if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!


-Rumor has it that XFROG was kicked from AoD, for leaking AODFTP to RiSC.
 XFROG later joined risc, who has been DOMINATING ever since they have had
 the use of the 3l33t util, "AoDfTP"...

-Rumor has it that the ultraHLE coders will not stop until they have a 100%
 compatability rate... stick it to the man, baby...

-Rumor has it that mgd is currently inactive because most of his time is
 spent shooting for the new skymasterson movie, "Warez!"... mgd plays the
 part of "bizzy", a lonely automaton trader who finds love and meaning
 in his life when he meets up with "darkdruid", a sexy female trader, played
 by angelina jolie.
