                        NETMONKEY WEEKEND REPORT #02!

        A tragic week has occurred in the scene this week, a top 5 site, MS
has been hacked.  The siteops were very angry and took down the site.
Another site Mercure was narced and AMB was taken down.  3 sites in one week,
is it really that dangerous to run a ftp site?  I think the answer would be
not really, considering that the government had no idea where the sites were,
somebody in the scene narced the site out, probably because of jealousy. The
best and longest Standing US Site of recent memory has finally gone down. We
send our best wishes to DL and its Staff.

	In this issue ET and FS have been bumped up to x3.0 because of the
fact that VDR is down and MS is dead.  FH was down at reset, so we're using
the weektop we got on Saturday morning, usually the rankings don't change
within 10hrs :).

	A special note to DND, it's not our fault that your site isn't in
the top11, we get votes from the top traders and sadly, the pnts gathered
for your site didn't qualify.

        A special note to Siteops, pele is a slowup cheating bastard, and
should not be allowed on anymore sites, and should be nuked from the ones
he is currently on.

TOP 10 sites are :

x3 MP -*- STH -*- FH -*- ET -*- FS
x2 NOS -*- LS -*- FOS -*- LA -*- TRM

Weektops for TRM/FS were not collected on time, sorry..we'll get it next
time =)

We Multiplied by 3 and 2 because the difference between them is less
than 1 and 2.

                                                                  -NWR Staff!

STATS BABY!
