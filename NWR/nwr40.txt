    Well well well, if I am not mistaken, the NWR webpage is either done right now
    or almost there, which means I have just gone and raped ndetroit and his lame 
    ass by getting the page done before he could code the mag. So I guess that
    means he sucks even more now. So the page will be up this week, you'll hear
    about it on all of our pages or at the next issue. This week is a normal week,
    all the usual shit, and we have Ryche filling in on editing because of fucking
    nd not showing up!@# Be sure and check out the Eternal log, as well as a 
    new jesspic! 

                                                   -lester

    Ok.. I suck... 
    NWR 40 is a couple days late, and it pretty much boils down to me not having
    my shit done.. I won't bore you with the details... ;p
    So... sorry to bud, prozac, ryche, sky, and lester.... but.. here it is.. 

    I can't fucking believe that we are at issue 40 already... I don't know
    if this is some kind of milestone, or what, but.... I think we will save our
    big birthday bash for issue 50, or something... ;)

    Jam-packed issue, full of pics and one hell of a funny log.. Prozac and bud
    are both here in full force, and sky represents.. ;p
    No stats this week, they will be back next week... 
    As for the coded mag vs. webpage... well... i don't see a page yet, so.. we'll
    see who wins that battle... *cough*

    Ryche is awesome, and did a lot of the work on the mag in my absence for this
    week, so my thanks goes out to him.... 
    take care all...

-----------[ ndetroit's sites and stats section ]-----------

    Helloooo..
    I'll get right to it...

    SS is back, as correctly reported in an NWR rumor of a few weeks ago..
  It's CORP EHQ right now, and has still not taken back MnM.. SS used to be
  MnM WHQ at one time (or was it just EHQ?.. i can't remember). Both ways
  it always was an interesting and private site, and i'm sure it will be top 10
  in no time.
    DMS picked up a whole shitload of new ppl this week, but they also picked
  up VDR Lame.. Not too sure *why*, but they did. So hooray for them, i guess.
    CAT (formerly rdx) went out and the phearsome..... VGN (!) affil for their
  site... That is more bizarre than anything, but hey, whatever floats your boat.
  I would have thought that they would have gone AMB, personally... But bones
  has done a hell of a job with that site since he kicked dee and hazzy... 
  Crystal, rzr, fcn affils... nice work.

    TT was kicked from OGN. TT kicked glen from staff. TT is back in OGN.
  
    Some new site named "FM" has picked up a LND affil. I don't even know what
  FM stands for, but its just another site in a long line of alphabet-soup no-namers
  that popped up the last week or so. Two others are DC (TPC HQ!), and SD (MnM, 
  DNG, uCF... dual grouping is cool!)... blah... dual grouping sites suck.

    AoD got the US site, DST... nice to hear.

    Fmud, after going something like 2 years without any affils finally broke
  down and got some this week. 
    
    MG is gonna be down until easter. It will be back up shortly afterwards. The
  userbase and stats and shit are all gonna still be there, the site just needs
  to be offline for a bit.

    TMS is down atm for a HW upgrade, should be back up this weekend, contact a
  siteop for more info.

    DOPE got kicked from OGN, for "excessive downtime"... OGN + AOD = pretty fun
  combination... <g>
    
    Thats about all i got for now. Lester wants me to release.... geez, i'm only
  4 days late... ;p



    NO STATS SECTION THIS WEEK, DUE TO LACK OF WEEKTOPS.. COURIERS: PLEASE COLLECT
  AS MANY WEEKTOPS AS YOU CAN, AND DCC THEM TO ME ON IRC... STATS SECTION WILL BE
  BACK NEXT WEEK, THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT!!!


-----------[ Lester's Biased Courier Section ]-----------

Biased Courier Report

What a week to review!#@


Dimension: Lots of pickups this week. Nutcase from EQL, VDRLake as EHQ,
Fain, and Kruzin from MNM. Now, some people have said this makes me a 
hypocrite, as it's been well documented by my own magazine that I rip on
the boy quite often. But you've noticed recently I haven't much, except
the move to MNM, as there really hasn't been much to make fun of. It's
been quiet for me :(. Our little Kruzin is all grown up and now I have 
to make fun of someone new, but fear not I will find someone. <g>
Anyhow..With all the pickups, DMS should look mighty nice coming
into the new week. Seems their comeback is for real.


Devotion: Norseman told me he would take down my boxes if DMS recruited 
any Dev boxes..how nice of him! hehehehehehehe Anyhow, normal week for them.
Godbless and Acidapple out and about, as well as stupid fake dir maker Garoto.
Now, this has gone on long enough, and in the beginning it was pretty funny 
and all. But it just seems like he's trying too hard to keep it going. This
needs to stop now Garoto, the joke has ended, you know how they say it's not 
good to beat a dead horse? Well this horse is decomposing.


AOD: Picking up DST as USHQ they continue to grab some nice sites and also 
maintain the steady support that AOD has come accustomed to. I must mention
that Glen has forgotten how much he was hated awhile back and so he feels 
need to pick on other people, I think that everyone who hated Glen and thought
he was a childish prick should msg him to remind him of this fact. One more 
thing, gooooooo cedric.


Risc: Read the enclosed eternal.txt so see how their leader views the scene.



VGN: Darkwolf is workin it baby. Ya you go boy! Jess dont forget to juggle
the balls a little too.


MNM: You lost Kruzin, sigh, now what?

Thazzit boys!

Prozac's Kinda Biased Gaming Report - #9

Ahh Carumba! It's already time for Issue #40?! The week has gone by fast for
me that I lost track that it was time to write my weekly report. If this
doesn't like my usual report, you've been warned. Lester & ND are on my
neck waiting to release the issue while I'm typing this issue. Hey, I'm
honest :) Anyway, this wee we saw Class come back out of nowhere with 4
games, the game TPC passed up but OGN didn't, and of course of the biggest
games of the month coming from RZR, X-Wing Alliance. Let's get going! We start
off with:

Class-
So, where they been hiding? Well they come back, but this is like the old
CLS of the past, unforunately. The game has some nasty protection, and
barely beat OGN on the game, only to find out when you play the game it
sounds like Chipmunks. Later on we see the highly acclaimed Triple Play
2000. Oh my, this just in! The euro equiv. of Quake 3 is out (in anticipation):
Championship Manager 3! Hey, anyone not in the states loves this shit. I find
it weird. They finish off the week with a couple more games. Everyone knows
about the contest(s), is this the reason why we're seeing more from CLS?
No, the people were there. It was just bad luck. Finally the cards are
falling for CLS. But could we be seeing the old CLS with messing up Triple
Play 2000? I always like to make people think, and make you answer the
questions. Yes, you, the reader.

Hot Releases:
Brian Lara Cricket - 46 disks
Triple Play 2000   - 49 disks
Jazz Jackrabbit 2: The Secret Files - 14 disks
Blood 2: Nightmare Levels - 30 disks
WWII G.I. - 10 disks
Championship Manager 3 - 49 disks


Paradigm-
Well the store team is going fast. They win on the new Talonsoft game, and
pick up Senior PGA Tour out of nowhere, thought some are crying foul since
the practice rounds had to be pulled to get it under 50. There have been
some signs that after the rush and domination of PDM, that things just might
be slowing down. The next coming weeks will be critical in seeing if PDM
can really maintain a stranglehold on the '99.

Hot Releases:
Battle Of Britian - 18 disks
Senior PGA Tour - 48 disks


Razor-
Ahhhh.. RZR. They release on a blue moon, they release with a vengence.
After the fuck-up of a cricket game, they come with us with the highly
acclaimed (and badly ripped) X-Wing Alliance. Weird, everything sounds
like a laser. Oh well, be sure to get the addons for it. But also, don't
hold your breath. Now that the truth is out that noone in RZR can crack
ISO protection, until they get a great cracker and a great supplier,
it'll be more ho-hum.

Hot Releases:
X-Wing Alliance - 38 disks


Origin-
Well, this group has been more fun to watch than a flea circus. First,
an OGN member puts out a game on their own WHQ, a game called Spooky
Castles. Now, you can go to www.egames.com, and download this game
for $10. The leader of TPC, Grind, said he was offered the game, and
turned it down, because of lack-of-quality. The supplier intended
for it to be put out iND (so they say), but instead it went out
under OGN label. When the seniors woke up and found out what happened,
they acted like the government: DENY EVERYTHING. They tried to say
it was a fake release, but when the proof was shown fellow OGN members
did release the game, they said it wasn't authorized. Hey, when you're
going to cover something up, come up with a good plan.

Next, OGN got beat on yet another UK title. The UK store team was
beat not once but twice by CLS, including a highly acclaimed title.
This doesn't mean it'll be the end of OGN, but what looked promising
is just not working out.

Hot Releases:
Rocky Horror Interactive Show - 27 disks


Other-
Ahh, TPC. This is the group you just want to love, but you can't. I mean,
I love these guys, they put out some good stuff. But they are just not
high quality stuff you see coming from this group. Heck, you're not even
seeing games from this group you'd see in EB. Well.. once in a while you
will. This doesn't mean they aren't trying for the big games. They just
don't have the organization or resources to put out the games.. yet.

Hot Releases:
Natuk - 10 disks
DemonStar v3.01 - 3 disks
Battle Board - 5 disks
Roids - 3 disks
Astroid Miner - 2 disks
Tunnel Blaster - 3 disks
Close Approach - 1 disk


Springer'ish Final Thoughts:
It seems that people get way too serious into some things of the scene,
and people should just lighten up. Yes, it might be a hobby. It might
be an obsession. But to me, I see this as a game. If you can't have
fun, don't stick around. We should all have fun, not be at each other
throats. We should cooperate, now integate. The egos of the scene,
especially in the gaming scene, need a diet, and the people who have
them, should get a reality check.

Bud's Biased Utils Report #14
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 As I write this I'm coughing up what seems to be a ton of flem... but as I
 missed out last week due to exams, I don't want to miss this week due to
 a simple cold. So, what did I miss out on last week? Well, XForce finally
 displayed some signs of life and released a few useful tools to the users.
 That was the first decent week XF has had in months, and I missed it! More
 LND troubles as well, they dominated the CAD/CAM field (looks as if they
 can actually do what they claim), but there were more accusations of
 release stealing brought forth. It appears as if this is happening every
 other week now, although there's a lack of proof with this latest acusation,
 and it basically faded out of the spotlight... alright enough of that, if 
 you were paying attention you know what went on, and if not, well, I'm not
 reviewing two weeks. Now on to this week.

 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 03/14/99 to 03/20/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.


 Groups: (In no particular order)
 
 ‹ ﬂﬂ€€‹ ‹        ‹      ‹
  ﬂ€‹ ﬂ€›ﬂ€‹ ﬁ  ‹€ﬂ  ‹‹€€› A Group
   ﬁ€› ﬁ› ﬁ€ €›ﬁ€› ‹€ﬂ  € That Gives

 PC.Maclan.4.0.for.NT.Cracked-PWA         [01 x 1.44MB]

 Here's something you don't see too often, PWA nuked for a dupe... of course
 there's plenty of things we did see from PWA this week, and most of them
 were good. Apollo was the dupe, but making up for it is Adobe Acrobat
 Capture, and some much requested keymakers for PC Maclan (which won't work
 if the computers communicating are using a copy with the same serials).
 Little Brother is a network monitor to check who's visiting what site from
 your network... catch your employee's leeching pirated software, pron etc.
 Of course if your using the PWA release and monitoring for that you're
 being a tad hypocritical.

 NINO.CONTACTS.V3.0-CORP                    [07 x 1.44MB]

 Corp just couldn't get Nino Contacts worked out this week. After requiring a
 repack, the app wasn't even working. They did get Zip-It v4.01 out, but it's
 sort of minor, in fact there hasn't been much activity from the Quarterdeck
 product line since Symantec bought them out, other than a new Cleensweep.
 Renderview is nice, and RX Scene Lite is a nice package (I had this program
 myself but RealAx screwed up my license, so I guess I'll use Corp's). Corp
 promised me lots of releases this week, it didn't really pan out that way,
 not too bad in the end.

 A couple of IMSI tools from RiSE this week (you know IMSI from TurboCAD,
 VisualCADD, and other middle of the road apps). Unfortunately, Year 2000
 Now, which retails at a ridiculous 80$ in my area (considering there are
 competitive products at much lower prices), was broken, which leaves me only
 TotalCAD to give points to.

 Lots to talk about here, Siege really came on strong last week, perhaps
 making up for some recent slow periods. Where to begin... newest version
 of Lotus Notes, no suprise there. Interesting to see them do Adobe Premiere
 RT, it's been out for some time (since December) and I'm honestly suprised
 that it hadn't been done sooner, after numerous people spoke to me about
 "getting" it, well SGE finally got the job done. The package was only
 available as part of a hardware/software bundle, and is an enhanced
 version of Premiere designed for developers working with Real Time video
 (hence the "RT"). Unfortunately it's extremely hardware dependent,
 compatible with only the Matrix Digisuite and Pinnacle Reel Time lines (so
 far as I know anyways). Next we come to Orcad Complete Suite 9, another
 impressive title... we also see the usual plugin fare, a minor version of
 Shake, re-releases of Transit and Term Star that were released last week and
 promptly nuked at SGE's request as unauthorized, and a release of Renoir
 that's been out for a while. Overall an excellent week.

 comment on that twice monthly Ultimate Toolbox. Oops, guess I just did. Oh
 well, the rest of the selection is pretty nice, and hopefully XF can keep
 this up in the weeks to come, and maybe start looking like the XF of old
 again (perhaps minus the textures this time 'round).

 Last time I reviewed, SHOCK won the week along with LND on the strength of
 their titles, well they don't have the name apps this week. A decent week
 nonetheless, Objective Studio 99, more RogueWave apps, the entire SaxSoft
 product line save one... Magellan, Jade and Freebird are decent Acrobat
 plugins, and as usual SHOCK putd out the 3D graphics app Nendo (they've done
 every version since SGE's 1.0), which is my favorite tool here. Too many
 minor versions however.

 I wasn't sure how to approach LND this week, but they made it pretty easy
 by releasing without contreversy (a nice change), with no fuckups other than
 a missed license. As with beta's, a Pre-release won't get full points as,
 when you get right down to it, it's the same shit - not a final. With a few
 exceptions via releases from RiSE and SGE, they dominated CAD this week.

 A so-so week for PRM, they had two nukes that I didn't list here, for
 Know2000 2.0 and Doga L1/L2 99. Perfect Partner is an accounting system for
 businesses and not dating/match making software as was first rumored <g>.
 For the other titles... new version of ERS 98, don't switch from an old one
 unless you're having any major problems... more CD Runner tools, and JFroge,
 which stands out as the best tool of the group in my eyes.

 two for me, I don't have any use for workgroup manager. ;) Not a whole lot
 else to say, quality is a lot more important than quantity, and DOD gives an
 excellent example of that here.

 even look at the cracking side of MFD this week, but a good showing here.

 After some internal restructuring, VRS comes back with a strong week

 beta, and a program called Video Savant which I've never used but which
 seems decent enough. So I guess that internal restructuring worked.

 having a slow period, they managed to avoid dupes and crap, and more
 importantly, I haven't come across anything but kind words for them, sime
 hopefully they can keep it together. As for the releases, those of you
 running firewalls should definately make Cyberguard Firewall a
 consideration, it's not one of my strong areas, but I've heard good things
 from those running it.

 Norton.Antivirus.5.01.01.For.WindowsNT-2000AD     [04 x 2.88MB]

 Good job on Norton AV for Lotus notes, 5.01.01 I'm not sure of, someone said
 it was the same as DOD's 5.01, I'm happy with the version I have so I don't
 plan on switching soon to check. FilterCad and Sandra 99 are nice releases,
 CallCenter, on the other hand, sucked (at least it did to me). Lotus betas
 in there were alright, at least they weren't Notes/Domino betas.

 Ok well I have to give FCN credit, they always write excellent, explanatory
 NFO's, and saved me some work... the difference between DSI's Ulead Video
 Studio and FCN's was missing features and ummm missing effects which
 probably should have stayed missing. I'll stick with DSI's for size reasons,
 if you're seriously into playing with your home movies and capturing your
 friends doing crappy amature acting then adding effects, get the full thing.
 Other releases include Woll2Woll's InfoPower Pro (a newer version came 
 out just a few days after the FCN release, Woll2Woll updates far too often),
 and new versions of Multilizer for all platforms.

 Pinguin.Audio.Meter.v2.1-Radium [01 x 1.44MB]

 Well where to begin... Radium brings out a few tools this week, probably
 the most popular will be SoftMC, which gives users real time midi control
 and other features. Making Waves is the only other release here I'm familiar
 with, with it you get a decent sample sequencer allowing you to create loops
 from .wav files. I would have liked to see these guys do the latest Audio
 Grabber release, however they have a price limit (I think 80$ is the
 cheapest they'll release, I could be mistaken, but it's around that).

 New this week: None

 Idle this week: PNC, SDM.

 Quote(s) of the Week: 

 "It was an honor just to be nominated." <-- Quoted by dozens of the LOSERS at
                                             the Oscars (and is a total LIE!).

 In writing this, I realized that there are now 20 groups on this list, a
 figure that astounds me, as there are still a ton of groups who aren't on
 it, some which may even deserve to be. But for the next while anyways, I'm
 not making any new additions, as 20 is too much as it is. Looking back, I
 noticed that RCN never had more than around 10 groups on its charts (and
 even that number is probably high, and only in the later issues did it get
 near that, my memory sucks and I don't feel like loading one up), and I
 don't remember Jimmy Jamez's report having more than 5 or 6 groups. The
 utils scene has grown a lot since then, we have groups specializing in
 Audio, Programming, Graphics, CAM/CAD... this is more reminiscing than
 whining about the amount of writing it takes, in case you were wondering...
 what it leads down to is this: Is the utils scene of today superior or
 inferior to that of say, 4 years ago. I'm undecided on this myself, I was a
 little less active in those days, but in the same breath I used more of the
 releases then. I'm curious as to what any readers might think... hmm Black
 Acid or Union should run a poll on this maybe.

 No interview this week, I simply didn't have time, and felt like shit...
 seems every time I get free time on my hands I end up catching a fucking
 cold. Of course during finals I'll be perfectly healthy.

 Give the week to SGE... they're really the only group that impressed me with
 more than one or two titles. Congrats to XF for finally proving that
 there's still some life in the group. Till next week.... someone find me
 VCD leech!!

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 


Lock, Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels
Starring: British guys
Rating: 3 1/2 Stars


Well this is a british film that has been out for some time, but just now
into the United States. This movie is extremely funny and well written.
It's about these 4 guys who end up being in debt 500,000 dollars to the 
Porn King(no not xavier), and they have one week to come up with it. The
story is about them trying to settle the debt and it's great. I recommend it
to everyone, unfortunately we won't see a VCD of this unless someone does
a screener because it came out a long time ago when it was popular in
Britain.


----------

EDTV
Starring: Matthew Macoughney(wtf), Woody Harrelson, Jenna Elfman, Ellen
Rating: 3 Stars

Well, I hit up the sneak preview of this film on Saturday and it runs almost
exactly two hours. It feels longer though, as it is a grindingly slow film.
Not to say it's not funny or worth watching, but it just kind of drags along.
The story is about a guy being put on TV 24/7. And no matter who you put on
tv, there's gonna be some dull parts<g>. So we sit through the dull and the 
funny. In the end it is a funny film and worth the matinee price but maybe 
not full admission.

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

Telesync/TS: Telesync is a procam on a tripod in an empty theater with  
usually a separate audio source. If there's an audience, you hear
people coughing,  camera is shaky, etc. It's a CAM. CAM = banned.
If you want a movie extremely early, Telesync is the way it will be.

Workprint: Workprint is a pre-release copy of a movie, stolen copy, etc. 
that usually has the film running time on the screen.

Screener: Screener is usually the BEST quality, an actual vcd of the movie, 
made from a reviewers copy, etc. Screener's are generally released after 
movies have left the theaters.

Ryche's Really Biased VCD Group Report #8

<X-Frog> What's an .iso?

<StarBurst> Garoto invites Elvis_and_7_Naked_Dwarves to #xxxxxxxx


I decided to update the group report this week to go from Monday to Monday
so that it would be a little more up to date by the time you read it. This 
week Ill backtrack to the releases I missed by changing the report times so 
this one will cover about 10 days instead of 7 and next week we'll be back 
on track.

Pretty decent week (10 days) for VCD, lot of releases and alot of things
that you, the downloading public, should know.


Releases from 3/14/99 to 3/22/99

031599 - Meet Joe Black - Telesync - VCD-HOLLAND
031799 - Office Space - Telesync - IGN

[NUKED] - The Other Sister - Telesync - IGN (Incomplete)
[NUKED] - Analyze This - Cam - ExL
[NUKED] - Arlington Road - Workprint - KRAVEN

- IGN -

Had a respectable week by actually releasing. This group doesnt release
often but when it does theres usually something wrong. The Other Sister
looks decent if you like retards in love which seems to be a theme in Hollywood
this year, only problem is IGN never completed it on any fucking sites.  Office
Space is the hillarious comedy from Mike Judge (Beavis and Butthead) but the 
Telesync looks like shit. Watchable, but not recommended.

Total - 1 Point

- VCD-Holland -

Thier first release as far as I know (they'll probably msg me after this is
published to  tell me they've released 100 things no one knows about, but
fuck 'em). MJB was released once before as a Telesync but it was in raw .dat
format and was nuked. This is the "New and Improved" (yay) TS.

Total - 1 Point

- TFAiSO - 

Now they've decided to come out of the closet. Since this one is actually good 
quality and a new movie, I guess they decided to release under thier real name 
instead of VHS. Too bad your cover was blown long ago by NWR. Deep End of the
Ocean is a Michelle Phiefer tear-jerker. If she's not in a leather cat-suit,
I dont want to see it.

Total - 2 Points

- Kraven -

Ahhh, Kraven. The group who stepped up and took Centropy's place as my
favorite group to smash on. Kraven actually had 2 wildly popular releases 
this week. The first which I just HAVE to mention <G> was the Arlington 
Road Workprint. This is the terrorist bomber moves into the neighborhood flick
with Tim Robbins that looks great from the previews. Kraven smoked it out this
week with blazing speed and in the blink of the eye was nuked because the
fucking shit was un-goddamn-watchable! The encoding was bad, was blurry, 
was blocky, was dark, was stupid. The quality on 200 Cigarettes workprin
isnt much better but at least you can tell the people from the scenery.

Total - 1 Point

- PMTVCD - 

These guys acted like a real fucking group this week. 4 releases in 4 days. Im 
impressed. 3 of the 4 are first run movies, with Elizabeth being notable because
of its academy award nominations (did this shit win anything?) and its high 
praise. October Sky is about a guy who wants to become an astronaut.. His hopes,
his dreams.. oh boy. At First Sight is where Val Kilmer's blind and cant see what 
a fox Mira Sorvino is. It goes on from there. Monument Ave. is some Irish gangster
crap that looks like a video release.

Total - 4 point

- ExL -

Excellence? Not even. This group released a CAM of Analyze This. Which in itself 
is not bad because they had the sense enough to label it a cam. What happened next,
was not thier fault, but Im going to mention it because sites and traders really 
fucked this one up. Some smart trader out there knows a CAM (bad sound, shaky
picture, audience) will be nuked. What does he do? Renames it TS and moves it t
topsites. Now we have uninformed nukers and sites who think, oh TS, np.. when 
actually its a crappy cam. EVEN SAYS IN THE NFO! Type: Crappy Cam. Once again, 
traders never cease to amaze me.

Total - 0 Points (It wasn't thier fault tho)


There's some good stuff in this weeks crop of releases, so I won't bash on too
many points. PMTVCD wins this week for number of releases and selection of first
run movies. IGN tried to release a couple of semi-watchable telesyncs, TFAiSO 
decided to stop hiding behind the VHS tag, and Kraven should be tied up, beaten,
and drug from behind a moving car. If I missed anyone, its because you suck in 
general and were not worthy. :)


                                                          Start the madness..
                                                               Ryche

-----------[The Scene News]-----------


-ok bitches, i'm back, and i'm back and i'm black and i'm bad, and
 i'm black. Sit down, it's time you were owned:

-Well, the big contest is going strong, and class put out a couple of
 decent releases finally. As prozac said tho, TP2000 may or may not have been
 ass-fucked, so... who knows.. If its a tight race, who will be the judge?
 And i also wanna know, SERIOUSLY, what constitutes being a "good promoter"?
 Do i still have a chance, chinablu?  ;p

-I've ragged on just about every group out there, and i think that *this* time
 the ragging will be fully saved for D M S.... which is pronounced "sellout".
 Come on guys? KRUZIN?? You can't be serious.. ;p
 After all the shit he has pulled, after all the shit LESTER has said about him?
 Does lester really want riscftp that badly?? blah... maybe they should pick up
 psi, and get a dmsftp coded... after all, risc has riscftp, dev has nftp, eql
 has pftp, and ..... and mnm has.... riscftp!
 bah.. i remain unimpressed. 
 Its too bad that eternal is such a nob, or i might have had something nice to
 say about RiSC..... ... ... or not.. ;p

-VF has been k-lined for good. Busted, apparently.

-Blackacid's page has a pretty decent stash of all the old NWR's..
 tca.ramwar.com, for that... Also check out prozac's page at ppgr.webjump.com..
 Both of them usually have NWR posted a few mins after it gets released...
 And both of them are DEFINATELY faster than RHQ @ union.jaded.net... Man..
 whatever happened to that page? ;p

-Group moves: kruzin to DMS (*cough*), weeze to dms, nutcase to dms, dthangel
 to DMS, kobe bryant to DMS for alkivar and a 1st round draft pick, weeze to 
 mfd from pgc, evel joined DMS, Kirkhamm to RiSE, toth didn't retire, moonsabre
 to DMS, and insanity to DEV from EQL.

-So the NWR Webpage is almost done... hrmm... we have been promising this since..
 since about... issue 12 or so... and its issue 40 now.. so thats like... 28 
 weeks... plus the 2 months this summer that ndetroit was dead for... so.. it
 only took lester 8 months to get the web page up! thats some nice work, lester.
 Of course, ndetroit has been promising us a coded version for about that long,
 and uhhh.... this shit still looks like .txt to me, so... lester wins!!

-That whole glftpd scandal is still going on. Greyline wrote a response, ndetroit
 says he sticks by the article, greyline says its not... siteops, i guess its up
 to you... have fun kiddies.. i'm sticking with wu-ftpd... *cough*

-I guess a couple of OGN pres to TT were stolen by glen (TT staff), and he
 was actually dumb enough to upload to OGN HQ's before OGN could... hahaha..
 Needless to say, i hear there were more than a few OGN ppls that were slightly
 pissed off... OGN kicked TT for that bullshit, but then TT woke up and said to
 itself "oh wait, our site sucks, OGN is the only good thing we have going for
 us", and it kicked glen from staff, so i guess everything is all yippy-skippy
 now.

-Blood 2 has the CIH virus, apparently..... .... heh.. how poetic... ;p

-COREUtils put out a big PHAT 300 mb release of Office2000 Premium Final this
 week, but rumors abound that its actually Final Beta, which makes sense, since
 we all know whose MS insider gets the REAL goods... And for all you ppl bitching
 about the size of that one... well... i seem to recall that PWA's Office97 was
 something like 300 megs too, and i know a LOT of siteops that may have nuked it
 at the time, but later went back and leeched it for their archives... ;p

-Kruzin, kruzin, kruzin.... he left MnM, but forgot to take his cheat scripts
 with him!... hahahaha... now riscftp is in the hands of his ex-group, Millenium,
 after they repossed his shell.. 
 Check this:
 <|Eternal|> glen we can track riscftp ..heh and lemme tell you
  what will happen to those boxes =)
 <glen> track ?
 <BlackAcd> |Eternal|, hardly eternal
 <glen> you put some kind of homing device
 <BlackAcd> its gonna be cracked before they use it
 <BlackAcd> well
 <glen> on riscftp ? EHEHE
 <BlackAcd> mnm is quite dumb
 <BlackAcd> so
 <|Eternal|> blackacd exactly =)
 <glen> it does have to be cracked though
 <BlackAcd> i doubt they;'ll even realize u gotta crack it first :)P
 <BlackAcd> riscftp has a host checking feature glen
 <|Eternal|> glen i told mossyoak to delete it before i had to do
  something
 <BlackAcd> if its on a box thats not on the host list, it either
  doesnt work or it mails ssomeone
 <|Eternal|> the only person who ever cracked riscftp we made an 
 agreement with him never to do it again
 <|Eternal|> mnm will be dieing off soon
 <|Eternal|> i have big plans for mossyoak =) 
 
 Mossyjoke, if i seem to recall correctly, eternal also "had big plans" for 
 a little site we like to call "TCD"... run away mossy, run awaaaaayyy!!!

Ahh yes, rumors, we all love them even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us. And these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, your name will not be included, but we
do not add rumors like that say "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion"
because we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore
there is no hard evidence of that rumor, so if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!
