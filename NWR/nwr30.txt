    Welcome to Issue #30. And this is our Year in Review of 1998, but also 
    we have the usual installments of our reports.  So enjoy, and the few 
    of you who seem to think NWR is ruining the scene. Give it up, we are 
    the comic relief and guidance to the old and new scene. (And no, I 
    have no delusions of grandeur), So enjoy and please continue to read 
    the mag into 1999.

-----------[ ndetroit's sites and stats section ]-----------


    Ok... I have been hearing a lot of siteops out there talking shit
  in channels, etc, cause they think that their site should be on the
  list, or rated higher, or whatever... Uhh.. to them, i have to say
  a great big: FUCK YOU..

    I don't give a shit what sites you think yours is better than. 
  
    We'll leave it at..  ;)
    On to the news.. 
    Well, i guess the biggest news of the week definately has to be that
  HADES is back up, on a phat EURO link (i miss the old US HADES!!)  ;]
  This time around its called Hades On Earth. (HOE, for all you slow ppl
  out there!)
    Not only is it back, but it has a good bunch of affils already, 
  including CLASS, PNC, and DMS... It doesn't take a genius to figure
  out that this site will be on our list soon enough.. 

    The famous US site H2 was narked earlier this week.. All the gruesome
  details are readily available on union or bacid's page. This site really
  meant a lot to a lot of the scene, and ppl are understandably upset about
  it going down. At the time of its demise, H2 was CLS USHQ, PFT USHQ, PGC 
  USHQ, and DMS.. In addition its ISO affils were MnMISO, RiSCISO, and 
  KALiSTO.. R. i. p.

    New US site: TDi, The Desert Inn. ENT, UCF, and RVT HQ. uhh.. contact
  the siteop to be added.
    PB picked up the 2000ad EHQ spot..
    According to union's page, rzr dropped xqz cause "the siteops smoke
  crack..."... uhhh... since when has that been a bad thing?   ;p
    Ummm.. last week i said smth about "TDP having lame affils".. well,
  i originally hadn't intended to say that uCF is lame (!), but i guess
  that it was worded confusingly... Anyways.. after the huge amount of
  bitching that ucf did, i would just like to clear things up and say
  "YES, UCF IS LAME! EVERYONE IN UCF IS LAME! ALKIVAR, YOU ARE LAME!"
  hehehe...   ;)
    Btw, turns out TDP's affils aren't all lame: they have FUTURE as
  their curry affil, and FTR rocks.. ;) (hi pd!)
    TG dropped ENT, and picked up the PFT USHQ affil. I saw someone in a
  channel the other day trying to say that TG was faster than TD now..
  Uhhh.. no. Not even close. TD and TV are the two fastest US sites. Too
  bad most of TD's affils are so lame.. ;p
    PPL tell me that affils matter to them, that they would never trade
  to a site with no affils.... Why is VDR so good then? Will it last?
    I don't think so. VDR was awesome when it was up.. But, at the time
  it was up, it had the BEST affils in the scene. The site is living off
  of it's reputation right now.. Or is it?... Since it came up, it has
  been getting faster, and FASTER.. maybe x3 next week, i dunno.. That
  would really say a lot about the site, making x3 with NO AFFILS..
  Bleh.. who knows.. ;p
    If you are running a site called "The Sadistic Grandaughter", then i
  think that you need to seek some professional help.. I am afraid to
  even ask for a login to that site... reminds me too much of family 
  reunions.. ;/
    STH is not a PRM site, as someone in this mag reported last week,
  tho i have had ppl tell me that they have seen local mput's go there,
  so who can explain this crazy crazy world.. ;)
    I didn't get very many weektops this week, so the Top 10 is kinda 
  crappy.. only 6 sites represented... so... sorry if it sucks.
        
  
=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. 
	Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... 
heh... fuck off and die..
=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=

          The Top Ten sites for this week are:

Lester's Biased Courier Report


h0h0, trading again this new week, wtf is wrong with me..let's see whats 
wrong with everyone else!


Dimension: Wishmaster, a week after Godbless leaving to join Devotion, 
has followed suit, leaving some to wonder if DMS is in some trouble. 
But, considering I have good sources in this group, I am told that DMS 
is quite fine and will be back to it's normal self in no time. Time will 
tell! Already this week they have picked up the reincarnated Hades
(now Hades On Earth).

Devotion: Devotion has exploded in 99, grabbing some big traders and 
getting some of the old guys back in action. They are the team to beat 
right now.

AOD: Picking up Glen from the sinking ship that is MNM, AOD continues to 
impress me with their lack of political bullshit and continous trading.

MNM: Aye, the boat is sinking. All those people that MNM picked up..are 
jumping from the ship faster than you can say Mossyjoke. Glen, Zeus21, 
Bizzybone, and a bunch of other ppl i can't think of right now, have 
jumped to other groups or just IND to get out of MNM. 

Risc: Rumor has it that even the Risc staff is admitting to the fact that 
Risc is in REAL trouble and they do not seem optimistic about the future. 
I've been saying it all along, Risc is goin down.

VGN: The return of Jess has only led to Semaj being removed, other than 
that, there is no noticeable difference in VGN's performance.


The best things about this week are the MNM happenings, check out our 
log of Glen/Mossyoak..:)

-----------[ Prozac's Kinda Biased Gaming Report]-----------
            
Prozac's Kind of Biased Gaming Report - Jan. 3rd - to Jan 8th. - #4

Ugh, don't you hate slow months? I warned you all before before in the past 
and its true. It seems nothing but the unknown and missed holiday games are 
coming out. You should expect this to be true for a couple more weeks. Just 
bear with it and just keep telling yourself, "It will get better... I will 
not be bored!"
This week the day I'm writing this report CLS tears it up with 3 games
(not withstanding the critics!), while the rest just release update patches.
Also this week Razor dupes CLS on a game (since it's a dead month, I'll go
into detail why it was a dupe). To top it off, were now seeing groups duping
on patches! (CLS & RZR each duped PDM once). Let's take a look at each group,
with some side comments.

Class-
As typical of CLS they came out with 3 games, all on one day. I've heard 
nothing but grumbling of "Typical CLS". Hey people, its JANUARY. One of 
the SLOWEST months of the year. The scene should be glad they get some 
games out! Interestedly, the most complaining is coming from OGN who has 
yet to produce in '99 (except a trainer!). Anyway, CLS will keep producing 
more games, count on it ;)

Hot Releases:
BattleCruiser 3000AD v2.0 - 20 disks
Rising Star - 37 disks
Eat This - 46 disks


Paradigm- The crackers for this group must be bored. They've been doing all
the newest patches yet the suppliers are kicking back and drinking 40's.
A lot of rumbling and grumbling are being heard from Camp PDM and it's not
good. PDM better keep everyone entertained and be a little bit more productive
or they might take off to a group that get things done. Maybe things will
change when Driz & Germans come back from partying.

Hot Releases:
N/A

Razor- Beck has been messaging me all week saying that Extreme Tennis was not
a dupe, and CLS shouldn't of had sites nuke the release. The game that CLS is
saying RZR duped on was a game we put on in Sept. 98 called Tie Break Tennis
made by Hammer Technologies, based in Spain. These people ALSO made Extreme
Tennis, PUBLISHED BY Head Games/Activision. We downloaded both games and the
gameplay is exactly the same, except different intro screens. RZR broke
rule 8 of The Faction:

  8.  In regard  to games  distributed  in the  United States  that are LATER
      distributed in Europe  or vice versa under  the same or different name /
      publisher.  These games if released AFTER another group's  release are
      counted  as DUPES  unless it can  be  proven that  there  is  a clearly
      noticeable PLAYABLE  difference in the latter release (eg. new  levels,
      enhanced graphics, or other new features).

Nothing new = Dupe. RZR also duped PDM on a patch they cracked a month ago.
Hello!? Ever hear of a dupe list? Does anyone in RZR ever log on to any ftp
sites besides their own? Apparently not. This is not the first time RZR has
done this due to poor research.

Hot Releases:
Extreme Tennis - 14 disks (DUPE)

Origin- It's '99. OGN claims they will own this year, yet the only games to 
come out this year have been from CLS. Cypher keeps going off that they will 
really truly own the WORLD now with DVNiSO at its side [to help fund]. 
Hey, I will say this again; I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR HUGE EGOS. 
As a true cliche that really matters in the scene, actions speak louder 
than words. I think in the UK they are taught in grade school how to grow 
an ego because most UK people I've met in the scene cop a big one. OGN has 
the team, now they need to use it. OGN was also going off about the quality 
of the CLS games. Hey OGN, I have several logs of OGN people asking Principal 
to pick up Rising Star FOR OGN. Sigh, a group operated by hypercritics. I 
liked it how they are desperate for attention and post the Myth 2 trainer 
on AGN3D.COM. 

Hot Releases:
N/A

Divine- I'm starting to lose faith in this group. If I don't see some
production soon from this group, I'm going to ax it from my weekly report.
Hey! Hey you! Yeah you! Go get more of those 3D Maze games OGN has wisely
passed up sitting at stores! Lets see some life, or just close shop! My
ultimatum: no releases by issue #32, I clump this group under "Other" 
(more to come in later issues).

Hot Releases:
N/A

Springer'ish final thoughts:

With the new year here, it's already asking who will dominate. Who will fold.
In '98 we saw the end of HBD, and the start of OGN. ISO's became a huge part
of the scene. In '99, people are already starting to mold what the future of
the scene will be become. Some are convinced that the end of rip scene is
coming, and that it'll be ISO. What are my predictions? That ISO will keep
growing, and that one major group will at least fold up 1999. But ultimately,
everyday is a new day. We can never truly predict the future and it's true in
the scene. But with ADSL & Cable becoming more and more available, we should
see games getting to the scene faster including rips & full CD'S.

 Bud's Biased Utils Report #6
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Here we are back on schedule! I hope... =) 

 I'd like to thank Union for posting Report #4 on his site when NWR was
 delayed. So go visit union.jaded.net - now! (ok read the report first).

 Hmmm... anyways I don't exactly have much of an intro planned this week,
 so... ummm... the first full week of 1999 started with a bang, just go read
 the damn thing.
                             
 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 01/03/98 to 01/09/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.

 Groups: (In no particular order)

 PIRATES WITH ATTITUDE:

 Extensis.Intellihance.Pro.v4.01-PWA [03 x 1.44MB]
 
 I think maybe these guys read my report and decided to get their asses
 in gear... ok well maybe not, but they did release this week. Which is
 nice to see... except their Corel Draw beta was over the limit, which bought
 it a nuke on quite a few sites (and was later ripped as an IND). Infinite
 Voice is a nice release though, and they they threw in an Extensis app for
 good measure. PWA shows they still have what it takes - or so it seems for
 now.

 Alright I'll admit it.. I'm a huge DOS fan. I miss that damn OS so
 much, and I was very happy to see the Y2K compliant DOS 2000 come
 out. So congrats to Corp for doing it even if it is a bit of a throwback
 (hey I'm nostalgic). For the rest... Asymetrix titles are always nice, and
 ProVenture... well the current ProVenture series (Brochures, Database, 
 Mail List and others) has been on the shelf for a while... 2.01 just
 contains a bug-fixed 2.0, but it's still legit. The only title I'm not
 really familar with here is Pantone Color Web Pro, since I don't do
 a whole lot of grapic work, but even without that Corp had a strong week.
 Corp is really starting to look like the group of old - the strong, quality 
 Corp that is. They've also done a LOT of recruiting recently, and it shows 
 with more activity as a result. Good work with the Corel Print Office and 
 the MS.

 Rise releasing for the second straight week! They started it off with
 a pretty nice Seagate app... they also put out the Alpha platform version
 of Pro Mechanica, which unfortunately was nuked since most people use
 the Intel (which Rise released the previous week). So I can only give
 points for the Seagate. Unfortunately that was all the activity this
 week. But I still love you guys! ;)

 Fuck.. I can tell already that this is gonna be a hard week to score.
 SGE takes Digital Fusion 2.5 final (NT compositing software which will
 be popular with the graphics crowd I'm sure), and Character Studio for
 3DSMAX - one of the most popular addons for 3DSMAX (made by Kinetix, 
 who makes 3DSMAX itself). I've seen the end results of Character Studio 
 and I was pretty damn impressed (this comes from someone with almost no
 artistic inclination). Outside of that it was a fairly average week for
 the SGE team.

 YES!!! The first Ultimate Toolbox of the year!!! Only 23 more to go :P
 Another FotoSync build - the version is new though. TurboTax98 H/B is a bit
 nicer, but limited to American users. Which is fine, taxes are a bitch, but
 I'll never give a high score for tax software. Finally XF RealProducer
 Plus G2, only a few MONTHS after PGC released it. XF claims theirs is
 a final... well I never had a problem with the earlier release.

 week for the SHK crew quality wise overall... they boomed on Thursday,
 releasing 5 apps. The Informed series from Shana Corp was definately the
 highlight of the week for them, and they put out another Sun Micro app as
 well as the lastest MetaInfo tool. As usual not bad overall, but not
 enough to take the lead.

 Hmmm.. Entity released this week... but not much, and they're going
 to have to do a lot more to really stay in the race. My January
 comment still stands - this month will show whether ENT really has
 it in them. In the middle of the week Redux had some weird spat with
 Entity and dropped them, then promptly took them back... beats me. 
 Release more guys.

 Wow! PFT really exploded on the this week, doing some great apps in the
 process. They did pick up some nukes for the MS and IBM releases, as well as
 for the betas (I do count betas but never as high as a final), but the good
 outweighs the bad in this case. Cleensweep 4.1 Deluxe has been in stores for
 a bit, and PFT took advantage and grabbed it. Quickbooks Pro 99 was another
 great edition to their resume this week. A lot of DIZ fixes this week - learn
 how to fill em out, it's not hard. Still an excellent week though (I don't
 deduct for DIZ fixes).

 LND beat all other groups to ripping the Voice XPress ISO, and were
 even kind enough to include the ISO group's serial. They also put out a
 version of Pro Mechanica which they claim is several months newer than the
 one Rise put out recently. I haven't compared the two (and probably won't,
 to be honest it isn't worth the download time). ARCServeIT is the bright
 spot here.

 Well here we have the most activity from PNC that we've seen in quite a
 while. Even last week, when they did alright, they weren't at this level.
 To be honest I was very suprised that they did this well - but a lot of
 groups suprised me this week. There's a lot of nice Enterprise level
 apps in there, including the overly expensive (imo) Netegrity Site Minder.
 So in the end PNC is up two points from the last time round.

 PRM had a nice week this week, especially compared to the contreversy of the
 last one. No nukes, no dupes, nothing questionable - these are the weeks
 that show they are a good releasing team, even if they didn't get any of
 the major titles this week. I hemmed and hawwed and finally settled on
 and 7/10, considered an 8 and stuck with the 7. They still had a nice
 week, with some decent apps.

 Well even DOD got into it this week, with their first titles of 1999. 
 So congrats guys and welcome to the new year! As usual I hate the Novell
 rule so the nuke on the Netware AV doesn't hold here. (It's not even made
 by Novell - do you nukers even know the reason for the rule I wonder?). The
 DOS/OS2 I'm a little more iffy about... but I'm still a bit nostalgic over the
 DOS thing so I'll let it slip. Not so for the OS2 (tried it and hated it).
 They also got out a Symantec app.. which is great cuz DOD does way to many
 antiviral apps. A couple more releases towards the end made this the most
 active week DOD has had in a while.

 In any other week this showing could have been considered great, this
 week I can only call it average.

 nothing major... plus they saw a few nukes, and as usual they did
 far too many minor versions. TurboCad Pro 6 stands out amongst the crowd
 as a very nice title however.

 ACE makes its debut in the report this week. They've been around
 for a little while, and had their ups and downs. The current group
 seems fairly strong and they put forth a good effort this week. Some
 decent titles, although the Linux is discounted points wise. The only
 down side is Avanti Journal 1.4, which SHK released in January 98. :P
 But for the most part they did alright.

 Verus has turned from a cheesy small app/crack group into a half
 decent Utils release crew. They haven't got any major titles, but
 they've managed fairly well to avoid junk, and I'd give them a most
 improved group award of some sort if there were any. They got five
 titles this week, all average stuff... not a lot else to say. They
 earned a spot on this list, so congr

 Quote(s) of the Week: 

 <Prozac-> You know i've always had an idea of taking normal ad slogans, 
           and make them sexual.. and sell them on shirts. First idea was
           "I love my carpet ;)"

 <XXXXXXXXX> New UTILS dir on 'e' - 'Hot.Off.The.Web.III-PREMiERE' created
             by 'godbless'
 <Bud-> oh god another hot of the web app :P
 <[eX]> hrmm is this a release ?
 <[eX]> or are they just comenting on who their main supplier is ?

 Woah another tough one to score. Tuesday alone saw enough decent utils to
 almost make a week by itself. This is one of those times where a single
 big name, high-quality release can really make a difference, since almost
 every group did some nice apps. In the end I felt CORP and PFT really
 put forth the best effort... but thats not to downplay the performance
 of many of the other groups who did well. The utils side of the scene 
 really made up for the lull in games this past week (with the exception of
 CLS's work on Saturday). Lets hope it can keep it up. (And lets hope for
 at least one decent game soon as well :P).

 Scum finally released their first title as a reborn group after the
 end of the week. Expect to see them in next weeks report... the first
 release did not go smoothly though, they wound up racing PFT and lost
 on most sites. But at least their releasing, after so much talk it's
 about time we saw some action.

 That wraps it up for this week... lets all hope next week is this good.

=---------[ Lesters Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 



A Civil Action
Starring: John Travolta, Robert Duvall, William H. Macy
Rating: 3 out of 4 stars.

Well, I am not a John Travolta fan, but I am a big Duvall and Macy fan, 
so I went in expecting this to be a really good movie, and I was not 
really disappointed, but I didn't consider it to be one of the 10 best of
1998. John Travolta is a lawyer in a small firm, who takes on a huge food 
chain(defended by Robert Duvall) in the contamination of water supply in a 
small town that has led to 8 childrens deaths.
The best parts of this film are when Duvall and Travolta are paired off. 
The story is not as good as I feel it could have been if certain things 
were explored, and I have heard that the book is much more in depth. But 
movies can only be so long I guess. I do recommend seeing this and checking 
it out. If nothing else but for the stars performances.

 news... or don't read mine.. i don't give a shit.. I am leaving the

 Its gonna be sort of a "hackers" style movie, only its gonna be called

-As far as i can tell, RiSC is still being run by monkeys.. 

-The NBA is back. HADES is back... Coincidence? i think not. 

-in a weird turn of events, garflozzy was kicked from DEV, because the
 original vote on him was considered "invalid", as their weren't enough
 DEV ppl there at the time. Garflozzy then retired. As the main NWR artist,
 we are sad to see garflozzy go.. (Even if he did say that "NWR sucks" on 
 bacid's page!) His work is featured on many sites and nfo's out there. 

-Do my eyes decieve me??? Is that TECH of RTS trading again? good lord,
 i think that i need to lay down for a while..

-group moves: wishmaster to DEV, vylent left MnM for EQL, zeus21 left MnM
 for EQL, geno to AoD, madboy to AoD, SJ to RNS (the mp3 group?), powertool
 to iCT, _-zeus-_ to iCT, cablegod to KAC, aldog to PRM, glen to AoD, 
 garflozzy retires, and the grizzlies signed abdur-rahim to a multi-year deal.

-Equality with a few nice pickups this week, but still can't be beat by

--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors, we all love them even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us. And these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, your name will not be included, but we
do not add rumors like that say "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion"
because we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore
there is no hard evidence of that rumor, so if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!


-Rumor has it that a certain tandem of former Utils super-powers are set
 to re-unite and kick some ass. One is a former (retired) trading legend.
 The other person is a very active scene member. Together they will form
 a team of such awe-inspiring power that one utils group leader upon hearing
 the news could only say "oh shit... fuck.. shit... thats gonna be hard to
 beat.."... people are running scared..

-Rumor has it that all those pics of jess that tdpriest has been leaking to
 NWR are actually picture of MANDRAKE!!!!!!.... but wait... wouldn't that..
 wouldn't that make tdpriest... GEORGE, mandrake's GAY LOVER?!?!?!?!!!??

-Rumor has it that MSV is set to come back.. No word on affils yet.
