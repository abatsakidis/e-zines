Well well well! It is Tuesday night, and my partner is no where to be found. Do I sense a new story brewing over his disappearance? 
It could be, anyways I have decided to plug on without him. Enlisting the efforts of The Dark Priest, our resident photographer and 
undercover reporter, as well as former editor before I was more than just a lowly biased writer. Special thanks to Duranged for the 
weektops and please checkout the article regarding CWS and the hiatus they will be taking. Thanks for being patient and if the issue 
looks like shit. Well fuck you because it's not my job to edit this bitch! We also include a text file of Kenzo talking! Quyetone 
with a reform on her Courier's Unite text from last week. The CWS farewell also. AND! A log of Machv admitting to using linfxp.
If the characters for your screen are too long then FUCKING DIE. Just turn on wordwrap!
- Lester [Fucking Solo Editor]

[Ryche    ] I feel like a real member of staff now, my reports late :D

<nutcase-> u have to kick him b4 i do

[mud-_    ] i respect grind more now that he released the very much needed Play by Email series


-----------[ ndetroit's sites and stats section ]-----------

Well bitches. What the fuck do I need to say. The title of this area is "ndetroit's sites and stats section"
Not Lester's half assed attempt to fill it. Tdpriest does the stats this week. If you disagree with the sites we picked, 
then fucking die. Because I really did not want to include stats this week. Yes we usually do 10 sites, but that's alot of work now 
isn't it? So 8 it is people. I also couldn't think of enough sites. Well shall I talk about site happenings like ND always does? Ok 
then, Hades is no more. Going down for undisclosed reasons and never to return. BB4 is alive, this being the 4th incarnation 
(hence the name), and run by the same staff. Good to see them back, affils are PDM and Rise so far. Fubar is up, dunno if ND 
mentioned it before, affils are Risc, DOD, Class, ITR(wtf is itr?).  Oh come on, do you guys really give that much of a shit? 
Blackacid has probably already reported all of this. 
Just check your ranks and look at the rest.

=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. 
	Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... 
heh... fuck off and die..

with me.. I just did this as a favor, cuz nd is a lazy whore or something. 
Lester, Fuck you for making me do this ;P and HI ROCKZ!! (hope you're happy ;P)


-----------[ Lester's Biased Courier Section ]-----------

Well, I did not really trade this week, but I was poppin around on sites and pretending to trade now and again. I also have a ton of 
fuckups to rag on people with! So enjoy the show.

Dimension: Pre's make the world go round. Mrpumpkin owned almost every site he wanted to with a barrage of pre's from OGN and MFD. 
He also did some pretty good trading to boost the stats higher, we also saw Term and Novastorm and a few others poppin around. 
So far this new week Geemoney is raping every site. So maybe DMS is back? They also picked up some EQL guys, Zeus21 
and Stormwatcher. The loss of the WHQ HOE was not cool though.

Devotion: Not as much pre action as the week before, but still a solid amount. Wishmaster and even Garoto did some pretty heavy 
trading last week. Keeping Dev among the tops of the pops.

AOD: Tirre was telling me how he was off school and would spend his entire week trading, and apparantly he did just that. Bitch was 
everywhere, and true to his word, he is more or less nowhere this new week. Cedric was ownin as well. AOD still looked sharp, but 
there's been a few grumblings from a member now and again about ppl who have joined. Is the new group smell wearing off? Time will tell.
I heard glen say that nobody in AOD restarts anymore..Well uh oops?

r--r-- d:0 cedric   AOD         64240 Mar 06 01:24 tchex61c.ok.zip.bad(1)

Oh well 1 is not bad right?

-rw-r--r-- d:0 metalicx AOD        548960 Mar 06 01:25 tchex61c.ok.zip.bad(4)
10 kinda sucks though.


Risc: Bizzyscript in action on the Risc sites. Making some couriers who actually still trade to Risc sites mad. Actually 1 courier, Glen. 
Other than that, Risc hasn't been much of a force. 
Kenzo is still out and about, and apparantly is a real person! See logs of him actually talking!#@
But youthx is dedicated!
| 21346 | youthx   | RiSC      |  1d  1h | Idling For  1m  1s           |
Way to go bud.


VGN: Nothing last week, so far this new week Manioc is pre'ing for LND and Jess/Darkwolf are doing some trading. Maybe a comeback? 
Doubt it, but looks good this week anyways.

Esprit: Hehe I include you simply to mock you.

Oops?!

EQL: Well you lost 2 ppl, but you also made a nice move in Sharkie.

 Bud's Biased Utils Report #13
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 Wow lots of goodies this week! Well actually only one, an interview with
 Uncle John of Corp, my very first interview ever! Anyways I'll be doing
 interviews now and then with various people from the utils scene. And now
 back to our regularly scheduled report.

 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 02/28/99 to 03/06/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.


 Groups: (In no particular order)

 HBOC.Desktop.Security.Manager.v3.00.0082-CORP [06 x 1.44MB]

 Nice work with HummingBird Exceed XDK, I saw a lot of happy developers
 commenting this on that release after it went out. Unfortunately The 
 Corporation found themselves nuked three times this week, once for PC
 Life 2000, which they fixed, and also for Conference Room (they released
 a version that didn't exist as of yet). Final nuke was for Antiviral 
 Toolkit Pro, and I never caught the reason. Not much else to say, ProLine
 Designer is nice, Yesler Alive has been available for a while but I never
 got to doing it myself, my loss Corp's gain... I'm still expecting to
 see a bit more activity, mainly in the way of name titles... last few
 weeks have been a bit slow compared to Corp's previous work.

 Releases:

 GRAYTECH.GTWORKS.14.1-RiSE [30 x 1.44MB]

 Only one release, but as usual with RISE it's a nice one, GTWorks is a high
 end CAD/CAM tool. For anyone wondering about the -LND release of this,
 there was none, the dir was just a joke. Anyways good work to RISE on
 a good crack and a good release.

 CREDO.LIFE.FORMS.STUDIO.V3.0.2-SiEGE               [24 x 2.88MB]

 This week the scoring looks to be pretty interesting. Corp has a decent
 week, but nothing spectacular. Rise has one excellent title, but that's it
 for them. LND/SHK both have some excellent, highly requested titles. So how
 will Siege's week shape up? As usual it's all art tools. Life Forms Studio
 is the highlight for me, but they also but out some new stuff from the
 popular Discreet Logic line, amongst other things. A nice week, all though
 they don't have the dominance of earlier months. Still, I don't feel it 
 compares to some of the other efforts over the past seven days.

 It was attempted comeback week over in the XF camp, without much success,
 and comeback in this case means something other than Ultimate Toolkit for
 MFC. So instead, XF puts out a blatant dupe... there was obviously NO
 dupechecking of Sun Microsystem's HotJava HTML Component, which was released
 in August of 1998 by Manifest Destiny. XF also brings a minor update of
 Visual Cafe Pro to the table, which several other groups passed on. We're
 left with two decent releases, still nothing impressive, and if you haven't
 caught on, XF is in deep trouble these days.

 How many people did SHK suprise by winning on the Enterprise edition of
 C++ Builder 4... they got the rip and ISO done just a short while after the
 pro went out. Anyways the Enterprise offers a more comprehensive set of
 features than the earlier edition, and VisiBroker and JBuilder will appeal
 to the same user base. Some other nice titles as well, Segue's quality
 assurance suite, Quality Works, some Informix titles, and a few RogueWave
 tools, mixed in with some middle of the road apps. This is probably the
 strongest week Shock's had in a while.

 OnWeb.Host.v3.0.for.Win9xNT-PFT    [15 x 2.88MB]
 Lost.And.Found.1.00.Serial.Fix-PFT [01 x 1.44MB]

 A few issues back I gave PFT credit for releasing Lost & Found, an
 excellent recovery tool with some nasty protection for a little app.
 Unfortunately, since I have my own copy, I didn't test PFT's right
 off the bat, and it turns out their release was broken (serves me right
 I guess). So there's a serial fix... except the release still doesn't
 work for me... it was done via WinImage, except after I created
 installation disks, the program says Unauthorized Copy and doesn't
 even get to the serial part of the install (it also says this if you
 do a normal copy of original disks, which REALLY sucks because I wanted
 to make a backup of my copy... gee thanks PowerQuest, and if my disks
 get physically damaged, I'm out 80$ due to you greedy bastards). Anyways
 if anyone got this to work let me know, because the only way to backup
 my store copy is to download the program off PowerQuest onto original
 disks, which is no good if they get damaged. Oh well my rant is over...
 not much of a week for PFT.

 Well, LND didn't fuck up this week. What's a writer to do? I also have to
 give them credit, Grad came through on his word and released Procam 15
 less than a week after SGE released an old version of it. And aside from
 the fact that the MGI Photoshop II release is VERY minor (looks like a
 build to me...), LND had a very strong week. In a brief chat with Grad,
 I was also told that a full Unigraphics key may be released by LND to
 the public soon (they were supposedly keeping it internal). So love
 'em or hate 'em, they get high marks for the past seven days.

 Right off the bat, good work on DBArtisan 5 from Embacadreo (gah I hate
 that, I probably spelt that wrong... it's THE most confusing company
 name when it comes to pronounciation). It looks as if the Massive merge
 is really paying off for PRM, and while I'm not sure how much I'll enjoy
 Diary Companion, I likely would have released it as well. A steady, if
 not spectacular week.

 I had thought the Russian Bears were going back into hibernation there
 for a minute, but they brought out a very nice program at the beginning
 of the week with Autodesk's Genius LT 98. So kudos to them for it,
 and hey DOD, I want a free t-shirt!!!

 Manifest does trainers?!? Well it's not listed above but they did do one...
 I'm not scoring it (if you care it was for Premier Manager 99, the game
 of 100 addons... or at least it seems like that). Norton AV was nuked,
 I believe it was the exact same as DOD's 5.01 release, only DOD didn't
 put the extra .01 on theirs... Macromedia Fireworks 2 was a somewhat
 anticipated release, aside from that nothing special... DB edition of
 the minor Visual Cafe release wasn't much, Vizfx releases are decent though.

 I haven't seen a release tagged Shrinkwarapped in quite a while... I did 
 hear from one Blizzard member that the BLZ release of Utilities was, as
 RBS claims, a beta. So give RBS credit, although I have no clue what the
 TeamX release of NU4 turned out to be. A good week for RBS all around.

 Scum could go on like this for quite a while, putting out a couple
 decent releases each week... the question is will they ever make a run
 for the top? A lot of people had some high hopes for the Scum "reunion"
 (although it's not really the same group), but they haven't been
 realized. Three decent titles, I'll let them speak for themselves.

 I don't know what that LeadTools stuff is, ClassLib isn't listed as a
 LeadTools product, although they do have some new releases out. As for
 LT 10.0e, well 10.0e what? LeadTools doesn't have a product called just
 LeadTools, there's LeadTools Imaging, LeadTools Medical Express, etc.
 Pack better next time guys... Some ok stuff here, Icast Broadcaster is
 alright, Allaire betas are no suprise... nice job on Backup Exec Enterprise.

 I don't think FCN's releases this week were completely up to par with
 their last, but any Delphi developers should be pleased, as usual FCN
 owned the Delphi tools release area this week. I sometimes wonder why other
 groups don't focus in on this area... is FCN that dominant in coding/dev
 apps?

 <[eXiLe]> how is offering you the opportunity to suck some guys dick a
           good thing ?

 I gave the week to LND and SHK in a split, putting aside any personal
 biases I have (I love one and am appaled by the other, you figure out which
 is which), and looking only at the titles. Oh wait this is a biased report
 though... blah whatever. RISE and DOD earned high marks on one release
 each, SGE and PRM both had strong offerings as well. Radium put out
 a killer app in Cubase VST24 in their first week here.

 Other happenings... Hades is gone... again... for good... which leaves
 RISE with an open WHQ slot. Shock beefed up it's site repitoire with a
 site that cannot be mentioned, 2000AD dropped that same site. For the
 future... what will happen with Scum? Is Sodom dead? Is Grad really a
 Transvestite Albino Stripper? Can my jokes get any worse?


 An Interview with Uncle John
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Here's a little something different, hopefully you'll enjoy it. I've
 decided to interview various individuals from the utils scene, leaders,
 seniors, suppliers, whatever the case may be. This week my victim was
 Uncle John of The Corporation. - I should point out that this was my first
 time interviewing anyone, so if it gets boring, blame me. I'd also like to
 thank SJ for suggesting the idea. I'm not sure how many more interviews
 I'll do (don't expect one every week), but there will be others. And
 without further adieu...

 <Bud-> For the record (and so I don't fuck anything up), what are your
        current affils, and what groups have you been a part of in the past?
 
 <UncleJohn> My current affils are CORP  and Vengeance
 <UncleJohn> groups that i've been a part of in the past include DOD /
             PROPHECY / VENGEANCE (Old Utils Group Not Curry) / RiSC /
             SCUM / SIEGE / GENESIS
 <UncleJohn> i believe thats it i might have missed a couple
 <UncleJohn> hehe

 <Bud-> Impressive. I remember that old Vengeance.. just barely <g>.
 <Bud-> Corp is arguably one of the top utils groups today, and has had
        quite a history in the scene.
 <Bud-> How did it come to be, and how did you come to be a part of it?

 <UncleJohn> Well back in hmm i'd say 94 i believe it was David & Goliath
             came to me with the idea of starting a new utils group, He had
             released a few things under The Corporation Banner, so i figured
             what the heck, i always like a new project so i decided to join
             up, i was immediatly moved to a leadership spot, and we started
             rockin
 <UncleJohn> next :)

 <Bud-> I remember a lot of great releases from those days, Corp earned an
        excellent reputation. What do you think were the main factors for
        your success back then?
 <Bud-> And as a side note, would you consider the formation of the original
        Corp an "easy birth"?

 <UncleJohn> Hmm, what were the main factors to our succes...I'd have to say
             it was when i noticed a little group named TiTAN floating around
             the scene releasin utils, They were led by hemp hoodlum, and had
             some major names in the group. In a gutsy move i talked to hemp
             hoodlum and asked him if he'd be interested in merging titan
             into Corp. In a huge suprise to me, he said yes. After that
             move, the ball started rollin and we were on top for quite a
             while, we had the top bb
 <UncleJohn> and we were releasing many releases daily
 <UncleJohn> Would i consider the formation of the original corp an easy
             birth, i'd have to say no, we did have many good people, but we
             all had to work our asses off to prove ourselves to get taken
             seriously
 <UncleJohn> next
 <UncleJohn> ;)

 <Bud-> That's certainly true of most groups. Releases daily back then was
        quite impressive as well.

 <UncleJohn> Yup quite true

 <Bud-> Now Corp remained dominant for a while, and then came to an "end"...
        can you give some background as to what happened?

 <UncleJohn> heh, well i'll explain all of the times corp has gone away so
             people will better understand the history

 <Bud-> Hehe don't mention all of them or we'll have a book on our hands :)

 <UncleJohn> haha 
 <UncleJohn> i can make it short

 <Bud-> ok, go for it :)

 <UncleJohn> The ORIGINAL Corp merged into scum which at the time was the
             top group, The second time we merged into PWA (A Decision i had
             no part in since my computer was broken) and the Third time we
             went into SiEGE
 <UncleJohn> next
 <UncleJohn> ;)

 <Bud-> What makes the current edition of CORP a success? You've had several
        rebirths to varying degrees of success (I was even in a brief 96
        incarnation that eventually merged into SHOCK, where I am today), but
        this one seems to posses something the others didn't...

 <UncleJohn> I can account this success to the leadership. The way i formed
             this current edition of corp was so i wouldn't have to be online
             24/7 to babysit the group. First i'd like to mention beck,
             without whom this group wouldn't be at the point it is now. I'm
             sure lots of people dont like him or whatever, but he is one of
             the hardest workers out there. Second i'd like to mention
             Twizted and Oasis, a couple guys i'm sure lots of people are
             familure with, their contribut
 <UncleJohn> i've seen in years
 <UncleJohn> them along with a council of people with much experience make
             this group work better than any other edition

 <Bud-> Nice to hear... and it's definately nice to be able to leave a group
        for a while and not need to worry that it will fall apart, I can
        certainly relate to that.

 <UncleJohn> Yup! ;)

 <Bud-> What is your current role in Corp then? Do you have a hands on
        approach, or do you leave things to the council for the most part?

 <UncleJohn> Recently i've been taking a hands on approach, there were times
             in the past couple months when i was just overlooking, but that
             was when i was busy looking for a job and such, so now i'm back
             to the active leader role with beck and twizted

 <Bud-> Corp recently formed an alliance of sorts with the renowned cracking
        group UCF, which for as long as I can remember was THE cracking
        group, when it came to quality, reputation, releases...
 <Bud-> Despite the fact that of late they've slowed a bit, I can see this
        definately helping Corp
 <Bud-> although I'm not sure of the effect it will have on UCF, as it brings
        additional work
 <Bud-> How did this alliance come to be?

 <UncleJohn> Well the idea was first brought to me by TK4, i figured it could
             do nothing but help so i had him work it out
 <UncleJohn> And so its been good so far, they're eager to get crackin and
             we're eager to let them start crackin

 <Bud-> I'm yet to see a group complain they have too many crackers <g>
 <Bud-> In it's releases, does Corp try to focus on any specific area, cater
        to a certain user base?
 <Bud-> As Siege leans towards art/design stuff, FCN to programming/
        development, and as LND claims to with cam/cad titles

 <UncleJohn> Well we dont really focus on one specific area, We just want to
             get things out to the end user. Whatever it may be, if its good
             then put it out i say. I keep the standerds at this, i ask
             myself, would i or anybody that i know use this? if the answer
             is a no then its a no go :)

 <Bud-> A good rule of thumb to go by.... I guess to wrap things up, what
        defines The Corporation as a group, if you had to select just one
        thing?

 <UncleJohn> next 
 <UncleJohn> ;0
 <UncleJohn> hmm lemme think

 <Bud-> (You can cheat here if you really want, but try to narrow it down).

 <UncleJohn> I'd say that the thing that defines corp as a group is
             experience. We know what we're doing, most of us have been doing
             this for many many years.

 <Bud-> Alright, well I guess that wraps it up.. thanks a bunch for putting
        up with this, and all the best with CORP! :)

 <UncleJohn> thanks alot
 <UncleJohn> can i throw out some greets?
 <UncleJohn> :)

 <Bud-> :) .. well... we survived it ;)
 <Bud-> yeah, sure

 <UncleJohn> I want to put out a big greet out to David & Goliath, he was my
             mentor and i wouldn't be where i am without him...And hello's to
             hemp hoodlum and Nutcase


 Well that wraps up a hell of a long issue this week... if you survived all
 that, great! Thanks especially to Uncle John for putting up with my
 dull chatter, and SJ for the idea, and all of the NWR crew for including
 all this, which will prolly make up half the damn mag!

                                                          -Bud

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 


Cruel Intentions
Starring: Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, Reese Witherspoon
Rating: 3 Stars

This is a new twist on the classic Dangerous Liasons. Set in the 90's and in the age of teenagers, the cruelest of all humans. Gellar 
plays Katheryn, satan in heels. Phillippe is Sebastian, the step-brother of  Satan and no saint himself. He takes pictures of young 
girls he seduces and destroys their lives. (nice family). Reese is the virgin saint that Sebastian bets Katheryn that he can fuck. The 
bet is his nice car for her nice body. Fair enough in my opinion. Most people saw this movie on the hot chicks or hot dude if you go 
that way. Which was to be honest my original reason for going (the hot chicks in case your wondering),  But the movie is actually 
pretty good. Some nice funny parts and a moral ending and shit like that. I'd check it out, hopefully EViLiSO will release it soon. 
They seem to be running a pattern of putting out every movie a week after it releases. <g>

Analyze This
Starring: Billy Crystal and Robert DeNiro
Rating: 3 1/2 Stars

Well, personally I am a big fan of The Sopranos on HBO. Which is essentially the same thing as this movie, the plot is that DeNiro is a 
mob boss who has psychological problems and so he enlists Crystal to help him through it. What follows is some nice comedy and 
Crystal/DeNiro are pretty good together. It's a funny movie, but personally if you have HBO, watch Sopranos and wait for VCD or Video 
of this one.

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

Telesync/TS: Telesync is a procam on a tripod in an empty theater with a 
separate audio source. If there's an audience, you hear people coughing, 
camera is shaky, etc. It's a CAM.    CAM = banned. If you want a movie 
extremely early, Telesync is the way it will be.

Workprint: Workprint is a pre-release copy of a movie, stolen copy, etc. 
that usually has the film running time on the screen.

Screener: Screener is usually the BEST quality, an actual vcd of the movie, 
made from a reviewers copy, etc. Screener's are generally released after 
movies have left the theaters.


Special Thanks to Ryche of EViLiSO for the education in VCD terms, and to 
come.to/vcddupe for keeping us up to date on the new titles.

Ryche's Really Biased VCD Group Report #6

A few of the groups seem to think that Im just a teensy weensy little bit too harsh on
them sometimes, so this week I present to you the "kindler, gentler" version of my report.


Releases from 2/28/99 - 3/6/99

022899 - Home Fries - Screener - VCD-EUROPE 
030199 - Savior - Workprint - VCD-EUROPE 
030199 - Blast from the Past - Telesync - EViLISO 
030299 - Message in a Bottle - Telesync - EViLISO 
030399 - What Dreams May Come - Screener - CENTROPY
030499 - Safe Men - Screener - CENTROPY
030499 - Bravo Two Zero - Telesync - SERENiTY
030499 - The New Swiss Family Robinson - SERENiTY
030599 - The Corruptor - Telesync - VHS
030599 - 8MM -Widescreen Screener - EViLISO 

- VCD-Europe -

Wow! Home Fries and Savior! A Drew Barrymore love flick and umm... something else. The 
Workprint of Savior is screener quality with the running time but its good quality I hear.
Have I told you guys lately how much I admire the fact you continually release? Probably
not, since most of you are momo's but Ill say it here for this report. You constantly 
release even if some of it isnt to my (or most of the worlds) liking. So like way to go
and stuff..

Total - 2 Points

- Centropy - 

Well you did good this week too I see.. Two Screeners, one of em a good movie that needed
to be released in screener even if by the time you read this, you can rent it in the US.
Safe Men is a comedy and got rave reviews, so maybe you released something worthwhile and
didnt even know it. See.. I couldn't pick on you this week even if I wasn't being nice
cuz you didnt release the usual shit like you usually do. Good job guys.

Total - 3 Points

- EViLISO -

Ok, admittedly Im biased towards this group but Ill give them the criticism they deserve.
You guys suck! You release all the good movies when theyre new! I hate you fuckers..
Split into two groups and give yourself some competition or something. Blast From the Past,
Message In A Bottle, and 8MM. Three of the top 10 movies in the theatre right now, including
number 1. Sigh..

Total - 4 Points

- VHS -

The Corruptor doesnt even start til March 12 in theatres, so good work in getting this one
out. Other groups were going for it too, but when they saw how shitty a picture it was, they
decided to wait. You guys didnt. We especially appreciate the chinese subtitles for all
your Cantonese fans out there.

Total - 1 Point

- SERENiTY -

Apparently a few members of VCD-Europe had a falling out with the others and formed a new
group called SERENiTY. VCD-Europe refused to release certain movies because they thought
they were crap (if you can believe that). So we welcome them to the report for thier 
weekly dosage of abuse. This group roared onto the scene taking the sites by storm with
Bravo Two Zero, a BBC flick (UK TV for the uneducated) and the hit Disney Special, The 
New Swiss Family Robinson. There's something in thier nfo about "Bringing Joy to the VCD
Scene" or something, and I cant tell you how overjoyed I was at seeing these two nuked on
some sites. Thanks guys!

Total - 1 Point


Yes goddammit, that was as nice as I can be. So stop bugging me about being so harsh on 
people. Group of the week: EViLISO by a landslide. Couple of other notable mentions were
the releases by Centropy, both of which are good movies even if one is a little old. The
rest.. well, tune in next week..


                                                          To The Batcave..
                                                              Ryche

-----------[Blast From the Past!]-----------
This week we include a little snippet from Inquisition Issue #11. It was in response to some criticism to an uprising mag called
RCN. I include it this week since RCN was chosen as the #1 Emag favorite in the poll. <g>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           You Might Be A Lamer If..

        I'm sure you all have your definitions of what a lamer is.

But, I felt I would tell you why you MIGHT be a lamer.        
Webster's defines lame as: 1. crippled. 
                           2. stiff and painful. 
                           3. poor and inefectual.  

But, in Lester's Dictionary you might be a lamer if:
 
You might be a lamer if you think DOOM 2 is a new ware.
You might be a lamer if you start 4 groups in the span of 6 months.
You might be a lamer if someone in #warez950 tells you they are Roland of The Wall, and you believe him.
You might be a lamer if you run a courier/release/cracking/coding/ppe group.
You might be a lamer if you run a 1 node 14.4 board.
You might be a lamer if you run a 10 node PD front warez board.
You might be a lamer if you had to change your handle to make yourself look cool.
You might be a lamer if you think FATE is the best couriering group.
You might be a lamer if you hang out in #fatefiles.
You might be a lamer if you are an AOL Pirate out for equal warez.
You might be a lamer if you pay for a netcom account.
You might be a lamer if you have a shareware releasing group.
You might be a lamer if you have been interviewed in RCN.
and the final reason you might be a lamer is!
If you think RCN is a good magazine!

And in closing, I'd like to define to you what Reality Check Network means
in Webster's opinion.

- Reality: The quality or fact of being real.     
- Check: a sudden stop.
- Network: Radio, TV, a chain of transmitting stations. 

Now, in my dictionary Reality Check Network means:
A bunch of people who jumped on the bandwagon of warez mags, but are complete
and total lamers(see above to find out for sure), and provide no real service
or information that is important to the scene. The  things they print are
meaningless and have no real story to them. So!

- Reality: a lamers view of the scene.
- Check: a sudden stop.
- Network: a chain of lamers transmitting worthless information.

All the news thats fit to print... 
and then some...

Sky Masterson has taken the week to recuperate from a weeklong cocaine and heroin binge. We hope that he will return next week to 
grace us with the news.


--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors, we all love them even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us. And these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, your name will not be included, but we
do not add rumors like that say "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion"
because we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore
there is no hard evidence of that rumor, so if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!

Rumor has it that Jaydee is the most hated person of 1998. <g>

Rumor has it that all the other emags are giving in to NWR. <eg>

Rumor has it that Ndetroit is engrossed in the coding of NWR and that is why he couldn't be online for this issue. 

Rumor has it that the NWR page will be up within weeks!
