    Support NWR and CWS, and email your weektops to:
    cws_2000@yahoo.com
    Thank you!


    Well seeing as how I worked far too many hours for a mortal man to do. 
    I watched 0 vcd's and saw only one movie in the theater. And I also 
    guess that my secret is out. I am not Gene Siskel, as he has passed 
    away and I am still here. So I will assume the identity of Mike Clark, 
    although he cannot review a movie for shit. It's the only name I can 
    think of right now. Anyways, the NWR survey is going well, but you people 
    need to stop cheating to get your group rated higher!#@!@#!)@*(# 
    You also need to stop voting for RCN and vote for NWR god damnit. 
    http://tca.ramwar.com to vote! The biased courier report is handled by 
    someone else again this week until I am fully functional again. 
    Anyways, hopefully ND will get off his ass one of these weeks and get 
    us coded, huh?


                                       -Lester [Co-Editor/Head Writer]


    Umm.... 
    Does Kirk_Hamm know the difference between couriering and releasing 
    groups? Find out in this issue, as he does the biased courier report,
    giving lester the week off...
    Bud did his utils thing, and prozac is still MIA, but hopefully he'll
    be back soon. I wrote an article on ftp daemons, so read it if you 
    are interested in that sort of shit, and glen gave us a pretty funny
    log.
    
    Tdpriest was on vacation this week, but that didn't stop him from
    emailing us some GREAT nature pics. The first in tdp's nature series
    appears in the issue as "td-sqrrl.jpg". Good job tdpriest, i think that
    you have a real talent for this!

    We also have a wacky cartoon drawn by the scene's very own S^J... SJ
    is a budding cartoonist, and has shared one of this drawings "scooby.jpg"
    with us. Certainly showing promise.

    Check out blackacid's page, http://tca.ramwar.com/1024x768.html, or
    RHQ at union.jaded.net for all the crazyness that is going on. Blackacid
    has a leeto msgboard that lets me waste a lot of idle time at work, so,
    if i get fired, thanks bacid!! :D

    I guess thats all for now. Kind of a small issue, i know, but we'll be
    back next week with a few things we've been saving.. 
    take care, and have a good week, everyone..

-----------[ ndetroit's sites and stats section ]-----------

    
    An old site has come back, and it will probably be in the top10 
  before long. It is called "TDR", and is Ambition(amb!wow!), SCUM, TRPS,
  and ???. The staff promises a leet games affil very soon.
    I guess AF1 dropped KAC, not sure what that was all about, but they
  did pick up SHOCK as a utils affil.
    PRM apparently also dropped MSV after their merger with massive.
    
    A little correction from last week: NGZ is actually not EURO, its
  a US site, sorry for the confusion.
    FUBAR is apparently back, will be interesting to see what happens with
  it. Was a top razor site in its day..
    FH did not become TPC WHQ after all, *cough*noreleases*cough*. FH is 
  still looking for a games affil, but rumors are leaning toward razor..
    TRX is more than likely down permanently. The hierarchy of where it was
  hosted found out about it, and so it had to be removed. 
    Major Malfunction (MM), became an MnM site... That is cool, except that
  I could never get more than 6k/s to MM, so .... leet 2mb link. 
    
    I couldn't find the VDR weektop this week, since everyone claims "not
  to trade there any more".. So i just stuck in TOS+IC, since i have been
  waffling between which is better for some time.. TOS has a better link,
  and nice archives, but IC has better affils (radium is leet), and a little
  better support at times, it seems... So.. it was a tossup... But sooner
  or later we'll figure out which is better, and axe the other one..
  *cough*exactsameaffils*cough*.

    Some last minute news out that came in as i was finishing this up:
  NGZ is down (possibly perm), as a result of a nark threat, so its too
  bad to see that site go. 
    And MSV is also down perm after a nark threat... I don't believe it,
  and we will leave it at that.. more on that next issue, possibly..

    I promise not to write this drunk next week.  

=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. 
	Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... 
heh... fuck off and die..

-----------[ Lester's Biased Courier Section ]-----------



Well since Lester's masterbation sessions extended through another week. ND 
asked me to do this courier report shit (dont know why, he was probably 
smokin crack.) But if you thought that last weeks report was bad then you 
havent seen nothing yet. I dont know shit about trading or traders. All's 
I know is that there are to many of you guys, maybe the lame ones should o 
i dunno...do something like hacky sack or even go as far are trying to kill 
yourself's that might help. I wanted to do a utils report but I guess this 
is the closest I will come so here we go...

Devotion - If you look up PreWhore in the dictionary, youll see a picture of 
a little swede named JayDee! I think jd should right a novel on how to be a 
prewhore. It would be on the best sellers list, Glen would sure as hell buy 
it! Nice work from AcidApple and Garoto. All in all some nice releases, few 
nukes and minor updates but in the end they did pretty well.

Dimension - I dunno, maybe they suck every week?!? All I see is Pixel 
weektoping on a few sitez. He must have picked up some stuff from editing 
JD's book about prewhoring. But aside from that nothing special few ppl 
weektoping on one site each. Lots of crap this week from them 
nukes/fixes/webcrap/minorupdates...

AOD -  Busted out wif da phat releases dis week! Puttin out some major titles 
and some phat ass shit. Cant fuck with AOD this week. They rocked my world!

Risc - just one comment...<Kirk_Hamm> who's jman? <ndetroit> jman = risc 
<ndetroit> he is a good trader.. <ndetroit> and seems like a  pretty nice 
guy. Thats all I have to say. Jman owned this week, putting and otherwise 
lame RiSC in a nice spot. 

VGN - Um....cracking group?

Prozac is away again this week, and we wish him a speedy return, as he
straightens out the shit in his personal life... Word on the street is
that he will be back for next week..

 Bud's Biased Utils Report #11
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Damnit. I'm running late. Again. I used to be so good at this, everything
 was typed up way ahead of time. Hell I was one of the FEW things in NWR
 actually done before the very last second possible.

 Let me give you some advice. And trust me on this. Call your parents. Call
 them often. At least once a week, maybe twice. Talk to them. I know it's
 going to hurt, but if you don't they're going to complain. They're going to
 complain you never call. They're going to complain they never hear from
 you. And then the inevidable will happen - they're going to want to see
 you. And then you'll be stuck - no simple phone call will get you out of it.
 You're going to have to sit down and spend time with them. Experience the
 joy of listening to rambling stories that don't seem to have any point to
 them. And unlike the telephone, you can't just feign some interest and
 ignore most of it.

 Yeah, I know what you're thinking, and YES I have a point. Because I'm
 stuck visiting my folks, and thats why this is late. I'm also stuck on my
 old 486, which doesn't even have enough room to run Word. So anyways I'm
 kind of fustrated (I love my parents but they are damn ANNOYING at times),
 and the math you see below is last minute math from an Arts student... so
 if I fucked anything up my apologies in advance.

 Alright. My rambling is over with. Fifty percent of you probably skipped it
 anyways.. for the rest... HAHA! <g>. Anyhow it's report #11 for me, which
 means all groups which I've reviewed since report #1 have a score out of one
 hundred, once you discount Report #9 which was guest authors. So we're going
 to take a look back and see how each group has faired over the past few
 months since I started doing this report. I'll total it out of 100, give my
 views, etc. This weeks score is included in that total btw. 

 NOTE: I've left out groups who have been added since the start of the
       report. That means quite a few - TRPS, SCUM, VRS, MFD, SDM, etc won't
       be one here. Entity is now defunct so it's missing as well. Premiere
       is missing as their comeback added them to the report late.

 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 02/14/99 to 02/20/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.

 Groups: (In no particular order)

 More activity via intergraph releases this week, also a dongle crack
 in CodeSoft. CheckPoint Firewall is a top-notch app.. hmm not much else
 to say, I don't actually use any of this stuff. Their total score suprised
 me, and it isn't reflective of their quality... idle periods hurt their 
 total. But remember that these totals don't mean all that much.

 Pantone.Colordrive.v.1.5-CORP

 Another fairly impressive week for CORP. Argue if you want that a lot of 
 their releases come off the web, the end user doesn't give a shit, and
 neither do I. Good work with the Protoview and Dialogic stuff. Big news for
 CORP this week is an alliance between them and UCF. Even if UCF is not as
 strong as it's former self, this can only help CORP, taking the pressure
 off its own crackers. Should equal more releases, we shall see.

 RISE:

 KODAK.PICTURE.EASY.v3.1-RiSE

 Two good releases from RISE this week, although with all their recent
 additions I was hoping for a bit more. Still, nice titles, Picture Easy
 is more to my taste.... as for the total to date, again with RISE some
 idle periods hurt, but that doesn't reflect the overall quality of the
 group, which is one of the best in the scene.

 Another week with SGE dominating the arts applications. Two fixes for
 Weapon rel's of Digimation stuff will solve headaches for some people. It
 is nice to see something other than art this week, including some CAD titles
 from Autodesk (SGE has always excelled at CAD apps), Bentley titles, and
 Webtrends Pro Suite. With the movements of RISE and CORP recently, SGE is 
 definately going to need to step up competition with these sorts of apps to 
 remain dominant, and this week they've suceeded.

 Linux... well I can't test it so no points, I do realize many scene
 members (and most sites, at least those worth mentioning) run it...
 and a beta. Yay. 
 
 What else can I say but fallen dynasty? Despite my jokes about ClipForce
 and such, many of us remember a time when XF dominated the art scene, and
 much of the utils scene in general. Alas, that is no more. They've passed
 the art torch over to SGE, and are now pretty much stuck on life support.
 Don't expect to see a resurgance any time soon, save some kind of miracle.

 SHK gets into a few areas they aren't normally active in this past week.
 They put out some entries into the CAD field with Ditek's DynaCADD, as
 well as Palladio X, and some little plugins from cADD-ONs Inc. Only
 DynaCADD really stands out amongst their CAD enteries... we also saw a bit
 of stuff for Photoshop, a little less suprising but still not normally a
 strong point for this team... could be some more of this stuff in the
 future.

 Here's where I have my fun. Right off the bat, I have to say
 good work on CPP Builder 4. There's no denying that it's a great title,
 and several groups were going after it. Some other nice stuff as well...
 Autodesk MapGuide server being one.

 Now on the down side... a FIX for PLASTIC ADVISOR?!? You couldn't even
 make that crap work in the first place??? What WERE you thinking!!??
 This week also saw the usual selection of of ripped ISO's and borrowed
 work from LND... now I don't really care about stolen serials anymore,
 simply because I don't really care about LND as a group anymore... no one
 really takes them seriously, Grad doesn't even seem to. So the Informix
 titles.. yer wolcome guys. :) The best thing here is Voice Xpress
 Advanced 2.0, which they ripped from RBSiSO - now if you remember, LND also
 released Voice Xpress Pro 2.02, which was also ripped from an ISO. If LND
 had of bothered researching these titles they would have noticed ADVANCED
 is the same as PRO, only PRO has MORE FEATURES! So way to go LND, you
 basically just duped yourselves. The quality here is just amazing! <G>

 Even not giving points for the usual amount of CRAP with an -LND tag
 on it, they still had a good week. Grad's had some idea about going
 ISO only, so who knows where the group will go in the future... but if
 they go ISO only, we'll miss all those ISO rips!! Noooo!! ;)

 with Kirk Hammit currently at the helm while Zima Man gets some shit
 together or something like that. This week saw some more of Black
 Ice's Impact Fax series (which I personally think sucks), a minor
 version of RoboHelp Office... nicest thing here is ConfigSafe
 2, which is on my waiting list under stuff to test... but
 I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on it till I get the chance.

 Releases: 

 BestCrypt.v6.06-DOD

 DOD is one of my favorite groups, I've said that over and over... they 
 are kinda idle here, but thats alright. There's a big difference between
 DOD idle, and say, XF idle. When DOD releases, it's still good quality
 mainstream apps. And while I recognize the importance of specialization,
 my own personal bias drives my preferences, and that seems to frequently
 bring me to titles DOD have put out. Still, a couple weeks of no releasing
 hurt DOD, as they scored no points for two consecutive weeks.

 Quote of the Week: <[grind]> i will rape myself

 Jeez Grind is just FULL of great quotes :)

 Oh yeah no disk count on titles since I got lazy (lazier).

 Now for my breakdown on the scores. For the week, PFT and SGE took top
 marks, but other groups were missing, such as PRM, TRPS, MFD, etc, in
 order to keep the workload down, as well as to keep some continuity.
 
 The Total to date scores should be taken with a grain of salt. There's
 no doubt however that the over 70 category represents three of the top
 groups in the utils scene today. They got high marks through consistancy
 and good quality. Still, groups such as RISE and DOD wind up with lower
 scores even though there's no doubt that they are just as formidable.
 Being a weekly report, and seeing that only 10 weeks of scoring are compiled
 here, results in some variance as to what groups are actually worth...
 besides which, scores don't mean all that much if a few weeks from now
 someone does Win2k Final or something... let the releases speak for
 themselves. But have fun!

 Next week some new groups may find themselves on the list. Not too sure.   
 Whatever... I'm done here for this week. On a final note, ripping Dennis
 Leary, cuz I just had this conversation online a few minutes ago....
 why the FUCK can't I get a cup of coffee flavoured coffee anymore?
 And what the FUCK is "Royal Blend" flavour... to the assholes at
 Second Cup Canada... FUCK YOU! Bring back normal coffee, and sell
 some normal fucking donuts.

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 


Jawbreaker
Starring: Rose Mcgowan, Rebecca Gayheart, Pam Grier AND MARILYN MANSON!#@*)
Rating: 1 1/2 Stars

Well, I finally decided to give this a low rating after much deliberation. 
I will suggest any normal guy go see this, simply for the mass hottie 
action. But the movie itself, pretty well sucks. It goes along the lines 
of a female Very Bad Things. Rose is fucking hot..it goes without saying. 
Story is, the 3 most popular and hot chicks in school kidnap their 4th 
hottie and gag her with a jawbreaker. She ends up choking on it and dying 
so they try to cover it up. Ie, female very bad things. But hopefully it 
will ge t VCD'ed, because then it is worth it.


=----------------------------------=-------------------------------------=

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

Telesync/TS: Telesync is a procam on a tripod in an empty theater with a 
separate audio source. If there's an audience, you hear people coughing, 
camera is shaky, etc. It's a CAM.    CAM = banned. If you want a movie 
extremely early, Telesync is the way it will be.

Workprint: Workprint is a pre-release copy of a movie, stolen copy, etc. 
that usually has the film running time on the screen.

Screener: Screener is usually the BEST quality, an actual vcd of the movie, 
made from a reviewers copy, etc. Screener's are generally released after 
movies have left the theaters.


Special Thanks to Ryche of EViLiSO for the education in VCD terms, and to 
come.to/vcddupe for keeping us up to date on the new titles.

What a week.. more direct-to-video-no-one-has-ever-heard-of-this-shit-what-
the-fuck-is-it releases and a couple box office bombs. The three highlight 
movies this week though are Rushmore, A Simple Plan, and HurlyBurly which 
all made one or more critics best of lists. Not alot of releases in sheer 
ammount this week, but Ill try to slander as many people as possible so you 
have something to read. :)

[NUKED] - Hi-Life - Screener - VCD-EUROPE 

- VCD-Europe -

The frenchies <g> kicked off the week with Too Hard to Die Workprint and 
finished up the week with Hi-Life Screener. Too Hard to Die is an unknown, 
this title comes up nowhere. Not the imdb, not the in-production warehouse, 
NOWHERE. So its either one that slipped through the cracks or its on video 
or going to be on video and its been renamed without anyone
noting it. Hi-Life is on video at Blockbuster.

Note: I get alot of these europenises crying that its not out on video yet 
in Europe so its a valid release. No. The film industry is not centered in 
Botswana or Yugoslovia. Its in Hollywood and last time I checked, that was 
in the U.S. If we can rent a tape for $3 week dont want it on the sites. 
The VCD scene is for movies you cant own yet legally, and anyone from Europe 
can order from Blockbuster or Amazon.com or wherever. If you allow movies 
that are on video already soon you wont have room for the new movies because 
lame groups have filled your HDD with stuff on video. Stop crying and check 
what you release first..

Total - 1 Point - 


- HighSpeed -

This week HighSpeed released Gloria, the Sharon Stone protects a kid from the 
mob and has motherly urges movie. They called it a screener but it was 
quickly found out to be a workprint since it contained the running time 
for editing. Siteops were nice enough to rename it for them. Awww.. how 
sweet.. 

Total - 2 Points - 


- IGN -

IGN decided to release this month and they popped up with a good one, 
Rushmore. Havent seen the quality, etc (not my job) but theres alot of 
good word about the movie itself. There does seem to be ONE problem though. 
They released it in .mpg format. Now alot of you who download these movies 
think "Great, I can watch it without having to burn it!" But, this is not a
good thing. VCD has its own .mpg format. Its called "whitebook" standard and 
has its own special framerate, bitrate, etc. so that it will burn into a 
REAL VCD which can be played on VCD players and VCD capable DVD Players 
which alot of us have now. Rushmore apparently is NOT a "whitebook" standard 
.mpg so it will not burn into a proper VCD. Thats the reason bin/cue is the 
accepted standard, because you get a full image of the VCD with the right 
bit/framerate and the menu structure. 

Total - 2.5 Points -


- FiZ -

Ok, everyone has asked me wtf is HurlyBurly? Its about these completely and 
totally fucked up Hollywood Producers and actors who live in thier own 
little world of drug use and abuse and the problems it causes. Sounds 
shitty right? Wrong. Starring: Kevin Spacey, Sean Penn, Chazz Palmenteri, 
Gary Shandling, and Meg Ryan.

Total - 3 Points -


- EViLISO -

Only one Telesync this week (although some of the Scr/WP's may turn out to 
be shit) and its a good one. A Simple Plan is the Billy Bob Thornton/Bill 
Paxton suspense/mystery about guys who find money and turn on each other. 
Its directed by Sam Raimi (Evil Dead!!) and its on critic's pick lists. It 
was also released as a Workprint before its theatrical release by IGN but 
it was such a bad copy no one could watch it, so Im glad someone finally
released a watchable copy.

Total - 2 Points -


- Centropy -

You ever walk into the video store and all 30 copies of the movies you want 
to see are gone but theres always those 2 copies of the movies with the 
sweaty guys on the cover and the exploding train, bus, car, building 
behind them? Thats the kind of movies Centropy seem to release. Both of 
their movies this week are wtf specialties in that you dont know wtf they
are.

Total - 2 Points -


A rather ho-hum week, with a few gems hidden in there if you know what to 
look for (and thanks to NWR now you do). Ill give the nod this week to FiZ 
for HurlyBurly over Rushmore because its a) Screener b) Quality Movie 
c) IN THE RIGHT FUCKING FORMAT. Gloria from HighSpeed is also a notable 
release and other than the running time, its a screener so I will give note 
to that. Releasing-wise all the groups did a semi-decent job in a rather
dull week overall..
                                                  Touch it.. it's real
                                                        Ryche

=---------[ Which ftpd is Right for You? ]----------=


Every site is faced with the choice at one point or another: what ftp daemon
should we run? The link is important, affils are good, and staff is critical,
but one often-overlooked key to every site's success is its daemon.

A daemon has to be reliable, easy to use, packed with features, easy to setup,
secure, aesthetically appealing, and most of all, FAST, FAST, FAST!

This is a topic that I like to think i know quite a bit about, as i have run 
pretty much every scene daemon at one point or another.. So here it is, a
breakdown of the major public daemons out there, and a few of the notable
private ones..
I will try to examine the daemons' strong and weak points, as well as give
some history, and reasons for running them..


--------------
PUBLIC DAEMONS
--------------


--xftpd----

This is probably the first major wide-scale scene daemon that every site
ran for years. A lot of the private daemons out there are based on a mod of
this daemon, or borrow VERY heavily from it. Coded by ???, it dominated the 
scene until the arrival of bleachboy, who would, of course, change things up 
quite a bit.. ;) Xftpd could be referred to as "the grandmother of today's
sites".

PROS: FAST! Can be made to do a lot of different things, provided you are
willing to code the shit out of it. Works on muliple platforms

CONS: Hard to set up, very little support. Many of the older addons are no
longer available, or VERY hard to get. 

OVERALL: Still run by a few sites out there, in some modded form or another.
Not a lot of built in support for pretty much anything, but that hasn't 
stopped ppl from coding things like bot .tcls and remote nuking for it. 


--bftpd----

If there is a daemon that could be called "the grandfather of today's sites",
it would have to be this one. Coded by bleachboy, and used on Bleachbox(BBX),
this daemon would revolutionize the way the scene viewed ftp sites. The first
"warez-only" daemon, it included built in support for groupop, weektops stats,
and a messageboard.. This daemon successfully merged the dying BBS scene with
the fledgeling FTP scene, and is a large part of the reason why we are where
we are today.

PROS: Coded for warez, by someone who knew what he was doing. 

CONS: Not really a public daemon, source code was "released" to the world by
trite, but don't expect any support or addons for it. Developement has ceased.
Difficult to set up.

OVERALL: The daemon that changed the way we do things is a bit dated by todays
standards. I don't know of any site currently running it. 


--rftpd----

The R stands for Reanimator, the primary coder of this very good daemon. About
a year ago, this daemon held the spot now occupied by glftpd, as the scenes
defacto standard. Nearly every site that didn't have a custom daemon used
rftpd. Built in support for weektops, groupop, flags, nuking, and a bot .tcl
made this THE daemon of choice for everyone.

PROS: Coded for warez, chock full of features. Developement is still ongoing,
tho not as heavily as in past months. Everyone knows how to use it, and what
to expect from it. Artists like to work with it, as its template-style makes
ascii easy to adapt. 

CONS: More difficult to set up than others. SLOWER than pretty much all the
other daemons. Couriers don't seem to like trading to it as much.

OVERALL: Still a good choice, and run by a few good sites. IC runs this 
daemon, and does a very good job with it. Glftpd would be a better choice
for a newbie siteop with no experience. 

--ftp4all----

Coded by various people under the GPL, this is a public-domain daemon that
has come a long way since it originally started out running on the old TRM,
(The Raging Monkey). At the time TRM went down, many people considered its
HEAVILY-modded ftp4all daemon to be one of the best in the scene. I personally
run this daemon, and love it, tho it has many undocumented "features" that
would make me hesitant to recommend it to all but the most experienced siteops
and coders. 

PROS: The best daemon for "tinkering" and tweaking. Many addon scripts are
available, and anyone with a basic knowledge of PERL or C can do pretty much
anything they can imagine with it. Still being updated, and well supported
by its authors and user-community.

CONS: Many features are not built-in to the daemon, and must either be coded,
or installed as an addon. Difficult to set up. Daemon has bugs that include 
(but are not limited to) intermittent lock-ups, 0-byting of files, and 
general "finickyness". 

OVERALL: This daemon has potential to be the best, but only if you are
willing to spend MASSIVE amounts of time getting it to do what you want.
If you are inclined to code+tweak+code+tweak, then this daemon could be
something special for you. Currently the only site running it is TMS,
and the daemon looks very very nice there.

--glftpd----

GL stands for greyline, the daemon's principal coder and support system.
This daemon has taken over from rftpd as the scene's standard. Quick, easy
to use, and fast make it the best choice for many sites. Loaded with features
out the ass, its difficult to go wrong with it. 

PROS: Fast, easy to setup, easy to use, many many features, well supported,
very few bugs. Frequently updated.

CONS: Userfile from previous versions are not always compatable with newer
versions. Nearly _every_ site uses it, so your site will have to have some
other reason reason to stand out, as it will look JUST LIKE every other
site out there. Not as easy to customize as others. 

OVERALL: This is the daemon if you want the best, but can't code your own.
Top sites currently running it include: TV, TOS, and MG.

---------------
PRIVATE DAEMONS
---------------

In addition to all the public daemons available to the scene, several sites
run their own custom-coded private daemons. A few of them are listed here:


--eftpd----

Its creaky, its old (5 years now!), and it doesn't have nearly as many 
features as you'd think it would, but Eftpd stands the test of time as one
of the scene's best. A private daemon, run exclusively on E, this engine
has endeared itself to many members of the scene, and is a beloved favorite.
Best features include "enigma cookies", and an "anti-restarters" feature
that will make restarting progressively more and more difficult. 


--eqlftpd----

Run exclusively on EQUALITY-affilled sites, this great daemon does something
that few others can: load-distributed processing. One eqlftpd site shares
its cpu and HD load seamlessly across 7 different machines. Equality, the
group whose members invented the client "pftp" has a winner with eqlfpd. 
All the bells and whistles of most daemons, but eqlfptd sites invariably
all look "sparse", and in need of more art, or better help. This daemon
is VERY closely guarded by eql, and its unlikely it will ever become public.


--hftpd----

Probably my personal favorite, HADES FTPD is one of the best-looking
daemons i have ever seen. More features available than any other site I have
seen, and quite a few features i have never seen anywhere before. Currently
coded by exile, the daemon supports everything most glftpd sites do, and
a few other wacky options. Daemon has the ability to break down releases by
groupname and disk-size, providing up-to-the-minute release stats for every
single group in the scene. Little features, like "site wkup 30" also contribute
to the overall thoughtfullness of this beast. If i had to come up with 
something negative to say about it, it would be the daemon's poor 
documentation. It took me half an hour to find out how to get last weeks
weektop.. ;p Apparently the daemons is also IMPOSSIBLE to set up. That is 
probably more of an advantage than a detriment however, as it keeps the daemon
firmly in the hands of the HADES staff. 
The criticisms are few and far between, however. HFTPD certainly has to be 
considered the daemon-to-beat for all those would-be coders out there looking 
for a project...

------------

That wraps up our look at some of the options available to siteops out 
there. It should be noted that we certainly have not covered all the
options, and indeed have purposefully ignored some, for reasons of privacy,
unfamiliarity, or just plain mediocrity. Good luck with your site hunting,
and .... exile, can i borrow your source code?  <g>

-----------[The Scene News]-----------

All the news thats fit to print... 
and then some...


-Hey kiddies... i got news for ya:

-Massive and all its members (and one of its sites?) merged into premiere.
 This should strengthen the PRM team a little, as fusion has been 
 increasingly absent the past few weeks.

-Ok.. so i was wrong for the 2nd (*cough*) week in a row. Turns out
 acidapple did not join TPC.. He simply joined the channel, and was
 surprised to see the topic change to "Welcome Acidapple to TPC"...
 I stole that news from bacid's page anyways, so.... ;p

-Another big merger story that nd got from wolfcast and told me to piece
 together at the last minute: (its long, so, here we go)

 The group TWMC (remember, they released photoshop 5?) merged together with
 eCG. The new group will be called INTEGRiTY (ITR), and will be led
 by wolfcast and bubblegun. They have already pumped out 140mb of releases
 in their first day of existance, so good work to them. Apparently tho, it
 doesn't stop there.. Gza, the former leader of ECG was not included in
 the merger, because "he is lazy and no-one likes him" (good enough reason
 for me). Gza is like.. the only one left in ECG now.. HAHAHAHAHAHA
 Anyways.. thats all that, more on it next week, when things become a 
 little more official, and nd has time to sift through all the logs, or smth.

-ReleaseHQ made the 50,000 hit mark this past week, so good work to them. 

-Apparently DMS has started up an ISO division, appropriately named "DMSISO".
 
-NGZ went down, due to nark threats.. good luck to its siteops.

-Who is the kenzo/risc guy that i keep seeing on sites? Nice to see risc
 with a spark of hope there, but... why do i never see him idle in channels?
 Does he even exist? 

-group moves: tirre quits ogn, cablegod leaves dng/risc, acidapple not
 in TPC, garflozzy to PNC, arsonic to PNC, garflozzy to DMS, xtremist
 went back to VGN (not sure why), and nutcase also joined up with the
 vengeance crew.

-Hey... i'm sure i haven't mentioned it before, so let me take the 
 opportunity now: Karl is a useless twit, and dumber than a sack of
 ball-peen hammers.. Someone please give that man a free castration,
 courtesy of me..  ;p

-And finally, as it was pointed out by glen:

990201   Pixshow.v6.0.0.2.win9xnt.incl.keygen-tno                817KB 
990205   PixShow.v6.1.0.1.Win9xNT.Incl.Keygen-TNO                808KB 
990210   PixShow.v6.3.1.2.Win9xNT.Incl.Keygen-TNO                816KB 

"Do we really need this program that badly?"

--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors, we all love them even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us. And these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, your name will not be included, but we
do not add rumors like that say "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion"
because we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore
there is no hard evidence of that rumor, so if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!


-Rumor has it that Grad(e) has quit AoD, after g+m failed to deliver upon
 the promise of supplying him with one AoD T-Shirt(100% Cotton, XXL, some
 shrinkage after initial washing). Grad(e) is now promising to trade/prewhore
 for whatever group can "supply him with 3-4 t-shirts". 

-Rumor has it that we were dead on last week about our utils merger, and
 there is ANOTHER merger set to happen, even BIGGER than this one. This 
 merger however is not of the utils group nature, but something entirely
 different.. It is set to go, and will be announced shortly

-Rumor has it that mgd + ndetroit will be away from the scene for the 
 next week or so, to participate in the Jeopardy Tournament of Champions,
 after their huge success in the HADES Trivia Game.
