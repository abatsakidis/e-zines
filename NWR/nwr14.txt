                                 Issue XIV
                         July 12th - July 18th, 1998


=----------------------------------------------------------------------------=


	Sooooo.....   we be back in action, and i'd like to take this 
opportunity to remind you all to please PHEAR!! ...thank you.
	Well. Kind of a dead week this week. A bunch of sites came back up, 
among them PM, XNS, and TWH. WTC was down, who knows when it will be back.
Blackacid's page claims sunday... whatever. 
	I also heard that FOS was back, tho apparently its been back for 
a while... i'm always the last to know... ;p

	A few new sites got started up, and look like they might be worth
taking a look at, among them: ...Major Malfunction[MM], a fast EURO site run
by a bunch of big fatasses (hi AA!) that looks like it might turn out half
decent after all. (I'm #4 on the alltime, go figure!)... and the suitably
named Identity Crisis[IC], a US site that picked up razor and siege. (hey,
didn't this site used to be called DO?)  bahahah...

	*Sigh* but at least we can be thankful that it was a slow week, 
in that no sites were narked, and everyone decided to do their repairs at
the same time. 

	Removed from the list for this week is WTC (down), and NMS (also down)
replacing them are TDR, and HOL. 

	
=-----------------------------------=---------------------------------------=

	I think that its fair to say that whatever comeback the US sites 
looked like they were making a few weeks ago is pretty much dead now. TMS
is the lone US site on the list, and if its the only US site that deserves
to be on here, then thats not saying much, and we might as well remove TMS
as well, because wtf wants to trade to just one US site?
	Something has to be done, and perhaps we'll find ways to address that
in a future issue. I know i'm not the only one who can remember the great 
days of the US when sites like TP, TRS, TCD, TH, and Hades (yes, Hades, 
rookie sluts) used to do a pretty fair job of dividing things up on both 
sides of the ocean. (and i'm sure there are a few that i forgot there, sorry,
its late, and i'm drunk!!  --what else is new, tho?)
	
	Most top traders these days will just laugh when asked if they
want to be added to a new US site. And justifiably so. Until there are enough
fast, exciting, original sites out there, the US scene is just going to keep
getting the scorn and derision that its getting now. The US scene is in a 
SAD state. People complain that the sites are too slow, too small, don't get 
pre'd to first by their affils, and are just generally all one big boring 
RFTPD clone of each other. Same traders, same groups, same daemon, same 
layout, same art, same shit, different pile!
	
	But we all know that will probably not last. There are a lot of up
and coming sites out there, that look like they have the chance to give
the US scene the kickstart it needs. I'm not saying that it is going to 
compete on equal footing with the big EUROs, but at least it might be able
to COMPETE.
	So if you are a "Euro-Only" trader <g> out there who gives a fuck
about where the scene is going, and wants to see the HEALTHY competition that
used to exist come back to life, then check out one of the following sites,
and see if they are worth it:
	PM - Prime Mover: Siege, Blizzard
	DV - Diamond Valley: RTS, Illogic, Weapon
	DL - Dreamland: Xforce (more, but i can't remember!)  <g>
	TMS - The Mother Superior: Dimension, Swat, Reflux, Reign, Radium
	UC - United Center: Class, Pwa, (will it be back?!?)
	IC - Identity Crisis: Siege, Razor
	DWH - Da Wolves House: Equality, Core, Hid, Demise
	XNS - Xenosis: Millenium, Class

	and a lot more.... hopefully in future issues we will have some 
new names to add to that list. Bottom line: they are good sites, but not 
GREAT sites. Great traders make great sites. Get on it, bitches!!

                                                  -nd

=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. 
	Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... 
heh... fuck off and die..

=-----Lester's Biased Section-----=


Well It's time to write again, weeks go by so damn fast, NWR is back as
you all noticed last week, new guy is doing the calculations and things,
so that's good. Once Blackacd is off his ass, this WILL be on his page
in it's own area,etc..etc.. but who knows when his fat ass will do it.
Until then I'd say just look for NWR or I think archive.pheared.com has
them every week. I told BA i'd put that i'm a supporter of his little
lamers online bullshit, but I am not gonna do it till i see my part
of the page:)

Overall Group Shit

Dimension:  This is starting to get a little repetitive here, ownage on
all the sites, though still not all of the guys are trading, so step up
and stop hanging on MGD's coattails.

Risc:  Oh how the mighty have fallen, I can't find a risc trader to make
fun of even!

Devotion:  Well all those pickups haven't led to much, Acidapple has
cooled off since joining, Native is non-existant since joining, even
Garoto has cooled down. One wonders what the problem is(but this one has
an idea what it is:))

Millennium: They lost Dual, the end is upon us, Roller's restarting ass
is all they have left:)

Ambition:  Still poking around, but not the force of a few weeks ago when
they still had acidapple, and no pickups to replace him.

Vengeance:  Hrm, I think jess retired again..hehehe but she did enough
to at least get VGN back in my report:) *APPLAUSE*


Weekly Happenings: Dual finally left MNM, for Risc of all groups, and he
quickly got out of there, to come to DMS, and then left DMS, and now I
believe is indy, 3 groups in the span of 36 hours or so. One wonders wtf
Dual was on, but life goes on. Rumor has it that MS has been busted again,
which is too bad, a moment of silence please..............................
.......................................................................
Ok, thank you, now from the creators of DO, comes IC, the same site
with a new name basically:) But we are glad to see it back aren't we?
yes we are. While I was writing this I noticed a little petty fight
in sth's channel, and I started to think about how stupid some ppl are,
everyone was ragging on MGD for being on the net too much, why you ask?,
because he is about double the megs of anyone else, now this is nothing
new, MGD has always been able to be #1 on any given site at any given time,
even back in the days when there was actually some real competition and
not 80% of these guys who call themselves traders:). Though of course,
I could always beat him<g>. But a peculiar thing happened next, instead
of MGD taking on the entire channel like he normally would have done, he
just said to me, idiots, not going to waste my time arguing with them.
So it puts you all to shame, the king of fights and immaturity during 
his original trading days, has grown up and learned a thing or 2, and yet
the rest of the scene remains the same. You'd think if someone like MGD
could be mature, the general population of the scene could pull it off,
but then again you'd also think that the general population would know
how to drive on the freeway, so who knows! Laterz
