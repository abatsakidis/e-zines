	Well, well, well..NWR is on time for two weeks in a row. With
myself back at the helm it appears we are a smooth running machine. 
Yes yes I will stop inflating my own ego now. Well, the issue is again
pretty basic. Cedric is back again this week and probably sticking around for
awhile. The same people are alive and well working for us. Next week I'm going
to try to deliver the story of Ndetroit's final disappearance. As he has 
not been online in 5+ weeks we will no longer be holding his sections for him.
Ryche is the co-editor of the mag now. Enjoy the show and cya next week.
this week we included a video of Glen begging for a date, you can see it at
www.oakland.edu/~ksdeleeu/~broncobh/

        Ok, so its a TAD bit late but we only held the presses so we could
get most of the reports in.. It just wouldnt be the same without Blitz and
Bud or whoever we could find to fill in for them. Loyalty? No, we just dont
want it to suck.. Big news this week was the AOE2 release from PDM which
won't work on my fucking AMD without crashing after every mission but I'm not
bitter.. no, not at all. Check out the log of some of NWR's favorite people,
glen-, Caserd, and MossyOld bullshitting each other. Send in your opinions and
guest articles so we can add to the mags and hear what you think.

-----------[ Your Name Here's Biased Courier Section ]-----------

    Hello fellows, here cedric to the rescue to deliver you this week's 
courier report. I'm trying to make it unbiased, but if you feel it isn't,
well just skip it and go to the next section, i don't give a fuck ;>
By the way, english isn't my native language, so if i make mistakes,
bear with it...

AMNESiA         : Well, not much activity from the amn team, besides glen who
                 did well on a few sites, but he is really really fat, and he
                 has a lil willy ;/

                  Overall: MORE ACTIVITY NEEDED@#!%)#@!
                  Rating : 4/10


ANGELS ON DRUGS : Pretty good week from AOD, with the usual combination of trading
                 from the same ole Faith/gollie/mimoz (and me!!!), and preing from
                 gollie/morbid/moonsabre/freakshow(and me!) which made AOD take
                 back their #1 spot this week.

                  Overall: Good week.
                  Rating : 8.5/10


DSC             : DSC lost their main trader to DEV, prozax, which hurts them bad,
                 even if they still got vulcan & sax to show on sites, but we can
                 wonder how DSC will do without their main trader/leader.

                  Overall: Future doesnt look good ;/
                  Rating : 1/10


DEVOTiON        : DEV picked up prozax from DSC which makes a second trader along
                 with godbless who was idle this week. But the prevotion team was
                 in full effect, with Jaydee, tc, silentjoe and slammar. Only 
                 prozax and insanity were out trading some megs, but the preteam 
                 is enough to bring devotion to the 2nd place for the week.

                  Overall: Same old thing, but still strong.
                  Rating : 8/10


EQUALiTY        : Nothing to say here, everyone's idle.

                  Overall: ...
                  Rating : 0/10


ESPRiT          : See EQL review.

                  Overall: ...
                  Rating : 0/10


iNSANiTY        : dennison, and that's it, a group cant hope to grow with only
                 one active trader who's not even on most top sites.

                  Overall: Lack of activity...
                  Rating : 1/10


RiSC            : Flavor & PsedO didnt trade much this week, so that means no one
                 in RiSC traded ;/

                  Overall: Get back to work you fellow frogs :>
                  Rating : 2/10


TFA             : Idleness...

                  Overall: ...
                  Rating : 0/10

ViCE            : Most traders in ViCE took a break this week, redman & citizen traded
                 a bit, mrp and nailz did their usual job, but we could expect much
                 better from ViCE if we look at last week when they took the first 
                 position

                  Overall: Not as good as last week, but just a break i guess.
                  Rating : 6/10

===============================================================================================

THE BLITZ REPORT FOR THE WEEK OF 09/13/99 - 09/20/99
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Guess who held up NWR this week? Yep me. Sorry folks, it's never happened before, and 
 let's hope it never happens again. I guess we start out by correcting an error from last
 week. We had CLASS beating out PARADIGM on the basis of a non working release in Prince of
 Persia 3D. Well it turns out that the problem was with the original and not the crack. My
 aplogies to PDM and congrats for winning last week. 

 It's been a while since I layed down my rules in print so I'll rehash them for those of you
 who don't have backissues of NWR handy.

THE RULES
~~~~~~~~~

- Games are rated on a 0-5 scale. The average rating for a game will be 3.0. Games are 
  rated on how good the game is, and how anticipated the title is. 

- Fixes are punished by deducting half the points for the game. If a competing group fixes
  the release, they recieve those points. If a fix is very minor in nature, or is embedded
  late in the game, a single or no deduction is possible. 

- Faction compliancy is NOT required to recieve points. If a faction compliant rip is
  released at any time without having essential gameplay components removed, it will
  supercede the previous attempt. 

- Trainers for games that rate higher than 4.0 will be given a half point. Only one trainer
  per group, per game can recieve points. This includes level skippers and cheat codes, as
  well as editors and multiplayer cheats. A truly remarkable trainer for a major game could
  recieve a full point.

- Patches are worth a half point. Major patches for important games could recieve a full 
  point.

- Addons for games are given a 1.0 addition provided the addon is not:

  (a) a movie addon of any kind... or
  (b) An essential component removed for faction compliance (3DFX)
  (c) For a below average (under 3.0) game
 
Any group may release a game addon, regardless of the original release group. Multiple 
addons packed within one release (a speech and music addon for example) may be given two 
points.

 Bud's Biased Utils Report #34
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Ho-hum... ok confession time. This weeks delay was my fault, I wasn't even
 close to ready... playing with some fucking hunting game which turns out
 to be unrippable... least I got the ISO done... anyways... I'm in a rush
 and don't want to delay this for much longer, so lets just dive right in. 
  
 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 09/14/99 to 09/20/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.


 Groups: (In no particular order)

 Another strong week from what is arguably the #1 group over the past few

 for the second straight version, leaving at least oh... lets say three groups
 wishing they had of been a little quicker. PWA also adds in the latest
 from NuMega (you know... those debugging guys ;)). A slew of Veribest
 stuff... and hurrrah! a Win2K build. Soon to be renamed Windows 3K or
 whatever the expected release date is determined to be.

 EROIICA.API.v4.4-CORP

 Second week in a row with a less than spectacular (very noticably less)
 showing from the Corporation. With Paradigm Plus being nuked on several
 sites, one tends to wonder where the Corp of past is at... even a few
 months ago, while they didn't always have top quality apps, they managed
 to make up for it with some variety.

 Two nice titles from XF this week, one an addition for Rational Software's
 Rational Rose, a top Visual Modeling app, the other Maya 2.5 Unlimited, a 
 look into what the next version of Maya holds. (Yes this is basically a beta,
 it's still a very long way off from completion).

 MindManager.3.5.5.SP2-PFT

 Exploding most of its titles onto the scene in one day, PFT pretty much 
 stuck to its usual selection of apps. The Backup Exec titles are starting
 to get tedious (is every little build necessary?). It is nice to see them
 support Netware however.

 First off, a correction. DOD has informed me that the keygen
 spread last week was a fake... so umm they loose the half a point
 or whatever I had awarded for that ;). This week we see one app
 and one in-house tool... since in the past I've awarded
 points for in-house creations (RBS, VRS) I'll continue to
 do so.

 he's satisfied now. Flo Series 6 is old, from about a year ago...
 RBS apparently "thought it was a shame no one released it" ...
 great I'll go redesign my toilet pipes now. J/K, errr well kinda...

 its strength against quantity, with only 4 apps Scum earns points
 to rival groups who put out over twice as much.

 RADIUM:

 Releases: N/A
 Total: N/A

 Since Radium didn't release anything this week, I thought I'd go back
 and look at a few of their past tools. Since i had some MP3 ripping to
 do, I figured I'd follow that vein. I settled on AudioActive Production
 Studio Pro, and aside from some difficulties with the Radium crack/loader
 (seems it didn't like my display settings much, and I couldn't see what I
 was doing), the app worked out well. Ripping CD's to WAV worked well once
 I got past a few snags, as did the codec I leeched (from Radium as well
 but I won't get into that, lack of time). Note for newbies to the MP3
 scene however (in which category I belong): Old (read: 12X or less)
 CDROM drives may not support long raw audio datastreams (as a big fat
 error informed me) - particularily in PanicSonic (err Panasonic)
 drives... which lead me to a nice new 50X... so I guess I'm happy :)

 PWA had a steady week, and it earned them top slot, but Scum is not to
 be discounted for a good effort. Not much going on in the utils scene
 this week, the fall games rush is starting to take precedence, but
 expect good apps in the weeks to come as usual.

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 


Blue Streak
Starring: Martin Lawrence
Rating: 2 3/4 out of 4 Stars

Well Martin Lawrence is back after a hiatus from movies and jail. This
film is about him being a bank robber who gets busted trying to jack
an 18 million dollar diamond. It fails and he hides the diamond in a 
ventilation shaft of a building that ends up being the LAPD. So he poses
as a detective to try to sneak in and get the diamond. Lot's of funny
shit and typical Martin comedy. It's a pretty funny film, but it isn't
exactly the funniest movie either. Worth a peak in matinee or VCD.

=----------------------------------=-------------------------------------=    

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is  usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear  people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination  of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.

Ryche's Really Biased VCD Group Report #20


Yes, yes.. I know I haven't done the report in quite a while. And guess what? I'm not
doing it this week either. I don't have time to analyze all the releases and all the
fuckups this week due to whatever excuse I can think of. I will give you what you 
want though, and recap what's fubared and what's worth getting from past few weeks.


THE GOOD:


-ExistenZ.VCD.SCREENER-PMTVCD

Really trippy movie from David Cronenberg about plugging into your mind. Starring Jennifer
Jason Leigh with lots of gross, strange cyber effects..


-Outside.Providence.SCREENER-EViLISO

New movie written by one of the Farrelly brothers who did Something About Mary. It's about
a kid with a working class family who gets enrolled in a upper-class school. It's full of
stoner humor and gags like SAM was..


-Iron.Giant.Telesync-VCD-Infinity

No idea who VCDI are.. don't really care, but they did release a complete telesync of the
animated movie which got rave reviews all around right after VCD-Europe put out an 
incomplete workprint. If your sites didn't keep this version, they made a mistake. If you
really want to see this movie, find this version.


-Entrapment.SCREENER.VCD-EViLISO

Catherine Zeta Jones` ass in pure screener glory.. gimme more!


-In.Too.Deep.Telesync.VCD-EViLISO

Almost as good as a Widescreen screener, lots of action, undercover cops in trouble, and
drugs! LL Cool J almost appears cool in this one..



THE BAD:

-Austin.Powers.TSWSM.Screener-VCD-Europe

Picture is nice, but there is this HORRIBLE crackling sound throughout the entire movie
which ruins the idea of downloading this screener.


-Iron.Giant.Workprint-VCD-Europe

I missed this one when it first came out because I figured it was just a screener with the
editing codes on it. Boy, was I wrong. It has incomplete scenes and storyboard like 
drawings. Would have been nice if it came out BEFORE it hit theatres, but since it didn't
its a wasted release.


-My.Brother.The.Pig.SCREENER.VCD-EViLISO

Talking pig.. Daniel Stern.. What were you thinking?!



THE UGLY:

-The.Blair.Witch.Project.Screener-CENTROPY

The ending tells you to buy the VHS or the DVD and its missing the last 10 freaking 
minutes!! Nice one.


-Stir.of.Echos.Screener-VCD-Europe

Too bad the sound doesnt match thier mouths on the last CD. Completely out of sync.


-Universal.Soldier.The.Return.REAL.TS-VCD-Europe

The first one was nuked because it had subtitles, not because it wasn't a Telesync. This
one has subtitles too making it a dupe of TWCiSO. Kaboom 2x..


SPECIAL MENTION:

Run_Lola_Run_Screener-UL

I know this is a bit late, but I like to let nukers know what morons they are by not being
informed about good films. This one is a german film, with english subtitles. It has a pure
trance/techno score and the entire movie takes place with Lola trying to help her boyfriend
who is in a world of shit and has 20 minutes to get out of it. Look for it at the Oscars
to be nominated or grab the Best Foreign Film Award.


      
                                                    We be rolling..
                                                      - Ryche -



=----------------------------------=-------------------------------------=


-----------[The Scene News]-----------

All the news thats fit to print... 
and then some...

I should pay more attention to the scene.

Aod stole some boxes, dev stole some, amn stole some..and we all fall down.

VCD groups suck ass because they release subtitled releases instead of
GOOD releases.

Jaydee is on vacation, so not as many shitty releases for a few weeks!



--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors, we all love them even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us. And these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, your name will not be included, but we
do not add rumors like that say "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion"
because we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore
there is no hard evidence of that rumor, so if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!

Rumor has it that one of the top 3 courier groups is going to break apart.

Rumor has it that NWR should have been on time!

Rumor has it that Ndetroit's body has been found and an autopsy is being
performed. Photos by TDP will be in the next few issues.

Rumor has it I cannot get into #corp for the life of me.

Rumor has it that if DIVINE and OGN would merge they would own the european
hunting scene.

=-------------------------------------=--------------------------------------=


Well friends.. Thats about it. If you've read this far, we sincerly thank you.
We like to know this thing gets read, so if you get the time, drop one of us
a quick msg, and tell us what you think, give us suggestions, tell us it sucks,
or just say "hi" to us!....

Greets fly out to: Ryche, Blitz, Mandrake, The Dark Priest, Glen, Novocaine,
Tech, Indigo, Stix, Zeus, Burnt, Cedric, Bud, Ndetroit, and ELOCIN!
