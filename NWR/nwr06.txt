                    NETMONKEY WEEKEND REPORT ISSUE #6!

	This is now Issue Number 6 and we are still out before everyone else,
like usual :). Not much real news this Week, MNM did good, but there is no
telling how long this will last, and DMS is kinda down in the Dumps. Not much
from Risc, and Devotion still has their steady megs. Anyways this all of
course, is noticeable in the report.  The week was rather slow, so we have
some low numbers, but there will always be weeks like this. Anyways, Enjoy.
Don't forget to read Lester's Biased Courier Report, and don't take it to
seriously =).

Lester's Biased Courier Report!@

Well here it is kids, my little tribute to JJ's biased utils report from INQ.
and of course it's biased because how could I be objective when I run
Dimension, I hate Risc, and I'm fathering Xtremist's child? I can't, so
I'll be biased and make fun of everyone..:) Enjoy, and remember dont get
so upset, it's fun to make fun of yourself.
So the format is like this, I'll review each group, and then I'll point out 
some interesting things from the week and whatever else I feel like saying.
Rating System is whatever I feel like making it..:)


Ugh, Well once again I was pretty busy this week so I didn't get any 
in depth scoopage. Some things happened that I noticed though, and I'll
comment on group performances as usual.

Dimension: Pretty down week for the DMS boys, must say I'm not too happy
with that, but most ppl had a good reasoon so I will not castrate anyone
just yet.

Overall: Underachieving

Risc:  Still reeling from the loss of Geno and Morbid, Risc not having
a great time again this week. They may need to try to pick up some new
guys or get something going soon.

Overall:  Struggling Internally

Devotion:  Allanon, Garoto, Dragoth. the 3-some keeps Dev going and keeps
them showing up on tops of sites, so you gotta give those 3 some credit
but it'd be nice to see more of that group get going.

Overall: Consistantly Even

Atomic-X: Well Dee was quite proud of his boys for their placing in the
last week of JAM, and I was too, they are really doing well, despite all
the ppl trying to recruit their new guys. We will see if they can hold
it all together and keep rising. A fresh group, or as alot of ppl will see
it, fresh blood.

Overall:  Very Good

Millenium: They somehow got Dual to join up with them, something that
surprised me a great deal. But with that pickup and Red Obelisk popping
up from time to time, MNM could possibly be rising from the grave, but
I'm still not convinced..:)

Overall:  Twitching

FreeAgent: Now, this puzzles me, the whole point of a free agent is to
be on the open market and look to be signed by a team. but all the current
free agents wish to remain IND and not sign up with new teams. So free
agent is a contradiction, so get a better IND name..:)

Overall: Who cares


Weekly Shit: Well I got to talk to Geno for a little bit, and so now
that he's not Risc and we dont have that animosity of DMS/Risc, I have
decided he's not so bad afterall. Some of you kind of whined that I
went easy on everyone last week, and once again this week I am doing
the same, it's mostly because in order for me to rip on ppl, I have
to get the inside stuff, and when I'm busy as fuck, that just doesn't
always happen. Though I still could rip on mossyoak for our little
fight regarding the last issue, but that gets boring. Or I could randomly
rip on groups just to do so. But if it's not a current event, it's not
worth my time..:) Oh, last week JAM the mag run by Muggs put out a 
double issue and gave NWR/Me some props for the little courier report
he did, and so I respect that and hope he keeps doing it. Maybe then
ppl will realize it's not just me trying to tear everyone to pieces. 
What do you know, it's Saturday and finally got some good stuff!

d:0 sacx     MNM       1167189 May 16 20:58 dsi_gh5d.zip.bad(23)
I didn't feel it neccesary to paste all 23, but you get the idea. 23
bads of all the same size. Quite interesting wouldn't you say? I
guess MNM hasn't changed their ways.

Turns out Muggs is going to keep doing his own courier report, so that's 
good we will see if he has the same feelings I do about certain issues.:P
Cya next week, I promise to pay more attention:)
