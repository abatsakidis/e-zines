    Thank you!


    Well, Tuesday is rls date from now on folks. So stop bugging us about shit. 
    NWR webpage is coming along quite nicely! Special thanks to Thrag and Golden 
    for all the work they are doing. Tdpriest is currently deep undercover and next 
    week we should have the full story from him with photos and all! Also email us 
    now at nwr@buffymail.com with anything you want to say to us. :P If you want to 
    do the VCD MOVIE reviews for NWR, please email us and volunteer. The group 
    report will remain done by Ryche, since he is truly evil and fits right in with 
    us.

       `"` | `"`  Well.. its been a shitty week for me. I would like to be 
    mad at monkey-boy and his lover tdape for releasing without me, but there 
    are more important things that need to be dealt with right now...

    Yeah.. that whole glftpd thing kind of made me wonder. We are getting
    fucking SLOPPY people. The busts are coming.. trust me.. it won't be
    pretty, so do what you can now to protect yourself. I guarantee they
    will get more this time than they did in cyberstrike.

    But onto happier things, for now... i am back (yay!..?) Prozac is also
    back, with a pretty good games report. Bud is away, but ryche is here 
    doing his wacky thing, so.. nice work. 
    
    As lester mentioned before, tdpriest is on assignment, but he did manage
    to email me a few fucking AMAZING pics.. 
  
    the first 2 are of the secret elite RISC TOUR BUSES... 

    That's right.. When RiSC needs to travel to courier conventions, or 
    trading competitions, they go in STYLE..
    Its a thing of beauty... riscbus1.jpg and riscbus2.jpg...
        
    The 3rd pic is one that tdpriest drew in his spare time. He says that he
    was "inspired", after meeting riches in person.. that is riches01.jpg

    Have a good week everyone, and ... be careful..... ;/

 You have mail.
 motd:
 Son, someday a man is going to walk up to you with a deck of cards on which
 the seal is not yet broken.  And he is going to offer to bet you that he can
 make the Ace of Spades jump out of the deck and squirt cider in your ears.
 But son, do not bet this man, for you will end up with a ear full of cider.
                 -- Sky Masterson's Father

(seriously, that was the MOTD on my shell!!!!!!)


-----------[ ndetroit's sites and stats section ]-----------

    
        
    Hey there... Ok... i got a lot of important news, and i am not overly
  sure which is the most important, but.. read on, and you will find out.

    Glftpd siteops: please read our special report on glftpd for more details.

    First off, NEC is down. It was NOT narked, as previously claimed, it was
  found out by the admins, who noticed a sudden *cough* spike* cough* in 
  bandwidth. NEC is down, and will not be returning... I don't know all the
  staff on that site, but i know nutcase was staff there, and he is a great
  guy, so i am quite sorry to see it go.. ;/

    Ok, now that i have talked about that, i will say this: glftpd is backdoored.

    Big surprise? not really, everyone knew it was there somewhere..
    But the backdoor got used on a prominent scene site, by a member of the glftpd
    "coding team" (!?!).. read about this in our glftpd article, and if you are a
    siteop, i would encourage you to take this VERY seriously, and consider switching.
    Immediately.

  On to some more sad news: TV/TViSO/TVVCD are all down. However, it is not due to
  the siteop "wanting to concentrate on his studies", or... not entirely so. There
  have been some bad busts lately by the RIAA, and RIT.EDU was hit pretty hard.
  TV and its affiliate sites were one of the casualties.. almost by accident.. ;(
  The siteop would like to warn everyone against running a site at rit.edu right now,
  as that would be an INCREDIBLY stupid idea. Our thoughts are with the siteop.

    Some news that i missed last week, when tms was published by a group of 
  monkeys at typriters:
    
    RDX has some new staff: trinidad and sanctuary hooked up there, giving that
  site INSTANT credibility.. bones canned hazzy and dee, and renamed the site to
  "CAT" (wtf?) and claims it will be top10 in a matter of weeks.

    With the loss of TV, E became OGN whq, making it super k-rad-leet. Congrats
  to them.
    2 more old sites came back up: BB4 (the continuation of the 3 other bb sites)
  is back: corp, pdm, darkstar..  And DF is back as DF3.. I am not overly sure what
  is going on there, but i *think* it merged with ROOT... anyways, its a DMS HQ now.

    And i guess the crappiest news that i missed while i was gone is that HOE
  is down for good.. I won't go into details, but HOE was one of my favorite
  sites.. i am sorry to see it go...

    msg me if you see me, exile.. ;p

=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. 
	Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... 
heh... fuck off and die..
=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=

          The Top Ten sites for this week are:

	                                
           x3 FS -*- STH -*- ET -*- E -*- FH
           x2 DLS -*- TOS -*- IC


 i didn't get any weektops this week, fuck it.. now that CWS is dead, give your
 weektops to me and lester... thx.. ;)

Biased Courier Report


Oooooooooooo ya bitches


Dimension: Well, Morbid told me I couldn't praise Gee for his trading because 
he was pre'ing. This is simply unacceptable. :P Gee pre'd like all hell, but he 
was trading alot too, so I must give him props as well. DMS continues to lose 
sites as TV/TMS are down. But they picked up Dafat 3 as USHQ towards the end of 
the week. Otherwise, DMS had people coming out of hibernation and owning a site 
here and there. No purely dominant traders other than Gee money though. We shall 
see how this week goes.


Devotion: The same people every week, and apparantly I have heard they picked up 
Xtase from M8. He was being recruited by alot of groups and nice job to Dev for 
getting him I guess. I haven't seen much of Jaydee since the HDS thing, so I don't 
have much to make fun of..:)


Risc: Jman retired from 0day trading, ouch..Kenzo is the life support, Risc's 
comeback is failing alot..


MNM: Kruzin wants out, you guys are once again truly fucked.


AOD: Not as super duper this week, Cedric is mr. reliable though and the others 
put up decent meggage to keep AOD on the up and up.


VGN: Darkwolf is active, and there's some pre'ing going on, but VGN is still VGN..
Hawkeye did msg me the other day though, but I was idle so dunno whats up with that. 
Maybe he wanted to merge..:)


OOmp!

AOD merging with every group in the scene! newest rumor around town

Prozac's Kinda Biased Gaming Report - #8

It seems some people are kicking ass, and others are being kicked in the dirt.
What is the scene coming to? In the past, people were hush about group secrets,
now people frigging blab about it in public or scene only channels! Welp after
missing the first week of March, I'm back and here to talk about what I missed
and what's going on. It's all nice and juicy this time around. Let's hit it!

Class-
Some say this group has gone to hell. Others (COUGH SMOKEY COUGH) say we're all
gonna die and shrivel up into nothing very soon. With only 2 games in two weeks
(and barely winning on Imp 2, with 2 other groups racing on this game), it's
just not the same. But you might have seen the stuff on RHQ about what's going
on. No need to repeat old news, as I also don't want to sound too pessimestic,
since this is the group I'm apart of. It's getting eerie actually. It'll
extremely interesting what happens over the last two weeks of March, and pull
themselves out of the slump.

Hot Releases:
NASCAR Craftman Trucks - 5 disks (DUPE)
Imperialism 2 - 16 disks

Paradigm-
Welp, they own the germans. They own the cracking scene. They own the inside.
They own the stores. This group is unstoppable. But they are also doing the
same things now what other groups have done in the past that hurt them in
future: Rushing on games. First they win the cracking battle on RollerCoaster
(two other groups were racing on this game), but mess up the package so you
could only play in 16-bit mode & the installer deleted the main .exe's, and a
fix was put out. FS:SODE has 240M of TEXTURES taken out to keep it under 50,
and the word is going around that after a few hours the game is almost
unplayable. I'm not in combat flight sims, so I didn't confirm this rumor.
Lastly, they manage to win on Redline (of course questioned because of an oddly
placed readme file), and the speech part is bunked with a fix put out to
alleviate this problem. How ironic, PDM use to rag on CLS on the past about
fux0ring up like this, now they do the same themselves. Not good.

I just have to say, WTF is up with doing a repack three german budget games,
and packaging them up and calling it "SupplierName Games". He didn't code the
damn thing! I find it kind of gey IMO. But it's just me. I think I'm going to
go to the store, get three Expert or Valu-Soft titles, and repack them as
"Prozzy's Game Pack". Ah don't pounce on me PDM; I just don't think it's right.
I mean why don't other groups do it? I just found it to be kind of stupid.

Hot Releases:
Bowlda Dash - 6 disks
Ultimate's Game Pack - 12 disks
RollerCoaster Tycoon - 23 disks
Flight Squadron: SDOE - 48 disks
Redline - 48 disks
Mephisto Genius 99 - 11 disks

Razor-
Welp it's now unofficially official, Razor sucks. There supposed shining
knight has come out of hiding (The Punisher), and has told people he's not
back and even discussed rumor of starting up his new group. This is after
putting out a very debatable release of Gex 2 (I give them credit for
releasing it, others think its not worth 25 disks for D3D support), then not
able to crack the iso protected games (The infamous Beo is not a GOD!). At
least they finally do an aussie game, beating CLS to the game. This group is
on a downward spiral, and I don't think even Trent Reznor is going help them
out of this.

Hot Releases:
GEX 2 USA FINAL - 25 disks
Australian Cricket Captain - 25 disks

Origin-
Ah the group I love to hate. While OGN is trying to argue that Premier
Manager 99 is valid release. I'm not going to debate anything, just present
the facts. The original rip was 50 disks (50 * 2.88M) plus these addons:

V.03-05-99: pm99db01.zip   ,  7, 19775 KB, 03-05-99,
Premiere.Manager.99.Database.Addon-ORIGIN
V.03-05-99: pm99sp01.zip   , 24, 66235 KB, 03-05-99,
Premiere.Manager.99.Speech.Addon-ORIGIN
V.03-05-99: pm99st01.zip   , 30, 83106 KB, 03-05-99,
 Premiere.Manager.99.Stadium.Addon-IND

You make the call. I'm also going give you a little blurb of a chat I had with
a OGN Senior.

<Blitz> Too bad, origin is one good USA guy away from kicking ass
<Prozac> Laugh, ive heard than since December ;)
<Blitz> where's our usa guy? =(

My past claims have mostly true about this group. LAUGH!

Hot Releases:
Premier Manager 99 - 50 disks.

Other-
Welp if PDM isn't putting out the games, then TBT & TPC are putting them out.
But it's known that these 2 groups are getting the games that are rejected by
the big groups as unreleasable or not that high of quality. Hey, a game is a
game. It might be j0nx, it might be cool, but it all should be pirated. Make
everything free to force the companies to make better quality games!

Hot Releases:
Bird Hunter Upland Edition 3D - 22 disks
Deer's Hunter - 18 disks
Smolensk to Moscow - 6 disks

Springer'ish Final Thoughts:
I've brought this up once before, but I think people are becoming way too open
about all this shit in the scene, and it's already biting back. I won't give
any names, but a scene friend of mine got "the talk" recently, and they knew
a lot of shit about this guy, and it frigging blew his mind what the feds
knew. It's also coming up as time when a bust should usually go down (There
have been busts in 91, 94 & 97.. year 2000 bust soon?). There have been
recent news articles about Reno & The Feds going to net investigating
illegal activities. Now with the Millenium Act, it's now a lot easier to
throw the book at pirates. Most of the time, "the talk" will get people
out of the scene permanently, but not always. Maybe I'm again being the
toothsayer, but I highly suggest covering your ass. GROUPS, MAKE ALL NFO'S
ANON. Don't feed the feds info about your pirate group, they read the nfo's
for a lot of information. You have been warned. :P

-----------[ Bud's Biased Utils Section ]-----------


 Bud was apparently unable to do a utils report this week, because he had
 "exams" the whole week.. This is, of course, totally unacceptable, and 
 we simply will not stand for such a poor NWR work ethic.
 Bud will be back with his utils report when he gets his priorities 
 straightened out, and realizes what is *really* important in the world...
 BAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH!

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 


Movie Reviews


Wing Commander 
Starring: Freddie Prinze Jr., Matthew Lillard
Rating: 1 1/2 Stars

Well, I saw this movie to get the second trailer of Star Wars, and if you get the 
trailer when you see it, then it's ok. But if you dont get the trailer, then you're 
fucked. Because this movie sucks alot. It rides the Star Wars hype to hopefully 
positive box office numbers. This will not happen, because word of mouth runs quick, 
and it's not good on this baby. Matthew Lillard(Stu from Scream), is at an alltime 
low here. He is just like a chipper dog in this film, he has no depth or even reason 
to be there. Freddie Prinze is the same character as every movie he is in. The plot 
really goes nowhere and the acting is truly pathetic. This is a flat and cheesy movie 
that seems like it was thrown together just because a new Star Wars is coming out. 
My advice is to buy the game and play that.

-----

The Rage: Carrie 2
Starring: People!
Rating: 2 1/2 Stars

They're all gonna laugh at you!@

We all know and remember that classic line as Carrie prepared for the prom. 
Flashforward twenty years to the 90's and Carrie's sister is all grown up. She has 
the same fucked up life and ability to move things with her mind. The storyline 
runs the same as the first. She starts to be normal and people fuck with her and 
watch out cuz she's an evil bitch, etc..I will point out one thing, watch for the 
kid from Home Improvement towards the end, you do not want to miss it. You'll know 
what I'm talkin about when you see it. 

=----------------------------------=-------------------------------------=

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

Telesync/TS: Telesync is a procam on a tripod in an empty theater with a 
separate audio source. If there's an audience, you hear people coughing, 
camera is shaky, etc. It's a CAM.    CAM = banned. If you want a movie 
extremely early, Telesync is the way it will be.

Workprint: Workprint is a pre-release copy of a movie, stolen copy, etc. 
that usually has the film running time on the screen.

Screener: Screener is usually the BEST quality, an actual vcd of the movie, 
made from a reviewers copy, etc. Screener's are generally released after 
movies have left the theaters.


Special Thanks to Ryche of EViLiSO for the education in VCD terms, and to 
come.to/vcddupe for keeping us up to date on the new titles.

Ryche's Really Biased VCD Group Report #6

I have absolutely NOTHING to review so therefore this report will reflect my 
feelings as to how lame this week actually was.

Releases from 3/7/99 - 3/13/99

031399 - Cruel Intentions - Screener - EViLiSO 
[NUKED] - Airspeed - Workprint -SERENiTY

- SERENiTY -

Your in this report simply because you put out a nuke and that was highlight this 
week.

Total- 0 Points

- EViLISO -

Cruel Intentions Screener was the only thing that made this week worth writing a 
report about. 7 days after its theatrical rls.. booya..

Total- 5 Points

W00p, Im through.. EViLISO without a doubt. Not a challenger in the bunch. Not even 
a release in the bunch. WTF?! Do something you slobs.. Im beginning to feel as 
useless as Lester is to a release group. GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DO!!

                                                       Y3k, the BIG problem.
                                                              Ryche


---------------------

Cruel Intentions VCD Review:
Video Quality=4/5. Not bad, pretty good quality, though not the best screener
i've ever seen. Couple glitches here and there and that stupid earth on the
right side of the screen, but it was never in the way.

Sound Quality=5/5. Nothing wrong here.

Movie Review=3.5/4 *'s. Pretty cool movie, very funny at that. One of the best
parts of the movie, was probably when Sebastian shoves cecil off the bed when
she tries to give head. Watching her get tossed was elite, kinda reminds me of
kruzin. Definately worth seeing.

=---------[ The truth about GLFTPD ]----------=

 Ok people, i would suggest that you read through this whole thing before you
 start jumping to conclusions. I removed the siteops name from the article for
 2 reasons, first, he is a siteop, and we try not to mention siteop names in 
 NWR.. Second, if what he is saying is true (and i believe him.. i have known
 him forever in the scene, and he has run a lot of top sites), then he has
 something to fear in the way of retribution from the glftpd.org ppl...
                                              -ndetroit


 -----------------
 A few weeks ago, ndetroit wrote a report about the various daemons available
 to the scene, comparing them. He gave glftpd very high marks. I am here to
 set the record straight.

 GLFTPD IS BACKDOORED.

 You can deny that however you want, but i can prove it.

 There have been rumors about the so-called "backdoor" code that was taken
 out, and put back in, and taken out again, etc, etc. Greyline, the coder
 of glftpd has gone on record to say that there is NO backdoor code.
 There is.

 Why am i saying this? glftpd certainly has to be a GODSEND to the scene.
 Its easy to set up. It has very few bugs. It has a TON of features, and is
 pretty damn customisable. What does greyline get out of coding it? Well, if
 he is like most open-source coders, he get HARASSED. He doesn't do it for 
 money (its free), and he doesn't seem to do it for fame (its a scene daemon,
 after all)... 
 But wait.. let me take that back. Glftpd is not open-source. Its binaries.
 Do *YOU* know what your computer is doing right now? ;p
 i didn't think so.

 When i started out writing this, i came to a sort of fork in the road. I could 
 either ignore this backdoor thing, for all the "good" greyline has done for the
 scene, or i could villify him, for putting in a backdoor.
 Hey, if he wants to put in a backdoor, then SO BE IT, ITS HIS DAEMON. 

 Yeah, thats one argument. But what if something more sinister was going on?
 What if greyline was logging in to YOUR site behind your back?
 What if he was sifting through you files? Your personal files (if you were stupid
 enough to store them on the box).. 
 
 Enough accusations, here's the facts:

 I just happened to be sifting through my syslog (as i do on a regular basis), when
 i noticed someone port-scanning the box:

 Mar 12 13:35:50 penguin tcplogd: port 29878 connection attempt from 
 root@thematrix.glftpd.org [216.76.63.220]

 Mar 12 13:36:38 penguin tcplogd: port 29883 connection attempt from 
 root@thematrix.glftpd.org [216.76.63.220]

 (etc, etc)

 Oh wait.. why would someone from glftpd.org be trying to make a tcp connection
 on MY box? I run a site, but... i don't have anyone who has a shell with that IP
 in it.. (i don't, i went through my userfiles, by HAND to make 100% sure.. )

 So i did a netstat -a .... and look at what i found:


 tcp        0    126 penguin.blah.net:1910 root@thematrix.glf:1378 ESTABLISHED 
 tcp        0      0 penguin.blah.net:1910 root@thematrix.glf:2465 FIN_WAIT2   


 You will notice the 1910... That is the data port of my FTP site. My glftpd site
 runs on port 1911. I don't know WHY someone would be connecting to my DATA PORT,
 do you?

 I logged into the site, and did a site who, and site swho. Guess what? no one
 was logged in.. Curiouser and curiouser... 
 
 Finally, i stumbled across this post in a public forum:



"Why do you suppose the included utility files in glftpd such as mv and unzip are 
 at least 4 to 5 times larger in size than they are supposed to be? 
 Here is the normal 

 /usr/bin: -rwxr-xr-x   1 root  root  12964 Apr 23  1998 mv* -rwxr-xr-x
                        1 root  root  81868 Mar 10 23:52 unzip* -rwxr-xr-x   
                        1 root  root  50908 May  7  1998 zip* 

 Here is a fresh copy of v15.7 unzipped: 
 	  -rwx------   1 root  root  141528 May 23  1998 mv* -rwx------
                     1 root  root  154761 Apr 25  1998 unzip* -rwx------
		         1 root  root  202652 Apr 25  1998 zip* 

 And why do you suppose I find my usernames and
 passwords buried in those files (after glftpd is installed and running) 
 And also what about finding strange script files on my machine in my /usr/lib 
 directory that contain the very same variables that are present in files like mv, 
 unzip, nuker, nukelogscanner, reset, and on and on.  
 Here is a small piece of one found in my /usr/lib directory. 

 ( /^BOR$/ {cmdnum++options=0cmdtab=""printf"staticcharconst*constssu%05d[] = {\n", 
 cmdnum > outfile } 

 The above snippet of code is designed to capture your keystrokes whenever you type 
 SU and then sends your password to a file. Why do you suppose glftpd would need to 
 capture keystrokes in order to obtain the root password for the machine?

Ok... now normally i would dismiss that as the rants of a scene lamer, but.. after
seeing what i saw in my logs, well.... what do you think? btw.. take a look at the
3 letters behind that dude nick... T H G.... you don't see many ppl claiming THG in
their affils list these days, do ya?  .... i think he's legit.


WHY WAS SOMEONE FROM GLFTPD.ORG LOGGED IN ON THE DATA PORT TO MY SITE? WHY WERE
THEY PORTSCANNING MY LINUX BOX? ;p
WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE ANSWER THIS?
                                                  -(name withheld)



 Ok, there you have the claims and the facts presented. Incidently, on debian boxes,
 (which is what i run) you can find the syslog in /var/log/syslog. Additionally, you
 might want to check out "daemon.log" and its archives. 

 I tried to find SOMEONE from glftpd.org for a comment, but everyone was silent. One
 op in the channel, who spoke on condition of anonimity confirms the backdoor code, 
 and says that when he tried to ask greyline about it, greyline said that it was better
 if he did not talk about it. #glftpd is strangely silent about this. 

 I am not sure what to write now. If this is true, then a best-case scenerio is that
 greyline (and whoever else) is a great coder who gets his kicks out of backdooring 
 into other ppls boxes. A worst-case scenerio is that greyline et. al are all feds,
 and glftpd is just about the most incriminating thing in history.
 In any case, i would suggest that you take a long hard look at your own systems,
 and come to your own conclusions.

 The ramifications of this are immense. If ppl take this seriously (and they should), 
 then 50 sites need to go down tonight, and stay down until they are 100% confident
 in their daemon. 
 The reason why we sat on this story for so long is that we did not want to smear the
 good name of glftpd.org.  I am printing it now, because i believe the information
 to be true, and i think that NWR *owes* it to the scene to inform ppl about this.
 For once, people can say that nwr did the scene some good....
 take care everyone...

-----------[The Scene News]-----------

All the news thats fit to print... 
and then some...


-Ok people.
 Glftpd is backdoored, and the backdoor WILL be used against you. Find a new
 daemon. 

-ok, so.. WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON WITH THAT WHOLE CHINABLUE THING??? 
 bahahahaha... ridiculous... on one hand, i'd like to say that its pretty wacky
 if class needs to be THAT badly motivated, and ... aren't you retired chinablue?
 On the other hand, i would like a p3-500.

 I saw there was a category there for "best promoter".. At this time, i would like
 to call to attention my unfailing praise and worship for what has certainly been
 THE best games group, in the history of the scene. Class is the best, something
 certainly proved by their stellar performance so far into the 1999 season.
 
 Man.. Class has gotten just about every single release so far.. all the big ones..
 wow.. they are on a roll, and are DEFINATELY the group to beat. 
 Ermm... *cough*  i am really poor... please just send money, chinablue, so i can
 pay my rent.. ;/

 Seriously tho, no matter what happens you KNOW it will be hilarious... I kinda like
 to see some competition in the scene. Of course, i would like it if it was competition
 for competition's sake, but hell.. a little greed never killed anyone.. ;p
 GOOD LUCK TO ALL INVOLVED!

-i guess isn't an active trader any more?? hahahaha.. he was just about the
 best thing that risc had going for it.. ;) i guess they still got aldog, and
 bizzy2... ermm.. i mean kenzo..

-group moves: lester to ogn, cablegod is DMS, fain joins DMS(!), smokey
 to pdm, cb retires from cls, jman retires from trading, tirre leaves CORP,
 
-the deal with the whole FH thing is that madboy (fh siteop) apparently was sifting
 through ogn's pre dir, and tipped off pdm about the ogn release, causing ogn
 to rush the release, and partially botch it.. bah! bad madboy! stupid! stupid!..
 in any case, things got patched up there, and everyone is all lovey-duvey now.. ;p

-CWS is gone. I know this is not news, but as far as i am concerned, if tech
 and duranged are not doing it, then CWS is gone.. I used to dual-write for CWS
 for a while, so i will miss them.. ;(
 Good luck tech and duranged... 

-if you see someone with the IP of: ~bobo@cgowave-10-02.cgocable.net or 
 ~handjob@cgowave-10-02.cgocable.net, please packet them. Thank you.

-Well, it looks like Karl has gone out and proved me wrong.. ndt tells me that
 karl has been out owning channels at will, and even did a few requests! ;)
 it remains to be seen whether or not karl is still lame, but at least he
 proved that he has some hax0rizing skillz.. ;p

-And finally: 
| 21346 | youthx   | RiSC      |  1d  1h | Idling For  1m  1s           |

its nice to see that RiSC has recruited some good young traders to keep up
the legacy.. look at the stamina on that boy!!  
bizzy is gone, but his legend lives on!!!!

Ahh yes, rumors, we all love them even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us. And these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, your name will not be included, but we
do not add rumors like that say "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion"
because we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore
there is no hard evidence of that rumor, so if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!
