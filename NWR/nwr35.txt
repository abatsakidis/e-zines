    Thank you!


    Well guys, we are late by 1 day this week, and for once it's not Nd's 
    fault. I could not stay awake to do anything yesterday so it's my bad. 
    We have a guest spot on the Biased courier Report because I was too 
    lazy to do it. So thank you to whoever does it. 
    Our webpage should be up with this release, hopefully ND will mention 
    it and we also have a new section. It is called "A walk down memory 
    lane." We will pull articles from old magazines (primarily INQ and 
    WWN to avoid anyone getting mad at us) and place them in here to 
    refresh you newbies on the old scene.
    Also, until our page is 100%. Blackacid is adding our Survey Questions 
    to his webpage. So please check it out and vote and we will include the 
    results in the following issue or 2. You can find it at : 
    207.236.110.39/tca

    Alright.. issue 35.. and we are almost on time this week!!
    Got 3 logs this week:
    1. Aldog.log = the story of his little escapade on STH..
    2. Eternal.txt = a cute chat between eternal and glen..
    3. Biohazard.txt = was BHZ narked? nope.. not according to this!
  
    And tdpriest returns, with a nice pic from buglord's funeral, in
    S. Florida.. A sad event, but we felt we owed it to the scene to 
    give buglord the dignity he deserves in his final resting place.

    Coming next week: a log from chill's friend, cedric, that proves
    chill is not a cheater, as previously mused in NWR!   

    I gotta greet diztorted this week, cause he owns me.. Shouts also to
    greenback, who is doing a HELL of a job with #ts.. and rdwarlock, what
    an artist!!!

    Our channel, #nwr, is in full effect, and you won't find a better place
    in the whole scene to get into a big fight at... ;p Thanks to darklogic
    for hooking us up with a bot... 

    Our new section is in effect this week... A *tad* long for my liking,
    but hell.. if you don't wanna read it, don't read it.. i'm not gonna
    hold a gun to your heard.. My, i like to put a little cajan pepper
    on it...

    Lets turn it up a coupla notches...

-----------[ ndetroit's sites and stats section ]-----------

    
    Well.. its been a pretty good week. No narkings, and everyone seems
  mostly content not to kill each other..

    But i guess the biggest news, (or non-news) is that HOE was debating
  dropping DMS, for DEV. Now i have seen it reported on sites that HOE had
  already unofficially dropped DMS, and had already taken DEV. This as it
  turns out is completely wrong. As of writing this, HOE is FIRMLY a DMS
  site, and will stay there indefinately, provided the support is there.
  Who is to say whether or not DMS support will pick up or not.

    One of the reasons why it was going to go to DEV in the first place
  was because DEV helped to find the HOE staff a new link to host the site
  on.. That, coupled with the fact that DEV had been doing well on the 
  weektop recently (tho not as well as AoD!!), pushed some of the siteops
  strongly in the dev direction. 
    But it was not to be. The HOE staff remained loyal to DMS in the end,
  and will keep the site there. (this info i got straight from the siteops,
  so if it ends up otherwise, don't blame me!)

    Man.. i don't know if this is really sad, or fucking hilarious... but..
  MDK's box got.. *cough*stolen*cough*. 
    In just a short time, mdk became one of the top sites in the scene, 
  due to the fast link, nice daemon, and hard work of the siteops.. Its 
  certainly sad to know that the site is gone and probably won't be back 
  in the form that we remember it...  Greets to duranged, gee_money, + dth..

    NCT (Nocturne) is gone forever. In just a short time, the site became
  MnM WHQ, RBS WHQ, and DNG WHQ. Wow.. quite a nice lot of good affils. I
  hate to say it, but ... *cough*mnmisdead*cough*... (oh, thats soooo old)
    Anyways, the siteop shut the site down because he had to move out of his
  apt that had the sweet link! (this i got from bacid's page!)

    I guess AF1 is back, and kicking a lot of ass.. They picked up KAC,
  and HTG (are they still around?).. so that is pretty good. 
    A new Euro site is NGZ. It's fallen/dms/shock, and also has an ISO/PSX
  section, with DVNiSO/COiSO affils there.
    Well.. i hate to make hasty judgements, but it sure looks like MSV
  has been a bit of a bust so far. Most of DEV doesn't bother to support
  it, and traders are complaining that it is "too much like a whole lot
  of other sites out there".... that may be true, but MSV always managed
  to set itself apart before... we'll see what happens.

    LA, one the oldest sites ever (5+ years now) has become PDM EHQ. A good
  choice by pdm, LA is a well respected site, tho the risc support has not 
  been as good as it was in previous year.. Nonetheless, that has to be
  seen as a positive for PDM.

    The famous north american site, TMS, picked up an OGN affil this week. 
  This will work out well for the huge ogn team, as tms has a beauty archive.     
  The Mother Superior's affils now stand at DMS/KAC/PRM/OGN... a good list.

    Uhh.. apparently FH is going to become TPC WHQ... wtf?? Ok.. well.. leet.

    Huge thanks to tirre, duranged, and tech this week, for all the
  weektops. Top10 is mostly accurate this week, so enjoy.. ;)
  

=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. 
	Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... 
heh... fuck off and die..

Biased Courier Repot


Ok ladies and gentlemen.. Lester was tired from all the masturbation/movie
watching this week, so i thought i would put my phearsome trading skillz
to use and do the biased curry report... Here we go!


Dimension: Not a lot going here, but mrpumpkin is his usual consistent self,
and they picked up exhume from the ship of drowning rats that some people
like to call "Millenium".. Bit of a scare with the whole HOE thing, but
blah.. they pulled out of it all as usual.. 


Devotion: Godbless! Garoto! Jaydee! (bahahah).. 3 people in our top 10 is
some nice work. Too bad godbless's macros had a bit of meltdown midweek 
there.. Nice to see garoto back in action after the breast reduction surgery.
I wanna be a prewhore.


AOD: Cedric did some ass kicking, or, as they say in his home country "le ass-
kicking".. or something.. Nice that AoD has a place to call home now in FH..
Too bad the site became TPC WHQ.. *cough*cough*. Morbid also showed up to play,
so 2 scoops of raisins to him.


RiSC: So... Its getting harder and harder to cut down RiSC these days on
the basis of the dying dynasty.. because its dead. After eternal "didn't
see anything wrong" with aldog changing his group to DEV on STH so that
STH wouldn't win, RiSC basically raised the white flag. No traders in the 
weektop, now that most siteops have woken the fuck up and deleted kruzin-the-
wonder-dog.... Look for a midweek news item: RiSC and MnM to merge!

Motiv8: not dead?

Equality: yes.

VGN: jess... stop playing on msgboards, start trading.. ;p Bleh.. fuck it,
the same could be said for myself... Ok, we'll have a competition next
week, jess0r... <g>


Ok.. so this Biased report sucks, but wtf do i know about trading? ;p

-----------[ Prozac's Kinda Biased Gaming Report]-----------
            

Prozac is away again this week, and we wish him a speedy return, as he
straightens out the shit in his personal life... Word on the street is
that he will be back for next week..


=----------------------------------=--------------------------------------=

-----------[ Bud's Biased Utils Section ]-----------


 Bud's Biased Utils Report #10
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Here we are back on track... a few changes to the field this week. ACE is
 now defunct and off the list, and I've decided to remove HTG simpliy
 because they don't have the releases to compete with the rest of the pack...
 I have nothing but good wishes for them however, and hopefully with some
 hard work they can make it back. Entity closed its doors this week, and
 many ENT members have gone to RISE, more on those happenings later. That 
 said, some slots have opened up - expect to see Radium and FCN on the list, 
 although not this week due to time constraints.
                             
 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 02/07/99 to 02/13/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.

 Groups: (In no particular order)

 Intergraph.Inroads.Comm-it.01.00.01.00-PWA            [01 x 2.88MB]

 Two helpings of PWA's standard fare this week. An oversized beta, and for
 desert, a helping of Integraph, one of PWA's old reliable sources for
 releasing. Intergraph I'm fine with, and I'm sure PWA will go on owning
 their titles for some time (along with MS ;)). The beta leaves me
 wondering... PWA is one of the few groups I believe when they say they
 release for the end user, so releasing CD9 at this size is questionable.
 They've excluded a large segment of the end users who are't going to want
 to download 200 or so megs... I'm sure something could have been worked out
 to avoid this, but it wasn't done. I just hope the final doesn't follow
 the same path.

 GraphicsCorp.Electronic.Card.Maker.v.1.0-CORP [01 x 1.44MB]

 A bunch of nice store titles for Corp this week, although none are
 exactly "anticipated", and a few have been out for a while. 3D Home
 Architect was actually released earlier by RiSE but didn't work. Personally
 I prefer Print Artist out of this group, it's one of those titles where the
 store edition comes with a ton of clipart, which I have enough of already.
 It isn't the greatest desktop publishing suite, and pales in comparison
 to MS enteries into the field, but it's still decent. Overall a good
 clean week for Corp.

 RISE:

 Releases: 

 IBM.CORP.SANFRANCISCO.v1.3.FINAL-RiSE [39 x 2.88MB]
 Internet_Scanner_V5.6-RiSE            [05 x 2.88MB]

 It has been an *extremely* busy week for the RiSE crew. First off, 
 more membership pickups, impressive ones at that. Lets look at the past 
 while for the RISE family. They picked up Powertool (LND leader) as well 
 as several LND members back in January, adding some supplying power. They
 saw Drizzit join, who is well known for store pickups. With the demise of
 Entity, they picked up several people, as Bones brought with him the 
 majority of the active ENT members when he joined RISE. Lester parted ways 
 with Siege, and he and Tdpriest joined the team, as did Cadman. Most
 recently, Bildo from LND and Knoweffx (DNG leader) joined as well.
 
 Expect great things from RiSE in the next while. They're a group that seems
 like they have a fucking magnet implanted in them <G>. The question is will
 RiSE be able to avoid major growing pains. Grind left RiSE at the end of the
 week citing unhappiness with the way changes were going, and IdyllWild was
 kicked... but so far from the rest of the crew I've spoken to, people seem
 very happy.

 On the release side of things, two titles, one looking especially 
 interesting - IBM's Java Development app. IBM apps are kinda hit or miss in
 my experience, I generally love 'em or hate 'em. San Fran goes on the plus
 side, it looks like a very solid package, although I'm not sure how many of
 the components will actually be viable... well I only play with Java for fun
 anyways so in my case it doesn't matter, but serious developers should still
 definately check it out. Internet Scanner is middle of the road, but the
 releases this week should pave the way for the future, with RiSE doing
 more mainstream apps.

 Well.. how to start this off. I have to comment on the happenings over
 the past while, even though scene politics aren't my favorite subject.
 Lester and SGE have parted ways - and despite the fact that he may not have
 been contributing as much as some people would have liked, you have to 
 question any group that would drop him. Considering what he's done in
 the past, keeping groups like LND and DOD alive during tough times in
 their history, it makes you wonder what group wouldn't do anything to keep
 him. But things change, and it isn't really what happened that bugs me...

 Lester was asked to leave SGE for everyones interest, and agreed... so
 I think it's in poor taste when I see SGE members boasting that they
 kicked Lester. It's simply disrespectful, no matter what their current
 relationship is. And for those of you messaging me, no I don't, and never 
 will, give points for the Alpha platform - CB was mistaken, look back to 
 reports 5 and 6 and you'll see that I gave points only to the Intel editions
 of the RISE titles she was commenting on.

 The loss of a few players isn't going to cause SGE to slump, they
 still have plenty of talent. They will own the graphics apps as always.
 Still I find it hard to believe that there isn't a wee bit of doubt
 in the minds of some members.. but who knows. 

 For the titles, what actually count, I can only label the week as fair,
 some nice titles, but they don't stand out the way some of the other
 titles of the previous seen days did. They were also forced to 
 release a fix for their earlier Panopticum release, but since points
 weren't given the week the original came out, I won't dock them.

 Another sluggish week for XF. Nothing happening... with the amount of
 titles coming out, these guys should be able to do SOMETHING, but they're
 not. And don't tell me that they're waiting for a quality app to come around,
 since when they have released recently, it hasn't been anything close to
 spectacular.

 We saw the usual bunch of characters from SHK this week, more RogueWave
 apps, a company which they completey OWN, with the exception of the StingRay
 division which XF/FCN have taken most of recently. Hightlight of the week
 goes to IPSwitch's IMail Server 5, although they also put out a rare (for
 SHK) design app in Autocad's Planix Home Design 3D... but it was a minor
 version. All in all a decent week, and with the excellent site pickups and
 member editions recently, expect them to keep up the pace. (How's THAT
 for bias!)

 Ummm... AS400 ? Sorry, but I won't be giving any points for that...
 I also have to question PFT for releasing an upgrade patch for Micropath
 2001 right after releasing the main app... why not include it... make 
 a WITH.UPGRADE dir or something... its no big deal except now someone
 has to track it down seperately if they want it. Whatever, I'm just
 too picky <g>. Something that did impress me was the lack of class c 
 versions and such for the most part... PFT are great at mass releasing,
 but I often see too many relatively unecessary minor versions... so
 a nice change this week. OmniPage Web is the best of the selection here.

 LND may have more fake dirs created in their "honor" than any other group
 in history... that aside, LND did release one very nice title in
 DesignSpace Enterprise. But...

 *NOTE* If the release does not work. Contact us. We did not find any kind 
 of protection. 

 That kinda makes me wonder, but sure... so long as it works, although if
 they tested it fully, there shouldn't be any question.

 Then we come to Plastic Advisor... ummm.. my advice is don't inhale the
 fumes while burning plastic. :P Whatever... PTC Pro Engineer is a great
 release, but this addon is extremely limited.

 What a difference a month or two makes. In December I honestly didn't think
 these guys would make it to summer... but things certainly have changed.
 With Kirk Hammit at the helm, PNC have made the first official comeback of
 the year. Definately one of the top groups of the past week.

 There was some contreversy started up about PNC stealing a release from
 some group I've never heard of... FTD. Anyways the leader of said group
 retracted his accusation, and I can further put it to rest. FTD said
 something about recieving VSI Fax before its release date - "this app
 isn't available to the public and was supplied to us pre-release." This
 is a joke - perhaps they thought they got it early, but VSI Fax products
 can be easily obtained via the VSI ftp site, are publically available.
 They just just need a crack - and the v3.5 series has been there since
 the end of december.

 Kudos to PNC for a very solid performance this past week.

 Well, it's the first week since PRM's return since they've REALLY mass
 released like the groups earlier incarnations. And like the group of
 old we saw several fuckups.. but the difference is, this time round
 they FIXED what was wrong. I have to dock a point for Kali's nuke as well
 as several fucked up packs and another broken app, but overall they
 picked up after themselves and put out a large number of titles, even
 if they weren't all top quality. Mass doesn't make up for quality titles
 however, so even with all the releases, minus that point they're only
 in the middle of the field.

 Coming off of a very impressive week to start Febuary, DOD slowed somewhat
 and went back to the AV releases we all know and love. ;) I'm hoping for
 some more active periods in the weeks to come.

 candidates when it comes to FTP client software. Besides, whats to make
 them switch to UltraFTP? Well, it offers the astounding ability to upload
 AND download files... gee and I thought you needed a seperate program to do
 each. ;P On the up side, the cracking section of MFD got Visible Analyst
 done, it fits into the utils category fairly well, and while it's been
 available for some time, the protection on it was fairly difficult. Only
 other MFD title worth mentioning was a dupe of SHK's IMail Server 5...
 anyways a dissappointing week from this crew.

 There seems to be a trend in poor oversized rips this week,
 and RBS (and its users) are the victims this time round. 2020
 Designer 5.1 (aka 2020 Advanced Designer's Kit) is professional
 kitchen design software. So big deal? Well, this is the package
 Home Depot uses to design kitchens, and while I'm not sure I'd 
 want them to design mine, it is a very nice package. The thing
 here is that it did not need to be 136 megs, there was no reason
 it couldn't have been ripped down to a respectable size.
 The rest of the week was average from RBS, nothing else
 appeals to me so I'll leave it to that.

 A fairly poor week for TRPS in my eyes, they did ok on the cracking
 side of things, but as far as actual mainstream utils go, they didn't
 have much of a showing. I also have to point something else out (after
 all I have to keep this edition interesting!)
 
 Easy.CD-DA.Extractor.v3.04.912.Dissin.To.a.Lamer.Like.BaMa-TRPS

 Now it's bad enough that certain games groups feel the need to write
 20 page manifesto's and personal bashing in their NFO's, but it's
 starting to get really sad... over a minor version of an app like Easy
 CD-DA, and to even bring the dir name into it... Now TRPS isn't the only
 offender here, but they got picked as my example... anyways enough of shit
 like this, keep the NFO's about the damn program you're releasing... and
 if you're releasing a FINAL after someone fucked up and Beta'd, or anything
 like that, explain it that way, there's no need for personal flamings.
 (I should note that TRPS's long NFO bitch was in response to some other
 NFO bitching done by MFD, and in both cases all I have to save is
 "Who gives a fuck").

 I guess now we get to put up with a billion or so 99 editions. Savings
 Bond Tracker needed a fix, and I cashed in all my bonds anyways. ;P
 I've also outgrown comic books, but I guess in a scene with such a large
 amount of youngsters... well I'm being to hard on VRS here, despite
 the fact that they didn't release anything great, they stayed out of shit,
 which is more than I can say for a lot of the groups this week.

 Idle this week: A fond farewell to Entity and Ace, and to HTG, who I will
                 return to the list when they pick things up a bit.
                 SDM and XF were idle. 

 Quote of the Week: <[grind]> whats nwr?

 The ultimate quote of the week goes to fuckup Mortin, who's currently
 holding Game Over's domain for ransom. His reponse to realizing anyone
 could get his info by doing a whois on game-over.net:
 
 <mortin> my mother is a lawyer for the united states government
 <mortin> if you call my house
 <mortin> we can get a tap on it so quick, it will make your head spin

 By the way I'm the tooth fairy, and all you punks owe me about
 10 billion in change.... it's time to collect. Those were LOANS!!

 Give it to Corp. Special mention to PFT and PNC for strong weeks.
 Thats really all I have to say about performances this week, other than
 I was dissappointed by a few usually excellent groups.. and a last note
 about RISE, who never fail to impress me. With so many people flocking to
 RiSE it's hard to imagine that they won't stir things up in the near future
 (ok guys having said that you BETTER fucking kick some ass or I'll make
 myself look like a BIGGER idiot ;)). So watch for them in the next while. 

 Next week I'll have my review as normal, with a little something extra. 
 It will be Report #11, which, and with next weeks scores, it means all 
 groups now have a total out of 100. (Issue 9 was guest authors and had
 none). So I'll be listing each groups performance to date... but keep in
 mind that it won't be a real indicator of a groups quality, since a group
 that releases an amazing title and then goes dormant for 3 weeks is
 generally preferable to a group consistantly scoring 5/10 - but I'll get
 into that next week. For now, kick back, grab a beer (anything but
 Coors!), relax, and, if yer in my position....  ENJOY YER WEEK OFF FROM
 FUCKING CLASSES!!! YEAH!!! 

                                                                   - Bud

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 


Movie Reviews


Rushmore
Starring: Bill Murray & other people
Rating: 4 Stars

You know that your in for a good movie when you laugh out loud at the 
previews. 
"I like your nurse's uniform"
"These are O.R. scrubs"
"Oh, Are they?"

And it doesn't die there. This film about a kid who dedicates his life 
to going to one school and starting as many clubs as possible. But then he 
falls for a first grade teacher, and Bill Murray's character falls for the 
same girl. War ensues and much comedy. Bill Murray was snubbed for a 
supporting actor role in the Oscar's and that sucked. But the movie is 
definately worth seeing.


---------

Blast from The Past
Starring: Brendan Fraser, Alicia Silverstone, Christopher Walken
Rating: 3 Stars

Well, I was impressed by this movie. I didn't go in expecting too much. 
Alicia is back to being damn hot again. So that's an immediate plus. You get 
Walken as a nutty guy, which is his specialty. Brendan Fraser grows up in a 
bomb shelter till he's 35 and finally enters the world. His parents hid 
during the Missile Crisis thinking a bomb went off. He is sent out to gather 
supplies and on a side mission find a girl. The funniest parts are when 
Fraser first comes to the surface and runs into numerous people he has never 
seen before. Hopefully this will be VCD'ed soon and it'll be worth the 
download.

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

Telesync/TS: Telesync is a procam on a tripod in an empty theater with a 
separate audio source. If there's an audience, you hear people coughing, 
camera is shaky, etc. It's a CAM.    CAM = banned. If you want a movie 
extremely early, Telesync is the way it will be.

Workprint: Workprint is a pre-release copy of a movie, stolen copy, etc. 
that usually has the film running time on the screen.

Screener: Screener is usually the BEST quality, an actual vcd of the movie, 
made from a reviewers copy, etc. Screener's are generally released after 
movies have left the theaters.


Special Thanks to Ryche of EViLiSO for the education in VCD terms, and to 
come.to/vcddupe for keeping us up to date on the new titles.

Ryche's Really Biased VCD Group Report #3

Ho hum.. a rather blase` (whoa french?) week for VCD's this week. There 
were a few bright spots in a rather dismal week tho, including Payback and 
At First Sight Telesyncs. Most of the screeners this week are B-Movie, 
direct to video, straight to the trashcan releases, which alot of groups 
seem to specialize in these days.

Releases For The Week of 2/07/99 - 2/13/99

- VHS (Videoholics) -

TFAiSO.. err, VHS started off the week with this pathetic release. You can 
find very little information about it anywhere and theyre .nfo says NOTHING 
about the film except as to what was used to make the image. Big woop. Put 
some information in your nfo's or be nuked is what I say. NUKE-Bad.nfo ring 
a bell? After deep searching I finally found out WHY you cant find any 
information on it. It was called Valentine's Day, and its a made for TV 
Movie and its a nuke. Yes, an NWR SCOOP! :D

Total - 0 Points

- Centropy -

My whipping boys Centropy had a fairly decent week this week, releasing 
Simon Birch and One True Thing. Both releases are family movies. Tearjerker, 
heart-warming crap and the former made a few critics best of list for 1998. 
It's about a dwarf! Go figure. Other than the two decent screeners, they 
also released The Sheperd from 1997 and recieved a 1999 nuke for it.

Total - 3 Points

- HighSpeed -

I'll continue to review them as long as they continue to release, which 
hopefully won't be much longer. At First Sight is the blind man gets his 
eyes back movie with Val Kilmer playing at the theatres now. Strangeland! 
Cheap, horrible, shitty, pathetic attempt at a horror movie from guess who? 
Dee Snider! Yes, Mr. I Wanna Rock, Twisted Sister himself. Finishing out a 
stellar (insert giggles here) week was the nuke Since You Have Been Gone.
A TV Movie. I hope it got better ratings on television than it did on the net.

Total - 2 Points

- JIOO -

JIOO stopped by on thier way back from Blockbuster Video to drop off Bone 
Daddy, a horror movie about a psychopath. We returned their present with a 
Nuke Gift Certificate which was redeemed immediately.

Total - 0 Points

- EViLISO -

Slow week from the sickos. Idle all week, until Saturday when we woke up to 
find Payback Telesync on most of the sites. It's the #1 movie in the U.S. 
last week, and now you can watch it 7 days later at home. Pretty sweet even 
if it is a TS.

Total - 3 Points

- VCD-EuropA -

What an original name, VCD-Europa. The nfo is some lame attempt at comedy 
from some supposed russians who greet thier "commrades in VHS" which is 
basically a front group. Also, it might be a good idea to actually tell what 
the movie is about commies instead of just a url where you can find out about 
the movie. Either way, its a telesync of a movie about a man who becomes a 
snowman that came out around Christmas and disappeared from the theatres
before Santa Claus got there.

Total - 1 Pointski

- PMTVCD -

Whee.. another group actually releases something. PMTVCD popped up with the 
Ever After Screener, the medieval love story with Drew Barrymoore. No one 
as expecting this movie, and no one cared when it came out.

Total - 2 Points


What a week. Two releases from groups who cant make an .nfo, a couple of 
movies no one has heard of, and a couple of good telesyncs. Centropy and 
EViLISO tied this week with 3 points but I'll give the Group of the Week 
to Centropy (OMG) since both of thiers were screeeners and some people have 
actually heard of those movies unlike thier usual releases. The other groups 
continue to hang at the back of the pack, filling up your harddrives with 
random bits of crap. 

                                                      Bang your head..
                                                           Ryche

Ok, look you guys are fucking killing me here. Someone volunteer to help out 
on the reviews PLEASE!

Jack Frost - VCD Europa - 2/11/99 - 2 Discs - Telesync

Video Quality: Letterboxed, so the video is nice and clean. Very good for a TS.
Rating: 4

Audio Quality: Nothing special, nothing terrible. Few hisses in the beginning 
but it evens out
Rating 3 1/2

Movie Quality: Well I have to say this wasn't too bad. I wouldn't go spend 7 
bux on it. But the vcd is conveniantly in .mpg format so I didn't even waste 
cd's. It's worth a watch if you need a movie to see.
Rating: 2 1/2

-----------------

At First Sight - HighSpeed - 2/08/99 - 2 Discs - Telesync

Video Quality: Not great, not bad. easy to watch.
Rating: 3 1/2

Audio Quality: Few little quirks here and there, but overall smooth
Rating: 3 1/2

Movie Quality: Grab your g/f and watch it. It's not too bad, but Val Kilmer 
is not a romantic movie kinda guy.
Rating: 2 1/2

I couldn't get more done. I wanted to watch Payback since it's the biggest 
title. The movie si great. I'd say download it anyways!

=---------[ Hazzy, RDX, and ENT.. an Interview With Bones]----------=

  Well, there has been a bit of a big shakeup this week, with the folding
  of Ent, and the recent changes made to the top site, rdx.. Lester sat
  down with Bones, one of the prime players in it all, to see what his
  spin on it was......



This interview was conducted with Bones of Rise/DMS and formerly on the 
]Redux staff, just moments after he left the Redux staff.


<NWR> Tonight you quit the Redux staff, what were the reasons for 
leaving a site you worked pretty hard to make respectable?


<Bones> Well, my only reason for quitting Redux was the staff, one in 
particular, that being Hazzy. The rest of the staff I appreciate, but I think 
Redux was losing respect because of Hazzy. He is hated all over, and when he 
starts to insult his own staff, who works hard for the site he started, he 
goes over the line.

<NWR> What problem was there between you and Hazzy?

<Bones> There used to be no problem. Hazzy and me ran ENTiTY together for 
a year, I was the only one I think in the entire scene who liked him.
Then he developped the biggest ego I have ever seen, and started 
to show it all over. He was mad at me for closing down Entity, a group 
that he quit university for.


<NWR> But weren't you running Entity for some time on your own after 
he retired? How can he have much claim over what you do with it?


<Bones> I ran Entity for a few months after he retired. All the old 
members that had helped the group towards its former domination had 
already quit because of hazzy, and the current ones were not happy with 
him even idling in the channel. He had no claim whatsoever. He was sore 
because he dropped out of university for entity, and I "wasted a year 
of his life". He really did drop out btw.


<NWR> Well that's a pretty sad character then. So you have officially 
left Redux staff and want nothing further to do with them right?


<Bones> I want nothing to do with Redux as long as Hazzy is still on the 
staff. If he is removed, I would be more than glad to return. As far as 
I'm concerned its an absolute miracle the site has gone so far with a 
siteop like him. Maybe because he offers shells on the box to those 
that have the influence to make the site good? I dont know

That concludes the interview. Bones was kind enough to give us a few choice 
Hazzy quotes during their conversation.



<hazzy> im only 6'3 
<hazzy> 160lb
<hazzy> just imagine getting hit 1 time by holifield :)

<hazzy> means u wasted 1 yr of yer life
<hazzy> i dropped out of college for ent
<hazzy> laff

<hazzy> do u belive there r key ppl in the scene who control pretty much how 
        the warez scene works?
<Bones> i know there are
<hazzy> like who?
<hazzy> i give u a hint, there r not more then 10 of them
<hazzy> oh and i am 1 of em ;)

Can we say delusional?:)

-----------[Blast From the Past!]-----------



This is our new section. We are printing past articles and news in the 
scene of old. This week we focus on Articles published from INQ 4-6 and 
focus on the big MS bust of Pieman and the scandal around Mikeysoft, then 
a leader of the great group NTA. Few today probably remember who many of 
the names mentioned are. But it will give you an idea of a sad day in the 
scene. Inquisition was focused a great deal on these events and Raptor and 
Devast mainly deserve the credit for being very thorough here.

- Lester [Former INQ Co-Editor/Current NWR Co-Editor]





---=[ 7. Announcements - Microsoft and Novell Crack Down ]=--------------------

During the past week there has been much talk about the busts that Microsoft
and Novell have been involved in.  A well known member of the Scene, Mikeysoft,
has been involved along with a few others.  A few boards have gone down which
are suspect but have not been raided.  Basically, we are going to present you
with different sub-topics envolving this subject.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two days after Mikeysoft prompted the public that he was under investigation.
Much speculation has been in the air around certain areas of the busts.  We 
have interviewed a person who knows the situation quite well and who was in 
the same situation years ago.

INQ    : Let's start with MikeySoft.
W00per : OK
INQ    : When did you find out about Mikey's peril?
W00per : Down here there is a group of us that are old farts in the scene.  
         TFF (The Final Frontier) has been up and running for years.  
         So naturally when time passes by everyone gets to know everyone else.
W00per : But, last week one of my friends gave me a call and said that mike 
         got nailed.
INQ    : Last week?  How did your friend know prior to two days ago when it 
         was announced?
W00per : Apparently mike was holding some computers for a guy (we will call 
         him b0b), so when mike got poped he told b0b.  We knew the day it 
         happened.
INQ    : Because b0b's puters we taken away?
W00per : Yup, b0b's computers all taken away.  Well we proceeded to inform 
         certian people and natually people didn't believe us.  We believe it 
         has something to do with Microsoft.  Because there was an ad on our 
         front papers about Microsoft offering a large amount of money for 
         anyone distriubing Win95.  That if you have any information on who is 
         distributing Win95 you will get money for it :>
W00per : Now check this out - Microsoft wasn't going to lose any money on 
         beta's so, it was no big deal, but when NTA released the gold edition 
         - well Microsoft started losing money.  Microsoft is notrious; they 
         are on every major warez board.
INQ    : What about PWA and DoD - they released similar versions of Win95 
         finals.
W00per : I do not know what the current situation is with PWA and DoD as far 
         as Microsoft goes.  PWA and DoD may take better ways to cover up 
         their tracks.  We all know that mike doesn't.  Mike was very sloppy.
INQ    : So what is the explanation behind the bond issue?  100,000 dollar 
         bond?
W00per : Oh, Mike is a good bullshitter and he has so many people wrapped 
         under his finger and has an expensive lawyer.
INQ    : Mikey said that MS/Novell/large vender/etc. could post $100,00 bond 
         with the courts and take your computers, no questions asked.
W00per : Well lets put it this way.  Gail Thackeray is probalby part of this 
         bust.  She has been after his ass for years, and plus so many other 
         busts his name keeps pop'n up.  Now this is how Gail works, she will 
         give you a deal.  I mean shit, anything but prison, and if you 
         cooperate with her, she will work with you and pull strings.  She is a 
         very powerful woman and we should all except to see more of her.  

NOTE   : (Another source confirmed that she WAS part of the bust)

INQ    : Who exactly is she - An U.S. attorney, private attorney who works for 
         the software industry?
W00per : She did many things at different times.  Once she was one of the top 
         people in computer fraud and rackteering.
INQ    : In the US gov't?
W00per : For the state and local county, but she is also a consultant also.
         For she is supposely the best there is, and she can pull strings, 
         good buds with every major software manufacturer and government 
         agencies.
INQ    : So what is the plan of action against Mikey and Pieman?
W00per : With mike, since he is coroperating with Gail - he probably get 
         probabtion and won't get his hardware back.
INQ    : Will she ask him for all of the names of fellow people in his hobby?
W00per : But this is the problem.  Even if he didn't coroperate he was still 
         MESSY.  He left tracks.  For example, I was inside ***** site (Name
         Protected) many numerous times.  I was watching the RiSC people for 
         the hell of it :>  So, I was roaming around the system and found out 
         that Mikey did not encrypt anything.  It was open where the ***** 
         site was.  He had numbers to every major warez person in the scene -
         address's and phone numbers.  Plus he had every RiSC member phone 
         number and address right there in the open.  Also what files they 
         took and what they uploaded.  Then when mikey went down and ***** 
         went down.  So, ***** has been compromised because I can assure that 
         Gail is also good friends with every internet provider down here in 
         Phoenix, so I'm sure they coroperated and monitored Mikey and his 
         connections to places.  So what information they got from TDN is now 
         in the hands of the authorities, including anon.penet address's.
INQ    : So whether or not Mikey gives names' - they prolly have them already?
W00per : Yes, they DO have them.
INQ    : So what will become of those people?
W00per : Who knows, depends on how imporatnt you are to them.  You see by 
         targeting Mikey, it can lead off into multiple busts, making their 
         job worthwhile.  It's starts a chain reaction.  But it looks like 
         that NTA is being affected first.
INQ    : You know Gail better than most of us - will she ever stop?
W00per : No, this woman is on a witch hunt; this is what she does and does 
         best.
INQ    : What about other members of NTA and RiSC?
W00per : Don't forget it's not just NTA, Mike has been a thorn in Gail's side 
         for years.  I sugguest this to everyone in the scene that associated 
         with mikey at all to take it easy.
INQ    : How do you think he escaped so long?
W00per : They had no proof and seriously, Gail said herself, No Proof.  I like 
         to know what kind of proof they have now.  Or if they used his "drug 
         habit" as an excuse
INQ    : Not even releases?  He put his name on releases, isn't that proof 
         enough or is that hearsay?
W00per : It's hearsay.  It's easy to forge electronic documents and data.
W00per : Scenarios are a) they got something on him
                       b) someone ELSE turned him in
         Gail knew that Mike pirated; she knew that TFF was one of the largest 
         boards in Arizona.  TFF was fucking large, it came out of the 80s 
         into the 90s, and every major bust that happened TFF just kept 
         running with no end in sight.  So for gail to take down TFF is a 
         prize trophy.
W00per : For the time that Mike has been on the net, WHO knows what 
         information he has gotten or some warez niggers he got to talk to 
         him about sites or PWA sites or DOD sites or anything.  Also, the 
         bot's access -  has anyone every thought of that?  If he is on any of 
         the major bots.  
INQ    : It has been verified that Mikey is not or has been removed from 
         sites.         
W00per : From the logs on ***** site, he used other people's accounts 
         CONSTANTLY.  He used other people's accounts to grab stuff and used 
         his accounts either for nothing or upload.  I been saying to 
         everyone to change everything.
W00per : Mikey is also a pathalogical liar.  He fooled the entire scene.  
         Mike is a bullshit artist, he tells ppl he is dying from cancer or he 
         got in a car accident (which I think he did) or he writes for 
         magazines.  He did this and this or he is some kind of big corporate 
         dude with tons of money.  He would tell people that if they did this 
         for him he would do this but never come through.  Shit, he could tell 
         some warez nigger right now he was god and that dude probably believe 
         it, including some who should know better.
W00per : Now when he got busted, I can understand not telling anyone or 
         shutting up but, he lied about the coma and then denied the bust.
         Then pieman gets poped which makes people very suspicous and those 
         who know him say "i told you so."  BTW, on that he didn't cover up 
         his tracks, he kept every log on his board from day 1.  Also on 
         ***** site, he has contacts in Europe, and their phone numbers, 
         so this may not just end in the states.
INQ    : Lets go back to Gail.
W00per : OK
INQ    : What exactly did she do to you?
W00per : If you do not mind I will not list any details or my anonymous will 
         be ruined :>
INQ    : That's fine.
W00per : But, I have been prosecuted by her.
INQ    : So, 602 is or was a hotbed for Gail to gain a reputation?
W00per : Arizona at one time was the place back in the late 80's
INQ    : Until Operation SunDevil.
W00per : Gail gained her first major appecance in Arizona.  Where people began 
         to hear of her.  OSD was a major raid across the United States on 
         hackers.  But, from what I still hear today no one has been 
         procescuted.  But, this is also the thing with gail - they will 
         monitor you for a couple of years if it takes.
INQ    : For you to slip once right?
W00per : Or collect enough evidence to put your away for a long time.  For 
         example, Gail has busted MANY people but, no one has heared about it.
         She even threatens these people if they talk they will make sure they 
         never see the light of day again.  So there are busts that no one 
         ever hears about.  You see Mike was a possible one of those.  No one 
         knew about it until someone spoke up.
INQ    : Anyhow - So what do we do next?  Piraters?
W00per : Not hanging in those channels (#warez) minimizes the risk but not 
         totally.  Don't be so goddamn public.  Mind if i be frank here?
INQ    : Sure.
W00per : This gives me a oppurtunity to say what I been wanting to say.  The 
         PC warez scene has so many ignorant fewls - 10-16 year punks who 
         think they are some kind of god because they pirate warez.  They go 
         to school and brag - they think they are gods!  Because they nickname 
         pops up in NFO files or they download software they don't use or they 
         play games all day, but the problem is they are so oepn about it.  
         They make friends with everyone and they think they are kewl to 
         phreak - use c0dez and shit.  I'm surpised that old timers allowed 
         this to happen.  The solution is for these groups are to rid youself 
         of these lamers.
INQ    : Let's talk about this USCA that was mention the other night.
W00per : Refresh my memory, USCA?
INQ    : It's legal to check out software for a 24 hour period - then you must 
         destroy it - Anything on this?
W00per : Well from what I understand, you can get away with up to like $3000 
         in software before they can really *nail* you.  So that means boards 
         like TFF were pushing mucho money.

This pretty much ends the interview.  The interviewee's information will not 
be revealed regardless.  This is the actual interview.  The information in
here may be taken seriously or jokingly.  You are the reader thus it is your
choice.  We have not made any of this up nor do we intend to start rumors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                The Pits Bust

On Tuesday night, October 24, 1995, The Pieman's home was raided by U.S. 
Marshals and Representitives of Novel Corporation.  They took all his 
equipment.  Novel said his board had a copy of Perfect Office available for 
download.  As of now it looks like a civil matter.  The Pieman business - High 
Speed Tech - needs some business desperately.  You and your friends can help 
The Pieman by buying some hardware from his store.  He has very competive 
prices.  I have been a satisfied customer for years.  So, if you know anyone 
looking for modems, hard drives, CD-ROM drives, complete systems, et cetera, 
send them his way.

                   High Speed Tech
                   718-833-4949
                   Located in The Bayridge Section of Brooklyn New York

The individual who caused the bust was DragonMaster.

We would like to Rowdy Roddy Piper for suppling this bit of information to the
scene.

We would also like to thank The Pieman for notifing the scene immediately even
though he was risking further prosecution.

---=[ 7. Announcements - Oyl Patch Speaks Out ]=-------------------------------

Oyl    : I told Mikey tonight, very forcefully, that he can NOT lie any longer,
         and if he tries it, I will pull out my phone logs.  I said because 
         you are still trying to figure out how to lie your way out of it.  
         The time line is like this:
Oyl    : OK.  First, do you remember the day we were told that Mikey was in a 
         coma?
Devast : Yes..
Oyl    : OK.  That was on a thursday, after he was busted on a tuesday!
Oyl    : If you remember he said he had been robbed, right?
Devast : Yes but that was before.
Oyl    : Well, he was NOT robbed.  He was busted on the Tuesday morning.  The
         Tuesday he said he was robbed!  Now, the time from there was like 
         this.
Oyl    : I generally talk to MikeySoft voice at least every other day.. and 
         have done so for many years.  I started trying to call him on the 
         Tuesday evening he was busted.  All his data lines and his voice line 
         were busy.  I knew the voice line was never busy because he has call 
         waiting.  I tried until 2 am and it was still busy.  I tried Wednesday 
         morning, still busy.  Wednesday afternoon his voice line was clear, 
         but his data lines were still all busy.
Oyl    : I left a voice message on Wednesday, 2 or 3 in fact.
Oyl    : Thursday, his lawyer came on.  Yes, it was his lawyer.  Who has since 
         said it was him.  He said Mikey is in a coma.  Mikey was NOT in a 
         coma, was NOT in the hospital, but had indeed taken a bit too much 
         seconal.
Devast : OK.  Why would his lawyer lie?
Oyl    : He was only delivering the message mikey had told him to leave, 
         because Mikey KNEW I would wonder what was going on and he did not 
         want to tell us he was busted.
Oyl    : BTW, this was the lawyer that comes on here under handle of Chester.
         Not his regular Clint Smith, but a member of the same firm.
Oyl    : On the Thursday that we got the message on the IRC, I started calling
         hospitals.  I called every hospital in Phoenix, Mesa, Chandler, et 
         cetera.  Mikey was NOT in the hospital.  I called everyone that I 
         knew in Phoenix that also knew mikey, and no one had heard anything
         or seen him.
Oyl    : On Friday morning, I called his lawyer, Clint Smith.  I said, "We got 
         word that Mikey is in a coma.  I have called every hospital and Mikey 
         is NOT in any of them.  What is up?"
Oyl    : His answer was, "No, Mikey is NOT in the hospital.  Mikey is at home,
         but Mikey is having some other problems now."
Oyl    : At that, I KNEW he had been busted.
Oyl    : His lawyer said, "Call Mikey tonight, I am sure he will take your 
         call."   I said OK.  In the meantime, I talked to someone else in 
         Phoenix who HAD seen Mikey and been to his house.
Devast : w00per?
Oyl    : They were the one who said Mikey has been busted.  I was there, and 
         there was not a computer in the house, no floppies, nothing.  He 
         said, "Nola, NO ONE would take every floppy, every cable, every tape,
         every thing, and leave all MIkey's expensive televisions and stereo
         equipment.
Oyl    : BTW, It was NOT w00per who told me, it was someone different.
Oyl    : At that point, Mikey knew his goose was cooked and started on the 
         story of the robbery.
Oyl    : On Friday evening, I did call Mikey, and he told me the same story of 
         the coma, robbery, et cetera.
Devast : Why would Mikey not want us to know that he was busted?
Oyl    : Ask Mikey, but there is LOTS MORE.   Believe me, and I will not even 
         tell you all of it, but I will NOT go along with the lie any longer.
Oyl    : Anyway, Mikey got his monitor back on Friday.  The reason he got his 
         monitor back was NOT because the police FOUND it, it is because of 
         the law having to do with confiscation.  They can NOT legally keep 
         any equiptment that does not have data that can be used as evidence.
         Anyway, when I learned he had gotten the monitor back, I KNEW beyond
         ANY doubt that he had been busted.  I asked him point blank on 
         Saturday.  Mikey tell me the truth, were you busted.  He said, 
         "Preposterous."
Oyl    : I said, "Mikey, bullshit, you were NOT in the hospital because I
         called all of them and you were NOT there.
Oyl    : He said, "Oh, it was because they were told not to give out info."
Oyl    : Anyway, I then KNEW I had to warn a couple of seniors that Mikey had
         been busted so that he would not be accessing their sites.
Oyl    : I told exactly 3 people that I KNEW Mikey had been busted but had NO
         proof.
Oyl    : We had changed the IP of our site in the meantime, and when mikey
         asked me for it on Friday evening, I told him I did not have it.  He 
         got it from someone else, and the log shows he came on at about
         midnight and was on for 2 hours.  One of the Seniors that I had 
         reported it to ALSO asked mikey if he had been busted.  Asked him on 
         saturday and Mikey said preposterous!  Anyway, Mikey had managed to 
         get the IP from someone else who had no idea he had been busted.
Devast : Isn't it possible that it was not Mikey?  IP spoofer/slirp?
Oyl    : Nope, as a matter of fact, Mikey admitted it.  Even admitted who gave 
         it to him.  I said Mikey that was INSANE.  He said, "Why, Novell was 
         not going to check it."
Oyl    : I said, "Mikey, bull, you know that you told me that indirect had
         sniffers on you."
Oyl    : Anyway, as of Saturday or Sunday, Mikey's account was deleted from 
         the site.
Oyl    : On the following Tuesday, he called me at my office.  He said, "Nola,
         Clint just called me, he overheard the Novell guy and Gail Thackery
         down at the local police station talking, and the novell guy said he 
         is going to be busting BBS in NY.
Oyl    : He said, we MUST get hold of Pierre.  I was at work and never knew
         Pierre's last name.  So, naturally, I could NOT call him.
Oyl    : Mikey said he did not have his number because all his stuff had 
         already been taken.  That was on Tuesday.
Devast : Toyman was warned.
Oyl    : Toyman was warned by me.  He is one of the people that I told.  After
         all, I go way back with toyman.
Oyl    : Anyway, I had already told toyman that Mikey was busted.
Oyl    : Toyman called him, and Mikey said NO WAY!
Devast : ???????
Oyl    : Toyman also asked Mikey point blank if he had been busted, Mikey said
         NO.  Anyway, it is true that Mikey came on the IRC on Tuesday.  He
         did get word to BBS's in NY that Novell is heading that way.
Devast : But in a way, Mikey saved toyman.
Oyl    : Hell, no he did not.  He denied to Toyman that he had been busted.
         He told toyman that they were going to NY.
Devast : But he warned Toyman that he could be busted.
Oyl    : Mikey did NOT tell Toyman that they were also coming his way until
         Thursday when Pie was busted.  Anyway, put that in your pipe; believe 
         as you like, it is nothing to me.
Oyl    : Mikey has been a very close friend for 4-5 years.  He lied to me and 
         continued to lie.  He is still trying to figure out HOW to make it 
         plausible that he did NOT lie.  He says, "Well..  I guess I just do 
         not keep up with time very well.
Oyl    : I have NO reason to trash Mikey.  I do have a reason to protect 
         people who are also my friends.  I tried to warn the seniors, almost 
         a week before Mikey admitted he was busted.
Oyl    : All the time, Mikey was tr.  Mikey was still accessing the site.
Oyl    : I remember on what I think was Sunday, after Mikey had been busted on
         Tuesday.  Someone came into NTA-nokturnal, said Mikey had been busted.
Oyl    : All the tennie-bopper wanna-be's starting kicking and yelling - How 
         DARE you talk about Mikey God like that.  Hell, I did not even say 
         anything then.  Was STILL only trying to warn the ones who REALLY had 
         to know.
Devast : OK.
Oyl    : Now, if ANYONE can disprove ONE WORD of ANY OF THIS.  I will 
         absolutely KISS THIER SHITTY ASS.  And, believe me, I never kissed 
         an ass and do NOT intend to start!
devast : Well, I can disprove him logging onto the site.  After this, I dunno 
         if i should though.
Oyl    : Hell, Devast, I was on the damned phone with him.  He said he did, 
         you want to believe him, well he admitted it.
Devast : Like I said, I don't think i should now.
Oyl    : Now got and give YOUR damned proof.  What ever proof you can muster 
         from Mikey and want to believe, I really do NOT give a damn.  The 
         truth IS the truth, and that is all I care about.  Mikey just said, 
         "Well, the only thing that matters is NOT when I was busted, but that 
         I warned Pie."  I said, "Hell Mikey, that is SHIT.  You lied and Lied 
         and Lied.  NO ONE will ever believe you again!
Oyl    : Now what do you have to say for Mikey God.
Devast : Nothing, we all lie, but this was a bit too much.
Oyl    : What was a bit much?  Me trying to protect a few major people.  Hell!
Oyl    : Devast, People have tried to tell you.  Not me.  I have NOT been 
         talking about Mikey, but others DID try to tell you.  You do NOT want 
         to believe it.  Sorry, does not matter.  Hide your head in the sand if 
         you like.  That is YOUR problem.
Devast : I wanna know the truth.
Oyl    : Devast, I am not even telling NOW all I really know.  Because I 
         PROMISED Mikey I would not, and I will not.
Oyl    : I don't think you believe me now.  You want to believe Mikey, then go 
         and believe Mikey.  Won't make it so, but you may do as you like.  I 
         have never talked to you, and I certainly had NO reason to lie about 
         a close friend of 4 years.  A friend that I talked to every day.  A 
         friend that I know better than ANY of you will EVER know him.  But, 
         when that friend puts all my OTHER friends in peril by his lies and
         actions, I had to tell the truth.
Devast : Do you think Mikeysoft was/is helping novel/microsoft?
Oyl    : Devast, I will NOT tell more than was absolutely neccessary to 
         protect my friends.  There is NOTHING more that I have to tell about 
         the incident.
Devast : Whether he is helping novel/microsoft is important.  If he is, 
         EVERYONE should know.
Oyl    : I can only say, if he lied about so much, why would you care?
Devast : I wanna know just how far he has gone.  I wanna know the truth.
Oyl    : Leave it up to you to decide; if he has consitently lied, why do you 
         care about the rest.  Tonight when mikey called me, he said, "I want 
         you to support the story of how I called you on Tuesday, et cetera.
Oyl    : I said sure, but don't asked me to lie about the rest.
Oyl    : Naturally, with that, he did NOT make the 3 way call.

So ends the conversation on Novemeber 4th, 1995.  Devast, among many people, 
was looking for the "truth" and Oyl Patch basically told him what really 
occurred.  Hopefully this awakens all those who are still have their heads in 
the ground.  

This ends the "Mikey" saga in INQ.  We will no longer cover any news regarding
this issue unless Mike speaks to us.  After all, only so much can be said of 
this situation.  Conclusions have been made and some are still in the making,
but this is not OJ, so get on with you lives.

---=[ 7. Announcements - Final Epidsode ]=------------------------------------

Devast    : Oyl is here, what do you want me to ask her?
MikeySoft : Umm...  Stuff.
Devast    : Like?
MikeySoft : Oh...  Whatever tunes you fork.
MikeySoft : Fill in the blanks
Oyl Patch : Evening.
MikeySoft : Ah
Devast    : Fill in the blanks.  :)
Oyl Patch : Mikey, you mean MOI?
Oyl Patch : Well, basically, not much to fill in.  Mikey got busted as we all 
            know.  For personal sufficient reasons, Mikey did not think it was 
            essential that he broadcast it. 
Devast    : Uh-uh. 
MikeySoft : And it had nothing to do with Scene stuff.
Oyl Patch : Anyway, Mikey and I had had a LONG discussion about the events.
            Mikey knows that I was concerned about certain security issues, 
            and thought it was absolutely essential that a few people knew of 
            the bust.  Naturally, Mikey did not really want to let it all hang 
            out, and based on his attorney's advice, he tried to keep it 
            quieter.  Whole truth and nothing but the truth is that the bust 
            was a bit earlier than Mikey had said.
MikeySoft : Yup
Oyl Patch : No real biggy and many have said, they would not want it broadcast 
            either.  And he was also following his attorney's advice.
MikeySoft : Yup!
Devast    : OK.
MikeySoft : That's true too!
Oyl Patch : Mikey and I have been friends for MANY MANY years, and because we 
            have been so close, there was no way he could hide it from me.
MikeySoft : This is also true.
Oyl Patch : So turns out, it was me, who has been as close to him as any, was
            the one who actually blew the HORN, not a wee whistle but a DAMNED 
            BULL HORN!  Not a first, but again because of my concerns for 
            security.  I did let a couple of seniors know the facts.
MikeySoft : This is also true.
Oyl Patch : Finally, I just told Mikey, cut the bull shit, lets get rid of the 
            issue, admit it was a bit earlier than alledged and forget it.
MikeySoft : I'm asking everyone to please understand that the few days that we 
            are talking about, I never ever compromised anyone.

Basically this is the final epidsode.  We meant to put this out much earlier 
since it is old news.  Anyhow - good luck to Mikey and his pursuits in the
future.

-----------[The Scene News]-----------

All the news thats fit to print... 
and then some...


-Wacky week, lots of shit going on, lets get right to it:

-Looks like acidapple of dev/blizz, and siteop of tms, is back in
 action, or should be, after he "sleeps for 2 weeks straight"..
 The doctors decided that they needed to send him home to fatten
 him up before they removed his intestines, so that means lots of
 home cooking for mr acid apple... good to hear!

-Origin: they are on fire. This is a slow time of year, but they are
 OWNING a big majority of the releases.. no doubt this success is do
 to the fact that they have been whoring around moonsabre to their
 suppliers. Apparently OGN will exchange 10 minutes of sex0r with
 moonsabre for every supplied game. Sounds like a bargain... ;p 

-#releases is looking good... lot of old faces in there.. I'll be
 hanging out in there on and off from now on, so hang out with me.. <g>

-BAHAHAHAHAHAHAH... MDK WAS STOLEN... BAHAHAHAH... seriously tho, i
 hope the stupid mofo that took it doesn't realize wtf he took.. i hope
 the dude gets castrated when they find him.. ;p

-Ok.. So i was wrong (for ONCE).. Easy is not in PWA. I don't know
 wtf group he is in, but the bottom line is that neither Easy nor PNC 
 stole that fax release from that florist group. (FTD?)

-People: Stop nuking netware, unless you REALLY THINK THAT ITS CRAP. Not
 a lot of the pups out there know this, but there was a reason we started
 nuking netware. It comes out of tradition, because we HAD to nuke it. 
 Back in the days of boards, it was a lot easier to track down sites, etc
 (just a phone call away). There were no bounces, etc. The problem was,
 when you DID get busted, very few software companies would prosecute, for
 fear of bad publicity..
 One company DID prosecute, EVERY FUCKING TIME.. and that company is NOVELL.
 If you were busted with netware shit on your HD, then you were FUCKED.
 These days, shit has changed a lot, so for all you ppl out there who
 don't know wtf we nuke netware, now you do. Talk to the pro's like gal
 winterhwk, or jess... ppl that know wtf they are doing, if you want to
 know more...

-Nd told me that KARL doesn't want me to say anything bad about him
 any more. So i won't say anything bad about him. 
 Karl is not a whiny bitch. Karl is not useless. Karl is an elite hacker, 
 who managed to not only own riches, but all of TAW. Karl singlehandly took 
 back #risciso, and has successfully held off TAW since then.. *cough**cough* 
 happy now, ndt?  ;)

-group moves: baseclw to TPC, ndetroit to OGN, exhume to DMS from MnM,
 grind leaves rise, moonsabre leaves pcy, acidapple to TPC(wtf?), 
 dthangel to siege from LND, grind to 2kad, 
 
-I'm liking bacid's new layout. Check out his msgboard... Its leet..
 http://cpu1058.adsl.bellglobal.com/tca/1024x768.html  if you want the
 URL, and apparently, he is gonna have an NWR section there... If that
 is the case, then you bitches should all go there, and... .... click some
 muthafuckin' pr0n banners... ;)

-So there was the ridiculous episode with Eternal, and aldog.. Aldog changed
 his group on STH to DEV at the last moment so AoD wouldn't win... Fucking
 embarassing.. 

-OGN picked up another good site, TMS, with the fatass archive. 8 sites for
 the limeys now.

-TT dropped MnM, for an almost complete lack of support. The site is now
 O2 WHQ.... this will work out very well for TT, provided they can convince
 oxygen to do a little less painting, and a little more trading.. ;p

-Uhhh....

--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors, we all love them even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us. And these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, your name will not be included, but we
do not add rumors like that say "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion"
because we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore
there is no hard evidence of that rumor, so if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!


-Rumor has it that the ultraHLE coders will CONTINUE to code, even in the
 face of nintendo's slanderous and UNGROUNDED lawsuit. Software emulation
 is NOT illegal, indeed it is a profitable industry if one examines the
 mac/pc platforms. Not only that, but did you know that nintendo and sony
 actually LOSE money on every console system they sell?? Its the GAMES that
 make the big cash.. the hardware is always a cash-drain.

-Rumor has it that prozac will be back to kick some ass soon enough, and
 break class out of its current funk.

-Rumor has it that grad(e) is looking to sell his 51% stake in LND for about
 $5000.... I dunno wtf that means.

-Rumor has it that 2 top 10 utils groups are gonna have a MERGER.. look for
 that to happen around wednesday, or so...
