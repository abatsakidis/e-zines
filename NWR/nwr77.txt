Well we are a day late, well day and half since it's like 2am PST on thursday,
we also lack alot of content, but I figured something was better than nothing,
Dennison is back and so is Bud, but no Preacher kane this week.
There will still be a new NWR story soon, it's taking longer than I had expected <G>

Also, Jess is our special person of the week. :P
She gave me the N'Chink asf of byebyebye
heheheheh



I'm adding a new feature next week as well, we'll see if 
it takes off or not.


Remember, www.netmonkey.org is still up and the issue
is now posted in incoming every week.

  Bud's Biased Utils Report #49
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Yawn. A day late. My fault.

 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 03/07/00 to 03/13/00. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.


 Groups: (In no particular order)
 
 ‹ ﬂﬂ€€‹ ‹        ‹      ‹

 Sniff Plus, not sure if it's the Cross Platform enabled version
 (aka Sniff Plus Cross) and I'm too lazy to check it out, either way
 it's a decent app.

 Lariat.Station.Manager.v1.11.for.WMT-SHOCK
 PC-Install.with.Internet.Extensions.v7.01-SHOCK

 Not much out of Shock this week. The Lariat titles are over-priced
 (but not like you're paying anyways!), PC Install pales to the
 competition, and Icons Control, while useful, isn't going to be
 on any "best apps" list. Someone nuked EnterNet as minor, without
 thinking - MFD released a cracked trial of version 1.30.0008 or so,
 THAT was minor, worse still, the retail copy of v1.31 was available
 when MFD cracked the trial, they just failed to look into the matter.

 PFT got busy this past week and did several mid-range tools, the
 best of which is probably Websense Reporter or Business Objects.
 QARun is decent but we see it a little too often, when a major
 update comes along I'll appreciate it more.

 PNC got some decent titles out this past week, though really they could
 be doing a little more. Starbase's StarTeam product line is probably the
 best bet here, and as Starbase expands its offerings we can hopefully
 expect some more.

 Greco_Systems_MTMS_Suite_v7.10_Licensed-RBS
 BNA_Income_Tax_Planner_v2000.1.US.ONLY-RBS

 Four apps from team Rebels, I'll just comment on the obvious one, which was
 nuked on a lot of sites (mainly those not in the US). Income Tax Planner 2000
 brings to question the validity of regional based nukes. Now, we see foreign
 apps nuked on most sites, as they accept only Enlish titles. But regional apps
 in English... there has to be a line drawn (the phonebook for Jerkov, Nebraska
 isn't going to be needed in the scene), but the US is a damn big region. And if
 the whole idea of the scene is to make software available to the end-users, free
 of charge, than nuking this looks a little fishy. After all, since many financial
 apps deal in US currency, should we start nuking those as well? Now, not many
 US sites killed this, mainly Euro ones - but the scene is an international entity,
 and those Euro sites are bound to have a lot of US users.

 Anyways I'm rambling now... but I have enough respect for RBS to go with them
 on this one. If they go for the Jerkov phonebook, well that's another story.

 A strong week for SCUM in what was a pretty slow seven days, and
 much improved from their previous outing. They pick up a good Lotus
 app in the latest Millenium Edition of SmartSuite, and pick up the
 latest from CAMSoft, Chem Draw and Chem Office. Add in Oracle Web DB
 and some other tools and you get a strong week overall.

 here, interesting to note that FCN got Smirk v1.5 out at the same time KNO
 did a 1.0 release, not sure if someone did a bad back or if KNO was just
 really sloppy (don't have 3DSMAX installed to test).

 Harvest came on strong this week, and apparently read my report last
 week and decided to break out some good standalone apps. Fine, well maybe
 the world doesn't revolve around me, but they still did it! Obviously
 SoftImage is the standout here, but AMP Genesis is worth note as well,
 and even the smaller tools this week seem to be up on the quality side.
 Plus, from the looks of how next week is shaping up, Harvest is looking
 at a strong March all around.

 LND went back to la-la land. A lot of good titles came out after my week
 ended (DOD, Harvest, some others got busy after the deadline) so you can
 read about them next issue. Scum, Rise, and Harvest had the best offerings this
 week and tied. I'm all out of things to say (and brainpower, now THERE'S a shock!)
 so that's it, I'm outta here.

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 

Mission To Mars
Starring: Don Cheadle, Jerry o'Connell, Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins
Rating: 3 out of 4 Stars

I have personally been waiting for this film for some time now, I am
a huge fan of Don Cheadle and Gary Sinise, and even Mr. Robbins, so I 
was pretty excited goin in to this movie. It's a good movie, Armageddonish
emotions, and though the ending was, well not the greatest in the world,
the movie is pretty solid throughout and definately worth a look. Sinise
was not at his best though, every smile on his face was too fake to be believed,
he's better off as a bad guy.


---

The Ninth Gate
Starring: Johnny Depp
Directed by: Roman Polanski
Rating: 3 out of 4 Stars

Well I also was pretty excited about this movie, since it focuses on satan, and 
it stars Depp who I enjoy a great deal and it's of course directed by the legendary
Mr. Polanski, so it seemed like a winning formula to me. It also isn't really so focused
on satan and misc. demons and shit coming out like end of days and stigmata, it focuses more
on the task that Depp is assigned, which is to find out of the book of the nine gates is
for real or fake. Mysterious characters follow him and a string of bad luck attaches to
him after taking possession of the book. The ending was not too popular with alot of people
in the theater with me, but I felt it was a viable ending, and if they did it differently,
it probably would have been worse, but the movie is very good.

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is  usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear  people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination  of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.

Rogue Spear: Urban Operations Expansion Pack
--------------------------------------------

Publisher...: Red Storm Entertainment http://www.redstorm.com/
Developer...: Red Storm Entertainment http://www.redstorm.com/
Homepage....: http://www.redstorm.com/urban_ops/
Genre.......: FPS
Accelerated.: YES
Price.......: $24.99 (Pre-Order, coming on 4/15/00)
Demo........: Unavailable
Requirements: Win9x, Pentium 233MHZ PC Compatible, 32MB RAM, 200MB HD space,
              2MB video card, DirectX compatible sound card, 4x CD-ROM
ESRB Rating.: Teen 

Graphics....:  9/10 - Rogue Spear has one of the most innovative and inventive
                      graphics and animations ever to be seen in a first-person
                      shooter, although playing the game at high resolutions on
                      a low-end PC would cause some slowdowns. Playing the game
                      on a Celeron 300a is ok, but gets a bit choppy during
                      multiplayer, probably because of the engine's bloated or
                      buggy multiplayer code. Urban Ops adds a load of new
                      goodies such as civilians and terrorists who throw
                      throw grenades, so now you have to be twice more careful
                      and alert or you may end up finding the civilians-or
                      yourself--dead.
Sound.......:  8/10 - Wow, I just love the sound of bullets tearing through
                      metall, wood, glass, or flesh! Aside from that you don't
                      get much in-game speech, although the voice-overs at the
                      beginning of every mission is really cool. Music is
                      mediocre, and I find it better to play the game with music
                      tuned down or off, since Rogue Spear is more of a tactical
                      thinking game than a shoot-everything game like Quake.
Control.....:  7/10 - There is quite a lot of controls to memorize, and it takes
                      a while to get used to it but once you get the hang of it,
                      only then can you be able to survive through the harder
                      missions of game.
Gameplay....:  5/10 - The game is a bit difficult and complicated even at the
                      easiest level, so I never really enjoyed the singleplayer
                      aspect of the game. Basically depending on the msision you
                      are assigned different tasks ranging from rescue
                      opertaions to eliminating all hostiles within a territory
                      and it really takes strategy and quick thinking to survive
                      through each mission because one shot at you and you're
                      dead, no bandages or whatever--the game is that realistic.
Story.......: 10/10 - The story varies from every mission, basically you are to
                      control one of the elite members of Rainbow, an elite
                      secret force that is called out only on really important
                      and top-priority missions--in short, if no one else can
                      do it, you can. Your enemy are always terrorists, like in
                      real life, the biggest threat to any country or entity is
                      organized crime, or, in this case, terrorism. Anyway each
                      mission is really detailed and realistic that I decided to
                      give it a perfect 10.
Movies......:  5/10 - Not much to watch except for the intro. Instead of movies
                      you get still pictures in the mission briefings, which
                      kinda sucks since they just flash different pictures in
                      an order you will never understand.
Replay......:  5/10 - Ok if we're talking about singleplayer, I'd give the game
                      a replay value of around 7-8 since 90% of the people I
                      know got tired of the game after 5 or so missions, I knew
                      only about 2 persons who ever finished the game without
                      getting stuck. This game requires a lot of patience
                      especially with the latter, more difficult missions.
Gender Bias.:  7/10 - Obviously Rogue Spear is another testosterone-driven game
                      that would attract only a minority of females, most
                      probably those who are really into such games and although
                      I do know quite a couple of girls who play the game, still
                      majority of them just watching their male friends play.
Fun Factor..:  7/10 - I guess this game poses quite a challenge, and is a bit
                      more inclined to the more serious gamers out there. Hell,
                      this is no arcade game, so prepare to feel your heart
                      pumping, or to jump from your seats in shock.
Multiplayer.: 10/10 - This game definitely revolutionized the teamplay concept
                      of multiplayer gaming which was started by games such as
                      Team Fortress and Action Quake, but this time the game is
                      serious, more realistic, and more of a thinking game as
                      you try to outwit your human opponents and shoot at them
                      before they even know where you are. This is what makes
                      the game unique and popular among the multiplayer gaming
                      community, and for that they deserve a perfect 10.
Overall.....:  6/10

If you may notice my review was more about Rogue Spear than Urban Operations
itself, the reason for this is because Urban Ops adds nothing more than just a
bunch of new maps and new missions, I didn't have time to compare the weapons
and utilities but it seems that with Urban Ops there are not much new weapons or
tools, I only noticed the M249 saw as a new weapon. Anyway if you're more into
playing Rogue Spear multiplayer, don't get this as it is more focused on single
player and there are a lot of free mods out there that offer more than this
expansion pack does. The only reason I can find for anyone to buy this addon is
if he's really into collecting the Rainbow Six games or if he's really craving
for new singleplayer missions.
-
The Bottomline:
Don't get it if you don't play Rogue Spear in singleplayer or if you're just
looking for new multiplayer goodies because you'll just be disappointed.

Invictus: In the Shadow of Olympus
----------------------------------

Publisher...: Interplay http://www.interplay.com/
Developer...: Quicksilver http://www.quicksilver.com/
Homepage....: http://www.interplay.com/invictus/
Genre.......: RTS   
Accelerated.: NO
Price.......: $44.99
Demo........: 105Mb ftp://ftp.interplay.com/pub/demos/invictus.zip
Requirements: Win9x, Pentium 266MHZ PC Compatible, 64MB RAM, 300MB HD space,
              2MB video card, DirectX compatible sound card, 4x CD-ROM
ESRB Rating.: Teen

Graphics....:  5/10 - Talk about terrible graphics, this game must be left
                      behind in the shadows. The graphics engine sucks, and the
                      artwork is really bad. There is no 3D acceleration, which
                      could've made the game better.
Sound.......:  5/10 - Sounds effects and music are mediocre and could've been a
                      lot better. The characters' speech suck, it seems like
                      voices were recorded over a telephone line, and they are
                      uninspired and repetitive.
Control.....:  5/10 - Controls are mediocre, and could be a whole lot better
                      with the addition of shortcuts and more control options.
Gameplay....:  4/10 - There is a noticeable lack of AI control in the game,
                      both in your enemies and in your own troops. like, if you
                      tell your troops to attack they usually just go to their
                      enemies and just stand there getting decimated by the
                      enemy until you give another order.
Story.......:  8/10 - The story sucks, the in-game missions are all like, kill
                      all your enemies, rescue missions, nothing spectacular or
                      inventive that the game becomes boring after a few
                      minutes, in case you weren't bored from the start.
Movies......:  3/10 - Not much to see except for the intro, could've been
                      better with inspiring video clips in between missions.
Replay......:  3/10 - After playing the game for one time, I wouldn't dare play
                      it again.
Gender Bias.:  8/10 - The game offers a gameplay and a slew of characters that
                      both males and females will love to play--and get bored
                      with.
Fun Factor..:  4/10 - Yawn, uninteresting gameplay and story.
Multiplayer.:  5/10 - Not much to say here, the game offers 5 multiplayer style
                      matches, but even that not enough to keep boredom out of
                      the way. Go play starcraft instead.
Overall.....:  4/10

The concept of having a RTS game set in the Mythological universe is very cool,
but that is upset by bad gameplay and low production value.
-
The Bottomline:
For $50, this game is a bit overpriced, so don't buy it, not even if you're a
Mythology freak. What do you think we consumers are? Money-growing trees?

Die Hard Trilogy 2
------------------

Publisher...: Fox Interactive
Developer...: 
Homepage....: http://www.foxinteractive.com/products/products.html?/diehard2/index.html
Genre.......: Action-Arcade
Accelerated.: Yes (required)
Price.......: $29.99     
Demo........: 
Requirements: Win9x, Pentium 2200 MMX PC Compatible, 32MB RAM, 200MB HD space,
              2MB accelerator card, DirectX compatible sound card, 4x CD-ROM
ESRB Rating.: Mature (17+) for animated blood and gore, animated violence
Graphics....:  8/10 - The graphics are good, and doesn't slow down in my system
                      There are a lot of graphics effects like explosions that
                      add to the ambience of the game.
Sound.......:  7/10 - Yipee Ki-yay! I just love the sound of exploding barrels
                      and rocket and grenades! woooohoo! rock on! The music is
                      good too, and goes well with the game.
Control.....:  9/10 - Controls are basically point and click, since it's an
                      arcade/console game, so not much to complain about..
Gameplay....:  8/10 - Actually this game is too easy, all enemy are just
                      standing there waiting for you to shoot them. Totally
                      no challange in this game, but it's an arcade game anyway
                      so what do you expect? But hehe, I just love easy games
                      like this :)
Story.......:  3/10 - Story? I don't understand the friggin' story! I even went
                      to their website to research on the story :(
Movies......:  6/10 - Not bad for intro, I haven't been able to go though much
                      of the game to get to see another movie but I assume all
                      you get is an intro movie and an ending movie.
Replay......:  5/10 - I don't think I'll play it again.
Gender Bias.:  6/10 - Well, it may be a boy's game but it sure is a hell lot of
                      fun to point and shoot at enemies just for the hell of it
                      And I guess girls love that too, don't you girls? ;)
Fun Factor..:  6/10 - Not much fun with the game. Just point and shoot the
                      eneny, and enemy's moves are so slow.
Multiplayer.: none
Overall.....:  4/10

Ahh, I disctincly remember playing Die Hard Trilogy 1 on the PlayStation, and
I had a lot of fun with it that's why I've also been looking forward to this
game. Being a big fan of arcade games which you can finish in a few hours, I
find this game quite a good addition to the PC product line, the only downs I
see for this game is the lack of challenge and obviously linear storyline.
-
The Bottomline:
If you're into arcade games, definitely get this. If you want more challenging
ones, then don't.

Sammy Sosa High Heat Baseball 2001
----------------------------------

Publisher...: 3DO http://www.3do.com
Developer...: Team .366 http://www.3do.com
Homepage....: http://www.3do.com/products/pc/hh2001/
Genre.......: Sports
Accelerated.: YES
Price.......: $24.99
Demo........: 55Mb ftp://ftp.avault.com/demos/hh2001.zip
Requirements: Win9x, Pentium 166 PC Compatible, 32MB RAM, 110MB HD space,
              2MB video card, DirectX compatible sound card, 4x CD-ROM
ESRB Rating.: Everyone

Graphics....:  7/10 - The player models and skins are beautifully painted and
                      fluidly rendered. The game also offers the option to
                      choose from a vast array of resolutions ranging from the
                      low-end 640x480 to the higher-end 1200x1600. I played it
                      at 1024x768 and the game played smoothly except at some
                      instances where the game gets a bit choppy due to loading
                      of sounds and graphics. One complaint I have always had
                      about 3DO's baseball games is the audience. The audience
                      looks like a  bitmap of, well, nothing but dots. They
                      look so dull and plain compared to the background
                      audience in NBA Live.
Sound.......:  4/10 - The sound effects are okay, and there is hardly any
                      in-game music to liven up the game. There are no
                      voice-over commentators to add spice to the game either.
Control.....:  7/10 - Controlling the pitcher and batter is very easy, all you
                      have to do is hold one arrow key and press enter and the
                      pitcher will throw the ball in different styles depending
                      on the arrow you pressed. Controlling the fielders and
                      basemen, however, is another story. Due to the 3D camera
                      rotating at different angles, it gets confusing as to
                      where to throw the ball, like, for example I wanted to
                      throw the ball to the first baseman, but it gets thrown
                      to the second baseman instead. Also, you can't configure
                      your controls so there's absolutely no way you can find
                      out which button does which without consulting the manual
Gameplay....:  6/10 - There is not much spice in the game, it looks so dull and
                      dead. There is not much to keep my attention long enough
                      to go through the whole game, and I know many of you out
                      there have short attention spans like me.
Story.......:  N/A  - sports games dont have stories
Movies......:  N/A  - no story = no need for cinematics
Replay......:  7/10 - I grew tired of the game after playing it for about 10
                      minutes but I sure as hell would like to play it again
                      just for the sake of baseball :)
Gender Bias.:  7/10 - What can I say, it's a baseball game and well, baseball
                      is a guy's sport, but with easy controls (you can make
                      the computer controls the out fielders and basemen) I bet
                      a lot of women would be incliened to try out the game as
                      well.
Fun Factor..:  4/10 - Like I said, the game lacks attitude and spice to make
                      the overall experience fun. Announcers, profanity, fights
                      graphical effects, and the like would help give added
                      attraction to the game. Instead, the game looks poorly
                      produced and unmotivated.
Multiplayer.:  none
Overall.....:  6/10

High Heat Baseball 2001 was one of the games I have eagerly anticipated for,
ever since the High Heat series was concieved. I was disappointed to find out
that HHB 2001 was almost like HHB 2000. All they did was make the graphics
look better, update the rosters, and add a few features here and there. I had
been expecting something more from the 	3DO guys, especially with companies
like Electronic Arts owning the Sports gaming industry. And I think they will
continue on this domination not unless the others become more competitive. Cmon
3DO guys, your game engines are all f*cking outdated, from Heroes of Might and
Magic, to Might and Magic, down to the High Heat Baseball series, it seems to
me you guys are getting very low on budget so you keep on reusing the same slow
godforsaken engine over and over again! Don't you guys even have the ambition
of doing something better than the other games out there? Take a look at NBA
Live's motion-capture players, or the animated audiences, or the great 3D
engine that even enables players to use their face as skins. I know 3DO can do
better, but I hope they do this soon enough.

The Bottomline:
$24.99??? are they nuts?? I'd rather save up my money to buy Diablo 2!

Fish's Revenge
--------------

Publisher...: Snarfblat http://www.snarfblat.com/
Developer...: Snarfblat http://www.snarfblat.com/
Homepage....: http://www.snarfblat.com/fishrevscreens.html
Genre.......: Fun
Accelerated.: NO
Price.......: $19.95
Demo........: 8,3 Mb http://www.snarfblat.com/fishdemo.zip
Requirements: Pentium 133 or higher 16 bit graphics card with 2 Meg Video Ram
              2xSpeed CD-ROM 10 Meg Available Hard Drive Space Windows 9x
ESRB Rating.: Everyone

Graphics....:  6/10 - The graphics are pretty good, although they are not 
		      3d rendered. If it was an ordinary fishing game, I would
		      have ranked them lower, but what do i have to say, the 
                      game concept is VERY funny!
Sound.......:  6/10 - There is one happy song playing in the menu and during
		      the game. The in game sounds aren't that spectaculair
	              we have the rod spinning and cast sounds and ofcourse the
		      splashing water! 
Control.....:  5/10 - Well, the controls are way to sensitive if you ask me, if
	              you want to rotate to look for some fishermen it moves
                      too fast. The controls are like this: you use the screen
                      position for speed. For example if you want to reel the
                      line in, you hold the left mouse button, moving the
                      cursor to the top of screen will slow the speed down,
                      moving it closer to the reel will speed things up.
                      Practically the same with rotating the rod. Once you're
                      used to it it's ok..
Gameplay....:  7/10 - What can I say, it's FUN! :)
		      Like this game is not common in any way, the lures make
		      no exception. This is some of the stuff you can choice
                      from:
                      Beef Jerky, Beer, Sheep, Bra's and alot more. When you
                      catch a fisherman, you see his head on a woodenplate like
                      a trophy.
Story.......:  7/10 - The game is about a fish called Fin he is tired of being
		      caught by fishermen and think it's time to pay them back!
                      Pretty original I say..
Movies......:  5/10 - Movies? There aren't any real movies in the game. There
                      is an animation when you start the game, that's
                      explaining the story..
Replay......:  4/10 - The first few times you play it, it's really funny, but I
                      don't think it will last that long...
Gender Bias.:  6/10 - They fishing is a mens sport and that's projected in the 
                      game you can catch fishermen but I didn't see any
                      fisherwomen around. 
Fun Factor..:  6/10 - Like I said before it's pretty fun the first times you
                      play it! :)
Multiplayer.:  N/A
Overall.....:  6/10

I don't know any game I can compare this title with except the fishgames you 
actually fish to get fish (already confused :P) like Trophy Bass. Those games 
are aimed to bring you simulation, this game is pure entertainment!

-
The Bottomline:
Fish's Revenge isn't really expensive, but I suggest you to get the DEMO to see
if you like it enough to spend $19,95 on. If you are looking for simulation get
other fishing titles..

Army Men: Air Tactics

Genre.......: Action

Price.......: $29.95
Demo........: 42.42 Mb ftp://ftp.3do.com/pub/products/airtactics/amatdemo.exe
Requirements: Pentium 133 DirectDraw 2MB SVGA 32Mb of RAM 100MB HD(minimum)
              275MB HD (recommended) and Win9x
ESRB Rating.: Everyone

Graphics....:  7/10 - The graphics are good, they aren't 3d rendered, but that
                      wouldn't make much difference in this type of game. The
                      game uses the overhead view which gives you a good look
                      at the nicely created levels you play in. It's the same
                      view like games such as desert strike.
Sound.......:  7/10 - Let's start with the music, like expected in this type of
                      game it's a nice tune that gets you in the mood of
                      fighting war. The ingame sounds are really cool. This is
                      also the case for the speech.
Control.....:  8/10 - The controls are great and very easy like it shoud be! :)
                      Everything you need to control can be done with just the
                      mouse. Flying, steering, shooting, changing weapons, 
                      everything.
Gameplay....:  7/10 - You can learn how the game works by going to flight
                      school. It teaches you the basics on how to fly the
                      chopper, transport soldiers etc. The game plays really
                      well I must say. 
Story.......:  6/10 - It's kinda like the same story as other army men titles,
                      but for the people that don't know or never played them,
                      here it is. The game is about the war between the Greens
                      and the Tans. You probably played it yourself when you
                      were a kid :)
Movies......:  7/10 - When you start the game there is a really cool intro
                      movie. Also the game features some well done cutscenes..
Replay......:  7/10 - I liked the game pretty much. Although every mission you
                      have to fly the plastic warchopper it's not boring. Every
                      level is a small new adventure. 
Gender Bias.:  7/10 - Girls playing with plastic soldiers? Can you imagine? :)
                      But I think the girls will like the game too, it's fun
                      and plastic soldiers don't bleed :)
Fun Factor..:  7/10 - The game sure is fun. The people that like the other
                      titles will loves this one, because it brings a new touch
                      to the army men titles...
Multiplayer.:  7/10 - Take on your friends for some toy warfare! You can choose
                      between 4 teams, of course the greens and tans, but also
                      the blue and gray. You can choice between three types of
                      multiplayer games: Savage Scavenge, Death match and Bug
                      Hunt. You can win bug hunt by killing the most bugs, like
                      roaches. Everyone knows death match that brings us to
                      savage scavenge. This game type where you have to fill or
                      your landing pads with the right vials.
Overall.....:  7/10

I liked the game more then I thought I would. It reminds me of desert strike
mixed with the cool plastic soldiers. It didn't bore me and I still didn't 
complete the game :)

-
The Bottomline:
If you like the Army Men, this title is sure worth to add it to your collection.
If you are looking for some serious war games, don't get this!
