                       The Netmonkey Courier Report
                                 Issue XII
                         June 28th - July 5th, 1998



	So. We're back. And you'd damn well better PHEAR, naegros..

	This is the Netmonkey Courier Report, a little scoreboard for the scene's
	best. We are doing this because there was a hole that needed filling, and
	who better to fill it? Now, we aren't doing this to try and compete with
	the CWS, or any of that shit. I think the CWS is great. Keep up the good
	work boys!! (hi tech!) We just felt like doing something a little
	different.
	There are those out there who might think this shit is biased towards one
	group or another (DMS) and that the rating system is unfair/inaccurate.
	Well, to those people, i say, "Get off your fat fucking asses, and write
	your own goddamn courier report. Ya might as fucking well, cause it sure as
	hell doesn't look like you spend much time couriering"... but more on that
	later..  ;)
	Having said that, yeah, we are gonna try to be fair and accurate, otherwise
	whats the bloody point?

	Anyways, here's the way its done:

	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we do it
	that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get #1
	on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. We total it all up,
	and rank the 10 best couriers. And because we are only using the top sites
	out there, you can rest assured that they are the scene's 10 best.

	Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... heh... fuck
	off and die..


  the top ten sites for this week are:

  x3 STH -*- ET -*- E -*- MW -*- NMS
  x2 DO -*- LA -*- TMS -*- MSV -*- UC

Well here we are again..Issue #12 already..fear that huh? It's come time
to revamp my beginning, someone needs to draw me a dope little ascii for
this eh? Thx. Uhm Blackacd is one slow mofo, and so my report is still
not up on  his page, so harrass him everytime you can to get him to do
it. But on to the fun my friends, was quite a week.


Dimension: I said God damn niggaz, not alot of sites up this week,
but GOD DAMN on STH and some others..like tripling stats and shit.
I am thoroughly impressed, and still not all of our guys are active,
so step back:) Laf

Risc:  Hrm, well they had the riscftp lamer Native, but now he's Dev,
so they aint got shit again.

Devotion: They got Native, but doesn't change much, Garoto is there
as always. The rock. Not much else to say though.

Millenium: Hah!@

Ambition: All the acquisitions have finally jumped up and started trading.
We will see if this continues for long. Good job so far people.

Atomic/VGN/Misc other groups:  Not doing much eh.

Weekly Shizzat: Seems Psi got some revenge on the pftp lamers, and I
forget who all got caught, but Solid and K_Lecter did, so that's too
bad to see one of AMB's good ppl go down as a fraud, and well Solid was
new. So pftp lamers can die. What else is going on, some sites are FINALLY
coming back, and that makes me happy.  Brain enjoyed my little stabs at
him last week, so that's a plus, seems the boy has a sense of humor, if
no brain whatsoever.(g). 2 people fled the sinking ship that is MNM this
week. One is just a lamer named Biggy and the other is an even bigger
lamer named Chr0nik(kiss kiss). Biggy Smalls is in Dev now though. Chr0nik
will be forced to join Fate to show off his fearsome courier skills(g).
We also experienced Tdpriest's birthday, it was on tuesday, so for everyone
that didn't msg him that day, please do so at your convenience:) Jess the
Squirt Queen has returned to attempt to bring life back into VGN. She
took Roc from me (bad girl!), and Kruzin after being removed from DMS, has
moved on to VGN as well. I'm sure she's out recruiting like mad to get
them back up to snuff. So we will see how long it lasts before she
retires again.:)

Woot, peace out folks
