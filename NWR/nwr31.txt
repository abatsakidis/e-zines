    Thank you!


    
    Well, another week goes by and NWR is here again. Some news this week 
    of a new emag, and that maybe scenelink.org will be reopening as well. 
    So we wish them luck and we will continue to do our little show here. 
    I didn't finish my story tihs week because ND wants to goto sleep 
    early like a little bitch, but we have some pretty good logs this 
    week. :)

                                       -Lester [Co-Editor/Head Writer]


        Bah! Some of us have jobs to go to in the morning!
        (Or rather, HOPE that our jobs will still be there when we get
    there, after we spent all week IRC last week..)
        For all of you who were wondering why there were no Games 
    predictions from prozac last week, well.. uhh... its cause... i ... uh
    I forgot to tell him to do some... so, he graciously included them in
    his report this week, as always, definately worth reading. ;)
        Check out "crcfight.log" that mgd gave me.. This is a log from
    1996 from the site CrC... THIS was what curries had to go through
    when they had a pre 3 years ago... HAHAHAH.. some things HAVE changed
    for the better.... maybe...   <g>
        OH MAN! are we ever gonna take a lot of flack over our Eternal
    log... *sigh*... I just *know* i am gonna get a few sternly worded
    letters over this one.. ;p  
        Apart from all that shit, we got the usual good stuff this week,
    news, utils reports, game report, curry stuff... you know what its
    all about.
        Coded version coming soon (no, really! it IS coming soon!) and 
    we got a bunch of ppl doing spiffy webpages for us.. maybe when i 
    get some fat ADSL we will go to a realaudio version of all this shit..
        We tried to keep the size down a bit this week, as i'm sure it
    will get pretty out of control when we start to release in different
    mediums. 
        Thanks to glen, snakeeyes, wishmaster, and mgd for their help
    with weektops, logs, and news.. take care everyone

-----------[ ndetroit's sites and stats section ]-----------


    Oh man.. ok.. i gotta say this first, before i get to the rest of 
  the sites.. HADES (HOE, i guess) has just about the nicest damn daemon
  i have ever seen... It blew me away. A lot of time and attention to
  detail has been spent making it what it is... So, good work to the HOE
  staff, and the rest of you: GET TO WORK ON YOUR CODING!

    On to the news.. 
    mgoh has a new site up, its called ROOT, and is on the same link as
  as the old dafat was, tho its a different staff, daemon, and box.. 
  (hence, different site). Its already fairly fast, and i'm sure they
  will have no trouble finding good affils for it.
    FLASH (fmud) has been getting faster and faster and faster these
  days, an especially impressive feat, considering it has NO AFFILS.
  Fmud is 35 gigs, 0day+ISO, and has a couple of old siteops... 
  Oh, and the site is sitting on an OC3 backbone somewhere on the US 
  west coast. 

    Dee tells me that TG is 10x faster than TD/TV, now that RiSC, DEV,
  PHX, (and iCT?) were all racing for an affil there. Decide for yourself.
  I logged in there, and it seemed fairly fast enough for me..
    RiSC won the affil contest, by more than 400mb over the next group.
  That means TG will be the first US since TRS went down a year ago.
  A sign of things to come?
    DL is back, after being down for a while.. Same place as before.
    Is the US getting to the point where it can rival euro again? Maybe
  not quite yet, but I'd say that they are definately on their way to
  a big fat comeback. With sites like TV, TD, TG, FMUD, DL, TOS, TMS, and
  a few others that i won't name, things are looking good for the yanks.
    VDR became corp and dev.
    DOPE became corp, trps, and aod.
    MSV is back. We'll see if they have what it takes to make our list. 
  They are Blizzard WHQ, Dev, and Premiere. To my knowledge, prm only has
  msv and tms as sites now, so... that affil will likely help them out
  a great deal.

    If you are wondering why HOE isn't yet in the X3 column, its because
  one of our little informal rules is that a site can't start out in the 
  x3 row.. It will be there next week, i am sure, as the site is certainly
  fast enough, has good affils, and.... .... did i mention the daemon yet?
    For those of you keeping track at home, there are now 5 sites that we
  never mention in NWR... see if you can figure them out all by yourself ;p    

    Thanks to all the siteops who went out of their way to give me weektops
  for this week, the NWR TOP 10 should be a little more accurate.. For
  all you who bitched about it last week, well JESUS FUCKING CHRIST, WHY
  DON'T YOU READ A LITTLE CLOSER NEXT TIME.. if its gonna ruin your week 
  to see an incomplete top10 released, then get off your useless asses 
  and fetch me the weektops yourselves, bitches... ;p
        
  
=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. 
	Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... 
heh... fuck off and die..

Lester's Biased Courier Report


Another week..another waste of time by alot of ppl..:)

Dimension: Pretty down week, not alot of action here. Resurgence at the end 
of the week, but still the stats were down for this week. We'll see what 
happens in the new week. Picked up Rz3 in the middle of the week though.

Devotion: Lost Dragoth to IND, and rumors of others to follow. But the 
group still had a decent week, despite Wishmaster being removed from VDR 
for excessive restarting. If other siteops follow, it will be bad for 
Devotion.

Millennium: Mossyjoke is back trading, and rumors of his pending retirement 
are abound and if that happens, MNM may not be able to survive. 

Risc: Well after some stirring conversations with Eternal this week, my 
respect for risc continues to decline. Kruzin was removed from MW/VDR 
this week and other sites are following suit. Their "best" trader will 
soon be gone from all sites. Does not bode well for Riscy.

Vengeance: doing well on STH. Not alot happening elsewhere besides the 
usual effort from TC. Rumors about a VGN/AOD merge were abound. But AOD 
spokesperson states that it will never happen. First Risc, and now AOD. 
Seems VGN is worried about their existance.

AOD: The kids continue to grow, picking up the site DOPE and retired Geno 
from Risc. They continue to quietly build a stronger and stronger group. 
Good job 


Well, I strove for objectivity this week, to see how the fans like it. 
Next week I'll be back to normal..:)

-----------[ Prozac's Kinda Biased Gaming Report]-----------
            
Prozac's Kinda Biased Gaming Report - Jan. 9th - Jan. 17th - #5

The talk of the week has been SimCity 3000 = Beta or Final? The evidence 
shows it is beta, but others are siding with OGN that it is final. The 
truth shall be told in a couple weeks. To finish off the week, RZR quietly 
puts out a stellar game, only to be shot down as not being 100% final. 
All this and much more in my weekly gaming report. We start it with..

Predictions in '99:

In NWR #30, the best of 1998, at the end of the article was a prediction's
section on what will happen with each group in '99. NDetroit forgot to 
mention this when I wrote my best of '98 report, and didn't find out until 
I read NWR #30 I was suppose to write a game group prediction's article So 
to make it up
to the scene, here are my predictions of '99.


Class - Will make it through '99 having another good year. Will be kind of
lackluster compared to '97 & '98, but it'll be another good year.

Paradigm - This group is a little shaky coming into '99. It'll be year to make
or break this group.

Razor - Going down the downward spiral. I think the only thing that'll keep
this group together through '99 is its past. But don't be surprised if they
don't make it in '99.

Origin - If the guys in this group can keep things in check, we could have a
pretty good group in '99.

Backlash - Long live those germans. It'll be another time of monthly surprises.

Divine - This group is on life-support in my books.

Fusion - This unknown french group could be some trouble in '99.



Class-
It wasn't pretty. When Class can only muster a card game, you just know
it's January, the dead month for the scene. There hasn't been too much
activity from this group for the last couple weeks. Quality has not exactly
been on Class's side this month. Lets hope for some changes over the coming
weeks.

Hot Releases:
Bridge Master Class II - 4 disks

Paradigm-
Patch-digm? That's what it seems like it's been all month. There has been no
activity from the suppliers, so the crackers are working on other things. At
least we know who's been active in the scene. Until the suppliers show some
life, it'll be like this for a while.

Hot Releases:
N/A - 2 weeks in a row.

Razor-
Just when you think everything is starting to turn for RZR, another blow to
the belt happens. No, I'm not talking about a Punisher vs Tyson fight, I'm
talking about EA coming out on the 17th saying there isn't a final gold master
yet: http://sidgames.com/ac/

Going Gold...One More Time 

Scott Udell has posted the following on the Computer Games Online AC forum:
Just found out that the *second* "gold master" was found to have a crash bug
in it, so they're working on yet another one. They said they never officially
announced the game's release date, so the planned date of Feb.
9th may or may not now hold true. The brand spanking new "third final" is
supposed to be ready "early next week." 

<Juice> thats one game dupe, one patch dupe, and a beta for razor this month

<angwee> i don't think RZR's version was even the most recent beta build

Sad, sad, sad. What is RZR doing? Trying to purposely self-destruct? This just
puts tarnish on the blade's reputation. When will it ever quit? 

Hot Releases:
Alpha Centari - 20 disks

Origin-
During the week ][ce messaged me and told me I hurt his feelings making fun 
of UK people in my report. I should iterate that my report in NWR #30 was
intended at Cypher, who has yet to learn any self-control. During the week we
see the alliance of DVNiSO take full action with the well-awaited release of
SimCity 3000. This also created & fueled rumors of it being a beta, then a
blow at OGN when it was found out that the word brings up version number in
Simcity 3000: SC3KBeta102991.1 OEM VERSION: SC3KBeta102991.1. It might be just
another game that says beta, but really final. PDM's angwee is behind OGN
saying they did put out a final. We'll know in a couple weeks of the truth.
I'm now at an impartial state of opinion on this matter. Let's get the truth,
and have it confirmed before screaming bloody beta. The rest of the week ends
with a game ripped up by OGN that's been in euro stores for a while/weeks,
along with another hunting game. 

Hot Releases:
Natural Fawn Killers - 17 disks
SimCity 3000 - 56 disks
Liath - 45 disks

Divine-
Dead. Dead. Dead. I was thinking of starting soon the "other" groups, the
people in the gaming scene that put out good games iND, or groups that aren't
too active in the scene that put out once in a while. Divine will fall under
this label soon. Starting in issue #32, all future GOOD games worthing mention
from iND, DVN, BLH, FSN or other no name groups will be mentioned. I'll also
give a weekly update about the groups that are active.

Hot Releases:
N/A

Springer'ish Final Thoughts:
With the power of Real Audio & Shoutcast available to the people on the
Internet, it is surprising that noone in the scene has taken advantage of
these technologies for the benefit of helping the scene. We have seen
magazines for years now and now people should take the time to reap these
great pieces of software. I had been contemplating of starting up an audio
scene report and would like your feedback. Hell, I want your feedback for
anything I do, which's what I live for! I did a test broadcast last week
which was mildly successful. We should get the word of the scene out. The
press is one way, but here is a chance for a larger audience.

  Bud's Biased Utils Report #7
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Hey! Yeah you... you weren't thinking of SKIPPPING my intro just to see
 what your group scored, now were you???? Naughty! =) Anyways after the 
 huge week last week, I'm not sure if the utils scene can actually top 
 themselves. But I'm hoping everyone at least gives it a shot. 

 Now a lot of people are always telling me how crappy the utils scene is,
 and how only games really matter, and so on and so forth. (I'm bringing 
 it up because I heard it again yesterday...). I'll admit, the utils scene 
 can be tedious at times... a lot of junk gets released. So why review it?
 Well for one thing so people know who's to blame for that junk. ;) Mostly 
 for the part that isn't junk, and for the people who might actually use 
 some of the programs released. Of course the reports are just my opinion... 
 but there are people who use what's released, a LOT of it. And something 
 else I've noticed... the people who tell me how the utils scene sucks are 
 always the ones I see asking for some app they can't find.
                             
 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 01/10/98 to 01/16/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.

 Sierra.Fashion.Trip.For.Designers-CORP      

 Somebody, and I honestly don't remember who, passed on to me that the
 Asymetrix apps Corp put out last week were freeware. So I decided to check
 it out. Corp put out two, I looked at one due to time constraints. I chose
 Aymetrix Toolbox II Neuron 6.5 because I saw it first. Anyways, I decided
 to check Corps's NFO to see if any work had been done on the program. Nope,
 no crack according to them. I then downloaded two versions - one from
 Asymetrix's public FTP site and the CORP version. Both filenames identical,
 but Corp's was smaller by a wee bit. Installing them, I was given the exact
 same setup routine. No protection in either. Running them, no difference in
 usability, and no limits on the Asymetrix public copy. Exact same license
 agreement. The size I can give to the fact that the app was recently updated
 on the Asymetrix FTP site. But anyways, looks free to me. So -1 to Corp for
 that.
 
 This week saw IBM's WebSphere Performance Pack 1 for NT, which looks
 very nice (can't test it, don't run a server). Autometrix SmSw 6, despite
 its price tag, is only useful to those making sails. I don't even have a
 boat! And if I did I wouldn't be making my own sails, nor do I plan on
 working in that industry... oh well it is legit! Active Words = another
 voice recognition app that lets you load up programs and shit... is 
 clicking the mouse that hard ya fucking lazy bastards?!? Ok it does more 
 than just that. Cracked by UCF though? Hmmm... beats me, MFD cracked the 
 last version. Sierra Fashion Trip for Designers??? This kinda freaked me 
 out... reading the NFO it says video's were "reduced" 30% by Corp... blah 
 who wants fashion video's??
 
 Corp NFO states: "If you love style, you'll love this revolutionary, 
                   interactive, personalized fashion consultant."

 Sorry, I don't love style. And anybody who needs the advice of a 
 computer program for style tips is just... fuck do I even need to 
 explain??? I don't need to try on "Over 30 brands worth of outfits
 and accessories." And I thought warez was a fantasy world...

 Anyways I'll stop bashing Corp now... they did do some decent apps
 this week, and they are a good group. Personally MWCS Pathway appealed to 
 me the most. Not what I expected from Corp though - the week just really 
 paled compared to last. The lost point hurt them.

 As usual, RiSE owned the Bentley products, so we get to see the crackers
 at work. Nice suprise with a new Dragon Point and Speak version, an actually
 GOOD voice recognition program... but the NFO says it all.
 Type..........: Lazy Typing Prog - exactly. ;) They finished off with a
 keymaker for QuickBooks Pro 99 that PFT/RiSCiSO released earlier...
 apparently the PFT release won't support large amounts of users (ie 10+
 PC's on a network). Dunno since I haven't tested it, but a good week for
 RiSE - and a nice bonus for Quickbooks users stuck with the limitation.

 NEWTEK.AURA.V1.0C.UPDATE-SiEGE     [02 x 1.44MB]

 I missed out on mentioning SGE's IronCAD release last week, simply due to
 the fact that I had already handed in the report by the time I checked it 
 out. Blame it on Ndetroit, he said there was no time for any additions. ;P
 But it's a great app (if you're involved with CAD that is). As for this week,
 kind of slow for the normally busy Siege team. First release of EDLMAX, and
 WaveFilter Tools, a suite with several components that LightWave users will
 likely enjoy. Also on the plus side, Accpac looks like a decent financial
 management app, although its not my area - no experience with running
 finances for large companies (warez groups do not count!). Still there's
 a fairly wide audience for this, and corp's are usually the ones hit with
 nasty licensing fees on this type of app.

 Life signs are fading... they did release Ansys, which is a nice enough
 corporate app, but it was a tad large... enough sites kept it though. I'll
 give it to them.

 Good week for SHOCK, with a few pretty good apps and the usual assortment
 of average titles in between. They took WinWay Resume 6, which had been
 out for a little while, as well as Arcsoft's Photo Fantasy 2, and an
 overpriced (imo) IBM app. This week was the first in a while where
 SHOCK put out a large number of titles like the old days of the group...
 hmmm nothing else outstanding so I'll end it there.

 ENTITY:

 Releases: 

 CLOUDSCAPE.DEVELOPER-ENTiTY [12 x 1.44MB]

 I get the feeling ENT is really on its last legs. I kinda hope
 I'm wrong, since I really like Entity as a group. Like I said January
 was gonna prove if Entity still had it in them, and so far they've been
 mostly unproductive. It's one thing to be this idle when you've been 
 around for a few years, it's another for a relatively young group. 
 On the bright side, Bones gives the follow statement:
 <Bones> btw bud, no ent releases this week but next week im busting out

 PFT raced SCUM on OnTime Enterprise (see the SCUM review for info
 on that). Pretty much up to the siteops which they want to keep.
 For the rest, as usual they got a mass amount of megs out. A few Seagate
 apps, Desaware's spyWorks 6, and a new version of WinRunner stand out.
 They got a bit sloppy on Wise InstallBuilder 7, as FCN's InstallMaster
 7.01 release was a higher edition that contained InstallBuilder's features.
 Aside from that an ok week, although nothing we haven't seen from PFT
 before. Still a nice week overall. Grrr I'm repetitive.

 Note to LND: Please include cracks with your releases. They work better
 that way. =) For the releases, we see a minor update of the minor
 update of Cimatron It that LND released last month. And another copy
 of ARCServe IT. This one allows open file backup support, and it is indeed
 a seperate product from the last ARCServe IT release. Hightlight of the
 week is Lotus's SmartSuite 9.1 final - which is LND's own work (wow!), 
 and they got the ISO out as well. So I can't knock em for it. Autodesk 
 Mapguide Author isn't too shabby either. Dare I say LND's improving?
 Well they still aren't the LND of old... and PowerTool, one of the
 few LND members I really respected, stepped down this week and went
 to RiSE. He commented on the change: 

 <Powahtool> Got tired of all of Grade's bitching
 <Powahtool> Easy and Grad should marry

 Many people are still at odds with the use of other groups cracks/serials,
 myself included. But this is BIASED, remember! That about wraps it up on
 the LND front. No points for the Solaris app since I can't run it (holds
 true for all groups). Betas don't get full points.. still not too bad.

 Damn I can't make fun of these guys being idle anymore. This
 week wasn't up to par with their last though. WorldView Developer's Edition
 2.1 has been out for quite some time, I had planned on releasing it a few
 months ago but never got around to it. It is a nice VRML development app,
 and I'm a big fan of the WorldView Plugin for Netscape (I never thought
 much of Cosmo), but I figured it was too old (april98) to release... guess
 PNC didn't. Presto Copier is a middle of the road type app as far as scan
 software goes, it's a nice enough package but nothing special. I really
 wanted to comment on PhotoGraphics from Extensis, makers of many a fine
 PhotoShop plugin. PNC got this nice and early - however, I later learnt
 that PNC's serial didn't work, so grab the HTG release instead. Rest of the
 week was decent, some decent web tools. Hopefully next week will be
 smoother.

 I missed out on something last week which I should have caught.
 PRM's Presto Photo Album 1.57 was included in the TRPS release of
 Mr. Photo v2.0, so technically it's a dupe. I really should have caught
 it since I reviewed Mr. Photo in edition #3 of the report. Not sure
 I can blame PRM too much as they would have to be familiar with Mr.
 Photo to know what was included.

 Moving on to the current week, first thing that caught my attention
 was the lack of PRM's usual mass releasing. Sure, they haven't been
 releasing as much as the prior group since the start of this comeback,
 but even so I expected a little more. Still, what they did put out
 was decent.

 Looks like Lester's DOD prediction may come true (gee suprised? ;)). They
 certainly are doing better in the first few weeks of 1999 than they did in
 the last few months of 98. Still, after day one this week, it was all quiet
 on the Eastern front. My prediction is things will pick up for them next
 week, but as anyone who's seen my test scores knows, I'm frequently wrong. ;)

 Hightlights here are Ulead's Gif-X, Sheridan's Component Suite 2 (Sheridan
 anything will be popular with developers), and another development app,
 Visual UML.

        [HTG] Looking for a WHQ [HTG]

 HERITAGE:

 Archivista.v1.0.Win9x-Heritage         [05 x 1.44MB]

 AnzioLite.v12.0j-Heritage              [01 x 1.44MB]

 Heritage improves a little this week, and it's really the first week
 that they seem to fit in with the other groups in the field. PNC released
 Extensis PhotoGraphics first, but after chatting with Kirk Hammet the other
 night I discovered the serial included by PNC wasn't working. Since they
 still haven't put one out, HTG gets credit for the crack. On the minus
 side, AnzioLite was a dupe of some cracking group (my memory fails me as
 to which), but thats not all bad because personally I think Anzio sucks.
 I'm not familiar with the other two apps so lets move on. =)

 The first thing from TRPS that really caught my attention this week
 was Crescent's Inet Tookpak, which is a nice little package. Intelligent
 SMTP gateway looks like a crappy minor version until you notice that 
 the last release of it was in 97, and it's not half bad either. On
 the downside, two Tax apps... a lot of sites nuke them. (I count
 them but will never score them high, as they're localized).

 The biggest TRPS "incident" this week was their release of NetObjects
 Fusion 4, which they claim to be retail. Now if you recall, Premiere
 released this recently, with a crack of questionable origin. Nonetheless,
 it worked, and was accepted. PRM apologized, gave UCF credit for
 the crack, and all was well. But. TRPS decided to release a copy.
 Retail + Working they said. Some sites nuked it, seeing as how the PRM
 version worked. TRPS members then went ballistic over the nuke, saying
 that their "retail" copy had more features. What features, nukers asked?
 TRPS says that PRM's inserts "made with trial of net objects fusion"
 on pages it creates, and says trial on several screens. Nukers felt
 that saying trial didn't mean shit since limitations were removed,
 and the message in the HTML could simply be deleted. A nice angry log can
 be found on union.jaded.net (ReleaseHQ) in the features section. It shows
 what NOT to do when you release something questionable. Nukers pointed
 out that TRPS's release was essentially the same as the PRM, only
 TRPS included the manuals which could be download free anyways. They
 also asked TRPS members what features their release had that the PRM was
 missing - possibly giving TRPS a chance to have it unnuked. But TRPS
 REFUSED to give any proof, instead bitching at the siteops - like I said,
 what NOT to do. Anyways check the log. I agree with the siteops, and
 especially Sanctuari, who handled it quite well.

 a little while, ACE did a nice job of getting it done. Unfortunately that's
 all we saw this week from ACE.

 not that it's worth much anyways. But two in one week? Crap. Good job
 on getting ImageAXS Pro 4 done though. The rest was pretty basic.

 Teamware.i-Flow.v3.0-SCuM                   [19 x 1.44MB]

 Well one of the most talked about comebacks in the past year finally
 happened, and made OnTime Enterprise their first release. Not too shabby
 a title, either. Only one problem. PFT released it as well... after SCUM
 had started it, but PFT finished first on a lot of sites. Then it got a bit
 confusing. Some sites nuked the SCUM release saying PFT had won... then
 about an hour later I saw SCUM unnuked on some of these sites, and PFT nuked
 instead. Others decided to keep both. I'm not sure if it really matters...
 SCUM's is a disk smaller, but the two releases finished at almost the same
 time. The whole point is: SCUM is back.

 The second release for SCUM came into some problems as well... it needed a
 fix, just a forgotten reg file though. So my thoughts on SCUM? Well they
 aren't the SCUM of old, but then they aren't pretending to be. Despite the
 problems, the titles so far have been decent. Will they dominate as in the
 past? I doubt it - but expect some good work from them.

 Woah, hey what the?!? Well Sodom returns out of nowhere with a few releases.
 Didn't really expect this, but then I've been out of it the past few days.
 Dizzident, Cyber Wolf, Sbarro and some others, more to be announced...
 The first few releases aren't astounding, and out of the two comebacks
 this week I'd give it to Scum, but the point is they're releasing.

 I gave the week to RiSE for Dragon & Bently crack jobs (Dragon being the
 only speech rec I like, and that anyone would find all that useful), also
 for fixing up Quickbooks, and to (gasp) LND for Lotus SmartSuite and
 some other half decent apps, although talent wise I don't consider LND
 anywhere close to RiSE. Siege came close behind - but I don't feel they
 made the same presence. PFT/SHK also had decent weeks.

 Alright so the last seven days didn't live up to the previous week. Oh well,
 some decent work as usual, nothing really special... I've kinda been out of
 it this week since the school semester started up again, and the Sodom
 comeback suprised me. Two groups of old coming back with debut releases this
 week... pretty cool, especially since they both have a lot of potential.
 Of course it's going to be tough to live up to past reputations.

 Alright, that does it... screw you guys, I'm goin' home. =)

=---------[ Lesters Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 


Movie Reviews

Well this week I saw two movies, and you'd never be able to guess that 
the movie made by MTV would be better than the critically revered film 
by Terence Malick, but that is the case!

The Thin Red Line
Directed by: Terence Malick
Starring: Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson, Sean Penn, and a shitload of 
          other people
Rating: 2 Stars

Well, I'm not positive what I expected when I went into this film, but 
what I got was certainly not it. It is an excruciating 3 hour film, with 
star cameos flashing by faster than you can realize who they are. The 
camera finds amazingly beautiful scenery to shoot, but then it is 
found too often. Malick continually goes back to the beauty of nature 
and the complexity of men, with their voiceovers and flashbacks that 
clutter the film. The storming of the hill and actual battle scenes 
are good, and the movie looks like it will pick up, and then it merely 
sputters and goes back down hill. There are some good performances, 
but you bond with no character, and the allstar cast is left to just 
be pretty faces in the crowd.

----

Varsity Blues
MTV Pictures
Starring: James Van Der Beek, Jon Voight
Rating: 3 and 1/2 stars out of 4

Dawson from Dawson's Creek stars as a backup quarterback in a small 
Texas town who is thrust into the spotlight after the star QB is 
injured. Skyrocketing to stardom and trying to bring the team to a 
district title, he has fallout with his girlfriend, a chance to taste 
a whipcream bikini(nice scene), and some heavy drinking. The movie 
is pretty damn funny and also pretty good. Jon Voight plays the big 
bad coach who is like a god in that small town. The struggles between 
the team and the coach is what the movie is essentially about, and 
Dawson plays his first role besides Dawson quite well. Worth checking 
out, and much worthier of your money than TTRL.

--------[One HELL of a Funny Log]----------


Well, i came across this log that lester gave me, and i just HAD to run
it... *THIS* is the "man" that is running RiSC, a group respected, admired,
and indeed feared by many for years. Its sad the way things have worked
out, isn't it? Again.. this is probably really lame of us to post this
log, and lester DID say that this wasn't necessarily for NWR, but hell..
We are already pretty damn lame, i thought the people would be better
served if they could get a candid look at 2 of the scene's leaders..
BAHAHAHAHAHA...
or rather, one leader, and one semi-dead figurehead... which is which?
you be the judge. ;)


Session Start: Mon Jan 11 21:46:19 1999
<|Eternal|> you only wish you could've done what eagle_1 did for 5 years
<Lester> eh?:)
<|Eternal|> btw..amnesia lost..and you will lose again..wake up and smell 
the coffee lester..DMS is sinking =)
<Lester> AMN didn't lose, we beat Risc..and as for DMS..i think you need 
to wake up and realize what is happening to your own group and not 
worry about mine
<|Eternal|> hah
<|Eternal|> is that why amnesia died a long time ago ?
<Lester> I dont wish I could have cheated to remain on top in AMN like E1 
did for risc
<Lester> AMN didn't wish to ruin it's name to stay on top like Risc has 
done
<|Eternal|> btw..we didnt kick those members..get your facts straight
<|Eternal|> and instead of destroying every groups reputation why don't 
you use a positive way of thinking
<Lester> every groups rep? only risc my friend
<|Eternal|> but i guess things will never change ... have fun with your 
biased reports and false weektops
<Lester> I have a very positive way of things
<|Eternal|> yeah right..
<|Eternal|> positive towards DMS and AOD
<Lester> false weektops? haha give me a break..we use the real 
weektops..only kruzin was replacing weektops to improve his stats
<|Eternal|> bash the hell out of risc and mnm
<Lester> and why shouldn't I?
<Lester> you guys make fools of yourselves
<|Eternal|> why would kruzin need to change weektops he's owning Enigma
<|Eternal|> is that why you started trading ?
<Lester> ask him, he was deleted from FS for doing it
<|Eternal|> why don't you tell the whole truth justin
<Lester> i always trade eternal
<Lester> off and on
<|Eternal|> Enigma was bought
<|Eternal|> plain and simple
<Lester> bought?
<Lester> you think I sent hw?
<Lester> gimme a break
<|Eternal|> duh
<Lester> I did NOTHING to get E, except ask
<|Eternal|> after 6 years of loyalty you think anyone sane would sell out 
?
<|Eternal|> right
<Lester> sell out? you all have sold out
<Lester> that's why he left
<Lester> the old Risc is a faint memory..destroyed by people like you
<|Eternal|> haha..the old scene will never return we both know that
<|Eternal|> my means of getting people is not by bribery nor by buying 
them
<Lester> so you simply decide to destroy the new scene?
<|Eternal|> i'm destroying the scene ?
<|Eternal|> i think not
<Lester> I have never bribed or bought anyone eternal..risc has done it 
many times..ask you friend thepep about his tactics
<|Eternal|> your biased and negativity will destroy it
<|Eternal|> i can't change the past
<Lester> I bring comedy in NWR, and I also have many articles to attempt 
to reinstate some morals in the scene..maybe if you paid attention and 
grew up you might notice that
<|Eternal|> only pave the future
<Lester> well, if risc changes for the positive in the future then I will 
not rag on them, will I?
<|Eternal|> I don't know..everyone has ragged on them..I seriously doubt 
you'll ever change
<|Eternal|> nor will the scene
<Lester> Risc has to change, dont you see that
<Lester> you specifically said..EVERYONE has ragged on you guys
<|Eternal|> risc is changing
<Lester> why do you suppose that is?
<Lester> christ
<|Eternal|> this year we are making a total comeback
<Lester> by placing some of the greatest risc members on "probation"
<|Eternal|> you tell me
<Lester> your council is in chaos..brain is retired and doesn't consider 
himself part of the council
<|Eternal|> did you like the old scene or this scene ?
<Lester> the old scene of course
<Lester> that is the point of nwr
<|Eternal|> well in the old scene there was only RiSC
<Lester> i have nothing but respect for the old risc
<Lester> the newer Risc..shortly after AMN started, is where I lost my 
respect for them
<Lester> and as has the rest of the scene
<|Eternal|> and my point is i can not change that
<|Eternal|> but we'll never die
<|Eternal|> realize that
<Lester> and you expect to win my opinion by ragging on me and accusing 
me of buying E?
<|Eternal|> why don't you admit it ?
<|Eternal|> then i won't have to accuse you
<Lester> because it's not true? I dont even have HW resources anymore
<|Eternal|> clubber was with us for 5 years+
<Lester> we dont do hw
<Lester> yes he was..and now he realized that what he believed in and was 
loyal to, is no longer there
<|Eternal|> but that's ok..i don't expect DMS to be around much longer
<|Eternal|> considering majority of the other groups despise it
<Lester> replaced by new people and disrespectful powerhungry kids
<|Eternal|> btw..if you are so damn good, then why did godbless/wishmastr 
jump the boat to Devotion ?
<Lester> if you expect DMS to die because wish/gb left..you need to think 
again, I've faced FAR greater adversity in AMN
<Lester> they both had desires to be in Devotion..why did Geno leave for 
AOD?
<Lester> shit happens
<|Eternal|> because he feels close to morbid for some reason 
<|Eternal|> he said he was never going to trade again and retired fully 
now
<Lester> and no loyalty to the Risc of today..
<|Eternal|> the risc of today is going to come back
<|Eternal|> with a vengeance
<Lester> good for them..but no longer on the strength of the old dynasty
<|Eternal|> eagle-1 is still around my friend
<|Eternal|> never sell yourself short
<Lester> i saw eagle1 just 3 days ago in risciso
<Lester> what is your point?
<|Eternal|> your stupid jokes about him are lame
<Lester> "jokes" ..exactly
<|Eternal|> he's dead, nerveous break down..what kind of shit is that ?
<|Eternal|> it's a personal attack
<Lester> why? I dont know him personally
<Lester> how can I personally attack an irc acquaintance
<|Eternal|> how ?..people actually believe this shit ?
<Lester> haha no one believes he is dead
<Lester> it is clearly meant as a joke..and also I didn't write the part 
about him being dead
<|Eternal|> and don't go posting this conversation..that would be the 
lamest thing
<Lester> would it?
<Lester> I thought I was already beyond lame
<|Eternal|> if you ever want my respect acting lame and bashing the hell 
out of risc won't get you there
<|Eternal|> some people highly regard you..others hate you emensely
<|Eternal|> i'd rather have good terms with other group leaders
<Lester> bashing me wont stop me from bashing risc
<|Eternal|> regardless of what they stand for
<Lester> and I know that I have my enemies, and that is because I refuse 
to waver from my beliefs and moral ties to the old scene that i was 
taught
<|Eternal|> i'd rather have good terms with other group leaders <-- 
repeat this in your brain again
<Lester> you bashed me first..I haven't spoken to you in 6 months
<Lester> so dont say that I was putting you and I on bad terms
<|Eternal|> true..well i'm sorry about that..maybe we can be decent after 
all
<|Eternal|> i don't like fighting with people over stupid ordeals
<Lester> if Risc truly believes in changing it's ways then I am more than 
happy about that. But, if things continue as they have, I will not be 
letting up. Risc did many things in the past and present that I will 
not forget.
<|Eternal|> the past i know of..what are you talking about in the present 
?
<Lester> Risc should consider looking at their traders..Kruzin restarted 
a file 11 times the other day..
<Lester> present was the wrong word persay..recent past..
<Lester> presently all risc is doing is placing members on probation, 
which is your own business and not mine. and having some lame traders 
pulling stupid stuff like that
<|Eternal|> ahh recent past
<|Eternal|> mostly people who we havent seen in months or longer
<|Eternal|> it's more of an idle list than probation
<Lester> dunno..how it was worded to us outsiders didn't sound like 
that..but again, it's your guys business to do as you please

-----------[The Scene News]-----------

All the news thats fit to print... 
and then some...


-Yeah.. the movie deal MGM is still on, except Brad Pitt is gonna play
 me, i guess.. Word on the street is that Lester is gonna play a bit part,
 except he will not be playing himself, he'll be playing mossyoak.. And
 he will be anally raped quit profusely, but hey, everyone gets their 15
 minutes of (excruciately painful) pain. 

-Prozac's page has moved to: http://oldschool.io.com/ppgr. Be there or 
 be hexagonal.

-ftp> site kick Kruzin
 200 1 PID's killed (Kruzin) killed
 ftp> site udel Kruzin
 200 User 'Kruzin' removed.
 <somedude> good fucking bye cheater
 And so ends Kruzin's career on yet ANOTHER site. He has now been removed
 from FS, STH, VDR, and most recently: MW. The exceptional case with MW
 is that it is RiSE HQ.. And kruzin is a RiSE trader, but you BET they 
 aren't gonna re-add the dude...

-Apparently TFA (the flaming arrows) were brought onto the site MNS to
 "make it faster".. They ended up stealing the affil from MnM, who simply
 couldn't compete against the mighty trading powers of TFA <g>. Needless
 to say, union and sitez were less than happy. Union ended up being removed
 from TFAiSO, and the site is now in the hands of TFA.. I'm sure this isn't
 the last we hear about this. ;p

-There was a curry race on TG, and RiSC won the affil. This is the first
 US site that they have had since that whole episode where Eternal narked
 TCD out because it was providing too much competition to TRS... In any
 case, TRS was the last US site that RiSC had... good luck TG, a word of
 advice tho: watch your fucking backs.. ;p

-Moonshine Vision is back. A top euro site before it went down this summer,
 MSV is now PRM HQ, and BLZ WHQ.. 

-group moves: powertool to RiSE, timmyg to iCT, xfrog to CORP, rz3 to DMS, 
 lethal to iND, _-zeus-_ + exhume form MAVerick Games, aldog didn't go to
 PRM, and Jordan retires. Long live the greatest ever. 

-Sodom is back? wtf? Phear, they are promising to "Sodomize the competition"
 i can't wait...  ;p

-HAHAHAHAHAHAH! Lethal didn't pass his trial at DEV.. I guess that means
 RiSC will have to pick him up... Or maybe not, as that would seem to go
 against the new policy that Eternal has come up with:
 <Kruzin> here's Eternal's *philosophy*
 <Kruzin> if we can get a bunch of mediocre couriers
 <Kruzin> we can be a top group
 <Kruzin> which is true
 <Kruzin> megs here and there
 <Kruzin> adds up
 <Kruzin> :)

-So VANTMAS is a big fat lying thief. Dude pretended he was a cracker so that
 he could get onto PFT's pre shell. Then he leeched the thing dry and bolted.
 Classy. Very classy. Now, PFT should have known better than to trust him, i
 guess. Still, what a FUCKING LAME THING TO DO.

-would someone please sign grad(e)? he has been a free agent for a damn long 
 time now. Come one, people.. he has a family to feed, i'm sure someone 
 out there has room under the salary cap..

-RAY kicked glen from the site, (even tho he was in the alltop), however 
 RAY was Blizzard WHQ at the time, and glen was a blz trader. Needless to
 say, RAY has been demoted, and MSV is now blizz WHQ.. 

-And finally, my question:

 <FBot> [FLASH] -ISO- (cueball/DVNiSO) BC.New.Choices.Cookbook-KC
 
 Shouldn't RiSCISO have been releasing this??

--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors, we all love them even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us. And these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, your name will not be included, but we
do not add rumors like that say "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion"
because we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore
there is no hard evidence of that rumor, so if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!


-Rumor has it that Biggy is gonna be kicked from DEV pretty quick.

-Rumor has it that a certain US site is gonna have its lines upgraded
 to OC48 next month.. The link is already pretty fast, will be interesting
 to see what happens.

-Rumor has it that there were talks between VGN and RiSC to merge together.
 The deal later fell through tho, and there are no current plans for either
 group to reform. 

-Rumor has it that someone on our "Top 10 Alltime Traders" list (and now 
 recently retired) has cheated for his whole career. We could have printed
 a huge story about it, but we thought we would let it be, and not ruin
 his retirement. If we'd known this 3 weeks ago, we wouldn't have included
 him... A word to him tho: don't plan on coming back to trade in the scene, 
 or the story runs... you know who you are.
