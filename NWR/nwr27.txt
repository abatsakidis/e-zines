    Well ND is a clown, he left out the death.txt that went along with 
    the AMN profile, removing a large chunk of the history, we will 
    include it in this issue to just show you people it. I am also 
    rushing this because ND is a bitch. I won't say much else here 
    other than that Powertool is a fucking idiot.


                                       -Lester [Co-Editor/Head Writer]



        Its beginning to feel a lot like christmas...

    Well.. I guess next week will be our big XMAS issue...
    I'll be writing from beautiful Prince Edward Island in Canada,
    so... lets hope to god they have the internet there.. ;p

        While we are on the holiday subject, let me just say
    that a channel that i think is a GREAT idea is now open for 
    business: #SiEGEXMAS... They will be offering all 400 of this
    years releases between now and Christmas via xdcc offer bot... 
    Good work, SiEGE!!

        We are damn lucky this week, because we got the (seriously)
    legendary Prozac on board with NWR now, writing a Kind of 
    Biased Games Report. Nice work, to him..
        Bud is back again, with a nice utils report, and we have 
    a new guy, alkivar, doing "the scene's biggest idiots", and
    a nice commented log on the 1000th TRPS release.. ;>

        We have THREE pictures this week.. The first was taken
    in alkivar's home in suburban Los Angeles, and is a picture
    of mgd... (thats MGD on the top, btw..) Its called 
    "manwithhugecock1.jpg"
        The second was taken a small farm in Toronto, and is a 
    pic of STiX.. its called "manwithhugecock2.jpg"
        And just to round things out, we got such a huge response
    from people wanting to see another pic of JESS, that tdpriest
    actually FLEW to omaha, NB, and had a little photo session
    with her... that pic is called "cisco-jesspic2.jpg".... (faces 
    not shown to protect the guilty)   
        And we also have a really bizaare log in which barnil
    and gollie get married... hooray!

         I rushed Lester on his reports etc this week, so if they
    suck, its my fault... mostly.. Anyways, report had to come
    out today, and it will prob be late next week, so don't bug
    lester about where the fuck it is.. and i won't be online
    until late in the week, so.. deal with it.. ;p
        And finally, a lot of ppl have been asking why NWR has
    been getting so big lately... the answer: i am such a lame
    trader that these are the only megs i ever get to up to sites
    like FS, etc... BAHAHAHAHA!

-----------[ ndetroit's sites and stats section ]-----------


    I guess you could say that the US scene is no longer
  dead, eh?
    With sites like IC and TOS (both affilled with Siege,
  Devotion, and Class), TV, and a certain site sequal site
  whose nonsensical name shall remain unsaid, (BAHAH, bonus
  points if you know wtf i am talking about!) the US scene
  is finally beginning to return to the same level as the
  days of The Corner Deli, The Rising Sun, and Dreamland.

    Speaking of which..... ...... i heard DL was... ?

    New US site: Biohazard: 2xT1, 120Gigs, Razor, KAC,
  Rockforce(who?), MnM, and RiSCISO among others.. Now if 
  we could only get RiSC and VGN to return to the US as 
  DMS and DEV have done, we might have a bit of competition
  on our hands.. ;) 

  Apparently its Hardware problems that are keeping DF down.
  
  Covert Operations is another new US site, affils to be named.
  I say new, because even tho they are claiming its the "Return
  of the Old CO", how much of a return can it be with a new
  daemon, new userfile, new siteops, and new affils?
  While we are at it, FUBAR is supposed to be coming back..
  I think it was risc/dod/rzr with it went down...
    
    Not sure what is up with MPOWER, as i haven't heard much
  from it lately, but another very oldschool site is... ermm
  up... and... hehe.. well, i'm not allowed to say much more
  than that, other than it was in the x3 row when it when down,
  and there are a lot of people who are  VERY DAMN READY  for 
  it to come back... i'll let you figure out the rest, as i'm 
  sure the news of its return will spread very very quickly..

    OK.. so i was wrong last week, (not my fault, sky masterson
  told me), and RAY is NOT MNM WHQ... it is Esprit WHQ.. Tho
  who is to say how long THAT will last.. Apparently it was
  CORP WHQ, but then easy pissed off CORP, so CORP dropped them.
  Easy was then kicked as siteop, but.. easy = ept, so... 
  who knows what RAY will end up with in the end.. :)
    The new MiLLENiUM WHQ is NCT. I don't know a lot about it,
  other than MNM has pledged to make it a fast top5 site...
  I guess we'll see.

        
  
=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. 
	Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... 
heh... fuck off and die..

Lester's Biased Courier Report

Well I've had a couple people tell me I'm building a little bit of a hateclub. 
I should lay low in my ragging for awhile. But I keep saying, well then why 
the fuck would you guys want to read it if I was nice? I must do my readers 
justice! On with the slandering


Dimension: Ownage and a half. Despite the fact that I personally have yet to 
move a file(though I did log into some sites this week), DMS is still 
destroying the competition on any site it sees fit. Disproving Risc's belief 
that E's move was a mistake, as of right now dms is #1-5 on E's weektop for 
the new week, terrible isn't it?

Devotion: Well it was brought to my attention that Jaydee is not officially 
Dev anymore, So devotion is highly fucked in the ass. I have heard that a 
certain number of important people will be fleeing devotion soon if certain 
changes are not made. Even the Garoto lifeboat will not be able to survive 
this tidal wave.

Risc: *cough* Can we say babies?

Millennium: Glen is back! They are saved! CO is backup, despite the lack of 
stats/staff/affils of the original CO! MNM is so fucking good I can't stand it.

AOD: Morbid and Siim are elite man. I dunno anyone else in that group offhand 
though. But good job to them 2..:)

TFA: Pftping sluts, banned from sites..laf

Some other group msged me about not being included..i can't remember who 
the fuck..

VGN: Laugh


That'll do it friends, it's rushed as i've stated before..ND is a whiny 
bitch..peace out

Prozac's Kind of Biased Gaming Report

If you remember the RCN days, I use to write reports for them. At first it
was courier reports, then I got involved big time into games and started
writing reports about games. My passion use to be couriering, but now it's
the gaming scene. I eat, drink breath games, and love the competition in it.
If you have no idea who I am, I'm with Class at this very moment. I joined the
day they started on Jan. 1st, 1997, and will probably be there to the end. I
had been wanting to get back to writing a weekly gaming report like I did in
RCN, but I didn't know where to go to. I picked up NWR issue #26, and boom, I
decide I wanted to bring back my report. So here I am. Now starting NWR #27, a
weekly report will be coming from me about the games groups during the weeks.
The fall rush is slowing down, so for now expect to see a couple games a week,
but that doesn't mean the games groups won't be around trying to get what they
can get out to the scene.

My weekly report will include what important releases came from each group,
and some commentary about each group. If you don't like what I'm talking about,
bitch to me on IRC or tell me in your next release NFO.

Class- A couple small titles has come out from Class, nothing exceptional,
but they get the job done. Expect the usual so-so titles to come out from Class
in the next coming weeks, with the usual one or two great titles per month.
It might not be pretty over the next coming weeks, but they get do get the
games out on a regular basis. Also, with Miramax & Devil around, expect quite
a few trainers & cracked patches to be coming in the next couple weeks.

Hot Releases:
Top Gun:Hornet's Nest - 38 disks
Trophy Buck - 20 disks

Paradigm- Now that I have my own report, I can truely say this. What PDM
did on tuesday was ultra-lame. I talked to OFD personally. Ubisoft is
based in frog land. He got the box copy there. When OGN duped CLS on
Motormash, other groups collaberated to stand behind CLS and nuked it.
The other groups should stand behind CLS on S.C.A.R.S., since it was a
Frog final. Please PDM, stick to non-working board games (Scotland Yards).

<gogolie> well both of pdms releases in december are gay, SCARS FINAL
(your guys was final) and X-Games Pro Boarder (obvious ISO rip and non
working crack, no fix)

The US store team is obviously back with the smash titles Uprising 2 & Falcon
4.0. And the EA connection comes through with Recoil. A surprise aussie EA game
also came from PDM, AFL 99. The euro side of PDM also comes through with a
cool title called Skullcaps. This week has actually been decent for PDM, but
things might slow down for PDM when Drizzt goes on vacation.

Hot Releases:
Gangsters Fix - 1 disk
Uprising 2 - 49 disks
AFL 99 - 40 disks
Recoil - 41 disks
Falcon 4.0 - 48 disks
Skullcaps - 19 disks

Razor-Except for Thunder Brigade last week, it's been pretty quite from the
blade. Even after getting some new suppliers, it's been the same 'ol trickle
coming from RZR. Are they going back to there old ways even after The Punisher
came back as the leader? We'll see in the forthcoming weeks.

Hot Releases:
N/A

Origin- The UK crew is back, and will be swinging on more titles the next
couple weeks. The US store team also came through, and they keep saying
things will be a lot better, but the scene is full of talk. Hey OGN, talk
the talk with putting out releases, not saying your going to put out releases
in the future.

Hot Releases:
Pinky and the Brain World Conquest - 46 disks + Fix
Ultrafighters - 37 disks
Football Masters 99 - 11 disks

Divine- Wow, they just came out of left field. This usually dead group comes
out with a huge game for the month of December, Abe's Exoddus (Oddworld 2).
Let's see if this is just fluke, or if they can keep it up for the rest of
the month. There's one major prob. The game is 1M over the limit. But I don't
think anyone will really care.
Hot Releases:
Abe's Exoddus - 50 disks

Also should note that Backlash came out with a real good game (Excessive Speed
- 37 disks), thanks to now Ex-HBD, Hoson. This just shows to the scene HYBRiD
has died, now that HBD's two main suppliers, Hoson & Mad Turnip has jumped
to different groups.

Last minute comments:
In the beginning of December, Origin came out storming with four games in three
days, showing that the holiday rush has hit the UK. They also managed to get a
top game of the month, Thief. Then CLS came back at the end of the week with 4
games. PDM and RZR also put out a game to show they're around and bout. This
week PDM has fixed OGN's fuck up of Gangsters (which had "Postal" protection
where you basically couldn't do anything because of protection when you started
the game). The rest of the week was your normal bullshit, but PDM managed
to put out quite a few  games. OGN has cooled down lately. DVN & BLH topped it
off by putting out there one game a month. Next week should be intersting, to
say the least.

Bud's Biased Utils Report #2 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            
OMG here it is for the second week in a row... some changes to the format this week.
Groups that haven't released aren't going to get a review, unless they do something
outrageously stupid in regards to another area so I can have some fun. I'm also
adding my QOTW (Quote of the Week) section... these can be in response to my report,
or just something really stupid I've come across that I feel should be paraded about =)

Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail & message's
            bitching about this or that. If you don't like it... SCREW YOU =]

Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of releases, but QUALITY
          titles will give a group a much higher score. Nukes for duping, broken releases and
          just plain CRAP will lower a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is
          nuked which I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE. Cuz I'm
          writing this. Groups can also get points for any other reason I see fit.

Week: Week is based from 12/06/98 to 12/12/98. I'm in EST time zone so dates/times run 
      according to it.

Groups: (In no particular order)


PIRATES WITH ATTITUDE:

PWA started the week off with SpecBuilder 3.3... and then basically stalled. Now PWA's not 
exactly known for mass releasing, but they're going to have to release more than this to stay 
amongst the top groups week to week.
Total: 6/10 


THE CORPORATION: 

Well Corp let me down this week... after giving them credit for Director 7 it turns out to
be Beta3. Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to test it till after I passed in last weeks
report.  Set your clock ahead a month and it expires, with a "This Pre-release copy has expired"
message. So you can't even use it as a beta! (There were other signs as well, version 7.0r190, 
and the readme.html). And on top of all this their "FINAL" could have been a lot smaller... the
Corp version is 11 2.88MB disks.. 10 * 1.44MB is what I got it to compress to in my test, 
where I used rar (same as corp) with multimedia compression at max. Again Corp "forgot" max 
compression. Honestly guys, is the -m5 flag REALLY that fuckin' difficult? They've done this
before and wound up repacking, so Corp should have learnt its lesson by now. Needless to 
say I was very disappointed when I downloaded D7, and I'm knocking 2 points off Corp this week 
for a really bad job on that release.

Now on to this weeks releases from Corp... Corp put out some of the Veribest 99 series, I
haven't tried either of the releases myself but so far no one's made any complaints. Not
much to be said about ProtoShare Broker Edition... Highlight of the week was MS SQL Server
Enterprise Edition... Corp would have had a much better score if not for loosing 2 points.
Total: 6/10


RISE: 

Rise got back into it this week starting with a couple releases at the beginning of the week.
Unfortunately one was a repack but the apology from "A sad RiSE Staffer" earns their salvation.
They broke out a couple of nice cracks of Materialise programs =) The leadership in RISE is 
excellent, so its great to see them do some titles this week. More mainstream utils would be a 
nice change though.
Total: 7/10


SIEGE: 

The SGE team picks up where it left off last week by releasing WiseCAD on monday, and kept rockin
by releasing Kai's Power Tools 5, and excellent title from Metatools. This tool is arguably
the best util this week, and undoubtedly one of the most popular, although it's limited
to PhotoShop and Painter 5.5 users. They also picked up on Corp's failure and rocked out
Director 7, beating out several other groups in the process. Taking the two top releases this week gives
SGE a 9!
Total: 9/10 


X-FORCE:

XF hasn't done much again this week. MS Publisher 2000 beta2, but it would be nice to see more
releases outta these guys, other than just betas. Other releases include Ultimate Toolbox 
for MFC December... which if you hadn't noticed is released by them twice a month (1st & 2nd 
edition) so it doesn't even register on me anymore. Highlight of the week for XF was Rayflect
Phototracer. They also did a linux proggie which I won't take into consideration. This
will hold true for any group as I don't run linux. So what else about XF can be said? Well...
*** Now talking in #x-force
*** Topic is '--X-FORCE DOMINATING THE WORLD AS USUAL--'
Dominating what exactly.... Beta's? Idling? See ya next week.
Total: 6/10 


SHOCK: 

Well despite a fucked up rumor in NWR #26 last week, Shock isn't planning on banning LND
on any sites, and I have no idea where that rumor came from. They did benefit from LND
getting nuked for stealing though, and the releases in question (Informix titles) went
out under the proper group. On top of this, some Roguewave development tools for C++
made a good start on Sunday. They seemed to stall in the middle of the week, but picked up on
Thursday by releasing Java Embedded Server from Sun Microsystems & some other apps. SHK finished
the week with some titles from the ObjectStore series by Object Design.
Total: 7/10 


ENTITY: 

Well I said ENT was far from out of it last week, but I might have to take it back. 
On top of loosing MGD and other members to Corp over the past month or so, Hazzy has retired. 
They are still getting the releases out though, and that's what counts. These guys seem to have 
a bit of a packaging problem of late - their NFO's give almost no information on the programs 
released. The Bytecode and Sourcecode editions of JClass Enterprise Suite have identical 
descriptions aside from the name, although there's a huge size difference between the two. 
(Bytecode contains the actual apps, but not everyone is going to know this). Their NFO for Lotus
DevPack 1.5 In Action gives a short paragraph taken from the Lotus website - only it's the 
description for the normal DevPack, and doesn't mention a thing about differences found in the
In Action copy. They got more bad news near the end of the week as Dthangel left the group
and MDK, their EHQ, dropped them. This apparently occurred due to some comments Hazzy (hey
isn't he retired anyways??) made. They did get quite a few big releases out however,
but next week is not looking so great for Entity. 
Total: 7/10


PENTIUM FORCE TEAM:

PFT drop out of 1st place this week, but still did some nice releases, including SolidView 3.3,
NetObjects Script Builder, and a preview (ick!) of NetObjects Fusion 4. Not a whole lot to 
say here.. a few good utils and a repacked English version of a messed up TFT multilanguage util,
and a bunch of average titles. Not enough to hold top spot but still good... hrmm that's about
all I have to say here I guess, though Seagate Manage Exec is nice just cuz I like Seagate. =) 
Total: 7/10 


LEGENDS NEVER DIE:

No comment. 
Fuck but then this would be much too short... well lets see... a fix for CabinetVision Solid 
started the week for LND. Actual releases this week started with products from Ciscoworks and
a minor version of CimatronIt. They also beat all other groups to ripping the Adobe Premier 
5.1 ISO. A couple other releases rounded out the week which I didn't really check out do to 
exams on my part, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on those. They finished the week
much like they started it - one of their last releases was a fix.
Total: 5/10


PINNACLE:

Hello? HELLO???!!?? No answer :P
Total: N/A 


DRINK OR DIE:

Well DOD has pretty much owned Command Antivirus, and they released a new version of
it this week... AuraLine v1.6 was a much nicer title, unfortunately that's all we saw from
DOD in the past 7 days. 
Total:6/10 


MANIFEST DESTINY

Would the real MFD please step forwards? Manifest always seems to be a little confused as
to wether they're going to be a crack group or a utils group. But its pretty much
worked out for the better. They were a dominating force on the crack side of things, and
some Sierra products got them onto the utils list. A couple Midisoft proggies were decent
as well. Switching to FS from STH hasn't phased them (kinda like going from coke to pepsi), 
and they picked up MG. Good work MFD! Only question that remains is if they can step up the 
utils releasing and be a real force.
Total:7/10


HERITAGE:

More nukes really hurt HTG again this week, and they only got out 2 legit releases this
week. Rumor has it they wanted a merge with Entity but were declined.
Total:4/10 


REBELS:

Uh-oh... one of RBS's first offerings this week looked nice: 
Microsoft.Visual.Basic_6.0_Professional-RBS, until, that is, you realize that it was included 
in Entity's earlier release, MICROSOFT.VISUAL.STUDIO.v6.0.PRO.EDITION.FINAL-ENTiTY, which 
included some other great features on top of VB 6 Pro. They did do a lot of cracks this week 
however, and can be given  credit for a couple larger apps. 
Total:7/10 

TRPS:

Well after some criticism for not including these guys, and considering that I decided
to include MFD, I've added them in. I'm not going to consider the slew of small regged
and cracked minor updates of programs a lot of people don't want anyway, instead I'll look at
what they released on top of it (those releases are more comparable to those of cracking groups
which I said I'll keep out of the report due to time/size restraints). The utils this week
for TRPS were highlighted by NetManage Support Now 2.1 Client&Server... also Config
Pro plus. CWS apparently ranked TRPS high due to # of releases, since I look at quality
first and foremost I can't quite agree there. TRPS also celebrated their 1000th release
recently, so congrats to them. (It needed a fix though :P)
Total: 6/10

New this week: Manifest Destiny & TRPS are new additions this week.

Idle this week: Pinnacle

Quote of the Week: <Ryan1-> oh yea and youre ugly
                   <Ryan1-> you even talk like a wannabe 


Siege took top slot again this week with a solid week of releasing and some very nice titles. 
Next week will determine if I keep MFD & TRPS on the list. Premiere's rumored return to the 
utils scene should be interesting, we'll have to see whether old members return to the flock - 
this could hurt many of the groups which benefited from their earlier demise. It will also be 
interesting to see the type of PRM this time round, hopefully the quality problems
of the last incarnation will not be seen again. This of course depends on if the heavily
rumored reformation even takes place - although PRM leader Fusion has been about, and
#premiere has once again become populated. Their return(?) is yet another entry into the 
crowded utils field, so don't be surprised if at least one of the groups reviewed this week 
makes its exit within the next few months. Well that's about it for this week. Any errors
in the above I blame on my exams, so don't bitch too much cuz I'm in a bad enough mood
already ;)

--------------[1000th TRPS Release!]--------------

  Well.. This is a log that was given to us by ALKIVAR, of DMS, UCF, 
APC, and TRPS (not for long?) hehe.. We were originally going to just
put it in the nwr.zip, but it was so funny, that we had to stick it in
the mag... apologies for the SIZE of all this, but it really is is 
funny.. 
  Now, we all know alkivar is a bastard, but to be fair to him, he had
been drinking VERY heavily at the time of this log, so... NWR would 
also like to point out that no matter how shitty their 1000th release
was, 1000 releases is still a good accomplishment in this day and age,
so congrats to TRPS..
  Too bad #1000 was such a shitter! BAHAHAHAHA!
  And now, the rest of this is Alkivar:

=---------[ Lesters Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 


Seeing as how ND is being a whiny bitch, I am forced to do all this in the 
next 10 minutes or so. So if you think anything I did this week sucks. 
It's HIS fault.


Very Bad Things
Starring: Christian Slater, Jon Favreau, Cameron Diaz and other peopz
Rating: 3 and 1/2 / out of 4 stars


I finally got around to seeing this film and I'm glad I did. This is 
Slater at his best, psychotic and over the top. We havent' had a movie 
that fully utilized Slater's acting ability in awhile, and so it's good 
to see him back. I must say he's one of my favorite actors from his older 
movies like Kuffs, Gleaming the Cube, Pump up the Volume, and even newer 
ones like Bed of Roses and shit like that. Oh can't forget True Romance 
either:). But enough about him, the whole movie is a solid cast. You know 
all the people from other movies of course. And the action that ensues is 
quite good. They play off of each other well and mesh together nicely. 
It all starts with a bachelor party gone terribly awry. Stripper dies in 
a freak accident and they decide to cover it up, and shit keeps piling up. 
Slater is the one to watch in all of this, but the others are good 
performances as well. I'd suggest checking this out if your into demented 
comedy.

^^^^^ Pick of the Week ^^^^^

Rugrats
Starring: Who the fuck knows?
Rating: If your a little kid? 4/4. if your 19 and bored shitless? 2/4


Well, out of boredom and lack of options, I decided to check out this flick. 
Surprisingly it was not too bad overall, if you look at it subjectively, 
I know little kids would love it. When I was at the point where I was 
saying I think I'm gonna leave, it ended, so I didn't have to walk out. 
But if you have little kids or you like the tv show, check it out for 
some decent fun. Though I'd suggest Antz/Bugs Life before this if you need 
to relive your childhood.

Star Trek Insurrection
Starring: Patrick Stewart and all those trekkie people
Rating: 3 out of 4

Well I have never been a big Star Trek fan, I've always been a Star Wars 
devotee. But I have started watching them since Generations, and they 
aren't so bad, this one being the best of the 3 I've recently seen. 
I mean we all know Voyager the TV show owns if nothing else but for 
7of9 in that tight ass outfit that has caused her asphixyation. But 
unfortunately she is not in this movie. None the less, the action flows 
well and it doesn't seem like the same old story or anything, you have 
to give the creators credit for coming up with new storylines all the 
time:) If your a trekkie, you already saw it, but if you are a closet 
trekkie, go see it, it's good.

 i am, eh? BAHAHAHAH! male, female? who *is* sky masterson? ;p

<glen>   hrmm.. who is Sky Masterson? 
<_TecH_> Everyone is asking. Some think he is a she and some a he?
<glen>   make sure that "it" knows i am in mnm, mossyoak is not a 
         joke and mnm isnt dead

<Pyro403> hehe
<Pyro403> yea I read both NWR and CWS
<Pyro403> dude is a good writer<
<Pyro403> he's funny

-And on that note: Congrats to GLEN, who managed to stay with 
 MiLLENiUM for a WHOLE WEEK... ;p  

-i guess SEMAJ couldn't take the heat, as he bolted from the 
 sinking ship that we all like to call CORP.. probably a good idea.

-Here's a little piece of news a disgruntled member of the cracking scene
 sent me: TRPS says they CARD software that is only uncrackable and to 
 take the load off of their crackers, they "demonstrated" this when 
 they carded Web Racer, and TNO released the cracked version 20 minutes 
 later... But then... it wasn't really TRPS's week, was it???
 btw.. congrats on your 1000th, guys... <g>

-ever been to www.avault.com?? Of course you have.. what is this i see?
 http://www.avault.com/cheat/dl_ognactrn.asp
 Why.. its a major "legitimite" commercial website offering
 trainers from OGN, RZR, etc, without paying any credit or royalties...
 Hrmm... this might be a job for the Origin Legal Team!

-Mason isn't sick any more, and M8 have a new USHQ, "ATA"..

-QSR, one of the most shortlived groups out there is now officially
 disbanded. They had a meeting this afternoon to announce it, but
 only 4 former-members bothered to show up.. BAHAHAHAHA.
 While we are on the subject, they did NOT merge with MnM.. MnM
 got 4 or 5 members, and a couple of shellboxes, because
 lord knows MnM needs shellboxes, what with all those active curries
 they have... 

-group moves: semaj quit corp, dthangel is now known as [ben],
 tho he will trade as "dthangel" for DMS (wtf?), plush didn't
 join RTS last week (just seeing if you were awake), bigrar to
 MnM, and toth to ???, and everyone quit QSR.

-BigRAR applied to join RiSC, but at the last moment changed
 his mind, and went with the ever more prestigious MnM..

-dasker/EPT is about the shittiest courier i have ever seen.
 If i had a pre for every fucked-up dir or PFTP mistake that
 dude has made, i would be weektopping firesite.. ;p

-someone broke into ndt's house the other day, but he scared them
 away.. if it was you, you'd better be careful, cause in his own
 words he's gonna "fuck you up, you muthafuckin cocksucking whore"

-ok.. i admit it.. i was wrong last week.. MnM's WHQ is NOT RAY..
 RAY = shitty ept site with no good affils... MnM's WHQ is actually
 NoCTurne....  NCT = shitty MnM site with no good affils...

-KAC seems to be on a bit of a roll with 25 releases in the past
 2 days, and picking up the nice US site, TMS as their new WHQ..
 

-So HAZZY is such a smarty-pants that he managed to get ENTitity
 dropped from MDK.. Seems he was badmouthing the site to dthangel,
 going on about how duranged and geemoney were "a bunch of little
 kids" (a debateable point, to say the least), so MDK dropped
 ENT.. Now the question is.. who will they take? CORP? BAHAHAHAH!

-the Cellar (SLR) a US site has dropped OGN, because OGN didn't
 pre to them.. 

-LND rips ISO's.. There are several concerned members of the utils
 scene who wanted nd to make a mention of this.. Of course, all
 i have to say is: WHO THE FUCK CARES? blah, blah, blah.. i know,
 blah, ripping it off, blah, stealing, blah... uhh.. wtf? THIS
 IS PIRACY, FOR GODS SAKES...  ;]

-Future Couriers (you ever heard of them?) may just become the
 next plucking ground for groups like DMS, AoD, or (gasp!) MnM..
 They have some good curries..... of course, that has never really
 factored into MnM's recruiting anyway.... BAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!

-MAGNUM finally got a cracker... Thank god! FLUKE wasn't already
 pumping out enough shitty unworking freeware releases.. *whew*,
 its a good thing that MAGNUM will finally be able to compete with
 them in that category... ;p

-And finally, all i have left to say is:
 "Rugrats.Movie.Activity.Challenge-RiSCiSO"

 Another quality RiSCISO release....

--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors, we all love them even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us. And these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, your name will not be included, but we
do not add rumors like that say "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion"
because we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore
there is no hard evidence of that rumor, so if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!


-Rumor has it that members of RiSC with useradd on RAY deleted all
 of morbid's(AoD) IPs from the site earlier this week, so that he 
 couldn't beat RiSC on the site...

-Rumor has it that 2 oldschool sites are coming back.. One is already
 up and adding curries... the other "cartoonish orchestra" site debating 
 a return set for 2 weeks from now... Anyone have any guesses? ;)

-Rumor has it that MANDRAKE is FINALLY BACK... hell, thats not a rumor,
 its true! (hi mandy!)... the rumors of course abound as to WHERE'S GEORGE,
 his AUSSIE LOVER?? could it be true that couriering has finally driven
 MANDRAKE to separate from GEORGE? True Love with the man he was destined
 to be with, or Immortal adulation from the currying scene... which will
 MANDRAKE choose??
