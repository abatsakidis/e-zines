Well, well, well. After all this talk of publishing the death of our esteemed co-editor, he has returned as suddenly as he left. We'll see how long he sticks around this time. But it certainly gives us more news to report and shit since I never know what to write. The issue is not jam packed this week because Blitz and Ryche are both missing. Also no stats as no one got me any weektops this week. Bud makes up for everyone else's slacking by putting in the biggest report of his career and also probably the best or definately one of the best he has done. Good job to Bud and look forward to more interviews next week. 
We will also be having a new addition to the NWR team, you all may be familiar with the iso charts that are published every month on isonews.com. Well those charts are now being written solely for NWR and we were supposed to have September's chart in here to start it off, but the writer and I missed each other so we'll publish it next week and every month thereafter. So look forward to a nice new section in NWR.


Lester[ Co-Editor ]

Hello.
  Many of you have been wondering where i have been for the past
  several issues. The answer is that i have been drunk for 7 weeks
  straight.
  Now i am going to go sleep off my hangover.

  But first, i'll type up my intro..

  Thanks to lester (and ryche!) who kicked some major ass while i 
  was gone. I think that they proved quite succinctly that I am in
  no way needed to turn out a quality issue of the Netmonkey Weekly
  Report, and my hat goes off to them.
  Also: good work to bud, who passed the 30 issue mark (yay!), and
  to blitz, who (as always) wrote some interesting and informative
  pieces. 
 
  Many of you who know me well remember that i disappeared for no
  reason for the exact same time last year, as well.. I don't know
  why that is. I will try not to disappear for another year.
  Thanks to everyone who welcomed me back..

  I'll see you all soon..
  
  Take care.

-----------[ ndetroit's sites and stats section ]-----------

Hey... i'm back... ugghhh.. what a hangover..
  Sites! Sites! Sites!
  
  Well.. i hate to say it, but STH, one of the best sites of alltime, 
  has been narked this week. Check out the news section later to see
  who the nark was!
  At the time of its demise, STH was CLASS and PWA affilled.. very 
  very respectible.. STH's siteops have faced this kind of adversity
  before, and its my bet that you won't be able to keep them down for
  long... good luck guys!

  E is back up. Godbless passed mgd there for 2nd alltime, so mgd can't
  do any more of his l33to taglines that cut down bizzy.. or he can, but
  they just all point to godbless now.
  Also, Clubber installed a new daemon, and fucked with shit, so that it
  looks like he upped 2 gigs in 1 week, wiping bizzy's old weektop record
  right out..... ACK!   ;)

  Grad is once again #1 on ET, now that they have deleted garoto...

  MG is back up.
  TOS is back up. (like a month ago)  ;p

  I've been kinda idle, but i'd have to say that my top sites are now
  FS, E, CAT, and ... HOG?.. i dunno.. 

  No stats this week... Sketch+tech are MIA.. Does anyone wanna step up
  and do a stats section for us???
  Thanks glen for help with the news this week!!!

	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. 
	Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... 
heh... fuck off and die..

-----------[ Your Name Here's Biased Courier Section ]-----------

Sigh, I guess it's me again folks.

Amnesia:  AMN makes some headlines this week by picking up a few people, most namely Sins from AOD. Alot of contraversy around this but I don't see what the big deal is. Cardiel was active on sites and Sins as well, majority of his week is credited to AOD though.
Rating: 4/10 (Looking a little better)

AOD: AOD loses Sins to AMN as mentioned above, rumors are abound of numerous other AOD people planning to leave to form new groups or for other groups. This group could finally be experiencing the trials and tribulations that all groups go through, are they strong enough to bounce back and maintain the level that they are at now? We will see. This week was WELL below their performance last week, but you can't expect that kind of domination every week. Sins trading and Faith as well as Moonsabre. But not a very strong showing for what they are capable of.
Rating: 6/10 (Troubled times ahead?)

Devotion: Godbless is going strong for Dev again now that Garoto is gone, they have Prozax finally picking it up a little as well as TC pre'ing, but they aren't outright dominating anything, but they probably take #1 spot this week.
Rating: 7 1/2/10 (God Bless you godbless)

Risc: Avalanch is the big bad boy this week, and we also see Borg on some sites, so Risc is back to having 2 guys trading for them. If they could like get 4 or so going for more than 2 weeks at a time they might be able to get something going.
Rating: 5/10 (Avalanch is your savior this week)

Vice: Mrpumpkin and Citizen carrying the load here as we don't see much from Nailz, and Redman is still not trading because of school. Looks like Vice could use some new blood or motivate their current guys a little more. But they maintain a medium level and little rumblings from their traders about anything. So you can't knock them too much.
Rating: 5/10 (Steady)


Well I kind of bullshitted my way through this, so if it's way off, well fuck you. Cya next week

 Bud's Biased Utils Report #36
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 Hey, I did something this week... I got off my ass! On top of that feat I 
 managed to pull together as much info I could on GLOBETrotter's reaction
 to Rebel's FlexGen license generator for FlexLM. For those of you not
 familar with GT, it's the company behind the FlexLM licensing scheme, a popular
 protection method for CAD/CAM, engineering, and other high-priced apps.

 FlexLM offers a wide variety of licensing features, which has enhanced
 it's popularity. It was also a fairly difficult scheme to crack due to
 the complexity of the licenses involved. Now I'm not much of a cracker
 so I won't get into it any further, suffice to say GLOBETrotter had a
 pretty nice product going. Then along came Rebels, who several months
 back released FlexGen, a universal license generator that would generate
 a license for virtually any FlexLM protected application. This was obviously
 a big blow to GT, and since the initial release Rebels has continued to
 improve on FlexGen. Things really heated up only this past month, however,
 as word of the license generator hit the mainstream press. Officially,
 GLOBETrotter has been silent on the FlexGen issue. But you know, I'm not
 one for "Official" statements and standpoints, they tend to be fairly boring.
 So this week I've included a *brief* interview done via email with a
 GLOBETrotter rep, as well as the official email sent to FlexLM customers
 regarding the comprmising of the protection scheme.

 So what else... well like I said, I got off my ass. So this week also
 includes... <drum roll please>... an interview with one of the leaders
 of the RiSE comeback! In case you hadn't noticed, RiSE is back after
 disbanding a few months ago, and the first impression seems to be that
 they are as strong as ever.

 As for the rest of this issue... well it's chock full of the usual schlock,
 so enjoy!
  
 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 09/28/99 to 10/04/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.

 PIRATES WITH ATTITUDE:

 Releases: 

 CimLogic.Toolbox.Se.For.SolidWorks99.v5.3-PWA

 Not much... Special edition of CimLogic for SolidWorks. At the end of
 this week, it seems PWA lost a fair number of people to Scum... supposedly
 much of the power it gained from the many ex-SGE people it picked up.
 Time will tell, but this week was dull release-wise.

 PWA aren't the only group with member problems this week. With
 RiSE back, Corp lost a few people as well. And had a slow week to
 show it. Remember last weeks Corp log in NWR?

 BENTLEY_REPROGRAPHICS_V7.00.110.16_FOR_MICROSTATION_SE_95-XFORCE

 With a ton of idle groups this week, XF decided to get busy. They put
 out a half decent WinAMP clone in BPM Studio (the interface is completely
 ripped off) although the program itself does much more than WinAMP ever
 will. XF failed to mention theirs was the Home version however, and missing
 features seen in the Pro. They had a slight mishap with Lotus "QuickSpace"
 however. That is actually Lotus QuickPlace, and a dupe of PWA by almost a
 month. Rest of the stuff is pretty decent. They loose one on the Lotus.

 We also see the first app out of the WebSphere 3 line from IBM,
 expect more to come from various groups.

 left in the dust, and could really use a breakthrough mainstream
 app pretty soon to stay in the contention as a top group.

 LEGENDS NEVER DIE:

 Releases: 

 DELCAM.ARTCAM.PRO.V4.0.FIXED-LND
 SOLID.EDGE.V7.0-LND

 LND do two releases this week... and get 0 points. Why? Well, Rebels
 won on Solid Edge 7 on the majority of my sites. As for ArtCam, this
 is the second release of it from LND. I gave them points for the 
 original, so I won't score this. It's nice that they fixed their
 mistake though (shitty to see the whole thing re-done but this
 fix was a while in the making).

 Solid Edge 7. Ok well it may not be major to Joe Schmoe, but it's still
 pretty nice. RBS managed to beat LND on pretty much every site I bothered
 to check on, so they get the points. As for the rest... Virtual Draft is
 actually Virtual Drafter from SoftSource's VDraft series. The 2.x line
 is AutoCAD 2K compatible. Some other decent apps up there as well, the
 RBS cracking team was fairly busy this week.

 Hyperion.Wired.for.OLAP.v4.1-SCuM
 MODELSIM.v5.3a.Elite.Edition-SCuM
 PVCS.Tracker.v6.5-SCuM

 More news came from SCUM off the sites than on this week, but they
 did manage to put out four titles, including the latest ModelSim.
 Its only been a few weeks since v5.3, so I'm not too sure what's new
 in 5.3a. My next pick would be PVCS Tracker.

 On the group happenings scene talk of SCUM, RiSE, PWA and CORP dominated,
 with the former coming on strong and the latter possibly seeing tough
 times ahead. In SCUM's case, late this week we saw several members from
 PWA leave the pirates to be with scum. This strengthens their CAD/CAM
 side, and would seem to put PWA back to where it was before the demise
 of Siege, as many who left PWA for Scum had been pickups by PWA from the
 defunct SGE.

 TrueSpace upgrade, haven't checked with Caligari to see if there's
 an actual standalone of this version yet.

 Yes, they are back! And a few people probably want to kill me for 
 reminding everyone what RiSE stands for! Well, if you aren't familar
 with RiSE you should be. Over the years, their name came to be almost
 synonymous with what we consider "quality" in warez (meaning their
 shit generally worked). Now, after a brief rest, they're back. Much
 of the old crew seems to be intact... blah blah. I'll save my breath
 and direct you to the interview with Elocin for all the details.
 
 Now on to the releases. RiSE members of course all messaged me asking
 for 10/10's.. shame on you. RiSE did have a very strong week however. 
 Working my way down the list...  CAD Estimator looks like a great
 tool for high-tech contractors. No, honestly, if you work in that
 field it actually sounds pretty helpful. We also see several
 storage/backup apps from StorActive, including some Client/Server
 backup tools. There top apps of the week, however, are Moldflow
 Dynamic 9.5m Steel CAD Detailing Sys. 6.114, and STAAD Pro Design
 Studio v3.1, all which prove RiSE is picking up right where they left
 off.

 New this week: RiSE is BACK! And it still stands for Really Into Spreading Elite!!! <G>

 Idle this week: 

 Quote(s) of the Week: * WillTC- stuffs bud some red peppers in his ass and
                         kicks him on route :)

 <Caserd> fag

 <_Elocin> :~

 Ok look, I was too busy to get good quotes, go read the other NWR quotes :P

 RiSE's strong impression during their first week back earned them a tie
 for top honors with RBS. Why Rebels? Maybe I'm being overly sentimental, 
 but I like RBS, it's nice to see them snagging a top title, and they
 never fully get the credit they deserve. What can I say, it's a BIASED
 report. But RBS did earn it.

 Big news of the week was the return of RiSE. Since the rumors popped up
 a few days ago, everything pointed to s atrong return, and that's what
 took place. Looks like it's more competition for the ailing LND. Next
 interesting news item was a flood of people moving from PWA to SCUM,
 including SJ. Final bit of news was the loss of members from CORP
 to the reborn RiSE, Corp had what, half a dozen members left?

 If you've managed to keep score so far... you have no life! Even
 I'm getting confused with all the moves lately.

 Speaking of keeping score... if you've noticed I haven't done
 my tallies recently (where I score each group with a total to
 date, combining their points from each issue), well, I will do
 one soon, put probably not until about issue 40.


 A brief conversation with GLOBETrotter (Developers of FlexLM)
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Well I had hoped to include this last week to coincide with Rebels most
 recent release of FlexGen, however the company was slow in responding
 to me so... basically this was just a brief chat via email, I sent
 off my "concerns as a potential customer" on a whim, not even expecting
 a reply... officially, media-wise anyways, GLOBETrotter has been
 entirely silent on the license generator issue, and at least in
 every story I've seen on it, they've been "unavailable" for comment.

 _____

 Bud:

 With GLOBETrotter's popular FlexLM licensing system having been
 comprimised by a software piracy group, what assurances do GLOBETrotter 
 customers both present and potential have that FlexLM software will be 
 updated accordingly to prevent the usage of the current "License Generator"?

 GT:

 GLOBEtrotter constantly improves it's products to thwart hackers,
 but motivated people with enough time and compute power will likely
 break any software licensing scheme.  We try to make it more and
 more difficult with every new release.

 Bud: 

 How soon can users expect an update to protect their merchandise?

 GT:

 Vendors who follow our recommendations are not subject to the "license
 generator" attack to which you refer.

 The loophole that was used in the hack that was described in the press
 was closed in FLEXlm v6.1, over a year ago.

 Bud:

 Will GLOBETrotter be taking any steps (both legally and in terms of software
 development) to ensure that future breeches are not possible?

 GT:

 It's not a goal of GLOBEtrotter to make future breeches impossible,
 just to make them more difficult to accomplish, and to make them less
 desireable to undertake in the first place.

 _____

 Aside from the rather clinical replies the GLOBETrotter rep gave me
 (keep in mind he's treating me as a potential customer), there 
 are a few valid points. First, someone with the skill and determination
 will break any given protection scheme - it's just a matter of time.

 The next point is interesting... GT claims that the "loophole"
 allowing FlexGen to work was closed over a year ago... hmmm...
 well this doesn't quite ring true. For one thing, FlexGen supported
 up to v7.0 - until recently. In FlexGen 2000, RBS has removed 7.0
 support due to what they call "strange problems" - basically
 meaning FlexGen doesn't work with 7.0 apps. But it still supports
 FlexLM v6.1 protected apps, which GT claims are not succeptible.

 To finish off... GLOBETrotter's solution seems to be "Upgrade to
 7.0", meaning more money for them, greater expenses to the
 customer... which will likely be passed on to the end user...
 way to go GLOBETrotter, great customer support...
 (what ever happened to the *FREE* upgrade for bug fixes???).


 GLOBETrotters Official Response to its Customers:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Hey wait, we aren't done yet! Here is GLOBETrotter's official statement
 to its customers... 

 -----

 To: FLEXlm-licensees 
 Date: September 10, 1999

 Two publications (ElectronicNews and ESNUG), have had articles 
 regarding a hacker attack on FLEXlm. This email includes the following:

 - The story as reported. 
 - GLOBEtrotter's comments regarding security. 
 - What FLEXlm licensees should do if they are concerned 
   about this hack.

 If you would like to enhance your FLEXlm implementation's resistance to 
 hacker attacks, please attend the FLEXlm Security Presentation at the 
 "Electronic Commerce for Software Conference" on Sep 13-14, at the 
 Santa Clara Convention Center (see www.ec4s.com for details). This 
 topic will also be covered in "FLEXlm Developer Training Classes" (see 
 http://www.globetrotter.com/lmdvtrng.htm )

 Note that the notes from these presentations will NOT be available even 
 to attendees at the conference or the classes.

 The next scheduled classes are:
 - Thursday, September 16, 1999, Westin Santa Clara, Santa Clara, CA 
 - Tuesday, December 7, 1999, Tollhouse,Los Gatos, CA

 THE STORY AS PUBLISHED (SUMMARIZED):
 - A group of hackers has compromised FLEXlm. 
 - The software breach has been posted to an undisclosed Web site that 
   offers free downloads. Another Web site provides tutorials for using 
   the cracked code. 
 - The download allows its users to generate licenses 

 GLOBETROTTER'S STATEMENTS REGARDING THIS HACK:
 The hack referenced in the articles used a hole that was fixed in the 
 March 1998 version of FLEXlm. We increase the security in each product 
 release, and encourage FLEXlm licensees to use the latest release.
 This is one way that FLEXlm can be attacked. However, there are other 
 methods of attack, and while GLOBEtrotter has taken steps to prevent 
 all methods that we are aware of, we can by no means guarantee that 
 hackers will not find other ways to subvert FLEXlm which we are not 
 aware of today. The important thing to remember is that software is 
 not now, never has been, and never can be made impenetrable to hackers' 
 efforts.

 Subverting technologies such as FLEXlm has become a serious crime in 
 the US under various laws including the Digital Millennium Act, and in 
 counties that are part of the World Intellectual Property Organization 
 Copyright Treaty.

 Subverting FLEXlm with hacks may subject one to a fine of up to 
 $1,000,000 or imprisonment for up to 10 years, or both. These fines and 
 penalties apply to those that manufacture, import, offer to the public, 
 provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, 
 device, component, or part for such subversions. In addition, the Act 
 provides for civil penalties.

 The purpose of FLEXlm is to allow software vendors to license software 
 on networks and in ways that better fit how their customers do 
 business. As part of this use it offers a level of software protection 
 consistent with the goal of not hindering honest software use.

 TECHNICAL ACTIONS TO BLOCK THIS HACK:
 This hack utilizes a security hole in the FLEXlm DLL to generate 
 counterfeit licenses. If you've ever shipped a product that uses the 
 FLEXlm Windows DLL, then anyone with access to your product that uses 
 the DLL, and this hack could generate counterfeit licenses. The DLL 
 version of FLEXlm is not secure and probably never will be since the 
 interface to DLLs is inherently insecure.

 FLEXlm v6.1 has a feature, "Phase 2" security, which will create a 
 product that cannot be used with these counterfeit licenses. This 
 requires that you make new licenses and products that are incompatible 
 with existing licenses and products. In October we'll be releasing 
 FLEXlm v7.1 which contains a new KEY2 attribute, allowing you to 
 protect new products against this hack while supporting existing 
 products in the field.

 Unfortunately, while the v7.1 KEY2 attribute will protect new software 
 against "counterfeit" (hacker generated) licenses, old software will 
 continue to operate with these counterfeit licenses. These issues will 
 all be discussed at EC4S in Santa Clara next week.

 So... upgrade or you're screwed. Again GLOBETrotter misses the fact
 that v6.1 is vulnerable, and the problem was NOT fixed in March of
 1998. While v7.0 has partially solved the problem, expect that
 with the continued development of FlexGen by RBS, and possible
 competitive cracks by other groups, that it will eventually be
 comprimised. There is NO uncrackable protection. Software protection
 is based in the software, and thus can be altered. The best software
 protection you can come up with is this: Make a really good product
 that people will WANT to buy, and they will buy it.


 Some Final Quotes from GLOBETrotter:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 We STILL aren't done... yes this is getting tedious... but... here
 are a last few comments, these from a different GLOBETrotter rep.,
 regarding the FlexGen situation. Oh and I added in my rambling
 comments. 

 - "It would be unfair to our customers with support contracts 
   to provide support and/or updates to those that are not on 
   a support contract."

   ^^^ Try fixing your fucking mistakes perhaps. It's not a support issue,
       it's a MAJOR flaw. Any potential fix should be FREE as far as I'm
       concerned.

 - "This also helps avoid providing technical support to hackers."

   ^^^ Too late. Oh and "Hacker" isn't the right term, but nevermind.

 - "Supporting a customer on such matters consumes valuable 
    GLOBEtrotter support staff time."

   ^^^ Glad to see you value your users. This attitude will cause you to
       loose them. BTW, what better issue can you think of the support
       your customers on???


 Well that's finally it. Whether they like it or not, the official silence 
 GLOBETrotter has shown publically is broken (ok I'm being over-dramatic, sue
 me). One thing to keep in mind: In every statement from them provided here, 
 GLOBETrotter is talking with business interests in mind. They can't show
 weakness to their customers, thus "the problem is fixed", "FlexLM 7.1 will
 be even more secure", etc. In response to actual questions, they are
 treating me as an actual customer. So will we ever know exactly how the
 developers over at GT felt upon learning their protection scheme had
 been rape? Probably not... but we can imagine it <g>.

 And now... to take up even more space in NWR and take the record for the
 longest utils report in history... I give you... the RiSE COMEBACK SPECIAL!
 Well actually it's just an interview. I told you I got off my ass this week.


 An Interview with Elocin of RiSE
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Well, some of us expected it, some were taken by suprise, but they rumors were
 floating around and they came through. RiSE has returned to the utils scene,
 and here's a little chat I had with Elocin, one of the main players.

 -----

 <Bud> Those in the utils scene were recently suprised (well some more suprised 
       than others) to see the return of RiSE, making a return after disbanding 
       just a few short months ago.
 <Bud> What brought this resurgance about, and who are the main characters 
       driving the comeback?

 <Elocin> ya, well, me and gza happened to be alive at the same time and we 
          started talking about utils
 <Elocin> and we got this idea to restart RiSE.
 <Elocin> so we came to Slice
 <Elocin> and asked him if we can use the RiSE label.
 <Elocin> and he was like sure and he agreed to back us up.
 <Elocin> (This was like about 2.5 weeks ago approx.)

 <Bud> How much of the old crew has returned? Can we expect to see many of the
       CAD/CAM tools familar to RiSE release users?

 <Elocin> actually a fair amount of the old team has returned
 <Elocin> and just a few days ago
 <Elocin> Syndicate merged into RiSE

 <Bud> Wow... those guys have been kicking around for what seems like forever 
       without really getting all the credit they deserve.

 <Elocin> yeah
 <Elocin> they got a good solid staff.

 <Bud> What do you think Syn brings to the table that RiSE was lacking before? (Or
       at least what do they enhance?)

 <Elocin> they enhance the cad/cam aspect of RiSE, cause they have some hardcore 
          cad/cam people :)
 <Elocin> Also SiNs made a huge sacrifice for RiSE
 <Elocin> in a deal with AMN

 <Bud> So in other words LND is in more trouble than they're already in, and 
       PWA/SCUM get some more competition ;)

 <Elocin> he quit AOD in order for RiSE to pickup a lot uhm well lets say, assets.
 <Elocin> yep they can look for more competition from us =)

 <Bud> When RiSE disbanded, a portion went with Toth to PWA... others headed to 
       Corp... others where ever... is there an open door for former members to 
       return to the fold?

 <Elocin> this isnt going to be like the old RiSE which sometimes went idle for  months.
 <Elocin> hmm
 <Elocin> only select members
 <Elocin> are being taken back in.
 <Elocin> there are some people who will probably not get back in.
 <Elocin> I think SiNs deserves a lot of credit tho for what he did :)

 <Bud> Interesting thing... until now AMN had a policy, once you're out, you're out 

 <Elocin> yeah

 <Bud> Now we see SiNs back in AMN, for the benefit of RiSE
 
 <Elocin> yep.
 <Elocin> he did it all for RiSE :)

 <Bud> So I'm going to assume this deal was beneficial for both sides 

 <Elocin> yeah it was :)
 <Elocin> Lester is back in RiSE again :)

 <Bud> Yes I see... as a side note
 <Bud> that dumb slut supplied me with an app and it's missing files!
 <Bud> So I guess RiSE gets it <g>

 <Elocin> LOL.
 <Elocin> Probably :>

 <Bud> Moving on... Now... this could be a touchy issue... as not everyone in RiSE was
       too happy when Toth wanted to disband...
 <Bud> Has Toth had any input as to the RiSE comeback? Purely speculating, but what
       would the reaction be if he wanted to return?

 <Elocin> hmm
 <Elocin> He really fucked RiSE when he left and took all those ppl to PWA.
 <Elocin> I really doubt we would let him back in ever.

 <Bud> What do you think will really set this incarnation of RiSE apart from the 
       previous one? And do you expect to have any trouble living up to the 
       past name?
 <Bud> You seem to be having a good week, but well, a week's a week.

 <Elocin> Well
 <Elocin> this incarnation still focuses on quality. quantity is not a priority.
 <Elocin> but we have a different attitude now.
 <Elocin> friends do not count as members.
 <Elocin> they may hold ops in the channel, but we dont count them as members cause 
          that was a big problem in the old rise, people would find one guy idling and 
          say "hey how come i cant idle" and they would stop working.
 <Elocin> and then we would end up idle for months.

 <Bud> So a stronger work ethic sums that up I guess :)
 
 <Elocin> yeah :)

 <Bud> Now, RiSE had a pretty decent cracking team in the past.. at least up till
       the end... can we expect that to return?

 <Elocin> oh hell yes.

 <Bud> lol

 <Elocin> I feel we have to say the least
 <Elocin> an equally strong cracking team
 <Elocin> already.

 <Bud> no qouting Steve Austin during the interview pls
 <Bud> ;)

 <Elocin> (as the previous rise)
 <Elocin> oh shit sorry :P
 <Elocin> ill quote nine "argh" "u there?"
 <Elocin> :P

 <Bud> haha
 <Bud> ok now I'm going to get off topic
 <Bud> somewhere before or after this interview, in NWR
 <Bud> is a response from GLOBETrotter

 <Bud> to the RBS FlexGen license generator for FlexLM

 <Elocin> HAHA
 <Elocin> No offense to RBS
 <Elocin> but FlexGen is somewhat overrated.
 <Elocin> and i already have a cracker writing a RiSE FlexLM Generator in 
          ASM not VB :P
 <Elocin> I dont know if we will make that public tho, thats his choice.

 <Bud> Yeh I have one working on it in Delphi
 <Bud> same deal ;)

 <Elocin> so what did globetrotter say?
 <Elocin> they going to file a suit or smth?

 <Bud> I just want yer opinion on a few comments

 <Elocin> sure

 <Bud> Bud: 
 <Bud> How soon can users expect an update to protect their merchandise?
 <Bud> GT:
 <Bud> Vendors who follow our recommendations are not subject to the "license
 <Bud> generator" attack to which you refer.
 <Bud> The loophole that was used in the hack that was described in the press
 <Bud> was closed in FLEXlm v6.1, over a year ago.
 
 <Elocin> actually
 <Elocin> FlexLM is weak.
 <Elocin> period.
 <Elocin> If you want good protection go back to dongles or hasps.
 <Elocin> ie: Surfware probably makes the best usage of the Sentinel SuperPro Dongle
 <Elocin> the only way to defeat it is by emulating the dongle.
 <Elocin> cause it does all kinds of checks on the binaries to see if they have been 
          tampered with.

 <Bud> Am I the only one who noticed that FlexGen works fine with FlexLM 6.1, and 
       the hole is still there?
 <Bud> Now this is something that caught me as a pisser for end-users... GT's response 
       to whether or not they'll fix their problems and support their customers

 <Elocin> Yeah
 <Elocin> they blame it on the customers
 <Elocin> they say
 <Elocin> "if you did not follow our recommendations for how to implement the flexlm 
          license manager then its your fault that you made it so vulnerable"
 <Elocin> but the truth is FlexLM itself is a sort of generic licensing scheme.
 <Elocin> so it has always been weak.

 <Bud> It would be unfair to our customers with support contracts 
 <Bud> to provide support and/or updates to those that are not on 
 <Bud> a support contract.
 <Bud> Supporting a customer on such matters consumes valuable 
 <Bud> GLOBEtrotter support staff time.
 <Bud> Seems to GT, supporting customers using their faulty software is a waste 
        of time.

 <Elocin> Yep

 <Bud> Do you think the consisant defeat of FlexLM, and the attitude of 
       "Just upgrade" will drive developers to other schemes such as Dongle,
       or even ISO protection schemes?

 <Elocin> Probably
 <Elocin> well ISO protection schemes are weak
 <Elocin> there are already exe rebuilders/dumpers for that now.
 <Elocin> I figure they will resort to HASP protections.
 <Elocin> HASP is much more secure than most dongle implentations.

 <Bud> But of course even those are beaten... so what did we learn here today boys 
       and girls? Protection schemes suck, and stop only Joe Schmoe from backing

MOVIE REVIEWS

I have been quite busy for the past long while. In fact, i have not 
seen a movie in the theatres for almost 2 months. That does not stop
me from reviewing them however. Here are Movie Reviews For Movies I
Have Never Seen.


Mystery, Alaska
**/4

Wacky story about small alaskan town with nothing to do but fuck and
play hockey. Would have been more believable if it took place in 
Canada, where there really *is* nothing to do but fuck and play hockey,
but we'll try to overlook that for now.
Some dude with dark hair plays the lead character who gets the chance of
a lifetime, when his pickup hockey team challenges the New York Rangers
to a winner takes all game.
Its tight, but in the end, the guys from Mystery pull together, and kick
the crap out of the Rangers by 1 goal. Fairly formulaic plot knocks this
wacky sports/romantic comedy down by 2 *'s.


Three Kings
***.5/4

George Clooney delivers the best performance of his acting career in this
story about 3 Golf War soldiers who hatch a plot to steal the gold bullion
that saddam stole from the saudi's. In the end, they make off with several
million dollars in gold and stretched mercedes's, while helping the iraqi
people rise up and overthrow their oppressors. 
Ice Cube and Marky Mark are convincing sidekicks to Clooney, who clearly
deserves (and will recieve) a best acting nomination for his performance.
This movie has something for everyone. It's violent, sad, comedic, and 
manages to have a sense of morality without being overly preachy.
One of the best movies of the year so far, and should vie for oscar
contention next year.


Blue Streak
***/4

Martin Lawrence in his FUNNIEST goddamn movie of alltime. He is HILARIOUS
as a former jewel thief whose hidden diamond in stowed in a building that
ends up being... ... a POLICE STATION!.. Wacky madness ensue's as martin
tries to get the rock back by IMPERSONATING A COP. The part where he pretends
to be a pizza delivery boy is DAMN GOOD. In the end, he ends up finding the
diamond, only to discover that his REAL passion is for police work. He
ditches the diamond in a safe place, and goes back to fighting crime,
supercop-style!

Now if you'd like to see reviews by someone who SAW the movies, see below.

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 



Three Kings
Starring: George Clooney, Ice Cube, Mark Wahlberg
Rating: 3 1/2 out of 4 stars

Three Kings is about 3 men who go in search of gold stolen from Kuwait by Iraq during Desert Storm. They find a map of where it's hidden in some dude's ass and on their way they go! One bonus to this movie is JAMIE KENNEDY!#@ (dude who played Randy in Scream), I love this guy! Anyways, this is actually a very good movie, although it's one of the better movies so far this year, but Oscar time I think it will be forgotten or lost amongst some of the bigger boys who are due out around Thanksgiving. But give credit to some underappreciated actors here, you got Ice Cube, Clooney and Dirk Diggler..they all pull off very good performances.


---------


Mystery, Alaska
Rating: 2 3/4 out of 4 Stars
Starring: Mary McCormack(ALISON STERN!@#!#@), Russel Crowe, and some other ppl.

Well, this is not your average everyday movie as Nd would like us all to believe. It's about a small town in Alaska that for the past 18 years or something has been playing hockey on frozen ponds and every Saturday they have a game amongst each other of the best of the best. Out of nowhere Hank Azaria comes back and says the NY Rangers want to play them in a publicity stunt. What follows is some town pride, comedy, great hockey scenes and some solid acting from Crowe and a few others. Though this is not a great movie, it is definately decent. It's not Mighty Ducks at least. <g>


------


For The Love of the Game
Starring: KEVIN COSTNER!@!#!#@!@$, John C. Reilly, Kelly Preston(Don't EVER STOP FUCKING ME!)
Rating: 3 out of 4 Stars

Yes god damnit I gave a Kevin Costner movie 3 stars, and damnit I am being generous I guess. But this is actually a good movie. The baseball scenes are really good and though Costner is not the best actor in the world anymore, he still delivers a decent performance. My g/f hates him and she still thought he did good in this movie. Kelly Preston is the one who shines as Costner's g/f, she delivers alot of emotion in her character. Costner plays a pitcher who is at the end of his career and is faced with a difficult decision. This is pretty old so chances are you saw it if you wanted to by now!

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is  usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear  people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination  of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.

Ryche was MIA again this week. Hopefully we will see him return soon.

-----------[The Scene News]-----------

All the news thats fit to print... 
and then some...

-What the fuck is UP, niggaz? I be BACK and black and black and black
 and BACK... I know ya'll missed me and shit, but.... don't cry, just
 dry your eye, and let the witch doctor sky drop some phatty phat 
 rhymes..   

-Today's site of the week is dedicated to my main man, ndetroit.
 Its a canuck site about tagging, check this funky shit out:
 http://www.visualorgasm.com/visualorgasm/index.htm


-Well... something that i didn't know is that fucking [STiX] has been
 promoted to leadership (or some shit) in AMNESiA. Good fucking work
 to him. AMNESiA also got SiNS back, so thats all good.


-SJ has a phatty new site called DMZ up and its fast as hell, so you
 should go bug him for an account. Also: TOS is back, and its like..
 100 gigs, or something... or so the siteops say.. They won't give
 me an account (3 gigs! gone!) so i can't verify this... <g>

-ETERNAL, the great (laf!) RiSC leader is MIA. If you have seen him,
 please... .... ... ermm... ... please tell him to stay the fuck away,
 thanks... ;p

-STH (the best site... ever?) was narked this week. Rumors abound as
 to who the nark was, but so far its all been conjecture. Nothing 
 concrete... until now.     Stairway To Heaven was narked by:  "Lester".
 Yes, its true. How this could have happened is beyond me, but I
 have it on very good authority that this "Lester" narked STH. Fucker.. 
 It's guys like this that are killing the scene... Guys that haven't been
 around for very long, they put up a few megs on some decent sites, 
 and then BAM! they are added immediately to great sites like STH and
 FS.. 
 *sigh*... don't say we didn't warn you. You gotta watch out for guys
 like this 'Lester'. They are only in the scene to destroy it.
 Come on now... how many of you *really* have known Lester for more than
 a few months? I don't remember seeing him on any sites or boards or
 in any groups before this year... Sheeeit niggas. You gots to be more
 CAREFUL. Look at the groups he's in!!
 AMNESiA!!! For fucks' sakes.. AMNESIA IS A GROUP FULL OF FUCKING NARKS.
 And he's not even like... council or anything.. he's just some random
 dude that joined the group recently.. FUCK MAN.. THEY JUST LET ANYONE
 IN TO THEIR SHITTY GROUP.
 Anyways.. enough ranting... bottom line: some no name dude named "Lester"
 narked the great site, STH, and now its gone forever.


-Mossyoak quit RTS, and shopped his services around (whored) to every
 group out there but sadly, no group would take him.. HAHAHAHAHAH

-Garoto was narked. He is one of the greatest traders in a DAMN long
 time, and its sad to see him go. There are NO details on his narking,
 and DEV is being surprising quiet on the issue. ... .... much like
 the transformers... there is more here than meets the eye.
 Also: garoto narked STH.... dev will not deny that either... hmmm...
**EDITOR NOTE** Garoto was not narqed to our knowledge, simply busted for doing naughty things. ***EDITOR NOTE***

-What in the hell was TTOL doing giving game reviews while i was gone?

-Hi acidapple! Hi mandrake!   www.girlscoutcookiefanclub.zzn.com   leet!

-If you guys need a bounce, shell, bot, or anything else, PLEASE DO
 YOURSELF A FUCKING FAVOR, AND GO TO      www.socalsys.com
 
 We get asked all the time, "what the fuck is a good place to get
 bots/bounces/web space?"... the answer is these guys.. stable as
 hell, and your shit is NOT gonna get hacked.
 Go check it out.
 Word.

-NEW UTIL UPLOAD!@# : ndetroit(AMN) - Fucking.Goddamn.Passwords.v1.0.1.19-NSC
