    Well well well, we take a week off and we are still late, how 
    pathetic huh? But can you blame us? Star wars came out the same day 
    NWR was supposed to. How could we compete with that? In respect to 
    the great Lucas we delayed the issue until after the hype had calmed. 
    Now we figured to release yesterday, but then Eviliso was kind enough 
    to bring us Star Wars again! So we all had to download it and could 
    not be bothered with the magazine <g> Anyways, our webpage isn't up, 
    because I'm fucking firing our designers if the shit doesn't go up 
    soon. If you want to design the page and can do it before I go into 
    a retirement home then email us at nwr@netmonkey.org. Anyways, seems 
    there are some other emags out there, and so I think I will give my 
    personal endorsement of only one of them. Risk1so..bringing porn and 
    shitty coding right to your computer. Well, seeing as how our webpage 
    may never go up, I think I will go ahead and continue the Tdpriest 
    journey next week. You all probably forgot what it was even about by 
    now, so enjoy the mag and look forward to cool stuff next week.

    Whooo... kinda been a while, eh?

    Well.. between the 2 of us, lester and i have seen TPM about a dozen 
    times now, slap on ryche, and the nwr crew has to have seen the flick 
    like .. 20 times already... so..

    So we've been gone for 2 weeks... deal with it!!!
    
    I can honestly say that of all the people that come and gone here
    at nwr, i will miss prozac the most of all. He is giving up writing
    his nwr column to concentrate on life/class... (class?).. heh..
    Believe it or not, those goddamn columns take forever to do.. so i
    can certainly understand where he is coming from. Maybe i don't know
    much, but i think that i can honestly say that i learned something
    every time i read proz's column.. good luck..

    Blitz is back this week, and it looks like he'll be here for good.
    Welcome to him. Ryche is here with a full TPM wrap-up, and bud makes
    up for lost time with his utils report.

    What the hell happened to bud, anyway?.. well, i guess he ran into
    some financial trouble, unfortunately, and was seen walking the streets
    of new york.. fortunately tho, we got a picture!  bud.jpg...
    We also have that old hybrid.nfo that i promised 2 weeks ago, but forgot
    to include...

    See ya.

    I'm back from selling crack to kids on the street, so lets get
  down to the site action.

    Glen has some new bitch site up on some pretty phat hardware...
  Not the sweet .no link that he promised before though, just a US
  link, and the boxop hasn't really converted over to... uhh...
  *cough*linux... just yet.. so, good luck glen.. Site's name is "PWP"!

    Pretty good new site up called "EVL". Its, SOD, PFT, OGN, 40 gigs, 
  and is having a curry contest or something to determine courier affil.
  Site is US, and i dunno who the siteops are.. ;p

    V is a nice-looking new EURO that already has Ogn/vgc/core/eql affils
  and 80 gigs worth of ISO and 0day.. gotta love that.
    TT is back, but... uh... i think it still sucks. DFH is also back, and
  it also appears to do a reasonable amount of sucking, with a bunch of 
  shit-ass affils that i have never heard of.. (my apologies to the groups
  "sea-demo" and "air")

    DMS picked picked up the site PR, with its sweet VCD and MP3 archives..
  nice work to them. They also picked up MF, the decent Euro site..
    VDR dropped DMS after an almost record lack-of-support. Word on the street
  is that DMS is not exactly crying their eyes out, after the siteop's crappy
  attitudes about working on the site, and/or putting in any effort at all to
  find some affils.
    EC is back, picked up some affils, including SHOCK.. SHOCK now has like..
  30 sites... wooo..
    
    Apparently TDP (the devils pit) and TMX (the matrix) 2 crappy US sites
  were taken down because the admin said they were 'narked'.. yeah.. whatever.
  Turns out the dumbass admin was just getting 'tired of running a site'..
  typical..

    E is still not back... damnit you guys! vacation's over. Back to work!

    Thanks to glen and tc for the wkups this week.. you both are fat!


    Siteops!! send your weektops to: nwr@netmonkey.org... Thanks
  to all those that support us every week... ;)


=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. 
	Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... 
heh... fuck off and die..
=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=

          The Top Ten sites for this week are:

	                                
           x3 FS -*- STH -*- ET -*-  FH -*- CAT

Sorry.. will have rankings next week..

Biased Courier Report

2 Weeks and I still don't really have shit to say..hehe sad isn't it? 


AOD: AOD continues to pile up second place to prevotion week after 
     week. Cedric/Blaze/Zarkof continue to carry the flame for them. 
     Not alot of changes here in the group. AOD continues to be stable 
     and content in their current team without searching out new people.

Devotion: Does Norseman ever get tired of hearing himself talk? No I 
          really dont think so. Maybe one day he will realize most 
          of the things he said are just a perfectly good waste of 
          finger muscles, better saved for the nightly masturbation 
          ritual!

Dimension: Well let's see, in the past 2 weeks we saw Glen quit and 
           VDRLake quit. Let's discuss those first. Glen gets promoted 
           to staff and then believes it was all a conspiracy and quits 
           citing a lack of power. (Glen's hero is David Duchovny). So 
           glen plans to start a new group, but wait he realizes nobody 
           will join his new group so where does he turn? Where all 
           washed up people with nowhere to go end up. RISC!@# The group 
           he ridiculed and mocked for months. 
           Ahhh yes. Now, VDRLake. DMS support was nonexistent. Siteops 
           presence on the site, also nonexistent..where oh where is 
           Jamili? 
           Now to the pickups, DMS gained Bud from VLN, Nailz from MNM, 
           Citizen from Risc..and uhm..i think that's all <g>. Also picking 
           up PR and MF as new sites. DMS is consistantly pulling 3rd or 
           2nd..better than before but not up to what we all would like 
           right? Poof!


Risc: Ooo OO! DMS traded Citizen for Glen I guess..who got the better 
      end of the deal? I'm not going to say but I think we all can 
      see..<g> 
      I also heard about some Riscy staffers who enjoy using Riscftp, 
      NAUGHTY NAUGHTY!


God..what other groups exist?

THE BLITZ REPORT FOR THE WEEK OF 04/25/99 - 05/02/99
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Looks like this is the last week for me in NWR sitting in for Prozac. I 
was going to have interviews with Cyric and Hankman this week, but the 
Cyric interview was a little pointless after he went back to Razor, and 
the Hankman was never completed (something came up at home I simply could 
not avoid doing). So no interviews this week I'm afraid, just the regular 
unbiased reports you love so much... Let's get started.

 PDM claimed two games this week, one good and one not so good. F22 
Lightning is an above-average title in a month mostly marked by 
mediocrity thus far. Cricket isn't really too big in Canada, and 
frankly we've seen a few cricket titles already. Not that it's not 
a legit game, but If I wasn't writing this report, I wouldn't have 
downloaded it. Looks decent, but a cricket game needs some serious 
bells and whistles to get me exited. Maybe Cricket To The Death or 
something, I dunno. As for the Warzone shit, enough already. Gimme 
the last patch or something, the game wasn't even that great. The 
Expendable fix apparently fixes some problem with a single video 
card. I don't have that card, but I bet someone somewhere is happy. 
Nice week for PDM, consitent as always.

 Looks like The Punisher decided to walk the walk too. At press time, 
Razor had also nailed down the two highly anticipated Star Wars releases. 
Toast pulling majors out of his ass... I can't help but cheer on my 
Canuck buddy (Go leafs go). Last week they came out with another good 
game in Rage of Mages 2. I really liked the first one, and this one 
seems to be more of what made the first version so popular. Razor is 
one of the few groups that seem to even bother with trainers anymore, 
and they did a pair this week. The Puzzle Bobble 2 trainer is a whatever, 
but the Expendable one is some serious good work, including some nice 
features and the in-game cheat codes. Pick this one up, it's good work. 
With the addon for ROM2 and that trainer, they cruise into second place 
for the first time in a while. Razor 1911 back? This is the first month 
in a long time when four groups had a chance at winning it after two 
weeks. Razor and PDM are out in front with Origin and Class well within 
striking distance. Competition is back, and so is my first group in the 
scene.

 The good old english schoolboys skip merrily along putting out 80% of 
the UK games. This is yet another to add to Cypher and ][ce's long list 
of titles. Reading the nfo before downloading, I was really hoping for 
something more. A Viking Real-Time Strategy game sounded pretty cool. 
Unfortunately it's not really much different than any of the other games. 
It was kinda funny seeing the women do all the peasant work and the men 
off fighting deer, but I guess it's historicly accurate. Viking speech 
was cool too, but when you add it all up you get a three.

 HEY! No fixes =). All the major groups get a nice gold star for their work 
this week. Coincidence that CLS didn't release a game? Must be. Nothing from 
the two little guys this week. Grind was off playing courier most of the 
time I saw him, and who knows what the hell DVN is up to. Origin has to be 
a little pissed off at Cyric... I know I would be. Now that Razor is releasing
more, they are gonna have to learn how to do a proper pre-release. This 
upload the disks from the cracker's house bullshit is bush league.

THE BLITZ REPORT FOR THE WEEK OF 05/03/99 - 05/10/99
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Prozac has retired from the NWR weekly report, so it looks like you are 
stuck with me. The week that was showed the resurgance of Razor 1911 and 
a surprising lack of activity from both Class and Paradigm. Origin stayed 
active with a minor game, but this week was all Razor. On a more personal 
note, I should inform you all that I am once again a proud member of Razor 
1911. I'll try to keep the bias to a minimum, but I'm only human. 
Coincidentaly enough, the winner this week is...

 Wow. Out of nowhere Big Boss and Toast, never mistaken for Dogfriend and 
Drizzt, come up with two of the bigger games of the year thus far. Both 
games easily qualify as top credit games even if only for the Star Wars 
name. Razor also put out two addons for Phantom Menace, and a trainer 
for each game. The TPM Trainer, however turned out to be non-working, 
and will be deducted half a point. Razor also put out a silly fix for 
Evil Core Fallen Cities. Before Paradigm starts jumping up and down 
screaming, yes I remember I put out the Turok fix, and yeah. I 
acknowledge it was a mistake. Let's get off this track, and concentrate 
on keeping our own stuff working rather than looking for fixes nobody needs.

 The usual week from Origin. ED Hunter is... a game. OGN jumps the gun 
on an unneeded fix for SW:TPM as well. TK4 should learn to control his 
exitement when something may need a fix. This one was on sites not half 
an hour after the game was released. Hardly enough time to test the game, 
let alone get a fix done. ][ce takes part of the responsibility, but in 
the end, Origin just looks bad trying to make Razor look bad. More Warzone 
for no points, see below for a recap of just how much PDM and OGN have 
milked this game.

 Ack. Well someone had to finish last. PDM hasn't been looking up at the 
rest of the big four for a long time. A pair of patches... one for a half

A disk repack, a fix, a repacked fix, and seven patches. No game is worth 
that.

 Competition in the game scene is good for everyone. Class definately looks 
to be on their way down. Reports of their membership being unhappy with Mr. 
Skill are becoming more and more frequent. It might only be a matter of time 
before we see a split here. Razor did a little house cleaning, getting rid 
of some useless members. Addition by subtraction seems to be working, because 
they are almost guaranteed the month of May, unless Origin can stop them. 
Class is definately in a slump. Next week will be a jamming issue, were we 
get to discuss the Star Trek and Alien vs Predator races. Origin hasn't 
really gotten any better, but when the three USA groups are splitting the 
titles, their chokehold on the UK market is still there, churning out a 
consistent stream of games. 

 That's all for this double issue of The Blitz Report. Thanks for reading, 
and enjoy the rest of NWR. I'd just like to mention that The first report 
was done on MONDAY of last week, but Lester and Ndetroit are lazy bastards.

 Bud's Biased Utils Report #20
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Wow, the big 2-0! And only two weeks late to match! Well I never expected 
 to still be writing this report in may... but I'm still having fun with it 
 so why not. My apologies for missing the last two weeks, I was in the middle 
 of a habitational relocation (aka getting the fuck outta dodge), and it took
 a little longer than I expected... but hey I'm back.

 No interview this week, I'm just getting back on my feet. Last issue I 
 missed  listing a few releases from some groups, I only missed in the listing, 
 scores are still ok, with the exception of VRS, who I'm awarding an extra 
 point. I may not list releases at all in the future, or just list a few of 
 each groups best (or worst <g>), it gets tedious after a while.

 The two weeks I'm counting as lost and gone as far as this report goes, so
 when I tally up scores next issue for groups here since the beginning of my
 report (as well as others who have been here over 10 reviews now) they won't
 be taken into account.

 So what did I miss... some Grad retirement letter on TCA... he's an admitted
 publicity hound, so if you wanna see what's up, look there... VGC have been
 preforming pretty well it seems... PNC actually RELEASED this week... some
 other stuff... more MS finals, supposed finals, and shit between CORE/PWA...
 I have to side with PWA on any M$ issues, Bill Gates has paid me on behalf 
 of the group and is the true PWA insider.. I mean... oops... nevermind.
 
 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 05/11/99 to 05/17/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.


 Groups: (In no particular order)

 Adobe.Type.Manager.Deluxe.4.1.Beta.1-PWA
 Intergraph.InRoads.Construction.07.02.00.00-PWA
 Intergraph.Geomedia.3.0-PWA

 The PWA team FINALLY does a major Intergraph release in with
 all the small stuff, with GeoMedia 3... they also show off their 
 cracking skills with a Keygen Incl release - my personal feelings is that
 anything released should be fully working, be it cracked, carded,
 no protection, or whatever, so there's no need to say this or that
 is included in the dir name, so long as it works - but that's just me.

 The Corporation was a real force over the past seven days, both in quality
 releases and in quantity. Some of these titles are a bit iffy - IBM C for 
 AIX (released only because it's IBM), and the New Rider MCP Training Guide 
 stuff... but you can't deny the quality of titles such as Adobe Go live 4 
 (which several groups went after), and Symantec Mobile Essentials 2 (seems 
 DOD was nowhere to be found).

 I've always said I don't make a difference between web apps and store 
 stuff... but I was suprised tosee RiSE do two web apps in one week... 
 Help Breeze is also pretty old... Deep paint is new and decent, but without 
 a doubt the best app here is TNT 6.

 is a welcome edition. SGE also put out a decent addition for SolidWorks, as 
 well as a new version of Cinmagrafi. Not the most active group this week but 
 a selection of notable titles.

 Well Shock has slowed over the past few weeks... no idea as to why <g>. 
 They still manage a few store apps, although nothing noteworthy, as well 
 as some decent web stuff. They beat MFD to the final of Sax Basic Engine 
 5.2, proving they're active enough to win what counts... good to see a 
 final after so many minor builds. HaberDash, Emblaze, and Internal Web are 
 all decent apps as well, if nothing
 fancy.

 Hmmm I'm gone two weeks and no real changes, LND still dominates the CAD/CAM
 field. I haven't tested any of these so I won't get into the apps 
 specifically...
 I am considering a few in depth reviews of specific apps each week however, 
 time permitting.

 Should FCN ever die they'll probably still own Delphi components from beyond 
 the grave... FCN is a developer's dream, and for the most part a mainstream 
 user's nightmare... I can honestly say I have no clue what UBackPRO is... 
 they did win on 1st Class from Woll2Woll software, beating out Shock and 
 MFD. DAO Components is pretty popular, and I'd go for it expect I erased CPP 
 Builder :P

 So I missed a few weeks of VGC rels... Lester don't kill me!!! ;)
 Honestly looking back I didn't miss too much. VGC is consistantly putting
 out some nice apps, but nothing special, and I honestly can't say they're 
 giving a real challenge to any of the current top groups... although really 
 this week I can easily say VGC is in the top three utils release groups. 
 The real test will come with the racing of a few anticipated titles... so 
 far VGC lost on MasterCAM... I'd like to see how they fare on a more 
 mainstream app in tough competition (if there is such a thing left as c
 ompetition left in the scene, seems to be weaker and weaker these days).

 This week again we see some nice middle of the road stuff with HotDocs Pro, 
 Cisco ConfigMaker, CheckPoint Account Management...

 Quote(s) of the Week: 


 Corp stood out in my mind this week, along with VGC, Siege... honerable 
 mention to XF, Scum, and PNC (hey why not, they're active!). Next report 
 I'll be tallying up scores for those groups who have had 20 reviews and 
 I'll give an average... that's hoping I have it done for next week.
 
 I decided to remove MFD for now, as the top apps from that group are going 
 through VGC now, and MFD is sticking to minor releases and cracking.

                                                                   - Bud

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 




Well, I have only one film to review, as nobody dares to release any 
other films around this time.



Star Wars: Episode 1, The Phantom Menace
Starring: Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, 
          Samuel L. Jackson
Directed & Written by: George Lucas
Rating : 4 out of 4 Stars


First, every movie reviewer on the planet gave this film terrible reviews. 
Now if I was to sit down at this movie and examine it on every level as an 
academy award worth film, I would have to give it some negative reviews as 
well. But this is Star Wars, the most anticipated movie of possibly all 
time, certainly in my lifetime. I'm sure virtually everyone reading this 
has sene the film already, or is currently downloading the VERY good 
telesync of the movie rls'ed by our favorite group EViLiSO. 
Do not bother with VCD-Europe's pathetic attempt at getting the glory from 
this movie. Eviliso has produced the best telesync I've seen. Very few 
sound glitches and a nearly perfect picture. Mass props to them for the 
respect shown by only releasing a TS worthy of the film. Now, to the film. 
Surely this movie is not as good as episode four, but it is still an epic 
film and a dazzling special effects display. If you are not watching it 
in a theatre then you are truly missing out. All the characters are well 
played and though not many of the characters are deeply explored as Lucas 
rushes a great deal of images and history into the film. The lone 
disappointment was little Jake Lloyd's acting ability. But the highlights 
outweigh the one minor setback. Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala is very 
good and also she's quite the hottie. McGregor and Neeson are well cast 
as the Jedi Knights and the finale battle scenes are epic. Go see it 
in the theater, and let's put Star Wars back into 1st place and knock 
that damn Titanic off ok? But also check out the vcd for sure, since 
we won't see this on video for quite awhile.

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.

Ryche's Really Biased VCD Group Report #14


<noova> I have Internet Explorer 5.0 looking to trade for Phantom Menace 
        VCD. Message me..


  Gawd.. the gimp gods have made me work overtime on this. Since no NWR 
last week *cough*nd*cough*gimp*cough* I have to do a double issue this 
week?! WTF? Pay me goddammit. <G> 

  Ok since I have alot to cover, Ill give you the highlights first. Yes, 
Star Wars. Shutup about it already. Go see it in the theatre you cheap 
bastards. Also last week we got the VCD Screener of The Matrix finally, 
another mad popular release. Few other gems like The Mummy, Idle Hands 
Screener, and a Varsity Blues Screener. On with the show..

- HIGHSPEED -

Well they were certainly high on something. Not sure if it was speed or not, 
but they had to be stoned to release the three they did.. Alien Arsenal is 
NOT a part of the original Alien series, dont be fooled. They even marketed 
this movie as Alien V: Arsenal. Its a direct to video, cheesy, sci-fi flick. 
Wishmaster 2 is the cheesy horror film sequel that was originally shown on 
HBO. Don't think it's on video though, but I haven't checked. Dougs First 
Movie will hopefully be his last. Cartoon, kiddie, gay.

Total - 1 Point


- EViLISO -

Quite a wild two weeks for this group. The Mummy was the #1 flick at theatres 
until the Phantom Menace madness. Its about some dead egyptian who comes back 
with powers of the undead. Cool. Hideous Kinky is about young girls in 
Morocco who are taken care of by Kate Winslet (red-haired naked chick in 
Titanic). Sounds lame to me unless she gets naked again. Idle Hands Screener 
is the teenage comedy/horror about a stoner who's hand becomes posessed and 
kills. Kinda cool actually if your high. Lost and Found is the David Spade 
comedy about stealing a chick's dog to get close to her. He's just not as 
funny with-out Chris Farley though. Psycho.. gay remake of the Hitchock 
classic that bombed at the theatre, screener this time though. And FINALLY.. 
the best TS of the week with yes, the one, the only Star Wars Episode 1. 
Its not perfect, but its a good copy and it at least satiated the morons 
until Austin Powers 2 comes out.

Total - 5 Points


- VCD-Europe -

I pick on the europenises alot but overall I like em usually. Theyre back 
with a vengance lately and acting like a real group again. Good to see. 
Matrix screener, great quality, good download. They would have won this 
week if only theyre Star Wars would have been good quality. They did 
win on the TS though, but EViLISO followed right behind them with a better 
copy of it, so they got nuked alot of places. Props for trying hard though. 
The other stuff is borderline crap. Just the Ticket, Andie McDowall falls 
in love with Andy Garcia, the virtuous ticket scalper. My Name is Joe, 
alcoholic Scotsman (what a stretch).A Midsummer Nights Dream is hollywood 
trying to cash in on the Shakespeare In Love phenomenon, and failing 
miserably. Hillary and Jackie.. wtf?

Total - 4 Points


- Centropy -

One release, but I like it. Varsity Blues was one of the cooler flicks out 
of the crop of teenage comedies because it was actually funny. Drunk 
football players, horny cheerleaders, and naked teachers.. gotta love it.

Total - 2 Points


- PMTVCD -

Patch Adams and Thin Red Line Screeners. Patch is ok, nice to have a screener 
of it finally but the Thin Red Line Screener looks mysteriously like the 
Film Transfer from HighSpeed a few months back. How many copies of a 3 CD 
movie that sucks do we need really?

Total - 2 Points



Group of the past two weeks was EViLSO with VCD-Europe giving them stiff 
competition. Two exciting weeks in a row for VCD, with the frenzy for Star 
Wars concluding it. The summer will bring more blockbusters, and more 
idiots. Yay. Until next time fans..

-----------[Whats the matter with RiSE?]-----------

Alright.. This is some pretty messed up stuff, people. Here's the deal:
Rise had a supplier by the name of "Rogue" who supplied them the fairly
decent "JobBoss" title, on the condition that they did NOT release the
serial number he provided them with. The serial was only going to be used
as a cracking aid.
Well.. to make a long story short, elocin and RiSE released the title,
with the serial, and this Rogue dude gonna be in some pretty hot water..
Nice work guys. How about you go fuck up some dude's personal life, one
of your SUPPLIERS personal life, just so that you can get out that one
extra release..

Genius.
Now the capper:
Here's a nice little log of toth's reaction to this whole business...


  <Toth> ?
<Lestah> you guys didn't even tell Rogue about jobboss
  <Toth> thatd be something to do with me being away the week it was put out
  <Toth> i was offline for a week and then was taking the next week to 
         reinstall everything
  <Toth> nasty sys crash
<Lestah> still..it's bad enough it was released..but no one even told Rogue
  <Toth> i have no control over what is done while im not here .. ive 
         reprimanded elocin.. as well as a couple others since it happened.. 
         but theres no way to change the past
<Lestah> reprimanded..hehe he should have been removed from the group IMHO..
         but I no longer have a presence in rise..but not even telling the 
         supplier you placed in great danger is fucked up
  <Toth> i cant really go and kick the only active cracker we have
<Lestah> Yes I knew that would be the case
  <Toth> since hes the one that fucked up.. used the serial.. and put the 
         release out w/o telling any1 he was going to be
  <Toth> if i had an active cracking force things would be different
<Lestah> hehe ethics and morals are disregarded for lack of other options..:)
  <Toth> unfortunatly it has to be that way =0 id love to fix things up and 
         boot him for it.. we both know my opinion in shit like that.. but 
         itd be.. death of all cad/cam releases instead of most of he was 
         booted.. anyways.. i have to run.. girlfriend calls.. ill be back 
         in..  6 hours =0
<Lestah> bye stu


Oh.. by the way.. did we mention that RiSE neglected to tell the supplier
that they released the util with his serial..?
How nice.

 tca.phatchicks.com  : Thank god he finally updated his page, so i have some-
                       where to steal news from... ;p
 union.jaded.net     : unions's goddamn page.. used to be good.. now it sucks,
                       never fucking updated..
 www.defacto2.net    : fucking AMAZING archives maintained by the founders of
                       the old defacto mags.. an *almost* perfect archive..
                       almost, i said... you know what they're missing.. ;p
 www.socalsys.com    : need shells, bounces, vhosts, web space?... these dudes
                       are scene-friendly, and got some decent deals... only
                       reason why i mention is cause the dude was fat enough
                       to hook up nd up with some action... *cough*... HAHAHAH!

-Some milestones in the scene this week: mgoh brought up his record 147th site,
 glen joined his 14th group, cedric made the STH Alltime, citizen broke TD
 wkup record, pyx broke HOG wkup record..

-group moves: cyric back to rzr, intent to dms, ttol to dvn, glen to iND/RiSC,
 nails to dms from mnm, citizen to dms from risc, bud to dms from vln, 

-So DMS snagged citizen from RiSC... ouch!... kinda sucks.. the only good 
 RiSC curry out there.. what can they do?... i remember the old days when
 AMN/DEV/MnM would bring up the young pups, and RiSC would snag them into
 the giant RiSC machine...  *sigh*

-NWR's own beloved prozac is a cls senior now... bout time.. start crackin'
 the whip, brotha!

-ok, so "BLEEM" was finally released by UCF, with about 30 fixes as an added
 bonus.. Some group out there also released a "K6 Fix", for all you AMD owners
 out there who couldn't try it out.. 

-Lets give some mad props to "Miss Botswana", the new "Miss Universe".

-Ok.. now i know that imitation is the best form of flattery, blah, blah, blah
 but jesus christ people.. how many rip-off mags are we gonna see out there?
 steal our quotes of the week, our format.. our witty repartee... (?!?)
 most dont last more than a few issues anyway, but i mean.. If you are gonna
 rip off NWR, at least do a good job of it.. I'm not gonna name any names..
 Ah hell, maybe i will name names.. we'll save that for next week.. bitches.. ;p

-Rise is one fucked up group of morons. Now, i don't wanna rag on toth, 
 because as long as i've known him, he's been a person of respect and class,
 but this shit with fucking over one of their suppliers is ridiculous.
 Both elocin and toth should be shot. This dude is gonna get FIRED cause
 you dumb fucks just "wanted another release"... toth, have some balls
 and kick elocin.. you are the leader, and it all comes back to you, buddy.
 Do the right thing.

-Star Wars.. phantom menace.. believe the hype, and go see it in a
 THX-Certified theatre, muthafuckas...
