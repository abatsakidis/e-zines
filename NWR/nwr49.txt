     God damnit, we are still late again. I swear we are the biggest bunch 
	slackers I know. Because of hectic work, the Tdpriest Journal is not 
	yet completed, but it's near finished so next week I promise. (again)
	Seems we have a new webpage designer who actually will put up his
	page after designing it. So that is always a plus. Anyhow, we are 
	late and it's goin on 2:30am. So just read the damn mag.

    Blah.

    Heh.. I read that "USCR" report the other day.. nice work guys..
  They ranked "EVL" as the 3rd best site in the US... very cute.. except
  for the fact that EVL will probably go down in a week, and will be just
  another series of wasted credits.. beautiful..
    *Sigh*.. thats what you get when you leave the rankings to the kiddies..
  How about we leave things to the pro's... shall we? ;p
    Contrary to popular belief, ATX was not narked, or otherwise.. The site
  was temporarily down due to bouncer problems, but that was not the reason
  for its death

    TOS also has to be looking good.. at least giving ATX a run for its 
  money in the US site division.. 
    Did you guys know that FUBAR was CLS and not RZR??.. wtf??... man.. they
  should have stuck with RiSC/RZR/DOD, like the old days.. at least with DOD
  they would get some decent AV utils, as opposed to that ass-fuck utils
  affil they have now.. ;p

    No, *I'M* Ken Griffey Jr.... 

    Woooo... what the heck happened to VDR?.. ;p  does anyone support their
  any more?.. now that dms (and all of its 2 active traders) has fled the 
  coup, the site is being grouptopped by CrC and iND... *sigh*

    If i see another siege/dev/cls site, i am going to start winnuking 
  jaydee... ;p

    ATX is down and out for good.. What a bummer.. what a huge bummer..
  argueably the best site in the US at the time of its death.. 
  VGC WHQ, OGN WHQ, PHASE WHQ, KAC WHQ.. a nice set of affils.. 
  Had decent curry support too, even without an curry affil.
    Site went down after "the dvniso pricks tried to run the show",
  and basically abused the shit out of it.. lame stuff..

    Another yo-yo effect us site... good luck to mgoh, blitz, and the
  rest of the ATX staff.

    Siteops!! send your weektops to: nwr@netmonkey.org... Thanks
  to all those that support us every week... ;)


=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. 
	Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... 
heh... fuck off and die..
=--------------------------------------------------------------------------=

          The Top Ten sites for this week are:

	                                
           x3 FS -*- STH -*- ET -*-  FH -*- CAT

Sorry.. will have rankings next week..

Biased Courier Report

Shit, I am not prepared for such a task!

AOD: Well, AOD has been damn busy this week. First the EQL box coord
decides to drop EQL and bring all their boxes to AOD, then Hawkeye and
the VGN boys, just 3 weeks after merging with Ambition, decide to head
over to AOD, citing they "couldn't handle that prick Marbz as leader". 
So an interesting situation is that West23 and Darkwolf are now in the
same group, for those of you who remember the log we included of Darkwolf
trying to threaten West23 if he didn't join VGN. Should be interesting 
for a little while to see how all the egos collide in AOD. But as of now,
they are lookin pretty sharp.

AV: Heh, well we all knew this wasn't gonna last right?

DEV: I heard Norseman retired from box recruiting, well gee I guess Dev 
will just have to live with the 35 boxes or whatever ridiculous amount they
have now. Least maybe now we won't have to putup with Norse joining every 
channel when he gets a new fucking box. Otherwise, Dev is still riding
the Pre train along to #1.

DMS: Not alot happening here. With the additions of Citizen, Bud and Nailz
some expected a resurgence in DMS, but so far this has not been the case.
Although they have taken a Risc-esque turn in that they are owning their
US sites. Grumblings of internal conflict and disorganization seem to keep
this group bubbling around #3.

Risc: Hmm, so instead of ThePep abusing the DOD/Risc relationship, we now 
have Bandido doing it. Mossyoak tries to lend a hand and give a box to DOD,
only to have Bandido steal it off to Risc from the SUPERIOR MNM. So Mossy
having been in DOD for years and doing very little there, left them. I don't
know when Risc is going to learn that they are extinct.

Well shit, who else do I report on still? Oh ya..rumor is that EQL & MNM
are discussing a merger. I guess since they saw how successful Amb+VGN
combined to form a semi-idle group out of 2 idle ass groups..they 
figure they should try it?

Peace out kids

THE BLITZ REPORT FOR THE WEEK OF 05/23/99 - 05/30/99
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The final week of May was a time of big titles and controversy. With all four 
groups within striking distance of group-of-the-month honors, competition was 
fierce for every game, patch, and trainer. Game of the week is a tossup 
between Aliens vs Predator and Mechwarrior. I think the nod here goes to 
Mechwarrior, but it's really too close to call. Star Trek was a huge 
dissapointment. I'm a real TBS guy, and this one was supposed to be Master 
of Orion 3 set in the Star Trek universe. A clunky interface and some poor 
game mechanics aren't saved by the excellent combat simulator. Read on for 
all the dirt.

 After last week's rest, Paradigm got back down to the business of winning 
with another big week. Star Trek is a 4.0 game, but I've decided to split 
the points between CLS and PDM, since this one was really too close to call. 
There were good arguments on all sides. The CLS release was definately out 
first, but the PDM release made it to more sites. Game groups locate their 
best sites in Europe, but the end users get the games from the trickledown 
from the USHQ's. The PDM release dominated on the USA sites, and won on all 
WHQ's except FS. PDM claims their release was in the predir on ET long before 
Class put theirs out, but I doubt that .nfo file was intentionally made that 
way. What probably happened is that snap had all the disks except the first 
out, and they were waiting on the nfo file. Seems snap quickly saw the CLS 
release out and saved the day with a quick pre. Nice work, you stole a draw 
for your group. CLS's version being out first definately deserves them no 
less than a draw, but the PDM release made it further.
 Nascar Road Racing, Curse You Red Baron, and PGA Championship Golf are all 
mediocre titles for true fans of their respective gametypes. Each recieved 
average rankings. The need for speed trainer/patch contained features already 
included in a CLS trainer, and was thus docked half a point. Nice week all 
around from the PDM team.

 Origin finally wins on a big USA title with Aliens vs Predator. Class once 
again got this one out first, but their release was so poorly ripped that 
there's really no question who wins this title. Origin has always done their 
best to rip properly, not racing a sloppy release like so many other groups. 
Ripping sound when there are movies to cut just isn't acceptable. The Origin 
release was smaller to boot. Sorry Class, no soup for you. The other two 
games of the week were pretty soft. The Rubiks is ok, but Kotobuki is pure 
budget. Barely english, I don't know why they bothered with this one. A 
pair of patches round out the week for this group. Origin seems to be hitting 
their stride now, the team looks better than ever. Apologies to the OGN team 
for forgetting Evil Core last week. It was a 3.0 title.

 My own group came through again with the long-anticipated Mechwarrior 3. Now 
I'm not really a fan of the Mechwarrior series, but I did enjoy this one for 
a few minutes. It's definately a major title, one worth checking out. Jeff 
Gordon is not bad, but I'm still playing Midtown Madness... no room for 
another racing game yet. RZR fixed their botched trainer for TPM, putting 
out an update and a final? The trainer does work, get the final version. 
No points for these, just the half point deduction from last week.

 Class had some bad luck this week. They really should have won, but a few 
mistakes and some bad luck left them bringing up the rear. They say they 
had Star Trek from one of their own suppliers, and that they didn't rip 
the ISO. Now, it really does not matter where they got the game, but I 
have to wonder why it took them so long to rip it if that is the case. 
Seems everyone except Origin was ripping this one off the ISO 
(<][ce> What ISO?). See the PDM section for my reasons behind splitting 
the points. I'd like to know who in Class decided to rip sound effects 
and leave in movies in Aliens vs Predator. This is obviously unacceptable, 
and their release of AVP is void. Need for Speed was another big title 
for the week, but in addition to a fix, we saw a repacked speech addon. 
Laughable quality control from a major release group.

 Bud's Biased Utils Report #21
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Here we go again!

 A bit about this weeks NWR, and about last weeks, and what you're going to
 be reading here (assuming you aren't skipping this). Last week was a double
 issue of NWR... sort of. It had two weeks worth of games reports, some extra
 news... basically we were lazy. But hey, laziness is a virtue - just not a
 very good one. My report in that issue (#48) was not a double report - it
 covered only the week in utils ending on Monday May 17th. Which means I
 missed a week, since NWR was delayed a week and released as a double issue.
 No big deal I figured, I've missed a few weeks in the past, and usually I
 just let them go. However, Loke pointed something out to me recently... and
 that is in missing a week I tend to make groups who were idle the week I
 reviewed but active as hell the week I missed look bad. Last week it was
 2KAD, as well as a few others... so I've decided to make up for lost time
 and do a review for last week (18th to the 24th) which I missed.

 So after you read this report, you can go on to report #22... assuming I
 haven't bored you to death after this one. And if you still aren't bored to
 death of me... something is really wrong with you, get a life!

 Now for some fun stuff... this report, #21, marks 20 weeks of points for
 groups which have been alive and reviewed since my very first issue. For
 those groups who've been alive and kicking since my first report I'll give a
 total score score for all 20 weeks reviewed (Keep in mind I've missed a few
 weeks, and one week with guest writers wasn't scored). And I'll give a short
 blurb as to my feelings on a given groups overall performance. Other groups
 will just get the usual weekly rating with no grand total.

 Ok. There. I've put half of you into a coma... those still with me, read on.
 
 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 05/18/99 to 05/24/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.


 Groups: (In no particular order)

 Not a whisper out of PWA until the 23rd, when we saw six apps
 go out. A mixed bag, with some highs (kudos on pcANYWHERE 9), lows (Keygen
 only? come on, leave that to TNO/CORE and the other cracking groups), and
 in betweens (Sirenet, Act 2000 beta). Act 2000 is a beta some people will
 actually want... which is why nuking all betas bothers me... but I won't
 get into it. As I said, good work on Symantec's pcANYWHERE 9.0, one of the
 best connectivity/remote access apps out there, and probably the most popular
 for the average user. I won't get into keygens, other than to mention that
 I come from BBS times when hundreds of these things didn't clutter the
 upload conferences... yeh whatever I also haven't updated my wardrobe in six
 years. I am going to count the KeygenOnly/KeygenIncl as one release though...
 I'm not giving points twice for the same work.

 Some major titles brought PWA's total score up, and a few weeks of decent
 work of late helped out. Still, if not for the MS ownage, which is being
 really challenged for the first time in a while of late, we would see a very
 different picture.

 Coming off an excellent week, The Corporation slowed a bit but still
 showed a decent effort. While I'm not sure why they didn't just include
 the FAQ for Namo with the original release (might as well get all the
 explanations out of the way in the first place, or pull a TRPS and put
 "PLS.DONT.NUKE.OH.PLS" in the dir name <g>), it's still a nice little
 package. Morph Master is pretty nice, and they collected on the most recent
 Symantec offering.

 Consistancy and good, middle of the road releases - and a fair amount of
 them. They realize that you can't be a release group if you don't release -
 something a few other groups should keep in mind. Quality control has
 become something of a concern of late however.

 Rough week for RiSE... first of all, the Adobe Go Live 4 RiSE release 
 was not approved by RiSE, CORP's is the real deal. I have no idea why Ascend
 Navis Access was nuked and couldn't find Toth for a comment, so I left it in
 there... then we come to Jobboss 4.1 - if you read NWR last week you know
 the story, so I won't repeat it... if you didn't, go read it. Basically,
 RiSE seems to be in a bit of trouble these days, although they did get a
 few good rels out.

 Total: 5/10

 A quality group that's in a bit of hot water these days. They've definately
 hit a snag, and it seems the future of RiSE could be in jeopardy - but I'm
 hoping they pull through.

 Another week of name titles from SGE... total Lotus domination, and they
 threw in the Solaris edition of Domino, which I've heard is one of the most
 popular platforms as far as Lotus sales for Domino go. ViaVoice is a great
 release as always... also the 3DSMAX 3 Pre-release will give an early look
 at the much anticipated final package. SGE would have scored higher except
 the discounted Solaris app and the fact that I never give full points to
 betas.

 Well, what can I say. Quality, anticipated releases on a steady basis for
 almost all of the twenty weeks I've reviewed them. A model for other groups,
 at least in they're releasing. One of if not the top cracking crew in the
 utils scene doesn't hurt, and combined with excellent suppliers...

 XF continues to pretend to be alive by putting out some Linux titles mixed
 in with a few other apps... XF has been fairly consistant with Numega
 titles, and they once again win on Filmbox. Discounting the Linux titles,
 my pick here is Incite, simply for being the only major version update XF
 got for the Windows platform this week.

 Total: 4/10

 A decieving score... many releases for non-win operating systems were
 not counted, but many will enjoy them. If you're running a *nix system
 you'll likely appreciate X-FORCE a hell of a lot more than I do.

 SITEFORUM.Communications.v2.4.for.Win9xNT-SHOCK
 SITEFORUM.Communications.v2.4.for.Java-SHOCK
 Internal.Web.v2.1.for.Java-SHOCK

 The mass releasing domination of Shock has slipped quite a bit in the past
 while... at the beginning of the year they had a huge output and looked
 kinda like the SHK of old in the mass category. Of late they've slowed
 considerably, although they've made a bit of a presence in store apps and
 shown some new cracking talent... not bad for a group who mainly had a
 carding reputation in past years. This week was a mixed bag, with two apps
 off the shelf (ACID Style and SYSTAT 8), a raiding of SFS Software's new
 editions of SITEFORUM Communications and Internal Web, and the often
 released Bill Power Plus. The SFS stuff is decent, and SHK benifited from
 the idleness of PRM in not having to race them for those titles, but without
 a doubt the only app really worth mentioning here is Systat 8.0.3 Standard.
 Something tells me (perhaps the fact that I'm writing this so late) that
 next week will be better. 

 Total: 5/10
 Total to Date: 130/200

 Another example of consistancy. While not leading in quality/anticipated
 titles, releases on a regular basis has helped their cause. By throwing
 in the odd top title they keep in the public eye. Although they've actually
 dropped a few points in the last ten weeks, a recent focus on store apps
 should benefit them greatly.

 utils they release... so what?!? :)

 PFT does it's usual splurge of releases within a few days. As usual what we
 get is made up of average to good web apps, the best of which include
 Installshield, Internet Scanner, and Web Logic server. PFT also put out a
 working version of QARun from Segue, stating that the earlier TRPS release
 was unworking. QARun is a nice rel in any case, although a minor update
 (v4.6.2 could be found in SHK's earlier Quality Works 4.6.2 release), and
 will appeal to those developing client/server applications.

 Another groups that's dropped a few points in the last ten weeks, this time
 due to lack of consistancy. With their pre-whore tactics they may actually
 be scaring some potential members away, who may question the groups 
 commitment to releasing for quality as opposed to quantity. A strong
 presence in the web app area, however their store team is lacking greatly.

 MASTERCAM.v7.2B.FULL-LND
 ArchiSITE.v5.6.Cracked-LND
 HYPERMILL_V4.5.1_FOR_MECHANICAL_DESKTOP-LND

 Another week, three excellent releases... LND seems to have MasterCAM all
 locked up, now putting out the full package of v7.2b shortly after releasing
 the upgrade edition. If your're a CAD/CAM user (and might I add CAE/FEA/FEM)
 LND is your horse, otherwise...

 Total: 6/10
 Total to Date: 123/200

 One of the most improved groups of recent months. They've gone from
 the group everyone loved to hate to the position of total domination
 in the CAD/CAM field. Appealing to a small niche market which has in the
 past been neglected aside from a few high profile releases, they've
 almost completely rebuilt their reputation, with the exception of the
 usual verbal jarring with some old "friends".

 PNC continues to suprise many simply by staying alive... seems they can pull
 a rabbit out of a hat when needed. They beat several groups to
 MetaCreations' new app, Canoma, one of the top releases this week. They also
 put forth some decent offerings from the web, with PhotoXL, CamRunner, and
 others.

 Making me very sea-sick is the consistancy of PNC (I'm talking in backwards

 Coming off a DREADFULL stretch of releasing, TRPS gets it together and gets
 to releasing real apps. They did hit a few bumps along the path however...
 QARun was not cracked properly... while they won on the Netmosphere product
 line, they could have released those apps seperately and given users some
 choice as to wether or not they wanted both apps. It also seems they're
 releasing German apps now (I didn't list it above). Still some decent,
 if minor, titles here, and a somewhat major app in the Netmosphere titles.
 I haven't checked out the Workgroup Edition so if you want to know the
 difference in features check out the release for yourself. IntelliFIX
 2000 is also worth noting. I knocked off a point for the QARun incident.

 the consistancy to really make it as a top group - lets hope this

 2KAD was busy this week after just one release in the previous report
 week. Some good stuff here, with store apps in ShipIT and OCAD, plus
 they picked up the 40Bit versions of some Lotus releases which SGE
 declined to release. Throw in their usual mix of betas and minor
 apps and you get a pretty good week.

 and NWLib 4.5 VCL. And the usual selection of other good development
 apps. With no black marks and some nice work they come off the week
 looking very good.

 Releases:

 DSP-FX.v6.110-Radium
 Making.Waves.v1.90-Radium
 Vaz.Modular.v2.0-Radium
 VS-Transfer.v1.025-Radium

 Well DSP FX and MP3 Production Studio Pro are my choices here
 (since I'm actually somewhat familar with them). More active than
 last week, but Radium has missed some oppurtunities by choosing not
 to release titles under a certain price ceiling. And the Radium
 ceiling is higher than most (I believe 80$ or there abouts) - creating
 a large window of oppurtunity for other groups to pick up on lower cost
 audio tools, some of which are in very high demand.

 Yeah yeah so I droned on and on about VGC. Well, while they aren't exactly
 owning the scene, and they've lost a few races to LND, but they are still a
 respectable group, and one to watch out for. In only a month they've matched
 the output of most of the best groups, and while the quality isn't at par
 with some others (due only to a lack of top-notch big-name yada yada tiles)
 they're still a force to watch out for. Speaking of force, I FINALLY SAW
 STAR WARS!!!@&*!%#&@!%@&%&%#@&!@%!&!!!! I just had to add that in, since I
 waited almost two weeks due to a hectic schedule.

 This week they actually pick up the quality a fair bit, with apps from
 PowerQuest, CheckPoint, IBM, and Xerox. Thry also did ISOCOR's Global
 Directory Server, and a nice app in EMap.

 Quote(s) of the Week: 

 <Novocaine> LEAFS OWN U!
 <Novocaine> damnit ;/

 SGE dominates the last twenty weeks, and I'll mention LND as my pick
 for most improved group. RiSE hits a speed bump or two... a lot of good
 efforts this week, nothing really stellar sticks out so it's kind of hard
 to choose. The Corporation or Vengeance for mainstream (well fairly
 mainstream) releases, FCN should get noted (as always) for work in the
 programming/development field.

                                                                   - Bud

 Bud's Biased Utils Report #22
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Still alive and at least half awake?

 Lets get going then... 

 This week saw a lot of releases in the utils field, and with summer fast
 approaching, the younger segment of the scene will soon find some more free
 time on their hands. So perhaps some more activity will follow. With TK4
 back in Corp they're making a move at challenging SGE with a ton of releases,
 meanwhile it seems no one is going to make an attempt at challenging LND
 in the niche CAD/CAM market, at least not for the time being.
  
 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 05/25/99 to 05/31/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.

 This weeks activity from Corp was a result of a lot of enthusiasm -
 a bit too much at times. Three releases of the above won't gain points
 here as they're all nukes (only two actually got nuked from what I see).
 Incredible sloppiness on the part of Beck in releasing QuickCAD Millenium,
 a dupe of LND from a few months back. Credit to Beck, he owned up on it,
 no excuses. More sloppy work in Vorton Financial Tools 1.0 - this is actually
 v2.0, and a dupe of Shock from a few days back. Finally, DesignCAD LT 2000 
 isn't really valid - the Pro version gives users 2D/3D capabilities, and was 
 released quite a while ago, where as the LT version gives only the 2D 
 capabilities found in the Pro edition - so why bother with it?

 Even with all that, there's an awful lot of decent titles here, and some 
 excellent ones. The Visio Plus releases, for example, as well as ViZfx GA Pro. 
 Corp seems to really want to focus on the mass releasing of late, hopefully 
 they'll be a tad more careful with quality control in the weeks to come. A 
 good week marred by some sloppy research, which cost them a few points.

 Two versions of C-Forge that close together? Even if i gave points 
 for Linux I wouldn't score for both of those. WaveFront Maya Release Candidate
 gets half the points a final would, good job on it however. Same goes for
 any RC, Beta, Pre-Release, etc. (I thought I should clear that up, it's not 
 JUST betas I do half points for). Ultimate Toolbox 3RD Edition... yeesh. 
 Character Studio, which is an RC again, although another decent one. Nuance, 
 Discreet Logic Edit, and Cool Jex Suite are the only releases here to get full 
 points.

 The store crew was extremely busy this week, with 9 cd-rips as a result.
 They won on some Vorton Tech titles, got Caere's new Pro edition of
 PageKeeper 3 done, and threw in the excellent new iGrafx Pro from
 Micrografx. Dynacom Accounting 2000 is a decent package, and they also
 released a working, cracked version of Network Charter Pro (neither
 the ISO release nor the Harry99 ISO rip was working). Mixed in
 were some lesser web apps, most notably Office TimeSheet 2000. 
 This has been Shock's strongest week of May, and only the need for
 a repack of Mips Dataline's VersaCheck Pro daunted them.

 PFT again not quite releasing the mass we've come to expect. Still,
 some nice titles. Good job on StarTeam Enterprise Suite, since the earlier
 ST Server 4 was botched (some unknown group, I've forgotten), and no one
 even bothered with the client. The PFT crew also gets out a new version
 of Cadam Drafting, which is a fairly popular package. While some of the
 releases are fairly minor, it's a decent showing - although far from PFT's
 best.

 Now on to the releases. They pick up the most recent upgrade of Unigraphics,
 release Espirit 98, and Flo++ (which I'm not familar with).

 DOD comes alive with a new release of Norton AV... seems that's about
 it for DOD these days, a few Symantec apps are the best things they've
 seen in some time. If AOD wasn't taken i'd say DOD should rechristian
 itself AOD (antivirus or die <g>). Kudos, however, for the unlimited licenses 
 for Netware, and nice to see groups ignoring the Novell ban, a ban which
 half the scene doesn't even understand.

 RBS's cracking crew was busy again this week. Ok negative bitches first.
 MyEureka Report Designer 6.1.302 was released last week, so I'm not giving
 full points to 6.1.305 this week. A repack on Hydromax, Pro, plus two versions
 in the same week :P

 On the positive side, they get a crack in at XF by taking Objective Toolkit,
 XF generally dominates Stingray's (a division of Roguewave) product line.
 While some stuff is minor, they prove they're still in the hunt... somewhat.
 (Ever notice how much I flip-flop on these issues? <g>).

 the cracking side, but it seems TRPS has decided to drop the unnecessary
 CRACKED/REGGED/etc tags it's dir names (when I leech a program I expect it
 to be full, how doesn't really matter).

 Quote(s) of the Week: <Solar> i want it badly ...

 <DuMbSLuT> and hey bud tell dms to lick my ass k? :)

 <data-> oh man i got like some bad ass cramps right now
 <[Sketch]> hehe
 <data-> it herts big time

 Blah I deleted my logs so I have no good quotes... :P

 SGE and SHK both had good weeks. Corp had a stellar week for mass releasing
 but blew it with some sloppiness. LND did a few good things...

 I checked out Grad's monthly utils report today (check it out on the TCA
 forum)... I'm all for competition, and you should read it, if just to get
 a second opinion. Since I don't do a monthly tally, I'll give my comments
 on what I feel a top group is. Any group that can be truely considered a
 top ranked group should have the ability to not only dominate in their own
 preferred field, but in all areas. While they don't need to win every title
 and release mass amounts every day, they should have some consistancey, and
 be able to win on races and anticipated titles when required to. Which
 is why groups such as FCN, LND, Radium, etc, don't always appear to be
 in the top ranks even though they are decent groups - they appeal to niche
 markets, and simply appealing to a small segment of the user base lessens
 the competition they face. This isn't true 100% of the time of course...
 but I just thought I'd mention it, as we seem to throw the "Top Groups"
 term around frequently without thinking of what makes an excellent
 release group.

 Ok, that's it... I haven't had to write this in months, and boy are my 
 wrists tired... from the writing I mean!!
                                                                   - Bud

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 

God damn the pickins are pretty slim out there guys.

Notting Hill
Starring: Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant
Rating: 3 Stars

Well, I thought this might be a kind of cheesy romantic comedy
type flick to take a girl to. But in all actuality, the movie
IS funny, and so it's not a horrendous chick flick, but you still
get points for taking her since it is a romantic film. Bonus!
I'd suggest seeing it though, the movie is actually quite good.


American Pie
Starring: A shitload of young kids
Rating: 3 1/2 Stars
NOTE: This movie is not in theatres, only in WP by EViLiSO.

I am reviewing this movie because it is simply the funniest movie 
I have seen since probably Something about Mary. 4 seniors in
high school are trying to score before they go off to college
and the stuff that happens is hilarious. I don't want to go into
much detail because it would take away from the moments. But for
a workprint, this is pretty good quality and easily watchable. 
It's well worth it, as I hear some parts will be cut for the 
official theater release.

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

VCD Group and Movie Review

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.

Ryche's Really Biased VCD Group Report #15

Has it been 15 issues already? And Im still not getting paid for this?! ARRGGHH.
Extremely slow week this week with not much to report but you love me and since 
your dying to hear my words of wisdom, here they are.


Releases for the Week of May 25th, 1999 to May 31st, 1999

05261999 - Razor Blade Smile - Screener - CENTROPY 
05261999 - The Astronaut's Wife - Workprint - EVILISO 
05281999 - American Pie - Workprint - EVILISO 
05291999 - True Heart - Screener - Kraven
[NUKED]  Entrapment - Telesync - PR-EMPIRE 
[NUKED]  In Dreams - Screener - HighSpeed

(I tried to warn ya, it was a pathetic week)


- CENTROPY -

Sticking to thier strict regimen of one title a week, this time they ring in 
with Razor Blade Smile. Its one of those naked chicks kill other naked chicks 
flicks that we all know and love. 

Total - 1 Point


- Kraven -

Oh theyre still alive? Wow. They released True Heart which has one of the 
Tool Time kids in the woods with a Bear and a chick. Disney type crap, on video 
June 15th if you dont want to download it.

Total - 1 Point

- EViLISO -

Kind of a letdown week after last weeks dominance, but the workprints are 
notable because theyre not in theatres yet. Astronauts Wife has Charlize Theron 
and Johnny Depp as an astronaut who comes back infected with an alien presence. 
Slated for theatres in July. The other workprint is a movie I DEMAND you go see. 
If you like sick, perverted humor then you will LOVE American Pie. 4 Teenage 
horndogs make a pact to lose thier virginity before graduation. Youll love it. 
Hits theatres in July or August.. not sure exact date.

Total - 3 Points

- VHS -

(Note: I missed a release last week by VHS and didnt give them any points for it, 
and I felt so bad, Im giving it to them this week)

Total - 1 Late Point


All the other stuff released this week were dupes or on video already so theyre 
not getting any kind of mention here. Group of the week goes to EViLISO for 
releasing some movies that we can see before anyone else. Thats a good thing 
this week due to the total absence of the other groups and any great releases.

                                                         Mesa wanna get paid
                                                             - Ryche -

Quickie VCD Reviews - By Prozac
While I'm not exactly involved in the VCD Scene, I'm a big fan of movies,
and I'll watch just about any movie that sounds interesting to me. I just
prefer that I watch it for free, or it only cost me some CD-R media. I
don't bother writing out long extensive reviews. I get straight to the point,
and let you know if you should see it, or if you should pass it up. Here
are the VCD's I saw lately:

Entrapment - Someone needs to freeze frame the scene of Zeta-Jones doing
the tightropes through the laser.. MMmmm.. Oh sorry.. Anyway, so-so
movie, but Conary & Jones make a good team. Only worth it to see Zeta-Jones
butt.

Blood, Guts, Bullets & Octane - This movie is like a seriously FUCKED
up version of Resovoir Dogs & Pulp Fiction put together. This movie
has a FUCKLOAD of shootings in it. Gets good & bad at the same time, and
the ending is frigging WEIRD. Still worthy of taking a look.

Knotting Hill (Not VCD'd yet, seen in theaters) - Take Pretty Woman,
swap the roles, set it in the UK, and you have this movie. Predictable,
but still funny. It's a good date movie.

The Mummy - Yeah, yeah.. I heard, but I had to see it. Cool special
effects, but a movie script about as processed as Velvetta Cheese. See it for
the special effects.

Lost & Found - Funny at short times, but sappy and boring during most of
this film. David Spade, he's not that good alone, but this did have its
moments. Worth to see for a few laughs, but that's about it.

Psycho - I never saw the original slasher, but if this film is suppose
to be exactly like the original, I'll be damn. I was bored through most
of the film, and actually laughed during one scene. Uhm, not really
worth seeing unless you like bad remakes of slashers.

=----------------------------------=-------------------------------------=


-----------[RiSE Recap]-----------

So RiSE kicked elocin last week, as they rightly should have, after the
stunt that he pulled (see: nwr 48). Good work to them. It's nice to see
a group with a shred of integrity in this day and age... in fact, its 
very refreshing..

I hope they don't let him back in the group, but.. we'll see what happens
I guess... To all you who wrote hatemail to lester last week, calling him
a traitor and bastard, let me first apologize for forgetting to tag my
name to the end of the article (ndetroit).. The log was lester's, but to
be fair to him, he showed me the log, and my opinions were entirely my
own.. (and nwr's)..

The fact that RiSE put out a release at the potential cost of a supplier's
personal life is ABSOLUTELY INEXCUSABLE..
BUT.. the fact that RiSE had the GUTS to kick their only active cracker 
because it was "the right thing to do" says a lot about the integrity of
the leaders of one of the scene's oldest utils group..

Nice work.

For his part, elocin has admitted his mistake, and apologizes for his actions.
Hopefully he has learned something from all this... ;/

*cough*.. nwr is getting so preachy, isn't it? *cough*..

hrmmm...

....

...

Fuck The Man.

-----------[Why NWR was Late (this week)/a Concert Review]-----------


Ok.. so... NWR was late this week.. what else is new?.. 
but check out all the shit that conspired together to prevent the 
netmonkies from doing their thing... ;p

So my buddy calls me up last night and says "hey.. i got guest-listed to
a SWEET concert tomorrow night... trust me, you'll like it"..
This dude knows his music, so i figured i might as well go along and check
the shit out... It was either that, or go drinking with blitz ($2 highballs!),
but we all know i am an alcoholic anyway, so i figured it was probably
safer to hit the concert...

I get there early, in case there was a lineup, and notice an odd and creepy
fact... Everyone in line is female...
Ack!.. Its a "Robbie Williams" concert!!.. Robbie Williams, former singer in
brit boytoy group "Take That"... oh my god.. what have i gotten myself into??

I resign myself to an evening of Take That hits, like "i want you back (for
good)"... (i can't think of any others... ), all the while ruing my choice
not to hit the biker-bar with blitz0r.... *sigh*

My buddy shows up.. and we line up.. and the line grows.. and grows... and 
grows..

To make a long story short.... the robbie williams was simply the best concert
i have ever seen in my life... I expected gay little pop-ballads like 
"Millenium" (the only song of his i know), but man.. the dude was fucking out 
of control..
I have never been to a better rock and roll concert in my life.. ever..
I've seen smashing pumpkins, beasties, aphex twin, crystal method, tragically
hip, rem, u2, oasis, chem bros, and just about everyone else out there that is
worth seeing... 
Robbie Williams just goddamn rolled over them all..
He starts out with some VICIOUS hard-rocking tune, and the place just goes nuts.
I have never seen a more hyped crowd.. So the first number is over, and he 
starts talking to the crowd, blah, blah, blah... some funny shit..
and then all of a sudden, for no reason at all.. he busts out a metal version
of "my name is (slim shady)"..
was very sweet..

Sounds lame.. but... i guess you had to be there... ;p

So anyway.. I'd never heard of the dude really, but apparently he is the #1
selling artist of the year in europe, and all you fucking limeys know the dude.
He sold out a 2000 person club here... but.. in europe, he headlines over
metallica, pumpkins, etc, etc.. so.. go figure...

Anyways.. the point is.. go goddamn see Robbie Williams when he comes to your 
town.. You don't need to tell your friends.. just take some chick with you,
cause chicks worship this guy anyway... But do yourself and favor and go
fucking see him live...  This dude is the elvis/neal diamond/tom jones of our
generation.. A loud loud loud fucking show..

Blah...

So anyways.. he ends the show with "Millenium", and a SWEET cover of blur's
"Song 2".. and i am on my way out.. and this ridiculously cute girl comes up
to me and says "hey!.. do you work for a games company?"...

And i'm like... "uhhh... what the fuck?".... (drunken haze)
and then i realize i am wearing an oldschool "Atari" t-shirt..

and she says to me "i love your shirt.. i host this nationally syndicated
TV show called "electronic alley"... (i think thats what she said).. anyways,
i like the shirt... so oldschool.."   (big smile)..

and i'm like "uhhh.. (drunken haze persists).. thanks... the console scene
rules, man!"  (i was drunk.. do you expect a witty response from me?)  ;p

and she comes back with "yeah... nolan bushell forever!!!!"

was very very bizaare...

hey.. crazy cute girl... if you read NWR.. sorry i was such a dope... you are
my dream girl, i worship you, so... uhhhh.. yeah... (drunken haze slowly
wears off... note to self: submit story to lester for editting tomorrow)

Anyways.. thats why nwr was late..
go see robbie williams... and remember.. any girl that is cool enough to say
"nolan bushell forever" is a keeper... don't let her get away... ;p

*Editor who is not full of shit Note*
- I warned ND about the person he was going to see, and in my opinion
any person who goes out in public with an "Atari" shirt on, clearly is
not the king of taste here. Millenium is a damn gay song, so I don't think
I'll be shellin out much cash to see him when he comes our way. I do suggest
Ben Folds Five and Kroq's Weenie Roast if your a cali person. I'll be at 
one of them. Anyways, this is just further proof that Nd is gay. 3 key
points are exposed here.
1: Atari shirt in public(like wearing your DOD or Razor shirt on a date)
2: Robbie Williams concert(best he's ever seen?!)
3: Hot chick somehow finds his Atari shirt cool, and he does
not act on it at all.

Conclusion? Nd went home and shoved the Atari joystick up his ass for awhile.

-Pleased to meet you..... hope you guessed my name....

-Well.. Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior (www.jesusisback.com) was in
 action this week, kicking ass early, but shell problems cost him 
 weektops on a couple of good sites, including FS, and STH.. Jesus
 is current trading as iND, and is looking for a good affil with 
 some decent .fi and .se shells.

-Some sites you can check out: 
 ppgr.webjump.com    : Prozac's page!!!! a lot of good gear... many of today's
                       popular reports, and an NWR archive that is practically
                       0 second.. ;)
 tca.phatchicks.com  : Thank god he finally updated his page, so i have some-
                       where to steal news from... ;p
 union.jaded.net     : unions's goddamn page.. used to be good.. now it sucks,
                       never fucking updated..
 www.defacto2.net    : fucking AMAZING archives maintained by the founders of
                       the old defacto mags.. an *almost* perfect archive..
                       almost, i said... you know what they're missing.. ;p
 www.socalsys.com    : need shells, bounces, vhosts, web space?... these dudes
                       are scene-friendly, and got some decent deals... only
                       reason why i mention is cause the dude was fat enough
                       to hook up nd up with some action... *cough*... HAHAHAH!

                       at naked girls.. they have nice boobies.

-group moves: phoney to dms, elocin kicked from rise, mrpumpkin to MFD, glen
 quits mfd(*cough*), darkwolf to AOD, rocketeer to AOD, hawkeye to AOD, 
 machv to corp(?), t0x1c retires from RiSC, psychica to AV, and thats about
 all..

-All my life, i wanted to be... the korean nolan ryan..... (Chan Ho Park,
 pitcher, career home runs: 0)...now i want to be... the korean... godbless..
 (NWR: ... just do it...)

-Is beowulf the greatest cracker in the history of the scene???... is anyone
 gonna argue with me if i say yes???... that guy is a god.
*Side note*: Beo is a god, but you gotta give some props out there to
 the old Wayward master.


-ndetroit is an alcoholic and blitz likes young girls.. well.. i mean...
 we _all_ like young girls... so... nothing wrong there... get off the 
 sauce, nd!!!

-For all you who haven't been paying attention, it seems as tho "manifest"
 is dead, with MFD doing the lion's share of the cracking, and the phat utils
 going to Vengeance... nice setup..

-What in the FUCK is up with razor1911?? aren't they supposed to be dead or
 something?? Jesus.. they scored those 2 star wars releases, and Mechwarrior
 3, which is MY game of the month.. man.. mw2 was like a religion to my
 little brother, so.... nice.. ... Class did nfs: high stakes (another 
 awesome title), and thats about all that matters to me... origin and pdm, 
 you guys need to wake up... 

-hmmmm... after reading that story.. all i gotta say is, i am gonna maybe
 see robbie williams.. and... ndt you are either a liar, or a complete moron..
 what you _should_ have said to that girl was "oh.. you work on a video game
 show...? cool... wanna learn how to supply?"... heh.. dumbass.. ;)

-rocketeer, the shell co-ord for EPT left the group, and took a good whack
 boxes with him to AOD.. ouch... EPT ain't too happy about it, (as expected),
 and there's a lot of bad blood out there.. is Esprit on it last legs?..
 Does anyone care any more?

-Speaking of mass defections to AOD, hawkeye and darkwolf quit AV, and took
 THEIR boxes with them to les angeles.... and to rub a little deadly salt in
 that wound, AV lost their WHQ, STH this week, when STH dropped AV to become
 _IND_.. my god... can you believe it?  <g>


-But what's puzzling you is the.... nature of my game.....

--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors. We all love them, even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us- and these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, (your name will not be included), and we
do not add rumors like "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion" because 
we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore there 
is no hard evidence of that rumor. So, if you have real rumors, let us
know. Let's begin!


-Rumor has it that "tha blade" is soon to go on a little rampage... 
 back in action, after all these years.... ... or maybe they never
 left....  ;p 

-Rumor has it that the quixotical old US site, TMS, is coming back on a 
 100mbit link, with 100+ gigs of storage... Same crazy staff.. same wacky 
 daemon.. leechers, start your engines!!

-Rumor has it that Grad is being courted by RiSE for a possible LND/RiSE
 merger, for almost COMPLETE domination of the CAD/CAM scene... Grad will
 then have the option of stealing his own cracks to put out a release...
 ... Phat.

-Rumor has it that glen's mom's penile reduction surgery didn't go so well
 after all.. msg him your condolences... "Glen" or "glen-" on efnet... 

-Rumor has it that CAT is being recruited to join AOD.

-Rumor has it that Class will be broken up and dead within 2 months... you
 heard it here first!
