Well I wasn't even going to release this this week, but I needed
something to do to kill the time before I had to goto work
and SJ was prodding me, so I went to work and slapped this
bitch together. If you don't like it, well I don't much
give a fuck. Couple of things of note, NWR needs
art ppl and html people, cuz ND sux at webdesign<g>
and we want it to look all pretty at www.netmonkey.org.
Other tidbits, we also FINALLY have thor's iso charts
for the month of November, which you can get on
www.pureiso.com as well. And we have sj/poison's
monthly utils report to go with my weekly crap.

Enjoy the mag and contribute please :)

	Sites are rated on a 3X and 2X scale.. if you want to know why we 
 do it that way, read an old issue. Couriers get 10 points per site they get
 #1 on, 9 points for 2nd place, 8 points for 3rd, etc, etc. 
	Sites are rated by us. If you don't like the ratings, then.... 
heh... fuck off and die..

-----------[ Lester's Biased Courier Section ]-----------

Ok..now 3am..stats are done..now to sum up the week.

Pres are popular these days..this week is really like over so you don't even
give a fuck right? Well you get to hear me ramble anyways.


Ambition: AMB picked up alot of the pieces from the ASN splitup, grabbin
a number of boxes and I dunno about couriers, but they still haven't
really made a name for themselves on sites except for Plouf
Overall: Improving..4/10

Amnesia: AMN has a pretty decent week, down from the week before, but
still with some pre's and Drunkkid/Darkangel are back in action to
fill in for the loss of Cardiel and a few other inactives. grabbing
4 of our fucked up ass top 10 slots, AMN has a good solid week.
Overall: Steady, not enough pre's to make #1 though. 7/10

AOD: Predric is king of all pre'ing..and with Faith/Darkwolf in
action..AOD has a good presence on sites, clearly taking the #1
spot this week and probably next week since it is Friday <g>
Overall: Pre mania and 2 good couriers 9/10

Devotion: Only godbless comes up on the top 10 for Dev, which
means since he was back the rest of the team rested, and now when
he goes away we'll see prozax/od/and tc pre's come into action
a really slow week for dev, but GB was #1 or #2 on every site 
as usual. 
Overall: 1 man show again 7/10

Risc: Borg and Psedo put up pretty good #'s, with Brain
doing some pre'ing on the side for some extra meggage,
Risc is probably at the best it's been in a long long
time.

Overall: kill the cheaters and you may have something.. 6/10

Vice: I forgot these guys last week. Oopsie..Vice did some
pre'ing this week and mainly got rolling next week(or well 
this week now.) Nailz popped up on a few top 10's though, nice
to see they are still keeping a solid team together.

Overall: needs works...4/10

Well that's it..

THE NWR GAME REPORT ------------------------------ 11/24/99 - 11/30/99

--RIP SCENE

The rules for this report are simple. If it wasn't nuked on sites, and
was accepted by the scene, it makes it in the report. All groups that
released a couple times during the week will be reported.

The scores will be very easy to follow. There won't be a scale of 1-5
based on one person's opinion. Using the same formula that is less
controversial from the ISO charts, every game, no matter of the quality or
if an official addon pack, will be +5 points. If a game is truly undisputed
exceptional, it'll get an additional +1 bonus point. Patches will get +2
points, Trainers & Addons will get +1, and Cheat Codes will get +0.5 points. A
nuked or non working release will get -1. If minor fixes are released, and are
needed, the release group who originally released the rip will be penalized.

COMMENTS:
Class put out its regular amount of games this week which were decent and
some were its usual shit. Some had probs with Supreme Snowboarding, and the
fixes helped it some people out, while others still couldn't get it to work.
Chef's Luv Shack was disappointing, but a decent release, but still some people
couldn't get it to work 100%. The REG fix didn't fix any problems with
the game, which is the fact that only one player can play (while others got
no sound in the game). A little quick on the draw at times..

COMMENTS:

Paradigm wins on the race of the ISO ripping on several good games, but also
we see fixes coming out.. which isn't good, but not devestating. They also
show they can supply original titles of their own (Fritz6). PDM just shows it
doesn't matter how many suppliers or leaders a group has, a lot of it depends
on a good cracking team.

COMMENTS:

Well this time around the alliance with DVNiSO actually works, and we see
original titles come from the UK & internal suppliers for OGN. While nothing
of exceptional quality, they did show they still have what it takes to muster
it in the scene. They try hard to be a force on the scene, and come close this
week. Lets hope they don't go back to being dormant.

COMMENTS:

Well it seems this week DVN is tackling the games that were deemed
"unrippable". While people are mumbling about the disk limit being raised,
DVN puts a lot of hard effort into ripping two huge games, Wheel of Time &
Unreal Tournament. Both were nuked on some sites for being a rape, and some
have complained that WoT is a botched release, even after the first failed
broken release. We'll give WoT the benefit of the doubt.. but Unreal Tournament
had the low res textures ripped just to get it down to the limit, making
a good case of calling it a r-a.. well, you know the rest.

Well this noname group puts out the crap noone has heard of, and almost seems
proud of it. I guess someone has to move the crap out that rots the scene.

This Week Totals:

--ISO GAME SCENE

This report will now also start reporting about the ISO Game Scene. We figured
it was time to give the ISO Game Scene an overview, and not let the rip scene
get all the attention. Same rules: +5 points for each release, +2 points for
patches, +1 point for trainers, 0.5 points for cheat codes, and a bonus point
for any exceptional releases. Any nukes will get -1 points.

COMMENTS:

The ISO scene always talked how FLT was the new #1 champ, and that Deviance
is losing its touch. Well this week, they prove everyone wrong. They win
on the awaited Tonic Trouble, but the rest isn't exactly stellar quality.
But they do show they aren't gonna disappear into being another RZR. Expect
the FLT & Deviance rivaly to be fought tooth and nail.

Well this week FLT came up just a little bit short for the week. They put
out some average titles for the week, but expect this group to attempt
with every ounce of pride to be #1.

COMMENTS:

After the Unreal Tournament fiasco, RZR actually does another game. But people
were pissed they put the crack OUTSIDE the release, instead of reburning the
crack onto the CD. Sloppy for sure, but people have become very disappointed
in RZR's ISO division anyway.

Lester Fucking Hackjob Utils report #2


Fucking 1 year anniversary and what does Bud do? Completely and totally flake on me.
Yes he says he's done, but does he send me it? Nooooo. So we rls without cuz I need
something to do until work and you guys want this shit. So here it comes!
And yes I am blatantly ripping the layout of Bud's report.
  
 Disclaimer: It's BIASED moron. My opinion. So don't send me a bunch of mail
             & messages bitching about this or that. If you don't like
             it... SCREW YOU =]

 Rankings: Groups get a score out of 10. Points are given for amount of
           releases, but QUALITY titles will give a group a much higher score.
           Nukes for duping, broken releases and just plain CRAP will lower
           a groups score. However on the occasion that a title is nuked which
           I don't feel should have been, MY OWN JUDGEMENT TAKES PRECEDENCE.
           Cuz I'm writing this. Groups can also get points for any other
           reason I see fit.

 Week: Week is based from 11/23/99 to 12/01/99. I'm in the EST time zone so
       dates/times run according to it.

I used a euro site to do this..so like the dates may be fux0red

Kinetics_3DS_Max_R3.1_Win9xNT_FINAL_NFOFIX-DOD 
Kinetics_3DS_Max_R3.1_Win9xNT_FINAL-DOD 

Well, DOD did some releasing, but they definately had some trouble with the nfo and install
on 3DS Max, but you have to give the russian boys credit on winning the 3DSMAX race,
they generally do win it, but I know a few other groups were vying for this 3.1 release.
So alot of credit goes to DOD although the poor packaging job is really not what
you'd expect from a group with this much experience. The rest of the week was left with
A firewall program that we've seen many times before and an update of Expressions, nothing
fancy there. Highlight of the week is clearly 3dsmax.
Well, I talked alot of good about DOD and then I did some
digging and I find out that they fucked up alot more than packaging on
3dsmax, rumors abound of a beta? Cmon..and they ripped
all help and some plugins, I couldn't use 3dsmax
without some help guys..cmon now.

Nettools.Network.Informant.v3.5-RBS 

Well RBS continues it's trend of doing all sorts of ends of the spectrum of releasing,
they hit a number of LINUX titles this week, which although good titles are still for
linux which doesn't hit high on my rating scale. Alot of this shit I'll be perfectly
honest I dont have the slightest what they do, some y2k shit in there and a 
licensed new version of DeBussy is kind of cool, as well as the new DR SCSI. They got
nuked on a number of sites for the little Gamespy patchloader though. Not RBS's strongest
week but they are still rls'ing alot and not ignoring the NON-PC ppl with some nice
linux titles.

IGES.WORKS.V5.0.CRACKED-RiSE 
SILVERSTREAM.APPLICATION.SERVER.V2.53-RiSE 

Well, call me biased if you must, but RiSE puts out the #1 cad title on the market in
the Cimatron 10.6 final, mind you with no bug fixes, which is a first for this bad boy
in awhile. Rise bounces back from it's worst week since its revival with a nice stream
of cad as well as some mainstream apps to fill the week. Cimatron is clearly the highlight
of this week, even beating out 3dsmax in this reviewers mind, but graphics buffs would
disagree I'm sure. The rest of the apps fill out with Iges Works, and Microstation SE
filling out the other top titles. Rational soda is a word addon that is fairly cool for
graphing and charting. Rise grabs another Rational app, getting the newest offering of Rose
Ent edition. All and all a very strong week from Rise and although it probably seems like
I'm being biased, you have to credit them for a solid week of titles, tho losing on
a few apps they would have liked to have won on. <g>

Scum has a HUGE week, oh wait, thats all the same thing only
for every known printer/scanner known to man. you guys ever
hear of like a package set? :) Anyways, most of you know
that Twain is a scanning software..etc.. That covers
all that shit. The rest of the week was pretty quiet though,
The 2 major highlights were Solid View Pro and EDS Moldwizard
for UG. Solid View is top notch and tho not a new UG, Moldwizard
is one of the better addons for it. And then they throw in a
couple Autodesk offerings for good measure. Good week, but
not what scum is known best for.

XF chimes in with a little activity like usual, a graphics

Nothing huge from the XF camp, I personally was hoping
to see them grab 3dsmax and make a spark for themselves
again.

Overall: 3/10

Well bud does not review these guys but I figured since they beat out
every other major group on MS J 7.1, I would toss them in, I'm guessing
CNC is a reference to the CAD field and that's why their focus is in cad
shit. So they grab some solid titles here, though MSJ is 180 megs, it is
still in the top 3 of the week if not the month, althought it came out
on the 1st:P. Eplan shoulda ripped the SP2, but still a decent app,
and they snag an autodesk titles as well. Solid week in their debut with
NWR.

Shock has a solid week as well with their top titles being Visio2k Pro 6.0,
which they seem to be doing well on grabbing recently, otherwise it's alot of
the usual fare from the Shock team although the sax comm beta is
slightly surprising. The gem of the week for them is Visio2k tho, with
a nod to net data 6.1.

=---------[ Lester's Movie Reviews ]----------=

   Sure he's a prominent scene member, leader of the #1 courier 
   group, and former "Miss Scene 1995".. But did you also know that 
   in real life, Lester's real name is "Roger", and he hosts a popular 
   syndicated television show, where he plays a big fatass who has 
   nothing better to do with his time than go to every single movie 
   ever released?  Well.. now you know.. 


I can't think, did I see anything? OH YA

End of Days
Starring: Arnohld!@#, Robin Tunney, Gabriel Byrne
Rating: 3 out of 4 Stars

Well, I was kind of skeptical with the type of movie this is
and the casting call of Arnie as the main star, but he was
actually very good in the film and Byrne plays the
prince of darkness to perfection. Very well done and
well written for his character. Tunney is the chosen
child who will mate with byrne and bring about the apocalypse
at the end of the millennium. Arnie gets in the middle of it all
and has to save the day hopefully as usual. It's not a
religious flick, it's jsut based upon religious beliefs.
The film has a good comedic factor as well as cool action
sequences and SE's..definately worth the time to see and
on a big screen too.

Thazzit..i didn't get to TS2 yet.




=----------------------------------=-------------------------------------=

=---------[ VCD Group and Movie Reviews ]----------=

We would like to begin by explaining some of the common terms used in VCD 
releasing. These formats are:

CAM - A cam is  usually a handheld camera snuck into a full theatre. The base 
is shaky, the audio is poor, you can hear  people laughing and talking. A cam 
is distinguishable  by usually  having a combination  of all three or more of 
these flaws. Most sites nuke cams for their general poor quality.

Workprint - An early release of a movie.  These are usually stolen  or leaked 
copies of movies that have made their way onto  VCD from VHS or a  variety of 
other sources. These will usually contain running time codes as well as other 
identifying  marks used in  movie production.  The quality on  these can vary 
from bad to very good depending on the quality of the source material used to 
encode the VCD.  Note: This category is  also used for very  bad screeners or 
copies of movies that just didn't fit into any of the other categories due to
defects or problems with the quality of the VCD's audio/video image.

Telesync - Basically a very good Cam. A steady base such as a  tripod is used, 
the  theatre is empty or  very close to empty, and the audio and video are up 
to par. Although, you can usually detect some  flaw with a TS.  You may see a 
random head pop up, the screen edges are noticable, or the audio isn't always 
crystal clear. While not perfect, the quality in general of a telesync ranges 
from good to  very good and is  usually the first  type of VCD  made of a new 
movie.

Screeners - These are the top quality VCDs. They can be in  either widescreen 
(letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio  and video. 
These are made from video distributors demo tapes,  reviewers copies, insider 
copies of the film or from any number of sources. Most screeners will contain 
"1-800-NO-COPIES" or "Property of.." messages somewhere in the film, but it's 
not a  requirement  to fit  into the  screener  category.  These most closely 
resemble a VHS or LaserDisc copy of the movie. They're easily identifiable by 
their top quality.

--------[Stories from the Watercooler]----------

Ahh yes, rumors. We all love them, even though we love to say how much we 
hate them when they are about us- and these are some of the better ones
circulating around this week. Email us or find us on irc if you have a 
good rumor you'd like entered, (your name will not be included), and we
do not add rumors like "Tdpriest is having anal sex with Fusion" because 
we know that Fusion is only having sex with Xtremist and therefore there 
is no hard evidence of that rumor. So, if you have real rumors, let us
