L. NEIL SMITH'S \LEVER ACTION\ LETTER                        NUMBER 14

     ==A NEW WAY OF LOOKING AT POLITICS: THE "I" IN THE PYRAMID==

     Thoughtful individuals have known for a long time that there's something 
wrong with the traditional right-left "political spectrum", a one-dimensional 
scale by means of which TV pundits and political science professors try to 
calculate and explain, as the old limerick puts it, exactly who's doing 
what and with which and to whom.
     I remember hearing a lecture in my sophomore or junior year about how 
some individuals and groups don't fit on this conventional right-left 
spectrum -- so what we do is throw 'em out to avoid confusion. (The Gallup 
Poll equivalent is to mark you down as having "No Opinion" when you say 
you're neither voting Republican \nor\ Democrat.
     One trouble with this, aside from the fundamental stupidity of hammering 
and filing reality down to fit non-working theory, was that I happened to 
belong to such a group, those who enjoy the novels of philosopher Ayn Rand. 
I even knew some members of another, latter-day admirers of l9th Century 
"single-tax" advocate Henry George. Today, my professor would throw out 
followers of Lyndon Larouche, who seem to be either left wing fascists or 
right wing socialists. The interesting thing is that \none of these groups 
has anything in common except that they don't fit on the traditional spectrum\.
     Later on, a wiser teacher, Robert LeFevre, showed me that you don't have 
to be a political scientist (and since that's a contradiction, it probably 
helps if you aren't) to see that the spectrum other problems. Right, left, 
center, each comes equipped with a set of reasonable-sounding excuses for 
depriving the individual of his life, liberty, and property. Conservatives 
justify their many and frequent trespasses against personal freedom in the 
name of the family or national security. Liberals deny economic freedom and 
the right to own and carry weapons in the name of safety, welfare, or social 
justice. Nowhere is there a place for those to whom no excuse, no matter 
how reasonable-sounding, can justify violations of basic human rights.
     There are more difficulties: Joseph Stalin, theoretically a 
Marxist-Leninist, often seemed to out-fascist even Adolf Hitler. Hitler was 
supposed to be as far to the right as you can get, but "Nazi" happens to be 
short for "national socialist workers' party". Some people handle this by 
saying, "I don't believe in labels". But labels are words, the software 
of the mind; just because they (or their users) sometimes fail to identify 
reality correctly, that's no reason to give them up. Or to give up thinking.
     "Sophisticates" say that it all goes around in a circle. Get "extreme" 
enough and there's no difference between socialism and fascism. There may 
be some truth in this rather Zennish hypothesis. Surely it doesn't matter 
to the victim whether his firing squad leans to the right or to the left. 
But if we want to keep either extreme from ruining our lives \before\ we 
get to that point, it's important to know which one we're dealing with. 
Each uses different code-words to warn what it plans for us. Each employs 
different strategy and tactics. Each requires different preventive measures.
     A proper substitute for the traditional spectrum would describe the 
real world and offer clues for defeating any threat to liberty. The base 
in the diagram below is the traditional spectrum with some changes in 
emphasis. To account for all observed political phenomena, it's necessary 
to add two lines, converting it into a triangle.
     See why the old form is inadequate and dangerous. Most Americans would 
place themselves in the middle at the bottom, but that represents sort of 
an invisible region (which some analysts call "populist") where \neither\ 
personal liberty nor economic freedom is tolerable. Because it's invisible, 
and because advocates at either end unwittingly contribute to its power by 
striving to achieve power for themselves, it's an easy place to end up. It 
seems to be where America is headed today.
     Take a hard look at this diagram -- you may not belong where you always 
thought you did -- and see whether it doesn't answer all kinds of questions 
my old political science professor (probably yours, as well) would rather 
have thrown out than consider.
     
  INDIVIDUALISM (also, Libertarianism) Nobody tells anybody what to do. 
   Future-oriented, rational. Adult, hands-off attitude toward others. 
     Asserts individual self-ownership. Favors personal liberty and 
  economic freedom. People, neither stupid nor evil, must be left alone. 
      Typical slogan: "There ain't no such thing as a free lunch."
