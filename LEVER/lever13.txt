Dear Gil:

After writing 16 science fiction novels in 10 years, I think maybe it's time 
for a change. How's this for a political thriller that'll keep you up and 
turning pages all night?
     In the background, the Defense Department has become no more than a 
welfare system for redundant engineers and foundering corporations. The 
armed forces are an extension of Foggy Bottom fumbling by other means and 
can't tell an airliner from an enemy fighter-bomber. Against foes both 
foreign and domestic, the sole bulwark of America's historically unique 
institutions is a heavily-armed private citizenry, growing restive under 
an unbearab]e burden of taxes and increasingly vocal about it.
     The first characters I show are leftist politicos led by a senile, 
obsessive -- but totally fictional -- senator from Ohio and his colleague, 
a semi-convicted Massachusetts murderer. They form a bipartisan cabal with 
the President, an aging preppie just bright enough to see that he's the 
Jimmy Carter of the GOP, stoically determined to become its Lyndon Johnson 
if he has to destroy the republic in order to save it. Together they scheme 
to strip Americans of the hardware they find so discouraging and turn them 
back into the loot-producing serfs Alexander Hamilton intended them to be.
     Together they enlist the aid of the nation's top gun control advocacies, 
which look like any wine-and-cheese pressure group. In fact, they're 
virtually memberless fronts created by a sort of Nixonian Odessa of ex-CIA 
types determined to drag Dick -- or at least his political ideas -- out of 
cryogenics where he stored himself a decade and a half ago and prop him up 
in the Oval Office for one more last hurrah. These spooks control the 
so-called mental health industry, grim gulags where the light of the 
Constitution never shines and real-life mad scientists are free to pump their 
helpless captives full of memory-cauterizing voltage and identity-dissolving 
chemicals. The result, customized high tech zombies, are sent home on 
disability payments to watch daytime TV and gobble Twinkies with inhuman 
patience until they're needed.
     Now from time to time folks get enough of the gore electronic 
fear-merchants splash across their living room carpets every night, or fed 
up with intrusive and incessant nagging labeled "public service messages". 
Some fraction even appears to have absorbed the fact that the Bill of Rights 
means what it says and that the government's latest moral substitute for 
war is actually being waged against the concept of a free economy. It's then 
that one of these zombies gets a call with key words buried in it, "You 
have miles to go and promises to keep, Orville-Bob..." and takes up his 
saturdaynightspecial or his evilassaultrifle (depending on how he's been 
programmed this month), while senators, spooks, and fear-merchants warm 
up the public relations machinery.
     The zombie picks a convent or a Campfire Girls convention and blows 
away as many photogenic victims as he can. Then he eats his gun barrel and 
pulls the trigger one more time. As psychovultures descend on the community, 
the media make a big deal of the miscreant's history of mental illness 
without mentioning 20,000 laws on the books against his owning guns. They 
blame tens of millions of innocent gun owners (the killer isn't available 
for a post-bloodbath interview, but his neighbors all say he was very quiet) 
give 51% of their time to the front groups who built the killer in the first 
place and 51% to a spineless, dull-witted, militantly moderate President and 
the senators from Massachusetts and Ohio who spontaneously produce an 1800 
page bill depriving Americans not only of guns, but of their kitchen knives, 
keyrings, and fingernails.
     \Not one reporter asks why liberal Democrats are in bed with 
Nixon's CIA.\ 
     Anyone who threatens to point out that this spectacular and convenient 
mass-Osterizing occurred the week the legislature began deliberating gun 
laws -- and that similar coincidences have occurred in three or four other 
states over the last six months -- is kept off the air at all costs. Maybe 
he'll get locked up and become the next trigger-zombie.
     The new bill violates 15 Constitutional amendments, includes a death 
penalty for thinking about Daniel Boone's flintlock, but gets befuddled 
blessings from the Chief Executive. Commentators and columnists keep the 
pressure up. Lavishing thousands of praise-filled air-hours on the senators 
who wrote it, they also condemn it as a sellout to the gun lobby.
     Now for the plot-twist: the rich, powerful, multimillion-member group 
created to defend the principle of an armed citizenry to the death (and take 
whatever heat the President won't accept as his part of the deal) finds 
itself inexplicably weak, poor, inclined to compromise -- although the 
media characterize it as unyielding. Its official spokesmen help by shaving 
their heads to enhance an already amazing resemblance to Nikita Khrushchev. 
We don't find out until the next-to-last chapter that it's as stuffed with 
ex-Nixonites as the so-called liberal gun control organizations.
     Gil, I haven't figured out how the conspiracy gets exposed, but I gotta 
have a happy ending. Maybe -- although they don't know it -- the spooks are 
conditioned to off themselves like the zombies to give the President 
credible deniability. The senators are convicted under a little known 
federal statute for violating their oath to uphold the Constitution and are 
sent to some high-walled place with bars on the windows where the regular 
inmates treat them the same way they've been treating Senate pages for years.
     The media -- I don't know, this is where I'm having trouble. My first 
thought was, once the plot was exposed, that they changed their ways when 
they realized that their First Amendment rights weren't any more secure 
than the Second Amendment rights of the gun owners they persecute, but I 
can hear you saying right now that no editor will go for that.
     This is a novel. It has to be believable.
