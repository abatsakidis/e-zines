The Atlanta Declaration: Every man, woman, and responsible child has a 
natural,  fundamental,  and inalienable human,  individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right to obtain,  own, and carry,  openly or concealed, 
any weapon -- handgun,  shotgun, rifle,  machinegun, \anything\ -- any 
time, anywhere, without asking anyone's permission.

L. NEIL SMITH'S \LEVER ACTION\ LETTER                       NUMBER 03b

           == HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR GUNS? ==

     Would you agree to permit consenting adults to buy, sell, read, write, 
make, listen to, or watch whatever books, magazines, records, tapes, or movies 
they want, no matter how pornographic they might be ...

     ... if they agreed to let you keep your guns?
     
     Would you agree to tolerate anyone who practiced atheism, Buddhism, 
Islam, Jainism, Scientology, Satanism, Taoism ...
     
     ... if they agreed to let you keep your guns?

     Would you agree to let women control their own reproductive processes, 
even have abortions (at their own expense, of course) ...

     ... if they agreed to let you keep your guns?

     Would you agree to allow individuals to pursue their own sexual 
preferences, homosexual, bisexual, heterosexual ...

     ... if they agreed to let you keep your guns?

     Would you agree forget the "War on Drugs", to leave others alone, 
perhaps even to ruin their lives with alcohol, nicotine, heroin, cocaine, 
marijuana, LSD, or any other chemical substance ...

     ... if they agreed to let you keep your guns?

     Would you agree to respect the rights of anyone, no matter their race or 
national origin ...

     ... if they agreed to let you keep your guns?

     No sane human being would sacrifice the individual rights he personally 
considers most precious just for the sake of imposing his own tastes or 
opinions on others.

     Yet it often seems that each of us disapproves of -- and wants to 
outlaw -- some one little thing that somebody else cares about or wants.

     Little things add up.

     With over two hundred million of us, split up into countless thousands of 
pressure groups -- all working at the same time for one kind of Prohibition or 
another -- it's no wonder government controls are ratcheting tighter around 
our lives every day.

     Until now, it's been strictly a one-way process, with everybody on 
every side winding up the loser -- except, of course, for politicians, 
bureaucrats, and lawyers.

     Individualists can work together to reverse that process.

     They can make a commitment to one another to respect and defend each 
other's rights -- no matter how much each of us may personally disapprove 
of any particular exercise of those rights.

     That doesn't mean you'd have to do any of these bizarre, perverse things 
yourself; I'm married, straight, and I don't use drugs -- I'm literally an 
Eagle Scout -- and I don't even drink.

     But I don't give a damn what my allies do with their own lives -- as long 
as they want to be free and can help me stay that way.

     The one limit is an absolute obligation never to \initiate\ force against
another human being, since that's the way we began losing our rights to begin 
with.

     Would this change the way we're used to thinking about personal freedom?

     Not at all, but it would make our thinking more consistent, put some 
teeth into the Bill of Rights, and limit the power of politicians, 
bureaucrats, lawyers -- and Prohibitionists -- to control the way we live.

     Which means that you, and every man, woman, and responsible child in this 
country, would be free to obtain, own, and carry, openly or concealed, any 
weapon -- rifle, shotgun, handgun, machinegun, \anything\ you feel is 
desirable for sport \or\ self-defense -- any time, any place you want, without 
asking anyone's permission.

     The other side's counting on us to remain divided and intolerant -- 
that's how they got us where they want us in the first place.

     How do you get started? Let me send you a document, the Covenant of 
Unanimous Consent, that some feel may turn out to be as important as the 
Declaration of Independence. If you have the courage and intelligence to 
renew your personal commitment to the American tradition of individual 
liberty, I need to hear from you \now\, before it's too late.

     I intend to keep my guns -- and the rest of my rights, as well.

     How about you?
