L. NEIL SMITH'S \LEVER ACTION\ LETTER                        NUMBER 12

== NOVELS BY L. NEIL SMITH ==

Readers of my \Lever Action\ Letter may not know about my fiction, which also 
advocates personal self-defense, weapons ownership, and individualism. It's 
fair to say (I suppose because I'm not the first to say it) that if you like 
the works of Robert A. Heinlein or H. Beam Piper, you'll like what I do. If
you can't find it on the racks, take this list to the order desk of your 
neighborhood bookstore.

THE PROBABILITY BROACH (Del Rey Books, 1980) In deadly conflict with federal 
agents, homicide detective Win Bear is accidentally blown into the North 
American Confederacy, where the Whiskey Rebellion succeeded in 1794 and 
government has grown smaller and less powerful ever since. Prometheus Award 
winner. (See also "The Spirit of Exmas Sideways", \Alternatives\, edited by 
Robert and Pamela Crippen Adams, Baen Books, 1989. Making a place for 
himself in the stateless North American Confederacy, ex-cop Win Bear 
discovers the joys and difficulties of absolute self-ownership.)

THE NAGASAKI VECTOR (Del Rey Books, 1983) Is a culture with an absolute 
regard for individual rights helpless against those who would destroy it? Time 
traveler Bernie Gruenblum hires Win Bear to track down the stolen flying 
saucer who loves him. (Based on "Grimm's Law", "Folger's Factor", and 
"Grandfather Clause" which appeared respectively in Stellar Science Fiction 
Stories Nos. 5, 6, & 7, Del Rey Books, 1980 & 1981, and on "The Embarrassment 
Box" to be published in the \New Libertarian\ All Science-Fiction Triple 
Issue memorial to Robert A. Heinlein.)

THE VENUS BELT (Del Rey Books, 1980) How does an ethical culture conquer its 
"final frontier"? A series of disappearances leads Win Bear, assisted by Koko 
Featherstone-Haugh, a young female gorilla, and Lucy Kropotkin, a disgruntled 
murder victim, to the asteroids and a totalitarian conspiracy stretching
across whole universes.

THEIR MAJESTIES' BUCKETEERS (Del Rey Books, 1981) On an alien world just 
entering its own Age of Invention, a "fireman" invents the art of criminal 
detection in order to solve the murder of his favorite teacher.

TOM PAINE MARU (Del Rey Books, 1984) The North American Confederacy reaches 
the stars, its Prime Directive: search out governments wherever they happen to 
exist -- and destroy them.

THE GALLATIN DIVERGENCE (Del Rey Books, 1985) Win Bear travels back in time 
to 1794 to save Albert Gallatin, founder of the North American Confederacy. 
First appearance in print of the Covenant of Unanimous Consent.

pole with jungle six miles deep, Win Bear's great grandson Mac fights to 
prevent a terrible crime and recover a lost legacy.

more MacBear-Lysandra adventures.)

Lunar colonists survived. 900 years later, in a star-spanning nation without 
conscription or taxation, Nathaniel Blackburn of Coordinated Arm Intelligence 
must find out who's killing rock stars raising money for the War Against the 
Clusterian Powers. Includes lyrics to over a dozen songs written by the author.

HENRY MARTYN (Tor, 1989) A thousand years from now, in the depths of 
interstellar space, there will be sailing ships -- and \pirates\! Vast

his family by the Black Usurper.

somebody -- or something -- is already there. The Elders aren't human, but 
they're individualists -- and capitalists!

PALLAS (Forthcoming from Tor Books) In the persons of a disgraced United 
States Senator and a young Vietnamese immigrant, East America and the

THE 'MERICAN ZONE (Forthcoming) How much freedom can you stand in a world
