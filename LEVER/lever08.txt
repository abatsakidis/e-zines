L. NEIL SMITH'S \LEVER ACTION\ LETTER                       NUMBER 08b

                         DEAR LEGISLATOR ...

                      == A Guest Editorial ==

     How much American history do you remember?
     The Americans who drafted the Constitution had recently won a war 
against a State.
     That State had taxed them obnoxiously -- although at a lower rate than 
America's productive class is taxed today.
     It had viewed them as objects, as tools, as raw materials.
     It had used them and the products of their lives to prop up a decaying, 
oppressive, class-ridden society which many of them -- our ancestors -- had 
come here to escape in the first place.
     (It often seems today that people in the eastern United States view 
westerners the same way; it's also the way people in any large urban area 
seem to view those who choose to live elsewhere.)
While possible, that State ignored the Americans' attempts to redress their 
grievances.
     When they could no longer be ignored, it threatened them and used 
violence against them.
     (And isn't this much like the way the I.R.S. and other agencies treat 
those today who attempt to redress \their\ grievances?)
     The Americans who drafted the Constitution, in particular the first Ten 
Amendments -- known by those who care as the Bill of Rights -- were hostile 
and suspicious toward any State.
     They knew from firsthand experience the atrocities that States are 
all too inclined to commit.
     Unfortunately, that's a lesson many have forgotten.
     It's a lesson many more have never learned, thanks to an "education" 
system controlled by the very entity the Constitution's framers were so 
hostile and suspicious toward.
     Thanks to those with a vested interest in maintaining power.
     Others interested only in their own peaceful, productive lives, have not 
forgotten.
     Nor have they failed to notice the decay of a culture once dedicated to 
the idea that human beings have an inherent, inalienable right to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
     The Second Amendment to the Constitution was meant to guarantee the 
freedom -- and the means -- to defend oneself \from the State.\
     Its words are not ambiguous, nor is their intent:

     "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free
     State, \the right of the people\ to keep and bear arms, shall not be
     infringed."

     "Regulated", in the language of the 18th Century, means "equipped and 
prepared", not "controlled by the State".
     "Militia", historically and legally, describes a volunteer \ad hoc\ 
group of individuals, not a standing army, nor a police force, nor those 
of whom the State approves.
     Nor does it mean the National Guard -- the very moment it becomes 
organized, it ceases to be a militia.
     "Security" means "maintenance", not the hide-and-seek paranoia of 
20th Century conservatism.
     Nor the suffocating big-brotherism of 20th Century liberalism.
     And notice, in the amendment, that it plainly has more to do with 
the word "free" than with the word "state".
     In the context of the Second Amendment, "the right of the people", 
a phrase which comes so quickly to the tongues of both political camps under 
other circumstances, is usually quoted, " ... ".
     But ignoring words will not make them go away.
     Nor will hypocrisy make anyone forget them.
     "To keep and bear arms" means "to own and carry weapons" -- \period\.
     "Shall not be infringed" means "shall not be encroached"; "shall not be 
violated"; "shall not be contravened".
     But you know all of that.
     I know you do.
     Are you aware, though, that under Title 18 of the U.S. Code, 
Sections 241 and 242, your attempts to deny rights guaranteed by the 
Second Amendment, in violation of your oath of office, are punishable as a 
felony?
     Are you aware of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, Section 3, 
which states:

     "No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or 
     elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or 
     military, under the United State,, \or under any State\, who, having 
     previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of 
     the United States, \or as a member of any State Legislature\, or as an 
     executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution 
     of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion 
     against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof ... "?

     We're both aware, of course, that you control the State and that the 
State controls the courts.
     That didn't save King George.
     
                                              Sincerely, 

                                              Cathy L. Z. Smith
