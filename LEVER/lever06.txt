L. NEIL SMITH'S \LEVER ACTION\ LETTER                       NUMBER 06b

       == AN OPEN LETTER TO CERTAIN AMERICAN NEWSPAPER EDITORS ==

This is to inform you, in light of the editorials you've been running lately 
in support of bans on semiautomatic weapons (not to mention the lies and 
biased coverage with which you've always treated Second Amendment issues), 
that I may begin asking my own tens of thousands of readers across the 
country to circulate petitions to create a new law aimed at preventing such 
heinous abuses of free speech in the future.

     Among other things, the "Newspaper Control Act of 1990" will provide that 
anyone involved in any way in the production or distribution of newspapers 
will be required to register themselves with a special agency of the 
government, purchase an expensive occupational license, undergo a detailed 
and intrusive personal background examination, and perhaps even pass a 
certified "newspaper safety and responsibility course". Newspapers are 
dangerous things to leave lying around, after all. In the past, they've 
started wars and gotten all kinds of people maimed and killed.

     Under the Newspaper Control Act of 1990, each and every individual 
newspaper printed will have to be stamped with an identifying serial number. 
That's only to keep track of them, of course, and help get them back if 
they're lost or stolen. Sure it'll drive the price of newspapers right 
through the ceiling, but if it saves just one life ...

     Whenever a newspaper is sold, its serial number will be recorded in a 
bound book meeting certain official specifications, along with the name of 
the purchaser, his address, driver's license number, age, race, and sex. 
The public, after all, has a right to know who's reading all these newspapers!
Naturally, no one under 21 will be permitted to purchase a newspaper, nor 
anyone convicted of a felony or with a past history of mental illness.

     Of course it will be strictly forbidden to buy or sell newspapers by 
mail or across state lines. That's probably nothing you can't live with, 
especially if you aren't given any choice.

     All retailers engaged in the sale of newspapers -- we won't define this; 
if nobody knows precisely what it means, we'll get a lot more convictions -- 
will be at all times subject to warrantless searches by the authorities and 
punitive closure for failure to comply with any feature (however vague and 
contradictory) of the Newspaper Control Act of 1990.

     Special postcard forms will be provided to all retailers so that anyone 
purchasing more than one newspaper within a five-day period can be immediately 
reported to the special government agency and his name placed in a permanent 
registry.

     After paying for a newspaper and filling out all the mandatory forms, the
purchaser will be required to wait 15 days before taking possession of his 
newspaper while authorities investigate his background and determine whether 
they want him to have a newspaper. Of course 15 day old news may not do him 
much good, but what the hell, we're talking Public Safety here.

     Above all, it will be simultaneously unlawful to carry a newspaper openly 
(which we'll call "brandishing" or "creating a public disturbance") or 
concealed on one's person in a pocket, briefcase, purse, or shopping bag. 
Authorities will be empowered to "stop and frisk" anyone suspected of 
violating this provision of the Newspaper Control Act of 1990.

     \Please\, no undignified whining about the First Amendment! It's two 
centuries obsolete, and was only meant to apply to the Government Printing 
Office, anyway.

     In fact, it may even be necessary for the government to buy up 
newspapers -- there are way too many of the damned things -- and destroy them 
at the expense of those paying a special 11% newspaper tax we'll manage to 
sneak in somewhere. Hey, don't worry, this is only a temporary emergency 
measure -- \for now\.

     One thing's for certain: something has to be done -- and right away -- 
about these oversized Sunday editions. What legitimate use would any decent 
citizen have for a newspaper with that many pages, anyway?

                              ********

     As a typical American newspaper editor, you should applaud proposals like 
these. Every one of them is already in force, along with 20,000 similar laws, 
against those whose enthusiasm for weapons was supposed to have been protected 
absolutely all along by the Second Amendment to the United States 
Constitution. The Second Amendment you're doing your damnedest to destroy 
with the same kind of lies, spurious reasoning, and disregard for individual 
rights and dignity you've seen here. That enthusiasm and the rights that 
stand behind is, as we all saw recently in China, are no less vitally 
important to the maintenance of American social democracy than yours for 
free speech.

     Think it can't happen to you? Then take a good hard look at the news 
you're printing -- about library censorship, religious book burnings, and 
death-threats against authors -- in your own newspaper. Exactly what makes 
you think that your freedom under the Bill of Rights is any more secure 
than anybody else's?

                                    Toward Mutual Assured Destruction,

                                    L. Neil Smith
