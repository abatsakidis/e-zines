Welcome,

This is now the second editon of MLiR, we got a fairly good reaction from
people about the first issue, most people seemed to like the article about
the pissing on the school floors.... I guess that says something about all
you sick bastards :) Most of the articles in this issue are from some funny
things that have happened on irc lately, we'll prolly have them as a regular
feature from now on...

                       [-=-] A Kid Called Jonas [-=-]

DATE: around 1988
LOCATION: somewhere in australia

Its late at night and jonas is as usual, playing on his commodore 64 with his
friend, Mark.

"Hey Mark, i got a new game!!" says jonas enthusiatiscally.

"Cool!" says mark in return. <Jonas loads up the good ol tape :)>

30 minutes later, the game has loaded... "wow what does that mean?" says mark
while pointing at the words "0 d4j w4r32!!", "oh that means something in
russian" says jonas not really knowing what the weird assortment of numbers
and letters mean. Little does he know that this become a very common language
to him in the next 10 years...

               *     *     *     *     *     *     *

Its now 1990 and Jonas is in year 6, he's a big man, but not as big as he
will be in 1996! Jonas has grown up a bit now, and is slowly becoming to find
out what his true destiny in life is...

"Jonas, Jonas is a big big loner!" shouts the girls at the now very pissed
off Jonas <prounounced Jo-nah>. Jonas gets angry and runs off to the toilets,
as soon as he gets in the door he rips his pants down to the ground and
starts to jump around blindly as he screams at the top of his head "3y3 4m
31337 $0 p|-|33r m3!!!" <of course the numbers are not said, i just put them
in to annoy you all :)> as soon as the cry is heard a teacher runs into the
boys toilet and smacks Jonas on the bottom making him shut up his rantings...

Meanwhile at an undisclosed place somewhere under the nevada desert....

"Sir, we have picked up 313370 messages" says a yound soldier to his superior

"So the legends are true!!" says the superior officer in amazement, "Send the
copters for the boy" he says quickly as he reaches for the weird looking gun
in his holster with a BIG smile on his face...

               *     *     *     *     *     *     *

2 days later when Jonas is walking home from school...

"Stop! put your hands up and don't move!" says 3 heavily armed US army
soldiers. Jonas, not knowing what to do drops his dacks and starts screaming
those same words as before "3y3 4m 31337 $0 p|-|33r m3!". Suddenly a voice on
one of the soldier's radios screams "Get out of there now!, he's gonna kill
you!!", "He can't kill us sir, he's only a little kid", ten seconds later the
3 officers are lying on the ground with weird radiation burns all over them..

               *     *     *     *     *     *     *

It is now 1996, and Jonas is still with us <god help us all> and is walking
the streets with a slight limp in his leg..., Jonas walks into the doctors
and says "doc, whats wrong with my leg?" pulling up his pants to reveal
markings of some sort...

"Oh my god!!" says the doctor!, "you are elite!" he says in amazement at the
markings.

"And you my friend, are a lamer!" replies Jonas as he strangles the doctor to
death...

                        To Be Continued...

                       [-=-] Tips For Break-Ins [-=-]

well i've made it through another day of pointless and boring school. yay
the only problem being it is only monday <groan> . A proffesional DJ came to
the school now that was exciting. I'm not sure how many people actually
listened though. Playing shitty coolio songs and assorted crap. Well that was
my lunch time anyway. Got another test back yet another fail 38% for a maths
test, hey thats almost the higgest this year. Not to worry though cause i got
a five day weekend comming up to study for exams. Think i'll just smoke some
cones instead. boo hoo goo yep more pointless crap <just like school> Hmm
what other things can i suggest to you readers out there <if there any> ummmm
how bout lying under the o bahn tracks when the busses are running. Thats
pretty dull tho suppose its ok the first time. Graffiti nah thats boring and
not worth getting in trouble over. Getting caught there's an issue in itself.
DON'T GET CAUGHT duh really you say. Here are some handy hints to avoid being
caught doing anything bad.

1. Make sure it is late at night or really early in the morning when everyone
   else is in bed. 

2. Don't be too eager this can fuck you up.

3. Trust your gut, if you have a bad feeling then don't do it till it has
   passed. If it doesn't then don't do it. Gut feelings can be life savers.

4. Try to stay in small groups 2, 3, 4 not many more. Too many people fuck
   things up.

5. Make sure you go out with co-ordinated people. Unco's are not only useless
   but annoying.

6. If you drive park the car away from the scene if it going to take a while.

7. Paranoia isn't a bad thing it keeps you on your toes. You get to lazy you
   get caught.

DaN thought he would add some....

8. If ya gonna do a break in then, only stay in there for like, umm 5-10 mins
   as cops usually take about 15 mins (usually) anyway you just dont want
   cops to catch u inside the house/builiding whatever now do you?

9. If the cops do come and they start running after you then start running
   like you've never run before :) I can't run fast i hear you say? don't
   worry, you soon will when you see a cop running after you or a car, i know
   this from experience so trust me :)

There probably are others but i'll leave em to you to figger out.

                            [-=-] Racism [-=-]

BaroN again, geez think we need some memberz eh? Yeah prolly, hmmmmmm
yep yup yup guyguguggu woop woop poop. I think i have finally lost the plot.
Enough fucking databases geezzzzz racism assembly BAH boo hiss spit.
This issue seems intersting................got somewhere to go?
well why the fuck arn't u there?
Hmm a racism assembly? interesting concept. By having an assembly we will
elimainate racism(maybe not). Maybe i'm not the crazy one. Probably has
something to do with the way the school treats the gooks. 

GOOKS=ASIANS for those ill informed of u!!!!!!!!!!

neway Today me and DaN where chatting away during class as we usually do
trying our best to speed time up and we began talking about gays on IRC.
Now Me and DaN don't mind to cause a bit of an upset and abuse these poofs.
It seems that they can't handle the abuse and are trying to get DaN kicked
off the server which we are located on. Why do these IRC cops pity these
fags? Are they also Fags? Or do they phear the fags, thiNking thaT if they
do not help them they will be rammed up the arse. Sure we abuse them but if
they abuse us (or nebody does) we do not run to the IRC cops. We sort it out
ourselves. 

Well i'll let DaN tackle that one some other day. i'm out of ideas already.
Almost time to go on IRC. Arrghgghhhhh the modem will be stolen back by its
real owner soon. BOO HISS ......

well i'm off to do some Homework harhahrahrhahrrha very funny

The above is just the example of what can happen on those crappy boring teen
channels, this one was for 10-19 year olds... the topic was "first 4 people
in get ops" so me and baron thought we'd get ops and takeover cos we were
bored, but instead i got kicked and banned for flooding the op :)

                [-=- More Things To Do When You Are Bored -=-]

Ok if this article goes no where then don't blame cause i'm not sure what i
am writing about. This is for the second edition of MLiR and not much has
changed. I'm still broke and i can't afford a new modem <boo hoo> <sniffle>.
I'm sure you all know how a stupid idea can become something to do when all
is boring and time is at a stand still. These things are not always
beneficial to your health but why worry about things such as that. So here
are some stupid things for you to do when u are bored.

1. Chat up the girls in the drive through fast food services 

2. Find a police radar hide behind some bushes and see who is first to hit or
   knock it over with some rocks.

3. Put on a cyclists jacket and stand next to a motorbike with a hairdryer
   possing as a policeman with a radar gun. 

4. Get a C.B radio and arange to meet people who u later beat up for money or
   drugs, cigarettes etc. (not advised)

5. Take a crap on someones front porch who u don't like or bring some pre
   packaged cak with you (eewwwww)

6. Ring up a really cag bbs and write abusive messages to all of the regular
   users or sysop.

7. Ring up an asian embassy and ask if u can talk to a gook.

8. See how many times you can appear in your local newspaper for funny
   reasons. 

9. Ring your school with a bomb threat.

10. ummmm think of your own

Stay tuned for the next issue of MLiR, where we reveal the true meaning of
the word "lamer" and trace its origins back to old hackers in the seventies.
We also have a funny chat log with someone who had just seen "hackers" and
wanted to be a hacker... also, more things to do on buses perhaps or maybe
even things to do to annoy those pesky transit police...
