Editorial By DaN aBNoRMaL

Underpants. Yes  that's  right you  heard  me. Underpants,  Ok I've  filled the
monthly quota of the word "underpants" you  won't hear  any longer. Now  that's
out of the way, onto the main reason I wrote this editorial.

The main subject for this article is people who charge money for their bbs. Hey
I do that say some people. Well you're stupid  then. Why charge money   for it?
It's already costing the people  money to call you, so  why charge them? That's
the governments job to charge people for stupid things, not you, anyway it came
to my attention that an un-named bbs in the 08 area was/is charging $25 a month
for access to the board. How bloody stupid is that? Like anyone is gonna pay 25
dollars a month for some caggy board and its files. When  you can get  internet
access for the same price or lower and get newer, updated  files. It just seems
ridiculous to me. Anyway, like I've said before - if the hacker  ethic is meant
to be "information wants to be free"  then why charge money for it? Or  has the
hacker ethic "changed" just like the word "lamer" has to suit the needs of  the
elite computer nerds. Warez boards charge this amount of  money as well or even
more, this is also a bit stupid because they didn't anything  for the game, why
should you? I suspect that it's to make you feel as if you are  actually buying
a game :) Anyway back to the $25 a month  shenanigans <hi  flipside>. What will
the sysop running the bbs use this money for? Will he  spend it on getting more
files for the users? Will he spend it on upgrading  his computer; theoretically
making the bbs better? Or will he spend it on something for himself, like a new
HAM radio. I sure  hope that  no-one  has  paid this  money as it  seems like a
complete rip off and the feds should  bust his  sorry ass for  being a  nerd or
something. See you all later, I'm off to go logon  a *free* bbs,  gee  that's a
weird concept for some!

A Boring Party By DaN aBNoRMaL

Here's some details of a boring party that JuLeZ and I went to a while ago.

7:30) We arrived and talked to Sputnik 3 and his girlfriend.

7:40) Talked to Craig for a while about basketball and other stuff.

7:45) Had a cone or two with JuLeZ.

8:00) BaRoN and his girlfriend  arrived. Had a chat,  realised that  this party
was crap.

8:10) Joanna <the hostess> had a chat with us and wondered  if the party  would
get any better <errr.. no>.

8:15) Had a beer <or two?> as more and more people arrived that I had never met
before. Some chick with perky breasts was  sitting on  a guys lap staring at me
and BaRoN.

8:30) BaRoN left  after a  while with  his g/f,  JuLeZ and I stupidly refused a
lift home.

8:31) Had a few more beers.

9:00) Starting to get really  bored now, but we  thought we would hang around a
bit longer "To see how  things turn out"  well, not much more did happen. I was
too busy staring at Louise, a very nice year 9! :)

9:30) Jenny had some gin <haha> I think it was, had a bit, tasted crap

9:40) Karen <some  fat chick> was bored too and  said whoever's bored come back
to my house and play  pool. We  thought, why not so we jumped in da  car , pity
that  there  was also Mark, Louise, Jenny, Helena, Copycat, Me  and JuLeZ in da
car, so  the last  three  had to  sit in the  boot <its a station wagon>  while
drawing rude pictures on her car.

10:00) We  arrived at  Karen's  after  a uncomfortable  ride there, although  we
managed to persuade her to go round the round-a-bout a few times.

10:01) Starting playing pool, w0w! just as exciting as  before. The  only thing
keeping us from going home  was  1 - Didn't have a  clue where we were and  2 -
Louise :)

10:30) <these  times are  REALLY approximate>  played  darts for a  while, then
started  drinking one of  those BIG  bottles of  coke, all to  myself. As I was
doing this, my fly must have been undone and I didn't notice  until after :) Oh
yeah, I won pool twice in a row as well.

11:00) Went back to the party to  see if  anything at all  was going  on. Woohoo
somehow  I got Louise to sit on my lap for the ride home <I guess it  wasn't all
bad after all>.

11:20) Got back, awfully  bored  and a bit  tired as well. Then  I thought of a
revenge for such a terrible party...

11:25) Started  packing  beers  into my  bag - 1,2,3, 4,5,6!   yeah. As we were
leaving these guys were apparently "chasing"  us. Well  the hostess thinks that
"chasing" is people walking very slowly  after you saying something. Anyway, me
and JuLeZ weren't scared one bit and just kept walking home and home. Had about
one beer on the way home, the rest we chucked on peoples lawns and in parks.

12:00) Eww got home with a headache. Went to sleep thinking of Louise.

As you can see it was a VERY crap party and I hope  I never go to one  of those
again.

Slagoff By BaRoN

I've been doing  a bit of  reading  lately in between everything  else. I don't
mean books I  mean zines;  and there is an awful amount  of shit about. I don't
mean  the  content  I mean  the  attitude. WE  ARE  THE  BEST and  all of  that
bullshit. Do you really need or want to hear about  how great people think they
are? You might think that I should just shut up and stop complaining well maybe
I should but why do we need this attitude. I'm better than  everyone around me,
and why do they think this? I don't  fucken  know,  maybe they  know  something
that we don't! but the chances are probably not. Maybe cause  they are  on some
scene boards? w0w so if I get the prime ministers  phone number does that  make
me better than the average Joe  blow? NO  it doesn't so  please cut the crap we
know that you're no different. Now all you have to do is accept it ...

How Rude! By BaRoN

After reading one  of "adelaides  underground zines" I  decided  to call a bbs,
after all it said  in the zine " I'd  highly  recommend giving it a call if you
can get your hands on the number, as it is the  only bbs  in  SA that's devoted
entirely to hacking and phreaking, and unquestionably the best HPCV bbs in 0z."

So I did just that, I got my hands  on the number  and gave it a call. I logged
on as a new user (no worries there) and then I  was greeted with a questionaire
<interesting  questions ??>  I  thought this was a  bbs not a bloody quiz show.
After doing that I was greeted by a screen "system password" hmm I thought so I
tried  a  few  things  none  of  which  worked.  After a  few  attempts it read
"incorrect password" and then let me on  to the  bbs. I  scanned  the new files
<all old though> and as soon as I had finished looking and was on the main menu
the sysop broke in for a friendly chat. He seemed a little  bit pissed off that
I didn't know the  system  password, anyway  after a  brief chat  about that he
moved onto "where did you get this number???" me not  being one to  give out my
sources didn't tell him and then he  called me  a "lamer" but  shit I thought I
can walk just  fine :). He then  asked  me if I had  anything to  say before he
kicked me off. I  called  him a  computer geek  hung up <although  I'm not sure
which one of us got to it first>.

So there you have it. Don't believe everything you read and by the way I told
him what he wrote and he said that he didn't care. So in other words he is full
of shit and if you're reading this then you should go and shove your HAM radio
up your arse if you haven't already. Bloody liar... .not very friendly chap
either ...

Well till next time cya

Human Implant Chip By DaN aBNoRMaL

As promised in an earlier issue of MLiR we know have  finished our beta testing
of  the  HIC (Human Implant  Chip) and it's  finally  ready for  release to the
public. You may be all a bit worried about the HIC, well let me assure you that
there is no problem with the HIC, it  can't damage your  health, the only thing
it does is increase your bodily functions  by up to 450%! Here are some amazing
stats on the HIC ...

1) Increased Memory, now you can remember everything you hear!
2) Increased Erections, porno star John Bobbit has tried  the HIC and said that
  it helped him have an erection lasting over 20 hours, and he came 24 times in
  that 20 hour period!
3) Faster reading skill, need to  finish a  500 page  book for English tonight?
   well worry no more, because the HIC  can allow you to read 500 page books in
   under 20 minutes!

This Is How We Do It
--------------------
Now I spose you're wondering how  we at MLiR scientific research have done this
great feat? well its simple we just attach our  HIC chip to a certain electrode
on your brain. We will not give  the plans for  the chip away as we  don't want
the technology getting into the wrong hands (i.e. Satan). Anyway we then simply
activate the chip from our home made operating  system <there's no way we'd put
someone's brain under the control of windows 95>. There are some jpegs included
to help you understand just how we do it.

The HIC Detector
----------------
We have also included a HIC detector in the  archive so that you  can detect if
you already have a HIC. Now you're saying  "But I thought  you haven't released
it yet" well  actually  thats true,  its just that  before we  could finish the
design of the HIC, Phorte stole the  plans and starting  manufacturing  his own
chips. They work basically the same as our chip, except that he programmed into
them an  algorythm that  makes your hea d explode if you  don't  have a song by
Phorte on your hard drive. So that's where our detector comes in. When you load
it up it will quickly scan your brainwaves  that you  are  giving off, and  the
inbuilt doctor will recommend a course  of action for you  to take. The  saying
"Prevention is the best cure" works well here, so get  the HIC Detector running
and get some Phorte  songs on  your hard drive. Phorte has  been  known to hire
hitmen to kidnap people so he can do his evil experiments on them.

Where Can I Get The HIC
-----------------------
The HIC can be purchased from all Dick Smith, Tandy and Club X stores.
Or you can purchase one directly from :

MLiR Research Labs
PO BOX 34424837292
Campbelltown, SA 5076

Any queries concerning the HIC can be directed to DaN aBNoRMaL on the great bbs

A Kid Called Jonas #5 By DaN aBNoRMaL

In the last instalment of Jonas, we left you with  the vision of Jonas  sitting
at his computer, about to choose his next option at the main menu...

...

Jonas pressed the "F" key to  go to the file  areas. When he  arrived there, he
was greeted with a list of the different file areas that he could go to.

1 - Hacking
2 - Phreaking
3 - Cracks
4 - Warez
5 - Virus Texts & Utils
6 - HAM Radio
7 - Naked Chicks

His first reaction was to go to option 7, but Jonas thought  to himself "If
I can phreak, then I'll be  31337  enough to get  pussy without  trying." So he
went for option 2. He  then  listed the  files  in the  phreaking  area and  it
displayed about 200 or so files on phreaking. But  Jonas only had 400K download
and there was at least 2.5 meg  of  files  in the area. What  was he to do?  He
didn't have enough guts to use fake usernames again  and again so  he could get
them all. There was only one thing he could do - what  he did best - suck up to
the sysop.
Jonas pressed the "p" key for  paging the  sysop. After a  short wait, chat
was initiated and the fun began.
"w#47 j00 w4n7?" said the obviously elite sysop.
"I ..." Jonas paused, he backspaced.
"3y3 w0u1d 1!|<3 83773r  4cc3$$"  said  Jonas,  now  talking in  his native
language.
"w0w! u r truly 31337  parallelogram." said the impressed  sysop. And with
that he gave Jonas 3meg per day and 100 mins.
Jonas then proceeded to download every  phreaking file there was,  and then
for the next month read every single text file and praticed some of the methods
described in the text file. He soon became a phreaker and his name was starting
to get well known around the area. This also  meant that he was starting to get
a *bit*  paranoid <i.e.  he  won't go  outside without  wearing  sunglasses and
running>. He decided to change his handle, he  now thought that  it was "lame",
actually he thought everything was lame. Apart from him, his  files and the bbs
of his choice.
Jonas rang up the bbs with the elite  sysop once  again, and then asked him
what he should change his alias to.
"3y3 7#!n|< !7 $#0u1d 83 $0m37#!ng 31337" said the elite sysop.
NO CARRIER
Jonas was sick of this elite  sysop, he wanted  to be  the elitist in town,
not some old guy. Well this is it, thought Jonas as he looked in the dictionary
and picked out another word...
"HeXaGoN" said Jonas. "yessss!!!, now everyone will phear me, next  I shall
start up a  bbs - H/P/C/V  no "A"  because I'm  too much  of a mama's boy to do
that. And besides, my father is impotent said Jonas. He cried.
Over the space of 6 months Jonas began to setup his bbs  and make it truly
elite. It was promising, he began to  work out the user  levels and because his
mum was always bothering  him to get  a job and make some money. He  decided to
have people pay for the service of the bbs.
"But information is meant to be free, HeXaGoN." said one other user.
"Yeah but who listens to the  stupid hackers  ethic anyway, I'm  a PHREAKER
remember?" said Jonas who was now obviously getting a bit of an ego.
After almost a year of setting up, his 100% HPCV  bbs was ready for the err
elite public. The name of his bbs was "uNDerPaNtS".
He at first started off with the  default ansi's, but they soon  got boring
and  Jonas  was  looking  for some  half/decent  menusets. Then  he came across
something called an "ANSI Pack". He contacted  one of the artists  featured and
sucked up to them and bam! he had menusets.
Then one day when a new user was answering the infoform ...

Where did you get this number : From the phone book
Are you part of any government department : Yes, FBI

Jonas was  scared, he didn't  know what  to do. But  he  initiated chat and
decided to get to the bottom of this.
"Hello Jonas, we've been missing you for quite a while now"  typed the man.
There was a knock at the door. Jonas was  really  scared. Jonas wet  his pants.
Twice. He began to run but was stopped  by 6 federal  agents knocking  down his
door and pointing mean looking guns at his face.
"I think you better come with us Jonas." said  a voice from behind the men.
The man stepped forward to reveal himself  as one of the doctors from  the army
base.

                            To Be Continued ...

Fun On Public BBS'S By DaN aBNoRMaL

The other  night I  was over  a friends house and we  decided to call some  BBS
called "Shadow  BBS" i've  never  heard  of it  before  but I thought  what the
heck, it could be fun, so we dialed. It  soon got boring, but I then thought of
an idea; find the person with the funniest name or a  famous name and have some
fun. So we looked at the user list and  found Pete Smith :) heheh  same name as
the guy who does the  voice-overs  for Sale Of The  Century  and Martin/Molloy.

Big Night By BaRoN

It was saturday  night and I had earlier  had a phone  call from  a frien d frominterstate who  had gotten into town earlier that morning. We had made plans andI went over his house  bout 7:15pm.  After turning  up there  we made our way tothe bottle-o to buy some booze and go back to my house. We  decided on taking iteasy and bought a 6 pack of strongbow dry. Ok we  then got back to my house  andReal <friend from interstate>  decided it was time  to have a  ciggy so  we wentout to my backyard. While I sat  and drank he lit  up <cones and  cigs>. Once hewas finished we went back to my room.

It was then that we decided to give DaN a  call. He wasn't doing  anything so hecame over to join  the pissup. We  went  outside (again) so  DaN and  Real couldhave more cones. I  took another  strongbow out. Ok  after about  3 strongbows Iwas getting sick of the taste and my bladder  was getting  sick of the  quantityso I decided it was time for a new drink. Half  a bottle of  midori was producedfrom my house  and I  went  to  work on that. I also  produced half a  bottle ofcheap scotch and DaN, Real went to work on that.

We decided that it was time to go for  a walk so we  went to a  nearby park  andlied on the grass looking at the sky. Time passed  and we  went to a few  places(servo, o-bahn, other parks) and  more cigs where  smoken. time was  getting  on<bout 11:00> and Real  couldn't find  his keys so we  went back  to my house  inhope that he had left  them there. My dad  wasn't home yet so I was happy. I waseven happier when Real found his  keys on my desk. We  decided that we  might aswell finish the job so the midori was finished :) and most of the scotch.

We then went back to the park (parks  are great places  after  all) and finishedthe scotch off. Decided it  was time  to call it a  night after  staying in  thepark for a while and went home. Woke  up the next morning <without a hangover :)but with a sore  throat. Two days  later <while i'm  writing this> I  found  outfrom the  doctor I  have an infected  throat so a  sacrifice was  made for  thisnight out. Ok to finish up I might as well do a timeline of events for you all.

7:10 - called by Real
7:15 - picked him up
7:25 - at the bottleo
7:35 - back at my house
7:40 - sensible soccer is loaded
7:41 - booze is opened
8:00 - go out the back to smoke and drink
8:15 - DaN is rung
8:25 - DaN arrives
8:30 - We go back outside, more drinking, smoking
8:45-9:30 - computer is played
9:30 - go for a walk
9:30-11:00 - umm many events
11:00 - back to my house
11:30 - leave my house
12:00 - back at park
1:00 - walk home
2:00 - fall asleep

There you go ...cya

Exposed! Microsoft Corporation By DaN aBNoRMaL

Today I discovered a terrible secret that everyone should know about Microsoft.
I will back up my text with screen captures from various Microsoft products.
First of all, let me say that this news will shock anyone who has a Microsoft
program <lets face it, we all do>. The following information that will be
revealed has lead me to believe that MICROSOFT ARE WAREZ PUPS! yes it may seem
unbelievable but it's true ...

Microsoft(R) Windows 95
   (C)Copyright Microsoft Corp 1981-1995.

C:\>

^^ Looks like the normal dos prompt from windows 95? well you're wrong. Look at
the date 1981-1995 - do you think that this is the starting of the company? nah
its the age of the head of Microsoft. Let me explain, the name is not Microsoft
but infact Microsoft stands for the member of this warez group.

M - Michael Gates
I - Ian Jonhs
C - Craig Johnson
R - Robert Rogers
O - Ophelia Fergie
S - Simon Stevens
O - Onikawa Okinawa
F - Fred Smith
T - Trevor Nichols

Microsoft(R) Windows 95
(C)Copyright Microsoft Corp 1981-1995.

C:\>

See what it spells? m.i.c.r.o.s.o.f.t now this warez group has been around for
approxiametly 14 years, which also the age of all the members.
And look at the C:\> prompt .... is it just a prompt OR is it something hidden
inside it like a HIDDEN message. Look at it as if it is a smilie ... do you see
it? if you can't then i'll explain. The "C" is actually a pair of headphones.
The ":" is the eyes of the face. The "\" represents their attitude towards
copying programs, the slash means they don't obey rules and are the worlds
biggest warez group. And the ">" is the "evil" smiley face.

C:\>ver

Windows 95. [Version 4.00.950]

Yes, its windows 95 and version 4.00.950, lets take these numbers apart ...

4 - the starting number of people in the warez group
.00 - signifies two eyes looking at you
.950 - the average IQ of the members of microsoft

I then went into a hex editor and found the following near the end of win.com

.. w3 4/>3 31337 $0 p#33/> u$! ...

This just has to prove that they are warez pups. So that's it, I hope I have
opened your eyes to the world of microsoft the warez group, and fATE courier
for them.
