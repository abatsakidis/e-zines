     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     Editorial By DaN aBNoRMaL

     Yes, you've  seen right, this is issue five of MLiR, released  so soon
     after #4.  Anyway, we thought  why bother  waiting for cryptic to code
     the  new  interface , we'd just  release  until its done and hopefully
     it'll be perfect when it is released.

     Now  onto the main stuff,  we have  started an  interview  section the
     first  one of  these  is with  GRiFFiN of FTS, Force and Deste. If you
     want to be interviewed then leave me a message on Static Discharge.

     ID4, ID4 ... bAh!  independence  day  isn't  that great. When I saw it
     I was expecting much better, it  reminded of  Mission  Impossible, not
     because of the plot, but the way the movie was hyped to look excellent
     but infact it's just average. Sure maybe my judgement of the movie was
     clouded by the vision of Kath  sitting next to me, or to the fact that
     I  had seen  "The Truth  About Cats  And  Dogs" just  before, but that
     should have made the movie better.

     Sure , the special  effects  were  great, but  that's not  what movies
     should be about. Hmm  I thought that "The Great White Hype" was nearly
     as good, not because of appearance but for the funny stuff like :
     "Biy-i-itch!!"
     "Biy-i-itch!?!, thats Biyatch you mother fucker!"
     And a few  other hilarious parts, but yeah i guess it was a bit boring
     though, cos Kath  and Meeghan falling asleep during the movie, leaving
     BaRoN and I with thoughts of fun on our mind :)

     Anyway, what i'm saying is that don't believe everything you see. Just
     because  ID4 was  hyped to shit, doesn't mean its the best movie ever.
     Just because its made the most money ever doesn't mean  that the movie
     is good. Same with that game Quake, no, i've never played it, but i've
     seen it and it didn't look much better than doom or duke 3d.

     Owell,  cya later  and  don't  believe  everything you  hear  or  see,
     especially if its on tv.

     The MLiR Policy By BaRoN

     We here at MLiR are not about bringing you heaps of  information about
     h/p/a. Our aim is to bring you  something funny that is  practical but
     not  complicated. We are not  going to  give you a whole  heap of shit
     about boxing or our greatness. If people who think they are elite have
     a problem with this  then I have a simple  solution, DON'T  READ IT or
     write  your own zine about  whatever you are  interested in.  I am  no
     hacker or  phreaker I am just a  guy with a few simple ideas who likes
     to cause a bit of chaos now and again. I have no interest in people in
     the scene just reading this, this zine is for all.

     Hotwiring Cars & Kill Switches By BaRoN

     Ok I know this is in other mags but I thought I would write it anyway.

     Ok this text will tell you how to  hot-wire a car. Ok  first thing you
     have  to do is  find the ignition. Ok  thats not hard at all. Then  if
     you  can  see all  of the electric's under the dash you are in luck if
     not then you better  leave fucken fast. Ok  coming out of the steering
     column  should  be an  assortment of wires. In  my car there  are 4 of
     these wires  leading from the  ignition down  to a plug type thing and
     then  off to god  knowswhere.  Ok  skin  all  of the  wires  from  the
     steering  column (there  should only be four maybe five) and  then cut
     them. There should be one main cord which  all of the wires have to be
     linked too.  In  my car it is brown it  might be a  different colour I
     really  don't know this  happened as an  accident when I was fixing up
     the ignition on my car. Ok  now if you have found  the main  wire join
     them  all up to it. It  might even work if you just join all the wires
     into one big  twisted knot of wires.  All  should be  well and the car
     should start. Btw  There is one wire  which you don't want to leave on
     otherwise the starter motor will keep turning.  So hook them up one at
     a time and when you find the  starter-motor  wire let it go  until the
     car has started and then  remove it from the bunch. When  you want the
     engine  to die just  rip all the  wires  apart.

     One cheap way to stop people from doing this  is to add a kill  switch
     to  your  car.  This will  cost  you  practically  nothing although it
     doesn't  mean the  car can't be stolen it will just slow them down and
     they will hopefully give up. If  you want to stop them take a lead out
     from the engine and put it in your pocket for the night.

     Anyway back to the kill switch. This is  simply just a switch (12volt)
     hooked up to the  alternator (I think) which makes the circuit fuck up
     cause you are mixing +  and -.  Hide this  switch somewhere in the car
     and just flick it when you leave the car.  The starter motor will turn
     but the car will never  actually start.  Of  course this wont stop the
     determined thief it will just slow em down ...

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     The iD4 Ending By BaRoN

     Ok  if  you  haven't  already  seen  the  biggest movie to come out of
     hollywood then don't bother because we have the  ending and  are gonna
     share it with you. Yes thats right us at MLiR being the nice sods that
     we are thought yeah why  not so  here it  goes. You all know the story
     aliens invade  the earth  and we fight back on july 4 woohoo with that
     guy from the fresh prince of belair. Here we go ...

     ... THE ENDING FOR ID4 ...

     At the end  of the  movie us  earthlings are still fighting the aliens
     and the aliens decide to abduct a few humans to do testing.. Well they
     abduct  them and  take them to  their lab.  Thinking  that  the humans
     aren't conscious the aliens turn around to get their drill. By the way
     the humans name is Cyberpup (yes the  one from  IRC). Cyberpup  (being
     the hero that he is jumps up and flops  his chop out  eager  and ready
     and dicks  the  alien up  the arse.  The alien struggles but it is too
     late Cyberpup shoots his jism up the aliens arse. He can't handle this
     all mighty  load which  breaks through his guts and he bleeds to death
     When the rest of  the  aliens  get wind of this they retreat. They are
     scared by these  poofters ... (aren't  we all) Well thats the movie an
     inside  source  has  told us at MLiR that  there  will be  a sequel so
     enjoy!!!

     A Kid Called Jonas By DaN aBNoRMaL

     PART #4

     In the last episode of Jonas, Jonas talked with the president of  fATE
     and was very very excited. But  it ended in  tragedy with  Jonas being
     knocked out and carried off to some weird science lab...

     ... Jonas woke up to the site of his favourite computer - the c64. y0!
     exclaimed Jonas as he booted up the  computer, not  worrying about the
     fact that he was inside a prison cell, and the door was blocked by two
     guards holding rather large guns...

     "Space Invaders" said the 16 colour screen with  good 'ol adlib music.
     But before Jonas could start  playing  there was a  knock at the door.
     "You want to start the test?" said the first man.
     "Yes let it begin."  said the  second man, he was obviously the senior
     of the complex and was in charge of many top-secret type stuff.

     5 DAYS LATER...

     Jonas was sitting in front of a brand new  computer  using this device
     called a "modem". He wasn't  sure what it was really, or how it worked
     but he  liked  it cos  he could  ring up other people and log on these
     things referred to as "Bulletin Boards".

     Then one day his life changed... He found this file called HACK101.ZIP
     he opened  it up to  see this  a text  file and a few crappy bbs adds.
     "Bah!  what  a  waste!"  said  jonas,  but  before he  pressed delete,
     something inside  him,  something deep  inside was  stirring, he could
     feel it growing until  he burst out  loud "p#33r m3!!!!" and threw the
     computer across  the room  causing sparks and smoke all over his cell.
     The guards ran in  to see what had happened but all they could see was
     a smashed computer and a  disk missing.  They checked the logs and saw
     that Jonas had copied a file to the  disk  before he had some how left
     the cell.

     "What do you mean he's gone?!?!?!" said the voice on the other side.
     "Well there was a crash and the he vanished, without a trace" said the
     very hesitant and scared voice of the head scientist.
     "Nothing vanishes without a trace" said the other man,  and then  hung
     up. *1

                                   * * * * *

     Jonas was on the run, he  finally found a  place where he  could stay,
     without any fear of being busted by the feds - a foster  home.  He was
     soon adopted  by a young  couple with an  impotent father  <great role
     model>. Being  the intelligent  one that  he  is,  Jonas  asked  for a
     computer, and his wish came true. The  first  night he got it, he  put
     that oh-so familiar disk into the drive and read the text file...

     Soon, Jonas realised what his  true purpose in life was - to be 31337,
     there was mention of the elite people in  "the  scene" call  something
     called an underground bbs.

     At first he logged onto the  bbs  under his  real name, the sysop soon
     broke into chat and commented on his great alias.
     "But I don't have an alias, oh yeah what's an alias?"
     NO CARRIER
     He tried again, and again and again but all attempts gave him the same
     message: NO CARRIER. After a while he got  USER LOCKED OUT  OF SYSTEM.
     So he decided to ask his new parents what an alias was.
     "Well  its a name that criminals  or people  who don't like  their own
     name  use, it can also be called a handle if  you  are  talking  about
     computers." said his dad while watching one of those impotency adverts
     with a slight tear in his eye.

     Jonas knew what to do now, he would logon to  the  underground bbs and
     show the world that he was elite.

     PTPHEX - Protocol For The Future By DaN aBNoRMaL

     Hi , and  welcome  to  an  important  announcement  that can and  will
     revolutionise the way files are transferred.

     PTPHEX (or Person To Person HEX) is the new transfer protocol  that is
     being tested by the members of MLiR and other groups around  the world
     like ACiD  Productions and fORCe. Here are some stats and  comparisons
     on PTPHEX ...

     Transfer Time: <150K File, 14.4K>
     ZModem - 1 min 24 sec
     PTPHEX - 15 mins 5 sec

     Efficiency:
     Zmodem - 95%
     PTPHEX - 100% (assuming the person makes no errors)

     Ok.. so  these stats might not look to good for PTPHEX, but we haven't
     told you best thing about it yet. The best thing is that for PTPHEX to
     work, you don't need a modem to operate it, no program is required for
     PTPHEX to work. I will explain PTPHEX'S requirements.

     Requirements
     -=-=-=-=-=-=
     For two people to transfer files via PTPHEX, they will both need:

     A HEX Editor such as Hexed, Hexcalibur or Hexpert.
     Their computers need to be compatible with each other (i.e. IBM->IBM)
     A phone line (no modem required!)

     That's it!

     Method
     -=-=-=
     For PTPHEX to work, the sender has to open a hex editor (see above for
     more  details)  and then  open the  file he wants  to send. The sender
     should then ring up the person who wants that file.  The receiver will
     then open his hex editor, and create a new file. From  then its pretty
     simple for PTPHEX to work, the sender reads  out each  hex byte to the
     receiver who types them into his hex editor. Once the file is complete
     the receiver will be able to  run  the  file. Because  of the way that
     PTPHEX is used,  it is a  multi-directional protocol, meaning that the
     user can send as  well as download while on the phone. All you have to
     do is take turns when reading out hex bytes.

     About PTPHEX
     -=-=-=-=-=-=
     PTPHEX  was  developed in the  MLiR  labs  and has been  tested for 16
     months now. We have managed to iron out all the bugs apart from  one -
     the  speed , we  have  noticed that  transfers do  take a long time to
     complete and we are currently  researching  new  ways  to speed up the
     reading and writing  process of PTPHEX. We are currently  using a Beta
     version of the HIC (Human Implant Chip) which is a small chip attached
     to the electrodes of the brain, which stimulate reading responses. All
     members of MLiR have  been  implanted with one, and none of us seem to
     be showing any signs of mental disorder. So  far  the HIC has increase
     our reading and writing skills up to 350%! DaN is now able to type 345
     words per minute while BaRoN has managed to read a 500 page book in 20
     minutes. Also, the HIC can not  only be  used  reading and writing, It
     has many other  advantages  such  as  Solitaire  - we have  managed to
     finish  Solitaire on  standard mode in 56 seconds, our previous record
     was 100 seconds. Other examples include:

     ˙ Increased Agility (upto 50% increase)
     ˙ Increased Memory (regain all those lost brain cells due to alcohol)

     The HIC should be ready within the next 2 months so look out for a
     complete overview in an incoming issue of MLiR.

     PTPHEX FAQ'S
     -=-=-=-=-=-=
     Q. Do I need a modem for PTPHEX?
     A. No, you only need a computer and a phone line

     Q. Will PTPHEX get me more pussy?
     A. Yes it has been proven, within the last week DaN and BaRoN have had
     sex over 24 times. (not with each other)

     Q. Will PTPHEX make me 31337?
     A. Yes, thats the other side effect we couldn't help, we think it  may
     have something to do with the quality of PTPHEX.

     Q. Is PTPHEX secure?
     A. Yes

     Q. When can I get my own HIC?
     A. As soon as it is released to the public.

     Finally, here are some details about the makers of PTPHEX.

     Developers
     -=-=-=-=-=
     DaN aBNoRMaL (Initial idea and design)
     BaRoN (Head of testing)

     Testers
     -=-=-=-
     DaN aBNoRMaL, BaRoN, Cryptic, JEz, Raver, Phorte, JuLeZ and Motiv.

     The Future?

     Annoying Trans Adelaide By DaN aBNoRMaL

     OK, most of you know about the usual graffiti that people seem to do -
     you got the tags, pieces <which always remind me of ansi  art :)>  and
     prolly some  others that I  can't remember  this time of the  night...

     Anyway, we thought, well those have all been done before haven't they?
     hmm we need something new... how about instead of your tag, how  about
     some  obscene words  or phrases  such as "MIKE HUNT IS  FAR CANARY" or
     "MIKE HUNT IS  RED" of course  you can come up with some "pictures" of
     the not so tasteful kind.  Basically  anything goes in this  category,
     for example you could draw some pics of penises or cunts, how about an
     ejaculating penis? thats  bound to get those  tourists that sit at the
     front of  the bus  taking  photos going. Or  maybe a big arse up there
     taking a crap? hmm if you're a good drawer then maybe you can get back
     at an ex-girlfriend or enemy by drawing someone giving head or  taking
     it up the arse and write their name in BIG letters underneath the pic.

     Oh well there's some ideas for you... Have Fun and make sure you don't
     get caught...

     Also, another thing to  do is  get the biggest, blackest,  homie-g'est
     jacket you can find (make sure it has a hood). And just  stand next to
     the  tracks  (not on  them  silly), and  make lots of  those weird arm
     movements that  rappers like  Snoop Doggy Dogg or Coolio would use. Or
     maybe  you can  combine this with  a full moon  <snigger> to  make the
     effect more noticeable.

     The Masterplan By BaRoN

     THE NIGHT - FRIDAY
     THE TIME - Some time round 10pm
     THE PEOPLE - DaN, JuLeZ, DaV0, BaRoN

     Well it was Friday night and after DaV0 driving to his basketball game
     in Pt Adelaide we where in need  of something  to do. Bowling  was the
     first plan so off we  went to the  bowling alley. After getting beaten
     in both  games  we went   to an old persons  culdersac  type place and
     shouted general abuse at the top of our lungs for no specific reason.

     Off to get some  food to  eat and we  went to a rather  large car park
     where I had some trolley  rides. After  that we  then used  the car to
     catapult trolleys all over  the place. If  you haven't  done this  you
     should try. Great way to kill boredom (and trolleys).

     We then went to a school to have some fun. After  driving into the car
     park and  seeing a pole  blocking  our way  our hopes  where dampened.
     "Hang on" I  said  as I  went to  check  the  pole. I  could soon hear
     laughter in the car as I removed the pole  blocking our way and jumped
     back  into the car. We where off to the shitty bogged oval. DaV0 drove
     the car into the oval and proceeded to do some donuts as we al l had a
     laugh. Once that was done we got out of the car to assess the  damage.
     Four  wheel  tracks had  been left  a good 10cm into the oval. We then
     left  the  school  replacing the pole which had previously blocked our
     way.

     Back to my house to get some tools from my car and we where off again.
     JuLeZ was dropped home and the  remaining three  of us headed  towards
     the drive in. With three pairs of  pliers and 60 metres of wire on me,
     we went to the drive  in. It was now  about 1:00am. DaV0 parked up the
     road and we checked  out the  perimeter fence looking for a good place
     to cut the fence for easy  entry.  After looking  at the  barb wire we
     had a better look and revealed two fences. Although we had to get past
     this looked much easier so we had a go. The fence was already loose so
     we yanked it  looser as we  all made our way past the first fence. All
     that stood in  our way was a gate with a padlock. The gate didn't look
     threatening so I  jumped up onto the lock so I could get over. At that
     moment we noticed  someone walking past and I jumped down (making more
     noise) and stayed  out of view  with  the  others.  SHIT  SHIT SHIT It
     seemed like we hadn't  been  noticed  but we  didn't want to  take any
     chances so we left. Before  we went  back  though I noticed some wire.
     Out came the good old pliers I wasn't leaving empty handed.

     Well that was basically the end of the night as DaN had a headache and
     my throat hurt from all of the yelling. Not the best night out but not
     a failure either.

     MLiR Interview By DaN aBNoRMaL

     This issue we  interview GRiFFiN/FTS/FoRCe/DeSTe.  All answers are  in
     unedited form. We hope you enjoy them :)

     1) Favourite Style Of Music

     My mostest  faivouraite styles of music  would have to be  Hip-Hop and
     Jungle. I  love my  Hip-Hop, been  into the stuff since i was ten, and
     for me, Junglist is jus taking Hip-Hop  to the  next level, the styles
     have so many similarities, and Jungle borrows a lot from Hip-Hop.

     2) Favourite Food

     Oooh, ummm ..I love Tee-Vee snacks, those things rox0r! I like lasange
     (how however  you spell  the fucker),  Twizzlers,  umm ..Minties, pork
     chops, ribs, steak, and these Fijian sweet potatoe things.

     3) Describe your perfect woman

     Myself with  tits :) Hehehe  nah, on  the real, she would have to be a
     *FINE* chick I know called Rachel  Mehaffey. Damn  she is a hunni, I'm
     fuckin crazy  over her,  half those  tunes I  write  are for her! Been
     wanting her since year eight! MAN she is sweet!

     4) If you had a gun with only one bullet, who would you shoot

     Vanilla  Ice. Because  he has fucked up  Hip-Hop over  here  so  much,
     everyone  thinks  that all  people  that  listen to  Hip-Hop  are like
     Vanilla Ice. That punk has  to go. If  he  was unavaliable  however, I
     would ask for a bullet with some real nasty explosives in the tip, and
     shoot 2-Unlimited, because they have done for techno  what Vanilla Ice
     has done for Hip-Hop.

     5) Situation #1: You're at a party, there is this girl with  huge tits
        trying to come on to you. There is also a geeky guy across the room
        looking at you, you  are holding a cucumber  and deep heat. What do
        you do?

     Well, as tempting as it is  to root the geek, I would  have to go with
     rooting the chick with huge tits. It  is a common fact  that Deep Heet
     combined with a fresh cucumber makes a mad aphrodiziac; I would simply
     smother the cucumber in the Deep Heat, make the chick  consume it, and
     proceed to thrust away. Nothing  going against  the geek, I jus prefer
     guys with bigger calculators :)

     6) Situation #2: If aliens landed at your house and asked  to be taken
        to your leader, who would you lead them to?

     Probably either Goldie or KRS-ONE. Goldie is  jus a ledgend, he  makes
     some of  the  bestest jungle  IMO; all  those people  who say  he is a
     sellout, FUCK YOU! There is  a  difference  between being  successfull
     and  selling  out.  And jus  because  he don't  make aggressive music,
     doesn't mean it's  not hardcore. KRS-ONE. Well, the guy is jus unreal;
     over a decade in Hip-Hop and he is still going strong!

     7) Situation #3: You wake up in the morning to discover that your dick
        has relocated itself to your forehead, What do you do?

     Proceed to give girls head. (sorry, I had to say it).

     8) Favourite Drink

     Aviation Fuel

     9) Do you smoke (what do you smoke?)

     I love weed, cigars (good creamy ones) and the very occasional cone of
     daytura. Only last time I tried smoking daytura I went blind for a few
     hours :)

     10) Do you like mlir

     No, it sucks dogs balls. You can all kiss my skinny black ass.

     11) What do you think can be improved with life in general

     I feel that old people trying to act young by  listening to  MC Hammer
     and wearing  fluro  coloured clothes  should be locked away in a  dark
     cell. All  toys should  be free, expecially MicroMacines and those new
     Star Wars toys. All adverts, TV show themes attempting to make a "Rap"
     theme song should be  shut down and  have their  broadcasting liscence
     revoked, and  scientists  should take up research in to why males have
     nipples.

     12) What BBS'S are you on

     Well, when I can connect, I go  on  Morbid  Incite 2, otherwise I call
     The Abyss, Kewl 4 Katz, The Temple, and occasionally, the Distributor.
     I sometimes  call  Room  101, but  as we  all well know, MZ  is a lazy
     bastard, and as a result, the board is practically dead :)

     13) Do you run a BBS? <name, etc etc>

     Not as yet, but I'm  hoping to  get one up soon (I know I keep  saying
     this, but now I have the files online, the system is almost completely
     set up, and I already have a new menu set  being done). So, umm ..look
     out for that one :)

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     Ok, thats it  for issue #5  of MLiR. We  will  continue with this text
     format till the coding for the MLiR executable  is done. Also , we may
     not be releasing MLiR  as often next  issue, cos of year 12  exams and
     all that crap that  goes  with it. But  knowing me and BaRoN, we won't
     bother studying for them :) In  next issue we  will have an  interview
     with erm... not sure yet :) But yer and a few more goodies as usual.
