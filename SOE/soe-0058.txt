   Our readers will recall that Sloths over Ethiopia published a rant written
      by Swedish keyboardist Jens Johansson about what he fucking hates in
   keyboarding today in issues #0054-#0056, as well as a response from Robert
   Bennett in issue #0056 and a rebuttal from Mr. Johansson to Mr. Bennett in
    issue #0057.  The following is Mr. Bennett's rejoinder to Mr. Johansson.

  i don't know what this proves, except that you (or your "text analysis"
  program) can't spell the word "character" properly.

  yeah, i was probably a bit harsh. but shouldn't a guy into schnittke,
  zappa, stravinsky et al be a bit more open-minded?

  Mr. Johansson delivered these closing comments
                                        in response to Mr. Bennett's rejoinder
         to Mr. Johansson's rebuttal

  It was a quick hack. Your text generation algorithm seems to have problems
  capitalizing!

  > yeah, i was probably a bit harsh. but shouldn't a guy into schnittke,

  Yeah! I would have thought! Why the hostility!? It's only a piece of text.
  Jeez! I have your domain blocked now, to ease your suffering.

  Anyway, IRT key solos, I advise you to play long, meandering lines. Play
  faster than you're able to. Be sure to react slowly to chord changes,
  defend it as "bitonality". Lastly, use a lame, stock digital synth patch
  that will fry the ears of your listeners. Good luck! :)
