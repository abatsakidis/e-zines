        HOW TO OPEN THE INTERNET TO THE HOME PAGE FOR THE WORLD WIDE WEB
      
  $$ $$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$ $$$ $$$$ $$ $$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$ $$$ $$$

  1.  Turn on your computer.  This is easily accomplished by pressing the
      button on the front of your computer.  It is possible that your computer
      has a switch instead of a button, or that the button (or switch) is not
      located on the front of your computer.  It is also possible that there
      are multiple buttons on the front of your computer, especially if you
      have a CD-ROM drive or a disk drive.  If you do not have a computer that
      possesses exactly one button that is located on the front of the system,
      then you need to buy a new computer.

  2.  If your monitor does not automatically turn on with your computer, then
      you must press the button on the front of your monitor.  Refer to the
      directive for turning on your computer.  If you have difficulty turning
      on your monitor, then you need to buy a new computer.

  3.  The computer will boot up to WINDOWS.  Once this is successfully
      accomplished you must log on to your Internet Service Provider.  There
      should be a green triangle with a circle in the middle on your screen.
      Move your mouse pointer around until it is on top of this triangle, then
      quickly press your right mouse button twice in sequence.  If this does
      not work, try it again.  If it still does not work, or if you do not
      have a triangle on your screen, then you need to buy a new computer.

  4.  Do what the computer tells you to do.  It now controls you.  If it does
      not have control over you, then you need to buy a new computer.
