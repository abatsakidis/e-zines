  Clearly there is some vile, malicious person roaming the Internet.  Not only
  have several helpless Internet-using innocents been subscribed against their
  wishes to various sundry mailing lists, now Mexican citizens have started to
  go insane because some vile fiend, perhaps the very same, has managed to tap
  their accounts, without their very KNOWLEDGE, even, and implant some hideous
  and maddening mind-altering device.  Take note:  GOMEZ, an individual we see
  can certainly speak and write in English, could not come anywhere close to a
  proper sentence structure, and in fact he made no sense whatsoever.

  Be very, very careful.  You may be next.
