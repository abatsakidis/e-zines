         Sloths over Ethiopia is a dto [doomed to obscurity] production

                 Sloths over Ethiopia welcomes all submissions.
        Why should we be picky when we're so blatantly fucking terrible?

     All Sloths over Ethiopia releases will be less than 5k, for no reason.

           You can reach Sloths over Ethiopia by mailing dto@dto.net,
         the official address of dto [doomed to obscurity] productions.

       Check out other releases by dto [doomed to obscurity] productions,
    which are guaranteed to be better than anything in Sloths over Ethiopia,
                      which is just pretty fucking stupid.
