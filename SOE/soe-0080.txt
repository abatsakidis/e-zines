  Dear List-owner/Moderator,

  As of 01/08/2000, your ONElist email group, deth,
  is marked as inactive.  Our records show that this group doesn't meet
  minimum membership requirements or hasn't been used in the past 90 days.

  IMPORTANT: If you wish to reactivate this group, you need to take action as
  described in this message.  If you do nothing, your group will automatically
  be removed in 30 days, and all data deleted.

  ONElist Inactivity Policy

  ONElist email groups with 2 or fewer members *OR* no message activity over a
  90 day period are classified as inactive.  This policy applies to groups
  that are older than 90 days.  When a group is classified (in ONElist's sole
  discretion) as inactive, ONElist notifies by email the list-owner (and
  moderators who have the privilege to change group settings).  INACTIVE
  GROUPS HAVE 30 DAYS TO BECOME ACTIVE OR THE GROUP AND ITS DATA, INCLUDING
  MESSAGE ARCHIVES, WILL BE PERMANENTLY REMOVED FROM THE ONELIST DATABASE.

  Why do we do this?
  In order to continue providing the Internet's best email groups, ONElist
  periodically removes groups that appear to be inactive.  Our members
  appreciate browsing and joining groups that are active.

  What you need to do

  - If you want to reactivate your group

    To reactivate your group, simply make use of our service.  Try inviting a
    few new members, or starting a fresh discussion topic.  It's easy, it's
    fun and it's free!  We will not notify you when your group is reactivated.
    To view your group, click here:
    http://www.onelist.com/community/dummercon

  - If you want to delete your group
    click here > http://www.onelist.com/settings/dummercon
    If you are not using this group, you can delete it today by going to the
    URL shown above and clicking the "Delete this Community" button on the
    right-hand side of the page.  You will need to sign in as the list-owner/
    moderator of this group to access this page.

  - If you have a 'seasonal' or 'intermittent' group
    click here > http://www.onelist.com/update?a=1497062.58255422
    ONElist recognizes that some groups are seasonal in nature and may have
    long periods of inactivity before becoming active again.  If this
    describes your group, or if you'd like another 90 days to reactivate your
    group, click on the above URL.  After 90 days, we'll check your group
    again.

  - What happens if you do nothing

    If you do nothing, your group will be removed in 30 days.   ALL DATA,
    INCLUDING MESSAGE ARCHIVES, WILL BE PERMANENTLY DELETED.  You may receive
    a second notice shortly before your group is removed.
