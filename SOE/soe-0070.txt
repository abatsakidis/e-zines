   We at Sloths over Ethiopia, ever acute of what is "hip" in modern culture,
     will present irregular vegetarian recipes for our non-animal consuming
   readers.  Completely unknown chef Stephanie Brown offers us this delicacy:

  $$ $$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$ $$$ $$$$ $$ $$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$ $$$ $$$

  ingredients:

  2 tablespoons peanut butter
  1 tablespoon jelly or jam of your choice(i prefer grape)
  2 pieces of whole wheat bread
  1 butter knife
  1 plate
  2 napkins

  1.  place both slices of bread on the plate
  2.  open the peanut butter jar
  3.  using the knife, spread the 2 tablespoons of peanut butter on both
      pieces of bread, about half on each slice.
  4.  wipe the knife off with the first napkin(you dont want to get peanut
      butter in the jelly jar)
  5.  open the jelly jar
  6.  using the wiped off knife, spread the jelly on ONE slice of the already
      peanut buttered bread
  7.  carefully lift the un-jellied slice of bread
  8.  violently smoosh the two slices of bread together
  9.  place the second napkin on your lap because the jelly WILL slide out
      when you eat it.
  10. say, outloud, "thank you stephanie"
  11. eat

  there are many variations to this recipe.  some people choose to use white
  bread, or perhaps honey instead of the jam or jelly, and some people
  actually use the goobers peanut butter/jelly combo that comes in a jar....
  this, if you ask me, is blasphemy because the art of this dish is in the
  application of both SEPERATE foods.

  for more great recipes like this one, read my book, ''Dining Well:  How NOT
  To Do It"
