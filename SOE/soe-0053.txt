  Some people take their eating habits very personally. Often, this
  is understandable if they are a chef and personally pour their
  creative soul into each item they prepare, or if they are a
  vegetarian bent on saving the world by changing the menu.
  Sometimes though, perfectly normal human beings can be transformed
  into raving lunatics if they are faced even with the notion that
  some people eat differently. These are the people who find skim milk
  morally wrong. They will argue for hours that there is only one
  correct way to make macaroni and cheese, or that a grilled cheese
  sandwich has become uningestible slop if it is cut horizontal instead
  of diagonal. If faced with the issue of vegetarianism they will go to
  great lengths to justify why every one on the planet MUST consume as
  much meat as possible. Science, evolution, and the Holy Bible clearly
  dictate what that Ketchup may be applied to, and we are all strictly
  forbidden from partaking of iced-tea in the winter or egg-nog in
  the summer. Most of us know people like this or are like this
  ourselves. And to these people I dedicate my lunch today:
  Mayonaise and Peanut Butter on White with a side of Jello. The kind
  with fruit in it. And to drink? A tall glass of luke-warm water!

   Although we at Sloths over Ethiopia are more than willing to accept people
    whose lifestyles are differing from others, and, indeed, we will happily
    release most any text file submitted to us, we feel it is appropriate to
  note to our loyal readers that Uberfizzgig is an incredibly sick individual.
    The sheer sin of consuming the dreaded mayonaise (mayonnaise to some) is
  sufficiently grotesque; engorging in said substance with the pure, wholesome
  butter of peanuts is indescribably repulsive.  We at Sloths over Ethiopia do
   not condone such behavior and would prefer not associating with your kind,
     but we will, of course, support your right to be a sick, sick bastard.
