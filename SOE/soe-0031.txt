        yep, a rare reject from the once fine institution known as BLaH.

  $$ $$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$ $$$ $$$$ $$ $$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$ $$$ $$$

  Here I am, last night of spring break writing this BLaH file.  Oh well.  To
  keep me company, I've bought 2 liters of Pepsi, a coupla glasses, some
  cherry liquid for the coke , and WXRT to entertain me for my last spring
  break night.


  Have you ever noticed that words end?

  I like pink skirts.

  Yesterday, I went to the fish market.


  Well, that's on my mind.  BLaH is based on telling all the strange things
  hovering in your head RIGHT?  Well here goes.

  Haven't you ever wondered what happened to that old guy on Different
  Strokes?  You know, that lame Facts Of Life show rip off? Well, my friend,
  who happenes to be a girl, said he is kinda hot. ?????

  Speaking of a friend that is a girl, that annoys that hell out of me.  How
  come woman can say, "Oh, she's my favorite girlfriend," and not look like a
  lez <"Not that there's anything wrong with that!" - Seinfeld :) >.  If GUYS
  say, "Oh, he's/she's my favorite boyfriend/girlfriend," they're immediatley
  having a relationship. What the hell?  I feel like shit with tapeworms in
  it.

  Also, what's the deal with Facts Of Life?  Anyone with a sound card has
  seen this demo by Witan.  Do we give a fuck that you guys look like loosers
  with no lives?  Come on, no one wants to stare at your ugly looking scanned
  face on my nice SVGA screen.  That entire demo is stupid.  The only good
  part is the end, and even the music isn't that great.  That's TECHNO you
  idiots!  Not HOUSE!!!  Get fuckin' life.  (By the way, they'll probably
  never see this, 'cause they're of course in Europe somewhere over in Lala
  land with their Amigas.)

  Hey, I'm just being angry 'cause of the cherry pepsi :).  I'll say
  something positive.  ANARCHY 4-EVER!  There.  I hope I pleased all you
  weird anarchists.

  Has anyone tried the masochism tango?  Or can anyone do the Time Warp from
  the Rocky Horror Picture Show?  Who says Kim should just screw herself in
  Miss Saigon?

  Hatred is the only thing that keeps us together. <--WXRT

  "Uh, I'm on the air?" <----Shannon

  "Do you know a guy named Hose?"  <----Dave Anton

  "Uh, yeah..."  <---Shannon, you weirdo!

  "Well, this is from him to you!" <Weird B-Day Song>

  "Well, what B-Day is this?"  <--Dave

  "Um, my 16th!" <--Shan

  "<Weird Cat Noises>  Congrats!"  <---Dave

  ...Skipping some boring stuff...

  "So are you planning a double suicide?"  <----Dave

  "DAVE!!!" <----Some Guy In The Mixing Booth

  "J/K, it's going so BAD"  <---Dave

  "Don't worry, I just luv pens" <--Where are we?

  This B-Day call to WCBR (another great radio station) totally
  screwed it up...it was great anyway.

  Actually, the point of this entire file was to ask BLaH people...should we
  go beyond tfiles?  I say we put together a mix of everything we can
  find...I mean an audio mix.  What do you all say?

  I LUV YOU HERB even though I don't know you.

  This file was too big, so we cropped the self-degrading information section.
