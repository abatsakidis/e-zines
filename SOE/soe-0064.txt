   It may be difficult to appreciate the following poem without having a clue
         what CHANNEL ONE is and who ANDERSON COOPER is.  We apologize.

  $$ $$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$ $$$ $$$$ $$ $$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$ $$$ $$$

  Ode to Anderson

  Cooper, Cooper, do not cry,
  And leave the apple of my eye.
  and if, by chance, you have to pee,
  please, oh please not on Raweley.
  I wish that I could be like you,
  And unto Kathy would I screw.
  I wish, I wish to be a guest,
  your Hacienda is the best.
  I so admire your bravery,
  Your bulletproof hat next to thee.
  Danger, danger everywhere
  You slightly stained your underwear
  We still love you anyway
  even though you and Craig are gay
  His cold medina is so funky
  please don't touch the Coop's monkey
  See ya and peace out is what we say
  as your job slowly fades away
  Your teddy bear is safe with us
  your mommy gave it up on the bus
  What is next in your big career
  Movies, T.V., a commercial for beer?
  But never never on channel one
  the Playboy network is more fun
  Oh we miss you lately at our school
  Why don't you ever visit you insensitive fool
  Winnebago is better than any middle school
  so come and join us for some free drool
  Shovel up your little hose
  and bring with you your little hoes
  Hair lips aside you are the best
  Even though your pants you messed
  They shot at you and you just laughed
  Super Coop will cut them in half
  I hate this place and I want you
  for a boyfriend, make it come true
  and if you don't I'll come looking for you
  I know where you live and I stake you out
  Shut up about this you little trout
  If you value your puny life
  Give us Lisa and a knife
  Your think you're better than the rest
  but Mr. Valverde is the best
  Craig says goodbye and then departs
  Ryan has got those letters that blows farts
  Pop quizzes are fun and here's one for you
  I know where your family is but do you?
  Where the Hell is Hicks
  We miss him like we miss some ticks
  Satellite hookups are really cool
  The square on your map means you're no fool
  School number 23 is totally Red
  I've seen you wet yourself in bed
  The sheets are quite wet and sticky too
  I almost stepped in a pile of goo
  You stupid flipping mother of a dork
  I thought you knew you were a pork
  I'll leave you now and say see ya
  Party line's over and I don't have to be ya
  By the way WE LOVE YOUR HAIR WAVE
   -COG
