  [ a cozy den in an expensive isolated home in rural south central Essex.
    MITOCHONDRIA MOE and JULIE THE CHICK are here. ]

  MM:  What in the name of Ribosome Joe is this?
  JTC: It is a birdhouse, stained the color of cherries!
  MM:  A perfect choice in this damp English weather - now if only I can find
       my tape measure, we can copy it!

  [ enter RAOUL. ]

  R:   what is the UP!?
  MM:  Raoul!  Hit me with some paste, brother!

  [ RAOUL unharnesses his glue uzi and blasts MITOCHONDRIA MOE into sticky
    oblivion.  Horses whinny in the night. ]

  R:   Eh JEW-LEE let us shoot the pool!
  JTC: You're so groovy, Raoul!

  [ RAOUL and JULIE THE CHICK go to a local pool hall.  Upon arriving, RAOUL
    discovers that he has an upset stomach.  After 15 minutes of shooting
    pool, RAOUL excuses himself. ]

  R:   This toilet is the low - but this shit is the tops!

  [ RAOUL rejoins JULIE THE CHICK at the pool table.  She is displeased. ]

  JTC: I started a new game.

  [ RAOUL watches her finish.  Then they start another game, but his tummy
    catches up with him. ]

  R:   Excuse the me!

  [ RAOUL returns to the john. ]

  R:   Oh the yeah!

  [ RAOUL slowly walks out.  JULIE THE CHICK is visibly angry.  They play
    one more game and go to leave.  They pay for the hour they played. ]

  JTC: We paid three bucks for you to take a shit.
  R:   I am the sorr!
  JTC: I am so angry.  [ sobbing ]  Need... Chex...
  R:   The wheat or the corn?
  JTC: Up yours, shorty!

  [ JULIE THE CHICK pulls out a bottle of SKI and shoves it up RAOUL's hairy
    ass.  RAOUL squeals in pain.  JULIE THE CHICK laughs mightily at him. ]

  JTC: Now what do you think about that?
  R:   I am the hurt!

  [ RAOUL pulls the bottle out and goes to fling it in the river.  JULIE THE
    CHICK hits his arm irately. ]

  JTC: Do not throw that shit-smeared bottle into the river!  It could ruin
       the ecological balance of the sea!
  R:   You are the right.

  [ RAOUL takes the bottle and shoves it down his own throat.  He dies. ]

  JTC: He was a fat bastard anyway.  I think I'll go shoot smack.

  [ DINKY HOCKER appears, compuncting and flabburbating madly. ]

  DH:  Don't do it!
