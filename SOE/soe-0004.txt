  Der Story o' Das Puzy-Fu

  The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

  Chapter one

        Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, in a faroff kingdom, there
  was a king.  This was far from extraordinary as most kingdoms tend to have a
  king.  Some kingdoms have queens, but these are more properly termed
  "queendoms", and really have nothing at all to do with this story here.
  Now, this kingdom was named Tractoronia, and it was a pretty good kingdom as
  kingdoms go.  The King of Tractoronia was named King Puzz, but everyone who
  liked called him Good King Jimmy.  Those who didn't like him called him
  other things, but we won't go into that.  Now King Puzz was a pretty good
  king as kings go.  Tractoronia, as I have said, was a fine kingdom, but it
  did have its problems.  And so every Thursday, King Puzz sat on his royal
  throne and he had the people bring their problems to him to see if he could
  help them.  Most days he had to mediate disputes over cows or decide what a
  good price was for bricks or other things like that. One day, however, a man
  came into the throne room who did not have a problem involving cows or figs
  or bricks.  He was obviously a poor man and his straw hat had many holes.
  May I help you? asked King Puzz.  Yes, said the man, yes you can.  My name
  is Aifu and my clams have all died.  What? asked the king, your clams have
  all died?  Yes, sire, said Aifu, I am a clam farmer and my clams have all
  died.  Ah, said Puzz, a clam farmer.  That explains the straw hat.  Your
  clams have died, you say?

  more puzzy-fu shortly...
