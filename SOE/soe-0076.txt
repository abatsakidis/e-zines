  Delaware is a superfluous state and in a state of nature utensils are
  superfluous, and Las Vegas is where Chevy Chase made his last National
  Lampoon movie so the solution is the equivalent of Chevy Chase in the state
  of nature, thus

  Delaware provides very little of usefulness, and the very concept of a
  utensil is to be ueful.  Las Vegas provides very little of high morality,

  UART Shell #5 - ISTANBUL : BASTER :: YANGON : ?

  Istanbul is one place where Salman Rushdie would be killed on sight and they
  would probably then use a baster to saturate his body while they roasted it
  in the name of Allah; Yangon is a place where Kenneth Starr would be killed
  on sight and they would pee on him to keep his body moist while it was
  sacrificed to Loth, queen of the giant spiders, so

  ISTANBUL : BASTER :: YANGON : COCK

  Istanbul and Yangon are both places; baster is an obscene name with the
  last last letter dropped and the last vowel changed; so

  ISTANBUL : BASTER :: YANGON : MOTHERFUCKU

  [murmur]  $$$$ $$ $$$ $$$ $$$$ $$ $$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$ $$$ $$$

  Istanbul is an Asian city in Turkey that used to have a different name
  (Constantinople).  Yangon is an Asian city in Myanmar (formerly Burma) that
  used to have a different name (Rangoon).  You use a baster to baste a
  turkey.  You use Chinese soup cannons to baste Myanmar.  Therefore...
