   We at Sloths over Ethiopia are concerned about the rising violence in this
    world, and we feel it is our job to "out" those groups that we feel have
  a good likelihood of engaging in such acts of violence without our expressed
  authorized permission.  On a recent search of the so-called "World Wide Web"
   Sloths over Ethiopia discovered the existence of one such group, a clearly
  rogue outfit that refers to itself as The DETH Guild.  Although we at Sloths
    over Ethiopia do appreciate The DETH Guild for appropriately kickin' out
    that lexicographical shit, we feel that their Mission Statement is ample
   evidence that this group is entirely untrustworthy and must be eradicated.

  $$ $$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$ $$$ $$$$ $$ $$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$ $$$ $$$

                This Is The Mission Statement Of The DETH Guild:
        
    It is the ambition of the DETH guild to become the most powerful faction
  in clan lord. Our ranks will fill to unimaginable heights, as we earn power,
   respect, and infamy. The mention of our name will bring hope to our allies
                             and terror to our foes.

      We refuse to allow such behavior to continue unchecked.  Sloths over
            Ethiopia has therefore developed the following gameplan:
