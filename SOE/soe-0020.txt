      _an excerpt from "see billy trip his face off with real bad acid."_

                                   - by styx

      after eleven years of research, i have discovered the source of the old
  cliche; "a stitch in time saves nine."  i've always wondered what the hell
  it meant.  i found the source in an old, dusty tome in my attic titled _see
  billy trip his face off with real bad acid_.  it is written in play-form.
  the following is an exact transcription:

      shawn - hey billy, i have some acid.  would you like to take some?
      billy - i sure would, shawn!
      shawn - cool!  here is your tab of LSD!
      billy - great!

      [styx's note:  for the next six pages, shawn tells billy what acid is
       like and how much fun he is going to have.  they eventually end up
       in a shack in shawn's backyard.  a little over an hour after billy
       takes the acid, he starts convulsing and vomits all over shawn's
       fluorescent nike airs.  these events lead up to the following.]

      shawn - what's wrong, billy?  you're puking all over me!
      billy - ;a0g49hj09a49ujgairoag;ios5rjhilak!!!!!!
      shawn - yeah man.
      billy - ajdkliarijistchninenen!!!!!!
      shawn - what's that?  i can't understand what you're saying!
      billy - strrryychniiiine!!!
      shawn - what?  did you say "a stitch in time saves nine?"
