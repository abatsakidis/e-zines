  Ingredients:

  3 oz.   Armour Potted Meat Food Product     2 cups  Pink Marshmallows
  1       Large Toenail                       1 liter Water
  4 cups  Chili Powder                        1 liter Hydrogen Peroxide
  5 tsps. Ski                                 1 tsp.  Talcum Powder

  Preheat oven to 525 degrees.  In a large pitcher, mix water and hydrogen
  peroxide so as to dilute the hydrogen peroide.  Add talcum powder and stir
  vigorously.

  In a separate container, add chili powder and marshmallows with Armour
  Potted Meat Food Product.  Mix hoarsely until the pink is very well beaten
  into the Armous Potted Meat Food Product.

  Drain off half of the hydrogen peroxide mix and add Armour Potted Meat
  Food Product mixture.  Add toenail.  Shake and beat vigorously until you
  can shake and beat no more.  Then rest up to repeat.

  Pour solution into a deep fryer and place on floor.  Let sit.  Drink the
  Ski.  Four hours later take solution from floor and offer to dog.  Do not
  threaten the dog, however, he may have scurvy.
