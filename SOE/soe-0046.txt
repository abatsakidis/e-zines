  "happy smiley"
  by phairgirl.

  i am having a very happy smiley day.  i washed the dishes because my mom
  kept yelling at me and that did not make me smile.  i talked on the phone to
  my dad and he was not drunk and slobbering, and he promised to let me play
  with his ancient laptop and make it work.  my mom gave me ice cream because
  i did my chores.  bur i do my chores normally and get no ice cream.  oh
  well, it was just a little bit of ice cream anyway.  but it was enough ice
  cream to make me happy smiley.

  tomorrow might be a happy smiley day.  i have to do more chores but it's ok
  because chores aren't that bad.  i don't have to sew sneakers for tv
  celebrities, so i am smiling.  but my friends keep not calling me, and i am
  not happy.  but my friends do lots of VERY ILLEGAL BAD UNHAPPY UNSMILEY
  HORRIBLE ATROCIOUS GORY BAD KITTEN-EATING THINGS so maybe i am happy after
  all.  who is to say.

  i sure do want a popsicle.
