   Sloths over Ethiopia presents a brand new aster delight!  It's "llllaaaa".

  $$ $$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$ $$$ $$$$ $$ $$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$$ $$ $$$ $$$ $$$

  once apon a time. once apon a time there was a thing. this thing did not
  know what it was. so one day it was walking along the road and ran into a
  whatsit. the whatsit did not know what it was either. so they went to the
  highspeachialmagicalsmartperson of the village. the
  highspeachialmagicalsmartperson said that he did not know what the thing
  was. he did not know what the whatsit was either. so know he is called the
  stupidpersonwithnobrains. but the highspeachialmagicalsmartperson, or, as
  he is now called, the stupidpersonwithnobrains did know. he just told them
  he didn't. he did not lke being called the stupidpersonwithnobrains. so he
  told the thing and the whatsit that they were cows. the cows did not like
  cows. so they killed themselves. now stupidpersonwithnobrains is called the
  personwhodidaverybadthingandkilledtwopeople. after that no one liked the
  personwhodidaverybadthingandkilledtwopeoplehe  he was an outcast. so he
  went away and lived with the stupids. the stupid wern't t smart and he fit
  right in. but he was to stupid. do he moved to the even stupiderclan. but
  they were also too smart. so finallyt he found his match in the
  stupidestofalltimes. he liked it here. he fit in. and he was smart
  compaired to them. again he was the highspeachialmagicalsmartperson. he
  liked this. but then halked to anbpther thing. this time he told the thing
  that he was a hore. hay is for horses. so the horse ate some hay, the horse
  did not like hay because it wasn't really a horse.

  MORAL: don't listen to highspeachialmagicalsmartpersons!!!!!!!!
