Ok well it looks like time for the intro letter from the editor
that is almost obligatory for any little E-Zine like this.  Well
This is issue one and a first for me.  I'm the SysOp of Ahead of
My Time BBS in Paris TN.  The # is 901-642-9290 you should be
able to get all the most recent issues from my board as soon as
they come out.  I hope to be able to get out an issue once a
month but depending on how many contributions I have any given
month I may or may not be able to keep this schedule up.  This
1st issue is mostly my own writings and those of a few friends as
well as "found articles".  I hope everyone enjoys issue one and
if you don't well tough shit.

===============================================================================

Guide lines for contributions to Misfits Inc.:


Well really there are none.  That was easy wasn't it.  But
seriously I plan to print almost anything that comes my way.  Now
how can you get it to me?  Well the best only way is via my BBS,
Ahead of My Time, at 901-642-9290 in either plain ASCII text or
Word Perfect 5.1 of 5.0 format.  If you use WP 6 save it as a 5.1
file because I refuse to change now that I have gotten used to
5.1 and relearn all the commands when I could be doing something
constructive with my time. Thanx for considering MI.  I am also
looking for permanent writers that will supply 1+ articles per
month on a topic of their choice (fiction,life,poetry,whatever). 
Please get in touch w/ me the same way as above.  I'm also
looking for distro sites. In the beginning anyway you will have
to be willing to call in to get your own copies of all new files
once a month. I am looking for couriers as well.  Anyone
interested in moving a few copies around the country for me?
If you are interested in any of the above leave me a message on
AOMT 901.642.9290.

     Leaving
I open the door, blinded by sunlight.
I look around, make sure all is right.
Knowing that Time always, is running out.
I stop, and for a moment think.
There are so many things to worry about.
So many things trying to make me sink.
I worry about life.  I worry about strife.
I worry about morality.  I worry aobut mortality.
I worry about death.  I worry about afterlife.
All this as behind me, the door closes with cold finality.

     The Joker
The fool sits calmly on his rear,
The king screaming and cussing.
The fool mimics with devilish lear.
The court was in quite a feud.
They mumbling and even fussing
Their remarks are somewhat leud.

The jester sits with a smile.
The court and king rant and rave.
The maids are a-blush all the while.
The guards fear to cause a fray.
The knights are out with lives to save
On this dreary November day.

The joker stands and claps.
The king is quite wrathful.
Trying to quiet the bloody chaps.
The king screams Off with their heads.
The guards run forth to kill
The servants await to collect the dead.

The farceur calls for a halt.
The court stops, then laughs.
The guards move on, they see no fault.
The court continues bickering.
A guard draws sword, another readies ax.
The maidens hide their faces, snickering.

The comedian grabs a blade
And slays the ireate king!
A scream from a maid.
The guards all freeze.
The silence echos with a ring
As the king falls with a weeze.

The entertainer gives the blade a fling.
The maidens faint one by one.
The joker says Now I am king.
So they had a king who was a fool
What a jolly bit of fun!
It turned many a head; this rule.

     The Guard
Standing watch over all
Standing stiff, resolute
With his halbred in hand
Never budging not a twitch

Standing proud, standing tall
Listening quietly without rebuke
To the raving of a man
Called a warlock, called a witch

The witch is chained to a wall
His smell made one wish to puke.
 Once mighty, but no longer grand
Caught by a sneaky snitch.

The guard watched it all:
Inquisitor's trial a fluke
Merely wanting his land
They called him a witch

Taken from his herb stall
The land given to the Duke
Into a cell he was crammed
From rich to poor a big switch.

Inquisitor took him off the wall
Never touching him (he wore only soot)
Once cut, his blood flowed like hour glass sand
The man fell, and began to twitch.

The guard stood and watched the fall.
The man from the wall died that day
But the warlock didn't die at all
Swapped minds with a guard and got away.

	     WALKING THROUGH DAYS OF DARKNESS,
	     NOT KNOWING WHO I AM,
	     NOT KNOWING RIGHT FROM WRONG.
	     LIVING EACH DAY IN A STATE OF CONFUSION,
	     LIVING EACH DAY NOT KNOWING WHAT LIES AHEAD,
	     LIVING EACH DAY TRYING TO REMEMBER THE PAST AND NOT THINKING
	     OF THE FUTURE.
	     FEELINGS OF ANGER AND CONFUSION ARE ALWAYS IN MY HEAD,
	     FEELINGS OF PEACE AND SOUNDNESS NEVER COME TO ME.

			"LAST NIGHT"

LAST NIGHT WAS A MAGICAL NIGHT.
LAST NIGHT BROUGHT TEARS TONIGHT.
TONIGHT MADE LAST NIGHT BE THE LAST.
TONIGHT BROUGHT BACK EVERYTHING FROM THE PAST.
THE PAST IS NOW IN THE FUTURE.
THE PAST IS NOW LAST NIGHT.
FUTURE, WHAT FUTURE?
TONIGHT KILLED THE FUTURE.
THINK OF ME AND THINK OF LAST NIGHT.
WANT TO BE WITH ME REMEMBER TONIGHT.
TONIGHT HAS SHRED ME FROM YOUR LIFE.
TOMARROW WILL BE ANOTHER NIGHT AND TONIGHT WILL BE IN THE PAST.

	     Walking through the darkness of life
	     Trying to discover who and what I am
	     Receiving looks of anger, receiving looks of hate
	     Trying to forgive but can't forget

	     -Mondo Boss

==============================================================================
	     
	     My eyes are filled with darkness
	     My heart is filled with hate
	     My soul is filled with blackness
	     I feel nothing but anger and desperation
	     I feel I'm in isolation

	     -Mondo Boss

==============================================================================
	     
	     Trying to love you
	     But you wont let me.
	     I tried to forget about you
	     But I couldn't.
	     Every tear I cry is for you
	     But their in vein.
	     Every dream I dream is about you
	     But it's never the same.
	     I feel I'm lost without you
	     But it would be the same having you.
	     My soul is straying, My heart is dying
	     But it doesn't matter
	     'cause I no longer matter.....

	     DYING IS COMING CLOSER TO REALITY FOR ME
	     MY MEMORIES OF YOU ARE SLOWLY FADING AWAY
	     TO CARE, TO LOVE IS ALL I WANTED TO DO
	     I'D KILL FOR YOU, I'D DIE FOR YOU

	     Mondo Boss

==============================================================================

These tears of blood slowly run down my face
The blackness of your heart is taking over my life
Death is the only isolation that can save me from you
You showed me love then hate. Hate is all I see now
You gave me the kiss of death
Everyone said that your love wasn't true
My heart made me blind, BLind to you
I see know what you are but it doesn't matter
The love we shared the deception in our lives
The decetion that you portrayed as love
Love that was not their
The love you shoed was not true
I'm calling for help
The only help that can save me is the love you can't show
These dreams that keep me from dying are the same that keep me from living
You brought me down you picked me up you lyied
You have the hate that I must posses.

-Mondo Boss

==============================================================================

	     days of darkness
	     nights of light
	     looking for love
	     finding hate
	     leading myself to heart break
	     looking for sanction inside you

	     -Mondo Boss

==============================================================================

	     through the darkest of nights and the blackest of hates
	     my consecrated heart has been shattered
	     my love for you is decaying
	     my dreams of your love is slowly turning into nightmares
	     my thoughts of you are slowly turning into anger
	     i'm starting to detest everything that i once thought you
		  stood for
	     i guess i should go on with what is left of my life
	     i hope and pray that one day you will understand what you
		  meant to me
	     in this world full of hate and isolation our "love" is no
		  more
	     desperation is all i have left in this life
	     set me free so i can go on

==============================================================================

	     Dreaming of fear while I'm lying here.

	     Not knowing what to do,
	     not knowing who to trust,
	     not knowing who to beleive.

	     My mind is cluttered with thoughts of love and hate.
	     Trained to forgive although I shouldn't.

	     Being around you keeps me alive, even though,
	     it breaks my heart and dries my soul.

	     Forever thinking of you,
	     forever in my dreams.
	     A kiss from you would purify my body and make me whole.

	     Lost in your eyes forever, looking for sanction.

	     Forever in love, forever in truth, forever thinking of you.

	     -Mondo Boss

==============================================================================

	     as i sit here thinking of you, i'm doing all i can to keep
	     the tears back i haven't figured out what i'm going to do
	     now that i no longer have you i looked forward each day to
	     hear your voice each time the phone rings i hope and pray
	     that it will be you but it never is each day i go on praying
	     that i will have you i know that it is pretty hopless and
	     that i have lost you forever

	     -Mondo Boss-

==============================================================================

I wanna kill
I wanna maim
Who are you 
Did I do that? 
Is that blood yours?
Who's blood is this on my hands?
I have to know.  
Am I the killer?
I'd never hurt anyone.
Bang You're dead.

---The Anarch---

==============================================================================

If I was dead
& you were alive
would it be all better
Or just different?
Or the same?
Is this the answer?
Or just another question?
To ask myself
In the end there is only self
& not self

---The Anarch

==============================================================================

God you abandon me
You say I have no faith
How can I have faith in you
You have not faith in me
You leave me hanging on
This cross of my construction
I hold my hand out
It is empty
So you look away
You only want the strong
& I am weak
There is no use
I am gone to far

  -The Anarch

==============================================================================

                             violent love
			------------

		   Noses and poses and roses
and other such hubwash
it's all shit in my book
so 
what
do you say
 to 
  that?
Roses are read
If they spell things.
    Violence is blue 
		   and black
against the back of your head.
    Nose rings
sing to me.
Ring around
     the poses
	Pocket full of ashes
This computer smashes me.
