_INTRO_TO_WAR_
	The year is 2005, and we've been pounding the Middle East for 
the past four.  First Afghanistan, then Iraq after the former became 
boring.  Thought it'd be just another reality show to boost ratings over 
the weekend it took to topple the region.  Boy were we wrong.
	The year is 2005, and we are are still in Iraq and Afghanistan.  
Israel is occupying Gaza, but that's no matter, after all, we didn't 
even know that was a country.
	The year is 2005, and the conservative beast whose heart and 
sole is war, is suffering from clogged arteries.  It's weakening.  Our 
troops are wearing thin.  We have over 30 soldiers over the age of 50 in 
Iraq.  We are extending tours of service, and recalling wounded men.
	The year is 2005, and Iran is next on our list.  Right between 
our current host countries, it's the  perfect target, and they look like 
terrorists.  Sure they are Persians, not Arabs, but who has time to 
consider such minutia when it comes to the war on terror? We are going 
to attack if they aren't "forthcoming enough" with information about 
their nuclear weapons - like Iraq.

	Certainly it doesn't take much to realize that a shortage of 
human capital and a frantic beast of a reich looking for a new enemy to 
ensure it's identity, means a draft is unavoidable.  In fact, every 18 
year old male fills out a selective service card "just in case".
	It seems unlikely that the regime can maintain relevance in any 
other way than through its military endeavors, and as such, a draft is 
possible, if not inevitable, in the near future.  This document explores 
a few courses of action we have contemplated for avoiding such an 
unfortunate situation as being drafted for such a pointless waste of 
life.
-_-_-_-_-

_CONSCIENTIOUS_OBJECTION_
	The First suggestion I hear while discussing the issue of a 
possible draft with friends and foe alike is that of conscientious 
objection to military service (or CO). 
	To apply for conscientious objection to military services, you 
are required to appear before a local board and explain yourself.
	There are two types of objection - objection to military combat, 
and objection to any military service.

"Beliefs which qualify a registrant for CO status may be religious in 
nature, but don't have to be. Beliefs may be moral or ethical; however, 
a man's reasons for not wanting to participate in a war must not be 
based on politics, expediency, or self-interest. In general, the man's 
lifestyle prior to making his claim must reflect his current claims." 
-http://www.sss.gov/FSconsobj.htm

	So, in order to successfully conscientiously object to military 
services, you have to give proof that you are living consistently within 
your professed beliefs, might I suggest having a bunch of people who you 
haven't shot at testify that you generally do not participate in war in 
your every day lifestyle...
	This qualification could be a simple matter, after all proving 
your anti-military beliefs shouldn't be too hard, however, it could be 
used as way to obfuscate the process enough to give the board 
overwhelming power to be dicks, and reject you for any of the vague 
reasons that could arise.
	Case and point, if you are not a member of an organized 
religion, but are simply against the idea of war in general, they could 
entrap you in a debate as to wether war is ever necessary, and therefore 
decide that your  objection is "political" - one of the examples of an 
unacceptable basis for CO. 
	If you are successful in proving that you are a pacifist and 
refuse to fight, then you will be placed in a noncombat military 
position.  I venture to say, however, that if you are needed on the 
front lines, there is little legal recourse you have against the 
military should it disrespect your CO status - especially if you are 
dead.
	If you are successful in convincing the board that you are 
opposed to the entity of the military and wish to take no part in it, 
you will be placed in a nonmilitary job that benefits "national health, 
safety, and interest."  Seemingly, it would be harder to take you out of 
this position and place you in combat, but I still would not put it past 
our government.

	The long and short of conscientious objection is that it is most 
likely very reliant upon the fairness of the draft board members.  For 
more information see http://sss.gov.

_PRISON_
"Registration is the law. A man who fails to register may, if prosecuted 
and convicted, face a fine of up to $250,000 and/or a prison term of up 
to five years.

Even if not tried, a man who fails to register with Selective Service 
before turning age 26 may find that some doors are permanently closed." 
-http://www.sss.gov/FSbenefits.htm

	The ominous and ambiguous passage above pertains to registration 
for selective services.  Despite the fact that there is no draft at 
present, registration for selective services is still mandatory.  I have 
been unable to find evidence either way, but I can only assume that 
after serving your term and\or paying your fine, you will still be made 
register (granted you are still under the age of 26), so the act of 
simply ignoring your selective services registration is truly fruitless.
	
	Another way you can end up in prison is by filling out your 
registration and then ignoring you call of duty should a draft arise.  
The consequence for this probably depends on the draft's legislation, 
but there is no doubt the penalty is severe.
-_-_-_-_-

_DODGING_
	The 2001 "Smart Border Declaration" between the U.S. and Canada 
implements a "pre-clearance" program when traveling between the 
countries, which would stop would-be dodgers from looking at our 
neighbor to the north as a way out 
[http://www.projectcensored.org/publications/2005/24.html].  Of course 
you can go to many other countries, although the list may narrow.
	If we remember Vietnam, shortly after the situation ended, an 
amnesty was granted, allowing dodgers to reenter the United States 
freely.  This case might not be the same, especially under the current 
administration.  They don't want the war to end, let alone grant amnesty 
with draft dodgers - after all their "for us or a terrorist" logic makes 
draft dodgers terrorists.
	Because an amnesty is less likely this time around reentering 
the country is extremely risky.  Picture for instance, if you are back 
home visiting your family, you may get pulled over for speeding and give 
your license and registration to a cop, who then looks up your name in a 
database, and a nasty little flag next to your name tells him to arrest 
you for being an evil terror liberal.
-_-_-_-_-

_DEFECTION_
	Defection, or legally becoming a citizen of another country, is 
an intriguing suggestion.

"Noncitizens who are not required to register with Selective Service 
include men who are in the U.S. on student or visitor visas, and men who 
are part of a diplomatic or trade mission and their families. Almost all 
other male noncitizens are required to register, including illegal 
aliens, legal permanent residents, and refugees. The general rule is 
that if a male noncitizen takes up residency in the U.S. before his 26th 
birthday, he must register with Selective Service." 
-http://www.sss.gov/FSwho.htm

	The above means that you cannot defect and then move back into 
the country, going about your daily life unaffected by the draft.  Yes 
non-citizens can be drafted!  Theoretically, you could however move to 
another country and obtain citizenship before being drafted and 
therefore not be a draft dodger, and then move back after the draft 
period has ended.
-_-_-_-_-

_SECOND_AMENDMENT_ 
	The final option this document shall touch upon is pleading the 
second amendment.  That's right shoot em up.  When they knock knock at 
your front door, give those punks a taste of the constitution in the 
form of hot lead.  This is how it should go down:

	"Hello, I'm Private Public from the U.S. military. I've been 
sent to abduct you into our -"
	"Wait.  Are you alive?"
	"..Ye-"
	"OMG!!," calling  to someone in the house "This ones still 
alive! He's playing dead!!"
	BANG! BANG! BANG!
	You then drag the body into your basement hole, and repeat this 
whenever a cop comes to your house following some lead that you are a 
"multiple murderer".
-_-_-_-_-

_FIN_
	I hope this was informative, entertaining, or at least 
impressively long.
