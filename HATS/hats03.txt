INTRO
-----
Dyslexicondominium is another simple but fun word game that got it's name 
from the first round ever played.

PLAYING_THE_GAME
----------------
Dyslexicondominium can be played with as many people as you like.  To 
begin, you simply write a word, called the root word.  From that word, you 
must create a new word that uses at lest two letters from the beginning or 
end of the existing word.  You simply repeat this process until you cannot 
think of a new word to add.

If you are playing with other people, you take turns choosing the root 
word.  The person who is unable to think of a word, thus ending the round, 
is the official loser.  There are, however, no winners, because anyone 
playing the game is a loser.

A_FEW_NOTES
-----------
Please note that no spaces are allowed, so words like "New York" don't 
count.

Proper nouns are STRICTLY forbidden.

Misspellings, if correctly challenged, and checked against a dictionary 
agreed upon by all parties before the start of the game, result in the 
misspeller losing the round and the round ending.

If the opponent does not see where you added a new word, you are obligated 
to point it out to them.

There is to be absolutely no repeating of words!

Pluralizing, or turning a word into an adverb is allowed but frowned upon.

This shouldn't be an issue, but in case there is confusion, acronyms, 
because they are not words, are NOT usable.

THE_BONUS_ROUND
---------------
A bonus round can be played at the end if the game to overturn the result 
of the round.  If a player can pronounce the entire word in one try 
without pausing, with up to one full minute to read the word silently, 
they win the bonus round.  

If the loser of the main round wins the bonus round, they are no longer 
the official loser.  If the winner wins, they are double cool.  If the 
person who wins the bonus round chose the root word, they get the option 
of taking  the other player's turn to choose the root word in the next 
round.

If the bonus round winner does take the losers turn, he still chooses the 
root word in the round after that, and then the turn-taking continues.

ENJOY
-----
Live long and prosper.  Not in a material way, but prosper in a more 
genuine manor.  Find true love, joy in your everyday activities, and all 
your missing socks.
