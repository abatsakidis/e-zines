                         Intelligent Design: The Science of Bullshit
                                         By Emoticon

    The commencement of the 1982-1983 school year marked, for Louisiana, the first     \
year in which so-called "creation-science" would join evolution-science in the public   |
school curriculum, as called for in the Louisiana Creationism Act [6].  Public schools  |
were, by mandate of state statutes, being used to endorse a specific religion, and it   |
wasn't long before this law was ruled unconstitutional.  In 1987 the Creationism Act    |
was found by the Supreme Court, in Alliguard V. Edwards, to be in violation of the      |
First Amendment's Establishment Clause which reads "Congress shall make no law          |
respecting an establishment of religion" [7][8].  While it would seem that this ruling, |
based on the unambiguous wording of our founding fathers, was quite definitive, the     |
debate over creationism in the classroom has anything but subsided, and has in fact     |
taken a new form, 18 years later, and our liberties afforded by the Bill of Rights are  |
once again being threatened.                                                           <
    In the late 1980s, the "intelligent design" movement arose, promoting an            |
allegedly secular origin theory contingent upon the idea that the universe is too       |
complex to have been formed without intelligent planning.  The debatably nonscientific  |
science of intelligent design, outlined in the 1989 text book "Of Pandas and People,"   |
is the study of patterns which substantiate the existence of such a being [5].  Despite |
notable connections to the Christian creationist community (most notably its            | 
endorsement by many outspoken Christians, such as President Bush (who presently has     |
power of appointment to fill two supreme court chairs), and its appearance in the       |
mainstream shortly after the 1987 creationism case), intelligent design makes no direct |
reference to a "god" or the book of Genesis.  Though intelligent design's proponents'   |
claim that their theory is secular, it's introduction into the Dover, Pennsylvania      |
curriculum alongside evolution, in October of 2004, brought a lawsuit filed by outraged |
parents, joined by the American Civil Liberties Union, against the school board [4].    | 
The federal district court trial began this past Monday (September 27, 2005), and       |
whatever the verdict, the case will likely be appealed to the Supreme Court, for a      |
decision as important as Aguillard V. Edwards.                                         <
    Proponents of alternative origin sciences point out that evolution is only one      |
of many theories, which itself has numerous variations.  As such, many argue that       |
students should be exposed to other possibilities.  After all, the scientific community |
has embraced fallacies in the past (such as the notion that the Earth is flat or that   |
the Sun revolves around the Earth), and even the popularly accepted theory of evolution |
has taken many forms since its conception.                                             <
    Secular theories of evolution can be traced back to Greek atomists around 400       |
BC, who first conjectured that all matter was made up of uncreated atoms, the smallest  |
unit of matter, derived from the Greek word atomos which means "that which cannot be    |
subdivided." Between 400 and and 300 BC, however, the criticism from two revered minds, |
Plato and Aristotle, significantly marginalized these ideas [1].  2,200 years later,    |
Darwin's theories of evolution were first being published, and facing overwhelming      |
objection from the scientific community et al.  Today the scientific community largely  |
accepts evolutionary science based on Darwin's work, however not without modification   |
to the 19th century ideas.                                                             <
    Certainly, one thing we can learn from the amorphousness of what we call            |
"conventional knowledge," is that plasticity of the mind is necessary when dealing with |
science, especially at the rate at which new information comes to light in this day and |
age.  On that note, many feel that origin science is incomplete without discussing      | 
alternatives such as intelligent design.  While it is true that any evolutionary        |
biologist should be open to other possibilities, this hardly justifies theological,     |
pseudo scientific practices in public school.                                          <
    Modern scientists follow the scientific method - a process in which one forms       |
and tests a hypothesis to investigate a subject.  Science is not used as a device to    |
prove one's predictions correct.  Intelligent design, however, is the search for        |
patterns which substantiate the central idea that the universe was created by some      |
intelligent being.  With this haphazard form of science, there is no possibility for a  |
confounding variable - one can simply ignore anything that doesn't coincide with their  |
statement.  Quite simply intelligent design is not science by today's acceptable        |
standards.                                                                             <
    Evolution is the cornerstone of understanding modern biological topics from         |
genetics to the proliferation of disease.  Subsequently, evolutionary science is also   |
key in studying applications as developing treatments and cures for genetic disorders   |
and AIDS.  Evolution has been accepted for 100 years among the scientific community,    |
and few question its scientific validity.  While no one can say that the current field  |
of evolutionary science is complete or perfect, it is undeniably worthwhile to be       |
taught.  The same argument cannot be made for intelligent design, which does not        |
further our understanding of the world, but merely aggregates proof that the world is   |
too complex to have "just happened that way" with no scientific benefit in sight.       |
    More important than the scientific value, or lack-thereof, of intelligent          <
design's academic pursuit is its violation of the very first of line of the very first  |
amendment of the Bill of Rights.  Although it is calculably secular in its vocabulary,  |
that is where the separation between Christianity and intelligent design ceases.        |
Prominent proponents of intelligent design are almost all outspoken Christians,         |
including William Dembski who wrote in his book Intelligent Design; the Bridge Between  |
Science and Theology that "Christ is indispensable to any scientific theory, even if    |
its practitioners don't have a clue about him. The pragmatics of a scientific theory    |
can, to be sure, be pursued without recourse to Christ. But the conceptual soundness of | 
the theory can in the end only be located in Christ [9]."  Furthermore, the Seattle,    |
Washington-based Discovery Institute is an organization with a staunch history of       |
backing a conservative Christian agenda also backs intelligent design with their        |
antagonistic and divisive "Teach the Controversy" campaign, which aims to redefine      |
modern science around the theory [2].                                                  <
    Beyond the Christian individuals and organizations who back intelligent design,     |
there is an inherent and undeniable theological quality to intelligent design.  Its     | 
central idea is that the world, the universe, is too complex to have been formed        |
without the aid of some kind of intelligence, and the entire study is devoted to        |
proving that.  Believing that intelligent designer created the universe is itself a     |
leap of faith.  While faith is fine in a religious context, it makes no sense in a      |
scientific one.  Quite simply, if we can accept intelligent design as science, it's an  |
indistinguishably small step to accept Christian creationism as science.  Neither are   |
supported by evidence, but are embraced by the human condition.                        <
    Intelligent design has no place in public schools as long as the Constitution       |
is worth more than the paper it's written on.  The political power of the Christian     |
right is being used to manipulate the United States legal system in an attempt to       |
bypass past Supreme Court legislation, and it's a sad day in America when we roll over  |
and let this kind of disrespect for our freedoms go unchecked - let's hope we can still |
have faith (pun intended) the United States judicial system.                            |
