                     Why Peace Is So Evil and Un-American!
                            By Rusty W. McRightwing

	I was cleaning my hunting rifle and staring blankly at my gun 
cabinet full of now legal fully automatic assault rifles (for when the 
terrorists invade), and thinking about those damn liberals, their 6th 
grade Michael Moore logic, and their anti-american peace symbol, when I 
happened upon a remarkable thought.  The "Peace" symbol is actually an 
evil pagan terror circle! I came upon this whilst imagining which symbol 
would win a fight, the "Peace" symbol or the Cross.  Thinking of the 
shape of the Cross, and the lines within the "Peace" symbol, it dawned 
on me how extremely evil and anti-american the "Peace" symbol is.
	To understand what I am about to awaken you to, you must first 
know a little bit about the symbols involved.  Now, a Cross is a holy 
symbol filled with christ.  Christ is literally squished up inside each 
and every Cross, thus it is so good it will blow your mind how good it 
is.  
	
A Cross:         __
                |  |
                |  |
         _______|  |_______
        |_______    _______|
                |  |
                |  |
                |  |
                |  |
                |  |
                |  |
                |__|					
	
	A circle, on the other hand, is an evil, diabolic, and possibly 
the most ruthless symbol known to man.  It is an evil pagan symbol from 
the middle ages designed for the art of war.  To use it as a weapon, the 
pagans would trick good christians by showing them a picture of a circle 
and saying "find the corner."  Whilst the heroic christian soldier would 
try valiantly to find the corner, he would simply go around and around, 
and whilst in this endless trance, another pagan would sneak up behind 
him (or them) and decapitate them with a video camera like today's more 
brutal islamic pagans in iraq.
	Another way of telling how evil the circle is by comparison to 
the Cross is that the Cross has many corners and straight lines.  The 
circle, in its terrorific form, is almost completely devoid of any 
straight lines or corners.

A Circle:          
		       oOOOOOOOOo 
		    oOOO        OOOo
		   OOOO          OOOO
		  OOOO            OOOO
		  OOOO            OOOO   See?! NO STRAIGHT
		  OOOO            OOOO        (opposite of gay) lines!
		   OOOO          OOOO
		     OOOO      OOOO
		        OOOOOOOO

	So finally, I come to my main point: exactly what makes teh 
"Peace" symbol so fucking evil.  Take a Cross.  Turn it upside down.  
Break the side parts so they are going on a downward 45 degree angle.  
Then put the whole thing inside a circle (evil pagan symbol).  Now you 
have your "Peace" symbol!

How to make an evil "Peace" symbol:

Take a Cross:    __     Turn it Upside Down:     __

                |  |                            |  |

                |  |                            |  |
                |  |                            |  |
                |__|                            |__|
		

	
Break The Arm Pieces:    _          And Put inside a Circle:         
                        | |                       oOOOOOOOOo
                        | |                     OOO   ||   OOO
                        | |                   OOO     ||     OOO
                        | |                  OOO      ||      OOO
                       /   \                 OOO      ||      OOO
                      /     \                OOO     /  \     OOO
                     / /| |\ \                OOO   //||\\   OOO
                    / / | | \ \                OOO // || \\ OOO
                   /_/  |_|  \_\                 OOOooooooOOO
                                                                 

Now You Have your "Peace" Symbol and can see it for what it really is! 
PURE EVIL!

As any good christian would be, you are now in a state of shock asking 
how and why this could be?  Now you know how evil the "Peace" symbol is.  
Seeing, as the peace symbol actually contains an upside down Cross 
inside a circle, the "Peace" symbol is now undeniably the Anti-Christ.  
Thus, the "Peace" symbol and even the very notion of "Peace" goes 
against everything the good lord Jesus taught us.  
	Now all you liberal nonbelievers can see yourselves for what you 
really are! EVIl PAGANS WITH A VESTED INTEREST!!!  I hope I have 
awakened your blind eyes and now you can see why we must stay the course 
in Iraq and if Bush tells us Jesus told him to invade Iran or France, 
then we must also do that.  To keep ourselves and our sons safe.  I, for 
one, plan to do my part, and will support the President with whatever 
decision he makes whether it be nukular or non-nuclear.
	God bless America, and God Bless George Bush, our savior who 
converses with our Lord Jesus, and in conclusion, September the 11th, 
2001 and from my cold dead hands, Mr. Gorbechev.
