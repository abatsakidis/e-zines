The Eidolonica Papers!            

Compiled, Edited and Sometimes Written by Greg Webster - Issue 5 Volume 1

	Ok, as promised, I'm going to jump into this issue with a request
for some feedback from you.  In the past couple months I've been playing
with the title bar (of the word "Eidolonica") and now is your chance to
decide which is the best.

Will it be:

	Ok, folks, the choice is up to you...just reply to this issue with
your choice.  In the event of a tie, I choose, and in the event that no
one chooses, I choose again and curse you all. :)

The Eidolonica Papers homepage is nearly fully operational!

While it looks passably ok, I'm having a couple bug problems.  I can't
seem to get the counter to work properly (though I think I know what the
problem is now), and the forms apparently don't work properly with some
browsers.  The forms DO work with text-only browsers, such as Lynx, but
I've had a report of them being screwed when used via netscape.

If anyone out there has some knowledge in this area, I would appreciate
if they would take a quick look at the homepage and see what the problem
is. This has been my first real attempt at HTML, and I'm still learning.

Many thanks for your help.

	So, again into the quest for a little bit of knowledge about our
strange world...this month (after having a somewhat successful request
for submissions), I'm publishing two articles by our readership before I
delve into my own past and the bit of strangeness I have encountered.

The subject of The Eidolonica Papers this month is:
			
		Mental powers:  telekinesis, pyrokinesis, clairvoyance,
		clairaudience, precognition, and various other ways our
		minds can affect our world.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
This issue dedicated to the souls of Dunblane, the children whose lives
were cut short. May their future journeys be joyous ones.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

			And now to jump right into the issue with
			one of the most prolific of our submissors,
			Mr. Burns. This is an excellent article, not 
			about any specific event in our subject 
			really, but more as an explanation of the
			subject itself. If you've had a problem
			grasping the subject in the past month since
			I delivered it to you, perhaps this will help.


             Every time Greg Webster tells us the theme of the next
        issue of EIDOLONICA PAPERS I think, "Hey, I've been there.  I
        can write that.  No problem."  Then I sit down to write
        (which is no small task for me, I'm still very kinetic, even
        at forty two).  Then it starts, the feeling that I have
        something to say and no clue as to how to start.  I guess its
        the aroma of scientific fact coming from this zine.  I often
        write about most of these subject areas, but in fiction and
        fantasy.  Here, I feel compelled to speak only the truth.
        I've had many experiences in these areas, but they are
        personal and I do not want to force I concepts on others
        because I do to want others to force their concepts on me.
        Take anything I write with a grain of salt and remember, we
        are all at some point on the learning curve.

             My friend drops into a chair and says, "They have found
        that there is nothing psychic to dreaming.  It's just the
        brain stem keeping the brain active while you sleep.  There is
        no purpose to it."

             Scientific research is and must always be the tool of
        the left hemisphere of the brain.  Its great for
        understanding the rules of the Newtonian Universe, in all of
        its deterministic glory.  The scientific method is great for
        figuring out the wave lengths of 'red' and the proper scale
        for measuring absolute zero.  Its unsurpassed at telling you
        how things work.

             The Scientific method fails, however, to define chaotic
        systems and this bothers those folks who are dependent on
        only one type of thinking, those who don't like right
        hemispheric thinking.  Science fails to tell you why the
        color red excites humans.  It can't tell you how cold it
        feels between the stars.  It can not describe the qualitative
        nature of human existence, nor should it.

             Face it, there is no limit to the people who want to
        tell you that science and technology are the only answers to
        all of life's questions.  They are almost as annoying as the
        people who say we have no need for science and such.  Both
        groups should grow up a little.  The highest life is one that
        seeks balance and truth in all things.  Where Reason doesn't
        apply, then we must rely on Rhyme.

             You are the owner of a human mind, and a human fuselage.
        Your mind is a ghost inside a sealed box.  If we open the box
        the ghost is not there.  If we re-seal the box the ghost
        returns.  You want to read something mystical?  Read some of
        the work that's going on in quantum physics.  Modern medicine
        has discovered that humans can not be treated as though they
        are just organic machines.  There is considerable evidence
        that healthy states of mind will manifest in healthy physical
        states.  I am not saying we should throw modern drugs and
        procedures out, returning to the Dark Ages.  I am saying
        apply science to scientific questions and spiritual
        understanding to mental questions.  I do not find the two
        mutually exclusive, the Universe is big enough to contain
        both.  If you require that things be only one way or the
        other, then ask yourself why you wish to impose your
        prejudices upon the Universe, instead of opening yourself to
        a accurate understanding of it.

             Who is the proper judge of the limitations of your mind?
        Perhaps you hold a talent, or aspect, for telekinesis,
        precognition, or any of the others (by the way, don't get too
        hung up in the names, we're trying to name the unnameable).
        To develop your talents, you must first explore your
        potential with and open mind.  Insisting that you have no
        such aspects, will cause them to deteriorate.  Richard Bach
        will be one of the first to tell you that if you argue that
        you have limitations, sure enough, you'll get them.  Approach
        the Universe with an open hand.

             If you happen to discover a talent enshrouded in your
        mind, it will not violate any of the laws of science as we
        KNOW them (I use the word 'know' here advisedly).  If there
        is a contradiction, then perhaps we are not seeing the whole
        picture, as has often been the case in the past.  For
        instance, if something is moved via telekinesis, energy will
        be expended and the total mass will be retained.  This is why
        I think we tend to see more of the information talents, like
        empathy, telepathy and clairaudience.  They would not require
        enormous energy expenditures.  Most likely we will discover
        that many talents involve influencing chaos systems, like the
        turbulence of a candle flame, or the way smoke curls into the
        rafters.

             Developing the potential of your human mind will make
        sense.  Avoid the nonsense mongers and all situations where
        money or personal manipulation/domination games are involved.
        I've seen it destroy promising situations.  Your development
        is very personal and it affects you intimately.  Do not
        endanger your health, either physical or mental.  Do not
        throw your money away on icons and rituals.  This is not the
        path.

             I guess I'm saying, there is a lot of wonder in this
        old Universe, and you are a part of it all.  These are trying
        times.  Do not squander your invaluable existence reaching
        for sickness and fear, when there is so much amazement in
        this ever expanding Universe.  Frank Zappa said "Change is
        not only inevitable, its necessary."  Be an agent of that
        change.  We all chose the kind of hero we want and the hero
        want to be.  Pick well, the future of the entire species
        depends on you and the choices you are making.

             Sorry to evangelize, I just get real excited about this
        kind of thing.

           Pax in centuro vicesimi primi

			I found this next bit extremely enjoyable
			to read. As a child I loved ghost stories,
			even if they did leave me with many sleep-
			less nights and a fear of the dark for a 
			few years in my childhood. This article
			reads a lot like those stories, it has the
			perfect attention-grabbing elements and 
			smooth style of those stories.  But this 
			appears to be a true tale.
				
			There was a second tale included here,
			which I found quite interesting, about
			a man who could forecast the weather
			very accurately. Unfortunately, I try
			very hard to have some names or other
			background to the stories before I pub-
			lish them because of my need for these
			to be seen as real events, and this 
			articles, while believable, did not have
			these elements.
	
From: tdavis@LEIF.UCS.MUN.CA

Credit me as "Adam Bragg, from Newfoundland, Canada", my email address is 
"Tdavis@leif.ucs.mun.ca".  If you require any further info on me or the 
stories, please don't hesitate to ask.
 
When my great-grandfather was alive, there was a man who belonged to the 
local Orange Lodge that my great-grandfather went to who had what can only 
be called a telekinetic ability.

   This man was about ten years older than my great-grandfather, who 
himself died in his nineties in the early 1960's.  He lived all his life in 
an area of South River called Salmon Cove, in Newfoundland, Canada.

   He was capable of moving objects like a spoon or a salt shaker across a 
table.  He would just look at the salt shaker & it would slide along the 
table until it was within his _physical_ reach, at which point he would 
then pick it up & use it.

   The unusual part of this story isn't that he could do such things, there 
are countless stories of this type from around the world.  What makes this 
story different is that it was taken for granted.  To others who knew him, 
it wasn't a supernatural ability, it was just something unique that he 
could do.  No one treated him any differently than if it was no more than 
the ability to juggle or if he were double-jointed.

   When the he was on his deathbed, he called in his nephew (he had no 
children) to "give him the Gift".  When the nephew came out, he was as 
white as a sheet.  People asked him if the Gift had been passed on and his 
reply was that he didn't want any part of it, claiming that it was the 
"Work of the Devil" & that he'd never do it.

   Of course, after that, many people thought that what had really happened 
was that when the old man told him how to do it and the nephew tried to use 
the Gift, nothing happened.  So, he concocted the "Devil's Curse" excuse to 
explain his lack of telekinetic ability.  The nephew didn't ever confirm 
this explanation.
 
                               ---A---

					And now my own offering. 


Telekinesis
=-=-=-=-=-=

I guess these strange sorts of things follow patterns and families.  I
remember all the old movies where the gypsy fortune-teller explained how
she was given the 'gift' from her mother, or grandmother, or a strange
maiden aunt, and maybe my family is a little (very little) like that.

My mother has been into the strangest things since before I was born.
She was a member of a seance group for quite a while before me, and has
at various times done spirit writing (not sure I believe in that), and
exhibited signs of telekinesis.  The telekinesis I have no proof of, and
my memories of childhood may be wrong or fading badly, so I can only
tell of what I remember.

I was about 10 I suppose, when my mother first told me about how bored
she was lying in bed waiting for my father to come home (he was a long
distance trucker at that time, and was away for quite long periods), and
how she spent the time laying there with her bedroom door opened looking
down the hallway and turning the dimmer switch for the hallway light up
and down with her concentration.

Of course, being a young male, I was thinking, "Yeah whatever, Mom.",
but a while later, I was laying in bed thinking and unable to get to
sleep when the light in the hallway started going up and down.  My door
was open, and I could easily see the light shift quite a bit.

Now, I don't know whether I'm somehow having my memories change to fit
the events, but I seem to remember that part clearly at least.

And me
=-=-=-

I suppose I was about 16 when I got ahold of this plastic toy gun and
hung it from my ceiling.  I was in pretty constant emotional turmoil at
that point in my life, my parents had split up a couple years before,
and my mother and my sister and I were living in a house with my
mother's boyfriend Bruce.  I couldn't (and still can't) stand him.  He
is emotional and verbally abusive to the extreme, and many times I had
to protect my sister from his tirades...in the times I was at home, and
not kicked out by him.  Researchers say that emotional intense periods
occasionally bring out episodes of psychic abilities, poltergeist
activity is almost always linked with a child with emotional problems.

Anyway, I had hung this gun from my ceiling above my bed, and since I
was now getting to the point where I was very interested in such things
(and since you are reading this, you know I still am), I decided I would
attempt to control the twisting movements of the toy gun.

I spent probably an hour a day before falling asleep trying to control
it's movements, for about a month.  Then, one day I realized that I was
able to control it's full range of movement, stopping, starting, turning
either way, etc.  It was still very slow moving, but I did seem to have
some control.

I showed my sister this, which of course led her to tell my mother, and
me getting in trouble.  My mother told me not to do it, and not only
that, not to tell or show my sister, because she might have nightmares.
Lovely family I have got.

I kept at it for a bit, but it kind of lost it's charm.  I took down the
gun, and didn't bother with anything else.

Since then, I've very occasionally tried the same thing for short
periods, but I have had no real success.  I don't have the concentration
I had then.

Now, I'm sure I experienced the latter event pretty well exactly as I've
written here, but I can't say the same for the earlier occurrence with my
mother.  In either case, I can't see how it matters much.  Except that
because of those events, I can say I am writing this ezine.  It's a love
of the strange bred into me by genetics, and experience.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Next month's topic:

Religious experiences:  Speaking in tongues, guardian angels, voices
from God (or any other Deity), etc.

Now, I don't have much in the way of experience in this, but I will
provide some research on the topic to fill my place in the issue, plus
perhaps my feelings on faith. 

A reminder, The Eidolonica Papers is made up mostly of your
contributions.  Without writings submitted by our readership, T.E.P.
falls apart, so please...if you have any experiences you would like to
relate, send them in.  I will help, if requested, on format and writing,
to your satisfaction.

Many thanks, see you next month.
