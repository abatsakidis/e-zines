I have seen other areas   with no problem, their scene rocks, not a ton of lamers trying to worm their    may into the scene, and then leech everything their shitty HD can hold.. course,these areas with good scenes, and few lamers, also (concept??) have few, if noneof a certain bbs system.. MAJOR BBS, this system cause the downfall of local    scenes! When a major bbs system pops up, (they try to always have like 1o +     nodes online) they have ads out almost in sky writing, with instructions on     what to do to logon to their board, which in case brings every lamer that can   read and coperhend english out of their shitty life and onto the bbs scene      (not the elite shit, just using non-GUI systems for a change.. examples..       AOL, Prodigy, Compuserve, etc..) then.. at somepoint they will somehow find out about other bbs systems that don't buy classifieds in the local paper.. they    will discover there is more than major bbs, (which 9 out of 1o times will never have a bbs list online) when they get on one of these new bbs's, they will      discover a bbs lister, which they promptly scan, they then discover even more   bbs's, which also have bbs lists online, and sooner or later, (after hours of   bbs lists scaning) they by luck come across a more special bbs, this bbs has a  strange and new log on screen, something called a matrix, which, WOW, has a     cool thing called light bars.. it's really, really bad to the bone!!            And this board uses large amounts of something called, ansi, some are even      over 1 page long.. After a long trial and error, they find out how to use       the light bars, and they then apply as a new user, and like all the other board,they expect free access, by then they see a ansi screen that uses fowl lauage,  and says something like, "Enter the damn NUP now, or get the hell off the       board!!" They think to themselves, "what is a nup?".. So.. after 3 tries of     entering "NEW" or "NEW USER", it drops them.. and they wonder..                 "Why did I lose carrier?" , So they remember the boards name and that strange   word, nup, and log onto one of the local major bbs's (which is so cool, because you can talk to like 2o or so other people at once.. WOW!!), for hours they ask about that board and what the nup is, and perhaps by a rupture in the space,    time contiume, they something to type for the nup (which they also find out     means, NEW USER PASSWORD..) so after hanging up, they call that board back up,  and apply as a new user, when "ENTER THE NUP" Screen appears again, they        ever so carefully, (so they don't mistype it by mistake) type in the new        user password.. bingo.. another ansi picture rolls down the screen, and their   told to enter a handle.. "handle," they say out loud, "whats a handle?" after   2 mins of pondering that, they type in their real name, they fill out more      questions, being very carful not to make any mistakes.. then.. some really      odd questions come up, asking how long they have been on the scene,             (which they have no idea what that means, so they enter there age..)            Another odd question, "do you trade warez?" no idea what warez are, so, they    type no.. now, define PIRATE, define PWA, define LAMER, define, ACiD..          so, they honestly answer each..                                                 PIRATE: Has an eye patch, a peg leg and says, "Yo, Ho,Ho" Alot..                (This lamer has been to disney world one to many times..!)                      PWA: Don't know..                                                               LAMER: One Who is Lame?                                                         ACID: Chemical used to burn things..                                            and so on.. it then says something like, call back in 24 hours to see if your   verified.. it then drops carrier, unknown to them, the sysop of that board      just got his laugh of the day, a good (good as in, in the scene) sysop can      spot a lamer a mile away, just like any pot head can spot fake pot trying       to be sold to them a mile away!! The sysop being a good sysop, just deletes     the account without wasting the other users online to vote no for the lamer,    and the lamer who was so happy about logging onto the board and having the NUP? They stayed up all night thinking about going online first thing when their     parents woke up and they were allowed on the computer..
