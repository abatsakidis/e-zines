Disclaimer -
  Disclaimers suck, because it doesn't matter what I put here, I wont be able to stop someone
who wants to rip off the telco. Iam a phreak and get my kicks out of ripping off the telco; So
I wont say that Iam NOT responsible, but yet if I catch you blaming me for your actions, I will
personally shut down your whole NPA and hand the blame off to YOU, and if you live in the UK;
well, I dont care, BT can't do shit to me, if you live in the UK, hit me up and I'll give you
access to CSS via Featurnet, yes, for free; why? Because Iam that damn good beeey0tch!


Introduction -
  Since I wrote about Boxing off of C5, and C5/R2, I thought that I'd write some files on 
ancient systems that may exist somewhere in the middle of nowhere (where computers aren't 
popular yet). I haven't broke a CCITT4 line (yet), because they're so rare; BUT a friend 
of mine, whom would rather stay anonymous, had alot of fun with C4 lines back in the old 
days. After alot of boring lectures on frequencies, and having to play with really old Amiga 
programs, here I am ready to give infoz out to the public and stuff. 


What is CCITT4?
  CCITT 4 (covered in Recomm. Q.115 - Q.120) is very tone dependant, and a great treat
for any phreaker who has the chance to play with this type of line. I dont know much about
the mechanics of CCITT4 because of the fact that I have ADD and dont listen to much of the
lectures that Iam given (joking). CCITT4 is based on three supervisory tones, 2040hz, 2400hz
and the combination of both 2400hz+2040hz. CCITT 4 is unique in its tones, due to the fact
that it utilizes binary code signals. You'll know what I mean when I get more into the controls
of C4. Another thing about C4 is that its very timing specific; for missing several seconds
in between pulses could mean a totally different number. Oh well, the size of this file right
now disapoints me, but who gives a crap. I'll write a follow-up later on. 


Breaking the line -
  Once the call is connected, you'll then burst 2040hz+2400hz for about 150ms and with a pause
of 50ms , you'll then burst 100ms of a 2040hz tone to let the remote CO to know that the line
is in use and that its ready to start routing a call. The controls are as follows:

          15         0000       2040-2040-2040-2040      End of Pulsing tone (old school ST)      

 Note: KP1 pulses are: 2040hz+2400hz for 150ms then a 2040hz for 100ms
       KP2 pulses are: 2040hz+2400hz for 150ms then a 2400hz for 100ms


  When dialing, you'll need to have at least 40ms between each pulse, and 100ms between each
completed digit (after you dial a digit, wait 100ms before pulsing the next). If you dont know
how to makes calls with a bluebox yet, I advise you to read one of the many files I've written
on the subject because i wont go through it again. Please note that I was told that after you've
sent the EOP pulses, the remote CO will respond with a recognition tone so look out for it.



Conclusion -
  I wish that one day, someone can hook me up with a working c4 line (if they still exist), or
that by some kind of miracle; I run across one through one of my routine scans. Anyways, I hope
that I tought you something new, I WILL NOT be writting files on those really old national type
signalling systems, because IMHO, I think that C4 lines are ALL GONE, AND you'll have no use for
anything earlier (C1/C2/C3). 


Cool facts to know: 
         The C3 break tone is a 2280 HZ for 35ms, and dial using C5 tones 35ms each.

         Amiga users use RoxBox 75% of the time, Chicken Dialer 20% of the time, and use
         DOS emulators to utilize BlueBeep the other 5% of the time according to our survey.
