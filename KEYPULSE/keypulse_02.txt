The Lamers Guide To Hacking Your Library's Dynix System
File By:Cuebiz Trinity Three
Okay, This is *not* like some super 'leet hack or something like that.  Its
just something I found works on all the Dynix systems that I've tried it on.
Okay, First off you have to know what you are dealing with. Most public lib-
raries will have even less secuirity then your local community college. Their
lack of secuirity is because the public library system is lacking the funds
that they need to secure their networks as well as they should be. So I
recommend that you first go to your local library and check it out. Look for
clues that are behind the desk. Example:library cards taped to the desk,
numbers written down on notepads that seem interesting, names of their dumb
terminals (The ones to search for books), and lastly look at their books.
Look for a pattern in the numbers. All this information will come in handy
when exploring this system once inside. Okay, Now i assume you either 1.have
a dialup number to access the Dynix system or 2.got a telnet node that gets
you to your libraries Dynix system, If you have none of them. Then go look
in your local computer newspaper at Borders Book Stores or do a search for it.
So far, All libraries that I've tried have either been published or i found
online. I now assume you definately have a number or node to get access. The
first time I connected to one of these I got the same generic looking screen
that I've seen earlier that day when I went to the library. In others they
have a different screen but you can use the "SO" command to get to the main
screen. I advise you to learn the commands by just using their system first.
Nothings more embarrassing then getting access and not knowing how to do a
single thing on it. Now, You probably got the hang of how to use it (easy,
huh?).  To start hacking this you will have to find their default accounts.
Most Dynix systems will give you a screen telling you the default login for
getting access to their library browsing sections. You dont want to go see
that again, dont you?  Well, Try using Dynix's library defaults, They go as
follows: books, search, and library. Okay, if those didn't work then they
must be a little more secure than i anticipated. No sweat though. You still
can use their system for something (later to be discussed in this article).
Okay, Iam guessing that you got in and they are asking you for either a sys.
id or a station number. If they are asking for a sys. id then you are using
a default account and you can just press enter and proceed to the station
number prompt. You are now at the station number prompt. These numbers always
start with 9 (Well,from my experiences). Try starting with my most common the
results are as follows: 911, 908, 916, and 903.  If they did not work try any
other three digit combination starting with 9. Okay, You should have gotten
a prompt that looks something similar to this:

                  Password: __________________

So, What do you do here?  Try using defaults and hope that you get in. They
are as follows: login:library password:library, login:setup password:setup,
login:library password:<none>, login:books password:books, and login:library
password: <the station number you used to get here>.  Those I found to work
like a charm. Okay, You are in the system. What to do? Well you can change
their boring ol' library screen by choosing one of the many accounts and just
hitting the "e" or "r" key. "q" is to quit and "off" is to logoff the system.

NO access to the RLogins:
How to play with the system if you dont have access to the rlogins but,you
have access to their lynx internet. Okay,just go to a webpage that gives you
telnet access.Just like,cyber mud's login (do a search for it from altavista).
The HTML of the page's link should sorta look like this:

telnet:[the telnet area]:[port]

(you can find pages like this by looking at the HTML and looking for the code)
and when you click the link you will be dropped to telnet.  Why? Well, The
libraries Dynix system has rules not to drop people to any other port but,the
telnet port,I really dont know why,but it just is. The Tech support at Provo,
Utah made some sort of "word of mouth" rule not to let users telnet to any
other ports if its stated in a link.But,you may state other ports once dropped
to the telnet prompt.Huh? You can't see what you're typing?  Well, Dont worry
about that.Its sort of another secuirity feature. Say that there was another
person who had no clue what he just did and accidentally got dropped to the
telnet prompt. Well,if he tried to type in something then he would get really
confused and tell the librarian and they would press control c to get outta
there and save the poor "patrons" (like those librarians like to call us) life
hehehe,okay,now you know what to do from there right? well,if you dont know
then here's a hint,Those library computers have no time limit, no sign-in's
to get access, noone know's your name. Here's a list that i found to be fun to
to with that telnet prompt:Telnet to a telnet irc client,participate in mud's
post to newsgroups by connecting to someones port 119,send mail from someones
sendmail port, actually login to that server that you were too scared to go
to from your house or any of YOUR accounts for that matter.Well, Thats it
for this Lamers Guide. See you later in the next Lamers Guide or KP zine.
