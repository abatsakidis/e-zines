The secret payphone

#% The first night. #%
#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%

Its a friday night at about 8:00pm and Iam just home from school. I got 
like $0.50 in my pocket and NO ciggerettes. Subex drops me a call stating
that he's got ciggerettes. 

"CIGGERETTES!"

 My eyes lit up with joy as I thought of that nice smell of a cancer stick. 
We met at our ussual secret spot and jumped a wall to get to the bus stop 
which seemed to get a little more further away every time I took a step. We
finally reached the bus stop and jumped on the first bus that was leaving 
my fux0r'd up city. We were planning on going someplace (I wont say where)
but the bus that we were supposed to catch didn't stop for us. After about
half an hour of venting our anger at that totally ignorant bus-driver, We
decided to go looking around to see if we could find a secluded payphone
somewhere. 

"How about there?", Subex said pointing at a building that had a sort of
business-look to it. "There must be some phones there".

So, We were off. We walked again for another ten minutes and reached the 
building. It was totally dark except for about two windows at the top floor
which was obviously being lit by computer screens. 

"Okay, Lets look for a phone", I said.

We walked between two buildings and found a phone just sitting there minding
its own business. 

"Only one phone?", I said feeling somewhat confused.

"I've been here before and remember there being MORE than one phone".

"Yeah, It must be somewhere around on the other side", Subex added.

So, We walked once again to the other side of the building and searched and
searched, And searched. NOTHING. We found nothing but some nice looking
pools that would make a good place for frogs to play. We smoked ciggerette
after ciggerette while looking for a nice payphone to make some calls with.

We settled with the one payphone. And started off with a call to our old 
friend (I mean literally, OLD!) who gives us directions. He noticed my voice
and hung me up before we could tease him. We made alot more calls one which
included brute-forcing a conference that we never got access to, And Subex
made it known that he was hungry. He handed me some money to buy us some 
food and I ran across the street to the 7-11 and bought 2 bottles of Pepsi,
One Musubi (Its rice and seaweed wrap bunched up, Originating from Japan) 
for me, And a Bacon Cheeseburger for Subex. This phone was cool. We had 
complete privacy and anonymity. Time zoomed by and before we knew it it was
12:45am. We then went to the bus stop to catch the bus home. We waited and
waited until two chics came and sat right next to us. Subex took one glance
and realized that one of them was a girl he'd been admiring for a while now.

"RRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRR!" - A Fire-truck goes.

 "WATCH OUT FOR THE ABULANCE!!!!", A lady in a car yells at someone.

"HONK HONK- RRREEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRR!", The Fire-Truck goes speeding by.
 
 "That sure looks like a fire truck to me", I say. Trying to lighten the
awkward feeling at the moment.

"Dillusional. Thats what I call dillusional", Says one of the girls next to 
 us, Laughing.

 "What bus are you waiting for?", Said a bus driver.

I hadn't even noticed her standing there because of the Fire-Truck and the
confused woman being so sudden. 

"Umm we're waiting for **** (I wont say what bus we were waiting for)",
 Subex said, Sounding a bit tired.

 "Oh, The last bus came already", The bus driver says trying to be helpful.

"What time did it come?", Asked Subex.

 "Oh, Like, at 8:30. 8:30 is the last bus that goes there", Says the bus
driver as she tightens her gloves (They look like arm-wrestler gloves).

We decide there is no other way but to walk it the whole way back home. It
was good excercise anyways, And I got the chance to see old tags that I've
made around the neighborhood like, Years ago. We walked and smoked, Walked,
And smoked a little more. We went to our secret place where we always meet
and smoked a little more and talked hacking for about an hour and a half.
We both then just went home. I went on IRC and had a nice convo. with a fed.


#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#
#%  Night two.   #%
#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#

Night two we wanted to go at about the same time. I was stuck at a family
members house to meet people (I dont know how I ended up there). Subex kept
paging over and over again asking for ciggerettes.... 911911911911911911911
911911911911911911911911911911911911911, Over and over again. It was like I
was getting farking pager bombed. I finally arrived home at about 8:45pm and
we went to go and catch the bus. We waited, And waited and waited. We had
NO ciggerettes so time seemed to run by slower than usual. 

 A van seems to be driving slow near us and Iam thinking that a drive-by's
about to take place. An old lady pops her head out of the window and asks
or directions.  Subex gives her some directions and then we continue to wait
for the bus that seems to be taking forever to arrive.

A car then does an outragous U-turn and stops at the curb.

 "Excuse me brah, You know where someone can get party, and la-dat?", A
man says looking out of his car window at us.

 "What?", Subex replies and we both walk over to his car (Just in case).

Subex gives him some advise on places where a party can be held and I had a
sudden urge to ask him for a ciggerette.

 "Dude, Dude, Dude, Can, Can I get a ciggerette?", I stutter.

"Nah, Sorry brah, If I had, I would give you, But I dont", He says.

 "Okay.", I say feeling somewhat bummed.


And we continue to wait for the bus. Up ahead, A bright light comes speeding
down toward us. It was the bus. We run to the bus stop and make it just in
time. This time, I have $3.00 and we make a quick stop at the 7-11. We buy
some ciggerettes and we meet a guy talking at the 7-11 payphone. We start a
convo. with him and he seems cool. I give him a little lesson on ANI and how
to get a free phonecall through payphones that allow incoming calls. His
eyes open really wide and he trips out on how ANI works. He tries an ANAC
that I give him and reads out the payphones number in amazment. We shake 
hands and leave him to play with his new found toy. We then are off to go to
our secret secluded payphone. We make alot of calls until its about 1:00am.
I manage to crack a Easy Reach 800 number that reaches a family in New -
Hampshire (Subex gave me the number). After that, We smoke, And smoke and 
Smoke somemore. At 1:20 AM, We leave and walk home once again. As usual, We 
go to our secret spot and smoke a little more and talk hack/phreak for about
an hour. I then go home and go straight to sleep.
