The Secluded Pay Phone Adventures - Night Five
Written by: Subex - sub3x@yahoo.com

    Well, now it's fuckin week 5 of our night out phreakin phones
to death, but did this week go great? Well lets cut tha bullshit,
and get down to story telling time.  Ok, it was around...uuhhhh,
8:45pm when I met Cuebiz at his house hoping he could score some
smokes from his old man, cuz I was fuckin shaken as hell,especially
when I haven't even smelt tobacco all week. So he got 2 ciggarettes
from his pops, headed out tha door with our phone book and boxes,
and start heading towards tha bus stop. This night, we were
gonna check tha answering machine's and voice mail's we owned the week
earlier, called up couple conferences, do some scannings and I was
planning on practicing my social engineering skills. So I was
like,"Fuck Yeah, this night is gonna be great cuz we got shit to do."

	So, it was around 9:05pm, and we were chillin at tha bus
stop as usaul. Smokin tha nerves down, and double checkin our boxes
and phone book, making sure we got it was workin right and got all
tha numbers organize in our book.  What we didn't know was that tha
bus was gonna come like an hour. SHIT! which was still cool cuz tha
night was still young, and we got shit to do. It was now around
10:20pm when we headed towards our secret phone booth. First thing
I did was pick it up and dial one random 1-800 number,and heard a
answering machine,Cool! entered random digits, and heard a machine
said, " You have three messages." FUCKIN-A! we now owned a answering
machine belonging to some photographer company.  Whats more exciting
was when I dial random numbers for tha second time and heard a
machine said, "Enter your 4 digit code follow by tha pound key."
Then I entered random numbers then heard,"Thank you." and heard
ringing. w0w! then I heard a pickup-15-seconds-of-breath-then-hangup.
Called again, then a lady picked up and said,"hello." that sounded
like she thought I was a stalker that was gonna kill her, so I just
hung up on that bitch, and asked Cuebiz for a smoke, but he was out,
cuz we smoked tha last 2 at tha bus stop.(See what happen when you're
bored) So we thought,"Fuck it let go chasen,tha night is still young."

	It was only 10:35pm, we headed to tha mini-mart across tha
street and started asking people to buy for us, with no luck,but fuck,
I wasn't gonna social engineer without me calming tha fuck down, I
mean I was thinking,"0h sweet tobacco..WHERE THA FUCK ARE YOU WHEN I
NEED YOU!." But luckily,tha mini-mart has payphones, we could phreak,so
we had to deal with those till we got our smokes. Phreaking wasn't so
bad I was crackin Easy-reach 1-800 and pranking who ever picked up,
scanning, found some weird ass rings,and tried to crack codes from
calling cards, but didn't bother to write down wat I have found cuz
I was so nervious.  But chasen was fuckin really BAD! fuck man, we
run into some folk that were lost and askin for directions,helped them
but wouldn't help us,Hell-man! we even run into a fat,fucked up,drunk
looking man but didn't realise he was a cop. FUCK! people around us
were so fuckin weird,it was pretty scary too. DAMN! it wasn't till
12:35am when we finally got our smokes.(subex note:tha guy that bought
us tha smokes was a fagget-ass-bitch DAMN! fuckin skinny ass punk kept
my change.) Shit! it was pretty late and Cuebiz kept getting pages from
his parents and shit, so we headed home. What even pissed us even more
was it wasn't till we were half way home that we realize that most of
tha shit we found that night was pretty interesting but didn't write it
down. We didn't even get tha chance to check out tha conference line,
FUCK! I didn't even get a chance to practice social engineering.
MAN!!...Wat a night...can it get any worse? :(
