============================

The winds of guilt pick up like leaves during a hurricane of grey, 
blowing words of deciet beneath my sandstorm of loneliness.
The sting of love nails into my skin by the thousands.

Damn the tiny grains!

Frustration pours down like a pouting rain.
Passion follows with a ray of light, providing hope.
But like all things conjured by man, 
it is swallowed by the tide of uncertainty and swept into the sea of doubt. 

Damn the swimming!
