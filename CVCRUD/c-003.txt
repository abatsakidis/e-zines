	cv.crud is a zine and a writer too.  The personal writings 
of CV are often dark and disturbing, stepping over boundaries in 
most issues.  While this can be unpleasant at times, it is often 
fascinating.  While the zine has gone on hiatus a few times, when 
it is active it is a staple of the zine scene.  CV got a bunch of 
zines from me one time and then never paid me for them.

	"WATCH OUT MAN!" The Italian sausage knocked over the 
pepperoni with a brutal force, "Your a pepperoni, get your ass 
back over to your pizza; THIS is a SUPREME, not some half assed 
2 topping. And you know the rumors about how Cv.Crud hates 
pepperoni on his supreme. Last delivery man to deliver a messed 
up supreme to cv.crud had his tip thrown at him in pennies. And 
it is our JOB, that requires our FULL devotion, to take care of 
the pizza delivery man. So make your way back over to that thin 
crust that you call your pizza, and stay."

	"Dude, that was harsh." the bell pepper whispered to the 
canadian bacon. The Canadian Bacon sat back for a minute, looked 
at the bell pepper, and could only mutter a simple "Eh.". The 
mushrooms, the wisest of the bunch, took notice of what was going 
on. The king mushroom stood and with a dominating voice yelled,
"SO IT MAY BE!" 

	Cv.Crud heard the doorbell ring. He jumped from his computer, 
which was running jack the ripper on the /etc/passwd file he had 
downloaded from a mail server on the Texas Tech network. The pizza
man stood far back, remembering what happened the last time the crazy 
son of a bitch came roaring out the door with a hand full of pennies.  
Cv.Crud opened the door, and gestured for the pizza man to hand him the 
pizza. Moments were tense as he inspected the supreme nutritional unit. 
Cv.Crud handed the pizza man a solid 3 George Washington's. The pizza 
man took his tip with caution, got in his car and drove off. 

	Things were euphoric again in the Chicago dish pizza.

Å-+-+-=+---+-=-Myth Treason: Everlasting Acid Trip+---+-=-+-=-+Å

	Everyone knows someone who tripped acid and never came back.
Whether they are an orange that is scared of getting peeled, or a 
glass of water that is deathly afraid of being tipped over, everyone
knows someone... or so they say. If your one of those people, and 
happen to be reading this right now: Quit lying to yourself and 
others flamer.

	The truth is, you dont know ANYONE in that state of mind,
and you never will; on the count it was LSD's fault. The Everlasting
Acid Trip story has been circulating over the past 30 years, yet
the story itself has basically remained the same over the years; A 
friend took LSD thought he transformed into something and is afraid
of the repricusions that go along with whatever object he/she has
become. 

	Im not debating wether or not they beleive they are whatever
object. Actually, I have thought I was in some strange land, or 
I saw something on several occasions. However, I am argueing the 
timeline. NOBODY has ever been recorded to have permanently thought
they are an object because of LSD. The story infact comes from having
a bad acid trip. 

	Back in the day LSD was 20-40 times stronger than todays
LSD. It was much easier to lose sight of reality, and panic. When you
begin to have a bad LSD trip, time slows down to almost nothing. Your
mind is moving so fast that 5 minutes seems like 2 hours. Thus time
seems to carry on 'forever'.

	You see, I believed I was inside an eletcric glowing man who 
kept bleeding into himself (if that makes sense). For what seemed like 
48 hours I sat chewing on the inside of my cheek, not knowing when or 
if it was going to stop (it was really only 4 hours). To this day, I 
still credit my anxiety to that one bad trip.

	So you see, the myth is infact half myth/half truth; He was
an orange forever, he just came back.
