01. Introduction to Issue #2

Note from Sir Knight (sknight@liquid98.com):

Welcome to Chaos-IL, Issue #2.  First of all, I would like to greet all the
people who fanned our first issue, and gave us some motivation to go on.
As you all probably noticed, this issue is much larger then issue #1, and
so, the size talks by it self;  This issue coveres all questions, requests,
notices and announcements that were acceppted by users at our Information
System, and at e-mail notes about the many articles.  We've recieved alot
of requests for adding more Hacking material, and so we did in this issue.
We've also recieved alot of problem notes regarding to the articles, and
we did our best to truely help them all, I hope we did.  However, two new
editors has joined us during the time; Terminal Man and The Trick.  Please
note, that if someone writes an article for this current issue or another,
it does not mean he is an Chaos-IL member, we are freely acceppting original
articles, and adding any that are found quality and good anough.  Any of
you that tried to reach us over the net, has probably noticed that our domain
was down during the last week, and so, e-mails to @chaos-il.com were unvalid.
our new website and central mail address are done as the follow:

   Web:      http://www.liquid98.com/chaos-il
   Email:    sirknght@liquid98.com



Although, you may e-mail your feedbacks to the specific member address that
is written in each article buttom, or at our Information system.
We are satisfied of the result after the first issue release, which made the
tiny Israeli scene, to have more interest in h/p.  I figured it out by 
the huge amount of comments we've recieved, filled with questions of any kind
regarding to h/p, and the articles included in issue #1.  Keep it that way!


                 Sir Knight.  Editor-in-Chief

ISP IA's can be obtained very simply, by carding them.  Just like AT&T, most
of the Israeli ISPs are supporting the Previous Accounting policy, which
availables the service of Previous-Paied Authorization.  PPA is used to serve
a temporary global Internet provide, that can be signed for anytime and from
anywhere.  Ofcourse, in a higher cost then a normal accounting service.
most of the ISPs are serving PPA since it's an alltime profitable service,
and does not cousing a shortage to the company in case it was chancled (unlike
normal accounting service).  Using the validation of the PPA in the current
ISP, you can phreak your own PPA accounts using a Full-detailed Credit Card
information and a sorted house address & telephone info that can be used.

Carding a PPA can be done through Voice support, E-Mail support, and sometimes
in the ISP's website/Homepage.  Carding your PPA through Voice support is
recommanded only if you are fully convinced that local support calls are not
being logged to the current ISP you are calling to.  Some ISPs are tracing and
logging all of thier local support calls that are made, for further use in
case that damage has been done.  In some of the ISPs, carding a PPA through
an E-Mail or through the ISP's Homepage can be rejected, since registrations
through the Internet are not being improved in some of the ISPs, and specially
a registration for an PPA service that is temporary, and freely given.


                     -*- Voice Carding method -*-

Call your selected local ISP, produce your self as like in the middle of some
kind of a buisnesslike travel or anything that is truely describes your image
as of an important buisness man.  Most companies wont give away PPA accounts
to the big public even if needed, since PPA accounts are connected through a
private self-user network which disables any network ports load.
Ask for opening a personal PPA account, couse of buisnesslike purposes.
In special cases they might ask what kind of purposes exactly, then, simply
say that you can not detail your purpose couse of private reasons.  Also say
that you reached them for thier PPA service only, and you dont have any other
intents, but you do can move up to ask for another company's service.  That
should be the maximum anough conversation, if the support man demand for more
exact details about you and your service purpose, dont flow and call another
ISP support using the same methods.  If done ok, you will be asked for your
personal credit card information, and about the type of service you wish.
Give them the credit card information at first, include everything.  When the
support man asks you to hold since he's verifying your card details, dont hold
for over then 1-2 minutes.  If the card have found un-valid, he might try to
trace your call location and announce the police right away, therefor he'll
need some time.  Since you sorted an empty house address for the bills to be
sent, in the card verification, the support man might notice that your details
do not match (generaly almost never happens).  In that case, say it's your
old home address which is still empty since you moved, and you would like the
account bill to be sent there.  After that you shouldn't get any technical
problems of any kind.  He'll tell you to hold a few, and you will recieve your
full detailed account information by FAX/Voice.  Please note, that the support
men in some of the companies, are using the voice number that is within the
credit card, for verifying your agreement by voice.  In that case, when you
tell the support man your credit card full information, instead of the giving
the original voice phone number, give him a Bezeq Revoked number.
Bezeq revoked number, is a number which used by a company for services, and
after the company has closed the service, they didn't had any need of it.
If the company is using an outdial network (*9, etc.) Bezeq cannot disable the
number from their lines, so they revoke it.  Those numbers are alltime busy,
and will keep being revoked until the company who owned it will die.

You can use one of the following numbers:

03-6750043
03-6750011
03-6750076    /*  Note:  Most of the plain revoked numbers
03-6750066        can be found on area codes 03, 04 and 08.  */
03-6750023
03-6750054
03-6750068
03-6750066
03-6750060
03-6750098
03-6750091
03-6750044

Other 675-00-XX digits are used for BezeqNET's ISDN services and for LBO,
(Local Buisness Office). After you reiceved your PPA account information, go
ahead and use it.  The main idea of PPA accounts is temporary, the ISP will
send an account bill with time used, and service payment to the house address
you sorted within the credit card information.  You have to make sure the
house is totaly empty, and will be for a few months, otherwise, right when the
house owners will get the account bill and they will see thier name signed on
it, they will announce the ISP, and you'll get traced in a few days.
When the ISP company will notice that your PPA account is not being paied
after they sent you the account bill, they will send another few with a warn.
Its recommanded to use the PPA account for no longer then three months, after
that period, stop connecting with it!  At first, the ISP company will close
the account, and will keep sending warns to the sorted house address, they'll
try contacting the account owner through the revoked number which is actually
busy all the time.  From this point, they are totaly postrates. Have phun!



                     -*- Internet Carding method -*-

Well, I have'nt been to check this actually, but it seems that more then 80%
of the ISP companies are serving an account registeration through the Internet,
by E-Mailing, or through thier official homepage.  It have'nt been checked if
the Internet registeration methods, supports all types of registerations.
You should access your desired ISP's homepage, and check if PPA account is
valid for Internet registeration.  If valid, you simply add-in the card details
in the same process described in the Voice Carding method.  If not valid, use
the E-Mail method, and E-Mail a request for opening a PPA account including
nice flatters in your request :) . It's either 100% that your request will be
acceppted, and you'll be able to feedback your credit card information.
Also try to disable the request, and send the card details plus request for
opening an account on the same E-Mail, at the first place.


                          -*- Final Note -*-

What's so good and profitable on going through all this process, is that normal
accounts that are originaly owned by someone else, or any of those kinds, are
usually being replaced, or password changed if you use them too much.  And
it's either 99% of them are non-supporting over 1 simulataneous connected.
Although, PPA accounts has no simulataneous limit, and you can use them like
how much you want, Ofcourse, until the warns are starting to be mailed.
It's like 3-4 months after the ISP is starting to send the warns, but for
making sure, try to find an empty house that is near you or something, so you
can check the new mail once a month.


Glossary:
=========

PPA == Pevious Paied Authorization
ISP == Internet Server Provider
IA  == Internet Account



Have phun :) please, if it's your first time carding, don't try this.

                          (c) Chaos-IL Magazine!


Here's how to construct a null modem cable, used to connect 2 PC's by their
serial ports.  This allows you to transfer files from one PC to another at up
to 115,200 baud, providing a fast and easy way to transfer files which are
too large to fit on diskettes, or solving the problem of transfers when 2
PC's have incompatible disk drives.  A suitable cable can be purchased
already made, or you can make one yourself.  In addition, you will need some
type of software to manage the job.  There are two commercial packages that
are known to exist:

 * LapLink
 * FastLynx

You can find these and more packages in any commercial software source in the
Internet, such as WWW.SOFTWARE.COM  &  WWW.IDTSOFT.COM.

It's probably about the same price, and less fuss to buy the proper cable
from a computer shop.  But, when making your own cable, the afterwards
results talk by themselves :)

All the necessary parts are available at any known electric store around. I
paid only 30 NIS. for all the necessary parts, in an electric store near to
Dizengoff Center, in Tel-aviv.

These are the stuff you will need:

   o Electrical or similar tape. Helps.
   o Small blade or phillips screwdriver (for the connector you buy)
   o Tweezers or forceps
   o Sharp knife or wire stripper
   o Soldering iron & solder (if using the solder type)
   o Connector Crimping Tool (for AMP brand connectors)
   o Wire cutters

Eight or nine conductor cable works well, and allows for addition of
connections if they should be needed in the future. To use the crimp type
connections, you need the tool to crimp the pins onto the wires.  If you plan
on making several cable in your lifetime, then the tool is well worth it.
Otherwise, you're probably better off paying someone else to make it.

If the computers you are connecting have 9 pin serial connectors, you need
the female (with holes) connectors on both ends of your cable. (IBM's and
compatibles have male connectors for their 9 pin serial ports). If yours are
female, make sure the connector is not a video connector instead of a serial
port connector.  25 pin COM ports on IBM's and clones are typically male,
also.  Whether you make a cable with 9 pin or 25 pin connectors (or one at
each end), pre-made adapters can be purchased to convert from 9 pin to 25
pin, and vice versa.  I made all mine with 9 pin ends, and use 9 pin to 25
pin adapters with good results.


TIP: Buy enough cable! As long as you're making it, make a length of about 8
or 10 feet. I've made cables, when using shield, about 35' in length
with no problems. Better a little too long than too short.

TIP: If you done, it's hardly recommanded to wrap electrical tape around the
cable at each end to fit underneath the connector.  The connectors and cable
at Radio Shack don't fit real snug together, allowing the cable to slip out
and put stress on the electrical connections.  You'll see what I mean when
you are closing the connector together.

program User's Manual.  For further information, get FastLynx of your own.

                           Cable Specifications
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Following is a description of the pin connections for a FastLynx 7-wire
serial cable.  The cable is a 4-headed cable with a 9-pin and 25-pin female
connector on both ends.  The cable is wired as follows:

    9 pin   25 pin          25 pin  9 pin
    -----   ------          ------  -----
    pin 5   pin 7   <---->  pin 7   pin 5   (Ground - Ground)

    pin 3   pin 2   <---->  pin 3   pin 2   (Transmit - Receive)
    pin 7   pin 4   <---->  pin 5   pin 8   (RTS - CTS)
    pin 6   pin 6   <---->  pin 20  pin 4   (DSR - DTR)

    pin 2   pin 3   <---->  pin 2   pin 3   (Receive - Transmit)
    pin 8   pin 5   <---->  pin 4   pin 7   (CTS - RTS)
    pin 4   pin 20  <---->  pin 6   pin 6   (DTR - DSR)

The ground wire is connected to the same pin on both ends.  The last three
wires are a reverse of the prior three.

Following is a description of the pin connections for a FastLynx parallel
cable.  The cable has a male DB25 connector at both ends.

            25 pin          25 pin
            ------          ------
            pin 2   <---->  pin 15
            pin 3   <---->  pin 13
            pin 4   <---->  pin 12
            pin 5   <---->  pin 10
            pin 6   <---->  pin 11

            pin 15  <---->  pin 2
            pin 13  <---->  pin 3
            pin 12  <---->  pin 4
            pin 10  <---->  pin 5
            pin 11  <---->  pin 6

            pin 25  <---->  pin 25

The second set of 5 wires is the reverse of the first set.


     The following cable will allow transfers using LapLink 3. However, it
doesn't support the feature of installing the software from the remote.  The
FastLynx cable above does work with all the features of FastLynx.  The
following cable merely transmits and receives data.  It cheats by jumping
connections at each end to trick the computer into thinking it's connected to
another computer.  The FastLynx cable above allows the 2 PC's to actually
communicate.  However, I haven't gotten LapLink III to install software from
remote with FastLynx's cable, either.  FastLynx does it just fine when using
a FastLynx type cable.  Here's a diagram to make a true Laplink 3 cable.
The instructions are identical to the FastLynx cable also.

Explanation:
------------

*Connect pin #2 of one connector to pin #3 at the other end. This is known as
a "pin 2 to 3 crossover". That way one computer receives what the other is
transmitting.

At each end, connect pins #4, #5, & #8 together.

Also at each end, connect pins #6 & #20.
** If you are using a nine pin connector, this connection is not needed as
there is no pin #20. A connection to pin #6 is not needed.

TIP: Before you get too far, cut off about 3/4 inch of cable off one end of
your length of cable. Then, strip the insulation and foil from this piece or
use tweezers or forceps to remove the 9 wires from inside. Strip the
insulation off both ends of 4 of these wires, 6 if making a 25 pin connector
cable. These short pieces of wire will be needed to make the jumpers at each
connector. Twist one end of each of 2 wires together, and solder them both
pin #5. Then one wire can go to pin #4, and the other to pin #8 as in the
diagram.

Glossary for the above:
-----------------------
TD  == Transmit Data
RD  == Receive Data
RTS == Request To Send
CTS == Clear To Send
DSR == Data Set Ready
CD  == Carrier Detect
DTR == Data Terminal Ready

I've made their cable, and it works quite well (atleast the serial cable does)
So, this text is a culmination of all three - the original file, my comments
and ideas, and part of FastLynx documentation. (not 100% original though)

However, I'm sure you will build your own cable, either if based on the
Laplink 3 documentation, or either if based on the FastLynx one.  Both of them
will serve you as well!  Enjoy.

                           Note from Sir Knight
                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Since the huge amount of complains I've got on feedbacks at Chaos-IL systems
about publishing system numbers, I decided to include a VMS system number
that you can connect and use to excute all of the described and instructed
in the following article lines- , although, connection to a VMS system by
telnet is much recommanded.


            ***=>   VAX/VMS V6.2/V5.5:  177-022-7883   <=***


Before getting hard into, here's some basic information about VAX/VMS systems;
It all starts from the DECserver.  Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) company
creators of the VAX computer, which is running the VMS (Virtual Memory System)
operating system. VAX Stands for Virtual Address Extention.  The VAX is a
variation of the PDP (Programmable Data Processor) designed by DEC in 1978.
The VAX uses a 32 bit processor and "virtual" memory which has made it the most
popular computer in the history of the world.  The plural of VAX is VAXen.

Once a while, the people at DEC, has released a network server that runs
on the VAX computer and has many machines available from it.  This network
server is named DECserver.  Through the DECserver you can access many different
machines and systems, such as VAX computers and VMS systems that are operated
from them.  Adventionally, the DECserver is what links to the VAX/VMS systems,
and you will know a DECserver by the following login prompt:

_______________________________________________________________________________

DECserver 700-08 Communications Server V1.1 (BL44G-11A) - LAT V5.1
DPS502-DS700

(c) Copyright 1992, Digital Equipment Corporation - All Rights Reserved

Please type HELP if you need assistance

Enter username>

_______________________________________________________________________________

The starting up DECserver's login prompt will acceppt any username entered,
and will move you to logged season that is prompted like this: ' Local> '.
>From here and on, you are accessable to all the services provided by the local
VAX computer which is actually the DECserver you are connected to.  At first,
the most recommanded thing to act with, is to deeply explore the available
HELP section in the current DECserver.
DECservers provides a very friendly online Help guide, type 'HELP' to gain help
on all topics and commands available, you can learn alot about the system then
what this article describes by exploring all the Help sections.


SERVICES

As told before, the DECserver opens a wide services communication with many
different systems and terminals avialable.  Type 'sh services' to see all of
the available services from the current network server.  This will follow
something like that:

Service Name        Status       Identification

VLC1                Available    @SYS$MANAGER:ANNOUNCE.TXT


If the status shows Available, it still does'nt means its accessable to your
terminal specificlly.  Use the syntax of 'c <servicename>' (C is a shortcut of
CONNECT), Before connecting any service, you will know which services are a
VAX/VMS system if the Service's Identification shows @SYS$MANAGER:ANNOUNCE.TXT
or @SYS$SYSROOT:WELCOME.TXT and also any identification that starts up with
'Welcome to VAX/VMS', 'Welcome to OpenVMS', 'Welcome to VAX Assigened'.
The other services available, are a devices that are also operated from the VAX
computer you are currently logged into, these can be any LAT (Los Altos Tech.)
services, or device ports of the VAX computer that are reachable through the
DECserver, which can be hard-drives, disks, modem, printer, and any other
possible device.


OUTDIAL MODEM

One of the most interest and profitable things that you can find inside the
DECserver, is the modem, which gives you an out dial line for calls that wont
be charged by you.  There are some DECservers that you can find the modem
device listed with all the other services (in 'sh services' command), it will
show up like that:

Local> sh services

Service Name        Status       Identification
ALPHA1              Available     Welcome to OpenVMS Alpha (TM) Operating Syste
ALPHA2              Available    @SYS$MANAGER:ANNOUNCE.TXT
ALPHA3              Available           Welcome to VAX/VMS V5.5-2
PRINTER0            Available    PRINTER0
DIA0                Available
VMS80               Available    @SYS$MANAGER:ANNOUNCE.TXT
VMS13               Available    @SYS$MANAGER:ANNOUNCE.TXT
VMS30               Available    @SYS$MANAGER:ANNOUNCE.TXT


* It's obvious that service DIAL1 is the modem device port.  Connect the modem
  using the service connect syntax 'c <ServiceName>'.

Local> c DIAL1
Local -010- Session 1 to DIA0 established

*** DECTERM V8.03 ***
atz


This is a similar way of any Modem device that has been connected.  Through
the terminal, use the general AT commands for using the modem to dial.

Unfortunately, most DECservers are a bit more secured, and will let connecting
the modem device only for privileged user, or will shadow the device so it will
not be shown in the 'sh services' services listing.  There is a solution for
both of these security techniques;  Setting privileges in DECserver is simple,
there are a some default passwords that are always being used for privileges.
To get the privileges setting prompt, type 'set priv' and then try entering
one of the following defaults:

ACCESS
PRIVMODE
PRIVACC
DECSERV
FIELD
SERVICE
WORKDIV
SYSTEM
CONFIRM
DECNET

Enter the password as signal, and prompt enter.  If the password prompt repeats
after you entered the password, it means it's incorrent.  If you've recieved
the 'Local>' prompt back again, your password is correct and you are having
a privileged access to the current call.  While privileged, you will be able
to see the services that are available to you as in privileged access mode,
type 'sh services local' to see the services available in this season, and also
try typing 'show nodes' to look out for the outdial.  The modem can be shown
in a few ways while in the services listing; any similar words to 'TERMINAL',
'TERM', 'DIAL', 'MODEM' are assumed to be the outdial modem port.
Ofcourse the final and the best process to do for looking up for the dialout,
is to scan all available connections and service ports until you get it.
In high secured DECserver systems, the modem name will be shadowed, and even
when privileged you wont be able to see any similars or hints for it.  In this
case, try connecting the following services, either if they are not listed:

Syntax: c <servicename>


Service Name      Status
___________________________________
               |
 $1$DIA0       |  Reachable
 $1$DIA1       |  Reachable
 DS700         |  Reachable
 LTA5002       |  Reachable
 ADS9204       |  Unknown
 ADS8002       |  Unknown
 ADS3011       |  Reachable
 TERM          |  Unknown
 MODEM         |  Reachable
 DECTERM       |  Unknown
 COMMODE       |  Reachable


These are basiclly the mutations that a modem dialout device can be shadowed
within.  The above were successfuly connected, if none are working try find
the service name by your self. (Hint: look at the HELP section in topic SET)


VMS/VAX SYSTEMS - STARTUP INFORMATION

Many different VAX/VMS systems are available through the DECserver services.
VMS (Virtual Memory System).  You will know a VMS system by the following login
prompts at startup connection:

Local> c VMS_SER01
Local -010- Session 1 to VMS_SER01 established

(Screen is being cleared, and the following will be shown in ANSI terminal)

    #3
    #4
    #3  VAX/VMS  SYSTEM  Ver 6.2
    #4  VAX/VMS  SYSTEM  Ver 6.2
    #3
    #4
                  *** UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS IS PROHIBITED ***
Username: CHAOSIL

    Last non-interactive login on Wednesday, 27-NOV-1996 09:47
  26-FEB-1998 11:42:51
$


The second startup login prompt of the VMS system is:

        Welcome to VAX/VMS V6.1

Username:

_______________________________________________________________________________

Please note that in the second login prompt the screen wont be cleared up,
and the 'Welcome to' startup can be any text.  But in most of the cases, the
OS name and version will be shown as usuall.

TECHNIQUES OF ACCESSING A VMS SYSTEM

There are two facts about accessing a VMS system, which one of them stands for
the Hacker's good will, and the second stands for the VMS operating system
improvment of security.  The first fact that stands for our side is the similar
accounting methods that are in most of the VMS systems.  At first, try gain
access using the following default logins:

Username    Password
~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~
field       service
motor       service
design      support
systest     utep
jargon      field
digital     decnet
decnet      decnet

Sys Admin default logins (No password):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Username

fiber
system
compax
mac
laptop


The second part of accounting methods that is similar in VMS systems, is the
range of Local-Service Users (LSU).  Local-service Users are made to keep up
the legenth of the VMS's security net, these are demo users that were actually
transplanted into the VMS and each one of them serves a part from the security
net, or serves for automatic performs in the VAX computer.  LSU are operated
from files similar to UNIX scripts, and you can set them up as IRC-Bots to act
in the system on a specific date, time, area, system field, and the like.
(I will add more information about LSU in future, next issues), but at the
moment, you need them for the login operation, and so, its possible to login
as a LSU user as long as you know the account's name and as long as the LSU
is not currently logged.  LSU Accounts are single-simultaneous toggles.

LSU USERNAME ACCOUNTS:

USER105

AUSER2
CM50S_MGR
HUSER1
HUSER2
USEPL1241
USEPL1244
USEPL1246
USEPL1248
USERLM
USERLU

_______________________________________________________________________________

*NOTE: These are valid for OpenVMS VAX V6.2  &  OpenVMS VAX  V5.5.
All of them seems to work, you should try at least 5 logins from each series
of accounts.  For example, USERXXXX (4 Numbers digit) is one series, and the
USERXX (2 Numbers digit) is the compared one.  It's recommanded to do so,
since each series of accounts is used to something else in the system, and
each login from the accounts series is used to perform something else.
For example, when logged in with USER3000 your home directory in the system
include some secret material data files (Example!), and when logged in with
the account of USER3001, your home directory in the system is included with
some nice gaming programs for example, or anything else.
_______________________________________________________________________________


By now, you've been blowed with a couple techniques of accessing a VMS system.
If performing them slow and correctly, there is absolutely no doubt that
you'll gain yourself access.  As written before, either then the wide accessing
forms that VMS provides (as described above), VMS systems has also a fact that
stands for the system's sceurity;  Unlike UNIX machines, VMS operating systems
keeps track of all failed login attempts on each account that is exist on the
system, and if there were bad login attempts, the system informs the original
account owner about it by mail, and also include a full-log of the bad login
attempts that were made. (This method of system securing, is similar to an
"ACIDIC Login" PPE program for PCBoard BBS systems).

The mail that inform the original account owner is being receieved like that:

_______________________________________________________________________________

     #1          14-AUG-1
1997 16:30:08.99

     MAIL

 To:      CHAOSIL
 CC:
 Subj:    SYS$SYSTEM$LOGIN:TRACK_FAILS

 Amount of 2 failed logins attempted from your account registry:

 12:23:05.99-12/DEC/97:MYROCK:MYROCK001
 06:23:05.99-14/DEC/97:BURACA:PSWD22

 Please attention for further changes in your private registry.

MAIL>
_______________________________________________________________________________


* Which stands for:

 12:23:05.99-12/DEC/97:MYROCK:MYROCK001
 ¿ƒƒƒƒ¬ƒƒƒƒŸ ¿ƒƒƒ¬ƒƒƒŸ¿ƒƒ¬ƒƒƒŸ¿ƒƒƒ¬ƒƒƒƒŸ
     TIME       DATE    ACCOUNT   PASSWORD



This securing method, gives a heavy risk while trying to gain access.  Similar
copies of message such as these, are being mailed to the System Administrator
as once, and he might force the account owner to change his access information
right away.  Although, if you've already accessed the system using another
account, you can simply disable this securing method, by erasing the mail that
was auto-sent to the account and to the System Administrator. (Described in
the below title).


TECHNIQUES & USAGE OF THE VMS OPERATING SYSTEM

When first logged to the VMS system, alot of questions will come up in your
mind; such as what can you do through this system, and how to use it for your
own needs.  The first way you should act with, is try finding out what are the
purposes of the system you are connected to, like, what for does the system
exist, and what does it serves.  You can find all of these and alot more by
exploring the whole system.  Which means, getting into interest files, look at
all available commands and learn how to use them, reading messages that are
passed between the users, and finaly; make up the best of your needs out of
the system.  You cannot be guided through this, since each system acts in a
different way, and used for a different purpose.  Basically, the following
will guide you to get into each hole or field that is in the VMS system.


HELP
~~~~
VMS has a great on-line help section that is including examples of commands.
use it at any case to findout more about anything you've found.  The help given
is very well, and will get you through ANY difficult in usage.


THE WAY VMS NAMES FILES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Filenames in VMS make strange sense.  The format looks like this:

   filename.extension;version_number

Where the "version_number" is a number which gives you information on the
files revision.

In naming a file under VMS you can use 39 characters for the file name and 39
characters for the extension name.


WILDCARDS IN FILES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wildcards in VMS work just like they do in DOS, or DOS under W95.


PURGE
~~~~~
The purg command will delete all the files in your directory with multiple
version numbers saving only the last two.


SEEING WHO'S CONNECTED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The command 'show users' will print all the open ports of the system, and the
users that are connected to it at the moment.


VMS FILES MAINTENANCING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DIRECTORIES

Some of the commands are also similar to DOS commands, if you are anough
experianced with DOS (probably all), that will make it easier for you.

In the $ prompt, the system will respond with the directory path, like this:

$[SYSMNGR]:

The current directory is SYSMNGR.

* To create a directory use at the $ prompt, this command:

   create/directory [.name]

If you are creating a subdirectory off of your root directory you don't need
the whole directory path name.

* To change a directory, use the command:

   set default [.directory_name]

* To copy files, use the command:

   copy [-.stuff]*.*

INTERNET SERVICES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All valid internet services are available freely.

Use 'TELNET' to activate a Telnet communication program.
Use 'FTP' to activate a File Transfer Protocol communicator program.
Use 'IRC' to operate an Internet Relay Chat program.
Use 'RUN NETSERVER.EXE' to start a connection dialup to the internet. (do not
excute this command if connected already.  Otherwise, your current connection
will be crushed).

Within the service programs, use the same commands as used in DOS/W95 internet
programs.  Like OPEN/CONNECT to get a site connection in FTP/TELNET.
Or, /SERVER [SERVERNAME] to connect an IRC Server.

                  Security, Hints, and general Hacking

Here are some security notes, useful hints, and general Hacking information,
which can serve you alot after you got little bit into working with the VMS.


HACKER'S SECURITY

First thing to do when logged in, for getting yourself some security credits,
is to enable the account logging information to the file SYS$MANAGER:ACRT0.DAT
or to the file SYS$MANAGER:ACCOUNTING.DAT (depends by the system).  When the
account logging information gets enable to one of these files, you are possible
to do any actions, and erase the file when done your work.  To enable the
accounting and so, closing the system's audit process command the following:

at the $ prompt:

 SET ACCOUNTING /ENABLE    - Enables the account logging information
 SET AUDIT /ENABLE         - Enables the system's audit process

>From now on and until you're done for the current season, you are still not
completely blowed out of any logging.  If you are not logged in as a system
manager, or you have no privileges, these commands are left to be logged after
you enabled the accounting and the audit process:

/*/ Termination excutions /*/

BATCH               Termination of a batch job
DETACHED            Termination of a detached job
INTERACTIVE         Termination of an interactive job
SUBPROCESS          Termination of a sub process
PROCESS             Any terminted process


/*/ General commands /*/

PRINT               Print Jobs
IMAGE               Image execution
LOGIN FAILURE       Login failures
MESSAGE             User messages


The IMAGE command operations are actually being logged, but using IMAGE you can
disable the whole account logging facility!



PRIVILEGES THROUGH VMS IMAGE

The main idea here, is based on the following;  Images are used to describe
the account details regarding to the system settings, each set of a user mode
such as PRIVILEGED mode, or NORMAL mode, has an image installed which gives
the system an information about the account when it's logged.  For example,
an NORMAL mode account, as setted by the system, has an image installed which
disables him to read the password file for example.  On each command excuted
by the user, the system will check the image file to see if it's valid or not.

There is a similar way to hacking, for loading an privileges image to your
own account, and so, let the system make you privileged.
You can excute the following when logged in any mode;  From within your current
home directory, run the file DECW$DEVICE.COM in directory SYSMGR. (there are
files available to run from within the system manager's directory, and this
is one of them).  Run as the follownig syntax:

$ RUN SYSMGR$DECW$DEVICE.COM

After pressing return, you will recieve a fail operation message:

%DCL-W-ACTIMAGE, error activating image DECW$DEVICE.COM
-CLI-E-IMGNAME, image file $1$DIA0:[SYS0.SYSCOMMON.][SYSMGR]DECW$DEVICE.COM;2
-IMGACT-F-BADHDR, an error was discovered in the image header


The program you've runned is actually a utility to activate an sub-image for
privileged users.  Sub-image is the same as image script, but it's served by
the system administrators to run special programs from their privileged mode.
the sub-image is used for securing the system in a situation of an
un-authorized user is logged to the system (like us) and sabotaging.
The un-authorized user wont be able to do superior privileges if the sub-image
was not loaded.  When the privileged users sub-image is operated from a normal
mode account like in this case, it will simply get an error accord, and will
chancel your current loaded/activated image, which is a normal mode image.

After the normal mode image is chanceled, you are actually imageless, which
gives you the option to load ANY other image available.  And ofcourse, the
most great thing to do is loading the privileges image and become privileged.

After you've recieved the error image activating message while running the
file DECW$DEVICE.COM, you're image is chanceled.  Now, you'll have to install
a privileged image, and then to load it.

Run INSTALL.COM or INSTALL.EXE as the following syntax:

$ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:INSTALL.COM (or INSTALL.EXE)


Quit the program right after it loads by pressing CTRL-Y.

The privileged image is being installed one-by-one as the following;
The first char is the directory, the second name is the privileged command to
load in the image.

Install privileged executable images:
_______________________________________________________________________________

sys$system:analimdmp            /priv=(cmexec,cmkrnl)
sys$system:authorize            /priv=(cmkrnl)
sys$system:cdu                  /priv=(cmexec)
sys$system:chkp0strt            /priv=(cmexec,cmkrnl)
sys$system:chkcancmd            /priv=(sysprv,cmkrnl)
sys$system:init                 /priv=(cmkrnl,phy_io,sysprv)
sys$system:install              /priv=(cmkrnl,sysgbl,prmgbl,shmem)
sys$system:loginout             /priv=(cmkrnl,tmpmbx,log_io,sysprv,sysnam,altp)
sys$system:mail                 /open /header /shared
sys$system:mail_server          /open /header /shared /priv=(sysprv)
sys$system:monitor              /priv=(tmpmbx,netmbx)
sys$system:phone                /priv=(netmbx,oper,prmmbx,world,sysnam)
sys$system:request              /priv=(tmpmbx)
sys$system:rtpad                /priv=(tmpmbx)
sys$system:set                  /priv=(cmkrnl,sysprv,tmpmbx)
sys$system:setp0                /priv=(cmkrnl,sysprv)
sys$system:setrights            /priv=(cmkrnl)
sys$system:show                 /priv=(cmkrnl,netmbx,world)
sys$system:shwclstr             /priv=(cmkrnl)
sys$system:submit               /priv=(tmpmbx)
sys$system:sysman               /priv=(cmkrnl,setprv)
sys$system:vpm                  /open/header/priv=(tmpmbx,netmbx,sysnam,sysprv,
                                 ltpri,pswapm)


This data file is used to install the minimum set of VMS images required
for VMS to behave as documented.  That means it includes all privileged
executable images and those shareable images that user programs may be
linked against.

Run the file SYSTARTUP_V5.COM as the following syntax:

$ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM <Image command>

If the file is not exist in this directory, run it from your homedir:

$ RUN SYSTARTUP_V5.COM

<Image command> is the ' /priv=(... ' text.  For example, let's take this line:

sys$system:monitor              /priv=(tmpmbx,netmbx)

Which is actually built like that:

sys$system:monitor              /priv=(tmpmbx,netmbx)
¿ƒƒƒ¬ƒƒƒƒŸ ¿ƒƒ¬ƒƒŸ              ¿ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ¬ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒŸ
   DIR    IMAGE/COMMAND       IMAGE'S IDENTIFICATION COMMAND

To load the monitor command(image), that is located in directory SYS$SYSTEM ,
you'll have to use the SYSTARTUP_V5.COM loader as the following syntax:

$ RUN SYSTARTUP_V5.COM /priv=(tmpmbx,netmbx)

The SYSTARTUP_V5 program will reconize that ' /priv=(tmpmbx,netmbx) is the
identification command for the image MONITOR, and will so, install monitor to
you new image script, and when typing 'run sus$system:monitor' you'll be able
to load this file which is actually accessable for privileged only.
Install all the other commands by that syntax, until your image will be full
with all the commands, and able to load them.  Now, you are privileged, and so
accessable to any command or section.

When privileged, done your hack by accessing your password file.  Move to
some Terminal modem program, (such as Terminate, Telix) and set the capture on.
then, view the password file as the follow:

$ type SYS$SYSTEM:SYSUAF.DAT
       ¿ƒƒƒ¬ƒƒƒƒŸ ¿ƒƒƒ¬ƒƒƒƒŸ
        SYSDIR     VMS PASSWORD FILE

Make sure it have been captured.

Before signing off, make sure to delete the account logging file which you
enables at the first place.  These should be:


     SYS$SYSTEM:ACRT0.DAT  or  SYS$SYSTEM:ACCOUNTING.DAT

If you cannot delete it for some reason, dont get too much mass, edit the file
and clear all he contains.  Like:

$ EDIT SYS$SYSTEM:ACRT0.DAT

or

$ EDIT SYS$SYSTEM:ACCOUNTING.DAT

Only when you sure the password file have been captured successfuly, and the
accounting logging file is erased/empty, sign off, and enjoy your hack to
access the system using other accounts to retrieve any data that the system
can supply for your needs.  Always be careful, and make sure for your security.

05. How to script FT-RELAY Unix scripts


                                  ***
  


               ==========================================

                   How to script FT-RELAY Unix Scripts

               ==========================================

                             by Mr. Freeze

                       Designed to Chaos-IL, 1998


Maybe you'll find the following experience usefull - it is not general,
and it is applicable only for Unix hosts on the Janet network, but I'm
sure that there must be a dedicated VMS (or whateverOS) hacker who can
think of something similar for the appropriate OS.
When I want something from Simtel (or, any other software respository)
I go thru the ft-relay.  It's much faster than any other option.

I have written two little shell scripts which I have put into my ~/bin
directory (but it can be anywhere within your search path) and I have
called them ftget and ftget.proto (but it will work quite well under any
other name - providing a line or two were changed).
The ftget.proto is just an interface to the ftget script which actually
invokes the NIFTP/FTP transfer (it can be hhcp, or cpf, or fcp, or
whatever) via the uk.ac.ft-relay gateway.
The general way of invoking the transfer is:
short_hostname [-b] remote_directory remote_file
For each system I wish to connect, I add a symbolic link with an unique
hostname which points to the ftget.proto script, and add an extra line
into the ftget.proto script which will describe the new system.  Symbolic
link can be created by:
ln -s ftget.proto short_hostname
The extra line in the ftget.proto script (below the case statement) is of
the form:
short_hostname) host=some.host.university.edu;bdir=base_directory;;
You can set bdir to /pub or whatever, to shorten the typing for every
transfer.
As an example, if I want to collect a file from the Wuarchive.Wustl.Edu
(mirror of Simtel20, but more FTP lines, and faster thruput), let's say
the file: BAT2EX14.ZIP from the PCMAG directory, I stuff the command:
wustl -b pcmag bat2ex14.zip
where the script "wustl" is only a symbolic link (created by:
     ln -s ftget.proto wustl
Unix command) to the original ftget.proto script. The -b switch stands
for binary transfers.  The accompanying line in the ftget.proto reads:
    wustl)host=wuarchive.wustl.edu;bdir=mirrors/msdos;;
where mirrors/msdos is the common directory branch for the Simtel stuff.
Since you are using hhcp instead of cpf, you'll need to edit the ftget
script and replace the line:
    cpf $swch -U=$user@$host -p=$pw $dir/$file@uk.ac.ft-relay $file
with something like:
    hhcp $swch -T user@host -P $pw uk.ac.ft-relay:$dir/$file $file
due to the different syntax of cpf and hhcp.  If you change the name of ftget
script, make sure that you change the name in the ftget.proto.
I prefer to use the -T usename -P passwd compared to hhstore stuff, since
the username will change with the host you want to connect to (not to
mention the recent security scare about the hhstore).
You'll probably want to change the password for the anonymous FTP into your
email address.
That is just about all that I could think of. If you have an questions,
please let me know, and I'll do my best to try to answer them.

HHG Unix scripts
+--------------+

HHG Provide a convenient command to manage the collection of publicly
available directory listings and individual files from previously
specified Internet sites for a JANET host which runs hhcp under unix.
The HHG files are unix scripts which are almost ready to use. The
comments included in the scripts are intended to make them largely
self-documenting for those familiar with unix scripts.

* Use hhcp to get directory listings and files via FT-RELAY from specific
  site/directory combinations offering public access.

Here is an example of a HHG script, that I made a year ago:

#!/bin/sh
# hhg - version 1.0

[ -f $HOME/.hhgok ] || {
    for i in gawk hhalias hhstore hhcp
    do
        [ `which $i | wc -w` -ne 1 ] && {
            echo This utility needs $i. See your system administrator.
            exit 1 ;}
    done
    hhalias uk.ac.ft-relay ftb
    sort -u -o $HOME/.hhalias $HOME/.hhalias
    echo 'Required utilities for hhg are available' > $HOME/.hhgok ;}
# Send data, including this file, to gawk script for analysis and action
{ echo `hhstore -l ftb | wc -l` ; echo $* ; echo $0; cat $0 ;} | gawk '
# Start of gawk script
# Detailed reference for awk/gawk programming
#     "The AWK Programming Language", Aho,Kernighan,and Weinberg,
#      Addison Wesley
# Record whether hhcp transfer parameters are present for ft-relay
FNR==1 { if ( $0 ~ /^1$/ ) hhparam = "absent"
                     else  hhparam = "present"
         next
       }
# Record the command parameters
FNR==2 {
    site=$1 ; subdir=$2 ; file=$3
    if ( file=="-b" ) { swch="-b" ; file=$4 }
    if ( subdir=="" || ( swch=="-b" && file=="" )) { help="yes"; next }
    next
    }

Disclaimer

I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY TO DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE USE OF
INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE. SMOKING MARIJUANA IS BAD EXPENSIVE
AND CAN CAUSE HEALTH PROBLEMS.



-----------
Germination
-----------
For the germination process you'll need cotton and a plate.

Here is what you should do:

 1) Take the cotton and put it inside the plate.
 2) Soak the plate with water (not too much) so that the cotton will be moist.
 3) Take some of your best seeds and put them on the moisted cotton.
 4) Store the plate inside a dark place (a closet will be great).

and thats it! you've done the "hard" part, now all is left for you to do
is to keep an eye on the plate every 24 hours...
just to check if its still moisted, when its starting to dry moist it again!

(the trick is to keep the cotton moisted, if you'll let it dry even one time
you'll ruin the hole process).

After 7-14 days you'll see a root starting to come from the seed,
wait until the root will be 1.5 centimeter (approx.) and then plant it in
a secured area (a pot will be great!).



--------
Planting
--------
Hmmm... for the planting process all you'll need to have is a pot, and
fertilized soil.

Here is what you should do:

Go to a local nursery and buy a pot and some fertilized soil.
(dont use regular dirt from your local playground it might contains germs
and god knows what)

Now fill the pot with the soil... and plant the germinated seeds.
Be very very careful not to ruin the fresh root.
Immediately after you plant the seeds water them and keep them in a lightened
area.

Now before you'll start watering the plant and flood it with too much water
here are some tips and facts about the Marijuana plant that will help you.

 1) Marijuana "loves" direct sun light (the more sun-light the faster
    it grows!)
 2) The Marijuana roots "loves" air! so dont water it too much...
    I would recommend you to keep the soil moisted and water it every 3 days.
 3) The bigger the container (pot) is the largest the plant will be.

So thats it... now you know how to grow the damn thing :) all is left for you
to do is to wait until the plant will mature and then harvest.



----------------------
Harvesting & Drying...
----------------------
After 2 months of "hard" work :) the plant is big enough for harvesting...
But before you'll harvest the plant let me inform you with some more
important details!

The male version of the plant is worthless (it DOESN'T get you high!)
so if you get a male plant throw it to the garbage! dont even think
of smoking it... I bet you are asking yourself now how you can recognize 
between the male plants and the female plants. 
well... the male plant produces flowers and the female plant produces seeds.

So if you see that your plant contains some white flowers.. you know its a 
male! But if you see seeds instead of flowers then its a female!
When the plant is starting to produce seeds/flowers you know its time for
harvest.

To harvest the plant just rip it straight from its roots, and then store
the plant in a dark place (such as a closet) and let it dry slowly! dont
even think of drying it in the sun... (the heat will dry all the fluids
and the plant will be almost worthless) just let it dry slowly inside the
closet for 2 weeks. And after two weeks of drying, the plant will be crispy
to touch.. and life less :) then you can start smoking the leaves.
Only the leaves contains THC (THC is the substance that get you high)
so dont even think of smoking the roots of the plant..  :)

That it!! now you can grow marijuana for yourself (assuming you have the
seeds :)).

I've enclosed in this section some important information I forgot to add
to the main article.

-- brown seeds are healthy! -- white, gray, green seeds aren't healthy and
   probably wont germinate at all!
-- Beware of white flies. they can ruin your crop!
-- If you own a pet, make sure it wont ruin your crop... I have a friend
   that his dog ate all of his crop in a single day!! :)
-- More light for the plant the faster it grows -- you can buy some special
   light bulb and give the plant 24 hours light 7 days a week!

cuted. You can find an AS/400 Operating System at: 177-022-5445 ("MENORA" net)

(Once again, you can find this over 177-022-5445, "MENORA" Network)

My first instincts were to try and find a default password for it. 
So I started with login ROOT ; pw ROOT, no go, so I tried login GUEST ; pw 
GUEST. BINGO!! After typing the user id, press down, then go back to the start 
of the entry for the password then type that in, because pressing enter after 
entering your user ID, it will try to login, after you type in the password, 
then press enter to login. The next screen you will get is the main screen. 
And it should look something like this:

MAIN                           AS/400 Main Menu 
							  System:   BLAH400   Select one of the following: 

      1. User tasks 
      2. Office tasks 

      4. Files, libraries, and folders 

      6. Communications 

      8. Problem handling 
      9. Display a menu 
     10. Information Assistant options 
     11. Client Access tasks 

     90. Sign off 

Selection or command 
 ===>_#___________________________________________________________________

F3=Exit   F4=Prompt   F9=Retrieve   F12=Cancel   F13=Information Assistant  
F23=Set initial menu 
 Type option number or command.

A note with the logins. This system (AS/400), GUEST is a defualt, 
and should always work. Especially with school run systems, like 
universities. Some other defualts are login:QSECOFR ; pw: QSECOFR, which is 
the Security Officer, QSRV and QSRVBAS with passwords QSRV and QSRVBAS respectively, 
which are IBM Engineer's accounts, DST, which there are three of with passwords of 
DST, which stands for Dedicated Service Tools. But if this is perhaps not a school 
system, and maybe some company just set it up, but didn't bother too much to 
read the part on logging in and security in the user's manual, and left the 
system security to LEVEL 10, which is the lowest level of security on the 
AS/400, _*ANYONE*_ is allowed to login. The system will create a user profile 
for each new user, like a BBS, and users can access all objects on the 
computer.  
The next level of security is LEVEL 20, one of the defualt users on 
the system, like the sysadmin, called the Security Officer, must have creat-
ed user profiles for each user, so not just anyone can log in with anything,
but if you still can log in, then you have access to all objects on the 
system still.
The next level up on the security is LEVEL 30. At this level, the 
Security Officer must have created user profiles for each user like LEVEL 
20, but this time, access to objects on the system is restricted without 
prior Security Officer authorization.
And the highest level of security on the AS/400 is LEVEL 40. Access
to objects on the system is alot more restrictive then with LEVEL 30.
If you are wondering about the F13 & F23 commands at the bottom of 
the main screen, do not go nuts trying to figure out where these keys are.
They do come on an AS/400 system keyboard, but I am assuming you do not have
one of these, but if you do, go onto IRC and /dcc me it. To utilize F13 on 
your keyboard, hit [Shift] and hold down while pressing [F1], to use F14, hit 
[Shift] and hold while pressing [F2], and so on, until F24, it's a fairly easy 
concept to grasp.
Now, from this main menu, we can skip on over to the communications
menu, or main menu option number 6. Which should bring up a menu like this:

 CMN                             Communications 
							     System: BLAH400   Select one of the following: 

      2. Messages 
      3. Access a remote system 

      8. Send or receive files

	Hmmm... ahh there it is, number 3. Access a remote system. Type this on 
the command line, and it will bring you to our next menu. You don't have to 
worry about menu commands number 2 and 8 for now, figure those out later, for 
the moment we are going to just deal with number 3.

      2. Sign on using 5250 pass-through 
      3. Submit a network job 
      4. Submit a remote command 
      5. 3270 printer emulation 
      6. Remote job entry

Here is the AS/400 Remote System Communication menu. As for what to 
do with these, I have no idea how to use these. They appear to be for 
connection to a remote AS/400 system, and no others. I tried to connect to 
several unix hosts, but it would not recognize the DNS format. So if you know 
a system name of a remote AS/400 machine, you may be able to connect to it. 
Next we will move back to the main menu. But before I go into any 
other menu's, I want you all to be aware of a good AS/400 Connection utility, 
to help you actually use the correct commands. It is located at 
http://www.as400.ibm.com/client/cawin16.htm for windows 3.1. The FAQ for this 
software is included along with this file in the zip file, under client.faq 
as the filename. It is taken straight from the IBM Client Access for AS/400 
for windows 3.1 software page, which can also be obtained from the site 
mentioned above. IBM is the creator of this client access software, because 
IBM is the maker of the AS/400 system. I have not used this software, but it 
is the only software that I found that could be helpful with exploring the 
AS/400 system, in it's truest form aside form an AS/400 hardware setup. The 
AS/400 computer system has a very different keyboard then a PC keyboard. 
Also, for PC users connecting through telnet to an AS/400 system, some 
key shortcuts that I have found are as follows:

   Ctrl + K - delete line or charactars from the cursor on, not the                    full line. as the delete key will not work.

   Ctrl + C - go back a screen. (System Request?)

   Ctrl + X - move down a line.

   Ctrl + U - move to the bottom of the input area.

   Ctrl + H - move forward a space from the current cursor position.

   Ctrl + B - refresh screen, also Ctrl + L

   Tab Key  - field advance

   Scroll Lock - help key

   Print Screen - SysReq

A bit on the operating system now; AS/400 utilizes what is called 
Control Language commands, or CL commands. When these are entered from a 
prompt or input area from a main-type menu (i.e. the =>______ places), they 
will execute a specific command, and take you to a certain area of the system, 
or menu. Some CL commands that I know of are:

   chgpwd     - change password
   cpyf       - copy a file
   crtpf      - create a phsyical file
   dspmsg     - display messages
   dspusrprf  - display a user profile
   wrkmsg     - work with messages
   wrksyssts  - work with system status
   wrk usrprf - work with a user profile

User's profiles: or dspusrprf 
	
All users of the AS/400 must have a user profile. This contains the 
user's authority on the system. This tells who can sign on to a system, and 
what functions each user can perform after signing on to the system. 
A user profile contains the userid (sign on name), the user's 
password, the user library name, initial menu, job description name, output 
queue name, message queue name, and so on and so fourth. The user profile 
controls the user's access to system objects outside the user's library on 
the system. To view your own profile on the system, type on a command line:
	
	dspusrprf

then hit the F4 key. Then type in yout userid, and press enter. You will then 
get something like this:

			 Display User Profile - Basic

Quickly for one second, notice the "DATA" in the upper left hand corn-
er of the menu, this is the menu name. From the login screen, type in your 
userid, password, and go down to the menu option there, and type in the menu 
name you want to begin with. If you type data, it will bring you to this menu.
Now, first we will explore option number 4, or client access tasks, 
which will output this menu:

What this menu allsows you to do is self-explainitory. This menu is 
not to enlightening, so we will move on to the next option from the DATA menu, 
number 5. Integrated File System. Which will bring up this next menu:

 FILESYS                     Integrated File System 
							     System: BLAH400

	This menu is simple, but has alot of power, for instance, try option 
1:

FSDIR                         Directory Commands 
							     System: BLAH400   
 Select one of the following:

This allows you to make, delete, change, and display directories. 
This may not be much, but for you MS-DOS and UNIX users, these are more down 
to home commands that you are more used to. If you are on the AS/400, start 
yourself off with familliar things and commands like these, that way, you will 
learn it better. Like when you first went from MS-DOS to UNIX, you knew dir, 
which became ls. You knew cd, which was cd on unix, you first familliarized 
yourself with stuff you knew from your past expiriences. This is the closest 
you will come to familliar stuff. The next option from the previous menu was 
number 2, or object commands, which will call upon this menu:

FSOBJ                          Object Commands 
							     System: BLAH400   
 Select one of the following: 

      1. Work with object links 
      2. Display object links 
      3. Copy object 
      4. Rename object 
      5. Move object 
      6. Add link 
      7. Remove link 
      8. Check out object 
      9. Check in object

When you have had enough expirience with the AS/400 system, you will 
realize, that the system is heavioly based around Objects, which then this 
menu will come in useful to you. The next and final option from the FILESYS 
menu is 3, or security commands, which will bring up this menu:

FSSEC                         Security Commands 
							     System: BLAH400   
 Select one of the following: 

      1. Work with authority

This menu is the fun stuff. Option 2 will display what authority you 
have on the system. Option 3 will change what powers you have on the system, 
or your authority, as GUEST on this perticular system, you have no authority 
to change your own authority. Option number 4 will change the owner perm-
issions on your Object; GUEST. Option number 5 will change your primary login 
group, or the group your profile belongs to. Option number 6 will change you 
auditing value. I would show the menu's, but as GUEST, I do not have access to 
these menus.
	The next item I will cover is option F13, the Information Assistant. 
This is a set of online tutorals, sort of like the UNIX man pages. The AS/400 
has a set of online tutorals for a user, a manager, a programmer (AS/400), and 
other audiences. From the main menu, press 10, then enter. This will bring up 
this menu:

For the time being, forget all the options from this menu and let's just 
concentrate on option 21, Start online education. Which will bring you to 
another section, where you have to type in your name. Type in your first name, 
then press tab, then type in your last name, and press enter. (Of course you 
do not have to type in your REAL name =) Then it will bring yo to the next

Choose manage/400, (what I have access too), if you cannot access the 
manage/400 option, then you are in luck. I am not sure if all systems will 
allow access to manage/400 online tutorals, because it is sysadmin stuff, so 
if not, the best stuff is included. and then go down to security. 
Here is the outline of the system security plan. (What most systems you have

1/3          Purpose And Function Of A System Security Plan  

       Purpose  

	 To provide evidence of a comprehensive review of the access
	 control requirements of your system.

       Function  

	 The plan will be used by:

	 1)  Senior and line managers to document the organization's
	     requirements for access control

 2/3          Purpose And Function Of A System Security Plan  

       Function (Continued) 

	 The plan will be used by:

	 2)  Computer managers, to:

	     a)  Document the controls they intend to put in place to
		 meet the organization's requirements for access
		 control
	     b)  Form the basis for the access control elements of
		 the detailed operator procedures
	     c)  Assess the impact of system changes on access
		 control; for example, installation of a new menu
		 option

3/3          Purpose And Function Of A System Security Plan  

       Function (Continued) 

	 The plan will be used by:

	 3)  Auditors, who may be required to assess the
	     comprehensiveness of your system security.

									    1/9           What The System Security Plan Should Contain  

	 The structure of the System Security Plan will be dictated
	 by the controls you decide to put in place; however, we
	 suggest you have three main sections:

	 1)  Requirements for access control

	     In this section record access control requirements at
	     both the departmental and organization-wide levels.
	     This section should be as concise as possible and should
	     be easy to understand by staff throughout your
	     organization.



 2/9           What The System Security Plan Should Contain  

	 1)  Requirements for access control (continued)

	     Specifically, you should not refer to computer
	     facilities in this section.  Instead describe the
	     requirements which will lead to implementation of access
	     controls.

	     Your requirements should include an inventory of what
	     you need to protect together with an indication of the
	     severity of a breach in security.  The inventory should
	     contain specific entries such as trade secrets, as well
	     as more general items such as your program library.

 3/9           What The System Security Plan Should Contain  

	 1)  Requirements for access control (continued)

	     The inventory will be useful to you in:

	     a)  Identifying what you need to protect

	     b)  Setting priorities for implementing your system
		 security strategy.


 4/9           What The System Security Plan Should Contain  

	 2)  Provisions for access control

	     In this section describe the provisions you intend to
	     make for access control.  We suggest you describe these
	     provisions using the topic headings from this module:

	     a)  User IDs And Passwords
	     b)  Menu-based Access Controls
	     c)  Object-based Access Controls
	     d)  Data Level Access Controls
	     e)  Access To Communications Lines
	     f)  Physical Access Controls
	     g)  People Controls
	     h)  Additional Access Controls.

 5/9           What The System Security Plan Should Contain  

	 2)  Provisions for access control (continued)

	     Under each heading, describe the controls you intend to
	     put in place together with the people who will be
	     responsible for:

	     a)  Defining authorities under the control
	     b)  Maintaining the control
	     c)  Enforcing the control.

6/9           What The System Security Plan Should Contain  

	 2)  Provisions for access control (continued)

	     Note that it is not our intention that you should
	     describe procedures in detail in this document.  Instead
	     the System Security Plan will describe the procedures
	     which are required and who has the responsibility for
	     putting them in place.

	     Where you are responsible for implementing procedures,
	     you should describe them in the System Operations
	     Procedure Manual (See the Managing System Operation
	     module of Manage/400).

 7/9           What The System Security Plan Should Contain  

	 2)  Provisions for access control (continued)

	     Where you are responsible for executing procedures on
	     behalf of others, you should describe them in the Data
	     Control Manual (See the Managing User Support module of
	     Manage/400).


8/9           What The System Security Plan Should Contain  

	 3)  Implementation strategy

	     It is likely that, if you are starting from scratch,
	     your strategy might take some time to implement.  Your
	     plan should indicate the sequence in which you will
	     implement provisions.

	     It is also likely that you will be asked to provide an
	     indication of how long the implementation will take.  As
	     a minimum, you should describe contingencies (for example,
	     the provisions that need to be in place before a new
	     system goes live).

 9/9           What The System Security Plan Should Contain  

	 4)  Requirements which will not be implemented

	     It is likely that some access control requirements will
	     not be implemented because:

	     a)  You do not have the necessary technology or software
		 function to support them
	     b)  They would be too costly to implement
	     c)  They would be too restrictive to legitimate users.

	     You should, however, document that this is the case so
	     that they can be reconsidered when access controls are
	     reviewed.

 1/2                How To Build A System Security Plan  

	 We describe how to build a System Security Plan in two
	 sections.  The first provides advice on the mechanics of
	 producing the System Security Plan.  The second provides an
	 overview of the different kinds of access control you should
	 consider for inclusion in your plan.  We provide further
	 details on the different kinds of access control in
	 subsequent topics of this module.

 Select one or press Enter to review each option in turn:


       1.  Producing The System Security Plan 
       2.  The Kinds Of Access Control Available To You 

       3.  Complete This Subtopic 


 1/14               Producing The System Security Plan  

	 In order to produce a System Security Plan, you have to
	 balance two main sets of factors:

	 1)  Cost versus effectiveness

	     Completely effective security is elusive even to those
	     with very high budgets.  You will have to help your
	     organization decide on how to put in place an adequate
	     set of controls for a reasonable level of expenditure.


 2/14               Producing The System Security Plan  

	 1)  Cost versus effectiveness (continued)

	     For example, you are unlikely to be able to afford the
	     kinds of building access control equipment used by high
	     security installations.  However, the AS/400 allows you
	     to implement very effective protections against
	     unauthorized access by programming staff, at relatively
	     low cost.


3/14               Producing The System Security Plan  

	 2)  Inconvenience versus effectiveness

	     Any access control involves some inconvenience for those
	     who are subject to the control.  You will need to ensure
	     that security procedures are not so onerous that they
	     discourage, or even prevent, legitimate access.

	     For example, most people will (reluctantly) accept the
	     need for User IDs and passwords.  You will, however,
	     need to consider how often people should change their
	     passwords.

 4/14               Producing The System Security Plan  

	 In order to achieve these balances, you will need to:

	 1)  Determine the kinds of access control that are available
	     to you.

	 2)  Discuss access control requirements with Senior and
	     Departmental managers.

	     During this first pass you should try to encourage
	     people to drop excessive or arbitrary requirements.

 5/14               Producing The System Security Plan  

	 2)  Discuss access control requirements with Senior and
	     Departmental managers (continued)

	     It might be helpful to consider requirements in terms of
	     the following broad risk categories:

	     a)  Loss through occurrence of error
	     b)  Loss through disruption of computer services
	     c)  Theft of money or goods
	     d)  Theft of computer resources
	     e)  Loss through disclosure of sensitive information.



 6/14               Producing The System Security Plan  

	 3)  Where you do not see an obvious way to implement an
	     access control requirement, carry out further research
	     and, possibly, investigate the cost of additional
	     equipment or upgrades to your software.

	 4)  Return to discuss access control requirements with
	     Senior and Departmental managers, taking care to
	     investigate and resolve any inconsistent requirements
	     you are given.


7/14               Producing The System Security Plan  

	 A particular problem which regularly occurs during these
	 kinds of investigation is that, we tend to want to
	 restrict access to information unless there is a good
	 reason for someone to have it.  As a result, requirements
	 are often expressed in an arbitrary and extreme way.

 8/14               Producing The System Security Plan  

	 For example, we know of one Managing Director who considered
	 it particularly important for the computer to prevent people
	 in his organization from finding out how much he was paid
	 and the expenses he collected.  He did not realize that:

	 1)  As the highest paid director, his salary was in the
	     public domain

	 2)  Everyone in the Accounting Department, and everyone who
	     authorized purchase orders, had access to a filing
	     cabinet containing his expenses details.

 9/14               Producing The System Security Plan  

	 Also, it is common to find people still thinking in terms of
	 old, report-based systems.  These systems commonly produced
	 reports intended for relatively small work groups who then
	 had the responsibility to interpret them for others.

	 For example, the Accounting Department often had a monopoly
	 over financial information.

	 In modern online systems, access to the corporate database
	 is spread much wider.  The requirement to restrict access to
	 data is therefore superseded by a need for education and
	 training.

 10/14              Producing The System Security Plan  

	 To eliminate arbitrary, extreme and out-dated requirements,
	 you should try to ensure that:

	 1)  All requirements for access control are expressed in
	     terms of the real needs of your organization

	 2)  Managers understand the implications of implementing
	     their access control requirements in terms of cost,
	     effort and, possibly, discouraging use of the system.

	 It is usually more appropriate to think of everyone having
	 access to everything unless there is a good reason why not.

11/14              Producing The System Security Plan  

	 If you are still presented with extreme requirements, it is
	 often possible to demonstrate their impracticality outside
	 the computer environment.

	 People are usually less zealous about access controls
	 external to their computer systems.


 12/14              Producing The System Security Plan  

	 As soon as you have a reasonable picture of requirements for
	 access control and the kinds of control that are needed to
	 implement them, you should start producing your System
	 Security Plan.  Having produced your first draft, ask your
	 Senior and Departmental managers to review it to see:

	 1)  Whether you have correctly understood their requirements

	 2)  Whether they are prepared to accept the overheads needed
	     to implement suitable controls.

	 3)  Whether your suggested implementation strategy correctly
	     reflects organizational priorities.

						     
 13/14              Producing The System Security Plan  

	 Even if you eventually agree not to implement an access
	 control requirement you should still document it as a
	 requirement which will not be met.  Not only is this more
	 gracious to your Senior and Departmental managers, you might
	 find that the control can be implemented, having:

	 1)  Learned a bit more about what your system can do

	 2)  Discussed the requirements with other experienced people

	 3)  Installed upgrades to your software.


 14/14              Producing The System Security Plan  

	 Before producing your final version of the System Security
	 Plan you should consider asking someone else to review it
	 for technical and functional adequacy.  Possibly from one or
	 more of:

	 1)  Your group Information Systems function

	 2)  Your computer audit function

	 3)  Your applications software supplier

	 4)  IBM.

 1/10          The Kinds Of Access Control Available To You  

	 When describing what the System Security Plan should
	 contain, we suggest describing the provisions you intend to
	 make under the following headings:

	 1)  User IDs And Passwords
	 2)  Menu-based Access Controls
	 3)  Object-based Access Controls
	 4)  Data Level Access Controls
	 5)  Access To Communications Lines
	 6)  Physical Access Controls
	 7)  People Controls
	 8)  Additional Access Controls.

 2/10          The Kinds Of Access Control Available To You  

	 In this section we provide a brief overview of each kind of
	 control.

	 In the subsequent topics of this module we provide more
	 details on each one.


 3/10          The Kinds Of Access Control Available To You  

	 1)  User IDs And Passwords

	     All the computer-based access controls are based on the
	     principle of users:

	     a)  Identifying themselves through a unique personal
		 User ID which is public knowledge
	     b)  Proving they are who they claim to be through entry
		 of a password known only to that user.

	     You will need to ensure disciplined use of User IDs and
	     passwords to ensure continued effectiveness of your
	     computer-based access controls.

							     
 4/10          The Kinds Of Access Control Available To You  

	 2)  Menu-based Access Controls

	     This is the primary method of computer-based access
	     control in use at most sites.  Computer services are
	     presented to users as items on menus.  Each user is
	     assigned a relevant subset of all the available
	     services.  Any other services either do not appear, or
	     attempts to use them are rejected by the menu system.

 5/10          The Kinds Of Access Control Available To You  

	 3)  Object-based Access Controls

	     are imposed by the AS/400 and cannot be by-passed by
	     users or by programs.  They are useful for users who are
	     not bound by menu-based access controls, typically:

	     a)  The Security Officer
	     b)  The system operators
	     c)  Development staff
	     d)  Users of end-user computing tools such as AS/400
		 Query and PC Support.

 6/10          The Kinds Of Access Control Available To You  

	 4)  Data Level Access Controls

	     are used to restrict access to certain kinds of data
	     which cannot be expressed in terms of menu options.

	     For example, you might want to restrict access to
	     certain areas of your organization's accounts.  Your
	     application software might have a general inquiry
	     service which, when used to request data, checks
	     authority at the data level.

	     Alternatively, you might want to provide users with
	     Query access to a personnel file, but not to wages
	     details.
														       
 7/10          The Kinds Of Access Control Available To You  

	 5)  Access To Communications Lines

	     Special attention needs to be paid to communications
	     lines because you might have very little scope for
	     supervising who is using your system.  Although recent
	     court rulings have made it clear that so-called computer
	     hacking is illegal, you are still expected to ensure
	     that adequate access controls are in place.

 8/10          The Kinds Of Access Control Available To You  

	 6)  Physical Access Controls

	     Protecting access to data and programs is only one
	     aspect of system security.  Access to computer data also
	     depends on preventing unauthorized people from gaining
	     access to computer equipment, removeable media and
	     computer output.

	     Also, if you are not careful, your organization might be
	     creating a dual standard: one for computer data and
	     another for other written documents.  If your controls
	     over written documents are weak, you risk bringing all
	     forms of access control into disrepute and all your
	     effort might be undermined.
																      
 9/10          The Kinds Of Access Control Available To You  

	 7)  People Controls

	     There are various methods you can use to help prevent
	     people from making accidental misuse of your system.

	     We all hope that we will not employ people who will
	     attempt to gain malicious access to our systems.
	     However, such people do exist.  You need to:

	     a)  Detect unsuitable candidates when recruiting staff
	     b)  Draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable
		 behavior from staff you employ
	     c)  Minimize the potential for malicious use of system
		 services
																		       
 10/10         The Kinds Of Access Control Available To You  

	 7)  People Controls (continued)

	     d)  Ensure disciplinary procedures are effective
	     e)  Try to prevent staff from harboring a grievance
		 against your organization.

	 8)  Additional Access Controls

	     Finally, there are several controls which are a
	     by-product of good management practice implemented in
	     other areas.  For example integrity checks you introduce
	     into routine procedures might also be able to detect
	     inadvertent data corruptions.

									    
If you haven't noticed as of yet, Manage/400 is the tutoral system that 
is used to Manage an AS/400 system, so these tutorals are for the sys admins 
basically. The next topic that I think is important out there, is the User IDs 
and Passwords subtopic, of the security topic.

  

	 The following subtopics describe how to use and maintain
	 User IDs and passwords.

	 The examples given in this topic assume Resource Level
	 security (level 30) since this is the level we generally
	 recommend for users of the AS/400.

	 If you are unsure what security levels are, we suggest you
	 use the Route Map (via F3) to jump ahead to topic 5,
	 subtopic 3 which describes security levels.  You should then
	 use the Route Map to return here (Topic 3).


			     Select Subtopic  


 Select one of the following:


       1.  Using User IDs And Passwords 

       2.  Password Discipline 

       3.  IBM-Supplied Profiles 

       4.  AS/400 Security Officer 


 1/9                   Using User IDs And Passwords  

	 Most computer-based access control mechanisms require people
	 to go through a sign-on process to:

	 1)  Identify themselves to the system

	 2)  Prove they are who they claim to be.

	 On the AS/400, this is normally implemented through a User
	 ID and password scheme.  The User ID is public knowledge and
	 is used by system operators, for example, to identify who is
	 using a given terminal.  The password is kept private,
	 however, since it is the password that proves a user is who
	 he or she claims to be.

									     
2/9                   Using User IDs And Passwords  

	 The standard AS/400 sign on screen contains User ID and
	 password fields.  Note that the password is a non-display
	 field; data is not displayed as you enter it.  This makes it
	 more difficult for on-lookers to see what you type (although
	 you should be aware that some people get quite adept at
	 reading passwords from the keys as you press them).


 3/9                   Using User IDs And Passwords  

	 Although User ID and password schemes are the most common
	 ways to control access, there are other possibilities, for
	 example:

	 1)  Passwords can be supplemented by personal questions like
	     'What is your mother's maiden name?'.  Typically, each
	     user is asked to supply, say, twenty questions and short
	     answers to each one.  The computer then selects one or
	     two at random during each sign on.  The answers selected
	     by users do not have to be truthful, just something they
	     are able to remember.


 4/9                   Using User IDs And Passwords  

	 2)  Devices can be attached to terminals which require some
	     form of physical identification; for example, a magnetic
	     stripe reader or a signature verification device.

	 3)  Data can be encrypted using a key supplied by authorized
	     users.  This approach can be used to secure data against
	     even the administrator of the password scheme.


 5/9                   Using User Ids And Passwords  

	 Also, passwords do not have to be allocated to individuals:

	 1)  A common User ID and password can be used by an entire
	     work group

	 2)  Passwords can be allocated to levels of service rather
	     than individuals.  When a user wishes to use a sensitive
	     service he/she is required to enter the relevant
	     password.


 6/9                   Using User Ids And Passwords  

	 Shared passwords are usually used because they save people
	 from having to sign on and off shared terminals.

	 In practice, however, use of shared passwords results in:

	 1)  Poor password discipline

	 2)  Difficulties in keeping people up-to-date with shared
	     passwords

	 3)  An inability to produce adequate audit trails.


7/9                   Using User Ids And Passwords  

	 For these reasons we recommend you do not use shared
	 passwords except for services which do not compromise system
	 security.  For example, you might wish to publicize
	 information about your organization through an electronic
	 bulletin board which does not contain sensitive data.

	 This illustrates a general principle of access control:  you
	 need to find a suitable balance between the effectiveness of
	 controls and user inconvenience and cost of providing the
	 controls.


8/9                   Using User Ids And Passwords  

	 All forms of access control have their weaknesses.
	 Guaranteed security is not achievable and the highest levels
	 of security are only available at great expense and are
	 usually onerous to staff who have to use them.  In this
	 module we describe methods of access control which have a
	 general application in modern business systems.  If your
	 security requirements are particularly high, we suggest you
	 seek specialist security advice in addition to considering
	 the measures we describe in this module.

9/9                              Summary  

	 1)  The most common method for controlling access to the
	     AS/400 is a User ID and password scheme although more
	     sophisticated methods are available

	 2)  The use of shared passwords is, in general, discouraged

	 3)  You need to find a balance between effectiveness and
	     inconvenience/cost

	 4)  Seek specialist advice if you have particularly high
	     security requirements.


 1/29                       Password Discipline  

	 In order to ensure passwords are kept secret, you need to
	 instil certain disciplines into your organization about the
	 way they are used, covering:

	 1)  Regular password changes
	 2)  Sensible choice of new passwords
	 3)  Care during password entry
	 4)  Sign-off of unattended terminals
	 5)  Disclosure
	 6)  Documenting of passwords.

	 Each of these is discussed in the following sections
	 together with methods for ensuring your password discipline
	 is observed.
																      
2/29                       Password Discipline  

	 During this subtopic we make several references to system
	 values.  These are control values which allow you to tailor
	 some aspects of OS/400 to your needs.  All the system values
	 and the method for changing them are described in detail in
	 the AS/400 Work Management Guide.



					   
 3/29                       Password Discipline  

	 1)  Regular password changes

	     If passwords are not changed, then the risk of them
	     becoming known to others increases over time.  Also, by
	     changing passwords, users limit the possible damage that
	     might be caused by inadvertent disclosure.  Finally,
	     regular password changes are a useful way to remind
	     people about security and the importance attached to it
	     within your organization.

	     You can arrange for users to be able to change their own
	     password by providing them with a menu option to call
	     command CHGPWD.  This command doesn't have any
	     parameters.
																   
 4/29                       Password Discipline  

	 1)  Regular password changes (continued)

	     There are several ways to ensure passwords are changed
	     regularly:

	     a)  You can arrange for new passwords to be allocated to
		 individuals, say, once a month.  This has the
		 advantage of guaranteeing new passwords are used but
		 does not allow users to choose passwords they are
		 likely to remember.  There is therefore a greater
		 likelihood people will write passwords down and
		 leave them for others to see.

 5/29                       Password Discipline  

	 1)  Regular password changes (continued)

		 It is also possible that new passwords will be
		 intercepted in the internal mail unless you arrange
		 for them to be delivered personally or, possibly,
		 through the system itself.

		 Note, you can use a computer program to generate
		 random passwords.  However, you should be aware that
		 it is not simple to generate true random numbers
		 this way.  You should make sure that 'random'
		 sequences cannot easily be recreated by others using
		 the same program.

					      
 6/29                       Password Discipline  

	 1)  Regular password changes (continued)

	     b)  You can use system value QPWDEXPITV to force users
		 to change their password in a given time interval.
		 Users are warned their password is about to expire
		 for seven days before the expiration date.  You can
		 override this requirement, or set a different
		 expiration period for individual user profiles
		 through the PWDEXPITV parameter of the Change User
		 Profile (CHGUSRPRF) command.


 7/29                       Password Discipline  

	 1)  Regular password changes (continued)

		 Again, this ensures regular changes and is the
		 approach we usually recommend, but some users will
		 object to the system forcing them to change their
		 passwords and they might look for ways to get around
		 the process.

 8/29                       Password Discipline  

	 1)  Regular password changes (continued)

		 For example, they might have two passwords which
		 they continually switch between.  You can prevent
		 this by setting system value QPWDRQDDIF to '1' which
		 causes the AS/400 to verify that a new password does
		 not match any of the previous thirty-two passwords.
		 However, you should be aware that this can be very
		 irritating to users and you should explain the need
		 for it in your Terminal Operator's Guide.

 9/29                       Password Discipline  

	 1)  Regular password changes (continued)

	     c)  You can use the Display Authorized Users (DSPAUTUSR)
		 command, say, once a month to find out users who
		 have not changed their passwords in the previous
		 month.

		 You can then send them a memo asking them to change
		 their password.  Follow up memos can then be sent
		 with copies to Senior Managers.

		 This is the approach most users would prefer, but it
		 requires more effort and administration than other
		 methods.
														    
 10/29                      Password Discipline  

	 2)  Sensible choice of new passwords

	     If people are asked to select their own passwords, they
	     will obviously want to choose ones they are likely to
	     remember in the future.  Most password breaches,
	     however, occur because 'hackers' are able to guess
	     passwords.  Common selections are:

	     a)  Names of family members
	     b)  Favorite football or cricket teams
	     c)  Telephone numbers
	     d)  Vehicle registrations
	     e)  'A', 'FRED', 'PASSWORD', 'TEST' or the person's User
		 ID.
																   
hehehe "hackers", nice security on this system... :)

 11/29                      Password Discipline  

	 2)  Sensible choice of new passwords (continued)

	     OS/400 does not allow even the Security Officer to see
	     other people's passwords.  If you want to review
	     passwords, you will have to introduce a program to store
	     passwords in a data file before changing the user's
	     profile.  One way to do this is to write the program as
	     a password validation program identified through system
	     value QPWDVLDPGM.  Note that you would have to use
	     object-based access controls to ensure this data file
	     cannot be read by unauthorized staff (see topic 5 of
	     this module).

12/29                      Password Discipline  

	 2)  Sensible choice of new passwords (continued)

	     Alternatively, you can use AS/400 system values to
	     switch on one of the following checks for all new
	     passwords:

	     a)  QPWDMINLEN and QPWDMAXLEN to set the minimum and
		 maximum length of passwords (discourages use of, for
		 example, single character passwords)

	     b)  QPWDLMTCHR to disallow up to ten given characters

	     c)  QPWDLMTAJC to disallow adjacent digits (discourages
		 use of telephone numbers and PIN numbers)
																	   
13/29                      Password Discipline  

	 2)  Sensible choice of new passwords (continued)

	     d)  QPWDLMTREP to disallow character repetition
		 (discourages of passwords like: AAAAAAA)

	     e)  QPWDPOSDIF to force every character to be different
		 from the previous password (discourages use of very
		 similar passwords)

	     f)  QPWDRQDDGT to force at least one numeric digit
		 (discourages use of names, for example).

14/29                      Password Discipline  

	     If these are not appropriate to your situation, you can
	     elect to supply your own validation routine (via system
	     value QPWDVLDPGM).  However, you will have to ensure
	     this routine is safeguarded because it intercepts all
	     new AS/400 passwords entered through the Change Password
	     (CHGPWD) command, and a modified version could pass them
	     outside the security environment.

	     Again, the approach likely to be most popular with users
	     is that they be allowed complete freedom to select new
	     passwords.

 15/29                      Password Discipline  

	 3)  Care during password entry

	     You should encourage users to ensure that people do not
	     watch the keyboard while they enter passwords to the
	     system.

	     You should also explain to people that it is common
	     courtesy to look away while others enter passwords.  You
	     should make sure that support staff (particularly those
	     from outside your organization) are aware of and follow
	     this practice.


 16/29                      Password Discipline  

	 4)  Sign-off of unattended terminals

	     People should be encouraged to sign-off when they leave
	     terminals unattended.  This prevents someone else from
	     using that person's profile.

	     Where someone works in an open plan environment or a
	     shared office this might be seen as less important, but
	     establishing the need for vigilance and for signing-off
	     all terminals when an office is unattended can be
	     difficult to enforce.

 17/29                      Password Discipline  

	 4)  Sign-off of unattended terminals (continued)

	     You can force automatic sign-off for unattended
	     terminals through system values:

	     a)  QINACTITV which determines the time period
		 subsystems should wait before checking for inactive
		 terminals (say, once every fifteen minutes)

	     b)  QINACTMGQ which determines what subsystems should do
		 if they detect an interactive terminal has been
		 inactive since the last check.

 18/29                      Password Discipline  

	 4)  Sign-off of unattended terminals (continued)

	     You can use these variables to specify:

	     a)  No checking is to be done

	     b)  The current activity for the terminal should be
		 cancelled - you should check with your application
		 software supplier that this does not jeopardize data
		 integrity


 19/29                      Password Discipline  

	 4)  Sign-off of unattended terminals (continued)

	     c)  A message is sent to a message queue; this can be
		 used to trigger a program which can decide
		 appropriate action.  For example, you might decide
		 that only certain terminals need this protection or
		 that different inactivity periods apply to different
		 terminals.


 20/29                      Password Discipline  

	 5)  Disclosure

	     People should be discouraged from disclosing their
	     passwords to ANYONE else, including people who are
	     normally given widespread information access (such as
	     support staff, consultants and auditors).

	     Occasionally, it might be necessary for support staff to
	     use services which are not in their user profiles; for
	     example, to try to reproduce a fault seen by a user.
	     You should use the Terminal Operators' Guide (See the
	     Managing User Support module of Manage/400) to make it
	     clear that, in this situation, users still have
	     responsibility for how their ID is used.
												      
 21/29                      Password Discipline  

	 5)  Disclosure (continued)

	     The Terminal Operators' Guide should make it clear that,
	     at all times, users are accountable for actions taken
	     under their User ID.  The Guide should also explain
	     user's rights to challenge anyone who requests access
	     through their User ID.

 22/29                      Password Discipline  

	 5)  Disclosure (continued)

	     You can help users detect when their ID and password
	     have been used by someone else, by specifying on user
	     profiles that:

	     a)  A sign-on information screen is displayed when users
		 sign-on; this identifies, for example, when the
		 profile was last used - the user should report a
		 breach if this is not right

	     b)  The same user cannot sign-on simultaneously at more
		 than one device.

				     
 23/29                      Password Discipline  

	 6)  Documenting of passwords

	     Some users will not be able to memorize passwords.
	     Particularly those who do not have to use the system
	     frequently.  They will therefore want to write passwords
	     down.

	     You should use the Terminal Operators' Guide to explain
	     the danger of leaving written copies of the password
	     lying around.  In some sites we have even seen passwords
	     taped onto terminals!


 24/29                      Password Discipline  

	 6)  Documenting of passwords (continued)

	     Some passwords will be known to only one or two people.
	     It might therefore be necessary to write them down to
	     ensure they are available at times of emergency when key
	     staff are not available.

	     The usual procedure is to keep the password in a sealed
	     envelope kept in a (preferably fireproof) safe.  You
	     should make sure the envelope is completely sealed
	     (there is a well-known method of removing and replacing
	     the contents of envelopes through the gap at the top)
	     and that the seal is inspected regularly.

					 
 25/29                      Password Discipline  

	 To a significant degree, any password mechanism relies on
	 responsible attitudes from password holders.  To promote
	 this we suggest you:

	 1)  Make sure you have a clear business justification for
	     the access controls you introduce, particularly those
	     which are onerous to users.  Otherwise:

	     a)  You will discourage people from using your system,
		 unnecessarily

	     b)  You risk weakening your entire strategy if people
		 find out some of your controls are arbitrary.

					
 26/29                      Password Discipline  

	 2)  Determine the extent to which you want to use the system
	     to enforce password discipline.

	 3)  Explain what good password discipline is.

	     The obvious place to do this is the Terminal Operators'
	     Guide (See the Managing User Support module of
	     Manage/400).

 27/29                      Password Discipline  

	 4)  Explain the importance your organization attaches to
	     password discipline.

	     You should arrange for a reference to password
	     discipline to be included in the terms and conditions of
	     employment of users, together with a warning that
	     breaches will be treated as serious misconduct.

	     Finally, if breaches of discipline do occur, you need to
	     be sure that Senior and Departmental Managers will take
	     steps to enforce password discipline by their staff.

 28/29                            Summary  

	 1)  Password discipline is a key component in your access
	     control provisions

	 2)  Password discipline covers:
	     a)  Regular password changes
	     b)  Sensible choice of new passwords
	     c)  Care during password entry
	     d)  Sign-off of unattended terminals
	     e)  Disclosure
	     f)  Documenting passwords.

	 3)  You should make sure you have a clear business
	     justification for the access controls you introduce.

				
 29/29                            Summary  

	 4)  You should make sure users:

	     a)  Understand the principles of password discipline
	     b)  Know they are required to observe these principles
		 by Senior and Departmental managers.

The next section of this, gives the defaults for the system, the ones that 
come with the package. With the logins and passwords.

 1/9                       IBM-Supplied Profiles  

	 On the AS/400, each User ID is associated with a user
	 profile which contains the user's password and describes
	 his/her access rights.

	 IBM supplies the AS/400 with several user profiles already
	 set up for you.  There are, in addition, several profiles
	 needed for processes internal to AS/400 operation.

	 It is essential that, before you use the system to store any
	 sensitive data, you change all the default passwords
	 supplied with these profiles.  Failure to do this means that
	 anyone with knowledge of the AS/400 can sign on to your
	 system.

			  
 2/9                       IBM-Supplied Profiles  

	 We feel particularly strong about this because:

	 1)  It is very easy to change IBM-supplied passwords

	 2)  We have direct experience of a company which lost
	     valuable trade secrets through a Customer Engineer
	     password which had not been changed

	 3)  Despite clear warnings from IBM, we commonly find
	     installations have not changed the IBM-supplied
	     passwords and are astonished with the ease with which we
	     are able to 'break' their security.

 3/9                       IBM-Supplied Profiles  

	 If you have not already done so, you should perform the
	 following steps to change the default profiles:

	 1)  Sign on as the system Security Officer (QSECOFR, default
	     password QSECOFR)

	 2)  Use the Change Password (CHGPWD) command to change the
	     Security Officer password.  Take great care as you do
	     this.  If you change the password and lose it, you will
	     be unable to operate your system.  We suggest you write
	     down the new password, place it in a sealed envelope and
	     lock it away.

 4/9                       IBM-Supplied Profiles  

	 3)  Use the Display Authorized Users (DSPAUTUSR) command to
	     identify all the profiles which can be used to sign on
	     to the system.  If there is an 'X' in the 'No Password'
	     column, that user profile cannot be used to sign on to
	     the AS/400; the profile cannot jeopardize your security
	     scheme.

 5/9                       IBM-Supplied Profiles  

	 4)  Use the Change User Profile (CHGUSRPRF) command to
	     change the passwords for all the profiles which can be
	     used to sign on.  If you want to use the profile, enter
	     a new password.  Otherwise, enter PASSWORD(*NONE) to
	     disable the profile.  Note, you should not try to delete
	     IBM-supplied profiles as some of them are used by
	     internal processes.

	     Note that profiles QSRV and QSRVBAS are used by IBM
	     service representatives.  You must however change the
	     supplied passwords because these profiles allow access
	     to sensitive data

 6/9                       IBM-Supplied Profiles  

	 5)  Finally, use the procedure described in the AS/400
	     Operator's Guide to execute an attended IPL sequence and
	     invoke the Dedicated Service Tools (DST).  When you are
	     asked to enter a password, enter QSECOFR.  Choose the
	     'Change Password' option to alter the three DST
	     passwords.


 7/9                       IBM-Supplied Profiles  

	 The IBM Customer Engineers (CEs) might need access to the
	 Dedicated Service Tools and the Service profiles if you
	 encounter a system problem or if you upgrade your system.

	 The CEs will not object if you (or the Security Officer)
	 insists on signing on for them (to avoid revealing the
	 relevant passwords).  Nor will they object if someone
	 insists on supervising their activities.  In fact, CEs often
	 enjoy explaining what they are doing and you can learn a lot
	 from them.

 8/9                       IBM-Supplied Profiles  

	 CEs will not arrive on site without checking with you first.
	 So you should challenge any unexpected visitor who calls
	 himself an engineer.  All CEs carry identification and you
	 can also check their authenticity through your usual call
	 dispatch phone number.


 9/9                              Summary  

	 As soon as possible, you should change the default passwords
	 supplied by IBM:

	 1)  Security Officer

	 2)  Other IBM-supplied profiles

	 3)  DST passwords.


The next section deals with the security officer.. and maybe even how to 
override his password.

 1/9                      AS/400 Security Officer  

	 Every AS/400 is supplied with a special profile (QSECOFR)
	 which is described as the Security Officer.

	 The Security Officer profile has special privileges which
	 allow the password holder to have access to almost any
	 AS/400 object including all data files and programs.  The
	 Security Officer profile is therefore used for much of the
	 work of creating and maintaining access controls on the
	 AS/400.

	 Even the Security Officer does not have the ability to see
	 AS/400 passwords.  If people forget them, the Security
	 Officer can enter new ones but can't tell them what the old
	 ones were.
													   
 2/9                      AS/400 Security Officer  

	 If the Security Officer password is forgotten, the Dedicated
	 Service Tools (DST) can be used to reset it to its supplied
	 value of QSECOFR.  This process (described in the Security
	 Considerations chapter of the AS/400 Security Concepts and
	 Planning Manual) requires the DST security capability
	 password.  If both passwords are lost your system will be
	 inoperable.

	 A common concern we encounter at AS/400 sites is: 'who
	 should have access to the Security Officer password?'


 3/9                      AS/400 Security Officer  

	 There is a real dilemma here:

	 1)  People who understand how to use the Security Officer
	     password present a threat to system security.

	 2)  People who do not understand how to use the Security
	     Officer password have to:

	     a)  Either sign on so others can use the password

	     b)  Or execute commands dictated to them by others

	     In either case, the password holder has no way to check
	     what is going on.
														   
 4/9                      AS/400 Security Officer  

	 To resolve this, we recommend one of the following two
	 approaches:

	 1)  Allocate the password to someone with computer
	     expertise, but only if the risk is balanced by the trust
	     Senior Managers have in the individual.

 5/9                      AS/400 Security Officer  

	 2)  Allocate the password to someone without computer
	     expertise and insist that the following procedure is
	     adopted for each use of the password:

	     a)  The person wishing to use the password should write
		 down in advance the commands they intend to use, and
		 why.  You can then arrange for a random check of,
		 for example, the source code of programs the person
		 intends to use.  You should keep the document
		 secured for review later on, to check that the use
		 was justified.

	     b)  The password holder should sign on and either
		 perform the necessary commands or supervise their
		 entry by the requester

	     c)  The password holder should then sign off using the
		 *LIST option (which causes a log of the commands
		 entered to be generated)

	 2)  Procedure for using the Security Officer password
	     (Continued)

	     d)  The forms and output from the session should be
		 filed in the Implementation Log (See the Managing
		 Change module of Manage/400) with a copy filed
		 securely so that it cannot be interfered with before
		 there has been an opportunity to audit it.

	     Occasionally, without warning, someone from outside your
	     organization with knowledge of the AS/400 should be
	     asked to review changes and procedures to ensure they
	     are appropriate to the stated purpose.

			     
8/9                      AS/400 Security Officer  

	 In any case, you should ensure that the Security Officer
	 profile is not needed for routine use.  Instead it should
	 only be needed in exceptional situations.  This is likely to
	 mean that the Security Officer profile will have to be used
	 to create new profiles for programming staff and system
	 operators (See the topic: Object-based access controls in
	 this module).

	 You might also consider arranging for the Security Officer
	 profile to be available at only some of the terminals on
	 your system.  We explain how to do this in subtopic 5 of
	 this topic.

 9/9                              Summary  

	 1)  The Security Officer profile has privileged access to
	     the system; you must take care not to 'lose' it

	 2)  You need a strategy for using the password, that fits
	     your situation

	 3)  You should make sure the Security Officer password is
	     not needed for routine system tasks

	 4)  You should consider restricting the number of terminals
	     which can be used by the Security Officer.


The next section i will include is, the Access to Communications section.


	 In this topic, we describe approaches to controlling access
	 from outside your organization through communications lines.

			     Select Subtopic  


 Select one of the following:


       1.  Electronic Customer Support 

       2.  Communications Lines 

 1/4                    Electronic Customer Support  

	 We recommend in Manage/400 that you use the IBM-supplied
	 modem to make good use of the Electronic Customer Support
	 (ECS) facilities available to you.

	 You might be concerned that this facility can be used by
	 people outside your organization to dial in to your system
	 in order to gain unauthorized access.  In particular, if you
	 use the remote power-on feature, you are required to set the
	 modem so it answers telephone calls automatically.

 2/4                    Electronic Customer Support  

	 The most common ways to use the IBM modem are for:

	 1)  Dialling out to IBM's DIAL service

	 2)  Dialling out to IBM's Customer Engineering services

	 3)  Remote power-on which requires the modem to answer an
	     incoming call, but which does not require a
	     communications session to be established.

	 Therefore, there is no inherent need for OS/400 to respond to
	 incoming calls.  The default ECS environment supplied by IBM
	 cannot be used by someone dialling in to establish a
	 connection with your system.
														  
 3/4                    Electronic Customer Support  

	 You can ensure this is still the case by signing on to the
	 system as the Security Officer and entering the commands:

	     CHGLINSDLC QTILINE SWTCNN(*DIAL)
	     CHGLINSDLC QESLINE SWTCNN(*DIAL)

	 while the modem is not being used for connecting to DIAL or
	 the Customer Engineers.  These commands direct the system to
	 allow the ECS environment to be used only for dialling out.

 4/4                    Electronic Customer Support  

	 If, however, your support organization uses the IBM-supplied
	 modem to dial in to your system, you should not use these
	 commands because they might disable this facility.  Instead
	 you should consider the controls described in the next
	 subtopic.

 1/5                       Communications Lines  

	 Before explaining the various controls available to you to
	 secure communications lines, you might find the following
	 definitions helpful.

	 The AS/400 uses Line descriptions, Controller descriptions
	 and Device descriptions to control the way communications
	 sessions are established.

	 1)  Line descriptions define the way you want to use
	     physical links such as telephone lines.

 2/5                       Communications Lines  

	 2)  Controller descriptions define the characteristics of
	     the remote system or device controller you are
	     connecting with; for example, you might create a
	     connection with another AS/400, or a controller with
	     displays and printers attached to it.

	 3)  Device descriptions define the characteristics of
	     devices you want to communicate with.  Devices can be
	     physical, such as displays and printers, or logical such
	     as a pass-through session or a program interface.

3/5                       Communications Lines  

	 Communications lines can be 'switched' or 'non-switched':

	 1)  Switched lines use public telephone systems to dial
	     remote users and establish connections when they are
	     needed.  Alternatively, a remote user can dial a
	     switched line in order to establish a connection with
	     your system.

	 2)  Non-switched lines are permanent connections to a remote
	     site or sites.  They cannot be used by anyone else
	     directly, although the more sophisticated networks
	     include the ability to use a switched line if a primary
	     connection fails.

       5.  Complete This Subtopic 

 1/13                         Denying Access  

	 People situated remotely can access your system in two main
	 ways:

	 1)  They can dial in to switched lines or, possibly,
	     switched backups to non-switched lines

	 2)  They can use a range of AS/400 connectivity features to
	     use non-switched lines for unauthorized purposes or,
	     possibly, to access data they would normally not be
	     allowed to use.

 2/13                         Denying Access  

	 It might therefore be appropriate to establish barriers
	 which prevent:

	 1)  Dial-in access to communications lines

	 2)  Use of general facilities which are not needed in your
	     organization.

	 We describe the methods available to you in the following
	 sections.


 3/13                         Denying Access  

	 1)  Preventing dial-in access to communications lines

	     There are four basic methods available to you:

	     a)  You can ensure that inactive line descriptions are
		 permanently 'varied off', this renders the line
		 description inactive, and therefore unusable, until
		 they are varied back on.

		 Note: a line can have more than one description,
		 although only one can be varied on at any time.


 4/13                         Denying Access  

	 1)  Preventing dial-in access to communications lines
	     (continued)

		 Use the Work With Configuration Status command:

		 WRKCFGSTS *LIN

		 to list all the line descriptions on your system and
		 place a '2' (vary off) in the option column next to
		 all the descriptions you don't want to use and press
		 Enter.

 5/13                         Denying Access  

	 1)  Preventing dial-in access to communications lines
	     (continued)

		 Then use the WRKLIND *ALL command to list line
		 descriptions for modification and use '2' in the
		 option column against the relevant line descriptions
		 with:

		 ONLINE(*NO)

		 in the parameter field and press Enter.  This
		 prevents OS/400 from varying on the line description
		 automatically in subsequent system initializations.

			       
6/13                         Denying Access  

	 1)  Preventing dial-in access to communications lines
	     (continued)

	     b)  You can delete redundant line descriptions.

		 If a line does not have a line description, it
		 cannot be used for any kind of communication.

		 Use the WRKCFGSTS command as before to vary off the
		 relevant devices.


7/13                         Denying Access  

	 1)  Preventing dial-in access to communications lines
	     (continued)

		 Then use the Work With Line Descriptions command:

		 WRKLIND *ALL     (or F14 on the WRKCFGSTS display)

		 to list line descriptions for modification and use
		 option 4 to delete the superfluous descriptions.

 8/13                         Denying Access  

	 1)  Preventing dial-in access to communications lines
	     (continued)

	     c)  You can instruct OS/400 not to accept calls on
		 switched lines.

		 Use the WRKCFGSTS command as before to vary off the
		 relevant devices.

 9/13                         Denying Access  

	 1)  Preventing dial-in access to communications lines
	     (continued)

		 Then use the WRKLIND command to list line
		 descriptions for modification and use option 5 to
		 display details for all lines of type: *ASYNC, *BSC
		 and *SDLC.  If any have a connection type of *SWTPP
		 (switched line) you can use WRKLIND option 2 with
		 the parameter:

		 SWTCNN(*DIAL)

		 to limit use of the relevant line descriptions to
		 dial out only.
			      

 10/13                        Denying Access  

	 1)  Preventing dial-in access to communications lines
	     (continued)

	     d)  You can configure your modem equipment so that calls
		 are not answered automatically.  Instead, operator
		 intervention is required.  The method for doing this
		 is usually a switch on the modem, but should be
		 described in its operating instructions.
		 Alternatively, you can use modem equipment which is
		 incapable of answering incoming calls.


11/13                        Denying Access  

	 2)  Preventing use of general facilities

	     Use one or more of the following Change Network
	     Attribute (CHGNETA) commands to do this:

	     a)  CHGNETA JOBACN(*REJECT)

		 Causes your system to reject all job streams sent to
		 your system over communications lines (this does not
		 affect the normal submit job mechanism).

 12/13                        Denying Access  

	 2)  Preventing use of general facilities (continued)

	     b)  CHGNETA DDMACC(*REJECT)

		 Causes your system to reject all attempts from
		 remote systems to use Distributed Data Management to
		 access files on your system.

	     c)  CHGNETA PCSACC(*REJECT)

		 Causes your system to reject requests from Personal
		 Computers via PC Support.

 13/13                        Denying Access  

	 2)  Preventing use of general facilities (continued)

	     You can also use system variable QRMTSIGN to disable
	     access to your system via display station pass through.


 1/5                    Operator Controlled Access  

	 You can control access to non-switched lines by using the
	 Work With Configuration Status (WRKCFGSTS) or Vary
	 Configuration (VRYCFG) commands to vary lines, controllers
	 and devices on and off as required.

	 For example, a line cannot be used unless it has been varied
	 on: you can therefore arrange for the connection to a branch
	 office to be active only when staff need to use it.

	 In the previous section we explained how to ensure that
	 lines are not varied on automatically during system
	 initialization.

 2/5                    Operator Controlled Access  

	 For dial-in access to switched communications lines, you can
	 ensure that requests can only be accepted manually.

	 This is usually done via a system operator, but can be
	 anyone with physical access to the handset attached to the
	 communications line and authority to the Answer Line
	 (ANSLIN) command.

 3/5                    Operator Controlled Access  

	 The person wishing to make the connection calls the operator
	 who speaks to the caller and verifies the connection request
	 is valid.  The operator can then invoke the command:

	     ANSLIN linename

	 possibly via a menu option and, when requested by the
	 AS/400, press the data button on the telephone handset to
	 make the connection.

 4/5                    Operator Controlled Access  

	 To implement this approach use the following Work With Line
	 Descriptions command:

	     WRKLIND *ALL

	 to list all the line descriptions on your system.  Use
	 option 5 to display details for all lines of type: *ASYNC,
	 *BSC and *SDLC.


 5/5                    Operator Controlled Access  

	 If any items on the WRKLIND display have a connection type
	 of *SWTPP (switched line) or Activate switched network
	 backup set to *YES (Switched backup line can be used), use
	 option 2 with the parameter:

	     AUTOANS(*NO)

	 to enforce a manual answering procedure.


 1/16                  Controlling Automated Access  

	 It is likely that, if you have dial-in lines which are in
	 frequent use, you will want to make it as straightforward as
	 possible for authorized users to establish connections.  It
	 will probably be inappropriate for operators to have to
	 intervene to manually answer a call.  You will therefore
	 rely on computer-based access control to preserve security.

	 Similarly, if you have non-switched lines you will rely on
	 computer-based access controls to be sure that they are not
	 used for unauthorized purposes.

 2/16                  Controlling Automated Access  

	 This is actually a reasonably sensible approach: one can get
	 over-concerned about access over communications lines.  It
	 might be much easier to gain physical access to your
	 offices.  The underlying strength of your security strategy
	 is the key issue to concentrate on.




 3/16                  Controlling Automated Access  

	 You should consider the protection you want to put in place
	 against the following kinds of access:

	 1)  Remote display devices, including Personal Computers
	     emulating displays

	 2)  Remote printers, again including PC emulators

	 3)  Inter-system connections initiated on your system

	 4)  Inter-system connections initiated by remote systems.


 4/16                  Controlling Automated Access  

	 The access controls we describe in this module apply to all
	 users of your system, regardless of whether they are sited
	 locally or remotely.  The following sections describe the
	 provisions which are specific to communications users.

 5/16                  Controlling Automated Access  

	 1)   Remote display devices

	     Your principal form of access control is the User ID and
	     password.  We recommend that, in general, you should use
	     the Change System Variable command:

	     CHGSYSVAL SYSVAL(QMAXSIGN) VALUE('3')

	     to ensure that a display is varied off if a user
	     attempts to sign-on unsuccessfully three times in a row.

	     This is particularly important for dial-in lines because
	     it prevents someone from trying a number of different
	     passwords until they get lucky.
														      
 6/16                  Controlling Automated Access  

	 2)  Remote printers

	     Printers can be susceptible because they do not need a
	     user to sign on.  The system automatically starts a
	     writer for printers when they connect to the system, and
	     any documents which are ready to print can then start.

	     It is therefore possible that output can be sent to an
	     unauthorized user.

7/16                  Controlling Automated Access  

	 2)  Remote printers (continued)

	     However, the first thing a writer does when it starts
	     printing, is to print a single line and it then sends a
	     message asking if the line-up is correct.  You specify
	     on the device description which message queue to use,
	     the default is the system operator message queue (QSYSOPR).

	     It is likely that you will want to specify that line-up
	     messages are sent to a display device sited near the
	     printer.

 8/16                  Controlling Automated Access  

	 2)  Remote printers (continued)

	     You can do this with the Change Device Description -
	     Printer command:

	     CHGDEVPRT DEVD(printer name) MSGQ(QSYS/display name)

	     For general operation, this means that someone needs to
	     sign on to the specified display in order to start
	     printing documents.  This gives some assurance that the
	     correct (ie authorized) printer is on the other end of
	     the line.

 9/16                  Controlling Automated Access  

	 2)  Remote printers (continued)

	     For complete security, you will also need to ensure that
	     the message queue is not left in (default) *DFT mode.
	     This instructs the AS/400 to respond to messages with a
	     default reply and for the line-up message, this says
	     ignore the line-up and continue printing.
	     Alternatively, you can execute the following Change
	     Message Description command:

	     CHGMSGD MSGID(CPA4002) MSGF(QCPFMSG) DFT(C)

	     so that the default reply is 'C' which cancels the
	     writer and stops any printing.
												    
 10/16                 Controlling Automated Access  

	 3)  Inter-system connections initiated on your system

	     People outside your system do not need any special
	     authority since connections are initiated from your
	     system.

	     In practice, there is unlikely to be potential for
	     by-passing security in this situation, particularly if
	     one of the following is true:

	     a)  The program which initiates the connection has
		 limited function.

 11/16                 Controlling Automated Access  

	 3)  Inter-system connections initiated on your system
	     (continued)

		 For example, Telex/400 initiates a program which
		 automatically responds to telex messages.  Although
		 the public has access to this program through the
		 telex network, Telex/400 ensures this cannot be used
		 to breach your security.

	     b)  The program is run under a user profile with limited
		 object access capability.  Even if users are able to
		 take advantage of such a program, your object access
		 controls will protect your system.

				
 12/16                 Controlling Automated Access  

	 3)  Inter-system connections initiated on your system
	     (continued)

	     You should, however, make sure you understand the
	     purpose and function of all programs which use
	     communications lines.  At any time, you can find out
	     which programs are using communications lines through
	     option 5 (Work with job) of the Work With Configuration
	     Status (WRKCFGSTS) display.

 13/16                 Controlling Automated Access  

	 4)  Inter-system connections initiated by remote systems

	     In order for an inter-system connection to be
	     established from outside your system, there needs to be
	     an active subsystem which contains a communications
	     entry which matches the request.

	     You can therefore restrict this kind of communication
	     by:

	     a)  Not running subsystems with communications entries.
		 Note that both the environments supplied by IBM
		 (QBASE and QCMN) have such entries, so you might
		 consider creating new, tailored subsystems.
													 
14/16                 Controlling Automated Access  

	 4)  Inter-system connections initiated by remote systems
	     (continued)

	     b)  Removing communications entries from the subsystems
		 you intend to use.

	     c)  Changing the communications entries to limit their
		 scope.  In particular, any entry with a default user
		 can be evoked without a User ID and password.  The
		 default user profile is used instead.  If entries
		 have a default user (DFTUSR) entry of *NONE, all
		 evocations (requests for connection) must specify a
		 User ID and password or they will be denied.

			      
15/16                 Controlling Automated Access  

	 4)  Inter-system connections initiated by remote systems
	     (continued)

		 We suggest you execute the following Change
		 Communications Entry (CHGCMNE) commands to limit the
		 scope offered by the IBM-supplied environments:

		 CHGCMNE SBSD(subsystem) DEV(*APPC) DFTUSR(*NONE)
		 CHGCMNE SBSD(subsystem) DEV(*ASYNC) DFTUSR(*NONE)
		 CHGCMNE SBSD(subsystem) DEV(*BSCEL) DFTUSR(*NONE)
		 CHGCMNE SBSD(subsystem) DEV(*SNUF) DFTUSR(*NONE)

	     Where 'subsystem' is QBASE if QBASE is your controlling
	     subsystem, or QCMN if it is QCTL.

	     The Using Work Management Functions chapter of the
	     AS/400 Work Management Guide provides more information
	     on how to maintain subsystem descriptions.

 1/10                    Additional Possibilities  

	 You might need to consider some of the following
	 possibilities:

	 1)  Data encryption

	 2)  Dial-back

	 3)  Protection against unauthorized access through protocol
	     converters

	 4)  Modem set-up.

	 The following sections cover each point in more detail.

		       
 2/10                    Additional Possibilities  

	 1)  Data encryption

	     Encryption is a method for scrambling data using a key
	     known only to people authorized to access the data.  It
	     offers two major benefits:

	     a)  If someone is able to break your security and gain
		 access to data, encryption presents another level of
		 security.

	     b)  Your system might hold a limited amount of data that
		 has to be kept secret from even the Security
		 Officer.

		      
 3/10                    Additional Possibilities  

	 1)  Data encryption (continued)

	     Encryption allows you to preserve security even if two
	     separate groups have highly confidential information
	     which they do not want to disclose to each other.

	     You have a number of encryption facilities available:

	     a)  AS/400 Cryptographic Support is a licensed program
		 which uses encryption to protect information in
		 transmission over communication lines, or stored in
		 media such as tapes and disks.  More information is
		 provided in the AS/400 Cryptographic Support User's
		 Guide.
				   




4/10                    Additional Possibilities  

	 1)  Data encryption (continued)

	     b)  The QUSRTOOL library supplied with OS/400 contains a
		 utility called SCRAMBLE which you can use to encrypt
		 and decrypt data.

	     c)  You can add encryption equipment to your
		 communications lines.  Normally this is only
		 appropriate for non-switched lines.  An encoder,
		 which is transparent to IBM protocols, is required
		 at each end of the connections you want to protect.

5/10                    Additional Possibilities  

	 1)  Data encryption (continued)

	     d)  There are a large number of encryption programs
		 which run on Personal Computers.  However, you
		 should be aware that although they can all be used
		 to deter casual access, it is extremely difficult to
		 implement watertight security for PCs.

		 If you use AS/400 PC Support to store data in shared
		 folders, you should be aware that some of the more
		 sophisticated encryption systems are incompatible
		 with shared folder support.


				   
 6/10                    Additional Possibilities  

	 2)  Dial-back

	     A dial-back facility automatically accepts a dial-in
	     call, verifies the caller's ID and password, and
	     terminates the connection.  It then dials the caller
	     back using a list of authorized telephone numbers in
	     order to establish the required connection.

	     The AS/400 does not support dial-back directly, but you
	     can:

	     a)  Produce a small program to provide this facility
	     b)  Obtain modem equipment which supports dial-back
		 independently of the AS/400.
									

 7/10                    Additional Possibilities  

	 3)  Protection against unauthorized access through protocol
	     converters

	     You can attach communications lines via protocol
	     converters in such a way that the AS/400 is unaware of
	     them.  For example, a Twinax to Async protocol converter
	     allows you to add asynchronous dial-in lines that appear
	     to the AS/400 to be a local Twinax-attached display.

	     In this case you will not be able to use some of the
	     protections we describe in this topic.  Instead, you
	     should ensure that the protocol converter, together with
	     the standard ID and password protections, are adequate
	     for your needs.
														       
 8/10                    Additional Possibilities  

	 4)  Modem set-up

	     In general the protocols used by the AS/400 ensure the
	     AS/400 is aware when a connection to a device is broken
	     (for example, by a poor connection or a user switching a
	     device off).  In these cases, the AS/400 automatically
	     terminates that session.  If the device was a display,
	     the next person to connect to the system will see the
	     standard sign-on display.


 9/10                    Additional Possibilities  

	 4)  Modem set up (continued)

	     Asynchronous circuits, however, can be set up in such a
	     way that a connection always appears to be made.  This
	     is dangerous because if a connection fails part-way
	     through a session, another user can dial in and continue
	     the session, by-passing the sign-on screen.

	     To ensure this doesn't happen, you should:

	     a)  Verify with your modem suppliers that, at the AS/400
		 end, 'signal Data Set Ready' can be made to follow
		 'Data Carrier Detect' and make sure this feature is
		 implemented
															  
 10/10                   Additional Possibilities  

	 4)  Modem set up (continued)

	     b)  When your communications are installed you should
		 check that terminating the connection at the remote
		 end (for example, by disconnecting the modem from
		 the wall socket) causes the AS/400 to end all
		 communications sessions (messages to this effect
		 will be sent to the Operator Message Queue -
		 QSYSOPR).

 5/5                              Summary  

	 1)  It is reasonably straightforward to deny dial-in access
	     to your system

	 2)  For low-use lines where dial-in access is required, you
	     can ensure operator intervention is needed

	 3)  Your controls over other types of communications line
	     rely heavily on User IDs and passwords

	 4)  Securing most forms of communication is straightforward,
	     but complexity increases with inter-system connections
	     and low cost asynchronous connections.  You might need
	     professional advice in these environments.

						      
Last but not least...



	 This topic covers various aspects of personnel management
	 which have a relevance to system security.

	 It is possible or even likely that you will not be in direct
	 control of some of these aspects.  This makes it even more
	 important that your System Security Plan should ensure that
	 Senior Managers in your organization are alerted to the full
	 impact of system security on your organization.


1/12                     Electronic Supervision  

	 Electronic checks are made using the facilities of the
	 AS/400.  They are not disruptive to staff and can be a major
	 deterrent because they can be conducted from anywhere in
	 your network, with no warning.


 2/12                     Electronic Supervision  

	 You should consider using the following facilities to carry
	 out random checks:

	 1)  Work With Active Jobs (WRKACTJOB)

	     Using this command you can display all system activity
	     and find out what is going on.  For interactive displays
	     that are in use, the Display Job option helps you find
	     out:

	     a)  What programs the user is using
	     b)  What files they are using
	     c)  What OS/400 commands they have used so far.

									    
3/12                     Electronic Supervision  

	 2)  Display Authorized Users (DSPAUTUSR)

	     To monitor the use of user profiles and check that:
	     passwords are being changed regularly and out of date
	     profiles are being deleted.

	 You should consider using WRKACTJOB and DSPAUTUSR fairly
	 often since the commands are simple to use and the checks
	 don't take much time.

 4/12                     Electronic Supervision  

	 3)  Display Object Description (DSPOBJD)

	     Consider using this command to send details of all your
	     production programs to a database file.  You can then
	     analyze this file in several ways; for example, you can:

	     a)  List the programs which have been changed since a
		 given date (to check the changes have been
		 authorized)

	     b)  Use the file cross-reference facility of Query,
		 together with the previous DSPOBJD file, to identify
		 all additions and deletions to the program
		 libraries.
				     
 5/12                     Electronic Supervision  

	     You can then verify whether your change control
	     procedures are being used to document all changes and
	     spot any changes that might not have been authorized.

 6/12                     Electronic Supervision  

	 4)  Display Program Adoptions (DSPPGMADP)

	     Use this command to monitor programs which adopt
	     ownership access rights (particularly any owned by the
	     Security Officer).

	 5)  Check Job Description User Profiles (CHKJOBDUSR)

	     Use this command (supplied in the OS/400 QUSRTOOL
	     library) to monitor use of user profiles in job
	     descriptions (described in subtopic 2 of topic 5 of this
	     module).

 7/12                     Electronic Supervision  

	 We suggest you use the DSPOBJD, DSPPGMADP and CHKJOBDUSR
	 commands, say, once a quarter to monitor changes.  If you
	 have programming staff, you should not give advance warning
	 of the test.

 8/12                     Electronic Supervision  

	 6)  Display Object Authorities (DSPOBJAUT)

	     Use this command to check that object access rights have
	     not been interfered with.

	 7)  Display User Profiles (DSPUSRPRF)

	     Use this command to verify that user profiles have not
	     been interfered with.  Note that you can send details to
	     a database file for reporting via, for example, AS/400
	     Query or PC Support.


9/12                     Electronic Supervision  

	 8)  Check Object (CHKOBJ)

	     Use this command with the AUT parameter to verify that
	     your object-level access controls work as expected.

	 We suggest you use DSPOBJAUT, DSPUSRPRF and CHKOBJ on a
	 sampling basis in conjunction with your review of changes.
	 You will probably want to make sure you include checks
	 against some of your more sensitive files (such as a
	 payroll) more frequently than other, less sensitive, ones.


 10/12                    Electronic Supervision  

	 Your computer audit function can also help you design a
	 system which produces a semi-random sample of data biased
	 towards large or sensitive transactions.  Such a sample is
	 much smaller than a full audit trail and is perhaps more
	 likely to be reviewed thoroughly.

	 If you decide to take such an approach, it can often be used
	 by your external auditors as a key factor in gaining the
	 assurance they need.

11/12                    Electronic Supervision  

	 In any event:

	 1)  A strong element of randomness should be built in

	 2)  Take advice on an appropriate sampling percentage

	 3)  Keep the sampling algorithm secure

	 4)  It might be best if someone independent chooses and sets
	     the precise sampling criteria.

12/12                    Electronic Supervision  

	 Finally, keep evidence of the checks you have made and their
	 results.  This will help you demonstrate the effectiveness
	 of your review procedures to your computer auditors.



And this concludes the basics of security and fucntions on the AS/400
system. I will update this article probably until the next Chaos-IL issue,
or by the time i will obtain more information about the AS/400.

Note! there is a FAQ, specifically for this article, and you can also mail
me regular comments.

Cellular phones are great tools for any hacker/phreaker.
They can NOT be traced, they are mobile, and you can easily modify them.
Although CID for cells is in the making (I am sure) all you have to do is
modify the cell over and over, and you wont get caught.

Before I teach you how to modify a cell phone. Let me teach you
the basics of how it works. Cellular companies have stations which
have honeycomb like structures called cells. Each cell is capable of
having certain number of calls and usually handles an area. The phone
sends its into to the tower, and it gets access so it can place the call.
The phone actually sends and recieves at the same time. So there are 2
channels involved. If you know one, you know the other because they are
45 appart. (simple math, if you gonna be a phreaker/hacker you can atleast
figure this out. :} )...


ESN- Electronic Serial Number
MIN- Mobile Identification Number
NAM- Numeric Assignment Module
FOVC- Forward Voice Channel
FOCC- Forward Control Channel
ROVC- Reverse Voice Channel
RECC- Reverse Control Channel


Your phone also has software in it. It has a chip with actuall
sofware written to control its functions. Each make and brand name has a
different software. Software can be modified to your advantage. You will
learn more about this later in this text.


Now that you know how it works you should know "how not to get
caught". Basically if you are doing a major hacking project, change
your physical location and the ESN.MIN pair every 2 hours or so. If you
just call some LD calls, then you can change it like ATLEAST once a day.
This is because of 3 simple things. The 1st is that the cellular company
has clonning detection, and mostly to Cellcom and Motorola.


Let's take a live shoot. For example, you are 20 miles away from the actuall
owner of a cellular phone. If he makes a call, then you make a call within
5 minutes a clonning flag goes off, because they know where you are located!
and since there is no way for him to get to where you are in 5 minutes a
security flag goes off on his account. Second reason is that they know
approximately what area you are in when you use the phone, so if they want
to catch you the'll use directional antena and catch you. Thats
why if you move around alot and change pairs alot they cant catch you! and
third reason is the owner of the phone might get charged for your calls, so
switch pairs around so that you dont ruin someones life! (have morals in all
that you do, your morals dont have to be what society wants them to be, just
set them for yourself.)


The company that makes the cell puts a permanet ESN on your phone
which is not made to be changed. It is permanently burned into a chip. Your
phone also has software thats in it. Its kinda like a cellular operation
system. Each type and brand of phone has different software. All phones
allow you to change the NAM and other features. So here lets assume you
already got a pair you want to put into the phone (I'll teach you how to
snag pairs later in this manual). There are several ways you can do that.
On some phones you can make a cable and use software on your computer to
change the esn.min pair. This software is readily available to you on
the internet. There is a second way which is 100% better then the first.
You can burn new software into your phone that will alow you to change the
ESN and store it at a different location. You can make this software if
get the original software (you gonna have to read the chip, then work
your way to the origian software) and add some minor adjustments to it.
If you do not have programming skills you can go to your web browser and
go to www.l0pht.com and go to Dr. Who's radio-phone (its in archives) and
you will find what you need there. So now you that you have that, can
now change the ESN, and you can change the MIN. Thats it! you just now
clonned a cellular phone. But dont think that is it, hundreds of other
fun things you can do with your cellular phone.

Ok. You now have a phone that allows you to change the ESN and the
NAM. But what fucking good is that gonna do you if you cant get (snarf) the
ESN.MIN pair. There are alot of ways to get pairs I will present some
methods to  you that already work and at the end of this manual I will
include some ideas you can try that no one else has tried before.



Method 1
_____________________________________________________________________________

There is software available that you can use with your modified
scanner to recieve pairs using your computer. Look for it on the net.
I suggest trying all the web search engines. I have seen that stuff on
alot of pages I visited...I used Dr. Who's text that he wrote it in a way
that you guys can easily understand.
____________________________________________________________________________


Thats it. Its that simple. This works very easily, your scanner picks up the
RECC (reverse channels where the pairs are transmitted) then you just convert
them to readable format. simple!


But clonning is not all you can do with your cellular phone.
You can monitor other calls with your cellular phone also. The only
problem is handoffs. They occur because a person moves out of range from
a cell, and a handoff occurs. He gets transported to another cell.
But this can also be easily conquered. If you have a Motorola all you have
to do is put it into test mode, and unmute the audio, and go to a channel
and listen! So your cellular phone can also be a tracking and spying device.
The posibilities are unlimmited. have lots of cellular phun!


---Ideas for your hungry mind---


 I have personally seen with my own eyes a Pelephone cellular pick up the
 channel where ESN.MIN's are transmited (yes I heard it, the transmition
 of the pairs makes the most annoying noise I have ever heard. hehehe).
 so now all you gotz to do is convert them and store them.. I believe
 that someday someone will create a phone that can do that. you can also
 convert somehow (think hard, I wont give you this one) and store in
 your computer.......I even heard rumors that someone had a phone that
 works like this: you put the number you want to call, push send, then
 the phone snarfs a pair, and uses it just for that one call! I also
 heard rumors of phones having 1000 ESN.MIN's in them, and they use them
 up slowly. I AM NOT SURE IF THESE RUMORS ARE TRUE, THEY CAN BE LIES..
 but we can make them true.

___________________________________________________________________________

# End. I made this manual short and complete. If you want to learn more
  I suggest asking someone who cares because I don't. I wrote this manual
  to help those who are motivated enough to get off thier ass and learn more.

              ISP (Internet Service Providing) Hacking in Israel
              ---------------------------------------------------
        Written By Blue-Grass / Designed to thr Chaos-IL magazine 1998
  
As you all know, most of "scene" people in Israel use hacked accounts.
It all started few years ago, when someone understood that if shell accounts
can be hacked then it won't be a big deal to hack ISPs. I used to be a warez
scener and i had most of Israel ISPs accounts, hacked ofcourse.
Trendline, Aquanet, Isracom. Internet gold and even Netvision where the main
"account suppliers". In fact, as i remember, Trendline held the israeli scene!
user lists where spread to all sceners and anyone who wanted a nice account
that could hold few monthes got one. After a year or so, Netvision user files
where out and so aquanet. Hackers just hacked the isp and pulled out the user
file, 2 minutes to crack and you have a list of 1800 users, just choose the
easiest password to remember and get online. since these files where so easy
to get and some people even spread them on main channels like #israel, you can
guess who putted his handes on those lists... the ISPs. Since the ISP learned
the consequences, it is really hard to find a good updated lists. so one
choice is to card a small IBM account, or to use 135 wich is pretty fast but
MONEY IS PAYED. Some people blame the ISPs that they "killed" a whole scene.
Now, as I remember, Trendline was the most hacky ISP around all it takes to
hack them is to enter their unix box through any open port and hackable one
(most of their ports are opened) and then you have two choices: 1) get your 
root in your favourite way. 2) pull the userfile and crack it.
Hacking trendline is a bit harder now since they treated their system better 
but it's still hackable. Use port 80 and check for people with accounts for 
shells. since not many people have hacked trendline, convince them to give you
the l/p so you will be able to hack trendline and then give anyone an account.
Netvision is harder but possible. Use the same methods but take care becuase 
Netvision registers IPs.

It seems like people don't want to mess with it anymore. But it seems like
people doesn't want to pay as well... so take a cup of coffee, sit few
houres and let us enjoy fast and free internet.

Credit Cards Phreaking By OXiD
------------------------------
Many frauds are taking place nowdays when almost every web page tries
making its money by on line orders.
What do we care about it you ask? well,We can gain much from the fact that
there are people who are stupid enough to on line order a product and take
advantage of their stupidity.
First,in order to obtain cards from all kinds,the most common way is by web
hacking.A hacker won't have a problem making his way into a system and
downloading a users files if needed or a credit cards lists if wanted.
But there are other ways of credit cards frauds in the internet except
hacking,you can always set a false web page which gets on line orders,and
the rest is self explained.
You can always cheat people into giving you the cards by phone but that's up
to your manipulation abilities and their lack of wisdom.

                        The Art of Israeli Carding
                      \----------------------------/

Hi'a everybody and welcome to the new guide of my way to get cc-#s and full
info in a new mistake proof way fitting for israely costumer suckers invented
by me - Elmer Scud!
Well First i'd like to announce that 1nce in 2-4 weeks i'll publish 2 things :
    1. a list of israely FULLY working cc-# ( supplied with full information ).
       The file to look for will be called : "cc#s-0X.NFO", where X is the #
       of issue released! look forward to that!
    2. a list of 10-20 accounts ALL working and ALL for atlist a month of 
       sliding, in Internet-Zahav and Netvision!
       The file to look for will be : "accounts.00x", where x is the number of
       issue released. SOUNDS GOOD EH ?
Ok now lets got write to it - THE ART OF CARDING !
Groceries :
  * 1 of those phonebooks called Yellow Pages, either of you're own city or
    of the area
  * a born tellent to lie
  * a paper
  * a pencil

Way of getting it :
  * open the phonebook and choose a sucker-like-name
  * call there ( do a grown man's voice ) and say : "Can I speak with Mrs. Sucker, Please ? "
  * they'll usually say yes and then say you're from the bank and the order
    given to the bank of re-limiting the CC to 500/1000 N.I.S. a month!
  * the asnwer will be somtin like this : "AHAM what order i didnt give no
    order!" they'll be in shock! you say you have a form signed by Mrs. Sucker
    from date Sucker/Time/To-Get-Fucked! and they'll be even more shocked!
  * Now you say : "Im terebly sorry lemme check it please hold on for a second " 
    count to 30 and say : " by what i have here theres no mistake , but if you want,
    i can check it out for you... , just give me you're cc number ( be sure to 
    use the word credit card and not visa or isracard ) " , mostly those fouls
    will be so shocked they'll hand in to you the cc#. now tell them to wait a
    few more seconds. count to 30 again.
  * now say : "Mrs. sucker? " wait for they're replay and then go - " i need
    you're I.D. number to verify ", again because of the shock they'll hand
    in the id# also. now ask them to wait - same procedure. then say : " im
    sorry for the truble, we'll check it out and call right back to you, thank
    you, good-bye " dont forget to be polite like all bankers do! .
  * well thats about it folks! now you have you're cc# and info to do what you
    wish.

  - Having any truble or you need a a number real urgent leave me - Elmer Scud
    a msg at liquid underground bbs and i'll get back to ya as soon as possible
    okidokie?

   next issue - new methods and some froding you can do at the bank!
