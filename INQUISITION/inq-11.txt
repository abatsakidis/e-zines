      Welcome to Inquisition issue #11.
	      
      Welcome back to Inquisition.  Some have pondered and even said that we 
      were dead, well to your dismay, we're not dead.  This issue includes    
      several interviews and articles.  We are also sorry to inform you that
      we no longer carry Ionizer's Game Review.  This decision was justified
      by his ignorance of publishing that we were dead, and by the conclusion
      that he used us as a method to distribute his reviews.  Best of luck to
      Ionizer.

      Other things you will see missing from this issue is Jimmy Jamez Bias
      Util Report.  Jimmy had to concentrate on his studies, so look forward 
      next week for the Utils report.
      
      We still want YOU to write in comments on our publication, even if they 
      are negative.  We prolly will publish them in our next issue and one of 
      the editors or writers will reply to them.
	
      To state to the scene, we are a news publication here to bring you the
      latest in the scene, whether good or bad.  It's best to keep everyone
      informed, even the lamers.  
      
      We also offer a subscription now - look for info in the Internet Section
				
      Please welcome our new staff members in INQ!

Nice little write-up; but next time you might use god's name: Orion

Excellent magazine BTW.  Keep up the good work.  Anyway god will judge you :)

Mooncrow [PWA Member...  retired PWA Council Member and veteran old fart]


Raptor   - Whoa-ho!   Never thought  that  this  guy would   write   in.  Well
	   Mooncrow, I am sure   Jimmy will take   that into consideration and 
	   Orion will use that comment to bolster his inflamed ego.

Dudes!

I love the mag!  Keep it up.  Don't listen to the fucking lamerz who say you 
ain't doing a good thing.  I'll do all I can to help you out.  I remember back 
when INQ was the WWN.  I was on AOLame and we thought we were the shit when we 
got a copy of WWN.  I remember the IMaGe dudes and all those fools.  I heard 
IMaGe was dead.  That sucks.  Sorry to ramble on, just want you to keep up the 
good work.

Layterz!

Blackdeth on Undernet!

Raptor - Well Blackdeath, we appreciate the comment.  I am glad to hear that
	 our mag is fluent on the Undernet.  You guys keep reading on!


Hey guys, figured I'd follow official channels to submit a  letter this  time.
I'd like to submit a few  feelings about releases, and the dupe war.  Firstly,
let me state for the record, that releases are won on the boards.  As much  as
I hate to say that, that's  the facts.  The  way to win a release is to get it
to the others WHQ, or  a majority of  the boards.  Slowly and surely sites are
beginning to hold  the same importance  as boards, but that   will still  take
more time.  I've had many conversations and complaints on this  matter.  For a
group to  be able  to win then they must be  allowed access to the others WHQ.
In  cases like Hybrid and Park  Central, when  we  try   to upload on multiple
accts, all  our people  are  mysteriously knocked  offline.    I would think a
Major board like that would have solved    the odd  line noise problem  months
ago.  I was given a suggestion the  other day that maybe using an account of a
neutral person may help this line noise problem.  An odd fix, but one we  must
try.  And for that matter HBD  has yet to beat us on our boards.  They want to
insist that PC is  the end and where withall of  the race.  I have a hard time
believing that one  board  makes  the  scene.   One person does   not make the
scene.    As soon as you give one  person,  or  a small group that much power,
then the scene is too tightly  controlled.  I WILL  not  allow this to happen.
I will not have some  over-inflated windbag tell  me since it's not on PC that
we  lose.  Now if  others  want  to  try and rewrite how releases are sent and
won,  then they better  start to  address the  Net  as   a major factor.  I've
talked with many people from the  competition, and  they agree that the Net is
the future no matter how  much they hate to admit  it.  The  biggest complaint
is that there  is no  division  between lamers and elites.     There they  are
wrong.  Lets face it,  lamers can't access  the cool sites like  SCuMSite, LA,
or  RiSCSite.    Most netters  drool   over the  thought   of accessing  these
stockpiles.    That in  itself shows seperation.  Also the  lamers  don't have
OPS, in #Razor only  razor members  have   OPS so again seperation.  No matter
how hard the Old  Schoolers fight, I will drag them into this century and onto
the net.  Just don't make the mistake of underestimating someone like me.   ;)
And as a closing, I'd   like  to  state   that INQ has really blossemed into a
great mag.  No fancy artsy, fartsy loaders, just good  clean info.  Ask any of
my people on mass email list, they get a copy in email hot  off the   presses.
:)

		Keep up the great work, DruidKin - Razor Net Director

Raptor - Thank you Druidkin, and sorry for the lateness   of this  submission.
	 I figured that  this needed to be said, I went ahead a put  it  in 
	 the mag.  I am also glad to hear that we  have the support from Razor 
	 and  that your  mass email helps us even more.

Title      = Pinball 4000 (c) Expert 
Group      = Legacy 
Disks      = One
Article by = Minor Threat [DGt]

Pinball 4000   provides nothing new to the pinball genre.  But for  a  CD-Rip,
which  is only 1 disk, it is definitely worth  grabbing;   especially when you
don't  feel like playing  a long complex game.  Well Pinball 4000 is a pinball
simulator; there  are four themes of  pinbball machines.  Codename-X, a secret
agent type machine, sucks considering the backround really has no  relation to
the  name of the theme.  Second, Fender Bender  is  a western car shop setting
where  you   basically hit bumpers and other  little gadgets  that  do certain
things.  Tennis is probably  the most orginal  theme; bumpers are tennis balls
and, there  is a nice scene of a stadium  match in the backround.  And finally
Casino, this   has one  cool feature though   there are  little sub-games like
blackjack and   roulette.  The negatives of the game are that the  levels  are
way too simple, no real  design seemed to be taken on  the   levels.  I  would
have  liked to see multilevel pinball machines  with alot of  different things
to   interact with; all this game  provides are a  couple    bumpers and  some
hit-all-the-letters  and   get more points   stuff.   The  game does have nice
graphics  and   sound though, reminds me of a demo.  My   favorite  level  was
Fender Bender; I liked the  music.  I tested  the game on a  486DX/2  66, 12MB
RAM, SB16, and Win95 (DOS Mode).  The  game installed  easily,  and I found no
bugs.  The   setup is  easy,  the menu is real  easy and  the   game takes  no
screwing  around with.  I suggest  grabbing this 1 disk game   which is pretty
fun for a couple of hours.  The company who made it seems  to think there tilt
feature is revolutionary, but I  didn't even use it.  I give the game a  4 out
of 10.  Nothin new, nice music and graphics.

A. Technic [PWA]

Technic is one of the formiable crackers in the scene.  His cracking abilities
can be found in both PWA and DoD warez along with some individual cracks.  


INQ     : To begin with, many people do not even know who Technic is.  Can you 
	  give the readers a brief run-down of yourself?
Technic : I am main cracker of PWA (Pirates With Attitudes).  I also have 
	  cracked some stuff for DOD (Drink or Die) and other groups.
INQ     : How long have you been in PWA?
Technic : I am unsure.  Perhaps it has been only 6 months, but it seems like 
	  forever.
INQ     : So you were in PWA before the SCuM merge?
Technic : Yes, quite a bit before that.
INQ     : Was there anything before PWA?
Technic : There were many small, rinky-dink cracking operations, such as 
	  cracking requests for local boards.  This, of course, is only on the 
	  PC.  My cracking history goes way back to 1980 Apple ][ days.  :)
INQ     : Some say that you are the best cracker in the scene.  Not to be 
	  conceited, but do you think this true?
Technic : No, I believe there are several equally good crackers out there, as 
	  well as several who are better than myself.
INQ     : Have you ever ventured to crack games?
Technic : I have cracked many games on my own (not for groups); this is a 
	  side-effect of many groups releasing fuck-ups in the past.  
	  Basically, if I want to play something and it's not cracked, away I 
	  go at cracking it.
INQ     : So you can indeed crack games like the many utilities you have 
	  cracked?
Technic : Yes, certainly.  Games are generally easier to crack than 
	  applications.  CD checks, as long as one knows MSCDEX very well, are 
	  trivial in nature.  
INQ     : So why have you not decided to committ to a games group as a 
	  cracker?
Technic : It's because of the downward trend of games releases.  CD Rips are 
	  mostly shit (missing usually too much of the game and maybe not even 
	  working).  Plus, I've always been more interested in cracking and 
	  using applications.  Games get deleted once you win anyway.  It 
	  really makes one wonder about the eventual fate of groups like Razor 
	  and Hybrid; will they follow TDU-JAM?
INQ     : When did you start cracking for DoD?
Technic : I cracked a few things recently for DoD, maybe a few weeks ago.  
	  Cool applications like Soundforge 16, Soundforge 32, Speed Razor 
	  Mach III, and even a reg. key personalizer for SAW 5.1.
INQ     : Are there any problems with PWA concerning your cracking abilities 
	  with DoD.
Technic : No, I don't think so.  Because PWA and DoD are friendly rivals;
	  there seems to be no problem.
INQ     : How much are crackers worth these days?
Technic : Crackers are extremely valuable to groups these days.  A good 
	  cracker, coupled with good suppliers, makes for an excellent group.
	  Crackers are necessary to remove protection, remove serial #'s (or 
	  change them) to protect suppliers, et cetera.
INQ     : As a cracker, what is some of the hardest programs you came across 
	  to crack?
Technic : Without a doubt, the hardest stuff to crack has been (and I stress 
	  the words 'has been') the notorious Sentinel Super Pro Dongle.
	  Programs protected with such a dongle send strings to the hardware 
	  protection key, which are encrypted by the key, and returned to the 
	  program.
INQ     : What about Visual Basic programs?
Technic : Visual Basic programs are tricky because they really aren't 
	  "programs" per se, but merely interpreted scripts.  Misha, another 
	  famous cracker, will be working lots on this area.  While I 
	  concentrate on Dongle protection with another cracker friend, Slava.
INQ     : Going back to PWA, what are your thoughts on the retirement of 
	  Orion?
Technic : It's like it never happened, I'm happy to say, the reason it seems 
	  this way is that Orion never ruled with an iron glove.  Nowadays, 
	  Orion still hangs out frequently, and everyone gets along like 
	  equals as always.
INQ     : What are your thoughts are the merge of SCuM and PWA?
Technic : The merger was a necessary step to revitalize PWA.  Many of the 
	  members of both groups seemed burned out on the scene.  Some good, 
	  'new blood' in a group stimulates older members.
INQ     : How many groups that are ran by 16 year olds are successfull though?
Technic : Very few, as we see groups coming and going all the time.
INQ     : Indeed - Do you think it is best for a person to join a respected 
	  group before venturing on their own to form a new group?
Technic : It depends on what that person wants to do for a group.  If he wants 
	  to crack software, it makes no difference as long as he can crack 
	  stuff and show others his ability.  If he wants to courier stuff, 
	  chances are that the person will be unable to join a top group from 
	  the beginning so he has no choice.  And finally, being a senior 
	  doesn't mean shit if it's in a 5 person group.  In fact, being a 
	  senior shouldn't carry all the weight that it does.
INQ     : Really?  When you see Senior in a group, how much authority does 
	  that carry with you?
Technic : I wouldn't really know the answer to that question, because I'm not 
	  a senior.  From my point of view, seniors are like politicians, and 
	  the rest are filling various niches that need to be filled.
INQ     : Well Technic - you think we missed anything important?
Technic : Yes, several things - let me address them:
Technic : 1. Crackers need to be understood better and get more leeway from 
	     others.  People constantly ask, "How long it will take to crack" 
	     something.  This is unknown until we look at that thing.  Plus, 
	     if we are using our bandwidth to download stuff to crack for the 
	     scene and furthermore tying up our machine with a debugger.  We 
	     cannot do any leeching of files while cracking.  We are generally 
	     100% offline when debugging (there are exceptions, but mostly).
	     Therefore it seems logical that they be granted more leeway in 
	     leech access on sites.  ;)  
	  2. The dongle movement is EXTREMELY important to all of us with the 
	     new generation of protection upon us, we will all need to 
	     cooperate more with each other.  Several of the last cracks I did 
	     were shit.  The only reason they were shit was because I had no 
	     dongle to work with when cracking the programs.  These programs 
	     incude: all the Cubasis stuff, Speed Razor, 3DS Max pre-rel (both 
	     0.10 PWA and 0.19 DOD and 0.24 if I release it), and finally one 
	     that wasn't released due to dongle crap:  Real 3D v3.0 (and 
	     v3.3).  Obviously, these are all killer applications that many of 
	     us drool over.  Why don't they work?  As I said earlier, the 
	     top-of-the-line dongles contain an encryption engine, with 
	     individual cells in the dongle memory holding seed values (algo 
	     descriptors).  A program sends a string to a dongle and receives 
	     an encrypted string back, big deal?  Yes.  Suppose I send the 
	     dongle "1234" and it sends back some unknown?.  The program then 
	     jumps to whatever ???? equals.  Need that info in a bad way.
Technic : Anyway, to cut to the chase, Slava and I are working on a way to get 
	  the dongle's goodies to crackers without the dongle ever leaving the 
	  rightful owner's hands.
INQ     : To the layman - what exactly is the dongle?
Technic : A dongle is a hardware protection key that plugs onto your parallel 
	  port.  It contains 128 bytes of EEPROM memory and some sort of 
	  controlling logic.
INQ     : What do you think about the mag INQ?
Technic : I think it's great to read while taking a shit, calms the bowels.
	  Seriously, I believe that INQ is a cool idea and, you & the rest of 
	  the staff are doing a great job.  :)  The fact that INQ is present 
	  on so many people's netscape bookmark list speaks for itself.  As 
	  for the competition, hah!  I haven't seen any!  There's this guy 
	  named Reanimatr who has 170 bookmarks stored, all of the same site,
	  Inquisition.  Reanimatr is one of the fastest couriers I have ever 
	  seen, 2nd only to the great Hosis.
INQ     : It is a small rumor that PSX (Sony Playstation) will be soon 
	  available to everyone, how true is this?
Technic : The PSX, if someone is able to send me some development tools, I'll 
	  be able to look into being the first, PSX cracker out there.  
	  Otherwise, the future of PSX lies in duplicating the software EPROM 
	  of a Developer Model of Playstation.  In that way, the uncopyable 
	  lead-in area of the disc will make no difference.
INQ     : And for those who say they can duplicate PSX - What are the only 
	  way they can legitimately dupe PSX?
Technic : Much is known about Playstation protection.  If any readers have 
	  questions, they can do a Lycos Search and look up "CD2CD" for more 
	  information.
INQ     : Well Technic - I think that about does it, anything else?
Technic : Nah, that wraps it all up.

B. The Speed Racer [Razor 1911]

INQ : Do you think that now as Cyber Angel and Tyranny are retired the floppy
      scene is dead?
TSR : As far as the floppy scene goes it does look dead.
INQ : As for Hybrid?
TSR : Hybrid, I don't see releases from them in over 2 weeks, I know they owe 
      some suppliers, including Zeus money for his phone bill.  :)
INQ : Well we CAN NOT assume; it is not official is what you're saying, right
TSR : I havent seen anything from them in over 2-3 weeks let us assume they
      are.
INQ : So now as TDU is gone and so is Hybrid, do you and the Razor crew see 
      any more serious competition?
TSR : At this moment, we see no visible competition but who is to say what 
      lies in the future.  I am not really worried about other groups coming 
      out.
INQ : Yes, I have to admit myself I think Razor's member list grows day by
      day?  Any new patential suppliers?
TSR : We are always on the lookout for potential suppliers and people who can 
      contribute to the group in a positive way.
INQ : What do you think about some new groups like LEGACy, ENERGY, NAPALM, 
      et cetera?  Do you think there will be any competition?
TSR : Energy is a group that supplies sporadically mainly because they are
      only German; they have no contacts in the US or UK which is where most 
      games come from.
TSR : We have a diverse group of suppliers and talents managed along with
      great resources at our hands that makes us a force to be reckoned ith
INQ : There was a rumour that you were gonna quit the scene after 1995; you 
      did not what are your plans now?
TSR : OK, what I did do however is distribute a lot of my duties around to
      other members giving them some added chores which would help the group 
      out, so that nothing would be lost since I dont have the time to do so 
      much.
INQ : Now back to Hybrid, what do you think was the major reason they're
      dead?
TSR : Well they don't have to many "decent" suppliers and financially they are 
      BANKRUPT.  I heard that they were going to file a petition to Chapter 
      13; I'm still waiting on the final word on that subject; fortunately 
      under my guidance we have successfully maintaned a great budget, due to 
      creative financing at RAZOR Industries.  We find that we are in the 
      positive side financially with money saved.  :)
INQ : Yes, that's a very important aspect.  Well good luck to you and Razor in
      the future.  It's not that often we can find you on IRC anything you'd 
      like to add to our readers?
TSR : Yes, actually.
INQ : Please.
TSR : I would like to especially thank the fans who worldwide download our 
      games and play them, as we enjoy putting out these games for them.  :)
INQ : OK, I'm sure there are a lot of people who do play the games you put 
      out, and before I let you go, I have one more question.
INQ : A lot of readers are wondering, now as it's 1996 and things change who 
      is the REAL leader of RAZOR 1911?  As a leader I mean a person making 
      the most importanat decisions, now that EOS is gone who's left?  You 
      and...
TSR : Well we don't look at it as a single leader, because it is a group 
      effort, and we are a team where we draw from each other's stregnths and 
      patch each others weaknesses, but if you wanted to look at it that way it 
      would be Pharaoh, Third Son, The GEcko, and myself.  :)
INQ : OK, we wish you luck in 1996.  Thanks for your time!
TSR : Thank you very much :)  We enjoy getting every issue of yours since 
      Druidkin ALWAYS puts out your issue on email to all the RAZOR guys on 
      the net
INQ : And as always RAZOR 1911 is on the top of the scene.  This was an
      interview taken on the IRC with The Speed Racer.  We all wish him good
      luck and health in 1996 and I guess we'll finish it right here.  Thanks 
      for you time.
TSR : My pleasure.

C. Ordnance [RtS]

On Saturday January 20th I conducted a short 2 hour interview with Ordnance,
the Request to Send Senior (leader).  Ordnance is a great guy who contributed
greatly to the scene over the period of the last five years.  During out last
interview we felt that we circled on the RTS breakup and dispute, in turn we
decided to do an interview with Ordnance strictly concerning RTS.  Enjoy.
						     - Lurch (apd@openix.com)

INQ      : To start off, i'd just like to ask you how RTS is doing right now.
Ordnance : Certainly.
Ordnance : We are currently stronger on the boards than we have been in a long
	   time.  Amazingly enough, we are accomplishing this through the 
	   dedication of our board traders rather than a board coordinator.  
	   We have not yet found someone suitable enough to handle RTS' board
	   presence full-time.  On the European front, however, Blacksmith is 
	   our coordinator and things are well taken care of.
	   As far as boards, we have received a number of applications, but 
	   have not been pursuing any of the Big-10 boards just yet.  The 
	   strength of our board team is steadily increasing, and I hope soon 
	   to earn some of the major board on that merit.
Ordnance : As far as our Internet presence goes, the main sites are being 
	   handled very well by Eclipse and the dedication of our site 
	   operators and affiliates.  People should expect to see much more of
	   RTS on the Net lately -- we have the stability and resources to 
	   start spreading outwards.
Ordnance : On the down side, Alice is on a leave of abscence and until his 
	   return or replacement, the European site team is on hold.
	   The kind of turmoil now in the scene makes me feel it is not the 
	   best time to approach some groups.  We may soon resume discussions 
	   with ROR, but otherwise our relationship with them is 
	   excellent -- many of their members have joined and are contributing 
	   to RTS.  As far as PWA/RZR/CORP, we are in extremely good relation.
	   And there is no reason not to extend that kind of relationship to 
	   DOD/etc, which I consciously intend to do.
INQ      : When you say that your board presence is currently one of the 
	   strongest it's ever been for RTS, do you mean RTS Affiliated boards
	   or just the general presence of RTS tagged files on boards 
	   throughout the world?
Ordnance : I would not say the strongest it has *ever* been.  Rather, the 
	   strongest it has been in quite a while.  We are having our share of 
	   achievements, but there is much more to be desired.
Ordnance : By our board presence, I mean the major boards.  The RTS board list
	   has not grown much.  Boards have been applying, but once
	   again -- the top boards are in a stable state and nothing we are 
	   pursuing right now.  That may soon change.
Ordnance : Things are improving very much in the group lately, both in
	   performance and morale.  As long as we keep improving, I have no 
	   qualms about the size of our board list.  Our presence is many 
	   times larger.
INQ      : When looking over RTS top charts, who would you say are currently
	   RTS's most notable couriers?
Ordnance : I recognize those who consitently stand above the rest with Senior
	   Courier status.  All those in our 01-01 have retained that 
	   position, with the addition of Tiger Claw, who has already caught 
	   the attention of our competitors on PC.
Ordnance : It is inevitable that these people get offers from other groups.  
	   I have no problem with this tactic, am kept informed when it 
	   happens and what was discussed.  I am very proud to say that none 
	   of our top traders have even considered leaving.
Ordnance : With our current success and constant improvement, not to mention 
	   the attention and recognition we try to give each other, there is 
	   a true sense of brotherhood.  And after all, it's this kind of 
	   group dedication which keeps the scene fun.
INQ      : Now I'd just like to ask you a few general questions about RTS and 
	   the way you run it.
INQ      : How do you keep in touch with RTS couriers,and do you know/evaluate
	   each and every one personally?
Ordnance : We have our irc channel, of course.  I am very accessible through 
	   bot notes, try to keep the irc process open to receive messages.  
	   Often I am too busy to chase down complete strangers, but I will 
	   always make the time for any member.
Ordnance : Once in a blue moon, and at request, I will make a series of calls 
	   to some of the couriers.  I feel that the down-to-earth nature of 
	   a real human conversation can be the best reinforcer, or motivator.
Ordnance : Of course, with a group this size, it is very important that the 
	   members make an effort to keep me informed.  I deal with so many 
	   things in one day, and even at one time, that I cannot be aware of 
	   everything and go after people.
Ordnance : As far as evaluating the couriers, they usually have either the 
	   sysop of a board or other RTS member to vouch for their performance,
	   or lack thereof.  If I see a member, I will ask how they are in 
	   general, and how they are doing on the board.
Ordnance : I understand that not every response is going to be positive, the
	   real world rightfully demands precedence over the scene.  If they 
	   have the time but not the will, then I can only do my best to 
	   motivate them and try and discover where I and RTS have failed to 
	   keep them motivated.
Ordnance : If the response is positive, and I'm glad that most are, the guys 
	   make it very well known.  Without a dedicated BBS Coordinator, we
	   do not have the luxury of critically looking at everyone's 
	   statistics.  Then again, we are prospering without one -- and even
	   so, would be responding the same way to the couriers whether we had
	   the numbers in front of us or not.  There is of course some 
	   checking where it is critical.
INQ      : In general what do you consider a disfunctional courier?  Or rather,
	   what are the minimum requirment of RTS in terms of meggage or 
	   uploads per a given ammount of time?
Ordnance : A disfunctional courier is someone who cannot maintain a lot of
	   effort over a decent period of time.  Most everyone experiences 
	   brownouts, or find other priorities, but this is quite acceptable.
	   If I have actually seen someone live up to their potential, but 
	   then have to take time off or all but retire, RTS will still 
	   accomodate them for a resonable amount of time.  This varies on the
	   person and situation.
Ordnance : Those who do finally slip through the cracks, for whatever reasons,
	   including inability to perform, are welcome to remain on the social
	   side of RTS.  This usually does not come with benefits, but we all
	   enjoy the company.  RTS tries to be a very friendly place.  The
	   standards are strict and high, but there is more to a group than
	   knocking files here and there.
Ordnance : As far as minimum requirements, RTS has none.  All applications are
	   considered on a case-by-case basis.  It would be foolish to
	   approximate the ups and downs of a trader with a straight-line 
	   minimum.
INQ      : To elaborate further on the current status of RTS's board
	   couriering, exactly what places does RTS hold in specific regions
	   of the world?  (i.e. Europe, Asia, Australia, and the US)
Ordnance : Some of our best traders are in Europe, notwithstanding the
	   excellent way Blacksmith handles things.  Australia is much
	   overlooked by everyone, and deserves more, but we have presence 
	   there.  On that note, I'd like to send a personal apology to Inf.:}
	   As far as Asia, we have not at all come into contact or explored
	   that scene.  We do not have an interest in foreign releases, but I
	   very much encourage the Asian scene to come forward and involve 
	   themselves.  RTS will certainly do all we can when presented with
	   that opportunity.
Ordnance : Uncle Sam seems satisfied with our performance on the home
	   continent.  There's not much to elaborate on about the US, since 
	   it is almost always the perspective of my replies.
Ordnance : I would like to see more activity in Canada.  We have not had a 
	   suitable presence in Canada for quite awhile and appreciate those 
	   Canadian members we have.  Consider us interested in others.
Ordnance : As far as what we "hold" in these various regions of the world, I
	   will not comment.  I have knowledge of everything in RTS.  Until
	   other people from all sorts of different vantage points come
	   forward and uphold that, there is no reason to try and define the
	   breadth of our success.
INQ      : RTS has been a dominating force in the scene for many years.
	   Through all of these you had been the leader, so I would venture
	   to say that you had been on top of things for the past few years.
	   What is your comment on the current direction taken by both Util 
	   and Game warez scenes, and more importantly your feelings about 
	   CD-RIPS from a courier's point of view?
Ordnance : In RTS' second season I made a serious promise to not burn out, and
	   re-iterate that promise regularly.  I haven't been through enough
	   catastrophe to change my relationship with RTS.  It's a matter of
	   maintaining my integrity through the thick and thin of the scene
	   and life.  By overcoming the pressures of RTS combined with the
	   real world, I have only become a stronger person.  I believe every
	   ounce of time I put into RTS gives a return.  I could care less
	   about the non-profit nature of things.  I am being education at the
	   highest level through RTS, and all that's required is commitment.
Ordnance : I don't feel like commenting on the performance of Util and Games
	   groups, even in general.  Releasing groups focus on the
	   time-specific events of a release, as opposed to the clockwork
	   machinery of a couriering group.
Ordnance : They certainly do not garner the respect and support they deserve,
	   and this both disappoints and upsets me.  Everyone should take some
	   time to reflect on the amount of time and effort groups put into
	   handing them a finished product on a silver platter.  Whether you
	   enjoy the release or not, whether or not there was a mistake
	   somewhere along the line, all of us in the couriering and releasing
	   groups put in ceaseless time and effort.
Ordnance : As far as the notion of CD-Rips, they are certainly a problem, but
	   they are also a necessity.  Unless they split the load of a cd-rip,
	   couriers are very hard-pressed to handle an entire CD-Rip on their
	   own.  After all, no one wants to be associated with an incomplete
	   upload.  And with the large size of releases, these same board
	   traders are finding that instead of themselves and their group
	   competiting to get a hold of many small releases from here and
	   there, they must be the first to those few large rips.  So one
	   could say that, for a board courier, the stakes are exponential.
Ordnance : Conversely, trading over the iNet is exponentially *easier*.  But
	   the accessibility makes it that much more competitive.  Not to
	   mention the fact that, just like RTS, many other people are on
	   absolute private or near-private systems.
Ordnance : A lot of Net trading is a matter of convenience.  Getting to the
	   right people at the right places.  And not all the right places
	   will roll out the red carpet.  RTS is going to bring its own
	   carpet whenever possible.
Ordnance : As far as those who actually Rip the CDs, I appreciate their time.
	   The best of rippers know how to extract that wonderful 20mb
	   animation that we don't care to see more than once.  I encourage
	   them to be minimalists and try to preserve the functionality or
	   playability of a CD, rather than the glitz and burden of trading
	   and using one.
INQ      : At this point I'd like to thank you for your time.  It's been a
	   pleasure talking to you, and we are all looking forward to seeing
	   even more RTS tags in the near future.  I'd like to also personally
	   wish good luck to the entire RTS crew.
Ordnance : Thank you for the sentiment.
Ordnance : I've very much enjoyed being interviewed and appreciate the time
	   you spend to bring INQ to all of us.


D. Blitzkrieg-X [TDU-Jam]

Out of all TDU-Jam's members, the only person I could find around was 
Blitzkrieg-X.  A lot of you probabaly know him from being in RAZOR 1911 
floppy.  Since I was very interested of what had happened with TDU, this 
interview was very valuable for me.

INQ   : There were rumors that TDU-Jam is making a great comeback.  Is that 
	true?
Blitz : Well, I spoke with Fanfan La Tulipe before the holidays.  He said that 
	there was some stuff he had to take care of in school, after that he 
	was planning to make a comeback after vacations.
INQ   : Hmm, go on.
Blitz : Well when I spoke to him again about 2 weeks later he confirmed that 
	yes, TDU-Jam might come back in the scene, but The Digital Underground 
	will not be it World HQ anymore, as the board is officially retired 
	now.
INQ   : In last NFO's there were a lot of changes in TDU's NFO file, what's 
	the story with its membership?
Blitz : Well none of big suppliers went to any other groups, so basically 
	it's gonna be the same membership listing with the leaders Fanfan La 
	Tulipe and Wayward.
INQ   : Well thanks for the information.  Since we are already here lemme ask 
	you why EOS and you had quit RAZOR 1911 for TDU-Jam.  And will EOS 
	come back in TDU if it will make a comeback.
Blitz : Well we went to TDU-Jam, as in cd game group we never actually quit 
	Razor 1911 until floppy and CD sections merged in one RAZOR 1911 
	again, and we have chosen to stay in TDU-Jam.  As for EOS, he will not 
	come back on the scene at least for a while, because he have moved to 
	a different state.
INQ   : OK.  Good luck to you guys.
Blitz : Thanks, same to you.

		Autonomy & Austhetics for the Internet Scene

Hey, guess what?   It's Darwin with a few words  on a  subject that's close to
the hearts of  many of  you  scenemonkeys out  there :  "The Internet And it's
Effect  on the Scene." Consider   this a brief elaboration  on that section in
the Christmas Inquisition.  This segment will  focus on a very  specific topic
-  what can  be done    to   make FTP   sites and  the net  more entertaining,
competetive and  generally fun for everyone  involved.  I think that there are
specific steps that need to be taken, and I'll briefly discuss them here. 

First, the interface that files  are traded through needs to change.  This was
started with the re-writing of  unix ftpds, essentially hacking them to pieces
in  an attempt  to institute ratios and STATS.  This  is a  step  in the right
direction,  because it  shows that this scene  is about   more than just   the
software that is  released.  People  care about groups, because the STATS that
show  up in the Top Uploader's list are often  a direct result of the strength
of the release groups a given courier trades  for.  For example, a PWA courier
will  have a  ready supply of releases on a  daily basis, allowing them to get
files  to  sites  first.  The  Weektop  and Who's online recently pioneered by
some  excellent coders  is also a   great thing for the  net scene.   It makes
people feel like they are  directly competing with their fellows in the scene,
minute by minute, hour by    hour.   We've seen  how effective  this is on the
board scene, it's simply insane not to do it on the net. 

Continuing the interface, I think  that the aesthetics of the sites needs some
improvement.  On most sites, you    upload and the  only feedback you get is a
change in your stats and a warning if the files are  corrupt.  That's not much
feedback, and it's not especially   easy on the  eyes.  On the board scene, we
have ANSi's, color menus, MODS,  et cetera.  Maybe it's  because PPL is fairly
simple to program, but I  would suggest it's because there is a *standard*.  I
know it took  quite a while to establish a standard for  BBS's, but PCBoard is
the   clearly  superior choice.  Now,  the challenge, as it  was for those who
hacked LSD in  twenty-nine-thousand different  ways, is to make a product that
the  scene  will want to use and has many  features and is   easy  to  use.  I
believe a lesson  should be    taken  from PCB,   and make  a standard  way of
databasing STATS  and filenames (even file listings since last login?).  If we
have  a standard way of handling data,   then  we can have a modding  scene as
prolific as PCBs, and the best design will succeed and be  useful to the scene
in the same  way.  This requires a choice and  would only really be useful for
those using ncftp or ftp, but those can be hacked by skillful coders as well.

Second, I believe  that the scene needs to be more selective  in the amount of
people given access to a given echelon of sites.   The BBS scene had a barrier
to  entry -  the difficulty of calling long distance  and the  balls to do it.
The net  scene has *no*  barriers to entry, basically, anyone and their sister
can do this, and do    passably.  However, when   you have a pie being divided
fifty  ways, each  individual trader gets  less  satisfaction.  For   example,
group  leaders  functioning as traders,  uploading to  sites?  What  the hell?
This makes no sense!  A  release should go  to  the  group   HQs, and  then be
spread from there by couriers!  It just makes sense!  If you take trading  out
of  the  hands of couriers,   see how many motivated  couriers you have.  It's
okay  if it's  the supplier, it's  his software and his  right, but  leave the
couriering to the couriers, guys. 

Lastly,  I   think  that the  proliferation  of Courier  groups is  just plain
ridiculous.  There  are people running groups   who  have done nothing more in
the scene than hang out  on #warez5 and #siteZ-ph0r-Lamers and think that they
can compete?  This isn't about a no-quota account, guys.   It's about a scene,
about networking people in release  groups and the bbs  scene, not just taking
applications  and   calling yourself a leader.   If you've  never worked  in a
support  role,  you shouldn't even  be considering  a leadership  role.  Think
about it, does a company hire a CEO that's never worked as a  manager?  I know
you people think you're all  pioneers and that you  can  pull  a Bill Gates on
the scene, but  it's not    going  to happen.    You have  to spend time doing
something,  learning  the ropes, before you jump into it.  Consider yourselves
amateur boxers - jump into the  ring without training, and you're going to get
beat to a pulp.

Anyway, it's Darwin  rapping to you all in there in the  scene.  You can reach
me on irc if you want,  you can find me in #INQ or wherever, mail INQ and I'll
get  it, et  cetera.  I've gotten some feedback from  you all  out there on my
musings, and I  really appreciate  it.   This is the stuff  that I think about
whilst trading, and I'd appreciate any interesting ideas you all have. 

	Peace and fast trading to you all.

			     Ware Maker Information

I'm back!  I know you all care.  Well, I wrote one article in  INQ before, and
I'm back for MANY more!  So RCN can  step  aside and all you other lame  emags
too.  None of you compare to INQ.  Now that is out of my  system, I bring some
of you  disturbing news, and to others of you, this is what  you already knew.
INQ brings you the story of Ware Maker aka Charles ____.

Yes, the one who  used to call you and bother you  for hours on  his MCIs.  It
wouldn't have been a big surprise if he  DID  get busted, but the sad truth is
that he  quit the scene  shamefully.  Some say  he quit   to  play Magic,  and
others  say he quit  because of grades.  Well, according  to  Charles himself,
the pressures of real life just got to him.   When asked why he  would lie  to
everyone, he replied that  he didn't   want everyone  to  call and bother him.
Sounds funny coming from the boy who defines the word  "bother." Well, when he
found out that all the boards he was  on   deleted him, he came  forward to  a
small group of people, and admitted that he had never been busted.

The Warp Zone deleted his access after learning  that he had been busted,  and
hearing that he was turning in numbers.  Rumor has it that he is aching to  be
back on right  now.  All I can say is that it  was his fault for lying to  the
scene.  Well, Charles is  feeling pretty sad without his console games and his
warez, so if you want to get in  touch  with him, mail  ____@netcom.com or you
could always  call him, but I'm not mean  enough  to put that  info here.  You
could always weasel it out of me on IRC though.

Anyways, Charles  told me he will buy his  software  now that he  can't get on
TWZ.  He also told me this TOP SECRET info : he is coming  back this summer to
the scene!  Shhhh, don't tell  anyone!  I asked  him why he thought the  scene
would accept him back, and he kept babbling  about whether or not he would use
the handle Ware Maker. 

Oh well, he was  supposed to call me.  I'm so sad  he didn't, but  I bet after
he reads this, he calls me.  ;) --CyberPhreak


Editor's Note: This  article  was edited  to keep  Ware  Maker's last name and
email address secret since this information is not important to the reader.

			     Scene News

As for current news, BIG  upsets in  both  utilities  and games.  We don't see
any games at  all, but we certainly  see a lot of  utilities,  and like 25% of
them are more than 45 disks!   Yes,  and they have been released by big groups
too  such as PWA, DoD  and REBELS.    The only games we have  seen   came from
Legacy and Razor.  Razor didn't show us anything REALLY good yet, as  for  LGC
they  do release,  but mostly  either budget   small games  or  huge  cd rips.
Another    yet game group entered  the scene, Arcade;  let's   see what   will
happened  to them.  Also NaPaLM is entering the game competition; it's lead by
Prophet and DaViolator.

Couriering groups are entering the  scene as  well some new  names are Master,
Blitzkrieg    and MiRACLE couriers.   Let's see what they can  do.   fATE   is
definitely  doing a great job  giving RiSC   competition.  You can  add  to it
MaLiCe as well.  Unfotuanetly those guys do  not have much to spread yet  this
year.

In the conclusion, let's hope that it's just  January,  which never had been a
great  month for the scene,  hopefully we'll see something  good  next  month.
Good luck.

			   You Might Be A Lamer If..

	I'm sure you all have your definitions of what a lamer is.

But, I felt I would tell you why you MIGHT be a lamer.        
Webster's defines lame as: 1. crippled. 
			   2. stiff and painful. 
			   3. poor and inefectual.  

But, in Lester's Dictionary you might be a lamer if:
 
You might be a lamer if you think DOOM 2 is a new ware.
You might be a lamer if you start 4 groups in the span of 6 months.
You might be a lamer if someone in #warez950 tells you they are Roland of
The Wall, and you believe him.
You might be a lamer if you run a courier/release/cracking/coding/ppe group.
You might be a lamer if you run a 1 node 14.4 board.
You might be a lamer if you run a 10 node PD front warez board.
You might be a lamer if you had to change your handle to make yourself look
cool.
You might be a lamer if you think FATE is the best couriering group.
You might be a lamer if you hang out in #fatefiles.
You might be a lamer if you are an AOL Pirate out for equal warez.
You might be a lamer if you pay for a netcom account.
You might be a lamer if you have a shareware releasing group.
You might be a lamer if you have been interviewed in RCN.
and the final reason you might be a lamer is!
If you think RCN is a good magazine!

And in closing, I'd like to define to you what Reality Check Network means
in Webster's opinion.

- Reality: The quality or fact of being real.     
- Check: a sudden stop.
- Network: Radio, TV, a chain of transmitting stations. 

Now, in my dictionary Reality Check Network means:
A bunch of people who jumped on the bandwagon of warez mags, but are complete
and total lamers(see above to find out for sure), and provide no real service
or information that is important to the scene. The  things they print are
meaningless and have no real story to them. So!

- Reality: a lamers view of the scene.
- Check: a sudden stop.
- Network: a chain of lamers transmitting worthless information.

			      Personal Opinion

In my   personal opinion, RCN is   an all around decent  magazine.  IF you are
just getting into the scene and want a scoop  on what is going on.  But if you
frequent  any decent channels on IRC and actually talk with  the people   that
are sometimes written about  and/or mentioned in  RCN  you  will  quickly wade
through the   line of shit that   is written in this  magazine and notice that
what the authors are writing about is just simply for the masses.

That is just a  brief summary of what the magazine consists of.  My only  real
complaint about the magazine is their lack or   unwillingness to actually take
forth and  contact such groups as DoD, PWA, MAliCE, Razor  1911, et cetera and
get the latest  in NFO's.  I have went  from being   in  DTC  to moving on and
joining MAliCE and  DoD, which took place close to 3 weeks ago.  I  have since
then been taken out of the latest DTC NFO and have been  put in the latest DoD
NFO and MAliCE NFO,  which  I  have  yet to see appear  in RCN.  I  personally
believe if RCN   is trying to gain respect on the scene,  and  write/interview
certain  people, I think  they  should first look  at  what  they are offering
(group NFO's,  Warez  lists, credits,  et  cetera) before they  try and   fuck
anyone over or write about meaningless bullshit...

			     Hybrid and TDU-Jam

Another issue is Hybrid and  TDU-Jam.  There was a lot  of rumors about  TDU's
come back.  Well am I missing something big or it was just another   rumor.  I
believe it was.  Now we have to make a conclusion that  TDU-Jam after  doing a
great job on CD games is finally gone. 

But, the big question is....is  Hybrid gone too?  Well  read  the RCN issue  9
and see  how  unprofessionally  Rebel Chicken writes about the Hybrid leaders.
If he wants to  make a joke of them, I  do not think he can.  After all Legacy
is not that good to be  proud  of, although I have to  admit that quantity  of
releases is high, but later about it.

Back to RCN, when RC tries to say that Hybrid's leaders are on welfare and  if
they will not eat a lot they will be back by the  middle of February.  Common!
What kind of   statement is that?  I  personally think   that  Hybrid was  the
cleanest group    EVER!  Which tried to   be  CLEAN in competition,  avoid any
fights, and they did!  They  were also definitely on   the  very top of  games
last year.   My opinion  and prediction is  that most likely  Hybrid will  not
come back as HYBRID anymore.   We can expect suprises,   but  I  do not  think
there is  a  chance.     There could be   another new group  coming that would
contain  crackers and/or suppliers from  Hybrid (whoever   wished to stay) and
there are  some more people  as far as  I   know   from  TDU  that  are  still
"unemployed."

							      - Judge DRedd -

P.S.  January  17th, Hybrid  had released their first game   supplied  by ZEUS
      which  was   called Space Dude.  It also contained a message in  NFO 
      that over the vacation, Celestical  Wizard and BlueWater were married.  
      I am not sure if it was a fake release or  not,  simply because I didn't 
      get  a chance to check it.  Sorry!

The contest definetly proved that when push came to shove, malice was going to 
rise to its potential.  Being a member of MAliCE, I'd like to give all those 
couriers a big pat on the back for kicking ass.

But this is old news, the big news is the alleged fATE vs MAliCE upload 
contest.  This is not a total rumor; as I was in the channel where they were 
(Leodlion, G0D, Dorian, and a few others) planning an actual upload contest, 
to prove once and for all who was the best.  In this channel, tempers were 
flying as the groups tossed insults at one another.  If the contest was have 
to actually taken place, it was to have be set for now.  I do not know if the 
contest is going on, but I do know for a fact that all the couriers in MAliCE 
were ready.  Also Sys-Ops of specified boards WERE offering accounts to the 
fATE members to upload for the week.  Personally, I think two of the best 
spreading groups out there, going after each others throats to prove who is 
better is very childish.

You also have to consider the price the loser of this contest would pay, total 
humilation in the scene is probably the biggest thing.  Wheter the contest was 
held or not is still uknown to me, but if anyone has any knowledge or 
comments, I would be very interested and would appreciate you to MSG me on the
IRC.

			AP Press Release - Blackhawk

Many of you probably have read this or at least seen it.  Bascially, we 
getting a copy of this out to everyone to read and make your own judgement of
what the press has to say about this incident.


By TIM KLASS - Associated Press Writer

SEATTLE (AP) -- After  three years of building what he billed  as the nation's
biggest electronic pirate bulletin board service, Scott W.  Morris was bored.

The  25-year-old decided he would soon    quit  offering access to hundreds of
pirated   software   products through his    Assassins'  Guild Bulletin  Board
Service,   and instead use his 13  computers, 11 modems and satellite  dish to
start an Internet provider service.

Morris  didn't  move fast enough.  In    April,  his Lexington,  Ky., home was
raided  by  U.S.  marshals who  seized all his gear under a  lawsuit  filed by
Microsoft Corp.  and Novell Inc.

And under a settlement announced last week, Morris agreed  to  pay  $70,300 in
cash and forfeit the  computer hardware, valued at more than $40,000.  He will
also  work  as an unpaid   consultant  for the companies,   assisting in other
similar investigations.

Microsoft and Novell are touting the settlement as the largest ever,  and many
industry  analysts consider it groundbreaking in  an  area where there are few
rules and regulations.

"This case sets an important precedent   for  this industry," said Bob Kruger,
enforcement director  for  the Business Software Alliance.  "It  sends a clear
message  to  operators  of  bulletin  boards who are  illegally   distributing
copyright-protected  software that  they   will be  investigated and  sued  or
criminally prosecuted."

About   35  percent of business software    in  the United  States is pirated,
resulting in  more than $2.8    billion in losses annually,  according  to the
software alliance.

Computer bulletin boards range from simple forums for information  and opinion
to highly sophisticated and complex exchanges for software programs.

On pirate BBSs like the Assassins' Guild, linked with a  loosely  formed group
of traders called Pirates with an  Attitude, traders upload software they have
acquired and  download   programs  that  have  been uploaded   by others.  The
traders, in turn, operate similarly with individual users.

Through Morris'  operation,   interested  parties had access  to hundreds   of
programs   from   dozens of manufacturers,   including  Microsoft Windows  for
Workgroups, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Bob and Novell Netware.

Morris had amassed 9  gigabytes of on-line data and more than  40 gigabytes of
off-line data storage.  He  said he had 300 "very  active users," accepted new
ones only on reference from  those already with  him  and purged  all who went
more than a month without logging on.

"I did  not cater  to  the   individual user," Morris    said  in  a telephone
interview.  He  continues to work  as a computer    systems  manager     for a
Lexington telephone installation company.

Jim Lowe,  a   Microsoft   lawyer,  says  all  the   material  downloaded from
Assassins' Guild amounted to more than $1 million in off-the-shelf prices.

"This is the  biggest  one we've ever done, and I believe  this is bigger than
any one that law enforcement has shut down (in  a criminal case)," Lowe  said.
"If you  believe his own  ad, he was sort  of the king of the hill of computer
(BBS) piracy."

But Morris contends that his operation will be quickly replaced by others.

"Taking my board down  had absolutely no impact  at  all  on  the quantity  of
material moved," he said.

Morris also claims that  the pirate scene is a  "valuable  marketing  tool for
software manufacturers."

"You have a much  more mature  audience ...  who  would  download  material to
test it out,"  he said.   "If the product really  was good, they'd  go out and
buy it."

But many manufacturers see  no positive aspect of piracy,  instead considering
it a major threat to their businesses.

Lowe said pirate bulletin  boards pose  a much larger  threat  in  the future,
partly   as  a    source  of  software  for  counterfeiters   who  are relying
increasingly on CD-ROM.

Last fall,  for  example,  a  San Jose  (Calif.)  Mercury-News  reporter found
programs  worth  $700   in  U.S.  retail  prices  on  illegally made composite
CD-ROMs selling for about $4 each in Beijing.

Programs downloaded  from  the  Assassins' Guild were  used in   European-made
composite CD-ROMs, Lowe said.

Morris said one way  to cut piracy losses  is  to  make   software that  stops
functioning  within  a set period    of time, like   the  popular   Wide World
Web-surfing  programs distributed over the Internet by Netscape Communications
Corp.

"They have that capacity,"  he said.  "There's been a  lot  of  moving towards
that."

		      Microsoft Press Release - Blackhawk

Once again, those who have read this carry on.  This is Microsoft's Press 
Release of their so-called victory.  Such a big birthday gift for them, they
put the article on the Web Site - big ego boost for Billy.


REDMOND,  Wash.,  Jan.  12 -- Microsoft Corporation and Novell,  Inc.  jointly
announced today they have reached a settlement with Scott W.  Morris,  who was
doing business as  the  Assassins' Guild Bulletin Board Service (BBS), in what
is believed  to be the largest settlement ever with the  systems operator of a
pirate   electronic   BBS.  The    settlement  concludes litigation  filed  by
Microsoft and Novell in the U.S.   District Court for the Eastern  District of
Kentucky.  Under  the  agreement,   Mr.  Morris will  pay $70,300  in cash and
forfeit computer hardware  valued  at more  than  $40,000.    Mr. Morris  also
agrees to assist Microsoft and Novell in their continuing BBS investigations.

The  Assassin's  Guild billed itself  as  the worldwide headquarters  for  two
large pirate groups,  Pirates  with an  Attitude (PWA)  and  Razor  1911. U.S.
Marshals raided Mr.  Morris' residence last April  on the basis of plaintiffs'
claims  of illegal reproduction     and  distribution  of  copyright-protected
software.  The BBS had  been offering access to  hundreds  of pirated software
products, including    those   published by    Microsoft  and Novell, to users
throughout the U.S.  and  around the world  over  its state-of-the-art system.
Marshals  seized   13 computers, 11 modems, a satellite dish,  9 gigabytes  of
online data   and  over 40 gigabytes of off-line data  storage dating  back to
1992.

"This case  sets an  important precedent for  this industry," said Bob Kruger,
Director of Enforcement for the  Business  Software Alliance (BSA).  "It sends
a  clear  message  to  operators  of   bulletin  boards   who  are   illegally
distributing copyright-protected  software  that they will be investigated and
sued,  or  criminally prosecuted.    It also sends a message  to our  industry
that,  large or small, no software publisher is immune   from  bulletin  board
piracy."

"Online  piracy  is a growing  concern   for software  publishers  around  the
world," said Jim  Lowe,  Microsoft Corporate Attorney.   "We  are committed to
working with   industry representatives and  law  enforcement agencies to stop
this trend.  Pirates such as the   Assassins' Guild are stealing  intellectual
property that represent years of development time and investment on  the parts
of publishers large and small."

Both Novell and Microsoft are members of the BSA, an industry alliance  formed
to  promote the  growth of  the   software industry   through  public  policy,
education and    enforcement initiatives.   In  1994, the BSA estimates   that
software publishers  lost over  $15.2 billion as  a result of software piracy.
In the United States alone, the BSA estimates that 35  percent of the business
software in use is pirated, resulting in losses of more than $2.8 billion.

			     RoR Verification

Well another thing that I'd like to point out is the conflict and the scandal 
in RoR.  For those of you who don't what's going on nor have read RCN,  I just 
want to refresh your memory.  Gahn and Incarnate were planning on kicking tKLP 
out of RoR and run the group by themselves.  RCN brings some facts that are 
very interesting, in the same time doubt.  I really doubt that they could 
really get MSG's between Incarnate and Gahn for a 3 day period, and I'm very 
sure that neither of them (In. or Gn.) would give it to the public to view. 
Basically here is my side of the story and opinion.
    
I didn't know anything about it until I read RCN's issue, but since I did, I 
did alittle of investigation work.  I also know Gahn, Incarnate and tKLP, and 
here is my opinion.  I personally never liked iNCARNATE, and although I don't 
know him well enough, I really have no respect for him.  Gahn on the other hand
has my respect and sympathy, and I also know for fact that he did cover tKLP 
a lot as he tried to save RoR's reputation.  In the same time tKLP was not 
really that careful and had a lot of people dislike him for that.  But, when 
it to a decision, all of RoR's best people stayed loyal and didn't want to be 
in a group without tKLP, and I think he deserves respect for it.  Finally RCN 
was very careless on some info and got people confused as Hitex's article 
clearly states that Gahn stayed with RoR, but iNCARNATE was thrown out; the 
NFO of RoR states the same, but RoR's NFO which was in all latest releases 
doesn't have neither Gahn nor Incarnate.  Therefore, I decided to call tKLP 
and ask him what happened.  When I called him he was on the phone with 
Incarnate!  Yep!  So next issue expect FULL story from RoR, plus an interview 
with Cyber Angel, which will be definitely a #1 topic.  Read INQUiSiTiON 
every sunday!

are cool also.

Adventure, point & click game.  Good graphics, along with aood story which 
make an average game worth playing.  Reminds me of a shrunken down monkey

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Game            : William Arcade Classics
Group           : Hybrid
Number of Disks : Two

Well, not too much too say - old games that are identical to the older
versions of the arcade games.  If the graphics were improved like Tempest
2000 it would rule, but it's just too little, too late.  At least in my 
opinion.  Old arcade goers will love it.
70/100
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Game            : 2 Fast 4 You
Group           : ?

Game            : Thunder Hawk 2
Group           : Razor 1911
Number of Disks : Fourteen

If you like the helicopter point and shoot simulator type of the game, you 
should enjoy this one.  Not like other simulators, this one doesn't take a 
year  and a half to start the game.  Sequal to PSX game of the same name.
80/100
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Game            : Williams Fun & Games Deluxe

Well, as we KNOW the most Anticipated game EVER is going come out and i hope
to God that the group who grabs it will rip it and have it work! (Razor

Magic: The Gathering.

---=[ 8. Warez Listing ]=-----------------------------------------------------

Well, hey folks.  Another edition of the warez list is here.  This one is 
thanks to our friend Shatter [RiSC].  He's been a busy guy this week, trying 
to make a warez list and do his exams all at the same time, so if there are 
any screwups, cut him some slack.  I am currently in shittly Linux PICO, so 
sorry about no hi ascii borders and the simple organization of the chart - 
but it's the best I could do in 1/2 an hour.  Enjoy.
