---=[ 1. Letters to the Editor ]----------------------------------------------

More letters like usual, and we appreciate them.  One of the requests we have
received is to get a TOP TEN BOARD section in our mag.  We plan to do so as
soon as we gather some capable and qualified reviewers.


I just wanted to drop ya a line to tell ya what a great mag your running is.
Let me start by saying I enjoyed reading it, it allowed me to find out what 
is new in the warez scene.  I come from a small town in Canada.  Half of the 
warez listed in the mags never reach us.

Thanxs For such a GREAT! MAG! and keep up the GOOD work.

Thanxs Stimpy

RAPTOR - We appreciate that you are happy with the mag.  Better luck on the 
         warez though.

Biased Utils Report made by Jimmy Jamez Issue #6 PART 1:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like a good habit, you read my weekly report again!  I am really sorry that I
was a reason of INQ#6 delay because I have been really busy lately due to my
participation in the scene.  Anyway I checked all passed stuff and made notes 
for myself.  Good releasing week, some major titles happened and groups were 
active again.  We all had suprises as newbie groups with fine releases, like 
ROR succesfully beaten all big bands on long awaited Adobe Pagemaker 6.0.  
Also, we saw three different FINAL releases of QEMM 8.0.  I know your 
question.  What to get, PNC release, FINAL FINAL release or the ShrinkWarp 
release - the answer - get the FINAL FINAL release, it is really the final 
code.  Now lets travel among big the groups' releases for past 7 days from 
11-07-95 till 11-13-95.

* in alphabet order *

DOD (Drink Or Die) - Brilliant week for DOD again.  13 very nice releases
occurred, including some big, long-awaited titles, shown good store and 
internal pick up this time.  Now let me list all releases names here: it 
started with a nice word processor, Accent Express 2.0 for Win95 (supports 20
different languages), after it we saw couple of budget titles:  Family Tree 
Maker 3.0 (3 Disks) and Quicken Family Laywer (2 Disks), after that there were 
some two days silence and big bundle of software on weekend!  Four packages of 
another nice word processor, Describe Voyager 5.0, versions for Windows, 
Windows 95, OS/2 Warp and Add-on Dictionaries.  Small psychological proggy 
Decide Right for Windows (2 Disks) and FINAL CD-RIP of Micrographix ABC Snap
Graphix Suite (28 2.8mb Disks).  Many new unreleased Micrographix programs 
were included there.  The week finished with PowerSoft PowerBuilder 4.03 for 
Windows NT (30 Disks) and a cute expensive astronomy product called Win*Star + 
some add-ons to it.  Very impressive work this time, DOD is awarded excellent 
points this time.

Current Week Points:       10/10
Overall Score      :       55/60

PNT (Pantera) - It is not news that this group is doing better and better each 
week!  This week is not an exception!  They released 8 programs, but one game 
that they put out (Power Poker for Windows) was old dupe of Nexus from 1994. 
Others were fine; here they are:  Attachmate APPC Client 3.10 for Win (2 
Disks), DbWeb 1.0 for Windows NT (6 Disks), MS System Management Server 1.1 
(45 Disks) and several 1 Disk releases: Winframe Clients for Win 16 and
32 bit, DbWeb Service Pack 1 and Winframe for DOS. The group is releasing 
usually internal programming related programs.

Current Week Points:       O7/10
Overall Score      :       35/60

PNC (PiNNaCLe) - Still a very sad picture here, from all of the group releases
I noticed only three valid ones:  Multimedia WWW PC 3.0 for Windows (1 Disk),
NCompass 1.21 for Win95 (3 Disks) and Netware Client 32 for Win95 Open Beta (7
Disks).  All others were dupes like Conner BackUp Exec 5.0a, Asymetrix 
Multimedia Toolbook 3.0 (very strange release, because I have 3.0 from late 
1994 and it is on 10+ disks).  But, they still try to be on top with us and we 
need to respect this try.  Lets hope that they will dupe check their releases 
better.

Current Week Points:       O4/10
Overall Score      :       21/60

PWA (Pirates With Attitude) - Not the best week for PWA too, they started with 
two very huge CD-RIPs as Platinum Asset Manager SQL for NT (39 Disks and 
Mathlib + Calculus 1.2 (36 Disks).  All the other releases were small and we 
saw a nice ammount of cracked sharewares.  Computer Based Training TCP/IP (4 
Disks) and many 1 disks programs: Electroson Gear 3.23 for NT, GrabNet 2.0 
cracked, Intermail Interecho 1.14, Interdrive 95 NFS Client Beta Cracked, 
Cubase Score 1.12 dongle cracked (not cracked properly), WinU 1.03 Security,
and WBS Chart for Project 3.0.  Also there were some bigger utils like InterAp 
Internet Suite (4 Disks), Intergra Business App Builder 3.0 (7 Disks) and a 
huge beta 3 of Microstation CAD 95.  No well-known titles and a big lack of 
store pick-up.  Anyway, not too many betas as always and we all saw huge 
amount of work from the crackers. :)  Hope they will try harder next time.

Current Week Points:       O8/10
Overall Score      :       54/60

RBS (Rebels) - Guess this Euro team frozen with first snow. Absolutely nothing
for last 7 days.  Hope to see something from them in next issue. 

Current Week Points:       OO/10
Overall Score      :       18/60

That's all I can tell you about past week.  December is coming and it reminds 
us that we will see shitload of fine utils soon.  New groups will hopefully 
work better and I will write something about them exactly.

Biased Utils Report made by Jimmy Jamez Issue #6 PART 2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Comdex finished and nothing happened. :)  We expected something serious to 
come from this great computer-related event and we're really dissapointed.
Anyway this week shown us some rare brilliant utilities and let me show you
some of them. 

* in alphabet order *

DOD (Drink Or Die) - Impressive but not perfect.  It started with Microsoft 
Access 7.0 FINAL FLOPPY for Win95 (10 Disks); it was a long race with many 
scene groups DOD won it this time.  What else was released?  Of course, I want 
to mention a brilliant and the best multimedia presentation package called 
Astound 2.1 for Win/Win95!  If you ever try that you will forget about MS 
PowerPoint forever. :)  I was very surprised with the quality and power of 
this program.  Also there were: IRMA for Internet 3.1 (c) Attachment (3 Disks) 
(very nice internet package), Yamaha Visual Arranger for Win (2 Disks) - to 
all musical fans and a bundle packages from stores: Counters Creator for Win95 
(13 Disks), FloorPlan 3-D 2.0 for Win (2 Disks), Suretrack 1.5 for Windows (8 
Disks) and Netscape Power Pack (7 Disks).  The whole week was quiet except MS 
Access and on the weekend, the group shown it's real ability on scene.  We 
expect more and more from them in future. 

Current Week Points:      O9/10
Overall Score      :      64/70

PNT (Pantera) - Kinda slow week for those dudes.  Only three valid releases 
and one dupe occurred.  The releases are: IRMA TCP Suite for WFW/95 and NT (13 
Disks), IRMA for Internet / Teleview 3.11 (5 Disks) (not sure if it's the same 
as DOD version) and Your Personal SAT Trainer (2 Disks).  The dupe happened in 
the last day of the week and was called Distinct TCP/IP (2 Disks).  Lame to 
compare with previous work and small points awarded coz of that.

Current Week Points:      O4/10
Overall Score      :      39/70

PNC (PiNNaCLe) - Still bad quality.  Six valid releases and two dupes. 
Nothing really known or cool but some releases were OK.  Let me tell them all 
for the past 7 days: W3C Source Code Library (1 Disk), dupe of Scan Wizard for 
Win95 that appeared to be one for Win and old (2 Disks), UDIWWW 32-bit English 
(1 Disk), VR Scout VRML Viewer (2 Disks), Patter Maker Cross Stich for Windows
(1 Disk), Quarterdeck's WebAuthor 2.0 (2 Disks), dupe of Portfolio 2.0 and 
Visual Reality Bonus CD (7 Disks).  The whole group is doing better this time, 
but still has shitload to fix and main problem is dupe checking!  Lets see 
what they will show us on next week.

Current Week Points:      O5/10
Overall Score      :      26/70

PWA (Pirates With Attitude) - Due of the lack of finals group turned into
totally beta releasing.  There were 8 programs released and 6 (!!!) of them
were betas, usually huge.  We saw pre-releases and not betas of: Microstation
CAD, Imagineer Technical (PWA is releasing betas for this programs with 1 
week delay <g>), Dr. Solomon's Antivirus for NT 7.51 beta, Lotus Notes 4.0 
beta (only one really cool beta released), CA-Open Ingres 1.0 Beta and
CA-Visual Telon 1.0 Beta.  Also 2 final compiled programs: one is very big
Visual Reality 2.0 CD-RIP (46 Disks) and AlertTrack (2 Disks).  Weak week,
hopefully because all active PWA leaders spent their time on Comdex!  Lets 
hope they will not release as many betas as they did now.

Current Week Points:      O7/10
Overall Score      :      61/70

RBS (Rebels) - Still nothing from the Swedens this time!  If they will not 
start next week - I will replace them with ROR!!!

Current Week Points:      OO/10
Overall Score      :      18/70

So, the week of Comdex is over, and over with some results - such big titles
like MS Access 7.0 and WinFax Pro for Win95 are released!  The other programs
were less popular but definite quality.  Only one shortcoming this time - less 
overall group activity.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            THE GAME REVIEW
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

=Serious Pinball 2000=
        ROR, 1.7 megs.  I know I've played these two tables before.  Includes
the "rocket" table and the "gravyard" table (Outer space/Scary themes).  It's
the outdated pinball type boards of old times.  Nothing special, and to add
to it, the Graveyard pinball's sound was fucked up.  Decent small pinball if
that's what you're looking for.  Oh, did I forgot to mention 2 letters? SW!
                                RATING: 39/100

=The Nemesis Mission=
        Tdujam, 8 disks.  Class, can we say "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome"?  That's
exactly what you'll get after playing this one for more than 15 minutes.  You
are a ship, you roam the little playing area and shoot at asteroids. Speaking
of asteroids, thats exactly what this game is like, except in VGA & for win.
Just have fun banging away at the shift key and blowing up shit until sumtin
good comes out.  However 8 disks for this sucker is a bit too much.
                                RATING: 42/100

=The Jungle Book=
        Tdujam (surprise surprise a floppy), 3 disks.  If you can get the it
out of your mind that it's a kiddie game, you might be able to find it some-
what enjoyable.  It's practically a lot like the Lion King game release about
a year ago.  Your that jungle dude, you have to find the dimaonds.  You swing
from vines, jump around, kill creatures etc.  Nice graphics and assortment of
characters and scenery.  Despite the fact that many will look at it and say,
"kiddie crap" it's a very well layed out game, especially for its small size.
PS: Don't be doing something important when you go to play this, b/c the only                                
    way to exit, is that big button on your computer that says "RESET".
                                RATING: 79/100

=Earthworm Jim=
        RPC, 8 disks.  Yes it works, but it's just some beta or homemade shit
certainly not final release.  It looks homemade, or like a beta.  It has no
sound and the graphics fuck up.  Although if it had sound, and worked 100% it
would be decent.  Since it would be easy to classify games from now on, I'll
refer to this as the Super Mario Gameplay (SMG), where you walk around and
shoot things, and kill other characters.
                                RATING: 10/100

=Mafia 2=
        Don't work.  Install.exe just reboots computer.
                                RATING: NA/100

=Ran Soccer -German-=
        I decided to give it a shot, I was able to install my soundcard, and
learn that "Ja is german for yes, and nein is german for no".  However the
game didn't load, it just exited with some crap in german.
                                RATING: NA/100

=Fifa Demo '96=
        <Better late then never>.  It seems that all too many games are
moving away from the fast action arcade fun to the more sophisticated number
playing games.  But I'm happy to report that this is not one of them.  The
game is still fun, flows nicely, and has great action.  And according to the
menu, it will have modem play.  Now if only they would let ME define my keys.
Anyhow, the game looks to be a great hit, however it may be a little to big
for it to be ripped and still enjoyed.
                                RATING: 82/100

=Stonekeep Playable Demo=
        It's not playable if it don't work.  The usual CD problems that you
can't solve no matter what you do.

=Stonekeep CD=
        Tdujam, and a measly 35 disks.  Jesus, by the time this thing was
done loading it was the next day.  I would estimate the actual time it takes
from when you type "sk" till the game begins, on a 486/33, to be about 2 min.
My hd spinned more than it has it's entire lifetime.  The game is your doom
catacomb atmosphere, with the RPG style fighting and keeping of weapons.
You can't complain about the details and graphics in this one, but for 35
disks it damn well better have good graphics.  It's still nothing to get all
hiped up about, as it's just another RPG wasting away 88 megs installed.

*Before the fix:        
        Hoodlum <thought they were dead, probably are since...>, 8 disks.
"Can't read data file".  Ok that's nice.  "Can't play game."  "Can't rate
a game you can't play."  "Error #634bs482release35 has occured".  Get the pt?
                                RATING: BS/100
*After the fix:
        Hoodlum?  Back from the dead?  Wow, and impressive release too.  The
intro was kinda neat, nice sound to it.  However the sound seem to be lost
during the game, simply b/c, there was NONE.  The game is soccer, but with
those virtua fighter looking characters.  The game is also not full screen.
The movement is fine, and the graphics are semi decent.  However the camera
angles can get a big annoying, because it forces your movement towards a
destination to change to left or left-right, etc.  Overall I think I'm still
a little stunned that it works.

=Gameboy=
        You've seen the emulator, you've seen those thousands of packs being
offered, but your just too damn fucking lazy to get it and try it out.  Well,
that is the reason you're reading this isn't it?  Yes it does work.  It is
slow, it has no sound, and it is B&W.  There's over 215 games out, thanks to
GWA for the release of them.  The games bring back memories, and it's just
kinda neat to be able to say you have 215 gameboy games on your PC.

christmas/chanukah, but he will provide you with 5 minutes of nonstop, heart

Annoying soundtrack, and crappy sound effects.  Maybe the other two missions

ground.  I couldn't get the first puzzle on 3 attempts, but then again it's

entire game like this, it'll only be around 500 CD's.  Check out the cleavage
on the `dame'.
                           RATING: Two thumbs up

=Quake Fake=
        Someone actually had to make an effort to put this one together.
What it does: Loads that beginning screen with all those init's and crap that
you know from doom/doom2, then after that's done, it shows a little disk in
the bottom right flickering as if it were loading.  Then it splatters some
crap colors and reboots your computer.  No harm or viruses noticed in it, at
least I hope not.

Fighter Duel - Avalon Blue

Years ago, Fighter Duel made it's debut on the Amiga platform.  In terms of 
flight mechanics and individual plane's performance, it was one of the most 
advanced simulators of it's day.  It's biggest drawback at that time was that 
it's 16 color polygon graphics and completely crude ground obstacles.  One I 
remember in particular was a gigantic white Stonehenge - like arch smack dab 
in the middle of the battlefield.  It didn't look too hot but the World War II 
era planes sure performed historically correct.  Corkscrewing into the ground 
over and over upon takeoff was my major frustration as I learned to handle 
these old-time fighters.

In this release for the PC, the utterly realistic flight model is the only 
thing carried over from the original Amiga release.  The blocky surreal 
landscape has been replaced by gorgeous 256 color SVGA graphics.  The 
instrument panels are particularly striking.  You can fly any of thirteen 
different prop-driven fighters including such storied planes as the Spitfire, 
Hellcat, Mustang, Corsair, and Me-109.  You fly your plane against up to eight 
computer controlled opponents, also flying planes of your choosing.

There are no real missions in Fighter Duel but you can shoose to start in any 
of a number of scenarios, such as a catapult launch from the deck of the 
U.S.S. Lexington or a surprise attack, which has you swooping down on your 
enemies in a high-speed dive from their blind spot.

This is still no walk in the park as far as flight simulators go.  Just trying 
to get the plane in the air and level can bring you to tears.  It pays to go 
to the library and get a book on these old warbirds, to learn their individual 
idiosyncrasies.  If you're looking for a realistic World War II flight sim 
though, look no further than Fighter Duel.

---=[ 4. Interview - Anonymous - Rebuttle ]------------------------------------

INQ       : Why do you feel RTS broke up?
Incognito : I felt RTS broke up due to the lack of commitment in the whole 
            Team.  Certain areas were more commited than others, but if 
            Seniors don't show much commitment than it doesn't exactly set a 
            good example for the rest of the team, hence this started in my 
            own opinion the breakup of RTS
INQ       : Do you think Dorian tried to break RTS up?
Incognito : No, I did not feel Dorian tried to break up RTS, as a courier of 
            RTS, I got the impression he was the one trying to rebuild RTS, 
            afterall he was taking the reigns of RTS, while Ordnance was away 
            for quite a while.  And, for a person to do that requires great 
            strength.  If I hadn't been for Dorian putting time and effort 
            into RTS, RTS would have fell apart even earlier.
INQ       : So he was not getting help from the other council members?
Incognito : The only council member I felt that was trying to help Dorian 
            co-ordinate on the Net side was Aslan, but it took me 4 weeks as a 
            courier getting in; like Aslan approved of me, but another council 
            member needed approval from Dorian even though Aslan told me 
            Dorian approved of me.  So from the outset it looked like council 
            had problems anyways.
INQ       : Why do you think Dorian decided to quit and reform MAliCE?
Incognito : I believed Dorian quit, because he was getting no support from 
            anyone at all.  The fact that Ordnance as a Senior was not around 
            certainly did not help him.  In terms of motivation, however I 
            believed the final straw was when Ordnance returned and decided to 
            implement policies without consultation with Dorian at all.  After 
            that, I think Dorian had enough, he gave his time and effort to 
            RTS, and got Zippo back, as a courier.  I believed he was the main 
            driving force for RTS.
INQ       : How successful do you think RTS will be now?
Incognito : RTS, I think they can make a come back but I don't think they can 
            be as strong as what they were in their haydays.  But, if the same 
            beaucratic bullshit appears in RTS, then I believe there is no 
            hope as a competitive couriering force.  Well the answer to that 
            is to look around on the boards and the major sites.  MAliCE in my 
            opinion has done alot more in 6 weeks than RTS has done in 4 
            months.  I am a courier in MAliCE and I think the spirit in MAliCE
            is more relaxed; the Council and the President always talk.  And, 
            things actually get done.  For example, the MAliCE NFP is updated 
            weekly if not daily.  I feel as a group, MAliCE, is more 
            co-ordinated.
INQ       : Allegedly Dorian was trying to reform MAliCE back in the summer, 
            any truth to this?
Incognito : Yes that was true.  Dorian was trying to reform MAliCE back then 
            because, although I dont know for sure, RTS was beginning to have 
            internal problems from there.  Like council members bickering and 
            things getting disorganized.
INQ       : So was Dorian trying to break up RTS so he could reform Malice?
Incognito : No, I dont think that was in his heart, I think he was trying to 
            reform Malice by himself and probably other members of RTS, who 
            were getting pissed at the disorganization, but that was what I 
            was told, by someone higher up.

                              "Rebuttle - Busts"                    

Okee dokee, the first thing to point out, in your interview with W00per, he 
attempted to explain some stuff on a bond issue and what happened with that.

Any time a company files a civil suit and wants to seize equipment, they are
required by law to file a bond of 1.5 times the estimated value of the
equipment seized.  In order to cover potential damages that happen durring
the seized period of time until the case is ended or settled.

They had to file a $150,000 bond when they got the search and seizure order
for my board.

As for your things to "help" out in case someone gets busted.

You said, "Move all pirated material into your server.  They legally cannot 
keep any equipment that does not contain pirated material."

To be perfectly concise, that's complete bullshit.  If it were a criminal case 
that was going on, then there is a lot of truth to that, and many other things 
that make it difficult on behalf of the people who seized things and much 
nicer for those who were busted.  For a civil case, which is ALL that is being 
filed lately, there is no such case law, and no precedents that apply at all, 
it's entirely new ground, and they can seize basically whatever the hell they 
want to as long as it's vaguely connected in some way.  Plugged in counts, 
network counts more.

My system was ran in a manner that would go along with what you're trying to
tell people to do.  It was a novell system where everything was on the server.  
The board was run by 9 diskless workstations with USR modems, and 2 USR 
CommServers (also diskless).  All of it was seized because the civil case was 
filed along the grounds of "contributing to" copyright infringement.  That 
means that I (or others as cases are filed) were "providing the means" that 
allowed people to infringe on their copyrights.  That helps give them the 
ability to seize anything and everything that assists in providing those 
means.  Which is the entire network, the modems, the diskless stations, etc.  
Even UPSs and surge bars.

Also, you tell people to research copyright laws in their own states.  This
has no bearing on anything at all.  The cases that are filed are filed in
federal court, citing federal copyright statutes.  These take all precedence
over any state or local laws, so knowing what your state says won't make a
bit of difference.

Anyway, just wanted to point those things out.  They way it's all going is
that MS/Novell and others aren't intelligently pursuing pirates at all.
They really don't have the foggiest fucking clue on how the system works or
who does what.  They attack boards based on someone calling in to their
piracy hotlines and supplying a login account, and they begin research from
there.

Someone had supplied them a login to my system and that's where it started.
I researched as best I could all the cases ever filed by them previous to my
bust, and found the same procedures were followed.  It's not an "intelligent" 
thing on their part, but a lucky one.  Just takes advantage of how upset 
someone is with anyone's BBS and what kinda access they have.

                                "Net Ethics"
      
        Hello, this is Darwin, your friendly neighborhood net courier, coming
to you live and direct.  I've been noticing a lot of bullshit in the net scene 
lately, and I'd like to toss out some ideas and address some issues that I 
think need adressing.  The net scene is the future; people and standards have 
to be maintained.  The best boards are what the best FTP sites will have to 
become; a place where the best and most capable hang with intense competition. 
Notice I don't say friendly competition, because it isn't always.  I'd like it 
to be, but people have egos.  So, the same bullshit happens over and over 
again.  Whatever, just let your reputation and your uploads stand as an 
indication of your skills.  There's no need to talk trash, and the worst thing 
in the world is when someone proves your trash talking wrong. 

        I have to say my peace about the way that things are released and
traded on the net today.  If you were a BBS trader, would you upload disks
1, 2, 10-16 and 25 to a board?  Of course you wouldn't.  So, why the hell do
people do it on sites?  I don't think that the competition is to get 
individual disks up, people; it's to up a *complete*, *tradable* release.
Look at Screamer, look at Lemmings Chronicals, I Have No Mouth, et cetara.  I 
try to make a point not to up a release until I have *all* of the disks. 
People start upping the 4 out of twenty disks they have, and those 4 disks get
spread everywhere.  Do you know how much time I've wasted checking sites
every few hours for more disks?  What is happening here?  How are the releases
getting spread from the release groups?

        The way I would envision releases to the net is basically the way that 
releases to BBS's work now.  The release gets upped to the release group's WHQ 
FTP site.  The group's net traders grab the release and send it to the sites 
they're on once it is complete there.  After all, is there competition between 
two traders in the same group?  There shouldn't be.  The objective is to get 
the full release traded as quickly as possible.  From experience, I know that 
this isn't happening, and it looks bad for *everyone who ups an incomplete*.  
I mean, who wants to see five different upload names for one release?  That's 
just silly.  How do you divide the creds, how do you make a name for yourself? 
I think it's a mess.  This brings me to my next point : credits for uploads.

        Many sites now-a-days have Top-Up lists or logfiles of who uploads and
downloads.  Now, I don't have any problem at all with these, but they don't
help you see who has been uploading that day or week.  My personal solution to 
this is to let people see who won on a given release on a given site by 
putting the name of the courier on the end of the directory.  I mean, 
seriously, people, what the hell is the problem with it?  It's really hard to 
ignore that a trader has gotten every release on a given day or whatever other 
feat of trading that occurs if the name is all over that days' listing.  In 
this way, a trader can make a name for himself on a given site or in a group 
of sites.  It's not like there are a specific group of sites, like the top ten 
boards or whatever.  A person makes himself the best on whatever site they 
choose, and they should be able to have their name known.

        After all, what is this scene about if it's not competition?  Is it
about how useful the files are?  How many traders used Netscape Plus Pack or
played The Hive?  Not too many, especially those who dial-in to a shell 
account.  Who wants to download 30 disks at 28.8k?  Not most people, 
especially if the game may very well suck?  Most of all, we must be try to
have *fun*.  That's why we do this, people, because it's amusing and it passes 
the time in a way we like.  If it's not fun, we should hang it up.  I 
personally don't enjoy rag wars, group fights, incompletes, dupes, trash 
talking, et cetera.  I don't have fun when this shit is going on, and I want
to stop it.  If someone has a problem with me, then talk to me about it.  I'm
a reasonable guy, if you're reasonable to me.  I think that this is true of
most of the people who have been with this scene as long as I have, and I
think it's a damn shame that people can ruin a fun thing for some cruel
selfish kicks.

        Anyway, peace out, this has been dWi/darwin for Inquisition Mag.

The following exchange is the result of e-mail exchange between one CHRIS 
CARTER @iia2.org (supposedly either the offices of SPA or an account used
by SPA) and the sysadmin of a local provider in an eastern state.  Not only
is Mr. Carter not happy that the SysAdmin will NOT violate the privacy laws,
he resorts to threats and intimidation in an attempt to coerce the SysAdmin
into becoming a co-conspirator in his dirty work.  According to Mr. Carter,
the OTHER 200 administrators were more co-operative.  Please consider, if your 
SysAdmin is one of the 200 which Mr. Carter claims are co-operative, your 
every word and thought may be open to Mr. Carter's prying eye.

Before this crackpot's tactics succeed in violating the private mail and
business of each and every person who has ever used a computer or ever been on 
the internet in any manner, perhaps the internet community would do well to 
e-mail Mr. Carter and let him know your views.  It should be sufficient to 
simply return this mail to Mr. Carter with the following thought to Mr. Carter 
at:

Since Mr. Carter will no doubt quickly change his e-mail address, a copy 
should also be sent to:
                  
                           root@iia2.org

Let your voice be heard before Mr. Carter determines he has the right to read 
your e-mail also.

Should you really feel incensed about this episode which really does amount to 
a private employee of the SPA trying FORCE someone else into the illegal act 
of violating every privacy law we hold dear, you might also e-mail a copy to 
your own state and federal elected officials.  Only if we make it known to 
elected officials how we, the American public, view the creeping intrusion 
into our privacy, will we be able to make a contribution to a future free of 
this type of intrusion.

Re: Your violation of privacy laws


Mr. Carter, while your personal views regarding software piracy may be
deemed by some to have merit, the citizens of the United States of 
America are not willing to dump our Constitution and Bill of Rights on
the trash heap of history for the benefit of the SPA or ANY software
developer.  To the contrary we feel your gestapo tactics are far more
sinister and if you persist, the American public (to say nothing of those
in the local, state and federal government who are sworn to uphold the
law) may deem that YOU Sir are a real threat to our way of life and
decide that in order to send our message loud and clear, we will no
longer support ANY software company who is found to support your methods
of invasion of privacy. 

==============================================================================

Personal Note From This Writer:  

Mr. Carter, I was influential in the purchase of at least $500,000 worth of 
software for my company in the past year alone.  Each and every product used 
by my company is properly licensed and I also purchase each and every product 
which I use on my personal computer.  However, like many others, I do indeed 
download and review many "pirated" copies.  Not because I wish to bankrupt the 
developers by not paying for the product, but because I do not wish to have my 
company bankrupted by hugh investments into products that do not work as 
intended.  Tomorrow I will be spending my company's money to travel to Comdex 
to view the offerings of your employers.  However, I do think that I shall be 
VERY reluctant to purchase any more product than is ABSOLUTELY essential.  We 
can do very well with what we have already bought and paid for.  Until the 
developers decide they have better things to do with their money than promote 
your illegal acts, I will continue to refrain from supporting them.

==============================================================================

I have no such evidence of any illegal activity.  It is possible that this is
a hacked IRC server or a spoofed username.  I can not and will not violate the
privacy of our users without a court order, in accordance with the Electronic
Privacy Act of 1986.  I suggest that you take your "evidence" or lack thereof

Our friend with the SPA was not at all happy with the response from the
sysadmin and raised the level of his intimidation as shown from the next

The Sysadmin then replied as follows:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Well Mr. Carter, perhaps your technical understanding of
networks is much to be desired.  Anyone can forge connections or packets,
especially on an insecure platform such as TCP/IP.  I suggest you right
now contact the local (name of city) police department.  I will tell them the
same thing I have told you.  I WILL NOT RELEASE ANY USER INFORMATION OR
VIOLATE THE PRIVACY OF OUR USERS WITHOUT A COURT ORDER.

Furthermore, I consider your e-mail of a threatening and harrassing nature.
If you contact me again in any form, e-mail, phone, or in person; I will file
a formal complaint against you, this is your final warning.

Look Mr. xxx,

The next time I catch "xxx" (xxx@xxxxx.com) transfering 
pirated software online IRC from openix.com, I will contact your 
local police authorities and have them contact you.  If you want to make 
things difficult, then so be it.

End of discussion.

I think it is wonderful that you are tired of illegal activity.  I do not
believe IRC logs to be evidence, since they can be altered easily.  Did you
DCC a copy of this software from him to verify that it was illegitimate?
If you did then you are just as guilty as he is, if you didn't then you
don't know that it was a real copy.  How do I know that you are not
just unhappy with a user here and have not forged the logs?

I do not have a lack of attention in any matter concerning illegal activity,
but I simply do not jump through hoops because some irrate IRC user e-mails
me.  If I was to look through ANY user's files on our system, that would be
illegal.  We here at OPENIX are strongly against software piracy, but we
are also *STRONGLY* against invasion of privacy.

Your opinions concerning violating the privacy of our users in regards to
administration policies are not welcome.  We follow existing legislation in
regards to the law, and do not permit illegal activity of any sort...including
the violation of the privacy of our users.

SO IN CONCLUSION:  I AM NOT SEARCHING THROUGH USERS FILES OR COOPERATING WITH
ANYONE WANTING TO GO AGAINST THE ELECTRONIC PRIVACY COMMUNICATION ACT OF 1986
WITHOUT A COURT ORDER.

Again, thank you for your concern,

        The next time I download pirated software from "xxx" who 
frequents the IRC warez channels, I will personally contact the (Name of City), 
(Name of State) police authorities.  They will handle the problem.  I am
getting very tiresome of the amount of copyrighted software that is being 
exchanged online IRC.

        It is very interesting to note your lack of action in this 
matter.  I've talked with over 200 administrators in the past few months, 
all of which have taken a strong standing against software piracy.

        It is also interesting to note that your business does not have a 
user contract which permits you to do standard administrative 
investigations against illegal activity.  If a court order is what you 
need, then I will contact the (Name of State) police and have them contact you.

---=[ 7. Announcements - Final Epidsode ]=------------------------------------

Devast    : Oyl is here, what do you want me to ask her?
MikeySoft : Umm...  Stuff.
Devast    : Like?
MikeySoft : Oh...  Whatever tunes you fork.
MikeySoft : Fill in the blanks
Oyl Patch : Evening.
MikeySoft : Ah
Devast    : Fill in the blanks.  :)
Oyl Patch : Mikey, you mean MOI?
Oyl Patch : Well, basically, not much to fill in.  Mikey got busted as we all 
            know.  For personal sufficient reasons, Mikey did not think it was 
            essential that he broadcast it. 
Devast    : Uh-uh. 
MikeySoft : And it had nothing to do with Scene stuff.
Oyl Patch : Anyway, Mikey and I had had a LONG discussion about the events.
            Mikey knows that I was concerned about certain security issues, 
            and thought it was absolutely essential that a few people knew of 
            the bust.  Naturally, Mikey did not really want to let it all hang 
            out, and based on his attorney's advice, he tried to keep it 
            quieter.  Whole truth and nothing but the truth is that the bust 
            was a bit earlier than Mikey had said.
MikeySoft : Yup
Oyl Patch : No real biggy and many have said, they would not want it broadcast 
            either.  And he was also following his attorney's advice.
MikeySoft : Yup!
Devast    : OK.
MikeySoft : That's true too!
Oyl Patch : Mikey and I have been friends for MANY MANY years, and because we 
            have been so close, there was no way he could hide it from me.
MikeySoft : This is also true.
Oyl Patch : So turns out, it was me, who has been as close to him as any, was
            the one who actually blew the HORN, not a wee whistle but a DAMNED 
            BULL HORN!  Not a first, but again because of my concerns for 
            security.  I did let a couple of seniors know the facts.
MikeySoft : This is also true.
Oyl Patch : Finally, I just told Mikey, cut the bull shit, lets get rid of the 
            issue, admit it was a bit earlier than alledged and forget it.
MikeySoft : I'm asking everyone to please understand that the few days that we 
            are talking about, I never ever compromised anyone.

Basically this is the final epidsode.  We meant to put this out much earlier 
since it is old news.  Anyhow - good luck to Mikey and his pursuits in the
future.

        Well boys and girls, I don't know whether I should be pleased or sorry 
to say that there have only been about 60 subscriptions to the E-Mail service.
For me, that is plenty to keep the service up.  And 60 may seem like a lot of
people, but compared to the total amount of readers of this mag, it ain't 
much.  Then again, if there are only 60 readers of the mag (which I don't 
THINK is true), then we must be really doing a sorry ass job.
  
        The subscriptions that we did get, however, were very pleasing.  Seems 
like the INQ is really making it all the way around the world.  There are
subscriptions from Canada, Italy, numerous spots in the US, Finland, Russia,
Japan, and a few other countries.  I'd say that's far from bad.
        
        Once again, if you wish to get a subscription to INQuisition magazine 
by E-mail, either MSG me on iRC (Lurch) or e-mail me at lurch1@intac.com and 
tell me your E-mail address and whether you want the mag in Plaintext or 
UUencoded.  Subscriptions for friends are also welcome but please no 
BillG@msn.com :)
        
        NOTE!  I collected all the URLs that people sent me in a file.  
Unfortunately, due to Mr. Gates that file was lost.  (The HD got full, and 
apparently something in Win95 did something it wasn't supposed to.  So the 
file is gone).  Please re-mail me with the URLs you want added to the 
InterNET page list, and they'll be added in the next issue.  There was also an 
error correction, I do not know if there will be enough time to fix it in this 
issue, since I don't remember which URL was the one that was claimed not to 
work.  Sorry 'bout that.

           thought that I could either join INQ, and get them the coding they 
           need, or start a new e-mag that would run well.  And, I really 
           didn't like it when JJ (Jimmy Jamez) threatened PNC, he said like, 
           do this, or I'll give you guys bad advertisement.  That was bad, so 
           I want to start a coded e-mag/music et cetera, and perhaps kick some 
           butt.
Raptor   : Tsunami: I know - JJ is real competive - He'll prolly try to bury 
           you guys himself.
Tsunami  : Well, let him try.  None of the guys doing this are in the scene 
           much. :)  But of course, any INQ guys who'd like to join are 
           welcomed.  That is, once we get the first issue out, so people can 
           read it.
Raptor   : Tsunami: So you are going to take INQ guys :)
Tsunami  : Of course! :)  Why not?  If they want to join, go ahead.  I don't 
           care; I'm not like JJ.  First, I'm an American. :)  Thank God! :)
           Second, I don't give a damn.  I just want to do and see what 
           happens.  If it's fun, I'll keep doing it.
Raptor   : Tsunami: Cool!  Then, you prolly won't get any interviews from PWA, 
           DOD, RZR and other groups by taking guys from the Mag that Lester 
           and I started.
Tsunami  : Really?  Okee :)  Raptor, it doesn't matter does it?  I was talking 
           more about YOU and LESTER.  Not the guys from INQ.  Do you know 
           what I mean?
Raptor   : Tsunami: Not to be an asshole, but when you openly admit that you 
           are going to steal guys from INQ - then you basically start a 
           little battle - I am sure Marlenus is logging this and I can pass 
           it to everyone to enjoy the ethics of the new mag. :)
Tsunami  : Go ahead :)  I said, I don't care if they apply, and I was implying 
           THEY = Raptor and Lester.  Raptor, are you afraid of competition?
           If not, then you should be happy.
Raptor   : Tsunami: Good luck with your new mag - BTW - Why would Lester and 
           myself leave a mag we created.  No, I am not afraid of competition, 
           but when they say they are going to take guys from my group - I tend 
           to be a little hostile.
Tsunami  : There's a new e-mag that might do just as well as INQ if not 
           better.
Raptor   : Marlenus: You running a log?
Marlenus : Always logging automatically, you need not ask :')
Mercy    : Rap: I got one going :)
Tsunami  : Good, then at least we're clear that you are not afraid of 
           competition. :)  Then all should be well, and all should be fun :)
Raptor   : Well - someone send me a log of what's taking place in here, so 
           that we can publish how our competition likes to do business - I'll 
           have fun watching JJ going AWOL on you guys.
DruidKin : Hmm..  Methinks Tsunami that you need to think about what you say a 
           little more.
Marlenus : Ask me when you are done fighting for the log :')
Magellan : Tsunami, I think you best do yer yapping after you atleast have a 
           few issues under yer belt. :)
Tsunami  : I know.  That's why I've stopped talking. :)  At least Raptor and I 
           have it clear that he's not afraid of competition and that this is 
           all in good fun :)
Raptor   : True
Magellan : Yea, well you stopped a little late me thinks man. :)
Raptor   : You guys might have a pretty mag, but we cover the nitty-gritty 
           shit.
DruidKin : I got a copy of some other mag and all the guy did was say shit and 
           fuck everyother word.

Well, I first like to wish Tsunami good like with Reality Check.  This log was
conducted on in the middle of last week.  Interesting how confident a person 
is before their product is produced.  As for Jimmy Jamez, well he's his own
thing and we do not condone his deeds at time, but we support him along with
the rest of our staff.
