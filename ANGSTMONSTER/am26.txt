: Brief Words :
: from gir    :
---------------

Time is strangely slow.  I'm sitting here waiting for time to pass by me like
some sort of dysfunctional rocke tship and hopefully not crash on top of my
computer but instead it's doing some graceful and by the book landing.  It
reminds me of the first and only time I road aboard a rocke tship.  I was still
very young and had never flown on a plane before so it was quite a nervous but
exciting moment for me.  Here I was, not even out of elementary school and I
was riding on a rocket ship.  Had it not been for the monster, we probably
would've gotten off the ground and made it into space.

If a monster ruined your chance to go to space in a rocket ship you'd be one
angry little kid and that's exactly what I was.  Monsters have a habit of 
causing all sorts of mischief on rocket ships because rocketships are a tasty
treat to monsters.  Always make sure that monsters eat really big meals before
they go on rocket ship rides so your rocket ship will actually get to go to
space.

In order to protect me from other monsters, the papers reported the monsters
death as his own fault.  "He was overly excited," the Associate Press was told 
in a news briefing, "and became claustrophobic in the rocket ship.  To relieve
himself of this alarmed state, the monster banged his head against one of the
glass windows of the rocket until he finally enough wounds from the breaking
shards of glass to be fatal."  That's right, as a mere elementary schooler I
managed to stab a monster to death with glass from a broken rocket ship window.

The monster community didn't buy the AP's story one bit.  They wanted to launch
an ongoing investigation to find out what really happened that day.  However
my people knew this would mean a war would break out among us and the monsters.
With recent development in monster weaponry, humans everywhere knew that such a
war would not be good for our still developing society.

Of course, these events were all quickly overlooked when a monster had been
found eating some of my school friends who were playing spaceman.  The monster
was set to be executed without a trial in a matter of weeks.  (This was back
when monsters didn't have the same rights as humans in the federal courts.)  So
that monster became the man of the moment and my failed rocket ship trip was
quickly forgotten about...

BUT I STILL REMEMBER IT!  I STILL FEEL THE PAIN OF NOT GETTING TO RIDE INTO
SPACE AS PART OF A SPECIAL PROGRAM TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN HUMANS AND 
MONSTERS!  I'M SO SORRY FOR WHAT I DID AND I DID NOT REALIZE UNTIL YEARS LATER
THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT I'D DONE!  I HOPE THAT MONSTERS AND MONSTER 
SYMPATHIZERS ALIKE CAN FIND FORGIVENESS FOR ME IN THEIR HEARTS.  OTHERWISE, I
DON'T THINK I'LL BE ABLE TO GO ON...

one-thousand, one-hundred and fifteen miles.
approximately sixty-six thousand, nine hundred minutes.
or, four million, fourteen thousand seconds.
 
alternately, about nineteen hours.
down, emotions flow like april showers,
no need for heat when you pack super powers,
even if within, your soul's so shook that it cowers.

mental segregation, can't unite the nation,
climbing up obstacles like conquering the appalachian.
testing boundaries and rising up like inflation, my appreciation:
lays in the frays of eternal degradation, mind, body & soul.

i turn pop and sing about being whole,
the hurt can't take it's toll, when out my emotions roll..
insert here, like a glory hole, so big you get swallowed whole.
 
pain dulled with champagne, as i try to retain and ascertain..
obtain an ad campaign to rain down stealthy, so as not to be picked up by
the weather vane.
and down i came, putting heretic poetics to shame.
take aim at my claim to fame, shoot it down to avoid the post game..
recap.  as i spread my wings and flap,
  
i eyeball the gap.
everlasting.
eternal.
love.

---------------------------

One night not too long after Christmas I wandered into the Auburn, ME Wal-Mart
to blow a gift card I had. I ended up getting Radiohead's "Kid A". My
stepmother was still shopping halfway across town, so I sat on a bench outside
for a while and watched the twilight. Dozens of cars pulled in, slowed down,
sped up, drove off, kicking up little puddles of brown-black slush as they
passed. All the stars were out that night. I started to get that feeling
essential to Maine: you're in the middle of civilization, but you could walk
half a mile in most directions and be in the thick of the woods. As I looked
around a guy, no more than 23 or 24, sat on the bench next to mine and waited
silently for a while. After a few minutes had passed, he turned to me and told
me, "I got a taxi coming. You need a ride to anywhere?" I considered briefly.
It was an invitation. He seemed sane enough, but that's always half the fun.
Who knows? Maybe he was bored, maybe he was friendly, or maybe he was some kind
of straight and lonely that I didn't understand. My ride would be coming soon,
though. "Nah, thanks..." 
Even as I said it I regretted it.

Since I started writing for Angstmonster, there seems to be an interest in
learning the Danish language, and tonight the almighty gir asked for a file on 
this subject, so here goes:

<DK1> nej, det er ikke så slemt.. det værste er, at jeg tror, jeg er sindssyg,
  fordi jeg sidder og skriver med mig selv hele tiden..
<US> no, it's not so bad.. the worst part is, that I think I'm insane, because
  I'm sitting here writing with myself all the time..
<DK2> du skal da være heldig, at der er en, der overhovedet gider snakke med

: giraffes  :

Giraffes have horns for fighting

Actually, it doesn't seem that way. If you have ever looked at a giraffe, you 
would know that the fighting knobblies are awfully cute.

Giraffes have black tongues, did you know that? I knew that, because I have 
seen them. They are at the Richmond zoo, and are very affectionate and much 
like petting zoo goats.

Giraffes live in holes underground with hobbits. Their tongues are black 
because they have been deprived of light.

But wait, that makes no sense, because black people live in the sun.

But giraffe tongues lighten in the sun, because the sunrays contain bleach that
only reacts with giraffe tongues.

Is that so? But, if you have seen the giraffes at the Richmond zoo, you would 
know that their tongues are in the sun all of the time, because they are 
constantly licking out for petting zoo pellets.

The black tongue was an adaptation of the ancient giraffe. And just like if you
put a black person underground they would not instantly turn white. So it will 
take thousands of generations before the above ground giraffe has a white 
tongue.

Sleep took the arguing half of my paper. Good-night

: The Truth About :
: Chuck'e'Cheese  :
:   by oregano    :
-------------------

Prologue: I will tell you the truth right off the bat.  "It's fun."  That is
the punchline to all this file.  If you read the title and wanted the ending
and that is all you are looking for you can stop reading, I told you the
ending, I am going to have a huge buildup and then say "Chuck E. Cheese is fun"
like it's some big secret.  Non-serious readers can go and read other things in
this Angsty Monster.
   Those of oyu still reading might say, "WWWWAH!  Boo Hoo!, you ruined it." 
Well 63% of oregano readers read files more than once, so my ruining it the
first time you read this file will not hurt later readings, you go into this
reading like a seasoned pro even the first time.  You can even read the file
out loud to your mom, or girlfriend, or what-have-you, and predict the ending,
because I just told you the ending.  The person you read out loud to might say,
"Oh, of course you can predict the ending, you have read this file before." 
   Tell them, "Nuh uh, I only looked at the introduction which has nothing to
do with nothing, so shut your trap hole and listen as I read." You will not be
lying, it will be your first time reading the file. But also you will know the
ending; I clued you in.
   On to the file.


The Terrible Secret of Chuckie Cheese is Revealed
-------------------------------------------------

   Chuckie Cheese harbors a dark secret, a secret that only comes to light now,
after it has taken hold of the heart and minds of youngsters all across
America.  I will tell you now, in this file just what it is that kids love so
much about Chuk EE Cheez and why their parents take them to it again and again. 
Read this file, if you dare, if you are not scared witless just at the thought
of finding out the Chuch E Cheese secret.  Here goes, cover your eyes, the
truth about is going to be revealed.  I hope the suspense is not going to kill
you.  This is going to be a huge surprise.  Might want to stop reading right
now and try to guess.  But if you did so it would be impossible, this secret to
CC is too hard to guess.  What?  Are you too wimpy to guess?  I thought so. 
Here is the secret about Chuk e Cheese: Its fun!


Epilogue: You might have thought "oregano is going to pull a fast one on me",
that I was going to say something other than "It's Fun"  But I knew you would
think I would think to do something like that.  Instead I did as I said.  But I
could tell you were getting nervous.  You might have read the first sentence
out loud and boldly proclaimed that you knew the secret, then, after you were
committed, you were not sure if you could trust the prologue, my being a tricky
trick-the-reader kind of guy.  You found yourself committing to trusting my
prologue and then suddenly thinking, "Is that prologue trustable?  Will the
person I am reading to think I am a dolt if I get it wrong?" But I outfoxed you
and gave you the real deal.  Sneaky.  Now you know that I did not trick you; 
and you know the terrible secret of Chuck E Cheese.  It has been a busy day for
you. Sleep well. 

The End

Is it really that strange for the editor of a publication to not actually write
anything for it?  Aren't the editorial duties enough?  According to the inner
circle at angstmonster, NO!  So as the humble and ever present super duper cool
editor, I've come to please all of you who wanted me to write something.  You
don't have to like it, just read it.

"I'm not going to lie to anyone at the table, I've been very frustrated lately
and it's been showing.  Not only has my attitude been off, by my work as well
has suffered immensely.  I don't want to go into too many details about what
happened, I will however explain how it got better."

I paused for theatrics.  Whenever I know the story I'm about to tell isn't what
it could be, I sneak some pauses in there to make the anticipation more 
important then what everyone is anticipating.

"Last night I found myself having to go to the bathroom the worst I'd ever had
to go in awhile.  The thing was, I was very excited by this.  It wasn't a 'I
have to find a bathroom now or I'm going to poop my pants' kind of urgency, it
was a very restless kind of explosion that took place once I sat down.  And to
tell you the truth, I have no intentions of looking back."

"When I dropped that dooker, I wasn't just getting rid of the watery wastes of
my bowels, I was letting go of a monster who smelled really bad and carried a
bad attitude with him wherever he went.  A bad attitude comprised mainly, of
all the things people say that irk us.  It may seem fickle, but you know as
well as I that when things build up inside, you eventually have to get rid of
them.  Some of us are fortunate to have outlets for that build up, but what
happens when that doesn't work?"

I paused again.  I let them look around and wonder "What happens when your
primary outlet fails you?"

"It's simple, you look for an alternate route.  Last night I discovered my
alternate route was taking a shit."

They all gasped.

"What did you take your shit out of the toilet and paint a picture with it?"

"Are you kidding!?  That'd be really gross.  It was the feeling that did it for
me.  And you all know the feeling.  It spells relief in big bold colorful 
letters.  When your body let's go of something, it gets all tingly and excited
and makes you feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside."

"Oh I get it."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah.  You're saying we've had it wrong all along..."

"EXACTLY!  We're in the wrong market for expelling angst.  This writing thing
is so tired and dated.  The future is in excrement and it's never smelt
better!"

We all had a hardy laugh at my predictable pun.  To celebrate our new plan for
world domination we had Taco Bell.  After all, it was one of their fierce 
burritos that allowed me to see what we had been overlooking all along.

It is out of fear that I sleep with a glass shard from the rocket ship window
under my pillow.  It's certainly not the smartest thing to do, especially since
I like to flail around a lot when I'm sleeping.  I've got a couple of nasty 
scars I'd rather not talk about as a result.  But at least I feel safer this
way.  Once one of those monsters tries to surprise me by popping out from under
my bed, I'm already leaping onto him and bashing his fucking face into the side
of my bed.

So if you're a monster trying to fuck me up, you should probably rethink your
methods.  Come on, be creative, I'm sure there some sort of attack I haven't
already planned retaliation for yet...
