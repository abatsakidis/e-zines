Earlier I was thinking that this wouldn't be another one of those "go to bed
at 11:30 am" days, but who knows?  I am not really doing much of anything other
than exploring scene.textfiles.com and educating myself on more stuff I missed
out on.  For the longest time (during the mid 90's) I thought having the
Anarchist Cookbook and Joller Roger -esque was enough.  When I first stumbled
upon the Cult of the Dead Cow site, I thought it was the coolest thing because
they had tfiles called "Zen and the art of skateboarding."  That ruled.  Of
course being the lame kid I was and still am, that's as far as I got with 
tfiles for awhile and I probably missed out on a lot but, it's still as fun now
as it seemed then...

I've been reading interviews and random issues of stuff like HOE, FUCK, SOB and
other random tfiles of the day, as a way to gauge things.  It's always been
neat the tradition and famillar feeling from group to group.  There's a certain
joy in being involved in this "scene" although I dunno if that's how it works
or not.  The whole idea of making a tfile and just letting sit on my "kinda 
hiding in the corner" site, doesn't really have the same effect as uploading it
to a BBS and letting everyone who visits that BBS download it, read it, and
then pass it along to a friend.  I should hunt around for some place to upload
my this to.

In an interview Mogel made an interesting point that I really dig because it 
describes the vibe I get from when things moved from BBS's to the Internet: 
" The difference? Well, there's not really a "community" anymore, I think. 
BBS's were full of groups of kids, wanting to be subversive, and they'd call 
up and download these funny-ass text files about blowing up mailboxes, or 
fucking the dead, or whatever. With the internet came a new idea that "ANYONE" 
could view these files, and it kind of killed the magic for some people. I'm 
not bitching, though. I mean, to some degree, you have to make community 
happen. You can't just expect random people to bump into each other. People who
just sit around and whine about no community are generally the same types of 
people who nobody would want to be in a community with anyway."

But enough of the sentimental stuff...  It's raining right now.  And if you
don't own a copy, get "Endtroducing" by DJ Shadow right now!

Just because I acknowledge the elements of my father's behavior I don't like
doesn't mean it's not already embedded in me.  To hate all those things that 
are embodied in the poor jealous moments I remember from when I was little,
doesn't mean I won't be the same middle aged jealousy.  Watching myself grow 
into him with commentary from conversations I have with friends about growing 
into our parents is a frightening thing.  But suddenly, on this night I don't 
feel that anymore.  It'd be so easy to curl up and be frightened and scared 
but I don't want to be that anymore.  It's not enough to cry alone in the dark 
anymore because the world isn't handing me things on a platter.  Spoiled brats,
are supposed to get that right?  Never lift a finger and even if all the bad 
things in the world come down on us, they'll be a reset button that's gotta 
infinite retries already hacked into it...  And if there was, after tonight I 
don't want it anymore.  And even if it bites with tones of cynicism, when my 
he says "You have a lot to learn," he's probably right.

There used to be a time when we wouldn't go out in the rain.  In fact, signs of
rain would scare the most fearless scavengers away because wet electronics
isn't that functional.  One day someone thought that drying things before
plugging them in or turning them on might be a solution to the problem of wet
electronics and so our hunts continued through the occasional bad storm.  Not
that it was raining this time around, but this building did have sprinklers.

"You'd think that a bankrupt company couldn't afford to water grass."

"You'd also think that no one ever throws out perfectly good hardware."

"Or still classified materials.  Or plans for the Pentagon.  Or blank airline
tickets.  But then again, you'd think no one would be going through your 
trash!"

There's me, the last voice, and then the two others.  We've been doing this for
awhile and have seen many a different dumpster bottom as we scoured the 
graveyard's of the dotcoms.  Every night through a maze of industrial parks and
business parks, into the heart of the city and down stretches of urban sprawl.
Almost everybody had something interesting in their trash.

And when we found something really interesting, the sort of thing that we had
no use for, but the kind of thing someone would buy.  That's when anyone we
talked to wanted to come along, thinking this was the new way to profit off of
someone's mistakes and time after time, we'd come back empty handed.  That was
one of the first time I considered the dumpster gods.

At first, the idea behind dumpster diving was a science.  Basic concepts of
knowing who was going out of business or moving and waiting for the big green
or blue rollaway to be planted by the loading dock.  Then once the rollaway was
in place, we'd wait for it to fill up and go raid it then repeat the process.
Sometimes we'd go weeks in between a good find and it never made sense why.

The more I thought about it, the more it made sense that there would exist a
collection of deities who rewarded anyone who'd respect the holy places.  The
scavengers that hunted dumpster after dumpster without greed would be the one
who found the biggest piles of golden hardware.  Even in groups that don't
consider the dumpster gods, there are simple rules of ethics and fairness in
scavenging.  The holy ideals of "Leaving things the way you found them,
Taking only what you can use, and Sharing the wealth" when followed promise
downpours of gifts from the dumpster gods.  (Not to say that profit can't be
made.)  Being able to provide for yourself, family, and fellow scanvengers is
something that the dumpster gods want their followers to be able to do.  As
long as societies exist, there will be waste caused by endless greed.  And if
the waste climbs with excess then the religion of dumpster scavengers can only
prosper.  The gods know this, they just want to tell you that you too can be
rewarded by their hand.  Just remember that you aren't the only one out there;
the religion of these gods is one of unity and family with all who share your
experience and knowledge of the dumpsters.

Be prepared to teach those you introduce to the art, and don't fear changing
their mind about the importance of profit.  The idea of free and reuse can be
a thousand times more powerful than the idea of profit.  

Just keep that in mind next time you roll up to a chance at a golden dumpster
and want to stake a claim on it...  It was the will of the gods that you
stumbled upon it.  And I can promise you, a dumpster that goes unshared means
you won't find one like it anytime soon.
