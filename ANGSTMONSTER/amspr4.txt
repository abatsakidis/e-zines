         /\ /\   "Yeah, I don't know what the fuck I am either, but that's not

\/\[____|     |   that war is not cool and you should stop right now!  I mean,
   /\  /\\(OO)/   what's so cool about war?  Do I have to show you a list of

    ____| x x |  hurts to have a list doing the dirty work of talking.  (It
\/\[____|     |  also makes it look like I put more work into things by sorting
   /\  /\\(00)/  them into a list!)  But that's not the point.  The point is 
          \__/   that tfiles are cool.  And I made a list to prove it!"

		             *REASONS TFILES ARE COOL*
                             
                 (Once again, no order)

         /\ /\   "Does anyone ever think about how hard it is to make a list of
    ____| x x |   reasons why tfiles are cool?  I mean it's really easy to go
\/\[____|     |   'Fuck yeah, tfiles 0wn all the bitches!!' but how do we convey
   /\  /\\(OO)/   the idea to the unwashed masses?  I KNOW!!  A LIST THAT PITS
          \__/    WAR AGAINST TFILES!!!!!"
			  
			  *REASONS WHY TFILES 0WN WAR*
                   
                  (0rder 0wns j00!)   

		  Tfiles are all powerful and can start revolutions without a
		    single death
		  No one ever starved while writing or reading a tfile
		  Tfiles do not promote plague, famine, etc (quoting many cDc
		    tfiles: "heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers
		    cast out demons"
		  People who read tfiles eat cookies and cookies are anti-war
		  Tfiles don't have that smelly war smell
		  Tffiles promote freedom of speech
		  When someone stars a new tfile it's cool, when someone starts
		    a new war, it's not cool
		  Tfiles are funny, war is not
		  You never run out of ASCII where as you just might run out of
		    ammo
   		  War sucks and we all know it.
		  
         /\ /\  "Thus at the conclusion of the this tfile we know one thing: war
    ____| x x |  is a stupid waste of time and tfiles are a far more noble
\/\[____|     |  pursuit.  If only some of our world's leaders could learn this
   /\  /\\(00)/  lesson that I have brought to your attention, then perhaps
          \__/   we (nor our children and their children, etc) will not have to
	         witness another war.  At least not until the elite beings from
		 other worlds decide that we must be destroyed.  (because the
		 first thought in every higher beings mind is that we should be
		 destroyed!)  But alas, another story for another time!"
