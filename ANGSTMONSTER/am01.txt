# Blazing Through #
# Another Sort of #
#     Daylight    #
###################

Sometimes tracing the light off of the reflective surface of the cool dawn was
enough to get him excited, but not today.  There was a ring around the moon
again last night and it was just so much bright lush orange that all the power
of the sun couldn't change his feeling toward things anymore.  After the last
couple of nights, with all the rings and odd colors of moonbeams, Paul was glad
he'd been unable to sleep.  Sleep was an afterthought that gave him the 
opportunity to watch the moon and his new rings dance around all night while 
they thought no one was watching.  Because as Paul figured, most people don't 
pay attention to the moon after one in the morning.  It's just a matter of 
when the people around him going to bed so early like he normally did.  
(Sunsets, for the longest time, had been the most important of the celestial 
acts Paul could view.)  But the moon, how he laughed so hardily last night, 
over the music of the stars and atmosphere...
Paul had never seen the sun so happy to be dancing in the sky.  In fact the
sun seemed more prudish than the moon, but that was just Paul's view of things.
For some reason, the aged jolliness of the moon was like that of an Italian 
man, if Santa Claus was Italian and made of cheese, he'd be the moon every day
that isn't Christmas.  That wasn't enough to describe the moon though, not last
night.  Imagine the most wonderful moments of your life all compacted into a
bright light that spun around you to a rhythm that was bigger than you, more
amazing and potent than your existence and all those bright light great
moments began to pulse around you to the beat of some celestial song that was
hummed by lips that stirred the greatness of creation with a flick of a wrist
and a need to see more use put out of the nothing that was before all of you.
The aged memories are specks of little bits of the fondest and the worst times
but the potent ones, they pulse the loudest when the revolutions cross your
eyes.  The sorts of things that alter your life forever but no one ever knows
why.  As those moments pulse and flicker their encoded memories across your
eyes, you smile like Paul smiles because after an experience like this Paul
hasn't been to sleep in weeks...

The following is a recipe my mom found in some really old cookbook of a long
since passed relative of long ago. These cookies are really good and if you are
a big fan of the chocolate and the chip, I suggest you make some for yourself.
(Or find a loved one to make some for you.)

1 c. plus 2 Tbsp. all-purpose flour		½ tsp. baking soda
½ tsp salt					½ tsp. hot water
½ c. shortening					½ tsp. vanilla flavoring
6 Tbsp. sugar					1 (6 oz.) package semi-sweet
6 Tbsp. dark brown sugar				chocolate pieces
1 egg

Heat oven to 375°.  Sift flour with salt.  Work shortening with spoon until
creamy.  Add sugar slowly continuing to work until light.  Beat eggs and add to
mixture.  Add flour mixture alternately with soda dissolved in hot watter.  Add
vanilla.  Fold in chocolate.  Add by rounded teaspoon 2-inches apart on greased
cookie sheets.  Bake in moderately hot oven at 375° for 10 to 12 minutes or
until done.  This recipe works well when doubled!

(to the tune of the Dead Kennedy's "Stealing People's Mail")

We got ourselves a yaggi
We just installed kismet
We got ourselves a cisco
But is your WAP encrypted?

We're Sniffing WiFi Traffic
sniffing Wifi Traffic
sniffing Wifi Traffic
On a friday night

WarDriving in the city
Spotting linksys after linksys
Still set to the default
For anyone to 0wn

And we found ISPs, grocery stores, retail chains
Connections to DSL, T-1's and 0C3's
Logins, passwords, and mail spools
What you bought at the book store

We're gonna sniff your Wifi Traffic
On a Friday night
We're gonna sniff your Wifi Traffic
Under the city lights

We got tcpdump after tcpdump
After tcpdump after tcpdump
After tcpdump after tcpdump
Of the private lives of you
Ha Ha!

People say that we're criminals
We're just curious
But when we spot your network
We're rolling on the floor

And we found ISPs, grocery stores, retail chains
Connections to DSL, T-1's and 0C3's
Logins, passwords, and mail spools
What you bought at the book store

We're gonna sniff your Wifi Traffic
On a Friday night
We're gonna sniff your Wifi Traffic
Under the city lights

And when it's done
We'll mark our favorite spots
And Dump it to MapQuest
To share with our friends
Next Friday, we'll do it all again!
