------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Dolphin leaps from the water and high in to the air. It does a somersault 
and splashes down into the water. A wave spurts from the pool and soaks the 
front row of the audience. Applause and whistles ring out from the crowd 
gathered in the coliseum to watch the show. 

Steve, Sabre, Saviour and Yoshimi are sat in a row, watching the dolphin 
show.

"I haven't been to a zoo since I was a kid," says Sabre.

"You haven't had the pleasure of taking youngsters on day trips then," 
replies Savior.

"Who are we looking at?" asks Yoshimi.

"The trainer," answers Steve. "Apparently he has some kind of connection with 
his animals."

"How's that going to help us?" queries Sabre.

"You never know when your going to need an elephant," says Steve. "besides 
it's better to have them with us than against us."

The trainer gets into the pool. He swims into the middle of the pool and 
gets onto a floating platform in the middle. It has an elevated seat on it, 
which the trainer climbs on to. One of the dolphins starts to swim around 
the edges of the pool. The trainer jumps from the chair. As he drops towards 
the water the dolphin swims underneath him and catches the trainer before he 
hits the pool. The crowd clap. 

The trainer climbs off of the back of the dolphin and on to the side of the 
pool. He waves to the crowd. The crowd stand and applaud. He waves again 
and walks away.  The crowd stand from their seats and begin to leave. Steve, 
Sabre, Saviour and Yoshimi are still sat in their seats. They wait for the 
crowd to leave.

"Who wants to talk to him?" asks Steve.

None of them answer.

"I'll do it," says Yoshimi.

She gets up from her seat. Sabre and Saviour follow. Steve stays sat in his 
seat. He watches as the others walk down the terraced stand.

The trainer is walking around the area where the dolphins are kept. They 
are in huge pools. A walkway goes down the centre of the pools and he walks 
along it with a bucket of fish. He throws the fish to the dolphins.

"Sorry, but my friends have to eat," says The Keeper.

He empties the bucket into the pool then sits down on the walkway.

Steve leans back on his seat. Ghost sits down next to him. A cleaner mops 
the poolside. They are the only people there. 

"You look happy," she says.

"I don't know about happy, relaxed, relaxed maybe," replies Steve.

"You wouldn't say you where happy anyway."

"Well you tell me. Am I happy? If anyone knows..."

"I don't know. I'm not a mind reader. I said you look happy. Are you?"

"I suppose so. Thank you."

"You're welcome."

They sit next to each other and look out at the pool.

Yoshimi steps on to the walkway. It sways beneath her. The Keeper remains 
sat on the walkway. He looks up at Yoshimi and sneers at her. Yoshimi steps 
closer.

"Go away," snarls the Keeper.

"You don't know what I have to say," says Yoshimi.

"I don't care."

"Will he join?" asks Ghost.

"I doubt it," replies Steve, "but it doesn't matter."

Steve stretches out his arms and stands up.

"He only needs to be made aware of the situation. When he is ready he 
will join. All he needs is the correct motivation."

"Are you going to provide it?" asks Ghost.

"You know me better than that. I'm not going to bribe someone into fighting 
for their freedom. They must want to do it."

Steve walks towards the exit. Ghost walks with him.

The Keeper has stood up. He is walking away from Yoshimi, his back to 
her.

"We know that you are special," she says.

"I told you to leave me alone."

The Keeper is off of the walkway now. He stands at pool side. 

"You have the ability to help others," says Yoshimi, "Help us."

"Why would I want to help you? No one helps me."

The dolphins have gathered around the walkway. They are watching Yoshimi.

Sabre and Saviour are stood at the exit of the stadium. Steve approaches 
them.

"Here comes our glorious leader," laughs Sabre.

"You'd better believe it," replies Steve, "How's Yoshimi doing?"

"I've no idea," answers Sabre.

Yoshimi walks along the walkway towards Keeper. 

"Stay away from me," he says.

Yoshimi continues towards Keeper. Suddenly the walkway tips over. Two of 
the dolphins push it over and Yoshimi topples into the pool. The dolphins 
circle her as she treads water. One of the dolphins swims at her at speed, 
ramming into her. Yoshimi sinks into the water. The dolphins circle her 
again and one of them begins to charge her. Before it can ram her again 
she is lifted out of the water and into the air above the pool. Steve is 
stood at the poolside, he lowers Yoshimi from the air and sets her down 
next to him. She lays on the ground spluttering.

"You are not the only with special abilities Keeper," says Steve, "let me 
show you."

Steve connects into Keeper's mind. He sees Keeper with the dolphins and 
then with other animals. Keeper is sat at home on his own, the room is 
lit by a single bulb and it casts shadows over Keeper. Steve shows Keeper 
his mind and his experiences. The battles with Milton, their clash outside 
the bank. Saviour healing his wounds. Yoshimi seeing her troops die 
before her eyes. The plane exploding into a thousand pieces. The Teezer 
destroying earth. The formation of the resistance with Steve as their 
leader.

"Help us," pleads Steve.

Steve breaks off the psychic link. He and the Keeper stand with their eyes 
fixed on each other. Keeper's empty unblinking eyes don't break off from Steve.

"I told your friend I don't care. Nothing you do will change my mind," says 
Keeper.

Keeper pushes his way past Steve and away from the poolside. Steve watches 
him walk away.

"You can't win them all," he says.

Ghost has appeared at his side.

"You can," she says "and you will. There will come a time when everyone wants 
to join."

"They won't just want to," says Steve, "They will all need to."
