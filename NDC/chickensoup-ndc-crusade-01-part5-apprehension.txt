------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The table collapses as Sabre's body crashes through it. A bell rings and 
Sabre lays in bloody mess. The referee lifts the hand of a hulking brute of 
a man proclaiming him the victor. Sabre still hasn't moved.

"Son of a..." moans Sabre.

Sabre is sat in the medical area backstage. A doctor is treating his 
injuries. Sabre winces.

There is a bang on the door.

"Come in."

Saviour enters the room. He looks at Sabre then at the doctor.

"Do you want me to take over?" Saviour asks.

Sabre grimaces.

"Please," hisses Sabre.

The doctor doesn't look pleased, he snatches his equipment and storms out. 
Saviour takes off the bandaging, revealing the wound.

"That's a nasty boo-boo," says Saviour.

Sabre laughs.

"Just get on with it will you."

A single light bulb offers the only light in a dim room.  Sat in an armchair 
is Steve, he is deep in thought. Sat in the chair opposite is Ghost.

"What's on your mind?" she asks.

"I'm just wondering what I'm doing. I have a group of people following me, 
but I don't know where I'm going."

"You are trying to stop Milton."

"Why? Is he really so bad? All he wants is some money, he wants to be able 
to make his creations."

"Yes, but his creations are dangerous and that money belongs to people who 
have worked hard for it."

"Is that enough of a reason for us to fight a war across this city? Causing 
damage and endangering people who have nothing to do with this feud. Surely 
I, we, could do something more constructive."

A large warehouse in the middle of nowhere is a hub of activity. A production 
line rolls off robot after soulless robot. Milton walks past the production 
line in discussion with a man in a lab coat. The man holds a gun in his hand, 
he hands it to Milton.

"When will they be ready?" enquires Milton.

"Two days."

"Good. We are almost ready."

Milton leaves the warehouse floor, climbing the stairs to the offices that 
oversee the work place. 

Milton opens the door and sat inside is The Inquisitor dressed in black and 
red, a cloak concealing his features. Milton hurriedly closes the door and 
pulls the blinds down.

Sabre flexes his arm. He throws a couple of punches, testing his arm.

"How does that feel?"

"Like the table never happened."

Sabre does some more working out. High kicks, chops, leg sweeps and more 
punches. He gets a good sweat on and then stops. Saviour hasn't been watching 
Sabre, his eyes have been fixed out of the window.

"Saviour."

There's no response.

"Saviour."

Saviour breaks out of his trance like state and looks at Sabre.

"Is there something on your mind?" asks Sabre.

"What did you think of Yoshimi?"

"What are you doing here?" Milton stares at the Inquisitor. The Inquisitor 
hasn't moved. He doesn't move, he doesn't respond. The longer Inquisitor sits 
still, the more nervous Milton becomes. He finally speaks.

"You are failing."

"My operation has been successful thus far. I have a high ratio of 
victories and the factory is thriving. How can I be failing?"

The Inquisitor stands up and prowls around the room.

"You are taking too long. Victories are not important, defeats are not 
important. Infamy. The world must know and fear you. Fear your technology. 
No one can be safe."

Steve is pouring himself a whisky. The clear brown liquid passing from bottle 
to glass to lips with rapid speed.

"You shouldn't do that," says the Ghost.

"Why not? Tell me what I should do instead. Tell me."

"You should be alert and primed for your next challenge. You should keep an 
eye on your team who you've let do as they please."

"I am not a prison warden. They are people, with lives. I know what they are 
doing and I can contact them."

Steve pours another drink. He starts to put it to his lips.

"Any more of that and even your powers won't be able to contact any one."

Steve picks up the phone.

"Who needs powers when we have mobile phones."

Steve puts the phone down and downs the whisky.

Sabre sits down next to Saviour. He scratches his head.

"I'm not sure. I only met Yoshimi the once. We didn't really talk, so I don't 
know," says Sabre.

"You must have some opinion. I'd like to hear it."
Sabre squirms in his seat.

"She, she was, very brave and bold. She was a strong woman. I know she turned 
down the opportunity to join us. The fact Steve asked her means that he must 
think highly of her."

Saviour gets up and looks out of the window.

"What about, other things."

"Such as?"

"Did you find her attractive?"

"She was a good looking woman. Did you find her attractive?"
Saviour turns and looks at Sabre.

"I haven't stopped thinking about her since I scooped her up in my arms 
and carried her across the river."

The Inquisitor holds a laser canon in his hands examining it. He runs his 
hand along the weapon then points it at Milton and holds it there for a few 
seconds. He lowers the weapon.

"You must ready yourself and the your creations create for an act of supreme 
violence. An act that gets the worlds attention." 

Milton looks pensive.

"What do you want me to do?"
