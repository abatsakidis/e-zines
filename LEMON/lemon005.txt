                      lem0n issue five: the new conspiracy

::[juke's editorial]::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

well, it's been like a month (or more) since the last issue of lemon and ob and
i have done, well, nothing. it's not that we didn't want to do lemon, we just
haven't had time. but thanks to good old chris columbus, lemon lives on! since
this is an editorial, i think i'll comment on a few items.

well, first off, i just wanted to say how much the zine scene seems to be
growing and how mature the people seem to stay even though the scene is getting
bigger. as most people have noticed, this didn't happen with the art scene. i
guess this _should_ be expected because most of the people in the zine scene
i would rank in the "intellectual" class. and to me intellectual equals mature.
anyways, i keep finding more and more zines as i look around on irc or the web.
although they may look like a pez ripoff, that's not all bad. as long as the
writing is good, i don't see the problem. plus, this is the easiest way to get
your stuff out there. no annoying, time consuming coding to get in your way.
just type and your done. if for some reason you only read lem0n (i don't know
why, maybe you just love ob and i), call up the zine board closest to you and
check out some other ones. check 'em all out, actually.

::[comic books]:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

comic books. yea, you know, those things d00dle boys copy from for 99% of their
ANSi's. but juke here actually reads them and enjoys them for their story. but
the thing is juke doesn't like the stories anymore. when you get up to 40o and
something issues of spiderman and decide to tell juke that you are starting over
with a number one issue with a totally differant spiderman, he isn't going to be
too happy.

wait. i can't take this third person angle anymore.

continuing with the story:

it seems marvel comics is starting over with issue one with their long run
series amazing spider man with a totally differant spiderman that THEY claim to
be the _real_ spiderman. now, i know according to spiderman continuity this
scarlet spider guy is the real spiderman. but to someone who has read spiderman
all of his life, he is not going to be the real spiderman. atleast with the
x-men the switching of timelines and characters was just part of a storyline and
the books were going to return normal after four issues.

oh well, it seems the only good books anymore are not put out by any of the
big guys. juke recommends:

metaphysique (this *is* my favorite comic. norm breyfogle r0x)
bone
spawn (ok, not great. i don't think i could drop this even if i wanted to)
wildc.a.t.s (no really, better than the x-men)
sin city
and too-much-coffee man (this is s0o cool!@)

::[issue five value meal]:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

the mcdonalds value meal for issue five is:

the 2-sausage mcmuffin meal.

this is a *great* deal. for 2.98 plus tax (3.17 total here in illinois) you get:

of course the two sausage mcmuffin's
but you also get:

1-hashbrown
and a medium drink (dr. pepper would be juke's choice)

now if you got all of these seperatly the cost would be:

about 2.50 for the sausage muffin's
1.00 or so for the drink
and like .75 for the hashbrown

bring the amount saved to about $1.25 or so.

::[random comments]:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

we now have more issues than blues traveler albums

i now am in the possesion of a picture of a really fat guy holding a wheel
barrel

people who actually pay money for copies of live blues traveler shows are morons

one of the few alternative bands i like are coming out with a new album october
24th

and i'm about to kill half of my novel's class. thank God college is only 11
months away. oh wait, that's along time.

::[jams]::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

jam session (n): an impromptu performance by musicians

there's something about going to a concert and listening to a band play on and
on that makes me feel like i got my money's worth. to me, there's a differance
between playing songs and jamming. when you go see your basic alternative
bands, they stand up there and play their songs straight from the album. but
when you go see bands like the black crowes, blues traveler or phish you see
the band get into the music. every show will be differant because you know
there really isn't a set version of any song. yea, a song may be on a studio
album, but when you go to the show, that isn't what you are going to hear. you
are going to hear what the band is feeling that night, because these bands
actually put their heart behind their music. i'm not saying other bands don't.
it's just harder to tell. oh well, maybe it's just me.

::[misc stuff]::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

ob should be back. he never was really gone, it's just that i wanted to release
a new issue right now, and he wasn't around.

if you wanna submit to lemon. actually, you do want to submit to lemon. so go
ahead and send that submission to me at:

owilliam@ice.net

or to ob at:

danderson@ice.net

or you can call the lemon whq and a dang good zine board:

the repented gimcrackery ^ 1.309.452.5639
oP: juke

oh yeah, if anything offended anyone (i don't think anything could in this
issue, unless you just *LOVE* the new scarlet spider guy), it doesn't matter. i
can say anything i want really.

greetings to anyone i have chatted with on #zines.

carpe diem people

issue five released on 10.9.95
