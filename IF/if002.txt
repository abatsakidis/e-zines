Integral Functions is an electronic 'zine that covers a broad range of
obscure and experimental topics. Material within the magazine includes:
poetry, short stories, essays, rants, reviews (books, movies and music),
experimental literature (computer generated poetry, etc.), personal
philosophies, chat logs, e-mail, and ASCII artwork. Topics within each
issue are diverse and will change from one issue to the next.

{get INTRO002.TXT}

   Here's the second issue, and we still aren't available through FTP on
the Net.  Certain things are going slow, while other things are moving
fast, which causes some of these things to miss each other.  Being on the
Net does not necessarily mean that we will have more readers, but it does
mean that we will be lost among the large amount of other useless
information/shit/whatever floating around out there.  I'm not saying that
the content of this 'zine consists of shit - don't take it the wrong way.

   The content of this 'zine will not lead to world peace, the formation
of a world-wide energy network grid, or anything like that.  This is not
our goal.

   No matter what you do, you are going to offend someone.  Sometimes it's
better to offend as many people as possible.  Now I'm rambling: make me
stop.

** The Education System: Quotes & Random Notes


   The following pair of quotes are from _Critical Path_, by R. Buckminster
Fuller (St. Martin's Press, 1981).


** Quote #1:

      "Comprehensively and incisively programmed with all the relevant
   data regarding education, it will be evidenced that the physical and
   social costs will be far less for individual, at-home-initiated,
   research-and-development-interned self-teaching than having individual
   students going to schools, being bused, and so on. This mass-production
   baby-sitting is only continued because of the union-organized response
   to the fear of the teacher about losing their jobs. Their political
   clout has for long been strong enough to guarantee continuance of this
   inefficiency to the present moment.
      "The computer will make it clear that by far the most effective
   education system for human beings -- all the way from birth through
   early childhood and on -- is that to be derived from the home video
   cassette system and its supporting books, the pages of which are also to
   be called forth on world satellite-interlinked video 'library' screens
   as published in any language."

** Quote #2:

      "We may soon discover that all babies are born geniuses and only
   become degeniused by the erosive effects of unthinkingly maintained
   false assumptions of the grown-ups, with their conventional ways of
   'bringing-up' and 'educating' their young. We know know that schools are
   the least favorable environment for learning. The home TV is far more
   effective, but we are allowing the big money-making advertisers to
   poison the information children assimilate in their four to five hours a
   day of spontaneous turning-on, looking at and listening to the TV."


** Random Notes:

   In the past few years, it has been increasingly possible to
self-educate oneself, both through the growth of the Net, and the sudden
appearance of specialized cable television channels. Post-secondary
courses can be taught through the Net, people can search the Web and
educate themselves on almost any topic, no matter how obscure (or illegal)
it may be. The world has become decentralized, more people are working
from home, and starting their own businesses, and these small businesses
are coming in competition with local corporations. Many of these people
that work from home are spending more time working than those that do not,
because they never leave the work space. Information has become a product:
every individual has information, but how many are willing to sell
themselves?  Mental prostitution. Decentralization: fewer people are a
part of 'something big', and feel unimportant. These small information
salespeople have a smaller amount of specialized customers. The quality of
the current education system has declined, more people are teaching
themselves, researching and studying topics that interest them. People
will not need diplomas or degrees to prove how intelligent they are: the
line between 'lamer' and 'elite' will be destroyed, people must rely on
their individual thoughts and actions to prove their worth. Today, the
education system is taught in 'grades' each one more difficult that the
previous, learning general knowledge. People will abandon this system and
turn to apprenticeship and specialization, or something like that.

   "Duet #1: Humans & Machines Write Poetry...Together(?)"
   (by GH, AB, and a machine)


   This is a slight continuation of the essay I submitted for the first
   issue of Integral Functions, entitled 'Algorithmic Humanity Departure:
   An Isolated Experiment'.  However, the two poems that follow have been
   created through a collaboration between humans and machines, rather
   than a purely machine-generated poem as in my previous essay.  I will
   not discuss the social/artistic issues that arise from this experiment.

   The poems were created in the following manner:  A computer program
   generated a 100 word paragraph from it's vocabulary, and saved it to
   a text file, then the text was reformatted and edited by Astrix Beauton,
   in order to make it more legible (punctuation and words such as 'the'
   and 'a' where added).  It is easy to see that the poems remain
   consistent with Astrix's individual style of writing, in both structure
   and subject matter.  The final poem arrives at slightly less than
   100 words.

   For my next experiment, I would like to reverse this process by having
   a human-generated poem fed into a computer program, edited, and
   completed.  I would like to sincerely thank Astrix Beauton for her
   participation in this experiment.

   ---

   'gloomy cheat'

   he pushed the offended crab (grinning from
   ear to elbow) behind his impatient bulldozer;
   aroused me for a year as something rustled in
   his pants.
   an interface labelled 'gloomy cheat' simmered
   and decided to become active.
   she (magnificent) and i changed address; she
   appealed my banana; struggled with it; dragged
   it out when it reduced.
   her oyster was so comfortable and rough, both
   at once? impossible.
   we built puzzles (at the satisFACTORY) for
   starving children: he, she and i.  we flushed.
   what was that interface there?  it got
   bulldozed.
   
   ---

   'enquired'

   the soldiers, and their sultry guns,
   ejaculated on the blondes: sagging bagpipes;
   if it were a photograph, it would be porn,
   if it were a painting, it would be art.  what
   kind of draggle would paint such a future?
   image frozen: the blondes gasping; the
   disturbing punishment made divine.  dust and
   sand on their thighs.  who wants to suffer?
   european = sympathetic; american =
   sensationalizationalized.  rumbling, we, i
   and she attacked with fury, scolding the
   observers.


   {Editor's Note: Astrix Beauton has solo poems in this both this and
    the previous issue of Integral Functions.}

"Take a Hint: Chatlog #1"


<open chatlog1.dat>

Chi2: I doubt it.

ZOE!: I could be, but I am admitting my feelings toward you, and trying to
ZOE!: act on them. I have a feeling that you're not taking me seriously.

Chi2: I'm not.

ZOE!: You should be.

Chi2: Well, I can't.

ZOE!: Why?

Chi2: Why should I?! Why should I take anything seriously?

ZOE!: Because I mean what I say when I say it. I think we have known each
ZOE!: other long enough, and I'm sure of what I want, and I know you're
ZOE!: sure of what you want.

Chi2: What a minute. What where you saying the last time we talked?

ZOE!: About relationships?

Chi2: Yeah. What were your feelings towards me then?  Am I stupid for not
Chi2: remembering?

ZOE!: No, not at all. I suppose to anyone what I said could have been               
ZOE!: misunderstood. I tried to make it subtle - perhaps too much so.
ZOE!: We were talking about how much we both did and didn't have in
ZOE!: common.  Do you remember now?

Chi2: Yes, but I don't remember picking up and definite feelings from you
Chi2: or anything.  I think you should just say what you are trying to
Chi2: say to me, and get it over with.

ZOE!: I thought I just did!

Chi2: Maybe i thought you were joking somewhere...or being sarcastic.

ZOE!: No, what I have been saying was kind of jokingly, but not entirely.
ZOE!: Tell me what you want.

Chi2: What I want?! From what?

ZOE!: From me...from THIS!!

Chi2: I don't know.  I just want a short answer as to what you are trying
Chi2: to say.  As for THIS...

ZOE!: Not THIS...this...this whole thing.

Chi2: That's what I meant...THIS. Like, us?

ZOE!: Yes! That's it.

Chi2: Well, I don't know. I'm not looking for a physical relationship if
Chi2: that's what you mean.

ZOE!: No, not really, but what develops from whatever you wish to call it
ZOE!: just happens.

Chi2: Yeah. I understand that. Ok...WHAT do YOU want though?

ZOE!: I don't know how to put it into words...I don't know. I don't have
ZOE!: anything against a physical relationship as you already know, but you
ZOE!: also know that's not nearly the most important aspect of a
ZOE!: relationship. At least to me.

Chi2: Ok ok...so, you want THIS relationship to go further?

ZOE!: I HOPE by now I have made that clear...but its up to you 100%.

Chi2: Ok ok....you've made it clear, it's just the way you've gone about
Chi2: saying it wasn't very good.

ZOE!: Yeah, I know.

Chi2: I don't know what I feel right now.  I could just tell you to FUCK
Chi2: OFF, but...I wouldn't do that.

ZOE!: That makes me feel so much better.  :)

Chi2: Good. So...what now?

ZOE!: I have no idea.

Chi2: Likewise.

ZOE!: Hmm. Ok then. 

Chi2: Yeah.

ZOE!: Well, keep thinking, and I'll TTYL.

  'c/3'
  (source unknown)


   The  Chocolate  Chip Croissant [hereinafter refered to  as
  `c/3'] resides,  splend'drous, in state as it were, an aura
  of piquant expectancy filling the otherwise bleak landscape
  with  a  tenuous  veil  of  diffuse  rococco  blandishments
  reminscent  of a bygone Dali.  Ruffling through  the  Power
  Grass,  bleating  Vaughn  Williams anthems to  Itself,  The
  Sinuoid wreathes obliquely betwixt the ant-eaten AM-PM Mini
  Market  soft-serve ice cream cone and the  nether  buttress
  upon seven of the like to which, the C/3 expresses inertia.
  To  nothing in Particular,  a Voice as a flocculent  zephyr
  rises  like  heat on a New Mexico  highway,  mingling  with
  distorted   gospel  cassettes  and  the  plaintive  honking
  burbles  of  Carlos "Spit-Key"  Ayrton-Plinth,  baring  the
  naked   soul  of  his  Selmer  alto  saxophone   upon   the
  discriminate ear of the desert floor. "Spuck" It says.

{=========================================================================}

A Smack in the Face.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Should I write this?
	-No.. People will think this is stupid.
Really? I mean.. I want to do this.
	-So? Its stupid. People don't want to read this.
Well.. Tough.
	-Okay. Your call.

	I am a green teenager. No, not one of many colours. There is nothing
I excell in, and I have friends - not many, but enough. Often I find myself
having in-depth conversations with myself. How? (you may ask) That isn't
for you to understand. We all do, ask yourself. Today, while REMiniscing of
past guns and alter egos, I was shocked by the spike of reality. Upon my
arrival, I lit up a cigarette. I said no, but I did it anyways. Later, I
turned things around me upside-down. Yes. I moved my brain from happyland
to cartoonland. Is this possible? (you may ask) Yes. Come to my abode.
Later, I was caught speaking to someone I care about, yet not enough. How?
(you may ask) Simple. Ask father bell. However, I just arrived to my
personal space from another cartoon, taken by Peanuts. From whence I
arrived, I chatted with the voices in my head, and now I am sitting in my
personal box, which I created.

I think this is stupid.
	-No. Its cool. Don't give me a hard time.

	You may wonder what that is. I can't tell you. Its a spark in my grey
matter, helping me along the way. Name? It doesn't have one. Label? Yes.
We all have one. As I was saying before I most rudely interrupted myself, I
was speaking along the lines of what it was today that I achived. Nothing,
really. In the grand scheme of things. You don't care. They don't care. Its
time to be the lemming. Leap of faith. Here I come.

        _the creamy continent (yeah) of the self_
        (by Astrix Beauton)


        i escape, placing myself into a self-imposed estrangement
        machine.  this machine, and it's propellers take me to
        places that i should
        have been several weeks ago.  (landing gears; engine
        slowly cooling; heads-up-display; checking the inventory)
        from a latex backpack, another machine slowly emerges,
        and assembles itself, as if it were a device
        from one of the old jetsons cartoon$ (do you know
        what i mean?).  it attaches itself to the earths' crust,
        the same way
        the legs of a frightened dragonfly attach
        themselves to your (50% cotton; 50% polyester) sleeeeve
        (let me know if i am using too many metaphors here, ok?).
        what this machine does, is.. is.. it impregnates the earth
        with its thick, immeasurable steel penis (feel free to
        make your own lewd associations - i don't give a shit.),
        and shakes the land (diameter area of effect:
        approx. 125km) with a monstrous ejaculation of motivation.
        the shattering orgasms that result cause sudden fissures
        of pleasure to erupt
        from deep deep deep under the ocean skin, releasing
        molten cream (millions upon millions of cubic centimeters
        of joy) from the mothers' core.  the gunk quickly
        accumulates, forming a sort of.. sub-aqua anthill.  (cont-
        inuing, continuing, continuing!)  molten goo hardens,
        into layers, eventually breaking the ocean skin, creating
        an island of heat and soot - where life soon blooms.
        my home is there (or here?  i often forget which tense i
        am currently inhabiting), where i watch
        new organisms (orgasms) evolve in such ways that would
        make darwin blush, and perhaps piss himself.  you
        aren't welcome,
        here on the continent of the (my) self, but - if you ask
        nicely - you can borrow my machines sometime.  (end)

Hey!!!!!
i wuz like.. reading this.. thing.

{get LASTW002.TXT}

   Ok, this is good.  I am very pleased with this issue, and the sub-
missions that were sent in.  If I knew that putting together an e-zine was
so easy, I would have done it sooner.  The most difficult part is getting
people to actually read it - you can't force anyone to do this, and it
isn't guaranteed that anyone will discover the 'zine (wherever you put it).

   "Introduction" and "Last Words" by the Editor will be deleted in issue
#003 and on.  I don't think that it is necessary for me to say anything,
other than to report on what is going in the next issue, like this (I tend
to ramble too):

   Next/upcoming issue (probabilities): neuro-recipes; an encoded COM file;
more machine poetry by GH; other poetry + experimental prose.

   Issue #003 will be released around February 14th (hug'n'kiss day).
