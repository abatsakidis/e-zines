   Into the Sea of Absurdity
   (anonymous)


   Jasper stood in front of the door, waiting his turn. "It should be
soon," he thought to himself. He was very nervous.  Large, cold beads of
sweat had begun to run down the side of his arms, distracting him from what
was important. His mind began to wander. "Why must people stink? What
biological purpose does it serve?  Humans have no need to stink. We should
smell nice, like flowers, like rocks..."
   Footsteps could be heard approaching from the other side of the door,
but not loud enough to snap Jasper out of his daze. He continued to ponder
and ramble to himself. "...men.  Women should smell like flowers. Each
one would smell different. The men would all smell the same, but their
skins would have the colour and texture of rock. If two men tried to
pollinate each other, their rubbing would cause each of them to crumble
into sand. They would wash away, into the Sea of Absurdity..."
   A sudden knock at the door pulled Jasper from his daze, filling him with
overwhelming delight. He straightened up, his eyes peering down over his
smile, waiting for the slot to appear. Something from the other side
whistled, then spoke. "Injection 78-D," it said.
   Jasper watched, his brain giggling in anticipation, as the slot appeared.
It came into existence a few feet up from the bottom of the door, just large
enough for the hypodermic erection to poke through, its tip dribbling
slightly onto Jasper's toes. It waited there for a moment, as if unsure of
itself, then plunged into Jasper's thigh, ejaculating all its chemically
engineered joy into his starved body. The needle quickly withdrew, taking
the slot and the footsteps with it.
   Collapsing on the floor, Jasper spread himself out on his back, the cold
concrete pressing against his back. He waited for the substance to fully
circulate through his blood, mumbling to the ceiling above, which seemed to
press down on him, like an angry father. "...into sand, into the sea."
   Suddenly, from the other side of the door, Jasper heard waves, their sighs
increasing in volume, as if a tide were coming in. He pulled his body from
the floor and staggered to the bed as the waves began to crash violently
against the door, which creaked under the strain of what approached.
Darkness began to leak in from the bottom and sides of the door, covering
the floor and walls in black. It filled the room, eventually lifting the
bed on which Jasper clung, until it capsized, tossing Jasper into the
Darkness, drowning him, depriving him of all sense.
   "It's as if I have become Nothing," Jasper said, speaking not to
himself, but to the Darkness which had engulfed him.
   "It's as if you are an aroma," the Darkness added, "dissipating
throughout me, for everyone to inhale. It's as if you are ethereal emotion."
   "Yes, like an aroma. What do I smell like?"
   "Like a flower. Like a Jasper Rose, searching for the sunlight on which
you thrive."
   Jasper became worried. He wanted to find the sun, but his search was
futile in a world that had no Form or Direction. He felt as if he really
were dissipating, as if any physical part of him that remained were
separating into individual atoms, spreading out into Nothing. "What will
become of me, if not a flower?" he asked.
   "You will become rain."
   "And what shall I rain upon?"
   "You can rain upon the flowers, or upon the rocks, but it won't make a
difference, because you will eventually wash into the Sea of Absurdity."
   "Is there no hope for me?"
   "What good is hope, in a world where everything has already been decided
for you?"
   As Form returned, Jasper could hear the waves at the shore, beating
against the rocks, soaked up by the soil that surrounded them. He watched
the Sea swallow the mountains, and submerge the flowers, as if he were
looking at the inundation of his soul.

Selected Poems: April 21 - April 26, 1996
(by Gideon Hartwell)


The following (seven) poems are not computer generated.  Each poem is
numbered, and seperated from the next poem by a series of dashes ("-----").


ONE.

slow, medium, fast: 1939-1945 (revised)


lips/eyes dry rolling
back into
head suck at the [appropriate]
behind those lids
dried grit dust rubbing
where have her tears
washed away (my congeniality)
no longer
compatible/combat-able
all my big guns have gone limp
morale depleted
little soldiers sending postcards
home, wives purchasing
replacements (by mail-order)
they take two
batteries, and have three
optional speed settings.
it
usually remains in the drawer
unless she is feeling particularly
adventurous (having the ladies
over for tea and libido)
afterwards they feel guilt with-
out regret.

-----

TWO.

innerpounce
(written to be spoken)


some several more some
yes oh, you know, like more
several come
dressed with a slit, whore

seeing at that with shining
forebrow, swept towards back
helmet gleaming
nails going: 'clickety-

clack,
clickety-smack'

several more come, yes oh,
you know, with a slit
we go, oh,
i want to quit.

-----

THREE.

we have this season


tomorrow tomorrow will
be halloween when santa
comes down
from trees wearing
loincloth chases
little boys,
eyeing crotches
hoping to get under
sheets with few pseudo-
ghosts (if you know
what i mean)
while the easter
bunny crucified as they
dance around setting
fires wrapping country-
sides in toilet paper,
later we arm our
steeltoes and bust
few ribs making
handsome amount (lust)
money all along way
our windows decorated
with eggs and strings
of lights as if a
sign or target
hit anyway inverted
cars drooping stop-signs
our name written in
urine

-----

FOUR.

sun stroke


argument swelled to unpredictable
lengths,
        fists clenched
in contempt,
            withheld blood painted
            a morose embroidery of
            deoxygenated

buttered up when flustered, his sun
too bright, her skin too sensitive

     curled emotions rubbed against
     serrated (boiling)

she came back to taste his lips
one time too many.

blinded,
collapsed, he is her cancer.

-----

FIVE.

making her purr


i subdued that distressed french girl,
who refused to ponder the conundrum
of my existance
               instead, my lap become
               a pillow,

               her head a cat.

-----

SIX.

swift accident


grazed
and the american
the smell rumbling the
wire grabbed and
radioactive radio and
she healthy beheaded
whispered

-----

SEVEN.

bomb logic


streamlined fixed sight (at it)
she nodded, her serpent dress swelling
in its tastlessness (me astonished
at her sudden initiative) her
rigid laughter was the largest
explosion (making me feel like a pawn)

      The Sex Life of an Electron
           (source unknown)

      One night when his charge was at full capacity, Micro Farad
 decided to get a cute little coil to discharge him.  He picked
 up Millie Amp and took her for a ride on his Megacycle.  They
 rode across the Wheatstone bridge, around the Sine Wave, and
 into the magnetic field next to the flowing current.

      Micro Farad attracted by Millie's characteristic curve,
 soon had her field fully excited.  He laid her on the ground
 potential, raised her frequency, lowered her resistance, and
 pulled out his high voltage probe.  He inserted it in parallel
 and began to short circuit her shunt.  Fully excited, Millie
 cried out, "Ohm. Ohm! Give me mho!"

      With his tube at maximum output and her coil vibrating from
 the current flow, her shunt soon reached maximum heat.  The
 excessive current had shorted her shunt, and Micro's capacity was
 rapidly discharged, and every electron was drained off.  They
 fluxed all night trying various connections and hookings until his
 bar magnet had lost all of its strength, and he could no longer
 generate enough voltage to sustain his collapsing field.  With
 his battery fully discharged, Micro was unable to excite his
 tickler, so they ended up reversing polarity and blowing each
 others' fuses.

CHAT-075.LOG


Introduction
------------

The following is a chat that was saved to file between the SysOp of
Mindflux BBS and a user that paged him.  How this file was attained, and
who came into possession of it will not be revealed.  The conversation
begins as the SysOp answers the page by the user.  The file is in typical
linear chat program format, each paragraph alternating between speakers.
It is easy to tell who is speaking by the way each of the two speakers
types.  The gender of the two speakers is not confirmed, although it is
assumed (and highly probable) that both are male.  Enjoy!  :)


User Paged Sysop at 08:17p March 25 1996
----------------------------------------
C:\TABBS\LOG\CHAT-075.LOG Open (08:17p)
----------------------------------------

hi...you paged me?

Yeah.

so...ummm...what do you want?

Just to chat.  You aren't busy or anything are you?

no not really.

Good.  I usually don't like to page sysops, but it said that users were
welcome to page you anytime to chat.

yup.. thats one of the biggest reasons why i set up this system, so that i
could chat and meet with people that i probably wouldnt in any other
circumstance.

I know what you mean.  If you walked by a stranger on the street you
wouldn't normally stop and say HELLO and introduce yourself etc., mainly
because of physical barriers (race, gender, age, choice in clothing).  But
on a system like this, all those things are nullified.

that's it exactly...i'm glad someone else realizes these things..the
differences between face to face and digital communication....if only
everyone could approach each other in the 'outside' world with such openess
and lack of prejiduce (sp?) that you can in this form of communicatinon.
(sorry for my messy typing!)

Don't worry about your typing - I can understand what you are saying fine.
For all you know I could be, say, a skinhead for example, and you wouldn't
know it, because you can't see me behind these glowing words that I am
typing on the screen.  BUT: even if I were a skinhead (which I am not), it
would be could that you could talk to me and see my views and opinions
without my physical presense to intimidate you.

yes!  that's right...you seem very good at getting your thoughts down in an
understandable way.....and quickly...i'm 20 years old and still have
trouble transfering thoughts to coherent language...in both writting and
speaking.  how old are you...if i may ask?

I'm 22.  You seem to be doing fine in articulating your thoughts so far.
Maybe you are just typing to fast, or your hands can't keep up with your
brain.

only 22?  shit...i wouldve guessed you were at least 30 or 40 or something
from the conversation so far.....ya, i do type a little to fast,..but i
need to in order to get my thoughts down quickly...i mean....if i need the
text to be more understandable then i just go back later and fix up all the
spelling and grammar mistakes..like in e-mail messages...you can take as
long as you want to fix up the stuff.......?

Yeah.  So, do you go to school, work, collect unemployment?

heh...i go to school.  i'm going for a diploma in computer graphics at
bromden college...

Computer Graphics?  Cool...that must be a lot of fun.  Where's Bromden
College?  Is that near Middleville?

i thought comp. graphics would be cool too...but you would be
surprised...its SO FUCKING BORING....i mean...there's no creativity
involved...no...it sucks, but i can't think of any other field that i am
insterested in right now.  bromden college is north of Sarindon ...out in
the middle of nowhere almost.

So I guess you drive out there everyday for classes?  Long drive.

ya..really long drive...it takes about 1.5 hourse...but my parents pay for
gas, so its not that bad...  do you go to school? or anythign?

No...I dropped out of high school in grade 11.  Right now I'm working
full-time at Costco.  I doubt I am going to go back to high school to
finish.  It depends.  I'm trying to figure out what to do with my life
right now.

cool..do you live with your parents still...or?

I'm renting a basement apartment right now (not my parents').  I've been
here for about 7 or 8 months I think...It's great.

your so lucky...i'd love to move out of my parents place, but i don't have
the money,,...and i'm thinking that i wont for a long time...i'm working
parttime and my parents still have to help pay my way through college...so
i owe them big time...HEY...need a roommate?

Heh. :)  It's only a one room apartment...sorry!

i'll sleep on the floor....anything!  get me out of my perents house!
pleeeze!...ha.. :) just kidding.

I know exactly how you feel!  Don't they have residence at the college or
something?

yea..but it's way to expensive...its cheaper to drive actually.

How many years of college do you have left?

only one more after this one...its only a 2 year course...i don't know if
there are any jobs available in this field even...i probably wouldve been
better off and happier if i had done something like you...dropped out of
school and worked.

It wasn't easy for me.  My parents were very pissed off at me for dropping
out (among other things), and I was kicked out a few times.  I had to crash
at a friends house for a while, etc.

but now....now you have  your own place and everything...it must be so
great.

Yeah, I'll admit that.  I'm don't want to encourage you to drop out of
college or anything though.

mmm..i guess.

Stuck for words?  :)

ya..umm...what else can we talk about?

Anything but school.

agreed.

You remember how a few minutes ago we were talking about the difference
between online and face-to-face conversations and stuff?

ya...i agree with everything you said about that (how gender, race,
social class etc is erased or something)..

Yup.  I've thought about that sort of thing for a while...

in what way?

Well, a lot of people are saying that the Internet etc. are destroying
communication between people, because everything is so cold, and
machine-like, and instantaneous etc., but I think that the opposite is
true.  I think that it makes people all over the world notice each other,
and try to understand each other, no matter who they are.  I think it aids
greatly in the movement towards globalism.

i totally agree!  i mean...as the internet grows and becomes more
widespread...there is suddenly a movement against it...(as with anything
else, when it gets big enough)...so many people are trying to 'return to
nature' and all that...a sort of revival of hippies in  a way, and they are
shouting "UNPLUG EVERYTHING!"...but none of our problems will be solved by
getting rid of technology...we can't DE-evolve...we cant UN-invent all
these things we have created...they are doing more good than harm...we can
use our technology knowledge in order to solve the problems that technology
of the past has caused.

That's right.  These neo-hippies that are trying to return to nature have
to realize that technology *IS* nature, it has become nature through human
inventiveness.  They also have to realize that you cannot stop air
pollution (for example) by telling the industries to stop production.  They
will not stop.  They have to think about money - an industrialist is not
going to pack his business up and go home just because he is polluting the
air.  If they had any brains, these neo-hippies/environmentalists would
stop in their demonstrating and instead get to work on designing a safe way
to filter out air contaminants from industry - the same can be done with
many environmental issues that the world faces today.

i agree again...(were we seperated at birth or something?...:) )...the
thing is though (if you weren't aware already), that technology exists that
can filter air pollution from industry, but these filters are so expensive
that many industries cannot afford to install them...it has been proposed
that the governmetn reimburse the industry for the cost of the filters, but
the government doesn't have all that much money nowadays either..!

I was aware that such filters exist.  Thanks for reminding me.  Actually,
technological solutions for large environmental problems exist already, but
the problem is that such changes (such as electric cars) are not embraced
by society very quickly.  It's sad, really.

ya...it is...hey. umm...i really want to stay and chat moree about this,
but i have to get going...please leave me a message or page me next time
your online so we can continue this...ok?

Sure...I'd love to.  TTYL..!

yeah...cya.

"Me - 1 (Libby - None)"

I had to do it.
I had to do it to it, becuase It just wouldn't leave me alone.
And, although I don't regret what I've done, I at least hope that you'll be
able to understand.
Perhaps even to agree with my decision.  My action.
What other choice did I have?

Libby had always been a nuisance.  So many requests, DEMANDS.
But by no means did It not give anything in return for giving in to It.
I don't deny that.  That aspect of my relationship (or perhaps 'war' would
be a better term) with Libby.
I was given pleasure for my compliance + success, and pain for my rebellion
or failures.
Some times Libby would hurt me by clogging my mental machinery with It's
presence.
Or at other times Libby had even resorted to down-right begging!
We went through the routine many many times.

But when we came to necrophelia. .. . . I. .. had to do SOMETHING.
RIGHT?

So I buried Libby.
