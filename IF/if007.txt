Three Short Stories (Unfinished and/or Failed Attempts)
(anonymous)


   gerrit spoke with an uneasiness, holding his forgotten
pepsi at a precarious angle.  "this is the story of how
tony found his social niche," he began, gazing at the
linoleum floor.
   "tony went to a community college in his area right after
high school, still living with his parents.  he took a 3 year
course in business management, although he didn't have any
interest in it.  he worked a part-time job at a video store.
   "ok, so every friday night, tony would get drunk with his
buddies, then he would sleep in until two o'clock the next
afternoon.  the pattern began in grade ten.
   "oh, i don't know where i am going with this story, but
i suppose he eventually meets a nice mainstream girl, and he
gets married and beats his wife when he gets drunk.  his
wife doesn't have enough self-esteem to get out of the marriage,
so this continues until tony gets some sort of liver disease
or something."
   gerrits' peers looked on with disappointment.  "he could've
done much better", they thought.  it seems gerrit is having
some personal problems, and doesn't know how to express them.
   "good try, gerrit," alicia said.
   gerrit felt like he was going to puke.  he took a slurp of
pepsi in a vain attempt to keep it down.  what happened next is
the decision of several stomach muscles.
that was pointless....why didn't i capitalize anything?  fuck.


   Alex's publisher had just refused to publish his fifth collection of
poetry, claiming that his quality of writing had declined steadily
since his second book.  They said his work had become too
'experimental'.  Alex thought his writing had matured, but according
to others, this was not the case.
   In the weeks that followed, Alex felt depressed and uninspired.
His routine environment no longer held and lasting fascination for
him.  He needed something new to inspire him.  'If only someone
would come along and break my heart,' he often thought to himself.
   It struck him to take his notebook to more dynamic environments,
away from the predictable, cliche coffee shops and cafes.  He tried
the mall.  He sat himself on a bench, observing people walk by him
for several hours, sometimes seeing the same person twice.  No one
ever stopped moving, another boring routine.  Alex tried to write a
poem about the boredom of the mall, but it failed to turn out the
way he liked:

        Automatons spending at random moments of delight,
        or when "Sale" is spotted through the distant
        wags of fellow idiots,
        ;alkjsjdf FUCK this......shit.


   Escapism: Episode One

   Min left the house, pulling on her long, black polyester coat as
she slammed the door behind her.  She quickly checked to make sure
she had her house key with her.  It was dangling on the end of a
short chain, attached to one of the belt loops in her Levi's.  She
wasn't sure what time she would be back, or if anyone would be there
when she returned.
   From inside, Min heard something break.  Probably a desk lamp (or
a desk).  She usually left the house at this time of morning, when
her father-in-law is either ultra-drunk, or having loud, violent sex
with his live-in mistress.  In this case, it was the latter.  Min
walked across the slushy lawn and onto the sidewalk, taking her first
steps in her daily mission of escapism.  She moved south on Cherry
Blossom Avenue, surrounded by an unnatural calmness in the
suburbs.  Min thought about this small pocket of civilization, about
how it was mass-produced, and made to be appealing for young
families that owned grey mini-vans.  The young families that don't
know how to raise children properly, telling their kids that they
are useless pieces of shit, then hugging them as they leave for
work, leaving them with abusive care-givers.  Welcome to the suburbs:
breeding ground of oxymorons.
   Min's train of thought was suddenly interrupted when a drop of
rain landed in her eye.  It felt cool, and pure.  She beleived that
her eyed had been blessed, given the ability to see through the
walls of bullshit that surrounded everything.  More blessings fell
from the sky, blessings that will never be recieved, blessings that
will perhaps be swept out of existance by a pair of squeeky
windshield-washers on one of the grey mini-vans.  Min left her coat
open, letting as many blessings as possible penetrate her as she
walked towards the bus-stop.
   At the bus-stop, soaked, Min read a poorly designed advertisement
that was plastered on the inside wall of the bus-shelter as she
waited for...lsidj the fuckign aupgb bus?? of course oahsdhfhasdh fuck
ais df i don't want to wreite this shitawo8iehrjtfahshdhb bcbz ohhh
wheriwha where am i oging going with this??..uthhghhghghghg. WHY
can't i ever finsiha story?!

The Ultimate in Hair Science
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every day, external agressions cause the loss of Ceramide, a natural
fortifier in your hair, that ensures the strength and cohesion of the hair
fiber.  Every day, X90587 replaces it.

X90587 PERFORMANCE shampoos and conditioners are the only ones to contain a
duplicate Ceramide.  This Ceramide-r penetrates to the core of the hair
fiber, replacing the daily loss of natural Ceramide, to repair, strength and
protect it.

   "M&M (Man & Machine) Collaborations: Poems"
   (by Gideon Hartwell)


   I have been writing a large amount of poetry in the past month, both
   on my own, and in collaboration with my machine.  I have gathered the
   following 'Man & Machine' poems together for those readers who have
   shown further interest in my computer generated (semi-computer
   generated) poetry.

   Please refer to my essays in the first three issues of Integral
   Functions if you have no idea what I am talking about.


   #1

   'chaste' (mar96)

   this violent (healthy)
   terrific area, with its lovable
   unorganized inspiration addresses
   what i
   fondled and declined pseudo-entertainment
   pressed and the laughter at they,
   johnny lived beside pond
   on planet punishment (dancer annoyed it)
   dangerous at screaming in warranted orgasmic
   oh, the excessive deepness of
   it all.
   
   
   #2
   
   'faithful toy' (apr96)
     
   they aged the flustered oyster creature,
   a thatched moon,
   tall cereal wheat; unlike
   a photograph pinned,
   repeated at duplex (to bandage),
   anticipation without energy: you
   were there too.
   
   
   #3
   
   'vexed' (apr96)
     
   i wandered with the cautious painter
   for faces, served at bell,
   lumpy like this existence.
   we having a snorted disagreement
   munched at flimsy - in something,
   pressed and stretched (her breasts
   against a mylar dress).
   
   
   #4
   
   'the rollercoaster argument' (apr96)
   
   consumed boy in rollercoaster
   the maggot in claw - we spied the tiger
   and my picked at, so ugly and
   bursting she gathered i begged to be
   less complicated and obeyed:
   engaged he in narrow rough saliva and
   satisfactory i controlled, tickets
   this ride unfree.  such screams
   were listened (ears with).
   
   
   #5
   
   'we' (apr96)
   
   i fancied the brooch and
   the end for grinning bullet,
   impatient i contradicted impassible the
   hair (scattered about like
   blood).
   
   
   #6
   
   'what i watched' (mar96)
   
   and the fragrant death smile
   found this expressive croquet
   tournament: fucked, thumped
   (they gazed unwanted, conversation)
   he large and charmed - lust
   they had
   offended the sun itself
   (at the edge i stood).

Chapter 5

Correlation and Regression Analysis


Regression analysis normally leads to the development of an equation that
predicts the value of the dependent variable as a function of the
independent variable(s). The basic form is Y = A + BX. That is, the
dependent variable, Y, is the function of a constant, A, and the magnitude
of the independent variable, X, multiplied by some coefficient, B. While B
can take a fairly complex form, the basic principle remains the same. In
very broad terms, regression equations, when plotted, can be said to take
either linear or curvilinear form.

Selected Poems: March 13 - March 30, 1996
(by Gideon Hartwell)


The following (fifteen) poems are not computer generated.  Each poem is
numbered, and seperated from the next poem by a series of dashes ("-----").


ONE.

with elegance he drives

uncertain swerves, subtle
playful                    blind spot
       (jerking wheel)

the gentle violence of
   he is the only on who drives
   this way, with accidental elegance

     (music loud
      night
      speedlimit
      changinglanes
      highbeams-lowbeams)

casual, turning
     ignore white lines
                       is it apathy?

  "let's go anywhere"
                            caress
  smile in darkness streetlights
  cast growing/receeding shadows
  on the dash back of my seat

              he still drives, gloves
        on wheel, ribbed elegance.

-----

TWO.

Automated Chivalry


He used to hold doors open
for me,
now they hold themselves
open.

-----

THREE.

Sorry Animals


On the linoleum she landed, the
cold white refrigerator door
against her back (from within,
the cheese grows mould),

face burning, she's never been
hit so hard, flesh shaken loose
from the bones.

She sees his fist changing
colour, as does his aura (and
perhaps the cheese too): rage,
guilt, regret.

Such sorry animals we are. If
only we could be more like the
ants (she thinks),

strong and efficient.

-----

FOUR.

False Alarm


Something blotted out the sun,
just a moment ago. A plane?
I don't know. For a few moments
there I thought it was The End,
but no,
just another false alarm.

-----

FIVE.

Your structure is magnificent,
he tells her, wishing (at that
moment) that she were a statue.
He would charge admission.

-----

SIX.

Oooh, Kanada
(speaking to the [Canadian] flag)


Your autumn leaf stands, like
a mountie with an erection,
a rigid,
architectural flame, roasting
the confidence of those that
look upon you
with pseudo-pride. Sharp, an
icon of bitterness.
You were never green,
and yet, you never wither.

-----

SEVEN.

Damn Sundays


Lofty this chill, dust
sealed in a vacuum. Sundays
are musty and bright,
like happiness

or something.
I remember once, we drove
out to the mall,
no money, but apathy galore.

We made fun as they walked
by, especially those that
held, not imagining us.

-----

EIGHT.

dear acme inc


this cliff overlooks a ripple of
flesh my eyes leaning down
touching a wrinkle in forward
                   in jerks back my eyes rolling
sun bright blazing i reconsider
this direction point downwards    reflections
of my nothing
deepness
not forgotten fading and beginning again
as everything does
machines approach me with petition
why should i sign
                 why should i sign
off the edge they go me watching them
smaller and smaller a dot then a
puff of smoke just like road runner cartoons
i wonder if they left a hole in their shape
likeness
and birds twitter around their heads for
a while but they come back
                          they come back
indeed

-----

NINE.

one morning


you awoke as i flushed the
toilet, which totally
turned you off (you con-
ditioned); funny invention.

-----

TEN.

my own dream


i saw my own hand covering my
own mouth, stopping
my own voice          from
saying something silly.
                these things
tend to be prophetic.

-----

ELEVEN.

happier


all i have to do is remind
myself how easy it is
to die.

-----

TWELVE.
