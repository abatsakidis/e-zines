Censorship
Ryan Lavallee

        "It is better to debate a question without settling it than to settle a
question without debating it."[1]  By this statement, Joseph Joubert
(1754-1824) demonstrated his recognition of the importance of deliberation on a
topic of controversy, even if a conclusive solution resolving the problems
associated with the issue is never reached.  The process of disputing
questionable issues of society has been in existence far longer than Joubert's
observation, however.  Thousands of years ago, the institution of authoritative
bodies in society precipitated the questioning of the degree of control those
who are in power should have over those who are not.  Although people may not
have recognized it as such in this time period, they were no less concerned
about a concept that has outlived any code of law or set of morals -
censorship, commonly interpreted as any supervision or control exercised by
anybody in authority over public communication, conduct or morals[2].  Early
censorship in the Greek city-states outlawed conduct insulting to the gods or
dangerous to the public order; the English term "censorship" itself is derived
from the Roman official who dictated public morality known as the censor. After
having been debated for millenniae, censorship and its restriction on freedom
is still a volatile issue that is continually being scrutinized.

        One of the founding principles of western countries is freedom.  Many
people who originally settled here fled from societies that did not allow them
the freedom to practice or even to express their religious, political, and
social beliefs.  The people who came here and turned this land into countries
were determined to preserve all possible freedom for the inhabitants. The very
First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, added in 1791, pledged that "Congress
should make no law abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press". Canadians
have also been trying to keep their country as free as possible, from its birth
to modern day society; the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, brought
into effect in 1982, stated that everyone has the "freedom of thought, belief,
opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of
communication".  In spite of these seemingly clear prohibitions against
obstructing freedom of expression, censorship is a

[1] Joseph Joubert (1754-1824), Censorship - Opposing Viewpoints, p. 9
[2] CENSORSHIP, The New American Desk Encyclopedia, p. 241
 
controversial issue throughout Canadian and American society.  Debates continue
to the present day over exactly what forms of speech will be in accordance with
the Canadian and American Constitutions.  In areas such as speech, national
security, and education, people are still divided over whether the government
has the right to restrict individual expression to protect its citizens.  Some
people believe that even in a nation whose chief value is freedom, certain
things should not be tolerated, while others believe that freedom should be
preserved at all costs.

        Freedom of speech is one of the basic priveleges guaranteed to all
Canadians and Americans by their countries' respective constitutions.
Traditionally, no form of speech should be censored unless it poses a direct
harm to others.  Shouting "fire" in a crowded theater (if no fire exists) is
the most familiar example of harmful and outlawed speech.  However, this
seemingly straightforward view of freedom of speech raises the question of
whether some speech should be considered so harmful that its censorship is
justified.   Many believe that those people who support white supremacy and
racial hatred do not deserve freedom of speech protections, while others argue
that preventing a white supremacist from speaking is one step toward censoring
other unpopular kinds of speech as well.  If a country does not believe in
racism though, it should not protect racist speech.  The concept of "free
speech" is quite abstract when compared to the real and documented historical
violence of the Ku Klux Klan and its allies.  The Klan has murdered and
organized for over 120 years - does that not demonstrate a direct threat of
harm being posed by the Klan to others?  According to U.S. law, it doesn't.  In
a 1969 case involving a KKK leader at a rally in Hamilton County, Ohio, the
U.S. Supreme Court unanimously established the principle that speech may not be
restrained or punished unless it "is directed to inciting or producing imminent
lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action."[3]  In this
case, the Supreme Court made it clear that before a speaker can be suppressed
there must be a "clear and present danger that the audience will act illegally
and do what the speaker urges - not just believe in what is advocated"[4]. In
addition, speech can only be restrained if it is in an individual face-to-face
encounter, and is not nonverbal symbols displayed before a general audience.
Evidently, it is quite difficult for speech to be considered harmful, and
consequently, illegal.  What the Supreme C established

[3] Brandenburg v. Ohio, Censorship - Opposing Viewpoints, p.23
[4] Censorship - Opposing Viewpoints, p.23

removes so many restrictions on speech that it is difficult to legally restrain
speech until harm is already done.  Is there much sense in setting these
conditions for free speech if it cannot be dealt with until after it has caused
harm?  Clearly, the censorship of such speech is justified and necessary for
the protection of society as a whole.  Legal philosopher Edmond Cahn argued
that prohibition against group defamation would be detrimental to society at
the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in 1962.[5]  He said that if group
defamation was prohibited, anyone who distributed the Christian Gospels could
be prosecuted, as they contain defamatory statements about Jews and Christians,
and Greek literature could be banned for calling the rest of the world
barbarians.  However, it is apparent that Cahn failed to recognize that there
is a great difference between the Ku Klux Klan and church officials, or
historians. How often does a church official or historian rally to incite
listeners to murder individuals from an entire race or group?  Clearly, the
racist speech of the Ku Klux Klan is more harmful than the distribution of the
Holy Bible.  The need to protect people from racist speech far outweighs the
right of freedom of expression; the defeat of racism is a greater priority to
society than is the right to unrestricted free speech.  Undeniably, the
censorship of certain forms of harmful speech is justified.

        In the interests of national security, public access to military
information is regularly restricted by the government.  However, many
journalists oppose these restrictions, considering them a form of unnecessary
censorship.  Most journalists would agree that there are some legitimate
reasons for government secrecy, but problems arise with the issue of
distinguishing between those times when secrecy is legitimate and those times
it is not.  Many feel that the person with access to the information may make
uninformed decisions concerning secrecy that may not be in the public interest.
The public's interest in knowing about its government is guaranteed by the
freedom of the press, but there have been cases in which the release of
sensitive information has had an adverse effect, and the lives of many
government employees and the security of a country as a whole are reasons to
restrict media access to confidential information.  The CIA in the United
States indicates this in the occasion of the assassination of a CIA agent in
Athens, Greece in 1975.[6]  A newspaper had published his name and the fact
that he worked for the CIA, and the agent was killed less than a month later.

[5] Censorship - Opposing Viewpoints, p. 25
[6] Censorship - Opposing Viewpoints, p.96

The CIA came to the conclusion that the agent's death was attributed to the
publication of his name and title.  This case and many others like it shows
that in some cases freedom of the press should be restricted.  Often, though,
the valid argument is presented that the press should serve the governed and
not the governors; restricting the press gives the government the opportunity
to deceive its people.  A common belief is held that no reporter would
deliberately publish information hurtful to national security.  Unfortunately,
there is always the possiblity of error in judgement of what could be harmful
to national security.  The debate over national security and the public's right
to know addresses two important concerns of the governed people in a   nation -
the security of the country and the right of free speech and a free press that
is guaranteed in the Constitution.  There is no perfect solution to the issue,
but it would be senseless to feign indifference - only through continued
examination will the best possible decision be reached on when the government
should be allowed to use national security as a reason to justify censorship.

        For as long as schools and libraries have existed, it has probably been
debated whether  schoolchildren and the general public should be protected from
offensive and subversive materials, or if such materials should be available in
public schools and libraries.  The opposing argument to the censorship of
questionable materials in libraries is that in a democracy, where all ideas are
debated by tradition, a wide range of materials from all points of view should
be available to the public.  Since selection has to be made anyways, teachers
and librarians choose only the most educational and uplifting materials to be
purchased.  If people wish to read books with graphic illustrations of  sodomoy
and bestiality, they may do so in the private sector.  There should be no
restrictions on the publication of such materials, but they are not appropriate
for a place designed for intellectual pursuits, such as a library or school. Of
course, anything with any intellectual value should not be restricted from a
library, no matter how controversial.  People should not be denied the
opportunity to know about another's ideas.  If they feel they are being exposed
to material they disagree with or find offensive, there is nothing preventing
them from ceasing to explore that material.  Books are written to entertain, to
make people think, to excite them, and to expose them to new ideas.  If
libraries were stripped down, many people would be incapable of thinking and
understanding parts of themselves, other human beings, or the world.  Schools,
where young people are under the intellectual guidance of responsible adults,
are the perfect place to give students the opportunity to choose which ideas
they wish to be exposed to.  Students cannot learn to make independent
judgements unless they are exposed to numerous ideas, no matter how
controversial.  The censoring of public or school libraries is detrimental to
society as it threatens the quality of education and availability of knowledge.
Disagreements between people occasionally causes dislike or hatred between the
opposing parties.  Under controlled situations, however, it strengthens the
individuals involved by increasing their awareness and allowing them to add to
their own knowledge.  Censorship is a sensitive topic for many people in a
variety of situations.  The desire for freedom is inherent in all human beings,
and is one of the founding principles of our nation.  As shown in the harm
caused by permitting the expression of racist thoughts, there are some cases in
which control must be placed over public expression in order to protect society
as a whole.  In other situations, though,  such as the restriction of certain
materials in libraries, censorship can affect people adversely.  Problems can
arise in the deciding of who should have the authority to place restrictions on
freedom.  Benjamin Franklin addressed this issue in the 18th century: "Abuses
of the freedom of speech ought to be repressed, but to whom are we to commit
the power of doing it?"[7]  A conclusive decision is difficult to reach when
considering censorship in matters such as national security.  The best
interests of both the government and its people must be taken into account in
order to preserve national unity.  As a result, in many cases no definite
conclusion can be reached regarding what justifies the restriction of speech.
Although there may never be a perfect solution to what forms of expression
should be restricted, continued debating will bring society closer to having as
much freedom as possible while still keeping the protection rewarded by the
constructive use of censorship.

   (juxtaposition)
	(fixation)                 By Curtis Yateman
	

The rodent took it upon himself to follow the man.  Not because he looked
particularly interesting, just...because.  The rodent worked that way.  
The man walked into a drugstore and purchased some Tylenol, then as he 
walked out, the rodent observed him dump the pills into a sewer grate. 
Ah hah!  The rodent exclaimed, then rushed down the grate and found the 
pills, now wet from the rushing toxic water.  The rodent quickly collected 
the pills and put them in a safe place.  They would be useful to him later, 
perhaps on the black rodent market. 
When the rodent returned to the surface, the man had disappeared.  The 
rodent was not disgruntled, but rather pleased.  Victory was his.  Suddenly 
the rodent heard a rushing sound, a loud squeal and then no more.  The 
rodent's brains were squashed out over the road as tire rubber rushed over 
his head.  His limp body would stay there for three days, and then wash out 
with a rainfall.  The Tylenol pills ( about 20 ) would be broken apart and 
rendered useless by the water.
The man took the empty bottle and tossed it aside, went home, looked at a 
picture of his grandmother for awhile, then put his pyjamas on and settled 
on top of his TV for a good night's rest, staring at the bed on the floor.  
He awoke to his phone ringing the next morning.  He got up and answered.
" Goodbye? "
" Goodbye.  Mr. Smith John? " 
" No. That is me. "
" Well sir, I am informing you that you don't have to be at the interview 
by 8:30 AM. "
" You thank. You thank very much. "
" No problem.  Hello. "
" Hello. "
Smith got dressed and went to the interview. 
In the car on the way there, the Smith laughed at a woman who was 
being mugged.  He laughed even harder when the man mugging her 
stabbed her.  Her white dress soon became blood soaked as she fell 
limp to the ground.  Smith laughed so hard that he was forced to 
stop the car.  He suddenly had no initiative.  Smith turned the car 
around and looked at the picture of his grandmother for the rest of 
the day.  Much more pleasing.

"technology you can scoff at"
(no know)

on television, i came across a program talking of monitoring a penis erection
with some glorious gadgetry.  (i don't know whether or not the entire program
was dedicated to this.  the portion that i took in took up a few mere minutes).
a man was laying on a tableÄ-a typical doctor's office type-tableÄ-and a doctor
was allowing him to listen to the blood rushing (loudly) in his own penis, as
it firmed up stiff.  the man expressed amazement.  then, an x-ray image was
shown of the penis firming and rising from dangley limp meat, and I giggled
helplessly.
afterwardsÄ-after thoughtÄ-i wondered what was done to arouse the man.

The Product Of
(by Meadowlark)


     My wardrobe is largely neutral.  Not only neutral in colour, but in
style.  Most of my clothes are very plain and physically unobtrusive upon
others.  No company logo is displayed anywhere on them, and the shirts have
no collars, buttons, or pockets.  The pants in my wardrobe are either
standard blue jeans, or grey/brown pants.
     My hair is cut short.  Too short to be styled in any way, yet not so
short as to be intimidating.
     My voice is soft - when I use it - which isn't very often.  Only when
I am spoken too, or if I feel obligated to say "Hello," or "How are you?".
I try to determine this through observing the body language of the
potential interacting figure.
     My eyes rest upon the void of the landscape, not seeing.  I do not
stare, as I am unable to focus upon anything.  I fill the void of numbers.
     I am the face that you don't notice in crowds.  If you do happen to
notice me, I am not memorable.  You will not stare, as there is nothing to
stare at.  I am not beautiful, nor am I ugly.  I have no odd features.  I
just am.
     I am the the product of demographics.
     I am normal.
     I am accepted.

     I am.

Dream - May 31, 1996
(spelling and grammer unedited)


I am home in the summer.  Family has been gone a long time Vacation?  We
just got back.  Dad and I are in the upstairs bathroom, and we find a
mourning dove living there.  Dad takes it out and releases it in the front
yard.  Then I am in my room singing, and I find another mourning dove in my
window curtains and I release it in the front porch - my dad is shouting
from the kitchen to be careful when handling the bird, and I feel
patronized.  Then I am talking to mom, asking her if I can watch TV,
because she watches TV during all her waking hours - there is a show that
is going to have an interview with Tori Amos - she let me watch my show.
They had a recent interview with Tori Amos, then showed an older one,
looked like from the early eighties - she had frizzed short hair and fake
tatoos all over her chest, arms, and face - heavy red lipstick - a sort of
post-punk look and attitude to her gestures.  The interview was filmed in
the back of a limo, so the camera work is slightly shaky, and the camera is
too close.  Then I am in control of the sound system, and I am playing bad
music.  (Wired, speakers all over house implanted in walls)  Justine and
Meghan are there too.  Mom is asking Mike before he leaves to go back to
Michigan what food to cook for the wedding.  The wedding is only a few days
away.  Then I am suddenly in Michigan outside a church after Sunday
service.  The priest has a store (a variety store) in the back of his
church.  But it is not the priest who is selling.  I am with Brian and he
is telling how he and his girlfriend made up - his girlfriend realized that
she over-reacted - they had some fight about a newspaper article they had
read together.  How stupid.  I buy a book in the store written by a female
poet (Jong?  Atwood?) about how to write poetry.  I am paying for it and I
ask if I can come back to buy something later - I suddenly realize what a
stupid question that is and I say "of course I can...you always like to get
money!" to the person behind the counter.  Then Brian and I leave.  We are
in the church, which is his house.  I am alone now - his house is old and
whimsical.  A cross between the old Simpson farm and Judith & Viktor
Tinkl's house.  Upstairs there is a glass - painted, and a wire sculpture
hanging over the kitchen table.  I really like it.  I leave and come back
later to visit the priest and see the wire sculpture again.  He isn't home
so I go in - it is getting dark outside - I choose the wrong door to get to
the kitchen and instead go downstairs where the priest has a hidden son
locked away in a room marked as: "QUEER CAGE".  The son is bouncing around
with sheets wrapped around him.  I panic and run back upstairs - the house
is complex - trying to find my way to the upstairs kitchen with the
sculpture - I finally find it - it is nighttime and the house has lost its
whimsy and become frightening.  I know that I won't be able to find my way
out of the house, and I realize I will be caught and locked up or
something.  I realize I am dreaming and that my dream has become a
nightmare, but I don't wake up.  I try to figure out a way to wake myself
up.  I see the large full wall window painted in the kitchen - run and jump
through it - shatters and I fall, hoping to wake up - I fall and am close
to hitting the ground but I don't want to - I want to wake up first - and I
do - I wake up saying "ahhh...!" in a soft voice - I must have been
screaming in the dream.  I make a wierd/obvious association when in the
bathroom taking a needed pee: (window) pane = (physical) pain.


{=========================================================================}

Times have changed since the violence of things in the electronic age.
Here, in the english-speaking countries that remain, we grow rice in our
minds.  A savage age, running from the dogs we have let lose on ourselves,
eternal fear.  We have discovered that only thought can exceed the speed of
light.  I tell you, I'm so sick of the smell of wood.  At night, I dream of
steel concepts, covering the mess of sky.  I used to find thought so
beautiful, like atoms.  The loss of privacy isn't that big of a deal.  I
vaguely remember what it felt like to be corperal.  I remember landscapes,
colours, faces, and the sound of voices.  A time when the individual had so
much control.  They thought they could invent a eutopia.  They thought
machines were the answer.  I wish I could bleed.  I want it all back: the
bullshit politics, the social cliques, everything.  Keep your proverbial
ears out of my head.  Beauty is transparency.
