EMOTIONS: SHOW DON'T TELL
( Ms. Sullivan )


When you write a story, it's much more interesting if you present the
character's feelings in action, rather than just telling the audience exactly
what your character feels or thinks.


Telling (DON'T!)

A story which only tells is not a story; it's a plot summary.  A story which
merely tells is boring.

Example:
When George came home from school that day, he went to see his goldfish.  He
was really excited to have a pet.  He was really proud that his mom was letting
him feed the goldfish.  He took his responsibility seriously.  He got the
goldfish food and went to feed the fish.  He couldn't see the fish in the bowl.
He felt puzzled.  He looked hard for the fish, but he couldn't see it.
Then he saw it: it was dead on the bottom of the fishbowl.  George felt sad.
He wished his goldfish hadn't died.  He wanted to cry.  His heart was breaking.
He was hurt.  He felt badly.  He felt depressed.  He was one sad kid.  He
called for his mom and sat down on the floor.


Showing (DO!)

Showing fully what a character feels without actually saying the words requires
you to pay attention to detail.  You must use a lot of descriptive words.  You
must describe little facial expressions, subtle body postures and signals.
This description is what makes your character interesting and what makes your
reader care about your character.

Example:
George raced home from school that day, his little legs working double time.
He burt into the kitchen, yelling, "Hi, Mom!"  He headed straight for the
goldfish food, where it was kept on top of the microwave.  He knocked the salt
and pepper on to the floor, but he didn't notice.  He ran into the living room,
right up to the goldfish bowl, and looked down into it, calling softly,
"Crispy, Crispy, supper time!  Come up for your food."  He blinked, and then
looked into the bowl from the side.  He gasped.  "Mom!" he yelled.  "Mom, come
quick!"  He ran into the kitchen and got a spoon.  He put the spoon in the bowl
and lifted the beautiful little orange body out of the water.  He just stood
there, staring at it.  His eyes were big and wide.  He breathed deeply, his
shoulders lifting and falling in little spasms.  He put the fish back in the
water, poking it a little with his finger, encouraging it to swim.  When it
sank to the bottom, he sank too, to the floor, and sat there, cross-legged,
hunched over, his arms fallen weakly to his sides, his chin sunk on his chest,
his full, red lower lip pushed out and trembling.

  A CERTAIN JUSTICE - Curtis Yateman


        All activity - although quite bustling in this area during daylight,
seemed to cease as night fell.. Or this particular night, anyways.  It was
not much of a concern to Harold, who, like most of the other men his age, 
was only interested in living his everyday working man life, and coming home
to a loving bed.  The night sparked no curiousity in him, its noises 
attracted very little of his attention.  As he headed down the steps into 
the subway however, a sound passed his ears that was seldom heard:  The 
closest comparison would be a whispering..  Very light and subtle into his
ears, nonsence phrases.  Harold faltered his step for a moment- and then moved
on.     
        There was no one else waiting at this particular stop, and Harold did
not blame them.  It had become so late at night that the following morning was
approaching.  Harold was overworked, tired, and did not care.  The train came.
Harold picked up his briefcase, which he's left resting beside him, and 
hobbled over to the now opening glass doors.  There was no one inside.  Harold
sat down, and the doors slid close (as if they were doing so just for HIM; 
this was an odd feeling) and the train began acceleration again.  
        It was dark and wet here, yet oddly comfortable.  Harold's eyes began
to close, and he started to drift.  The 'whispers' returned, floating past
his conciousness, and back again.  They seemed to be circling him..  He felt
himself breathing them in, they swirled and twisted around each other inside
of him.  They became..  A PART of him.  
        His eyes snapped open.  The train had stopped.  Harold shook his head
is disarray and picked up the briefcase once more.  The doors opened.  Harold
walked to the threashold, but instead of seeing the area where the train 
usually left him in, he saw something not totally - but significantly
different, like everything had been..  Warped somehow.  The sky was a warm 
gray, the earth a sickly pale green.  All that had once been buildings or
establishments were now twisted, like their shape, their very fabric of
existance had been molded and turned into something abstract and demented.
        Caught in this sight Harold would not have noticed the giant bat-like
creature flying towards him had it not swept down and gashed open his face.
Harold let out a howl and fell to the train's floor, clutching his cheek.  
The briefcase fell and hit the edge of the doorframe, it fell forward into
this new world and it's contents (papers and otherwise) scattered about the
ground.  Harold was more concerned however about his face, and the blood that
was streaming from it down through his hands and on his clothes.  He was even
more concerned than that about the beast, coming in for it's second flurry,
headed straight at Harold's throat.
" Thatssss enough. "  Came a hissing voice.  The beast swept upwards, and out
of the subway car.  Harold looked up, his face stinging.  
        Into the doorway stepped something ten times more terrible looking 
than the bat, something that Harold's conciousness could never possibly 
conceive.  It's face was that of a human, except stretched out in a way, the
skin holding position much wider apart than any human.  It's arms - which were
long, black and bony - were braced against the doorframe, two clawed fingers
hooking into the metal.  It grinned at Harold, who was backing against the 
wall of the train.  " Hello thhhhere.. "  It hissed at him.  " We've been
exxxxxpecting you. "  
        Harold tried to form words, but his throat was too dry. 'This is 
insane', he thought.  'I am dreaming.  I am overworked, and I am dr ' Harold
could think no more, for he did not realized the speed at which the creature
before him moved..  It had struck him unconcious.

        " reaming. "  He muttered.  Harold made an attempt to open his eyes,
but something had sealed his eyes closed.  He felt cold metal holding down 
his wrists and ankles to a cold surface.  There was a faint buzzing sound in
the distance, and the shuffling of feet.
        " Ladies and gentlemen; " a voice announced.  " Our savior has 
arrived.  Blessed times are with us again, and the wall shall soon be
destroyed.  Behold!  Our destiny.  "  Harold felt whatever surface he was
on being tilted upward.  He heard cheering, and soon saw the source, as he
squeezed his blood clotted eyes open.  Hundreds..  Thousands..  of these 
people..  All of them seemed to be a cross between a human and some sort of
insect, large crosstitched eyes on some, small red eyes on others.  Some had
rows of perfectly set pointed teeth, some had fangs, others no teeth at all.
They all had one thing in common, however.  They were all looking at him - and
smiling, grinning, laughing, cheering, clapping, even dancing.  The speaker,
whom came into view now, was the most horrendous of them all.  It seemed to
be attached to the ground, for everything on it from the waist down was 
covered in (or just WAS) a red sticky melting substance.  It had over ten arms
at each side, which were those of a praying mantis, or very similar.  It's
face seemed to be inhaling ITSELF with each breath, sucking in it's own
features and spitting them back out on itself.  Harold finally managed to form
words:  " What..  What am i doing here? " He gasped.
        The answer came immediately:  " We sent for you, " it whispered.  " We
are a dying breed, we've spent years attempting to figure out why, and now we
know.  It is YOUR fault, Harold; the mental incapacity within us was caused
by YOU.  "
        " Thats absurd, " he replied, " I've done nothing to you, all I have
done is live my life, do my resear- "  suddenly he realized.
        " Your research, " the creature continued for him, " that is exactly 
it. "  The creature held up a few papers which Harold immediately recodnized.
They were the ones contained within his briefcase, the millitary permission 
forms to commence the .. experiments. " 
        " We are the result, Harold, " the creature whispered, seeming to read
his mind, " we are the result of all your damned 'important' research, your 
years of study.  But we've found a way to correct that problem. "
        Harold knew now, what they planned to do.  " Why didnt you kill me in
the subway then? "  
        The creature smiled.  " Because it makes for a WONDERFUL show, my 
friend.  And with that in mind, on with it! "  The crowd roared on the last
syllable.  Harold closed his eyes as the knife fell.

Encouraging the Acceleration of Technological Society:
From Gideon Hartwell


- Formation of a loose, non-bureaucratic group, who's task it is to point out
  to the world or elimate/change any obsolete or corrupt systems or
  organizations which hinder global/universal human acceleration.

- Changes which must be made:

       - The advertising industry (progaganda) must be totally eliminated from
         the globe.  It serves no purpose.  It propogates goods and services
         that are not needed and may hinder global acceleration by maintaining
         the "popularity" of obsolete or useless products.  A global database
         of available products and services can be put in place for
         individuals to search and locate products they *need* -- (a search
         engine like those used to locate information on the internet can do
         this).

       - Elimination of gas propelled transportation -- electrical vehicals are
         adequate -- there are many forms of energy which can be used to
         transport humans and products more quickly and efficiently.

       - Reformation of computer hardware and software -- eliminate marketing
         and competition from computer industry -> no attention is being paid
         to *necessity* of computer products -- too much novelty.

       - Computer industry must integrate with biological research -- esp.
         research into the workings of the brain.


Other Goals:

1.  Eliminate negative myths/propaganda about technology regarding automation
    etc.

    (however -- pessimism towards new technology is always required -- we must
    always question and doubt what we are doing, and be able to have multiple
    perspectives on these complex issues) ex: cloning, etc..

2.  Encourage precision and polysociation through the interaction of different
    fields of study.

3.  Ensure that every human retains freedom and individuality in the future --
    esp. when genetic research and implants are introduced into human
    populations.

4.  Ensure that bureaucratic hierarchies are not formed -- dissipation and
    decentralization of power.

* Mental Ocean (Swimming Flutter Currents Everywhere) *

Angela Dreamblur's



My mother was in the clear, plastic wrapping of two cupcakes (dark brown, with
a squiggly white line of icing on top of them).  I angrily spewed a whole
barrage of insulting names at her.  She was responsible for what she was; she
choose to be, so I was not at fault for what I was doing.

I am on the front lawn of my school.  I am watching a far away group of
familiar people; there is a crane and a wide dirt hole near them.  One of them
swings a punch in the air, and it spins him around.  I am looking through the
lense of a video camera at another group.  A fellow from another class walks in
with odd paint all over his face.  He asks the teacher about doing a project in
our class; she says that he need only fill out the proper forms (which I hadn't
known existed).  Then he said, "you know what I just found out?  I can court
everything I own for my big, fat, log."  The camera starts shaking madly, the
picture becomes black and white, and 'industrial' music begins to play--at
first it is made by someone's mouth, but then it morphs into a familiar tune.

There was a curse placed on a fetus, which caused it to die while still in the
womb.  I see myself from outside of me, pouring sugar and spice into a woman's
vagina to produce a new one.  She lays naked and unmoving as I do it.

There were people around me.  Bruce Lee ran from person to person attacking
them.  They said that I had no chance of defeating him in a battle.  I felt
afraid.  He was very small, but that gave him the advantage of hitting you in
your lower area that was more difficult to protect, and you had less area on
him to strike at (just like that video game).  He slid down a hill, while
kicking in the air so fast that his feet were a blur; during this he let out a
constant japanese/Karate cry and his face looked furious.

I am seated at a round table in a restaurant or cafe.  A woman in her 30s or
40s, wearing dark pink clothing and a large hairstyle (1950s-y: it all goes in
a downwards direction, but curls up at the bottoms) is serving me a cup with
glowing contents.  She was a mysterious person who wrote literature which
people felt made the world "happy."  I was visiting her to make inquiries about
something; this was a surprise to her.

An old man and I are sweeping a floor; it is littered with all kinds of rubbish
bits.  Two men walk by, one of them tells us, "if you don't leave in 10
minutes, you'll be locked in."  I didn't leave.  He made a comment about
locking us in.  I mockingly repeated what he had originally said, and he walked
off shamefully.  When I do leave, I pass users at computer terminals, most of
which are very young (grade 9ish).  I have to walk through a series of rooms,
seperated by glass walls.  I consider returning here at a later time to make us
of the equipment, seeing as it's so close to home.  I try to talk to a girl
that is wearing headphones.  I repeatedly ask her something, but she doesn't
hear me.  When I am done speaking, she takes them off.  I walk away from her,
heading for the exit.  It's crowded along the way with people hanging out of
their chairs into the aisle.  When I have the final elevator in sight, I have
to step over a fuzz and metal chair; it has a word written on the top of it,
which my foot smears off.  I notice an older woman's head far off and wonder
whether she saw me do that.

{===========================================================================}

YYEAH: Booby Balls


I want a pair of breasts.  Not ones which were attach to me or someone else;
no, breasts that are independant of a human body.  Just two free-floating (or
rolling or bouncing) boobies: two blooby spheres.  I suppose they'd be almost
regular round balls, but with some extras: nipples, warmth, and possibly some
hair-fuzz, as well as milk, or an area for liquids.  They would feel devine if
you were to squeeze them ("just right").  Everyone would want them.  They would
make great pillows.

They could be actual living organisms.  You would have to feed them, and they
would make their own--and your own--milk.  Booby Balls could become household
pets, with names, and the move about of their own will.  Breasts with a
survival drive.  "Awww... aren't they cute boobies?  What did you name them?"

The Booby Balls would be available in all sizes and skin shades; their degree
of firmness and hairiness would also be optional; plus, you could select the
size, shape, and shade of the nipples!  They would likely be damn expensive,
especially if they were to be realistic simulations, but worth it all.

And so long as they were attached by some means, they would be excellent
artifical chest-breasts.  All the gals would be envious.
