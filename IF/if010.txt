Patient: Angela Dreamblur
(July 9th, 1995)

History:
seems to have had negative relationship with both mother and father
(physical abuse? -- possible, psychological -- very probable)
few friends, doesn't seem to have had any close ones
also seems to have had many social problems
began to show signs negative-deviancy at about the beginning of high school
(parents didn't want to take action right away -- were unsure)
no drug abuse reported, but seems possible

Notes:
constant incoherent rambling, giggles occasionally (finds scenes of death
and disfigurement quite humourous), frequently talks of radio waves
(supposedly she recieves them and is unable to turn them off, has mentioned
messages, a few of which were requests to commit violent acts -- often
complains about 'the damneded oldy station!' -- and has expressed a desire
to 'kill all them rotted folks' ['oldy station'] ), obsession with hair
(constantly combs, attacks if others touch it -- claims that it was a gift
from an angel and that it's position affects her reception), very odd
manner of walking

Diagnosis:
undifferentiated-type schizophrenic
(appears to be in total disorganization -- speech, perception, emotion,
motor operations) -- but also expresses some paranoia and enters very brief
catatonic periods on occasion)
GAF level 25, Stressors level not known, No known physical symptoms

Recommendation:
confinement to Fixx Hospital for indefinate time period
subject appears to be a potential danger to others
treatment and further study is required

'creative accounting' and other notes
-------------------------------------

the following text is transcribed (many grammar and spelling errors have
been kept for 'realism'[?]) directly from my notebooks and journals for
this month.  i have decided to try this (sharing my journals) after reading
allen ginsberg's published journals (early fifties early sixties).  whether
it is of any use (either as knowledge or entertainment) to anyone is...
me not caring if it is or not.

** urges **


recently, i've had no urge to write.
                                        actually:

i've had constant URGES to write, but, i have been unable to do so.  i
suppose this is some sort of 'creative block' or something.  my lack of
belief in 'inspiration' hasn't hindered me in the past, and why should it?
i mean, i don't wait for ideas to come to me.  i usually force them, with
adequate success, with the aid of bisociative and polysociative thinking.

anyway.  i have resorted to writing about not being able to write.
i'll go back and observe my own atrophy.

separate notebook entry ("creative accounting") - may 11, 1996


media conversion:
- - - - - - - - -

 - collaboration of two or more artists (of different mediums)?
 - or, solo interpretation

examples (of solo intrp.): a musician writing a song based on a
painting; a novelist writing a book based on a poem.

not uncommon.  a concept is often triggered by the work of another creative
person ('inspiration').  a concept can also be triggered by either personal
or natural phenomenon (ex: death of a friend, watching the sun rise).


creativity and introversion:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

visual/musical/lyrical communication (indirect) as a replacement for direct
communication.  through a creative form of creation, such as a painting or
poem, the person can communicate as much or as little as he/she wants,
allowing for total control over what is revealed about himself or herself.


bisociation: the joining of two completely unrelated concepts or images,
forming an original idea.  also: polysociation (multiple concepts).

art is a voluntary activity.

"creative accounting" - may 14, 1996


hans richter (speaking of dada): "our feeling of freedom from rules,
precepts, money and critical praise, a freedom for which we paid the price
of an excessive distaste and contempt for the public, was a major stimulus.
the freedom...brought us closer to the source of all art, the voice within
ourselves.  the absence of any ulterior motive enabled us to listen to the
voice of the 'unknown', and to draw knowledge from the unknown."

        chance = inspiration
                in the form of free association?
                        polysociation - sounds
                                      - visions
                                      - words, semantics (sounds)

kurt rowland: "this initially destructive movement, the anti-art, therefore
led to new methods of exploring the human mind."

                        (phonetic poetry)
                        (rhymes + sounds - association)

richter: "the realization that reason and anti-reason, sense and nonsense,
design and chance, consciousness and unconsciousness, belong together as
necessary parts of a whole."

        dictionary:
        integral - 1. being an indispensable part of a whole;
                      essential; constituent. 2. formed  of
                      parts that together constitute a unity;
                      entire; complete.

WHAT DOES SOUND LOOK LIKE?
                                - smell, feel, taste?

        FEEL: physical effects of sound on the human body?
              government experiments, sound = weapon
              sound = pleasure (on body; mind)

              CONDITIONING (pavlov?): associations...the same way
              that hearing a name ('greg' for example) automatically
              causes one to associate a personality trait(s) with
              that person, based on relationships with persons with
              the same name, television or movie characters, etc.

example: i suffered from car/motion sickness as a child (and still do,
occasionally) - my family drove down to florida (from canada) one summer in
the 1980s, with my parents listening to various country music stations on
the radio for the entire journey.  as a result of this (the combination of
motion sickness and country music), i have been conditioned so that
whenever i hear country music, i feel nausea.

        this is similar to what happened to alex in 'a clockwork orange' by
        anthony burgess.

notes from 'the dynamics of creation' by anthony storr
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

        art is voluntary
        play is voluntary
                not associated with desires and wants.

                although art and play (sports, etc.) can be
                turned into a career, they do not start this
                way -

        at the moment someone decides to pursue art as a career,
        something happens - art no longer becomes voluntary -
        art becomes a PRODUCT necessary for survival.

* * *

a career producing artwork (as well as literature, poetry, music...) is not
any better than a career as an accountant:

an accountant can devote his life and should to his work as an artist would
to painting (for example), although an artist would not be able to
understand how someone could be passionate about accounting (and vice
versa), accounting is art...but in a different way.

                CREATIVE ACCOUNTING
                        with david humdrum
                                (accountant)

who says accounting has no SOUL?

        same with religion etc?

                        passion <> enthusiasm

* * *

in reading 'the dynamics of creation' by anthony storr, i have come to a
number of realizations.  in chapter seventeen ('the quest for identity'),
storr discusses in creation: 'works of art bear so strong a stamp of
individuality that they are often easily identifiable as being the work of
a particular individual.' (p. 300) storr also points out that creative
people usually do not notice an individual 'style' (if it can be called
that - it is much more complex i think) in their own work.

i suppose i have known this for a few years, but never really thought about
it clearly.  it is so difficult to escape ones individual style in which
one does things: the way you walk, body language, handwriting, drawing,
driving, painting, etc.  one can easily identify a poem by e.e. cummings, a
song by led zeppelin, etc., and yet it is difficult to recognize and
acknowledge the style of the self.

quoting anthony storr again: 'looking back over years of work, a man may
often be astonished to find the scarlet thread of his identity running
through a series of works which appeared to him very different at the time
they were conceived.  he will also often find that ideas which appeared to
have occurred to him only yesterday were in fact implicit in earlier work,
and had obvious precursors which had escaped his notice.  in fact, creative
people are often much more continuous beings than they think.'

        (i don't like that term - 'creative people' it's like saying
        'schizoid people' or something, a definition, when things are
        so much more complex.)

storr: '...[the] lack of continual reinforcement [of the creative person's
sense of his own identity] may be another part of the reason that the
creative person's work is essentially solitary.  moreover, creative people
learn, often through bitter experience, to be secretive.'

personal notes from 'creative accounting' - may 16, 1996


similarities between scientists and artists:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

        - both try to change the way people look at/perceive things

        - new discoveries in art or science cause revolutions in
          global thought

        - both consist of a large amount of experimentation, and leaps
          of faith

        - both artists and scientists are generally stereotyped as
          eccentrics or 'freaks' (this can be true in some cases)

        - both tend to be dedicated and genuinely interested in what
          they do, and enjoy doing it

        - the subjects of science and art tend to remain obscure or
          vague to the general public

sometimes i think that either there is no true art, or that EVERYTHING is
art.  art = creation of 'things'.

creation: a painting, a song, dance, a sculpture, a story, a shopping list,
a small cluster of toe-nail clippings in the corner of the bathroom, etc.
how does anyone claim that one of these is art and another isn't - or that
one form of 'art' is superior or more valid than another?  does it matter
if creation is a conscious action or a 'happy accident'?

this is all VERY stupid.
                        (she said, as...)

'a history of the modern movement art architecture design'
by kurt rowland
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

notes on paul klee:

to klee, changing, transforming shapes were the essence of an experience of
modern life.  he believed that art can no longer confine itself to
description, or even analysis, of superficial forms.  it must concern
itself with experience which is always changing - art is 'the prehistory of
the visible'.

klee: 'perhaps you may through [the study of] nature arrive at the point
where you can create your own...then one day you yourself may be a part of
nature; you will be able to create as she does.'

art to klee was not an extension of nature, but an analogy of nature.  the
work of art was an organism of its own, parallel to nature but not a part
of it, 'an imitation of the forces of nature, as a child imitates adults.'

'further notes on the conversion of expressive mediums:' (personal notes)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

(simile of expression?)

question: does an expressive piece, when scaled down to its most
basic/minimal form, have an equivalent in any other medium(s) of
expression?  into how many other mediums can the piece be successfully
converted/transferred with loss of impact?

example/experiment: say we have a painting of a primary red circle, 6" in
diameter (like a miniature japanese flag, without any meaning).  how can we
successfully convert this red circle into the medium of sound/music?  what
does a red circle (6") sound like?  what characteristics of the circle are
transferred into music - as in what is their equivalent? -- ex: - diameter
of circle = volume of sound; - infinite and constant perimeter of the
circle might represent a constant note or pitch, with infinite duration,
or, if it was electronic music, a looped sound; - the colour of the circle
might represent what instrument is to be used.
also, what is the difference between the sound of a red circle and a red
square?  what if the circle were blue?  what does an octagon sound like?
what about a 3-dimensional object (ex: tetrahedron)?

how could the red circle be converted into the medium of dance?  how can
the human body express the red circle through movement?

what if we converted the red circle into literary expression?  would the
expression be literal, or expressed with deep emotion in poetry, using
metaphors?  perhaps such a minimal visual object could be best expressed in
literary form through haiku poetry?

'decline of quality - or whatever' ("creative accounting) - may 27, 1996
ENTROPY

should i come to some sort of conclusion based on what i have written here?
not now - not while i am so apathetic.  i've had no urge to draw, paint,
write, or whatever in the past few days, what i have done was forced,
unsatisfactory.  i feel like looking at picture books all day - becoming a
sponge - hire someone to turn the pages and refill various beverages then
suddenly a big thing happens and stuff.  or whatever.



   'catch!'        .  o                'ok!'

it would be nice to visit a world of stick figures - a world
designed by children (with crayons).

ice cream
iced cream.. icicled cream
One day I ate so much ice cream,
that my body overfilled
and so ice cream began to trickle out of my nose..
down my chin.. my chest.. my legs..
to my toes
and from my ears, it trickled too..
my nose, my pores..
ice cream
it kept tasteing good.. I kept eating more
pressure building.. more entering in than leaving out..
a rumble.. a gurgle
my eyes shot out of the sockets in an icey cream fountain
my nose widened to become a cold cream faucet
but I continued to force more into myself
I eventually just collapsed into a quivering puddle of flesh and cream
melted ice cream
not iced anymore

"Graveyard School" - [Text Scrap]
`````````````````````````````````
"TB" & "comsumption" = Turberculosis

    Glassey-eyed and sad with consumption, they [artists] started the
"graveyard school of poetry". .. .  .

"youth grows pale, and spectre thin, and dies."

    The graveyard school drew some fantastic deductions about TB.  Its
members added up all the rattling "lungers" in their midsts and concluded
that Turberculosis had something to do with genius.  The link between
intellect and TB became so strong that even health writers such as [-]
pretended to be frail in order to look tragically hip.  [-], who peopled
his novels with consumptives,  didn't care much for the fad but new "it
was the fashion to suffer from the lungs" and "to spit blood after each
emotion that was sensational".. . . .   .  .

"render the delicacies, the exquisite melancholies, the rare and delicious
phantasies, of the vibrant cord of the heart and soul."

     In this unhealthy environment, peer pressure among the artists to get
sick or die of TB was intense.  In the 1800s, most writers and composers of
any merit seemed to be coughing their way to fame and an early grave.

the human species is clearly dominant in it's environment (the planet)..
dominant because humans are so muchly better equipped to deal with so many
things.. what they lack, they make up for with their technological exten-
sions (inventions -- the makers and the controllers)..
but could it be that they are too well equipped?  too fit to survive?
so as to go beyond the point of survival, and to inevitably gradualize
towards extinction..
that is to say that perhaps the human species, although it shot out far
ahead of the other species' with it's mental abilities and technological
products in the past ( -> present), will likely destroy itself -- and
possibly it's environment (they've certainly already damaged it) -- in
the process of surviving so WELL !
