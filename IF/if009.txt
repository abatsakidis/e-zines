Dreamscapes, 1996
(exerpts from dream journal - SPS)


A young girl (5-7 years old) is going to ride her bicycle around the globe.
I am her navigator, and sit behind her on her large bike, taking notes -
typing them into a laptop computer.  We are only 5 kilometres or less away
from completing our trip - we are headed towards a large public park where
we originally began our journey.  The girl picks up the walkie-talkie and
shouts, "We're almost there!" into it - and a boy on the other end who is
waiting at the park says, "You'll never make it!!"  As he speaks into the
walkie-talkie, I can see him standing in the park.  He is jealous, and
doesn't want the girl to complete the journey.  The girl begins to pedal
furiously, as I give her directions and advice on how to avoid obstacles
(construction ahead).  We are forced on a slight detour, but we eventually
make it, and many people (including the jealous boy) are at the park to
welcome us back.

                              *  *  *

I was in my room at night, during a heavy thunderstorm, my light bulbs
didn't work, so I used the illumination from the computer monitor in order
to see.  The phone rang, I picked it up, and a woman says (in french),
"This is France calling, will you accept the charges?", and I reply, saying
"Oui," with a wonderful french accent.  The woman asks me something partly
in french but then she starts over in english...I didn't understand, so I
just said, "Yes."  Then Karen was on the phone (she was on a vacation in
France), and I told her that my light bulbs didn't work.

                              *  *  *

Fragmented images from movies and television - a plane explodes flying over
the arctic, a life raft is deployed - inflating and floating down from the
burning plane, landing softly on the snow below - there is a woman on her
knees in the raft.  A man leaps out of the plane above, skydiving towards
the woman and the raft.  The plane crashes, and the man runs through the
air, curving and slowing down, landing on the snow mid-step.  He runs
towards the woman.  They are husband and wife.  He holds her tightly.  She
is pregnant, going into labour - holding her stomach in pain, knees spread
apart.  The man says, "We can't have the baby here, it'll freeze to death!"
He then uncovers a circular lid under the snow (opening into the sewer
system).  He opens the lid, and tells his wife to climb down into the
sewer: "It's warm down there," he says.  They sit at the bottom of the
staircase, with him besid her, the sewage water floats by, steaming.  The
woman sits part way into the sewage, it goes up to the base of her sternum.
The baby will be born underwater - "I can't give birth here," she says.
"You don't have a choice!" he says, pulling off her pants, then removing
her underwear.  The woman suddenly has a large (3 feet long) fish held
leaning on her shoulder, and she says, "This is too much to eat for the
both of us."  Her husband stands in the sewage up to his liver, and says,
"You know dear, this may not be an appropriate time, but I have to admit
that I am getting pretty horny seeing you like this!"  He unzips his pants
as he stares at his naked wife.

                              *  *  *

A dark, maybe candlelit room (no flicker of light as candles do though)
with maybe half a dozen male figures, all moving around (as if it were a
party).  Suddenly two identical but unrecognizable men pucker their lips
(light is shining on them, and my view zooms in on their faces), and they
very forcefully kiss each other.  At the speed at which their faces went
towards each other, they would have (in reality) broken several teeth and
perhaps their noses...But what happened instead was, as their faces hit,
they went into each other, becoming one face - it was like a metaphor, like
two unrelated concepts or personalities in my head fused, snapping together
in my mind.  The force and spontaneity of this imagery caused me to wake up
very suddenly, and as I woke up I did not feel tired or groggy - it felt as
if I had been awake for hours...full of energy.

                              *  *  *

I am frantically flipping through dozens of pages of my own writing, trying
to revise it, or come to some sort of conclusion.  Kept going back and
forth...confusion.

                              *  *  *

I was a social worker, trying to talk a girl out of committing suicide - she
wouldn't eat.  She said, "God won't let me."  (It was Good Friday.)  I told
her that God can't stop her from doing anything, and that we all had
choices, and that she could eat anytime she wanted to.  A nearby vending
machine spat out an orange, a sandwich, and a can of Coke.

                              *  *  *

I was playing a holographic video game - the holograms can be projected
anywhere, so I set it up in the stairwell of an apartment building.  I was
fighting with a holographic monster, when the holographic projection unit
suddenly failed, screwing up the imaging system.  In order to compensate,
the machine scanned the nearest person into its memory bank (me), and used
that as the projection.  So I was fighting a copy of myself, and everything
go really confusing.  I was kicking my twin in the face etc., when I
suddenly realized that I was the hologram.  Someone told me to feel around
my ear for abnormal skin growth.

                              *  *  *

Cylla Von Teidemann (sp?), me with her, conceiving ideas for fashion and
dance performance.  I was telling her about a dream that I had about
clothing that a girl was wearing - it was a sliver blouse made of unknown
material, it was like a mercurial liquid steel.  Whenever the dancer who
was wearing the blouse moved, it oozed, then reformed into its original
place when the dancer stopped moving.  The environment was white, brightly
lit, with no perspective or horizon (Cylla's photography studio?).

                              *  *  *

The Kraft company now sells family sized cans of Kraft Dinner, so you can
simply heat it up on the stove or in the microwave without having to cook
the noodles and add that powder cheese stuff.  It is my job to design their
new advertising campaign.

                              *  *  *

I am in a grocery store talking to a truck driver about saving money for
retirement.  He is saying that I could make $100,000 in working for three
years.  I am sort of smirking at him, because I don't care.  I have no
plans to retire.

Metaphorphasis
^~^~^~^~^~^~^~
Metaphor stands at the center of the art of poetry--and, in fact, the
center of ALL creative activity.  In a metaphor, one object or idea is
presented as a replacement for another.

(A simile is a more EXPLICIT metaphor:  An embrace is like an eye.)

Examples:
^~^~^~^~^
Sweetness is a skin.
Emotion is a cloud.
Wood is a flavour.
Hair is a sound.
Snake is a button.

< Jonathan was a finger faced puppet > Curtis Yateman

        The hooks in his back kept him in a certain bond with those who 
created him, he had never really noticed them until he reached the tender
age of about 12.  He looked at himself one day and realized that he held  
no individuality, no sense of himself.  
Dammit, he exclaimed.
Jonathan dyed his skin blue and felt the hooks tighten.  The pulled at his
muscles and he felt himself bleed.  Jonathan sought help.  He went to his 
good friend ( well, only friend, now that his skin was blue ) Todd, who had
and abundance of fingers growing from every pore in his body.  Todd was a 
bit older, 24 years.  Todd also did not have many friends because of his
deformity.  Todd told Jonathan that if he made himself abnormal ( or 
' freakish ' as society liked to say ) enough, the hooks would pull
themselves into oblivion.  Todd then offered to do the work himself.
        He took a purple switchblade knife and cut off 18 fingers that were 
growing from his kneecaps.  He then used the paste that one would use in
Kindergarden and pasted the fingers to Jonathan's boyish face.  
        Jonathan thanked Todd and then sang in glee as the hooks began to
pull.  They pulled, and pulled, and..

WHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

Jonathan was lifted into the sky and floated away, for his individual 
happyness took him to heaven.  The only proof of his existance was a sign 
left in Jonathan's room that exclaimed:

" DON'T CONFORM "

Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) - [text fragment]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the 1930s, a Hungarian psychiatrist named Ladislas Meduna speculated that
epilepsy and schizophrenia could not coexist in the same body.  On the basis
of this observation, which turned out to be inaccurate, Meduna theorized
that it might be useful to induce epilepsylike seizures in schizophrenic
patients.  Initially, a drug was used to trigger seizures.  However, by 1938,
two Italian psychiatrists (Cerletti & Bini) demonstrated that it was safer
to elicit the seizures with electric shock.  Thus, modern electroconvulsive
therapy was born, creating a peculiar tribuate to the old advertising slogan
"better living through electricity".

Selected Poems: May 01, 1996 - May 15, 1996
(by Gideon Hartwell)


The following collection of fifteen poems, written in the first half of
this month are submitted for the perusal of your readers.  Most were
written very spontaneously, either scribbled in notebooks or on scraps
of loose paper, or sometimes written directly on the computer.  Although
most of them are nothing more than small gardens of imagery, some
originate from real events that occurred on the day that they were written
(poem numbers six, seven, and thirteen are examples of this).  Poem
numbers fourteen and fifteen were made by pulling individual words at
random from a jar.

-----

ONE.

he conversion


feeling as though loving a mannequin
combing his eyebrows with moistened finger-
tip, wanting to crash land on
                             planet feminine
(unsure of own origin)
hope returns
a soggy worm clinging to the hook
(a life with so much misery
                           enough to write
                           a book)
often thinking of cutting it off himself
a large pair of scissors

later cured with a vitamin

-----

TWO.

it is before the day awakes,
that i walk down the side of
this mountain, following the
somersaulting rivers, skating
down slopes of pebbles,
taking detours of sporadic/
spontaneous interest.

it isn't until hours later that
i climb back to you, waking you
with the subtle smell of melting
butter, forcing you to share so
many of my dimensions. eternity
isn't enough.

-----

THREE.

somewhat like white roses


building an icelandic garden
blooming rocks their
reflective petals hold my eyes
playing the game of staring
the game of sharing
eternities
collision of realities
hope to become something
anthropomorphic
in comparison to anything
my death like a smile of
sincere amusement from rita
hayworth
with whom i dance
the rocks like eggs reminding
me of beginnings keeping
in tune with what vibrates which
includes everything as far
as our accumulated knowledge
is concerned
sensual rocks
do you shiver when i rub you
your heat transfers to me
higher concentration to lower
the bridge those spirits that
sleep underneath
tickle car tires giving them
good luck in a world
that needs it
desperately your minimalist stare
scanning the fractals of
my iris
your surface area with the
pretense of endurance
soap films shattered on blades
of grass
as if
i say
hugging your shores while
your thoughts inundate me

-----

FOUR.

december 25, 2043 a.d.
(for ron scrivani)


raising glasses of cider
we almost toast his forever
humility, 
standing beside
apple tree hologram

flickers rotates
in phases,
our clockwork universe

shudder,
thinking of days when
actions spoke louder
(like that guy they nailed
to the tree)

whatizname?
(thoughts ferment, as the
cider)

"anyway," someone says,
"happy birthday, isaac newton!"

in praise,
thanking him: we are the
equal and opposite.

-----

FIVE.

the water whispers her
time away
hair that sheds
songs echo back from
the depths of
sink
happiness twirls down
the tornado chamber
and away clogging
memory

(No Title)
(Leo X)


'Kwack, Kwack' exclaimed Teak, whilst waddling about like a ducky-duck
would.

Teak's Master had always thought it odd the way that his dog kwacked and
walked like that.  And he'd never quite known why he would often find Teak
flapping his paws, or returning home dripping of pond-sog.  So, he just
stared stupidly, as his pet dog waddled away in a ducky-dog way. Teak was,
as had become customary, taking a trip to visit his kwacky friends at a
nearby pond.  The fact that they would always fly away didn't seem to
bother him.  Thought would have revealed that they were afraid of a dog,
if Teak were caring or capable enough of doing it.
The joy of pond-floating was more than enough for Teak anyhow.

Teak's Master had always been disturbed by his pet's behaviour.  But could
never quite figure out what or why exactly it was.
The Teak puzzle always managed to elude him.
So, after much internal debate and time, Teak's Master chose to bring his
dog in for a visit to an 'Animalus Psychologis'.
After all, he had taken more malard-madness from Teak than he could deal
with.  The Psychologist determined -- after a quaint chat, and various
profile examinations -- that Teak, for reasons not yet known, thought
himself to be a duck.  Now this did not come as much of a surprise to
Teak's Master.  On the contrary, it seemed incredibly obvious.  What a
silly fooly Master he felt himself to be.  The Psychologist recommended
that Teak have a few other healthy dogs for canine company, and to deny
Teak contact with real ducks.  Teak's Master was happily obedient.  He
purchased two dogs, and created a prison of sorts out of his home.

It was hell to Teak from the very start.
Anti-duck confinement.  Imprisoned in a canine training centre.
Teak wished only to float freely amongst the reeds like a real big,
glowing swan.
Weeks passed before Teak had his escape opportunity.
The Master was off some place, doing some thing, and the doggies were
quite absorbed in chasing a ball about elsewhere.
Teak, being quite an intelligent dog, imitated The Master's method of
door opening -- that is, the handle turn method -- and...
<click>
freedom!
Teak waddled like the wind to the pond.

Oh, how he had missed the glorious sparkling pond.  Teak kwacked a kwack
of glee!  He playfully dipped his webbed feet into the shimmering pond
water.  It felt cool, natural, beautiful.
<blast>
Teak, contemplating a full-body dunk, didn't even feel a pitter patter of
bullets tear through his skull.  There wasn't enough time for him to.
What was once the head of a dog, became a scattered assortment of flesh
bits 'n 'bits, blood, and hair.

Teak's Master laughed triumphantly and spread the reeds to get a better
look at his kill.
Revelation hit him like an ice cream truck (wham!).
He sobsobsobbed and boohoohooed.
(Because he blamed the ducks for Teak's condition, he had developed
hatred for them.  And so, he had also developed an interest in the sport
of duck hunting. The possibility of this error was never even considered.)
Even a mad Teak was better than no Teak at all!
It was quite an upsetting couple of minutes for Teak's former Master. That
is, until he realized that he would never have to worry about Teak again,
and he that had two sane, barking, drooling dogs at home anyway.
The drooly dogs Master happily skipped home.

He and his two dogs lived a lovely, joyful life.....
while Teak's disfigured remains decomposed into the bank of what was once
his favourite pond.

                                  Proposal
                            (by Astrix Beauton)

                   "I would like you to be me," she said,
                     clasping me with all possibility,
                        as if my ego would collapse
                   without the aid of a demolition crew.
                         Her smile would be enough.
                  I suggested that "we can be us instead,"
                      in a way that denied conversion
                    (something transparent in her eyes).
                   In some ways, when our heads collide,
                  I half expect customers to give witness.
                          It happens daily, this.

                When desire waterfalls, a suitable impetus,
                        one could transpire secrets,
                      secrets of harmonious unloving,
                  where light is absorbed more than usual
             ("...the crotch of your pants soaked with urine,")
                   is how I described the moment to her,
                          unlike others previous.
                Not understanding, she said something like,
                     "We are cast from the same mould,"
                        which made me laugh inside.
                     My hands plunged through the gaps
                             under her armpits,
                   wrapping around in unified informity.

                            "Are all like you?"
                          "I am all," I answered,
                       as if what she said were true.
                   Her chin impressed my shoulder ditch,
                     talking behind each other's backs,
                             as if we were two.

"YERF"
(anonymous)


    It was like a yerbit I tell you.  Yerbits!  but like no yerbit I ever
seen or been.  Know what I mean?  Not even them mutant yerbits you some-
times see javexing with the Wurgumpets!
    Might as well just say that It was like nothing that I layed my eyes
upon.  I should.  I really should.  But it wasn't!  It was like, more or
less than that you see.
    Anyway, I might just as well give up on attempting to explain the
un-explainable.  That is, attempt to bring into the realm of reason, that
which doesn't belong, nor even fit there.
    But It -- I will refer to It as 'Yerf' -- also had a real nice set of
bloobyhumpetts on it.  I been looking for a pair like that for reewps!
Reewps and reewps and reewps!
    I tried to make it a deal -- barter with it if you will -- but it would
accept neither Ribders, nor Sazzits.  Which basically left me with nothing
to offer The Yerf.  I would have done the same in It's situation.
