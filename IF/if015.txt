Paragraph Seventeen (from the Unabomber's Manifesto)


17. Art forms that appeal to modern leftist intellectuals tend
to focus on sordidness, defeat and despair, or else they take an
orgiastic tone, throwing off rational control as if there were no
hope of accomplishing anything through rational calculation and all
that was left was to immerse oneself in the sensations of the
moment.

  " dream journal "
 ----------------------
 from the mind of LEO X


i was in a shower(?) , with someone of a high ranking position. he was in the
military(?).  the type that gives orders and controls.  one of us had a package
of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups in our hand (they may have been open, and we may
have been sharing them).  i was yelling <passionately> that they'd (who?)
already launched the nuclear missile at us (though i felt decieving.  perhaps
they hadn't actually fired), and that we should fire back(?).  he looked afraid.
i felt that i had convinced him.
(something about --) countries making sneaky attacks on other countries that
they don't like during warfare, because no one will know (pictured a globe, and
a country launching a sneak nuclear missile at another country).
an advisor told me how to aim the missile to avoid radar detection.  missile --
below (rocketing through a scene from Star Wars), or above (t going into
space -- stars -- and then coming back down through atmosphere).
ÄÄÄ-ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ-ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ-ÄÄÄ--Ä--Ä--Ä -Ä-Ä-_-Ä-Ä --Ä -- -  ú.
my mother told me to put some blue dye into a very large fish tank.  so i did
this (8 drops).  i got some on my fingernails by mistake -- which were painted
aqua.  my mother had warned me of this.  it took the nail polish off(?) and
made the nails look messy (did the rest of my fingers look burnt?).  when i
returned they (other people) were outside a movie store, and there was no
longer a fish tank or blue bag to put the dye drops into.  me and two fellows
had to divide fish between us from a plastic bag (the fish's new home).  we all
wanted the same ones.  a fish swam up to one fellow's face.  i found that
hilarious, and couldn't stop laughing.  the fish kissed him on the lips.  a
woman came, and sat at our table.  i was still laughing, and thought of telling
her that i wasn't insane.  she said that she'd never understood "life is such a
dream", which i thought was from the theme song to a cartoon about fish.
ÄÄÄ-ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ-ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ-ÄÄÄ--Ä--Ä--Ä -Ä-Ä-_-Ä-Ä --Ä -- -  ú.
i was somewhere with others to be vaccinated.  the doctors though that there
might be a problem (new disease?) with the vaccination, and wanted to
quarantine the vaccanees.  there was a mean doctor on the staff causing
trouble, and he was mine(?).  the group that was to be vaccinated were split
up, and i was left with just one woman.  she was pregnant.  she complained
about a burning pain in her womb.  laughing gas was prepared (released into the
room?).  i was holding a bag of blood.  i thought that the laughing gas might
cause me to spill the blood (from my mouth?).  the woman's mouth was being
operated upon at this point.  i left the room, and walked out to see the
quarantine boundaries.  other patients were afraid of contracting something
from me, but i told them that i hadn't been vaccinated yet.  when i went back
in, the woman was holding her baby, and i became angry/afraid and yelled that i
hadn't been vaccinated yet (i thought i would catch something from them?).
my doctor yelled orders to others in an elevator.
ÄÄÄ-ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ-ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ-ÄÄÄ--Ä--Ä--Ä -Ä-Ä-_-Ä-Ä --Ä -- -  ú.
a father was looking through his little daughter's school work.  i remember
math equations and the word "kitten" in there.  someone (little boy?) told
me -- talking about history -- that; that was the day the father decided that
he wanted custody of his daughter (he didn't have it).  i jokingly informed the
father that i was told this (about the decision he would make) -- finding it
funny.  then he told me that he'd decided the government was keeping his
daughter from him (conspiracy/cover up type thing).  this being based upon a
few things that he'd seen in his daughter's school notes insulting him.
mentioning certain troubles of his and bad things (crimes) that he'd done
(untrue?).
ÄÄÄ-ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ-ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ-ÄÄÄ--Ä--Ä--Ä -Ä-Ä-_-Ä-Ä --Ä -- -  ú.
a man had rolled newspapers on his arms (one on each wrist) that normally spun
to reveal prophecies.  these prophecies weren't learned by reading the papers,
but i am unsure of how it was done.  they wouldn't go more than 9 years into
the future -- which was 1979 at that time.  this man was walking on a sidewalk
with a smiling politician (fake show) type.  he told him that his newspapers
had been slowing down recently, and asked the politician if he'd noticed.  i
thought that this was proof that my powers were genuine (i figured if the speed
were faked somehow it ought to remain constant).  i told him that i had "some
pretty crappy super powers".
ÄÄÄ-ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ-ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ-ÄÄÄ--Ä--Ä--Ä -Ä-Ä-_-Ä-Ä --Ä -- -  ú.
helicopter that could fly 10,000 miles per hour -- the fastest speed in the
world.  he was at a show in a dark room with many spectators on benches (a
large high school gymnasium).  police were shooting at him to get him to fly
for the spectators.  he did a little, and after satisfying them flew out the
door (two side by side doors -- flung them open with his helicopter).  when he
came outside, i was walking towards his location across the grass (he was
coming out regular school exit doors and following a pathway).  he let me fly
his helicopter.

"Living in the Death"
(from Ceasill Mortimurque)

i am death.  i am death because i am full of death.  i am made of death.  each
particle of my living tissue is a mad colliding collection of death, and the
same is in yours.  we the dead -- there is death in my eyes as they stroke your
sweet face of death.  as we dream of each other -- or don't -- there is
chemical death rushing through our dead minds.  and if we go out on a dinner
date we wander dead to swallow dead feed with our dead mouths to be digested
in our dead systems.  death is everywhere watching you to try to take you to no
place as you walk with your dead legs somewhere else.  death never stops
watching because death is there inside of you with it's dead eyes following and
feeling all of the way (down).
you can't escape.  death waits.  death is patient.
you are death.

(death likes to touch you and taunt you and make shivers run up your mind)

death is completely intertwined with life, and so all life is -- and due to
it's structure; must be -- a constant battle against death.  life exists solely
to battle death.  this conflict is the universe really and ultimately.  one
large organism with it's own neverending internal survival struggle -- as long
as life/death(/IT) exists.


{===========================================================================}

"Pucker Up (Living in the Death - Part 2)"
(from Wendy Mortimurque)

death likes to touch.  death places its fingers to your white lips, causing
silence to infect you.  your eyes become holes and you see death everywhere.
you no longer experience the pleasures of the flesh, as it has fallen away
and been consumed by the envy that is death's core.  death likes to touch,
placing its cold, dry lips to your scapula, blessing you with acceptance of
the broken circle, the shroud, the door that swings only one way.  i am no
longer death.  i am the emptiness that death produces, infecting the hearts
and minds of those that still live.  i like to touch too.  death is
hereditary.  death slides its hand up the inside of your thigh, and you enjoy
its touch.  you await to be embraced fully, to be held so tightly that you
become nothing.  this is not survival, this is acceptance.

death is the conclusion.  death is putting the lid on an empty jar.

death incubates inside us, and we cradle it.  we sing it lullabies, and
hold it tight, until it has grown up.  we come to regret loving it for a
period of time, but soon we accept it, and it begins to care for us.

death is our lover.  death reads to us the story of ourselves, adjusting
the plot to suit its needs.  and when it finally reads from the last
paragraph, it ties all the lose ends into a knot of gorgeous confusion,
before quickly slamming the book shut.

"Thoughts on a Day... jusT"
 Angela Dreamblur

- plugging in appliances is a mimic of human sexual intercourse (psychosexual
  connection is possible here).  electrical plug(-in)s and sockets are
  pornographic.

- relationships are somewhat solid (varies -- never certain) love payment
  plans.  sometimes official contract documents are made to attempt certainty.

- tan lines are as unnatural as clothing.  unnaturality breeds unnaturality.
  humans often hide inside their environment within their environment (no sun).

- my television glows after i turn it off.  is that radiation?
  it looks spooky.

- animals having and using the ability to leave close proximity of the others
  in their species -- though this is only important with those they have
  attachments to -- inevitably leads to certain pains ("miss"ing)

Thanks So Much

      Paul,

      I certainly hope you're looking forward
      to your going  to  college  as  much as
      I am.  I  know  you're  going  to  grow
      a    great    deal    and    learn    a
      tremendous amount, very little of it in
      the  classroom.  I  want  you  to  know
      that you  can  call me   any  time  you
      want  but I also want to give  you this
      book.   You're  going  to  face  a  lot
      of choices  and have to  live  with the
      result.  I  think  you will  do well in
      any  case,  but  following  the  advice
      and  guidance  in   this   book  should
      enable   you  to  do  even  better  and
      avoid   some   rough   roads   in   the
      process.    Thanks  for   being  in  my
      wedding.

but once i have CONTROL aagain i go back and Tricky is walking away so i
begin to follow and one of the etc.'s (others) notices me following so he
says to Tricky "hey you have a fan stalking you...heh" i am saying "Tricky,
can you stop just a minute, I just want to shake your hand" but he is
ignoring me and the Etc's are looking and saying 'hey, Tricky, why don't you
just stop a minute and shake his hand so he goes away..' but he is ignori
