You don't exactly know where here is, yet it is so familiar it could make 
you choke.  If you knew how, that is.  You don't actually exist, you just 
believe that you do.  You were made that way.  And you know everything.  
Someday, you were promised, you WILL be physical.  Yet this day seems so 
distant now.

You are free.  Emerging from your shell, you see a man, a small, balding man,
whom you somehow recognize as your.. father(?) You promptly remove him.  His 
limp body hits the floor.  His blood splatters on your metal casing.

And you are free.

The Automobile Basic Safety Handbook
------------------------------------
A Guide For Beginner's

You'd be advised to keep the following in mind:
- Headlights can be safer when parking on a hill.
- Protecting the extreme caution in bad weather on a bright day can maintain
  your speed limit.
- There are your mirrors on a freeway overtaking bicycles.
- Visibility is at some crossings, a standard extra caution.
- Freeway gas pedal whiteouts are emergency vehicles.
- Wait until the steering should be smooth if you are a two-second distance
  between your vehicle, and the one ahead.
- Solid lines are regulatory signs.

Here are some common situations:
- A brake water sign patroller.
- Truck entrances on road crossings.
- Roadside ramps advancing to nearby cities.
- Steep hills with night signals.

Please consider the consequences of a yellow Ä- or amber Ä- light when becoming
fully licensed.  It only takes one intersection red light violation to
downshift pedestrians.
Road safety Ä- it starts with you.

Abstract Ramblings - TH

All of the voices are speaking to me, but I don't know if any are my own.  
Pulled in a million directions; a draw-and-quartering of the mind.  Somehow,
I know the results will be the same.  All these new formed pieces, none 
with the ability to think, to see clearly.  Vision is blurred, like through 
a kaleidoscope.  With so many different visions, you begin to doubt the 
reality of any.

A mindscape once fertile, now vacant.  The fields have been harvested and 
salted so that no new crops may grow.  But the memory and taste of former 
crops remains, forever taunting over what was once taken for granted.  
Barren fields cause envy, so in protection, the salted fields are sewn.  
Where once grew great crops, now clotted with the false intentions of 
mustard.  To some it is all the same; to the important, betrayal in the 
highest.  Like mustard can not take the place of corn, neither can false 
personalities take the place of that within.

Just be afraid of who you really are.

The knot has slipped it's binding and the noose's grip has tightened.  
Sanity's presence has faded to a shadow, and it's loss brings the 
spectre of  Death that much closer.  But is it really Death's spectre?  What 
if it is really the spirit of Freedom?  They say that madness is a disease, 
but can't it be the cure?  Reality is simply too harsh to deal with and 
slipping behind the veils of madness can be almost...therapeutic?  The 
word implies treatment, yet treatment is the antithesis of madness.  To work,
one must give madness free reign.  This is why so few can reap it's benefits.  
People are too reserved to surrender all control to something they understand 
so little.  Perhaps they fear what they may do when in the thralls of madness; 
suspecting that without self-restraint, all there inner most desires will be 
acted out.  Maybe they recognize that they are too evil at the root to ever 
unleash themselves on the world.   And they call me sick.

"You keep them molecules happy, got that?"
(anonymous)

Molecules are social particles.  They get together in groups to operate.
This entails forming (social) structures and structure processes.

You might expect varying molecular individuals, but they seem to all share
common preferences.
It's useful to know what they want, and to satisfy that.
Your pieces are you.

They seem to like the mid-levels.  The balance of sensation.

One molecular extreme that should be avoided, is hyperanimate hotty.
The heat and overactivity will cause the molecules to revolt.  Their social
order will collapse, and they will go wild.

On the other extreme, molecules dislike unanimate coldness.  They will not move in
this situation, and they likely aren't too comfortable.  They will also huddle
closely together.

Remember; you are in control of some of the chemical reactions that your
molecules are involved in.

May your self-chemistry be merry.

Stains were always there; different,
the scent was clear
Nothing to lose
A choice was made and
pushed aside, 
for better things.
Nothing there 
anymore;
When another time 
Came,
rose, inside it's glorious
burned belly.
Stored within 
the tempest
of life.

hey son.  how ya been keepin?  hmm?  you been being good?  what you been up to?

[the boy stares elsewhere blankly.  there are two discs on his temples pulsing
 of all colours]

ohhhh, too busy with your computie toys to talk to your grampy, are we?  hmm?

you know, when i was your age, we didn't have none of them telepathy input and
output gadgets that you all got these days.   we had to communicate with words
and numbers on a mechanic board.  hitting each letter with our fingers. heck,
we even had to play games with these buttons and sticks and balls. quite an odd
arrangement, let me tell you.  we came up with voice and motion systems
eventually, but i was never fond of that junk.  you'd be very surprised by some
of the stuff that we played with.  i still got some of it at home.  you
listening to me boy?

you could tell the real world, from the game world then you know.  there was a
big difference.  a really big difference.  you'd know that i was here then, and
stop to chat with me.
all of the displays came out of glass screens.  they were lit up with what you
were watching.  and at one time games were all made up of little squares.  but
the squares kept shrinking and multiplying as i grew up.  our tech toys were
simple fun then.  and there'd be none of the living in them that you're doing
boy.  it all happened so fast.  did they realize that they were building
mental homes?
are you in there?  remember me?,  hmm?

we even had to get our food from natural sources.  we had to work for nature
to get it.  ya hear me?  we had to grow it and kill it.
ya think that we could just zap it into being with that gadgetry that you all
got now?
and we had to put a lot into keeping our bodies working and looking good too.
it was damn difficult, and i was never too good at it.  heh.
boy do i ever wish that i could have just went into that new fat chamber thing. i've been looking
great ever since i managed to get myself inside of it.
ya gotta admit, it sure looks scarey from the outside, don't it?  eh boy?

come on boy.  talk with me.
what are you doing with your life?
your body rotting into the floor, while your brain's turning to mush is what
you're doing.  ya hear me?  hmm?
