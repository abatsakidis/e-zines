the amount of fresh air up here is overwhelming.

i see her, the woman you described.
she is wearing the same green dress that you told
me about.

she appears to be lost in thought, although it's
difficult to make out her face from here.

what was her name again? oh yeah, elizabeth.
man, she's a graceful beast.

are you sure she's the one you want?
ok, ok.  pass my my gun, will you?

                              (Astrix Beauton)


                     i am in a field of green grass not
                   in any country every country! i am in
                       every country of my world and
                 any other world that i wish to include at
                   the last minute is here with me too if
                        they exist or not in reality
                  or in dream. this field is a lucid dream
                         made into dream reality it
                     is a universe caught in time lapse
                      photography flowers are blooming
                   spewing and i am noticing pollen stuck
                      to me bees swarm and collect it,
                 my pollen and sweat forming sacs on their
                       legs. i am fertile i fertilize
                     the next generation of flowers all
                      about. i am this sun and i never
                thought that uv ray penetration could be so
                      divine and deadly both at once!
                 how does nature stand being so beautiful?
                      i want to be nature too! i want
                   to be nature. let me! the bees dance,
                     and i dance with them they show me
                   the way to me they show me the the way
                                i calculate
                    nature is a calculator! nature is a
                  calculator and so am i! i am nature. it
                           snows and begins again
                 this is a world where everything is always
                      beginning nothing ends it's just
                  a circle! nature is a circle! nature is
                    a circle, and so am i! i am a circle
                                i am nature!
                                i am nature.

                              (Astrix Beauton)


                      boom thump and whine the strings
                 "whine," the strings say. when they whine
                   i get all soft and mushy and and they
                    keep things in order making sure the
                       probability of moshing is low
                                sentimental
                      i dance with a woman in a black
                dress! a black dress in a great great grand
                        ballroom with a great great
                    grand circle of strangers i hold one
                     hand in hers and the other around
                  her waist we twirl and dip watching the
                   circle of smilies blur teeth white and
                              the band climax
                   boom boom zing! and the strings whine!
                  they are singing now they are singing to
                         my mistress in my arms and
                   me we twirl and dip two people dressed
                  in black the band plays really loud like
                  a submachine gun strings still singing!
                       and we twirl and dip we twirl
                 and dip in a circle of smilies! i am still
                   happy. how high is the ceiling in this
                    ballroom anyway? twirl boom dip thud
                  whine go the strings "whine," they say.

while)

0 : [gratitude, love]
D : are you ready?.... this will prick slightly, but it's certainly much

v2.00
flowing a stalwart voltaical stream through a creature's brains appears to
be a utilitarian therapeutic of frigid meloncholia.  in this methodology,
generally labelled voltaic-paroxysm jolt, voltrodes are affixed to a
patient's skull and a stream fluctuating from 7 to 130 elecs is smeared for
one-tenth to one hemi-second.  this engenders a paroxysm comprised of a
swift taughtening of the physique.  entirety of the sinews constrict
simultaneously, the arms and legs are launched outward, and the ensemble
skeleton metamorphs stiff.  this is superseded by a professed clonic
juncture, in which there are lightweight paroxysms and twitching
constrictions of the arms and legs.  the brimful paroxysm persists for one-
hemi to an entire minute.  subsequent the paroxysm, the creature lingers
comatose for some spell -- spanning ten and thirty minutes -- and upon
awakening is lethargic, befuddled, and recurrently has a headache and
supplementary afflictions.

Her Fury
(anonymous)


In darkness I remembered,
the reflections of shit in the
garden pond. Furious.
Faces/Feces: These words so a-
like. It was a period in life
(MINE) where I wanted to move
to a small town in northern
Canada and open a bookstore (all
my customers wearing tuques; beer
in hand). Furious, she raised
an offended eyebrow. She touched,
knocking me into a pile
of cardboard boxes. Ouch. OUCH!
Furious, radioactive. I ran,
splashing, nervous. In darkness
I remembered,
Chocolate candy kisses. Furious.
