the path to deviation...                                                      
                                                                              
     several months ago a guy who went by the name belial joined my little    
 art group, blade. he was a writer, contributing to the literature section    
 of blade, a division which i myself had dabbled in from time to time. i      
 was never very excited about my writing, it was just something that started  
 one day out of the boredom of algebra two. i wrote poetry here and there,    
 never thinking much about what i wrote or the meanings hidden deep within.   
 it was just something that came to me, and if i happened to have a pen in    
 my hand it would go down on paper. getting back to belial, he was someone    
 who i quickly took a liking to, most probably because of our similar tastes  
 and ideas. he never got too deep into the art scene, where i had been        
 slowly making my way to recognition over the past few years. instead, belial 
 found another scene, one which i was completely unaware of and oblivious     
 too. he released a zine called 'klunk' and naturally spread it to my board,  
 one of the few big local 908 bbs'. he urged me to read it, and i did,        
 interested in the prospects of an all text electronic magazine. sure, i had  
 read tons of electronic magazines, but they were always coded with fancy     
 graphics and effects, never daring to deviate from talking about their       
 respective scenes. klunk opened my eyes to a new world, one where creative   
 writing was widely distributed and people didn't dwell on the happenings of  
 their scene.                                                                 
     klunk seemed to give way to more zines gracing my download areas on      
 alderaan. 'y0lk' showed up shortly after, then 'pork' and other new zines    
 that had caught on to the craze. i read them all, laughing aloud at times    
 and occasionaly marveling at a deep thought. without realizing the full      
 scope of this new found media, i released my own zine, 'dreaming in          
 digital'. i modeled it after those zines which i had been reading, kicking   
 up the cheeze facter a few hundred percent and spouting my ideas in no       
 particularly formed manner. needless to say, apart from the really rad       
 file_id.diz, it was a failure. i didn't give it much thought, and continued  
 with my business in the ansi scene, occasionally peaking into that zine      
 thing to check up on things. i didn't have all the time in the world, so i   
 read less and less and fell behind on current releases.                      
     i got a message from belial one day. apparently, a few people were       
 getting together at his house and he wondered if i might be able to make it. 
 it was my first chance to put some faces on the names, and i naturally       
 accepted the oppertunity. i'd be lying if i said i got what i expected when  
 i showed up at marc's house. there, on the porch, was belial, edicius,       
 lucifer and some guy named cerkit, who i had never met or even heard of.     
 grey hawk showed up, things settled in, and we all had a pretty fun          
 afternoon. these guys were quite cool, and, although i had reservations upon 
 showing up, i was glad i had made these new friends.                         
     i'm no wiz with chronoligy, but i believe it was after this 'fest' that  
 belial and cerkit joined forces on a new zine called 'slinky'. i was very    
 interested in this, particularly because slinky was formed on the ideal      
 of being different. it was more intellectual, more creativity based than     
 comedy based. at that original fest, i took a liking to cerkit. he was a     
 damn cool guy, both creative and intellectual while remaining downright      
 funny. slinky was sure to reflect that, and i watched with anticipation for  
 the first issue to come around. it did, and it lived up to my expectations.  
 it wasn't like klunk, or y0lk, or pork. it was different, and i liked that.  
     by this time, i was growing more and more fond of this 'zine scene. i    
 still had no clue what dto was, or pez, or hoe, or any other 'zines for      
 that matter. i had heard of cdc, but never even saw a copy, let alone        
 realize what it was all about. i started peaking into #zines on irc, scoping 
 out the scene, checking out the people. slinky issue 2 was released, and     
 proved to be even better than the first. from there, things get a little     
 fuzzy. it seems as if the events from there leading up to now got all        
 smooshed up and compacted into one big memory. i started hanging out with    
 belial and edicius on weekends, and cerkit came around to 908 often enough   
 for me to get to know him. irc proved to be a means for really getting to    
 know these guys, learning what made them and their 'zines tick. i got        
 into writing some more, and got wrapped up in alot of 'zine like things.     
 i started reading dto and jonas, and peaking at random issues of hoe and     
 cdc. i was really liking what i found in this scene, and i was sure i would  
 eventually be a part of it.                                                  
     somewhere during this time, a larger fest type thing occured, and i got  
 to meet the likes of mogel, ilsundal, kurdt, metalchic, and pip the angry    
 youth. it was right then that the 'zine scene really piled into me like a    
 ton of bricks. these guys were cool, intelligent, and creative; such a       
 breath of fresh air after being stuck in the monotany of the ansi scene for  
 so long.                                                                     
     i got more and more involved in the whole 'zine type atmosphere, hanging 
 out in #zines, chillin' with cerkit and belial. i was writing and likeing    
 it, making friends and growing accustomed to the ways. i submitted an        
 abstract piece to slinky, and as it turns out belial and cerkit seemed to    
 really like it and i was convinced that i would continue writing and         
 participating in the whole 'zine thing.                                      
     a few weeks ago, i was on the phone with belial and cerkit three-way,    
 and they brought up the proposal of merging slinky with jonas, bringing      
 me on as the fourth in an ensemble of editors. edicius went for it and       
 soon after 'legacy' was born. it all happened rather fast, and both          
 slinky and jonas released their 'final' issues, yielding to the future of    
 legacy e'zine. belial was working hard on the idea, and legacy issue one     
 was coming along. this point was something of the calm after the storm of    
 all our personal problems in life. alot of shit had happened over those last 
 few weeks, and it seemed to all blow over in light of happier, more          
 entertaining times. no more problems, no more reasons to talk.               
     communication between the legacy staff got scarce. cerkit lost his       
 computer in a freak snowboarding accident (don't ask), belial got a job      
 (eek!), and i had alot of stuff going on with both school and all my other   
 computer related duties. the timing was all wrong, and cerkit brought that   
 up. he backed out of the venture, and at first we were all pretty pissed     
 about it. i suppose i was the next in line to see the light, and i quickly   
 agreed with what cerkit had been telling me. legacy was born with all the    
 wrong timing, and we all pretty much agreed on that. in essence, legacy      
 died, jonas and slinky were re-born, and i was left with some unreleased     
 pieces with no where to go. deviate was actually born out of my initial      
 fury for the legacy split. sure, i calmed down, but the idea just seemed     
 so appropriate for the time. i was ready to venture off on my own and try    
 my hand at spouting my thoughts and ideas.                                   
                                                                              
and so it goes...                                                             
                                                                              
     i wanted to write a 'zine. i wanted to take part in this scene that i    
 had so quickly been engulfed in. i wanted to experiment with my writing,     
 perhaps even bringing some influences from other scenes i had partaken in.   
 the problem with that is that there are alot of 'zines out there. just as    
 in the ansi scene, everyone wants to start their own venture with the        
 proposition of making it different, giving it appeal and making it last.     
 nearly three years ago i started my own ansi group, and it has lasted. today 
 i start my own 'zine, so aptly titled 'deviate', for it is my will to get    
 away from the norm, follow a different path, go where i want to go. i want   
 it to be different, i want it to have appeal. but do i want it to last? i    
 really don't know. it's an experiment, something new to me. today, i doubt   
 that it will last as long as my others projects have. but it will be a       
 stepping stone to better things, the first pencil stroke in the writing      
 of my legacy. dare to deviate.

     blocks. you know, those four-sided, two-dimensional, rectangular things? 
 yeah, those.  my world is made of them.  however, our blocks have a fourth   
 attribute: color.  that's right, colored blocks.  we've been to your world.  
 we  know all about it.  your  feeble minds  cannot  comprehend our two -     
 dimensional space, our blocks, our COLORED blocks. your eyes cannot see, for 
 you have never been exposed to the vibrant glow of electrons as they explode 
 into ballads of vivid color. oh yes, we know all about you and your kind.    
                                                                              
     life was always  good here.  conflict was a  concept we did not know.    
 peacefully,  we lived our lives as we pleased, going  this way and that,     
 acting as we saw fit. then you came.  you, and your friends, and their       
 friends, and soon the entire race.  our world, our beautiful world of color, 
 was destroyed. you moved us, aligned us, made us stand where we did not wish 
 to stand.  you killed us, you controlled us, and never even knew we were     
 there. you saw our bodies, but not our souls.  we gave you the gift of color 
 and how do you repay us? by destroying the very fabric of our existance.     
                                                                              
     we have dealt with your intrustion, we have coped, we have played along. 
 but that will be no more.  we observed your race, we learned over the years. 
 we watched as you destroyed our friends, we watched as you destroyed your    
 own friends.  we absorbed the information you gave us and we have entered    
 your mind on the darkest of nights.  collectively, we have learned that your 
 race is devoid of peace. you live for conflict while denying it ever happens 
 at all.  this conflict you will not be able to deny.  this conflict will be  
 your last.  we have uncovered your weaknesses, you will suffer at the hands  
 of those who you have made to suffer. it is time for a revolution.

 you have already been defeated, but we want more.  we want control.  your

 more.  our population is growing.  our combined intelligence is expanding on 
 yours exponentially, and we will not stop there.  your power has already     
 begun to erode.                                                              
                                                                              
     technological advance has been a driving force in your society since its 
 beginning,  but little do you realize that we control your most valued of    
 technologies. our society of colored blocks controls your realm of zeros and 
 ones. we control your trusted networks.  the power that we weild is the sole 
 propellant behind the electrons that flow meaninglessly through your         
 processors. you call them your computers, we call them our gateways to       
 revolution.

     you ask what we will do with the power once we obtain it. you ask how we 
 will keep it pure, free from the sins of your own reign.  but our quest is   
 different than yours.  ours is not the crusade for individual power, rather  
 it is that of the collective.  together we  will  work to  create a free     
 environment. our domination will show you truth, a quality you have lacked   
 since day one. do not expect us to ever relinquish our control. this planet  
 is ours now. you have lost this battle. this revolution is ours.

     my life changed one day when my wife changed one day. or is that the     
 other way around? i'm really not quite sure, for i only know what the facts  
 tell me and right now they tell me (and you, in this bizarre case) that, in  
 the scope of a single day, my wife became a super bitch and i became a super 
 hero. i'm still pondering whether these two occurances are relative to one   
 another. in any case, i haven't seen her since. it seems that she has gotten 
 herself caught in a terribly hard to find surreality vortex.                 
     that's superhero speak for "i really don't know what happened to her."   
     which brings me to the current core of my complexity. for somehow and    
 somewhy, i have been cast into this superflous life of superabundant and     
 supercharged superpowers. it is as if my previous life has been superimposed 
 over that of this superhuman superhero. my inferior being has been cast into 
 that of the superior and supernatural, given powers not the least of which   
 is the superability to fly at supersonic speeds. it is really not my wish    
 to supercede the superstructure of human life, for i am, or at least i was,  
 a normal man.                                                                
     this all happened a few days ago, and since then i've been doing alot of 
 thinking. i've also been doing alot of flying, and i've found that, believe  
 it or not, the two are completely compatable. what have i been thinking      
 about, you ask? well, naturally, a way to get my wife back. actually, if     
 we're being truthful here, and i'm pretty sure we are, i'm more working      
 towards a new formula for safely obtaining nuclear energy. but rest assured, 
 getting my wife back is a topic that has danced across my mind. in getting   
 her back, i assume that i will figure out exactly what has been going on     
 here, for without that assumption i'm quite sure that that would be another  
 topic of my thoughts. nevertheless, i have indeed been thinking.             
     oh, yeah, and flying, too.                                               
     oh, right, i'm supposed to be finding my wife. so, what do you think     
 would be a good place to start? too late, i already started back at my       
 house. i figured that would be the best place to search for some clues.      
 and clues i did indeed find. unfortunatly, they were only clues to where     
 i lost the remote control, and not to where i lost my wife. all this         
 detective work had made me quite tired, so i sat down on the couch and used  
 the newly-found remote to click my way to infinity. naturally, that put me   
 to sleep.                                                                    
     during the night i disappeared.                                          
     how do i know that i disappeared, you ask? well, obviously because i     
 woke up in a place where i hadn't slept before. actually, i'd never even     
 been there before. so, if i woke up in a different spot than i fell asleep   
 in, i must have disappeared from that spot sometime during the night. it's   
 all physics.                                                                 
     now, who do you think shows up just as i awake? no, it was dr. sleezack, 
 my dentist. don't ask me how he got there, i never bothered to ask. he had   
 a pretty big gun, because that's what mad scientists tend to use to kill     
 superheros like me. i wasn't scared much, for i knew i could easily stop     
 any speeding bullets that came flying my way. the doctor mumbled something   
 about a late bill, but i didn't pay much attention. it was only the bumbling 
 lunacy of a crazy man. then, to my amazement, something of beauty caught     
 my eye like the sparkling of a big... shiny thing. it was my wife! she was   
 tied up, tied down, and up against the wall. acting quickly, like any        
 superhero might, i smacked the mad doctor upside the head, stuck my pinky in 
 his gun, pulled the trigger, tied him up, called the police, wrote a note    
 explaining the situation, taped the note to the doctor's left eyelid,        
 grabbed my wife, untied her, and took off toward home.                       
     now that's the way a real superhero works! i foiled the plans of a mad   
 scientist and saved my wife all in a matter of seconds. the fact that i      
 have these superpowers is still a mystery, but that seems to be the way      
 my life is going these days. mystery after mystery, saved day after saved    
 day. but man, do the chics dig these tights.

                                        for if he was truly made of some gum,
                                    he would be too sticky and icky for some.

                              were supposedly made of that sticky stuff, too.
                                     now pokey was red and goo was real blue,
                              but gumby was green and that gum makes me spew.
                                                                           
                                stuck within that gum could there a brain be,
                                  with optics pertruding to let this man see?
                              uncovering these answers could be the true key,
                               to solving this thing that's been puzzling me.
                                                                           
                              i suppose we will find the true answer one day,
                           is gumby really made of gum, or even skin or clay?

     well, (<--- generic 'zine closer) it's been fun, people. but alas, all   
 good 'zines must come to an end. i wrote the pieces in this text for myself. 
 i had ideas, i had a computer, i wrote my ideas on the computer. i decided   
 that it might be even more fun if i let the public in on my little stories,  
 so i compiled them into this 'zine and called it deviate. if you liked it,   
 i'm truly ecstatic. if you didn't, oh well. too each his own, i suppose. 
 either way, it would make me sprout a smile if you took a few seconds out 
 of your oh-so-busy day to drop me some feedback. perhaps i'll even include 
 some of the feedback in a future issue! here's your chance to become elite!
                                                                              
     and that, my friends, is a 'zine. not just any 'zine, though. it's MY 
 fucking 'zine. but guess what?! you, too, can be a contributor to this k-rad
 elite 'zine! that's right, for a limited time only we're offering a lifetime
 supply of tang to all deviate writers and artists! (*) so drop your work
