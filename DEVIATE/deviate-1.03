part one - 

    my entire life, i have been under the impression that i was the most 
 perfect being in the entire universe. call me egotistical, call me self-
 centered... it's all true. i always thought that my ways were perfect, 
 that my opinions were always the most wholesome ones. i believed in the
 freedom of the individual, and through that i was the most open-minded and
 righteous person on earth. perhaps perfect is a strong word, though. i 
 never thought i was really smart. i'm surrounded by computer nerds and
 extremely intelligent people every second of my life, and their intelligence
 towers over mine. that was never really the issue, though. i always thought
 that my opinions and morals were so extremely high, that i was the center
 of all that was right in the world. somehow between issue two and three of
 this 'zine, i realized that there is no one perfect entity, and, if there 
 was, i would sure as hell not be it. sure, i'm pretty open-minded. my morals 
 are high. i don't do drugs, i don't smoke, i don't go out and beat people up 
 for fun. but is that really what makes a person good?
 
    i realized sometime recently that i'm constantly changing my ways. last
 issue i mentioned how against the idea of angst i was. this issue i have 
 nothing but pure, unadulterated angst. i was always against the idea of 
 being this angry young man. i was always high on my horse about being the
 happiest, most laid back person on earth. i still don't care about anything,
 and it might even be said that my angst is all forced, that i don't believe
 any of it; and to an extent, that's certainly true. when it comes right down
 to it, nothing really matters. but sometimes it can be fun to let your angst
 take over and decide to assimilate the world with your completely deranged
 and maniacal mind. sometimes we need a little angst to keep a purpose for
 living alive in our mind. what would the world be if no one cared about
 anything?
 
    when i thought about writing this editorial, i thought i would write a 
 little something about how i completely contradicted my last editorial 
 spewing over the course of the last few months. the problem is, i wasn't 
 really looking at the big picture.  the point is that people change. i 
 changed. i'm always changing, and learning to accept that change is part of 
 being open-minded.  so these editorials reflect my mind at the time of 
 writing. everything i say can completely change itself around in my head by 
 the time i write another one of these rants. who really knows what's going 
 to  happen? we need to just take it all in stride. live with change, because 
 it's going to happen as you grow older, as you grow wiser, and if you don't 
 embrace it you're going to end up hating yourself, hating your life, and
 hating the universe around you.  how could you go through life hating a
 universe that could very well be populated by small, green, sarcastic
 aliens? i don't know about you, but i'm pretty ecstatic about my own private
 universe.
 
    i guess what i'm really trying to say is, "i'm still perfect! NYEH!"

part two - 

    welcome to deviate issue three. it's a little different than the rest, as
 you'll realize as you go down through the text. it's all part of the change,
 the deviation. i mentioned it last issue, and i'll reinforce it this time
 around. this 'zine is completely loopy. it'll change as i change, and i'll
 be damned if that isn't alot of change. so maybe, just maybe, you'll find
 something that you like in one of these issues. it's just a bunch of really
 loppy stuff that people have written and i've decided to publish. is there
 meaning behind the writing? probably. is it abundantly apparent to the 
 reader? most likely not. but the fact of the matter is that there's a good
 chance it wasn't really clear to the writer either. the interpretation of
 the writing presented here is your own. we don't force our opinions down 
 your throat like some sort of deranged high school english teacher. if you
 can get something, anything, out of this writing, then i'm sincerely happy.
 
    be your own entity.

    the wind played a gentle tune as it whistled through the sunlit branches 
 and the leaves danced and rustled above the well kept suburban lawn. the ax
 fell down again amongst the tattered remnants of what was once a human torso. 
 birds twittered away as they aligned onto a white picket fence.  incense 
 curled up from the wounds and great fountains of blood sprayed almost a mist 
 over the patio.  the long stemmed flowers swayed and smiled upward at the 
 warm may sun on this lovely monday.  strange iron shapes were pinned to 
 various pieces of mangled flesh  and the incense coalesced into a loose but 
 unmistakable face of a demon. teeth bared, it feasted on the flesh until it's 
 bull  like  muzzle  dripped  of  human blood.  this  face grew  even  more 
 substantial now,  shimmering  veins  pulsated on its neck and face and two 
 long, black horns slid out of its temples.  it seemed a cattle skull with 
 black skin stretched taught over a network of quivering arteries.  grunting 
 an unearthly cry it vomited up onto the site of the sacrificial summoning. 
 steel rings rolled out of the steaming bile and scorched the cement, each
 holding a small flame where the stone would have laid had they been forged 
 by human hands.  having done this the horns faded,  and then the face,  and 
 finally the teeth hung over the blood spattered patio with steaming trails 
 of saliva dangling down.  then it all dissipated into the fresh spring air. 
 the demon gone, the rings quietly crumbled to ash. 
                                     
                                      . . .
    
    "jesus christ kevin, don't you see she's gone?" the voice buzzed through 
 the phone.
    "she's done it before, saying it's over then coming back," detective 
 kevin ivan lavien answered, trying to convince himself. "it's not quite
 midnight,  she'll ask me to come back within the hour."
    "she locked you out of the house and put a restraining order on you for 
 god's sake!"
    "that  doesn't  mean she doesn't  love  me and  doesn't want me around,"
 lavien spat the words out of his mouth as if to be an insult.
    "actually, it does mean she doesn't want you around," the voice retorted 
 with plain reason.
    a stifled beep wheezed from under kevin's jacket which was flung over 
 the back of a particularly uncomfortable hotel room chair. "hang on a second, 
 my beeper is, well, beeping."  setting the phone down on the motel 6 bed, he 
 shuffled over the coarse  low-pile carpeting towards his jacket and fumbled 
 inside the deep pockets for his beeper.  "damn."  was all he said, staring 
 blankly.  "hey bill, i'll call you back,  something came up. . ." his voice 
 shook and cracked as he bit back tears.
    "what was the beep about, you ok?" bill sounded genuinely worried.
    "i'll just call later."  kevin  hung  up  and  slid on yesterday's socks. 
 they felt sweaty.  he  always  hated  putting on unwashed socks.  the tears 
 stopped and he dressed himself the rest of the way. he checked his sharp and 
 stubbled face in the mirror for signs of crying. a few seconds later he was 
 in his car speeding towards what was his house.

                                  . . .

     he didn't bother to turn off the car or the headlights, he simply opened 
 the door and ran towards the back yard. police tape was already thickly 
 webbed all about the property and red-blue lights flickered across the 
 aluminum siding. he crossed into his side yard passing several other 
 officers examining the crushed grass or probing the drain pipes with latex 
 gloves.
     turning the corner into his back yard kevin promptly threw up. pieces of 
 shimmering flesh hung on iron meet hooks that dangled from the clothes line. 
 the whole yard glittered with black blood and white pieces of cartilage. 
 intestines were delicately arranged in a 5 pointed star within a circle on 
 the patio's thick cement slabs. teeth had been pushed into the gastral 
 lining at regular intervals giving it the odd look of a disfigured mouth. 
 ashes lay in the middle of this unholy star and chips in the cement formed 
 strange symbols. collecting his senses and wiping his chin with a handker-
 cheif, kevin mustered enough professionalism to look for foot prints amongst 
 the gore or for anything revealing at all. cocking his head back and letting 
 his burning, over-tired, eyes stare up at the cold stars standing far off, he 
 gritted his teeth. letting his gaze lower, he saw the second story bedroom 
 window, directly above the patio, was smashed, and thick lines of blood 
 poured all the way from the window sill to the lawn drenching a large patch 
 of sod. it seemed to rain there, a torrent cascaded out of the window's 
 gaping maw and razor teeth hung out, imitating the splintered glass. 
     "it's female. or, was female." said a forensic detective in the 
 background as he examined a piece of mutilated pubic bone.
     "i'll go back to my little motel room. have dispatch call me if there 
 are any questions that need answers tonight." kevin said to no one in 
 particular. he walked back around the house ducking security tape. climbing 
 into his car, he saw a news truck packed with reporters and cameramen squeal 
 to a stop, teetering back and forth, next to him. "the vultures are here." 
 he called the familiar warning out his open car door and slammed it shut.
     the phone rattled on its thick plastic receiver. covers rustled uneasily 
 and a hand poked out from under a crumpled pillow. fumbling for the phone 
 and slapping the sheet from his face, kevin met the morning.
     "what." he demanded flatly in a voice that croaked from just awakening.
     "i am satan." the deep torn syllables scratched through the ear piece in 
 a shout that made his ears ring.
     the phone grew hot and slippery in kevin's hand. he was at a complete 
 and utter loss. he felt fear and curiosity but had no idea of how to 
 respond.
     "she is dead by my hand."
     the unasked question was answered. whatever was on the other end of the 
 line had killed, no, obliterated, his wife. curiosity was replaced wholly 
 with rage, but fear still held a place along side it.
     "window." the voice spat. 
     sliding out of the bed and slipping on his shoulder holster and trousers 
 kevin felt the phone burn against his chin and shoulder. 
     "why?" he tried to sound authoritative but the babyish and broken tones 
 that fell on the receiver held nothing but the near unbridled fright of a 6 
 year old who had lost it's mother. wisps of smoke streamed from the mouth 
 piece and with a shout kevin dropped the phone. the phone fell and the chord 
 contracted, dragging the phone a few inches towards the base and burning a 
 trail in the carpet. sliding his shoes on kevin saw the morning sun, that had 
 turned the white of his bed spread into a warm yellow, fade and blacken. 
 night settled on his little room in motel 6.
     smashing the light switch up and snapping his berreta 9mm from its 
 sheath brought kevin a feeling of meager security as he tiptoed towards his 
 window facing the rear parking lot. a thunder rolled through the room and 
 the light flickered acknowledging a being of immense evil as the glass 
 slowly cracked and then burst asunder, allowing the haggard over 9 foot tall 
 demon to enter. detective lavien wet his drawers. a hideous goat like head 
 and legs adorned what appeared to be a humanoid figure. steam curled from
 the doubled over monstrosity, circling slowly about the spike-like horns
 protruding from the shoulders and cranium. massive chest muscles twitched,
 launching a massive spiked and barbed fist through the ceiling with a trail 
 of blue sparks. the hand descended from the second floor, clutching a torn 
 human leg. thick lines of blood dangled from the gash in the roof while a 
 severed artery formed a mist of spurting black which clung to the beast's 
 dark red skin. the huge head barked and dropped the leg to thump on the 
 short hotel carpeting. kevin leveled his pistol while hot tears flooded his 
 face and he unloaded his entire clip into the spawn of satan. he seemed 
 detached as the silvery backs of his bullets slid from the barrel. the first 
 of his barrage crept toward the demon's face and finally made contact. the 
 tight skin tore away and then the shell punched through the thick bone of 
 it's left cheek. shards of ivory popped out and exploded from the back of
 the skull as the second bullet made contact. eight rounds blasted all the 
 destruction mankind could muster into the face of evil itself.
     kevin ivan lavien had expected the thing to either die or to see the 
 gaping and gorish wounds heal themselves miraculously or anything but what 
 came to pass. the beast, with the pieces of its mangled face hanging from 
 strands of skin, sinew and arteries, did not seem to even know it had been 
 shot. the wounds didn't keep the demon from tearing out kevin's ribs by 
 bending them outward through the skin one at a time or from digging 6 inch 
 nails into his kidneys. prayers fell from lips dribbling wet and warm blood.
 prayers not for aid or retaliation, not even a final confession, only 
 prayers that soon he would be dead and alone.

                                   . . .

    the next morning, house keeping came into the corner room of motel 6 and 
 discovered kevin's battered and broken body. ribs stuck strait outward and 
 horrible gashes and tears laid all over him.  his head was cocked at an odd 
 angle and the expression was unattainable, due to a slash to the bone across 
 his mouth and cheeks. the sun shone through the window pane and onto the gun 
 in it's holster that lay on the bed. the ceiling sat untouched.
    the murder was filed away in police records next to the homicide report 
 on mrs. lavien.  the cabinet in which  they were put bore the tag,  "some 
 things are better left unknown."

                                         through her loving eyes she baded me
                                                                    [so deep]
                            i could float in them forever, swim in the depths
                                      lose myself, and have you bring me back
                                                                    in a snap
                                                        so brief and exposing
                                                                  i knew you.
                                                                 [i love you]

                                           like a drug, you were in my system
                                          i could feel your blood in my veins
                                          a soft regulatory rhythm between us
                                                                     in limbo
                                                       nothing could break us
                                                                 i loved you.
                                                                 [i love you]
                                                                      surreal
                                                          i brushed your lips
                                                       and gave you all I had
                                               all of my possessions, my body
                                                   my heart, my love, my life
                                                                and i thought
                                                         nothing can break us
                                                            but i doubted you
                                                                 [i love you]
                                                             and a snap again
                                               synapses convulsing as a harsh
                                              stinging dream came to be truth
                                               and the truth mangled my trust
                                          and murdered it, and you laughed as
                                                                   your moves
                                                      destroyed my very being
                                                         and then i knew you.
                                                                 [i love you]
                                          like a sheep, i followed, i trailed
                                               your path of destruction of me
                                    picking up myself and handing them to you
                                                            in a woven basket 
                                                         of my guilt and fear
                                                            i knew the truth.
                                                                 [i love you]
                                   through soft-spoken words you smothered me
                                       burying my doubts until i was deceived
                                            until i knew no more about myself
                                         and it was far too late to turn back
                                                                    but i did
                                                              And i hated you
                                                                 [i love you]
                                            no, my eyes, they opened that day
                                        and i looked around me and saw myself       
                                  splayed about, with you pulling the strings
                                           driving my life to a destined hell
                                                                and i woke up
                                                         and i threw you away
                                                       and i hated you for it
                                                                 [i love you]
                                           no! i screamed, and screamed again
                                    feeling my words hit a hollow personality
                                              and i shattered your intentions
                                               with the meaning of my actions
                                           and i watched shards of you fliter
                                                               out of my life
                                                                       slowly
                                                                     silently

  i've been working on this  story for quite some time,  on and off, usually 
 while in school. i really wasn't sure where i wanted to go with a lot of it,
 and i'm not sure it  turned out  completely how  i would have liked.  on the 
 whole, it's not a bad story, but there are parts which i would have liked to
 work  through better.  it  just got to the point where i was sick of writing 
 this story and wanted to move on, so here it is. respect goes out to the
 original writer's of "the crow". i think it's safe to say that i was heavily
 influenced by that work.

   the sunlight streamed across the bedroom, playing off of the reflective
 surface of her freshly opened,  beautiful green eyes. gabriel was up early
 today, perched upon the wooden stool and staring out at the glass distorted 
 landscape like a raven awaiting a lost soul. 

   "look at them. wound up little tin soldiers, marching their way through 
 the monotony of their push-button lives."

   "there you go again, getting yourself worked up over something you have no 
 control over. come back to bed, honey."

   gabriel closes the black curtains that draped over the window's edge,
 cutting off a good portion of the light and rendering the room dark as
 night. he climbs back into bed next to alex, her smooth skin brushing up
 against his thigh, reminding him just how lucky he is to have her. he had
 been tired the night before after a long day at work, but they managed to
 make up for lost time as the morning progressed through early afternoon.

   the sun was now starting it's slow decent over the western horizon.
 gabriel and alex sat down for a late lunch after getting out of bed,
 starting their day while other's were already in full swing. the weekend
 was their time together, and this saturday was no different. gabriel, due 
 to the nature of his job, worked nearly every night, but the days were his
 to spend with alex, showing their undying love for one another.

   "don't go to work tonight, honey. we'll stay in and cook a nice dinner. 
 it'll be fun!"

   "you know i can't do that, alex."

   "god damn you, gabriel. you're not going to save the world in one fucking
 night. you work too much, damnit."

   "honey, you know i have work to do. i can't stay home and rest while the
 scum of the world run rampant in our streets, destroying the very fabric
 of our existence. it's the god damn apocalypse out there, and i've got to
 do something about."

   "you're not batman, gabriel. the world needs more help than you can give
 it, can't you realize that?"

   "of course i realize that, but that's no reason to quit. i have a skill 
 that can help the honest people of this world, and i'll be damned if i'm 
 not going to do everything in my power to use it."

   gabriel throws his napkin down on the table and gets up.

   "i'll be home later, you know i will. we'll have fun then. right now i
 have to work. i have to put my conscience at ease. i've got to save this
 god forsaken world."

   "fine. just make sure you come back, because i'll kill you if you die on
 me."

   "haha. have i ever gone back on a promise?"

   "don't get cocky, just come back."

   "of course."

   "i love you, gabriel."

   "i love you, too, alex. don't get into too much trouble while i'm gone."

   alex gets up from the table and surprises gabriel with a passionate kiss
 which lasts for what seems like days. with that, gabriel walks out the door
 and out of view.

   it was nearly dark out now, alex was in the shower, freshening up before
 gabriel returned. she had a surprise ready for him, and she wanted everything
 to be perfect. stepping out of the shower, she hears a knock on the door.
 throwing a towel around her nearly perfect body, she yells out to the person
 behind the door. 

   "who is it?"

   "a friend of your boyfriend's."

   opening the door frantically, she fears the worst.

   "my god, what is it? what's happened to gabriel?"

   "nothing's wrong with your boyfriend, girlie. it's you you should be 
 worried about."

   the stranger closes the door behind him and pulls out a pair of black
 leather gloves, stretching them over his large hands. alex drops her towel
 and starts to run. without a second exit to the small apartment, she only
 gets as far as the bedroom before rolling up into a ball and cowering in 
 the corner. 

   the stranger pulls out a .45 caliber pistol, checking the clip to ensure
 that it's loaded.

   "please. don't kill me, i've done nothing to you. i don't even know you.
 please. please. PLEASE!" 

   alex takes a final breath before screaming.

   "NOOOO!"

   one shot to the middle of the forehead and she stops her restless 
 breathing. 

                                    * * *

   nearly midnight now, the moon high above the earth showers down on the
 desolate world below. gabriel is tired, making his way slowly up the five
 flights of stairs to his top floor apartment. he unlocks the door and
 steps into the moonlight drenched apartment, the curtains blowing wildly in
 the breeze from the open windows. it is cold and damp, and not a single
 light is lit. 

   "alex? honey? are you there?"

   flicking the living room light on, he sees nothing. the apartment is as
 he left it, except for the abcense of any living soul. gabriel throws his
 leather jacket onto the back of a kitchen chair and opens the refrigerator,
 grabbing a cold soda to refresh his depleted thirst. he moves into the 
 bedroom and flicks on the light.

   "my god. NO. ALEX!"

   dropping his now open soda, he rushes toward the lifeless corpse. his 
 pulse is racing nearly to the point of bursting a vein. he feels around for
 her pulse, but the hole in her soft-skinned forehead tells him that it's a
 lost cause. 

   "no... this can't be. please god, what did i do to deserve this? GOD, WHY
 HAVE YOU DONE THIS TO ME?!?!?!?"

                                    * * *

   the rage, he feels so much. the sadness, it's burning up inside. the
 questions, he has many. the grief, he has never known a greater pain. the
 pain. excruciating pain. so much pain. why?

   his days are filled with rage, his nights with tears and the hope that 
 someday the pain will subside. his mind, always so bent on the prospect of
 revenge, the hope that some day his actions would clean the world of it's
 filth, was now filled only with sadness and a fear that is indescribable.
 he feels the rage, but knows not how to manifest it... he feels the pain, 
 but cannot harvest it. the sweet smell of revenge fills the air, but he 
 cannot clear his mind of the sadness... the bitter sadness.

                            his god is dead.

   for thirteen days he felt the pain. for thirteen days he felt the sadness.
 for thirteen days he felt the grief. on the fourteenth day there is only
 one feeling left: rage.
                                  
                                    * * *

   the previously sun drenched land was cool now in the first hours of the
 night. the moon was full, but, sheltered by the numerous thin, shooting
 clouds, gave off only limited light. activity on the streets had halted,
 as if the coming of night had brought death to the world below. far above
 the earth, a stone gargoyle stared heavily at the deserted streets, doubling
 as a floating fortress for gabriel, his katana buried in the creature's
 stiff head.

   the gaze of his seemingly black eyes, fixed on the ruckus causing creature
 stammering through the streets below, pierced through the night like a
 bullet through water. the drunken suluc, merely a pawn in the game of life,
 stumbled through the alley across the way, trying to make his way to the
 "glass shadow."

   taking sword in hand, gabriel steps off the platform and onto a thin
 electrical wire stretched across the dark street. playing the balancing act
 he was so fond of showing off, gabriel positions himself several meters
 above suluc. the sword, falling quickly through the night, pierces the
 street, frightening the nervous drunkard.

   "what the fuck was that?" his voice is uneven and cracking.

   gabriel jumps to the ground below, directly in front of the vagrant.

   "the sum of all your fears, suluc. i hope you've said your prayers, it's
 time for you to meet their recipient."

   gabriel grabs his sword, pulling it across his body. the strong steel
 blade flips around the opposite side and reverses, slicing directly through
 suluc's alcohol laden neck on the back swing. the heat of the ferocious
 swing immediately cauterizes the bloody wound as the convulsing body falls to
 the ground, lifeless. jamming his sword in the ground, gabriel kneels before
 the body as the lights in the alley explode in an array of blinding sparks;
 then darkness.

   "that one's for my pain."

                                    * * *

   and in the darkness, the smell of death was in the air...

                                    * * *

   "who's here?" spin's voice was sinister and torn.

   "fucking rats, man. this city's a god damn shit hole."

   he kicks a can into the air and it catches the light from the street light
 high above, playing with it, bouncing it off the shiny surface. the can
 exits the light and into the shadows where it makes no sound.

   "what the fuck? who's back there?"

   the can, jetting out from the darkness, bounces off spin's head and hits
 the ground with a loud clang. he draws a knife from it's sheath around his
 waist.

   "you're gunna die for that, bitch."

   knife outstretched in front of him, spin pokes around at the edge of the
 shadows.

   "come out here, punk, so i can cut you up real nice like."

   the moonlight, just peaking over the tops of the buildings, lights the
 eyes of grabriel as he slowly steps out of the darkness to face his enemy.
 spin takes a stab with his knife as gabriel flips over him, floating through
 the air as if he had wings. stunned from the move, spin barely has time to
 react to the fist flying straight for his face. blood spurts out of his nose
 as he stumbles to regain his balance.

   "tell me where ecks is or you'll die right now."

   "fuck you and die."

   gabriel jumps into the air as his foot swings around and catches spin
 square on the chin, knocking him backward.

   "you may want to rethink your answer."

   "who the fuck are you, man?"

   "i'm the guy who's gunna kill you if you don't tell me where the FUCK ecks
 is."

   spin slashes at his attacker, slicing gabriel's cheek. grabbing him by
 the back of his scrawny little neck, gabriel flips him down on his back and
 places his sword directly above spin's heart, holding it with two hands,
 ready to strike in an instant.

   "now you've had your fun. tell me where ecks is."

   spitting blood onto the ground next to him, spin finally answers.

   "he's at the 'glass shadow'. in the back room. that's where he always is,
 man."

   "thanks."

   gabriel starts to move away, then pauses.

   "oh, i forgot one thing."

   he flips his sword above his head, grabs it with both fists and thrusts
 it into spin's heart, slicing it in mid beat. spin gurgles twice, then dies.

   "that one's for my suffering."

                                    * * *

   and in the moonlight, the sweet smell of blood was in the air ...

                                    * * *

   the moon was high above the earth now, casting it's light down and giving
 the city a ghostly illumination. gabriel was resting, enjoying the brisk
 october night as the eleventh hour came and passed. the "glass shadow", just
 around the corner, was now bustling with activity.

   the city's busiest night club, the "glass shadow" is the favorite hangout
 of the very scum of society that gabriel loathes with every ounce of his
 existence. the people there will surely know him, as he has spent the last
 three years of his life washing his boots in their blood. this would prove
 to be a fight of epic proportions.

   the word had spread regarding the death of two of the city's most hardened
 criminals and the underground was flooding with rumors. there was no
 mistaking who had done it; there was only one man who even cared enough. the
 crowd at the "glass shadow" was waiting restlessly for a chance at revenge.

   gabriel gets up and pulls out his sword. slamming open the large steel
 doors of the "glass shadow", he heads straight for the back room. immediately
 recognizing gabriel as the object of their morbid desires, the blood thirsty
 hoodlums encroach on him with their various weapons drawn.

   gabriel, with nothing left to lose and no hope remaining, struts through
 the blockage of enemies with a look of pure hatred on his face, as the music
 blaring through the bar shouts it's refrain; "how can i exist without you?"
 gabriel's sword pierces the chest of his first foe, ripping through the back
 of his now lifeless corpse. gabriel spins around, pulling the sword out of
 the gaping wound and slashing the entrails of an enemy approaching from
 behind. ducking a punch from another, he gains his momentum, slicing the
 head off his third enemy, then immediately tossing his sword like a bullet
 into the bare chest of a gun wielding drunken entity. now without weapon,
 gabriel calls on the power of his own body to make safe passage through the
 bar, solidly punching another attacker, sending his nose bone into the front
 of his brain, killing him almost immediately. now standing only five feet
 from the doors to the back room, gabriel jumps into the air, kicking the
 door guard in the chest, sending him flying backward through the swinging
 doors. the remaining enemies back off, knowing that whatever is left of this
 foe will be ripped apart by ecks himself.

   "why did you kill her?"

   "to get to you, of course. my motives are quite obvious, gabriel, my boy."

   the room, formerly filled with associates of evil, echoes now only with
 the booming voices of the two mortal enemies.

   "then take me as i am."

   gabriel charges the weaponless ecks, forcing him against the stone wall,
 embracing in a deadly battle. fists fly and often connect, bodies are thrown
 and blood is spilt. the two dark figures tumble into the next room as the
 surrounding audience cheers for the victory of their vicious leader. ecks
 backs off, staring gabriel down while the two circle around an invisible
 border.

   "you shouldn't have come here, gabriel. your destiny is sewn, just like
 that precious little girly of yours."

   "your life's decay is my destiny, ecks."

   gabriel charges as ecks turns around, facing the wall. spinning back
 around, he pulls gabriel's sword out of the hunched body pinned to the wall,
 letting it fall to the ground. with one lunge, the sword tears through the
 approaching skin of gabriel, bringing him to his knees, arms outstretched as
 if petitioning to heaven for his fading life.

   ecks shakes his head and lowers his voice. "you shouldn't have come here,
 gabriel."

   he walks away, leaving the bloody body of gabriel to wither away in agony.

   flashes of light enter gabriel's tightly shut eyes. images of life circle
 his decaying brain, flooding his thoughts with a reason to live; a reason to
 fulfill his only remaining goal. he slowly and painfully slides the sword
 out of his gushing wound, pulling the tip out of the frontal gash and
 holding the blade between his two crimson soaked hands. with a final burst
 of energy, and only one hope remaining, gabriel stumbles to his feet and
 turns around.

   blood trickling down his chin, he manages to utter his final words.

   "this one is for you, alex."

   with one fluid motion, gabriel tosses the sword, which glides end over end
 through the stale air and lodges itself into the chest of ecks as he turns
 around.

   the small bar fills with a blinding light, windows shaking, floor
 trembling. the light diminishes into total darkness and the screams of lost
 souls are heard through the dead air. darkness fades back to light and life
 goes on, the bodies of the dead disappearing into the blood pools around
 them. a small twinkle of light dances through the shimmering pool of
 gabriel's blood.

   "welcome home, my love."

   defcon 4. the back lit sign clicked down a level, bringing peace on earth
 to a grinding halt. it had been 68 years since the treaty, a time of
 ultimate peace and unity on planet earth. in the year of our lord 2000, at
 the dawning of the new millennium, a small faction of revolutionaries
 brought the digital world to it's knees, holding hostage the very backbone
 of a fully operational planet. demanding that the world bow to them as gods,
 they ushered in a new era of true peace and enlightenment. what had appeared
 to most to be the beginning of the third world war had become a prophecy
 fulfilling engine for peace. technology moved away from war and focused on
 the betterment of human existence as the populous became education oriented,
 learning about life and the universe while bringing in the aesthetic beauty
 of art to revolutionize the view of our planet. for 68 years, we have lived
 as a single nation, journeying through our infinite realities and working
 to gain an infinite perspective.

   2068. it started three days ago: the earth erupted into a ball of flame
 in several key cities of the nation. buildings collapsed, transports
 exploded, and nearly half of the worlds digital network was shut down for
 reasons unknown. communication, the main tool of our new nation, had been
 severely crippled.

   the monitor ahead of me had clicked on just moments before, revealing an
 enormous being standing on the nasa building in midtown manhatten. the war
 outside carried the waves of noise caused by the thousands of people
 stopping their cars to focus on the monitors in nearby shop windows and
 phone booths. the being had succeeded in instantaneously grabbing the
 attention of the entire population.

   "your feeble planet is being reformed. do not resist our dominion. the
 underworld has become overpopulated. welcome to new hell."

   large black wings spread from behind the figure and lifted him off into
 the sky.

                                  * * *

   "i want every man we've got loaded with a rail gun and on the streets and
 i want it last month! launch the fucking flyboys, get 'em all in the air!
 prepare every god damn nuke we've got left. we're gunna need enough power
 to fuck up every anthill on the planet. move out, and god help us all."

   i didn't know what else to do. we were dealing with the devil here and
 there didn't seem to be a prayer in heaven to get us out alive. 68 years ago
 i lead our nation to unity and now we were faced with destruction. the eyes
 of the world were on me. the future of our existence was in my hands.

   "what am i going to do?"

   runtime error at 0000:0047 - divide by zero.

   "god damnit! this fucking program is due tomorrow. you'd think i'd have
 learned how to do this shit after 4 years of computer science."

   "i suppose i'll just finish it in the morning."

   a flash of remnant phosphorescence floods the screen and goes blank as
 the power seeps out of the monitor.

   there's a file on my hard drive right now called deviate1.03. i created
 it right after i released deviate issue 2, a year ago to this day. it's been
 idle there for a long time. i never had the will... maybe i just never had
 the motivation to finish it. it's done now. i've edited it, i've finished
 unfinished work, i've wrapped it up into a nice little textfile and it's
 all ready to be published for the world to see. something hit me tonight.
 after about nine hours of watching tv, a familiar act these days, i was
 struck down by motivation. it comes at funny times, but i wasn't going to
 ignore it this time. i hadn't felt it in a while, and i seized this
 opportunity to finish this beast.

   and so ends another chapter in my life.

   yeah... this is the end of the current road for deviate. it's become
 evident that i can no longer maintain a 'zine by myself, nor do i really
 enjoy doing so. life is about communication and friendship, and with those
 things in mind i've formed a new venture with two fellow 'zinesters. with
 the partnership of edicius, editor of the long running jonas e'zine, and
 belial, editor of several short lived 'zines, i'm going to be moving forward
 into uncharted territory and exploring new moods and ideas. we've decided,
 for no apparent reason, to name this venture "syntax22". hopefully it will
 be something i can dedicate myself to for a while. look out for it on the
 web sometime soon. (i'll post a link on the deviate web site when we get
 something up.)

   don't count deviate out for good, though. people change, ideas change,
 life changes. it was the whole idea surrounding the 'zine, and to turn my
 back on that now would be hypocritical. i wouldn't be entirely surprised
 if a fourth issue of deviate were to make it's way into the world. maybe
 not in a year, maybe not even two years. but do we ever really know what's
 going to happen?

   if you've gotten this far, i'd like to truly thank you for being a reader
 of my little forum here. it's been fun doing it, and i'm hoping at least
 one person had fun reading it. until next time...
