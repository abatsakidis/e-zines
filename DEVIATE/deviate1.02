     my life is simple. i breath, eat, and sleep, occasionally finding it
 adventageous to do some other stuff to keep my mind occupied. perhaps that
 is why i write this 'zine; it gives me something to do. who knows? one thing
 i know is that i don't have angst. it's unfortunate, really, because it 
 often leaves me at a loss for words when writing this thing. i don't have
 enough problems in life to warrant any angst. you know what? now that i 
 think about it, i believe i have negative-angst. i have the ability to
 squelch all angst with my holy negative-angst. it's kinda like that whole
 matter/anti-matter thing. 
     i finally realized the other day what the core of my personality is.
 somehow, i manage to not care about anything while at the same time caring
 about everything. wacky, isn't it? but it is indeed true. i suppose it's 
 one of those little things that makes me, well, me. it contributes to my
 whole metaphor for reality. everyone has one of those, it's what makes
 individual perception so valuable. the way you see things is inevitably 
 going to be entirely different from those around you. unfortunatly, there
 will always be those who believe in only one metaphor. they are the close-
 minded ones; the people who will stop at nothing to make you see their way.
 but perhaps it is almost hypocritical of me to scorn these people, for i
 have found myself trying to make others see my way on several occasions. 
 it's human nature, after all. everyone wishes the world saw things through
 their own rose colored glasses. but just think how bored we would get. do
 you really want a world full of clones? my metaphor is different than yours,
 and i happen to like it that way. 
     
     i think what i'm trying to say is "get the hell out of my treehouse."
     
     word of advice: never use brake cleaner to clean out your bearings. did
 you know it eats grease? bearings are packed in grease. it's what makes 
 them spin so nicely. unfortunatly, i learned this the hard way and now my
 rollerblades barely move. pity.
     
     so anyway.
     
     this is deviate issue two. it's a little wackier than issue one, and
 i'm pretty sure that's a good thing. in the spirit of being different, we
 like each issue to deviate a bit from it's former. this one is a little more
 humor oriented, a little less serious. hell, even the ascii is a bit crazier
 and less conservative. i guess i just go with the mood i'm in. so follow my
 mood for a little while. open your mind for me and the other writers, and
 take in a bit of a tale. most of all, don't forget to stray off the path
 a bit in your neverending quest to make it through life.
                     everyone can use a little deviation.

      branches; left and right, above and below, screaming past him while
 swaying in the brisk breeze of the cold winter night. nearly invisable, one 
 tears through his flesh as he races through the woods. a thin line of 
 crimson fluid tickles down his face, leaving a faint trail on the damp grass 
 below. twenty yards behind, the dark shadows are quickly gaining, guided by 
 the weak light straining to emenate from their failing flashlights. slipping 
 on the wet ground, the fugitive stops to regain the floppy that jumped out 
 of his pocket. sweeping off the dew with his hand, he shoves the disk back 
 into his jacket and tears off into the darkness. only five yards behind, the 
 well-dressed shadows stop their chase at the mercy of their dead flashlights. 
 three miles from the pay phone where this started, the runner ducks into an 
 abandoned water duct, straining his lungs with every breath.
      the moon light was scarce here, rarely breaking through the thick cover
 of the trees to illuminate the space below. it was even darker inside the 
 pipe, the only light barely visable at the opposite end. he knew he couldn't 
 stay here long, the deadline was only five minutes away and there was no 
 chance of his cell modem connecting through the thick concrete walls of the 
 duct. lungs still straining, he gets up, sloshing through the shallow water 
 as he makes his way toward the light.
      
      inner city chicago, 3:24am. the accoustics in the hotel room emphasize
 the squeak of the cheap, rusted bed. the stains and mysterious spots on the
 ceiling captivate his attention in spite of the cheap entertainment. as he
 makes a motion with his hand, she recognizes the signal and gets up. putting
 on her red plastic one-piece, he hands her a twenty in one hand as she zips
 up with the other. without an exchange of words, she's out the door, ready 
 to turn another trick before calling it a night. he sits in the dark room,
 staring and waiting nervously for something to happen; anything.
      brian was one of those kids, always teatering on the edge of good and
 evil. his conscience was whole, but he always seemed to get himself into
 these situations. this time he was smart, decided to rely on someone else
 instead of sticking his hands directly into the shit. he was beginning to
 think that was a bad move. what was it his father always told him? "if you
 want a job done right, you've got to do it yourself."

      "well, shit on me."

      he always thought his father was full of shit. the old fool drank
 himself to death years ago. mother died when brian was only 4; he's always
 blaming his problems on that, like some sort of demented psychiatrist. now
 he was wishing that he had listened to the advice the old fool had given 
 him. the ticks on the clock were passing so slowly now; time knew he was
 waiting for something. he never was a very patient man.
      the ring of the phone sounded loud in his ears, popping his eyes open
 from their boredom induced coma. lifting the heavy receiver from the base
 of the ancient phone, he heard the heavy gasps from the caller.

      "brian, man, you there?"

      "what the fuck did i tell you about using my real name?"

      "sorry man, listen, i've got the shit."
      
      "then fucking transfer it, what the hell are you calling me for?"

      "listen, man, the feds are all over my ass. i've gotta get outta here."

      "fucking shit, man, can't you do anything right? where are you? the 
 deadline was ten fucking minutes ago."

      "i'm behind some little cabin or something, they chased me through the
 woods. hold on... shit, they're coming."

      "listen, i don't give a shit what you have to do, just make the 
 transfer and make it quick."
  
      <click>

      this deal was a big one, and he was messing with the wrong people. he
 didn't show it, but the fear running through his brain was huge. he had put
 his fate in the hands of another. 

      "never trust another person, never trust another person," the mantra
 rolled through his aching head.

      he learned his lesson this time. if he lived through this one he was
 going to change himself. there would be no looking back. why the HELL did he
 have to go and put his trust in someone else.
  
      <ring>

      "yeah."

      "dude, i made the transfer, the job is done."

      "thank god."

      "you sound worried, man, i told you you could trust me."

      trust me... trust me... trust me... the sentance trailed off and echoed
 in his brain.

   like the forests of alfheim always are, it was a beautiful mist filled
 day at the river; the sparrows were singing, the woodnymphs were frolicing, 
 and the water sprites were playing their kelp banded harps.

   as i was merrily on my way to the north path, i was rather disturbed. the 
 toadstool paths were getting larger by the mile, and air seemed to become a 
 lot crisper.  to my suprise, a school of flame faeries charged through the 
 air towards me, yelling "gimme k0dez!@~" ..  2600 MHz tones were flying at 
 me from all angles, and i was now being brutaly beaten with an 'elf box' .. 
 it was obvious they were asking for something i could not provide, and i 
 began to panic; moments later, i was embraced with a brilliant green aura, 
 and my body rested lifeless against the moss covered floor.

   the flame faeries then landed on my stomach, and formed a mighty circle.
 one of them began to move forward, and started to speak.  "i am known as
 mistnick, you have entered our domain, and are prompted to login," mumbled 
 the leader faery.  "login!@~," the faery yelled again, so i had no choice 
 but to play along; a vortex begin to form, and a wooden object emerged which 
 appeared to have a view screen, and a touch-type keyboard. a narrow array of 
 light binded my own, and the flame faery's forehead, and i was bombarded 
 with images.

   "i am dr. k0dez, i am dr. k0dez, i am dr. k0dez," flooded though my mind, 
 and now there was no turning back.  my fingers moved like they never moved 
 before, and _i_ was in control.  i had the power to conquer this 'ivynet' 
 network, and the flame faeries now had the power which they were seeking, 
 _dr. k0dez_ ..  i created beige boxes, blue boxes, gold boxes, and others at 
 will by converting the natural energies around me into a vortex of 
 fluxuating madness.

   i knew my mission, i was to take control of shroomhouse.gov, so i quickly 
 followed the concentrated patches of toadstools, until i finally got into 
 the shroomhouse shell.  "i am in!@~," i shouted, and the flame faeries 
 began to dance with glee around the mushroom rings.  everything seemed tight 
 and secure, the main password was heavily encrypted. "this feeble roadblock 
 will not stop me, dr. k0dez!@~," i shouted to the heavens.  mistnick then 
 handed me the mother of all hacking utilities, the shroom of emmanual.  i 
 quickly ingested the mushroom, and was quickly altered into a changed state 
 of mind, I WUZ TRiPPiN' bALLz!@# colors of fushia, green, reds a various 
 yellows were now a part of my reality, and were morphing into various 
 fractal positions.

   i then quickly mentally transformed the mathmatical fractal equations to 
 binary, and was well on my way to decrypting the main password file. 
 everything seemed to flow, mistnick was prancing merrily around the moss
 covered grounds.  colors were everywhere, everybody was in a state of
 happiness, and the main password file was decrypted!@~  now the phun begins.  
 all the flame faeries cackled with evil grins on their faces, and i began to 
 login the root account.  i first began with a little exploring, here are the 
 logs to this most interesting shell:  :)

  a tree in a string of directories, from root all the way to the leaves!
  hahaha!@# that was pretty sneaky of them.)

 root:/bark/branch/limb/twig/leaf/$ ls

   from here, i generally wipe the system.  mistnick and i have succussfully 
 aquired root on shroomhouse.gov!@~#  a great celebration was to take place, 
 all the elite of the elite attended; from the phreaking guild of druids, all 
 the way to the clan of anarchist cenutaurs.  this was a day to celebrate. 
 soon we would have root on all the boxes in alfheim forest!~@  we soon fell 
 asleep around a great camp phire, and the tree spirits humbly played sweet 
 melodies using red box tones.  this was a new beginning. ...

 till next time ...  muhahaha!@~

 biodegradable package and pull out the unit, being careful not to bend any
 hoses or knock off any knobs. (that sentence was way too metaphorical.) set
 it down in a decently ventilated area. now you need to hook it up to your 
 computer. you'll need an empty serial port, as well as an unused com port. 
 we recommend com4, because no one EVER uses com4! 
    if all went well, you should now have a fully functional dev-e-8-1000
 pizza accelerator! welcome to the big time, man! flip on your computer and
 get your appetite ready.

                    +-- - the software installation - --+

    slip in the cd-rom that accompanied your dev-e-8-1000 and switch to that
 drive. at the prompt, grit your teeth and type in "pHOOD". this program is
 case sensitive, so be sure to write it just like that. this will install
 the necessary files onto your hard drive and get you all setup. the program
 should autodetect your dev-e-8-1000, so there is no need for you to type
 a thing. (if the program cannot find the hardware, consult a physician.)
 now you're all set to transfer your first pizza. reboot your computer to
 make sure the new changes take effect, slide a pizza onto the buffer tray,
 and give it the good 'ole "pHOOD" command. 

    wanna know how it all works? read on as cerkit explains!

                           +-- - the rundown - --+
    
    once the necessary installation is complete you'll take your slab
 of pizza and place it on the buffer.  there it will be encoded into binary.
 in a buffer, as binary data, it is modulated into a file.  as a file it can  
 be transported freely throughout the network, edited, or deleted. the file 
 .piz is normally, depending on the pizza size (small, medium, large, with 
 sausage or without) about 200k.  of course there are compression utilities 
 and they will be discussed later.  once you're very sure that you're ready, 
 go for it, read on.

                      +-- - the actual processing - --+

    the acceleration unit takes this encoded pizza information, in binary 
 form, and sends it through it's i/o cables and into the phood modulating 
 unit where it is modulated into a file. the particles of pizza, now within a 
 file, are sent through the main transfer cable and into the elite null modem 
 connectors and into a memory buffer, called SMASH. oops, i mean RAM. saved 
 within the buffer is an actual pie of pizza. from your buffer it becomes an 
 existing file on your hardrive, normally a .piz file. this file can be 
 uploaded to a shell account and then dcc'd. (it's fun to trade them for MAD
 warez!) the good people at pkware inc. have come up with a rather worth-
 while program for .piz compression. pkpizzip is a rather useful utility for 
 storing untransfered pizza,  as you may never know when you'll need an 
 already prepared pie.  the accelerator also has the ability to reverse the 
 process. perchance someone sends you a .piz. you run your normal laplink 
 software and copy the file to the drive which is recognized as the drive for 
 the deviate pizza acceleration unit.(see ms-dos manual for fdisk information 
 or call 1-888-DEV-IATE) now once you've moved the received .piz, the 
 accelerator should slow down the electrons of the pizza. slowed down, the 
 electrons form a binary signature only the dev-e-8-1000 would understand. it 
 sends this information to the modulation/demodulation unit where the binary 
 is transfered from buffer binary to actual particle make-up strands. the 
 modulator then creates the neccesary matter from the energy it collected in 
 the process of slowing pizza atoms down. then appearing on your pizza input 
 buffer will be said pie.

    now we'll let mindcrime tell you a bit about the accelerator unit.  
   
   +-- - the subatomic super pizza accelerator, a concept all its own - --+
    
    so you want to know how the actual pizza acceleration works, don't you?
 well, look no further, because for the first time anywhere we present to
 you the actual pizza acceleration process.
    with a pizza on the buffer plate, you press the "sTAWT" button. this
 starts the beautiful process in motion. the buffer plate vibrates at speeds
 exceeding the speed of light. this accelerates the particles of the pizza
 to the point where their molecular bonds breakdown. as the individual 
 particles release themselves from the bond of the pizza, the buffer scanner
 executes a high-level scan on them. this determines the composure of the
 molecule as well as its place in the completed pizza. the particle is then
 released from the confines of the machine and is free to float about in
 space. the information from the molecule is stored in the pattern buffer.
 this process is repeated for each and every molecule in the pizza, at very
 high speeds. all together it takes about 5 seconds. the pattern is then
 converted into a file, as described above, and is free to be transfered and
 manipulated. 
    now, you may be asking where the energy from all those broken bonds goes
 to. well, this is the best part of the entire machine: it is completely 
 self-powering! the energy created by the destroying of molecular bonds is
 captured in our patented dev-e-8-495^E energy harness and used to power
 the machine. what isn't used is stored in the dev-e-8-496^F energy storage
 facility for use in future pizza accelerations.

                             +-- - the end - --+

    well, there you have it, folks! the dev-e-8-1000 subatomic super pizza
 accelerator. contact surreality enterprises at the above address for 
 information and brouchures on the dev-e-8-1000! you can get your very own,
 just as soon as the fda and fcc approve it!

    there i am. alone in a room full of people. my eyes fixed on a single 
 point, static in a world of dynamic mischief. a couple converses by the 
 dripping water cooler, their words mixed into the never with those of past 
 participants in the art. i cannot hear their words, but i see their pain.
 i can feel it: the pain of a thousand dead souls that lurks within the being
 of all of us. she turns away, trying to deny it.

    i can hear their footsteps, but see only the motion blur of passing legs.
 they do not stop, but i feel the stare of their always naked eyes. why must 
 they all look at me when they pass? i always thought i was one of them, but 
 they are all blind. these souls look out from within them but they never 
 return the action. the divits in the staring pole are all i see now; how the
 irony drips from the situation. their lives are full of holes.

    they move throughout each day, pacing the hallowed halls of this 
 maddening sanatarium. reality doesn't exist in here and time ticks slowly,
 counting the seconds away in that monotone voice that fades in and out of
 existance. the clock no longer ticks forward for me; it counts backward
 through the neverending pain of monotany. he chases on, trying to control 
 her.

    something once made me stay here, put up with the punishment and watch
 my life fade. those shackels are gone now, and i feel compelled to get up,
 to look elsewhere, but i'm scared. we're all too damn scared. 

    i get up and slide across the floor. the door opens for me as if to
 welcome the scorching light upon my pale and deprived body. it slams shut 
 and i never look back. never, never look back.

    i don't know why i write. did you ever look back at a piece and think 
 "now that's really not how i feel at all." i do it all the time. i'll write
 something and it won't reflect a single piece of my personality. it will
 be a wholy independant thought that worked itself inside my brain, but was
 really only passing through. i feel detached from my work, but i guess i
 often hope it will hit someone else and they will say "yeah, i totally
 understand." or maybe it won't. either way, i'm hoping it provides 
 entertainment, because that really is the reason i release this 'zine to
 the general public: for your entertainment. i don't expect people to get 
 anything out of it, or stare at it like a picasso and ponder the meaning of 
 it's every brush stroke. i believe that entertainment should be the core
 of any good existance. if life doesn't entertain you, then what reason is
 there in entertaining it?
    now, go on with your life as usual and entertain yourself some more. if
 you find it necessary, drop me a line and let me know what you thought of
 this issue. i love feedback, it gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling inside. until
 then, live on and don't let the man get you down.
