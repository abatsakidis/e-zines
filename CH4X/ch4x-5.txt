all #conf fucks who feel that somehow throwing a conference everyday
prooves how skilled they are, #toronto morons who feel that they can
actually mack these so-called "girls" (who we all know are 13 year old
boys whacking off to their cyber sex logs), #toronto fools who
think they're elite because they're running Red Hat (which they
read about in "Toronto Computes" - the magazine entitled to reviews on
Netscape plugins, etc.), suburban kids who think they're all political /
intelectual when they discuss issues such as Toronto's homeless when
ironically enough, the homeless would tell them to fuck off if they
approached them! I hope you get the low down on rather ch4x would like you
or not.

OK OK, so i dont know all the people I might have listed here, but its the
impressions i get from those who ruin it for them which cause me to throw
out such a high volume of disrespect.

[ Whats New ]-------------------------------------------------------------

Welp here I am, masta demos - your new editor/producer/pr0n-king for
ch4x0rz1n3 due to phaceman's recent vanishing off the bremeuda
triangle.

Well, welcome to the long awaited ch4x0rzin3 #5.  I have to thank all the
new people hanging with us, and making the zine even more possible with
their support!  I've been really busy, so I have not been able to write
any articles, however, I do promise at least two good articles for ch4x #6
- October 1999.

Anyways, it is now time to sit back, relax, and get jiggy with IT. "IT"
being your hand covered with the KY Jelly you stole from your momma'z
yeast infection prevention/remedy kit.

Getting even and fux0ring with Bell Canada

Holy fuck man. Wheres the Fucking 10 cents a minute when youre calling
from a fucking payphone. I recently visited Collingwood, an area 2 hours
away from Toronto and it costs me $3.30 a MINUTE worth of N-ACTS tones to
call home. Like WTF? It's 2 hours away. It should be fucking local or some
shit. Ok i understand, calling Vanuatu (Island in south Pacific) costs
10.55 a minute from a payphone. I understand it has to go through the
satellite and shit like that but a 2-hour drive? 3.30 a minute? Fuck That.

Fuckin' Bell Canada thinks they've got it made. They charge way too much
money for long-distance calls, three-way calls and regular service.
Like fuck that. Im paying 72$ a year (6$ max a month) for three way calls.

A service which costs Bell $0.00 to perform. Dont forget the $360 bux0rz
per year for regular service. So you say, "What can I do?"

Rob a fucking Remote.

[ Whats a remote ]--------------------------------------------------------

A remote is a small switch setup in residential areas or commercial areas
to switch small areas and alleviate pressure off the DmS-100's.
They are little huts about the size of a hotel room. Usually smaller.
You'll see them on the sides of roads, in fields, behind houses, basements
of skyscrapers, in the back of your local Pizza Pizza. (Really!).
They will often have a DMS-1U box or two out front with some heavy duty
fone wires connected off a pole.

[ What's in a remote ]----------------------------------------------------

Item List                       Retail Value    Street Value
2 Vista 350 Meridian Phones     $200-300 each   $20-50 maybe

1 Switch (Usually DMS-10 or     $5000-20000     $0
RSC systems)

Switch Manuals                  $20-50          $0
 -Power Maintenance
 -System Commands
 -Hardware Support

Switch Configuration Sheets     $0              $0

List of other Remotes!@!        $0              $1

Robbing a remote does not get you very much profit. Maybe a free fone.
Move to next section.

[ How much does it cost Bell if I destroy a switch ]----------------------

					$
2 Vista 350 Meridian Phones             500
1 Switch                                10000
Wiring from outside into Switch         500
Technicians Pay to repair fone service  2000-3000
$24 per hour * 10 hours day
+ Bonus for Emergency and middle of
night. For 5 Technicians
Repairing damages to Internal building  3000
Wasted money in a Security Audit
into finding no one responsible         5000+

Days without fone for residents in area 1-2
Damages to company from Suing residents ???
                                        -----
Total-                                  $21,500

Now. Remember. I have never done this and never will do it. Probably.
This is just a way to repay Bell for all the great things its done for
you. btw.. This is NOTHING in DAMAGES compared to the same thing if you
did it at a CO. In a CO. You could create more than 1 million dollars
damage.


[ What shall I bring? How do I destroy a switch ]-------------------------

First, bring along a baseball bat, an axe, boltcutters(Optional), some
Gasoline some matches and a lot of nerves to be willing to do this.
Enter the Remote. Take the Vista Phone. Use your axe to destroy the pipes
and wires by the entrance door which lead to the fire alarm button. Smash
it good. Smash through the wires leading to the switch. Now take the
baseball bat and hammer away at the switch. Remember, You'll prolly want
to cut the power to the switch first. Sometimes there is a backup
generator there also. Smash that well. Before you take the gasoline and
light the place up. Go to the fence and make sure there is a safe get away
hole because that place will light up faster than Cliff Zarudny's cock
looking at a naked 5 year old boy. Use the bolt cutters to cut a hole in
the fence. Now go into the remote and pour the gasoline all over. Now take
the matches. And toss one in and run run run! If you want there to be no
evidence, stay in there as well. And let the fire burn the evidence in its
entirety. hhahaha. Actually dont do that. One less enemy of Bell Canada is
a bad thing. Yeah, make sure you get out quickly or dont light the thing
up at all. If youre not gonna light it dont pour gas because even if it
would be funny to have a Bell tech get toasted in there. That is not
funny. No deaths. Death is not good. Remember that, next time you think
you're gonna get on the news because Vandalism for a young offender is one
thing. Murder is quite another. Be cautious.


[ How do I get into the Remote ]------------------------------------------

Well, there is a barbed wire fence surrounding this small building and
there is a simplex(Combination), 5 digit passcode doorlock on the door.
Getting that info is up to you.

For us K-R4D l337 olsk00l b0yz from ch4x this is no problem.
Except the fact that Bell keeps giving out the wrong passcodes accidently
they are so unorganized you might get the right code. You might not.
If you have no life. Sit across the road for 1 week and watch the techs go
in and out the passcode will be 5 digits with 2 numbers being pressed at
the same time.


[ But Im an 31337 h4x0r. Not a vandal! ]----------------------------------

Fine. H4x0r away then, but you'll need a laptop running special terminal
software. Further info is in a manual you'll find in there.
You can't do much shit from a remote. If there is another computer in
there it will have access to Bell's intranet but the switch itself is
basically garbage and not the good garbage like the SPN CO's dumpsta, if
you know CLLI's. The value of the garbage may be slightly higher than the
garbage from Holy Chow Chinese food or some shit. btw... never go in a
chinese food dumpster ive learned from experience. Worst thing ive ever
done. Anyways, It has no links to other switches. Best thing? Maybe making
someones fone ring over and over again. Without being traced. I donno.


[ If Bell Security chases me what will I do. ]----------------------------

h0h0h0h0. Who cares. Don't just stand there and let your face go whiter
than the Masked h4x0r aka. BB elite h4x0r. himself.

"Buddy! Buddy! Come back here! I call police. I call police!"

Most Techs are fat, arrogant bastards who don't like exercise.
If you get caught in a Bell building and try to open the door, but see the
bottom of a coat and shoes there. GET those BRASS KNUCKLES ready!!!
hahhahahaha. (CO Party '99) Or claim your a DmS Apprentice who just
happens to be fixing computers in a CO at 2am. hahahahahahah. Sounds
familiar!!! Ok now im just rambling

Oh and remember, Vandalism, Computer Crime Fraud, Telecommunications
Fraud, Breaking and Entering, Tresspassing, Arson, and any other criminal
act I covered in this article is VERY VERY WRONG. DO NOT ATTEMPT ANY. I
have never done anything like this nor ever will. If you really want to
know I found all my remote switch information in a buried at the bottom
of a swamp in Alabama when I went watch di9ital marry his cousin.
YEE-HAH!

Editing The Windowz NT Registry (c) coffee

-coffee
-ch4x #5 @ www.lucidx.com/ch4x

[ intro ]-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Registry is a central database that is created by Windows NT during
installation. The entries in that database consist of the hardware,
software, users, and preferences data for a single computer, or any
computer on a network. Whenever the user makes changes to the Control
Panel settings, File Associations, System Policies, or installed software,
the changes are reflected in the Registry. Like, back up your Registry, if
you fuck shit up you will be sad and you will cry like a baby. Like, NT is
a growing force which you need will to school yourself about. Some might
say you shoudn't bother, that all you need is to know about UNIX based
operating systems, HEH, if hear you someone say that rip off their arms
and let them feel real pain.

[ registry edit0r ]-------------------------------------------------------

You can find the Registry Editor in your system dir. Copy that onto a
backup disk if it pleases you to do so. For future reference you need only
choose Run|Regedit if you only want to run the program. Once Regedit is
open you should see My the six HKEY folders.

As your tool of control over your NT environment, you will have to know
Regedit intimately. There is no point being in the driving seat if you
can't use a steering wheel, and there is no point getting into a car if
you don't know how to turn the keys. Fuck sake, just step away from the
car!! Err, enough with the confusing metaphors. Below is an extract from
a Windows NT help topic.

[ Overview Of Registry Editor ]-------------------------------------------

Registry Editor is an advanced tool that enables you to change settings
in your system Registry, which contains information about how your
computer runs. Generally, it is best to use Windows controls to change
your system settings.

You should not edit your Registry unless it is absolutely necessary. If
there is an error in your Registry, your computer may become non
functional. If this happens, you can restore the Registry to its state
when you last successfully started your computer. For instructions, see
Related Topics below."

As you can see it is the usual bullshit from the bureaucrats at
Microsoft. I think what they are really trying to say is that if you

start fucking with the Registry you have passed the point of no
return. Warning lame users off from things that might get icky is a
sort of Microsoft trademark. They are safe in the knowledge that their
half assed assessment of Regedit will frighten most people away. The
most key utility to controlling your NT box is hidden away with no
shortcuts and a whole nine lines devoted to describing it, most of
which fits into the Microsoft play-it-safe agenda.


[ hkey structure ]--------------------------------------------------------

[ Hkey_Classes_Root ] -- [ Hkey_Current_User   ] -- [ Hkey_Local_Machine ]
[    Hkey_Users     ] -- [ Hkey_Current_Config ] -- [   Hkey_Dyn_Data    ]


[ hkey explanations ]-----------------------------------------------------

[1] Hkey_Classes_Root

This key points to a branch of Hkey_Local_Machine that describes certain
software settings. This key contains essential information about OLE and
drag and drop operations, shortcuts, and core aspects of the NT GUI which
we all think is so pretty =).

[2] Hkey_Current_User

This key points to a branch of Hkey_Users for the user who is currently
logged onto the system. Sort of like the equivalent of the Unix who
command but not really.

[3[ Hkey_Local_Machine

Contains computer specific information about the type of hardware,
software, and other preferences on a given PC. This information is used
for all users who log onto this computer. The data is stored in machine
code. The software side often includes the serial keys for products you
have registered and sometimes encrypted passwords.

[4] Hkey_Users

This key contains information about the users that log onto the computer.
Both generic and user-specific information is used, and each user who
uses the system has their own Subkey to accompany the .pwl file in your
system dir. The .pwl file contains the password data whilst the specified
Subkey contains all other information.

[5] Hkey_Current_Config

This key points to a branch of the Key Hkey_Local_Machine \Config that
contains information about the current hardware configuration. It is
updated when you use the Add New Hardware program.

[6] Hkey_Dyn_Data

This key points to a branch of Hkey_Local_Machine that contains various
bits of information regarding the System's Plug and Play configuration.
This information is DYNAMIC, meaning that it may change as devices are
added to or removed from the computer.


[ hkey explanationz ]-----------------------------------------------------

The thing about the Registry is that although Microsoft lean on it to keep
NT sharp, they are more dependant on it than you might realise. I mean
that they utilise it the running of other Microsoft products. Internet
Explorer for instance. Although it has been said that it is an integral
part of Windows. Microsoft were taken to court about it. The insides of IE
are stored in the Registry, including their Internet Options. I have read
Usenet posts about reg keys that lower the security zone in IE or enable
Java and other malicious shizz. Take for example the password encoded
censor Content Advisor Ratings. If any of you twelve year old code kidz
want to disable their censors, stopping you from downloading a shit load
of porography, find the below key in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.


\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Ratings\Key

Now just rename Key to something else e.g. KeyFucked. The next time the
Content Advisor Ratings are running the system will not be able to find
the key it is searching for. Yay. They key actually contains the
encrypted password information. I'm sure you can already think of ways
that this might be useful. If you are interested in this topic I suggest
you do research on algorithms. A very interesting topic.


[ hidden sharez ]---------------------------------------------------------

You must have seen the hype concerning all those dumb trojans. Any guy off
the street could own a Windows box, am I right? Well anyone who has ever
had to remove a nasty proggie will know where the server implants itself,
the Registry. For the trojan to function 24/7 it needs to initialise every
time NT starts up. Now I don't think Back Orifice would have been quite as
popular if it required you to place a shortcut in the Startup folder or a
line in win.ini.

You can create the lame trojan effect with a Registry key that uses the
DOS prompt as the client for controlling the target computer. This works
by connecting to shares. Shares are what Windows uses to share resources
from computer to computer. The NetNinja Setup trojan creates the C$ admin
share in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Network\LanMan\C$

This will assign the remote shared drive to the next available letter on
the user's machine and grants full read/write access. When run, the Setup
trojan creates a hidden share of drive C: and it places four entries in
that key as follows.

"Flags"=dword:00000302
"Path"="C:\\"
"Remark"=""
"Type"=dword:00000000

Two things cause the share to be invisible. The "$" at the end of the
name hides any share from the NET VIEW command and to Net Watcher's
shared folder listing. The Setup Trojan can be downloaded from:

http://www.netninja.com/files/SetupTrojan.zip


[ registry programming ]--------------------------------------------------

Now, before I start I must say that there really is no such thing as
Registry programming as such. Well, not for ordinary users. Although we're
not about to code Win32 API functions, better to take the messy approach,
pacthing code and sticking it in. Similar to patching hex or binary
because if you move one space or character out of place then the
executable will dysfunction, no questions asked. It is important to
understand this.

However editing your Registry is easier because it's values are often
represented by real words and the more you look at and change keys, the
more you will recognise things that repeat. Sort of eqivilant to a higher
level programming language. Of course, the reason that actaul reg keys
onn their own don't equate to a programming language is because there is
only similarities, never defined code. They use all sorts of values as
well such as binary, hex, hexadecimal etc. Open up all reg keys in Wordpad
and save new ones in Wordpad. It is important you use Wordpad and not any
other text editor, because you need the formatting it uses. DOS Edit will
fuck your shit up big time.

Below is a reg key which opens up all files with an unrecognised file
extension with DOS Edit. Instead of opening the Open With dialog box
you will be brought straight into DOS Edit to view the files. This is
handy for viewing files made in Unix with no extensions. Note the
Registry definition "ASCII Viewable Document" which means a text file
"Content Type"="text/plain". Of course if you have ever fooled around
with DOS Edit before you will notice it doesn't support executables.
This means if you use it to open a .exe file it will represent it in
text as best as is possible. This key also ties defines .nfo and .diz
as plain text file types. This is handy because although they are
famous file extensions they were not created with any text editor in
mind so this reg key tells the system they are text files without
having to reformat them with a fixed text editor.

Hkey_Local_Machine directory is the key to controlling your Windows

This file describes the Blue Box Fraud Detection feature within the DMS
(Digital Multiplex System) family of switches (so y0u sexy b0ys dont cry t00
hard when the police slam s0me cuffs 0n y0u).


[Blue?]----------------------------------------------------------------------

A 'blue box' is defined as any device connected to a subscribers
phoneline that can prodouce both a 2600 Hz tone and
multifrequency(MF)digits.


[Description]----------------------------------------------------------------

The Blue Box Fraud Detection feature works by discovering the fraudlent MF
signaling over Centralized Automatic Message Accounting (CAMA) and
SuperCAMA trunks. It does not detect fraudulent signaling over Traffic
Operator Position System (TOPS) trunks. The feature can alert the telco of
a fradulent call attempt and either allow billing to be made for the call
or disconnect the call (described later).

NOTE: The feature detects the fraud MF singaling but does not detect the
SF (Single Frequency that is) pulsing

The feature allows the DMS-200 to perform fraud detection functions:

* test for fraudlent calls

* record fraudulent calls (voice/actions)  - 0h shugar$!!!

* cut or continue the fraudulent call



[Process]--------------------------------------------------------------------

To the switch (and telco), a fradulent call is taken place when the
perpetrator (yes thats you ace) performs two steps:

1. A normal call is placed to a Single Frequency (SF) trunk beyond his or
her billing office.

2. The fraudulnet call is placed. This call uses the SF trunk seized for
the original, normal call.

-The perpetrators billing office does not detect calls placed with a blue
box, hence the term 'blue box fraud'

The diagram below describes how a perpetrator -initiates- a fradulent call

[1] - normal call placed (say, 1 800-463-3796)
[2] - end office sends dialed digits to the CAMA office
CAMA office recieves the data from the End Office and seizes an outgoing
trunk. The Office at the far end of the trunk (dialed number) 'winks' in
response and the CAMA office sends the called digits for this normal call.

NOTE: No fraud has taken place, youve just dialed a number.

***The 'wink' is sometimes audiable, sounding like a little chirp or beep***


[Testing]--------------------------------------------------------------------

It is this wink (as described above) that triggers the dms-200 to start
testing the call. The diagram below shows how the DMS-200 prepares to test
for a (suspected) fraudulent call.

[1] - The DMS-200 establishes a broadcast connection from the suspect CAMA
trunk (y0u) to a MF (Multi Frequency smart man) receiver (MFR) as
designated in the feature setup (described later). These reserved MFR are
not available for standard call processing.

After the MFR is attached, the DMS-200 waits for one of the following
events:

[MFR Timeout]
This is the time to detect fraudulent MF digits has expired.

Responce: Release the MFR - assume no fraud has taken place
[Call Failure]
Mutilated digits detected by the MFR. Several things could cause this.

Call may have been released
The pepetrator may be usuing SF pulsing

Responce: Release the MFR - assume no fraud has taken place

[Digits]
A fraudulent set of called digits has been recieved.

Responce: Use Automatic Message Accounting (AMA) Event information.
Flag the call as a bluebox call. Release the MFR. If the 'CUT' option
has been specified in the feature, disconnect the call (described later).

The DMS-200 will preform these functions after detecting a fraudulent
call:

If the 'CUT' option was not activated, replace the original digits in the
buffer with the fraudulent digits (from MFR).

!!!- If you place more then one fraudulent call, only the last call
appears in the buffer -!!!

[Cut? Continue?]

As mentioned above, there are two options for kids like us.
Either 'CUT' or 'CONTINUTE' the badboy bluebox call.

[CUT]

To cut the call the DMS-200 will preform these actions:

-Release the MFR
-Release the conntion between the originating and terminating agents of the call
-processes the AMA info     - 0hgn0!$!
-deallocates the terminator
-sets treatment for the originator (thats you ace)

[CONTINUE]
If the cut option was not specified with the feature (described later) the
DMS-200 releases the MFR and the call continues. The perpetrator is billed
on the fraudulent digits.

When the subscriber disconnectes the call, the system generates a log and
turns off the alarm if the ALARM option was specified (described below)

[Interface]---------------------------------------------------------------------
**(The following assumes you have atleast a small idea of how to use the 
MMI coresponding to a DMS switch)**

The feature is activated by a CI command. The same command is used to get
the status of the feature. The following describes the syntax for the
feature.

The 'core' command is: BLUEBOX

variables with the BLUEBOX command are as follows:

ACT - Activates the feature with the specified number of MFR to be set
aside

CLR - Deactivates the command, returning the MFR to the common pool

nmfr - specifies the number of MFR to be reserved (range: 1 though 3) -
default
number of MFR is 1.

timeout - specifies the number of seconds the MFR will wait for fraudulent
digi$(range 5 though 35) - default is 30.

ALARM - specifies if an audible/visual alarm will be generated when a blue
box
call is detected.

CUT - Specifies that the fraudulent blue box calls will be disconnected.
If thisis not specified, the call will continue.

Command Format:

BLUEBOX ACT/CLR [NMFR] [TIMEOUT] [ALARM] [CUT]
[Examples]

In order to see if the feature is active on the switch you would simply
input
the following:

> BLUEBOX

You will receive some k-rad1cle mumbo jumbo like this:

Blue box Fraud Detection Feature Status:
Inactive.

The smart frame techs didnt finish thier mail-in colledge
telecommunications degree when getting bum bum sex from thier cellmate
'magic' in the don jail.

-[1]-

To activate the Blue Box Fraud Detection Feature with default parameters
you would enter the following:
> BLUEBOX ACT

It best give you this message:

Blue Box Fraud Detection Feature Status:

Active
1 MFR reserved, timeout set to 30 seconds.

Done. You've activated the feature.

-[2]-

To activiate the feature with 5 MFR reserved, A timeout of 30 seconds,
Alarm and cut the call you would input:

> BLUEBOX ACT 5 30 ALARM CUT

System will give you this responce:
Blue Box Fraud Detection Feature Status:
Active
5 MFR reserved, timeout set to 30 seconds.
Detection will report alarm.
Detection will cut off call.

-[3]-

To disactivate the feature simply input:

> BLUEBOX CLR

the system responds with:

Bluebox Fraud Detection Feature Cleared.

Well, here we are ; the end of another ch4x0rzin3.  I hope you enjoyed
reading! Whoa, did #5 ever take a long time!  Not really, considering a
lot of the shit that has gone down! Unfortunately, I was not able to
release any of my articles for this version of ch4x0rzin3, however, I WILL
release at least two articles for ch4x #6.  Let me warn you, these
articles will be 0-day!  I would have released them, but my tight schedule
restricted my amount of time for my hobbies.

Anyways, I hope all you other groups, etc. did not take anything I said
towards you seriously. HEH.  Its just my style.  I'm profound, so I
usually say shit which I have no real feelings towards, yet is just said
to make people think "Fuck, dr. demos has been smoking too much of crazy
J's rasta plant!"

Lastly, I think I will release ch4x0rzin3 #6 as of October!  Hope to see
you then, and quite possibly on our OWN 24/7 connection!
