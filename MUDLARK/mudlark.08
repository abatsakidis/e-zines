AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION

It is a privilege for me to share this selection of fifty new American 
Haibun, as I term them, on the virtual pages of MUDLARK. The haibun is a 
prose passage, followed by a single-line haiku of a varying number of 
syllables.  In the American use of the form, the single line often 
extends beyond the original boundaries.  (Some writers follow the 
practice of using a traditional three-line haiku at the end.)

For me, the relationship between the prose passage and the haiku that 
follows is the key to the form.  Therein lies a spectrum of kindredness 
and tension.  As discoverer of that relationship, the writer is gifted by 
surprise as the image starts to clarify within the figurative pan of 
water being touched to urge forward a kind of small song.

I first became acquainted with the haibun in early 1984.  At that time, 
John Ashbery published "Six Haibun" in an issue of _Sulfur_. What struck 
me was the dazzle of American language that stretched and sharpened the 
form, changing it substantially from the Japanese haibun in translation 
that appeared in the anthology _From the Country of Eight Islands_.  
Those translations seemed to me comforting and quiet, if plain.  In 
fairness, change is inevitable in translation.  Clearly, though, the 
American language seemed to bring forward different possibilities that 
tempted exploration.

And, predictably enough, I was attracted to the form enough to to try 
writing one.  I discovered that the prose flowed naturally, possibly 
because the haibun invites acknowledgment of the common.  And in that 
acknowledgment, one is made weightless by the discovery of a deeper layer 
of reality that (when right) arrives unforced.  The sensation resembles 
that of a harmonic in music, wherein a string is touched lightly to 
produce a tone of higher frequency than if the string were pressed full 
force.

My first full-length book, WITH HOUSE SILENCE (Stride Publications, U.K., 
1987) was comprised exclusively of haibun.  I have since composed a 
number of these poems, which have appeared in other collections, 
including SAD ISN'T THE COLOR OF THE DREAM (Stride, 1991); A CLOVE OF 
GENDER (Stride, 1995); and FALLING IN LOVE FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU 
SYNTAX:  SELECTED AND NEW POEMS (Potes & Poets Press, 1997).

It is possible that my use of the form has changed over the 13 years I 
have been loving it.  For one thing, the poems arrive quite naturally, 
along with each delicate surprise that happens at the end when prose is 
followed by a space that in turn is followed by a line.  For me, haibun 
seem to happen forth in full sound costume as my mind plays in the 
language only to find what later will be called work.

HE COULD NOT SING

He could not sing worth dimples but she let him anyway because he paid 
the water bills that furnished all their showers.  Echo chambers lease 
themselves to vocalists with appetites to match the butter knives and 
drapes, the carpet and the patio, the lacy trees with verdigris alert for 
photographs.  A piano for the photographs of relatives unhappy with their 
fate whatever they might choose to name it.  He could not sing worth 
contents of confessionals in parishes they'd left but she was game for 
all the notes that sounded tongue-in-cheek.  He let them rinse themselves 
out of the sacrament they were with condiments and vague connections to 
another earth.  He could not sing a capella until midnight wore itself to 
dawn.  When she would hear him ruining the house with what she wished 
were trepidation but resembled much more closely self affection 
brightened by the signals he'd received.  He could not sing worth 
unemployment checks that he would never greed.  He loved his weight and 
exhalation.  And he loved to hear the evidence of having shucked his 
childhood with affection pinched out of the Tupperware and all the breath 
gone from the fresh mint leaves and chicken broiled just right.  He had 
no inclination of a way to celebrate the lime or oven or the toasted 
light.

Irreverence, a pilot light sustained by the amendment of some purity 
recovered from the lost and found

FULFILLMENT CENTER

A customer has circus on the brain.  Beautiful brain, electrified and 
tantalizing brain that feeds us generously often.  Go ahead and mention 
what you like.  I'll look it up.  Then waive something that most likely 
offers the capacity for making music.  What do you call that portion of 
the eye one pays to  have peeled off to sharpen sight glands?  Out front 
are satisfaction surveys.  Receptionists trained to hear and to absorb 
taunts and confusion.  Guest psychologists to help you love what we will 
go on selling anyway.  To heal what we foresee as an unnecessary 
emptiness by mix-and-match technology.  In the middle of rank-ordered 
depth, to lift above this planet in a swirl of what is labeled rapture on 
account of certain items owned.  To enter a relationship with something 
inanimate changes the way you think about the concept reciprocity.  That 
one side "does the work" no longer is the issue.  There are majestic 
ladderings to think about.  Drugs to paint onto the body's scape.  That 
likely recall some wonder of the world from an unclear though jubilant 
perspective.  Lifts in the shoes to resurrect prior mentalities.

Tenderness afforded inventory, touch as the deciding...

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

Opportunity shows itself to the door not properly seated on its hinges.  
Each time the snare drum mail arrives, I'm in a blanket pondering the 
cleanest hatch to lift from.  It isn't every day a preposition makes you 
an offer that you can't indemnify.  Get lost was all he practiced saying, 
despite my paying yards of bucks to have her listen to his gibber.  Drool 
ran down what seemed once a coffer, and I held firm to the belief it was 
whatever I could picture and then scan into my neighbors' heads.  What 
are they thinking to each other without language.  The more he doesn't 
say, the more it costs me.  Champions report taking an average dose of 
the small delicious pink pill of 14.4 milligrams.  And that it dampens 
the downward blink to a degree that's not supported by peculiar body 
gravity. Relax in the Baroque way of inhering each likely pattern of the 
stones embedded in my new silk plants supposed to simulate a being that 
would share this oxygen.  The string of words ought to provide a demo 
mentioning that one had lived within the limits of a certain mood all 
acre long and spread a little influence like bird seed somewhere bought.  
It's tempting to give no report at all some days.  I hear her skittering 
in the yard as nervously as something owned.  The compass in my pocket 
points where I direct it.  Who's paying bills here.  For every furnace 
that affection comes to, an equal and residual retreat smarts its way 
back into a centerfold.  That would collapse whatever mute extensions 
happen to occur to the thought process.  The concert mistress simply 
bowled over the thrifty crowd by virtue of how long she'd kept her 
strings intact.

Knockwurst, tribulations, hosing down the patio and sidewalk, blank paper

INTERMITTENCIES

Her kiss just like a whisper passed the salvos juxtaposed with sacredness 
albeit sans configuro repealant's morphity ping prongless saturelment 
acre-ease my chinstrap en route to grass courts, my glass skirt 
challenging the light of gravity's hospitable brick fossil path.  Play 
the oceanic form of cradle in amazed left-justified machine inclusive of 
slip covers and Jurassic lullabilia.  So many prose glyphs numen their 
way sofaward.  Until collaborative safety moans into unwanted facial hair 
of someone salty in the month of June's apres-midi continually lurking 
east of nest points in the fois gras of contagious dithers who becomes 
important to have touched within the tone row bylines of an apple aimed 
at teachers' desktops scattered through the temporary building.

Gel confronted as non-substance, then erased into some substance, 
fatherwear and things to come

__________________________________________________

CONFIGURATO

I thought of having a rubber stamp made into just my name, and punching 
it on things to freshen up this plain white achy paper, make it look like 
Neiman's where my friend finds solace.  She frequently invites me to have 
meals when someone's being honored, and the best people to have come 
display allegiance.  Sometimes dollar bills exude a form of kindness 
those without them don't expect.  I ask myself continually how instinct 
relates; how you can place parameters on _second hand_.  I have been 
schooled, this is not pure, I have been engineered to have believed.  And 
trained in various arrangements of reality, such as:  "Whoever falls into 
your path becomes your (sole) responsibility."  That's Christianity in 
one slanted lump.  The right connections are essentially immoral's what I 
get from this.  Setting aside amounts of time to make those webbings 
would be wrong, when there are people to take care of _(Who has time to 
leaf through space!)_ right here in our community!  You don't get far 
when worshipping according to a recipe.  I'm part of that small domed 
interior posing as duty-bound with no evil intentions.  I can tell you 
right now, I'm as clear as anyone can get, despite my father's words 
"There are no pure motives."  He simply wanted to de-gush my mother's 
skewed perspective, which I think he thought concerned an impulse 
fundamentally acquisitive.  Second guessing comes to be a hobby when your 
faith prevents your knowing things.  Ironically, then, time is spent like 
water.  Fears grounded in all things that we have wasted, all that we 
have yet to waste.  To be invited is to have been acquired in some small 
way. People invest in shoring up support for what they like to see 
believed.  I'm one of them.  Can prove what you've been taught may be as 
insufficient as your yield.  But that's another story.

Consecutives all in a row, predictable as the intended flowers placed 
along intent-ed lawns

WHAT NEXT

Neighbors who were mild all of a sudden burst into 24-pack types with 
friends clogging their patio at four a.m. and we are left deciding upon 
things that we might try, to snuff out the activity without inducing 
problematic reflex.  There is this gland appearing to act up.  When all 
we wanted was to breezeway our small lives into a comfort.  No one's 
fighting, it is just the hour lacking in music and the full assortment of 
cans left in the middle of the table.  Move, countermove, and move again.  
People milling around to find out where they might hold still.  There is 
the language barrier which dribbles fear across the bibs of the routinely 
competent who shrivel when it's time to talk with hands.  However you 
might read this filter, it's upstaged by future possibilities.  Good 
morning, say the innocents.  Good morning, say the sunbathers.  Good 
morning say the sperm and egg that have not met.  What kind of 
temperature might we be talking about.  Hamstrung by others' moods and 
templates, prestigitators and commandments strung together in a fray of 
fitness meant to tide us over at the onset of an oligarchic sentencing.

Joystick and its recent disappearance, gender studies, practicing the 
hymns in English then reverting to the Latin

SAFE PLACES

She telephones Utah, reasoning the date and time, day of the week into 
her conversation.  He has rested, might be resting still.  Snow shine, 
small matters to report.  She covers each thing.  Bathing.  Walking the 
presiding evidence as shakenly as one would move without a cane through 
things.  Talks of relatives as though their lives were not replete with 
miniscule details that fashion volumes.  She helps him reconstruct the 
day so far.  She says the same thing she just said with variation, 
filling out the blanks if there are blanks.  Having reached the topic 
basketball, in which her fluency is worthy of a prize. The use of names, 
a chant. Speaks slowly as though mouthing  prayer to some considerate, 
familiar God.  The air conditioning goes on midway between some 
syllables.  She and he enjoy a wavelength.  She thus paces the talk, 
pronouncing what is said.  The day was right to call, the other relatives 
have left his town.  He is unnoticeably alone, receives her conversation 
well.  She gentles both their ways past sadness that would come of 
letting him recall a fleck of what he was.  Fills him in on what is true.  
He might support her, though it's not his habit to be obvious.  As 
support's supposed to be quiet.  She mentions breaking of the car she 
purchased from his brother, now deceased.  A car that would have harmed 
her children.  His remarks remain inaudible as far away as in this room.  
She's waiting to put on the game between the Heat and Knicks.  Her plan 
for Sunday afternoon.  The date and time as real as any thunder or 
residual.  She knows he picks up on the flow of story.  Something to 
attend.  The tangibles can form a tale.  She tells him we will share a 
car.  He shows an interest in details. Food enters the conversation.  Her 
voice lilts in a way I know he finds familiar.  Very much her mother's 
child.  Sing-talking all the day's pronouncements.

Semiautomatic love, reading odometers for fun, comparing notes, comparing 
distances

A RELAY

Would you mind feeling my forehead, easing off the see-through pendula 
with gravity placed top of mind?  I'm not sure when I'm comfortable, and 
my doubt competes with ways to measure rain.  Remember all those alto 
leanings that accentuate the cornucopia, distinct from latitude and 
long-.  A feet-first approach to diving captivates the hearts but not the 
minds of judges.  Whose eyes linger on aquaria, expecting to find results 
where there were simply false economies.  My favorite tracer lifts off 
parity and borrows trade and tapestry.  Remember to write thank-you notes 
to those you think you'll love during retirement.  The one of us most 
glyphy speaks four languages.  How do you know when you are being well?  
It's time to play the resource game.  Permit me to introduce our four 
contestants recently found playing golf on acreage you would be hard 
pressed to believe.  Who have declared a moratorium on glee and excess 
paint along the wide diameter intended to escort the entrails of a recent 
peace.  She told me she would not be left holding the body chemistry like 
that.  That I would have to learn to fend...and that whatever I declared 
to like, I'd have to make myself in green or any colors symbolizing 
brains and competence and frenzy to prove that I had worked myself into a 
possible return.

Cavities that grow into analyses of the survivors of the jaundiced 
practice of amazement handed down

__________________________________________________

HER NEIGHBORS ALL HAVE POWER

I am on the phone with the power company that serves South Bend, Indiana, 
to report my mother's lights and stove and heat are gone, and she is 
huddled in a blanket, unable to read, at eight o'clock at night, touching 
the phone occasionally, flirting with sleep.  Her neighbors all have 
power.  The street lamp blares outside her window.  And the flashlight 
batteries have gone to seed after the night before, the same as now, when 
she has telephoned to talk with me as though I were a real adult, and 
she, a child.  Last night it occurred to me that once I weighed three 
point five pounds.  Once I was all eyes.  The summer months were all I 
knew of light that I could not acquire.  My mother, premie, too, was 
balanced on the oven door to simulate the womb warmth in a format more 
objective, less familiar, one supposes.  For the country is itself warm 
insufficiently, with neighbors far away as stands of trees close to the 
river, strong unto itself and distant.  At no time in my life have I 
retracted the palaver found in jazz-smooth instruments.  That pours now 
from the speaker of this telephone beside me, into which I will report my 
mother's solitude, her fear, and mine.  I will recite the specificity of 
her concern, being surrounded as she is by lights she cannot use, 
belonging to her neighbors who are really very far away.  Here in the 
desert, there can never be sufficient light.  Today is muted with an 
inattention to the weather previously mild.  All snowstorm long we wore 
our attitudes of layered clothes, attempting to be renaissance interior 
designers, seeing things and hearing how they feel in contexts foreignly 
desired.  A woman's voice keeps interrupting now repetitive tonality and 
offering apologies and gratitude in general for a projected patience in 
which I do not partake.  She interrupts then a Metheny clone to say they 
care about our safety, and to watch out for power lines down in our yard, 
move ladders, antennas, brooms and poles away from those still in 
position. Her voice is soothing in its age a little bit ahead of mine.  
Now the music's snappy with a dab of perk. My keyboard seizes the 
attention, as I hear all representatives are handling calls from other 
customers.  Moths, I call them.  Looking for a little light, the way I 
do.  A mother whose warm liquid eyes would radiate a whole room when my 
size was so small as to be lost in someone's lap.  Apart from power lines 
and sediment.  The rocking horse of trees made to house better weather 
than our forbears owned.

Working in the yard, post storm, from far away a flash of lightning that 
defines the day and coming days

THERE WAS A SILLY PUTTY LOOK WITHIN HER LAZY EYE

Any time she was engaged in tasks, she failed to drag and click, as if to 
voice in screaming headline colors to the world this prime injustice. 
There was a silly putty look within her lazy eye when something was 
expected.  She could exaggerate and make it seem as though something 
imbued with too high a cost of doing business were ever there.  She was 
an expense.  The folly of expecting yams from stone seeds frittered to 
the point where only lawsuits could provide.  No one tuned sane would 
make requests of her.  She stretched things, but she never stretched.  
Consider the delivery system of her world, entrenched as it continued as 
a mantra, laden with a corrugated plunge into the dimness that inhibited 
the safety.  Pondered and then strained out of an unsafe situation.  All 
despite the coating of an angel whitening her arms right where the wings 
would be.

Sequest-, request, behest, unblooming all unwanted

__________________________________________________

METONYMY AS SUCH(NESS)

What a featured city this becomes, with both our living amid shade trees.  
Owning capacity to sort crust from the softness in these words we choose.  
Diplomacy is evidence of partial language. Our jobs define us; 
pointlessly we leisure from them. Cyclical means part of itself to people 
who like using the word.  Subtraction is just one form of arithmetic.  
Letting go differs from allowing.  The swimming pool on three-day weekend 
Monday will emit a drizzle of the coconut in lotion, and the conversation 
will be funds-related and intemperate where sexuality's concerned.  Who 
in the world spends any time at all performing or receiving. Conversation 
trembles to a brief conclusion that it might be possible to order from a 
catalogue and not come in under the lights and be exposed to all that 
personality paid to engage.  A sensitivity about some missing reciprocity 
is all.  In sum, there typically is little going on.  We dub our favorite 
tapes, dismembering the voice from visuals.  A transaction includes both 
pitch and catch, not simply gathering in one's arms what has fallen.  
Although these entities have been split into dualities.  People assigned 
to do part of a thing must then convene, a nuisance in itself.

Stardom or career as the excuse for someone's never reproducing

__________________________________________________

INCOMMUNITY

Virtuosi clinging to the prospect of a mother/father boundary refuse to 
play in tune, refuse not to have played in tune.  What ingredient laces 
former recipes to make sleep non-denominational.  That said, verbatim 
flings cost money when their skewed inflections scamper out of bounds so 
what was meant differs from what the hearers (naive and intact) declare 
they heard.  "It was nothing," insists the concert mistress.   But we 
know differently.  The way she touched the hand of the conductor.  All 
those needlings swelling in her eyes.  Binoculars tell what voice won't, 
as the body lacks defense against at least six senses.  Gemological 
societies defend their prize possessions others might desire to wear.  It 
made no sense the handlers of those instruments consistently would fail 
to get along.  As a rich man, he seemed unable to uninstall the program 
that had tamed him.  The allure of quicksand formed a pretense that itis 
not the most direct route downward.  Insufficent to be shimmering in some 
field then flounder as a child.  Abandonment remains contagious.  Those 
who have been left retain the gift of leaving in a way they do not feel 
themselves.  Of finding ones to love who do.  So rifts that canit make 
sense contribute to recidivism.  Language sharpens harsher language.  
Cinders with the sun on extrasensory small faces that guard  morning like 
a near-term darkness barely understood although completely frequent 
anymore.

Youth music, foreignness of the applause, solos contiguous and stitched 
together into something known, unsharable

__________________________________________________

STAGNATION

She wore a blouse belonging to her daughter.  Soiled the blouse, retained 
the blouse, and ruined the relationship's viscosity.  Easy-to-induce 
edges revealed their colors (true) and very soon the rift became its own 
cement block fence.  Where a curse liked being what a curse is best:  a 
kind of rainbow skitterish with scars that everybody knows they caused.  
What kind of insistence works best on a mind that's like a laser beam and 
hungry.  She told her daughter this or told her that and emphasized the 
ways in which her life was just her own.  Apart in other words from hers.  
In which the daughter could not find her, course correct, purchase on 
margin new affection more fitting and more easily described.

Familial treason, impartial links, still printing after learning cursive 
script

CORPORATE GIVING

The body ounces.  This is what the body does.  Retains its ounces.  To 
have stabilized.  So any extra would conform to a known wing.  Bring on 
shapely somethings.  Give them back so artfully there wouldn't be a 
shadow.   Calisthenics might remove the swelling from the dance.  When 
anyone might look there grows expensively neuralgia in the taint of 
things.  Is restitution likely, sure, emulsified.  Tell me something I do 
not already know.  The nominative redress invites a plum to have been 
whittled.  Drift away from all the profit in the sometimes happy lungs.  
Express more than you activate.  Describe as economically as you are 
capable of doing what makes up a verb.  Elastic fractions filter what is 
whole.  The paper had it wrong.  The radio.  Whoever wore a mood ring 
stiffened every urgency.  Erased the nap late Saturday as a reminder 
youth is a prerequisite to desirability.  When darkness is in touch, our 
interest begins to drift.  Nothing reportable.  Nothing reported.  Acres 
of this inclination last.  For once we have a curve to satisfy.  Which 
one of us is likely to be whole.  Which fastball will escape the wood.  
What will announcers have declared.

REMAKE

She said the upper echelon provided her a view minus the perk of 
ignorance that made her colorize vanilla standalones now looped into a 
circuitry conspiratorially understood.  There also was the issue of her 
mother and some blamelessness assigned out of convenience.  Green visors 
made both of them feel very much supported and at home in their 
surroundings.  Criminal neglect, though fosterable, challenged the 
alignment of the status quo, the system and amenities.  Imagine how it 
was, had been, within the room where she was treated amicably.  No longer 
a soprano.  License fees draining the principal, to the extent that she 
was cardboard and afloat in tiers all midnight long.  She had to get 
away, meaning the rigamarole failed to be transfigured once the clientele 
burned patterns in the screen.  Although the igloo was oppressed by warm 
breath, it remained within the scope of the agreement of longevity.  When 
you work for someone, you accept the healing in the windmill that propels 
the power.  _When you earn your living as a priest, you are already 
living in the afterlife_.  I am about to close my eyes.  My eyes remain 
about to close.  What's hanging on the line.  She's listening too 
attentively.  It's close, the air in here is close.  Preambling its way 
to Heathrow.  Just a couple floors away from numbered cloud.

Apology, wing wax, key tresses starting to define the shelves

INVARIATION

A daily low strength aspirin small and yellow keeps the heart one way.  
Routine the same as lust only without the need of speed bumps advertises 
a becoming look and feel.  The takers shun the skeptics.  Groups form 
around opinions.  Think of a religion as the missing of some points.  
A-fling around the rosy, more important who is not included than who is.  
Some exclamation points convene and leave mundane things in rows that 
don't do many things.  Undress and lie down in safe beds.  Allow the mind 
to shuffle days into less sense in color language so desirable it will 
repeat until what's real shifts to what will not be.  A clear coast if 
not one that's accessible.  Consider the communication spattered and 
impinging.  Having the objective of continuance if not of reproduction.  
Shoulders near another pair of shoulders.  Possibly resembling a 
communion.

THE SYNDROME OF THE CATALOGS

I have bushels full of opt. again.  I mean this inkling that I've had 
umbilically came true all over.  So I'm not so sure that I am here.  This 
weevil side of underthings someone predicted.  Where at times like this 
do you invest.  In temperature, in petty norms, in types of commerce 
people crop about when they have no drug store or toy shop for retreat.  
Collections and corrections and seashores of dust.  We're loose weavings 
of tentacles reflexively acquiring.  He contacts me from space with all 
his anchors having lost weight and his tone rows blanching.  Guide me 
home, I sometimes ask when he is looking like he's thinking about 
something else.  Is there a wild attraction full of seams that says the 
"Do not enter" sign's an invitation.  Promise me you'll find plainness 
fulfilling, I imply.  Again, he does not hear me.  He's ensconced in 
window shopping in the syndrome of the catalogues.  Why don't we leave 
this one alone, he's sure to say when I am truly steamed and hoping that 
my germs catch other homes for them.  He says again he'd like for us to 
cruise without control.  The arboretum's nice, why don't we go there and 
imagine why the trees half sturdy and half interesting seem to grope for 
an uncharted sky.  The only Romeo we know about in someone's heart has 
never had an artist's sketch and never will.  Somewhere well within the 
Adirondacks is a word, a person, and a hope that everything will smooth 
itself to newmown hay.  All things will gland.  And everything will sew 
itself to the companion frenzy everyone has waited for that cannot last.  
A camera capable of doing that has springs.  Leaps forward.  Links each 
of the pictures in a rapid-fire arrangement.  So everything that's 
possible bleeds into everything that's also possible.  And dry land makes 
a showing someplace in the middle of the sea.

Imagination, shown and told and gradually improved upon, the sparks that 
race like heartbeats, a request for transfer

A RANGE OF QUIET

Preponder health so opusly there is a little pile of things to show.  
Listen then to steely birds name treatises and low plane moan to go with 
twists in sky and quiet.  In this our neighborhood these squeaking things 
rehearse their own autonomy.  The verbiage slides into home again, people 
remark on what eventually mattered.  Osmosis is the major way of learning 
what is not worth learning anymore.  A range of quiet stays the course.  
Ethereal when we blush names into another cortex in the hope of code's 
eventually blossoming into weather.  If you land on this one 
concentration, maybe it will find inherent wings and you will own them 
and repair your life again.  The miniature fragrance is the cool tan of 
the christened birds the opposite monotony when something has been 
memorized.  Relax, retrace, forgive all sources and enjoy the 
derivations.

Branches for a reason, scope and sequence of the shoots, a clearing for

SCORCH

What makes a pontiff listened-to.  The punishable eros maybe that's 
surpassed the lengths of houses and the textured streets.  Form throttles 
the paced _assimilation_.  Concurs with furnace and the land and several 
varieties of taxi down the halt zone.  Cremation's not the way.  
Sforzando's not the way.  Pavillion's just a quarter hour from here, so 
here, let me escort you.  Three softgels of cod liver oil ease movement.  
Among the sandstone mountains and fishermen prospecting abundance.  Why 
don't you medicate the self you've advertised, begin the cycle of the 
cloning and the cycle of impediments.  It's treetop time, and time to 
mourn the space where growth's en route to trespass.  Breaking up won't 
happen by itself.  We're destined to accommodate what we already see into 
the future.  And future is a startling guess as pretty and as predicated 
as a mood swing.  Share and shave and panic just alike.

Routine, a sound the mobile makes in wind postured as icy or as heated 
breath

FORMING A BASE

Any mediocrity went unnoticed prior to the setting-in of pushy volunteers 
who wanted something no one could afford to get or give.  Motive candles 
muted pressure of the loaded words disintegrating under pinlights all 
donated for the cause.  The creditors knew how to multiply more than the 
donors who possessed no names, no business cards, and no addresses.  The 
only one who wore a watch spoke in blood-nasal voice.  Unposted signs 
were all around despite the epidemic switching-off of intuition when 
there never was a greater need. The telephone rang homelessly until those 
needing crashed before the inner sancta that belonged to those skilled in 
scaling brick exteriors.  Silence surrounded practice used to sharpen 
skills others would want.  And there were prices to be handed down as 
evenly as a consideration that concerned inclusion.  Results would always 
be originals having stiff penalties for copying, which in itself 
intensified the lust for generating multiples.

Who was not invited, far more interesting than who was, and the alliances

EVERYONE IS BUSY

Everyone is busy doing the unlikables.  Just barely mentioning the places 
on the body stung by a routine neglect.  Everyone parses logic hovering 
around vacations as though that were all of the relief available.  
Vacations thus expected to remove the heat of an abuse as common as a 
weekday, have it surgically removed or redirected.  Everyone is working 
late at plotting the escape, with the equation yet atop the mantel. 
Everyone is busy being interesting to people who cannot discern that no 
one is, it's just the marketplace being its sexy, hard-to-get self, on 
account of all the frenzy of the takers.  Everyone is piecemealing around 
among the leavings of the other everyones in hope of bringing accidental 
royalty by virtue of a spontaneous, deep-seated justice.  Everyone 
partakes of the identicality of butterflies and frozen syrup in twin 
columns.  Everyone is "fixing" to go home if they can figure where that 
is, knowing that it has to be decided once and have that be for all.

Breast feeding versus the bottle, process in relation to its outcomes, 
formidable-appearing patterns that might furnish happiness, despite the

NOT JUST A LEAFLET

Pressure need not be political.  There's emotional; there's physical; 
there's even a projection of two of the three types proposed. He wanted 
the whole heart, not just a leaflet of the things believed. Parading 
represented one way of reporting to the council, "Here, and there are 
more of me."  Collision coverage should not be confused with the 
inevitability of crash.  "I'm in the market for your money.  Tell me what 
I have to do to get it, short of an aggressive act."  These were the very 
words that started what he thought to call a beautiful relationship. You 
can take riches, feathers, or serotonin reuptake inhibitors to help make 
lines touch.  Matching's a sweet act.  People calling dogs along the 
sidewalk.  Using them as means less obvious for putting out their needs 
and lining up resources. My preferred solution to imbalance is to meet 
head-on the workpile.  Nothing like an obligation to chase bread for 
clarifying raison d'etre.  "So there," were his exact words.  And I 
bought them.

Do you consider yourself radical, do you consider yourself sensitive, 
what label would you put on gender (yours) for purposes that we consider 
(ours)

ENCRYPTION

Wood seemed to mean something.  I prefer a cover for the floor to foster 
integration of the accidental soil that oftens there.  Likely brought by 
Magi on their focus visit to discern one tiny thing.  My lower back feels 
lower than it's felt in days.  A neighbor who uses illness as a point of 
linkage asks how my arthritis is.  I discourage any inference that my 
case equates to even half a case.  For I'm in general a pillar of good 
fortune and good health.  Each night about this time there is a knuckle 
cracking sound that's centered on our rooftop as though someone pressed a 
foot into a brittle part.  Now there is a man shouting directions to the 
night.  For a moment, I turn down the air-conditioning.  His voice 
ceases; I begin to chill the room again.  My sentences that used to be in 
shards like being spoken whole.  The matter of them teaches in whole 
language.  A teacher accidentally of my acquaintance typically preempts 
the other half of conversation and lies down beside her own soliloquies.  
When it is dark, the rumor parses everything we know. Offers a string of 
intervention so the supplicants will easily quintuple in the daytime.  
Factor in the earnest-seeming ones who come at night to edges and request 
to have bequeathed to them unreasonable fractions.

Hardwood floor versus a soft place to lie down

SOMETHING TO SHOW

I heard her youthful skin go gray.  It was a brilliant afternoon that 
seemed to last a whole birthday.  I withdrew as typically I do, sensing 
the comparative worth of learning hurt.  Leaned back into my cocoon and 
thought ahead.  The walls felt handmade, so the question I would pose was 
_are they to be trusted_.  People allege that no one can predict timing.  
I'm not sure that I agree.  Basic psychological indicators show on the 
same page.  What a comprehensive offering.  I noticed she invested in a 
lid atop her productivity, not a pleasant hat.  But could not become 
infectious in my segment of the room.  How do you not become friends 
easily.  The duration of relationships has been the length and width.  
Whatever happened to the institutions we were taught to have admired.  We 
would have not a wink of room to talk or touch.  Unwanted on both sides, 
the treason behind fears.

Piercement, placemat, sponge, the premised reputation cast like 
worthwhile dice onto a decorative table of old wood

KEENING WITH AN A

Keening with an _a_ was what he did intuitively to the point that 
inhibition had a transfer in its hand that pickled inclination (some of 
me).  Least sum of squares perfuncts its way into a shadow's crash part.  
_Ask for authenticity_.  Be granted bag of rocks.  Humidity comes closest 
in the weather realm to lust.  Don't hold against me my affordable young 
midline.  I suppose you'd call this leafless wilderness my middle age.  
Possession is a fraction I can't quite remember.  Passion's do-able.  Who 
names this software (Quark).  Words such as _evidence_ tone down my 
feeling.  So neglect resides against some slivers coarsening the green 
enamel of a park bench.  I like to be outside but not without my shirt.  
We are quite spoiled in the Southwest where if you happen to adore the 
heat there's no such thing as punishment.

THE RALPH IN EACH OF US

Warmups welcome the plate glass of me known as intensity in our 
relationship.  I do combouts but not for free.  Settle for guest bed 
analysis free-thrown in dragnet moss.  I promise not to use the word 
weave.  If you'll equally deliver curves in firm grasp of the city (morph 
and kiss).  I'm using words that do not patronize.  Rubricity comes 
closest to salvation in the whittled hills.  Dance rubber bands back into 
habitats.  The Ralph in each of us is evidenced by touch ups the 
photographer forgot.  Ralphette.  Ralphine.  How predisposed need we be 
to mandatory gender floss to twiddle the expected pink or blue dichotomy 
before the faces of the lambs wearing merely curtains it is said that God 
assigned.  Yea verily the silver comes to blest things:  semitect, 
adroitness, loam, and threnody.

Cause control, perfunctorily arranging things taken for granted, flows 
with energy all through them

GRAVESTONES

Digits partly cooked will resurrect as if to set the whole (meta) 
establishment afire.  Pensivity aloofs loom central phosphate you might 
striate farmfully.  Acumen's a spate, a flurry with duress in tow.  
Things that destroy grow thin before the damages sequestered in new 
rooms.  Drum cakes divide one isthmus from another.  Skills meant to be 
tangible release themselves from situations.  Victuals seed wash along 
the line.  All falsehood long, the judge patched calls from continents.  
The lemon that she brought made juice to die for as the lingo goes.  
White boots, a breath mark sky, some riddles past the point of homing.  
Cement in its soft state is fleeting, useless as the place lines will be 
painted when a craftsman gets around to it.  The maze of easels fails to 
interfere with a rose's elasticity.

Blinders on our favorite horses, all bets off

REFLEX

We split plyboard one-handedly each one of us while talking a consecutive 
demeanment.  I grew tired of hearing him forget ensemble.  Having learned 
the weight of the fedora's equal to the total weight minus the weight of 
one man previously wearing the fedora (this same).  _Having approached 
the masterminding of half horsepower disposal while a ratings war is on_.  
He thought himself the soloist of expertise, ignored grammarians as kind 
old feed alerts with motherboards about to be replaced.  Playing the 
market by name against a lofty instinct's ever ripening.

Jump starting a vehicle not one's own, vicarious alignment, process 
service

FLESH

Beebonnet's earthly symmetry bereaves elastic.  How to capture market 
share is to infect the soul of the competitor.  No virus needed.  Tell 
some story that inspires fear, and watch spines wrinkle to lifeless blue 
balloons.  I don't like talk's evaporative affirming rosychill all 
through the otherwise penned weather.  She won't converse without her 
infancy imbued in conversation.  Won't memorize self worth.  But will 
chime in on the existing tales, the quarantined noon brawls so they're 
unlikely to perspire the first deserved cash royalty and swashed main 
lace of thick and thin dichotomy.  The earth lanes silver us ahead of 
dormitory style ketosis, all ones alert to styles and their antithesis 
the miles ahead to have been walking.

Normed answers, how they look inclined, eternally green eyes

AN INABUNDANT SPINE

Slouch occurred parentally.  The children saw no reason to first guess an 
inabundant spine.  Some field of lavender might put a soul to hours of 
sleep.  Distinguishing intention from desire. Throttled words of a 
rejection she is not aware of.  Firefly in a corner, putty in her eyes.  
Shelf muting the small dolls with a net to breeze them out of here so 
something new can be created.  _Voulez-vous_ (myopia) the closer to 
caress (my dear).  Dependent on the depth of prior injury.

TREASON-TOED


Out of context everything looks good.  Onions, inclemency, rotundas.  
Whipsaw mercy, yodeling.  A manufactured friendship operatta milestone.  
Rubricity enflowers pasty nuns (how would it seem to be alike).  Siphoned 
intrusion, forensified wide lute as warm as stippled mill tax.  Actuarial 
tables pressed to my chest, your chest, her chest.  Gender needs no 
eyesight.  Fortify fuss-budgetly the aftermath of no-show.  Trap me in my 
own words (of our making).  Literate new swells advancing cause in 
_miserere_ overtones.  The organist was clobbered by insistent sprinklers 
en route to the off-key church.  Her letter said she shoulders things.  
She basks.  She rub-a-dubs accord when geeks leave limericks along her 
doorstep with a whippoorwill to dandle like a hive homespun.

Semantitude, foxglove, decision point of our own making

WORLD FLOW

Paint justice on the timpanum to weed the scales of their beleaguered 
homily fort blue. Lace lovely, sly, and intuition-charmed like lanes 
come-to.  Where worlds from here sopranos light upon the gilt-safe paint 
so we'll enjoy the house.  What tiny fingers you have Martined onto for 
the neck of this guitar.  I wonder who has carried a harmonic pursed and 
laved.  Ivy demonstrates its breeding sanity in nectar words or less.  My 
body scant with shivering what makes a nest a nest.  Brianna was her 
name, a chemotherapeutic twinge.  Hypotheses on long walks typify _do 
lunch_ attentions.  Lips precipice our blond brick femur.  Claustrophobic 
in a seven-fold pronunciation of the dowry broken into elements reputed 
to comprise a world.

Creased into a car that really runs, a game of dominoes, a record of who

A HOLIDAY

Independence muffles sly wash on the wear to corner-lot my sequel of 
long-practiced differences.  _Remainder me_, she huffed into her 
doorframe.  Pillow oughtness dignifies modalities of past performance, 
quasi shuffle, logjammed moderati.  All new berry cusp, the wayward lea 
is bunched like socks.  And hemorrhage decides to fast a good long 
wrinkle in the way of tomboy features fine and tweed and comma-spawned.  
When listlessly in love with present tense one feeds one's inner 
oligarchic sponge the expectations littered near sea-based triath- where 
folks alleged to love come rattling into new awareness, lipperware.  And 
such good grooming fortifies from blueprints safe within public domain.

ETERNITY

Your hand with the 82 dollar ring I gave you in the seventies equalling 
relatively thousands stays as we god-givenly remain surrounded by night 
air rehearsing all the way to morning light the petit four of nest 
mentality.  If I redeem you I have clothed myself in cellophanic forms of 
light.  Those of us taught to be working have convinced ourselves an 
honest day of  life is worth an honest splinter of an occupation that 
lives on in its small celebrated pieces mid-air Brandenburg through 
speakers a priori same integrity runs through our parlor, common to the 
tube socks and tuxedo atmosphere.  My want is just the no fly zone of 
suffrage as it was defined in little items where no cable has been run.

Tumult as a partially descriptive word enlivening the hemisphere and 
caulk around the edges we encamera to our suddenly long-lasting lives

SNAIL MAIL


Posse of handmade love that you can read curves in extra dry blue ink no 
longer washable, a little on your jeans the way a spirit feels with touch 
to add to tryst cared for and manicured directly from the body years of 
spirit's evidence of challenge and caress, the struggle 'tween resistance 
and support the whole matter ethereal as tangibly the market shares and 
shares alike oceans of trail blazing feats commiserato on the salty shelf 
innumerable chefs once there.

Subscription to a magazine, a paper trail, the longing that occurs in

The System

Veritas shames politics into belief for show.  Portfolios drag icons from

dirt all the suffering enraged father to detoxify the body from the 
heart.  Beautiful father.  Beautiful trained pet me.

TWO URGES

His agenda looks embarkive and sustained misindications to their mother.  
Poverty backfills on-time sleep.  Periodontal germ warfare, something 
ominous to crack your hard drive more than alter ego, is a cache to make 
whole distance between pet care and jalopy.  Circumstance breeds surface 
gentry past the length of combs.  Surrounds the apparatus with blood 
sugar and alleged imbalances.  Where these two pulses came from, I mean 
urges, I formed people who were slivers of myself.  It's obvious their 
stares were waltzed alike.  I saw them glide in what I thought was 
unison, be broken, dabbled with, estranged.

Interrogation as a process, an addiction, definition of a self

__________________________________________________

VARIATIONS

Medical indulgence pierces lollygag, so anymore a fire is not a thing to 
mention.  Preach goes numb with foyer toothaches.  Glib purls, knitted 
brows for long walks tempesting our smooth calves' liver on the 
continent.  Served prawns and veto power.  Animals are treat germs we can 
high five in our summer sleep.  The kindred icing on the cake is to have 
midnight dotted swiss few cars and meadows near the favorite cot.  
Melange shows too much white against the surface in the sprawling frame.  
Was it myopia or simply gabardine left wanting.  Human skills keep 
showing they amount to everything.  Possession of a cup of coffee and 
some basic clues to the alarm out back.  Formica slices to remember eras 
by, when we were unprepared for figments of the everything we claim to be 
today.

Gentrification process, color photographs, weaving the distances between 
segregated nouns

SCORCH

Thebes crossed swords it's rumored, so go last if you can bear the silt, 
and I will warm your ever ready yarn approaching the yell festivals.  
That endear us to the throats' design near treetops in the soffit mood of 
see-through fortresses.  The better to be sanguine with your decibels, my 
drear.  We saw the catacombs.  We walked the arbor lanes.  We treated 
selves unheard of to emotive linguists in the habit of design flaws 
better for worse tantrums.  Mild dichotomies brand-named soft if you 
illumined flavor with a floss to ride across the kingdom (mine) intaglio.  
The broiler a lost cause.

Crimson lanes, a form of repetition, faced by the surprise of someone's 
maxing out the schedule

PLAINSONG



Cool litres of imbuances reciprocate curved lines.  No longer afternoon, 
the power alive and throttling some conflicting urgencies.  A mother and 
a son respond to the abundance as though there were no rigor, 
limitations, or forensics.  Where a tattoo would be, he's laced the 
insecurities to seem intentioned.  Myocardial's a word that neither uses.  
Out the window, scenery and rapidly moving fresh air trespass by.  A 
painting in somebody's head drifts toward the forefront after paintings.  
The one more loved has left the frame.  Sculped to power by virtue of 
beholding.  Rarely do they cross creeds.  Ballast crumbcakes its way out 
of relationship.  They settle in the wear of what they've known.  
Pondering injustice as they've known.  Semiautonomous as riddles are.  
Baked slyly in the name of whole grain futures.  Dependable, illusive, 
bronzed through repetition.

Portraiture, as moving as a text, revolving door, dissemblances

__________________________________________________

SHORELINE, TRAFFIC

Philosophy presumed to be the girl next door.  Trading indices presented 
as vanilla not all bland.  Some of the impression made in colors traded 
places with the movement of some traffic in the middle of the hedge. Pale 
blades rotated hives along supremacy.  A full-flown frost to meld with 
summer in a hasp of dimly colored valse starting with "v."  Trees 
touching across the road taken for granted.

Insomnia, these premises within a format heretofore unrecognized

__________________________________________________

THE CHEMISTRY OF WAR

That there is more than one of him occasionally comforts me.  One who 
gentlemans my path retains his high regard and bookmarks anger somewhere 
I don't think to read.  Another stays away, as though I am a human weapon 
with invective toiling in the summer grass.  One more of him is 
motherless, confines me to the recognition every moving part is glass.  
See-through identity that creases one whole sheet of the addendum.  
Chemistry between, perfect in symmetry.  Within another life we'd dance, 
but here the boundaries wash out immodest differences.  How do we know 
each other in familiar darkness.  If by vision and not touch, personified 
by blades held back, instructive as the wild blast furnace never keeping 
to itself.

Hands with worth in them, full blend of blades and sanctions

__________________________________________________

SIMILE

Palaver keys in formed affection.  He was different ages in the dream.  
Adopted margins, colored in discrepancies to mean political invective.  
Row of objects in the morning different from a row of the specifics 
painted in the afternoon some form of bronze.  Tell tale affection.  She 
allowed the body to have spoken a known language taught by weather or a 
film emerged to trace the boundaries between earth and skin.  Whatever 
touch was there, intoned affection.  Full barometers walled their 
findings in the semiautomatic blossoms that refused to wilt.  Gathered by 
breathing.  He would have thought her politics...but slowly, gesturing, 
he moved his preferences to slim the space between the window and the 
frame.

Tangibles cross protective lines, the skin as we have known it, parcels 
recollection

CUE CARDS

They spoke of violence as though it were a hobby or a choice.  Within 
another sphere, grenades escaped no one's attention.  Impoliteness ceased 
its understated quality.  The blatancy of horns regressed the human 
spirit.  It was hypthetical and comfortable within the living room 
neglect of truth.  Where pictures pasted globules on the rent wall suited 
to a mosque trade.  Speed demons no longer comprised humor of a phrase.  
Whoever balked became apprenticed.  Crescent lines moved towers.  There 
was land to bake, and there were threesomes vitual and pronged.  Dementia 
let go qualities we would have liked to zero out from prior victuals, but 
who was counting the presentia.

Trespass, mourning, empty jar

__________________________________________________

DIAL TONE

Risk seemed sexual, unthinking, taken prior to my speaking in a language 
unfamiliar to named skin.  What was the resilience trying to be worked, I 
asked myself.  There is no leaning into body warmth, no shame, no 
cardboard box, no certainty.  To paint a reasonable morning, I configured 
obligation and immersed myself in what appeared a lightened version of 
the trespass.  Wild rice, furnace, time of apparition.  Ice sculpture "I 
saw it with my own eyes, honest..." urgent as desire for miracles.  
Curved pelt near wheat, the surface glow's immaculate inherency.

Treason, neighbors who do not speak (volumes), certain dissimilar repair

WASHING ON THE PRETTY LINE

I'd like this hive configured for the Olivetti, please sir, perfect for 
my thumbs.  The crescent lipwear bottling up indifference the same 
centrigrade as all the worthy time zones in our sphere.  There are roster 
fees to build upon, and scales to leverage shade trees and their 
valences.  The shoelace portion of our program sees the dust accumulation 
near the fiber climb down furniture and speed traps.  Homilies won't work 
the numbers.  Silence thumbs its way clear to the park and back to what 
you think is home in your own words.  I'd like to merchant my way 
forward, not be littled here in slide trombone capacity with 
battery-dependency and tales to tell.  Besotted lives are dearthy in the 
nearby window.  See the plain wide booths with the reputed merchants 
drinking coffee.  Not one of them unless you live here has been named 
apology.  Create one, says the priest, and live a better form of thriving 
in the dreamful haze of washing on the pretty line, the atmosphere of one 
redemption at a time.

Lozenge after lozenge, some particulars, routine the way my offering 
congeals after a fashion

__________________________________________________

FAITH

Embroidery once kissed me.  Divinity's inherent, not a sluggish fling 
with ossobuco.  Merely chaliced inflow vectors, calling card 
paraphernalia.  Massage retains fair market value for the Agamemnon in us 
all.  Never telephone me with redundant fill dirt.  I've too many things 
to mind abidingly.  Snow cone for starters.  Yellow craft on blue sea 
water, a resultant green paler than shamrock.  Relentlessly, air purifier 
works its way into our kickstand hearts to try and cauterize years of 
causality.  Prerequisites for parenthood include self knowledge and 
eccentric brands of sanity contagious to the touch.

Ice water will be fine, relief in the first person

__________________________________________________

NOT THE SINGLE NOTES

Monks continue singing like a salve.  The men outside install a drainpipe 
to avert the downpour funneled just above my door in the infrequent hours 
that rain occurs.  Phone calls interrupt what might be happiness in 
someone else.  I'm in here hiding from the world smelling the incense of 
imaginary churches trying to preserve my faith.  Plainsong needs no 
compass and no flavor.  _Not the single notes but their continuance_.  My 
each day practices its mattering in front of the ongoing test tube.  
Maybe when I'm tired I will be happy to lie down.  This week intended to 
be just the miracle we have awaited turns out on Monday to be stinging.  
I'm not available to perform errands your province.  Nor am I awake to 
your considered jamboree replacing deep connective tissue.  There are 
sufficient thoughts to think.  _Only dysfunction teaches_.  My each day 
devoted to the fixing.  She projects what the repair person must know 
without attempting to absorb it.  A pretty quiet atmosphere impacts the 
slimness.  Copy me on shadow mercy for a time.  Errors practiced turn out 
to resist correction.  Fluid as they seem to be, there's plenty evidence 
of the intractible.

Commencement at this time of year and recollection of the melody
