INTRODUCTION

In Chinese the characters _chih_ and _yin_ in combination mean literally
"to know the tone" or "the one who knows the tone or music." By
extension, the term denotes "the one who understands or appreciates
another's art"; thus, "the one who understands the mind and heart of
another--a true friend."

* * *

It is recorded that during the _Spring and Autumn Period_ (722-484 B.C.)
a talented musician named Yu Po-ya lived along the Yangtze River in the
feudal state of Ch'u near today's Wuhan, the capital of Hupeh Province.
One afternoon a woodcutter named Chung Tzu-ch'i passed by Po-ya's house
and heard him playing the five-string zither. The music so moved
Tzu-ch'i that he became Po-ya's _chih-yin_ on the spot.

_Lieh tzu_, a Taoist classic attributed to Lieh Yu-ku of the Late Chou
Dynasty, relates that while Yu Po-ya was an excellent zither player,
Chung Tzu-ch'i was also a good listener. "When Po-ya would play, if his
thoughts were on the high mountains, Tzu-ch'i would exclaim, 'Yes! Good!
Towering and majestic like Mount T'ai!' If his thoughts were on flowing
waters, Tzu-ch'i would exclaim, 'Yes! Good! Vast like the Yangtze or the
Yellow River!' Whatever Yu Po-ya had in his mind and heart, Chung
Tzu-ch'i was sure to intuit it."

_The Spring and Autumn Annals of Mr. Lu_, a summary of late Chou Dynasty
philosophy commissioned in early 200 B.C., adds that when Chung Tzu-ch'i
died, Yu Po-ya smashed his zither and broke the strings. He never again
played because he believed that there was no one worth playing for.

In the first book of Chinese literary criticism, _The Literary Mind and
the	Carving of Dragons by Liu Hsieh_, a chapter titled _Chih-yin_
begins: "To know the tone is hard! The tone is truly hard to know. To
meet someone who understands it is [also] very hard. You meet a
_chih-yin_ once every thousand years and then for only a moment!"

* * *

This volume is a selection of ancient and modern poems from the Far East
and American West that set forth, or touch on, elements of the
_chih-yin_ theme.

FAREWELL

Her husband hasn't yet
won good position;

whatever she does is done
with eyebrows lowered.

Over and over she plays
the unornamented zither,

longing for a soul
who knows her heart.

          --Chia Tao (779-843)

DREAMING OF LI PO

Separation by death must finally be choked down,
but separation in life is a long anguish,

Chiang-nan is a pestilential land;
no word from you there in exile.

You have been in my dreams, old friend,
as if knowing how much I miss you.

Caught in a net,
how is it you still have wings?

I fear you are no longer mortal;
the distance to here is enormous.

When your spirit came, the maples were green;
when it went, the passes were black.

The setting moon spills light on the rafters;
for a moment I think it's your face.

The waters are deep, the waves wide;
don't let the river gods take you.


(2)

Clouds drifting the whole day;
a traveler traveling who never arrives.

Three nights you have been in my dreams;
as your friend, I knew your mind.

You say your return is always harrowing;
your coming, a hard coming;

Rivers, lakes, so many waves;
in your boat you fear overturning.

Going out the door, you scratch your white head
as if the purpose of your whole life was ruined,

The rich and high positioned fill the Capital,
while you, alone, are careworn and dejected.

Who says the net of heaven is cast wide?
Growing older, you only grow more preyed upon.

One thousand autumns, ten thousand years of fame,
are nothing after, death.

          --Tu Fu (712-770)

CANYON CREEK ON BUDDHA'S BIRTHDAY

The creek spits
   beads of water and foam 
plunging through the stone-
clogged bend
   pours down rocky terraces 
       passes and becomes 
               this pool

          above a double
               showering
                  shadowy falls

sitting here up from Sequim Prairie
       and the sea's dark pastures below
    I drink again your
sweet icy gift
   of sun-ravished
          snow

everywhere your water
     is leaping
around me
  like grasshoppers

 sun blazing gleaming
on your slick black rock

while
     a bough of young cedar
   swings and flutters
      in the canyon where you stream

and both of us
      close for an instant

          river and friend.

__________________________________________________

FOR THE POET OF PABLO CREEK


Long legs loping through alder woods, 
beard a black bush, pack on your 
back, twinkle in your eye

like the twinkle of a creek in the sun.

In your cabin by lamplight, 
you trace a trail or mountain 
range on the maps you cherish

more than any original painting,

You're an old wall-gazer, 
mountain-rider, know-the-names-
of-all-the-flowers kid.

The only time I even faintly 
tasted the wrath you reserve 
for the Forest-Service-Timber 
Company Consortium, Trident 
and Northern Tier 
was brushing trail up the Queets 
for two dollars a day, 
when the chainsaw gas was leaking

on your new, expensive sleeping bag;

and maybe the time Balaam, our donkey,
ate the last of our cedar shelter 
during a rainstorm on the Calawah River, 
back when we were still calling

winter wren the jazz bird.

You know the alchemy of song
and the heart required.

Here...I've set you out 
a cup of fresh rice tea 
and the only map of the 36 
waterfalls of Canyon Creek.

WEI CITY SONG

Wei City morning rain
dampens the light dust.

By this inn, green,
newly green willows.

I urge you to drink
another cup of wine;

west of Yang Pass
are no old friends.

          --Wang Wei (701-761)

__________________________________________________

ON THE ROAD TO DENVER IN A COAT AND TIE, 
	I THINK OF MY OLD FRIEND MASTER RED PINE 
	AND THE EXAMPLE HE INSPIRES

You had to stop giving blood 
for a living, it was killing you 
in a different way than ordinary work.

"Hey, all I want to do," you always said, 
"is just stay up here on Yangming Mountain 
and translate Buddhist poems,

"And take hot sulphur baths, 
drink spring green tea and 
have the three German girls come up on weekends 
bearing gifts of Glenfiddich and sandalwood fans."

Admirable as this agenda was, 
you finally had to get a job--

    (Even your sideline manuscript, 
    purloined from Mimi, 
    called: _White Girls in Asia_, 
    languished in your lacquer desk.)

duty-running for a gang of merchants 
operating out of Hongkong and Taipei.

You flew so frequently, 
Cathay Airlines bestowed on you 
its Marco Polo Gold

(What's that goddamn thing, Red?)

with all its perks and privileges: 
access to the Marco Polo Lounge, 
free drinks and implied flirtation rights 
with native-costumed flight attendants.

(Hey, Red, can we see that card?)

On trips, of course, you wore 
a coat and tie, which as you said 
was disingenuous, but modern Chinese disguise, 
and even hooked your younger brother 
into flying (sort of shotgun) at your side.

Green rice-paddies near Taoyuan;
Laundry-draped balconies of high-rise Kowloon;
Neat _hinoki_ woodlots near Narita;
The river fog from the Han at Kimpo--

All glimpsed from a tiny window 
going into, or falling out of, 
the clouds.

(Hello, Mr. Pine, so good to see you again, 
your room is 405; my, that's a beautiful 
arm of watches, Mr. Pine.)

The duty-runner:

Your bags stuffed with nylons, dresses, 
the latest hand-held instruments, toys, 
electronic devices, gizmos, gimcracks, 
chocolates, cosmetics, vitamins, 
shoes, oil-paper parasols and saki.

And yes, the Rolex watches 
wearing hairless and smooth the skin 
on your left arm.

A technically not illegal end-run 
(except, perhaps, for the watches) 
around government Customs 
to bring cheaper goods 
to all the yearning markets of Asia's 
teeming tariff-burdened folk;

Our border-opening hero: 
("Here little Wang, a toy from Hongkong.") 
Our jet-age Robin Hood: 
("This tape will self-destruct...") 
And a whole bag of tricks 
& monkeyshines, off-the-cuffs, up-the-sleeves, 
under-the-tables, now-you-see-its, now-you-don'ts, 
hair-raising, white-knuckle adventures and escapes 
in the Kafkaesque ports of entry, 
in the tidal confluence of commerce and thieves.

Just to get back 
to a cup of fragrant tea 
and the four-line songs 
of Cold Mountain--Han Shan--

who wiped his hands of the "red dust" 
more than a thousand years ago 
for a thatched hut, 
some peace of mind, 
and the immortal mists 
of the Heavenly Terrace Mountains,
	
and wrote: 

              "You're all a band of angels 
              in a leaking boat at sea."

SUMMER DAY AT SOUTH PAVILION, RECALLING HSIN TA

Suddenly the sun goes off 
the mountains; 
slowly the moon rises 
over the pond.

To enjoy the cool of evening, 
I loosen my hair, 
open wide the veranda windows 
and relax in the airy calm.

A breeze carries 
the fragrance of lotuses; 
one can hear dew 
dripping in bamboo.

I start to play 
the five-string zither, 
but sadly, there ts no 
_chih-yin_ to listen.

In this mood, 
I think of my old friend, Hsin; 
but the night only brings 
troubled dreams.

          --Meng Hao-jan (689-740)

__________________________________________________

OLD MOUNTAIN WIND BLOWS THE RAIN DOWN THE GORGE

Cat on lap, he's typing letters to friends 
on the other shore of this ocean, 
on the east side of this Rim of Fire; 
writing while the wind flings 
sheets of rain, veils of fog WHOOSH 
down Hutien gorge.

Moments ago he stood at the stove 
looking out at the flooding farm terraces, 
rain rucking the surface of paddies, 
wind chasing rain, and again he 
thought of her, how she'd like looking out too, 
while the wok she worked so well 
leaped with flame and vegetables.

He'd be at the table sure, 
drinking tea and talking to her 
easier than whiskey ever talks.

And she'd be cooking, wondering 
when he'd commence to read 
from Dickens, Tolstoy, or some 
good mystery aloud to her.

Of course, there's other women, 
all Asia out his door, and 
he could be in a Turkish jail, 
or dead by mortar shell in Lebanon.

But they were married.

__________________________________________________

CICADA

The first cicada 
awakens in the cypress,
the mountain still dark.

Uncrinkling his wings 
and instruments of music, 
a few raspy notes.

Raised on root juices, 
he has true eyes and false ones, 
more raspy notes come.

Now ticks and buzzes, 
then the first timbal note; 
it's a courtship song.

It's Pablo Casals; 
it's my alarm; it's five o'clock; 
the membranes tremble.

A duet outside, 
now a whole cello section, 
a congregation.

Song all down the hills, 
sun breaking over the peaks; 
open the door to pee.

"Good morning, Pablo." 
Their hearts are already off, 
their abdomens beat.

In the treed medians 
of Chungshan North Road, Taipei, 
a choir of bells.

Cicada masses 
in the shrill-leafed canopies 
above toxic streets.

They are the music; 
they are the late-spring-summer-
island takeover.

In Chinese called _ch'an_, 
said to be noble hearted. 
Why trapped in a cage?

At Yangmingshan Park 
a grown man, Ziploc baggie, 
cicadas inside.

Not really singing, 
only a disturbance squawk, 
such a dumb outing.

On the mountain bus 
a boy holds one upside down, 
he gets a squawk too.

A long time ago 
Chinese caught those which sang 
in the key of C.

History, it's dusk; 
Pablo has played hard all day, 
he needs some shuteyes.

His abdomen's sore; 
he folds up his music stand 
and mica wings.

"Night to you, Pablo." 
Noble hearted, also proud, 
he does not answer.

          Mink's Hat Mountain,
          Yangmingshan

SAILING TO KEYSTONE: SALUTE ABAFT

The ferryboat churns toward Keystone, 
a rumbling enterprise of gulls and salt sea-spray; 
and there's old brick and wood Port Townsend, Victorian, 
Good Willed, receding on the bluffs.

Peering out over the fantail, 
Hui and I try, but cannot see 
Finn Wilcox striding through the town, 
hirsute and handsome as Che Guevara, 
dressed like Bo Jangles for a night on the "jungle."

This is the poet who thinks 
a grant's a president's name 
of the street that runs by his house, 
and needs not apply 
to live on it.

A man, 
who in cold shadowy boxcars 
has passed among the American hobo 
in camaraderie and seen enacted 
the unheralded resurrection 
of a Willie, a Crumbie Willie, or a Zoo 
from inside their burrows of old cardboard 
from the depths of their cheap-wine dreams:

an ascension, a hoisting on air again 
of the scarecrow's nailed sticks, 
lurching forward on old train-legs, 
arriving at the kingdom 
of the morning-sunlit door--
O sky! O flashing cinematic trees!--
and tossing out of it 
the one rag bundle, 
and after it, the one rag self 
(to re-animate old clothes and ride again) 
as creaking predetermined trains bang 
and slow entering policed switchyards 
of Idaho or California;

who, 
raised in Klamath Falls, 
ran away as a teen from home 
and stayed mostly ran away, 
wandered and got picked up 
years later on the road to Mossy Rock 
by our long-hair, crew-hungry foreman, 
Jess Miller--"Where ya headed, guy? 
Need some money?"--and plunked down

on the noble-fir slopes 
of the dammed Lewis River, later to go on 
to plant--in ash, mineral soil and duff--
nearly a million trees 
in the "spiritual weather" of Western Washington;

who, 
despite the corkboots and taste 
for hard work, is one of the softest touches 
you'll ever be lucky to know, 
an historical Huck Finn, 
known among the sacrificed 
as the guardian angel 
of the dumpster, 
the crew truck and the sod; 

who loves his wife;

who (we're still peering out over the ship's wake) 
is surely just now 
headed out to his 
new writing shack at water's edge

below the ruins 
of our earliest zendo; 
the shack, where, 
when he showed it to us 
on a slope among sword ferns, 
sunlight was crashing in 
from sea and sky 
through its big frame windows; 
and the undulating bay, 
translucent as a jellyfish, 
smooth as agate, was whispering, 
I sensed, a whole bunch of poems his way,

right where he's decided 
to sit himself down, 
and catch one, maybe two.

WORDS--FOR XN

There is no sun in this city
Black night fattens the maggots and worms
One body in rigor mortis 
             struggles to right itself
As if intending to prop up the sky here
The lucky people are mice 
             the unlucky, stones
Between the lucky and the unlucky
Between the stones and the mice
Only you can understand 
             what it means.

UPON FINISHING A POEM

It took three years 
to get two lines right;

I test them aloud, 
and tears blur my eyes.

If for you, friend, 
the poem fails to ring true,

I'll go back and take solace 
in the ancient, autumn hills.

          --Chia Tao (779-843)

_PAWTRACKS_ ON SEVEN-STAR MOUNTAIN
            --For Tim McNulty (Ma Ming-shih)

Bamboo walk/snake stick 
red daypack 
poems of Ma Ming-shih, 
to read aloud 
in clouds 
atop the mountain.

But the trail 
runs out in _mang ts'ao_ grass, 
the mist turns rain, 
and I take shelter 
under ancient pine,

Here I open pack 
and all your songs 
(of loves, of rivers 
and the snowy peaks) 
darken at the top, 
curl from the rain.

But a little deeper down, past the water jug 
and socks--the cheese and crackers, 
ah, still dry.

          Confucius' Birthday
          28:1X:83

ON FAILING TO MEET THE RECLUSE OF WEST PEAK

On the mountain top: 
one thatched hut,

thirty _li_ 
from nowhere.

Knock on the door: 
no servant to answer.

Look in: 
only a table for tea.

The firewood cart 
is covered;

have you gone fishing 
in the autumn stream?

I looked among the pools, 
but missed you;

wanting to pay my respects,
they must go unexpressed.

Grass shines 
in the fresh rain;

pines murmur 
at evening windows.

Here, at this moment, 
a harmony deep and unrivaled;

the self completely cleansed, 
the heart, the ear.

Although there is no 
guest and host precisely,

I'm able to intuit 
your pure thought.

Purpose fulfilled, 
I head back down the mountain;

what need now 
to wait for you?

          --Ch'iu Wei (694-ca. 789)

__________________________________________________

_SAKURA_

Lingering at the bathhouse door, 
I watch the woman bundle off children 
into light-rain, small-lane Kyoto.

Skirt in hand, she glances 
my way across the evening lane,
then up the walk after the party 
of colored rain boots and umbrellas.

Wet-headed but warm, I'm waiting 
for Hui to come out from the public bath, 
but can't help thinking of America, 
the disquiet strangers there inspire.

Cherry trees are just beginning to break 
blossom, here, off Kitaoji-dori, north of town.

Now the woman is crossing the lane, 
coming directly toward me. She wants 
to give me her open umbrella, 
insists that I take it

without knowing where I'm going 
or who I am.

I thank her and bow, 
and point to my broadbrimmed hat.

Am I sure, she implores, am I sure?

There's hardly a raindrop 
in the rain-sweetened air.

She smiles and bows, 
returns to the sliding doors of her house.

Kyoto, the old capital, 
bursts into blossom in my heart.

          April 6, 1995

NOTES TO THE POEMS

1. "Farewell" * Chia Tao was a famous Buddhist poet of the Middle T'ang
Dynasty.

2. "Dreaming of Li Po" * Chiang-nan is the area south of the Yangtze
River, especially southern Kiangsu. * The "net" in which Li Po was
caught is jail. He was arrested and later exiled to Yehlang, a waste
region of Chiang-nan near Kweichou, for alleged association with a
person seeking to set up an independent administration at Nanking. * In
ancient times, human sacrifices were made to the river gods, the flood
dragon, or the dragon-king * "Heaven's net" is a reference to Chapter 73
of the TAO TE CHING: "The net of heaven is cast wide / but despite its
wide meshes, nothing is lost." * Li Po (701-762) and Tu Fu are held by
Chinese to have been two of the three greatest poets of China. Wang Wei
is the other.

3. "Canyon Creek on Buddha's Birthday" * "Canyon Creek" is a tributary
of the Dungeness-Graywolf River on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington
State. The watercourse drains north through Sequim Prairie and empties
into the Strait of Juan de Fuca at Jamestown, a Klallam Indian
settlement. * "Buddha's Birthday" is marked on April 8 by the Buddha
Bathing Festival. During the festival, images of the Buddha are paraded,
decorated, and sprinkled with holy water.

4. "For the Poet of Pablo Creek" * "Trident" refers to the offensive
weapons system of the Navy's Trident Submarine Base at Bangor,
Washington, and its fleet of nuclear-armed submarines. * "Northern Tier"
was a firm seeking to build an oil port in Port Angeles, Washington, and
an oil pipeline under Puget Sound to Minnesota. It took seven years of
activism by local people to defeat this fantastic plan. * The Queets and
Calawha Rivers flow through the rain forest of Olympic National Park.

5. "Wei City Song" * "Wei City" is located on the Wei River roughly 500
kilometers east of Xi'an (Ch'ang-an) and some 1,000 kilometers from Yang
Pass. * Another title for this poem is "Seeing Off Yuan Erh to Anhsi."
Anhsi was near Turfan, which was threatened by invaders from the north.
* "Yang Pass," or _Yangkuan_, was the last pass separating friendly
territory from the less secure region around Anhsi. It is not a mountain
pass, but a "gate" in the desert at the end of the Great Wall.

6. "On My Way to Denver in a Coat and Tie, I Think of Master Red Pine
and the Example He Inspired" * This poem was occasioned by a drive to
Denver to take temporary work as a journalist. * "Red Pine" is the pen
name of Bill Porter. * The poem is fanciful hagiography, and Red Pine
himself told me that he had no recollection of the "sandalwood fans." *
"Mimi," an American dancer in Taiwan and a neighbor of Red Pine at
Bamboo Lake, is the originator of "White Girls in Asia." * Han Shan was
a hermit and poet of the T'ang Dynasty who lived in the Heavenly Terrace
(T'ien T'ai) Mountains of today's Fukien Province. [See THE COLLECTED
SONGS OF COLD MOUNTAIN, Red Pine translator, Copper Canyon Press, 1983]
* "Red dust" is a Buddhist term for the world of the senses.

7. "Summer Day at South Pavilion, Thinking of Hsin Ta" * Meng Hao-jan
was a major poet of the High T'ang during the famous reign of Emperor
Hsuan-tsung (712-756). * "Hsin Ta's" name (Hsin the Elder) appears four
times in Meng's poems, but he is unidentified historically.

8. "Sailing to Keystone: Salute Abaft" * Finn Wilcox's best-known work
is HERE AMONG THE SACRIFICED, with photos by Steve Johnson, Empty Bowl
Books, Port Townsend, 1984.

9. "Words--for XN" * This is one of many documentary or "action" poems
written by activists and supporters of China's Pro-Democracy Movement
during the 1989 mass demonstrations in Tienanmen Square. A number of the
poems were faxed to Hongkong and then to Taipei where they were
translated by poets of the international community.

10. "PAWTRACKS on Seven-Star Mountain" * PAWTRACKS was Tim McNulty's
first book of poetry (Copper Canyon Press, Port Townsend, 1978) *
"Seven-Star Mountain," or Chihsingshan, is named after the seven
principal stars of the Big Dipper. * "_Mang ts'ao": Miscanthus sinensis_
is a tall common grass in Taiwan with long serrated leaves and plumes
also known as razor grass and mare's tail.

11. "On Failing to Meet the Recluse of West Peak" * Ch'iu Wei, a T'ang
Dynasty poet and good friend of the poet Wang Wei, is still paid homage
for his filial devotion to his stepmother. He had a long official career
and died at age 96. Sadly, only fifteen of his poems survive. * A "_li_"
is about one-third of a mile.
	
12. "_Sakura_" * "_Sakura (no hana)_" is Japanese for "cherry
(blossoms)."
