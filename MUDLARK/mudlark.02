WILD RIBBONS

This region gives the national wire cheap filler. Even 
our insects are of interest on slow days. A topless 
car wash. A topless doughnut shop. Segregated 
high school proms. We like different music, contented 
students say. The serial diaper thief still at large.  
A fetish, my son is sure, but I am not so certain.  
There is a problem with the roof. Whether this is 
related to climate, I have no idea but most things here 
are. Destruction by water, salt. Eating silver, 
art, delicate fabric seems a priority. My son 
is happy today. A girl with legs and serious potential 
has given him her number. He has gone almost a week 
without spilling butterscotch in large quantities 
at the fast food stand. On the beach he reads lines 
to me from the magazine that came in the mail. Happily 
explaining everything. This is all surrealism. This 
is good.  This is bad. The introduction to a collection 
of seafood recipes moves my sister to tears. I lose 
their drift. The twice-convicted diaper thief released 
this time for lack of evidence still on my mind. 
And another story. One from home. White tulips 
wrapped in pink tissue placed at the warm spring scene. 
Children gone wild in perfectly pleasant weather. A
young woman, near a pond, near fallen sycamores, nearly 
all her blood gone. She had been running in the park 
at that hour. That hour is not specified. There is 
no need. That hour is a bad hour. To be in the park.  
To be at home. To be. There is no good hour. But 
this is a pleasant afternoon and that kind of thinking 
doesn't really sound very American. I foresee instead 
a march down streets with the usual noise, signs.  
Take Back the Night. As though time is the matter. 
And place. Dark time. Dark streets. Whose interests 
do such beliefs serve. But perhaps it is better 
we march, better we continue to fail this quiz. Where 
does it usually happen. a) home b) street. When 
does it usually happen. a) day b) night. Delusion 
is necessary for mental health, claims the article 
my mother sends. I have lived this way all my life, 
my still married mother writes in the margin with 
exclamation points. The wife of our new vice-president 
has chosen her project. Preparedness for disaster.  
There are many tracks open women today in America.  
In Israel a witness testifies: It was then we found 
women and children burn that easily. Somewhere 
I think I read this still breathing and therefore 
in all good taste still nameless young woman 
was on a fast track. I hope so. I truly do hope so.  
Very fast.  Very bright. I can see her. Flying 
home. Wild bare arms breaking bright ribbons free.


COMMON EXPRESSION

The man above me is saying something. He is 
saying something over and over the same 
thing. What. What are you saying, I am 
saying but he is still saying what 
he was saying using the sound of it to take him 
where he wants to go and someplace inside me 
closes and I feel nothing but know only this 
cheap chosen comfort has taken a sudden twist 
straight toward the worst. And all this is now 
is waiting for it please to stop. Escape turned 
reenactment out of nothing but one 
word of language. But I don't know 
that yet. I don't know that 
until morning when I remember when
I heard that word before come 
over and over out of a man's mouth 
like that just like that.
In the afternoon sounds I can not place 
keep coming out of me.
I remember not knowing 
what would happen
when he stopped. Life 
or death was all I thought was
at stake. Who could have imagined
this.


RAY'S SENTENCE

I do this all the time, he said.
I ruin everything.  I ruin everything.


FIRST RECITAL

I go to my room. I take off
the dress. I hang up the dress at the end 
of the closet. I don't know what I do 
with the bra. I think I take it off. I'm 
pretty sure I took it off. I don't know 
when I collect the other things from the living 
room floor. I know the shoes stayed 
where they were for a while because I remember 
one day they surprised me. I saw them 
and I thought what are my shoes doing out 
here and then I remembered and I put them 
away. As though preparing for weather, 
although this is Florida where they haven't 
had any in years but natives say it's time 
again for a tropical storm to ransack this coast 
with voices betraying memories oblivious to lack 
of running water and light, I put on white cotton 
underpants, hand-me-down jeans of my son's, one 
of his oxford cloth shirts diluted navy and white 
vertical stripes, his navy cotton crew neck 
sweater that swallows me, my own white cotton 
socks and canvas sneakers. When my son says 
he always knows where to look for his clothes,
I tell him I don't know how they get in here.  
Laundry just goes astray on you sometimes. But 
he is young and doesn't understand that yet. I 
go with the dog into my son's room where he is 
not sleeping because he is sleeping in his cousin's 
room in my sister's house. I get on the floor 
with the phone book. Somehow it opens to a page 
that lists Rape Crisis Hotline in bold type.  
I dial. The woman who answers tells me she isn't 
Rape Crisis anymore. She's another hotline.  
She gives me another number. I dial. A recording 
tells me Rape Crisis Hotline has a new number. I 
dial. The new number has been disconnected. 
I call the police. I say I don't want to report 
anything or anything like that but I was just 
wondering if you might happen to have a number 
for something like a rape hotline. The man gets 
off the phone. There is talk in the background.  
He gets back on the line. He gives me a number.  
It is the number in the phone book. I look 
at the clock. Everywhere in America it is still 
the middle of the night. I dial Wisconsin 
where my best friend since sixth grade in suburban 
Connecticut and Miss Donna's ballet class lives now 
a time zone away. Julie says, Hello. I say, Rape.  
Julie says, What. I say, Rape. Julie says, What.
I spell it. Oh, Julie says, rape. No one says
anything. For the real life sound of her, I 
ask about the weather. We talk then of winter 
in Beloit and how she is wearing her hair now.  
Still a blunt cut but a little shorter in the back.  
Julie won't let me go until I promise to leave 
the house, go to my sister's. While promising 
I know I am able to go nowhere and it is nowhere 
near dawn.


MULTIPLE CHOICE

          a) vacationing from Virginia.
          b) from Louisiana.
          c) newly transferred by the Navy from California.

The policewoman says

Ray is

          d) none of the above.


The policewoman says
most likely
Ray is

          not Ray. 


INCOMPLETE EXAMINATION

Until I say, no, no more, the physician specifically 
trained for such occasions, examines me naked late 
the next afternoon, inch by careful inch, slowly 
touching me slowly everywhere slowly. You are 
ovulating, he says. He has pills for that, among 
other things. He remarks upon raw skin, bruises. Keeps 
finding bruise after bruise. I can not connect bruises 
with what happened and I can not talk anymore. Old, 
I say, fall down. I can not talk anymore. I have 
already talked with the center director, the 
policewoman, the center director, the psychologist, 
the center director. I can not talk anymore.  
Could I describe the rape for him, he says. Minor, I say.  
Ordinary.


DIFFICULT WORD

Sodomy, Kate says, sodomy. That's such a difficult word.  
But it is such an easier word to say than to say 
what he said, what he said could happen, what did happen.  
And Kate, this is so difficult to say it takes me 
years to begin to try to say this part of the story.  
How after inhuman time, the erection begins to leave him. How 
I pretend not to notice. Until now, I have been trying only 
not to move. If I want to avoid anal sex,
I have been instructed not to move.  This is when he is 
slamming himself into me. I am even more afraid now. I am 
so afraid now, Kate. I am so afraid. I believe if he believes 
I don't know maybe he will not kill me. Now he is using his hands 
to shove himself into me. This part seems to last 
a long time. And now he is off me. He is 
stretched out, propped on one elbow. He looks perfectly 
comfortable, Kate. He looks like everything is normal here, Kate.  
Kate, he is going to kill me, Kate. He gestures down, 
You're going to have to, he says. You're going 
to have to. He sounds so sad saying this. Like 
if it were up to him, he wouldn't be saying this. He's crazy, 
Kate. He's really really crazy. And this will not 
work. He has not been a boy for a long time and he has had me 
down on the floor for a long time. This will not work.
And when this does not work, he will kill me. I know this. 
I run. I run very very fast, Kate. But really Kate, I am not 
running. And really I am not even crawling. Really I am trying 
to slither myself along the way you sometimes in TV movies 
see soldiers under fire move. And really Kate, 
it is only inches that I do move. Like used dishwater, 
there is nothing left of me now. I am going to die, Katie.  
And he leans only slightly, uses only one arm to draw me to him.  
You're going to have to, he says, and his palm pushes my head 
down.


SOME LUCKY GIRLS

We were so lucky to get them. Nobody else
appreciates them.  Least of all the professionals who 
see this as symptom, wait for anger. But almost 
everybody in group agrees. And if some weeks later some 
of us stumble around saying I wish he'd killed me 
well, that's just a phase most of us live through 
and nobody's paying any attention anyway except 
the professionals who offer really good pastel 
drugs for both day and night. Of course Louise 
I guess basically she always just wanted 
to see hers neon flat dead but bleed bad first but 
I don't think she ever was really objective of course 
there was the matter of that vaginal tear and 
he did make her take that supervised bath afterward 
but he was so supportive, so sympathetic when 
she was getting all upset in the beginning as he 
watched her strip standing in her bedroom doorway 
he tried to help her through. Rape is never easy, he 
said. Caroline and I were crazy about our guys 
from the moment they left. My rapist was so nice, 
Caroline says. He wanted so very much to please 
me. What do you like, he said. I mean, he held a 
knife to my throat but he was so gentle. And, my
rapist, he was wonderful. Well, look at me. No 
visible scars. He let me live. He let me keep on 
my dress.


SPOTTING RAY

The day I spot Ray lounging in the doorway of Harry's 
boarded-up pawn shop, my therapist leaves town for 
a death in the family. I drive by Harry's every day 
on the way to work through that sorry stretch of 
downtown. Around Harry's lately I nurse swallowing 
a washed-out and bitter orange pill, whose bottle says 
as needed for anxiety. It's a taste I've acquired.  
Harry's been up for sale for a while now, but I've 
never seen Ray by there before. Ray was looking 
pretty good in battle fatigues. The beard all still 
there he said he planned to shave. Why, I said, it's 
a good beard. Keep it. Wondering could I ever 
positively identify him without it. I look back, long 
as I dare, knowing I need to keep my eyes' custody on 
the road.  But I want to roll my window down and wave, 
Hey. I want eye contact when I say, Who have you 
buried, Ray. Instead, I remember skipping the cemetery 
to go directly from Mass to my grandmother's house, 
charged by my sister with care of her cobalt enameled 
casserole, along with warming her sweet marinated 
chicken hors d'oeuvres, famous at family funeral 
parties. Trouble lighting the gas oven loses me 
some eyebrow, singes edges of my hair. I lose my 
sister's directions in the mirror above the bathroom
sink, convincing myself everyone will be too distraught 
and who in the family has enough sight left anyway 
to notice. If caught, I'll say I got carried away 
with plucking. But even skirting the get-together's edge 
I can't miss what my sister has to say about her 
scorched enamel. Daddy's first cousin, Helen, whose hair 
remembers waving passion bright, doesn't let me slip 
past. How are you, Honey, she says. Fine, thank you, 
Helen, I say, And you. Helen takes me by the shoulders, 
looks me in the eye. No, Honey, she says. Your grandfather 
you loved, who loved you, is dead. Honey, you are not 
fine. In the doorway of the room where he left his body 
in his own bed, in his own sleep, we lean into one 
another, looking out into the kitchen. When it was 
linoleumed red, he stood singing there.  For me.


BASKETS.

Even I like this. Yes. With 
my hands. My hands my sisters eye 
what is held expecting 
damage. 
This form so unlike 
speech in this no longer comfortable 
language 
feels natural as braiding 
young family hair.
Form belonging only 
to ourselves. Requiring no explanation.  
Because it happened here I begin with 
what is here. Palm. And because 
of what happened to my own palm.
Palm and branches of available roses.  
Painted paper. Paper painted 
by my sister with the small floral pattern 
of the discarded dress. Purple, white, green, 
blue. The last dress she helped me find.  
The one even I felt feminine inside. I 
hardly ever wear one any more. Barbara 
notices. Misunderstands
the repetition of a few safe clothes. Always
loose. Never ironed. Announces 
she is going to do what I do. Wear 
just anything she wants. I am reminded:
Want has had little 
to do with my recent life. Nothing 
to do with my wardrobe. I wear 
what I can. Clothes as symptom not 
statement. I do not complete 
the oval. Leave the slope of shape 
open. Or, unfinished.
But this is not just 
another broken object in the house.  
Remembrance does not basket up neatly.  
I assumed weaving might guide me somewhere 
beyond language.
I believed I believed if I made this basket if
I held the rape in my hands.
I suppose I hoped to feel 
something. Actual 
tears. Not expecting 
just the usual
bloodshed. Cut up hands. 
Unwise choice of material.  
I study my palms
the broken life line the line that split 
marked proof death of the raped woman is
no fantasy. The body knows more than the world.  
This fading line remains.
Reminds me:
There is an unburied woman in this house.  
A body is denying a woman a marked grave.  
The life line sometimes splits, it says 
in Elementary Palmistry, when there is 
a move to another country.
I love you, Donald says. I love you, 
Barbara says. I say 
nothing. Want only 
to get away.
I don't know the woman 
they talk about and they never met 
the woman I can almost on a good day remember 
being.
I am reminded:
A woman deserves a grave. The body needs 
to cry. The palm conceals nothing. 
The rapist who does not kill is the real 
murderer.


PAROCHIAL AIR

Prescription drugs do well here. Normal 
balance seems easily disturbed.
Karen's neck is bothering her again and 
I am suffering in this city which, 
for all its humidity, has never had 
a major Star Trek convention with 
inflammation the physician's assistant 
found by hand. The things we pay to have 
done to us while perfectly good dresses 
hang on sale racks. I don't need 
inflammation explained. What is there 
to do with evidence but burn it. We all 
know the temperature of sin. And so 
these blue pills are for vaginitis and 
oval with patience these help me sleep 
when I let them. Also they keep the 
dreams from me leaving me with only 
this steaming local air to contend with 
in the dark. Things form in this climate, 
my therapist explains, unknown further 
north. Calm talk of fungus follows. He 
means to suggest I suppose this condition
I am carrying on so about in extreme 
language may have nothing to do with the 
man who first dropped to his knees.  
Sniffed at me like an animal or a man 
gone mad. I just want to smell it, he said, 
but he lied.


ENTERTAINING RAY

Inventing Ray, I fail over and over.  
Nothing sounds right. Or true. Except 
hunger. Terrible hunger. Even in 
the womb I see him, mute mouth moving, 
wanting. In the middle of his time 
inside me, he held himself perfectly 
still and did not look down, but rather 
stared straight ahead at blank dimly 
lit wall. His face remaining, the way 
I see his face always, a face without 
expression. Providing no clue to what 
he dreams at such times. Do you bowl, 
he said. I said, No. I said, No. 
I see him now alone at night in the alley.  
The forced fall of pins. Line after 
line invariably neat and polite as nuns 
wearing convent posture. The involuntary 
sound they make going down. Ray is 
wearing what he always wears. Ray's 
clothes do what no one else wants to do.  
Hold him. Hold him close and keep 
on holding. His narrow body loosens 
only in moving away. I leave him there
leaving. As he turns, something haunts 
in the way his shoulders shift, sloping 
toward an exit. This mask Ray wears 
he was not born with. Some things 
the womb refuses home.


VOCABULARY WORDS

The woman is ovulating. On the floor, she knows this. She 
has never seen beneath the microscope the shapes of ferns 
cervical secretions assume only at this time. But 
she imagines them. Male ferns, you know, are common 
as mud. She imagines only uncommon ferns.
Maiden's hair. Venus hair. Heart's tongue.
Cinammon. Slender cliff. Madeline. Madeline.  
Jennifer Anne. Ovulating, the woman dreams 
a story. In that first garden, where they slept 
they slept among ferns in weather we call 
spring and ferns were the meal she prepared 
for them the day she first conceived and the first music 
in the garden was the sound humming its way out of her 
during the conceiving, conjuring crystal spiral 
unfurling.  On the floor, the woman has forgotten 
her story, her possible daughters. She has not forgotten 
she is ovulating. The man is stopping 
touching her now. The man tells the woman on the floor 
she has to do something for him now. But first, 
he offers to do something else for her. No. Threatens 
to do. There were no offers that night. When the man 
knocked the woman to the floor her mouth dried. This 
is what desert, death mean now to her. This night, this man
is what terror means now to her. Time will expand 
this definition to night and men. She is learning 
real meanings of common words, here, this night, 
on the floor. On the floor, she will beg this night 
for water. Years later, talking alone in a closed room 
with a man her mouth will dry. She will not ask a man again 
for water. The woman on the floor believes she has a choice 
of what to lose. Does what he has been wanting 
her to do. She kisses him to keep his mouth 
away from her. She will continue to kiss him to keep 
sure of his mouth's whereabouts. She knows, reaching 
for his mouth, she is losing this. The woman 
on the floor is kissing the man who has her 
down on the floor. She feels nothing. She 
feels nothing so when she sees him coming 
out of her and she has felt nothing, known 
nothing, she goes a little maybe you'd say crazy.  
The woman on the floor is making noise and the woman 
is ovulating. On the floor, she knows this.
She begs the man. She will not stop. She will not stop.  
She does not beg him to stop. She knows now he will 
not stop until he stops. She knows when he stops he will 
kill her but maybe he will not kill her maybe 
she will still be alive when he stops and she is 
ovulating. She begs him to let her put in her 
diaphragm. During this time, he has been moving
her, slamming parts of her into what does not 
move--wall, furniture, door--pushing her 
along the carpet the way you push 
hard on a rag wiping a bad kitchen 
and each time the man starts to raise himself above the woman 
to do what a man does above a woman 
the woman has been trying to move underneath him, 
all scatter and confusion in the darkness 
like some blind little animal 
trying to maybe scramble herself maybe somehow away and 
trying to avoid him and she does not know if she is 
avoiding him because she feels nothing 
and the man is pressing down on her so hard 
so hard scraping her into place to keep her 
still. The man is not confused. The man is not pleased.  
The man is not pleased with the woman's behavior. He 
lets her know that. He lets her know that. He lets her 
know her behavior will have to improve. The man tells 
the woman he does not want to hurt her. He 
tells her what he does not want to have to do to her, 
what he does not want to have to make her do. He 
reminds the woman of what he was willing to do 
for her, is still willing to do. He would do that, he says, 
for her. The woman on the floor can not improve 
her behavior but she promises. She promises and the man
decides to allow her the diaphragm. He stands. He looks
down at her. He looks down at her. He tells her she can 
get up. He asks if she wants him to help her get up.  
She says no. She says she can get up. These words 
do not really come out of her mouth. What 
comes out of her is only a slur of sound 
but the man understands this language. She 
gets up.  She is standing.  She falls to the floor.  
A little heap. He offers to help her up. She says 
no. She says she can get up by herself. She 
tries. She tries to get up. She is almost now 
what you could almost call almost standing. She falls again.  
The man says nothing. He picks her up. He holds her 
standing against him. Holding her, holding 
her arms, he half-carries her into the bathroom her hand 
gestures him toward. She scans surfaces, opens cabinets.  
She can not find the diaphragm. She finds the diaphragm. He 
asks if he can help. She says no. He says he wants 
to help. She says no. He contents himself with holding 
her dress up around her waist. She gets 
the diaphragm in. It is over now. She knows this.  
He must know now what he has been doing. It is over now.  
She knows this. He will leave. The man pushes her back 
into the living room. The man tells her she has to get back 
down on the floor now. The woman can not believe 
this is happening. She believes this is happening. 
She believes he still must not know what he is doing.
At the same time she believes he does not know 
what he is doing she believes he knows 
what he is doing and she believes he will kill her. There 
is a word for this simultaneous belief in incongruous 
notions. He makes her get down on the floor.  
He will keep her, there, on the floor 
two more hours. When he leaves he leaves her 
alive. When he leaves he leaves her a five dollar bill.  
When he leaves he leaves her in such good condition 
when people say did he hurt you, she can honestly say, 
No. He did not hurt me.

I never again consult my fern lover's companion.
The meaning of ovulation has been changed for me.


OUTRAGEOUS BEHAVIOR

Georgia eggs remain trending unchanged 
on mediums; the undertone was steady 
at best. Cleveland's donor egg clinic 
can not consider a married woman without 
her husband's permission. Little done-up 
Tammy Faye's reduced to shopping in a 
discount outlet store. My therapist is 
away again on vacation without me in blue 
hill country. A Southside woman last night 
fired directly into the abdomen of a still 
unidentified man who entered in the usual 
way through a window with a knife wanting 
to gag, blindfold her using rags. It was 
a large caliber gun. He died at 10:30 
this morning. Police report no charges 
will be filed. Diana appeared in public 
in a skintight suit. The color was purple.  
The fabric was not disclosed locally. The 
first tropical depression of the season 
seems in no hurry to move. The heart 
of the descending heat pool grows, but lacks 
hunger, momentum of its own.


ISLAND OF THE RAPED WOMEN

There are no paved roads here and all of the goats
are well-behaved. Mornings, beneath thatched shelters,
we paint wide-brimmed straw hats. We paint them
inside and outside. We paint very very fast. Five
hats a morning. We paint very very slow. One hat
a week. All of our hats are beautiful and we all look
beautiful in our hats. Afternoons, we take turns:
mapping baby crabs moving in and out of sand, napping,
baking. We make orange and almond cake. This requires
essence and rind. Whipped cream. Imagination. 
We make soft orange cream. This requires juice
of five oranges and juice of one lemon. (Sometimes
we substitute lime for the lemon. This is also good.)
An enamel lined pan. Four egg yolks and four ounces 
of sugar. This requires careful straining, constant
stirring, gentle whisking. Watching for things not
to boil. Waiting for things to cool. We are good
at this. We pour our soft orange cream into custard
cups. We serve this with sponge cake. Before
dinner, we ruffle pink sand from one another's hair.
This feels wonderful and we pretend to find the results
interesting. We all eat in moderation and there is no
difficulty swallowing. We go to bed early. (Maybe, we
even turn off lights. Maybe, we even sleep naked. Maybe.)
We all sleep through the night. We wake eager from dreams
filled with blue things and designs for hats.
At breakfast, we make a song, chanting our litany
of so much collected blue. We do not talk of going
back to the world. We talk of something else
sweet to try with the oranges: Sponge custard.
Served with thick cream or perhaps with raspberry sauce.
We paint hats. We paint hats.
