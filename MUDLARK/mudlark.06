_Author's Note_


    ISLAND ROAD is an attempt to graft a few idiosyncratic fragments of
late 20th-century experience onto what is basically a Renaissance form,
the sonnet sequence. I have tried to follow the example of John Berryman
and Ted Berrigan on a path which has led to a personal and semi-mythical
encounter with the recurrent shadow of Shakespeare.
    But this is only part of the story, and there are many side-trails
and byways along this road, many of them unfortunately obscured by
thickets and brambles which only the hardiest readers will penetrate.
Here are two simple markers to aid in orientation:

1. "Costaguana" is the name of the fictional Caribbean island nation in
Joseph Conrad's epic novel, Nostromo. Among the novel's central
characters are "the Goulds"; I have introduced them as means of carrying
forward my own story.


2. The "Henry Gould Institute", on the other hand, is a real place (see
sonnet #74). Established in Florence, Italy, by an American
philanthropist many years ago as a "refuge for young Protestants," the
Institute now serves as a hostel for students and other visitors to the
city.

I. THE ROAD FROM COSTAGUANA

             *

1

Maple seedlings twirl out of the reddening leaves
out of the blue cerulean onto ochre bricks
in the clear wonder of one autumn day
everything blushes toward the fall to come

But the road in my mind ends among some birches
somewhere in Siberia    white on white
their limbs garnered into icebound sheaves
woodpiles    a pear-shaped lake frozen like a drum

White too are the endless nights
among huddled words    I am a bundle of sticks
frozen head down signalling "wrong way"

until a forgotten phantom heaves back the door of
the inclined pole    and spring lurches free
bearing my whole body toward    her delirious shore



2

Hooded    you smoke down a street in Petersburg
Neva    a mirror curving out of sight    is
tied in viper ringlets    knots of bridges
weightless    beneath emigrant, phantom blue

A second Venice   third Rome   another dimension
of imitation   in solitary, Ego
slips on that treacherous double ice-floe
loves you, loves you not, a-knotted   suspension...

Ellen, Eleanor, Lenore...   the mask
slips too easily down   to the tickling scarf
down to the salt-laden local   turf

there   to garner is the task, gathering in
skycolored photos of a frozen face
Epiphany...   or a mournful trace of silver.



3

The dogwood is ready to let go drop
her coral pendants   red, red, red.
I am ready to disappear   given the slip
my kiss betrayed.   Gone bare

the dogwood's breathing out her heart
in leafrain   muttering
they are her children   seething
nation   settling   scattered far   apart

The tree has weathered this before
militant stumps   cheer her onward
drifting   over the highway
over the sheer
poignard
                    goodby      goodby



4

Under twirling bivalve helicopters   the winking lariat
of neon rhododendron   I was happy & fickle
with lust   & to join the other buried men
while leaves redden in the growing cold
bold as love   here there is no lament
among persisting branches   what is this revolving
around a bent pole   somewhat   ever-fixed
and broken again   (compost perennial?)

Tell me Berrigan   Berryman   headed
down smiling in the river of ashes, tell me
(frail wasp-punts in the bloodstream
pulse with hunger   a pulverized poor bean-
scramble)   o.k.   they say   maybe
she's your aerial laurel   singing in the streambed




5   Homage to Falstaff

              _Summer so histrionic, marvelous dirty days_


In the cold steel sheepdog winter of lust
a strange tact island of ability
to penetrate to the marrow maybe
tomorrow's rainbow aorta   blood the sharp-
eyed carpenter   lifting out of his mind's
orbit a couple   a coupla   a cupola
               *
               *

Ireland of squander roar
by jovial collider collage
kaleidoscope college!
& to lie be down near the Cranston line
with pennywhistle & brawny whore-
heart   the sun, he says, and then he says   all mine!



6

Wind from the last of Hurricane Lil knocks off
the dogwood leaves til there are few, or none.
Rain soaks my dreams:  bears in the ruined choirs
Napoleon, poignant, besieges 40 days & nights
the bears in his dreams are wearing tights
and heavy armor   over the 12 gates, candled fire
& the priestess   phosphorous glow-worm of the black sun
keens a long E in glottal reverse   a cyrillic raven
squares up the Mayday precinct with a (cough) sacral puff

Meanwhile   sweet birds, Will   sing late
untouchable & second-best, always   in your last will and
testicles   and the doomed lambs of heaven
are everywhere, on hillside and on streets, if you will: the
tenant's stray flocks, unmoved by the remover's   joker's fate



7

In me you see the evening.   Gold dust
a yellow level   bled   bubbled   wavering toward
black night.   Russian rug on the study floor
Mongolian-eyed   knighted   squared   grandmastered

On a gray New England October day.
Slow gray streets spangled with coral &
curled toward Hibernian sleep.   My
green Sears Constellation all that remains


& it was yours.   Stars wheel overhead
no consolation only an alphabet of levers and pulleys
tackle of a speech machine.   So much
revolves around the idle pinprick of a queen
so pale   so small   her sheepish finger strays &
stirs divided memories once left for dead.



8

A small tree (almond, dogwood) flowering in your eyes
leafs through my spine, speaks volumes (my needle betrays).

Maple leaf like a reef of sharp-eyed coral
or hand cut by a blue glass frisbee
(your hand shakes: it's constitutional in our society)
insinuating states of etats-unis
or "marriageable rose some truant lips annul"

That sheepdog would play in my summer's unruly realm
but then she's furred as well for wolfish winter
(one sheepshank: constellational insanity)
A stratagem of light nips & barks   scotch banter &
morning roads are opening   in her ample palm

& everywhere this Love comes home to me!
as every island road leads to the sea.



9

Hand me a red road bouquet for the journey,
my little sheepdog   I will be true to the dead end.
smoky twin   little rose iceberg escapade
only cold steel can match your flinty circumpolarity.



Through the brain fog   I see a maze of canals
mirrored in the Northern Lights   and over there
beyond the iron bandshell, an eggshell dome bears
icons of a green-eyed Magdalen   lifting scales.

And I can pledge my shoulder to the bricks
with honor   but you are only a collage yourself, a
puddingstone mosaic hefting interior triple domes   and if
I want inside your fur   you just want to play tricks...

And this is how we babble along together alone
down Land O'Lakes road (alone, together, it's all one).



10

Bells ring as the days move toward snow,
days governed by a different providence,
not this quivering burg of whims and nerves,
as shanty towns move through experience
sleep   encircled hope   here on the wharves
of Costaguana   under a brooding mountain's brow.

The old sabre over the mantle   who would have known
cold steel could cauterize   each heart's high noon?

The word apportions beauty   pride of place
& vanity   while courage opens doors   &
echoing compassions bless
(with mirrored cherubim) your   pulsing search
(Bells droning onward   into the azured arch
silvered toward a frosted   yeast of snows)



11

O my snows of yesteryear!  & as the Tide
in the affairs of men enters the rinse cycle,
I hear her washing the world
& dressing it in clean linen
revolving everyone
from iris to sunflower, from Want
to Give (all in the twinkle
of a sigh).   O my soul's Giantess!

               ray		

terrace                     rest

               all



12

We'll go more steeply into the dark,
& travel down under the moss & the dead
leaves   & go under shadows   of
daylight savings, as November comes on.



We'll go toward sleep, my thrush, my sleepyhead
& hear the mutter of an undertow
across pebbles, & mournful puddingstone;
we'll roll, black one, toward your lonely mark.



We'll follow the ghost dance through hedgerows,
& wear rotten pumpkins for crowns
on the last night. We'll light a little spark
& watch it fade over lead-gray fields.



We'll wait until our hearts are already heavy & full.
& then we'll lower the pail, slowly, into your well.



13

Yesterday the trees were passionate
an indiscriminate planet piling on sweet
plenitudes of leaves in the harvest light,   while
august   the firmament   planted a blue & final kiss

Yesterday's kings trundled forth from castles
bumblebees were   drunken sailors in the grass
& like honeyed wax   bearing his father's seal
Hamlet wheeled around toward Elsinore.

Today soft rain flattens the brown plane leaves
Earthfilled mouths mutter to life once more
In the All Souls' light   living & dead   alas
are spun together   just above their graves

& Hamlet   yes   comes home, & it is no dream
Ophelia is singing in the stream.



14


First the voices twitter from the graves like starlings
choirs of worms   or harmonizing skulls
& then graves open   & the dead walk home
& everywhere is home & light springs from dust

& the dust like a school of swallows suddenly swims
over gables of firmament,   shaped like a wing
This is dusk   the beginning of Rome, Byzantium:
a host of unkempt, furry voices   swirling   full throttle

(while golden elm leaves scatter against gray sky,
expiring sparks against lead-tempered walls,
a green-eyed goldfinch tucks away her beak
& hides within   my weak, my   white-haired heavens)
                     *
                     *

      _for Edwin Honig_


Mysterious day of perpetual evening.
Old men are following the pendulum
& making out their wills.   Unweary children
laugh in dusky light   set leafboats floating

An old Horatian aristocrat
paces the dull docks in Costaguana,
his voice grown tremulous.   A red bandanna
drifts in the harbor (relic of the coup d'etat).

I hear you, old man   measuring your steps
your will & testament are mine as well.
A phantom with a black silk parasol
crossed our two swords   cancelled our debts

beneath a palm leaf   made of whispering
that cuts to blood   & sutures everything



16
 
The principle of the sword was benign & frozen
an ice-word   or presiding ray gone into deep night
or frost mantle   like wool over our eyes
at the inaugural   horizontal   curved like a mirror
a vertigo spiral   the principle of the sword
cuts clean   & swallows its tale of America

_A palm leaf divided the sky &
lined the donkey road to the contested city._

But I shall always be faithful unto you, dogwood
though I was untrue   like a bad American shepherd
weak & hysterical   in a dead decade's light
it's just   the principle of the sword   that tries
like a royal finger
to blot out all those memoirs   made of sighs



17
 
Silver will never disintegrate or fade
because it's dead. Charlie emerges from the mine
a washed-out half-life   blue eyes blinkered
for the hole ahead (no parakeet, no sign
of life). It is a metalloid eternity
that slides life downward-forward into decay of
everything around the cave mouth crumbling
a furrowed hillside Charlie's mastery...

Under the steel sword   over the mantle
a leaf of petrified coral smoulders   fitfully
surrounded by black lakes of glinting coal
	
& what was mirrored there   dark eyes could tell
no one, no one   arose   petal by petal
leaf by leaf,   rose   everlastingly



18

Very deep in his mine called "mine"
Charlie were consolidating him deposits.
Over a bullion pit he a-hoist an icon
of Aurora Borealis (his light departed).

& out of her eyes of tempera & petroleum
she overlooked his temper tantrums
tawdry bawled-out longings
& repulsive victories. She, she understand
when the Quest draw to a close finish,
smoothed over, evened out...finally
(& incommodiously) lost!  Her wish
came true when he parlay his last penny

to the camp girls, gave his shoulder a bored pat
& help him into a cab. & that was that.



19
 
            _i.m. Henry Pussycat_


The gals is angrier, it's all the rage,
& boys am angriest, & selfisher,
& sans that do-re-mi
you won't be bacon on no Sunshine Stage
besides hotels. --You done blanch ornerier,
Mr. Bones, that is fo sho!

& rust was spoken, up the wheels,
& baby birds, plebeian mighty low,
& golden bowls, be broken too,
til Slocum Henry tired of all them spiels.
He feed his sheepdog nag a whackeroo,
& sets off, awful slow,

& heftin his heavy northern pikebone stingray,
goes on, his merry all post-humorous way.



20

The true, not the calendar November
has arrived. I float beneath gray clouds
the color of brain, or imminent rain
& scrabble snoozing screed beside the river's
stolid girdle. Megaphones explain
(across bank troughs & boring crowds)
the blaring's sponsored (by somebody or other).

Only these vacant, granite spaces bother
to remember the cost of all that labor,
& it's shrinking Grandma under her arbor
hard by Grandpa in the ground
_comprende_  better than any still around
how Adam plowing in the _fado_ dust
taught them to fade, as each we must.



21

    Deep in his mine, Charlie lay perched on a scaffold,
intent on his labor of love, his masterpiece, the _Magdalen-
as-Fallen-Woman-Repentant Almost Gored by A Mastodon-
Blessedly-Cuffed-from-Behind by the Silver Shackles of
Jesus-Androgynous._

    How devoted to his hobby Charlie ferociously was!
Many were the nights the gracious Mrs. Gould spent
fending for herself with the gimpy misanthropic Doctor,
their homogenized houseguest. The surly, withdrawn old
medical man adored Mrs. Gould, his hostess; he would say 
(with that wry, habitual shrug so characteristic of him), 
he confessed, he knew next to for nothing about art.

    One day the winter cold snapped the aluminum
on that scaffold. Charlie was left hanging by a stalactite!
And a stalagmite (one in each hand)! Until he was
rescued by a blackened crowd of Costaguanian riffraff,
who had been observing him there, regularly, on 
their lunchbreak. 



22
                        
A strange justice prevailed in Costaguana
like the 4-way iron needle on the Courthouse clock
in Providence   pointing forever to high noon
because it's broke
like the industrious neatness of the piranha
or proverbial goodness   evinced by the monsoon
or divine palm oil (grouse or manna)
a strange justice prevailed in Costaguana.

He hung there   anchored to a beam   and shot
guy wrong place wrong time   wheedling leather merchant
scum    rot   animal, to be blunt

Take him down & keep him   he's your boob
like a toothpick in the lip of a gentle scribe
pursed with reddening petals   3, 2, 1...   Atone.



23   Sea-Shanty

Splash   (the clock on the wharf strikes midnight)
no other sound   but that anchor going down
in the lagoon   (and the medusa ringlets, the
dark petals of water & salt   soon vanish)

& mirrors   vaguely rippled & dispersed
the granite on the promontory   a hand   blessing or
gathering   at the prow, the poop of some vessel
a-tilt in the stiff wind   of a fresh curse

harpoon   Ahab   captain   follows
the snapped   iron going   down into the hold
of the sea

which swallows him
surrounded by fold   on whispered   fold of
blind   fingers   (& a reedy sigh)

                        

24

What are you doing today...   it's raining here.
Election day--it's over finally,
the money's paid. Time again to stare
angrily-complacently at your favorite program.

I get the feeling you don't give a damn
while they do whatever they want to (in your name).
Whoever's running what are on a spree,
a sponsored corporate bipartisan   scam.

What are you doing today...   from water's world
looms from below   a cupola   of faded voices
forms   each petal of   concentric breakers

the sceptre of the heart, mirrored   centripetal
& rose   out of dogwood splinters   drifting coral
bronze veins   plow the upturned air   & the sea rejoices



25
 
Waiting to go to London on an airplane, &
wondering about the anagram of your name
& my hand mirrored in the threads of your palm,
O    costly Brazilian singer from Lebanon

Husbanded by cedars   heroin   microphones
where are you now?
running after quarters after
a quarter of a century somewhere

surrounded by child labor,
among sheep you are   a shepherd's quandary
building Jerusalem O
from hope   and feeble-hearted stones,

ALMA   my shady tree-lined
soul's in your palm again



26

Evening sky   vast, endless, generous. If only
sheepish human measure could compare
with cloud strokes floating so euphoric there;
full stop   holding their breath
in the abyss
of pastel blue. Verily
I say unto you. Unable to express.
What is this festive dusk,   the Preacher saith.

To show you,   ALMA   (crown of darkness
aureole &   balm)

(black hole
where hunger swirls   beneath your palm)

my    disintegrated   soul, one
turbulent   ink-blind   universe



27

It seems like London here today   the air
is murk   edges are gray    as the Professor
smuggles a bomb beneath a threadbare macintosh,
   sky tumbling around like dirty wash.

Wherever you are, you aren't here today.
Absent as a pendulum   this way, that way
swings in an empty cage   while
some folk keep faring forth   on arduous pilgrimage--

before the heavy snows bury their sorrow
& burden of nightfall settles   on the year
& the tattered   tattooed body   here below

recedes in white lime   a phosphorous glare
& the star in the milk turns black   yes   right here
					    
                     *



28

                     _near Norwich, by the Thames_


Trees merge with the darkness   coral, camouflaged
above the river,   quiet, smooth and ceaseless.
Hidden by nightfall,   stars, arranged
in the heavens,   drift   reflected there.

You tugged your sweater close around your dress
& let me wrap an arm across your shoulder as
the last of summer pulled us both downstream,
so adamant, so casual, unvarying, and calm.

Those fingers lifted to my shivering lips
were hidden in the darkness too   & now
my heartbeat mimics you
& stained with all this darkness, steps
toward some anonymous London afterlife,
incognito (the ache   of universal grief).



29   An Icon
 
            _woke up this mornin' with my mind
            set on freedom..._


I wanted to make you happy with another poem,
& as the star of a nation   droops low
in the great NW sky   I wanted to flood you
with fishbaskets   from Rome, Byzantium

& as the voice of Marian Anderson
ricochets off the Memorial (& over the
heads of the D.A.R.)   I wanted the star
(with its consort   of muffled organ)
to surface--and plumb   the mansions of heaven

& these desires of mine
hung there   pendulous   like fireworks,
or   all the other & Various   Works of Man--
waiting, waiting   (like sheepdogs--wandering barks)
for the miracle of your   ink-black   inspiration



30
 
                  _i.m. Joseph Bernardin & Meridel Le Sueur_


A strange fortitude hovers over the fort
this morning   spangled pupils aim for the black
holes in bunkered irises:   with a bark
a virtual Putnam keys a command:   Foursquare alert!

I had a dream last night I was talking
to a poisonous spider like a little white ball
rolling toward me--   he was the King of Milk
in the murk of a cedar cellar   & he swirled,
ALMA   among his lambs   & amid a UNION
swathed in silver pennies   & Chicago cardinals

From you, for you, with you   shall not
perish   though the sword rose in sorrow
& bitter to the taste--   each coin farmed out to the river
turned copper and rusted   in your streambed heart



31   Henry's Muse

                         _by the Providence River_


The river drowses like a flickering sword,
on past infinite farmyards gone to seed, a lamp
in a prairie palm   meadows & towns   loud
wail of a long-gone train (Transcontinental Tramp).

Anoint me with the oil of your guttering candle,
London, for   my mint is pennyroyal, &
my royal headache's eased now--   but I'm seeing double--
& blood will flush the curtained chamber of Jerusalem.

Shall I place it on my head?   I'm cold
in this coin of a bowling broken realm.
I'd put an arm across your shoulder, gal--

in the sceptred greenhouse--   should I be so bold?
It's you, O   green-eyed National Velvet   at the helm--
Empress my soul now, for   my mint is pennyroyal



32 

If I were King, I'd put my alms across
your soul   Let go the superflux!
No more hung-up   long-drawn & hamleted
in quarters very-locked   bombed-out

Is Kosmos then   cut to the waistline of our gluttony?
(Yundt walks past the coffeeshop.) Can we
afford the theater in Dallas? Or was
the UNION all in vain, alas [etc.]?

Crowds of trenchcoats going by...   the Father
of his Country, greenish-faced, on magic carpet
in the sky...   & the sea   like a mother   rose
in my heart.   Small ring in his palm, the courtier
boned the envelope   with wax of paternity   &
like ALMA   rather than Mammon, chose   eternity


                                 11.22.96



33

                     _Property was thus appall'd,
                     That the self was not the same_


The trees are withered to the bare bones now
& in the shallows of regret & out of work
I walk the streets   & make myself a mark
evading by a hair a roving   garbage scow

The skies are lowering   & shall these bones
live again?   I'll go evangelize the Stones
in London   & your green-eyed compass rose
must crown me not myself   like some Napoleon

& our Thanksgivings, now   shall be provisional
with the purity of a circus   & the order
of a dark street's gypsy camp   & in a tattered
Creole pilgrim flame   we shall be gathered up,
snowed-in again,   where streams run copper-colored:
my small estate, which is   the smallest coin of all



34
 
Shakespeare was Bacon on a sunshine stage,
a secret agent, or   unperfect actor
and if this is a crown
it's a fool's crown, or
crown of dogwood splinters, wreath'd
with your absent part   & three parts rage

Is it megalomania or is it shame
that drove me from the Doctors into wilderness
& set me spinning toward your globe of fame?

& when those Aprils born of tenderness
hail down sweet kelsons of the cosmic frame-
up   I'll be standing in my shepherd's weeds--   a wildness

tamed    by what I know comes not from me:
adhesive happenstance--O   Chair   of Anonymity



35
 
The snow fell, finally   on your birthday
ripe Thanksgiving earth all    a sheep   in sheep's clothing
but growing cold.   Your old lovers walk by,
lonely   & how did Lazarus   inherit everything?

Marlow knows. Sternly over the stern
he views a murky star beneath the wake
wavering goodby   all your white hair going down
to Sheol,   stellular   for Marlow's sake.

The air was dark above Gravesend.
He resembled a pilot. Promotion to the fleet
at Ravenna. & only later to apprehend.

Benign immensity. Unceasing service. Meet
the Dark Lady   around Medusa Bend
& delicate snow shall be    your wedding sheet.

                  _Eternity, oh Eternity!  That is our business.
                                    --Roger Williams_


With a mouthful of Narragansett conversation
& a scroll for London   to charter a star

With a handful of snow   (proverbial heaven's
scale of values, like a wheel
or buoyant garden   of aerial cedar)

the friend of Canonicus & Miantonomi
set sail   at Christmastide   aye
to gather firewood splinters   for the poor
& handshake freedom   for the colony

Aye   there was a kingly man
whose bare estate was   commonweal
a breath of air   unearthly, sure
like a flock of cardinals   hovering home
high up   in the cupola--   (afloat,   again)





II. A Midnight Masque (in Greenwich Time)

                    **

37
 
High up in the cupola, afloat again
above my mangy cradle   wooden cardinals
drift   wavering   mobile
in the mind's eye   & stream's reflection

Those light motes flicker   toward the shortest day
Lucia's   solstice   dying of the year;
in evening light   these shadowy things appear
revolving, wheeling round   in peripeteia   toward the clay

& from black shining clay   is born   a star
November star   gathering straw toward home
& shepherds' glinting wheat   & draws it near

like dust   the dusty origin of Rome,
Byzantium   my cardinals share
beginning   with the dark   & wintry tomb




38

Beginning with the dark & wintry tomb
of black-holed heaven for a fixed star
& only heaven knows   I'm going home
at last   as the year dies   we are
upheld by hope alone,   as the lights fade
& the year dies,   & the Thames flows on
toward the minimum   I shall put on
my cardboard crown   take up my wooden sword

Lucia   ALMA   Black Madonna

& there   beneath your shadowy umbrella,
whirling double M   U-turn
of murky justice   swirling   NNW
you palm your _nostos_ kosmos to the urn--
this clay-born sunburnt stage   put to the test



39
 
This clay-born sunburnt stage put to the test
my broken love,   nativity   and grave
of nothingness:   of this you'll make a masque
of merry Yule   & deathly Mexico
earth mother jigsaw   jaguar   brooding husk
ascending darkness   from your subway rest
you make a somber harmony   slow
sunken ark:   a turtle's   phoenix nest

This lacerated miracle   & long drawn-out
debacle-spectacle   enacts
the buoyant coffin: serious   Ishmael's womb--
the dogwood splinter   green-eyed mote   &
drifting flotsam:   heaven's cataracts
poured out in tears   to give the New Year room



40

Poured out in tears to give the New Year room
--thus Hamlet leaps into the grave again
Laertes   in his mirror   will resume
shaving portentously   & lifts his heavy blade
of wood--   crisscross the boards
they make a brooding pistoll'd sign
& pass away   into the Danish gloom

& over the frostbound earth   now floats the rain
& sweeps away   Ophelia's memory
her crown of pennyroyal   soaked, unwoven,
soiled with her   submerged   anonymous clay

& on the evening of the shortest day
but one star gleams   faint   unproven
there   in broken-hearted   sailors' heaven



41

There   in broken-hearted   sailors' heaven
a green star glimmers   out of death & life
arose, eros   crossroad   & sign of strife
uplifted toward eternity--   a stolen
Beatrice
                  spiral
                                 goldfinch
eye    looks out for me:   my strictest
mistress:   cedar pole, sweet cinch
sky-borne:   clay heart's   arrest

& now rich Lazarus   before your bench
draws out the thorn--cannot resist
& flings it toward the deep   Atlantic trench--
London awaits   the prince will do his best
to steer his splinter coracle,   & stitch
his broken sword   into your burning nest



42

His broken sword into your burning nest
His ALMA   fractured   on the heavenly heights
his wheel set spinning in the slippery clay
his ark off-course   & sputtering in circles

his star gone down   his heaven out of sight
his name unknown--her name a roundelay
his reputation marked   & scandalous
his frame   disrobed:   unwelcome guest

begone into the night   that gave you birth
blend shadow now with shadow   palm to palm:
all goes to hell   & spirals upside down
& dances   mawkish clown   on frozen ground:
this frenzy   of the stateless pilot   calm
as death   that spice   of bitter mirth



43

As death   that spice of bitter mirth
& treason of the summer's treasury
smirks like a poison through the veined cup
& tips the sword-point of your misery
& gaily tippling   fever   laps it up
into the maelstrom   of a cardboard earth

Taste thy reward   O vengeful minister:
the playful sword shall pierce your own heart too
& as the streambed carries off your star
the scent of pennyroyal, celandine   & rue
hangs in the air   a muted melody,
an afterthought. Belated knight
your tragedy
is over.   --Ever born to set it right.



44

Is over--ever born to set it right--
revolves around again,   a globe
scrolled   with mummy   maple leaves
& sealed now   regal, mute   this orb
& bishopric   shall staff   your wooden flight
O donnish martyr   bringing in the sheaves

& mistress-master   Nobody   bereaves:
that admiral   coming home, one-armed
with ink   that Lazarus   his barn
undone   his sheepish camouflage   out-farmed
his one-eyed   giant rival (quite a blight)
puts out the sun   & leaves the field   all white
                  *
                  *



45

Puts out the sun   leaves the field   all white
& spun away   a milky web,   unearthly
blind   & melted   into burning tongs,
hammers out the galaxies   high-tested fire
sword-sharpened   marked   by mockery
& hidden   bivalved moth   of murky tongues
you blaze, Aurora   tapestry of night
& turning   shining   constellated   Sire

your   mystery
unfolds         these
            rose
      lips'      petals,
                              portals
rustle a   russet   sigh



46

Rustle a   russet   sigh
spread risen   pole to pole
& whispered   black   on high
            stem
          thorned
          throned
             a
           psalm

Out of the shortest day   a narrow berth,
a vessel pledged   to covenant of grief
            & joy--
& lift your voice with voices   leaf on leaf
out of the mournful festering   of lying earth



47

Out of the mournful festering   of lying earth
the noisy nonsense   all my muttering
one
      lone
            star
                  came
                        forth,   one
                  island
            rose,
      and
blooming,
            sang
                        to me:

_I am   that cardinal goldfinch--apple of your eye_



48

I am   that cardinal goldfinch--apple of your eye
the shadowy ALMA of your soul   I am
that blackened penny--widow's mite
that brought down satraps & their soldiery

I the hand   that lifts your wooden sword
& renders peace   unto divided night
I the mind   that ponders sorrow--word
gave Dante voice   & flowered Mandelstam

So she whispered--so I wrote it down.
&amp; as her features faded into sky
she looked on me   & said--   I am
_the rood your bloodline bears--your palm's lifeline,
I am   the Lion   left out of your play
high up   in the cupola   afloat   again_



49   (Coda)


High up in the cupola, afloat again

beginning   with the dark & wintry tomb

this clay-born sunburnt stage   put to the test

poured out in tears   to give the New Year room

there   in broken-hearted sailors' heaven

his broken sword   into your burning nest



As death   that spice    of bitter mirth

is over--ever born to set it right

puts out the sun   & leaves the field   all white

rustle a   russet    sigh

out of the mournful festering   of lying earth

_I am   that cardinal goldfinch--apple of your eye_

                     *


(I am the Lion   left out of your play.)

Christmas is coming   to the ancient town
now is that ruby Goldfinch lamp unsealed
that Cardinals proclaim (& also Wren)
lights every soul   & overcomes the world.

Every soul is Kosmos then--a little world
that with a breath of nature   comes into its own:
so these pinetree boughs declare.   Be faithful then
& leave the wind to work: be patient--bold.

Here   in the poor & wayfaring East End
a reconstructed Globe is almost done--
rotund profundity that proves   no man's an
island.

& here I am   in England's green & pleasant
land
to square that circle--a prophetic one
that lights both my beginning   & my end.

III. Don't Get Ready for Mardi Gras (blush)

                    ***

51

The struggle of the mind to bring to bear
a pattern in the mystery   the quiet
balance   imaged in these wet
streams   circling the old town everywhere.

Here once came   the young barbarian,
who fell in love   with this integrity of
land   & gently curving waterway;
found kingdom come   a petrine origin,
where dikes   domesticate the ocean --
Atlantis,   very human now   & Dutch.

& here   within this village radius
the labors of a Mondrian   circuitous
uplifted principle   serene   would reach
a dreamy apogee--   & build a world to match.

                  _In 1996 alone, between one million and three
                  million people died of malaria...someone dies
                  of it about every 15 seconds--mostly children
                  and pregnant women...A more fundamental 
                  problem is that many people cannot afford even
                  ordinary mosquito nets, which cost $5 or $10._
                                 --NY Times, 1.8.96


Think of your body growing cold   again.
Think of what fades   and what survives.
Think not of the dark wind, rain
a-sway over villages   apples & leaves

Snow lies on the clay. Mosquitoes
& silver coinage.  Malaria.
Mysterious unjust angel of woe,
hysteria...   head down in the white.

And through the fetters of a flimsy lattice
or stage-struck curtain--   an extended paw
quilled with fabled disappearances--that
mole of metaphysical law--

Shakespeare   vanished into pseudonyms
trimming his nails   frozen   sheer



53   Henry's Notebook

Everyone to be issued a gondola
and five dollars.

Proust stayed behind in Venice.
O sole mio. Bronze bells.

Silver mine in the crevices of your
self--where Mammon shines.

_Non sine sole iris._ Cold eyes,
Liza.  Ears and mouth snatched
up in the velvet folds.

_Duende._

Longing for the dark spring wind.
Oscillating Milton sword.
Of dogwood.

~~wave goodby~~



54

Wave goodby now to the shadows passing clear
across the river in their coppery gondolas.
Charlie, Mrs. Gould, the Doctor, good
Nostromo, yes   the Man   _uomo nostro_
salt   of bold tormented fortitude

will   steer through
breakers of dusk   over the bow,
alas

Only in Hades may   you understand
at last   this iron-anchored   tenderness,
a glinting curve   in the mud & rust--
her flagrant disguise--   one hand
leading the way   into a further darkness,
weighted   with all earth (& loneliest).



55

Surely the earth is a kingly vessel   buried
at Sutton Hoo   treasure--cups, coin,
crowns, bells, lamps, swords of high-
domed doom, of lambs, of snow, almonds,
rivers of golden birds, eyes
of roses, apples, silver palms, &; clay
dogwood seas
                  & surely
all my turbulent & sinuous ways
are barrowed there   already

Seasons revolve   rolling   warming & chill
my body is   or was,   still
now   ever,   this
Brownian seasonal motion,   so angular-
insular, in muddy moats   of dust



56

Measured now   dark winding of the spring
beneath the cupola. (Fink walks by
the coffeeshop.) Amazed on Morris Avenue
(the gold-domed temple   launched into the blue)
you lead me down this island road   the ring
in my hand yours, O   mere breath of air (sigh).

As the bent palm leaf leads the king
(Blind King, Venetian--Federal Hill) toward
a national crown o'thorns--green
chastening around the track--a Florentine
all-monde roadrace crusade--or
lolling MW princess--thinking

double you   dark S   in me--

It's only the bark of a gypsy sheepdog, set adrift.
Fractal ripples in the land o'lakes, anonymous.
Present the like time--no time.
The wing-ding blows horns--Jericho Mardi Gras.

Airfuls of brightness from the Roman front.
Streaming by in her late shift.
Hello fella--Midnight here--what she want?
The ring, what else--ride on your mule.

Played me   once & for all   for a fool.
Cross road w/lime--you get rhyme.

Jailbird flutters through the dark bullpen.

& the museum is usually closed on Monday!
Let's go for a walk around the block.
Hey--

Pointing forever to high noon, just
because. She's waiting in the wings for him.
They only winged him. A one-armed
gamblin' hurricane   ALMA   got there first--

where time stops   the wind is   re-wound



60

His birthday comes around just once a year,
dying and born anew, though, every day--&
if he weren't over yonder, he'd be here.

Meek baritone of the mighty Milky Way,
a tenor of the flock, he's where his words are--
soaring majesty!

Mark how blood shudders in the fixed star!
Tin harmonica below--(a joe named Luther)--
King of sheepdogs--(dogged sheep)--you are!

                  *

Papyrus--pink-palmed scrolls--about to flower,
my speckled maple stretches toward the feeble sun...
some early spirit   of your ancestor
tenders black lamb's-wool   & a ruddy crown:
rose orientation   lent   serene   uplifted   fire.

IV. To the Green Constellation

              ****

61   Henry's Dream

    In my dream, Everywoman was an icon. We were at a conference on the
malaria epidemic. Urban locale--refined, old European (Siberia?). We
walked past the coffeeshop at 99 19th Street, around the block, past the
museum at 145 10th Avenue, & entered the Birch Tree Grotto (126 Verde
Triangle).

    In the corner, under a pastel postcard of Costaguana, a retired
silver bell manufacturer was babbling into his bowl of mead. My
colleague pointed out a petite, lynx-eyed Asian woman at the next table.
"Funny thing--when we're in the field, she swims without her shirt on. I
tried, you know...but she laughed me off--said (in her awkward English)
'You think you pick out for every woman pleasure cave.'"

    I saw her then, breast-stroking upstream underwater, as graceful as
a yellowbacked red-ringed cormorant. Introducing myself in a mature &
friendly manner, I asked whether perhaps she hailed from Thailand. "A
native of Italy," she replied.

    Later I was sleeping with someone else (from the bookstore). A young
Asian lad had the 2nd-best bed there (on the floor of the cramped hotel
room). I put my arm across her shoulder, & she milked me like a generous
nurse (before my time had come). _Suddenly there came an uncanny ringing
of applause__--& when  we got out of bed, I saw she was glistening,
slim, fit as a runner. (I thought --she'll get acquainted with the Asian
fellow more thoroughly later.)

    I spent the rest of my dream trying quite unsuccessfully to speak
Italian with everybody, including the waiters.



62

                    _my sweet shadow, quiet sister of dusk._


A January snow. What will the New Year bring?
I shiver--   someone walk across my grave--
in cedars   London-bound   the cardinals sing
apocalypso--   Jubilee arrive--
	
"When Norwich Thames do come to Amersfoort..."
this incarnation of   a devious rose
is watered with my tears--   the bells start
ringing   _fair, kind, true_   into the night...

That flickering sword   (so calm, so adamant)
would drown the body's spark, the mind's despair;
the ring   enveloped in your palm, my   cormorant
shows finer mettle--   saves the camel   by a hair--

& only a merciful   & midnight sun
from knotted multitudes   will burnish   one.


63   Henry's Siege of Moscow

At least 2 weeks have passed   without a call, &
I'm ready to disappear   into my dream,
set out on awful pilgrimage,   carol
through a mannered wilderness (or some such scheme).

A soused Paul Bunyan   lost at Mardi Gras
pursues your   motionless   & green-eyed mountain--
stomping   so Superior   in far-gone car
while black-ice brows re-hearse   Napoleon.

My shoulders ache   with so much borrowed bliss,
& rival horns   & slanderous esteem
& seething Time   would scatter all of this--til
beat-up silver   swings the pendulum--

your glancing silence penetrates   so far,
I'm roused from sleep   wondering   where we are



64

The evening sky's   sapphire & tenderness
would teach the frail wasp   to wait for honey;
this weedy waiting   as the light grows less
is measured now   (as every Jack can see).

My wooden   rhododendronship   would sing
your miracle of seeing fingers--branch
on branch alight (if such a backward thing--
& shy--could sing)--   a verdant avalanche

or undertaking   of the universe...
but I will wait--   & waiting   (drop by drop
as honey oozes from   the broken comb)

I'll hear your heartbeat   stem the flood of time,
as shadows of your chariot   wheel   stop &
stoop low   to kiss   my weak echo   of your course
	
	

65

Lust burns, decays--   a glaring half-life
Time's false staff leads   to oblivion.
Time staffs the dining hall   with frothing strife
(brief-basking dogmatists   define, refine)

& hurtles doomside-down   my send-up heart.
Eyes & mouth    breasts   back & legs--   just so--
three find it delicious--   & a fourth
sinks,   faithless,   in a crate   at Sutton Hoo... 

Still   in your palm   (wide   as the Black Sea)
these sheaves of tears   ferment,   compost to wine--
one shady gulf   & odalisque   Eternity
you enter   ruby-scarved, O   purple   vine--

across tall buildings,   seas    a single band
will intercede for me--your   tendriled   hand.



66   Pussycat's Daydream

The sun turned black, & day   was turned to night,
a hurricane   sank all the gondolas,
it rained   until it reached skyscraper height
& reeking wires   crosstown   blacked out, alas!

Three leopards--   Lust, & Jealousy, & Time--
were stalking down my   allegorical streets
when suddenly,   a windy coracle--lambs,
birds--climbed up,   as if propelled with   sweet

mouthfuls of air--&   dangled like a tent
above   spiracular ripples--   (one leaf, two
broke off)   an island   --shimmering, distant--
drifting in that haze...   & it was you,

Atlantis, rose--   full sail, a-whirl--green   Dipper!
--clinching New Time! (machinery   began to purr)...



67

Titanic dreams remain   where sunk--they lie,
a dogwood scar   for all your jealousies--
Ahab's last glimpse   in Moby's blank black eye,
Medusa-marriage   tombed   in frozen seas.

Blind mirror queen--you   star   of my bleak deeds!
Atlantis! mangered   in lagoons' decay...cracked
silver frame, that   weights me   to the weeds...
your jewelled   junk   checkmates   decoded day.

That lucid, tyrannous & cold iris
drags earth off-course,   harpooned to nothingness--
& my short stake   in everlasting   Venice is
a pained & painted wail   to   Davy Jones--unless

those arrows in your palm   are not in vain--
plain words come tumbling through   your vine again. 



68   Henry's Sleep Report

I saw a needle of strange fortitude
bolt through the vault, like   a mosquito farming
the blue   or unstable sable-yellow feathered
hornet's trumpet vine's   metamaterial   barnstorming--

an M   an S   whirled--miles over that tangled isle
like a bull's-eye of assassinated   justice
in the court of angels,   or   long-lost medal
of stolen honor, or   incarnadine boomerang of unbound   bliss--

&   this tiny cantilevered carriage   pricked the skies
across a verdant constellation--   binding the said
sad impress,   blessing   with mourning eyes
& pity,   spanning,   spinning across   with ruby thread--

& so   your guileless disguise   prevailed   on high, as
you unwound   your own   4th of July



69

Grapes, lilacs, olive-shoots--   like arrows
in a shower up my spine.   What strange bouquet
inscribes your presence,   phantom Rose!
We'll two by two now--travel in a ray.

& O how amiable it is--   your swallow's nest;
I'll be a doorkeeper by day, O   threefold
arch--   your bosom's ward--&   [skip the rest]--
bail milky cataracts from a footstool   scaffold.

& at the nadir   of midwinter sun
we'll stand in uniform   beneath the Admiralty:
him, myself & thee.   We'll form a union,
manifold   with evening marble   from the sea--

three musky tears   tri-welded   bands of steel--
true counterparts--   & all in all   --is real!



70

                  _and no one knows who killed the King
                  or the two princes by his side..._


Ray fading, dying. With him dies
a nation's truth--tongue-tied by law
& lawlessness. Must we forfeit the prize
those granite spaces, stony swords   foresaw?

If underlying all--conspiracy!
Low somber bells drone on--   a slow _fado_
for dissonant & dusty empires...   O   mercy
upon us all   (the moon   bleeds into snow).

Some sailor's heaven   is not vanity.
Her Florentine chessboard   shall be your bond,
Hamlet's plywood sword   your surety.
In pentagonal &   penetrating sound

the ring of truth   will wring out tyranny--   &
plow the plowers back (so these bells   prophesy).

                                 
                             1.14.97



71   Henry's Very Little Testament

"The morning sky was like   a robin's egg,
& winter sun   was burnished gold   & jovial..."
--my many-colored kodak zigzags here to
abridge this dicey coda   (sad confessional).

Your eyes   that mourn   for every buried man,
your arguments   that peirce authority,
with palmseed rays   begin   what you began
in palmy days--   the sceptred lie's decay.

O dearest dogwood,   sheepish sliver mine,
your subway token's trained   for Jubilee--
one handmaid's handmade   hobo trampoline
that [aggregated naughty admirals]   will never see.

To them--my iced cremains at Sutton Hoo. &
all my unremaindered hands--post-humorously--to you.



72

Between the swamp gas of   your ghostly Mardi Gras
& surly clowns attached   to every crossroad bar
between a ghoul-dug knight &   very bored Aurora
under cherubim above   the electric chair

Above the undertow   over the lead-gray sea
beneath the slippery clay   below the frozen ground
between the royal mattress   & his flattery
his beggared silver sword & her   deflected wound

Between the old has-been   & his all-wet twin bed
between the Queen of Beats   [a nothing there Will comes]--
& to the blinkered soul   a something sweet & red
a sky-burnt fire truck   or   handkerchief of plums

& in the savage dark   one scandalized blue lamb
one jacknife dove unfolds   & whispers float--   _I am..._



73

The wind blows through the tops of the pine trees.
Sound of things   passing into the invisible.
Above   their endless   dark green      constellation
the North Star turns   eternally,   invincible.

I was your slave, she said.
Where the obscure selves   cross   into the deep freeze.
On salvation road   through the valley of slivers.
& her voice   became silver   on the point of a sword.

Ding - dong
the dark wind   & the rain
(heart,   petalled   on a spine   of steel,   rose
once again

into the dark green constellation,   graven where
low broken lives might   find your heaven)

		

74

The star shines in the barrel now   outside your court,
Earth is harder now,   incarnate truth
grows saltier,   more real.   I won't be Hamlet
going back to Elsinore,   or naked   writhe

with David   by the ark   outside Jerusalem--
but in Firenze,   on my knees   outside the _Instituto
Henry Gould_   where you sought refuge once:   a lamb
when I   a wolf   had left   your island road

                     *

& when this rusty orb comes round,
they'll find me   Henry   numbered

marble   begging for forgiveness there
from you   & from the flagrant Lord
of Florentine   pine-scented air



75

                        _to E.S._


In a dream, we walked hand in hand   through Petersburg.
You held a black silk parasol   to shade the sun
a russet scarf   around your neck   the surge
of ocean checked   & mated   sweetly done

by stone   & curving banks   & tender light,
newborn.   This dream   (frail-woven, swaying
pattern)   floats through dusk...   lighthearted leafboat,
whispered through the channel   of my costly clay.

I woke & saw   the shadow of a goldfinch
disappearing overhead.   & so   I send you
cardinal   this blue-green valentine,   launched
in a bathtub ship   called _Sophie_--   since I know

though parted   by rose-fingered sea   & sinuous time
we never step outside the portals   of Jerusalem

  
                              1.16.97



76

How high we go   who   travel in a shadow!
_Nor will I fear   the arrows of the sun   by day
nor terrors of the night--_   my general best   to show
(as one who sailed to London once) that   inwound RI way.

Sometimes   I think I'm more than halfway there
when swallows tear   across the firmament
& pollen quivers   in the pregnant air
& comely palms exude   an anchored scent--

I think of one   whose 52nd year
revolves around again   a blooming almond staff
& orbic Jubilee--   out of the mournful sere
of autumn-lying earth   a greenish leaf

is born...   a festive lion laughs!   He's
rolling   on that floor   where all his thorns   are chaff!



77

I heard those bells'   high sea-rose call--
five senses   tingled--   my  ten fingers danced
& through a sunken constellation--greenish metal--
came   & planted in my house   your calm expanse.

Low celandine is for the eyes   & pennyroyal
soothes the roiled brow;   Ophelia's rue
floats upon the tide,   & Denmark's rotten apple
rules   by her side   at last   in Hades now.

The earth   instinct with vision   steals away
our term of life (careless carouse or   sensual feast,
unwound)   yet   still   that muffled melody,
that sea-borne stem of   chorded combers,   vast

rolls back to me   (like wind   through anonymous
cedars,   deep   in northern woods)   a woman's voice.



78

                     _root pity in thy heart_


I found a ruddy apple   at the foot of the well
of galaxies   like a slow heartbeat   in the tomb--
a scarlet ornament in   guttered hell or
pampered paradise,   that droned   _I am._

& in disgrace--   disguise of every rude
awakening--   I saw that orb go   shadowed
rolling   ripening   like some   rotund
oration (car or ark?)   around a node

or hedge   of angles--   prism ship, or   plane
icon of human inclination--   very
scored   with wrinkles,   moods & frowns,
--& yet   miraculously ordinary!

--The finder of the gold I've stolen here
shall have my book & staff   (I'll let you steer).



79

London awaits the   latest buried man,
unlettered still,   to have them all in stitches 
lionize   the iris of   spotlight sunshine   thrown down
ticker tape   handkerchiefs &   broken watches.

& so   green stars are shining   over every metropole
& you   entranced with tidal roses   & applause
play mother's part, & chase    your favorite nightingale--
a golden globe, the   apple of your eye [Ecclesiastes].

Remember then   our intercepted breeze
went whispering through   the broken silver mine;
casket of apple blooms,   lilies   fettered   snowpeas
bathed us--O   terrestrial,   & Caroline--

for Charlie Gould   was not yet 29
when he was finished   --by his own icon!



80

Bells ring as the days move toward spring now,
& bear the canker & the rose   in high noon's pentagon
of pulsing screed:   of comfort & despair
O   world   world   world   flow on,   flow on

flow on,   flow on   into the calendar--
sweet faded arbors   &   Ophelia's crown
have branched   a branded, flickering undertow
toward Jubilee.   O fearful provocation--

sundered veil!   Poor pinioned corners
bare   the harshest knife, & still   your balm
exfolds --O   silvered   Silencer!
& in the concord of   one star,   one palm

your Kosmos   mirrored now   engulfed in rest
combs,   in green isles,   your Love's   grave   crest.


                              1.17.97




81   His Toy Takes Off


19...   all systems hnefatafl go.
Square one. Fold up   your golden RI game.
2 seconds now. Venice to Sutton Hoo.
Way over fatal Henry's   phantom fame

[no sugar now] the stars   concrete   & ever-same
irrigate a mirror image,   balanced
on an orange   L-shaped   gyroscheme.
& Leo halo = mass x horizon event [entranced].

Binary,   buried men & buoyant   coffins
make a comeback now   on scaffold stage--
barbarians   go Dutch   in paper gondolas,
& somber subway harmonies   ring for the page

whose queen translates   my thorny hide & seek
& saved my life   just   for a new song's sake.

82   Henry's Footnotes

            _Everything is safe underground._
                  --James Pritchard, archaeologist
                    NY Times obituary page, 1.19.97


Obit.   Essential outlines &   whitewash.
Summa of your summer's   wanton   burden,
outward walls--   & pines within   to ash.
_Thy body's end_   by   _terms divine_

High noon.   Toothpick.   Hung there
melted like wax   _a  multitude of the isles
were glad thereof_ --buy   clerical shares
in _my main book_ --a constitutional   disguise.

Philip Sperling, 85...   _Rare Books._
Mary Bancroft...   _Spy in World War II._
James Pritchard, _Archaeologist...   at 87._

You vault to safety,   Luba   like spring
on tightrope--or   a pseudospy (without a string).



83

      _Yet seem'd it winter still, and you away,
      As with your shadow I with these did play._


The universe   in teeming unison   intones the
_silken, skilled_   refigurement   of slandered
scandal--   harps begotten victory   above my bones'
corral   o.k.   she's deep vermilion-fevered

now...   prescriptions   lays   sweet smells & figures
of delight   [& trumpets also]   _let the sea
make noise   floods clap their hands_   O   marvelous
April!   your groined alphabet   engraves my clay:

Hibernian sheep checkmate   the rugged ground,
high cupolas   pinprick   dogwoods, lagoons,
your   constellate goodwill--flowering almond--
scents the New Year's air:   runes, vessels, premonitions. . .

& like a cardinal   in a cured ribcage
my carol   springs from winter's branches--age to age.



84   Henry's 13th Forward Violet Recital

                        _...from age to age._


I will be sing-song sowing one thing now's
though cunning winds   don'ts augur very well
for corporate gondolas or   rust-fed plows
in a waiter's world...   & yet   one rose from hell

climbs up the podium--one pied-palm scrawl
centers yourn yon   maple syruppity   Milky Way:
aye   there was a kindly man, whose   whole
wheat handshakes   put us in the black   today.

It's raining Newport stars...   a couple--Big Bear
& Little Bear--   & one   to navigate   &
circle up   stray astral flocks--that   yet prepare
height's thronging   dogwood crown--   inaugurate

one   sober   _nostos_   unison of   splintered   strife
fled sea-grave   prisms grant   transhuman life.


                              1.20.97



85

                  O go your way into his gates


My bones   yes   my bones were   in the coral
under winter water's   scandal sheet--
my herbs were stoned,   prescriptions   oral--a
textbook exhibit A,   mispoisoned, &   completely.

Diz   aster.   O kingly vassal!   Borrowed
almonds   rootless apples   blood-tombed Eric
in the clay. A   brown emotion. All   undertowed.
Palm fleeced in shade. A   gnarled mold.

O feeble-hearted...   --April--scent-benign-intensity!
Your anagram...   --the sun--the sun!
Light like...   a crooked knife is--blinding me!
& who is she?   Dark outline--in the gateway--graven

shade--   palm-leaf trowel in her hand--   a pilot?
Gardener? Who steals--delirious--   me from my plot?



86   His Veteran Hardtack

I was headstoned--unnoticed bit o'mortuary.
Some summer's bored Morton, gloomed in the den--
unfired. Unlocked the safety--vault--it was scary!
Unperfect sage launched by bent bluesmen

into a dishrag black abyss.   Barely,
I say, W.   Uneven S.   Sideways,
sidewinded   lolling   April   cot   untimely
wild   unkelsoned, intecinerated...   haze

princess!   Dark winding of your spring-
fed compost revolved a stuffed fella
my way--a secret truant, or sting-
adhesive band-aid chorister whose A

preceded the sea--with insufficiency! My
heart to sway--say--quick--link onto the lee!



87   His Pen Pal's Alias

Well I was roamin like a soldier   through upside town
with my poignard compagnard   just give her the slip
rollin bombed under my part-nobler macintosh   right on
Professor   I dont mean nothin officer   (your garbage-ship)

Anyways I felt kinda nappy   lowering the boom   yon gypsy
crawlers good enough for a snow drudge   I seize her
by her cop-colored copycat hair   do I   see
I dont mean no harm   you get my drift   Marie Grays

my loverstrangler   no weekend-steamin jailbird time for me
To go on puke-mulin please I says to her--what your name?
Suspect she was   pullin my knife says   --Alienavel (whee!)
Nostrowoman or somethin--   Yeah!   what kinda clam?

Claim she serve a years line-up time less one   a thief man
I tell you   mistaken i.d. No! believe me!   I just ran!



88-89   Doing Double-Time + 1

As small trees emerge from the darkness   so
I wanted to anchor your hope   with a mother poem
& as the voice of   one of the daughters of J2 goes
steering across a never-never mirror   home

beneath the memories   I wanted that star   at last
where it belongs   in UNION with   my shivering heart.
I'm cold   iced eyes are eyeing us   the mast
is burning 3 springs back   I cannot write no more

& yet your calm   queen-star-spangled fingers   fly,
& satisfy my mouth   (that is but dust & grass)
with eagles' fare,   token   of your vast   pacific sky--
have wrung deep oaths   your kingdom come   to pass

into the hands of children   this long gift
may come to mean   what it was meant to be

& from the sceptered greenhouse   there might drift

a glory   glory   hallelujah   victory
go ricochet--   new-minted   pennyroyal frisbee   -- swift

cardinal draft   afloat   upon flushed chambers now:
high ceiling   lofted with   the midnight sun
Lenore on carpet ride   &   Poe in tow
a winged   clay fireboat museum--   hurricane--

& Hamlet's maiden voyage   waxed for snow
will hang there,   pensively,   & mimic you (turning
ample   apple   pear-shaped   seedling choir,
& ringing   curving out of sight)--   the river far below

where,   garnering the dust   (so evident, so visual)
the summer mansions pulled us   both upstairs,
& fire-trees   storked us free at last,   & all
sheepdog creation woofed   my deep-dyed,   wide-warped airs.





V. Scattered Bells & Whistles

            *****

90 

            _i.m. Henry Darger_

I've wrapped a rubber car-rack strap (like a winebarrel)
around the splitting dogwood now, so it might survive.
Here in Providence, like many an average middling burg,
you sort of, you know, make do with what you have.

Midwinter spring is its own season. But
we haven't had much snow here anyway this year--&
it's not as though that's going to make us all jump for joy.
In fact some of us could have just come from the morgue.

Why that is--I'll tell you the reason.
In this little town we all look vaguely familiar--
but not _so_ familiar that we're gonna hail-fellow-well-
met everybody! Which foot forward? We're never quite sure.

It's just a local variation on the _principle of the shroud._
We're in disguise. It rains a lot. We're under a constant cloud.


                              _Providence
                              1.20.97_ 



91

My web's afloat now, nude   sans string theory
& though I can't see where I'm going in this cloud
it's pebbled in the quantum foam--down to 10 -40.
It might even be visible someday (out loud).

These partial masks we wear--abhor--applaud
donned quickly for each grandest late finale
are portioned from a general evening shroud.
Odds are we're gypsies all--beyond the pale.

One--a regal Russian poet-son (of Riga leather man).
Two--a frank Swede belle from Algiers (alias Luba).
(Floats pas-de-deux with Ballets Russes.) (--Can, can!).
Three--that flautist Henry (plays the tuba)--he

whose ALMA now  canoed across (aquamarine)
a warm canal  lame ticker-time  has never been.



92   Henry's Baker (Chet)

            _stay and we'll make   each day   a Valentine's Day_


Touring through Holland   one more time   you fell
from a window   like an evening angel   emptied out
into the valley of the blues   (this well
of the horizon   filled with your   lost trumpet).

Your craggy face   was hollowed   long before
dragged from the harem   to the heroin
--quarters tossed   halfway to 88s--   the score
is nothing-not-nothing   (future-has-been).

My funny Valentine   her face has changed,
her hair   it's still the same   melodic thread
(your bread & wine)   & it is so arranged
we never leave--   the river   flows ahead

into heart's mournful gulf   &   stays, sustains
your   veiled demise   with victory   & peace.



93

               _You're handsome, ominous..._


I ken your anonymous osmosis.
Muzak crowds rush bingo hall,
gun mall. & tardy kitten Cisco

says: Hell I dunno what it's all.
Red Flag on that Huey over Frisco.
&, &   dud birds on the aerial.

Who's that masked mannikin?
What? _Too loud in here!_
Now where did Ken go? Hide seekin?

Where?
Obituary of an X. Canned.
Is Wanda over there

by the process--Aisle? Cheese?
             *
Jeez, Louise!



94

In the last island   of his Lenten mind
in that gray London   of his final shroud
with snow upon his heart   John Donne

had glimpsed   a razor's lucid   edge--of
winter sunlight--&   feathered down his page:

_Hell's bruise   & heaven's laws   are wise
& in the halls rose all   in willing praise   &
hills wells skies walls holes--all ways--always
will pause to hear   my sighs   &   tolling bells_

& setting down his pen   slowly   at last
his heart   still balanced   between strife & rest

like Prospero   when his dear ding-dong play was done
rose from his island bed   & praised    out loud 
Love's wonders--once so lost   & now   at last   rewon.



95   His Parable

The  Chosen One   after all that he'd been through
was lying still--   & sirens wailed,   & silver bowls
were melted down   & the Garden,   the Garden turned blue.
The mournful town was   filled   with sheepdog howls.

& when the Magdalen   with green-eyed glance
rolled back the stone &   let a blade of light
break in   He was confused--dazed by the trance--&
wondered who He was--&   whether it was right

that she advance   & touching,   lift his arm
across her shoulder   (there   in the dank darkness).
But soon her eyes (like ruby lamps)   glowed warm
& on his lips   she burned a mordant   morning kiss

& said   _I am your servant   Mary,   here
to wake you now--   rise up!   & be my valiant--volunteer!_


                              _Prospect Park
                              1.22.97_



96

There is no salvation   for the dirty deeds
of plunder   treachery   & greed. The land's
not ours   nor worthy of its smallest seeds
are we. The blood is on our hands.

Still   a fleeting gypsy blessing might redeem
innocent children from the general's curse
& serve as model toward   a better scheme
for our rude ways &   late benighted manners:

I'm thinking of (once more)   one hearty pioneer
whose bark's capacious sail,   so purposeful
set free the civitas--shrouded   his clear-
eyed friend   Canonicus   in his best-woven shawl--

& closed   those regal lamps   that spied his own--
escorting him   with eagle feathers   to his town.



97

My early years are winding down   spirals
canal   O   lead me   river   to that sweet
shy   lock   of your   Italian walls,   &
set me in   your gong-sent   gondola-casket.

I have not seen   those verdant   smoky domes--
dove-hearted   Bogota--   those   roseate peaks
& sheer-strung crevices   inset   with palms, &
spires   uprisen   high   in playful pinks--

& yet   collegial petals can   play Roma too--
& loop the loop into...   --that gulf of roses,
buried   in my chest   might   grant you     
amorous fortitude!   & winestained poses!--as

dancers   (rising to   their constellated task)   quick
check their mates   & soar--right through the mask.



98   Henry's Fake Book (out-takes)

                        _...my one and only love._


Every thought of you   the veritable heart shakes
Soar, &   showers my paired dice high--O hell it's low--
But then I'll take a chance & say   goodby's   hel-lo...

                     *
Dawn shadows fall   & spread their misty day,   a-
Carolling   sweet red & blue,   & gre-en matchsticks, too--

Jaybirds & larks & stars   might sing a ding-a
Ling ling ling   but still my   aching heart

99   from H.Q.   Re: Final Report

    Glancing over her sunlit shoulder, Dr. Louise Chan U.N. Littletree  
(the arch-geologist) virtually blinked a  moment in astonishment when
she noticed--lying in an anomalous, undistinguished corner of the
Soberlost Dig Project potshed--a small sherd of blacquered Arpeggian
cupware, datable not earlier than circa 1386 B.C.E. [...] "Whoa!" she
shouted, just as Melrose the mule was about to pulverize the precious
relic with his iron-shod left back toe. Melrose, fortunately,
desisted--and as a result, we have the following inscription
(transfigured into angles by Prof. Wedgeworth Crease):
