Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ Good evening, I'm Michel Kassett. This is Network 23. A couple of weeks ³Û
Û³ ago we had a program on the subject of AIDS, addressing the question of ³Û
Û³ whether AIDS -- the AIDS virus -- was created by the government; and I'm³Û
Û³ sure that some people were quite shocked by what they heard. We spent   ³Û 
Û³ that entire program relating to you the evidence of a very substantial  ³Û
Û³ amount of factual evidence which supports the proposition that AIDS is a³Û
Û³ synthetic biological agent that was deliberately engineered by the US   ³Û
Û³ government as an medical instrument for depopulation. This is by far the³Û
Û³ most controversial and dangerous subject that we have ever addressed on ³Û
Û³ this program, so I would like to review briefly the major points -- the ³Û
Û³ most significant pieces of evidence -- that I presented two weeks ago.  ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ The first point was that in the early 1970's, Henry Kissinger wrote a   ³Û
Û³ top secret document -- a National Security Memorandum ("NSM 200") -- in ³Û
Û³ which he indicated that "depopulation should be the highest priority of ³Û
Û³ US foreign policy towards the Third World." This Memorandum which can be³Û
Û³ obtained from the US National Archives, which was only declassified very³Û
Û³ quietly in 1990 and adopted by the National Security Council as official³Û
Û³ US foreign policy towards the Third World. Now this is a classic example³Û
Û³ of the "secret government" in action, because none of this was known to ³Û
Û³ the Congress, and certainly it was not known to the American people. Did³Û
Û³ any of you know that depopulation was considered a matter of US national³Û
Û³ security? Did any of you know that for the past 20 years, depopulation  ³Û
Û³ was the highest long range priority of the US foreign policy towards the³Û
Û³ Third World? No you didn't, because it was classified - it was a secret.³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ I would like to read for you just a piece of this document. It's written³Û
Û³ by Henry Kissinger:                                                     ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ "Reduction of the rate of population in these States is of vital US     ³Û
Û³ national security." [National Security Memorandum, Henry Kissinger]     ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ And we even have a map of those areas in which Kissinger indicates where³Û
Û³ depopulation would be desirable. It's all Third World countries -- it's ³Û
Û³ all brown people and yellow people, of course.                          ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ "The US economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals   ³Û
Û³ from abroad, especially from less developed countries. That fact gives  ³Û
Û³ the US enhanced interests in the political, economic & social stability ³Û
Û³ of the supplying countries. Wherever a lessening of the population can  ³Û
Û³ increase the prospects for such stability, population policy becomes    ³Û
Û³ relevant to resources, supplies and to the economic interests of the    ³Û
Û³ United States." [National Security Memorandum, Henry Kissinger]         ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ Now, when Kissinger says "economic interests of the United States..." he³Û
Û³ means the interests of US corporations, which are in fact, multinational³Û
Û³ corporations with no loyalty to this country whatsoever. NSM 200, unlike³Û
Û³ other government documents on the subject, outlined "international and  ³Û
Û³ political and economic implications of population growth..." rather than³Û
Û³ its ecological or sociological aspects. We have been saying all along,  ³Û
Û³ the New World Order is one of a business and the US Government is in the³Û
Û³ business of business.                                                   ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ Now, the next document was from the US Senate Library. It is a record of³Û
Û³ the Appropriations Hearing that was held in July of 1969, where the     ³Û
Û³ Department of the Army specifically requested and received 10 million to³Û
Û³ develop "a synthetic biological agent that would impair or destroy the  ³Û
Û³ human immune system." This is from the US Senate Library. We also made  ³Û
Û³ reference to several published articles of the World Health Organization³Û
Û³ ,written about the same time, which advocated similar kinds of research ³Û
Û³ toward the development of "a hybrid virus that could selectively effect ³Û
Û³ the human immune system."                                               ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ Like it not, these documents all exist. The Kissinger Memorandum, the   ³Û
Û³ Army Appropriations Hearing, and the articles from the World Health     ³Û
Û³ Organization; these are official records -- facts of history -- that    ³Û
Û³ can not be disputed.                                                    ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ We also pointed out a very incredible coincidence, that The World Health³Û
Û³ Organization went into Central Africa in 1972 -- into an area that is   ³Û
Û³ known as the "AIDS Belt" -- and administered a smallpox vaccination to  ³Û
Û³ several thousand Africans. This event was followed immediately by the   ³Û
Û³ first outbreak of AIDS on this planet -- a remarkable coincidence - that³Û
Û³ was noted as a Front Page Headline in the London Times, but has never   ³Û
Û³ been published in the US Media -- never even mentioned.                 ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ Another startling fact that was never mentioned in the mainstream media,³Û 
Û³ was the Hepatitis B Vaccine that was given to several thousand male     ³Û
Û³ homosexuals in New York and San Francisco in 1978. The fact is, every   ³Û 
Û³ single person who received that vaccine contracted AIDS -- every single ³Û
Û³ one of them - without exception. That is what the first American victims³Û
Û³ of AIDS had in common. They were receivers of the Hepatitis B Vaccine.  ³Û
Û³ It is a documented fact. AIDS began in America in 1978 in the homosexual³Û
Û³ communities of New York and San Francisco ,this immediately following   ³Û
Û³ a government-sponsored program of Hepatitis B Vaccinations. This is all ³Û
Û³ completely documented -- it is all completely true.                     ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ In our first program, we made many references to material that you can  ³Û
Û³ and should read, such as the Strecker Memorandum by Dr. Robert Strecker.³Û
Û³ Another work called "Who Murdered Africa" by Dr. William Douglas. And an³Û
Û³ incredible book called "A Higher Form of Killing," which documents over ³Û
Û³ 500 specific cases of biological experimentation by our government on an³Û
Û³ unsuspecting public. If you don't think they do "that kind of thing" you³Û
Û³ are simply uninformed.                                                  ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ We also read you an official government report from the Royal Society of³Û
Û³ Medicine in Great Britain in which they state unequivocally that "saliva³Û
Û³ and blood are vastly more infectious than genital secretions," and "that³Û
Û³ AIDS meets none of the criterion of a venereal disease. That despite the³Û
Û³ misrepresentations of the American Medical Establishment and also the US³Û
Û³ Government, AIDS isn't primarily a sexually transmitted disease." All of³Û
Û³ that according to the Royal Society of Medicine in Great Britain. That's³Û
Û³ a document that we have and we'll come back to it in just a moment.     ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ We also shared with you information and opinions from many very highly- ³Û
Û³ respected physicians, like Dr. Robert Strecker, Dr. William Douglas, Dr.³Û
Û³ Cantwell, Dr. Hazeltine, Dr. Alonso, who all agree that the AIDS virus  ³Û
Û³ could never have occurred spontaneously in Nature. That animal viruses  ³Û
Û³ cannot jump species as we are being told they did, as we are being asked³Û
Û³ to believe happened -- when allegedly, a green monkey bit an African and³Û
Û³ precipitated the pandemic of AIDS. We know as a scientific fact that    ³Û
Û³ viruses cannot jump species, unless they are specifically engineered to ³Û
Û³ do so. And we also know for a scientific fact that the AIDS virus bears ³Û
Û³ no resemblance whatsoever to any virus ever found in a green monkey, but³Û
Û³ does bear a total resemblance to cow virus and sheep virus, which have  ³Û
Û³ somehow been bonded together. The only possible way these two different ³Û
Û³ species of virus could bond together would be in a laboratory, something³Û
Û³ engineered in a laboratory -- and then further engineered to make the   ³Û
Û³ jump into a human system.                                               ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ We talked about the Laws of Virology, which state that for every case of³Û
Û³ infection -- viral infection -- that is known and reported, there are 99³Û
Û³ cases that are unknown and unreported. This means if we have 200,000    ³Û
Û³ known cases of AIDS virus, then there are 20 million right behind it.   ³Û
Û³ 20 million Americans who are HIV positive and do not know it. We also   ³Û
Û³ shared quotes from several doctors who believe that the HIV infection   ³Û
Û³ rate has reached approximately 100 million people on the Continent of   ³Û
Û³ Africa; 30 to 50 million in Asia; and no less than 20 million in the US.³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ Again, the Laws of Virology will state that the rate of infection for a ³Û
Û³ retrovirus, like the (retro) AIDS virus... the rate of infection will   ³Û
Û³ double approximately every 12 months. Another frightening fact that no  ³Û
Û³ one has bothered to tell us, is that there are six different basic types³Û
Û³ of the AIDS virus, and that each of these basic types, being what is    ³Û
Û³ called a "recombinant retrovirus," has a recombinant potential of 9,000 ³Û
Û³ to the Fourth Power. "Recombinant" means the ability to change and to   ³Û
Û³ recombine into something new, and the calculation 9,000 to the Fourth   ³Û
Û³ Power times 6 is literally in the hundreds of millions of trillions of  ³Û
Û³ different possible forms and manifestations of an AIDS virus. [Note, the³Û
Û³ number calculated is 354,294,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 variations of  ³Û
Û³ the AIDS virus]. Now that would mean that you would need a vaccine for  ³Û
Û³ every possible choice that the virus could make, which is technically   ³Û
Û³ impossible; truthfully, realistically impossible. Its like the influenza³Û
Û³ virus - there's no vaccine. There are simply too many strains of it, too³Û
Û³ many different varieties to ever develop a single comprehensive vaccine.³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ The bottom line? We're not being told the truth about this AIDS. In the ³Û
Û³ words of Dr. Hazeltine in his testimony to Congress: "AIDS is a species ³Û
Û³ threatening disease." Now, I don't want to appear bleak or too hopeless.³Û
Û³ All of these doctors believe that some type of cure is possible but that³Û
Û³ we're going to need a lot more money, and we're going to have to move   ³Û
Û³ beyond the strangle hold of the Medical Establishment -- the AMA. And   ³Û
Û³ since he lives here in Los Angeles, I'm  going to put the number of Dr. ³Û
Û³ Robert Strecker up on the screen, I'm going to flash that number for you³Û
Û³ now. Please put that up, thank you. [213 344-8039]. I urge you to write ³Û
Û³ down this number and make this call. Please call Dr. Strecker. All you  ³Û
Û³ have to do is call, and he will send you information, important critical³Û
Û³ information -- on the subject of AIDS.                                  ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ Alright. About 3 weeks ago we played an excerpt from a speech by Craig  ³Û
Û³ Hulet, and tonight I want to play you something else from that speech   ³Û
Û³ which relates to the subject of AIDS. For those who do not know him,    ³Û
Û³ Hulet was a former advisor to the National Security Council and a former³Û
Û³ consultant to several multi-national corporations, and he has, as they  ³Û
Û³ say; "come in from the cold..." -- he has crossed over and has spent the³Û 
Û³ last 3 or 4 years writing and lecturing on the subject of the New World ³Û
Û³ Order - sharing with everyone who will listen, the breadth and the scope³Û 
Û³ of his knowledge and experience.                                        ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ Mr. Hulet knows first-hand the kind of men who are running the world. He³Û
Û³ knows what they're up to and he is trying to warn us. On this list of   ³Û
Û³ alternative sources of information, which many people are writing in to ³Û
Û³ receive, you know all you have to do is send in a stamped self-addressed³Û
Û³ envelope, and we'll send you one -- the name at the top of this list is ³Û
Û³ Craig Hulet. He is an indispensable connection. So, right now I want to ³Û 
Û³ play for you a small excerpt from a speech that he gave on July 25th at ³Û
Û³ the Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles. His subject was George Bush and the New³Û
Û³ World Order, but at the end of the evening, he was asked a very specific³Û 
Û³ question about AIDS, and this is how he responded:                      ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ "... biological warfare virus by the US Military. Sure... I really hate ³Û
Û³ that subject. You know, we're never, ever going to be able to prove --  ³Û
Û³ Strecker, William Douglas -- we'll never be able to prove that AIDS was ³Û
Û³ developed specifically to reduce the populations of Central Africa, the ³Û
Û³ black inner cities, drug users, prostitutes and homosexuals. But it just³Û
Û³ seems strange to me that all through the 1960's and 1970's, there were  ³Û
Û³ books published; [the] Global 2000 Report to the President, [the] Club  ³Û
Û³ of Rome wrote a book on over-population -- I must have 50 books on over-³Û
Û³ population and the need to get rid of certain large amount of people on ³Û
Û³ the planet. Now they never say which people out to be gotten rid of, but³Û
Û³ it seems a major coincidence that the same people that are starving in  ³Û
Û³ Ethiopia, in the Sudan, are the same people that getting AIDS and dying.³Û
Û³ By the year 2000, they expect 60 million blacks in Central Africa to die³Û
Û³ of AIDS. 60 million! It could be as many as 20 million plus in America. ³Û
Û³ Homosexuals, predominantly, and the interesting thing is, it is not a   ³Û
Û³ homosexual disease. It IS a man-made, mutated disease. It had to have   ³Û
Û³ been man-made. Sheep do not get together and do chemical experiments on ³Û
Û³ their viruses. So, a man had to graft this bovine virus, which they know³Û
Û³ that's what it is, onto a human cell. It had to be made. So we know its ³Û
Û³ man made. They know it's transmitted with the secretions... because they³Û
Û³ know it's the most effective device... the best test to discover if you ³Û
Û³ have AIDS... is not a blood test, it's a saliva test. Now why haven't   ³Û
Û³ they told us that?"                                                     ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ It's not a sexually transmitted disease, it's simply a disease that gets³Û
Û³ transmitted. And you can transmit it by sneezing on someone. Why don't  ³Û
Û³ they tell us that? In the Congressional Record, it says that it can be  ³Û
Û³ transmitted effectively by mosquito. It says so. The Center for Disease ³Û
Û³ Control, in the Congressional Record, says that it is transmitted by    ³Û
Û³ mosquito in Belgrade, Florida -- they know it for a fact. Why haven't   ³Û
Û³ they told us that AIDS is being transmitted by mosquito? They say it to ³Û
Û³ themselves in the Congressional Record, why don't they tell us?         ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ "OK. Here's my theory. Whether or not [AIDS] was created for the purpose³Û
Û³ of exterminating the very same, coincidentally, same anti-social element³Û
Û³ that the men I did business with for 15 or 20 years, though ought to be ³Û
Û³ gotten rid of anyway; homosexuals, prostitutes, blacks, etc., and of    ³Û
Û³ course, the Black Continent - they want the resources but they certainly³Û
Û³ don't want to feed the people, see? Why is that they are allowing all of³Û
Û³ these myths to be told, the destruction to take place, and they're doing³Û
Û³ nothing to stop it? Heres my theory, and this is all it is - is a theory³Û
Û³ -- that they'll find a cure when about 1 billion people on this planet  ³Û
Û³ have died from AIDS, starvation and disease - all over the world, all of³Û
Û³ a sudden Eli Lilly, one of the major corporations doing AIDS research   ³Û
Û³ -- and coincidentally, George Bush's on the Board of Eli Lilly -- when  ³Û
Û³ they finally eliminate huge sections of the population, what they always³Û
Û³ wanted throughout the 1960's and 1970's, because of over-population,    ³Û
Û³ -- it's called "mitigating the problem." They feel that AIDS and famine ³Û
Û³ and disease will mitigate the problem of over-population. I suspect that³Û
Û³ around the year 2010 or so, all of a sudden Eli Lilly will announce that³Û
Û³ they've found a phenomenal cure, but not until a lot of good people die.³Û
Û³ Because like I said, it's a major coincidence to me that the very same  ³Û
Û³ people, the men I did business with for years, dislike the most, those  ³Û
Û³ people who just happen to be the ones that are contracting AIDS, happens³Û
Û³ to be some of the ones that are dying in famines, pestilence and bombing³Û
Û³ into the Stone Age like we just did. I don't believe in the "Coincidence³Û
Û³ Theory of History" - I just don't. I haven't for a long time because the³Û
Û³ CIA, the National Security Council is too brilliantly planned. They plan³Û
Û³ everything to the most minute detail. I can't believe all of this is a  ³Û
Û³ coincidence. That's all I can say though."                              ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ I'm going to do a White Paper on that one of these days. One of the main³Û
Û³ reasons I haven't is that if you talk about AIDS, you never get invited ³Û
Û³ on the university campus -- you follow me? So I never address AIDS...for³Û
Û³ years I've had material on AIDS that addresses this in some fundamental ³Û
Û³ way, and some of it was very good documentation, proving some of the    ³Û
Û³ things that I just said, but I have never discussed it because if you   ³Û 
Û³ discuss the subject of AIDS, I guarantee, you will never be a speaker   ³Û
Û³ on the university campuses." [Craig Hulet]                              ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ Once again, I want to say that even though it may not be proved in any  ³Û 
Û³ "absolute" sense, because absolute proof is impossible in a relative    ³Û
Û³ universe, and that's one of the tricks of the cynic or the skeptic, is  ³Û
Û³ that they demand absolute proof, knowing full well theres no such thing ³Û
Û³ as absolute proof, there is only evidence and a certain point you make a³Û
Û³ decision on the basis of the evidence, you make a decision which becomes³Û
Û³ your belief -- on the basis of the evidence. So, on the basis of the    ³Û
Û³ evidence, it is my belief and is my conviction at a very deep level that³Û
Û³ AIDS was deliberately created and then implemented by the United States ³Û      
Û³ Government, more specifically by certain individuals, most notably Henry³Û
Û³ Kissinger, Brent Scowcroft and George Herbert Walker Bush, who was the  ³Û
Û³ Director of the CIA at that time, when the Kissinger Memorandum was     ³Û
Û³ adopted by the National Security Council. I can't prove it absolutely,  ³Û
Û³ by I personally believe that Bush was deeply involved - a major player -³Û
Û³ particularly in the implementation of this epidemic. There's an article ³Û
Û³ in the LA Times yesterday that says "Bush Defends AIDS Budget" & "urges ³Û
Û³ behavioral changes." There was a protest demonstration in Kennebunkport,³Û
Û³ Maine -- the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power marched through the tiny   ³Û
Û³ downtown area of Kennebunkport. Bush criticized the gay activists for   ³Û
Û³ "hurting holiday business" in this picturesque New England resort, for  ³Û
Û³ "hurting holiday business."                                             ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ Note (this is Bush talking)"To the degree the message hits some merchant³Û
Û³ in Kennebunkport, on the best weekend possible, and caused them to close³Û
Û³ their doors, I got that part of it, and I didn't like it." This is one  ³Û
Û³ cold reptile. He goes on to say "You know why they were here. I know why³Û
Û³ they were here. They were here because you all are here," said the Ex-  ³Û
Û³ President to the White House Press Corp. "There here because they can   ³Û
Û³ get television coverage, and to some degree, print coverage, because the³Û
Û³ Ex-President happened to be at home."                                   ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ You see, he is contemptuous, he is contemptuous of the people that have ³Û
Û³ this disease. A spokesperson for the demonstrators said that most of    ³Û
Û³ Bush's AIDS policy has gone into research on AZT, a drug that they said,³Û
Û³ at best, can only slow the progression of the disease. It's like junk   ³Û
Û³ food for viruses. As Hulet just said, they don't want to stop it, it's  ³Û
Û³ "mitigating the problem," it's getting rid of the undesirables. When    ³Û
Û³ asked what he thought should be done about the AIDS crisis, Bush said;  ³Û
Û³ "I'm in favor of behavioral change."                                    ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ Now what's the subtext? What is he saying here? He's speaking to his 80%³Û 
Û³ constituency, telling them what they want to hear, and he is saying that³Û
Û³ basically AIDS is caused by immoral behavior, immoral sexual behavior   ³Û
Û³ or immoral drug use. He knows that's a lie, but he is a liar, so what do³Û
Û³ you expect. He's a master of deception. He was in on it, I have no doubt³Û
Û³ whatsoever.                                                             ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ We said we were going to return this document. "The House of Common"(s) ³Û 
Û³ Social Services Committee, and this is a document prepared by the Royal ³Û
Û³ Society of Medicine. You can not get more official than this in Great   ³Û
Û³ Britain. And this is what they say:                                     ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ "The scale of deceptions and misinformation perpetrated by all of the   ³Û
Û³ virologists, clinicians and editors of scientific and medical journals  ³Û
Û³ about the infectivity of genital secretions, compared with that of blood³Û
Û³ and saliva has been astonishing. In the presence of a new, lethal virus,³Û
Û³ spreading amongst people for which no vaccine or cure is in sight, every³Û
Û³ person would assume that scientists have been working day and night to  ³Û
Û³ verify how it is transmitted. On the contrary, having assumed for a     ³Û
Û³ variety of motives that AIDS is a sexually transmitted disease like     ³Û
Û³ syphilis or gonorrhea, a negligible research effort has gone into the   ³Û
Û³ critical matter of transmission. A few preliminary papers were published³Û
Û³ and the findings have been repeatedly quoted as showing the opposite of ³Û
Û³ what they actually showed. When this was pointed out in letters to the  ³Û
Û³ editors of US medical and scientific journals, publication has been     ³Û
Û³ refused. No attempt has been made to check or double-check the findings ³Û
Û³ in other laboratories, or to rectify published errors."                 ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ "As far as it goes, the tiny research effort into infectivity of bodily ³Û 
Û³ fluids indicates that saliva is far more infectious than the genital    ³Û
Û³ secretions, but that blood is vastly more infectious than either.       ³Û
Û³ Consequently, the idea that condoms can have any significant effect on  ³Û
Û³ the spread of AIDS in a nation is utterly preposterous."                ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û

Û³ Governments all over the world are spending millions of pounds [dollars]³Û

Û³ You know, if they're going to spend millions of your tax dollars on the ³Û
Û³ televised warnings, don't you think they mention about cuts and wounds  ³Û
Û³ and saliva and breathing it into the lungs, which apparently happens -- ³Û
Û³ 16,000 health care workers are infected by AIDS. Ask them. Ask the ones ³Û
Û³ who believe their superiors at the AMA about the costs of ignorance. You³Û

Û³ There are two things about the biological agent field I would like to   ³Û
Û³ mention. One is the possibility of technological surprise. Molecular    ³Û
Û³ biology is a field that is advancing very rapidly and eminent biologists³Û
Û³ believe that within a period of 5 to 10 years it would be possible to   ³Û

Û³ Dramatic progress being made in the field of molecular biology led us   ³Û
Û³ to investigate the relevance of this field of science to biological     ³Û
Û³ warfare. A group of experts considered this matter and provided the     ³Û
Û³ following observations:                                                 ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ 1. All biological agents up to the present time are representatives of  ³Û
Û³    naturally occurring disease, and are thus known by scientists        ³Û
Û³    throughout the world. They are easily available to qualified         ³Û
Û³    scientists for research, either for offensive or defensive purposes. ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ 2. Within the next 5 to 10 years, it would be possible to make a new    ³Û
Û³    infective microorganism which could differ in certain important      ³Û
Û³    aspects from any known disease causing organisms. Most important of  ³Û
Û³    these is that it might be refractory to the immunological and        ³Û
Û³    therapeutic processes upon which we depend to maintain our relative  ³Û
Û³    freedom from infectious disease.                                     ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ 3. A research program to explore the feasibility of this could be       ³Û 
Û³    completed in approximately 5 years at a total cost of $10 million.   ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ 4. It would be very difficult to establish such a program. Molecular    ³Û 
Û³    biology is a relatively new science. There are not many highly       ³Û
Û³    competent scientists in the field, almost all are in university      ³Û
Û³    laboratories and they are generally adequately supported from sources³Û
Û³    other that DOD. However, it was considered possible to initiate an   ³Û
Û³    adequate program through the National Academy of Sciences - National ³Û
Û³    Research Council (NAS-NRC).                                          ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ The matter was discussed with the NAS-NRC, and tentative plans were made³Û 
Û³ to initiate the program. However, with decreasing funds in CB, growing  ³Û
Û³ criticism of the CB program, and our reluctance to involve the NAS-NRC  ³Û
Û³ in such a controversial endeavor have led us to postpone it for the past³Û 
Û³ 2 years.                                                                ³Û

Û³ It is a highly controversial issue and there are many who believe such  ³Û
Û³ research should not be undertaken lest it lead to yet another method of ³Û 
Û³ massive killing of large populations. On the other hand, without the    ³Û
Û³ scientific knowledge that such a weapon is possible and an understanding³Û
Û³ of the ways it could be done, there is little that can be done to devise³Û
Û³ defensive measures should an enemy develop it there is little doubt this³Û
Û³ is an important area of potential military technological inferiority in ³Û
Û³ which there is no adequate research program.                            ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û

Û³ research, CANCER is still with us, the second major cause of death in   ³Û
Û³ America.                                                                ³Û

Û³ Thank you for requesting this information. We have a story to tell you, ³Û
Û³ a very strange story, one that affects you, me, and every other human   ³Û
Û³ being on earth. A story that must be taken seriously by the governments ³Û
Û³ of every nation in the world because there may not be many humans left  ³Û
Û³ to govern by the turn of the century, or shortly thereafter. A story so ³Û
Û³ bizarre, and so sinister that, if it were not for the fact that it is   ³Û
Û³ all true, it would make a great science fiction thriller. Interestingly ³Û
Û³ enough, Lorimar Pictures of Hollywood has purchased the rights to Dr.   ³Û
Û³ Strecker's life story.                                                  ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ The story begins in 1983 with Dr. Robert B. Strecker, M.D., Ph.D. Dr.   ³Û
Û³ Strecker practices internal medicine and gastroenterology in Los        ³Û
Û³ Angeles. He is a trained pathologist and he also holds a Ph.D. in       ³Û
Û³ pharmacology. Dr. Strecker and his brother, Ted, an attorney, were      ³Û
Û³ preparing a proposal for a health maintenance organization (HMO) for    ³Û
Û³ Security Pacific Bank of California. They needed to know the long-term  ³Û
Û³ financial effects of insuring and treating AIDS patients. In as much as ³Û
Û³ this information was not readily available in 1983, both brothers began ³Û
Û³ researching the medical literature to learn what they could about this  ³Û
Û³ relatively new disease. The information they uncovered right from the   ³Û
Û³ beginning was so startling to them, so hard to believe, that it would   ³Û
Û³ dramatically alter both their lives and lead them on a five year quest  ³Û
Û³ culminating with the creation of "The Strecker Memorandum," the most    ³Û
Û³ controversial video tape of our time, and a remarkable set of documents ³Û
Û³ called "The Bioattack Alert."                                           ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³                           WHAT THEY DISCOVERED                          ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ Right there in the medical literature for anyone to read for themselves ³Û
Û³ was, basically, proof that the AIDS virus and pandemic was actually     ³Û
Û³ PREDICTED years ago by a world famous virologist, among others. They    ³Û
Û³ found that top scientists writing in the Bulletin of the World Health   ³Û
Û³ Organization were actually REQUESTING that AIDS like viruses be created ³Û
Û³ to study the effects on humans. In fact, the Streckers had unearthed    ³Û
Û³ thousands of documents all supporting the manmade origin of AIDS virus. ³Û
Û³ Meanwhile, the government was telling everyone that a green monkey in   ³Û
Û³ Africa bit some native and started AIDS. As their research continued,   ³Û
Û³ it became obvious from the documentation that the virus itself was not  ³Û
Û³ only created as requested, but actually DEPLOYED, and now threatens the ³Û
Û³ existence of mankind because it does what it was designed to do: cause  ³Û
Û³ cancer in humans via a contagious virus. Eventually the Streckers came  ³Û
Û³ to realize everything the government, the so-called AIDS experts and    ³Û
Û³ media were telling the public was not only misleading, but out and out  ³Û
Û³ lies. The truth of the matter is:                                       ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³                    AIDS is a manmade disease;                           ³Û

Û³ because you are not gay or promiscuous, or because you are not sexually ³Û

Û³                                                                         ³Û

Û³ The most common misconception being foisted upon us right now concerns  ³Û
Û³ sexually active Americans. We are told that if a man uses a condom the  ³Û
Û³ transference of the deadly virus is virtually eliminated. Nothing could ³Û
Û³ be further from the truth. Of the body fluids that the AIDS virus is    ³Û
Û³ found in, semen is the least. As a matter of fact, in every single study³Û
Û³ ever published on the subject, no one has found a significant amount in ³Û
Û³ anyone's semen. It just isn't there in huge numbers. There is usually   ³Û
Û³ only about one virus per milliliter, a statistically irrelevant amount. ³Û
Û³ One copious ejaculation might produce only one or two viruses. This is  ³Û
Û³ substantiated in the medical literature. But, just for argument's sake, ³Û
Û³ let's say all the medical studies are wrong. Let's pretend that there   ³Û
Û³ are countless millions of AIDS viruses in the ejaculation. Are you aware³Û
Û³ that condoms are riddled with microscopic or larger holes? Studies show ³Û
Û³ that even the smallest holes found in condoms are two to ten times      ³Û
Û³ larger than the AIDS virus. It's like shooting a golf ball through a    ³Û
Û³ basketball hoop. Condoms have not, will not, and cannot prevent AIDS.   ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û

Û³ Fifty thousand Americans have already died because they didn't know the ³Û
Û³ truth about AIDS. Between twelve and fifteen million Americans have     ³Û
Û³ already been infected. One in 60 babies born in New York City is        ³Û
Û³ infected; one in 300 college students in America is infected; one in 20 ³Û
Û³ aliens applying for amnesty is infected, including men, women and       ³Û
Û³ children. These are just some of the facts you are not likely to hear   ³Û
Û³ about from the media.                                                   ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³                          WHY NOT A VIDEO TAPE?                          ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ One of the first things the Streckers did was to try and tell their     ³Û
Û³ medical and legal colleagues what they were finding in the literature.  ³Û
Û³ Some were interested; most were not. Certainly no one was prepared to   ³Û
Û³ risk their professional standing making waves within the establishment. ³Û
Û³ Ted Strecker compiled some of the most damaging documents into a report ³Û
Û³ he called "The Bioalert Attack" and sent it to every Governor of every  ³Û
Û³ state, the President, the VICE-PRESIDENT (now President), the FBI, the  ³Û
Û³ CIA, the NSA, and selected members of Congress. He got a grand total of ³Û
Û³ three replies from three governors; nothing from the government. Both he³Û
Û³ and Dr. Strecker were laughed at and ridiculed at every turn. As an     ³Û
Û³ example, Dr. Strecker told the government in 1985 that virtually every  ³Û
Û³ person testing positive for AIDS would die prematurely and painfully.   ³Û
Û³ The government said that was nonsense. Their figures showed that maybe  ³Û
Û³ ten percent at most would die from the disease. In 1986, the government ³Û
Û³ said maybe 50 percent of those infected would die, in 1987 they said    ³Û
Û³ maybe 75 percent, in 1988 they finally agreed with Dr. Strecker that    ³Û
Û³ AIDS is virtually 100 percent fatal. We could go on with facts Dr.      ³Û
Û³ Strecker unearthed that the "experts" said were wrong and now accepted  ³Û
Û³ as the truth. Dr. Strecker, like a good scientist, submitted paper      ³Û
Û³ after paper with his findings to all the prestigious medical journals   ³Û
Û³ in America. They were refused. He then tried having his findings        ³Û
Û³ published in Europe. Again, closed doors. What to do? Dr. Strecker did  ³Û
Û³ not feel he could take the time from his practice and his research to   ³Û
Û³ write a book. On the other hand, everyone has a TV and now most         ³Û
Û³ households have a video cassette recorder (VCR). The time involved to   ³Û
Û³ make a video is nothing compared to writing a book, and so the video    ³Û
Û³ "The Strecker Memorandum" was created. It was a 96 minutes Video on     ³Û
Û³ the un-suppressed facts about aids. It disputed virtually everything    ³Û
Û³ the American public was being told by the government, the so-called     ³Û
Û³ AIDS experts and the media.                                             ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³                 MUSIC IS NOTHING IF THE AUDIENCE IS DEAF                ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ With the video made, it seemed a simple matter to advertise it and the  ³Û
Û³ world would now become aware of what it was facing, right? WRONG! The   ³Û
Û³ fact that you are even reading about "The Strecker Memorandum" now is   ³Û
Û³ a minor miracle by itself, in as much as TV stations have refused to    ³Û
Û³ advertise it. TV and radio time brokers that sell blocks of commercial  ³Û
Û³ time have refused to sell us time. TV station managers have refused to  ³Û
Û³ even air programs containing interviews with Dr. Strecker. A national   ³Û
Û³ radio network did an interview with a famous talk show host and Dr.     ³Û
Û³ Strecker and then refused to run it. Virtually every big name network   ³Û
Û³ television magazine show and all the syndicated TV interviewers and     ³Û
Û³ talk show hosts have said NO to Dr. Strecker. Big city newspapers will  ³Û
Û³ not take any print ads telling about it, and so it goes...WHY? What is  ³Û
Û³ in "The Strecker Memorandum" that sends a cold chill down the spine of  ³Û
Û³ most media executives?                                                  ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³                          WHY IS EVERYONE AFRAID                         ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ The excuse that we hear over and over is that it is too controversial.  ³Û
Û³ TOO CONTROVERSIAL? They say that people would panic. We feel the only   ³Û
Û³ persons who might panic are those scientists who willingly or otherwise ³Û
Û³ created AIDS and are now promoting misinformation by covering it up.    ³Û
Û³ After all, if you made AIDS would you tell anyone about it?             ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³      THINK OF YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS...NOW THINK OF THEM DEAD          ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ The number of AIDS infected people is doubling approximately every 12   ³Û
Û³ months, and in some areas even sooner. With twelve to fifteen million   ³Û
Û³ Americans carrying the virus, you don't have to be a rocket scientist   ³Û
Û³ to see how long we have here in the U.S. Africa has, conservatively,    ³Û
Û³ 75 million infected; some estimates double that. Brazil as a country    ³Û
Û³ is in serious jeopardy because all through the 1970's they were buying  ³Û
Û³ their blood supply from Africa. On top of that, the World Health        ³Û
Û³ Organization conducted a large scale small pox vaccination program      ³Û
Û³ there in the 1970's. Southern and central Japan has about 30 percent    ³Û
Û³ infected with HTLV I, the leukemia causing virus (although you will     ³Û
Û³ never hear about that on TV). Russia is now reporting AIDS as a problem ³Û
Û³ and no one can enter Russia permanently without a current negative      ³Û
Û³ blood test for AIDS. Cuba has already set up concentration camps for    ³Û
Û³ AIDS infected and they are full (you won't see that on TV either).      ³Û
Û³ Haiti of course is ravaged by AIDS; more than 15 percent of the people  ³Û
Û³ infected and getting worse every day. And so it goes. Virtually every   ³Û
Û³ nation on earth with few exceptions (Iran is one of these) is reporting ³Û
Û³ a growing problem. It's on every continent, every subcontinent, and     ³Û
Û³ every island chain, Atlantic and Pacific. So why won't the media or     ³Û
Û³ government tell you these things? Is it too controversial for you to    ³Û
Û³ handle? Are you going to panic?                                         ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³                            IS THERE ANY HOPE?                           ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ Yes and no. NO, if you are waiting for the government to create a magic ³Û
Û³ bullet. Part of the problem is that all the various AIDS viruses are so ³Û
Û³ to say "recombinant retroviruses." Very simply, that means they have the³Û
Û³ ability to recombine with the genes of any cell they enter and the      ³Û
Û³ offspring or new viruses then they form are different from the parent   ³Û
Û³ viruses. HTLV III alone (that's the most common American AIDS virus) has³Û
Û³ the mathematical ability to change itself 9,000x9,000x9,000x9000 times  ³Û
Û³ (which is 9,000 to the fourth power). The common cold recombines much   ³Û
Û³ less frequently and we haven't found a cure for it after a hundred      ³Û
Û³ years. Besides, does it make much sense to entrust the cure for AIDS    ³Û
Û³ to the same people that may have created it? YES, there is hope if Dr.  ³Û
Û³ Strecker and a growing number of realistic scientists are correct in    ³Û
Û³ looking at alternative, nonallopathic, non drug modalities based on     ³Û
Û³ Raman spectroscopy. In fact many experiments are going on now that      ³Û
Û³ offer great promise. Unfortunately, our government takes a dim view of  ³Û
Û³ any type of treatment for any type of disease let alone AIDS that does  ³Û
Û³ not conform to its rigid rules for the acceptance, registration, and    ³Û
Û³ legalization. Of course the FDA would definitely like to see an         ³Û
Û³ allopathic drug treatment or cure presented by an ethical drug company  ³Û
Û³ or university. Well, we don't think that's going to happen. Because of  ³Û
Û³ this attitude, much experimentation in America must go underground,     ³Û
Û³ underfunded, or out of the country entirely.                            ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³          BE BOLD AND MIGHTY FORCES WILL COME TO YOUR AID OR             ³Û
Û³                  MIGHTY FORCES WILL COME AND KILL YOU                   ³Û

Û³ An ominous personal aspect of this story has been the sudden and the    ³Û
Û³ unexpected deaths of two of the key players. First, Dr.Strecker's       ³Û
Û³ brother, Ted Strecker, was found shot to death in his home in           ³Û
Û³ Springfield, Missouri, an apparent suicide, on August 11,1988. Was Ted  ³Û
Û³ Strecker suicidal? Perhaps. In the past he suffered from depression and ³Û
Û³ monumental frustration at the relative lack of interest in his findings.³Û
Û³ Dr. Strecker spoke with him the night before his death. Ted was cheerful³Û
Û³ and in good spirits, and looking forward to certain new developments    ³Û
Û³ that promised progress. The next day he was found dead, his 22 caliber  ³Û
Û³ rifle next to him. No note, no message, no goodbyes to anyone. Very     ³Û
Û³ untypical of him. Officially a suicide.  What Next. Illinois State      ³Û
Û³ Representative Douglas Huff of Chicago was found alone in his home,     ³Û
Û³ dead from an apparent overdose of cocaine and heroin, on September 22,  ³Û
Û³ 1988. Representative Huff did everything in his power to make the       ³Û
Û³ Illinois State Legislature and the people of Chicago aware of Dr.       ³Û
Û³ Strecker's work. He was very vocal, gave many press interviews, was     ³Û
Û³ constantly on television and radio urging people to wake up to the      ³Û
Û³ cover-up concerning AIDS. Did Representative Huff use drugs? Perhaps    ³Û
Û³ yes, but only occasionally and recreationally. Was he an addict? No.    ³Û
Û³ Would he have known how dangerous a massive overdose off cocaine and    ³Û
Û³ heroin was? Yes, of course. Cause of death: officially a stroke. Dr.    ³Û
Û³ Strecker has serious doubts that his brother had killed himself.        ³Û
Û³ Representative Huff's associates doubt he died accidentally, and yet    ³Û
Û³ they are gone. Who's next?                                              ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³                IGNORANCE IS BLISS, OR IS IT SUICIDE?                    ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ We all know it is easier for a king to have a lie believed than a beggar³Û
Û³ to spread the truth. Well, we are spreading the truth about AIDS.       ³Û
Û³ Unfortunately, it isn't pretty. But the fact is you are not being told  ³Û
Û³ the truth by the government or the so-called AIDS experts. The media,   ³Û 
Û³ for reasons of their own, will not present information contradicting the³Û
Û³ official propaganda. So you can choose to go along with the same people ³Û
Û³ who gave us brain cancer (SV40 virus) as a result of their contaminated ³Û
Û³ polio vaccines in the early 1960's; a polio like disease from their     ³Û
Û³ contaminated Swine Flu vaccine in the 1970's; and AIDS from their       ³Û
Û³ smallpox and hepatitis B vaccines; or, you can at least make yourself   ³Û
Û³ aware of the clear and present dangers that we all face.                ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
