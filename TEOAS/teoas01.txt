Û³  Before we get into the Suppressed Information Issues & Culture articles³Û
Û³ (Isù03) and up, I want to make an amendment issue addition to Isù00. It ³Û
Û³  deals with an Undernet Social Overview of the Hacking Community as a   ³Û
Û³  Culture in inself and shares some insite on current Worldviews. Subject³Û
Û³  being by terminology "Demagoguery". This deals with Cultures and the   ³Û
Û³  evolution of the hacking Culture within the descriptive term. Where the³Û
Û³  Culture is at today and some possible paths that the Culture could take³Û
Û³  in the very near future. Demagoguery Idealism is the prime concept and ³Û
Û³  reason for being of TEOAS. TEOAS recognizes that many changes need to  ³Û
Û³  be made within the hacking community for the positive evolution of our ³Û
Û³  community into a very real, recognized and excepted Culture within the ³Û
Û³  general publics worldview. Heros, Leaders & Educators as opposed to the³Û
Û³  malicious, evil, dark and even criminal aspects of net society. You'll ³Û
Û³  understand more about the Demagoguery concept as you read on. This Zine³Û
Û³  article written exclusively for the TEOAS publication by "§ilentwing§",³Û
Û³  BS in psychology, statistician and Cultural researcher with many years ³Û

Û³                                                                         ³Û 
Û³                Demagoguery (or Curiosity Killed the Cat)                ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û 
Û³ It is called demagoguery. Throughout history, any time a minority group ³Û
Û³ gains some power or has something another larger, more powerful group   ³Û
Û³ wants, thus begins the process of demagoguery. Demagoguery is the       ³Û
Û³ process by which one group, sometimes even a whole society begins to    ³Û
Û³ instill fear of another group for political reasons. President Jackson  ³Û
Û³ did such with the Cherokee Indians with the Trail of Tears all because  ³Û
Û³ there was thought to be gold in North Georgia where the Cherokee tribes ³Û 
Û³ resided. Hitler began such a process with the Jews because they were    ³Û
Û³ more successful, or seemed to be, than other German citizens.  Before   ³Û
Û³ and after the above named incidences our history is riddled with such   ³Û
Û³ acts just by virtue of being culturally different. Various cultures have³Û
Û³ their own idiosyncrasies by which most other cultures tend to stereotype³Û
Û³ them, perpetuating the fear that this group or that, might some day gain³Û
Û³ power threatening the status quo.                                       ³Û 
Û³                                                                         ³Û 
Û³ People, in general, don't like their worldviews threatened and new      ³Û
Û³ encounters with various cultures tend to shake those worldviews. A      ³Û
Û³ worldview is how an individual perceives the world through his or her   ³Û
Û³ experiences and the process of making sense of those experiences. Our   ³Û
Û³ worldview is how we define our culture and how societies are formed.    ³Û
Û³ When the general population encounters a culture that is distinctly     ³Û
Û³ different from the norm, a first reaction is fear. The second is fitting³Û
Û³ this new experience in with previous experience, hence stereotyping.    ³Û
Û³ When the media becomes involved, the process of stereotyping goes much  ³Û
Û³ more quickly, most notably by highlighting the most visible acts of the ³Û
Û³ identifying culture, oftentimes to that culture's detriment.            ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û 
Û³ The media has certainly affected the way the general population views   ³Û
Û³ the hacking culture. Terms such as white hat hackers and script kiddies ³Û
Û³ have become buzzwords as the media begins it's quest to sort, identify, ³Û
Uo     areas of the world, but only recently begun to receive  ³Û
Û³ notice from the rest of the world community. As a culture gains momentum³Û
Û³ ,it also becomes a threat to the status quo and thus begins the process ³Û
Û³ of demagoguery.                                                         ³Û 
Û³                                                                         ³Û 
Û³ Although the hackers in general refer to themselves as a culture, one   ³Û
Û³ wonders whether they realize that they are in fact a very distinct      ³Û
Û³ culture. The word culture is used to describe a worldview and a way of  ³Û
Û³ life that fits that worldview. As with any other culture, when the      ³Û
Û³ negative aspects of the culture receive the greatest percentage of      ³Û
Û³ notice, the culture as a whole suffers. Although there have been a few  ³Û
Û³ efforts to dispel the notion that hackers as a group go around defacing ³Û
Û³ web pages, breaking into computers to steal whatever there is to steal, ³Û
Û³ the efforts have been rather individualistic and seldom. The knowledge, ³Û
Û³ the ability, and the power may be there to do this and it does happen,  ³Û
Û³ for most it's the curiosity that draws them. They are explorers of a    ³Û
Û³ sort learning, taking things apart to see how they work, discovering new³Û
Û³ ways of doing things, and sharing that knowledge with others, with their³Û
Û³ primary goal that of advancing knowledge. As more and more people begin ³Û
Û³ to communicate via the internet, hackers became more noticeable. The    ³Û
Û³ implications of what can happen is what frightens the general population³Û
Û³ ,making it easy for a more viable, somewhat trusted, group to instill   ³Û
Û³ fear of the hacking culture as a whole, rather like homophobia.         ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û 
Û³ The Mormons survived only by accepting the dictates of the government   ³Û
Û³ for marriage. Much of their beliefs and way of life were modified       ³Û
Û³ to fit the majority society's ideals, yet, they managed to survive in   ³Û
Û³ the onslaught against their culture and religion. Martin Luther King    ³Û
Û³ also led such a movement to gain civil rights for African Americans. It ³Û
Û³ is movements such as these that gain acceptance for the various cultures³Û
Û³ around the world. Nor are these movements particular to the 20th century³Û
Û³ but is as old and probably older than written history. Great Britain    ³Û
Û³ once banned the Gaelic language from being written or spoken. And the   ³Û
Û³ language and the religion almost died as a result but it survived. The  ³Û
Û³ Roman Empire imposed similar restrictions along with their conquest of  ³Û
Û³ the world. But cultures still survived these onslaughts, not all by any ³Û
Û³ means, but those that did had similar elements to their survival. All   ³Û
Û³ were subjected to some form of demagoguery, they made a concerted effort³Û
Û³ to win recognition for their culture as a group with chosen leaders, and³Û
Û³ educated the rest of the world about their culture and what it means to ³Û
Û³ be a part of that culture.                                              ³Û 
Û³                                                                         ³Û 
Û³ The hacker culture is facing the same dilemmas. As more and more sites  ³Û
Û³ related to hacking and security go down and governmental interference   ³Û
Û³ increases, the community as whole is becoming very disorganized and     ³Û
Û³ fragmented. The very fact that names like script kiddies and white hat  ³Û
Û³ hackers are becoming the buzzwords is evidence of the divided camps     ³Û
Û³ among the culture itself, leaving a whole spectrum of members lost,     ³Û
Û³ without guidance or support from like minded individuals, and few, if   ³Û
Û³ any, apparent leaders. Unfortunately, this is also part of the process; ³Û
Û³ the divide and conquer phase of demagoguery. One cannot but wonder if   ³Û
Û³ this culture will survive this threat to their existence and live to    ³Û
Û³ gain acceptance from other cultures.                                    ³Û 
Û³                                                                         ³Û
